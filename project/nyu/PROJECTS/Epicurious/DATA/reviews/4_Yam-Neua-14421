Delicious! I used thinly sliced onion instead of shallots. Fantastic served with rice. Very summery and refreshing.

The dressing is especially good - rather than rice we used rice noodles and more veggies (red pepper, pea shoots, thin ribbons of cucumber and bean sprouts) to make a noodle salad.

Simple, and tasty. Added some thai basil to the herb blend, but the recipe is excellent as written.

I loved this beef salad! It was very flavorful, healthy, and easy to make. I followed the recipe closely except that I used thin-cut beef sirloin tip steaks (b/c that's what I had) and instead of the Thai chilies/serrano, I used some of the red Thai chili-garlic sauce I had in the fridge. Don't skimp on the mint. Use all of the cucumber for crunch and to suck up some of the salt. You can add a few pieces of grated carrot for color. I served it w/ brown Jasmine rice or butter lettuce. I will definitely make this again and again.

I will make this again, the marinade was great on the beef. I added 1 tsp of golden mountain seasoning sauce to the dressing. This can be found in asian markets it is used like soy sauce of Thailand.

I made this into an hors d'oeuvre. Make wonton cups (see shrimp mango salad in wonton cups on this site). Make the beef salad and let the flavors blend for a few hours. Put one slice of beef on each wonton cup and top with a julienned cucumber. They were well received. This recipe made 60+ pieces and was hardly time-consuming. I thought the blend of lime/fish sauce/sugar was good, though I used just a bit less fish sauce than called for. Used turbinado sugar.

This is a big hit is our house. After our family trip to Thailand 2 years ago we have been cooking a lot of Thai and always include this dish a meal. I agree to increase the quantities if this is your main course.

Excellent dish - used it as an appetizer without rice

This was so good that I dreamt about it the night after I served it for dinner. Perhaps that was because I was left wanting more. I served it with rice but it wasn't enough. Either we are really big eaters or it is so good that there can never be enough. My advice...double the recipe or serve it as part of a Thai-based meal with another entree.

After having had a similar dish at the Hotel Victor in Miami, I searched the web to see if there was a recipe that would come close to the delicous dish I had there. This one comes almost exactly-at least the sauce! Instead of rice, I serve this with a mixed green salad along with grilled pineapple wedges-just like the Victor! My husband absolutely loves this salad, as have my guests!

I've already made this 3 times -- it's a great recipe for variations: seared Ahi tuna instead of tenderloin, an extra 1-2T of fish sauce, adding basil, marinating the beef with a kaffir lime leaf, extra red onions. And I've always served this over mixed greens instead of rice to make it even lighter.

This is the closest to thai restaurant beef salad we've ever gotten. Will definately make again!!

I think my husband liked this dish a bit more than me, but I did really like it. The flavors blended very well but were a bit more subdued than i expected. Loved it with the fresh mint, cilantro and cukes! Nice light fare!

Very good recipe! My husband just tried it and said it was excellent. I had two 1+ lb. porterhouses in the fridge that we didn't get around to grilling last night so I used the meat from those and it worked great. The slices weren't uniform, but that doesn't bother me, I added bibb lettuce and some red onions in addition to the shallots. Next time I think I will omit the shallots altogether. I like shallots, but I often find them to be ridiculously inconvenient, and I don't think they are worth the trouble for this recipe. I also added a little crushed garlic. I would recommend holding back on the fish sauce a little and correcting after the whole thing is assembled. I tried to adjust the dressing at full concentration, and I put in a fair amount of fish sauce and then ran out. I regretted this, and I thought it would come out too sour. But when the salad was finished it was a little too salty and I ended up adding the juice of another lime. I added another 1/2 cucumber and it came out just right. Afterward, I added a little extra seasoning. I didn't need to, but I wanted to try it, and I believe it added a nice complexity. It's called "Bangkok Blend" and I ordered it from Penzey's. I used jasmine rice and it worked well.

Excellent! I've had a few versions of this at various Thai restaurants and this compares with the better versions. The recipe is very flexible, and the part about tasting before serving is extremely important, as not everyone likes the flavors to be in the same proportions. I used brown sugar, and considerably more of it, and I used more lime juice as well. Also, my partner doesn't like cilantro so I used basil instead (we have a basil surplus this year). It wasn't even Thai basil and it was still good.

Very, very good, and very easy as well. I served it as an entre without rice and it worked perfectly.

This is an almost authentic rendition of Yum Neau, I was shown how to prepare it in Bangkok. It does need rice powder (simply toast some rice in a frypan until slightly brown, then crush it roughly in a mortar and pestle) which adds a little crunch and a toasty flavour (just a dessertspoon or so). It also should use palm sugar or brown sugar, not white sugar. The beef should be warm when served, it's a warm salad, not a cold salad. I've only ever had it in Thailand, with shallots, never with red onions, although I do use red onions myself sometimes. It certainly would not be made with pepper flakes, only with Birds eye chillies. The most important thing, is to get the balance of the dressing correct and absolutely no oil! Much Thai food has four essential characteristics, hot (chili), sour (lime juice), sweet (palm sugar), salty (fish sauce). The secret of success, is getting the balance between the four aspects. Another similar salad (also warm), often very fiery, is Larb Gai, made from ground chicken.

Yum. A few adjustments, but this dish is just so good. We used pork tenderloin the first time, will do beef of course too. Followed most ingredients and amounts, with a little extra serrano. Also thinly sliced red onion. Tried two ways ... with shredded cabbage and with shredded lettuce. The lettuce is good but the cabbage is very good as well. And with jasmine rice of course. Very good meal.

I think I've perfected this recipe to duplicate the beef salad that I got at Thai Orchid in Seoul, Korea. Went to a Thai restaurant here recently and this was made with stir-fry meat and without mint. YUK! Need to start with tenderloin or sirloin. I grill it the day before and refrigerate it overnight. Omitted shallots, scallions, and chilies, and added red onion. For dressing: Juice of 3 limes, 3 T. fish sauce, 1 T. sugar, and 1 clove of garlic. Also added 1 stalk of lemongrass and 1 t. of red pepper flakes, per another reviewer's suggestion. The red pepper flakes are what's really missing from this recipe. The only thing I'm wondering if it needs now is the rice powder that some of the other reviewer's suggested. Not sure how to add that. My sister, who had never eaten Thai, was amazed at how much better it was than the restaurant's version with stir-fry meat. I think she finally saw why I rave about Thai food so much!

My first time trying to make Yam Neua and it was delicious. I used a little bit of olive oil in the sauce, and I toss it with Romaine lettuce, which is how I'd eaten it before. Next time I would use a tad less fish sauce, but I thought on the whole it was a great recipe.

recipe provides a great framework. Make sure to use rare, high quality beef (i.e., tenderloin as instructed). some sitting time after mixing is also essential. try to use a mellow wine vinegar (i.e., cabernet) if available. also, if you're a mint fan, throw in some full leaves. lemongrass is also invaluable.

This recipe was pretty standard for Yam Neau, but it lacked the lemongrass,and red onions. I think if you add those to your recipe, you'll find it will have a much truer Thai flavor. I think Jasmine rice is the better rice to eat this with.

Great mix of flavors, and can easily be doubled for a party. It's also a very versatile recipe: I used chicken instead of beef and followed a tip from the cook from Arlington and sauteed the shallots in oil and heated everything through before serving.

Well, it does need a little rice powder added to it for a bit more thai flavor. It's also great if you let it sit overnight (but be sure not to add the cucumbers and lettuce until it is time to eat!) Also works well with chicken (YUM GAI). I thought it was pretty good, but having eaten thai food all my life though (mother is thai) I'm kinda biased to my mothers home cooking! lol But this comes in a close second! BE SURE YOU EAT IT WITH STICKY RICE!

YUMMY!!!! Idoubled up on beef and sauce. Added alittle more sugar heated it up and poured it over thai noodles with the sauce. Heavenly

This was the most delicious meal! O.K. I fudged it . . . ALOT! I doubled the meat, yet tripled the sauce. I used brown sugar instead of granulated sugar -- gives it a rounder taste. And I wanted it warm. So I sauteed the shallots in 2 Tbs. of Sesame Oil until soft. Tossed in the previously grilled steak strips. Warmed the steak through. Tossed steak and shallots into a bowl with the prepared sauce. Let marinate for an hour. Threw it all in a skillet. Heated completely. Added scallions and mint just before serving, over rice. I abandoned the corriander completely. I was cooking for 7 people. IT GOT RAVE REVIEWS!

I have been eating/cooking Thai Cousine in excess of 25 years and believe me when I say that this is not just a favorite of mine, but it instantly becomes a favorite of whom ever it is prepared for. Most people incorrectly indentify Thai cousine with excessive spice and hellfire. This is one of many dishes that the chief may temper to guest's tolorence. For other fine Thai recipes please feel free to contact me via e-mail

Excellent! I have served this a number of times at dinner parties and it is always a hit. One pund of beef does not go very far however - double or triple the recipe depending on number of people.

Probably my favourite Thai food, and it works well with pork tenderloin as well (Yam Moo). Roasted dry rice powder is a useful addition to the sauce. Divine!
