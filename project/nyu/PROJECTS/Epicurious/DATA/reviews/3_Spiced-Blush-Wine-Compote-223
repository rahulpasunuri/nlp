I mixed my own fruit, using dried white peaches, pears, Blenheim apricots, apples, and cherries. I am a new cook and didn't know what to make of the instructions re the orange and the cinnamon sticks. I peeled the orange (I was afraid to leave the pith) and removed the sticks after cooking, though the recipe doesn't say to do so. Maybe it would have been better as written, but it got raves anyway(esp. the ginger), and from picky people.
