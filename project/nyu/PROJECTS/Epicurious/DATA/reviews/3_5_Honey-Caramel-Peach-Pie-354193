I could not hel but tweak this recipe as I sent along, and I did not regret it. I am a spice freak so I added a pinch of cardamom, allspice and nutmeg each along with the cinnamon to add depth of flavour. Also, I put 1/8 tsp vanilla in with the flour coating and a drop of rum flavouring. As a beekeeper I had local honey -wild aster, goldenrod and thistle- which has a deep warm flavour and was perfect for fresh Ontario peaches. Go get local honey, Don't buy crap from China, it's often adulterated. The result: my husband does not like peach pie normally, but this one will not survive longer than 2 days. Not too runny.

Nope, this is a pie I won't make again (and I make pies very often). Reviewers who said that it's runny, not caramel in color (or taste) and too tart are absolutely right. I wouldn't use an all-butter crust again. As for the ingredients, I used beautifully ripe white peaches, honey from a local farm and good Irish butter. What a shame!

Instead of making a large pie I made small ones in a cupcake tin. I was worried about timing but managed to pull them out on time. I also used basic French crumb topping. A great summer treat!

This pie was delicious. A little too runny even though I added a touch more cornstarch. Like a previous reviewer said, it did not have a deep caramel flavor, and in fact was more tart than sweet. I also doubled the cinnamon.

What a wonderful recipe! I changed a few things, to accommodate the tastes of friends and circumstances of the day. The pies we made were excellent! I started with peaches that had been soaking in a citric acid bath after a day of canning. They were very wet, and when I prepared the filling each addition made the filling rather soupy. When I filled the crusts, I left most of the sauce behind (I later boiled the sauce and we poured it over our pie and ice cream :D). This made the filling nice and thick out of the oven! We also chose to use the crumb topping from this recipe from Epicurious: Cinnamon-Apple-Pie-with-Raisins-and- Crumb-Topping Absolutely gorgeous! And very tasty with vanilla ice cream and peach sauce. Next time I may add some nutmeg or allspice to the filling (for this first try I doubled the cinnamon). Yum.

This was delicious and perfect in every way. Great texture and perfect consistency. Everyone loved it and noted that it was not too sweet, but just right. Will make and recommend again and again.

Since peaches were out of season, I used granny smith apples instead. The caramel sauce thickened up once the pie cooled off but didn't give it that deep caramel flavor I was expecting. Will try again later this year when peaches are in season.

the crust (which I don't find here online, but was in the magazine) is wonderful. The filling is quite good, I didn't find it too sweet, I was actually surprised to find I could have had it a touch sweeter. Everyone at the party seemed to love it, it was gone and the blackberry/plum pie was left. . . the sour cream ice cream is a must with this.

The flavor was incredible, and the crust perfect. The pie was too runny to eat right away, but less so the next day.

TOO SWEET-BUT FINE COLD I used a mild honey, but maybe it wasn't mild enough. It seemed to overpower the flavor of the peaches which was a shame since I picked up some fresh and incredible peaches from the farmers market. Next time I'll choose a recipe that lets the peaches speak for themselves. The crust was amazing-will definitely use again. I agree with rockermom-the pie turns out runny due to the juices. Also the caramelizing part of the recipe took much longer than stated. In fact if I let it go longer it may have given the pie a much needed sharpness to balance the sweet (which was too much). Still this pie looks gorgeous, smells great, and actually tastes pretty good cold.

a definite change from the norm... the honey adds a flowery taste to the peaches and the crust is exceptional! I made this with peaches right off the tree, it was de-lish but too runny. After peeling the peaches they were very juicy, next time I will try draining off the juices before mixing with the cornstarch mixture. The caramel doesn't help the consistency either, but good enough flavor to play around again!
