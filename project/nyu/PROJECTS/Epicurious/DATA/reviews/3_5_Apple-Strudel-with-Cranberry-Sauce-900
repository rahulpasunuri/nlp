The traditional filling of the strudel is done also with pine nuts, and must be made some hours before to exalt the flavor. For a better flavor, you can add cinnamon (1 tbls) and lemon zest (grated). If you haven't kirsch or brandy, it is possible to use rum. Look here for a strudel-recipe step by step (with photos): http://www.academiabarilla.com/recipes/step-step-recipes/apple-strudel.aspx

Very pleased with this recipe. I would suggest that before you place it in the oven, you score the top of the strudel about 1/2 way through into serving portions. It is much easier and neater to cut and plate.

Tremendous! Loved as is with the sauce -- for others that substituted the kirsch w/ plain brandy, schnapps, etc -- I truly believe you are doing a disservice to this wonderful recipe. The kirsch is the key! I doubled the recipe, found it to be very easy and quite impressive! I pre-assembled the strudels, placed them in the fridge (left a little water, but did not hinder outcome), and baked after dinner (house smelled wonderful). My guests asked to take leftovers home (a social faux pas, non?)but I took it as a total compliment. Even received a phone call this morning from a friend who said she was enjoying the strudel all over again w/ a cup of coffee for breakfast. A new fall favorite. Excellent!

This was a great success. Made it for 120 at an Oktoberfest and everyone thought it was fantastic. I made two changes. Due to the amount of people, I chose puff pastry over phylla dough. Much easier to handle for that size crowd. Had to almost double the sugar on the sauce due to fresh cranberries being a little too tart for my tastes.

Very good recipe. Easy to put together. I will definitely make it again. I didn't make the Cranberry sauce, served it with vanilla ice cream instead.

This strudel was fantastic! After I made one for my husband and myself, I made another two for my parents and in-laws. I didn't have kirsch, though, so I used brandy. Also, I used fuji apples instead of Granny Smith and it was still great.

Very yummy. However, do not sprinkle cookie crumbs on the first few sheets of phyllo (you should butter the sheets though). The crumbs burn on the outter layers of the strudel. I used brandy instead of kirsch and it was delicious. I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins! Also most phyllo packages contain many layers of phyllo...enought to make two strudels! yum

Surprisingly very good, very easy strudel. Was much better than I thought it would be -- even better on day 2! Perfect without the sauce, although it might be good next time around. Yes, you do need 9 sheets of phyllo. Definitely try this for a quick, tasty dessert.

I agree with the others-the recipe is confusing. You must butter, and layer all 9 sheets and then do the apple and roll. I didn't have cherry kirsh so i used cinnamon schnapps instead. This strudel was SO easy and my husband RAVED that it was the best he's ever had. It doesn't even need the sauce! This is one more for my collection!!!

Just wanted to note that the recipe is decieving in regards to the # of phyllo sheets needed. All nine sheets are needed with 1 teaspoon of crumbs on each sheet. The recipe gives the impression that only 3 are needed. That is the way I see it.

This was a good & easy recipe. I found the recipe confusing in that it calls for more phyllo than was used in the recipe. I only used 3 sheets & I did have seepage from the roll while cooking. I think the strudel was better w/o the sauce.
