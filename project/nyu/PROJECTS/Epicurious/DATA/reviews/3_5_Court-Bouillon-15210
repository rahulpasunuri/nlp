Used this a part of a fondue dinner to cook the shrimp and chicken. Much healthier than dipping the meats in oil! Also had a lot of dipping sauces on hand. Use an electric fondue pot to keep the temperature up, esp. for a crowd. Very well-received.

Court bouillon was great - a lot of prep but well worth it - totally made the warm skate salad into a masterpiece.
