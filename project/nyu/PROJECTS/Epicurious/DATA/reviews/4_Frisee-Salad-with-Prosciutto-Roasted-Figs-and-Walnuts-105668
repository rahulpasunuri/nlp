buy the best produce you can get your hands on, italian frisee and red leaf watercress are good choices (Eatly in NYC). any good blue veined creamy cheese is a good choice, take quality over name. i served aged parma on the side because this was served with barely scrambled eggs on christmas. fabulous

This deserves 5 forks: a truly exceptional recipe. I used kimpaw's suggestions and the results were amazing. I cut the figs in 1/2 and drizzled them with evoo, honey & black pepper then roasted them 18 mins. I cooked the prosciutto until it was lightly crispy. I used gorgonzola instead of blue cheese and used less of it as I didn't want to overpower the figs. Fig vinegar was the crowning touch of the dish as it's a little sweeter and not as acidic. (Whole Foods has it as well as many specialty markets). For the greens I combined frisee with boston lettuce and omitted the watercress as I felt the slightly metallic taste would not complement this dish. My husband was in heaven: this is going in my permanent collection!

The morning after a party where Id served fig- prosciutto-walnut-blue cheese pizzas, I was looking for a way to repurpose the leftovers. Couldnt believe my luck when I typed in the ingredients and this salad appeared! Thanks to the reviewer who suggested crisping that clingy prosciutto under the broiler  it was brilliant and added a wonderful savory crunch. And to the one who suggested halving the figs (both the number used and the fruits themselves) and baking drizzled with honey, olive oil and cracked pepper. The roasted figs werent as amazing as Id imagined, based on baking figs for desserts, so raw probably would have worked just as well, especially if the figs are ripe. I didnt love the red wine vinegar; will probably use fig balsamic next time. Used arugula instead of watercress for that peppery bite that goes so well with fig. I just layered everything in a large wooden salad bowl, the dressing on top, and brought to table for an impressive presentation. Super easy and so perfect for dining al fresco in fig-happy California!

I'm a big, big fan of the fig-proscuitto-blue cheese combination, but I think it generally calls for a touch more sweetness to contrast with the salty, pungency, so I added a little honey ot the olive oil before I roasted the figs, just to give them some extra sweetness. Prosciutto can be hard to handle (clumps together when you slice it) so I crisped it under the broiler, which added a nice crunch to the salad too. (Another nice alternative would be to wrap the figs in slices of prosiutto and roast together). An absolutely gorgeous, delicious salad - and quite easy!

Substituted arugula for the frissee, as my market didn't have it. Fresh figs were fantastic. The highlight of the meal.

This was so easy and it was so good. I used a different type of cheese but it turned out just great. Everyone who ate it raved about how delicious it was

I really don't understand why people write "reviews when they don't use the recipe. What exactly are they reviewing? Or is it they just want to hear themselves talk (you've been around people like this haven't you? ). Anyway, just had to write this. It's one thing to talk about substituting an ingredient and finding it works.... good stuff to pass along.... but after reading the first "review" here it occured to me that this person wasn't reviewing this recipe at all... they were just adding their own.... send it Epicurious Kimpaw if you want your recipe published... sheesh!... you didn't use one ingredient here.... I'm not here to read your recipes.

I did not stick to this recipe -- but I was inspired by it and the end result was delicious. I used half the number of figs, sliced them in half, tossed them in olive oil, spread them cut-side up on a baking pan, drizzled them with honey, sprinkled them with black pepper and roasted them on 350 for 18 minutes. My store was out of frisee so I used two thirds butter lettuce and one third water cress. For the dressing I used tangerine-infused olive oil and champagne vinegar. My store was out of prosciutto, so I used Serano ham which I briefly sauteed in olive oil. It was a hit. I will make it again. Maybe for Thanksgiving!

My neigbors all have figs trees that ripen at all different times over a three month period. This salad was divine. I skipped the broiling process because I had recently had a salad with fresh figs and it did not seem necessary. One of my guests called for the recipe the folloing week. A sure sign you've got a winner!

I thought that roasting the fresh figs completely spoiled them. They got all soft and watery and I ended up not using them in the salad at all. My husband loved the salad anyway.

I changed this salad because of the ingredients I had on hand. I used baby spinach instead of frisee greens. I omitted the blue cheese (but will try it that way next time) and I used maple covered almonds/walnuts/pecans sprinkled on top. Yummy!

This salad is wonderful. The first time I made it, I used fresh figs. The second time I used dried figs and it was not quite the same, but the taste was still good.This is definitely an in season dish.
