Probably one of my favorite sweets recipes. Definitely worth it to chill for a couple hours in the fridge before slicing. My only complaint is that they are so good, and we can't stop eating them, and they seem very fattening! I made them last night and something interesting happened that made it even better than before: I used a larger Pyrex dish than usual, and the crust only just contained the filling, coming to about only 1/2" up on the sides. I was worried that it wouldn't be good, because the filling was dripping over the edges of the crust in the Pyrex dish. However, this actually created a candied-crust effect that made it even better than before!!!

Made these at the last minute to take to a Thanksgiving dessert party. Definately the party favorite. Made the recipe as stated except I don't have a 9x9 pan so I baked in my 10" springform pan sprayed with pam. Chilled for a couple hours in the fridge. They came out perfect and were easy to cut and maintained their shape. Kind of like a super easy pecan pie!

Best nut cookie recipe ever..and I've made many. I wanted a crust like the one in the photo, so I used a 9" round tart pan with removable bottom. then I cut the cookie into thin wedges. that way every piece had an edge on it. tip: as with all nut cookie recipes, make sure the ENTIRE filling is bubbling before removing to avoid a soggy middle.

These were just delicious! I love pecans and these bars definitely hit the spot. I love good Dessert Recipes that I can bring to events like recipe exchanges and bake sales. I work with Better Recipes and I love finding recipes that can be individualized for this purpose.

These were yummy. I needed some chocolate in there so I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips a few minutes before they were do to come out of the oven.

These were good enough to stave off a revolt among the chocolate fanatics in the crowd to whom I served them last night. The only thing I'll do differently next time is to make them a day ahead, as they taste even better today.

Fantastic! Crust didn't exactly form into balls, but we went with it anyway and it turned out great. Even better the day after.

Love, love, love, love, love them. These gems are going into my permanent baking rotation. Will probably cut down on the brown sugar, or try a honey-maple mix for next time. I found that the sugar cut the maple flavor too much.

This recipe was so delicious. I made 6 dozen for work. It was easy and so tasty. I would make it over and over again.

This dish is pretty good and easy to make but VERY sweet. Make sure that you cut the bars into pretty small peices. I stuck to the recipe except that I doubled it and made it in a 9x13 and I was a little short on maple syrup so I added about 1/4 cup of dark corn syrup to make up for it. I will probably make them again despite the overwhelming sweetness. Everyone else seemed to really enjoy them.

This was great - I made two double batches for a potluck dinner (to serve dessert to 50!) and everyone loved it. The maple syrup was definitely different than regular pecan pie, but still tasty.

The liquid part was so liquidy when I poured it in that some got beneath the cookie crust which made them really hard to get out of the pan. They also aren't nearly as high and pretty as the ones in the photo. They do have a good flavor, though. Next time I'd just make a pecan pie-- about the same trouble and more impressive, I think.

Double the recipe as others advised - however, realized when I was all done, I had forgotten to double the flour in the crust. So, I have a VERY soft crust. Still, these are a great treat. I used pecan halves. I had no difficulty cutting them once they were chilled. Also lined pan with parchment. I look forward to making them again, perhaps for christmas treats.

This is New England's pecan pie! Blasphemous as maple syrup might be in the southern version, it contributes an awesome flavor that makes this dish perfect for the end of a fall feast. Don't worry if your crust doesn't seem right at first; just press it down to the bottom of the pan as best you can.

Followed other reviewers and doubled recipe.It was a huge hit with all my Bridge friend's. I lined my pan with baking parchment and it worked a treat. Will be making it many times more.

Great recipe, BUT difficult to handle after it's done. Definitely didn't cut it while it was hot, since it would've fallen apart. Tried chilling it, but then the bottom layer became so hard that it was hard to cut as well. Left it out a bit after refrigerating and tried cutting it then- turned out better.

This is really a wonderful little bar cookie. I was worried at first that there wasn't enough to spread across the pan, but it worked out just perfect. This is a sweet little end to any meal, rich without being overwhelming.

Great flavor, moist and rich without being overwhelming. A great alternative to chocolate. I will definitely incorporate these into my Christmas Goodies.

This had been my holiday cookie recipe for the last two years, and they are always a hit. You DEFINITELY need to chill the bars before cutting. Once chilled, they cut beautifully.

Wonderful taste and easy to make! I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 inch pan.

I made these bars the other day....delicious! The picture of them definitely is NOT a 9x9x2 inch pan and so, I used a long rectangular tart pan with removeable bottom and it worked perfectly. There is a little too much of the pecan filling if you use this kind of pan, but hey, you can always use it for a mini tart or you can do what I did and just eat it!

If I could give this recipe more than 4 forks I would!!! Scrumptious best describes these bars. The good thing is that one feels satisfied only have a small piece so one does not gorge themselves. Will make these many times in the future

Delicious and beautiful. The perfect end to a meal as you can cut them small or large. Very easy to make. They are a little hard to slice and be sure to grease the pan really really well. I doubled the recipe and made it in a 13X9 pan and it worked great.

For crust, "moist clumps" never quite formed. I needed to add a bit more liquid.

Super-easy! I brought them to a potluck dinner, and everyone agreed that they are very yummy! (I used an 8 X 8 pan because that's what I had -- no problem.)

These are sweet, sticky, and delicious with hot chocolate.
