Forgot to mention-- I went to a local pizza parlor- not a chain restaurant pizza parlor-- and they sold me fresh wheat pizza dough for $1.00. Because my dad is diabetic, I bought wheat pizza dough-- and it works great with this recipe, would not recommend the Pillsbury dough-- get fresh from a pizza parlor or make it yourself! Trader Joes sells fresh pizza dough to for little over a dollar-- which works.

This recipe is awesome. I had leftover eggplant (not Japanese), but did not have enough for two cups- so I included Zucchini as well-- worked perfectly and tasted great. Did not have plum tomatoes, but I used ripe-vine tomatoes, and it worked beautifully. Grated fresh Parmesan cheese is a must.

i loved the toppings, but i can't believe bon appetit would recommend this crust. it was way too salty and stuck to the pan. maybe the frozen type dough would be a better choice, but i don't have access to it at my grocery stores in hawaii. i think next time i'll use similar toppings but wait until i have time to make my own bread machine focaccia as the base.

Great! Almost used fresh basil, but glad I didn't as the marjoram was just perfect with the eggplant.Added some garlic to the eggplant/onions and cooked for one minute. I put 1/2 the marjoram on the eggplant layer, added fresh mozzarella slices and then the tomatoes, then put the rest of the marjoram and sprinkled with the parmesan. Used 4 cups of cubed eggplant and a larger pan.

I made this pizza to take advantage of fresh eggplant from the garden, adding mozzerella along with the parmesan and increased the marjoram to 1 teaspoon. I also added salt.

This pizza turned out great. I broiled the eggplants with a touch of olive oil instead to keep it light, and also added some chopped garlic and fat-free mozzerella cheese to add flavor and texture without adding a ton of fat. Also, I like my crust thin and extra crispy, so I rolled the dough out flat on a cookie sheet and prebaked the pizza dough for about 8 minutes before adding the toppings. Will definitely make again.
