This tastes just like the chicken laap my Loatian friend makes! Fantastic! I can finally eat it whenever I want, not once every two or three years when she visits!

Very impressed. I took the advice of one of the reviewers and minced the chicken, which worked very well. And, as someone else suggested, I doubled the sauce ingredients. I may consider serving the sauce and accompanying vegetables and herbs over salmon tonight.

Excellent recipe for one of my favorite Thai recipes.

Very tasty, but could use a bit more kick. Definitely serve with the chopped tomatoes.

My new favorite. Quick, easy, light, flavorful & delicious. I typically double everything but the oil and the chicken which gives me more 'sauce' for the rice to soak up. I sometimes skip the tomato/cuc/basil/mint on the side when I'm short on time - still a winner of a recipe.

Good base. Made this a few times, but merged it with more traditional Larb recipes: Minced the chicken, added an extra tablespoon of fish sauce and lime juice, sauted 2 sliced shallots with the chicken and added 1 tsp of galangal to the chicken. Feels like Thailand is just around the corner!

I followed the directions on this dish, but didn't think it was really delicious. It did have a unique taste and I foung it necessary to have the suggested tomato, cucumber and herbs as an accompaniment. Thought it was just ok and would probably not make again.

I cannot express here how impressed I was by this recipe. What a delicious, easy to make dish! My wife loved it. Fantastic. The only thing I would say is be careful with the basil in the accompanying cucumber and tomato salad/salsa. Although it does enhance the whole dish, use it sparingly as its strong taste can easily drown out the other herbs. Absolutely wonderful!! I'm going to make it again tonight. The reward/effort ratio on this one is astronomical!

This was a really good recipe for laap. I lived in Thailand for 6 months and ate this stuff all the time. This recipe tastes just like it. I modified it a bit though. I used ground turkey and cooked it in chicken stock, and added everything else to that. (how they do it in thailand) I also used a combination of shallots and scallions to make it more authentic. And instead of the chilies i used chili flakes like they do at the street stalls.

A delicious summer dish.

To enhance the flavor, add finely cut lemmon grass. Also, with the stick rice, put a lid over the top of the basket to cook faster. flip the rice to the opposite side once it is sticky to make sure all rice gets cooked thoroughly.

This is a fast easy recipe that tastes really authentic and profesional. Is "different" and the difference is made by the ground rice.
