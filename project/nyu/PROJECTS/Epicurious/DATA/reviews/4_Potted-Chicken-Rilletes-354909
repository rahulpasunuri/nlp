This was a massive hit! While it may be time consuming, most of it is unattended time. I braised the chicken the night before and chilled it in the fridge, separated from the liquid. Reduce the liquid and finish of the dish the next day. As others have noted, if your reduction time is taking a while, turn up the heat! Shredding the chicken...is a perfect job for kids. :)

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit. I used dried thyme because I forgot to buy fresh. I would recommend using homemade chicken stock if available because it reduces a lot.

This is a great recipe for the winter to crank on the oven and warm up the house. I would cut back on the thyme a bit-- or maybe mine was just really strong. Might think of using cheesecloth for some of it and pulling it out early. Great on whole grain crackers, dark rye bread-- we even tried it with garlic sourdough that a friend brought over and it was great. Pairs nicely with pepperoncinis and olives.

I think this will be spectacular . . . just don't make the mistake I made, which was to use regular chicken broth (instead of the low-sodium broth the recipe calls for). It ended up being so salty, I had to throw the whole batch. Still, I'm going to make it again at some point. The chicken was incredibly tender and the other flavors were wonderful.

This dish was wonderful, but like other reviewers said, it was very time consuming! I preferred the dish slightly warm vs. room temp. I cut the butter in half and did not miss it at all. I also had to simmer the liquids longer than the recipe called for to get it down to 2 1/2 cups. Wondering if any steps could be cut out w/o losing much flavor--perhaps the overnight marinating. Would be a great casual meal for company since it can be made in advance. Definitely worth making, at least once!

The flavors in this dish are excellent and it has many applications. I've used it as topping for flatbread, in soup and in the traditional way with bread and pickles. It takes planning, but is not a difficult dish. I plan on trying to freeze it as well and use it as a quick soup base.

This is really good, especially served on old french bread with sweet pickles, i.e. cornichons/gherkins. As the last reviewer mentioned, this is a very labor intensive recipe. Please set a large block of time aside for prep work and cooking. The good news is that there is plenty left over for the rest of the week and that it tastes just as good with time. As for the recipe, I thought that the amount of butter was overkill- Next time I will make it with fewer tbs of the stuff. I also may tinker with adapting the recipe for the slow cooker to reduce some of the hands on time.

This was just delicious - my family loved it with toasted rustic bread and a green salad with a light vinaigrette. Four people ate the whole thing! Also, it is terrific the next day. It is fairly labor intensive, though. I did braise it for about 2 hours, as I live at 8,000 feet.
