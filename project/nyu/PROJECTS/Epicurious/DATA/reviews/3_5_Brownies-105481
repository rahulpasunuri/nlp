my husband is famous for these brownies! he has added a bit more flour (1 to 1 1/4 cup). if you want exceptionally moist, dark chocolate brownies, these are the way to go!

I prefer gooey brownies to the cake-like ones, so this recipe was a hit. I did change up how I made it to make things a little quicker (with good results). I melted the butter and chocolate together over medium-low heat in a medium saucepan. I let it cool for a minute before adding the remaining ingredients (except walnuts. I hate walnuts!) I also increased the flour to one cup and the vanilla to one tablespoon. I brushed shortening onto a Pyrex dish, and they came out easily. So in my opinion, this is a great recipe to use when you don't want to dirty up lots of dishes, and you want gooey chocolate to stick your face in.

This was a good brownie recipe, but not quite as delicious as BEST COCOA BROWNIES--those were the BEST. I added a touch more flour, less sugar, more cocoa powder and some chile powder and walnuts. I guess I would make this again, but I was already really just using the recipe as a jumping off point...

When you think brownie this recipe will give you just that. No frills, just a simple old fashioned sundae bottom brownie, but I just ate them as is. It depends on how you bake them, but the batch came out slightly cripy on the edges with moist chewness in the middle. Prepare to share! This recipe will make plenty!

As per other reviewers, I reduced sugar to a scant 1 3/4 cups, increased flour to 1 cup, and added chocolate chips. It was a good, chocolately brownie. They were not dense or fudgey, my boyfriend even described them as light. Very good but not great. I'm still looking for a brownie recipe that beats the mix.

I reduced the flour as other reviewers suggested, to 1 3/4 c. It makes a nice dense brownie but I'm not sure what all the hoopla is about on this one. I've had better brownies via a Betty Crocker mix, frankly.

I followed the recipe but added semisweet chocolate chips--being a fan of fudgey brownies and chocolate. I used bittersweet Callebaut chocolate, Droste cocoa, and the exact amount of flour and sugar in the recipe (3/4 cup flour, 2 cups sugar) and baked it for 30 minutes. It does turn out super gooey! Though delicious! I am going to try it again in the future, and increase the flour to 1 cup, decrease the sugar to 1 3/4 as recommended by so many readers. I imagine that will definitely be the key to a perfect recipe. The added chips are excellent (a reader said that adding chips would make this 4 stars). Just more flour, a touch less sugar.

These are the best brownies I've ever had and I've tried many recipes. They are richly chocolate, moist, and chewy. I always have to give out the recipe after I've served them to guests.

Warning: as others have noted, this one is for the chewy brownie crowd. If you're into cakey, turn back now. That said, they are delicious and richly chocolatey. I followed the others' recommendations and upped the flour to 1 cup -- with great results. A good, basic crowd pleaser.

My ten year old son made this recipe by half (using 2 eggs). They were the most delicious, melt in your mouth brownies I've ever tasted! I don't even LIKE brownies as a rule. He made the full recipe and they weren't quite as good. Next time I'll have him make the full recipe using an extra egg, and hope they'll turn out like his first batch.

This is the best brownie recipe I've tried. The brownies were moist and rich without being too overwhelming. It's very tempting to eat several of these in one sitting, they're that addictive. Be sure to use 1 cup of flour in the recipe. 3/4 cup of flour simply isn't enough.

This is a wonderful brownie recipe. After reading previous reviewers comments, I increased the flour to 1 1/4 cups and decreased the sugar to 1 3/4 cups instead of the called-for amounts. Turned out fantastic and they were devoured by everyone immediately!

With the addition of 1/4 cup flour, these become the most incredible brownies. Perfectly moist with a rich chocolate flavour (I use Lindtz 85%), these brownies are the first to dissapear from my dessert buffets.

I love this recipe. I add 1/4 cup extra flour and it is perfect. I agree that they are even better the next day. People tend to use expletives when they taste these. In a good way.

Being a soft-brownie fan, this recipe works for me! I can finally stop asking my husband to bring back brownie mix from the USA!

OUTSTANDING brownies! Even better the next day and they're great right out of the oven with ice cream! Yes, they're a softer type of brownie. I increased the flour (I used cake flour so I knew I had to increase it). I used about 1 1/4 cups of clake flour. Also, I had to bake them longer because I used a smaller pan - a 9 x 9 square pan. (I like thicker brownies). That worked out perfectly. Just had to bake them longer - about 45 minutes (until toothpick inserted in middle comes out clean). Middle is softer. It does sink a bit about cooling - that I believe is normal for brownies. I left out the nuts but I think this recipe really calls for nuts in it. But they were just as delcious especially with ice cream! Delicious - very moist and even better the next day.

I baked these in a 9" x 9" pan so they weren't flat. I thought they were a little too sweet, so i cut the sugar back by a 1/4 cup and subbed unsweetened chocolate for 1/2 the bittersweet. 85% bittersweet is hard to find.

Yes... These are supposed to be fudgy. But they took soggy brownies to a new level. However, if you LIKE chewy browines, This is the recipe for YOU! Just not my preference I guess.

The first time I made this recipe, I used Bensdorf cocoa, that I got from Williams-Sonoma, and the exact amount of flour. The brownies were so gooey, I thought I under baked them, and put them back in the over for another 20 minutes. My husband loved them, and thought they were the best over. I thought they seemed a bit under done. The second time I made them, I used regular Hershey's cocoa power and almost a full cup of flour. They were still moist and rich, and lost their "under done-ness". I'm going to continue to play with this recipe, since they are awfully good. Just want to get the consistency right.

These bownies were very good. The only problem I found was that they sunk after cooking. They were still moist 3 days later when we finished them off.

the brownies are great! they are the heavy fudgy doughy type. not the dry cakey ones you get at bad coffee shops. It was easy to make and being so moist they keep, i doubt you will have a problem with leftovers.

It seems that what most of the reviewers didn't understand is that these are supposed to be dense! There are different kinds of brownies. These are fudge-like brownies not cake-like brownies.

First, I was looking forward to making this recipe, but when I took a closer look at the proportions of the ingredients used, I realized that something was not quite OK. The most obvious disproportion that is bound to lead to a failure is the fact that the recipe uses a whopping 2 cups of sugar to only 3/4 cups of flour and 1 stick of butter. Too much sugar usually produces a heavy, sodden texture. This is basically what stopped me from trying out the recipe for fear of wasting the ingredients. Would be interesting to know what experience other bakers had with it. My feeling is there is a typo in the ingredient amounts, since Susan Loomis is usually a very reliable cook.

I've been searching for a good brownie recipe for ages. This one definitely did not fill that desire. I used expensive ingredients, followed the recipe to the letter, and expected great results. Nothing ever bombs this bad in my kitchen. Whether I follow a recipe or not, I rarely have failures...and certainly not this bad. They came out greasy(like biting into a ball of chocolate shortning-even though I used sweet cream butter), and severly flat. My guess is that they need more flour and salt. Baker BEWARE.
