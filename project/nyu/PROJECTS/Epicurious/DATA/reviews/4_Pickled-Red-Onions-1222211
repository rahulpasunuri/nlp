This is really terrific. I added a couple of bay leaves and five or six whole allspice berries. Also a dried chili pepper and about a teaspoon of white sugar. Still very fresh and bright, but has a little more nuance. I LOVE these onions.

This was fast and easy - and yummy. The only thing I added was about 2 tsp whole pink peppercorns. We were having a tapas kind of dinner - salami, cheeses, bread, olives. The onions were especially wonderful with a goat-milk gouda (from Whole Foods). And I love that I now have a full jar of beautiful pink onions in the fridge.

These are just great on burgs and smoked sausages on a bun. Very yummy, I was surprised at how good it was.

i found the taste of these red onions fantastic as well as adding to compliment a meat or fish dish, tasteful,very decorative to the palet, as well as the plate, the only thing i did different was to use fresh black,red,green pepper freshly ground, as well as a salt substitite and a drop of balsamic vinegar
