We inject and/or dry-rub our birds. We strain and reuse oil. Several friends also do both when they fry birds. Never had a problem. Injected everything from pureed salad dressings (seasoning bits will clog the injector, so we blend it ultrafine as possible then strain once) to melted butter and own spice blend (again, use an immersion blender to really refine it). No matter how much cayenne we use, never comes out too spicy for even the softest palatte. Think that we will try the rosemary floater idea this t-day. We make popcorn like that and it rocks wicked flavor. Costco is a great source for oil. Also, some biodiesel processors will take your leftover oil after you've re-used it a few times. Google them for a listing in your metro. Eco smart use instead of dumping.

Just want to respond to the "tip" about not injecting the turkey with a marinade. I have injected at least 20 turkeys with a marinade prior to frying and never had a problem. In fact, I have never heard of anybody else having a problem with that either. Has the author actually tried it? I wonder?

I have fried hundreds of turkeys over the past 12-14 years. Holiday orders filled for many happy people. I have gone through many ways to flavor prior to frying. I now brine it overnight in an Emeril recipe with kosher salt, oranges, lemons, honey and herbs, drain well before frying. It is fabulous. Just did a turkey breast in this brine and cooked in the rotisserie yesterday ... FABULOUS and very moist. Enjoy.

We've been addicted to fried turkey for 5 years; using a 2x4 through the hook to lower the turkey from a distance helps a lot. Keeping the oil at 350 is imperative. We use a wet rub with good mustard,Tony Cachere's Creole Blend, and worchestershire the night before; also inject that morning, never had a problem with pooling. What great leftovers.

Another trick for flavoring..drop a large bunch of fresh rosemary into the oil and fry it along with the turkey or prior - once removed you can then crumble the rosemary over a salad or vegetables. For those with nut allergies (like my mom) you can use Canola Oil as it's smoking point is high enough - it turns out great!

We also reuse our oil - just strain the oil through pantyhose to get all the little bits out. Brining overnight is also a great way to prepare the bird. We have done two roasting chickens at one time, as well. We will never go back to roasting! One thing to be aware of is if you have anyone who is allergic to nuts. They can't eat it. We found another oil at our local large sports goods store - I think it's cottonseed oil. It's a little less expensive than peanut oit too!

I always wanted to fry a turkey, but what do you do with all the left-over oil? Toss it?
