my husband and i love this! it was easy and fun to make. i think it will make lovely hostess, xmas gifts, etc so i plan to make it a lot. i'm giving it to family when we get together over the next 2 weekends. i'm sure they will love it too. i think i'll try the recipe with other dried fruits like cherries,blueberries , etc. this is definitely a keeper!

This is a wonderful spread for hearty artisan bread! I lightly broiled the Potato Bread from The Essential Baking Company in Seattle and drizzled it with walnut oil and then placed grated Morbier cheese on top - then dolloped with this spread! Lovely! I also found that 1/2 a pound of apricots (I used Turkish apricots - make sure they're plump and fresh) is actually 1 cup if you cut them in half. Will be making again for biscuits this week.
