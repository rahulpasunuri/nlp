Created an appropriate assemblage of the olive, tomato, caper ingredients for just me and 1 red snapper fillet. It was wonderful! I took a photo to share....not sure how to post it on this site. Rich in Cincinnati

Excellent. I reduced everything down approximately 1/5th for 2 servings. Made with homegrown cherry tomatoes, and fresh basil. It was easy and delectable!

I think using 1 cup of oil for frying is far too much so I used only what I needed to get the job done. I poured off most of the oil before adding the lemon to the pan. What an incredible dish. This is a keeper for sure.

Outstanding! I reduced the salt and the red pepper flakes by half, and it was perfect. Next time I will cut the olive oil in half, too.

Loved this recipe, but watch out for the salt! Capers and Kalamatas already have a lot, and so I only added 1 tsp and that was too much. But a really lovely dish!

Delicious -and quick to make. Next time I will try it with the Bean Salad that was recommended

My houseguests LOVED this. I made a few substitutions (doubled the capers because I didn't have any olives, cherry tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes, cilantro instead of basil and parsley) and it still turned out great. My snapper didn't have skin so it fell apart a bit in the pan, so I will definitely look for skin-on snapper next time. I took some other cooks' advice and heated the salsa in the pan for a couple of minutes before serving. It took the bite off the red onions and wilted the tomatoes in a nice way. On a hot summer day I'd probably leave it cold since it would be nice and refreshing.

What a terrific recipe. The flavors are bright and versatile. I also warmed the tomato/herb mixture in the skillet after the lemon (& white wine), then served it over the fish. I've made this with all kinds of fish as well as chicken breast. Tho I never rinse the capers I do drain them well. Just wish I had a helper to do all the chopping (& shopping!)

I created an Epi account just so I could rate this recipe. It was awesome! I also had to cook the fish a little longer and I halved the recipe and added some of the salsa while the fish was cooking. It really was delicious. I also snacked on the salsa atop a cracker with a little cheese and it was very tasty. I recommend this recipe!!

Love it! Fast. Super easy. The only change I'd make is add sautéed, minced garlic and sweet onion.

This was fabulous and easy. I scaled back to make it for two. Only changes I made were that I used grape tomatoes (cut into quarters) instead of larger tomatoes, which saved time because you didn't have to blanch and peel them first. I also cut back on the olive oil used to saute the fish... just a small amount in a nonstick skillet worked great. This recipe would be fabulous with any type of fish!

This recipe tastes just as great as it looks. I down scaled the recipe from 10 servings to 2 servings, which pretty much made it impossible to measure out, so everything was basically done to taste. It came out phenominal! The directions were right on...it literally takes 6-8 minutes to cook the fish and was incredibly easy...my boyfriend a huge food novice, even commented that the fish was cooked perfectly and had great flavor, and was one of the best prepared fish that he has had in a while, beating out all of our fancy restaurants. The only thing I would change next time is to just squeeze the lemon over the fish or possible substitute it for the oil in the topping, just to make it more healthy...other than that amazing!

I was really disappointed in this recipe. The flavors were just absent even w/ the piquant capers. I also undercooked the fillet so 3min each side may not be enough.

Easy, delicious. Downsized the recipe for 1 lb. of red snapper for the two of us. I stirred a large minced clove of garlic in the hot oil just before adding the red snapper. The medium temp was too hot, so I added a dash of white wine. When the fish was in the last minute of cooking, I added the mixture of tomatoes, olives, capers, & etc to the pan to heat with the fish. The entree was light with a wonderful flavor. Served with broccoli flavored with Herb de Provence and a light olive oil and a few slices of focaccia bread

Delicious! This can even be done over chicken, the flavors are amazing. I actually threw the tomato mixure in the pan after adding the garlic clove (my addition) and the lemon to heat it up and make the onion soften slightly. The whole thing just popped. YUM. Doing again for my Dad's birthday!

Really easy, really flavorful and this sauce would be good on almost anything. We used snapper as called for in recipe, but I think anything grilled would be good--chicken, tuna, sea bass etc. We're not grilling so much in MN in Feb....

My guests loved this dish. i suggest taking the skin off of the fillets. also, i forgot to add the capers and the dish turned out well anyway. i'll make this again.

This recipe its identical to Pescado a la Veracruzana (Huachinango or Red Snapper), the same ingredients, preparation and fish, this is one of the flag dish of Veracruz State (Mexico) maybe Chef Michael forgot where he saw it.

I really liked this recipe, and I only wish I'd had the capers to do it right. I put the salsa on the side so I could add it to the fish as desired. Really very nice dish.

This was excellent! I didn't have kalamata olives so I used black olives and orange tomatoes. I served it over a mix of brown rice and wild rice with steamed veggies. I also added some white wine at the end with the lemon juice, cooked it down and then added the parsely to heat up. Everyone raved.

I served this over rice pilaf and it was so good. I didn't have plum tomatoes but little grapes ones and they were really good. I left out the additional salt since the olives and capers are already quite salty. I look forward to having this again.

I thought this was exceptionally good. I used very flavorful tomatos and the garnish made the dish. Also, the snapper did not look as good as the tilapia in my fish market, so I used tilapia, which was fine.

This was a good recipe. The preparation was very simple. I'd recommend this recipe as a summertime dish. If using a whole fish - make sure to buy a larger one than you think you'll need -it is tricky to filet. Make sure to use good quality tomatoes

Upon reviewing the ingredients, I soon reealized how simple and delicious this dish appeared. After serving it to my guest, we both agreed it was the perfect amount of spice and bite. We enjoyed it as a mid-day lunch. I did not include the olives or capers, because it sounded too salty. I chose Japanese tomatoes (lower in acidity) to compliment the sweet flavor of the basil. To boot, I gave a large pinch of oak-smoked chardonnay sea salt to the tomato mixture. The addition of the red pepper flakes is a must! They really add a great complexity to the mix. Delicious, we are already planning on buying more fish!
