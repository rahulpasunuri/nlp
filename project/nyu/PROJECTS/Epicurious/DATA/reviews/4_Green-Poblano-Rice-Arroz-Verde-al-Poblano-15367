Just wanted to add that I had made a double batch to use the 4 pobalnos.

I love this recipe. I bought 4 larger pobalnos and the heat was perfect. I will be making this alot. I did not strain the liquid therefore I think more peppers ending up in the end result. So good!!!

This rice is so, so good. I made a huge batch of this for a dinner party and it got raves. None was left by the end. For a little extra heat, I added a couple serranos to the mix.

Loved this recipe. I used dried ancho chillies and basmati rice. Worked a treat!

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used chicken broth, not water, and I'm guessing it added flavor to the rice. I think next time I would vary the types of chiles used for some added heat (this had good flavor but no heat whatsoever). The poblanos took closer to 20 minutes to soften in the broth. Overall, it was a tasty dish.

This rice is absolutely delish! Perfect side dish with any spicy Mexican dish. I made it with Rick Bayless' Chicken Enchilada Suiza recipe - which looked beautiful with the red sauce next to this green rice. I will definitely be making this again!

Wow, this was yummy. I was simply looking for a way to use up some poblano peppers from my food coop and happily came across this fabulous recipe. I will definitely make this a staple. The only change I made was using frozen cilantro and I added one jalepeno. My husband loved it. The kids were turned off by the green, but after being forced to try it admitted that it was good. I served it with simple pan fried Tilapia and sauteed zucchini. The combination was delicious.

I have made this recipe a couple of times now, it is a nice spicy addition to my more festive meals. I substitute green chile instead of poblanos to give it an extra kick. Yum!

I made this in combo with some Black refried beans and Tequila chicken. What a great side dish. I added a serano chile for a bit more heat. Highly suggest you try out this recipe.

I did not care for the recipe as is, it was really bland. I may try it one more time and not separate the puree as others mentioned to see if the flavors of the puree come through.

We did strain the chile mixture, and I thought it was delicious, even using only water. I loved the texture of the rice. We mixed in smoked salmon as described to make it a main dish, with some homemade guacamole and chips and some sauteed spinach on the side. It's not quite exciting enough to be a main course for company, but it's a great fancy side, and with mix-ins, a great main for non-company. Caveat: Our rice was burnt on the bottom when we checked it at 15 mins. We used short grain rice, plus we boiled the chiles for a little longer than instructed, both of which may have affected the liquid and time needed to cook the rice. Regardless, I think it would be sensible to check it earlier than 15 mins.

Absolutely love this recipe! I didn't strain the chile mixture, and I also transferred the rice and liquid to a rice cooker. It came out perfectly and with so much flavor! It was exceptionally moist (likely because I didn't strain), but next time I'll just reduce the stock to 1 1/2 cups. I will try this again and add corn and zucchini, as the recipe suggests. This is a keeper!

Excellent flavor and very versatile receipe. Easy to make (I don't strain) and it looks very pretty plated. Otherwise, follow the instructions as described and it's never failed me yet. Especially good with fish.

This is an outstanding recipe that is easy to make. We substituted crab for shrimp and it tasted excellent!

I've made this twice now and it's on its way to being our new favorite standard side dish. We served it with chicken made with the Tequila Mockingbird Marinade. The recipe is very easy, although next time I will use my stick blender instead of dragging out the full food processor. I also skipped the straining step - with everything pureed, the cilantro stems don't detract at all.

I doubled the recipe as I was cooking for 8 people and it made just enough. This would also be good as leftovers. I really enjoyed the flavor of the rice, but I would make a few changes to improve the texture. I like a little bite in my rice so next time I make it I will add diced pepper in addition to the strained as well as some corn. I highly recommend cooking this in chicken broth or adding chicken bullion for additional flavor.

It is a miracle that I am giving this recipe three forks, because when it comes to eating cilantro, I would rather starve. Even the smell makes me ill. With that said, it was GOOD! I made it for my dinner guests who are cilantro addicts, and I figured I would just avoid it and eat the other dishes. However, I tried it to make sure the rice was cooked through, and was pleasantly surprised. The cilantro mellows out a lot when boiled with the rice. Also, I put a lot of garlic which gave it a nice flavor, and I used really good homemade chicken broth. I am a fan of long grain rice (basmati) and it worked beautifully so that is what I recommend.

I made a huge bowl of this for my neighbors pig roast last summer. By the time I went up for seconds it was all gone. One of my favorite rice dishes with a lot of room for embellishment.

I always manage to screw up pilaf, don't ask me why. So I decided to commit culinary heresy as follows: I made the poblano puree as directed, fried the rice with the onion also as directed, and then chucked the whole thing in the rice cooker. This worked beautifully, and the rice was delicious.

This was soo good and soo easy to prepare! I used water instead of chicken broth and thought it was very flavorful. I didn't think it needed to be strained and I also skipped the reheating step and it turned out beautifully - I did end up cooking the rice slightly longer. I served this with the grilled fish tacos with salsa verde (from this site) and also added fresh grilled corn kernels to the rice. Yum!!!

Ended up with blisteringly hot poblanos -hotter than the jalapenos I was using in another dish for the meal (it's a good thing I had a taste so that I could adjust the recipe) and only used one-half of one, instead of the 2 required. As a previous reviewer suggested, I served it with the Swordfish with Salsa Verde. Spinach wilted in EVOO and garlic as the veggie. I "keeper" menu. Still, the results were very good.

Oh my! This was the best rice I have ever made ... the best I've ever eaten. Did not have time to make it ahead and steam but that didn't seem to matter. I will make this again and again and again ....

A good basic side for Mexican food. Wasn't amazing, but then it's an accomanyment and shouldn't upstage the main dish. Made it ahead and steamed to reheat per directions, worked great.

I found this to be lacking flavor while still be EXTREMLY spicy. I couldn't eat more than a bite, and I followed the recipe to the letter. Ended up throwing most of it away.

Enjoyed this dish. Slightly undercooked it. Served it with Grilled Swordfish Verde with Avocado Mayonnaise (which we'll make again) from this website - tasted great together. Didn't strain it.

Absolutely terrific. I made this for a dinner party last night and the guests raved. I particularly appreciated the ability to make the dish ahead -- reheating (I just followed the recipe directions) was a snap and the rice served up beautifully. I pureed the flavoring broth with a hand-held stick mixer -- this really broke up the solids much more efficiently than my food processor. As a result I was able to skip the "sieving" step and (like some other reviewers) use the pureed broth as is. It worked perfectly...the rice was extremely flavorful (and suprisingly rich-tasting - given the small amount of fat used in the recipe).

This rice is fabulous.....I don't know what happened to the person who said it had no flavor - perhaps they don't know how to cook.....I used alot of cilantro...at least a quarter cup....I highly recommend this recipe.

This is very good. I didn't find it necessary to strain the poblano mixture -- that would have taken away a lot of the flavor IMO.

Delicious. Made as part of a Mexican/South American feast for New Year's Eve - served with Steak Tacos and Poblano Rajas and Drunken Beans, also on the site. The rice absorbed all the lovely spiciness of the poblanos. Made a hash of all the leftovers for the next day.

excellent mexican rice, it was a nice change from the usual red mexican rice my mom usually makes. i used brown rice and simply followed the directions on the package for the liquid/rice ratio. also, i used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian and also give it an little extra flavor. it was delicious with the substitutions.

The smell of this dish cooking is really wonderful,(I was making it in advance for Fri nite dinner & my 3 teenage boys asked if they could have some when it was finished!) however.... after following the directions carefully, my rice ended up crunchy. I thought maybe I had lost too much fluid while simmering the peppers, so I added more, then some more, then some more... The flavor still turned out nice, but because of the additional stock,the final product ended up creamy, rather than fluffy. Anyone able to help w/ what I did wrong w/ my crunchy rice (fried too long?/ wrong kind rice?) The flavor is definitely worth making again if I can get the texture right.

This recipe was awesome--so much better than rice I've eaten at many Mexican (or TexMex) restaurants, especially that nasty red mushy rice. I wasn't sure why the flavoring had to go through a strainer, so I used the liquid as well (I figued that is where a lot of the flavor was), and it turned out great. We can't wait to make it again.

My husband is a cilantro hater, so I split this recipe in half and made one with, one without. It was delicious either way (although better with cilantro if you like it). We'll be making this again and again.

I really loved this rice. I roasted the poblanos the night before. Simmered it in a cup of veggie broth and 2/3 cup of water. I did not puree the mixture (I wanted the chunky peppers) I didn't add any cilantro until the end and only about a tablespoon. I did not want the cilantro flavor to be dominant. I also added a cup of corn at the end...gave it nice color. I will definitely make this many more times. Maybe a few more peppers next time to increase the spice!!

Very nice rice dish to serve with any red sauce based mexican dish. The spice and heat should be in the entree not the side (rice) in true mexican cooking.

Rating: 3
I'll make this again and again. In my world it's impossible to have too much cilantro, and this recipe, with its delicate cilantro flavor and aroma, really hit it with me. Just the right side dish to accompany your entree, not overpower it. Could certainly be made fierier, depending upon the tastes of your guests. Doubled easily and I plan to take it for my contribution to mexican potlucks from now on. Easy, too!

Given some of the comments from previous cooks, I doubled the chiles and cilantro, which gave it a fanstastic kick. I also charred the chiles before I seeded and chopped them. After sauteeing the rice, I baked it in the oven directly in a chafing dish insert. I served it with chicken mole, jicama and lime salad, and mexican wedding cookies. Guests asked to take home the leftovers. This recipes triples nicely, and baking it in the chafing dish made it "buffet ready."

This is an excellent accompaniment to TexMex or Mexican food. Better and different from the orange stuff that is served with Mexican food so frequently. If it looks like a lot of work, cut out the straining part. I have no problem with whipping all the flavoring ingredients into the blender or food processor and cooking the rice without straining it. The texture is fine and I'm a very fussy cook.

This was a big hit with my vegan brother in law. Very flavorful, pretty, and tasty. I roasted the poblano's first, probably helped spice it up a bit.

This was a disappointing dish. Not flavorful at all. Doubt I'll make it again, but if I do, I'll definitely add serrano or jalapeno chiles because otherwise, it would have no flavor. Also, it was not very green, another disappointment.

Great tasting rice, but not sure it was worth all the work. Can get the same tast in rice without all the work. Used long grain rice.
