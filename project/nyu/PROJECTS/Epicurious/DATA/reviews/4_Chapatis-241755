Made these with curried butternut squash and potatoes (from Nov. Cooking Light, so yummy!) After it came together in the bowl, put the dough in the Cuisinart w/ the dough blade and it came out great! My husband was so impressed that I "made bread..." He's cute.

Easiest way I know to get to the taste [and smell, and satisfaction] of fresh 'bread'. Nice thing to do while something fiddly is baking in the oven and wouldn't let you leave the kitchen for long. Pretty good habit for brunch too... Somehow, it so happens I haven't got to pair chapatis with another Indian dish. Looking forward to it.

if you want to reduce the kneading effort - here is a trick - once the dough comes together as a ball - knead it good for a couple of minutes, then pat with some water,cover and leave it at room temperature for 10-15 mins while you prepare your curry. after 15 mins, you will find the dough would be soft and airy, just knead it again for a min so that its smooth and thats it! you are ready to roll chapatis!

I made these because I was looking for an alternative to naan, which I usually make to serve with Indian food. I had this with Chana Masala (Chickpeas) and it worked nicely - used the Chapatis to scoop up/roll around the food. I skipped the rolling out & putting on wax paper step - just rolled 1 out & put immediately in the pan, then rolled the next one while the first one was cooking - a little bit hectic but more time efficient. I used a lot of flour while rolling out. Overall I liked how easy these were, but I do prefer the taste of naan.

Easy recipe - used a cast iron griddle pan to cook. Very delicious and a treat to have hot chapatis with my curry! Made with standmixer, suggest doing the same as a lot of kneading is involved!!
