I've been making this recipe ever since that issue came out. Its so easy and so delicious. Always gets great reviews. The only thing I do differently is sometimes change up the combination of nuts. A keeper!! Making it again for Thanksgiving this year.

Delicious! I'm allergic to walnuts (and pecans) so I simply left them out. I think using fewer nuts gave the tart a better nut to sugar filling ratio. Gotta like hazelnuts though cuz they come through loud and clear. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was insanely easy to make and soo worth it. The chocolate was melted perfectly and the nuts added a nice crunch to it. I'll definitely make this again.

Quite good and and a wonderful afternoon treat on a cold winter day. Very simple to make and I found could be modified quite easily. Very nice with a good cup of Assam tea!

Wow, this was a hit at a potluck we recently had. It was eaten up in a flash (much to my dismay, I really wanted seconds!). Because I must have it again soon, I'm making it for the Christmas holiday to impress the in-laws. I think pecans could replace the hazelnuts quite nicely.

Overall, nothing special. I agree with the reviewer who said it's just nuts and chocolate in a crust - I'd have preferred a more caramelly flavour/texture. That being said, the crust is excellent, and I'll use it for other tarts (although I reduced the sugar by 1 Tbsp, and found I needed 4 Tbsp. whipped cream).

Made it right by the recipe...it was a little dry, needed whipped cream or ice-cream. It was good, but for the calories, I rather go another direction.

I think this would have been better with more of the corn syrup/brown sugar/butter mixture. Once it bakes it's just nuts and chocolate in a pie crust. It would be more like pecan pie with that alteration, in my opinion.

Quite happily wrecked the diet on this one. Served it for Christmas dessert - used store bought 'tartlets' (my small apartment kitchen isn't great for pastry making). Half a recipe fully filled 8 three-inch tart shells. The family declared it as'restaurant' quality. Served with maple ice cream and fresh raspberries. Absolutely delicious and easy to prepare.

I made this recipe once for my father-in-law's birthday (61st). I went out of my way to purchase a high-quality tart pan as the recipe requires - afterall, this is my father-in-law! I don't cook, mind you. It was delicious and I couldn't believe how easy it was to prepare! That was in March of 2002 and I moved cross-country that following June. I planned to make this tart for Christmas on this same year - went to find the recipe; no recipe. The 'special pan' survived the move; the recipe did not. I spent a good part of the next six months searching for this recipe. Thanks to you, my midwest family will now enjoy this fabulous dessert this Christmas if not sooner!

Fabulous, the only change was hazelnuts to pecans. very simple recipe and came out perfect.

I am not sure why this recipe seems so well liked. I served it for company, and, while it was good, no one thought it was special. It is easily prepared, and perhaps a little ice cream on the side would help.

A wonderful recipe, and it keeps well. I made it Thurday night and kept it covered at room temp untill Saturday lunch. Before I served it I warmed it slightly so the chocolate chips melted a little and it was delicious. It is quite rich though.

i don't think there are adequate words to describe how yummy this tart is. i made it this past weekend for my boyfriend in honor of valentine's day and followed the recipe through. i made it the day before so that the filling had time to set nicely. before serving, i warmed individual slices and added a small bit of vanilla frozen yogurt to the side, mostly for garnish. really great stuff.

Absolutely fabulous. Topped it with drizzled white chocolate and brought to a Christmas party. Excellent.

Absolutely fabulous. I made it exactly as written. It's much better than pecan pie and not as sweet. I would like to try dark chocolate chips next time. I would also rough chop nuts by hand or do very small batches in the processor to get uniform pieces. I had a little trouble getting the crust completely done. Using an oven thermometer, the top was very brown and the bottom crust was barely done. Next time, I may pre-bake the crust or reduce the oven heat toward the end of the baking time. Even still--a four forks recipe all the way. I should say that it travels and keeps very well. We transported it 4 hours and stored it in our 30 degree car for 2 days before serving it for Christmas dinner.

Absolutely delicious!! I made this for our annual holiday party, and it was scrumptious! Used pecans and almonds (don't care for walnuts), it tasted like a top notch candy bar! Lightly sweetened cream was a delicious topper. Will definitely make this again......

Good Lord! This was one of the best dessert recipes I have ever made! I made this for our weekly family dinner, and even though there were only 6 adults, I came home with a mere 1/4 of a pie!(which, I must admit, I am enjoying in between typing this!) This recipe was not only easy, it looked very impressive and tasted even better! If you want a show stopper dessert, this is definitely the one! I followed the recipe pretty close(that is, I added more chocolate!) and it turned out perfectly!

I substituted pecans for the hazelnuts and thought it was better that any pecan pie I have had. The filling was unbelievable. The only problem I had was that I cut it while it was warm and it was a little messy. I hope if I cut it cold in the future, the presentation will be lovely.

This was a show stopper! I did add 1/4 tsp. salt to both the crust and the filling. I omitted hazelnuts and substitued with pecans. I piped 12 rosettes whipped cream on top and placed a "Heath bites" piece on each rosette. It was as beautiful to the eyes as it was pleasing to the palate.

This was easy and an excellent combination of nuts. Everyone loved it. I would absolutely make this one again.

I think this recipe has potential and I would make it again; however, I was slightly disappointed with the outcome. The crust on this was no baked enough although the top was a golden brown and I couldn't leave it in any longer. The crust almost reminded me of cookie dough. I think I would try this again but use a traditional pie crust. The filling was wonderful. I used a different mix of nuts and it turned out well. The crust was the downer.

Delicious and Easy!! I made this for a dinner party and it went in 2 seconds flat!!! I also served it with a dollop of whipped cream spiked w/ Ameretto. I thought it was alot less sweet than a pecan pie recipe.....loved it!

I used a different combination of nuts - pecans, walnuts, almonds and a little less chocolate. Fabulous - I want to give this 5 forks - does life get any better?

Couldn't find an 11" tart pan, used a 10" springform and it worked just fine. I garnished this with a dollop of whipped cream whipped with a splash of Frangellico.

Quick and easy and very good. Just about everyone who tried it said it was like pecan pie only better since it has chocolate in it. Serves a lot of people.

This was a fabulous dessert; I made it for a dinner party and got rave reviews. I used a 12" tart pan, so to compensate for the larger pan I made the following substitutions/adjustments: a whole package of purchased sugar cookie dough pressed over the bottom & slightly up the sides of the pan; scant bit more of butter & corn syrup -- as well as 1/2 of an additional well-beaten egg -- and substituted w/ hefty 3/4 c. of pecans, 3/4 c. of almonds, 1/2 c. of cashews and 1/4 c. of pine nuts. Kept the chocolate chips at 1 cup. While it may have been a big departure from the original recipe it was still awfully good. Not as gooey as pecan pie and perfect w/ good vanilla bean ice cream. Easily served 12.
