We substituted an apple cinnamon jelly for the orange marmalade for a little more "harvest" flavor.

I couldn't find my normal brand ham for Easter and was not happy with the flavor of the one I bought. This recipe improved the flavor tremendously. I followed a previous suggestion and used 1.5 lbs ham to 1 lb pork. Other than that followed recipe exactly. My family really enjoyed it.

This is my all time favorite meal for my dad to make me. It was also the last meal he ever made me. He was an excellent cook and, if done right, this is an excellent recipe. So yummy. Just save some extra glaze. And you must pair it with the carrot mashpotatoes and peas. I miss this dish very much.

My family bravely tried this but we ended up throwing over half of it away. Needs a lot more seasoning, may be better with a higher ratio of ham to pork.

My husband, a ham loaf afficianado, liked this recipe but thought the ham needed to dominate the pork-- so next time we'll try it with 1.5 ham to 1 pork, making sure to grind both to the same consistency. I loved it but found myself wanting a little more spice-- maybe ground cloves?

This was a great use up for left over ham. I can't believe how much the green pepper adds to the flavor. I used my own homeade grapefruit marmalade for the topping. Perfect with Cheddar Grits.

Successful recipe. I used small ramekins to unmold for individual servings. I did not have marmalade on hand so I used about 2 T apricot preserves and mango chutney for the 1/2 c. portion and found this a flavorful result. "Yummy" was praise enough from my young son.

This recipe got rave reviews from my family and my son's girlfriend. It's flexible - I used bread crumbs instead of saltines and somewhat more vegetables and it was great. I didn't have orange marmalade so I squeezed 1 3/4 cups orange juice and reduced it to about 1/2 cup and mixed that with 1/4 cup hot pepper jelly and 1/4 cup mustard & 2 Tbsp. brown sugar. I also waited 30 minutes before glazing the loaf so the glaze wouldn't burn. I also recommend using a heavy pan so the pan juices don't scorch.

If you grew up eating gramma's ham loaf, you will love this updated, hip version. I make it on a regular basis and there are NO leftovers. Comfort food that is perfect every time.

This was so good. I don't especially like ham but since I had some left over I didn't want it to go to waste. I didn't have orange marmalade so I used some peach jelly I had. The glaze made the dish. The sweetness of the glaze countered the saltiness of the ham. It was so good I plan to make sure I have left over ham all the time.

I had made another ham loaf recipe for years but decided to try this one. It went together nicely and was wonderful. I wouldn't change a thing. I actually used red bell pepper instead of green and it was great, and used whole wheat crackers instead of saltines. Definitely a winner for us!

I found this recipe while looking for a new way to use leftover baked ham. Everybody seemed to like it although next time I'd make it thinner so as to get a higher glaze-to-loaf ratio. The marmalade I used was plenty sweet so I left out the brown sugar.

We loved this recipe. It was something very different and not difficult to make. I found there was less fat in the roasting pan than when I make a beef meat loaf, so it can't be totally unhealthy, right?

Based on the reviews I really expected this to be outstanding. The ingredients are all things we like, and it smelled wonderful while I was making it, but it just wasn't great! The kids tried it and wouldn't eat anymore, and my husband and I both don't want it again.

Wow talk about pig overload. Don't get me wrong this was a tasty recipe and very easy. But I think if I were to make this again I'd add a different animal to the mix.

This dish was exactly as it was billed--comfort food. I made it with my three year old, who really liked it, with mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. I had my butcher grind the ham and the pork together so that the flavors could blend smoothly. I used an Oxford marmalade, not too sweet, so that sweetness was not the overwhelming flavor. I will certainly make this again.

I have made this twice and it has been served to rave reviews both times. Ignore the fat comments, it's not so bad and besides, if you eat smartly otherwise this meatloaf won't kill you!

My friend's 5 year old will not eat anything, but he had 3 slices of this served with the carrot-mashed potatoes featured with it in the magazine. Wonderful!

This recipe is absolutely delicious, a true family favorite. I serve it for my mother when she comes to visit me and she raves about it. I can't wait for more cold weather so I can make it again and again.

I've made this dish several times for dinner but this Christmas I made it as part of a brunch that included baked eggs and other breakfast dishes as well as a mixed green salad. It was a nice change from sausage or bacon and got rave reviews.

This is a family favorite since in first appeared in the February issue. Friends are still talking about it.

Great way to make use of leftover ham. More flavorful than regular meat loaf -- this is definitely a keeper!

I can't imagine that anyone found this dish anything but FABULOUS. I have made it several times; even as a dish I delivered to my cousin just home from the hospital with a newborn. She and her husband went wild for it, too. (I sent fluffy whipped potatoes and green beans almondine as sides.) I never had ANY trouble with too much fat and as far as looking scary, it's not SUPPOSED to be meatloaf. Its ground pork and ham loaf. Broaden your palate!

I followed the recipe exactly and had very little fat, skimmed off some but as left over ham tends to be on the dry side it was very tasty and fluffy. Would make again in a minute.

Warned by the previous review, I tried to de-fat this recipe using ground pork loin and 97% fat-free ham and putting it in a loaf pan with side wells to drain fat, and, and, and . . . it was still a disaster.

Disaster recipe, at least for me. Not only did it taste unusual, but it looked frightening. Some things, such as meatloaf, are not to be messed with.
