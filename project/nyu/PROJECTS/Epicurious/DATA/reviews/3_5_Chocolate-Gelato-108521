I generally refuse to eat low fat dairy products... I drink my milk whole, eat whole fat yogurt and cottage cheese, and regular ice cream. I hate the texture of low fat dairy products.... BUT I decided to give this recipe a try because a friend said that it wouldn't disappoint.... its fantastic! by itself it has the texture of regular ice cream/gelato. I added coconut flakes (7oz), and a handful of chopped walnuts... delicious! Will try this base for other ice creams and update my review. Not sure if it will work for non chocolate recipes (I agree with the author, its likely the quality of the chocolate that makes it so good-- I used giradelli). .. but we will see! So happy to have a lower fat version!

I always go back to this gelato recipe when making a special treat for my husband who is obsessed with chocolate. The flavor is decadent and the texture silky smooth. I also love that it's lower in fat than other recipes.

I followed the recipe to the letter and while the flavor was excellent, it was too thick for my ice cream maker. It immediately turned very hard and would not allow the crank to turn the paddle. In the end, I put all the "custard" in a bowl to freeze and I'll see how that turns out. What did I do wrong?

This was wayyyyyyyy to intense for our liking. Much too heavy dark chocolate/cornstarchy taste. Also too sweet. I am new to the homemade ice cream thing and on my trial by errors I am trying to tweak to suit us. I'm finding that while this cornstarch thing is such a breakthru in the home ice cream world, it makes for an unusual end product. The consistancy, creamyness, and finish leave something to be desired. My suggestion is stick with the normal home ice cream methods. David Libovitz has this covered with his versions. Try his Cinnamon Pecan....out of this world!

this is NOT gelato, this is american ice cream... in order to make gelato you DO need eggs...

WoW! Is all I have to say! This came out perfect for me and it is super yummy, creamy and delicioso!! I used Fat-Free Smart Balance milk for the first cup and a quarter and So Delicious Unsweetened Coconut Milk for the second cup. For the 1/4 cup milk added to the chocolate, I used half n' half. I also did not strain the mixture and it is not grainy at all. The texture is very, very rich and smooth. In addition, I used Splenda for the sugar and a VERY GOOD quality chocolate, although I would say I only used about 5 ounces (a 4 oz bar and another chunk of chocolate with cardamon). It is so rich and chocolaty already, I'm not sure how you could use an entire 7 oz's. I also put some fresh, chopped cherries in the mixture while in the ice cream freezer. I'm letting it set up in the refrigerator/freezer now, but part of it came out very frozen (at the bottom) of my ice cream maker and of course, I had to sample. All I can say again is...WoW, WoW, WOW!!!! I can't see how anyone would not like this - it is so absolutely delicious and sooo much better than store bought. I'm so excited to make more homemade ice cream recipes now. Enjoy! This is definitely a keeper!!! It's definitely a winner and you will NOT be disappointed (again - use the bittersweet and very good quality chocolate - YUM!) :)))

It's chocolate ice cream... I guess I feel like if I go the the effort of hauling the gelato maker up from the basement, the gelato I make should be amazing. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad or difficult to make (it was extremely easy), it was just average tasting. I can buy similar at the store without carrying a 20 lb machine up a flight of stairs (I promise I am not as lazy as this is making me sound!)

The whole is much less than the sum of the parts. The end result is no better than cheap ice cream. What a waste of 7 oz of top quality chocolate! Other than being chocolate, there is nothing to recommend this recipe. It's been said there is no such thing as bad chocolate. Well, this one pushes that envelope. I should have just eaten the chocolate.

This is REALLY good! Very simple to make, too. I didn't bother with the straining and the end result was still perfectly smooth and silky. It really does have a better texture and flavor if it is allowed to soften briefly in the fridge before serving (sometimes I DO follow instructions :)

Tried this last night - I didn't strain it, AND I used chocolate bars with hazelnuts because that's all I had - it came out delicious! The chopped-up hazelnuts mixed in with the chocolate did not present any problems I'm excited to try it with other chocolate bars (like mint or ginger).

I cannot believe I made this. It is so good, I also would like to know if this base can be used with other flavors

Tastes great but I only wound up with slightly more than half the quart amount stated. Did I do something wrong?

Would anyone know how to modify this recipe so that fruit gelatos could be made from this base? thank you.

Amazingly easy and delicious. I didn't strain it (FAR too lazy) and I added slivered almonds to the machine towards the end (I know...very much NOT gelato-like) but the results were fabulous. I am not sure why I would strain it - it was silky and wonderfully chocolately. As everyone has said, use the best chocolate possible. It will shine through.

This is a wonderful and wonderfully easy recipe. After all the ice cream recipes calling for gallons of cream and dozens of eggs, this gelato is light and rich and made my chocolate adoring stepdaughter swoon. I did put it through a sieve twice, because it didn't seem quite smooth enough the first run through, but that's an easy extra step and worth it. It may not be authentic Italian gelato, but it is a delight in its own right and I will make it again and again.

This is a recipe I have enjoyed making since it was printed. My husband's initial reaction it wasn't creamy and authentic enough has since changed. We think leftovers freeze up creamier with whole milk, but it is fine with 1% or 2%. Quality chocolate a must!

I've made this several times and it's terrific. Part of my basic repertoire now. Smooth, rich, dense. Low fat milk, non-fat half and half, whole milk, a splash of leftover cream, I've varied the "milk" component with good results. Try a variation with an Chinese twist by adding 1 1/2 tsp. Five Spice. It's great. My favorite chocolate is Scharffen-berger.

Used 1% milk and Valrhona dark bittersweet chocolate - it was fabulous. Used an ice bath to facilitate cooling. My daughter made an error in measurung the cornstarch, but I noticed the problem about a minute into the boiling and corrected it without compromising the recipe. It was nice to discover that I could lower the calories here with sacrificing taste and consistancy.

Ignore the review below, this works and it is great. Much easier than an egg based custard. I served it at a party last night and it was a huge success. I imagine the quality of the chocolate used accounts for at least some of the difference in reviews. I used a 76% cacao bar, and it was extremely rich and dark. Almost too chocolatey, if that is possible. It was delicious with Raspberry Sorbet though - or something else to cut the richness. It is easy and quick, and has that nice gooey gelato texture, which I haven't achieved before. I made it in an ordinary krups ice cream maker.

dont waste your time or money. using a cornstarch slurry is good for thickening a sauce, not making gelato. take it from a chef who has worked in italy; if youre gonna make gelato, use yolks.

This has become the standard ice cream for my household. I make it with non-fat milk and add 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder with the chocolate. I've made this gelato for many guests and everyone raves over it!

This was really really good. I have made it several times, and the last time I made it I used nonfat milk. I wasn't expecting to come out very well, but it was excellent! Creamy and rich (which was a big suprise)

Tastes like a frozen chocolate pudding, which is basically what it is (given the cornstarch). I used Guittard bittersweet and stirred in a few dark sweet cherries at the end. I like it, but it's not precisely what I'm looking for in a gelato recipe, even if it is more authentic this way. Next time I'll try one of the egg-based recipes.

I only had semi-sweet and milk chocolate in the house, but made this tonight and it was deelicious. Reduced the amount of cornstarch a bit, and cooked the mixture longer than recipe calls for. My husband loved it.

Very rich and chocolatey. The first time I made this I was in a rush and did not take the time to cook the cornstarch long enough or to strain it. Bad idea. If the directions are followed this is great great great.

I did not have any problem with "chalkiness"--maybe the milk-cornstarch mixture needed to be cooked longer. The ice cream was eagerly consumed; one person thought it was a gourmet commercial brand (I'll take that as a compliment). I served it with Italian crescent cookies (walnut shortbread).

Rating: 2
Intense chocolate flavor. I used half bittersweet, half dark. There is a very slight chalky texture - did anyone else have texture issues? My children like it. I'll eat it with a a bit a vanilla ice cream to balance out the flavor. My husband doesn't like it.

Probably due to the lack of eggs, this recipe lacked the creamy richness of typical gelato. Overall, recipe results in extreme chocolate flavour, but it isn't overly wonderful. I would suggest cutting down on the immense chocolate flavor by serving alongside something non-chocolate - like some sort of cookie or bread pudding or something. Alone it makes a somewhat lackluster dessert, not unlike eating a cold and yet melted chocolate bar.

This is really good and worth making. So little effort (and fat) but it tastes like Haagen Daaz or something similar. Rich and chocolately and satisfying. It surprised me how good it came out. I thought it would be thin and dull but it's the total opposite.

This was amazing! I was skeptical that it would be rich, since the recipe only uses whole milk, and no cream. But it's great, and very simple!

Wow - rich and delicious. Use the best chocolate you can find - it will be worth it.

Amazing and simple. I used 3.5 oz bittersweet choc and 3.5 oz dark. The flavor and texture are perfect.
