Many months later I tried it again and stuck to orginal recipe......really really good I boiled toffee sauce hard for 16 mins.....I liked it did not love it. I used half the brown suger called for in the cake batter and it was plenty sweet enough. It was better the next day heated slightly in the microwave. I love gooey rich sticky desserts and perhaps had too high of hopes for this???? It was not rich nor sticky nor gooey enough for me the sweetness factor certainly was there but it was lacking.... MAybe my standards were set waaay to high??? That said I will make again...

Pretty close to the "true" Sticky Toffee Pudding! I had my first sticky toffee pudding in London, in a great little cafe/pub right near Tower Bridge, (on the North Side) and I must say, this comes very close! A perfect complement to less sweet English Breakfast Tea. That way, you don't need to sweeten your tea as much (plus you can get away with less milk). I unfortunately used a metal baking pan, so my edges burnt slightly, as I didn't compensate by cooking less, or reducing heat. Personally, I didn't mind the sweetness. I'm a sugar-aholic. =) Yummy!!

In South Africa we have a local version of this called a Cape Brandy Pudding. The trick is to make the sauce thin, not thick and to add a cup or so of brandy and light cream. Then bake the pudding with the sauce (poke holes in for absorbtion) another 10 minutes or so. Also do not bother with Californian dates - get the readily processed middle eastern variety from your ethnic grocer. Serve with custard. (Creme anglaise)

Made this for New Year's Eve dinner party at a freind's house. Big hit! The only thing I changed was using half a cup less brown sugar in the cake mixture; the sauce is so sweet you certainly don't miss it and it didn't seem to adversely affect the texture of the cake. Will certainly make this again.

The cake was wonderful...so good, but i didn't like the toffee sauce at all ( too sweet )that's why i used butterscothch sauce instead and served it on the side..this is why it turned out GREAT

This has to be one of my favorite desserts of all time. I definitely plan to serve it at my next dinner party.

I also used 1 2/3 cups water and this was fine. The cake is quite good. I thought the sauce was too sweet and the amount too much. Half the amount of sauce is more than enough and make it with less sugar. Dark brown sugar is better than light brown sugar. Suggest to make the day before and reheat every time before serving, but don't add more sauce, just the one from the original baking is enough.

easy recipe to make. Water vol given as 1 2/3 cups in ingredients, but 10 cups in method?! I used the 1 2/3 cups and this works fine. the pudding tasted better made the day before, stored in the fridge and 'microwaved' before use. I find the microwave re-heating makes this pudding moist and sticky
