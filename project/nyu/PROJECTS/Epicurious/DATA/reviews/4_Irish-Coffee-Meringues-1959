Made these for a dinner party that had fondue as the entree so wanted something delicious but not heavy. These were excellent and just the right ending to a great dinner. Prepped ahead and kept in the frig during dinner the filling got a bit runny. I would not prep them ahead again. Fabulous flavor though.

Very good but definitely use parchment paper when cooking. I ruined a dozen by cooking them on the pizza stone with no parchment. Next time I will go lighter on the whiskey - flavor too strong for the kids.

These are so good. I didn't make "sandwiches" of them, just put the filling on top at the last minute as some reviewers suggested. They were a popular item at an Irish- themed dinner and I'll surely be making them at other times of the year. I also took the suggestion to use a pastry bag. Meringue does tend to stick so this eliminated that problem. Very easy to make and who doesn't love meringue?!

I've made these many times and they are always a big hit. I make them smaller, and put a dollop of the cream on top without sandwiching together and they are easier to eat that way.

These meringues were okay but not raveworthy. I might have made them too large-- when they were sandwiched together with the whiskey cream, they were sort of awkward to eat. A little too sweet also with not enough coffee zing. I won't bother with them again.

Made without the filling and they were great! Mixed sugars and espresso together and added to beaten egg whites in tablespoonfuls (instead of mixing in some and then folding in rest). Piped into cookie sheets in a small 1-1 1/2" mountain. Cooked about 2 hours before dry.

Very easy and very good! I brought them to a St. Pat's party and my husband overheard positive comments and two people asked for the recipe. I filled them with bittersweet chocolate ganache instead of the cream because there were kids at the party.

now this is just damn wonderful! i just love the merianges and so easy to make - i "test drove" this receipe in advance of making for a st. patrick's day dinner and amiable spouse and i just love it - in fact he really like it - only 1 note: if you are going to make these in advance, they do get a little "leaky" on the bottom - just serve on a desert plate and all is well - also, i highly suggest the instant espresso instead of coffee!

Easy to make and very good. I did not sandwich the cookies together. I just topped each with the filling and the covered beans.
