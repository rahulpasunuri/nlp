When I first made this recipe, in 1991, it was pictured with the capers, anchovy fillets, finely chopped scallions, and radishes were in lettuce cups surrounding the cheese. I served it quite a few years surrounded by a bread wreath for Christmas brunch. Not only delicious, but a delight to see. People love it. I'm really happy to have found it again!

This is very close to the recipe I made while living in Germany and Austria. In Germany they use Quark, and in Austria they use Topfen, which is similar to cream cheese. I have been serving this for about 40 years, and everyone has loved it.

My mother - from Budapest - left out the anchovies and the shallots. Instead of cream cheese she used cottage cheese, which she pressed through a seive. It was heavenly!

I grew up eating this, being Hungarian. Once and for all, the recipe IS HUNGARIAN but Liptau now is in Slovakia. I don't know where you got the capers from, there is no such thing as capers in any Hungarian kitchen. The key to any Hungarian recipe is to keep it simple, using only a minimum of ingredients - PLEASE no anchovies, eggs and mustard, you perverts out there! - stick to natural ingredients no matter what and please, oh please, use REAL fat. Also, do use butter for this but don't cream the cheese and don't mix too much, this is meant to be a rough spread, not a creamy one. Try to find a firmer type of cheese. Hungarians call it TURO, it is hard to find but in Italian stores, you will sure find something similar.

It is a great taste-buds teaser. However, the origin of this cheese is in Liptov, a mountaneous region in Northern Slovakia, where sheep are very abundant even now.

Liptauer is GERMAN, not Hungarian... this said: the secret to any good Liptauer-mix is adding 2-3 tablespoons of beer to the mixture. Don't use shallots, use regular, chopped onions. Butter is unnecessary with cream-cheese! So---this here IS the true LIPTAUER!!! :-)))

First, let do it right. Liptov is in Slovakia and not in Hungary. I am trying to correct this mistake in all Internet recipe files. This misunderstanding came from the George Lang recipe, which mentions Lipto, Northern part of Austro-Hungarian Empire. That was a century ago. This recipe is good. Original recipe has Bryndza, or feta cheese, which is softer and more mellow than typical greek feta.

My grandmother used to make this, but used 8 oz (250 g) cream cheese (light works fine), approx. 6 anchovy rolled fillets with capers (to taste), a teaspoon yellow mustard, one hard boiled egg. I personally eliminate the butter and use a food processor. Everyone who has ever tried this loves it.
