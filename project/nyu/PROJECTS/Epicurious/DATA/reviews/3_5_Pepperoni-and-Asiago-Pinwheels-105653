I first made these for my son's wedding (party between wedding and reception). They were gone within 5 minutes. I could have quadrupled the recipe and not had enough! I have made them countless times since, and always try to have some in the freezer to pull out when unexpected guests arrive. A GREAT appetizer.

I've made these appetizerrs several times for parties and whenever I walk in with them, people are grabbing for these bite-size hors d'oeuvres before I even have a chance to set them down.

These are so easy and quick and everyone gobbles them right up. Honey dijon mustard is hard to find. The last time I used Nancy's Honey Mustard but it wasn't sharp enough and I wasn't as pleased with the pinwheels as when I used her sharper mustard. They were still good though and this is a great appetizer to pull out of your bag of tricks when you need something that comes together quickly with few ingredients.

These are great for cocktail parties. You can use Parmesan or Romano in place of asiago.

This recipe is always popular, but plan on serving it immediately as the pinwheels are not so good luke warm or cold. I've made this recipe for years and have made numerous variations on the filling. Some filling combinations include: chicken & apple sausage, goat cheese and fresh spinach; salami cheddar and olives; artichoke, sauted onions and gruyere; shrimp and herbed soft cheese; ham or pastrami, swiss cheese and thoroughly drained sour kraut. Chilling the dough ahead of time makes it easier to slice into pinwheels, but if you are in a hurry, you don't need to chill ahead of slicing.

I thought these were good, not great, although they were a hit at the first communion I brought them too. I found them a touch salty and will probably play around with them in the future. I'd make them again, though, as they're VERY easy.

I love this recipe! I`ve been making it for years. I use pesto instead of honey-mustard. I think that it gives it a more authentic Italian flavor considering the other ingredients.

I make these all the time for parties... and people really devour them. They are great done up ahead of time, rolled in plastic wrap and chilled, and then sliced and baked right before the event. I generally "over-do" the cheese mixture with extra asiago and a lot of extra seasoning.

I made this once using the exact recipe, I disliked the sweet element (with the salty) of the honey mustard (and I love honey mustard!), and when I rolled, the pepperoni broke through. The second time, I used a good dijon mustard, and cut up the pepperoni into thin slices. When I laid out the pepperoni, I tried to keep it all going parallel on how I was going to roll it. NOW it was good!

Made these for Christmas buffet yesterday. They were OK but a little on the bland side ~ maybe the mustard needs to be spicier. Still they were VERY easy to prepare and I like the fact that they can be made in advance.

Another "so simple yet fancy" kind of appetizer to impress party guests. The first time I made these, they went too quickly, much to my amazement. Will be making these again for a family dinner this weekend. (P.S. If you don't have honey dijon, just plain dijon does fine.)

Easy & tasty! I made this for an appetizer for the Christmas holidays. I lost track of the magazine that had this recipe in it and was soooo pleased to see it here on the web. My youngest son is quite the nit picker when it comes to food and he really enjoyed this one. It's a keeper for any holiday or get together. (easy too!)

If you think that they are too salty you might try a different brand of pepperoni. Very easy. I froze them and cooked them about a week later with excellent results. This is one of those recipes that I think I will always have a batch of in the freezer "just in case" I need them.

These are so good! But I think next time I'll slice them 1/2" instead of 1/4". Anyone who has had these has asked for the recipe.

This was pretty good. Very easy to prepare and you can make them ahead of time. I brought these to a potluck and made them the night before. Baked them the next morning and they turned out great, even at room temperature, although it's better when it's fresh out of the oven. It is a little on the salty side but if you're only making these as an hor d'oeurve, then it really doesn't matter.

This recipe is great! It's so easy and quick to prepare. Big hit with kids too! I'm making this for Super Bowl party! Enjoy!

VERY good recipe. There are a couple of guidelines that the recipe doesn't cover that people seem to have questions about. If you aren't used to working with puff pastry, you have to remember to keep it cold, around 38 degrees, otherwise the butter starts to melt and you have a chewy mess. It seems that has happened to some people who have travelled with it. If you do have to travel, pop the rolls back in the fridge for at least a half hour before you put it in the oven. The other concern has been about how many pin wheels are yielded. When you get store bought puff pastry, it's a bit thicker than you need it to be. Flour a counter surface and roll the dough out to between 1/4" and 1/8". This will give you much more surface area and will result in a much flakier product. Don't mean to sound too didactic, but this is some of the cool stuff you learn in culinary school.

Easy, tasty, and great presentation. I sliced and placed on disposable baking sheets before going to a party, and popped them into the oven once I got there. They survived the 1 hour transportation just fine!

These are great. I have made them at least 6 times. Sometimes I use pesto or pizza sauce instead of mustard and switch the chesse or meat they are always great. Use PARCHMENT or they do stick!

This is a great recipe! Very easy to make - and adults and kids both love it. You could substitute other fillings - like spinach and cheese, etc. Can make ahead, wrap in Saran and keep in fridge overnight.

We're going to try these again because they were easy, but we're going to make some changes to make them really good. To get the 60 pinwheels, you have to slice them so thin they become like chips after baking. Next time, we will use a lot more cheese and slice the wheels a little thicker. I'll grease the cooking sheet too as they stuck a little. I think with a little more flavor, these will get a higher score from me simply because they're so easy.

Extremely easy, fast prep time, very popular with guests. Served with other appetizers from the same article...all of them were good: smoky chipolte hummus, new potatoes w/ cheese fondue, roasted mushrooms w/ feta, spinach & bacon. The pinwheels disappeared in minutes and were good both warm and at room temperature. Will definitely make again.

This was a hit! This was a recipie that seems like it was more difficult to make than it was.

Delicious! Everyone loved these. Quick and easy to make. I used a german salami because I LOVE salami and there was plenty of flavor. Could not get 60 slices but slicing them bigger does give more flavor per bit, obviously. Found them hard to roll tightly so that there was no space in the roll, but the taste makes up for any lack of perfection in presentation.

Excellent and easy party appetizer. Although others commented that they don't travel well, I brought them to a party on Saturday night and they weren't chewy at all. Everyone loved them. The recipe says "ABOUT 60" and I got fifty-somthing, close enough. This would be an easy recipe to double. Also, I did mine in more of an assembly line fashion rather than one roll than the other - just a little faster.

Great dish. Very simple, flavorful, easy to make and assemble and guests love them. I wasn't able to get 60 out of them but perhaps I sliced them too thick. Would def. make this again, got rave reviews.

I made this recipe for my circle mates that came over for a meeting. I hate driving, so I always make food to bribe everyone to have the meetings at my house. These worked wonderfully! They were easy to make and delicious. I had no trouble getting 30 little pinwheels out of them, but I found that slicing them just a little larger made the flavor more robust. I will definitely make this again and again!

Rating: 4
Outstanding reasonably simple hors d'oeuvres, though I don't think it possible to get 60 pinwheels out of it. Could not keep them on the plate. Very much a crowd pleaser. Has anyone tried making them with parmesan? I think I will experiment with the idea.

Great dish for parties. I agree with the other reader that substituting the peperroni with the procuitto gave it substantially more flavor. Also Chorizo makes a good substitute, although one needs to be sure to not only drain the chorizo after browning but to pat it with a paper towel as well. An easy and popular dish!

Thanks, Maine! As soon as I entered my comments, I realized that I'd made the spelling error and wondered if I would be busted. I had no idea I would cause such a stir and although I tried to be polite, I realize that I may have not only come off as high-handed but also offended some reviewers and I sincerely apologize. I promise to stick to reviewing and forego personal comments!

I thought these were great and will make them again for an occasion such as the Super Bowl. I would also like to say that I appreciate suggested changes to recipes, especially when other cooks have tried them and have reported good results - what you do is up to you. I am often dismayed by the mean-spiritedness of some of the responses to well-meaning cooks. That said,I know the following is hypocritical, but I can't resist. Note to Cook in Seaford, Delaware - since you insist on correcting spelling - it is exuberant, not exhuberant.

I must respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer. I do appreciate many of the "improvements" that folks have noted in their comments on this site. I agree that it irritates me when people change the whole recipe and then declare it "awful." But I've gotten some great suggested improvements from others. A good example is the "Classic Spagetti & Meatballs" currently on the "Constant Comment." I made it as written (as I did these pinwheels and didn't like them) and thought they were okay, but not great. Someone suggested using a mixture of pork, beef and veal instead of all beef. I tried it and what an improvement! So, to those of you who don't appreciate improvements, just read on to the next reviewer who followed the recipe to the 't.' But for me, keep those improvements coming! :)

Very creative recipe, I loved it. My companion doesn't like honey mustard, so I used a marinara sauce and I didn't roll them. I just spread out the pastry sheet and stacked about five of them for a thicker crust, spread out the ingredients on the crust and Viola a Pepperoni Pinwheel appeared before our eyes. But, I'll have to say, this seemed more like a meal than an appetizer. My companion thinks I'm a culinary genious. Cheers : ) Skyye

This is an easy recipe to make and to double for a party. I made it last weekend and they were all eaten up pretty quickly. Next time I would cut up the pepperoni to make the rolling easier and also slice them bigger than suggested.

These were a big hit at a party but don't cut them too narrow. Several of mine burnt to a crisp before the baking time was up.

they were a hit with my guests. However, not as easly to make as it states. You have to cut up the pepperoni so it doesnt overlap; or else they will not close. Be sure to seal and let get good and cold.

A big hit. I used plain Dijon since that is all I had. Everybody loved these and they disappeared quickly!

something that should be mentioned is that when rolling, you need to make sure to roll tight. And with the asiago cheese, less is more. However, all in all, a quick and easy party food that I'll be experimenting with in the future.

I made these for a party this past week after reading the recipe in Bon Appetit. They were gone in seconds! Also, cut the acorn squash to use as a container for dip - Bit Hit! Used a different recipe for the dip Also did the Sesame-Crusted Salmon (only I used sea bass). Fun to have something different in the way of appetizers. Thanks!
