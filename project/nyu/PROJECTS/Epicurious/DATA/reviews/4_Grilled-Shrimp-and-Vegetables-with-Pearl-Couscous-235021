Sauted this recipe instead of grilled. Very tasty - the marinade is quite good. Use a good olive oil and vinegar and enjoy.

This was really good! I love the grilled veggies and shrimp with the vinegarette. I did the balsamic instead of red wine and added extra garlic. Next time I'd add some heat...but otherwise truly a wonderful dish.

Wow- this is delicious! I served with quinoa made with vegetable broth. I skewered the shrimp for ease of grilling, but grilled the vegetables on a perforated grill pan as suggested by another reviewer. Great idea! Used zucchini, red peppers, Vidalia onions, and cherry tomatoes, which were all fabulous with the shrimp and quinoa. Would be great for company; beautiful presentation and easy to prep in advance!! YUM!!!

Love this. I play with it all summer depending upon what the vegetable garden is producing. The only constant is that I use Quinoa instead of couscous. As does a previous reviewer, I use my perforated grill pan instead of skewers.

Really tasty, easy to prepare. I made a half recipe and still managed to use all of the herb mixture without it being overpowering - makes me wonder whether I would have had enough with the full recipe.

This was really yummy, and the perfect meal for the end of a very warm day. Instead of red onion I used a Vidalia, and I cut back on the zucchini and added red, yellow, and orange bell pepper and halved cherry tomatoes. I didn't skewer anything, I used a perforated grill pan and tossed the veggies on the grill until done and set them aside, then did the same with the shrimp. I mixed the veggies and shrimp together before tossing with the vinaigrette. Like a previous reviewer I added some kalamata olives to the feta topping. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe is amazing. Love how everyone has improvised to make it their own. However, if you stick to this recipe don't exclude the saffron. It adds an earthy taste to the fresh herbs and shrimp. Used herbs cut fresh from my garden - what a punch of flavor. Now one of our favorite week time meals.

Fabulous. Don't bother using saffron because you can't taste it once the vinaigrette gets added. Didn't grill the veggies, just pan fried with some pancetta and browned it all.

Wow this seemingly basic dish really packs a punch of flavor! I only had small frozen shrimp and sauteed them in a pan with the dressing prior to adding to couscous. Forgot to add the feta at the end, and didn't miss it. This was fantastic! Also heeded advice to make extra dressing, which was great on the leftovers the next day for lunch!

This is really excellent. I cooked the shrimp and veggies in a cast-iron skillet and added some mushrooms. My husband and I both loved it.

I am a long time user of Epicurious but I rarely comment on recipes, but this was so great I wanted to comment. We made this last night for the fourth time in as many months and my husband said it may be his all time favorite meal ever! I add grilled red onions and leave out the saffron, but otherwise follow the recipe. Great shrimp really make a difference. Delicious, fresh and impressive.

Wow! This is a keeper. I had most ingredients on hand and fresh herbs in the garden. I used red and orange peppers, carrots and red and vidallia onions. It was an after midnight cooking moment so I used a cast iron skillet (no ridges and no skewers) to cook the shrimp. I added minced garlic to the shrimp seasoning and boiled the carrots for 2 min before I cooked them and the other veggies in skillet used for the shrimp. Everyone got up from bed to have a taste and gave it the thumbs up.

This is sooooo good. I agree that the vinaigrette is awesome. I am going to make extra next time and uses it marinate chicken and use that in place of the shrimp. I don't really like onion, so I instead cooked shallots with the couscous. I used grilled asparagus, zucchini, and red pepper for my grilled veggies. It was great warm for dinner and cold for lunch the next day. I will definitely make this a summer staple.

This is incredible! I've made this twice, once as is, except with orzo for a church dinner, and it disappeared in record time. The second time, I forgot to toast the couscous - didn't miss it. Emptied my veggie drawer and grilled it all...mushrooms, radicchio, peppers, zucchini, onions. Added chopped pitted kalamata olives. WOW!

This is really good, but a bit more labor-intensive than I expected. The vinaigrette is delicious, and the couscous is hearty enough to be a feature on its own.

I made the vinaigrette and the couscous as a side for my oven-roasted salmon. It was easy and tasty. I didn't have fresh herbs for the vinaigrette so I used dried and it was still quite delicious. Both hubby and kids (2,6) liked the couscous, which is always a plus.

I didn't have fresh oregano and thyme. I only had about a lb of shrimp and instead of saffron threads, I used an Indian spice blend with saffron in it. So I made a smaller version of this. It was sooooo good! I can't wait to make it and follow the recipe.

This is my new favorite seafood recipe! I also add scallops to shrimp and black olives at the end with the feta cheese. This tastes so good either served hot, lukewarm or cold!

Fabulous in every regard! My husband rated this as one of the best dishes I've ever made. I tossed all of the vegetables, shrimp and couscous together with the vinaigrette after grilling. A perfect summer dish!

Just wonderful. I added red/yellow grilled peppers, grilled squash (I did not have zucchini on hand), used shallots instead of red onions for the same reason, added dried sliced red pepper rounds to the shrimp b/4 grilling, and it was superb. I wish I would have made more as these type of dishes are always one layer better the next day. Served it with garlic Naan, and all was complete.

Looking for something different to do with shrimp than my super-garlic shrimp and corn over rice. I used regular couscous, left out the saffron, and totally forgot the feta and it was still delectible. I will definitely put this into my regular repitoire.

Very delicious! My husband was so impressed he asked me to take a picture! I followed the recipe exactly (except using regular couscous rather than Israeli due to availability). A prefect summer meal.

Very very good -- used 100% veggie broth for the couscous and made 2x the vinaigrette, marinated the vegetables (used bell peppers as well as zucchini and red onions) in half of it and then skewered them for easy grilling and poured the vinaigrette left in the bowl over the shrimp before grilling. Did have to use a bit extra salt on the veggies but people RAVED over this dish. Could be perfectly fine served cold, so a nice one to make ahead of time.

This recipe was amazing. I made twice the amount of vinaigrette required. This was great the next day served cold.

I add lemon juice to the dressing as a variation and instead of fresh oregano and thyme, I use flat-leaf parsely. I also roast peppers and eggplant along with the zuchini and onions. This is a crowd-pleaser!

Great meal, will make again and serve to guest. Added grilled salmon wrapped in foil w/ olive oile, salt and pepper to taste, lemon wedges, and a few pats of butter (everything to taste)

Made this last night and it was a hit! I didn't have skewers so I used a stove-top grill pan to grill the veggies and shrimp and it was great. Definitely a little oily, so I would add less to the vinaigrette next time. For the most part, great flavor and perfect for summer dinners.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Oregano is a completely underrated and underused fresh herb. I couldn't find peral couscous, so I used orzo w/out the saffron (which is very expensive). I also used a mixture of red onion, yellow squach, green zucchini and red bell pepper for ultimate color. Finishing touch was a drizzle of fresh lemon juice. Beautiful and full of flavor!!!!

Rating: 4
This dish is excellent! I've made it exactly as is and wouldn't change a thing. I've also made it with tofu instead of shrimp: I marianated the tofu in some of the dressing overnight -- delish! I would agree with one of the other reviewers that it is better to put most of the feta on the couscous, then layer with the veggies and shrimp and finish with just a light sprinkle of feta -- much prettier!

This was a hit, with adults and children (some fussy eaters at that). I couldn't find pearl couscous here, so used regular couscous with good effect. It just took more stirring during the toasting. All in all, a very nice dish, and not much effort for the outcome.

This was really wonderful- the couscous was tasty, the grilled veggies were great- I was surprised at how sweet the grilled red onion was. The feta was a great finishing touch- don't leave it out! Enjoy!

We loved this, it's definitely a keeper. I used less oregano and thyme, and added fresh basil, mint and chives. Instead of all green zucchini I added in some yellow squash and yellow zucchini. Next time I'll add even more veggies as suggested by another reviewer. Instead of tossing the shrimp and veggies with oil I sprayed them with olive oil so they were just lightly coated. I'm sure this dish would be fine without saffron, but it was fantasic with it. For the sake of presentation, next time I'll sprinkle most of the feta on top of the couscous, then add the shrimp and veggies, they looked so pretty it was a shame to cover them.

Can we go to 5 stars? This recipe is absolutely fabulous! I made it as directed for a dinner party, but I added more grilled vegetables (eggplant, summer squash, asparagus, bell peppers, portobello mushrooms), more shrimp (large ones) and doubled the vinaigrette. Everyone raved about it -- there was one shrimp and a few bites of couscous left! I then made it without all the extra vegetables and without the saffron for my family -- and they loved it too. In fact, it's terrific the next day when the vinaigrette has had time to infuse everything. The recipe does take quite a bit of prep time, but it is definitely worth it!

This is a wonderful recipe but I made it much simpler by combining the shrimp and vegetables and grilling them in a grill-friendly stir fry basket, about 8 minutes total. The flavors were outstanding.

This was really good. It took a bit of prep work, but the results are worth it. I found the amount of oregano to be a bit off; perhaps next time I will use half the amount of oregano and the other half with rosemary. I made twice as much vinaigrette, and drizzled the extra over the couscous and vegetables. As far as substitutions, I was out of red wine vinegar, so subbed sherry vinegar. Also, my local supermarket doesnt have the pearl couscous, so I used tricolor regular couscous, which worked out just fine (just follow the regular package instructions rather than the recipe.). Delish!

I agree with other reviewers in that the dressing flavor across the dish was excellent. However, I felt the end result was very oily- even using far less than the recipe suggested. I also used the dressing directly on the shrimp before grilling. The approach to grilling onion wedges was brilliant and I will use it again. I substituted orzo pasta for the couscous (what I had) and used all chicken broth instead of the water. I will make this again, but with even less oil.

This receipt was wonderful. Very easy. I love saffron so I think the receipt wouldn't be as good without it. In my grocery store the couscous was called "Isreali Couscous" and located in the kosher section.

A cook from Ct. It was a perfect summer meal. It did not need saffron.

This was absolutely delicious - my whole family loved it. It was quite easy (especially since I had the shrimp cleaned at the fish store!). The pearl couscous (which at my Middle Eastern market was called Mediterranean couscous) got mixed reviews - some loved it some prefer "regular" couscous. I thought it was a nice change from the type we eat frequently. The flavoring from the vinaigrette on everything was wonderful. I will definitely cook it again - especially for company as it is lovely too. NOTE: I didn't use saffron and didn't miss it.

This is a great easy summer recipe. I was initially a little worried that all of the vinagrette would be too over-powering, but it was very nice. I didn't have any saffron, and I think it was fine without.
