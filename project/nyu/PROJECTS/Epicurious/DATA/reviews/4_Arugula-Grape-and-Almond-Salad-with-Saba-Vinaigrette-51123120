I made this salad for Christmas with Ham and mash potatoes and it was the hit of the night. I made a large bowl and my guests left it completely clean. The Saba is a little pricey but totally worth it. I didn't find Marcona almonds so I used regular almonds, but toasted them in the oven with olive oil and salt. Yummy and easy to make.

Loved the lightness with all the Thanksgivings sides

Just tried this recipe, used a well aged balsamic and went with the manchego, because of its nutty flavor. We drizzled the final setting of the salad with a cream di balssamico that we have in our pantry. Loved it and are considering using it as our Thanksgiving 2012 salad.
