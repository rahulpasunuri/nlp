I totally second the blahhhhhhhhh reviewer. Lots of work for not much flavor. I should have read the reviews before bothering with this recipe. I won't make it again.

It was good, but I doubled the jalapeños and halved the onion. Still not very spicy, but decent flavour and easy! Next time may use a habanero.

Blahhh-bland! I took the advice of others by adding more garlic and cutting down on the yogurt. But, this dish still had no flavor. My husband and I weren't too keen on the lime zest with the chicken either. Oh well...they can't all be winners!

I added more garlic to marinade, kept marinade quite thick on chicken, and rolled chicken in crumbled ritz crackers.The texture and taste were better than the first time I made it.

This recipe was okay, it reminded me of an Indian dish I once had. Instead of grilling it, I cooked it in the oven at 350 for 25-30 minute with the marinade, then served over rice. Not sure if I'd make it again.

After reading the other reviews, I decided to cut the yogurt in half but left everything else at the stated amounts. The chicken had flavor, but it wasn't strong. I was left with a lot of marinade, so I cooked that down to make a sauce for the chicken, which helped. It was good, but not great.

After reading the comments from the other reviewers on how bland this dish was, I grilled the chicken (I had marinated skinless chicken breasts) on the BBQ. It wasn't bad - very moist but suprisingly - given the marinade ingredients - not as flavourful as I would have expected. Any ideas anyone?

Bland, bland, bland. I cut the recipe in half and used chicken breasts with the skin and bone in. Cut the baking time to 30 minutes total. The chicken was very moist, but the marinade had no taste at all. Couldn't taste anything but the herbs.

This is a quick, great and super easy recipe. Have made it several times for friends and its always a hit.

I was shocked that this dish was so bland and boring. It has all of my favorite ingredients, but it seemed as if the ratio of spices/flavor to yogurt was too weak. I had a lot of marinade left over, so I added a lot more heat to it and it was still just so-so. It was edible, the chicken was moist, but I will not make it again.

Super easy. I'm always looking for vegetarian/meat eating combos, so I set aside some marinade & marinated tofu in addition to the chicken. Chicken was a hit & the tofu wasn't bad. Will make again.

Great tasting and juicy; used only chicken thighs. Had to make minor change; used lemon instead of lime and added a tsp. of cumin
