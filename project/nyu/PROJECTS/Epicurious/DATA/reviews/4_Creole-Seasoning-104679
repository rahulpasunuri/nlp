Fast to make. Used this to ramp up this site's Gumbo Z'herbes recipe (which I've made before)

Very good recipe. The quantities seemed pretty large so I made a 1/4 to 1/3 recipe using three very good sundried tomato sausages, all the peppers, and only one cube of butter. It came out spicy, but delicious. Hint: use very fresh paprika - 1/2 spicy and 1/2 sweet. 5-6 servings.
