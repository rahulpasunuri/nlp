Simple and delicious! The saltiness of the proscuitto, the tartness of the wine and the herbiness of the sage combine to make magic in your mouth.

As usual at Epicurious, reviewers completely alter recipes and rave about their mediocre results. Here's four forks in your eye. This recipe is all about the VEAL. Sweet, succulent, suffering baby cow. Boneless/skinless chicken breast is bland and has no flavor of its own. And if you think those birds suffered any less for your meal think again. Stick to the original recipe. It's pure, simple, and delicious.

This is a fabulous base recipe. I too used the boneless, skinless chicken breasts pounded and cut into smaller pieces. This was a HUGE hit in our house. Delicious!

Great suggestion from the ZaZa chef! I used boneless chicken breast tenders, pounded, and it was delicious! Easy too!

fantastic! a couple of tweaks: Used half olive oil/half butter. Didn't make the pan sauce, just served with wedges of lemon. World's easiest mid-week dinner. Now that I've discovered this, I will make again.

I make this and add Fontina chesse when it goes in the oven. I've heard the traditional way is to roll it as Saltimboca means "jump in the mouth".

indeed this recipe is elementary; here are some ways to make it better: -make a roux by adding flour to the pan drippings before you deglaze with wine. -add lemon juice and chicken stock when deglazing (use salt/pepper/sugar to balance) -fry sage leaves whole in oil until crisp, then sprinkle crushed or use whole as a garnish (adds levels that you cannot comprehend unless you try it) enjoy. ~Zaza's Cucina~
