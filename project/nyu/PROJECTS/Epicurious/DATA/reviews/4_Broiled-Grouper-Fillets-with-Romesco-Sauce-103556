Terrific sauce, very good on grouper, but would be a good vegan meal on toasted Italian bread, or vegetarian, on toasted bread with Manchego cheese broiled on it. Num.

This recipe is off the charts AMAZING! We (my husband actually)has made this recipe over and over again and I love, love it!

Excellent recipe. I used the Romesco Sauce on french bread grilled on my George Foreman grill, then added the broiled grouper. Delicious!

I heated a black cast iron pan w/oil in a 500 degree oven- salted and peppered the grouper, a squeeze of lime, and 1/2 tsp olive oil over the top- put in for 10 min- reduced heat to 350 and cooked till done- about 12 min more. I used skin on raw almonds (toasted) for the sauce and everything was terrific! I will definitely use this sauce for pita chips and a raw vegetable dip-

I love this sauce and serve it with any white fish that needs a little oomph. I always use wheat bread (because that is what I have in the house) and I leave the crust on. I have also added a chipotle pepper at times to give it a kick more of spice.

This dish was very clean and fresh. We agree with other comments about the fish being a little boring, but with the sauce over, it was exceptional. We really like that this can be made for gluten-free family members by substituting only 1 item (the slice of bread.) We served over roasted asparagus spears and the flavor combination was outstanding. Will definitely make whenever grouper is on sale!

Thought this was excellent-used honey wheat bread instead of white but otherwise made the dish as directed-excellent flavor even if you're not a fish lover

This sauce is really great, and can be used as a dip or on other meats, seafood or potatoes. I love grouper and think it does a nice job standing up to a very flavorful sauce like this one! I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and also added a little less than 1/2 t of smoked paprika and the sauce turned out great.

This romesco recipe is great, but I used only one tbsp of vinegar and that was plenty. I served it with grilled garlic scapes, scallions, and shrimp.

The sauce so overpowered the grouper IN A BIG WAY! We love garlic and spicy stuff..used the leftover sauce to dip fresh veggies in..now that is what this sauce is good for..would never put it over fish again..might be good on chicken.

I substituted spanish smoked paprika for the red pepper and it was great. Used sherry and a little lemon juice instead of the vinegar and it worked well. Sad to say, we didn't have grouper or snapper or anything of the like at the fish market (midwest sighs), so I used tilapia marinated in olive oil, lemon juice, cilantro, garlic, salt and spanish smoked paprika, which was good but not stunning. This is also good on grilled chicken kebobs with onion.

I first discovered this recipe a few years back when I moved to Florida and started coming home with the fresh catch of the day - grouper. This sauce is so awesome my small children now love to eat fish. I even made it on an open fire (squashing the freshly flamed pepper and almonds) and some nearby campers came to see what smelled so good... We shared the food and the recipe and made some new friends. Awesome.

Sauce was 4 forks, fish was 2. Nothing special with the fish, but I am thankfull I had the sauce to liven it up. I too would cut back on the pepper flakes as it made the dish a bit too intense in large quantities.

Rating: 3
I'd give this four forks, except I only made the sauce, not the grouper (the sauce was phenomenal). I served it over almond crusted halibut and I had the rest for breakfast, it was so good!

This was a keeper. Used 1/4 tsp. of the red pepper flakes and grouper. After I made the sauce, I googled romesco sauce and saw that usually tomato is an ingredient. So...I took a can of recipe ready roasted garlic tomatos, drained them well, coarsely chopped them and mixed them in. Gave the sauce a little texture and was just delicious. Sliced black olives might also add some interest.

I've never made the grouper, but the romesco sauce is a huge hit at all my parties. I multiply the recipe by 4 and serve it with roasted potato wedges, steamed green beans, and grilled scallions. My family and friends can never get enough! And it keeps well in the fridge for two or three days.

Easy and fabuloso! I had no roasted red peppers, so sauteed some sweet mini peppers in olive oil.

I made a mistake with the sauce and it came out so thick it had to be scooped onto the fish with a fork. Although it was tasty, I would reduce the amount of garlic next time -- my stomach couldn't handle so much raw garlic.

I made this last night for company for the 1st time, and WOW! Very easy and makes a beautful presentation on plate. I will be keeping this and making it again with grouper.

Wow! I made this during the week for a fast dinner, but it was so fabulous that I wouldn't think twice of serving it for company. I made it with steamed stringbeans which were excellent dipped in the extra sauce.

I made it using grouper and it was delicious! The sauce was fantastic. Our 19 yr. old daughter liked this! Need I say more?

This sauce was extremely flavorful, especially for garlic lovers. I made the sauce exactly as written, except my almonds were slivered, not whole. For the fish, I used roasted monkfish, which looked a lot fresher and nicer in the store than the grouper, which was also more expensive. I think it would go well any kind of firm fleshed fish that isn't delicate.

Rating: 4
The sauce is the star here! You have to love raw garlic and intense flavors, but if you do, you will love this. I switched out the fish, using roasted monkfish instead of grouper, because that was what looked good at the market. Any kind of firm white fish will do just fine. This gets extra points for being easy, but it would be a four-forker even if it took all day to make.

This is one of the best grouper recipes ever on this site! I increased the red pepper and garlic and dropped the hot red pepper flakes. Superb taste and great color from the red peppers!

This was outstanding! I would definitely make it again! Based on other reviews, I reduced the crushed red pepper to half the amount, but I think it could have used a little more. Also, I seasoned the grouper w/Lawry's Seasoning Salt w/Black Pepper before broiling. Even my 13-year-old son loved it. I served it w/pan-roasted potatoes and steamed asparagus.

Fantastic. Used Tilapia and worked just fine. Had leftovers the next day and heated the two together and it was even better than the first day, which I could hardly imagine. This is a keeper.

This was excellent! We dusted the scamp( which is the best variety of grouper) with cajun seasoning and grilled it. Would use the sauce with pasta or for an appetizer in the future.

Keep the sauce!Lose the fish!!! This is my first review without giving a rating. While I love fish, I think the grouper was pretty much blah in this dish.Maybe a chilean sea bass or swordfish. Anyway, the sauce was excellent!!! I did use it on grilled bread the next day and it couldn't be better. I WOULD rate the sauce 4 forks.

Wow. This is the best recipe for white fish - having used both Chilean Sea Bass and Grouper - both turned out just fantastic. I added a little too much pepper flakes into the Romesco sauce the second time around, but chucked it into the freezer to use as an appetizer another time - waste not want not! I actually got some friends hooked on fish now !!

I made this using fresh halibut in place of the grouper. I put a macadamia nut crust on the fish and oven seared it. It was wonderful topped with the romesco sauce. I served it with peeled, sliced oranges in olive oil. Wonderful dish!

I used this recipe to spice up some Idaho crappie and the results were incredible! A GREAT recipe for any white fish. The Romesco sauce was easy to prepare and was tantalizing.

I worked in a Mediterranean Restaurant in NYC - we used Romesco with a Prawn dish - one tip to make a richer Romesco is to roast the almonds or hazelnuts - in the oven until lightly browned and sautee the bread in a little olive oil - then process together with the other ingredients - delish!!

I doubled the garlic, wonderful recipe.

The romesco sauce is fabulous! It was very good on the fish (we had a lovely, sweet piece of grouper)and I will serve it again that way - but I am planning to serve the sauce as a dip with veggies and crackers (use a slightly sweet cracker like Wheat Thins)on a regular basis - it is delicious and so different from the usual. As other reviewers have said, the hot red pepper flakes add quite a kick so cut back if you don't want that much heat.

In Tucson, we can get fresh Sea of Cortez grouper everyday. After coating with olive oil, I lightly dusted filets with Old Bay and grilled them in a fish basket. The romesco sauce was OK, but we used very little of it.

Great recipe. Sauce was very easy to make in food processor, substituted a European style white bread and warmed sauce slightly in microwave before serving.

Rating: 4
Very easy and delicious. I didn't have almonds but substituted peanuts and pine nuts. It was great. I second the comment on taking it easy with the red pepper...I love spicy food, but even a scant half-teaspoon can overwhelm the other flavors of the sauce and a delicate fish.

I have made this recipe twice now, and each time we have raved about how delicious it has been. Easy to prepare and so good to eat. The sauce could be used on other fish easily.

My husband and I thought this dinner was okay. I didn't care for the sauce and grouper is hard to find and expensive in our area.

I had never tried grouper before. My husband found it at a local store & was thrilled because he had loved it as a child in the south. I found this recipe--& WOW! The sauce is really wonderful & super simple. I'm making it again tonight.

i couldn't get grouper, so i used something else, sorry, i can't remember what type of fish. but the sauce is so easy and doesn't even need to be cooked. watch the amount of red pepper flakes as this can be overpowering if your fish is a delicate one. i served this with boiled new potatoes, green salad, and a great dry white from Oregon--very enjoyable summer meal.
