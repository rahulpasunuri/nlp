OMG! This is SO good and so easy! Per other reviewers suggestions, used extra garlic (4-5 cloves) and 2 cups half and half. I sliced the potatoes early in the day and tossed in a ziplock bag, then made the gratin before my guests arrived on Easter day and tossed in the oven just as they pulled in. Served with the rack of lamb with mustard and panko crust, also on this site. Will wait for another "special" occasion to make again...too many yummy calories for every day indulging!

This is, now a 'family clasic'. I made these potaoes for the first time for my son's fourth birthday party, and that was eight years ago. I expect this dish on my mother's table every time there is a new guest ... perfect ...

Four stars is the minimum I would give for this dish. I adjusted slightly for our taste, substituting half-and-half for the whipping cream, adding 1/4 cup finely diced onion, 3 cloves garlic, and finely chopped fresh sage and tarragon. Amazingly good and a perfect balance of traditional home-cooking with a fresh new flavor. A new go-to favorite!!!

I can't believe only 90% would make this again. That should be a solid 100%! I've made these for many dinner parties and they are a huge hit. I usually make a double batch. I use a tad more cheese than the recipe calls for, but follow everything else exactly. I recently bought some fun individual casserole dishes and made personal size servings of potatoes last night. Worked like a charm.

Ugh...My entire family didn't like it. The goat cheese, or that particular brand was way too strong! My friends and family prefer the following recipe to this one: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Potato-Gratin-with-White-Cheddar-Cheese-103143 Nothing is ever left!

So simple and so good. Made for Easter as a side dish and got rave reviews. Everyone wanted the recipe... I made a double batch, used about 15 oz. herbed goat cheese and eight cloves of garlic. Other than that, just followed recipe by doubling ingredients. The double batch took about 1.5 hours and then we let it rest covered in foil for about fifteen minutes.

This has become one of my favorite potato dishes. It even won the hearts of my low-carb loving relatives when I served it with London Broil at a recent dinner. My only beef is that to include garlic in the title, I'd say a dish should have more than one clove! I roasted a full head of garlic and included every tasty bit of it when I made this dish, and it was fantastic.

I would give this 3 1/2 forks if I could, because this really was a delicious gratin. At first I was a little unsure if I liked it, but it definitely grew on me. In fact, it was even better left over, which was strange. Usually gratins are really yucky when they're left over, so I was so surprised to find that this was even more delicious. I doubled the garlic, which I would suggest doing. Next time I may roast the garlic, and I'll certainly cook the gratin longer--at the suggested time, some of the potatoes were still a little hard. Also, the browned bits were icredible, and I would like to have more of them next time.

This was super easy and delicious! Used the food processor for thinly slicing the Yukon Golds. Used the mixer to whisk heavy cream and 2% milk (no whipping cream or whole milk on hand), 8oz log of Trader Joe's chevre (at room temp), chopped fresh sage, 2 cloves minced garlic, S&P. Baked for 1 hr in 9x13 dish and covered with foil for last 15 minutes. Sat for 15 min to set and my friends loved it! Looks like you can easily half the recipe in an 8x8 dish. This recipe is definitely a keeper and one where you can easily change out the flavors.

This dish was the single most delicious thing I have ever had the pleasure to make. No joke. I added an extra garlic clove, and accidentally bought chive-flavored Montrachet, which turned out to be a particularly tasty mistake! A bit too fattening to join the regular rotation, but this recipe is outta this world, and a definite keeper.

Wow, this dish is sinfully delicious, and easy to prepare with a cuisinart slicer. One note - 2 lbs of potatoes is not very much; I was having a dinner party for 8 and doubled the recipie - it was the perfect amount and filled up a regular rectangular baking dish. I added a bit more garlic but other than that followed the recipie. It takes a bit longer to cook than the recipie says - alot 1.5 hrs if doubling the recipie. One suggestion - the dish comes out of the oven bubbly and watery, but letting it sit for 15 - 20 minutes helps the ingredients "congeal " into something more visually appealing and easier to slice and serve.

Rating: 3
One of the previous reviewers mentioned that most people don't even realize there is goat cheese in this recipe, that the flavor wasn't overpowering. Partly on the basis of that review and other positive reviews, I made this for Thanksgiving. Since I really like goat cheese and my husband will "tolerate" a subtler touch of its flavor, I thought this dish might be a good compromise. To my delight and my husband's chagrin, the goat cheese flavor was quite strong. I followed the recipe exactly and used Montrachet brand goat cheese in the amount called for; the aroma and pungent flavor of the goat cheese was quite evident to both of us. I'm more than happy to have the leftovers all to myself over the next few days, but I do not recommend making this dish for anyone who doesn't enthusiastically enjoy goat cheese. I'm wondering if the reviewer who said people didn't realize it had goat cheese in it knows whether those folks had ever tasted goat cheese in the first place - they wouldn't have recognized a flavor they didn't know. Anyway, for me personally this is a wonderful, delicious little gem and I'll make it again when I know my target diners would welcome a very rich and flavorful goat cheese potato gratin.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic. I made it with some modifications to keep the rich flavor, but to make it less heavy. I used skim milk and replaced the cream with shredded fontina and asiago cheeses. We didn't have nutmeg on hand so I used a mixture of clove and cinnamon to keep a warm spice flavor, also doubled the garlic and added some dried thyme which complimented the soft cheeses. The key is thinnly sliced potatoes, It was cooked through with a golden brown top in less than 50mins. Really delicious!

This is a very good recipe. The goat cheese blends to well with the cream and it is just delicious. The goat cheese is not overpowering at all. In fact most people do not even realize that there is goat cheese in the recipe. Wonderful.

I used extra garlic and added a lot of rosemary. I also used 1 pint of half and half instead of whole milk and whipping cream. I put most of the potatoes in the food processor to slice them quickly, but I hand-sliced the ones for the top so they would look nicer. I left the leftovers at my friends' house, and she and her boyfriend fought over them the next day.

One of the best potato gratins I've ever made. The goat cheese is a delicious change of pace. I crumbled it by hand into the milk/cream mixture and stirred with a wire whisk for a minute, breaking up any large chunks, and it incorporated nicely. The consistency of the dish was perfect and the taste delicious. The only change I made was to add a few more cloves of garlic. I'll definitely put this in with my favorite standbys. It is a quick and simple dish to make. And you can assemble it ahead of time and store in the fridge until time to bake.

loved it! so so good, made it for my 1st wedding anniversary dinner and was not disappointed. have made it a couple of different ways now, and to the reviewer asking if it could be lightened up, i used 1% milk as opposed to whole milk and that worked fine with the whipped cream, but when i used half and half instead of whipping cream with the 1% milk, it was way too watery. the taste is better with the whipped cream too, so i'd keep it. also, i'm greek and love garlic, so i used 3-4 cloves of garlic. there's also no need to peel the potatoes. just make sure you really blend together the cream, milk and cheese well.

Please be honest with me here: is there any way to lighten this up a bit without totally ruining the dish? The amount of cream is staggering, but I'd also rather make something great and decadent than lousy & lowfat. Thanks for the tips! SFChef

Followed the recipe exactly aside from adding one extra clove of garlic. The taste was very nice but I didn't like the consistency of the liquid that remained after cooking or the fact that there was so much liquid in the first place. I combined the ingredients using an immersion blender and everything was thick and creamy, so I'm not quite sure what happened. Perhaps it's the type of potatoes available here in Belgium? No Yukon golds, though the potato I used was nicely cooked through -- maybe not as absorbent as Yukons?

Rating: 3
Actually, for ease this should probably get 4 forks. Didn't bother to peel them and used the immersion blender as another reviewer suggested to mix up the milk and cheese. Excellent. My kids, who would normally turn up their noses at goat cheese, devoured it. My husband loved it. Definitely worth doing again and again.

Rating: 4
To the cook who had trouble with the goat cheese crumbles: even with whisking, I still had larger pieces of goat cheese in my cream mixture. I used the whisk to push the goat cheese chunks through a slotted spoon and that reduced the cheese to pea-sized and smaller bits. Good quality goat cheese should provide adequate flavor in this recipe as written.

Simply delicious!! My family who is picky about trying anything out of the ordinary loved these for Easter dinner. They didn't even know it was goat cheese until I told them...smoothy, rich, & creamy. I substituted the whole milk with half&half. And caution - do not double recipe and then divide up into two dishes - the ingredients don't divide up well - the one was really creamy, the other pan extremely dry. A darn good potato recipe, better than the normal gratin.. will make again.

You would not believe what happened! Timing was perfect on prep -- then the oven didn't work. AACCK! I do not know what happened, but it simply decided to wig out. I transferred as much as I could to a smaller dish that would fit in the microwave, didn't worry about how thick it was, so it ended up being about 2/3 as much as before (had to toss the rest, how sad). Nuked it at 60% for 8 min or so, then let it sit a while. About 15 min before guests were supposed to arrive, I tried the oven again, and it worked!! So I stuck the pan into the oven at 400 and it was crispy on the top, everything was soaked in as it was supposed to, it was perfect. I'm going to make this again, but I'm afraid to make it how it's supposed to be made, as it turned out so well the first time!!

Rating: 4
Wonderful! The only things I changed were to increase the garlic to 3 cloves and to not peel the potatoes. Not peeling the potatoes gives the dish a more rustic look, so if I were planning on serving this dish at an elegant dinner, I would peel. I blend the milk/cream, goat cheese, and seasonings in a 4 cup measuring cup with my immersion blender. No waiting for the goat cheese to warm up and no tiresome whisking. As a variation, I have also used russet potatoes with great results, and have layered leftover holiday ham slices over the bottom and middle potato layers -- a wonderful way to use up leftover ham!

Rating: 4
This recipe is PERFECT. The only thing I changed was doubling the amount of garlic, but I'm a garlicaholic. I served it for a dinner party for my fiance's birthday. I didn't tell some of my family that there was goat cheese in it, or they wouldn't have touched it. Picky, picky. However, they devoured every single bite - no leftovers. I'm making it again tonight for Christmas dinner.

I have made this dish many times, exactally as written and received raves every time! One tip on incorporating the goat cheese: Don't try and crumble it, you'll end up with a glob. I let it sit out till room temp, then with a wire wisk, mix a little milk, a litle goat cheese, etc. till smooth, then wisk in the remaining milk and cream. I have also used russet potatoes with the same delicious results. I usually baste the top of the potatoes with the cream mixture that bubbles around the edges a couple of times while baking. This recipe is easy and really great with grilled meat!

My husband and kids have become seasoned 'Epicurious guinea pigs' since I try a new recipe from this site at least once a week. Usually I can count on success if there are as many rave reviews as this recipe received. In this case, however, I was really surprised and disappointed. I love goat cheese, but I sure didn't care for it with these potatoes. I did double the garlic, added some parmesan, and it came out looking absolutely yummy, just didn't care for the taste at all. I couldn't find montrachet, though, and I'm wondering about all the recipes I see that call for 'crumbled' goat cheese. How in the heck do you crumble it??!! It's like trying to crumble cream cheese, half of it remains on your hands, the rest are just blobs that attempt to re-connect to each other! Maybe the montrachet has a different texture. Anyway, I think the cook who suggested using gruyere might be on to something. That sounds terrific. Until then I will stick with my Mom's parmesan scalloped potatoes.

This is a stable. I've always used all whole milk, and whatever potatoes are in the cupboard. It's always won the crowd over. My preference is for fresh feta, but it works with a sharp cheddar as well. A marvelous basic recipe to expand upon.

I found this to be a very quick and easy recipe to make, and a great side to a roast. Though very tasty, I would probably cut back the amount of goat cheese used (down to 1/2-3/4 cup). The full amount is so strong tasting that it cuts out the rest of the natural flavours in the garlic and potatoes.

I have made this twice, both times substituting 2% milk or a mixture of half and half and 1% for the whole milk. I have used gruyere both times as well. This is an excellent dish.

A big hit that I've made 3 times in the past month! I've used roasted garlic instead of raw and mash it up in the goat cheese. Last night I layered the potatoes with leftover honey-baked ham - yum. Have used Parmigiano-Reggiano and other cheeses on top. A great winter dish. Delicious.

AMAZING! I made this for Xmas Eve dinner to go with a marinated pork tenderloin roast.

I will definately keep this recipe on hand - it was easy and delicious!

This is an incredible dish. Have made it twice. The first time I par boiled the potatoes in a lrg. fry pan with just enough water to cover the potatoes, just long enough to soften, even though I sliced them thin. The second time I used a slicer, peeled them very thin, added two cloves of garlic and 1/4 t. of nutmeg. Both times I took the advice of one of the previous reviews and covered them for the first 40 minutes with tin foil (vented), removed the foil and finished cooking. I really think this step is necessary. What a wonderful dish. My family loved it. Will definately make it again and again.

Cooking note - bake on a cookie sheet covered in foil for easier clean up. I baked mine in a small oval Apilco dish which looks nice on the table right out of the oven. Will definitely make again. Could do some nice variations with this recipe. Served with lavender and thyme roasted Cornish hens, roasted asparagus and lemon souffles for dessert.

This is my idea of the perfect recipe; easy to make and very good! As I had some button mushrooms in the `fridge (half-a-cup, chopped fine), I added those, and it was a delight. We also tried it with feta instead of goat cheese. That's okay, but not as good. Those who got raw potatoes might want to consider using a 13x9 pyrex, so that it isn't filled as deeply as in the suggested vessel.

I've gotten rave reviews every time I've made this recipe...I think the key is using 10 cloves of garlic (how the heck could you use 1 clove of garlic in a potato dish?) I highly recommend using a mandolin to slice the potatoes, half the time and twice as thin. Heavenly...(and this was without Yukons)

I have made this dish several times in the past year. However, I have made one important substitution, crumbled blue cheese instead of goat cheese. My whole family loves it, and cannot get enough of it. Use thinly sliced Yukon Golds (they are much easier to slice anyway because of their softer texture).

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe would be okay but it came out GREAT! The Yukon potatoes had a wonderful butter flavor and the nutmet complimented it all. I'm not a huge fan of nutmeg so it was really hard for me to put it in but I'm very glad I did.

I found this recipe delicious, and so have my guests on the two occassions that I've made it. I also think the trick is to slice the potatoes very thinly (I used a slicer). I didn't use Yukon Gold potatoes (hard to find in P.R.), and it still came out great.

This recipe makes an excellent potato dish. It is an easy recipe that I have made several times with excellent results.

This dish looked awful but tasted wonderful! I found that most of the liquid evaporated during cooking, so the top potatoes got a little dried out. The flavor was great, though--rich and complex. That little bit of nutmeg makes a big difference!

Awesome! Was so easy and actually fun to make. Flavor was very rich, I made it with Pork Tenderloin. Great compliment. Will definitely make it again.

EASY! Not only was this dish an inexpensive side and took no time to make, it tasted wonderful. I dont know why everyone is tripping about the nutmeg, you cannot taste it, and I picked a mild goat cheese. I did not peel the potatoes, like others, i decided if you are slicing them so thin, why bother? I will definitely be making this again.

I made this as a side for the Parmesan Chicken, and it was so good we had the whole meal again 3 days later. Minor notes: 1) Why peel yukon golds? Thin slices + thin skin = no peeling. 2) I found the goat cheese to be subtle enough to serve with almost anything. I would not halve it until you've tried the full portion. 3) You may not be a fan of nutmeg, but g-cheese and potatoes and cream are all big, big nutmeg fans. The whole thing does not taste like n-meg at all. You should give it a chance. This recipe is damn near perfect, as is.

This dish was OK, but the goat cheese was definately the predominate flavor. We had it with lobster & it was way too rich for that. If I made it again I'd double the garlic and maybe decrease the goat cheese.

WOW. This is a fabulous potato dish!! I made this for a dinner party for tomorrow night and have not been able to stop sampling. I doubled the recipe with no problem and incorporated other folks feedback by doing the following: Doubled the garlic, used herbed goat cheese, added thinly sliced onions between layers and added a light coating of parmesan cheese between layers as well. VERY GOOD and SUPER EASY.

I haven't actually made this recipe, but wanted to point out that adding nutmeg brings out the flavors in a dish like salt does. With only 1/8 teaspoon required for this recipe..why not try it some time? You'd be surprised!

Like the other Upstate NY cook, I omitted the nutmeg but added a bit of fresh rosemary. This was absolutely fabulous with lamb.

Rather than cream + milk, we used half-n-half and we also used plain old baking potatoes. Super simple to make and we thought it tasted great. We made a half batch and it came out just fine. We liked the pepper punch. Next time we may try it with herbed goat cheese.

Making it for the second time, since it was a big hit with a large dinner party the first time. Refreshing change from heavier au gratins, which is nice in Arizona. It's a nice way to introduce neophytes to goat cheese.

Wasn't the best scallopped potatoes I have ever tasted. Cheese was a little bland and a little too milky. I followed the recipe very closely and no one in my house was impressed. We alll aggreed that the "Scallopped potatoes with three cheeses" recipe from this site was far better and definitely tastier!

Rating: 4
The first time I made this recipe, I thought it was good, but there was too much black pepper. The second time, I cut it back to 1/2 teasp, which was still a bit too much for me. Otherwise, this had great flavor. I used 3 cloves of garlic and used and 8x8 pan for a single recipe and a 13x9 for a double recipe with no problems. My father couldn't stop raving about it. Make sure you like goat cheese, though, or you'll be wasting your time!

Rating: 4
This was very good! I cut the recipe in half and it worked out fine. There were enough for three. The goat cheese makes this side a step up from the average!

I made this once as-is and got no comments, but last time I changed it slightly and got "wow"s. Instead of mincing the garlic, I smashed about three cloves and put in a saucepan w/the milk, cream and goat cheese over low heat for 10 minutes. Then I pulled out the garlic and proceeded as per the recipe. Fantastic! This will be a staple recipe for dinner parties.

I have made this recipe many times and always get rave reviews, more so than any gratin dish I've made. I do add a bit more garlic.

My dinner guests raved about this one. I used 4 oz goat cheese and about a cup of shredded gruyere. I also added a finely chopped shallot. The flavor was excellent. I will make this one again.

Served this at Easter and it was a hit!! Family really enjoyed it. If you enjoy goat cheese this is a great dish. Just need to watch cooking time...my oven must be extra hot as edges got a little brown...but infact was extra tasty in its crunchyness!!!

Rating: 1
Not that impressed. However, the Gruyere suggestion sounds like a good one.

Rating: 4
An excellent recipe! I added my own twist--instead of the goat cheese or the parmesan suggested by other cooks, I used 2 cups of grated gruyere cheese and extra garlic. Along with steamed fresh asparagus, it made a great springtime dinner!

Rating: 4
This dish was a definite winner and I'm so glad that I tried it! I think it's pretty fool-proof and I doubled it without any problems. I took a few suggestions from other viewers - first, I whisked together the cheese and cream and didn't haven't a problem w/ clumping. I also added VERY thinly sliced onion. I also ended up using red potatoes and I didn't peel them. Delicious!!

Rating: 2
This was a good dish, but very rich. (Not surprising, considering the ingredients). I used goat's cheese flavored with Fine Herbs and an extra small clove of garlic to give the potatoes a boost. Cooking the dish for an hour and fifteen minutes may seem like a long time, but I guess it really does take that amount of time for the potatoes to become tender. If the top browns too fast, cover it with foil. Next time I'll be sure to crumble the cheese into very small bits and I may mix in some fresh chives with the milk. Overall, very easy, with tasty results.

Rating: 4
Yum yum is all I can say. Perfect! I followed the recipe as stated and it was perfect. A friend attempted to make ahead and used a different potato didn't have success. Not sure if that was why. But me, I am looking for a reason to make again. Beware though, it is on the rich side.

Rating: 3
This was fantastic! I doubled the garlic (but be careful, the garlic goes along way in this dish)and did as someone suggested, baked under the broiler for the last 5 to minutes. Complete crowd pleaser. Will certainly make again.

Rating: 2
This was good, but didn't knock my socks off. I added half of an onion, sliced thin, into the layers and couldn't imagine the dish without it. I also didn't peel the Yukon Golds. Like others, I used the herb & garlic montrachet and added and extra clove of garlic. I still felt it just didn't have "punch". I don't know. I probably won't bother w/ it again as their are too many other fabulous recipes on Epicurious.

I made this for Easter dinner with rack of lamb and fresh asparagus. Without any changes to the recipe, it was incredible! My husband pronounced it the best potato gratin I've made. My kids both ate! (my daughter said it tasted like pasta with alfredo sauce!) Definitely a repeat. I don't think I'd do onions, but I may increase the garlic slightly, and try variants on the goat cheese (herb etc.)

Rating: 3
I'm always trying new gratin recipes and this one was great. I doubled the garlic and put it under the broiler briefly to extra-crisp the top. By the way, who is this oddball "graduating from dishwasher etc.", who gives the same review to lots of different recipes? If you don't have something constructive to say, why bother?

Rating: 3
This was wonderful! Next time I make it I shall add onions as one suggested, but it was delicious as it was! I shall, indeed, prepare this dish again.

Rating: 4
Show stopper! Everyone raved at Easter dinner-made with the following additions: between each layer, I added thin sweet onion slices, Parmesan, and a touch of fresh parsley. The goat cheese mellowed out beautifully. I would recommend using a mandoline for slicing...made a better presentation. We served it alongside lamb and asparagus...perfect.

Rating: 4
Made this _exactly_ as is except doubled the garlic and used garlic-herb goat cheese and a sprinkling of parmesean over the top. I don't know what everyone is complaining about the presentation for--I think it looked like the excellent potatos au gratin that it is. everyone loved it next to the leg of lamb at Easter, and I would make it again for any holiday.

Rating: 3
For Easter Buffet, excellent, loved by all. Ended up using Boursin cheese; the market was out of goat.(Picked Boursin because it was garlicky.) Added onion and parmesan between layers. Well, it looked awful upon presentation. So, I stirred it, and all was fine. Definitely, will do this again.

Very good, but a little too rich for my taste. I layered it with onions, which added a nice flavor. I had a few bites, and that was enough for me.

I avoided the goat cheese from clumping by beating the goat cheese and milk (instead of cream) with a hand blender. Added gruyere cheese inbetween layers.

I made this recipe several weeks ago before all the comments came in. We loved it! Now that I read the comments I will add more garlic and parmesan. I did add onion to mine. In small town Wyoming we have choice of red or white potatoes. Couldn't find Yukon Gold, but they were great anyway. This is a keeper.

Both my fiancee and I really enjoyed this dish. I took everyone's suggestion and doubled the garlic and also used Goat's cheese flavored with garlic. I also took the other suggestion and sprinkled parmesan and parsley on top - definitely made a better presentation. I would make this again - very flavorful!

I too doubled the garlic, and also followed the suggestion of topping this with a generous sprinkling of fresh grated parmesean cheese. To compensate for the bland coloring, I sprinkled parsley on top. All the guests loved it ....I can't wait to try it with lamb!

This is a great recipe, not bland like so many I have tried. It is important, however, to use a good, flavorful goat cheese. I made it with pork chops but think it would be fabulous with lamb.

It seems that I am in the minority, but I really was not that impressed with this potato gratin. I have made a number of others on the site which were a lot better. I thought that it was rather bland and that the presentation wasnt great either. I followed the recipe exactly except for doubling the garlic. I would not make again.

I'd definitely make these again. I'm not a huge scalloped potatoes fan, but these were great!

Delicious and easy to make. I used Boursin cheese instead of Goat which perhaps made it a bit blander than it should have been. Still, it was excellent.

More please!!! These were by far THE best au gratin potatoes I have ever had. And so easy to make. I made them for a quick family dinner and got rave reviews. I can't wait to make them for company. I don't see how anyone could say this was a bland dish. I was so surprised by the pungent flavor of the goat cheese (I used plain, precrumbled "Athenos" brand Feta) along with the mellow Yukon potatoes. I did take the advice of another chef and used two cups of half and half instead of the heavy cream and whole milk. A wonderful addition to any meat dish.

Rating: 4
I didn't expect this recipe to be very flavorful. Afterall, how much flavor can potatoes, dairy products, salt, pepper, and nutmeg produce? I tried it anyway because it had so many great reviews. I'm so glad I did! The nutmeg and goat cheese are a wonderful reunion. The flavor was creamy and rich with a hint of a wonderful "mystery" spice. Also, it came out looking exactly like the picture. I've never had that happen before with other recipes. My husband really dislikes scalloped potatoes due to having them everynight growing up. It's the one dish he's requested I not make. I was so surprised when he said he really liked this recipe and requested I make it again!

This is a delicious and easy dish. I used extra garlic, and garlic & herb flavored chevre. Both to great success. Another tip for speeding cooking time, cook at 450 for 30 minutes, then reduce to 400 and watch for the browning. I did this on accident, and it still turned out wonderful.

This recipe is absolutely the best au-gratin dish I have ever had. Full of flavor!!! Please don't miss out on this wonderful dish.

I made this recipe when it first came out, and it was one of the best potato recipes that I've ever made. The only adjustments that I made were using evaporated milk and 2% milk in place of the cream and the whole milk, and I sprinkled the top with parmesean cheese. Also, since I was running short on time, I zapped them in the microwave for 7 min on high and then baked them for about 20-25 min. Nothing was lost with these changes!

I really liked the simplicity of this dish. I have another recipe just like it, except cured olives are added. A nice touch. Here I used 2 cups half-and-half, warmed up on the stove to which I added 8 ozs. goat cheese. Sliced the yukon golds on a mandoline, and layered per directions. Baked half-way earlier in the day, and popped back in the oven for 30 minutes and let rest for 10 before serving. Perfect with leg of lamb and brocolli rapinni.
