I let myself feel a little guilty for not marinating longer as the reviews suggested and I'm kind of glad I didn't. I paired this steak with the spicy/sweet cabbage recommended. The cabbage had such a tang and punch that I think if the meat were also strong it would be too much. I enjoyed aromatic coriander with the beef flavor (not a teriyaki flavor) mixed with tangy cabbage. Just do it! Don't put it off!

We make this every couple of weeks. Sometimes more often. Only a couple changes. - Definitely marinade for longer. At least a couple hours, preferably 4 or 6. - Use a little more ginger, a lot more coriander, and more soy. I use a light, reduced-sodium soy for this and can't tell the difference. - Pre-heat a large skillet in your broiler/oven. Put the meat AND THE MARINADE in the skillet when you broil it. I usually do just over 4 minutes each side for a rare steak. - I recommend using grass-fed beef in general, but especially for something like this. Doesn't need to be organic...just grass-fed! Done well, it's very juicy and very flavorful and probably the most bang for your buck and your time you'll get out of a flank steak. Not overcooking it and cooking it in the marinade are the keys though!

I've made this recipe more times than I can count. Fantastic flavor for not a ton of effort. For extra kick let it marinade longer, even for a day!

For me this was just ok. Not tons of flavor. I followed exactly and nobody at my dinner party was raving or really eating it. Oh well.

This is the easiest recipe and very flavorful for the time alloted for marinading it. I wasn't a believer and let it sit in the marinade for about an hour at room temp. The steak was wonderful and I cannot wait to do it again and again and again!!

Had many ohhs and ahhs after serving this last night for a BBQ. The flavors really worked together. I had no coriander seeds, so I used ground coriander instead. I also doubled the recipe, and it all worked. I have to say I think the fresh cilantro and marinating it for 2 days probably helped. Will make it again for sure!!!!

This is a terrific recipe. Easy and quick to prepare with delicious results, makes it four forks in my book. Will definitely make it again and will try the slaw recipe next time.

this was a quick, excellent steak meal for a weeknight dinner. i had trouble believing that there would be much flavor from such a short marinade but it worked! i would definitely make this again - soon!

This recipe never fails! It is a great dish for entertaining as well as for a family meal. Use any leftover flank steak (if there is any!) for Beef Barley Soup. The flavors of the marinaded meat really add something special to the soup. Best recipe for flank steak evah!

This recipe never fails. It is so delicious! I throw everything into a Ziploc bag, let marinate for a few hours and then fire up the grill. YUM!

I've made many of the teriyaki marinade recipes on this site, and this is by far my favorite for steak. I've made it as written, but now I prefer to add the ground coriander seeds and fresh cilantro to the marinade. FRESH cilantro and FRESHLY GROUND coriander seeds put this one over the top!!!

This is a truly great recipe. I used skirt steak (different from flank) and marinated it for two hours. It was tender and flavorful. The sauce is very easy to make, but the amount does need to be at least doubled. I also think toasting the coriander seeds make a difference. Incredible!

Incredibly easy and delicious. The market didn't have flank steak so I used a sirloin roast instead. I marinated the meat for a few hours, and added a lot more garlic than the recipe calls for. I doubled the marinade sauce, and wish now that I had made more. Doubling the sauce is great for the marinade, but I would have liked to have reserved some to dip the meat into while eating, or having extra to put over the fried rice I made as the staple. I also made sesame green beans, and the combination with the steak was fantastic! My boyfriend couldn't stop talking about it.

This kicked ass. Quick, delicious and I am a cilantro lover. Threw some EVOO brushed mushrooms onto the broil pan and served with rice!

I cooked this on the grill and served it with a stir-fry of broccoli, carrot, red pepper, onion and bean sprouts. My card club all asked for the recipe.

This dish smelled as good as it looked and tasted. For a slightly different taste, try using fresh chives instead of coliander. I didn't have a choice, I couldn't find coliander. It tasted fantastic.

So quick and easy! Great flavor! Definitely heat the pan up to ensure a nice sear on the beef.

This smells like your hair after a workout? Yum! Can you send me samples of your hair in a plastic Baggie? My address is: Joan Rivers, 45 East 74th Street, New York, NY 10021. Thanks in advance.

Wonderful flavors: pungent, unusual, complimentary. I added extra garlic and used sirloin instead (no flank at the market) and marinated it longer. Halfway through, I pounded it out and let it marinate longer, letting the flavors really get in there. I grilled it and served it with white rice (to balance the pungency), and tempura vegetables. Miso soup to start, a cold cucumber salad to end...a real treat .

Best flank steak recipe from this site. Only change was I roasted the seeds before I ground them. Excellent!

definite keeper. i loved this recipe. it was fast, easy, and absolutely delicious. i did forget to sprinkle the cilantro after slicing the steak and it would have enhanced the flavor, but even without this ingredient the steak was incredible. as recommended i prepared hot and sour cabbage salad to supplement the steak. what a great combination. very intense flavors. i will definitely add this to my favorites.

This is fantastic. This was made for dinner during our last vacation. Too much was made and the next morning we substituted the flank steak for canadian bacon in our eggs benedict. The friends we vacationed with are still raving about it - the dinner and the breakfast.

The coriander seed made this dish quite interesting. I used powder ginger instead of fresh because I didn't have any on hand. The fresh would have make it exceptional. I also did not use the cilantro...I love it/husband hates it! Next time, I will add more garlic too

This dish was delicious!!! I am definitely going to make it again! It was so simple and easy to make for dinner! My fiance and I ate it without the cilantro and it was good!

Made this for a girlfriend's husband's work get-together (got that?) at their home. We ate this as skewered appetizers along with some coconut shrimp. Good thing --- her husband charred the meat, but I made so much of the appetizers it was easy for everyone to pretend they didn't notice the carcinogen meat and act too full to eat much more once dinner rolled around! My girlfriend was so grateful!

This is a wonderful marinade! I used it with steak tips and also I used it with chicken. Both came out delish! Simple and easy too! I didn't have any coriander seeds on hand so I just used a bit more fresh cilantro and still had great results. I also added one more clove of garlic.

No flank steak available, so I used skirt steak. Very yummy. The cilantro is essential.

My boyfriend and I made this recipe and really liked it. It's a great marinade and gives a really strong flavor even after marinating for only 10 minutes. I added a few extra garlic cloves, and a little more corriander than it called for -- also through in some whole corriander seeds like someone else suggested. A great recipe, and you can't mess it up.

Great marinade--the flavors come together well. I let the flank steak marinate for 4 hours and grilled it to medium rare. Grilled vegies and wild rice on the side. Probably the most tender flank steak we've ever had and I use flank steak often. Don't skip the cilantro.

I really liked the marinade, but I didn't like the flank steak. Next time, I think I will use the same marinade, but with regular steaks.

I triple this marinade and marinade it overnite and let it soak in....I also add a lot more garlic and use ground coriander instead of seeds...THIS IS PHENOMENAL! Everyone raves about it...you can eat it with plain rive and veggies or with roasted peppers, onion and fresh avocados as fajitas...IT IS DELICIOUS!

This was phenomenal! Didn't have the ginger so I left it out -- will try it next time. Delicious even without it. Quick and easy weekday meal that has a lot of flavor. Since it's summer, I put it with the Apple and Celery Salad on epicurious -- it was a great match.

An easy, quick and flavorful recipe. Next time, I think I'll double all the ingredients, other than the coriander seed, to achieve a bit more moisture.

Our best, all-around flank steak recipe. I put the coriander seeds in a plastic bag and crush them with something heavy. That way you get pieces of all sizes. Yum.

I've made this twice now, once on the broiler and once on the grill. It is fabulous. I feel I now have a quality steak recipe that would impress any guest. The marinade is tasty and the coriander seeds add just the right touch. The first time I served it with a cabbage slaw similar to the one listed, just rice vinegar and black and red pepper. Excellent accompaniment. It was just as good on the grill as well. This one is a big hit in our house.

Lots of terrific flavor packed into this few-minute marinade. Will leave it longer next time. The coriander sprinkling made it even more tasty. A great addition to the file for easy yet flavorful dinners. A definite make-again.

I minced both the garlic and the ginger and was very happy with the crunchy carmelized bits that coated the steak. Felt that the cooking time was too long for medium rare so I reduced to three minutes per side and it was still too cooked for our taste. Also used ground coriander and would try with crushed coriander next time. Think this marinade would be great on anything.

A surprisingly flavorful preparation for flank steak. I had flank steak in the freezer that I wanted to use, saw this recipe and thought I'd give it a try. Although it has great ingredients, you wouldn't think marinating for 10 minutes would give it much flavor. Very simple preparation (I used ground coriander), quick (I grilled it), AND excellent flavor - good enough for company.
