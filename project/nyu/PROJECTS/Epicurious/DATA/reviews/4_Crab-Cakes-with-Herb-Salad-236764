This is the first review I've ever done and I felt compelled to enthusiastically rate this recipe as superb! These cakes are so delicious, in large part due to the fresh lemon, herbs, and greens. I served them without the vinaigrette or any other sauce and they are so flavorful on their own I don't think they need anything more. I used fresh locally caught Dungeness crab, which I'm sure helped the flavor. My husband picked the crab while I made the cake mix. We made them the night before our party so it was great to be able to get this out of the way ahead of time, because it is time-consuming. But so worth it! I used fresh cilantro but the other herbs weren't available fresh so I used dried dill and tarragon (used about a 1/4 of the amount of dried that's called for). I think I ended up using less lemon peel than called for but they were still quite lemony. I doubled the recipe and ended up with 30 delicious cakes.

Delicious and relatively easy. I loved the fresh flavors and the fact that nothing overpowered the crab taste.

These are perfect. I did The recipe exactly. I used about a 2 1/2 inch round form and packed them tightly then let them rest 2 hours. Fried carefully and they came out really beautiful. The dressing was great both on the salad and the crab cakes. Definitely a keeper and a company item! Loved the balance of herbs.

Delicious! I used saltine crackers in the crab mixture, I liked crackers better than Panko and it is certainly less expensive. I love tarragon, but next time I will use half as much. I felt the tarragon over-powered the taste.

Too herbal. Overpowers the crab. I'll try a different recipe next time.

Very tasty but even with adding more mayo and the egg whites they completely fell apart. Although I did get rave reviews from guests I was disappointed with the presentation because they didn't stay together.

These are probably the best crab cakes ever. While I am sure they are good enough as is, we had no lemons so substituted limes, added a little celery for texture and ancho for smokey heat. Yum! Agree with the use of grapeseed oil. Wow! Enjoyed them in a sandwich the next day. Have more stored in the freezer for next week, if they last that long.

I thought these were quite tasty! Really loved the combination of the three herbs. I made a different salad so didn't bother making the vinaigrette portion of the recipe and reading some of the reviews it doesn't sound like I was missing out on anything.

First time making crab cakes and they were the best I've ever tasted. Despite not being a dill lover I found all three herbs were essential. I used regular bread crumbs and didn't have time to let mine sit, but they still turned out great. The dressing was excellent. Can't wait to make these again!

Four forks is right! My wife is from NOLA, so I was a bit nervous about my first attempt to make crab cakes for her. These really impressed! Next time, I will add another 6oz or so of crab meat. I like them more meaty, although these are not bready in the slightest. The panko, when cooked in high enough heat (grapeseed oil is a must!), lends to a crispness that regular breadcrumbs and low-heat cooking cannot achieve. Get the best crab you can find; the cheap stuff won't do them justice. The fresh herbs and lemon zest give these a depth of flavor I found to be sophisticated but not in a way that tastes like they're trying too hard to be fancy. Crab cakes can be boring; these are not!

this was my first attempt at crab cakes and at first the fresh crab seemed daunting but they were SO worth it. the crab cakes were DELICIOUS! i used an extra egg yolk like others suggested and they were perfect!

Made this for thanksgiving because we tried to mix things up a bit. We don't do Christmas...so that's that. Woa, what a hit! I followed the recipe on all counts except for the grape-seed oil, which I subbed out for plain old conola.

Reviewing crab cakes only, as I served with a regular tossed salad and french bread for a light dinner. These were delicious. I love crab cakes where the flavor of the crab really shines through, without masking from heavy spices (I know Old Bay makes the crabcakes for some, but for me the spice just masks the flavor). These were all crab, just barely held together by the perfect amount of "filler," with the lovely sweet crab flavor at the forefront. My grocery did not have tarragon, and I don't care for dill, so I left those out and instead used two Tbs finely minced onion and extra cilantro and scallion. I think that the tarragon would have been fabulous, but I probably won't worry about the dill next time. I whipped up a lemon-caper mayo sauce to go alongside, and that was a nice accompaniment. Even my children liked these flavorful crab cakes!

Loved these crab cakes. They are very light and fresh tasting. Served these for a light Easter dinner (followed by an enormous heavy breakfast earlier that day.) I baked these instead of pan frying. I brushed the cookie sheet lightly with the grapeseed oil and baked on the top shelf until golden on each side. The herb salad alone would not be very good but it is perfectly paired with the crab cakes. Placed them next to bright red fresh strawberries. Beautiful and Springy!

Really good recipe but still needed a bit of tinkering. I took the advice of other reviewers and used two whole eggs (the eggs I used were on the small side). Other people have said it was a touch bland so I doubled the amount of lemon zest, added some finely chopped ginger, some scallions (in addition to the green onions) and a little bit of chopped red & yellow peppers and thought the end result was wonderful. I didn't care at all for the vinaigrette they suggest for the side salad but the crab cakes are some of the best I've tried.

I didn't have fresh herbs except cilantro and used regular bread crumbs. My big twist was I used canned CHICKEN instead of crab since that's what I had on hand. My family loved it!! Can't wait to try it with crab.

These crabcakes are excellent. I made them once with expensive, canned crab and once with a lower priced crab. Since they do take a lot of time to prepare, I suggest splurging on really good crab, because I could certainly taste the difference. I formed mine in a pastry cutter and packed it tightly so they kept a clean, round shape and made it easier to fry. The salad was a perfect accompaniment. I added some fresh avacado and served it with lemon wedges-a perfect brunch meal!

Didn't have many of the ingredients, so made some switches. Used the canned crab that is refrigerated, from Trader Joes. Like other reviewers, I just used a whole egg. Didn't have cilantro, or fresh dill or tarragon so I used them dried cutting them back like you should. Small amount of the dill since it was ground. Had only 1 c. of panko, so used breadcrumbs for the tray, about 1/2 to 3/4 c. Didn't have the scallions, so I used finely chopped purple onion. Added just a bit more mayonnaise and didn't wait the 1 hour to chill, just cooked them in a skillet. Didn't make the salad. Hubby loved them. Served them with brown rice and some Delicata squash. So good! Will make again, for sure.

These were amazing. Used herbs from the garden, skipped the tarragon because I don't particularly like it. Went straight from the recipe and they were absolutely fabulous. Served w/ brown rice, which is great with a little of the vinaigrette mixed in. My 9 year old said he thought we should have this for Christmas, it was so good. I will never buy store-made crabcakes again.

I think these lacked gusto. I even let them sit for 24 hours. Next time would add red pepper flakes and more lemon juice.

I've never been really into crab cakes since they are often too greasy and have way to much mayo - but, this was fabulous! I made just half of the recipe for my husband and I and used 1 whole egg and whole wheat panko bread crumbs. The whole wheat crumbs gave it that excellent nutty flavor. Next time I make this, I'll go ahead and add the proper amount of lemon zest (I held back a little on that), and will probably make them bigger. The herbs right out of my garden fit perfectly into this dish!

Absolutely SUPER crab cakes. I actually haven't served them with salad & dressing. Costco has 1 lb. cans of great crab. It is so easy that I double the recipe, which makes about 18 1/3 c. patties, and press into panko. I put all together on cookie sheet, freeze and then bag into ziplock freezer bags. Serve 2-3 per person at dinner. WONDERFUL!!

I followed the recipe exactly then added corn and tomatoes to the salad and some homemade cyanne tartar sauce for those who like dip. So delicious and perfect for a hot summer day!

I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and added 2 whole eggs instead of just the yolks. They came out great! Held together well during cooking. Light, flaky, loved the lemony zing. I didn't have any tarragon, so subbed some fresh parsley. Best crab cake recipe I've tried to date!

Rating: 4
Simple but very good recipe. I substituted 1/2 cup panko for the bread and the cakes were not bready and held together perfectly. I would accompany these cakes with a relish of grilled corn/tomato/roasted Anaheim pepper with fresh lime juice and cilantro to spice it up a bit.

FANTASTIC! And the recipe was actually pretty simple. The entire plate was gone in 10 minutes. Like other reviews, the mixture was a bit crumbly, I added another whole egg, and it was perfect. Light and so flavorful!

Been looking for this recipe for a long time. Finally, we can have good crab cakes at home. Yay! For just two of us, I only needed half the recipe, but had two egg yolks in the fridge and I used them both. No problems at all with the cakes falling apart.

Delicious! I did not have panko so I used cornflake crumbs which added a very nice flavour and crunch. Didn't find that the mixture held together at first so I added the egg whites. Fast, easy, and delicious!

Only made the crab cakes, which were good. I only used tarragon and dill, but found the dill a bit strong. Most of the cakes stayed well formed but the ones near the center of the pan fell apart a bit...Next time might add another yolk or more mayo or less panko.

We had these for Christmas dinner, what a hit. We're having a crab cake "taste off" next week for New Years Eve.. I think I have the others beat!! I thought the salad was excellent! I think the grapeseed oil was a big addition, no oily texture.

Made this for my book club and everyone loved it. It was quick and if, like me, you don't read through and skip the resting period, very fast too. They cooked up fine, but I did feel the need to add extra mayo. I will make again for sure, although at $30 per lb for crab, it will not be as often as I would like.

I've been in search of the ultimate crab cake recipe for years, trying many different variations on the theme. While this recipe doesn't take the Grand Prize, it is a definite contender. The asian notes were a welcomed addition - especially a nice touch with the three herbs accented in the accompanying salad. This is a very smart choice for lunch with friends. A crisp and very cold white wine brought it all together.

These are wonderful. Lots of crab with not too much filler. They fell apart a little bit so I may add a touch more mayo next time but overall these are amazing! Did not try the salad.

Actually if you modify this recipe just a bit it is possible to have the Perfect cab cake. I skipped the Dijon -- mustard is just too heavy for crab , I increased the sour cream appropriately. I also ditched the cilantro and put in more tarragon and dill. These two herbs are more than enough, the cilantro on its own without the other two would work well, the combination of the three is just over the top. I did not use Panko I used homemade very dry breadcrumbs. I make this as a lunch party main dish with a lovely herby salad with a simple lemon and olive oil vinaigrette instead of alll he other stuff to go with and everyone loves it.

I just love these crab cakes. I never seem to have all of the herbs fresh. The panko crumbs really make the cakes. I have made them twice, both times sans the salad. I serve them with an ersatz sauce of asian chili, shallots, sour cream and a bit of mayo. It works. My husband loves them.

These are the best crabcakes I had ever had! Everyone raves about them. I make eight regular size cakes instead of the appetizer size. I don't bother with the salad but serve them with roasted vegetables instead. I use jumbo lump crap meat from Costco or our fish market. Excellent!

Great easy recipe. I altered the herbs a bit 'cause I don't care for dill or tarragon, too sweet and pervasive. Red bell pepper, finely minced, fresh marjoram 1tbldp and the cilantro. Very light and tasty and cheaper than buying them at Whole Foods ready to go.

This might sound crazy, but I made this as a crab salad. It's been too hot to make crab cakes but will do so next time! And now I have a good crab salad recipe now as well. While I saw the other crab salad recipes on epicurious, I was drawn to the herb flavors in this one and decided to modify it. My simple modification for the salad: Obviously I did not add the egg yolks and sprinkled just a tad bit (approx. 1 T) of panko for thickness and kept the rest of the recipe the same. It was delicious! One note re vinaigrette: I thought it was way too oily so I added another tablespoon of lemon juice and about another full teaspoon of Dijon mustard and it did the trick.

This review is of the herb salad, only. I have limited experience with shellfish combinations, but I have been looking for suitable accompaniment for crab cakes. For the vinaigrette, I substituted sesame oil & dusted the salad with sesame seeds. The combination was perfect (I served the salad with the Louisiana Crab Cake recipe). It was a light, wonderful lunch suitable for a discriminating palate.

These were the best crab cakes ever! The FRESH herbs, and premium lump crabmeat are key. I actually used this crab cake recipe, but substituted this vinaigrette with the Lemon Vinaigrette in the Crab Cakes and Baby Greens recipe on this site. I served this for dinner and my friends just raved. It's amazing, and I will definitely make it again.

Very tasty recipe. The herbs complement the crab nicely. The binding was a bit too loose to hold together so I added several more tablespoons of mayonnaise and it worked beautifully.

This is definitely one of the best crab cake recipes ever. The fresh tarragon is absolutely key! I made these for a happy hour party for some major gourmet foodies and they all commented on how delicious these crab cakes were. I skipped the salad dressing and just mixed an herb salad w/some grapefruit vinaigrette from Trader Joes & it was a perfect hot summer evening dish. I will be throwing out all of my other crab cake recipes. A definite keeper!
