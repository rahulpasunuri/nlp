Tried twice, and it disappointed each time. Largely a one-note dish, with the bitterness of the radicchio combining unpleasantly with the acidity of the orange.

Just didn't work. The orange dressing was not going with the bitter salad-looked gorgeous, but no comments from my guests and no one wanted the recipe. Oh well, that's the beauty of this web site.

I really didnt like the dressing. My taste buds dont like the taste of dijon mustard and orange juice. My guests ate it and there were no complaints but I would use the same vegies with another dressing next time. Radicchio is expensive here and well I felt like I wasted my money.

A wonderfully delicious salad and so different! The dressing has a unique taste that blends well with the sharpness of the radicchio. If you love radicchio you will love this recipe. We do and did!
