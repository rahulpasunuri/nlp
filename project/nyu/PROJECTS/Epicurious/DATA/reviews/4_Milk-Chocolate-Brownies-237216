Great for using up Easter eggs!

Made as stated but used Muscovado dark brown sugar, 2 medium eggs and spelt flour. Didn't have a 9x9 pan so I used a 6x11 cms so I let it bake for 35 mins. Easy and delicious.

This will be my 5th time making these brownies... because of this recipe I decided to create a profile. These brownies are fit for a king,and they are so easy to make... I offered to buy my god-son a birthday cake for tomorrow but he begged me to make the milk chocolate brownies...

I'm really into healthy-ish baking right now, so I tweaked this recipe to my needs. I subbed unsweetened applesauce for the butter, cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup (packed), and I melted all the chocolate (Lindt Swiss Classic) because I didn't like the idea of chunks of chocolate in my brownies. I also added about 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, and baked it in an 8x8 pan (30 mins) because that was all I had. These brownies turned out fantastic! Moist and delicious. You would never know there was no added fat other than the chocolate! If you don't like the idea of using all that butter, definitely try subbing half or all of it for unsweetened applesauce - you'll never go back to full-fat baking!

Mmm, delicious! I used Lindt milk chocolate and it tasted just like Lindor truffles.. just more filling! I will definitely make these again!

These brownies are amazing, and very easy to make! The recipe doubles easily too. I like to use dark chocolate (60% cacao) or 50/50 milk and dark chocolate (72% cacao). Ghiradelli's chocolate is really good in them! I don't pack the brown sugar to cut back a tad on the sugar. Enjoy!!

Desperate for a late nite sweet fix, I finally sacrificed the last chocolate bunny from Easter (Dove) to make these brownies. The recipe couldn't be simpler. Not having made brownies from scratch before, I was surprised at how little flour is used. In any case, they turned out wonderfully, although I had to increase the baking time to about 33 minutes, as my pan was 8" square. Would definitely recommend using this size pan over the 9" to make a "normal" looking brownie. I found that the color was not like a blondie, as others had written. Normal looking chocolate brownie. Almost the consistency of flourless cake. This could be because I added an extra ounce or two of melted chocolate to the batter. I also added a rough chop of walnuts, a must in my opinion. It was delicious warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! One final comment, I did find that adding additional chopped milk chocolate made it just a bit too sweet and I would omit that step next time, preferring to just add a little more melted chocolate to the batter. Not a big fan of chunks of chocolate in my bakery...

These were amazingly delicious, even without any nuts as you would normally have in brownies. They had a shiny top, fudgy texture and tons of flavor. I added 1 tbsp instant coffee powder for a bit more flavor depth. Because of the milk chocolate they were sweeter than regular brownies but not overly so. I made them even more decadent by topping them with a milk chocolate ganache (6 oz. milk chocolate to 1/4 cup heavy cream) let set in fridge. I would definitly make these again and again.

OMG People!! These brownies are sick, in a good way. I used Lindt milk chocolate bars and they were to die for!! The others were right, these taste great cold out of the nfridge also. Made in an 8 x 8 pan, but they needed extra cooking time, because the center was not done. We ate these in one day and i had to make another batch the next day. I also tried them with a cream cheese swirl and they are good that way too. Definitely try it with the original recip milk choclate, it comes in 4.4 ounce bars.

A variation for the Holidays: I used a combination of semisweet and bittersweet chocolate and baked them in mini muffin pans. After 11-12 minutes in the oven I topped them with a Candy Cane Hershey's Kiss (peppermint and white chocolate) and let them bake about 1 minute more. They're a peppermint twist on the peanut blossom cookie. My family has been raving.

Loved this recipe. The bownies are delicious. I used the best chocolate and baked them a little longer then the recipe dictates. Would absolutely make these again.

The boys love these brownies there fudge and really do taste better the next day. They are allways the main request. I have used all types of chocolate milk. semi and dark. Iv used them all together and also speratelly. Doesn'T really matter its allways good.

Better than a boxed mix. I rated a 2 because they were good, not delicious. They were better than no brownies, but I wasn't wowed. My main complaint is that they were greasy. I did alter the ingredients, but not the butter, so I feel like it is ok for me to rate a 2 based on the strange greasiness... Also, when i make them again (they were good..fine, decent brownies) I will use an 8 inch brownie pan, to get a thicker brownie. I cooked for 20 minutes, that was perfect. I did, however, use ghiradelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate... that is what I had on hand and I am not a big milk chocolate fan. I also added some instant espresso powder and some cinnamon. The taste is fine. i can't wait to taste them cold.

These were light chocolate tasting, chewy brownies. I used Lindt milk chocolate couverture pieces, but as long as you use a high quality chocolate, you'll end up with good results. Next time, I would bake it in an 8 inch baking tin for a higher brownie (as opposed to the 3/4 inch ones I ended up with using a 9 inch tin). 20 minutes is the perfect time to pull them out of the oven. Let them cool to room temperature and put them in the fridge. They set up well and taste better. A cream cheese coconut frosting pairs well with these brownies as the tanginess mellows the sweet chocolate flavour.

These brownies were delicious! If you use fine quality milk chocolate, the flavour will shine through wonderfully. I wouldn't change a thing about them!

These brownies are sort of a cross between a brownie and a blondie. Great for people who aren't crazy about dark chocolate. The brown sugar gives it a carmel flavor. Other reviewers are right about reducing the cooking time. 20 minutes is plenty.

This recipe is yummy and very easy to make! I don't like overly sweet desserts, and noting what previous reviewers said I decided to cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. The brownies came out chocolate-ty, with just the right amount of sweetness (even got the thumbs-up from my husband, who doesn't like sweet desserts either). I used Ghiradelli bittersweet morsels (what I had on hand), added Jamaica Blue Mountain instant coffee and Penzey's pumpkin pie spice (cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, etc.) for depth. Baked for 20 minutes; they came out cake-y on top and gooey on the bottom. Would definitely make this recipe again!

I was asked to make an ice cream cake for a friend's birthday, and one of the requirements was that the ice cream cake include brownies. I turned to this recipe (having never tried it before), and it didn't let me down. I doubled the recipe and used four different kinds of chocolate (with varying percentages of cacao) and they turned out amazing. I also added a packet of instant espresso, which resulted in a deeper, more intense chocolate flavor without actually tasing "java-esque". Next time, I'm adding chile powder...

These were thick and fudgy and so good cold. I made them w/ cream cheese frosting as suggested by some of the other reviews, but that was too over the top for me--these are rich brownies that can stand on their own

*UPDATE* These are SO much better the next day cold! The flavor really comes out then! I was sad I had eaten so many the day before!

This was good, but I think I prefer to cook with semi-sweet or dark chocolate. It gives it more chocolate flavor I think. I had a giant milk chocolate Easter egg to use up though, so it worked perfect - and everyone liked them!

Delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I added a few drops of coffee essence. The brownies were deliciously chocolatey and moist.

Great recipe! I've tried it with semi sweet and dark chocolate. I prefer the semi....but all are quite quite tasty! Thanks for sharing!

I used ghiradelli chocolate and the flavor of these brownies are absolutely delicious. The texture is more cake-like and less chewy than I usually prefer. Also, the color is lighter and less appealing looking than most brownies, but a little powdered sugar cured that problem. Next time I might try cutting the flour a little to see if that makes them less "cakey". It's worth playing with this recipe because the flavor is delish!

Delicious! Added a swirl of cream cheese frosting and a mini-baby kiss to each after completely cooled

My wife and daughter loved this. I was so simple and easier than a box mix and tasted better too. I under cooked and it was like a molten chocolate cake. It is ashame that I can only rate this with four forks.

Sinfully rich and yes, a lovely caramelly flavor, but I like the idea to use dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate (eh, rather ruins the point, right?). They are very sweet..I don't know if I'm smart enough to figure out the proportions for lessening the sugar!

Brilliant and easy recipe. I made these for a friend who had been begging for brownies for her birthday, and they disappeared. I am a dark chocolate person, but I found the caramel note that develops in these irresistible.

Far and away the best brownie recipe I've ever made. I've used dark chocolate both times I've made them and they turned out wonderfully dense and fudgy. Basically perfect, and super easy to make !

A dark fudgey brownie lover, I was reluctant to make this until my daughter implored me to. I'm so glad she did. Fudgey in texture, the flavor oozed with milk chocolate. The top had that shiny, speckled look of perfect brownies. This didn't need any adornment. I used Guittard Milk Chocolate Chips (great flavor): half the brownies had chips, the other half didn't (family request). Both were wonderful the next day, & I don't usually like cold brownies.

Rating: 4
Adding a thick layer of cream-cheese frosting puts these over-the-top delicious. I wouldn't make them without it. I used Guittard's milk-chocolate chips, which are large. They lended a great texture to the finished product. Using semi-sweet makes them just another brownie.

Sooo not worth it! I don't usually write reviews but this recipe was rated four forks and I feel obligated to bring it down a notch. I followed the recipe exactly and was so dissapointed! The milk chocolate flavour doesn't shine. They were chewy and very sweet but lacked any specific flavour. I would not make these again.

I used semi-sweet chocolate (it's what I had) and baked it for 15 minutes for perfect gooeyness. Any longer and it would have been a cake not a brownie.

I only baked for 18 minutes, and next time will bake for a little less time. Delicious, but taste more like a good chocolate cake than like a brownie....
