This is one of the best dishes ever invented. It shows Wylie's creativity and ingenuity. It's called "Lasagna" with the parentheses for a reason. It's imperative you use all of the mushrooms. It has incredible umami. It is difficult and time-consuming. So, if you don't have the time or commitment, you should pass.

It is not lasagne, but it's really good. We called it Terra Chip Stew. The stew part came from pairing this recipe with Mushroom-Miso-Mustard Gravy. We did not add all the liqiud at the end. A delicious combination of root vegetables!

This receipe just does not work. Very watery, veggies need to be smaller cut.
