I have cooked so many time skirt on the grill, the best way to have the skirt steak is cook with the skin on until the skin is crunchy then you can take it off, and the meat keep all juices and the texture is very tender, Tip, rub the meat with regular olive oil not extra virgin, and sea salt or koser salt. medium grain. and. cook at your taste, side with french fries a la provenzal, make with finely chopped garlic and chopped italian parsley and pinch of regular salt. you can add cimichurri sauce as well for the steak.

Great dish - nice combination of spices. Meat was delicious without the chimichurri sauce as well - perfect dish to serve when you are unsure of company's tastes. Those that want some bold flavor can add the sauce. Was a real crowd pleaser and will cook this one again!

Turned out really great. If the meat is good - this dish will be good! Made with the chimichurri sauce and it was excellent. Also served with garlic spiced grilled potatoes.

The chimichurri sauce livens this (and a lot of other cuts of beef as well). Sometimes I use this on the steak, or on boiled/roasted new potatoes to accompany the steak
