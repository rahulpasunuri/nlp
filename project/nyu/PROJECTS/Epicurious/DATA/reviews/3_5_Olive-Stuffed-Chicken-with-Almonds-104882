Pretty good, but not fabulous. Used vermouth as suggested, and added some minced garlic and sundries tomatoes. Watch the cooking, because my almonds and tomatoes burnt a little bit. It was decent, but not amazing.

My significant other thought this was the best chicken he has ever had. I would have to agree. It turned out amazing!

Sauteed these for a few minutes each, then moved them to a pyrex dish, added remainder of olive-almond blend, and also added sun-dried tomato slices for color and flavor. Topped with shredded smoked mozzerella. Cooked about 15 minutes in the oven. Also for the olive-almond blend, added a touch of olive oil and basil. It was delightful.

My husband and I are both quite seasoned when it comes to good food. Every couple of weeks, right now, we choose a theme for cooking -- this time it's mediterranean! I this dish exactly as called for, except varied the types of olives I used a bit. We were both pleasantly surprised! Nice, full, flavor. 4 forks up! :-)

I followed the recipe, almost. The store was out of fresh parsley... imagine... so I used oregano as suggested by another review. In the end I scratched the sauce. It was good, but unique. A flavor I thought was likely to be a love it or hate it. I didn't want to risk it for guests so I just sauted a little butter, oregano and added roasted garlic I made for another dish. It was hit. My guests were licking their lips and begging for seconds. I'll let my husband try the sauce on the chicken leftovers and cross my fingers he likes it.

A family favorite. I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of the breasts and vary the types of olives I use each time I serve it.

This was great, I got rave reviews from my friends. I baked the chicken using sherry like previously recommended. I also added feta cheese to the chopped olives. I added some greek olives to the mix. I'm partial to thighs and they worked out great.

Rather than saute-ing the chicken, I put the stuffed breasts in a covered pyrex dish topped with the almonds and about 4T of cooking wine then baked it in the oven on 400 F for 30 minutes. Came out beautifully!

I just ate my first attempt at this recipe. I thought it was quite tasty, and certainly worth making again but didn't find it outstandingly delicious. I used vermouth instead of water and also added baby spinach in at the end so that I had a bed of wilted greens rather than a sauce. That worked really well as the crunch of the almonds was a great contrast to the spinach.

As suggested I used wine and pre-sliced almonds, without adding any extra salt. Very quick, easy, and according to my dinner partner "olively delicious."

Great! I swapped out half of the olives with capers, and used vermouth to deglaze. Served with saffron/lemon/onion orzo.

This was delicious and easy! I used pimento stuffed green olives from a jar. My mom and husband both loved it!

Very nice, easy to do. But I thought the combination of brown butter with olives tasted a little odd.

Rating: 1
It was pretty to look at and easy to prep., but it did not taste good at all. I cooked in white wine and stuffed chicken with olives, capers and parseley. I was hoping the flavor will blend overnight, so I gave it another chance today to impress me. It did not do the job. I know I won't prapare it again.

I liked that it's such a beautiful dish. I knew my youngest son would love it. I'm not a huge olive fan but I was intrigued by the combination with almonds. It didn't disappoint. Browning the chicken skin in the butter from roasting the almonds gave the meat a great almondy flavor. I'll make it again. My husband also loved it.

I followed others suggestions and cooked in a white wine. I thought it was fantastic as did all my guests.

Sorry to be the dissenting voice but I didn't like this at all. I followed the directions exactly accept to not add any salt to anything. Still the green olives made it far too salty. Maybe if I really rinsed the olives well it would help but no I don't think so. The flavor of the olives totally clashed with the almonds and the sauce was very dry. It was very difficult to swallow this chicken. I won't make it again.

we loved this dish. i burnt the almods by mistake and had to toss them but the dish was still delicious. i used skinless breasts and added some lemon juice and three tablespoons of chicken broth instead of water. tasted great and i will definitely make again.

Wow! This is a great fast supper, and not too unhealthy either. I used Sweet Vermouth in place of water for the sauce and it was great. Like someone else I also started out with slice almonds to save time. Paired it with green beans which I topped with some leftover almonds.

Delicious and easy; the flavors blend very nicely. I make this all the time and have a couple hints: 1) pitting olives is easy if you use the flat side of a large knife to squash them, then remove pit with your fingers. 2) Slice the chicken breast on the bias into medallions and then top with bits/sauce from pan for a nice presentation.

Actually I'd give this a 3 1/2 for ease of preparation and simplicity plus fabulous taste. I used cilantro instead of parsley and loved it.

I followed the recipe and used improvement suggestions from others. For instance used the couscous with apricots and the sugar snap peas with shallots as sides. I substituted white wine for water and used chicken breasts with the skin. Good thing I tried this menu out first. At best it was bland at worst unmemorable. I was planning to use this for a dinner for eight but now will do lamb shanks or osso bucco.

This was really delicious--I'd give it three and half forks! I served it over angel hair pasta. I didn't have whole almonds--just slivered, so I cut the sauteeing time a bit. This is suprisingly good for the few ingredients involved.

Fabulous!

This was a fabulous meal with modifications. Pounded the chicken flat and stuffed with olive/currants/garlic mixture with lemon juice and rolled into a roulade. Then seared both sides and deglazed pan with sweet vermouth and added rest of olive/garlic/currant mixture and almonds. Cooked til done in oven and finished off sauce with a little butter.

I too substituted in lemon juice, white wine and oregano - fabulous. It was a romantic dinner and my date raved on and on.

I incorporated advice from a previous review and added lemon juice and white wine to the sauce and we thought it was really tasty. We'd make this again in a heartbeat. We also used toothpicks to close up the chicken and then put them on the grill. We much prefer chicken seared on the grill.

Rating: 2
This dish was ok, but not something i'd venture to make again. i did add a touch of lemon to the meat, and shallots to the olives. unfortunately, due to something i did wrong, my sauce was very thin, and as it is a huge factor in flavour here, i'd advise extra attention be paid to it... perhaps it was because my date was so late.. anyhow, the presentation was great with a few colorful garnishes, but flavour was not phenomenal.

Though I would make this dish again I made a few modifications. First, I seare the chicken breasts (I used skinless) until browned on each side, and then finish in a 350 degree oven for 5 minutes. Second, I used kalamata olives mixed with a bit of feta for the stuffing. Third, for the sauce, I used lemon juice in addition to the parsley, almonds, white wine and butter to finish off the sauce. Probably a nice variation would use oregano instead of parsley

THis was not only quite easy to prepare, but delicious and moist with flavor. Originally, I was a bit hesitant mixing chicken with olive but the two pair wonderfully. I would highly recommend this dish, and took the advice of another reviewer (used white wine instead of water) YUMMMMY! ...and the leftovers are even better! :)

Olives and toasted almonds were a fantastic flavor together! I used boneless, skinless breasts and finished it with a little white wine added to the pan. Very good and I will make again.

I have made the many times, it is always a hit. I saute a little chopped shallot and add it to the olives before stuffing the chicken. I also replace the water with white wine for the finished sauce.

This was pretty good. The almonds and olives were a good combination, although the recipe did seem to be missing something -- perhaps because I used the skinless breasts. The leftovers made GREAT chicken salad, though -- added some dried apricots and served on pita.

Well, this was one of those rare recipes that my husband said should go in the "Make Again" stack. He's hard to please but really ate this one right up! Easy to make with the exception of I bought non-pitted olives and had to pit them myself. Dumb mistake. Next time I'll get the pitted ones and shave 15 mins. off the prep time. I used Parsley flakes as the store I went to was out of fresh, but hubby didn't seem to mind/notice. I didn't eat this, as I'm a vegetarian, but whatever gets rave reviews from the meat eater in the house, gets rave reviews on here. Definitely will make again.

My guest and I loved this recipe. It was easy and tasted like something we would have been served in a restaurant. Served it with the sugar snap peas w/ginger & garlic and couscous w/apricots from the same "Gourmet" issue (April 2001). The sweetness of the apricots played off well w/the tartnes of the olives. Made it a second time with chicken thighs rather than breasts - did not come out nearly so well. Since the thighs take longer to cook, the olives were overcooked.

Rating: 3
I know some people hate reviews full of substitutions, but I didn't feel like going to the store so I used kalamata olives, pine nuts, and oregano instead of picholine, almonds and parsley. I also added some chopped onion to the sauce and sauteed for a minute before adding the water. It was great-a bit on the salty side, but I like it that way.

This is quickly becoming a favorite in our household. We're always on a quest for interesting chicken dishes, and this one is a keeper. I always use skinless breasts, and while the olives can get a bit messy, the more often I cook it, the better I get. Paired this with Zucchini Couscous - a great combo.

This dish was absolutely delicious (and I had very high expectations from reading the other reviews). I couldn't find picholine, so I used plain green olives. So yummy. A bit salty from all the olives. Next time, I won't salt the chicken breasts before cooking them.

So easy and delicious! The great thing about this dish is that they're even good for leftovers because the nuts stay crunchy. The picholine olives make all the difference since they have a slightly nutty taste.

This is completely and totally amazing--and I don't usually go for either an abundance of olives or nuts in a main course. The flavors blended superbly. I used skinless breasts due to a lack of attnetion to the ingredient list. Came out just fine. Just be sure to get a nice brown on at least one side of the chicken.

This recipe lived up to my high expectations. It is a simple recipe that yields very rich results. The almonds and olives work together very will. The olives are the dominant taste so it helps that I love olives of any kind. The process was easy and the instructions provided were accurate and not hard to follow. I would recommend trying this if you want to impress special guests or as I did, your wife.
