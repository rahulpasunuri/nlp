All you four-fork reviewers know your stuff. I agree that this is one of the best flans I've tasted. The consistency and taste is closer to a creme brulee than to most flans I've had. It was delicate and creamy but held its shape well. This is the first flan that my boyfriend would have again, which says a lot. I followed the recipe closely except that I didn't have a loaf pan so I used individual ramekins. I reduced the baking time to one hour (covered) and 40 minutes (uncovered). They turned out perfectly. The pears were a delicious and interesting accompaniment.

I loved this. It was very sweet, but I like sweet, and it paired perfectly with the pears, which kind of cut the sweetness a bit. I would cook it just a little bit extra to help with the consistency, but it was a really great recipe. Wasn't that difficult to make, but definitely took some time.

Extremely smooth and rich. It was time consuming, but totally worth it, and the guests loved it.

I made this for Christmas or Thanksgiving at least 5 years ago and to this day my family asks for it at every single holiday. It never fit in with any of my subsequent holiday menus, so I hadn't made it since, but this year I caved to popular demand and actually planned my whole menu around serving this for dessert- it's that good. The recipe description "ultra-creamy flan (think crème brûlée)" is very accurate. It's much thicker than any other flan I've had and also more flavorful and yes, as commented, quite sweet. I serve a very small portion because of the sweetness and no one complains- it's thick/creamy enough that even a small piece is satisfying.

This was amazing. Our guests were practically fighting to take home the leftovers. It IS rather sweet, but coffee helps to temper that. Oh, and it took an extra 10 minutes or so to be set on the edges. It was somewhat jiggly in the middle, but after chilling it for 8 hrs, the texture was perfect. (I baked it in the morning, so it didn't chill overnight).

Extremely disappointed after reading the rave reviews. Way, way too sweet...Took one bite and tossed the entire thing...The delicacy expected of a flan is overwhelmed by the tooth- aching sweetness. The creme also made it too rich and heavy. Nothing elegant or delicate about this "flan"! Agree with another reviewer that the accompanying pears are a redundant overkill. Best to stick to the traditional flan recipe which also bakes in 1/3 of the time.

This was the most delicious flan I've ever tasted! I made it for my sons and husband - all big fans of flan, creme brulee and all custard style desserts - they loved it! Thanks to all the reviews here, I used an extra egg yolk and had no problems with it setting in the recommended time. I added a tablespoon of brandy to the pears before cooking and they were the perfect complement to the flan. The only negative was the caramel sauce, which I turned my back on for a minute and burnt slightly!

This was positively *wonderful* and well worth the work - in fact, it is easier than it looks. The only change I would make next time is to slice the pears thinner so they were not so bulky and would stretch further.

The pears, I cut them in halves, are wonderful with The Perfect Flan recipe (on this site). Do always use the water-bath, (bain marie) and you only need to bake 40 minutes in individual 1/2 cup glass bakeware. You also don't need to cover with foil. I know this is using two different recipes BUT the results are unbelievable. Oh my, memories of Argentina! With this recipe mine were even better.

Fantastic dessert! My gourmet group all asked for the recipe and nearly licked their plates! I followed the recipe almost exactly and it came out perfectly. The only change, based on another review, was I used 4 large egg yolks and 3 extra large egg yolks. When I make this for Thanksgiving I will use 6 pears so that each person can have 2 pear quarters as shown in the photo.

I was a bit nervous to make this for a dinner party, with some reviews having trouble getting it to gell, but I followed the recipe exactly and it made the most delicious dessert I've ever had. Everyone at the party could not stop talking about it, besides the fact that you need about 3 days to make it, it was not that difficult and SO impressive. I can't wait to make it again.

This is an outstanding and elegant desert, but I do have some recommendations: 1) the flan is very delicious and does not need the glazed pears (overkill) 2) I found it to be too rich, next time I will try it with 10% cream 3) thought the maple flavour really comes through, I found it to be too sweet - next time I may reduce the maple syrup to 3/4 cup. Also, in my oven, I had to cook it 15 minutes longer, the center was still moving and it did set overnight to the perfect texture.

I made this dish about a year ago and my mouth still waters when i think of it, and the 5 others who shared it still ask about it constantly. Its a DEFINITE keeper, and I'm gonna make it again this holiday season. It's great any time of year. Super duper creamy Flan was to phreakin' DIE for!!!

Made this for a Thanksgiving dinner without the pears. I used Grade 'B' maple syrup and the flan turned out beautifully! I can definitely understand the previous reviewer's comments about the baking time - I also had to bake it for more than the time required, and when I took it out it was only just set at the edges. I had trouble coating the pan evenly with the syrup but after the baking the flan did end up with an even coating of syrup so no loss there. The maple flavour was really divine; strong and delicious. This one is DEFINITELY going to be made again and again!

I have made many creme caramels and pots de creme, so I thought this would be a snap to make. The custard looked great when I put it into the oven, but after cooking for over the time stated, still had not set. I thought it would probably set as it cooled and then in the fridge, but I knew by looking at it that it was a lost cause. I think too much steam got to it, because it seemed to have curdled. There was an awful lot of liquid in the middle. I poured the mess down the sink, and found a recipe for Pear Pie with maple and ginger, which turned out fantastically! Anyone have any suggestions for the flan disaster? Maybe if you didn't cover with foil. I have never done that with any other custard type deserts.

i really enjoyed this, as did my Thanksgiving guests. definitely make the pears - their warm, gritty texture are such a great counterpoint to the cold, creaminess of the flan. the only drawback is how long it takes to make vs. a regular flan. but it was probably the richest and creamiest flan i've ever had -- unbelievable!

I've made this flan without the pears many times and it has always been a big hit. The flan has a creamy consistancy and it really should be taken out of the oven whe still jiggly in the middle.

Rating: 4
I made this twice, and both times it came out really well! My guest couldn't get enough of it! It tasted so delicious -- much smoother than regular flan or creme caramel, and the maple flavor really shines. Make sure you make the pears right before serving -- the sauce can't sit around for long. Also the flan has to be well-chilled (hence overnight) to really set. Otherwise it might crumble.

Stayed up until 1am waiting for flan to set, and never did. Consistency was all wrong. I prefer the standard, no fail cuban flan. 1/2 cup sugar, 5 whole eggs, 1 can of condensed milk, 1 cup of milk, and 1 tsp vanilla. Melt sugar until it caramelizes and pour on bottom of pan. Mix ingredients and cook (no foil)for 45min-1hour. Make sure to use roasting pan covered half way with water.

Flan was certainly silky smooth and decadent, however, am not sure the taste warranted the time consuming method. Have other recipes which take a fraction of the time, and whose ingredients are less "heart-clogging". Can't recommend it like the previous reviews (which is why I tried it in the first place!).

This was great (but time consuming). My guests loved it. I was unsure about the pan size but I found the exact sized-nonstick pan by Martha Stewart @ Kmart for under $6. When I was making it it didn't look like it was big enough to serve 12 but it did. Also sour cream worked just fine.

Rating: 4
This is one of the most indulgent desserts I've ever tasted - highly recommend it. Next time I'll experiment by adding maybe two more egg yolks to see if it firms up the flan a bit more. Make it ahead of time - and do the pears 30 minutes before serving. Delicious!

What an unbelievable dessert! It is almost TOO decadent. The flan was unbelievably creamy, and not eggy at all (follow the earlier reviewers suggestion for testing; I did add another egg yolk after testing). I made this for Thanksgiving. I made a half recipe and baked it in a half size loaf pan, which required no change in the cooking time. I burnt myself badly at some point during the day, so I skipped the pears. Even without them, this was fabulous, really good maple flavor, even though there is not much syrup in this. Then on day 2, I made the pears to go with the leftovers. I can't even describe how good it was. The texture of the pears highlighted the creaminess of the flan, the carmelization highlighted the maple flavor. My husband has been walking around saying "flantastic" for 2 days now. Although this recipe is time consuming, it's really very easy, and the results are worth the time tenfold!

The long time cooling and then cooking is well-work the wait. This is a fabulous dessert, unbelievably creamy and rich. I did have my doubts about it setting, but it came out perfectly. The description "center moves slightly" is a little deceiving. It certainly looked more than slightly to me, but it firmed up in the refrigerator. My friend makes a wonderful flan, so I was a little afraid to try this. This creamy concoction shouldn't be called flan really...but it is great no matter what you call it!

Wonderful; easy to prepare. Thanks for the heads up on timing. I do think the pears add a lot to the dish - their texture versus the creaminess of the flan was to die for. Definitely a keeper.

I haven't made this yet, though it looks excellent. I use grade B maple syrup which eliminates the need to reduce it (Trader Joe's or Ebay for that grade).I have made a lot of flans over the years and am wondering why they're putting us through the headache with the caramel syrup when you could simply carmelize sugar in a sautee pan and coat the baking pan with that. There is no reason to have to boil a syrup when just plain sugar works just great. It's an unnecessary step. I've always used plain sugar caramel and have had no problems in any flan I've made. I have maple sugar and will caramelize that for an even better maple flavor.

This is one of those rare dishes that absolutely must be on your 'can't fail' list. This is extraordinary..a show stopper. My friends are begging me for the recipe but this is a keeper...a signature dish.

Delicious and very easy to make. If you have a setting problem, it may be that your eggs were not large enough - egg yolk is the thickening agent here. You could try testing by cooking a bit in a ramekin first (which is what I did given the comments) - a ladleful for about 20 minutes at 325 - don't bother with the covering and waterbath. Then pop in the freezer once cool enough for a few minutes. If it doesn't look as if it is going to set, beat up an extra egg yolk and add the mix to it.

Someone please tell me what I did wrong! The flavor-fantastic; If you want soup for dessert! I cooked it an hour longer than called for and it still ended up only 1/3 set after it came out of the fridge. Is the custard suppost to be liquid form when you put it in the fridge to cool or are you supposed to cook it more on the stove top? Does altittude have anything to do with it?? Thank God I have a stand by dessert.

This recipe give such rich and creamy flan! I couldn't put my spoon down after my first taste. =) My husband loved it as well. And he's an expert on flan (being froom Argentina). I didn't prepare the pears, but I may try it on my next attempt. Eat on!

Delicious recipe, however, carefully read the cooking/prep time. I started too late and stayed up until 2:00 am! Made this flan for Thanksgiving dinner and received rave reviews from everyone.

I never made a flan before. On Saturday, Day 1, I knew it was going to be delicious. I invited friends over for dessert on the following Monday night. It took me 3 days! Cooking it with "no foil until the middle slightly moves" took more than 2 hours and it still was very loose. I thought I blew it. Next day when it came out of the refrigerator, it was perfect. I took pictures! My friends loved it.

This recipe is AWESOME!!! I made it last night, with bad timing on my part, I stayed up till 1AM to finish the baking. It will be served to my future in-laws tonite. I took a small chunk out of one corner to taste, just in case it's a flop, I will still have time for plan B... but boy it is SOOOO decadent. I've got the pears, just don't know if I'll need it. It seems like the pears are for presentations only.

Has anyone ever come across a recipe for a flan cooked in a pressure cooker? While visiting friends in Spain a few years back, I tasted such a flan. It was amazingly dense, rich, and delicious, but I have not been able to find a recipe for it. Any ideas?

This flan is just out of this world! I am a flan fanatic, I have tried many versions/recipes of it, but nothing compares to this one, I just followed the recipe and had the perfect dessert for thanksgiving, all my guests just raved about this flan, and many of them were all "flan connoisseurs"! I agree that you could avoid the pears, they get lost with the wonderful flavors of the flan itself and maple! <> I am not naturally inclined to write reviews about the recipes I try, however I wanted to share my experience with this one!

This flan is unbelieveably creamy and wonderful. At Thanksgiving, it was the perfect contrast or complement to the apple pie and pumpkin pecan pie. The pears didn't appeal to me and I thought I would make the flan solo, but I got an idea to serve cranberries some way with it. There is a recipe here on Epicurious called "Chocolate Tart with Candied Cranberries." I made the cranberries from that and served the flan on a rectangular white tray with those cranberries around it. It looked so beautiful and the cranberries, with their tartness, was a perfect accompaniment, in my and my guests' opinions.

Excellent holiday dessert change from the normal. Simple to make but a little time consuming. Well worth the effort. Everyone loved it, but didn't have enough for thirds!

Wow! ...have made this recipe two times now and my guests all raved, with many having seconds. Both times I served it with the pears, but it is not necessary...the flan can stand on its own. I think this is the best flan I have ever tasted or made. Top with a scoop of whipped cream...just great!!!

There aren't too many 4 fork recipes out there but this was to die for!! It was truly like creme brulee -- rich and oh sooooo creamy. Not at all like traditional flan! I was afraid the maple syrup flavor would be too overpowering but it wasn't -- turned out to be just right. My guests and I found the pears an unnecessary addition to the dessert. Can't wait to make this flan again......
