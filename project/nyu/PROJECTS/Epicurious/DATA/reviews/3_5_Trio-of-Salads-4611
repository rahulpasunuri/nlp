I've been making this for years. It's a standard in our house. I don't always make all three salads together, but if I'm making a beet or celeriac salad, I often turn to this recipe.

Way too much work for very average result. Deleting from recipe box

This is a great recipe! Used high quality olive oil & basamic vinegar. The Shallot Mustard dressing is delicious - I will use it for any salad in the future.

Excellent mix of flavors and colors! Great for a summer party. I found it easier to mix the individual salads in large freezer bags: easy to handle, place in fridge and spread out on a serving platter later.

Excellent blend of herbs and flavorings however, I found that the fresh vegetable taste was lost when made a day in advance. Tasted much better after only an hour of chilling.

This is a delicious and colorful salad. Easier to use canned julienne beets!! A snap to do. Judy from Illinois

I loved this recipe. But next time I am just going to make the celery root part. The beets were good but time consuming and didn't have a good salad texture.

Beautiful and delicious salad. Works wonderfully as a do-ahead.
