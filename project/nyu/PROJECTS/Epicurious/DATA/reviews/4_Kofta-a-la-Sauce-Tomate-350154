I love this recipe. I ate versions of this all across North Africa. I make the Tunisian version and spice my meatballs a little more aggressively, but the light and plain tomato sauce is exactly right. After baking the meatballs I usually cook them in the sauce for longer so that it gets more of their flavour. Great with bread, orzo, couscous or bulgur. The meatballs freeze well with or without the sauce,and they are delicious on their own. I serve them as hors d'oevres with tzatziki, tahini or harissa dipping sauces and they are great in pita with salad.

Not the greatest recipe in the world. The tomato sauce is good but very basic. For the meatballs I used ground lamb and a whole red onion which I chopped very fine in my food processor. The meatballs still had a lot of crunchy onion in them. I guess I made my meatballs too big and didn't fry them long enough becuase they ended up not cooked all the way through after the 20 minute simmer.

Quick and surprisingly tasty. Goes nicely with brown rice. Very adaptable to what you have on hand.

fast and simple, i had leftover tomato sauce from a pasta earlier in the week and simply used that instead. i did the Syrian variation. you couldn't taste the pine nuts much, so next time i'll toast them first. i recommend grating the onion as the recipe suggests, results in smoother meatball tecture. though after grating i had to soak up excess onion juice with a paper towel.

I have this cookbook and I make this recipe all the time! I substitute red meat for ground turkey and it comes out great. The onions in the meat and the tomato sauce keep the turkey moist. I love to serve it with whole wheat couscous, which is ready in 5 min!
