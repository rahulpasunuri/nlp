Delicious and so easy. We loved the caraway flavor. Probably used about 1/2 the amount of olive oil. Cooking time was just right. Flavor and texture of the sprouts was really good. Served with another epicurious recipe - pork with cherry chutney - and it was a very nice compliment.

My husband & I were Brussels Sprouts virgins until I tried this recipe. I loved it but husband said he didn't care for it. He said maybe it was the caraway seeds. I'll make them again without the seeds & we'll see. Anyone have a substitution that he may like better.

Very fast, easy and good. We will have Brussel Sprouts a lot more often now that I know what roasting can do!

Roasting does amazing things to Brussels sprouts, and the caraway is an interesting addition. Even my husband, who is not a fan of Brussels sprouts (or anything else in the cabbage family) loved this dish.

This recipe is great, but I've had mixed results between the two times I've made it. The first results were crispy, the second much more soggy, and I believe that the only difference was in the amount of oil  you might want to try less.

We thought these were great. The recipe was so simple and quick. I didn't expect to prefer this oil-rich recipe to my usual butter-rich one, but I did. The sprouts were crispy outside and creamy inside. You have to adjust the roasting time depending on the size of the sprouts, so they don't burn.

Before serving this surprisingly delicious dish, add some a few squirts of fresh lemon and it'll make everyone's tastebuds dance.

Could you use sesame seeds instead of caraway? Or anything else? The recipe looks interesting but I HATE caraway seeds.

Only criticism is they were a little too salty tasting.

It's good, but brussel sprouts aren't made for roasting. I thought it would be reminiscent of a favorite cabbage dish with the caraway seeds, but the brussel sprouts were tougher than I care for. I had to roast them for a total of 28 minutes to reach palatable tenderness. Overall, nice flavor, but boiling them brings out a sweetness that is missed in this recipe.

I hated this recipe -- what a way to ruin a pound of perfectly good pound of brussel sprouts. I'll take mine steamed with a little butter, salt and pepper any day!

These are amazing; I eyeballed the salt and pepper rather than measuring and I think I did a little bit less,and I upped the caraway seeds. Delish and will be making them regularly.

Easy and fantastic. I tossed with the caraway seeds in the beginning and made sure to stir a few times while cooking. I did add salt to taste, not called for in recipe. This will go into my every day cooking.
