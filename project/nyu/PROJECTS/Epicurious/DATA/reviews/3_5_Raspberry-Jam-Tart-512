This was a snap! Being particularly lazy, I skipped the gloppy egg and just dripped whipping cream and raw sugar crystals on the top layer of pastry. I served it with raspberry sorbet and it was beautiful. Go ahead and give it a try.

Can't beat this for a last minute dessert. Served with a dab of vanilla ice cream and a few fresh berries for garnish. I also sprinkled a little sugar on top of the tart before baking.

So quick and yet so pretty! I've tried all sorts of jam variations. Add a few fresh berries and some shredded lemon peel for extra flavor and fun.
