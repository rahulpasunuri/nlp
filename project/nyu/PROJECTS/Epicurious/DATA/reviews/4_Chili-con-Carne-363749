With a few changes this recipe won Adults Favorite at a chili cook-off with some 40 judges. It has a very unique flavor due to the spices and dark beer. I used an Amber lager from Mexico. Suggested changes: Cut chuck into 1/4 inch cubes. Reduce ground ancho cilies to 1/4 cup. Use fire-roasted diced tomatoes in place of plain. Replace 2 cups water with beef stock. Cook 1 can pinto beans in separate saucepan with 1 ladel of sauce from chili and serve on the side, for people who MUST have beans in their chili. Serve with jalapeno cornbread, shredded cheese, onion and cilantro. Very Good.

This one's a keeper. I used ~ 1/4 cup of ancho chili powder and it was just spicy enough for my whole family. I also added a can of red beans and a couple tablespoons of corn bread mix instead of the masa, as I was making a batch of cornbread at the same time.

Without question, the best chili I have ever made! Good flavors without excessive heat. I have used both whole dried ((reconstituted) ancho chiles and ancho chile power with good results. It's easier to regulate the spiciness using the ground power, but I think the whole chiles add a bit of texture

Great, except I used 1/2 c ancho chile powder. I love it, but this was crazy HOT! HOLY #@!!!! I advise to taste test your chiles first!

This was an amazing and flavorful chile recipe. I used flank steak and cut into 1 1/2 inch slivers. I bought a five pack of ancho chiles and ground them down in a spice mill. It made a little more than 1/2 c but I added it all. I think the cloves and the cinnamon complimented the dish well, not overpowering at all. Due to my cuts of meat being very lean, I had no fat to spoon off. I didn't feel like spending money and a big bag of masa flour, so I used cornmeal muffin mix plus a dash of lime juice and it worked just fine. My husband loved it, and said it didn't even need garnishes. Personally, I think the garnishes just make it that much better - esp sour cream & cilantro. This will become our standard chile recipe from now on. Aromatic, hearty, thick, and slightly spicy - its perfect.

I won a neighborhood chili cookoff with this recipe. At the end of the evening, there wasn't a bite left. I added some chipotle chili powder and a few dashes of tabasco to give it some zing, but otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The cinnamon and cloves give a depth to the chili and I wouldn't consider omitting them.As an east coast girl who likes her chili with beans, tomatoes and lots of veggies, I did find this to be quite rich. It really benefitted from the fresh garnishes (onions, cilantro & tomatoes). Will definitely make again!

This is a wonderful recipe if you want a different spin on chili. I didn't have ancho chilis, so I used two tablespoons of ancho chili powder. I also used 1/4 tsp of chipotle chili powder to zip things up. The beer does a wonderful job tenderizing the beef. I have prepared this recipe with and without beans. With beans, I served as suggested with sides of onion, sour cream, etc. Without beans, I served with Spanish rice and homemade tortilla's. Wonderful both ways...and so easy!

I should have mentioned below that I did substitute beef stock for the cups of water, because to me chili can't have too much flavor!

I made this for a party and everyone loved it!!! There were even native Texans in attendance who have requested the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used ancho chile powder and I'm not too sure that was correct. This was a perfect party recipe - after the initial preparation, it could pretty much be ignored and left to gently simmer. The next day the small amount of leftovers had even more depth of flavor. Great chili recipe!!

Excellent Recipe! Next time I will add some hot peppers to it as I like a spicy chili, but this is absolutely delicious! It took me 45 minutes to cut all the fat off the meat, but it makes such a difference in the end to have tender, lean meat that melts in your mouth!

I may agree with "a cook from Spring, Texas on 02/02/11" Why the spices clove and cinnamon? The flavors of those spices just don't jibe with beef for me. Can someone answer how those spices originated in the chili recipe?

Made this for a trip to Tahoe and everyone loved it!! Took the advice of others and only used one cup of chicken stock and added some flower to thicken. I will definatly make this again.

I made this recipe today and the "True Texas Chili" last week. Both are good. In this one the cooling and skimming step is not necessary if you close trim the beef before cooking. I'm sure both recipes are authentic. The beer in this one intrigues me because I just made the "Beer Batter Bread" with 50% corn meal. I want to eat them together!

I also used 1 quart of beef stock instead of water

This was the best! Made it as is and braised it in the oven at 300.

Fabulous recipe - the many ingredients contributed to the excellent flavor. My teenage son does not like chile with beans, so we decided to try this all meat variety. Dicing the beef took time but we loved the texture of the diced meat (I cut the pieces a bit smaller - more like 1/4 inch cubes). Served it over white rice with scallions, cheddar and sour cream, with homemade maple corn bread (King Arthur recipe) - delicious!!! It's a bit of work, but makes plenty for a crowd, or leftovers. (I will have to check out the "True Texas Chili" recipe that another reader recommended!)

Total over kill with the spices, beer and toppings. Other than some chopped raw onion.. All you need is: Corn oil,red meat,onions, garlic,chile powder,cumino and diced tomato. A dash of Mesquite Liquid Smoke. Thicken with flour or masa. Serve with corn bread or tortillas. Any beer, ice cold, will do to put out the fire. Good chile will make you sweat! Shiner Bock is for yuppie Texans.

Super delicious. Braised in the oven at 300 instead of cooking on stove. Meat was deliciously tender and succulent.

Tasty but not a winner-especially for the work involved. My family (3 teen boys + dad, not picky) much prefer the 'True Texas Chili' from this website, 2009, courtesy 'Lobel's Meat Bible.' Too much work, too many ingredients, too much in general. If we hadn't already found the recipe I've referenced, we might like it better. We're not from Texas, so hoping to hear from those who are!
