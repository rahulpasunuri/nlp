just had this for dessert this evening. If there was a 2 and a half fork, that's what i'll give. I replaced the water with orange juice, and used grand marnier for the liquor. I did think mine was quite eggy... maybe my eggs were big? Also it came out quite thick, so I had to add about 1/4 cup plus more water. This is afterall not suppose to be a pancake. I had frozen strawberries in the fridge so I made a compote. The pairing was great. there were some leftover batter,... and I have stuck it back in the fridge. All in all, I thought it wasn't as good as the french crepes I had before, but am willing to give it another go tomorrow... for breakfast!

I have no idea what went wrong with Jeff from DC but this makes wonderful crepes. My three daughters clamor for me to make these on Sunday morning and I have absolutely no problem flipping them at all.Give it a try and you might want to make a fruit filling to go inside.

Not the best I've used. Tasted sort of eggy, were thicker than i like. No issues handling though;

I followed the recommendations of some other cooks, substituting milk and Kahlua for the water. A lovely Saturday morning brunch, served with fresh fruits and Greek yogurt.

The only recipe for crepes

I didn't like this crepe recipe. The recipe was very easy to make and the crepes turned out very pretty, but were utterly flavorless. I guess if you want your crepes only to be a vehicle for the filling they would be OK, but I would have enjoyed them more if they had more flavor. Not a fan.

Recipe was delicious! Would have liked a bit more citrus zing - will add more zest or, perhaps, some orange liquor to it. I made crepe cake - adding raspberry jam in between the layers - made a delightful breakfast dish!

TERRIBLE! I have an actual crepe pan and I'm thinking these are not designed to use with an actual crepe pan. I've made creps many time in my life and these were by far the worst. Its hard to describe but the texture was off - they did not flip well and they were just too mushy and fell apart when I picked them up. A much better recipie is (from joy of cooking) 1/2 half cup flour 1/2 cp cup milk. 1/4 cup lukewarm water 2 large eggs 2 table spoons butter 1.5 tbsp sugar pinch of salt. DO NOT MAKE THESE

try adding finely ground citrus zest or splashing with orange juice , maybe even replacing the water with juice - brightens and lightens

Foolproof. Did not bother to let it sit, and it still worked fine.

I love this recipe! I made a slight adjustment to the recipe. I replaced the water with additional milk, added a pinch of salt and an extra tblsp of sugar, a little Kahlua and a little vanilla.The milk gave the batter more texture, the kahlua a round nutty flavor and the vanilla was aromatic when the batter hit the skillet. The additional sugar did not make the crepes too sweet. I served them with a fresh mixed berry compote and a dollop of creme fraiche and fresh unsweetened whipped cream. I paired these delicious crepes with soft scrambled eggs with goat cheese and chives. This was a perfect Saturday brunch, a great balance of flavor and texture.

Wonderful recipe. Beautifully thin but great consistency so easy to work with. I used an actual crepe maker. Be sure to add the liquor even if you aren't making dessert crepes.

Great Crepes recipe! My calphalon wok worked well for a crepe pan. I filled them with blueberries and sweetened cream cheese - wonderful for Christmas Brunch!

Best crepes ever.

These are a little tricky to handle! I had 5 good ones and 3 wrinkled ones, but the dogs appreciated those. The flavor of these crepes is amazing. I used cognac, and the flavor came through quite well. I can't think of a time when that flavor wouldn't be appropriate, but keep it in mind. I also found the first few to be too greasy so wiped the added fat from my non-stick pans and proceeded accordingly. They didn't stick and were a whole bunch tastier. There's a neat little trick I finally resorted to since my hands just don't flip things anymore -- keep a second pan on the back burner, loosen the crepe in the first pan, then release it into the second hot pan to finish. The added bonus here is that you can pour another crepe into the first pan and cut down the time it takes to make.

Wow! Very easy to do. It does fine in the freezer for 15 minutes if you can't wait overnight. Works well with just a non-stick pan.

Fantastic recipe with perfect results. I made a savoury filling of spinach and feta and rolled the crepes around it. A big success at brunch!

I added some vanilla and cinnamon and made this for a strawberry festival. Everyone raved about the crepes. The added ingredients added a wonderfully pleasing aroma and note to the preparation and to the finished product

Delicious crepes! I used Kahlua as a liqueur in the recipe and served the crepes with vanilla ice cream, stewed berries, hot fudge sauce and Bailey's whipped cream with exceptional comments from everyone at dinner.

A benchmark recipe! Anyone making crepes should tuck this one in their cook book. A well seasoned pan helps, too! I sometimes cut back on the water and increase the brandy or whatever in like measure- C'est Bon !

This was my first try at crepes. I thought they turned out quite nice, and not to difficult. Don't have a crepe pan (first try...) so used a non-stick skillet. Served with cajeta (goat's milk caramel), fresh stawberries, and fresh whipped cream. Traditional way to serve a crepe in Mexico. Liked the short chilling time (min 2 hrs.)

A staple recipe for crepes. Be sure to adjust the amount of flour (usu. a little more than what's called for in the recipe) to get a consistency that is easy to manage on the pan.
