I made this just as is, with just one tiny modification. I added 1.5 tsp of decaf (because that's what we had in the house) espresso powder/dried coffee. It added a nice touch to the brownies, and while it maintained its fudgy richness, it wasn't quite so sweet, which I liked. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate and semisweet chocolate, and Baker's unsweetened chocolate. I baked them for 325 at about 28 minutes and they were downright perfect, if I do say so myself. This will definitely be my go-to brownie recipe from now on!

Really rich and decadent! These brownies remind me of what you might get at a bakery or nice restaurant. Before baking I read several reviewers comment that they baked at 325 for less time than what the recipe indicates. I followed those tips, baking for 28 minutes at 325. Turned out slightly gooey with unbelievably good chocolate flavor.

Impossibly good. Used Lindt and Ghirardelli. 350 in a metal pan. More cakey than fudgey, but still the best I've ever tasted. The corner ones are extra magical.

Was so excited to make this recipe especially after reading reviews. I followed to a T but checked them after 28 min, removing at 34 min. Very disappointed. Dry and not fudgy at all.

Rating: 4
Usually after the first time I bake something I figure out what in the recipe needs to be adjusted for next time. I followed this entire recipe exact, and would not change anything at all. My brownies came out fudge-y and delicious and my boyfriend even said they were the best brownies he had ever had, and ate the entire tray in one night. I use ghiardeli chocolate baking bars and toll house chocolate chips. No need to try a new recipe ever again, this is my new go to for sure.

These are Killer brownies! I made them with a cup of chocolate chunks instead of chips, and Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate. Every oven is different I guess - for me, they were perfect at 350 degrees and 35 minutes.

Definitely go with oven at 325. I love sweet but did find that it was sweet. I will cut the sugar to 1 cup next time. Overall, great texture and flavor.

My daughter picked this recipe out. We actually had all the ingredients. I followed the recipe to the T. They are amazing. I made them in 2 8x8 pans. One with walnuts sprinkled on top & one just with the batter. They are exactly how I like brownies, a bit cakey. My daughter loves chocolate & she said they are the best. I did use a bit less sugar because of some of the reviews. Other than that there really is nothing to change.

Rating: 4
Didn't have the right proportions of chocolate or the semisweet chips, so used 4 oz. semi-sweet chocolate and 4 oz. bittersweet chocolate for two separate batches. Made one batch with peanut butter chips and one batch without any additional chips. Also, dusted the pan with 1/2 tbls flour and 1/2 tbls cocoa. Amazing!

Rating: 4
My favorite brownie recipe ever. I must have made this at least 100 times. I just melt the chocolate and butter together right in a sauce pot and don't worry about a double boiler, then take it off the heat and add the sugar. I also beat all the eggs together in a bowl first, and add 1 tablespoon of espresso powder, 1 tablespoon of vanilla and 1/4 cup of kahlua to the eggs. Then I slowly mix the eggs into the chocolate mixture, mix in the flour and salt and bake until they are just done. Best brownies you will ever eat!

Rating: 3
Great flavor though the crumb is definitely a little weird. 18 minutes at 325 yielded cakey on the edges, fudgy and fabulous in the middle. Added about 1/2 tsp powdered chipotle, reduced sugar to 1 cup, otherwise followed recipe exactly. Wonderful chocolate flavor.

Rating: 4
I made some modifications to meet what was in my pantry - subsituted 1/2 cup choc. chips for 3 oz of bittersweet chopped chocolate; substituted 3 tbsp cocoa powder + 1 tbsp. butter for 1 ounce unsweetened chocolate; I used salted butter, so I lowered the salt to 1/4 tsp.; I added one dollop of sour cream; The modifications above I researched to be sure they made for a correct replacement. Also, brownies are my favorite dessert, so I am a tough sell for a good brownie and I must say these were hands-down the BEST brownies I have ever had. I was caught by surprise as to how good they were! And I DID NOT use premium chocolates! I used Hershey cocoa powder, and store-brand chocolate chips. My guess about the other cooks is that they didn't use the right amount of salt (perhaps eliminating it as they though salted butter would make up for the added salt). This is a common, and terrible, mistake in baking in my opinion.

Rating: 4
The only thing I do differently is bake on 325 for 30-35mins. This prevents brownies from drying out and makes them ultra moist! Yummy!

I am OBSESSED with this brownie recipe. I must have made it at least 30 times by now. I am a coffee lover - so I have started adding a tablespoon of instant espresso and a 1/4 cup of kahlua. I usually beat the eggs before adding them in and add the kahlua, vanilla, and instant espresso to the egg mixture then slowly add the eggs in. I think beating the eggs first gives the brownies a smoother texture.

Rating: 3
These brownies turned out nicely, but I have a problem with calling them "fudge" brownies. The flavor is good--though not the best I've had--but the consistency is medium light, not dense and fudgy. Between the cakey and fudgy continuum, they land slightly on the fudgy side, but not enough to earn "fudge" in the title. :)

I don't know...these brownies didn't do it for me. I bought the best chocolate I could find, followed the recipe but the results were not great for me. I think my search for the perfect brownie recipe continues...

Made this recipe in a pinch so didn't have all the ingredients -most notably the chocolate. Used only 2 1-oz cubes of bakers bittersweet and about 1/2 cup Droste unsweetened cocoa powder. Used less sugar. Definitely kept with the 4 eggs as they make it moist. Added a tbsp veg. oil with the butter and baked in a 9 x 9 pan for only 20 mins. Yum! You definitely don't need all the chocolate in this recipe to have a rich brownie! (although I'd never say no to too much chocolate...)

Fabulous - definitely a rich, chewey brownie, not cakey at all...This recipe must be the best one out there. I add a Tbsp of espresso powder which really kicks up the chocolate.

These are great basic brownies that definitely benefit from good quality chocolate. Next time, I might add some white chocolate to make them a little more interesting. I made them according to recipe, except for cutting back on the sugar and adding some chopped dried tart cherries and Kirsch for an interesting flavor addition. Definitely take them out early! The edges that were more well done were really not great, while the fudgy middle was delicious.

Dry, dry, dry! Made exactly as called for, baked only 20 minutes but very disappointing. good flavor but only way to get past how dry they taste is to cover with ice cream. Also, did'nt like the thin size. Won't make again!

This brownie was a winner, however it was bit overpowering with the chocolate. I would suggest serving it with a light ice cream, vanilla is always a winner.

Rating: 3
Wonderful! Had to make these twice before I got it right - the first time they were overcooked at only 23 minutes in the oven, so my oven must run too hot at others suggested. But the second time I pulled them after about 18 minutes, and they are fantastic! I understand what some people meant by a strange dry texture - that's whst I got the first time and definitely seems to be from overcooking. I also used a smidge less flour the second time around. Addictive!

Rating: 4
These are very easy and just fantastic. Insanely rich...need to have them with some ice cream. I didn't have any unsweetened choc, so followed another reviewer's advice and used 2 TBS more of butter and 6 TBS of cocoa to replace. I only had salted butter, so left out the salt, and it was perfect.

This is my first time making non-box mix brownies and oh my gosh... these were absolutly orgasmic. Very rich, don't make these if you want a "cake-like" brownie. Everyone who had them said they were the best. Follow the recipe exactly with the exception of maybe reducing the sugar- I reduced to 1 1/4 cup and will probably reduce to 1 cup next time, but I like a bittersweet brownie- its really up to you. And 25 min., is definitely enough time- check at 23.

Rating: 4
These brownies are THE BEST! Easy and delish. I get many requests for them from co-workers and neighbors. I like to add chopped walnuts (sprinkled on top of the batter so they toast--a Cook's Illustrated trick). Don't be tempted to overbake them if they don't test clean-toothpick done...you could have found a chocolate chip where you tested. They firm up as they cool (so resist the temptation to cut into them when they first come out of the oven.)

Rating: 3
These were delicious! I had only a couple of ounces of good bittersweet chocolate in the house, but I made up the rest with plain old semisweet chocolate chips, and they turned out great. To balance, I cut the sugar down to a cup and added two teaspoons of instant espresso, as another reviewer did. The result was fab. Make sure not to overcook them -- mine were a little underdone, but to great effect.

Rating: 4
I made this brownies 4 times already.. i tried to use all baker's chocolate and i tried to use all ghirardelli's chocolate. Baker's chocolate brownies gave me a bitter aftertaste.. and the brownies became really dry. However, when i use Ghirardelli's chocolate, the texture was better, and didn't have bitterafter taste! I decreased the amount of sugar to 0.75cup to make it less sweet and everyone loves it!

I made these twice and followed the recipe exactly and was underwhelmed. I used Ghirardelli for all chocolates. The texture is a bit mushy, and my guests didn't get too excited. I get more compliments when I make the Baker's Chocolate One Bowl Brownies recip. Good luck!

AWESOME! These brownies are moist, rich and easy to make. I've made them numerous times and they've always turned out excellent. The previous cook who said they were dry and rated them only 1 fork must have over-baked them. You definitely want to check them at 25 minutes. (If they're overbaked in that amount of time then your oven may need to be recalibrated...my oven used to be 50 degrees hotter than what it was supposed to be).

I was really looking forward to making these as the reviews were so good, but was very disappointed. I found them to be very, very dry with a strange texture. The taste was good, the triple combination of chocolate a unique twist, but no one at the party at which they were served thought they were a hit. Disappointing.

I've made this recipe 4 times now, varying the brand of chocolate and the baking time (only because I insist on using a 9x9 pan - 9x13 pan brownies are always too thin for me). A 9x9 pan needs about 55-60 minutes. I have tried Schaffenberger, Lindt, and Ghiradelli for the bittersweet/unsweet base and like them in the order listed, with Ghiradelli being the worst - it lacked the depth of flavor that this recipe asks for. Whole Foods recently had Schaffenberger bulk 70% and 99% cacao on sale for $10.99/lb, which was hard to pass up, and the brownies were superb. Absolutely the best brownie recipe ever. I have been making cookies from scratch forever, and it occurred to me "why not brownies?" This was the recipe I chose to start on, and I will not waver from it!!! It deserves all the rave reviews here!!!

Best brownie recipe ever, nice and bittersweet. I've made these a few times, and have received rave reviews. Once, I substituted 3T cocoa powder and 1T butter for each oz. of unsweetened chocolate, and I thought they turned out even better than when using the unsweetened chocolate!

Rating: 4
I make these often, with one modification. I don't use a mixture of chocolate, just bittersweet. Makes them deep and rich. Making them according to the orginal recipe rocks too, for the record. Warm with vanilla ice cream and home made hot fudge... chocoholics beware, you could slip into a coma!

Rating: 4
Delicious. Rich without being cloyingly sweet. EASY as sin. I think the recipe will still succeed with less sugar, depending on the cacao content of the bittersweet. An 'adult' brownie.

Wow! These came out fabulous! They are very rich and extremely satisfying for the chocolate lover. I used Ghiradelli baking chocolate. To save on time and effort, I melted the choc and butter in a pyrex bowl in the microwave with no problems. I will be making this again!

This recipe is amazing - I can't count the number of people who've asked for the recipe once they've tried them. DO NOT use anything but BITTERsweet chocolate, as the recipe calls for. That's the power of these brownies. You can usually find really good bittersweet chocolate in chunks in whole food stores. Also, don't expect a dry toothpick - the brownies are meant to be fudgy and are the truest chocolate taste you can create!

It is July 4 weekend so it must be time to make these brownies again. If I didn't our guests would kill me. I am a chocaholic and brownie lover and these are the best, rich, moist, and irresistable. They are always instantly devoured. And they are very easy to make.

Rating: 3
Based on the fabulous reviews, I decided to try this recipe. I've been very happy just using the Giradelli mix but my Costco doesn't carry it anymore so I'd try something from scratch. I must say that I'm disappointed. It would have been cheaper and less work just to try another box recipe. Actually, my new favorite is Betty Crocker's Dark Chocolate brownies with the chocolate packet. I just found this recipe to be a little crumbly. I baked them until the toothpick came out clean because before that, it was totally wet and was worried they were undercooked so I probably did overcook them by about 3 mins. I baked 1/2 with nuts and 1/2 without but I'll be going back to the box for time and cost. My husband thought they were too sweet and although I thought they tasted good, I still prefer the box.

I almost skipped this recipe because I didn't have any fine-quality chocolate. But I made it anyway, substituting 2 oz. Baker's unsweetened chocolate and 4 oz. Nestle chocolate chips and it was still fabulous. I've been searching for years for a recipe for truly moist, fudgy, super-chocolatey brownies, and this is it. I agree with the other reviewers and am tossing my other recipes. Can't wait to try this with better chocolate.

I second "A Cook on 4/1/03." I have 29 brownie recipes in my collection, all excellent, different and worth making again. However, the Feb. 2000 recipe in Gourmet can only be described as orgasmic. It's expensive to make if you are using good chocolate (I use the Lindt bittersweet bars) good cocoa, not your standard supermarket variety and the best butter. Calorie killers and full of cholesterol, you only go "oooh, ah" when eating them. Thus the use of the adjective "orgasmic." Try them, you will then die and go to brownie heaven.

Wow. It's been a long sojourn to find a really great brownie recipe, but no more.... This is the best!! I make these all the time.

My colleagues love these as well!

Rating: 1
(Here comes a dissenter...) Boring, boring, boring. Though they were no trouble to make, these tasted like a box mix with chocolate chips added! I bake brownies at every opportunity and even welcome a challenging recipe. This was not it. When I just want a brownie quick fix, I often DO use a box mix (they're NOT bad--just not as good as a great scratch recipe) adding chocolate chips. Like I said, this tastes just like it or perhaps the box might even be better! I liked the texture and size of these but there was no big chocolate kick. And to be called "Triple-chocolate" seemed pretty far-fetched after tasting them--even if they do contain 3 types of chocolate. Oh--I used Ghiradelli Bittersweet chocolate, Baker's unsweet and Guittard semi-sweet chips. My favorite brownie recipe of all time comes from this site (Chocolate brownies, Feb 2000--now there's an awesome brownie!). Second favorite is a caramel pecan brownie on the Baker's chocolate website. In trying to find the perfect turtle brownie recipe, one on epicurious makes the caramel from scratch but overall, it didn't compare to the Baker's recipe which uses wrapped caramels. I know I'm digressing from rating this recipe but I felt the need to rant a little about brownie recipes. It's an ongoing quest to find the best....

Anyone who thinks these brownies are hard to make or not the best they've ever had, have never had brownies that weren't out of a box. I usually melt the butter/chocolate in a bowl in the microwave to skip a step. Every time I make these, everyone wants the recipe - or for me to make them again.

The BEST fudge brownies. So rich in chocolate. In flavor. In fudge-like quality. Super easy to make (microwave works great to melt butter and chocolate).

Let's not kid ourselves - if you want something light, have a piece of fruit.

Two words FA - NOMINAL (Thanks Paula for making it 2 words). The only altering I did was to add about 3/4 tsp of salt. I timed for 25 min and checked, still gooey, but stood at the oven door and checked every 2 minutes thereafter. Nothing worse than overcooking brownies. I will now have to give some away immediately - lest I stand here and eat them all myself.

These are by far the best brownies I've ever made, if not the best I've ever eaten! They are sinfully rich and definitely only for those who adhere to the 'fudgy school' of brownie making. They also are missing some nuts, in my opinion. Since I can buy neither unsweetened chocolate nor chocolate chips here, I used 3x100g bars of Lindt Excellence 70% melted in the batter and 1 more bar chopped up and stirred in at the end. My guests went crazy and started stuffing them in their pockets to take home. One warning: don't overbake these! Mine were just set at 25 minutes, and one friend who begged me for the recipe made them a few days later and ended up with sawdust bricks. Although they may not look totally done, they firm up as they cool. So good!

Very delicious and moist. I'm a fan of brownies of nuts; I usually won't eat them unless they have nuts. I couldn't resist the triple chocolate idea. These would be great with nuts, with icing, with confectioners' sugar dusted on top, with ice cream, and are great without those additions. For someone who is crazy about chocolate, this is an excellent recipe. I would absolutely make this again.

Yes, these were yummy brownies; however, way too chocolate-y and dense in my opinion...tasted like fudge squares. Only eat a little bit at a time unless you want to get sick. Would I make these again? Maybe... but if I had to say "yes" or "no," I think I would opt for a different recipe.

I followed prior comments and made the following changes - reduced sugar to 1 cup, reduced butter to 1 stick, reduced salt to 1/2 t. Also, because I now live abroad I had to substitute some ingredients as follows - 1/4 cocoa powder for unsweetened chocolate, dark chocolate for bittersweet chocolate, and milk chocolate chips for semisweet chips. Considering all the changes these brownies still came out awesome and were gobbled up at a social gathering. The hostess was disappointed there weren't any leftovers because she wanted some for herself for the next day!

This is not your average brownie! I understand all the positive comments. I did use Valrhona chocolate since that is what I had in the house. I will probably use something a little less expensive next time since Valrhona is not something I buy all the time! The brownie is dense and soft textured without being gooey. I reduced the sugar to one and a third cups. They came out of the pan perfectly and the taste was beyond special!!!!

(Incidentally, 6 ounces = 13 squares of that brand if you're a Trader Joe's shopper). I melt the butter in the microwave in a glass pyrex quart measuring cup and then put the slabs of chocolate right in and microwave it another minute or so and then stir it all together. Dump it into a large bowl, grab a whisk and you're off and running. Goes together quickly and always tastes great. I have substituted semi-sweet for bittersweet and white chips for semi-sweet and it worked fine...I still prefer the original version though. I don't bother with butter and flour for the pan...a shot of PAM works fine for me but I think my metal pan is somewhat nonstick. Don't overbake...25 minutes is ideal. Freezes great. ENJOY

I made this for a small party that my parents had me cook for. It was such a hit. I've never seen a dessert be eaten so fast. My parents loved it so much that they made me make another batch just for us. Me and my step-dad are chocolate-aholics and we absolutely loved these brownies. Will definitely make them again.

Made this for a New Year's Eve party and they were a smash. No one ate the bakery desserts once these were put out. They're very fudgy.

I made this recipe for my co-workers for the holidays. They couldn't keep their hands off them. Would definitely make again....

At Last!!! The perfect brownie recipe I have been searching for...a truly fudgy brownie with a chocolate flavor..not a cocoa flavor. The best thing about these is that these are actually best when baked, cut, frozen and then defrosted..making them perfect for making ahead for the holidays. I'll be making a quadruple batch today!

Simply the best brownies. Firm on the outside and gooey in the inside. A big hit with everyone!

This recipe has all the elements that make for a great brownie. In my opinion, the key to a scrumptious brownie is one that is very dense and this is it! It is also very chocolatey. Although I didn't add it to mine, I think pecans would make a lovely addition and something I will probably add next time.

These brownies are amazing. I used espresso chocolate chips and a tsp. of instant espresso which gave them a mocha twist. Folks in my office inhaled them, even those who don't like brownies.

I sent these brownies with my husband to a work event. They were a HUGE success. I've never had so many people say things like "These are the best brownies I've ever eaten" so many times! I'm saving this quick-to-fix receipe.

Absolutely sinful!!! A real hit with everyone. I was asked for the recipe which indicates how great these brownies are! I used white chocolate chips instead of semi sweet.

I was skeptical about all the rave reviews but the brownies were really good. I liked them even better cold.

These were delicious but WHY all that salt ? I automatically cut the amount down to 3/4 teasp when I was preparing the ingredients & I could still detect a salty taste to the batter. You need some salt to bring out the other flavours but I think 1/4 to a 1/2 teasp would be adequate for the proportions of the other ingredients.

These were so good, they got Fed-Ex'd for a Saturday Delivery Taste Test to my partner in New Mexico! Dense and moist, definitely a 'pass the milk' recipe!

Great Brownies!!! I've substituted Amaretto for the vinilla and added 1/3 cup chopped walnuts to the recipe. Makes a great variation.

This is by far the best brownie recipe there is. My wife is one of the best brownie testers there is and she says they are the best. My wife knows her brownies.

I loved this recipe, a true chocolate lovers delight! I slightly varied the recipe by dotting 1/3 cup seedless raspberry jam by the teaspoonful on top, then swirled it into the batter with a knife. I also sprinked finely chopped walnuts over the top. Delicious!

Easy to make. Great with ice cream!!

These brownies were great! More like fudge than brownies, and I found that they were better if I reduced the sugar to a little more than a cup; too sweet otherwise! Very easy to make, which is a plus. Get really good bittersweet chocolate--it makes a big difference.

These are delicious, I cut down on the sugar using a little over 1 cup, maybe up to 1/4 cup instead of the half. Maybe next time I will try cutting down on the butter, but I was taught to always follow the recipie the first time and then improvise-so next time.

These were very good, however, I would definitely add nuts the next time around. Although I very carefully watched the baking time, I was disappointed that they did seem to crumble a bit when cutting them.

The best!! I only used half of the butter, and it turned out GREAT! Will make it again and again.

UNBELIEVABLE!! If you like chocolate, this recipe is for you. I made a batch for a BBQ cookout and they were gone within the first twenty minutes. So much for saving dessert for the end of the meal!

This recipe re-defines the word brownies. It's not only easy and fun to make, but toss in a handfull of crushed pecans and you'll have people standing in line, before they ever come out of the oven. A chocolate lovers delight.
