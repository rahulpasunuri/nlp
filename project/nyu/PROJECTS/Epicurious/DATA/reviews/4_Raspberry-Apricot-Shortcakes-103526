I'm confused. No raspberries mentioned in the recipe! ???

I too used scones (hazelnut scone recipe from this site) instead of biscuits, and substitued apricots with apriplumbs - it turned out so perfect!

I made this recipe one night and my boyfriend and I loved it. I used scones instead of cinammon bisquits and they worked fine.

This is a wonderful shortcake recipe. And the bisscuits are fantastic the next morning for breakfast....No need to bother with the gelatin in the whipped cream...it makes it more work than it needs to be...simply make regular whip cream. I've made and served twice and everyone loves it!!!!
