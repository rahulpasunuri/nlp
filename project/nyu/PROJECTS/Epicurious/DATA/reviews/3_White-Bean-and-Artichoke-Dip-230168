Based on all the reviews, and the fact that I wanted a low fat dip, I adapted this recipe as follows: 1/2 can canellini beans, juice of one lemon, 1 can drained artichoke hearts, 1/4 t. white pepper. 2 T. low fat greek yogurt. I liked it very much this way. It tasted like the classic artichoke dip without the mayonaisse. Next time, I may add 1/4 cup of fresh grated romano cheese.

The key to making this a great(ish) recipe is to use one can of beans and a 12oz.jar of MARINATED artichokes. Add a bit of the marinade, some olive oil, 1T lemon and the fresh rosemary as others have suggested.

This was OK - definitely would halve the amount of beans used next time I make it. Used fresh lemon juice and doubled the garlic, which probably helped amp the flavor, but the consistency is a bit bland and weird.

This was about a 4 1/2 out of 10. Overly lemon-y, and as another cook said, just an odd, kind of incongruous combo of flavors. When I made this, along with a peanut dip and stuffed mushrooms for apps, this was the only thing left over at the end, and that's got to mean something.

Have to agree with HarvestMoon. Have made this twice now because it sounds so promising, but proportions definitely need tweaking. Bland and strange as is.

BLECH! I do not like white bean and artichoke dip Sam I am! When I read the ingredients of this recipe I thought they would make a very fine dip, but it just didnt fly.

I made this for a party, and the women loved it. I added a bit more garlic and just a teeny bit of olive oil. I served it with toasted pita bread brushed with olive oil and garlic salt. Very popular for a low-fat item!

I made a few changes--used 3 cloves of garlic, only 1 can of white beans, and used about 1 tsp dried tarragon instead of rosemary and S & P to taste. It was delicious served with crostini, and healthy too!

Easy & delicious - I doubled the garlic and added 1 tablespoon of olive oil. I also used fresh rosemary.

I liked the dish, but I also think the white beans overpowered the other flavors in the mix. If I make it again I'll go with a 1:1 artichoke:white bean can ratio.

Don't know what happened to my review below! What I meant to say was that I thought two cans of beans was too much and overpowered the flavor of the artichokes. The second time I made it, I used only one can of beans. I also did not have rosemary on hand and so I used italian herbs and it was OK too. I kicked up the garlic also. I think this goes well with pita but not with celery or carrots, as suggested. I served it for my book club spread atop crostini and sprinkled with a hint of parmesean cheese and it worked well.

I like this recipe but I think two cans didn't have just rosemary on hand and that was OK too. I thought this went great with pita bread and the second time, I served it with crostini. But my book club friends all agreed that it didn't pair well with celery or carrots as suggested.

Excellent dip, but I only used 1 1/2 cans of beans and added about 1 T. olive oil. Everyone raved about it.

This dip is fantastic! Make sure you use fresh lemon juice. Trust me it makes a big difference in any recipe. For a little more kick you can add another clove of garlic.
