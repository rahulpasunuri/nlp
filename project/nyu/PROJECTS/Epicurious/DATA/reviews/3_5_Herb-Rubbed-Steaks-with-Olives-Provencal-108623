This recipe is good, but i think there was some missing info. 1st off, read the whole recipe before planning to do it--you are supposed to marinate the steaks for at least one hour. since i didnh't bother to read that part and was pressed for time, i only marinated for 25 minutes. it still turned out well, but probably would have been even better with longer marinating time. 2nd, my butcher is an old fashioned italian brooklyn butcher, and he told me you cant get "6 oz 1 inch thick" tenderloin, its one or the other. so, i went with 1 inch thick, and that turned out fine. next, when you boil the olives, its unclear how much water to add. i went with just enough so the olives are submerged. it also is not clear whether you should get pitted or unpitted olives, and i suggest pitted whole olives. you can even get what they call "provencal" olives in many stores. lastly, 4 minutes a side does not produce a medium rare steak, it produces a medium-well steak. if you're ok with that, then great, but if you're looking for medium rare, i'd have the stove on high and go with 3 minutes/side. i served this with a simple spinach salad with currants & brie. overall the meal was good.

Made it for my husband's birthday and he loved it. Delicious! The salty brine from the kalamata olives really livens up the meal. Very pleased with the outcome.

Not a 4, but definitely a keeper. An easy, low ingredient (with most of them in your cupboard) recipe that tastes great. I added a lot more olives, and used Filet Mignon instead.

Good but not four forks. I used kalamata olives but think a green type olive might work too.

I made this recipe twice. It is very good and a friend that is not a big meat eater liked it also. I also tried adding a little chipotle in adobo sauce. A unique blend, but turned out well.

I love olives, and this was great -- I used closer to one cup, and it was a good amount for two of us. Tenderlion is not my favorite cut, and this sauce would be great with any steak.
