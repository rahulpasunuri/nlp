I've made this time and time again...love the taste of this with penne pasta and seared fish. I don't use anchovies (for my family's sake!), but I think it would go well with the recipe. Chop the parsley thin!

For a typical tomato salsa alternative, this one is good. My friends ate it all up, but i think next time, i'll put more anchovies and lemon juice in it for my own taste. It does lack a little kick considering all the flavourful ingredients.

I liked it but added more anchovies. I served it with grilled chicken in pita bread.
