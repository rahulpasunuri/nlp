If you want the flavors to blend quickly just add all ingredients except the mayo & lemon to the shredded chicken and toss. Let it sit a few minutes then mix in the blended lemon/mayo. That way it only needs to rest about 30 minutes. Dried tarragon works fine too.

Following previous reviewer's suggestions I poached the chicken (I used tenders) in chicken broth and added a couple sprigs of tarragon and a few lemon slices. I also finely chopped the chicken to help absorb the flavor of the mayo mixture. Lastly I served the salad on croissants for personal preference. My husband raved and it is just as good the next day (maybe with the addition of a bit more mayo). Definitely a keeper.

Not that I need to write a review to talk about how great this recipe is but I thought I would add the changes I made out of necessity of avoiding a trip to the store. This is the best chicken salad I've ever had. I had all the incredients except....fresh tarragon...so I used a dried mixed herb with terragon in it and 2 TBLS of tarragon vinegar. I had this on croissant with lettuce. Actually I tried with everything and I didn't like it with tomatoe? I love tomatoes somehow it changed the flavor for me? I can't wait to try this again with fresh tarragon and I will. I did hand shred the chicken. I think that extra step makes a difference.

This was a huge hit with my family and friends! I made it for a small get-together with some friends and family and my mom loved it so much, she requests that I make it every time we have a family picnic. I have made it with pre-cooked chicken pieces from Trader Joe's and by boiling the chicken myself with Tarragon in the water and we like it much better when we cook the chicken ourselves. Also, I found that shredding the chicken by hand instead of cubing it, even though it took longer, allowed the chicken to be more evenly distributed.

This is really delicious and looks very nice when served on marble rye bread. I followed the instructions exactly and it was very easy. Will definitely make this again!

i followed the salad recipe exactly and it was excellent. my mom and dad emptied the bowl in three days. i would never have thought of putting fresh squeezed lemon juice in chicken salad.

Pretty good, quick, easy weekday meal. I only gave 3 forks because it lacked zip as written. I added cayenne pepper and garlic, which made it delicious.

Delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I used Greek yogurt with the mayo (1/2 and 1/2) to cut the calories, and I served on whole wheat wraps instead of rye bread. Mouth-watering, fresh, and super-tasty, and I loved the fresh tarragon with the lemon. And if you are not familiar with Greek yogurt - it is NOT like American yogurt. It's strained, so it is thicker, and it is not nearly as sweet as typical yogurt. It makes a fantastic substitute for sour cream, mayo, you name it. But with a nice reduction in the calories!

This recipe makes a chicken salad sandwhich come alive. I usually dislike the ones I've tasted and tried. This however adds enough flavour to disquise the "left-over" taste of cold chicken, yet make it sing!

I took another cook's advice and poached the chicken in broth, lemon juice and tarragon and it gave the chicken a fabulous flavour. I didn't have red onion so I chopped a green onion and used that instead. I also used dried tarragon because I didn't have fresh. I put the chicken salad in a whole wheat wrap with some romaine lettuce and chopped tomato and it was delicious. This will be my new chicken salad recipe. The tarragon and lemon add just that extra boost of flavour that regular chicken salad just doesn't have.

This is my go-to chicken salad recipe. It has everything I want in a chix salad: tarragon, mayo, celery, onion. This is what chicken salad is supposed to be. It's extra good if you don't screw it up by adding nuts and fruit!

So simple, I was surprised by how good it really was. Small tweaks: I used shallot instead of red onion, and made homemade pita chips instead of using bread. Definitely a keeper!

The chicken salad alone deserves five forks, it is divine! But when I used the recommended rye bread, it wasn't very good. I made these last night for the first time, using fresh Bolillo rolls (I think French or Ciabatta bread would be great, as would pita bread or as a wrap). But I used rye with the leftover chicken salad for lunch today, and it was a HUGE disappointment. The rye stomped all over the delicate flavors of the lemon and tarragon. I'll definitely make it again, but will skip the rye bread.

I made this for a bridal shower! Everyone raved about it....I made it the night before, so it had time for all the flavors to mix. The day of the shower, I cut tomatoes in half, scooped them out and filled them with the chicken salad! Not only did they look teriffic they tasted great too!

I love this recipe. I am asked to serve it each year for our spring scrapbook marathon. I add cranraisins and toasted pecans. I also serve it on sourdough. We love love love it. Check-out the lemon garlic potato salad to serve with it. That is marvelous too but add extra garlic and lemon.

I am pregnant with my third baby! With this baby my cravings have been more healthy than in the past, but cravings still the same. I have been disappointed with the results that I have gotten. This however, I just finished making and let me tell you it is delish. I can't wait for it to sit for a while. I did add some garlic and red wine/ tarragon vinegar, and more lemon than called for. I added green apple as mentioned earlier. If my chicken salad craving continues this recipe will become a staple in my home.

My son, a graduate of the CIA (culinary inst. of america) has me make this for his visits every summer. The tarragon,citrus, flavors blend well and when served on cold on a hot summer day, is perfection. We serve on lettuce or croissant.

I made this for a luncheon and offered bread for those who chose to make sandwiches. Most did not. I followed the recipe very closely except for the chicken. I purchased lemon pepper roasted chickens from the deli instead of cooking chicken breasts. Very tasty.

This salad was excellent. All the ingredients worked really well together. I did make some changes on the second go round; instead of celery I use fresh fennel or anise if you prefer. It complimented the tarragon very well. I didn't have a red onion so I used white and it worked out well, however it took away from the dishes color so to make up for it I added capers which turned out to be a really good choice. I would definitely recommend poaching the chicken in chicken broth instead of straight water. Me personally I also added a lemon peal, fresh tarragon, chopped green peppercorns, garlic, bay leaves and red pepper flakes to the broth. It gave it an extra kick. I also shredded the chicken (personal preference) and am thinking about adding pine nuts on the next go round.

It's not boiling... it's poaching. And I add some tarragon, salt, garlic, and lemon zest to the poaching liquid. It mirrors the flavors of the dressing and really adds some punch. I've made this many times, and every time it gets raves. Rarely make it on sandwiches though, mine is just served on a bed of greens.

The tarragon and lemon balance beautifully with the flavors of the chicken and dill rye bread. My husband and I like this much more than tradional versions of chicken salad sandwiches. Make extra. There won't be any leftovers.

This was fabulous! It is definitely the best chicken salad recipe ever. I could have eaten the entire salad by myself. Try this recipe.

To our taste, lemon zest (vs tarragon) is what made this good. We used 1/4 cup low-fat mayo with 3 cups poached/chopped chicken. Frankly this wasn't quite enough when also "vegged up" with a cup of chopped celery, 1/2 cup grated carrot and a chopped Granny Smith apple. Will keep experimenting for magic combination.

I have been looking for a good chicken salad recipe for a long time, and I think I finally found one. Like many of the other cooks I too added some green apple, but other than that I stuck to the recipe and it turned out great.

I thought this was a nice alternative to traditional chicken salad. You have to like tarragon however since this is the predominant flavor (not overwhelming though). I simmered the chicken in chicken broth with bay leaf and shredded it as well.

I cooked the chicken in chicken broth (instead of water). I agree that this dish got better after the chicken took in the lemon and tarragon dressing. This was a hit (in fact, one member of the family had it on lettuce for a salad lunch and again for dinner on pita bread.

I needed a quick and easy appetizer for an engagement party. This chicken salad stuffed into hollowed out cherry tomatoes that have been dusted with pepper and salt and then drained was just the ticket! Make sure you slice a little bit off the bottom of the cherry tomatoes so they don't fall over. You may also want to dust the tops with some chopped browned almonds.

I thought this was going to be a reguluar old chicken salad recipe, but the flavors were defintely extraordinary and tasty! I used the breast meat from a chicken I roasted (rubbed with a butter, lemon, tarragon mixture). I used choux pastry puffs instead of rye bread for a more elegant look. Yum!

I made this for a large gathering of people and got rave reviews. The lemon and tarragon aren't particularly innovative when you think about it, but it's a solid staple that has a bit of gourmet flair. I think it's best after chilling 6+ hours so the flavors have plenty of time to blend.
