This is our second time making these. . We made 1.5 times the recipe to use 1 full can of pumpkin purée and froze the waffles we didn't eat. Delicious, not too sweet. Used a regular, not Belgian, waffle maker. They toast up nicely in the toaster. The one-year loved them too.

These are delicious and easy to make!

These were great!!! I separated the eggs and beat the whites to a soft peak to lighten them up, and swapped out one cup of the flour for whole wheat. Do not akin the step of putting them on a rack in a low oven! This crisps them up, and will let you serve everybody at once. I used a regular waffle iron because that's what I have, and they came out fine.

These were excellent. I topped them off with a homemade caramel sauce. My husband and little boys were ecstatic!

The flavor was very good and made the house smell like fall. The waffles were too heavy and filling.

I have made other "savory" waffles from this website, and they tasted flat. So I took a risk, and added one tablespoon white sugar (to half a recipe) We were quite satisfied with the results. Not too sweet, and tasted more like a waffle should.

These were a hit with my entire picky family. The waffles came out tender and very flavorful, the spices were just right. My kids recognized the pumpkin pie flavor but were surprised to hear there was actually pumpkin as well -- a hint of nutrition to go along with all the butter and eggs.

These waffles are fantastic! To serve, we cooked toasted pecans in syrup, with a little butter! Awesome!

These are great savory waffles that fill your home with pumpkin aroma as they bake. They really got me in the mood for Thanksgiving! I wouldn't change a thing. I was reading some of the other reviews and got the impression that some people were expecting a sweet pumpkin pie type of flavor. The pumpkin flavor in these waffles is definitely more subtle. If that is what you are looking for bake a pumpkin pie or pumpkin cheesecake. I'll bet they would be delicious with a scoop of butter pecan or cinnamon ice cream too. http://michaelbeyer.wordpress.com/

I cut the recipe in half and since I didn't have light brown sugar, used cane sugar with a scotch of molasses. I also used all buttermilk (and the buttermilk was powdered). We also used a basic pumpkin pie spice, which seemed to lack oomph and need more ginger. The actual batter was moist and unctuous, but it lacked flavor so we added 1 tsp orange zest which really helped to kick it up a notch. Next time, I'd use fresh ginger for more of a bite and will include the orange zest again.

Wow! I made these for my family as a fall breakfast and they were a huge hit. I don't have a Belgian waffle iron, but they were still wonderful. Just put the waffle iron on a high setting, add a small scoop of batter, and don't skip putting them in the oven. I added a whole can of pumpkin and added extra spice. The were amazing with my special poached pear recipe, which you can find in my recipe box. Superb!

They were ok. But there could be more pumpkin flavor and more spice. Here's another pumpkin waffle recipe that I'd recommend - http://pumpkinwaffles.wordpress.com/ultimate-pumpkin-waffle-recipe/

I followed other reviewers and added the full can of pumpkin and the taste was divine. However, it didn't have the crispiness that I desire from a waffle. I'm not sure how to change that because it does have a whopping amount of butter that should have been the remedy. Perhaps with pumpkin it is impossible. But this was a tasty endevour with whipped cream and maple syrup!

Excellent! Added toasted pecan pieces which were great. There are only 2 of us in the house, so we eat a few that day and freeze the rest, then toast them every morning for breakfast during the week. Fiance loves them with Trader Joe's pumpkin butter spread on top, I prefer whipped cream. Mmm.

Sooooo yummy! I up the spices a bit, but otherwise make these as directed. It makes enough for the two of us to eat for breakfast all week - what a treat!

Rating: 3
These were great and so easy. I followed earlier advice and added a whole can of pumpkin and the flavor was great, not overpowering. I also used dried buttermilk since I didn't have fresh and it worked out great. We really like firm waffles and not soft, so I set my waffle iron to medium for a crisper result. Terrific smell, flavor and appearance!

We love pumpkin in our house, and this fits the bill for a delicious and easy Saturday morning treat!

I've been working on these and have made some big improvements to the sogginess and lack of distinct pumpkin flavor, so check out http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/PUMPKIN-WAFFLES-ULTIMATE-PUMPKIN-1270615

I've made these in a regular waffle iron and they turn out just fine. My all-time favorites--I'd make them more often, but I have one oddball kid who doesn't like pumpkin spice ANYTHING.

Great waffles. It takes a while for them to cook thoroughly, but it's worth the wait. I added a quarter cup of granulated sugar to add to the sweetness and incorporated candied ginger to the batter for spice.

Rating: 2
they were good, but they were awesome when we added more pumpkin and threw them in the oven right on the rack at 300 to toast up a bit. we didn't have the belgian waffle maker though, so perhaps you can skip that step if you have one.

Awesome! We beat the egg whites, then folded them into the batter. Next time we are adding nutmeg, and will toast pecans to sprinkle on top with the syrup.

Nice texture but the waffles had very little pumpkin flavor.

Delicious, easy, great fall breakfast! I separately mixed the liquid and dry ingredients separtately the night before and threw them together with the melted butter in the morning. Will make again and again. By the way, these waffles were not "heavy" but certainly were more filling than my standard waffle recipes.

I make this recipe for brunch often. Everyone always raves about them. Pecans are a nice addition and I add more pumpkin for more flavor.

Great waffles. I messued up end ended up using a while can of pumpkin, now I do that every time. It makes the pumpkin flavor very strong and the waffles very moist. You may have to add a bit more liquid to get the right consistency.

Loved these waffles. Had to make my own buttermilk (1 tbsp add to 1 cup milk), and they were great.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. I changed the dry ingredients to 1 cup unbleached flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup oatbran, 1/2 cup stoneground cornmeal and the results were fabulous. Definitely a keeper!

These were delicious and a new Thanksgiving tradition, but definitely short on salt. The next time we'll add more, perhaps doubling it.

Oh-so-good! I liked them with homemade whipped cream also. My dad and brother thought they were great too. It's a keeper!

These waffles were terrific. As written there is a nice balance of pumpkin/sweet/spice/waffle flavor. The texture was also very good. I recommend that you cook your own sugar pumpkin rather than using canned for superior flavor. The waffles took about a third longer to cook in my Belgian waffle maker than a plain buttermilk waffle. These will certainly go on the Thanskgiving breakfast table.

I used 1 c. spelt flour and 1 1/2 cup all purpose. Turned out well.

These were quite good if eaten right away, but after putting them in the oven as suggested to keep warm, they deflated and looked more like pancakes!

We ate at Cafe 222 last fall and we loved these waffles. They taste almost as great at home. There won't be any leftovers to freeze.

I have make this twice in the last couple of months. It is excellent. If your waffle iron suggests you wait for the steam to stop escaping I would suggest you not cook them quite that long and let the oven finish them off, they are wonderful and moist with a crispy exterior when done this way. Make them all up and let them cool, freeze them and treat them like any frozen waffle in the toaster, not as good the second time around but still a great quick and delicious breakfast.

I made these for breakfast on Christmas Day (with a peach compote recipe also found on Epicurious) and they were great! Sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with warm syrup they were quite a hit! I crisped them in the oven which worked well.

Rating: 3
I tried a regular waffle iron turned all the way up to the darkest setting. Still needed crisping time in the oven. flavor was excellent. next time will try the recipe with a belgian iron. worth doing again. oh-I also put out some finely minced crystallized ginger with butter and pure maple syrup. great flavors!

I couldn't get these to crisp, but they were delicious anyway.

I really liked the flavor of these, and the smell in the kitchen was wonderful! It was hard to get them crispy enough though. I finally turned the "crisper" setting up all the way on my waffler, and they were great. Next time, I want to add some raisins and/or dates to the warm maple syrup topping.

These are wonderful! I substituted 1/2 c egg nog and 1/2 c milk for the 1 c milk--tasted great. They make the house smell like pumpkin pie.

I have made these a couple of times for family and friends and everyone has raved about them and asked for the recipe.I made them again this last weekend and also served with a warm lemon sauce, that was left over from a spice pancake recipe I had made the morning before. WOW this is a great coupling. A "keeper" for us.

Rating: 2
These had a great taste. I didn't much care for the halfway soggy texture, tho. I guess it's because I didn't have a belgian waffle maker. Mine has fairly deep pockets, but it still isn't a belgian waffle maker. I'll try these again to see if they are more crispy in the belgian waffle maker.

Lo and behold, we found this recipe because we were looking for something to compare to Cafe 222's delicious pumpkin waffles. So, with 2 waffle irons rolling at our last brunch, we pitted this recipe against a standard waffle mix. In the end, this recipe stood high atop the podium. A generous dollop of whipped cream and pieces of cut fresh fruit make these waffles complete.

The waffles were so moist and tasty. I added some vanilla. I would definately make this again.

A wonderful way to kick off Thanksgiving. Served these for a neighborhood holiday breakfast using a regular waffle iron. They were crispy and delicious, even my fussy kids liked them. Served them with homemade hazelnut butter. Won't wait till next Thanksgiving to serve them again.

These waffles were a great way to use leftover pumpkin. I used my thinner pizzelle/waffle iron and I found that they were probably crisper than the Belgian waffle iron since they were thinner.

These were great for Thanksgiving Day breakfast. Since I was using a Begian Waffle maker, I separated the eggs, then beat the whites and folded them in - Don't know if it made them more crispy than otherwise (as they were not crispy) - but they got good reviews.

Served this for three pumpkin lovers and they liked them...but told me to keep looking for a better recipe. I did put them in the oven as suggested and they crisped up a little but they still have a pumpkin bread/cake texture.

the concept and flavours are great, but these waffles are not crispy. tasted more like pumpkin bread. definitely better than plain waffles but not as good as the lemon-poppy seed waffles on this site which are *awesome*

This and the "Nesbitt" cornmeal waffes are the two best recipes I've tried. If they are not crisp enough straight from the waffle iron, try placing them on the rack in a warm oven for a few minutes.

Rating: 2
The waffles tasted great, but were unpleasantly floppy. I varied the cooking time and temperature (and my waffle iron has multiple crispness settings) but it never achieved that lovely crispness waffles need. I'm open to feedback about possible cooking errors, otherwise this recipe is not a keeper for us.

Great flavors, didn't achieve the level of crustiness that I would prefer in a waffle, however, I would definitely make again!
