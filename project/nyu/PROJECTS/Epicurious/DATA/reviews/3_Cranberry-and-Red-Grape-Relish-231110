Made this for Thankgsgiving last year and twice since - tastes great and easy to make

I'm so glad I made this recipe before the CA reviewer's remarks were posted. This was VERY easy to make and it tasted wonderful. My wife who doesn't like cranberry relishes in general, loved this one! So did my 20 other guests (I made a double batch). Like any other recipe with few ingredients, make sure you buy the best available products - in the case of the juice - read the labels carefully and make sure you aren't buying sugar water with 10% juice added - get 100% juice.

I made the recipe as written and found it so sour that it was almost inedible. I ended up making a simple sugar syrup (epicurious recipe) and adding about 3/4 c. to the relish before I served it (which solved the problem). Also, I started with cutting the grapes in 1/2, but the pieces were too big compared to the cranberries, so I had to re-cut into quarters. Last, the juice needs to boil down at a full boil for nearly an hour. In the end, it tasted ok, but was more work than it was worth.

Fun and easy to make, and very tasty; a nice change from the usual can-shaped cranberry sauce.

A refreshing change from the usual can-shaped cranberry sauce. Easy and fun to make, and convenient, too, since you can do part of it a few days before. Something about the juicy sweetness of the red grapes combined with the chewy tang of the dried cranberries that made for a great combo. Highly recommended.
