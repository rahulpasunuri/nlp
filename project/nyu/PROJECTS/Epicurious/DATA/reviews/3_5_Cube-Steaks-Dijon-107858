I've made this recipe countless times since 2003. It's the best cubed steak recipe ever. I make no changes to the recipe. It's quick and easy for a worknight meal.

It was interesting, and I liked it more than I thought I would. The one thing I did differently was that I returned the steaks to the pan and let them cook awhile longer in the sauce. Usually when I have a recipe that calls for browning briefly on each side it's because the meat is going to be cooked more later, so maybe I didn't cook them long enough in the first place. However I think they came out better this way - the flavor of the sauce cooked in more and they were still plenty tender and not overdone. Way better than a boring stir-fry as per my roommates suggestion :)

Very quick and easy dinner. This is the best recipe for cube steaks. Added some mushrooms and skipped the sage, not a fan of sage with beef. Cube steaks can be really tough so don't overcook! The sauce is delicious especially on a cold rainy night.

Made it exactly as written except used chopped fresh sage instead of dried. Very Good sauce and it dresses up the cube steak nicely. I agree with other reviewers that the mustard is a little strong so make it as is for mustard-lovers only.

Really nice little recipe for cube steaks. I had to make some substitutions due to dietary restrictions and the limitations of what I had on hand. But the general concept worked well and was very tasty. We could even chew the cubed steaks! :)

Everyone commenting negatively must have overcooked their cube steaks. Sure, it's not filet mignon so why expect it to be as tender? The title reads "CUBE STEAK Dijon". We found this delicious and easy. These are some strong flavors being put together and it makes me wonder after reading some reviews of those serving this dish to their children under 2 years of age. Anyway...make the dish. It's great and easy.

This dish wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. I probably wouldn't make it again.

I've been cooking this recipe for a couple of years, and I find it quite servable on a busy or lazy day. My kids...who are 8 and 3... love this dish. I usually serve it with mashed potatoes and either sauteed brussel sprouts or green beans almondine. A definite comfort food.

As others have said, very good sauce, but it doesn't rescue the chewy meat.

You know, this recipe wasn't bad...it just wasn't really great, and most recipes that I cook from epicurious are great. If I ended up with some cube steak that I didn't have plans for, I might make this again...otherwise, no.

I would make this again but would only use 1TBSP of Dijon Mustard. At 2 TBSP this was overpowering to the sauce. Otherwise a good way to kick up nice and cheap cube steaks!

I agree with a previous reviewer that the sauce is quite good but that didn't save this dish for me. I felt bad because I'd told my husband I was sure he'd like this even though it had a fairly thick sauce on it (not his thing) and then he ate all of his while I pushed mine around on the plate. I'd love to try the sauce on something else though.

This was tasty and definitely easy. I used white wine instead of vermouth. Okay for a casual meal.

I laughed at the "lipstick on a pig" posting and thought "how pretentious," and then I tried the dish. The sauce is very, very good, but I have to agree: the piece of meat is not anything you'd want to serve to guests or even especially serve to the family on a weeknight. Stick it in a crockpot with cream of mushroom soup and onion gravy mix, and it's quite serviceable. But perhaps skip on this preparation.

Made this last night. HOLY COW!!! This dish was far better than I thought it would be!! I really impressed my husband and my 19 month old son ate it too!! I didn't have the stone ground dijon and used the regular too. I also doubled the sauce and 2 Tbs was just fine. I also didn't have any white wine so I used Sherry and it was just great. I don't like mushrooms but added them for my husband - i picked them out. Wonderful!!!!!

I don't know of many comparable entrees as economical, speedy to prepare, and flavorful as these cube steaks. The sauce would be good on any steak, but with numerous other ways to prepare more expensive cuts, it might be wise to reserve the sauce for use only with this inexpensive cut of meat to dress it up. I used Vidalia onions instead of shallots. I agree with all the reviewers who said this is fine everyday fare. If guests are of the down-home variety, they would likely enjoy this simple dish too. This is for sure a make-again.

I used regular dijon instead of whole grain. I think this made it too mustardy. The shallots were great! Add more! I think the mushroom idea would be good too. If all you have is regular dijon, start with 1 T and go from there.

Wonderful. Definately add more shallots. Also great as leftovers between a couple of slices of bread.

wow! next time i'd do more shallots, the mushrooms as suggested and only use about half the cream. i also used a top sirloin that i pounded out.

Made this twice, the second time with boneless pork. Both were fabulous! My friends were so impressed!

This was so good! Definitely a great weeknight meal. I made the recipe as is so next time I will definitely add some sliced mushrooms to the mix. Can't wait to make this again!

I used pork cube steaks instead of beef. Also added red onions, fresh sage and sauted mushrooms to the dish. It was easy, fast and delicious. We had halved baby red potatoes as a starch. Perfect to catch the sauce. I think this would be nice with chicken also. Enjoy!

This recipe is one of my favorite meals to prepare. The recipe is quick and easy to make, even after working all day. The flavors blend well together, and the sauce is excellent. I usually double the recipe and have left overs the next evening. Wonderful recipe that will impress your family or guests. The meal tastes as if you spent a great deal of time and energy preparing, but not so. This is very easy. The meal is satisfying. I usually prepare a chicken flavor rice, which goes well with the sauce, and a vegetable. Your family and guests will ask for seconds (maybe even more). You will receive requests to prepare this meal time and time again. Highly recommended.

I cooked the shallots a bit longer than called for and slightly reduced the dijon. Also, I took another reviewer's advice and used white wine instead of vermouth. It was very good.

Since cube steak tends to be chewy, it's nice to know you can do something to make it easier to eat! Had a nice tangy taste and the sauce made a great gravy for rice or potatoes. My husband hates cube steak but really liked this recipe. Will make it again.

This was my first time using cubed steak. When my husband lost his job, I had to find more economical meals to make for my family. I was surprised at how much I really enjoyed this meal. It was very easy to make. My 20 month old daughter ate it and she doesn't like anything

Fast and delicious. White wine works well as a substitute for the vermouth.

This is the second time I've made this and it so easy, so cheap, so fast, and most importantly, SO yummy. Sure, not your everyday health food, but an excellent treat. I was out of sage, so I used rosemary, and it was still amazing. We sopped up the extra sauce with French bread.

I have to admit that I was skeptical when I looked at the cut of meat, but I'm glad I gave it a try. Great comfort food and quick prep!

Very good weekday fare - this is not an entree for entertaining. But it does make an inexpensive cut of meat (cube steaks) special for your family.

Putting lipstick on a pig always gives the same result. A pretty pig. I was going to serve this to guests but I'm glad I tried it myself first.

A very tasty meal which went well with the suggested broccoli. I personally did not like how the cube steak looked (looked kind of chewed up) so I just tenderized some top round instead. As always, a bit more butter than suggested can help here :)

Comfort food. Yum. Made it exactly as stated except cooked the shallots longer. Really was pretty and I doubled the sauce so could place the steaks over wide noodle that had some rich sauce on them. Easy to fix and fast. I definitely will make this again.

I used venison cube steaks for this recipe ... the mustard really complemented the flavor of the meat.

A good, cheap meal...never had cube steak before, interesting appearance and consistency.
