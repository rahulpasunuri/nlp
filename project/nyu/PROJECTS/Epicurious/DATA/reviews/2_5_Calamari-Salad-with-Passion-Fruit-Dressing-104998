excellent. A few suggestions: 5 passion fruit equals 1/2 cup of fresh juice. A dash of sesame oil and addition of some diced green chiles and jalepeno chiles was a nice addition. Also, we used bbq shrimp in place of squid.

When I used locally grown ingredients, including the passionfruit, the taste of the herbs and onions overwhelmed the delicate fragrance of the passionfruit. Try decreasing the amount of cilantro, onions, garlic, etc and instead upping the amount of fruit by adding fresh mango or another fragrant fruit with a nice texture. The mustard also was drowned out by the herbs. It might be nice to char-grill or fry the squid rather than boiling it if you can to take off the fishy edge.

Very good ..Did not have fresh passion fruits so I used passion fruit jelly from the Asia Mart... .....I tossed with organic butter lettuce, Cucumber, Avocado in thin slices and it was very, very, good!
