This is a winner! Don't be afraid to tinker with the ingredients outside of the basic filling; I used just hazelnuts with this one, and it was a hit. I'm definitely going to use this as my basis for my next pecan pie; I so appreciate not having to use corn syrup.

Made this exactly as written and it came out looking perfect, but taste is not very good. The bland-tasting hazelnuts dominate and the cranberries seem extraneous. Would be better with more walnuts and no hazelnuts.

HMMMM !!! I did two batches, one in a high pan and the second in a shallow one, the shallow came out much much better, crunchy and yummy. I did not crush the nuts and it did very good to the appereance.
