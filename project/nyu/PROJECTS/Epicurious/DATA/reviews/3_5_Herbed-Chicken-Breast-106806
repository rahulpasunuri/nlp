Yum!! Easy!! Great winter recipe for chicken. I only had boneless, skinless and this is a great way to keep them moist. I added thyme to mine and basted a couple times. SOOO EASY!

One of those easy recipes that can be adapted to whatever you have on hand and makes an easy weeknight dinner with minimal prep. Is it out of this world? No. Is it a great weeknight dinner? Yes. I made it with fresh rosemary and dried sage and thyme, and lots of garlic. I found at the last minute that I didn't have any chicken broth on hand, so I threw in a little white wine instead. Maybe I shouldn't rate this recipe because my version isn't much like the one written, but it was good. And I can see myself changing it up based on what herbs are available in my garden all summer long.

Simple, subtle, and lovely. It's worth getting good free-range organic chicken breasts for this. I especially enjoyed the way the aroma of the herbs was released when you sliced into the skin (particularly with the fresh tarragon).

Very simple to make and tasty. I made a few hours ahead and refrigerated it until I was ready to bake it. Company enjoyed it, too!

I'm not sure what all the hype is about. This recipe is average, and I found there was WAAAAY too much stock and fat leftover in the baking dish. The taste was alright, but certainly nothing I'd make on a regular basis.

What an outstanding and easy recipe! Baking the chicken in the broth makes it impossible to overcook. The chicken was high on flavor and low on maintenance. Great entertaining dish.

Absolutely delicious and quite easy. Followed the tip given by putting the tarragon and garlic underneath boneless, skinless chicken breast and the flavor came through beautifly.

Quick and easy. The herbs can be varied to suit different tastes or what you have on hand (I used dried herbs de Provence insead of tarragon). For lovers of roasted chicken, this is a delicious way to avoid the bones of a whole chicken, and the recipe is easily adapted to larger quantities.

Very nice. I used skinless breasts and tucked in thyme and garlic underneath, plus you did't need the oil, less fat.

I only had skinless chicken breasts, so I rubbed the olive oil and herbs on both sides. I also added a dried pepper mixture for a kick. They turned out perfectly--I will make this again!

Sounds like a good recipe, but in my neighborhood supermarkets, finding boneless chicken breasts with skin still attached is difficult.

Great recipe, very flavourful. Next time I would add taragon instead of parsley(I used Italian Flat Leaf) - I don't think that parsley added much to the flavour. I can attest as someone with very little time and cooking experience that this is an easy recipe.

The recipe was easy to follow and cooked up well. I too used the skinless breast and used low - sodium chicken broth. I used fresh tarragon and it was delicious. I will probably cut down on the garlic next time though.

This recipie is very quick and simple, yet surprisingly good. I doubled everything except the chicken and used a mix of both tarragon and thyme leaves. I used chicken breasts without skin so I brushed on the olive oil first then rubbed on the chopped herbs and garlic. Because I doubled everything, the herb flavour was a tiny bit too much, but if you follow the recipie as is, it should turn out great.

I couldn't get fresh herbs (or bonesless breats with skin) so I used boneless, skinless breasts and herbed both sides of each breast with herbs. I liked it that way fine, but fir a real treat, cut it up and mix it with some plain white rice for the perfect seasoning level.
