Like the rating above says, like it, don't love it. My family wasn't too impressed with this dessert. They have told to stick with the Kahlua dessert that I found on here instead.

MMMM! The mint flavor is a great change from ordinary brownies. The brownie mix that I found had walnuts in it, but that didn't matter. All in all this was a delicious dessert, although quite heavy and rich. But it is good! So a little bit goes a long way.

Very easy! I made my own pie crust though. Great flavor and nice presentation -- I will also try it without the mint.

I thought this dessert was very rich and attractive. It had just enough mint to be refreshing but wasn't overpowering. I liked the dense brownie texture.

Everyone who ate it absolutely loved it. However it doesn't need the pie crust, we found that the pie crust just took away from the brownie flavor. I would definitly make this again, especially since it was such a hit.

scrumptious dessert! complements steak well. drizzle some additional melted chocolate on the serving plate for extra flair, or for a more casual dessert, pair with breyer's natural vanilla ice cream.

I usually can't wait to make any dessert by Sarah Tenaglia. I think they are usually amazing. However, I was very disappointed with this one. It tasted like a dessert made with store bought crust and box brownie mix.
