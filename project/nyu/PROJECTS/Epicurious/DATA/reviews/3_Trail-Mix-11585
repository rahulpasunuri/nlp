Yes, dry-roasted, salted cashews make an excellent substitution for the peanuts. I include bags of this in the Christmas "goodie boxes" I put together for relatives and friends. We always have some around the house at Christmastime, too, and my four-year-old has finally quit picking the M&M's out and leaving the rest.

I LIKE TO ADD CASHEWS INSTEAD OF PEANUTS AND CHOW MEIN NOODLES ADD A NICE CRUNCHY TOUCH.

As a teen who loves to cook, this is one of my specialties! When I usually make it, I put marshmallows and teeny-tiny pretzels in. Next time, I think I'll add honey roasted peanuts, (my favorite!) instead of salted peanuts.

real creative! I could never have guessed opening some packages is all it takes to make trail mix.

I added sunflower seeds, diced papaya, and dried cranberries. Easy and a healthy snack!
