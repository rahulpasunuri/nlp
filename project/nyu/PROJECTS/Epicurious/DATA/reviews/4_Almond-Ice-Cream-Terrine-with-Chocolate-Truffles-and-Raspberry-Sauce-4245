Awesome!! Great combination of flavors. Made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit. Easy to make - just have to plan ahead to accommodate all the cooling time. Definitely worth every minute spent making this recipe!

I made this for a dinner party and everyone was blown away! One of my guests even works in the catering business and he couldn't believe it was homemade. It was well worth the effort.

Wow! This dessert was a huge hit! I made it for a crowd of 10 and there was nothing left. I did have a little trouble with the truffles in the beginning. They took longer to freeze than the recipe said. But, I used all of them in the ice cream and they were delicious. I put the sauce in a squeeze bottle and everyone helped make designs on the plates before putting the ice cream on. I made the terrine 3 days in advance and it was fine. I agree with the last comment: it is worth the effort!!!! Five-star restaurant dessert!

I've made this dessert once and plan to make it again for a dinner party this weekend. It is one of the most elegant and delicious ones I have made. The flavor of the almond ice cream is beyond compare. A lot of work, but well worth it!!
