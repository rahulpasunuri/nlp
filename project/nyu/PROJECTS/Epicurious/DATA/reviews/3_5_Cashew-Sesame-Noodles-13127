This is fabulous! I have made it over and over again. A wonderful side dish with grilled pork tenderloin or grilled chicken. It always a hit! It can be made in advance, and in fact, improves with doing so. In that case, add cilantro just before serving to preserve it's bright green color.

needed doctoring, like adding a cup of black tea, and 2 more teaspoons of sugar

I've served this dish countless times; always to raves and requests for the recipe. Do NOT add the water, it dilutes the sauce too much. I usually multiply by 1.5 since I always find the recipe provides not quite enough.

EXCELLENT! I made as directed except used less pasta. This was very good left over the next day cold. I will make this again!

I have been making this dish since the week it appeared in Gourmet in 1995. Howver I wish there was a way to make the entire dish ahead of time rather that have to cook the noodles at the last minute. Has anyone had success doing it all ahead of time?

A great easy meal. Use Japanese style buckwheat noodles for a more authentic (and healthier) dish. I stir fried some bell pepper and baby boc choy to put over the top and turned it into a main course.

I have been making this recipe for years, and just love it! I always add more pepper, and little to none of the water. This is great with cucumbers in a little rice wine/peanut oil/s&p dressing as a side, or even broccoli roasted with garlic, ginger, paprika, and a little oil, then topped with a few cashews before serving. Yum! I am interested in trying it with salmon, as a few people have sugested.

I used angel hair pasta broken in thirds before cooking, skipped the water, substituted a tablespoon of red curry paste for the red pepper flakes (we like it hot) and added water chestnuts (cut in half) as well as scallions and snow peas. Served it with cucumber and daikon radish salad with a light sesame dressing. Great light meal for two vegetarians.

I left out the water and used half the pasta. This was absolutely fabulous. I served it with sesame crusted fish and Asian cucumbers. Yum

these noodles are quick, simple and very tasty! i have made it twice with organic wheat soba noodles, and sometimes i cut the sesame oil with flax seed oil. perfect for a summer picnic.

I didn't have fresh coriander so I think my dish just turned out so-so. I added grilled salmon (marinated in 1/2 soy sauce, 1/2 maple syrup) and it was much, much better. The noodles were bland on their own but made for a good backdrop when I added the salmon.

this dish is great and so easy. i used thin soba noodles and added mushrooms, onions, and sesame seeds. a definite keeper.

Loved it and have made it many times!! I use Vietnamese medium sized noodles, add stir-fried zucchini, and fresh tomatoes. Mushrooms would also be good. My guests took home all the leftovers!

Loved this dish! It's easy to make for a dinner party since the sauce can be made ahead and just tossed with the pasta just before the meal.

I first made this for my extended family about two years ago. They all called me for the recipe within the next two months - I just has another call today. It is a family favorite; love the cilantro with the cashew sauce. We use either soba or whole wheat noodles.

Rating: 3
If you follow the recipe as printed, it is quite tasteless. What I do is ditch the water all together and only use 375 grams of pasta, I like to use whole wheat spaghetini. I have also made this dish with peanuts instead of cashews and ALWAYS get asked for the recipe.

This dish was very easy, very tastless, and 5 out of 5 people said throw out the recipe.

This recipe was kinda boring... nothing but noodles. I agree that more dressing is required and the flavor is good. Would make again if I added some Asian veggies.

Delicious! I will absolutely make this again.

Really enjoy this dish. I like to double the sauce quantity and freeze half, as it is nice to have on reserve for a busy day or last-minute entertaining.

A VERY easy dish to make! Didn't add coriander and added chicken that had been marinated in some of the sauce and grilled. Came out delicious. Aesthetically pleasing if served in a big dish, topped with the chicken and then chopped green onions.

As suggested, added more hot peppers, and used farfalle instead of spaghetti for ease of eating at an outdoor party. Next time, I would only use about half the pasta since it didn't realy have enough sauce on it for my taste when I used a whole pound.

The dish was gr8... I will definately make it again.. Only as suggested, we need to add a little more red chillies..

I was looking for something that was make-ahead and tasty, when I found this quick-dish recipe. The result was delicious hot or cold, took no time to make and even less time to toss together just before serving. As many have already mentioned, additions suited to your taste would add even more flavour, however, this dish doesn't disappoint as is.

Rating: 3
Easy and delicious! It's a nice twist on an asian peanut sauce. To get this recipe up to four forks, I would add some protein (grilled chicken, shrimp, tofu) and something crunchy ( e.g. bean sprouts and sugar snap peas) and serve it cold as a main dish. As a side dish it really overpowers everything else.

I've made this a number of times and add a great deal more crushed red pepper than the recipe calls for (about 3 X) to make this fiery hot for my husbands tastes. On occasion, I've also added cooked chicken and vegetables to make it a main course dish. Tasty!

I made two batches for a buffet party. One with long noodles and just a little was taken, the other with broken egg noodles, which was gone very quickly. I think the long noodles weren't easy to manuver. I mixed the sauce into the cold pasta at the last minute and it didn't look appealing. I think a little warmer may be nicer, maybe the cashew would melt a little..I definitely recommend smaller size noodles for a party. It was easy to make.

My only change was to loose the coriander-- it tastes like dish soap to me. I followed the suggesstion of using broccoli, and thought it was great.

This recipe is only 1 or 2 forks as is, but with some changes... well, here's what I did: I used rice noodles (thai, but I guess you could also use cellophane noodles), doubled the recipe for the sauce, and used toasted suflower seeds as well as the cashews. The last thing: I substituted broccili for the coriander (just the flowerettes, cut very small) and added a little extra oil and tossed just before serving. Okay, okay. I guess I changed a lot, but the basic sauce recipe is a very solid one, I just had to add my own touch! :o)

Excellent, easy, and different! I think the sauce to pasta ratio could be larger...so either use less pasta or make additional sauce. A great "make ahead" side dish!

This makes a great side dish as is. I've also used it as a main dish by stir-frying sliced pork tenderloin that's been marinated in a teriyaki sauce. One of my favorite summer recipes

This recipe is so fast and easy to make. It is a great side dish, or you can add some cooked chicken to make it a main dish. My family really enjoyed this dish.

These noodles were delicious and couldn't be much easier to prepare! I used fettucine and omitted the red pepper flakes because I was feeding the children, too. I served this with seared tuna and my husband and I couldn't stop eating!! I will make this one frequently.

this is easier than canned soup! and DELICIOUS! if you like sesame-oil in dishes and especially red pepper flakes you will love this dish. a perfect coating for japanese buckwheat (soba) noodles (spaghetti !?). i halved the cashews and it was still thick enough to coat.

I gave it to all my friends and everyone loves it ,too. I sometimes add precooked chicken or shrimp to make it a complete meal for me..

After a fruitless search for a more traditional chinese style dish, I decided to try this recipe. We (and our guests) have loved it. We've been adjusting the seasonings for our preferences (a little crushed chilli seems to go a looooong way) and have used it for a dipping sauce for teryaki marinated pork tenderloin. Oh, YUM!

To make this a main dish I added chicken and cut up pea pods for some crunch. Very tasty. Did not have pepper flakes and used chili powder instead- just the right amount of bite.

I found the recipe to be very bland. The sauce was too thick like paste. I also felt that you could not taste the sesame enough.My husband asked to throw it out and get a pizza.

This recipe is so easy to make and was very delicious. Next time I will add shrimp or chicken and make it as a main course! Yummy!

I found that 3/4 teaspoon of hot pepper flakes was too much, though my husband thought it was fine. Next time I'll use only 1/4 teaspoon. Other than the extreme spicy hotness of the dish, it was very good. I added stirfried vegetables to the dish to make it more colorful.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I've made it four times and found that is you use a little more of each ingredient than the recipe specifies, the noodles are more moist. I've served it for different groups of people and everyone loved it. You can also put the sauce on strips of grilled chicken or beef. It is wonderful!

i think this was good-just make sure you add the cashew sauce JUST before serving!

The real thing! Addictive! This is a keeper. Garlic chili sauce gives it a nice kick. A great main course for 3 with stir fired chicken in garlic and green beans. Dress it up with sprouts & red pepper for colour.

I make this recipe all the time. People absolutely love it! I add extra cilantro just as personal preference. Goes well with lemon chicken, or just about anything.

almost as good as the "cold sesame noodles" which i serve hot. fusilli picks up the sauce well in this easy mid-week recipe.

I made this for my family and it was really good. I do recommend using chinese style noodles, and not pasta to serve it with. Everyone in my family loved it. I would make it again and it was very simple. Just remember to re-mix it if you save some for another day.

Don't fail to try it with the pork tenderloin recipe in the same menu (Sept '95). Both are easy and delicious.

I made this last night, and am online right now printing the recipe for 2 friends who shared it with me. Simple and delicious, I will add this to my list of often made summer recipes.
