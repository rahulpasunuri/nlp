This is a good old Southern recipe, and just like my grandmother used to make. Most people either don't have enough experience with pastry, or bread making to do this recipe justice. To be successful, you have to make sure the lard is cold, your baking powder is fresh, and that you don't over work the dough. Remember one thing though; it takes practice to be good at any culinary feet, so just keep trying!!

Glad I read the reveiws. Followed instructions and used 3 cups all purpose flour (could not find White Lily in our area). Have tried several different biscuit receipes - this was the best!!!

I moved from Atlanta to the "North" - White Lilly flour is not available here, I experimented with different proportions of all purpose (Gold Medal) flour and found the texture is perfect using only 3 cups of flour, any more makes them too tough. I find these perfect southern biscuits and make them every Sunday, I rated the recipe 3 forks due to the adjustments necessary for the recipe to work with regular flour, with the adjustments they get 4 forks, also I use regular baking powder, I find it not worth the extra time to make my own.

Terrible. Needed 2 C buttermilk just to get some type of dough together. Author of recipe must not know good biscuts!

I baked them as directed at 500 degrees on an ungreased sheet. The bottoms turned out burnt and the insides weren't done. They were also really bland. Next time I will try baking them at a lower temp, and with parchment paper on the bottom of the cookie sheet. The texture of the outside was fantastic though.

This recipe is terrible. I've tried to make it twice and each time I have ended up with very flat tasteless biscuity hockey pucks. Don't waste your time with this one.

Finally an authentic buttermilk biscuit recipe that works in my hands! These biscuits were easy to prepare, the dough was simple to work with, and they turned out delicate and tasty.

This was a good biscuit right out of the oven, but not 6 hours later. I put flour mixture in fridge for a couple of hours before adding the buttermilk. I probably need to give it another shot. I did not make them 1/2 inch. I made the biscuits about 3/4 to 1 inch thick.

The texture of these biscuits is perfect. However, the flavor is not as great as other recipes I've tried. My favorite is from the Lee Brothers Southern Cookbook, which recipe requires both butter and shortening, and not just shortening/lard. Butter in the dough is needed for maximum flavor, in my opinion. I also added sugar. But don't get me wrong, you can't beat this texture.

For a buttermilk substitute, you can add a Tbl. white vinegar or lemon juice to a cup of milk. Let stand for 10 minutes. I combine that with an equal quantity of plain yogurt.

These were a huge dissappointment - they didn't rise, they were tough, and they were salty. I don't know what I did wrong - I sifted my flour, I chilled my lard, and I tried not to over knead... Not worth it.

I live in Italy and I cannot find the buttermilk, but I like the biscuits; how can I substitute it?

I ended up making two batches. 1st one, came out terrible. Over mixed w/food processor. Plus it was a very dry dough. 2nd time, I left out a cup of flour, was still a bit dry and mixed by hand. They came out better but not like I was hoping. I will probably not make these again. I also used less salt (my mom made these and she said they were salty)

I just made this recipe to go with honey baked ham for Easter. I love southern food...who doesn't? So naturally I was excited when I found this section on Edna Lewis and Mr. Peacock in Gourmet. I'm not a novice baker, but I am new to crust and biscuits. I was a little weary of trying this recipe. I used white lily flour and fresh, cold lard. What I got was a very tasty, biscuit that was moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The only disappoinment I had was with the height of the biscuits. They didn't rise that much from the shape they were in when I cut them out. They weren't tough, so I don't know where I went wrong. Maybe they were too close together. I will keep this recipe, and practice.

Used all the exact ingredients, came out soft with a wonderful texture. But I was worried about the oven at 500 degrees, I had to take them out a little early. Huge contrast on the browned parts and the tender white textures. I am always scared when working with dough in this form, so I would have like a little better instructions than "add lard", in one whole piece? But they came out good.

These are the perfect biscuits. For anyone who is not a southerner or not used to making biscuits, the more you handle the dough, the tougher the biscuits. Sift before measuring as instructed, you can substitute shortening for the lard, and barely mix the dough, a few turns is it, look at them too long and they get tough, rock hard, etc...just barely mix.

I too had high hopes for this recipe. When I read it I thought that it called for a lot of flour, I thought it was just my inexperience with biscuits. The result was dry,hard,heavy biscuits. I would love to know where I went wrong. I used fresh lard as instructed.

My southern grandmother died before I knew her, but her sister, my great-Aunt Lydia who lived 102 years, made every southern food imaginable. I loved them all. She just wasn't famous like Edna Lewis. I'm a lacto-ovo vegetarian, so there's no lard in my kitchen, but unsalted butter worked just fine. I knew when I rolled out the dough that they'd be good; it looked and felt like Aunt Lydia's dough. Mine didn't rise as high as the ones in the photo, but they were still light, flaky and wonderful.

Having never made biscuits before, I was somewhat leery. Could not get White Lily but found Arrowhead Mills pasty flour which is also soft wheat. The biscuits were great and rolling them out was the easiest ever. Will definitely make again.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but alas they were dashed with the dense results, maybe a northern girl just can't conjure the biscuit mojo. It could be that I couldn't find the White Lily flour and used Robin Hood unbleached white instead. Maybe straight bleached or mixing some cake flour in would make a difference? After adding the liquid, the resulting mixture seemed way too dry. I even used lard, but I remember reading in a NYT article about pie crusts a few months ago that said the usual lard you find in the grocery store (Snow cap, I think?) wasn't a very good product (what is there to compare it to?) and the author tried using suet instead with good results. I tried her technique for pies and created some fabulous crusts. If I get adventurous I may try it with the biscuits. My favorite recipe for biscuits is from "Cooks Illustrated" from a few years ago (July/August 2004) for Mile High Biscuits which has the same amount of buttermilk but less than 1/2 the flour, hmmm, maybe that's the secret, and neither Mr. Peacock nor Shirley Corriher (I had the same sub-par results with her biscuits and even used White Lily)are willing to disclose it!

Great recipe! As for the negative comments twds Gourmet regarding the recipe for home made baking powder, it is the very next recipe after this one on page 81. All ya gotta do is read...

Mabe I missed something... but I found these bicsuits very dense.

Wow, these are fantastic and easy to make! They remind me of the Tennessee biscuits my kids grew up on. I don't use lard so I substituted unsalted butter which worked just fine. I'll cut down on the salt the next time also.

Oh yah Baby! I have always used White Lily flour for my biscuits, and mix it half with unbleached King Arthur flour for my other baking needs. This recipe brings it up another notch from the recipe on the flour bag. I used cold crisco (I didn't have lard). Remember it sats kosher salt, cut it down if you use regular salt (I did). Use melted unsalted butter on the tops. I used cream for mine, I didn't have butter milk. Like someone else said "follow the recipe", don't over knead, if it seems dry add more liquid. Shame on Alicia for calling Gourmet sloppy, and this the best free site.

good - but salty - i used table salt and that was an error- pricking with fork is necessary to allow butter to drip in - and to avoid dryness - they are worth the extra work- best cooking in hot cast iron skillet- can do on bar-b-que

Where's the recipe for the home-made baking powder? It states that it follows, but it doesn't. Sloppy, sloppy, Gourmet!

I did not make this recipe, but I made the one on the back of the bag that uses heavy cream, oh my goodness, what tender, scrumptous biscuits, so I am sure that this recipe is wonderful. Also, for Thanksgiving I made a homemade poundcake using this flour and the crumb was perfect.

Strange. I halved the recipe but followed it exactly otherwise; it seemed dry going together, and came out flaky but tough and without adequate rise. Next time, I'll follow my instincts and add more buttermilk to get a moist dough that goes together easily.

This recipe makes fantastic biscuits, but it is so simple, you're going to be tempted not to trust it. Don't. Be sure the lard and buttermilk are cold, resist the temptation to overwork the dough, and you can't go wrong.
