I was not overly impressed by this. It was just OK and very easy to make. But not a wowing dish.

This was fantastic and super easy. My young daughter loved it too. Very fast to prepare making it fantastic for during the week. Served it with a miso glazed cod.

I love this recipe! I always double it and have also used it on quinoa. My kids request it all the time.

The dressing on this salad was really outstanding. I added green onions, sugarsnap peas and thinly sliced green pepper, and served with chicken and waterchestnut patties. I made extra dressing just because I liked it so much. I think there is no substitute for fresh ginger.

These are yummy! I'd add some vegetables like green onions, chopped water chestnuts, etc. If you add tofu or chicken it could easily be an entree. I didn't think it needed more dressing at all.

It was okay. I added some chopped green onions. Doubled the sauce. Also added a few chopped peanuts I had.

I made 2 batches of this recipe for a party and it was all eaten within 5 minutes! I've since made this again and everyone loves it. I also sprinkled sesame seeds on top and SHIRAKIKU Teriyaki Nori (shredded seasoned seaweed).

This tasted disgusting. The sesame oil overpowered the flavor of the ginger. I would not recommend it.
