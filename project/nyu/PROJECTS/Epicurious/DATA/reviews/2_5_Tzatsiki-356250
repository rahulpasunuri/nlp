why is the vinegar necessary? Most tzatsiki recipes I'm familiar with (even when served it in Greece) don't seem to have a vinegary taste. I added much less than the 1 c the recipe called for; won't use vinegar again.

I agree with others that the vinegar is out of place. It adds a sweet flavor, which might be good in some ways but mostly not. The shallot, on the other hand, is a great way to add aromatics without adding garlic. I still found the final to be too garlicky and muted it by adding more cucumber and yogurt. I doubt that I have ever made tzatsiki the same way twice. You always have to tweak it at the end. S&P help a lot.

I only used a tbl of vinegar. I can't imagine a whole cup either! The sauce turned out great! Our family enjoyed it with grilled lamb, and some lettuce all wrapped up in warm garlic naan.

I made this last night to go with the Spinach, Feta, & Pine-Nut Phyllo Tart. I followed the recipe, except I decreased the vinegar to about 3 tbsp. based on comments and looking at other recipes, and I used a whole head of garlic. It was fantastic but my family said the garlic was a bit much, so next time I'll do the 10 cloves as written. Excellent accompaniment to the tart.

no vinegar needed in tzatsiki

Perhaps there is a misprint in the recipe. The flavors were all good but the 1 cup of vinegar made the tzatsiki inedible.
