2 sticks of butter along with 1/2 lb of blue cheese and 1/2 cup of heavy cream. He has to be kidding!

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving! Everyone wanted the recipe. I used half the squash and apples, and 1/4 the stock, and it had a nice consistency and fed 10 people a first-course serving. The blue cheese is what takes this over the top, don't skip it!

Haven't tried the soup with the blue cheese cream yet. And will be subbing toasted pecans for pumpkin seeds. Divided recipe by 3 since I only had 2 lb. squash. Soup is not as thick as I'd hoped. Next time I will add less stock.

LOVED this fall soup! I had a 12 oz bag of cut-up butternut squash from Trader Joes, so significantly reduced all quantities by 1/6. I kept the garlic and celery at full strength. The blue cheese (which I melted with half and half) was the best part- don't leave it out!

Great soup with some alterations, or I should say that it is a great pumpkin soup, as I didnt make the blue cheese topping as Im not a blue fan. Alterations I made (after cutting the recipe down by 75%, I still have a 2/3 pot of soup left over): 1. No celery here in Warsaw, so I left that out. 2. No veggie broth here in Warsaw (and I dont eat chicken), so I left that out. And am happy I did. It would have been too salty otherwise. 3. No cider here in Warsaw, so I mixed water with a tablespoon or two of maple syrup to subsitute. I topped each bowl with a teaspoon of sour cream and a half teaspoon of balsamic. Came out great with the true mellow flavor of the pumpkin shining through.

Has anyone tried making this ahead and freezing it? I want to make it for Thanksgiving, but need to save time on T-day and make it ahead. thank you!

Wow, this makes a lovely tasting, excellently silky soup. I didn't make the sauce, but instead served with broiled polenta topped with blue cheese. Big yums. I reduced the recipe to a third--using one 2 lb. squash, 1 quart veggie stock, only 3 tblsp. butter, and the rest as divided by 1/3. I was suspicious of this recipe since there are absolutely no spices involved, but the sweet-tart flavorfulness is so amazingly simply right on.

this soup was so good. however, the proportions called for in the original recipe would make a ridiculous amount of soup (i mean, come on - a GALLON of vegetable stock?!). i recommend halving everything, and reducing the amount of butter to 2 tablespoons or so. but the technique and the blue cheese swirl are brilliant. will definitely make again.

Made this soup at Thanksgiving and it was a hit . . .very surprising the first time you taste it, which is what makes it so interesting.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but was very disappointed. It had lots of flavor, but the amount of butter made it nearly inedible for my family. I will probably try again, but cut back the butter to around 1 stick, at most.

I really changed this recipe to MUCH EASIER. I sauteed 1 rib chopped celery, 1/2 chopped onion and 1 large garlic clove, minced, in about 3 T butter. Added peeled, diced butternut squash (small one), 1 peeled chopped Empire apple, and 2 cans of vegetable stock. I forgot the cider (I only had juice but wanted to use that). Simmered about 15 or 20 minutes open, added salt and pepper (TOO SALTY!!!), and when tender, added 1/2 cup heavy cream and 2 oz of blue cheese til hot and melted. It was DIVINE. Even my fussy son liked it!

I really enjoyed this soup. Cut the stock in about half i think, and only used 1/2 a stick of butter. Salted to taste-barely any at all. A perfect fall soup!

i thought this soup was AMAZING! not sure why people are saying it was too salty, i didnt notice it at all. the only change that i made was to half the vegetable stock used. i think using the full amount would have made the soup too liquidy and, besides, my bowl just wasnt big enough!

Really good soup, but yes, to much butter and salt. I used half the butter and just some pinches of salt, and substituted the cider by half water/half apple vinegar, which gives a nice sour zing and helps to avoid the salt almost entirely. I also roasted the squash with a glaze of balsamic vinegar and brown sugar, gives it more depth, I think. And don't forget some pumpkin seed oil on top!

I made this soup today with a few minor changes. I used a 4lb. pumpkin, halved the amount of stock and butter, substituted chicken stock for vegetable stock, and added a hefty pinch of thyme. Also cut the salt down. I used half the amount of sea salt and it was still a bit salty (even with homemade broth), so would cut that down to "to taste" in the future. Otherwise, this recipe provides for a distinctive squash soup, one not seen often. Very delicious!!

The flavors are really nice but it is way too salty. I used only 2T of salt and homemade stock to reduce the salt and it is so salty I don't want to eat it.

This soup was terrific! I cut back on the butter as suggested then forgot to add the cream, but it was still smooth and rich. The kids weren't as enthusiastic as the adults, but ate it, without the blue cheese. This one is a keeper. Think I'll experiment with a different squash also.

Agreed -- this is a delicious soup. Lacking the "OMG" qualities to make it to four spoons, but very nice nonetheless. The pepitos and blue cheese are a very nice touch. Would make it again, but would first probably make the "Spiced Pumpkin Soup" also here on epi, which is outstanding.

this was an excellent soup - with a unique flavor profile to the typical squash soup. I also used only 1/2 stick of butter, and the soup was plenty rich and creamy. Also ran out of time so crumbled blue cheese on top and stirred so it melted in -- it was amazing. A keeper!

AAck! two sticks of butter?? Well, I only used half a stick of butter and half of the cream and the soup came out great. I'm looking forward to fall to make this soup more!

This is delicious and filling on a cold day. I cut down on the blue cheese a tad and the cream. I also used a half stick of butter with a little olive oil and never missed it. Which leaves this a very healthy soup.

Great recipe!All my guest love it!I didn't use the cream or milk and it was wonderful and very rich.Thanks

I hate it when people do this, but I did change up the recipe a bit to accomodate what was on hand. I used 1/4 cut butter, 2 apples and two medium onions, omitted the celery, garlic and apple cider. Pureed it all after long simmering, and it's possibly the best soup I've ever had. I used about 1/2 cup half and half with an equal amount of gorgonzola and swirled a small spoonful through the soup before serving. Awesome.

An exquisite soup. I followed other reviewers recommendations by reducing the amount of butter, and salting the soup to taste instead of using 3 T. Don't skip the blue cheese cream, as it is what makes it different from every other squash soup out there.

I recommend that you reduce both the butter and the vegetable broth by 1/2 if you attempt this recipe. To keep it healthy, I omitted the blue cheese with a dollop of low fat sour cream. Freezes beautifully.

I very much hate to leave a negative review, but I hope to save someone some squash and some effort. The garlic and onion flavors did not work here at all for me. I did like the ideaof mixing squash and apples with blue cheese cream, and might try that again with a simpler and less time-consuming squash soup base lacking garlic and onions.

I cut this recipe in thirds, and used 2 apples, and a little less butter. We loved it. It's a rich hearty soup, a real keeper.

I agree with missychane. In what bizzaro world would this recipe be consiered healthy?

Substituted acorn squash with good results. Make sure you use kosher salt, since it's so large and chunky, three tablespoons of it will taste less salty than three tablespoons of table salt. Try this with St. Agur bleu cheese. It's extremely creamy and has a great strong, but not overpowering, flavour.

I had never made butternut squash soup before and was quite nervous to attempt this, but it was easy and very delicious. I used two large squash and one small one, and two quarts of chicken stock and a scant 1/2 cup of heavy cream instead of 4 quarts of stock. I also used salt to taste, after reading the other reviews and realizing that 4 tablespoons is quite a lot. I also added cinnamon the apples as they were simmering which added a nice balance to the flavor. I served this on Christmas night to nine people and had lots leftover to freeze.

This was awesome! I cut the recipe down overall and I don't think that I added as much broth as the recipe called for. I also used milk instead of cream. The presentation of the blue cheese mixture was just like a restaurant! Good reheated too! I think that you could cut back on the butter too and not lose any flavor. I used the butter called for in the recipe.

This recipe is very delicious, with a smooth texture and great flavor after some adjustments. I think that there is an error in the amount of salt (4 TBSP!). This probably should have been teaspoons, or maybe 1 tablespoon. I ended up adding potatoes to the recipe to absorb the salt flavor, which salvaged the soup (then removed the salty taters). An additional squash also helped with the texture. I added the heavy cream to the soup, as well as a dash of curry. Our weekend guests at were very pleased!

This is a great soup but I believe the recipe is flawed. I can't imagine using 4 TBS of kosher salt - I used only 1. I also think the butter could have been cut down to one stick with no loss of flavor (I plan to do that next time). I used Swanson organic chicken broth instead of vegetable broth (my experience is that chicken broth lends much better flavor) and I reduced the amount down to 3 quarts and I should have reduced it to 2 quarts (halved the gallon called for in the recipe). As it was it was a very light consistency that did not support the drizzle of blue cheese (sunk to the bottom), so yeah, only use 2 quarts of broth. Having said all this, the flavor is really wonderful and the consistency velvety. Everyone loved it!!!

I made this soup for a lunch and it was fantastic. I increased the apple count, decreased the veg. stock and used hard cider. I also forgot to buy celery so used 1 TB. celery salt. I skipped the kosher salt completely. My guests were almost licking the bowls.

1. I like squash 2. I like blue cheese 3. We can remain healthy and still have some fun now and then. :) I went with the recipe as posted and loved it. It's a combination of tastes I'd never have considered. Three and one-half forks from me.
