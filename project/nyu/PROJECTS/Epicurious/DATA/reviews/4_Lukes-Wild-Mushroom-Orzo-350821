ok so I didn't follow recipe to a T - used ricotta salata shredded cheese (like mizithra, but less salty) and it was delicious - children at it too (1 and 4)

It was okay. I like it with rice better. It took a lot longer than 15 minutes, and more stock than called for. Won't make again

I'm thinking the folks who rated this so highly don't make a lot of risotto. To me, this is a cheap imitation. Risotto is so much bigger and better, and really not that hard. Also, the best thing about risotto is the leftovers and making risotto cakes. I might make this again, but only if I didn't have any arborio on hand.

Oh my ... This is gooooood! Simple in appearance but elegant in taste. Company-perfect, or enjoy it alone in your kitchen. I agree with the other reviewer that the truffle oil elevates the dish to a completely new level.

This recipe was very good, but a bit rich. I love truffle oil - I drizzle it on anything that I think it will compliment - but I'm pretty sure this is what made the dish too rich. Rather than eliminating it, though, I might instead halve the amount of butter.

This was a very delicious mushroom recipe and so fast to make compared to risotto. Will definitely make this again!!

Fabulous! I am not one to use recipes, but I've never made orzo before so I followed this one to the letter (with measuring spoons, even!) It turned out better than I could have hoped! I even learned a lot while making this dish: the note about mushrooms and salt, leaving the orzo wet at the end to prevent stickiness, how to use dried mushrooms. I sent the recipe out this morning to my nearest and dearest. It's a great one!

Awesome. Easy and satisfying. This is one of those recipes that gives you a great dish and teaches you how to cook better at the same time. Love it.

This was amazing. We had it as a vegetarian meal, served with simple steamed green beans and a crunchy bread. I followed the recipe exactly (always do that on the first try). I served with extra parmesan and everyone used some. Next time I will add more in during the final mixing. Do make the effort to get the truffle oil. I tried the dish before and after adding the oil. It was well worth it. We love risotto, I can't to compare this dish to Risotto, it is simply different. I loved that the pasta was light and silky, the whole thing was smooth and wonderful. Also that I didn't have to stir and stir and stir. I agree you should be careful with grit and the dried mushrooms. I scooped the mushrooms out of the soaking liquid and rinsed them before adding to the recipe. I also filtered the soaking liquid before using.

I thought this came out quite soft and gummy. I would prefer a regular mushroom risotto.

Wow, this one's a winner! I was unable to find the dried porcini and substituted with dried chanterelles instead. My vegetarian guests, who just happened to have a thing for mushrooms, were blown away. I will make this many more times.

Quite simply...an amazing hit and a perfect combination with grilled lamb. Made the first half in the am and did the last 15 mins. right before I served it to my guests. They couldn't stop talking about it...no leftovers!

YUM! I love mushrooms and this is a keeper. Can't wait to have this one again.

This was very good. My first time to use dried porcinis. It turned out well and was a hit with my guests. I'll definitely make this again.

Very good. I didn't have dried procini so I used dried protabellas, and fresh shitake instead of a mix of fresh exotic mushrooms. Amazing what flavor only 2 Tbs of vermouth can lend. Served it with rolled chicken breasts filled with ham/cheese simmered in white wine, and corn. Excellent meal, a new favorite.

This was an excellent recipe, but I offer one important qualifier -- make sure to strain the porcini broth and gently rinse hydrated porcinis before adding them to orzo, otherwise there will be a significant amount of grit in the dish. (Not quite sure why this wasn't noted in original recipe, as this is a pretty standard issue with dried porcinis.) And I agree with Carmellini -- the more cheese you grate on top of the finished dish, the better!
