My husband (the baker of our house) made these for a relaxing Sunday morning breakfast this morning. We served them alongside strawberry jam and butter to accompany a bowl of peaches and fresh ricotta. The rolls were light and tender and oh-so-delicious. We will make again, especially for lazy weekends when we have guests for breakfast or brunch.

Just used this recipe this afternoon. I'd say the rolls on their own are a little plain, they've got a really nice texture but I wouldn't say they wowed me. I'll caveat, I used 2% skim milk and only had jumbo eggs. As well, not owning a food processor or stand mixer, had to use the good ole arm to mix the dough. The strawberry jam they included definitely makes the rolls really great.
