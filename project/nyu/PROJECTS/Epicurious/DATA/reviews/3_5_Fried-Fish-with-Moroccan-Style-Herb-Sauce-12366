I prepared this recipe again recently, because it is so delicious. It made me long for the old Gourmet :(

Do not make with basa or pangasius fish, which is a white fish full of toxins from the highly polluted Mekong River in Vietnam.

My husband liked it but the herb sauce had too much tang for me. Those campy lemons! I won't make it again.

This was really good, the sauce was better than expected. I used fresh cod and thought it would have been better if I had steamed or poached the cod rather than frying it.

Perfect. Made the sauce early in the day and left out to marinate. Cooked the fish early and reheated for dinner. Yummy!!

We all, kids too, enjoyed this and would make it again. It's nice and easy to prepare.

this dish is deliciously exotic! loved it but i plan to decrease the oil or probably look for healthier vegetable oil as the dish is pretty oily.

You gotta love coriander for this one (which I do but my boyfriend does not so this recipe obviously got mixed reviews at our house). A delicious and easy way to prepare fish. I used fresh haddock. Fabulous flavor - I will definitely make this one again!

Easy and delicious, I was just a bit weary of the sauce though. I thought it might overpower the fish but it turned out to be fantastic. My wife and I both loved it.

The dish was great. It was so easy. My son's comment -- yes, let's have it again but with more sauce.

Excellent and versatile sauce. Suggestions: make 1.5 to 2 times the indicated amount for 1lb of fish. Try baking and serving the fish with thin mango slices on top - the mild sweetness goes very well with the sauce. Serve the fish coated thinly with the sauce with more on the side. I've tried this with halibut and butterfish and halibut was better. If you are used to spicy food (eg Thai), double the cayenne pepper or you'll find it a bit bland.

I really loved the sauce, but I recommend strongly that you make it at least a few hours in advance to really let the flavors develop. I am going to try using it as a marinade for chicken as well. Delicious!

Delicious and the whole family enjoyed it.

Very easy and tasty. I also baked my halibut -- with a little flour, pepper, and olive oil rubbed around. I didn't have any parsley, only cilantro, but it still tasted great. I didn't feel like I had enough sauce for the whole pound of halibut though it may have been because of the missing parsley. Next time, I will make extra. Went great with cous cous.

I made this with fresh cod and used lime juice in addition to lemon. The sauce is "to die for."

The wonderful thing about Epicurious is the opportunity to read what others think about a particular recipe. I still have my July 1991 issue of Gourmet, since I've never thrown any old issues away, and never considered making this particular dish until I read all the positive reviews. Tonight I needed something I could make in a hurry, decided to try it, and now can't believe what I've missed all these years. The sauce is terrific, and the fish (I used hake fillets) served with the Couscous Timables appearing in the same issue, made for one wonderful dinner. This is a real winner.

really good sauce, I did not want to fry the fish so I baked it (halibut), then put the sauce on just before serving. really good

I've made this twice in the past two weeks. The first time I fried the fish as per the recipe, but you'll discover it's really about the sauce, which is fantastic. Next time I just steamed the fish as I usually do and served it with the sauce and it was just as good. It's a nice sauce for fish, very flavorful without being overwhelming. And it's great to have another fast and tasty way to serve fish!

a note on other cook's comments: fresh coriander, or cilantro, has a completely different taste than coriander seeds, which are used in ground coriander. you can't substitute them, but if it tasted good, knock yourself out! i thought this would be a spicy sauce, but it mellowed nicely and was delicious with my grilled cod in a pita pocket.

This was a great dish. My entire family loved it and it was easy to make. Its unique to anything I've made before.

it was totally awesome. i am into foreign dishes and i totally fancied this recipe. i was scared from the ingredients that the sauce ight overpower the fish because i used tilopia but it was perfect and i loved it.

On 1/15/02 I submitted the following review:The ingredients originally had me skeptical but...WOW! We used catfish and it was really really good. I didn't have fresh coriander so I used a tsp of ground and it was fine. The sauce is pretty, too. This one is being 'saved to my recipe box!' 2 years later I am still making this dish regularly. The sauce is quick to make ahead of time, remix just before serving. (and make a double batch)The sauce makes the dish. Don't be afraid of frying fish-if your oil is hot enough every little will be absorbed into the batter and it won't be oily. Excellent with spiced carrots and couscous as another reviewer suggested!

We baked the fish rather than frying it. The sauce, not the frying, is the real winner in this recipe. You can use it on anything. We are going to try it on shrimp next. This one is a keeper

This recipe was not only a joy to make but it is something that is so easy and delicious. I have four children and not one complaint just wanting seconds!

It tasted fishy.

very good, I think it is best with a firm fish. I used halibut and scallops but I liked the scallops the best.

This was a fun dish to make. Even my extremely pickly 12-year old son loved it!! I had some pineapple chutney left over from Easter and we used that as a condiment for the halibut. It ended up being fabulous together. The family has voted on this becoming a regular dish every month. (The pineapple chutney can also be found in the Epicurious recipes.)

This is simple, yet impressive and, most importantly, delicious. I didn't fry the fish for health reasons, but instead pan fried it for a few minutes and put it in the oven to finish cooking. I used rockfish, which is a nice, mild white fish. I served it with epicurious' orzo with feta and cherry tomatoes and some steamed asparagus.

After visiting Epcot Center, my kids wanted me to make a Moraccan Dish. So I tried this and they went nuts over it! I've served it to family and friends and have had nothing but rave reviews. Its a snap to make and goes great with couscous and mediterranean-spiced carrot dishes. I always double the sauce so there's plenty to go around!

The sauce is excellent! Fish .. only so so .....

The sauce is what makes this here - I used fried catfish, but I think you could really use any breaded or fried fish or chicken. I would also double the recipe, this doesn't make a whole lot. Also, I upped the garlic and oil a little and added salt and pepper.

I used tilapia and was very pleased with the results. The sauce, which I plan on serving with other dishes as welll, was just scrumptious and went beautifully with the fish. So easy to make, too! Wonderful.

Made this for Catholic BF during Lent. I don't usually like fish, but even I could not resist this sauce.

I make this dish ALL the time. I love it! The sauce goes great on grilled fish as well.

This sauce is suPERB, and I even had to use dried instead of fresh parsley, didn't have quite enough lemon juice, and significantly reduced the oil! The sauce was so good that it made my yucky cheap-o (sauteed, not fried) catfish nugget pieces taste great. I plan to use this sauce on other foods too.

I used catfish after reading about all the deep sea overfishing - worked very well! this recipe is super delicious!!! I don't think you could go wrong with the sauce on just about any fried thing

This is one of those rare recipes that the whole family enjoyed immensely (the children even asked for leftovers!). This is a keeper, and is a perfect meal for company. Couscous is and ideal accompaniment.

When I was making the sauce I thought it was going to be more Mexican than Moroccan but what a pleasant surprise. This is a very exotic fresh tasting sauce. I served it with cubed sweet potatoes tossed with olive oil & cumin seed and roasted. This is a keeper - dinner party quality and couldn't be easier.

My husband is Maori and an extreme lover of fish - since I don't eat it very often I find it hard to make creative and tasty dishes for him. HE LOVED IT!!!! In fact, he told me I "do justice to the fish" - since he usually eats it raw, I guess that was a heck of a compliment!

Rating: 2
I'd be careful with the sauce if the fish is a delicate white fish type, which is what I mostly get here. It'll be fine with stronger-tasting or oily fish.
