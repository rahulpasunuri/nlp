I have been making these for years, and this year I tried using Bob's Red Mill Almond Flour instead of fiddling around grinding my own almonds. It saved time and worked perfectly - I did it by weight, and substituted 9 1/2 ounces of almond flour for the 1 2/3 cups of blanched almonds that the recipe uses for grinding.

I have to agree with San Francisco: nothing special here. I did give 2 forks for the fact that it is nice to find a cookie that isn't too sweet and does deliver a nice crisp when you bite into it. I'm not sure if I'll put this one in my Christmas boxes this year or not.

a good cookie, but nothing to write home about. maybe not worth the trouble of all the rolling, cutting, re-refrigerating, etc.

Made these last year and plan to make again. They are wonderful. I added chocolate to some of the dough, made some raspberry thumbprints. There's so much you can do with this recipe.

I have always loved these since I first made them, and they are always requested in my holiday gift boxes. I use a fluted cutter in an oval shape (kind of almond shaped.) Everybody always asks for the recipe and can't believe how easy it is! A good one to start shortly after Thanksgiving, freezes well.

I have been making these since the recipe was published & people RAVE about them. They are light and and packed with subtle almond flavor. I always dip into confectioners sugar. One hint, Roll on wax paper and freeze before cutting as dough gets soft quickly.
