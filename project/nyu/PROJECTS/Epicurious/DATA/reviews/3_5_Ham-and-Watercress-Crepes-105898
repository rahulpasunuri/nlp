I've never had a savory crepe and these were delicious! Unfortunately we only had spinach, still good, but the arugala or watercress would have been amazing. Really could use that peppery flavor to boost everything up. Loved them. We didn't even cut them, just rolled them up & ate as is. Used the left over crepes with nutella, perfect!

This is an excellent recipe for buffets and parties and I have made many times. I make as written using less butter, sometimes freezing if I need to do ahead of time. I use the watercress which I love - just time consuming to separate stems from leaves but otherwise an extremely flavorful and classy recipe for entertaining.

These were fabulous and very well-received. I made the crepes ahead and froze them but they cracked when I rolled them so I don't think I would freeze them again.

Just make sure you don't switch the meat to salmon AND add cumin! These were BAD. I came into the party just apologizing for even bringing them. It was really my bad, I'm sure they are good. Although I kept wanting my eggs to be crispy instead of the "crepe-y" consistency that they were. I do recommend a blackberry with the cumin though- those were delicious. The texture was still off enough to give it one fork and cross it off the list of things to make.

These are absolutely delicious! I made them for before a big meal and had to be careful not to eat too many and spoil my appetite! The combination of flavors is wonderful. I also like how you can make the (plain) crepes ahead - I did this and froze them the week before. Then I assembled them the night before and simply sliced them just before serving. Makes for easy yet delicious entertaining.

I'd like separate the fork rating and give 4 Forks to the crepes and 1 Fork to the filling. The crepes are lovely and I will make again for other dishes, but the filling was overpowering and not subtle, so probably won't make the recipe as given again.

This was an awesome appy; it was all I could do to keep my bf from eating them all before my guests arrived! Easy to prepare ahead of time: the crêpes freezer wonderfully, I made the filling a day ahead and then just assembled at the last minute and sliced as needed. I made a couple of substitutions that worked really well: I used 1/2 tsp each of cumin and curry powder, and once when watercrest wasn't available, I substitued spinach and cilantro. Thumbs up on the cilantro, it really complemented the cumin. A staple in my cocktail arsenal.

I hope to try this recipe next week. One thing I've read that stands out from all the reviews, is that Flour Tortillas especially La Tapatia Flour Tortillas or even the whole wheat which are an easy substitute to making the crepes,(no, I do not own stock, work for them, or have any affiliation) Arugla rather than Watercress works fine, get rid of the Cumin and use fresh herbs, and smoked salmon is a nice change to the thin deli meat slices. I loved the hint of softening the cream cheese in the microwave shortly before spreading. It does make a huge difference. I wish everyone a great holiday, thanks for all the reviews. With all the alterations, I know when I make this next week, I will have many to thank for the wonderful comments about the flavors and textures of this easy to assemble treat.

I loved the base recipe and steps involved, but changed the fillings. I used goat/cream cheese, basil, sundried tomoatoes with thin deli roasted chicken slices; then ham with apricot jam/cream cheese spread, chives, watercress (no cumin). These were easy, done in 2 days as the recipe suggests. The crepe recipe is good and easy; I stirred the chopped parsley in so it didn't all turn green. It's needed to give the crepes interest.

Delicious. I substituted neufatchel for the cream cheese (softer and easier to spread) and cut the butter.

This was easy and tasted wonderful! Every last roll was eaten. I used green onions instead of the shallots (since that's what I had) and rocket insted of the watercress (since I couldn't find watercress). It tasted great with the minor changes - the rocket gave it a nice peppery bite.

I microwaved the cream cheese to make it more spreadable, my crepes also turned out on the green tinged side, not bothersome though. I think this would also be good with any other combination of ingredients such as turkey or other meat and various spices added to the cream cheese mixture as well as greens in place of the watercress, I used arugula for it's spicey flavor. Not a hit with my kids.

I've made this before with the crepes and fresh herbs (instead of cumin). Made again using tortillas and the cumin and cilantro....loved it. Although good with the tortillas, wish I'd made the crepes........they are so easy.

Absolutely one of the best appetizers out there. This has become a standard potluck dish. The crepes are incredible merely on their own, and the cream cheese stuffing is great. I loved it with the cumin, it added that little twist which made these so unique. Haven't tried it with fresh herbs, as one reviewer suggested, and don't know if I'll ever get around to it; I am so happy with the recipe as it is.

an excellent appetizer that will appease the hunger without ruining the appetite. this is also cheap and very easy to make.

I thought this was a really good hors d'oeuvre. I used the cumin in the cream cheese and I really liked it, in the future I will use a bit of fresh ground cumin in the crepe batter and play around with the fillings such as shredded pork. I used the arugula but only because the water cress looked bad at the market. the peppery taste of the arugula went well with the cumin cream cheese. I made the crepes a week ahead and they froze well, and assembled the day of the party. My guests ate them, but I didn't have anyone comment on them specifically, so I will serve again, but not as a main appetizer.

I attempted to make the crepes, but they were a disaster. I don't think it's possible to just "try again" if the first one doesn't work out. Too bad, because the mangled crepe I did get was delicious. Like others, I used tortillas, subbed argula for watercress, and used a combination of green herbs (rosemary, thyme, oregano), etc. I made them in advance for an hors d'oeuvre before Swiss fondue on Christmas Eve and found that I had to use toothpicks to secure them once cut. They were a total hit, however, and were gobbled down in a matter of minutes. Definitely would repeat.

Combination of flavors was delicious. Instead of crepes, I used lavash (much easier) which was perfectly acceptable although you have to watch out for slightly dried out lavash as it won't roll well. This is so good and easy to make, I will keep on file for future parties.

I made this very easy and fun recipe for a Holiday Open House last year while living in Chicago and they were gone in seconds! This year I am living in Italy and made them again. Can't get watercress here so I used arugola! Wow! Amazing! I think they loved them even more. The arugola gave the crepes a much needed flavor boost! Good luck! Merry Christmas.

Awesome, Awesome recipe! If you make with crepes, absolutey substitute fresh herbs for the cumin. I used a mix of rosemary and thyme and stayed at the 1 1/2 teaspoon total. I purchased both Arugula and Watercress but preferred the flavor of the Arugula. I am going to try again with the cumin, but will just use tortillas. Seems like a better fit of flavors.

I was making several appetizers for a holiday party and myself and my cooking partner thought this one was going to bomb. It just didn't sound good but based on the reviews I decided to give it a shot. I too used herbs (rosmary, oregano, type, basil) instead of cumin). I also left out the butter by forgetting it in the microwave after softening it!! As another cook sugested, I used arugla instead of watercress. To my surprise, everyone gobbled them up. 15 guests and 15 minutes later. Gone. One frustration - I had a heck of time spreading the filling w/o ripping the thin crepe.

I'm in search of some impressive hors d'oeuvres for a baby shower and this is now on the list! It was my first attempt at making crepes and it's a very simple and tasty recipe that will be very easy to prepare while trying to make about 6 other hors d'oeuvres as well. I too substituted fresh herbs instead of the cumin and added some grated parmesan to the cream cheese as well. Very pretty and tasty!

This was a big hit at the party I brought it to, and presented very well. I used the arugula instead of the watercress; I sauteed the chopped shallots in a little olive oil, and I sprinkled some fresh herbs in the spread in leu of the cumin (not a big cumin fan). The only thing I might do differently the next time, is only use cream cheese and skip the butter (or use half of the alloted butter)--it was a little too buttery for my taste although everyone else loved it.

Many thanks to the cook from Pennsylvania for the flour tortilla suggestion! I simply ran out of time, and the tortillas made a perfectly suitable substitute. I intend to try this again with the crepes, and the smoked salmon- arugula combination suggested by another cook. Everyone enjoyed these -- including an adventuresome five-year old!

I didn't feel like making the crepes so I used soft tortillas instead. Very yummy and easy!

This recipe is great. Not quite sure what I did wrong, but my crepes turned out green. Still tasted great & was OK since I made them as an appetizer for Christmas. Am thinking about making them for a party this year.

Wonderful!! I have made these several times and they are always a hit. They are even better with smoked salmon instead of ham - and arugula instead of watercress. Yum!

This was very tasty. I used the black forest ham as suggested. The only change I would make is to cover the crepe with the ham, instead of folding it. When you fold it, then later cut the rolls, there is a big space of air where the ham was folded. Overall, a good recipe.

This is a great recipe. Had 17 people over for cocktails and appetizers. This was the first to go. Would definitely make again.

For a young professional male who never ever cooks, I though this was an ambitious undertaking. Despite the seemingly complex instructions, this dish was easier to make than expected. Furthermore, it was really the hit of the party, as everyone gobbled it up. I only wish I had made more.
