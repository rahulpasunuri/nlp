Im from Mississippi as well and I have never heard of frying catfish in anything other than cornmeal. Take "Southern" off this recipe. Ive got a bag of yellow cat filets at the house Im frying this weekend to go with some cold beer. Can't wait!

YUMMM! Somehow, at 42 I had yet to fry catfish, but this recipe gave me the nerve. No saltines in the house so, I used buffalo Doritos and veggie Ritz crackers with a sprinkling of thyme and black pepper

I agree with oldsage... I am from the south and am very familiar with southern cooking. This recipe is far from what I would call southern.

I am 69 years old, and have eaten food from around the world, but the primary cooking that I have eaten has been Southern cooking as I am a Southerner. I know of no Southern cook who would cook catfish or any other kind of fish using Saltines. This is NOT Southern Fried Catfish.

THIS MAY BE GOURMET FRIED CATFISH BUT IT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT NOT SOUTHERN FRIED CATFISH. I HAVE LIVED IN MISSISSIPPI FOR 43 YEARS AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT NO ONE FRIES CATFISH WITH SALTINE CRACKERS ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY NO ONE!!!! (CORNMEAL)

This is NOT Southern Fried Catfish, so it should not be called that. Southern Fried catfish uses cornmeal. Even the boxed mixes know this. Change may be good, So change the name to Northern Fried Catfish.

Yes, it is better and more traditional with cornmeal, but this is good. Change is good, once in a while.

I did not even attempt to make this. The true southern way to make ANY fried fish, but especially catfish, would NEVER be with saltines!The only real way to make southern fried catfish is with cornmeal. Any true southerner knows that.
