I thought this recipe was quite tasty. I poured the lime, basil and oil marinade over the fish and let it sit for 45 mins before baking. Thought it had great flavor that way. The salsa was great...a lot different from salsa I usually make with cilantro and garlic, . served it with a succotash recipe also from this website. Will make again

Filets took closer to 15 minutes to cook, probably because they were larger, with skin. Tomato salsa was lovely and fresh tasting.. still have cherry tomatoes and basil in the garden, so that was a plus. Served with baby greens and citrus as suggested, and brown rice tossed with toasted pignoli nuts, parsley, and lemon zest. A keeper!

I forgot to mention I added fire roasted corn to the salsa and it was fantastic!

This is a light dish that's rather basic, but tasty. I more than doubled the marinade and added chopped cilantro for more flavor. I served it with cuban black beans and warm corn tortillas, my husband loved it.

the salsa is fantastic. It reminds me of what's on the halibut over pesto risotto at Macaroni Grill. I didn't have jalapeno, so I used a LOT of black pepper and its addictive. Also used a bit more honey and lime as its winter here in NJ and the tomatoes were not what they would be in summer...

This recipe was awesome. The crunchiness and spiciness of the salsa was a great contrast to the texture of the snapper. I doubled the amount of oil, lime and basil to baste the fish. Be careful not to overbake the fish. Even my children asked for seconds.

very simple and delicious. I made this with salmon.

Although the taste of the snapper is rather simple, the cherry tomato salsa really brings this dish to life.

The recipe was excellent. Roasting took about 20 minutes (not 10) to get to the desired doneness - your oven may vary. The salsa is quite spicy.

For quick variation-omit honey and saute salsa ingredients in the oil for about 5 min.

Can't agree with all the rave reviews. This is only okay in my book. Used all fresh ingredients including right-off-the-vine cherry tomatoes but still not impressed.

I thought this dish was amazing. I have made it twice in the last two weeks. The salsa is truly delicious and adds so much to the fish. The second time I made it, it was for my parents, and they made me promise I would send them the recipe.

The salsa is dynamite, and I'd make it again in a flash. However, between the jalapenos and the onions, I couldn't taste the fish at all. The textures were also sort of odd - the salsa is very crunchy if you use really fresh veggies, and the fish has the texture of baked fish anywhere. I tried it again and let the salsa sit for an hour or two to develop the flavors and mush down a bit, and it still didn't help. The salsa is a keeper, but I'm not sure if it really suits fish in general.

This is a great recipe. I added more jalapeno... very spicy. I also used the salsa with smoked grilled chicken breast. Had some left over and chopped in food processor with a can of canned tomatoes and used it as the sauce for a homemade grilled chicken pizza. Great!

The fish was okay, not too exiting in my opinion, it needs a little more spice if I may say so. But the cherry tomato salsa... wow! I never expected the salsa to be such a success. That salsa recipe is a definite keeper! I've done it three times with different dishes and people always ask for the recipe.

We loved this recipe. It was light and great for hot summer evenings. I accompanied it with a crunchy romaine, orange and jicama salad and roasted new potatoes with little herbs sprinkled on them. Deelish!

Incredibly refreshing. I made it with Tilapia filets. The simple dressing accents the taste of the fish nicely. Try it with black beans and rice as well.
