Made this for our Christmas party. It was a huge hit! I used rotisserie chickens from the grocers and followed the recipe as written with the addition of red grapes. Everyone asked for the recipe. I will definitely make this again. It's great as is, but I love pecans and will add them next time.

We felt like the chicken salad needed a little something, so we added extra curry and cooked up some bacon to add as well. We made the sandwiched with thinly sliced apples in homemade pita bread--yum!

This is a great chicken salad recipe. I add cashews and raisins. Also, I serve on hearty bread, toasted and spread with mango chutney, which really adds to the already delicious chicken salad. The sandwiches hold up well, I often make them to take when going on long flights. This recipe has become a staple.

Okay, but greatly improved with the addition of grapes and walnuts.

I made it for a small gathering of friends. The ones that normally love curry raved, the others enjoyed.

My husband and I make this all the time! It's absolutely delicious with garlic cous cous on the side.

I made this quickly for some friends that were coming over for a gathering and we all slathered it up. We couldn't stop talking about it. I am making it again now for lunch and am keeping this recipe as one of my favorites.

A delight. So easy, and really delicious. Next time we're adding red grapes to the salad along with some celery and maybe pecans. I like a bit more crunch. This will be part of the regular rotation.

I didn't have plain, so I used vanilla NF yogurt and used Dairy free, Red. Fat, cholesterol free mayo. Added cashews and raisins and served with Tandoori Naan with romaine! Incredible flavor!

Upon first tasting this sandwich, I declared that no chicken salad should be without red curry. This is a phenomenal, elegant recipe, which produces what is by far the best chicken salad I can recall ever experiencing. We always make this with homemade mayonnaise - often some that we've just made moments before. Today, however, we made low-cholesterol mayonnaise out of Egg Beaters, and I'm afraid I still adored the dance of the red curry and green onion amongst the cubes of chicken, in the marsh of yogurt and mayonnaise.

I ADORE this Recipe! I've made it several times, and I intend to keep making it. People always ask me for the recipe when I share my sandwiches with them - It's THAT GOOD. I do suggest buying one 2-pound roasted chicken and cubing the whole thing, then freezing half to make it again later without having to cut up the chicken.

I thought of this recipe as even less of a base and more of a general idea as to what to make for lunch. I baked my own chicken legs/thighs (cardamom pods under the meat gives a wonderful flavor), and added chopped golden raisins, cashew nuts, chili and cumin. I subbed roquette (arugula maybe in English) for the lettuce, and lots of frech chives for green onions. It was all dished up on Moroccan flat bread. The result, although far from the original recipe, was a big hit.

This is a great base recipe, but with a few added ingredients, it's wonderful. I chose not to serve it with the pita bread, but rather on soft sandwich rolls. I added chopped celery, chopped walnuts, and raisins, and it was delicious!

I havent tried it yet but wonder whether a little bit of cinnamon or a pinch of ground clove would round out the flavor.

This is an OK base recipe, but it needs doctoring. I made it as specified, tasted, and decided it needed something more, so I stirred in chopped apples and toasted walnuts. Better, but still a little one-dimensional. I think it has great potential, just needs a "wow" factor.
