I'm giving this three forks based off of my own additions to the recipe. Other reviewers are definitely right, as originally written this recipe is a bit bland. I added some extra ginger and crushed red pepper at the end to give it some kick. I also added some sauteed shrimp so I could make this a main course. I would have used toasted sesame oil and some other Asian flavored oil/sauce if I had had it on hand. I will make this again though! The pineapple is a great flavor with the heat of the ginger and crushed red pepper.

As other reviewers suggested, I added cilantro but other than that, made as written. If you're expecting a stand alone meal type fried rice, this is NOT it, however, it is a very refreshing and flavourful side dish. I served this with jerked chicken and corn on the cob, with the rest of the pineapple on the side. Everyone really enjoyed the contrast between the ginger, cilantro and pineapple in the rice and the spicy jerk seasoning. Will be making this all summer!

thought it was good, but probably wouldn't have like it without my additions. -nama shoyu (soy sauce) -extra ginger -lots of cilantro -T of pineapple juice -thinly grated, sauteed shallots -toasted cashew pieces -topped with thinly grated fried shallots a really great take on rice that is pretty healthy, too!

Really, really bland as written. Double everything but the rice and add some cilantro. You'll probably need some soy sauce.

The delicate flavors of basmati, cilantro (which i added), sesame oil, and fresh ginger (not overpowering, as some claimed) were excellent. We paired it with the grilled coriander salmon with nectarine salsa and were not dissappointed.

for a complete meal, I very lightly roasted some raw, unsalted cashews and added them to the mix. delicious!

I really enjoyed this! I would have given it a four, but I added some stuff to the recipe to give it my own flavor. What I did was added a little bit of fresh cilantro leaves when I added the rice. I ripped a few of the leaves and spread it around. I also added about 3/4 a cup of unsweetened coconut flakes. It was delicious! I served it with grilled churrasco, seasoned with "Laury's Hawaiian Sauce." Also, the recipe said that the rice turns brown as it cooks. It doesn't. It turns a very light yellowish-brown color; barely noticeable.

I thought the ginger and pineapple gave a powerful flavor to the rice. Be sure to add the right amount of salt to taste.

I was recently in Hangzhou, China and had a wonderful pineapple rice dish there. This was the closest recipe that I could find to that wonderful dish. I followed the recipe, except I added 1/4 c. chopped cooked shrimp. I added the shrimp and the pineapple while it was still over the heat and cooked it just a minute or two. I also omitted the sesame oil at the end. When cutting the pineapple, cut it lengthwise and hollow it out. Then serve the rice in the pineapple boat. The family loved it! It's a new family favorite.

This was a disappointment. Like all the ingredients, but it did not come together well or with enough oomph to make it worthwhile.

We made this on Sunday, and it tasted great. We used all the juice in the can of pineapples during the stir-fry process, though. I guess that helped solving the flavor issues most people have reported here?

I used canned pineapple (no fresh available in my rural grocery store), but other than that followed the directions as written. My husband and I liked it a lot. It is a lovely, fresh tasting side dish. It is subtle, but we didn't find it bland.

Very versatile. Served with grilled turkey chops, but can imagine lots of other options. Substituted brown rice for added texture and flavor. Also included pineapple and scallions to initial saute to bring out their flavor.

I cooked this for well past the 10-12 minutes suggested, and never came close to getting the rice to lightly brown; and, after all that trouble, found the dish really bland and uninteresting

This ingredients in this dish were not overpowering and it tasted very fresh. I'm making it for the second time to serve with a very delicious "island rubbed" pork tenderlion. I'm going to try using Jasmine rice this time.

I was dissapointed with this dish, but I used a wild rice blend and that was probably a bad choice. Also, be carefull adding ingredients to the smoking oil.

This was just so-so--even with a nice, extra sweet pineapple and fresh ginger, it was nothing to write home about. It's OK--I'm sure using canned pineapple and ground ginger wouldn't hurt it a bit, though.

This was really good! Nice change from regular fried rice. If you love pineapple, then you should definately try this dish!

So bland! I kept looking at this recipe to make sure I had followed the instructions. Even after I doubled the pineapple, sesame oil and salt, I still couldn't save it.

My food critic spouse loved this! I used a rice blend, white, brown, red and wild, that I had on hand, but followed the recipe closely. It was a lovely side dish and the leftovers were wonderful!

Used brown basmati rice and added ground pork for a quick one-dish meal.

I made this with basmati rice, fresh pineapple, and a touch of ground ginger. YUM! Served with grilled teriyaki chicken and pineapple-and-onion skewers. Added extra sesame oil at the table. Easy and tasty.

Made most of this menu over Memorial Day...everybody loved the pineapple in the rice. I used brown rice and it was just right.
