This made for a quick and simple lunch, though it didn't blow me away. I added a little more cayenne to taste, skipped the hardboiled egg and melted a slice of gruyere on each. Not bad.

I didn't love it. The crab and peppers comb is not my favorite.

I personally like things spicy so I added 1/2 tsp cayenne and put these on toasted mini pita breads instead. This is an attractive way to serve crab, and best of all, it isn't too labour intensive.

I need a bite size dish for a party. I saw mini english muffins once but of course I couldn't find them now so I put this on plain ol' ritz crackers and it was great! Chopped the peppers and onions very fine and grated the egg so it would fit on little crackers. I also added a touch of salt - to me the vegies and the egg just had to have salt. Made about 40.

Wonderful! I replaced the green pepper with jalepeno and added a bit more cayenne for a little more kick. I also used 8 grain english muffins.

A big THANK YOU to Marta Dailey (below) for the pastry shell brand name recommendation. This was my very first non-dessert culinary attempt. Very well received. All agreed pastry shells are the way to go. Dish itself is not enough for a main meal. (all right, you knew that). Definately will make it again, but either as a brunch item or with other side-dishes.

I did what a previous reviewer did and used Pepperridge Farms puff pastry shells. This was very good and relativley light. I did not include the egg because I don't like hard cooked eggs. Maybe they would have made it a little more harty.

This was just delicious. Everyone in my family loved them, including a pizza-eating teenage son and husband who says he doesn't like crab. I'll fix these again soon!

Sorry, this didn't live up to expectations. In fact, I found it rather bland.

I used this recipe this weekend for a party. It was very easy to make. I used the english muffins because I couldn't find pastry cups as another reviewer recommended. I think the pastry cups would make it taste better. It tasted great and made for great sandwiches also, but I would try the pastry shells if you have access to them.

This recipe works well with Pepperidge Farms puffed pastry cups. Prepare pastry cups and cool to handle. Stuf pastry cups with crab ensemble and bake at 350 for 10 minutes. Serve immediately. This recipe fulls 6 pastry cups. Excellent
