i concur completely with previous reviewers...and this involved a lot of prep work. my husband loves any bean dish, but he said flavors didn't blend--which seems funny...it looked good on paper. we usually have 3 people competing over dinner leftovers for lunches, but we couldn't move this dish, which is not a good sign.

I agree with the review that this is not good and it is not bad. The presentation is wonderful. I might like it better if the serving was smaller and I was enjoying it with a nice glass of wine and fresh bread. If the vegetables were cut differently and more dressing was used, it might make a great salad on a buffet.

This wasn't really very good or bad. It was just not very, I don't good. The beans were okay, but I had to add a lot of other spices. The vegetables roasted in the oven didn't really come out crisp...And then all the flavors that didn't really blend. won't make again. PS I really like veggie dish or vegitarian
