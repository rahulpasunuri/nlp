for vegetables that come equipped with their own great flavors, this dish is way over seasoned. crushed red pepper over powers the licorice-esque taste of the tarragon.

Light and refreshing - perfect for a quick and healthy summer meal. I did note that previous reviewers found it to be a bit bland, so I used plenty of salt and freshly ground pepper and added an obligatory sauteed onion to fill in the flavor. Will definately make this again.

This is one of those healthy recipes that tastes a little too healthy, i.e. bland. It was OK with some parmesan and more salt and pepper but uninspired. I always find it tough to mix long pasta with lots of diced things, which like to fall to the bottom of the bowl. With this dish, too much stirring or adding water and it gets mushy.
