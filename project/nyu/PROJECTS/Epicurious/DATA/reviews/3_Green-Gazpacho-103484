The only reason I didn't give this 4 forks is because it does need a fair amount of tweeking. First, the salt is a must-period. Next, you simply have to add avacado and way more cucs and basil. Also, this has to sit overnight as the flavors simply won't blend well. Just play with it and then you'll be quite pleased. The added benefit, it makes you feel energised and fit. I always drink this before a hike up the mountain.

This was good but not superb. Added a bit more cucumber, lettuce and green pepper than was in the recipe.

I used watercress instead of romaine, to give it more color and bite. Still delicate in flavor, but definitely not "bland". I skipped the bread step too. really not necessary. Good for those sweltering summer NYC days!

Disappointing, too thin, bland, truly lettuce soup. I added some cilantro salsa sauce I bought in Costa Rica to give it some zip.

Boy did i goof on this one. I mindlessly used olive oil infused with chilies and peppers and it was overpowering to the other ingredients. I did add more vinegar, salt, and garlic as suggessted by others. I liked it despite the added heat from the oil however it would have been right on target had i used plain olive oil instead. Live and learn.

I amended this recipe according to some of the previous suggestions by adding 5 tomatillos, juice of 1 lime, 1 tsp. sugar, 1 tsp. salt,and some cumin and cayenne. Then I added cubes of avocado at the end and used the cilantro as a garnish. I omitted the crab. It was excellent and received rave comments from my guests.

This is a totally refreshing dish, and especially wonderful on a hot day. I have made it 4 times each time a little differently and the recipie holds up with each incarnation. I am not a fan of regular tomato gazpacho, and this is decidedly different. The proportions in the recipe can be vague (this is unavoidable without giving some ingredients in weight, which would be inconvienient) so alter as you wish. I increased the amount of cucumber, and lettuce and bread because I found the onion too strong. One thing that is totally missing from the recipe is salt! I added a couple of pinches until I liked it. One might add a touch of lemon or lime. I served it with a lovely vegetarian pizza as a first course.

This is definitely a bit milder than tomato-based gazpachos, even after I perked it up by adding tomatillos, but the dish certainly has its proper place (I served it as an appetizer for a baked salmon course, which worked out nicely). I also used shrimp instead of crab.

Just doesn't have the "oomph" of the tomato based gazpacho. Just a little too bland for my tastes.

Perfect for hot summers. The only addition needed was salt, my guests raved as it was so unusual and good. I served it with French bread slices baked with olive oil and Parmesan cheese. Viola.

This was delicious! I made this minutes after picking the required vegetables from my garden. Didn't have sherry vinegar, so I substituted rice wine vinegar.I am going to make this again with some chopped, grilled shrimp. A wonderful change from the traditional gazpacho and cucumber soups.
