OHHHH MY GOD!!! This cake was incredible!!! The evening before Thanksgiving I decided to heap MORE on myself (haha!) and make one more dessert from scratch. I wanted to do a Bundt cake in my pretty Bundt pan and stumbled across this recipe. WOW!! Double WOW!! Yes, the frosting is NOT snow-white, but who cares? And to the reviewer whose friend is the chef and said the frosting is not necessary - I beg to differ! The cake itself was incredible, yes... but the frosting added an amazing sweetness to it, I cannot describe... After a day of sitting in the frosting, it was even better. Everyone RAVED over this cake and it was the first to disappear, over pumpkin spice rolls (two were made/brought), pies, etc. I can't wait to make this cake again... perhaps for Christmas... YUM!!!!

Love it! I live at 7,000 feet and have trouble with high-altitude baking. I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was perfect: tasty, moist, tender crumb. It will definately have it's place in my holiday menu from now on.

Made this for a potluck Thanksgiving. One guest remarked how pumpkin pie is his favorite and how he looks forward to it all year. Upon hearing of my pumpkin bundt substitute he was very dissappointed to say the least. By the time dessert was over he was asking me for the recipe!

I changed this up a bit, using butter instead of oil, and milk for the liquid. Very well received and long lasting.

We thought this cake was very good, but nothing special. It's moist and dense with a tight crumb similar to a pound cake. The spices are well balanced. I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. of cardamom and a teaspoon of vanilla. I baked mine in a tube pan and added a streusel topping which made for a nice presentation with the glaze drizzled over the streusel. Instead of the snow white glaze I went with a maple glaze. Took 73 minutes to bake.

Absolutely delicious. A guest who doesn't like pumpkin pie thoroughly enjoyed this cake. The glaze didn't turn out "snow white" but was still enjoyable.

I was really, really excited to make this cake. I love pumpkin and bundt cake. Sadly, this recipe did not deliver. You could see where it could have been delicious, but it was bland and dry though I followed the recipe exactly. I'm definitely making it again but next time I'm going to cook it shorter than the suggested amount, triple the amount of spices, and somehow make it sweeter. It was fine but the results weren't worth the effort.

Good flavor and texture to this cake. The glaze, however, is fantastic! Note: it comes out FAR from "snow white", even if you use clear vanilla extract. I used raw wild honey at the half the amount called for. This gave a noticable "honey" flavor that the family just loved. We are using this glaze on many other baked goods now. It's yummy!

DO NOT DO GLAZE!!!! It's perfect w/o the glaze...absolutely perfect. Even the celebrity chef I work for loved it but said not to put the glaze on it!

To "Cook from Richmond, VA". When was the last time you got your oven tested for temperature accuracy? Sounds like your oven wasn't hot enough.

I made the cake step by step and it came out Great. Moist and rose high, the icing stayed snow white unil I added the vanillaext, then it turned a light cream color, but I expected that. I did add cocnut to the top of the cake after I put the icing. Everyone LOVED it. I will be making it again!!

I made this with my 2 young children, after my daughter became intrigued on Halloween when she found out that you can actually eat pumpkins. This recipe is so incredibly easy and tasty. I used a 15 oz. can of organic pumpkin, which is probably just short of 2 cups, but it still came out perfectly. Next time I will try adding some maple syrup to the glaze. As one reviewer said, my glaze didn't come out perfectly "Snow White", but who cares, it's delicious!

Fabulous! Just made it for an Autumn bridal shower with the maple frosting and got raves. The only thing I added was some chopped walnuts along the top.I had to make several copies of the recipe for family and guests. A keeper!

This cake was a real hit over Canadian Thanksgiving. It came out very moist, dense, and flavourful. I substituted with whole wheat flour, less sugar (I used about 1 cup), and probably 1/2 cup more pumpkin than the recipe called for. The icing didn't come out like the picture, it was more of a glaze. Perhaps I made it too runny? All said, I will make this again and again.

Loved this cake! Quite a hit with my friends. I thought the frosting was very tasty (I added maple to mine), although I would make even more next time! Just add a bit more milk to make it runnier so it will spill over the cake better.

I made this cake last weekend for my son's birthday. It was a huge hit! We moved to the mountains 2 years ago and live at 3500 feet. I have had a tough time adapting recipes for cakes and muffins so I was very excited to find this already adapted for me. Definitely a keeper.

I followed the recipe to the letter and do a LOT of baking. I was unimpressed. The flavor was bland, the frosting had a weird aftertaste due to the honey (doesn't match the sweetness of the powdered sugar). The texture was good, it was nice and moist, it came out of the pan beautifully, it was easy to make. All of that said, I won't make it again and wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone else. Bon App desserts rarely disappoint, but this is one that did.

OK, everyone raved about the taste, but I have the following comments. A: I baked way past 65 mins. and still the tester came out soggy. I thought the texture was very moist and somewhat dense. I used a silicone bundt pan resting on a cookie sheet. Could it be that the heat did not rise up the tube properly? But can you put a silicone pan directly on the rack. b. The glaze, again, made exactly to recipe, came out more cream colored than snow white. I did not mention snow in describing the cake -- yellowish snow being a bad image.

Beautiful presentation but a bit too sweet for me. If I make this again I may cut the white sugar. Also, I didn't think it was pumpkiny enough, so I may double the spices and replace one egg with a little more pumpkin.

Made as written. Delicious spiced pumpkin flavor. My glaze was thicker than photo, which was prettier. As thicker glaze drips, use tip of spatula to nudge it down side of cake. 65 mins baking was too long. Next time I'll pull at 55.

This is certainly my all-time favorite cake! Everyone loves it...and it keeps for days. I have been making it for over 20 years...since I first saw it in the McCall's Cooking School series...

I made the 5,000 ft recipe since I'm in the mile high city. This was my Thanksgiving desert and was an absolute hit. I will def. make this again and not just at Thanksgiving.

This was an amazing cake. I used the 3000ft adaptation, and I ended up with a deliciously moist and light cake. I can see this being great for breakfast by leaving off the icing and adding raisens and toasted pecans. MmmmMmmm.

Yum! This was the best cake I've ever tasted! I would add a touch more cinnamon just for the sake of my taste. Otherwise, perfection. p.s. Do not cook more than 65 minutes.

This was great. I took a risk and made a gluten-free version with rice flour(!), which was very good. Since the recipe forces you to choose between using orange juice or milk, I chose orange juice, and it was quite dense enough. I wouldn't try it next time with milk. The icing with chopped nuts was a wonderful finishing touch. It's rich, so it can feed a lot of people, but it also will make a great coffee cake for tomorrow morning!

This cake was great, and very easy to make. I thought the glaze was superfluous, though - didn't add anything and was a little too . . . goopy. I'd skip the glaze, or cut the recipe for it in half.

This is a wonderful recipe. The pumpkin flavor comes through strong and is complimented by the spices. It's close to a pumpkin pie. The cake retains its moisture and the snow white glaze is delicious as it soaks into the bundt. It was very easy to make, and would be great for any holiday gathering, as it's so dense it can serve many people. I'm looking forward to trying the recipe again using buttermilk instead of the OJ to see how it alters the taste.
