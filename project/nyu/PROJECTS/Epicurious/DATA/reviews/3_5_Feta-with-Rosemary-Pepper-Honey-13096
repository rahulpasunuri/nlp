I made this for a foodies dinner and it was a big hit. It's rich you don't need alot of it, and it went really well with both a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and a Verdicchio. The pepper gave it nice spiciness but wasn't overwhelming. I didn't serve crackers with it but would try that next time - perhaps just table water crackers, or Carr's rosemary crackers?

This was very unique. I wouldn't call it delicious, but it made some extremely bitter feta taste good. The rosemary and the peppercorns give it a bit of a kick. I wouldn't serve this by itself, but it definitely deserves a place on the dessert cheese platter.

I gave it 4 forks because it is easy to make and the results are great. Instead of chopping up the rosemary I tied two small sprigs together like bouquet garni and steeped it in the honey. I garnished it with toasted pine nuts, rosemary leaves and additional cracked pepper. Next time I will only add 2 tbs water because the honey mixture was a little too runny for me.

so easy to make. I always include this dish at buffets or cocktail parties. A nice alternative is to serve it with wheat thins.

One of my foodie friends made this for a birthday party and it was a huge hit - the combination of the creamy feta, the pepper and the honey are remarkable. Especially when paired with a Reisling. This makes for a terrific appetizer or twist on the cheese course.

I made this when asked to provide dessert for a dinner party. All of the guests (except a couple of the husbands)are great cooks, and we all enjoy trying new flavors and combinations. If I could give this minus forks, I would.
