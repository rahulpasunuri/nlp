I made this for Thanksgiving mornign brunch. The only cahnge I made was to sprinkle some chives onto the second layer as it was cooking. This was a really simple, good way to highlight caviar. However, my husband is not a fan of salmon, so the salmon roe was a bit too "fishy" for him. Next time, I will probably use a real caviar (beluga or sevruga).

Very interesting, although next time, I'll add fresh herbs sprinkled into the eggs as they cook. Also, I made this in a square, non-stick griddle pan rather than a small round pan. There was almost no waste, and the rolls were all the same thickness. It was fun to make, in a silly sort of way, with all that rolling of paper thin egg layers. Made me feel like Julia Child.
