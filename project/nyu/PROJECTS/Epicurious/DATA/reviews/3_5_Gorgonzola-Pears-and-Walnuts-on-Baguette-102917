Advice to use riper pears is a good suggestion. You can also get a creamier result and even more interesting flavor by combining some cream cheese with the gorgonzola.

We make this recipe every autumn. It is amazing- the perfect combination of flavors. I highly recommend this recipe!

Made this on a francese roll instead of baguette.. would not wrap it in foil so as to toast the bread more if I did it that way again but a baguette would be better anyway. More than 5 min is defintely needed in order to get the center warm, though. Otherwise it's very tasty. We shared a half sandwich and bowl of soup since it's a little rich.

I prefer serving skipping the baguette, serving the pears and gorgonzola on lettuce (endive is great; romaine less expensive) and getting my calories from honeyed walnuts. You can buy them already honeyed or make them yourself.

Wow--I found the gorgonzola on its own to be too strong, but this sandwich was delicious. The cheese melds perfectly with the juicy pears and the nuts. Try it!

Will try this one again- but some words of advice. 1. use thin baguettes, or flatten them a bit- my sandwiches were a bit too bready. 2. Overripe pears with lots of juice might make this work and less dry 3. Kept sandwiches in oven wrapped for more than 10 minutes, and cheese was still not melted all the way. Will cook longer next time 3. Will try to press walnuts into cheese or bread, as many fell off while eating

Add some spicy mustard and prociutto and you have a great sandwich!
