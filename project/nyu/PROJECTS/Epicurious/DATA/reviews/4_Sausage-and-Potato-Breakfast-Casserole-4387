Hearty, delicious, feeds a lot of people, and easy to prepare. What's not to love? I double this because we love to eat the leftovers the next day. There is a ton of sausage in this recipe especially if you double it so be prepared to adjust to your own meat to egg ratio preference. :-)

I must have written a review 10 years ago about this recipe; it is fantastic and one that has become a family tradition. I have even made this out camping. The kids love this.

Yum! Made this for Christmas breakfast, and everyone loved it! I was looking for a breakfast casserole, and this was better than any I tried previously. I used the sage-flavored Jimmy Dean sausage for a little extra flavor, and followed the suggestions of previous reviewers to season potatoes and layer the onions and cheese in with them. I combined everything the evening before, so all I had to do Christmas morning was pop it in the oven. Will definitely be making this again!

This has been a family favorite of ours for years! I've made it for extended family and friends and it always gets raves. I do add the last layer of cheese 10 minutes before it is done to keep the cheese from getting too brown and crispy on top. I usually combine hot and mild sausage or just use hot sausage because my family likes it spicy. Also, I find that many people enjoy eating it with a side of salsa. It's a winner!

I was not as impressed with this dish as everyone else seems to be. It okay, but not in the least special. Maybe it was the sausage I used. Also, I would like the potatoes to be crispy on the bottom. When I reheated some for lunch, I put the portion in a non-stick skillet with a bit of olive oil and touch of butter. Crisping the potatoes helped somewhat.

My thoughtful sister Laura knows I don't eat eggs. She searched for a breakfast casserole without eggs and surprised me with it Christmas morning several years ago. What was equally surprising was how much egg lovers enjoy this dish. You better not dawdle or it will be long gone! She has used regular, hot and sage sausage and usually uses 1 1/2 bags of potatoes to make a 9x13 pan. It is now a family Christmas morning tradition and my sister Laura is a hero!

We have overnight guests often so I have a variety of delicious breakfast casseroles, frittatas, etc. in my repertoire. But, when I served this one for the first time this weekend, my guests said it was one of the best, scarfed it down in record time, and requested that I make it again next time. The only change I made was to brown the sausage and the flour for more flavor, which also allowed the sausage topping to get really brown and crispy in the oven - yum. I would lightly salt and pepper the potatoes next time as they needed a little seasoning. I made this on a Friday to be served Sunday a.m. and it held perfectly in the fridge.

I made this for a baby shower brunch and people seemed to like it. I read a few of the reviews that recommended salting the potatoes first. I did that and I regret just because I think the end product was too salty. Next time I'll stick to the original recipe. I used maple sausage and I flavored that well with minced garlic and onions and some other spices. I also used a total of 2 C of cheese. I assembled this the night before - with the hash brown frozen- and popped it in the oven a few minutes before the party. Easy entertaining...

I made this for Mother's Day brunch with a few alterations and it was wonderful.Changes were: i used turkey breakfast sausuage instead of pork. Used 1 tbls corn starch instead of flour b/c my husband has Celiac Disease. I added a bit of garlic powder and onion powder after reading reviews that the original recipe was a bit bland. Finally, I added 6 cracked eggs on top of casserole before baking. So, each serving had a baked egg on top. It was delicious! I will absolutely make this for the next brunch I attend!

I've made this many times, I've changed it up a little with whatever I happen to have. Maple sausage is great with it and I always season the potatoes with salt and pepper. Great when you have overnight guests since it can be made the night before, even two days before. I usually serve it with a nice sunny side up egg on top. Everyone loves it, it's also been called "good hangover food"!

this is awesome. I used cubed hash browns with a bit of onions. I had a good quality jalpeno sausage at hand, and it took the dish to the next level. I added some cayenne and some galic when sauteeing the sausage. Top with smoked gruyere and swiss. good for supper, breakfast, or any time really.

This recipe is a keeper! So easy to make, you can make it the night before and everyone loves it. I've made this many times for all different occasions and it's always a hit. I've used 1% and nonfat milk and it turns out fine. I've also always used fresh shredded potatoes that you can buy at the store now instead of the frozen stuff. This is one of my favorite go to brunch recipes!

I used maple sausage, no other ingredient substitutions, and baked it in three loaf tins instead of the 8x8 dish recommended. (I left one tin at home for the family and brought the other two to work. I got rave reviews from both audiences!) I assembled the dish the night before and baked it in the morning. What a versatile recipe! I can imagine subbing chorizo for the sausage and jalapenoes for the green onions for a Mexican version, or Italian sausage, basil, and parmesan for an Italian twist. For an Indian take, I'd use curried chicken for the meat, and perhaps even add a layer of cauliflower. Yum!

This was an absolutely awesome recipe. The only thing I did different was instead of using a package of shredded hash brown potatoes, I took a couple of potatoes and chopped them up really small myself. Turned out really great. Tasty, easy to make and VERY filling.

Made this for a Sunday Brunch for our weekend houseguests. Made the night before and baked in the morning. So simple and easy. Our local butcher makes our sausage. This is such a simple recipe and when I have more time I will try variations of this dish. FYI . . . Most of the guest went back to buffet table for seconds!

I don't understand why people write reviews of recipes they have not tried. True, this is not the healthiest breakfast ever but we can see that ourselves. This dish is so good! It is worth the splurge every once in a while. The recipe is always requested by someone. I have used low fat milk and it was fine - not as rich but still very good. I have also used turkey breakfast sausage with great results. It freezes well, too. I divide one recipe into two and freeze one for later.

Made this for Brunch today for weekend house-guests. It was wonderful and a success. I'm embrassed how easy it is and can be assembled the evening before, thus allowing me to enjoy myself as well! Didn't have time to try the suggested variations and grate my own fresh potatoes. Since I will be making this again I will try some different variations.

I have been making this for years and it is always a crowd pleaser. In fact, I have one in the oven right now, lol. The only change I mke is to use O'brien potatoes instead of shredded, sautee sweet onion with the sausage, and add a little garlic powder and crushed red pepper. I double it to take for a potluck, and I am always asked for the recipe.

This is an extremely tasty dish. I made it the day before--and also, I incorporated the freshly grated cheese into the potatoes and added s&p. Those tips by others were very handy. I discovered in the middle of making the casserole that I only had 2% milk but went ahead anyway. It worked just fine. Also, I used a hot breakfast sausage and it really gave it a bite. I also placed fried eggs on top and ohhh, that really made it special. This will be one of my regulars.

Rating: 3
Very good - crowd pleaser. I doubled the recipe and added 2 minced cloves of garlic, 1 chopped red bell pepper, 1 minced shallot, and a 7-oz can of mild green chilies (e.g., "Ortega"). I subbed turkey sausage, and it was fine. Will do with pork the next time.

Rating: 3
Wow, this was easy and the results were very good. I love a recipe with less than 10 ingredients. I doubled the recipe, but couldn't fit a whole 2lbs of hashbrowns in my dish (so more like 1.75lbs). I also mixed some of the cheese in with the potatoes to give them flavor. I used an aged extra sharp white cheddar. Everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
I find that this recipe is much better when I shred my own cheese vs. use the preshredded cheese. Also, it helps to mix the cup of cheese with the potatos so it melts through the potato. It comes out perfect this way! The recipe is always a hit and get served at every brunch I have.

Great recipe - everyone loved it! I used all of the ingredients, but instead of layering mixed them all together. I also put the cooked sausage through the food processor to make them superfine - so you can taste a bit of sausage in each bite - YUM!

Made this for a work-breakfast yesterday, and it was well received. Made it almost as written, although I did salt & pepper the potatoes as another reviewer suggested. I used a standard breakfast sausage (Bob Evans) Made the whole thing the night before, then just threw it in the oven in the morning while I got ready for work. Very convenient and easy. When I make it again, I think I'll also try fresh potatoes instead of the frozen

Awesome recipe! Have made it many times now. I usually double it and put into a 9 x 13 pan. I also add diced fresh red peppers and sliced mushrooms along with the green onions.

I didnt rate the recipe because i changed it a bit. used sliced red potatoes. just wish i would have seasoned them and used spicy sausage to give it a kick. added onions, green peppers and mushrooms to mix. good additions, but i think using real potatoes was my best decision (even though they needed desperately to be given some UMMPH with seasoning) just nicer and heathier perhaps to use real fresh potatoes rather than frozen shredded -- tends to remind one of denny's. Anyway, great recipe and can be modified to fit your liking. added some chilis too. and reduced fat cheese (felt like needed more cheese??!)but more cheeese is usually good, right!?

Since I was looking for something different than hashbrown and egg breakfast, I used thinly sliced baby red potatoes that I tossed in black pepper and parsley. Using skim milk and a couple tablespoons of sour cream in place of the whole milk worked perfectly. I topped it with sharp cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon which also paired nicely. We added scrambled eggs with ricotta cheese on the side and it was wonderful. We will definitely make this again to change up the normal breakfast routine.

This is a great recipe and especially with these modifications: use fresh grated potatoes, mince one huge sweet onion to saute with sausage, add mushrooms and green peppers if so inclined.

Great casserole. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and it was very rich (too much for my taste). The second time I used skim milk w/ a little lowfat sour cream, turkey sausage w/ a bit of olive oil, and about 8 oz chopped green chilies. It was still great... An easy recipe to modify, very forgiving. Both times I made it the night before and baked it in the morning.

this recipe was a bit on the heavy side for my tastes, so i made a few simple modifications to try and lighten it up a bit. don't kid yourself: it's still a dish that will stick to your ribs, but if you want to lighten it up a bit, these tips might help. first, i used breakfast links made from chicken. since the chicken was so lean, i added about a two tablespoons of olive oil, and one medium onion to the pan to add flavor, and keep the meat moist. i also added about half teaspoon of thyme, and 2 cloves of garlic. since i added the onion and garlic to the sausage, i disregarded the green onion. next, i used 1% milk mixed with just a touch of lowfat sour cream. the sauce thickened beautifully, so do not be afraid to add lowfat milk. i also used a high-quality cheese since i was not using whole milk. i think adding good cheese to this dish is a very important step in this recipe; use the best cheese you can find. all in all, the chicken sausage and lowfat milk worked great. the dish was hearty, but not too heavy. this casserole was a huge hit, and i will certainly be making it again.

Rating: 3
This could go with a couple of fried eggs and some fresh fruit for a really hearty meal. Lowfat milk worked fine for me because the sausage was plenty fatty. Added diced green bell pepper and diced grape tomatoes with excellent results. Needs freshly cracked black pepper on top before serving. Very good.

This is a great "do ahead" breakfast recipe. Mix it up, store in the fridge overnight and pop in the oven to finish. I keep my "gravy" pretty loose so it blends really well with potatoes, plus it thickens more in the oven. First time I made the gravy too thick and it was like a layer of dry potatoes and mush on top. I also mix my cheese and potatoes together to give the potato layer more flavor. A few shots of Tabasco adds a good kick too. I always get rave reviews with this recipe.

I cooked this dish for our charity breakfast event at work. It sold out in 30 minutes and some came up and told me it was very very good.

I know I already rated this recipe once, but I made a terrific improvement: on top on the potato layer, I added a box of frozen creamed spinach (broken into small pieces), then poured the gravy on top of that (I also added poultry seasoning & Tabasco to the gravy). I cut WAY down on the cheese, using about 1/2 cup Gouda, cut in little pieces. I made it the day ahead and baked it the next morning. It's even better reheated. The spinach was a fantastic addition.

I made this yesterday afternoon and baked it this morning, and it came out just fine. I added poultry seasoning to bulk pork sausage and used non-fat milk. I used a combination of cheese - cheddar, gouda, and chevre. I don't think I would use the chevre again because it gave a pretty assertive taste and smell that seemed out of place. My companion ate three helpings and commented that I didn't need to do anything different to it, that it was just about perfect. We had fruit and toast with it - if we'd been hungrier, an egg or two would have been good. I'll be making this again.

This was pretty good. My kids really liked it. Much of the flavor is, of course, dependant upon the flavor in the bulk sausage. I prepared the meat the night before which made for a quick assembly in the morning. Easy and satisfying.

I liked this recipe and have made it a couple of times. It was easily adapted to make with smoked salmon for lighter taste and fat intake. I chopped up about one cup of smoked salmon with three eggs and some milk,and layered the casserole as stated.

Excellent!! We get the griddle out near the end of baking time and make over-easy eggs to go on top of the servings. Have made this twice for brunches and everyone LOVES it. Something different than the regular sausage/egg casserole. Easy to prepare for a crowd at breakfast.

Rating: 4
Only change I made was to use low fat sausage or drain some of the fat after cooking the sausage. Excellent, have been asked for the recipe by anyone who had this dish. Will certainly do it again and again.

I'm glad I tried this recipe. Went with the other reviewers as far as the spicey varieties of ingredients and there were no left-overs

This is a favorite at office functions. I make a double batch and use half hot and half regular pork breakfast sausage. You could easily use all hot sausage. I also use more cheese than it calls for. I'm a cheese lover.

Thank you gwamakawen from DC - I've made your version twice to rave reviews. This one is a keeper!

Very tasty! I substituted ground beef for the sausage. I also used a multi grated cheese assortment such as Asiago, Mozzerella, Cheddar and Jack. Cheese came out crisp towards the outer sides of the dish which was great!

I made this casserole for a church brunch and it was a total success. I made it the night before and baked it in the morning. I substituted the hashbrown potatoes for some "potatoes O'brien", and it turned out very tasty. It's very easy to make and it doesn't require many ingredients.

Excellent for a brunch although I mixed in a can of mushroom soup and cut out some of the milk.

Very good stuff! Everyone liked this dish...and I served it as a side dish at dinner. I added some finely chopped red pepper and a touch of cayenne to give this a spicier feel. I feel as though it would have been bland without the additional flavor. Very good overall...I would make this again, for breakfast or dinner!

Rating: 3
I halved the recipe and baked it in a 4 x 8 loaf pan. It was delicious for just my husband and I (with a little leftover). In the future I intend to double the recipe and make it for my Ladies Circle brunch at Church. I'm sure it will be a hit!

This was an easy recipe. I used maple Jimmy Dean sausage, added 2 tablespoons sour cream to the gravy mixture and used salt, pepper and hot sauce to taste on the potatoes. This gave the dish a sweet and slightly spicey taste. I brought it to a breakfast and it was gone in about 2 minutes.

I use Jimmy Dean sausage and O'Brien shredded hash browns. It is fantastic!! It is easy! I make this for supper sometimes. Try it, you won't regret it!!

I'm all for making things simpler...in the egg section of the store there is a fairly new product called "Simply Potatoes" which are fresh potatoes (not frozen). I purchased the Southwestern Style hashbrowns to use in this dish. I also used 1# of Bob Evans Sage (or spicy) sausage. McCormicks makes a package of dry ingredients for Country Style Gravy. Brown the sausage, pour off any accumulated fat and add the gravy mix with 2 cups of low-fat milk (hey, get rid of it where you can!) Let that come to a boil and thicken. Then proceed with the rest of the recipe. We liked the spicy flavor of the southwestern potatoes, so I used pepper jack cheese with this. I put it all together the night before and baked it off while we were opening gifts on Christmas morning. It filled an 8X8 baking dish. Could probably have put it into an 8X10 and made it less thick. We will definitely make this one again. Another idea for meat is to use Smithfields ground ham. That would taste similar to the breakfast casserole that my hubby likes from the CrackerBarrel Restaurant in the south. Definitely not heart-healthy food, but tasty!

I made this twice this week and it was delicious. The first time that I made it I doubled the recipe and it seemed to take forever (over 1 hour) to cook adequately enough to absorb the liquid. I prepared it the night before and I used Potatoes O'Brien and Jimmy Dean hot sausage. I made it in advance again, but this time I defrosted the potatoes a little in the microwave to reduce the moisture, reduced the milk a bit, and used half hot sausage and half low fat. I didn't have any problems with the liquid being absorbed today and the substitution of the low fat sausage was barely noticeable. This is really an easy dish to serve for a large group. Even I get to enjoy breakfast now!

Very good. I'd definitely make this again. I microwaved the hash browns for a few minutes just to be sure they got done...turned out delicious!

This has become the traditional breakfast that I make every Christmas morning. I get everything cut up, and the sausage mixture cooked the day before, then stick in the oven when we get up.

Good. But I recently made a variation (using a recipe from allrecipes.com) that was more substantial and good for a crowd: layer hash browns (or tater tots), sausage and sauted onion/mushrooms. Mix 1 dozen eggs, 1 can condensed soup, 1 can evap. milk - pour over all and bake the next morning. Not the usual epicurious standard I know - but definitely a crowd-pleaser. Cheese optional (but pepper jack is good).

Rating: 4
MMMMM! My boyfriend loved this! He raved all day. I used turkey sausage links (mild) plus 2 spicy turkey italian sausages for a little flavor. It was great. I think maybe cooking the potatoes a little may make it a little better. Looking forward to making it again. It was sooo easy.

This dish was FANTASTIC! So quick and easy, definitely a keeper. I bet green chili's would be a good addition. You can prepare the night before, just pop in the oven in the morning.

A very simple yet delicious recipe. I used O'Brien potatoes also, but I think next time I will lightly brown them. Also, I will add mushrooms. I used 4 kinds of Italian cheese but topped the casserole w/ cheddar mixed w/ the Italian cheeses. I will only use 2-3 green unions instead of 4 b/c I thought it was a little too onion-y. I prepared it the night before and just baked in the morning.

This dish was great! I used spicey sausage for a kick and O'brian potatoes for more flavor. It was even better the second day after the flavors had more time to meld. I think next time I will try thawing the potatoes, then cook the sausage mixture and putting the dish together the night before to give the flavors a head start, then bake in the morning.

I doubled this recipe into a 9 x 13 pan and took it to a meeting at work. It made alot, so there were leftovers that I put in the lunch room. People were eating it during their break and were raving on how good it was. We're having a potluck for lunch next week, but my co-workers are "forcing" me to bring this in for breakfast during a training session that day. I used one 16 oz pkg of O'Brien potato "shreds", one pkg of sage and one pkg of smoked flavored Jimmy Dean sausage, a 1/2 lb. of diced bacon (cooked with the sausage), half & half cream, and just sprinkled the green onions on the top. I skimmed off some of the grease after cooking the sausage. It was even good at room temperature. Thanks alot for this recipe!

I made this recipe for a brunch together with an Asparagus and Yellow Pepper Frittata. It was delicious! I made both recipes the day before a baked them on Sunday morning. I made a few modifications thanks to the other reviews such as adding additional eggs and using milk instead of cream.

Everybody at my Mother's Day brunch wanted this recipe. By far the best breakfast casserole I've ever had, and I will continue to make this one. I doubled it and served it with the Creme Brulee French Toast and a fruit salad, and it was the perfect breakfast combination. I did make the following variation, and would do it again: when I doubled the meat, I used a pound of bulk breakfast sausage, 1/2 pound of sausage links cut into pieces, and a pound of bacon, which I crumbled. It made a delicious combination!!! You will not be disappointed if you make this one.

This was very good and easy. I made it the night before an office breakfast potluck and just reheated in the morning. I substituted ground turkey that I spiced up with sage, garlic, crushed red peppers and fennel seed (everyone thought it was sausage rather than turkey!). I also used Potatoes O'Brien and lowfat milk. It turned out great and I got several requests for the recipe.

Delicious, just as all the other reviewers have said! I doubled the recipe, added an extra 1/2 cup of milk and baked it in a 9"by13" pan. It was devoured! I'm going to make it again, but try it with lowfat or nonfat milk.

I served this with the Creme Brulee French Toast recipie I found on Epicurious and the two were a perfect match. My crowd had 3rd helpings of these potatoes and the oohh's and mmmm's echoed at the table the entire meal. The sausage I used was a country chicken variety with a hint of spiciness to it. I mixed all ingredients instead of layering and added about a half cup more cheese. The potatoes also took about 10 minutes longer to cook (could it be my oven?). I also served a fresh fruit salad (bartlett pears, kiwi, raspberries, plums and blackberries) as a starter to this meal.

I have been making this dish since it appeared in the November 97 issue of Bon Appetit. It's fast, easy, everyone loves it and is a great recipe for feeding a large number of people (it's easily doubled). I've used spicy sausage to heat it up and O'Brien potatoes are a great substitution for hashbrowns since the onions and bell peppers are already added.
