Cooked this with the Caraway Crusted Pork Chops. Quite a nice change from the everyday veggies. Escarole is quite bitter, but the apples and vinegar combined to really mix the flavors.

Godd but not amazing.

Served it with baked chicken, an excellent combo. A guest commented: "These things really go together, and I'm not always so fond of cooked greens." Ate all that I fixed.

I couldn't find escarole at my local market, so substituted swiss chard - came out great! Very nice as part of a winter meal.

This is a wonderful recipe to use for *any* type of greens; just vary the cooking time to suite the greens you're using. It's a great fall dish that I have added to my "regulars" file.
