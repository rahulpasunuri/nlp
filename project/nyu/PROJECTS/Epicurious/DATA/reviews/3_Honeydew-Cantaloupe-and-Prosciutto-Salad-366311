Worth trying, the sweet and salty flavors are my favorites. The basil is a must, adds a lot to the dish. I ended up using veganaise as that was all I had on hand, snd it was fine. Easy and quick to make, I cut everything the way I wanted to.

Delicious and refreshing for a summer night's dinner. The tangy dressing reminded me of a sorbet, and the crumbled prosciutto adds a nice crunch.
