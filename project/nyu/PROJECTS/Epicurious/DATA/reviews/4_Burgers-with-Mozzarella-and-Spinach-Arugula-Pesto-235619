A great, very quick recipe. The pesto takes only about 10 minutes to prepare. I added a little extra lemon to increase the flavor. We'll definitely make it again. It's a great recipe to do when you have company over for a grill night--it seems like you've done a lot when you really haven't.

YUM! What's not to like? I wish I had arugala on hand when I made this but it was still great with just spinach.

I made these following the basic concept of the recipe (which is delicious) as opposed to the exact ingredients. I used ground Bison, the Classic Pesto recipe from this site, a slice each of tomato & mozzarella with some mesclun lettuce on a toasted english muffin. It's kinda like caprese salad on a burger, a very yummy combination.

I added a fistfull of Basil to the pesto and it made a big different. Also, the quality of olive oil will affect the flavor. A yummy, healthy pesto!

These burgers are great! I used some local grass-fed organic ground beef--YUMMY. My only complaint is that I somehow ended up with waaaay too much pesto. Although it's good with the burgers, I don't think I'm quite wild enough about it to use it on lots of other things. Overall, though, excellent recipe!

I only wanted the pesto recipe. I had to change it for my purpose. I used 4 cups spinach, no arugula. I also added some sea salt and a lot more Parmesan cheese. I loved it that way!

Really good with this pesto, but I bet even better with standard pesto. This recipe has the advantage of using lots of farm share greens. The other one tastes better. The pesto makes the burgers incredibly moist. Really good.

The spinach-arugula pesto was severely lacking. I made the burgers with ground turkey, which came out amazingly moist with the addition of the pesto. I would not make this again as written. However, I will make this with a traditional basil pesto, which I'm sure will be much tastier.

I made these as a mini-burger for our 4th of July BBQ (I also made the grilled turkey burgers from this site with chipotle mayo, and a blue cheese and bacon stuffed mini burger). I was super short on time - so I subbed in a store bought pesto instead of making my own. Very, very good. The pesto was subtle so it didnt turn off even the most finicky guests.

Amazing burgers! We also made them with a mix of half ground chicken and half beef to cut the fat even further, and they came out great! Just a word of advice, though, don't use ground turkey as an option - those didn't turn out so well, but rather dry instead.

Used a basil pesto and built burger as directed. I was reaaly surprised how good this was. We loved it. Try it.

Delicious! I didn't have enough charcoal to properly grill the burgers, so I had to finish them under the broiler.

My husband said these were the best hamburgers he'd ever eaten, and my teenage daughter agreed. I made the recipe as given, and it came out perfect. I will repeat many times.

Divine! Cheated a bit and used store bought pesto. Fabulous results! Can't wait to make these delicious burgers again.

We added an onion that had been grilled with a litle barbeque sauce on it for seasoning. Also, made the burger with 1/3 ground meat, 1/3 ground veal and 1/3 ground pork.

This is the most delicious summer burger-- we've made this recipe three times in the past two weeks! I happened to have fresh basil growing, so my pesto was a variation on the recipe, but I'm just crazy about the flavor combination. So fresh and summery-- perfect for company-- a great burger with a delicious twist.
