I thought this was lovely, rich and interesting and homey all in one. The family found it merely nice. I pureed a 1/2 cup of silken tofu in with the soup instead of adding whipping cream- the end result was super silky.

I used beef both instead of chicken, half and half cream and skipped the sherry and thyme. It was very good

I made this after I had a sweet onion soup at Diva at the Met in Vancouver. With sweet onions, it was very similar, and very good. After reading some of the other reviews complaining of being too watery, I only used 4 cups of stock, and I reduced it a little bit more. For garnish, I used bits of fried pancetta and red bell pepper pieces (1/8" x 1/2") in the middle of each bowl. Lovely.

Fabulous recipe. My husband loved it. I cut the broth down to 4 cups instead of 5 and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream. This is a keeper.

I must be the only cook on the planet that found this flat. Thin and tasteless...ick! This is the only recipe from this site that has left me cold. I'll try it again to make sure I'm not insane, but it's pretty bad. Maybe it will taste better tomorrow.

This soup is wonderful, have made it twice now for guests, each time it was a huge success. I added more sherry than suggested, otherwise followed recipe exactly.

I have made this many, many times and everyone I make it for says it's even better than the time before! I like to add a little bit of extra sharp white cheddar cheese or some smoked gouda along with the chives at the end for that little extra kick.

Very tasty, and even better the next day. Made a double batch and added more potatoes since we like thick, hearty soups in the winter. Also used a combination of beef and veggie broth since it was at hand.

This was so easy. I made it a day ahead, so the mild onion flavor really came through. It was perfect as a light soup before Christmas dinner.

Excellent soup. I didn't have Sherry so I used Port which seemed to work fine. Seems like a good base recipe for tweaking.

This soup was just delicious. I didn't change anything except substituted dried thyme for the fresh. That was a mistake! The dried thyme was not delicate enough for the soup so I ended up straining it out. The tablespoon of sherry added just the perfect finish for this delectable soup.

This soup is absolutely delicious and my guests loved it. However, with all of the onion, it left an onion stench in my house for a week afterward! Despite that, it was so good both fresh and reheated that I plan to make it often!

Light, elegant, tasty, and really easy to make. Made a large batch and froze in single serving containers, and it tasted just as good, if not better.

Excellent. Light enough to begin a large meal. I serve topped with a teaspoonful of whipped cream. Tasty.

Excellent flavors, surprising that the sherry really comes out. I have subbed 1/2 and 1/2 for a little calorie savings with no taste loss. Easy to make.

I made this soup on Christmas day. All my guests loved it. One even had four servings of it! I replaced the sherry with 1/2 cup of port and swirled in some warm cream when serving. Easy and delicious.

This soup was wonderful. I used 4 cups of the broth instead of 5 and one yellow onion and one red onion. Wonderful, mild flavor and very simple to prepare.

Overall good soup, nice flavor. It was not quite thick enough for my taste so next time I'll add more cream and reduce amount of broth.

Very simple to make. I made it when I was suffering from a cold and it was wonderful and comforting.

Somewhat like a hot Vichyssoise but lighter and sweeter. Guests loved it.

The recipe took a bit longer than origionally indicated, but my husband and I really enjoyed this cream soup more than anyother we have tasted. My husband thought it would have a stronger onion flavor, but I thought it was just perfect. I will be passing this recipe on to friends and family that enjoy onions as do we.

I served this twice in one week - at a "soup dinner party" with cream and at an office lunch using milk and 1/2 & 1/2. People from both events asked specifically for the recipe and kept telling how much they liked it.

We loved this recipe, you get the best of the natural flavor of onion.

Quick and easy to prepare. Light onion flavor. I expected more harsh intensity, but pleasently impressed with flavor!
