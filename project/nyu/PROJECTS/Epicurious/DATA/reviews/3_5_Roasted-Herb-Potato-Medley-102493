Great recipe, I cut it by 2/3 and only used Yukons which I think work better because it is so light and fluffy inside the crunch of the skin. Recommend to lower the time in oven to 40 minutes because oil on a non-stick pan tends to move and leave some dry spots.

As someone who grew up eating vinegar on her fries, this recipe is heavenly. Comfort food with pizazz.

Very good. The pungent aroma of the white balsamic vinegar wafted through the kitchen while the potatoes roasted in the oven, but the finished result tasted great!

This was a big hit. I decreased the oil a little like others had suggested. The aroma of the potatoes cooking was so great we couldn't wait for them to finish. Felt it needed some salt and pepper.

I made this dish for a dinner party, and used fresh herbs from my garden and a very good balsamic vinegar. It was a huge hit! I used Yukon golds and yams, and next time I think I'll just use the yams. The yams blended very well with the sauce and roasted to a terrific consistency that everyone truly enjoyed.

I love roasting my potatoes with balsamic. I used red potatoes, sweet potatoes, and red onions which were awesome! I omitted the fennel and added some garlic & lemon juice. I also cut down on the oil and I didn't really let the potatoes sit in mixture for more than 15 minutes but it was still great.

Cut down on the oil, add a little hot sauce to the balsamic, use cilantro roots with the shallots. YUMMY!

We've made this dish several times already. It is a great side dish for grilled chicken or beef. The balsamic vinegar is what really sets these potatoes apart from others.

I prepared this recipe to accompany a lightly seasoned baked chicken dish with a white wine sauce. Since there were only two of us, I halved the amount of potatoes. It turned out beautifully and was very tasty. Definitely a keeper, though turning the potatoes during the roasting process was a bit of a pain.

This is a GREAT recipe . . . very tasty, very easy and very lovely to serve. I used garlic and basil instead of the shallots and thyme. I also followed the suggestion of a prior reviewer and lined the baking dish with aluminium foil for a no mess clean up.

This was excellent! Even though the point seems to be to mix potato types, I didn't, and used fingerling potatoes instead. These not only tasted great, but made a very nice visual presentation. I omitted the post-cooking toss in oil; I think that would have been too much. This is definitely a dish I would repeat, including for a company dinner -- easy, attractive, delicious, no last-minute work.

I used this with Chicken Marsala and Moroccan-style carrots. It was excellent! I left out the fennel and did not return the potatoes to the remaining oil mixture, and they weren't too oily. Wonderful flavor!

Herbs and balsamic vinegar were wonderful counterpoint to the potatoes. Potatoes came out crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside. Leftovers tasted just as good. This recipe is a keeper! I halved the olive oil and omitted the fennel. Also used a roasing pan lined with heavy aluminum foil to minimize the mess.

I made this last night and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I cut the recipe in half, only used regular baking potatoes and left out the fennel. In error, I poured the oil mixture on the whole thing when I baked it, and didn't save any for afterwards. Regardless, the potatoes were not at all oily and I thought between the fresh herbs and balsamic vinegar, they were full of flavor. This was easy and I will definitely make it again.

This is a terrific recipe. I cooked it ahead of time about 1/2 of the way then put it in the fridge. Brought it out later and finished ccoking it. I'm not sure if it was this preparation or not, but it came out very well cooked, slightly crusty on the outside and wonderfully soft on the inside, not oily and very flavorful. My guests raved about it.

Very tasty! Based on prior reviews, I wanted to avoid oily potatoes but the sauce was too good to pass up. So I discarded all but a couple of tablespoons of liquid, and then mixed with the roasted potatoes. I also tossed with some Kosher salt in this last step...great flavor all around!

After reading the reviews that the potatoes were oily I omitted the step of tossing them with the reserved oil mixture after baking...the potatoes turned out great, not oily.

Based on earlier reviews, we used less oil and nearly doubled the shallots and spices. Very tasty.

The Balsamic Vinegar *is* a nice touch, but doesn't save this recipe from a general oily tastelessness, as mentioned below. Make sure you use baking sheets with a rim. I dirtied up my oven good!

Sounded great, tasted OK, I did this recipe for 50 and perhaps it doesn't up adjust well. Anyway, I found them to be very flat. I rarely add salt to my food, but I found myself salting this.

My guests really liked this, but my husband and I thought the balsamic vinegar (which we normally love) made the potatoes too sweet. Won't make it again, as there are so many other good ways to roast potatoes.

Yummy! Used new potatoes, a *lot* of shallots, and it was wonderful, if a tad bit oily.

Great recipe!! At first taste it seems like your average roasted potato, then the subtle flavor of balsamic vinegar kicks in and it's elevated to a new level.

A wonderful combination that works! The addition of balsamic vinegar really pumps up the flavor!!

This was such a nice change of pace from the usual boring mashed potato at Thanksgiving. My guests loved it, and no one even complained about the absence of the traditional mashed. The addition of the balsamic vinegar is divine! Don't forget to stir the potatoes while they are roasting so that they roast evenly and don't stick to the dish!

This was a nice dish, especially since it was a little different than the usual potato dishes. I think I managed to put just the right amount of herbs so that nothing was too strong.
