I made this recipe exactly as written, using the creme fraiche. The flavor was good but the appearance was just average. The creme fraiche becomes too thin and does not hold its shape as shown in the photo. Instead, it has to be spread on the potatoes. Those cooks who used sour cream are happy with the results. Use the less expensive ingredient and save yourself some frustration.

Can you serve these at room temperature, or do they have to be hot?

Delicious! I made everything in advance and the assembly was quick and easy when guests arrived. I did not use caviar, but garnished with a little dill. Very pretty and appealing for passing on a tray.

These got good reviews at a recent party. I only let the preserved lemon sit for about 9 hours before adding it to the sour cream and it was still great. My only change would be to use slightly less salt in the sour cream, since the smoked salmon is already salty. I omitted the caviar and it was still a pretty and yummy combo.

I don't know, I was excited to make these but bored by the end result. I like the idea of all of the individual components but in the end these were forgettable, and didn't get eaten at my dinner party.

This was a hit at my Christmas eve celebration. All fish and vegetarian dishes. Waht make this is the preserved lemon. I made it with sour cream. Did not use caviar at all and no one missed it. Will be making this one again for a New Year's eve celebration I am going to.

First, this recipe is to die for by young and old every time; and don't just make it for special occasions! Second, you don't need $$$$ cavier, or creme fraache; get the supermarket varieties (or sour creme for cf)...not a big deal. Also, any small potato works very well.

Omitted the caviar (I'm not a fan), but the preserved lemon is crucial. Brought these to a wine tasting, and got very positive comments.

i made it for a cocktail party and it got raved reviews. i used ground cumin seeds instead of roughly crushed and it still turned out great. i used mini potatoes instead of fingerling potatoes. It is so easy to make and the preserved lemon was awesome. i wish i made more!

This was wonderful. The preserved lemon peel was beautiful and is about to become a pantry staple for me. So easy and quick. I used very expensive cavier and was afraid all the other ingrediants would upstage it, but not a chance. After tasting we decided to forgo lunch and just keep eating these. There were 3 of us and we ate them all!

The preserved lemon peel is quick and can be done ahead of time. It really makes the appetizer interesting, I think it's worth the trouble. I tried this both using the potato and frying up thinly sliced parsnips and using those as a base. I liked the parsnips more because they were a nice crunchy base for the creamier toppings.

One word: amazing! Don't skip the lemon, it is what makes the whole thing work. My entire Christmas menu was epicurious-inspired and delicious, but this dish out-shown all! You end up making way more lemon peel than you use, and I regrettably tossed the unused lemon before tasting the finished product. I wish I had tripled the creme-fraiche and spread it on everything. Next time I will also use less potato.

Absolutely fabulous! I had trouble getting the potatoes done in the oven, so I zapped them in the microwave after roasting for 15 minutes, and they puffed up nicely and softened properly

This was good, but I didn't think it was great. I thought the potatoes drowned out the rest of the flavors. I would go with a pancake instead.

This was a great recipe. Easy, easy, easy. I didn't bother with the lemon peel, but I didn't miss it. They were a very nice hors d'ouerves, and so simple to make. The cumin seed is perfect with these flavors.

This recipe is divine, make it and don't change a thing.

To DIE for! We did these for mew year's eve and had to delay the dinner prep in order to make another batch. We 'economized' with domestic caviar ($49 for the ounce), but if you're not a huge caviar fan, you they'd be delicious without it.

I didn't have time to make the preserved lemon peel, so I just melon-balled a segment out of the potato half and filled it with sour cream and then the toppings. It was quick, easy and delicious!

I think this dish had too many ingredients; why would you need both smoked salmon AND caviar? Nevertheless, all my guests loved it!

I have made these for two recent parties. They taste great and look elegant. I might even consider making the cumin roasted potatoes alone as a side dish!
