This was enjoyed by my guests at the Thanksgiving table (where we have beef tenderloin, long story LOL). I would make it again, but I think I would at least halve or quarter the shallots, they were sort of imposing sitting whole in the bowl. Flavor was delicious but it seemed to take a really long time for the wine to reduce to a glaze. Would plan on a lot more time to prepare them than the recipe states.

What a hit. I did most of the cooking ahead of time since I was taking them on a camping trip to serve with the beef/goat cheese recipe. I didn't realize there were large and small shallots. I bought the only shallots available at my supermarket (which were large) so I used 1/2 the amount. I have never received so many compliments on a recipe EVER. The sweetness of the shallots were a perfect complement to the tangieness of the goat cheese sauce on the steaks. Abosolutely a hit. The other women I camped with all plan on making the shallots again. Huge hit.

Delicious! Watch out for the wine splatter.

This is a staple when company comes over. I leave out the apple juice and it is superb. Takes time but definitely worth it.

These were a perfect accompaniment to grilled filet mignons! The only thing that I found time-consuming was the shallot prep. I reduced the sugar to 2 tablespoons, increased the Zinfandel to 2 cups and totally eliminated the apple juice and final 16 minute cooking time. The dish cooked in about 30 minutes. I rewarmed the leftovers and didn't care for them, so I wouldn't recommend preparing the dish a day in advance!

These were very good but a bit time consuming. I also served these with the Blue Cheese Encrusted Filet Mignon recipe from this site, as well as garlic mashed potatoes and pancetta green beans.

These were wonderful, absolutely wonderful and they created a wonderful scent in my kitchen! A few things I would do differently. I would buy larger shallots as they do shrink down considerably and I would not make in advance and reheat. They are easy - give them a try!

Although this recipe took MUCH longer to make than indicated with regard to both of the times specified for the sauce reduction, I absolutely loved the results! We served it Christmas day along side the blue cheese crusted filet mignon (from this site) and it was out of this world! The shallots are very sweet, which was a perfect foil to the saltiness of the blue cheese topping of the filet. When I make these again, I will start them early in the day and simply reheat for serving. It's an excellent, unusual side dish!

My guests said this was one of my best meals yet. I had no idea the shallots would be such a big hit--I also did not use the sugar. I made this with the Beef Tenderloin and goat cheese sauce, but also prepared a merlot sauce for the tenderloin as alternative. Both were delicious.

I also made this with the beef tenderloin and goat cheese recipe. It was awesome. I made it for a small dinner party and everyone loved it. It is the perfect recipe: Delicious and EASY!!

I would make this agin, however, it would be altered somewhat. I wouldn't use any sugar because I think the shallots are naturally sweet enough especially with the addition of the apple juice. We added baby portobello mushrooms and I'm glad we did.

Fantastic recipe... always a hit! Adjust the cooking time up a bit if the shallots are large.

I made this with the Beef Tenderloin in Goat Cheese Sauce. Both dishes were a big hit. Many of my guests asked for the recipe and want to serve this with other dishes.
