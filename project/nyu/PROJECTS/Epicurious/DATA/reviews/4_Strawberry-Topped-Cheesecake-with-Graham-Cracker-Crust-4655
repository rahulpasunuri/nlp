I have made this cheesecake many times to great revies. People who normally don't like cheesecake will eat this one and then take seconds. I took it to a Christmas party where most of the people were on diets. They ended up with 2 pieces. My son makes it now and takes to parties. He is the hit and talk of the party. Never have had any cheesecake this good. Recommend hightly.

This is a great, classic cheesecake recipe that I will make again many times. My only complaint is that I baked it for 70 minutes (more than the stated 55) and was disappointed to find the center completely raw the next day. But there's no question the taste is fabulous. I also enjoyed the topping. The only change I made was to use the gingersnap crust from another recipe on this site. Delicious!

I too have used this recipe since it was on the cover of Bon Appetit many years ago. I have made it over and over again to rave reviews. I like to put large strawberries on the outside and blueberries in the center and then cover with the jam. It makes a beautiful presentation especially for the fourth of July!

I have been searching my old Bon Appetit magazines for this, I remember it being on the cover in the 198o's. Promised a friend I would make it for her birthday,finally I found it. Can't wait to make it after all these years, It is the best!!!

I originally made this recipe in the early 80's. Lost track of it and have been searching for it. This is almost identical except for walnuts in the crust which are fabulous, and cointreau in the topping. This cake has a beautiful presentation and can make even the simplest of bakers look great. Thank you Epi for printing this.

I recieved this recipe from a friend in the 80's right out of the magazine. So glad I found it again. This has been a hit with my family and friends. Yes the original recipe calls for Walnuts. I will add 3/4 cup. In addition I make it in a 9"springform. The other thing I do is add 1/2 more of all the filling ingredients. So I will add 6 8oz cheese, and so forth. This will make the cake actually larger so it is grander like "cheesecake factory". Bake it about 10-15 min more, but keep checking that it looks the same. I never had dark brown spots, just light carmel color spots was enough. The sourcream does a great job of covering it up. This is a larger cake Not to worry, because everyone ends up taking smaller pieces (but sometimes twice) The cake stacks higher. I always make it one day before. The cheese settles much nicer and is loftier for. Before serving I add the berries. The original recipe calls for seedless raspberry jelly and cointreu in the glaze. It makes it definitely yummier. I even drizzle a bit of chocolate on the strawberries on the edge. Or if you serve it on the plate have your plates drizzled with chocolate. This recipe will end up serving min of 20. Making it again this weekend after a 10 year hiatus. Thanks epicurious for posting it.

I had tried probably 6 or 7 other cheesecake recipes with less than ideal results before discovering this gem a few years ago. I will never make another cheesecake recipe ever again! Even though I like to switch up the toppings on this and add other sweets in the interior I stick to this recipe as the base and it comes out perfectly rich and thick and creamy every time. The one element I change is the crust--I go with the store-bought box crust because I don't have a large enough food processor to do this one! Can't get enough of this cheesecake!!!

I noticed that this recipe was published in 1998, but I am sure I saw it in B.A mag before that. It I remember well I was living in Vancouver at the time and wowed my friends with this undertaking: my first cheesecake. That would have been before 1996. The crust had chopped walnuts in the graham cracker crumbs. Senility? Hmmm. Not so sure.

I have been searching for a recipie that was "double baked" with a sour cream topping, because alas... I no longer have my Mom's, which was exceptional!! This cake baked up beautifully...I have a gas oven and found that I needed to add about 10 min to the first bake time and about 5 min to the second bake time. also, I used a tried and true graham cracker crust recipie (I couldn't afford to screw it up) because of earlier reviews. I have to say, Mom was smiling down at me!! Really simple recipie, really BIG results!! Excellent recipie!!

I have been using this recipe for years and it can't go wrong. Always a big hit. When I need to keep it simple and quick I substitute three store bought graham crackers crusts. A definite recipe box keeper!

This looks like the same recipe I used in 1980-something. Then there were chopped walnuts with the GrCrackers crust. I liked the cover picture of the Bon Appetit mag so much that I bought the mag. and baked the cake to impress my wife. She was impressed as were the neighbours who were invited to help us finish it. Wife's birthday is Monday.. Will try and see if I still got it!! A bit too much sugar for my taste. Where did the walnuts go???

This cheesecake has become a tradition now after the fourth time I have made it. This was the first time I had a problem with the crust. Not sure what I did differently, but ended up cuting the butter in half and melting it prior to blending with the crumbs and brown sugar. Also cut the flour down to 2 Tbs. Did not put the topping on, rather had some raspberries on the side. Came out better than ever. Usually we have some left over for post Christmas visitors, but this year it ely made it through Christmas eve...

FABULOUS! I made the filling portion of the recipe exactly as written. The filling is wonderful -- light and fluffy, yet so rich tasting. Based on other reviews, I modified the crust and used 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 18 graham crackers. It turned out fantastic. I didn't have any problems with the crust being too thick as other reviewers mentioned. A delicious all purpose cheesecake that will go with a variety of toppings. Can't wait to have an excuse to make it again!

Tried making the crust recipe posted by JeffreyWilkinson but as the crust baked, the material slid off the side of the pan. Went ahead and did the graham cracker crust reducing butter to 1 stick. Turned out perfectly. Filling and sour cream topping is perfect. Since our dessert would be enjoyed over several days, I opted to serve a combination of quartered strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and boysenberries separately. We drizzled the warmed raspberry jam over all. Will definitely make this again - was a huge hit!

I made this today for Easter Sunday and it was really fantastic. I, too, used the crust from the previous reviewer whose recipe called for bisquick, flour and pecans - excellent. Fed it to a large crowd and everyone really loved it.

I have been making this recipe for 10 years and love it. I have substituted Pepperidge Farms Bordeaux Cookies - 1 1/2 packages - for Graham Crackers and reduced the butter by 1/2 and brown sugar to 1/4 cup. It's a yummy crust either way - but I agree too much butter! I also serve it with whatever berries I have fresh or frozen -- I get raves every time I make it!

Add pecan pieces and melted butter and mix thoroughly. Press mixture evenly into a 10 inch springform pan. Place pan on a baking sheet and place in a preheated 350°F oven for 13 minutes.

This is, hands down, the BEST cheesecake I have ever had. I made this for a family birthday party and it was a huge success. Instead of graham crackers, I used gingersnap cookies/wafers and added 1 tsp. of lemon zest to the filling. No problems with cracking. I sliced the strawberries in half and made a beautiful presentation. This is so much better than the Cheesecake Factory and very easy to make. Creamy, delicious and you can taste all the flavors....This is definitely my new cheesecake recipe!!!!

This cheesecake was out of this world, and won first place in a dessert competition in my office.

Sublime!! I've never made a cheesecake although I'm a huge fan. Didn't bother with the sour cream topping or fruit topping. It was easy and cooked perfectly. Everyone raved and was very impressed. I simmered some berries with Chambord liquor and offered that as a topping. Yummmm!!

I used this recipe to make my first cheesecake -- for my husband's birthday party. One guest told me that it was better than his uncle's, a professional baker. It didn't crack, as I was warned cheesecake would. I've made it a few times since, and get unanimously rave reviews. My husband doesn't think it needs the sour cream topping; I do without the glaze. With any variation, though, people always claim it's the best they've had.

This was the best cheesecake I've ever had in my life--I've made it twice, for friends and for family, and many said the same thing. I did change the recipe for the crust--I used 1/4 c granulated and 1/4 c brown sugar instead of the 1/2 c, and the crust was perfect. I made it plain, and gave my guests the option of pouring kahlua or bailey's over it--and all three options were fabulous. Beautiful, truly beautiful! After years of searching--I've found my favorite cheesecake recipe!!

This is an amazing recipe to make and even better to eat! My boyfriend said it tasted better than Cheesecake Factory! It was amazing! If you are going to try to eat it all week, I would recommend keeping the berries or berry sauce that you use separate and use one serving at a time.

I prefer a lighter and fluffier filling and a bit less sweet so I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 1/4 cups, used 2 packages of cream cheese instead of 4, and beat the egg whites into meringue separately and folded it back into the filling. As a result, the cake was done in about 40 minutes instead of the recommended 55 minute. But this is a great basic recipe to play with and tweak to suit your own tastes.

Rating: 4
My sister and I are in love with this recipe. Variation ideas: replace the graham crackers with crumbled oreo-style chocolate cookies (no white centers, obviously), drop the vanilla and lemon juice in the filling and add about a 1/4 cup Bailey's or Kahlua, and add a little of the same liquor and some baking cocoa to the topping to taste. Total show-stopper. I've gotten marriage proposals after serving this. Original recipe is fantastic too, just as is.

This is a DELICIOUS cheesecake. Instead of using only brown sugar in the crust, I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. Also, I added about 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon zest to the cheesecake mixture, it really gave a boost to the overall flavor. I didn't have the topping ingredients in the recipe on hand, so as I served the slices, I spooned canned bright red cherry pie filling on each slice. (This was my Christmas desert so I wanted it red and colorful.) But you could use ant kind of fruit topping or none at all. Everyone loved it!

This is a really great cheesecake recipe. To eliminate the crumbly crust use the prepared graham cracker crumbs. Honey Maid is the brand and they sell it in a 13oz. package. If you are not going to eat the entire cheesecake within 24 hours put the topping aside. It will bleed into the cheesecake and make it soggy. Just cut up the strawberries, melt the raspberry sauce and put it on as you serve it at each sitting.

Rating: 4
I have made this a couple times now. It's a hit with everyone!! I use rasberries as well and with the straberries I do not put them on whole but rather cut them in halves. My only advice, do not make this dish when you don't have a lot of time. There are a lot of steps and it is suposed to be chilled overnight. Also I found the recipe filling to make more than two pie's so have an extra crust ready just in case. You don't want to waste all that good filling.

I've made many cheescakes in my life and this recipe is really good. I just made it for the second Christmas and my guests raved about it. The only problem as compared to other cheescake recipes I've tried is the crust. It seems to carmelize and break easily when you slice. I tried less butter this time but it didn't help (still one cube is plenty). Now I'm thinking it's too much brown sugar. I'll cut down to a quarter cup packed next time and see. It is delicious though. The sour cream topping is so nice that I don't use a glaze, just fresh kiwi slices and strawberries(Christmas colors). It was beautiful!

This was ok, but not the best cheesecake I have ever made. I think the filling could have been more flavorful.

I have just made this cheesecake for a birthday party. I also baked it 15 minutes longer before putting the sour cream on it and for 10 minutes with the sour cream. Listening to other viewers about the crust and from previous experience, I left the brown sugar out, which, in my opinion, makes the crust hard as it caramelizes. The filling and the crust were perfect. Everyone loved it. I will definetely make it again.

Awesome. Followed others advice and cooked covered with foil after 55 min, an additional 15 - 20. Another extra 10 min when setting the sour cream. SOoo glad I did, as it was the perfect conisistency, just a touch verging on soft. Any less would have been seriously underdone. Crust was perfect, rave reviews all around.

excellent! looked great on the easter table. i did not glaze, no jelly on hand, didnt miss it. used a 9 inch pan with fine results-longer cooking, and less crust mixture required. crust is very tasty, a little bit hard. a bunch of melted butter leaked out of foil around the pan making a mess, probably contributed to hardness. all who tried this said it was delicious. recipe is great base for other fruit combinations too. side note: recipe for turtle swirl chzck on this site has same filling proportions 4 crm chz to 5 eggs, with less sugar, and chocolate crust. we love that version too!

I had never made cheesecake before and was a little worried about it cracking, falling etc.. that I had been warned about. It turned out well. I actually used prepared crusts, two of them.

The cake was a success and I have been asked for another one.

Thank you everyone for your comments. I had to make a dessert for a joint birthday party and your enthusiam convinced me to make this cheesecake. It turned out just perfectly. I used "Love to Cook"'s method for making the crust and had no problems. I topped the cake with blueberries, raspberries and sliced strawberries and used strawberry jelly, since I couldn't find the raspberry and I took the problem of slicing whole strawberries to heart. A White House photographer was there with camera and he took several pictures, along with everybody else who brought cameras. I find the reviews on epicurious to be extremely helpful and I thank everyone for their comments. I love recipes this easy and better than anything else taking twice the effort.

I've made this recipe SEVERAL times since its initial publication in Bon Appetit, and everyone seems to love it! It has become the basis for all my cheesecake recipies (including pumpkin.....yum....). The crust IS a bit tougher than others, but it IS DELICIOUS, and I try to compensate by making sure that it is not too thick in places. Rather than placing the strawberries on top (which DOES make for a beautiful presentation, but also makes it VERY difficult to slice)), I serve them on the side with a strawberry sauce. A GREAT potluck item, this cake has gained a reputation and an ever welcome spot at the table when we gather together with friends and family.

I've made this twice and get tremendous reviews. I use another crust recipe though. 2 cups graham crackers, 1 cup walnuts, 1/2 cup melted butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar. Bake 10 minutes. Cool for at least 20 minutes in the fridge. You will feel it harden when cool. This last time I used 1 1/2 recipies for the crust. I like to roast strawberries and line them on the outside of the cake. Then I arrange berries cut in 1/2 to the center. It's worth a picture. A great cheesecake and fairly easy too!

This is by far the BEST cheesecake I've ever tasted!! I took it to a work BBQ and it was a big hit! People were begging for the recipe and I had to promise I would bring it to every get together from now on. In fact, it turned out so beautiful and yummy, several people thought it couldn't be homemade--it *had* to be bakery-bought :) A couple thoughts though: Because I don't have a food processor, I had to improvise on the Graham cracker crust. Using the ingrediants here, I started by melting the butter in the microwave. Next I added the brown sugar to the melted butter and mixed them together. Then I crushed the graham crackers in a plastic bag with a rolling pin, and added them to the butter/brown sugar mixture. This was then added to the cake pan per this recipe. Also, as it indicates, this recipe CAN be made in stages. In fact, I made the crust and filling one day and chilled overnight. The next day I made the sour cream topping, added the strawberries and put back in the refrigerator until the next day's BBQ. Still came out perfect (and NOT mushy!!!) So if you want to impress your family and friends (or open a catering business as one of my co-workers suggested), I would definitely have this recipe as one of your staples!! Thanks Epicurious!

I made this for a party last night and it was polished off in 10 minutes flat! Everyone raved about it for the rest of the evening and most wanted the recipe. I followed some of the tips suggested by other reviewers - baked it for 15 minutes longer and covered the top after 55 minutes to prevent excessive browning. I also sliced the strawberries and laid them on top and skipped the extra syrup on the side. The crust came out great and the cheesecake seems amenable to different variations. This is a top recipe and I can't wait to make it again!!

I did not make sour cream topping or garnish with strawberries as recipe calls for. Rather I topped sliced pieces with sweetened strawberry slices. This was an easy and very good cheesecake, however, I wish I had read ALL reviews as, like an earlier reviewer, thought this would be a dryer cheesecake. I served at room temperature and it turned out kind of mushy (just because the texture is better suited to being served chilled).

This is a great recipe but I had trouble with the crust as well as one other reviewer. Too much butter??? Don't use graham cracker crumbs, but whole graham crackers??? It made making this cheesecake pretty frustrating but the results were pretty good.

Everyone loved this recipe but dear God, where did I go wrong with the crust? The butter seperated from the crackers & sugar and I was left with a soft gooie (yet tastie) crust.

This is my idea of the perfect cheesecake. Creamy , flavourful and lots of yummy crust. I found it needed to bake 20 mins longer than stated and so I covered it to prevent too much browning at the end.

This was sinfully delicious! I really enjoyed making this for the Holidays last year. Everyone loved it.

A great cheesecake for a special occasion. Rather than topping it with berries per the recipe, try serving with a berry (rasp or straw) and Grand Marnier sauce on the side. Be careful not to remove it from the oven too soon...55 minutes may not be long enough.

The perfect basic cheesecake! Everybody loved it and it looked beautiful. I didn't wrap the pan in foil and used the 1/3-less-fat cream cheese. Also substituted my standby graham cracker crust recipe from Joy of Cooking since it uses a lot less butter. People couldn't believe I made it myself.

I took this to a social gathering and it was totally consumed in 30 minutes flat! The crust was yummy. The jelly was a bit messy but it was worth every drip.

Two words; YUM Mee.

This is the ONLY cheesecake recipe to ever make, with or without the strawberries. It is just so perfect that I don't even bother trying others ever since it was such a success when I first tried it when it was first published.

This is a no fail cheesecake recipe - I get raves everytime that I make it!

THE BEST EVER!! My husband stopped short as we traveled to the picnic with it. The cheesecake landed upside down on the car floor!! Every berry came off,but it stayed in one piece. It got RAVE reviews even in this condition. I can't wait to make it again!

The reasons I would not make this cake again is because it is a "moist" cheesecake as opposed to a "dry" cheesecake. The crust is a little too sweet and the lemon is distinct almost overpowering.

Looked and tasted like it was right out of the bakery! People who "don't really eat cake" tried it and loved it! Looked perfect - no cracks! Would definitely make again!!

I've done some experimenting with this recipe and have come up with some fabulous creations. It's a no-fail recipe that adapts well to changes and additions (such as chocolate) so play around with it and create your own unique masterpieces. I've had nothing but raves and requests every time I make it. You can not go wrong with this one!

I made this for a friend's birthday and everyone at the party raved about this cheesecake. I had never gotton so many compliments! Each guest had at least one piece and some even took extra pieces home. This is definitely the best recipe for cheesecake that I have come across.

What a georgeous cake!! My husband says he does not like cheesecake, but I made it anyway in a heart shaped pan for our anniversary and he even ate a piece for breakfast!!! I will definitely make this at my next dinner party. I used the jelly with seeds and I thought it fine, gave more texture and seemed fresher. But I'm sure either would be nice.

I added almonds to the bottom of the crust. I had to bake the cheesecake for an extra 10 minutes. I also added an extra tablespoon of sugar to the topping. Instead of the strawberries, I used fresh strawberries mixed with mandarin oranges-separate in a bowl and let people spoon the fruit on their slices. Everyone raved about the cheesecake. It was a perfect texture, not "cakey" and not like pudding. I will definitely make it again, with variations of course!!

I have made many cheesecakes and this is one of the best! So many recipes direct you to undercook, but this one was perfect. It yielded a firm but creamy cake. My guests said it was "to die for".

Gorgeous presentation! Everyone was shocked that I made it (maybe that is more telling than I thought-lol!). Excellant advice on buying the raspberry all-fruit w/o seeds. Great way to impress that cheesecake lover thats comming over for dinner!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS !!! My guests throughly enjoyed it - it was easy to do and the 12 portions are HUGE, so it can feed more ! Next time I'm going to experiment with fresh mango slices instead of the strawberries and apricot jelly or marmalade as the glaze.Will let you know the results... unless you try before me and let me know !

This cake is so creamy and delicious! It looks very beautiful and several people said it was the best cheesecake they've ever had. I recommend using SEEDLESS raspberry all-fruit to make your life easier.

This recipe is simply exquisite!! I've fixed it on three occasions - each time better than the last. My co-workers flipped!

Lordy, that's good eatin'! I made it without the strawberries and it was great. Weighs 25 pounds... which is how many pounds you'll gain after eating it. Worth it, though!

I begged my mom to let me make this, and it was a success! And my brother even had two pieces. We can't wait to make it again. from a 7 year old chef

I tried this receipe after numerous attempts with the Cake Bible concept of Cheesecake. It was exceiptional! It gives Junior's Cheesecake from Brooklyn N.Y. a run for the money! The crust is as rich as Pecan Pie!

This is the first cheesecake recipe I have used that came out perfect the first time. It was just delicious. I used raspberries, but think it would be even better with strawberries.

I baking frequently and have tried numerous cheesecake recipes, but this one is by far the best one yet! It is not only the best one I've ever made, but the best I've ever eaten anywhere. Not even the best bakeries or finest restaurants come close to this cheesecake. I brought one to a friend's home in Vermont over Valentine's weekend and baked it in a heart-shaped pan. My friend loved it so much, he even ate some for dessert after breakfast!

I first made this recipe in the 70's when it appeared in Bon Apetite magazine. It has been a favorite over the years. Guests are MOST impressed. Easy to make the cheesecake a few days ahead. Add the topping the day to be served.

I've made this cheesecake several times - and gotten rave reviews every time. It's a great cheesecake for any occasion. Even without the strawberries, it's wonderfully creamy!

This was the first cheesecake that I had ever made so it gets points just for coming out alright! it was even better the second try round -- and I put raspberries and some chocolate shavings on as a topping instead of strawberries. Everyone loved it.

When I make my cheesecake I usually use cool whip so it was to try something new
