Wow! My whole family loved this! Even my 5 yr old :) I followed the advice of the previous reviewers and drizzled the romaine with my fav Caesar dressing... Rather than doing the oil, garlic, anchovie thing. It was delicious! Easy enough for a weeknight...yet elegant enough for company! I'll definitely be making this again and again!

FABULOUS. I just made this 2 nights in a row. My husband and 1 year old both adore, and this might be the easiest thing I've ever made. I used the little frozen garlic cubes from TJ's, Italian seasoned Panko crumbs ( then omitted the parsley) and, as suggested by other commenters, just poured some of my favorite Caesar dressing over the romaine instead of the anchovy/garlic/EVOO prep. In my oven, the chicken needed an extra 5 minutes of baking time.

I loved the chicken and will definitely make that again, but I was not a big fan of the cooked lettuce. The flavors were nice, but I can't get over my gut feeling that lettuce should be cold.

Chicken was delicious. I made double the crumbs and added slightly more olive oil. I didn't like the romaine quite as much.

This recipe is super simple and has outstanding flavors. I also recommend substituting pork chops for the chicken from time to time.

I have fixed this twice. I am not a fan of anchovies so I don't use them. I just drizzle low fat ceasar (Kens)over the romaine. My husband and I love this dish! easy weeknight fare but beautiful on the plate. Impressive enough for company!

Very good chicken recipe. Provides a lot of flavor without the need to marinade, etc. which is uncommon for chicken. Agree with other comments that the romaine needs extra help to add flavor. The lettuce was blah when made as instructed in this recipe.

Very good and easy. As recommended I made a little dressing and brushed the romaine halves. Used anchovy paste rather than anchovies. Also added some refrigerated potato slices. Good weeknight meal.

This was great, and quick and easy to boot. Of course, it couldn't be left alone; I added some minced anchovy fillets and some lemon zest to the crumb mix, and I wouldn't have it without. I was suprised how quickly this cooked, and after roasting all of the chicken the first time round with the one serving's worth of Romaine, I didn't roast the romaine when I had the leftovers, and I didn't miss it to be honest. A great weeknight meal, but nice enough to serve to company.

Tasty,easy,healthy,what could be better? Followed Portland's idea for romaine and roasted some small red potatoes on the same pan which I had covered w/ foil. Cleanup was a snap and I looked like a pro. Can't wait to serve to guests.

This recipe was really easy to make, and the flavors and textures were exquisite. I also loved that the prep and cooking times were minimal. It's an easy dish to make on a week night. I will admit I altered the preparation of the romaine. I coated the romaine with my favorite caesar dressing instead of working with the anchovy fillets. I loved it! I had never tried roasted romaine before.

What could be an easier recipe with such great flavor! Used the best EVOO I had for the romaine. Didn't know I was a fan of chopped anchovies but am now! Totally cheated and used a bag of sliced garlic potatoes from TJ's but, hey, this was a midweek meal. We both loved it!

Wow. Huge success even with my 10 year old picky eater. Thank you "Cook from Portland" I followed those directions for the romaine and it was perfect.

wow! I never thought you could bake lettuce. It's a great dish. Used "normal" bread crumbs because that's what I had. Definitely a keeper.

A little sophisticated. I'd give 5 forks if I could. Only change I made is... Scrap second paragraph of instructions (for the romaine preparation). Instead, in a small bowl or mug, combine good squeeze of lemon juice with the 4 mashed up anchovies, olive oil, and 1 chopped garlic clove. Brush dressing onto hearts of romaine. Sprinkle with salt and fresh cracked pepper. THEN, bake. by A Cook from Portland, Oregon on 03/16/12 Read More http://www.epicurious.com:80/recipes/food/reviews/Parmesan-Chicken-with-Caesar-Roasted-Romaine-394709#ixzz1pqKMdHUi

This is easy and delicious. I marinated the chicken breasts in evoo, lemon juice, garlic, and parsely for an hour or so. I also prepared the romaine as suggested by "Cook in Portland". This is a keeper. Even my teenage daughter ate the roasted romaine. Perfect for a dinner party -- will seem rather fancy I think!

Great recipe, but made some changes. Marinated the chicken in a pesto of 3 cloves garlic, juice of one lemon, chopped-up lemon, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 C olive oil. Spun all in chopper, placed chicken in zip-lock bag, placed pesto in bag and massaged into chicken. Refrigerated for 6 hours. Removed chicken, wiped off pesto. Made twice as much panko mix as directed and coated chicken on both sides. Followed the suggestion of A Cook In Portland re: romaine. The dinner was wonderful and the chicken was tender and flavorful. Recipe is a keeper!

Great! I love roasted or grilled romaine. I prefer dark chicken meat so I used skinned and de-boned chicken thighs.

This was as easy as it said. I made it on a night I was tired, unmotivated, and less than creative. When I served it, my husband commented on how good it looked - magazine photo quality. We ate and the pleasure of having a tasty homemade meal erased my earlier apathy. I did add a bit more garlic, to the lettuce and the panko bread crumbs and tossed some of the panko - just a little on the salad. This truly is a delicious meal that can be made on those nights you can hardly think of cooking.

Made this and served with a brown rice mixture and whole grain french bread. We thought it was a nice change especially roasting the romaine. It was filling and yet healthier than most of our meals.

VG...and loved the romaine. Brined the chicken overnight and added parmesean and fresh berbs (parsley, lovage and thyme) to to breadcrumbs. Added entire can of anchovies and shaved fresh parmasean over lettuce on serving.

really nice - I marinated the breasts in oil, parsley and lemon juice for about 30 minutes and then followed the recipe - good and light
