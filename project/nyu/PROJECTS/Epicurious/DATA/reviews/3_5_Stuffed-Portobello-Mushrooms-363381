I took the advice of others and added more flavors to this recipe. Sprinkled garlic powder over the mushrooms and used a pomegranate balsamic vinegar for baking. Replaced leek with onion and added fresh corn and grated gruyere cheese to stuffing mixture. Results were delicious and nutritious for a quick mid-week dinner!

This was a great healthful recipe for stuffed portabello mushrooms. I made a few changes to ramp it up a bit. I used regular onions instead of leeks. I added one very large clove of garlic minced to add some flavor. Also, the amount of oil and vinegar could have been increased.

Very tasty way to prepare portobellos. Could use some kind of 'kick' - maybe garlic with the leeks, or a bit of balsamic or butter to finish. But really a very good and substantial vegetarian main dish.

totally yummie and very satisfying! We changed it a little bit and added garlic and also roasted some sweet peppers which are yum! We will 1,000%make it again and see if our twins like it...all new foods are a good idea and we love it is veg and takes almost no time to prep!
