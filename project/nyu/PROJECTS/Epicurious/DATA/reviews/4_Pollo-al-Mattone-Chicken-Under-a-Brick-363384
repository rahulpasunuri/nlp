Always a hit! Very affordable as there is not too much that goes into it seasoning wise and whole chickens are so much cheaper than boneless/skinless breasts. Always a crowd pleaser when made for company. The chicken comes out so juicy and flavorful. There is another recipe that was in bon appetit that is similar that can be found on their website but strangely, not here. It uses lemon zest rather than orange, no marinade, yada yada. I usually use a combo of both.
