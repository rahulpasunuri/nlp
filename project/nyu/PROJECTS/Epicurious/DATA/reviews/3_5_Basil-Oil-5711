Very good. I Just eyeballed the measurements, and I did blanch the basil...looked beautiful. Added a touch of garlic. Delicious!

I used canola oil. EVO would be too strong.

I made this with 1 cup basil and 1/2 cup olive oil - it was great. I did blanch the basil. Why not? it takes only a minute and it's logical that skipping this step, you'd end up with muddy-greenish-brown oil, particularly if you had leftovers. I used it to make basil mashed potatoes (yukon golds put through a ricer, then added about 2 T butter, a shot of cream, and most of the basil oil, salt and pepper. So unbelievably good!)

Just as an FYI - blanching the basil first helps it to retain the original green color. Otherwise it tends to become a very muddy color.

I agree, blanching the basil is uneccesary. This recipe is really great!

A wonderful oil with simply dozens of uses. But why blanch the basil-just process the oil and fresh basil in a blender or with a morter and pestle. I also would add a crushed clove of garlic.
