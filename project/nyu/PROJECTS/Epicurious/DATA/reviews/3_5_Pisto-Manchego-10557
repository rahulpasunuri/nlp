Very tasty week night dinner for us. I didn't have chorizo so I used kielbasa and added chorizo seasoning - paprika, hot pepper, coriander and cumin. I served it over rice. Nice blend of flavors.

This was really good...better than it sounded-- really fresh! (I didn't have a red pepper so I substituted yellow squash, and I used a lb of chorizo.) Yes, it was a little runny, so you could put it over rice if you wanted... I use Logan's brand chorizo--they have several styles to choose from, and they're all good.

I think we are adventurous cooks, but this was just not good. I wonder if I did something wrong, although I followed the recipe exactly. The chorizo was very dry and tough, and the rest was sort of oily and liquidy. It was as though it needed to be served on top of rice. Does anyone have suggestions about brands of chorizo that they particularly like, because I did not like what I bought.

I love Chorizo! This was great....I added an extra hard cooked egg. HHHMM..if you chopped it up fine and added some Mexican cheese....what an appetizer that would be. I will make this for my next chorizo craving.

This was a hit with guests from out-of-town. I recommend using real Chorizos, and slicing them with your knife at a 45 degree angle so that you get bigger slices. Serve with a Spanish Rioja.

This was an awesome dish! I had a party with a diverse group of Spanish-speaking people over for whom I made this and they raved about it. One guest said that he doesn't like vegetables, but loved this. It was easy, too.
