I liked these flavors together very much. The vinegar and zucchini serve as a nice alternative to the usual tomato sauce, and it felt relatively healthy, too. I broiled my sliced zucchini in the oven, which was easy + good.

Epic failure...the flavors didn't come together, even the next day. Added halved cherry toms to try and save it with no luck. The garbage disposal was the beneficiary.

Used a small amount of feta over the dish and it turned out awesome

I liked everything about this recipe except for the mint - it was an odd flavor that I didn't need in this dish. I have pics on my blog though - http://randomactsoffood.blogspot.com/

Gave three forks because I really didn't follow the recipe, but it was quick and delicious with my mods and provided a good baseline for the additions. Added fresh tomatoes, basil and roasted red peppers to the zucchini. So good, the way it basically marinates in the pepper and balsamic making a flavorful base to flavor the noodles. Also, used feta and parmesan rather than ricotta salata. Yum!

Good quick summer meal. Grilled the zucchini in a hot pan on the stovetop. Used lots of grated Parmesan instead of ricotta salata. Served at room temp after the flavors had mingled for half an hour.

This recipe is fantastic! The combo of mint & ricotta & zucchini is so fresh and --well --addictive. We make it from late spring through autumn, as long as the mint is growing in the garden. Sometimes we grill on the grill and sometimes we cook it inside and "grill" zucchini slices on a very hot cast iron skillet. Fabulous as a main course or a side dish.

I made this recipe, along with the Arugula & Peach Salad w/Creamy Chive Vinaigrette (as suggested by another reviewer). I thought it was ok, but not good enough to make again. Both this and the creamy chive viniagrette were kind of bland. The penne had distinctive flavors, but not 'big flavors'. It was however, easy to make and would be good made the day before to let the flavors blend. If I ever made this again, I would try feta instead; this was the first time I used ricotta salata like this and I did't like how dry it was.

I really enjoyed making this recipe. I grilled the zucchini on a little charcoal grill, and substituted shredded parmesan for the ricotta. It came out very well. It makes a great side dish, and the mint is refreshing in the heat of summer.

Really yummy, and if you make it with Barilla Pasta Plus there's plenty of protein. Ricotta Salata makes a difference - I would not use goat cheese or feta. Next time I'll use more mint, maybe throw in some roasted cherry tomatoes.

Super-simple, couldn't find ricotta salata so I salted it myself. The mint is surprising and delicious.

This is a simple yet surprisingly tasty summery pasta dish. I substituted goat cheese for the ricotta salata and included chick peas for added protein. I also used whole wheat pasta. This would make a nice side dish but is substantial enough for a light entree. I saved the leftovers and found it was equally delicious as a cold pasta the next day.

Very easy dish, I sauteed the zucchini as I served it with grilled tri tip roast. Took to the Hollywood Bowl

Family thought this reipe was great - and like it says, easy prep, few ingredients - and is a refreshing summer dinner. I agree with the earlier comment that the ricotta salata makes the difference; would stick with that over feta.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. It was easy to make and I thought the ingredient proportions and flavors were spot-on. Chunks of smoky grilled zucchini, just a handful of mint, and the ricotta salata a great foil for the flavors. I was actually hesitant about the mint because I'm not usually a big fan, but I didn't think it was too strong at all. Nothing complex about this dish, just a really nice flavorful summer meal.

I really liked this! I thought it was light and refreshing, and easy to make. I grilled the zucchini on my Foreman grill, and served it with the peach and arugula salad from the same issue of Bon Appetit. Everyone liked it.

This is a good recipe. The ricatta salata was very tasty and I think that using goat cheese or something else would reduce alot of the tastiness . Also maybe you just have to like grilled zucchini...

I must say I didn't lke this recipe at all. The zucchini tasted bland and the texture of so much grilled zucchini in the recipe was unappealing. The mint overwhelmed-and I am a major lover of mint. I subbed feta for the goat cheese and it was the tastiest part. Sorry but I say give this one a big skip!

I didn't like this one much. It was too bland. I did add some lemon juice to it to give it more of a kick. I won't be making it again.
