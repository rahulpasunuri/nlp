Very rich, comforting food on a cold day. I used half the cream and used milk for the other half and it was still thick enough. Used white wine instead of sherry which was also fine. Delicious recipe and easier to make from scratch than I thought. I served in puff pastry 'vol-au-vent' shells with a side of mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Worth every single calorie and gram of fat!

This was a nice version of Chicken a la King. Definitely different from the standard ones I've had before, and the flavour is subtle, but I wouldn't call it bland. I will likely make it again.

This recipe for Chicken a la King looked a little more complicated than other recipes I looked at, but I decided to try it anyway based on the good reviews. I was not disappointed! This is a delicious dish. Someone suggested slightly increasing the quantity of sherry, which I did (I only need a slight encouragement to add extra sherry...). Next time I think I will stick with the recipe quantity instead. Also, I only had 1 cup of cream, so I made up the rest of the quantity with full-cream milk, which was fine as the dish was still creamy enough.

I had roasted a whole chicken a few days ago and used this recipe for the leftovers. I made chicken stock with the carcass and used that in the recipe. Like other reviewers, I added peas.; mostly for additional color. I made a view changes simply because I wanted to use ingredients that I had on hand. I did not add any Sherry and I substituted shitake mushrooms for the white. The addition of lemon juice really makes the dish. It keeps it from being bland. I served the dish over flat egg noodles. My husband raved about the dish. And I thought it was quick and easy to prepare.

This was excellent!!! Just the right amount of sherry. I added petite peas at the end for color and taste...Will definitely make it a again!!!

This is a great comfort food recipe, but different from the one my mother used to make. It definitely had peas, but not sure if that makes or breaks it! She also used puff pastry cups, and it was served with a lemon wedge and capers. Yum! Hers did not have the egg yolks- that does sound too rich- she used a butter flour rouz to start and then added the chicken broth and sherry to that. She may have used a touch of half and half, but again its not necessary really if you start with the roux.

I followed the recipe exactly, but it was very bland. It does not justify the fat and cholesterol intake. I had to add a lot of salt to make this palatable. I would not make this again.

I just used this recipe to make a turkey version to use up all of the turkey from Christmas dinner. It was excellent and reminded me of the chicken a la king my mom used to make when I was little. I had to add peas, because that's what mom always did, and it was great. I personally like it on toast points but my husband couldn't resist the urge to serve it over rice.

This is a great recipe and "comfortable" in that it just makes you happy to eat it. I've made it several times for guests, often teenagers (I'm a teacher) and always with great success.

This was not a winner with my family at all. The taste was good, but it was way too rich for everyone. That was after I cut the butter by half.

This is a superb recipe. Follow the suggestion to add rosemary to the broth and increase the sherry by 1 tblsp. The results are fabulous. I serve over toasted french bread cut in half w/diagonal slits stuffed w/a pea size bttr. and freshly thin-sliced garlic. Best ever Chicken ala King!!!

Delicious, quick and easy recipe! My daughter and I followed the original, but we used Costco chicken strips, which cut down the prep time. We also served it over rice. So, perhaps our recipe should be called "Chicken a la Chun King!"

Fantastic staple, kids and adults love it alike! Definitely use puff pastry, and I like to use a pre-roasted chicken (better tenderness and ease!). Absolutely amazing! I remember eating this as a kid and this is exactly it (plus puff pastry of course). Great crowd pleaser and worth the time!

This dish was delicious. I used homemade stock for extra flavor - my boyfriend loved it! I definitely would recommend this recipe.

Fantastic recipe! The only change I make is substituting puff pastry for the bread - makes it extra decadent! This is a staple as well as impressive when guests come over!

Only changes were using less bell pepper and adding some pimento (to keep it closer to the original recipe). Other than that, kept as per recipe....excellent. Comment to "VTBear"..don't know what your finished dish tasted like but Cilantro! with Chicken a la King? and serving over egg noodles...no egg yolks...who knows might have tasted ok but really weird interprrtation of the original. How can you give the recipe 4 forks...it's been altered too much...sorry but sometimes it's best not to make too many changes to a classic

Great! Used leftover turkey, cut out the egg yokes to reduce the fat, added 2 tbp flour to thicken as substitute. Served over egg noodles and garnished with cilantro to add a new demention to the dish. Would do it again.

Great dish, though I made a few changes, of course. Remembering my mother's CalK, I added sliced green olives and I don't eat mushrooms so I substituted one small potato, cubed, and I did not bother with the egg yolk mixture - it's plenty thick! If you use a bit more sherry and add fresh rosemary to the broth when you simmer the chicken, you'll have so much flavor... I also used my mother's trick of baking up the Pep. Farm frozen pastry shells instead of white bread - much prettier presentation and the texture of flaky pastry adds a lot. This was a big hit!

I make a double batch, stopping before the yolk mixture but including in the chicken pieces. This freezes with no problems at all, I then defrost, bring it to a simmer, and add the yolk mixture.

Very tasty!

A lot of work, a lot of dishes. Looked pretty, tasted OK.

To jwstrand from Berkeley - Yes, I believe this recipe would be good to freeze - I always freeze chicken pies when we make double batches and it's fine. I can't wait to try this recipe!

I also loved this recipe, which differs from the one I haven't made for years by having red, orange, and yellow peppers instead of green peppers and canned pimento. I found a box of baby red, orange, and yellow peppers at Costco, just cut them up until I had two cups. I also used the breast portion of a Costco cooked chicken (we had earlier feasted on the legs and thighs), just cut it into pieces and reheated it slowly in prepared chicken broth. Instead of toast, I remembered my mother's trick of pushing fresh white bread into muffin cups and baking until brown. There are only two of us, and now I have a quantity left over. I'm sure it can be refrigerated, then reheated in the microwave, but I have no idea whether it can be frozen. Help?

Being of that "certain age," I loved this recipe. The dish has all but disappeared from menus, but who cares? Can now make a lovely version myself.
