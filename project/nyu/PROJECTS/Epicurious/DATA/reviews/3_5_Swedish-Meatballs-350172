I think the recipe would be better with beef broth instead of chicken broth. I feel it needed more flavor. My husband loved it

This is certainly not a Swedish recipe, but has some similarities. Swedish meatballs are a mild meatball in milk sauce. My personal recipe comes from my great grandmother, born in Sweden. I grew up eating these. I will stick to my own version, but this as a basic meatball recipe is very good for you to try.

Delicious and so moist!! Here are the modifcations I made:: Italian breadcrumbs - No onions because i was out of them! - Doubled the sauce:: Used beef broth (low sodium) instead of chicken but then it lacked flavor and salt! :) So I added in about a teaspoon of beef bullion granules -- Kids and Hubby loved it!! Served these cuties up with steamed veggies on the side and there was plenty of sauce to dip those in too. YUM - we will be making this again soon.

Make sure you keep the balls small. And I would definitely double the sauce. It got pretty salty, so keep that in mind. Otherwise yummy and easy!

This was delicious, but I did make a few modifications...I used 1.5 pounds of meat (1lb hamburger, 1/2 lb pork) and adjusted the bread crumbs to 1 cup, milk 3/4. Everything else I did the same up until the gravy. My husband and I love gravy, so I actually didn't follow the directions at all...just made the way I always do...with the butter, flour, chicken stock, and milk at the end. I added salt, pepper, garlic, and sage to increase the flavor, and it is DELICIOUS. can't wait until dinner! :) Plus, since there's only the two of us, I froze a bunch of the meatballs for another night....it'll be a good, quick dinner. So over all, a really good base recipe with room to have fun with :)

I am going to give this recipe another try, but I did have a few issues....turned out dry and lacking in flavor. Here are the suggestions based on what happened in my kitchen (1) Don't fully drain the grated onion, a little extra moisture helps. (2) 2/3 C of crumbs instead of 3/4 C. (3) Cook meatballs over medium heat instead of medium high - but not sure how this will impact cooking time. (4) Double the sauce, and add your favorite spice to increase flavor.

I made this for dinner last night and it was really delicious. I deglazed the pan with a generous splash of dry white wine before making the sauce, and I think it enhanced the flavor. I used half chicken and half beef stock. Served over egg noodles, alongside an arugula-pear-orange salad. Great weeknight meal!

I only gave this 2 forks because I forgot the onion. How stupid of me! But of course I did have a 16-month old causing trouble so I was distracted. I would still have to say that I've had better. I think what this recipe is missing is some wine in the sauce. I may try it again (with the onion this time) to give it a second chance.

I made the meatballs as directed except substituted ground turkey- 1/2 white and 1/2 dark- and doubled the nutmeg, ground pepper and allspice. Definitely squeeze out the onion. Sauted the meatballs and then finished in the oven at 350 for 20 min. This took care of them being too soft. I added 1 tsp of fresh ground nutmeg, allspice and ground pepper to the sauce and also added 1/8 cup of lingonberry jam directly to the sauce at the end. This really kicked up the flavor. Fresh ground spices are really the key. Yum!

This is good and easy to make. I added a pound of ground pork and doubled the sauce, using the meatball fat instead of butter to make the roux. Next time, I'll use beef broth.

Fast and easy to make w wonderful flavor. It is a keeper!

I followed some other reviewer recommendations and used cardamon and allspice. I omitted the milk and didn't squeeze out the onion juice. I sped up the process of cooking the meatballs after browning them by throwing them in the microwave for 5 minutes. We used raspberry jam - and both my 5 year old and my spouse chowed it all down. Not a fancy dinner, but family friendly. Definitely a keeper!

This was a great base recipe. First, I used ground venison because I wanted the meat to be less fatty and shallots because I didn't have a small onion. Instead of sauting the meatballs in butter, I put them on Shish-Ka-Bob skewers and grilled them. For the sauce, I used beef broth instead of chicken, whole wheat flour and added some sliced baby bella mushrooms and some fresh parsley from my garden. My family thought it was fantastic and my kids even wanted to take it for lunch the next day!

This recipe was delicious and simple. I used fresh bread crumbs, so I probably should have cut back on the milk, because the balls didn't hold their shape. But otherwise, I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious! I soaked the bread crumbs in soy milk instead, but they turned out wonderful all the same. It was a bit hard to form proper balls, at first, so I added in about 1/3 cup of dry bread crumbs. I also used beef broth instead. The texture of the inside was a bit softer than I expected, but that was a minor set-back. My friends fell in love with them. Splendid work.

This recipie is great.. Not a traditional Sweedish meatball (as my Swedish friend pointed out) but very good none the less!! Goes well with boiled potatoes.

I was looking for a new staple dish for weekday meals and this is definitely it! I doubled the recipe, so added a tsp. of olive oil to the butter to prevent burning - I had to cook the meatballs in two batches and the butter was still fine at the end. The meat mixture is very soft and takes a delicate hand to form the balls, but they held together well while cooking. Only change I made was to add some beef boullion to enhance the broth - as another reviewer suggested, beef broth would be better than chicken, but I didn't have on hand. The spices give the meatballs a nice flavour and the sauce is delicious, so will definitely make again.

Delicious! Did not bother to drain onion or pre-soak bread crumbs, but the meatballs turned out fine. Also did not drain fat after frying meatballs, but added more flour and stock to make more gravy (but still wished I had more). Easy and yummy.

These were pretty good, even my kids ate them. Definitely recommend as a family dinner. Nothing extraordinary but makes a tasty meal on a work or school night. Made extra sauce to serve with noodles and/or rice. Will make again.

Made this yesterday using 92% beef. Two relatively minor problems:shaping the balls, too soft, almost mushy; fixed by adding 1/3 cup of unsoaked bread crumbs. Second glitch was that the gravy started to separate after a few minutes in a Crock Pot set on Low. As they were devoured almost immediately after serving, that hardly had time to become a serious flaw. All agreed they were delicious.

Good recipe for meatballs, but the sauce is lackluster IMO. Suggest following changes for more flavorful, gravy-like sauce: Do not drain fat after cooking meatballs. Add 3 tablespoons of flour and cook on med-low heat ~5 min. Use 1-1/2 cups beef stock instead of chicken stock, and only use 1/4 cup sour cream. Season gravy with 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and allspice.

I tripled this and am so glad I did. I used a 1" scoop and just dropped the meatballs right into the pan (cast iron). After a few batches, I removed one of the pans and wiped it out with a towel because the butter was browning too much. Not a problem. I ended up using butter for only one recipe in the triple batch, so I didn't drain the fat and the gravy was great. I substituted a slice of bread soaked in milk (3 for the triple batch) for the breadcrumbs. It was pretty good whole wheat bread. Maybe that improved it. I also used really good grass-fed beef, homemade veggie-chicken broth, and all the spices (nutmeg, allspice and pepper) were freshly ground. If you use a mixer to make these, you have dinner for 18 (or maybe 12, they're pretty good) in about an hour and a half. It's great -- you can make them ahead and enjoy the party. I think they're best with mashed potatoes and you really do need a berry sauce of some sort. Lingonberries are traditional, but cranberry sauce or even blackberry jam will work.

Sorry to say this was only good...and not even that good. Kind of bland and unexciting. Nothing like Ikea's. The texture as good. I don't know if I'll make it again. If I do, I'll have to spice it up. And yes, I made the recipe exactly as is.

Rating: 3
These were certainly as good as Ikeas, and easy to make, too! I made them using Ikeas package of sauce because I happened to have it and was feeling lazy. Next time I might cut back on the spices just a little.

This was a lot of work for a mediocre dinner. I made as written. I felt that the gravy was too rich, feel like my mouth is coated with fat (yes, I drained the extra fat from the pan and used 92% lean ground beef). The meatballs were creepily tender, flavor of the meatballs was good. Gravy really put me off.

Made this and loved it. We're having the leftovers tonight. I realized to late, that I didn't have any allspice, but just went without. It was really yummy. We served it over whole wheat egg noodles. I will be adding it to the regular rotation!

Great Dish. I've made it twice now. It's all in the spices. I think it is quite good without the gravy sauce as well.

I made this with homemade chicken broth and it made all the difference. Also, be sure the let the milk and bread crumbs soak beforehand. Oh yea and use a cast iron skillet, theres a lot of grying butter in this one!

I think the milk- soaked breadcrumbs is what made the meatballs silky smooth. The flavor was quite nice. I added the tiniest bit of rum to the sauce. I didn't have allspice so I substituted 1/2 cinnamon and 1/2 ground cloves. If I were serving this for company, I would have drained the sauce as the recipe said, because the brown bits of meat didn't look so pretty.
