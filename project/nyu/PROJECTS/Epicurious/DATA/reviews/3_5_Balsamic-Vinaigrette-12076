Quite tasty indeed, however, I thought it was a little too tart so I added about a tps. of sugar and that seemed to round it out just right. Making it for chef hubby's dinner tonight - crossing fingers it all goes well!

We served this over delicate mixed greens, heirloom tomatoes and avocado slices. It was delicious. It whisked up to a thick consistency very easily.

Ehh, I wouldn't make this again. The brown color was a bit of a turn-off & the extreme vinegar flavoring wasn't the kind of vinaigrette that I was in the market for. Will keep looking for a vinaigrette w/o such overpowering flavors, & yes I did add some honey to cut the vinegar but to no avail.

I made this twice - once with honey mustard and once with strong dijon grainy mustard. Definitely go with the honey mustard, it was way too strong with the grainy. I added honey to calm the zing of the vinager and mustard on both attempts and it worked well. This is my standard vinaigrette dressing until I find a better one.

I agree with cutting the oil by 1/3 but (against my initial reaction) put about 2 t. orange marmalade which cut down the acidic aspect/strong bite of the dressing (result of cutting the oil) and gave it a more complex flavor. Did not add the sugar. Also recommend grating the shallots.

I loved this. I agreed with previous reviewers re: reducing the oil and the slightly vinegary taste. I reduced the oil to 1/3 cup and added a teaspoon of sugar and a teaspoon of orange marmalade. The orange zest from the marmalade along with the minced shallots gave it really nice texture.

I was not too hot on this balsamic. I made it according to recipe but with a bit less oil and minced garlic instead of shallots, but it came out just too strong. Too vineagary, too mustardy. I added some honey to soften it, and that helped, but still I will look for a different recipe next time.

Delicious and classic recipe. It pairs quite nicely with a baby spinach salad all the way to mixed field greens. If you're looking for a classic dressing that will be a hit, give this a try.

This was my first attempt to make a homemade dressing. I paired it with baby spinach, chopped walnuts, crumbled cranberry (or blueberry) stilton and mandarin oranges. I used the leftover dressing to marinate asparagus for grilling. It's so easy to make, versatile and tastes fantastic.

This is a great dressing.

This is a great base dressing that you can doctor up to suit your tastes. I use 3 tblsp of the balsamic and just one of the white wine vinegar for a little extra kick (I like to be able to taste the balsamic), and add just half a clove of crushed garlic. I like the suggestion to cut some of the olive oil...I'll have to try that next time.

Love it!!! My husband hates garlic in dressings, so the shallots give a milder flavor. Couldn't get white wine vinegar so used White balsamic vinegar instead.(in addition to the regular balsamic) Such a simple recipe and so big on flavor. Everyone at my Passover meal loved it and asked for the recipe. I grated the shallots so there wouldn't be any big chunks...only small shreds. I also didn't put as much oil. I would suggest some bitter greens mixed into romaine , since it's on the sweet side (maybe cause of the white balsamic)

This has become our "house" dressing. I've cut out 25% of the olive oil and it still tastes great.

maybe it is just me, but i love acidic foods. so when i make dressing, i only use about half the oil called for. this is a great recipe, but for my tastes i like less oil

Very good! I added a minced clove of garlic for extra zing.

This is an indisposable recipe to keep on hand! Here's another easy and delicious suggestion-- drizzle over sliced beefsteak tomatos topped with crumbled Roquefort cheese-- WOW!

Excellent! Easy and delicious. Try it drizzled over a bed of fresh basil, tomatoes, and shredded mozzerella.
