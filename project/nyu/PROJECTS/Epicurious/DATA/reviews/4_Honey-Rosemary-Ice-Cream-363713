Holy amazing ice cream, Batman!!! Unusual and delicious. My guests LOVED it. Also, unlike some other ice creams I've made, this one had a wonderful texture several days later. I've had other ice creams get too hard in the freezer, or become icy. This one is still perfect after four days. The only problem is that I can eat an entire pint in one sitting. Oy.

Real good ice cream. I made it with my uncle's honey from CA

I loved it! The rosemary infusion balances the sweetness of the honey nicely. My wife didn't dislike it exactly but thought it was odd. I could see offering it to guests after a cookout, along with one or two more conventional ice creams.

I made this last night for a dinner party. Everyone loved it! I was a little hesitant as the previous two reviews were split. No-one thought the rosemary was too over powering. I used a local orange blossom honey that also came thru. Served it with a fig tart with goat cheese filling. Nice combo. Made two pints which worked well for 12 people.

Not super crazy about this one. The rosemary was a bit overwhelming and hit me right off the bat and not as a subtle after note. The mix of the savory rosemary and the sweet ice cream was just not for me. Made it for guests and no one was quite sure what to make of it. In fact, one said it was like eating the scent of a Christmas candle. I think you'll either love it or not. very distinct flavor.

Downright heavenly. The rosemary flavor is subtle yet complex and the minute the flavor disappears from your tongue, you want more. I added some broken up bits of almond seas salt brittle to it and it was delicious that way as well.
