Delicious! Made it with craisins and the ikea orange/elderberry jam instead of the currants and apricots and it was fantastic! Not too heavy, wonderful combination of flavors. I used Alton Brown's crepe recipe off of the food network since it is the best crepe recipe I have ever found and always turns out. I also halved the recipe and it fits great in an 8" square pan. Definitely a keeper.

Made this exactly as the recipe instructed for New Year's brunch. Was not all that impressed with the apricot caramel; flavors didn't work for me. Everyone else raved though. Baking the crepes in custard had excellent results, and the dish looked beautiful with the crepe sliced and layered. Would try again without the sauce and maybe with dried cranberries instead of currants.

I discovered this dish about 30 years ago in Salzburg - and remembered the name: topfenpalatschinken - but I couldn't find it under this name in your search box. Pity.

I have made this for years and always to rave reviews. Easy make-ahead and add some variations as you like. Yummm

This is one of those super quick recipes that is to-die for. I used another crepe batter recipe, but any reliable crepe will work here. I served this dish at a 60th birthday party, and people went nuts over it. I used the apricot caramel sauce, and home-made vanilla ice cream. It's a wow dish.

Whenever I make this, people go nuts over it. It's also an easy recipe to break down; do the crepes, layer between parchment and refrigerate or freeze, tightly sealed. I substitute snipped dried cherries or cranberries for the currants and I always strain the apricot caramel sauce. I think it's an absolutely incredible dish and it's great at a brunch as well. Don't skip the sauce! Oh, I've also soaked the dried fruit in Grand Marnier before.

I have made this dish for Easter brunch for the past three years. It is divine! I would love to make it with fresh currants, but I can never seem to find these in New Jersey. Great for a true apricot lover.

Enjoyed this dish, very rich so only need small servings. Apricot sauce was a nice balance with these crepes

I made this for an open house and kept the cooked crepes warm in a large chafing dish. They were loved by all.

An excellent rendition of one of my favorite dishes. (Topfenpalatschinken). Try it with hot vanilla sauce.

Very good. But,I wouldn'tcut crepes,they stuck together and looked messy. Also, crepes got big bubbles in them while cooking.

I tried to stick to the recipe but I couldn't. I used strawberry jam instead of apricot and sliced strawberries instead of currants. It was great and the company all raved too. I served it with a compote of strawberries and pineapple. Very tasty. If I ever find dried currants I will try the official version too.

Schweeet! By far the most delicious breakfast I've ever made. Served fresh fruit alongside the crepes. The accompanying apricot sauce was a tad on the bitter side, but it balanced the crepes well, since they were so rich and sweet. It also was more than I needed for the amount of crepes.

My 13 yr old brother, having only knowledge of how to make pancakes, eggs, and frozen foods, now can make crepes with this easy recipe. It was only his first time, and it turned out wonderful. One thing, try putting a little Grand Marnier into the filling......it adds a little flavor.

It is an ab. fab. recipe. Try using mascapone cheese instead of the cream cheese. Only problem very high in fat.
