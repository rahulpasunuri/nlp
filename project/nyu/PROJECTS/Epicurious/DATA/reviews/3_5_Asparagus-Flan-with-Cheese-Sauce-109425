Not terrible but not great. Won't make again.

This was outrageously good. I was trying to replicate a delicious dish I'd had at Escopazzo, in Miami Beach, and this recipe seemed to be very similar. Their version, however, had pan-roasted chanterelles and white truffle oil added as a finishing touch to the cheese sauce. So I did just that. I also baked the flans in 6 ramequins, poured the cheese sauce on each plate and inverted the flans onto the sauce. The white truffle oil is the secret ingredient here, and a little goes a long way. This tasted almost as good as the restaurant version. Highly recommended!

Tasty, but I don't recommend cooking it all in a 8x2 cake pan. It's so delicate that it falls apart when you attempt to unmold it. It fares much better in individual ramekins.

I am chef and owner of the Flavor of Italy Bed & Breakfast in Rome and we make this frequently with great success for our customers. Any cheese or vegetable can be used and it makes a particularly nice presentation if you pour two different color vegetable preparations into the individual ramekins, at the same time, so the two colors are side by side in your finished product. Once baked the flans can be frozen and then re-baked straight from the freezer until heated through. I like to have a dozen or so of these on hand in the freezer for unexpected guests.

I tried this dish the first time and actually found it a bit bland... but I adapted it with a layer of roasted red pepper flan alternating the layers very carefully to boost the texture and the flavor immensely. Make the roasted red pepper flan with the same technigue as the asparagus, only using fresh roasted red peppers (not canned, they hold too much moisture) and be sure to let them sit out after skinning them for a few hours on paper towels to dehydrate them a bit. It adds to the prep time but the difference is fabulous

I made the recipe exactly as presented here. I would say that it was quite good, but not outstanding. It did need to be cooked for a longer period of time than noted in the recipe, but, that wasn't much of a problem. I think it would have been a good idea to add some additional flavoring agents to the asparagus puree: such as finely minced sauteed onion, or garlic, or maybe an herb like thyme or tarrangon. The straight asparagus flavor was a little flat. Still I do like and and will make it again with some flavor addtions. The recipes strong point is that it is a little unusual and that it lends itself to very nice presentation as a first course.

One word: bland. The presentation was indeed elegant, but without the savory cheese sauce, the dish was unbelievably boring for something so beautiful. If I ever make it again, perhaps I'll try to serve it with a less strongly flavored entree.

I've made this several times - once with brocolli because I had some brocolli that needed to be used - and it's gotten rave reviews every time.

I made this for the first time last night,as an accompaniment to a grilled steak dinner in addition to baked potatoes and a tossed salad. It was very well received and I got requests for this recipe. It was easy to make but I put it in the wrong size baking dish and it seemed to take so long to bake. I think I baked it almost an additional hour, but it was great nonetheless. A keeper.

This recipe was silky and delicious. The key is to use a really good cheese. I used stravecchio because that is what I had on hand. My guest was really impressed!

Have made this several times, always to raves. I suggest: (1)baking until it begins to pull away from sides--this way, you know it's done. It is almost impossible to overbake. If it is undercooked, it will be too mushy. It needs to be firm for a good presentation. (2) straining the asparagus mixture through a coarse, not fine, strainer to remove annoying little chunks, (3) when you invert the flan on your serving platter, be certain it is centered because it won't slide. For the life of me, I cannot understand why only 80% elect to make again. This is easy, beautiful and really good tasting. No one has not eaten ALL his/her werving. That says a lot. Cheese sauce is outstanding (and can be used on a lot of other dishes, too), but use Fontina and no substitutes. Just remember to overcook (which doesn't hurt a thing and also makes the sides of the slices rigid) rather than undercook which will result in mushy slices which somewhat collapse when placed on the plate.

I also made this in individual ramekins and it took about 50 mins to cook despite the smaller size. Other flan recipes call for 350 degree oven -- maybe that would expedite things. I kept the asparagus tips aside, steamed al dente, for garnish on top. I made this one day in advance, and then nuked the ramekins to reheat before plating. Very easy to do. My guests almost licked the plates clean. Outstanding. Will definitely make again.

Easy and elegant -

I made the flan in individual 4oz. ramekins, which made a very elegant presentation. Surprisingly, it took about the same amount of time to cook. I think next time I would like to try a lighter sauce, perhaps with lemon flavor.

I found this dish very bland and, although it was easy to make, would not make it again. I made it exactly as specified, but used an 8x8x2 pan because I did not have an 8" cake pan. Also, I hate recipes that call for unusual size pans like this because I never notice until I've started them!

Excellent. The cheese sauce is very rich and really dresses up the flan. Will make again!

I know the restaurant, we're almost neighbors! Here Andrea is known as "The king of asparagus" which may be a little too much, but he surely knows how to cook a very traditional dish like this. BTW this is how i cook all of my veggie flans. A note on fontina: here in Italy you could never find a fontina hard enough to be grated - if it is, it's way too old and it means it's awfully strong, almost bitter in taste. Go for a softer, milder fontina if you want to taste this dish as it's meant to be!

It being asparagus season in Maine, I picked it fresh from the back yard. I could only come up with about 1 1/4 lbs, but that made the dish plenty tasty. "Silky" is exactly the word I'd use. I served it as a side to simply sauteed chicken and garlic sausages, and plated it along with some grapes. Simple yet elegant. I also got a few "woody" pieces, so pushing the mixture through a sieve might be worth it. Great dish for any meal of the day!

Incredibly silky texture! Depending on the asparagus used, one might want to strain the mixture before baking just to get out any "woody" pieces of asparagus. The sauce cools quickly, but would probably do very well warmed in a ceramic fondue pot if serving for a brunch.

This was a fabulous adjunct to our main course. We had a gourmet dinner night at our house, I have never made this dish. I had one person who does not touch asparagus, loved it. So there you have it. I followed the directions exactly. It was great!
