WOW is all i have to say. this is one of the best dishes i've ever made! the flavors of the salad are incredibly complex and the scallops are outstanding. i substituted jalapeno (1 tbsp instead of 1 tsp) for serrano peppers and used lemon zest in lieu of lemon grass, which i couldn't find. this is a definite keeper!

Loved the dressing, but once on the pasta, it didn't have enough kick. Rather than scallops, I marinaded shrimp in the Sweet, salty and sour marinade from July 2011, then put the reduced marinade over the pasta - it was fantastic!

Liked it! Very fresh and easy, though time consuming - especially cuz my husband bought peanuts in the shell:) The blend of herbs and veggies created a lot of flavor. We also made it with angel hair pasta cuz our local store didn't have cello, and we decided we liked it enough to always make it with pasta. Yes, indeed, we'll make it again.

This came out great, really fresh tasting and quite flavorful. I couldn't find any lemongrass and it still was a big hit.

my husband doesn't like scallops so I used tiger prawns instead. It was an excellent salad that can be eaten as a one-dish lunch.

This dish is excellent! I could not find cellophane noodles in my neighborhood and already had my mouth set for this dish, so I used angel hair pasta instead. I boiled it for 4 minutes and then drained and rinsed in cold water. It worked fine. I also added 2 chopped green onions to the noodles. This dish would be great with grilled pork, beef or chicken. Will definitely make this again.

This dish is excellent. I have served several times, sometimes replacing scallops with another meat. As well, sometimes I cannot find, or choose not to afford some of the ingredients, and it is still delicious. Thai sauce is spot on. As is, it is not hot, if you like heat, I would double to start. I cut the cooked noodles using kitchen scissors to make more 'forkable'. Fresh and the flavor melding is incredible.

Wow! I absolutely loved this! The flavors were so fresh and SPICY! I used extra serrano in the sauce since my husband loves it. He does not like fish sauce, however, so I substituted soy sauce. I also doubled the noodles and will be lunching on the leftover salad for a few days. This was the first time I've cooked (the more expensive) sea scallps instead of bay scallops. Well worth the price for a dish like this. Just looking at the picture makes me want to make it again!

Typically I use a recipe for Coquille St. Jacques with scallops. This recipe was an appealing change. The noodles do not need to soak for an hour. 7 to 10 minutes is plenty. I was concerned that the fish sauce would be too strong, so I use 1/8 of a cup instead of 1/4 cup. I really enjoyed the flavors of the dressing and the textures of the salad. I substituted hot sesame oil for the peppers and piñon for the peanuts. I served it with an Argentinian torrontés. Yummy.

Excellent dish. The fish sauce does not overwhelm the other flavors, which was a concern of mine (not a fish sauce fan). The bean thread noodles I used required only 15 minutes of soaking.

Delicious. Used soba noodels, white wine instead of water and omitted the sugar.

Fantastic. I also used soba noodles. I'll definitely make this again.

Yummy! A very fast meal. I made this the other night when I was cooking just for myself. Very easy to adjust for less or more people. I will make it tonight for the family using very thin beef slices

Hey Cook from Chicago could that "something missing" be LEMONGRASS?

Rating: 2
Made the recipe as is with exception of lemongrass which I did not have, but I don't think it would matter much. This dish is ok not great - something is lacking in the sauce, I found it to be needing something not sure what though - not more pepper maybe some rice vinegar would help? not sure. Don't think the shallots add anything either - they will get a little burned if you have large scallops to cook which need longer than 3 minutes. Probably won't try to mess with this again. too many noodles in the recipe also.

I have made this several times now with different seafood - yummo

The mix of vegetables was great -- I only added some shredded savoy cabbage to give it a bit more body. The asian dressing is pretty good -- maybe a bit too much fish sauce. My biggest problem with this dish was that the scallops do not have a lot of flavor in the way they are prepared.

This recipe is great because it's easy to prepare, it's healthful and it can be visually striking. The trick is to present it as a composed dish. Dress the noodles(10 minute soak is sufficient) with half of the sauce. Place the noodles on a platter and arrange the vegetables in rows diagonally on top of the noodles. Repeat with the herbs and peanuts. Garnish with wedges of lime and sprigs of mint. Pass the remaining sauce at the table.

We enjoyed this dish but I agree with the cook from VA who recommended a little more "heat." The recommendation to add more serrano pepper is a good one. Also, I didn't find this particularly pleasing to the eye (although the picture sure looks nice!) so I don't think I'd make it for guests. But I will prepare it again when I'm craving Thai. Might also be good with chicken as a substitution for scallops.

I didn't think this was as good as all the others...I thought it was just okay. It was light and fresh and could be a good dish to make ahead, but not real special

Even without the modifications I made, I know this is a great recipe. Substituted julienned yellow pepper and celery for the cucumber. I evened used Splenda in place of the sugar for the dressing. Sorry. In any case, it was superb. Everyone loved it.

Very good. I gave the scallops a few more minutes than suggested, other than that I kept true to the recipe. I would definetly cut the cellophane noodles in half next time. Perfect light summer dinner.

Really great dish. The Thai sauce was perfect. I have made a variation of the same sauce using several other recipes and this one seems to have the most balanced flavors. Great light summer meal.

My guests couldn't get enough of it!! I didn't have the snow peas but it didn't seem to matter. I will make it again and again.

Loved it and will make it again. I have not made the scallops, but have served the salad as an appetizer with with ahi tuna or with an entree like grilled chicken marinated in cocount milk & red curry Always a big hit

This was really very good. I made as is, but next time would add a little more serrano for added heat and maybe a little more cucumber and use carrot matchsticks rather than shreds. Be careful with the noodles, they don't look like much but sure seem to grow once they've soaked. We had more than enough. All in all, very good and different flavors with the scallops. Will make again for sure.

Fabulous flavor! I served this for dinner last night for my husband and I and in spite of the great reviews didn't expect the "WOW"!! I followed the recipe to a 'T' but next time I will blanch the snow peas. This was the main course and only added a baguette.

this is beautiufl recipe..i didnt chnage anything-but i did saute some mango with the scallops as well as adding some fresh ones for garnish..it sets off the spices with a sensual touch!..

The taste was awesome. I cut back on the cilantro (not a big fan). This was the first time I've bought lemon grass & would definately recommend NOT excluding it - gave the scallops a wonderful delicate flavour.

Very tasty. Be sure to chop herbs very fine. Very similar to other Vietnamese salads I've tried, which I love.

We cook from Epicurious all the time and have for years. I used to rate everything but stopped a couple of years ago. This was so good I have come out of hibernation to tell you MAKE THIS DISH! We only made one exception. We used soba noodles instead of cellophane.
