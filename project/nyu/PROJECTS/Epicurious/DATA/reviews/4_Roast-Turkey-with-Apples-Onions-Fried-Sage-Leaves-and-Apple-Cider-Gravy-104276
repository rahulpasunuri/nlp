Gourmet, surely you have better copy editors than to let this by: "Their widely available in markets this time of year. " They are = they're!

Used this recipe for our Christmas holiday dinner and everyone commented that it was the juiciest, best turkey they'd ever had. We are trying it again tonight. Extended the cooking time at a lower temperature to accomodate side dishes.

Made this for the past thanksgiving sans the sage leaves. Enjoyed by all, however, I tend to tent the turkey in foil in the beginning and then uncover for the last thirty minutes or so. I forgot to do so this time and the turkey breast was much to dry when following the instructions even though it was a beautiful brown color. Next time I'll stick to my old way. The gravy, however, was a nice subtle change from the regular salty flavor.

excellent and easy. this was my first holiday dinner in which i was responsible for all of the preparation and it came out flawlessly. i also used maple glazed carrots to keep this a sweet thanksgiving.

love this recipe...made it last year and will use it for this thanksgiving as well. only problem is that i can not find the lady apples so i had to subsitute with other apples; it probably would be best if i could find the right apples.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2000 - it was a huge hit! I especially loved the cider gravy - a nice change from the typical Thanksgiving fare. Also, the fried sage leaves were wonderful. The reviewer who said that they turned out limp and blah may not have fried them long enough. I used my wok for the frying. My dad and I snacked on them all afternoon as if they were super thin potatoe chips.

Not just for Thanksgiving, I made the turkey for a family dinner sans the sage. Went wonderfully with smashed potatoes and wilted spinach salad. A big hit enjoyed by all from my five year old sister to my grumpy father.

I made this (minus the sage leaves) for Thanksgiving dinner this year. It was so easy and produced one of the juiciest, tastiest turkeys ever. Thanks, Gourmet! I look forward to the next turkey time so I can make it again.

I was inspired by the beautiful cover of the November issue to recreate most of this menu. The turkey was delicious. The apples and onions were unusual and complemented the turkey nicely. The only disappointment were the fried sage leaves, which were limp and unappealing.

I deep fried our turkey, so didn't use that recipe. I did make the turkey stock and the Apple Cider Gravy. The Apple Cider Vinegar had a slightly strong vinegar taste. I believe it called for one cup. I would reduce that amount to 3/4 cup--if I were to make it again. I added a little additional stock to mellow the vinegar flavor. My guests loved the gravy.

Never saw a better looking and never found a way to use so much butter (Yum,Yum); the lady apples and red onions were scrumptious accompaniment and a delight to look at. The wild rice dressing was great; only added a touch of Drambuie to the rutabagas carrot puree. It added a note of profundity to a wonderful combination. THANK YOU gOURMET. kEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
