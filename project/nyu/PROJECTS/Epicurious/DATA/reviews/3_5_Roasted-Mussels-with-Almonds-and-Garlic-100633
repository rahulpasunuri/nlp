We loved this: I'm going to serve it with pasta and crusty bread tonight, with a salad on the side. We might toss in some clams one day just for fun.

One of our favorite quick and easy dinner options. It's a great way to make a Monday-Friday dinner feel like a Saturday or Sunday dinner. I actually only came to this site today because we were planning on making it for dinner tonight and couldn't remember in which issue of Gourmet it originally appeared.

Elegant yet easy to prepare. This recipe is beyond compare, and one I will make time and time again. Serve with a crusty sourdough loaf with salted butter. Dip the bread in the broth and let your palate rejoice!

Easy to prepare, made a nice dish for two. Garlic could use extra cooking time.
