Always a hit! I could not find jicama so I used an Asian Pear finely chopped, yum. Spread left over paste on fresh Mahi and sauteed, really good.

I am a caterer and this was definitely a hit!! I also used chopped water chestnuts and pulsed everything together. The chestnits gave it a fresh crunch. I also added a teaspoon of Chinese Five Spice Powder. This gave it an amazing flavor. I served it with Mae Ploy Sweet Chili saice and they were gone immediately. I would like to try a healthier way so I'm going to bake/broil them. I'll let everyone know how they turn out!

I have made this several times now for various gatherings and they are the first thing to go every time. I sustitute water chestnuts for the jicama and it works quite well. I set the deep fryer up on the deck to keep the odor down. If you keep the oil temp regulated they come out light and crispy and delicious. Don't crowd the toasts in the oil.

This is pretty good, but try pulsing all ingredients together just until lumpy paste forms. Butter both sides of each triangle of bread(without crusts)and mound some of the mixture on the bread. Then slide those bad boys into a 350 degree oven and BAKE (not fry) til bread is lightly browned and shrimp is done. Delicious and not all the oil hassle.

this is a very good choice of side items to go with kung po chicken and chinese green beans

Im a newlywed and wanna be chef...so the easier the better at least for now. Extremely easy to make ...my only problem is burning the darn things once the wok oil gets too hot. I made the original Ming Tsai recipe and fooled around with cutting circles out of bread ...blah blah blah and then spreading and frying...but this recipe cuts to the chase..i only omit the jicama because i dont go out of my way to look for it in the smaller specialty stores and use water chestnuts. I dont find the smell terribly offensive in my house but to be honest...i dont have enough room or hands to make them hot out of the wok for too many guests. So my husband and i enjoy them once in a while with a little sweet and sour sauce... Yummy

Wonderful recipe, but don't be afraid of deep frying. If the fryer is accurate, the food will not absorb too much of the oil. To our friend in Morrisville, CA,: I always fry fish outside on the porch to prevent my home from becoming stinky!

The shrimp toasts are delicious, but beware that your house will smell like a Chinese restaurant for at least 24 hours after making these. I enjoyed them, but not enough to stink up my house again for such a long period of time. The smell is yummy at first, and then after about an hour ya really get sick of it.

Great! I sauteed instead of deep frying, I used wheat bread, and I also did not get jicama so I added some celery. Super easy and fast.

It was a big success as an hors d'oeuvre!(I made a green salad to contrast with something fresh). I didn't get the jicama but it tasted great anyway.

Great dish! However, frying, as in the recipe, seemed much to high in fat. Instead I cut bread 1st into four squares, covered with shrimp mixture, then baked, first shrimp side up, for about 5min. @350 then 2-3 min. shrimp down on oiled, lightly salted cookie sheet. Covered with foil and baked another 2-3 min. as shrimp wee not yet done, and another 1-2 min with foil off in order to finish toasting lightly and mildly crisping the bottoms. Would work great as a hot appetizer. Almost 4 forks.
