I've made this many times, following the directions exactly. It's delicious and always a favorite of guests. Easy to make.

This is one of my favorite dishes. I am giving it three forks instead of four because it is a bit ugly to serve. I may cook it too long and therefore my chicken falls apart. I think I am going to try it with boneless chicken next time to see if it makes for a nicer presentation. In fairness to recipe, I did cook it much longer than it says. I have made it twice - once at dinner party and once for family. I think it is perfect for family but a tough one to serve and present for a party. VERY TASTY though and one I will make many times more.

Nice preparation for chicken. Fun to do. I used skinless chicken and seared both sides. Very flavorful and the toasted pine nuts were a nice touch! Lots of ingredients, but I used a Sate seasoning from Penzy's instead of the individual turmeric and sweet paprika, and it worked well. The instructions were a bit unclear about adding the cinn stick+ rest of seasonings, but next time I will put this in with the broth before adding the chicken to better incorporate them.

Literally ok. Not the best instructions to be honest.

Made this twice for different groups of people - dinner parties. Cooked it in an actual tagine which I think enhances the taste of the dish and it went down a treat! Quite an effortless dish as well. Served it with seven veg couscous.

This was exceptionally tasty. The chicken was tender, the sauce is sweet but not too sweet, and very flavorful. I will definitely make this again.

I made this with skinless, boneless chicken thighs, and I used orange zest instead of preserves. Turned out really good, although if I made it again I would use a whole cut-up chicken, more spices and herbs (particularly cayenne), and I might put chick peas in it.

This recipe is ok, but not as full of flavor as I had hoped. It's good, just not great.

I followed this recipe to a "T" and it is wonderful. To the reviewers who proclaimed it "bland", I say: refresh your spice rack! The flavoring may be subtle, but it is far from "bland". Too sweet? -- recipe calls for BITTER orange marmalade, not (the usual) sweet; flavor conferred is quite complex. I served with white rice (rather than coucous) and a simple green salad, made a wonderful meal. This recipe is going into the "keeper" file.

Fantastic dish! I have to admit that after reading other reviewers' comments about blandness that I decided to marinate the chicken to add flavor (I used all thighs) using another Chicken Tagine recipe from this site. It included cinnamon, ground ginger, turmeric, black pepper, salt and olive oil. I also added two chopped carrots and a cup of chickpeas to give it heartiness. I cooked everything in one pot, discarding all but 1 tbsp of the chicken cooking grease. Didn't think it was too sweet at all. The apricots and pine nuts made the dish. It was perfect over couscous and a simple salad of cucumbers and tomatoes. Next time I will use canola or grapeseed oil - the olive flavor was a bit too much.

I made this with chicken thighs in the slow cooker. It was good, but last minute I realized I didn't have any marmalade or a suitable substitute. I added the juice of a meyer lemon but I did with I had added some honey so sweeten it up a bit. I will have to make it again with the marmalade. Without that key ingredient, I would say it was a 3 star dish, so worth trying again.

I reviewed this recipe a few weeks ago and gave it 2 stars. Although I'm one of those folks who hates freezing food and does not agree that it will taste 'fine,' I froze the leftovers. The other day I reheated it slowly in the oven, with a few tablespoons of fresh orange juice poured over the top. I was quite surprised at how good it tasted and now it's up to 3 stars in my book, and I'll definitely try it again.

This is an interesting recipe. Although I have mixed feelings about it, I thought I would provide some feedback for others who are planning to prepare the dish. I used boneless, skinless chicken legs and breasts. Although I prefer white meat, the dark meat definitely worked better and was more succulent. The sauce, when boiled down, was quite good, but there was not enough of it. I would recommend increasing it by 50%. I used regular lemon peel, and some clementine rind. Who knows?--maybe I'll give it another try!

This recipe is a good base to work from and you can adjust the seasonings/sweetness to your taste (as any good cook will always do). I used 12 boneless, skinless chicken thighs which came out wonderfully moist and sweet when simmered slowly with the other ingredients. I substituted chicken stock for, the water, and added 3 cups baby carrots, 2 cups pearl onions, 3 cups yellow, red and orange bell peppers, 3 cups oyster mushrooms and 8 or 10 prunes in addition to the appricots. I also added a large red onion to the shallots at the beginning and added a few tablespoons of both honey and thai tamarind concentrate. I double or quadrupled the amount of tumeric, paprika and ginger and also threw in a few dashes of garam masala, which together with the mushrooms, helped to darken the flavor a bit without taking away from the sweetness of the dried fruits. A southeast asian friend of mine recommended a simple sour salad of cucumbers, tomatoes, & finely sliced red onion dressed with lemon juice, salt and pepper. I served the salad in a side bowl with the tagine on the main plate over couscous. The simple sour salad was a perfect balance to the complex sweetness of the meat. I served the tagine over couscous with currants and parsley, and topped with the spiced pine nuts, which were also a really nice, nutty, warm and crunchy counterpoint to the sweetness of the meat. This is a great dish to make a day ahead for a large group. My guests raved about it, everyone wanted seconds, and I'll do it again.

This is an utterly bland dish. If you are going to make it,lose the marmalade and apricots. They completely ruin it. As it is, it is very poor. I would suggest adding a whole onion, finely diced and bumping up the herbs and spices, but hold the cilantro. I personally don't like it.

We made it with chicken parts, which cut down the work & made it less expensive. All around lovely, and we'll be making it again, but with less preserves next time -- it's sweet enough without that part. The one piece left over was reheated a few days later & the taste was even better!

Rating: 4
This was delicious. It would probably be even better the next day if any of it was left over. However, it's not the quickest or easiest recipe to make. The browning of the chicken splattered oil everywhere and it took a while to prepare all the ingredients. But it was worth it in the end. We had it with saffron rice and it was excellent.

This is a very subtle and refreshing dish that is certainly worth the effort. I used chicken legs and thighs rather than a whole chicken and it worked nicely. I found the spiced pine nuts really finished the dish so don't pass on them. This is excellent served over couscous.

The Tagine is Moroccan, the algerian version is good as well. Instead of using Olive oil It's better to use a neutral oil, like grape sesame oil espacially with sweet Tagines.

I have made this many times and it just fabulous. I use an orange-lemon marmalade. Easy, one-pot meal, great for dinner parties. I pair with israeli couscous.

I made this on a Saturday night. It was a bit of work, but the result was a flavorful and not too spicy dish. The spiced pine nuts made it. It was definitely tasty enough to make again, but I'd have the butcher cut the chicken up for me next time.

I have made this recipe three times. The spice amount is just right. Algerian food is not bold and spicy. It's about depth of flavor and subtle, the spices and sweet flavorings give an "umami" effect.

Absolutely delicious. Delicately scented with spices, beautifully balanced. I don't usually like too many spices but this dish made me a convert!

Rating: 1
Worthless. I followed the recipe word for word and spent close to three hours on this dish. There was absolutely no flavor added by any of the ingredients. It was just plain old chicken.

This was the blandest, most forgetable tagine I've ever tasted. It was how I imagine it would taste if McDonald's had tagine on their menu. The spices listed are in the smallest portions ever, and it tastes like it. I really can't comprehend why it was rated so highly. I tried to add extra spices to jazz it up a bit and it was still boring, with lots of little chicken bones from the use of the whole chicken. Don't waste your time, unless you a spice- phobe.

This was amazing!! I have tried a few other Tagines before, but this was wonderful! I didn't have any bitter orange marmalade, so I substituted with a spicy mango chutney I had in the cupboard. I will definitely make this again!!

Rating: 4
Two thoroughly inexperienced cooks mastered this recipe. I think it has something to do with the marmalade--go heavy on that. And don't forget saffron rice to go with it.

Rating: 4
I would definately make this again. It was an easy recipe, but looked and tasted like I had spent all day in the kitchen. I used 4 chicken thighs instead of the whole chicken. Added some swiss chard leaves (spinach would do too) towards the end of cooking to give it some green, and served over couscous. Wonderful!

Excellent (and easy!) recipe! I am not familiar with chicken tagines, or tagines of any kind, so I made this recipe as it was written - with the exception of using unsalted butter instead of olive oil. IMO, this dish is not too sweet, in case you're worried about that. The apricots add a perfect amount sweetness. The bitter'ish preserves/marmalade balance the sweetness nicely. The pine nuts are sumptuous! They add such a nice texture and richness that puts this dish over the top. Listen to the reviewer who took the chicken breasts out early. I didn't and mine were a bit dry. I will definitely take the breasts out early the next time. As I said, I am not a fan of olive oil (flavor) so I toasted my pine nuts in a little unsalted butter instead. So happy I tried this recipe and it's mostly because of the great reviews on this web site. Keep writing them!

Great, fairly easy recipe. I used two chicken breasts because I was just cooking for my husband and I. I halved the sauce ingredients, but next time I will make the full amount of sauce because a) it's delicious and b) the half recipe reduced a little too quickly. The presentation was beautiful and I am eating the leftovers wrapped in lavash with arugula for lunch!

This was delicious and not difficult to make. I used regular onions instead of shallots and apricot jam instead of marmalade, and boneless breasts. I browned them briefly and then reduced braising time. I will definitely make this again.

Loved this dish. Just used legs & thighs but removed the skin. Substituted chicken broth for the water to make up for it. Don't skip the saffron. Goes great with a side of yellow rice and a nice spanish red.

I thought this recipe was excellent. It was very flavorful. I forgot the apricots at the grocery store so I substituted some dried cherries I had in my pantry. It worked very well. I would not substitute skinless chicken breasts unless you are very health concious, as the most tender, flavorful parts of the dish were the dark meat pieces. I did remove the skin before serving.

Rating: 3
Easy, put together ahead of time meal. Used skinless breasts, 1 pan, doubled apricots and spices. Did not like the pine nuts - threw them out. Used toasted slivered almods instead. Felt it was better compliment to apricots.

This is an awesome recipe. To make it a bit healthier, used breasts with skin removed. Also doubled apricots, garlic, and ginger. Definite keeper.

Rating: 3
Turned out very well. A little sweet, so if you're not into sweet tagines, pass. Extremely quick and easy. Recommend leaving the legs in one piece, though, so that the chicken doesn't dry out. I took the breasts out early to keep them succulent. Also, when you sweat the chicken covered, be sure you have the flame extremely low. I found that the small about of liquid in the pan caused it boil furiously at even a low flame.

This was fantastic. Served with quinoa and the fennel and carrot slaw in the same menu (but left out the sundried tomatoes - seemed like a weird combo). Loved the pine nut topping.

Very good and surprisingly tasty and aromatic. I made one change. Used only one pan. Browned the chicken and all other ingredients and then deglazed the pan. After that transferred contents to a Dutch oven and placed in an oven at 160 degrees.

This was delicious. I don't like orange marmalade, so I substituted apricot jam for it, and I used chicken thighs in place of the whole chicken. Otherwise, I made it just as in the recipe.

this was absolutely delicious. using what i had on hand, i subbed boneless/skinless chicken thighs for the whole chicken and almonds for the pine nuts-- everything came together perfectly and the end result was tender and flavorful. i'll make this again.

This was outstanding. The chicken was moist and tender with the sauce. I used bitter orange marmalade, as I couldn't find blood orange marmalade. The pine nuts do roast very fast, but I used grapeseed oil instead. I served it with a pinot noir.
