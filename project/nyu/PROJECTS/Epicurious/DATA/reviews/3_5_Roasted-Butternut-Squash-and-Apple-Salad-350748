Was a wonderful salad for Christmas Eve dinner. Great array of flavors & colors. I did add toasted slices of almonds for a little crunch. Held well for the timing of masses. Absolutely a keeper.....

What a hit! Hands down, a very tasty and eye appealing addition to our Christmas table.

I have made this for the past two christmas eves and always gotten great feedback- even from the pickier eaters. I always make sure to keep everything separate just until I'm going to serve it and slice the apples at the last second to keep them firm and not brown on the plate. Very delicious!

Meh--I had lots of squash to use up, and it sounded good, but it just wasn't my thing. I'm not a huge fan of on-the-sweet-side salads.

I love this. I roasted extra squash and froze to have available for the next time

Excellent! I tested this to see if it was good enough for Thanksgiving. Needless to say, we loved it! I would not change a thing!

Excellent salad! I made this for a plain old weeknight dinner for my partner and me and we absolutely loved it. It would no doubt make a fantastic, impressive starter for a dinner party.

Really pleasant starter. We found the squash a bit sweet, but with a tart apple and the vinegar, it all worked out in the end. It wasn't the most memorable salad, so I'm not necessarily sure I'll ever think to repeat it. But overall tasty, I'd be glad to have it again.

I made this salad to start our Christmas eve dinner. Everyone LOVED it. Roasting the butternut squash is a bit more work than I would want for a salad but worth it. I used Point Reyes blue cheese

So wonderful! Perfect for when guests come over and you want something aesthetically pleasing and light but complex to start a big meal. I used some very good Danish blue cheese, and dried currants instead of cranberries. I also tossed the squash with some salt at the end after roasting. Loved it.

A delicious winter salad. The squash was sweet and soft with the brown sugar balsamic glaze and the endive is a nice crunchy bitter compliment. Very easy to serve at a winter dinner party and super tasty. I would make just a bit more dressing, other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

This is one of the most amazing Fall Salads I have ever fixed. I served it for a dinner party of Six. Everyone wanted the recipe. Thank you! This is a keeper for sure.

We loved this recipe. The flavors were great and using a good quality blue cheese is key!

I thought it was pretty good, but I love all the ingredients. The squash takes awhile to make - next time I'll probably just toss together and bake rather than brushing each one individually. It's a heavy salad.

This salad looked beautiful, but just didn't taste very good. The balsamic flavor was overpowering. There was simply too much bitterness for what I was hoping was a sweet, tangy salad. Maybe if the butternut squash wasn't roasted in the vinegar, and if there was a different dressing?
