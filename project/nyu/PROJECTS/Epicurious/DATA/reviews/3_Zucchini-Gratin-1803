We really liked this easy, tasty dish. I used fresh thyme from the garden instead of tarragon, 1 clove of garlic sauteed with the zucchini, and a mixture of Gouda and pecorino (that is all I had in the house...). I did find it a bit heavy for a side dish, so I would make it next time as a vegetarian main course.

Substitutions: used cooking spray instead of buttering the dish; used oregano instead of tarragon & used half-and-half instead of milk. Pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the dish - it reminded me of a zucchini casserole my mother made when I was a child. Next time I'll try adding sauteed garlic or onions and maybe use a different cheese (or slightly less parmesan). But, really the recipe as is yields great "comfort food."

I shredded the zucchini, used dill in place of tarragon, pecorino romano for the cheese, used milk & 2 eggs, no cream. I also mixed it all together with 2 cups of cooked pasta for a complete side dish to compliment my broiled salmon. umm yummy!

I make a very similar gratin, but I substitute feta cheese for the parmesan and use dill instead of the tarragon. I also add some chopped garlic in the layers. As for the custard, I make it with eggs and yogurt as opposed to the milk and cream. Another review suggested to salt the zucchini to draw the water out and to grill them after - I do that too and it works better. (And yes, if you put too much salt, you will need to rinse them with water after - just taste them before you cook them). Good luck!

I wasn't keen on the custard idea, with the eggs and the cream, so I used a bechamel I made with garlic and bay leaf and minced onion, removing the garlic and bay, and added a dash of cayenne and nutmeg before pouring over. I grilled the zukes first and threw in a handful of finely sliced fennel in the middle. With the tarragon, it was really great. Don't bother salting the zukes first, just grill and it works.

Not to my family or my liking. Bland. Missing something... Can't quite put my finger on what, but it somthing

Followed the recipe as written, except that I added some garlic to the zucchinis, but was unimpressed with the result. It was OK, just not special and rather uninteresting. I might try to jazz it up with some other flavorings but in the meantime, will keep looking for a more appealing zucchini gratin recipe.

This is unique and delicious. The only change I made was to add 2 cloves of minced garlic to the custard, but I don't think it was needed. As to criticism that frying the zucchini is tedious... I bought 3 large zucchini and cut it on the diagonal about 1/4 inch thick. So there weren't that many pieces, and the frying over medium high heat went quickly. The rest of the preparation is a snap. IMO, the tarragon (or another fragrant herb) is essential in the custard.

I sauteed the zukes and then followed the recipe exactly (omitted the tarragon, yuck) and it was delectable! As sensual an eating experience as cheesecake. Make this now.

I am sure glad I read the other reviews first. Instead of sauteeing the zucchini, I blanched it then left it to drain in a collander for awhile. I did press it to get all the moisture out. Then I proceded with the recipe. I did add a bit of garlic powder and pepper to the recipe as well to give it a lift. I sprinkled it at the same time as the tarragon. It turned out just fine this way.

Im sure this is a great recipe, however it was rendered inedible after I followed the French chef's reccomendation to coat the zucchini in salt to help remove the water. BE SURE TO RINSE THE SALT OFF, DONT JUST PAT IT DRY. Im sure it will be nice when we reuse it as compost next year.

I didn't follow the reviews for this recipe and the result was disappointing. The cream, etc. separated into what looked like curds and whey.I guess the zucchini had too much liquid even though we sauteed them first.

We followed the advice of broiling the zucchini, and to further lighten the recipe we coated the dish with cooking spray, used skim milk and half and half, and it was delicious.

Try salting and broiling the zucchini first. Cut the zucchini into rounds, sprinkle with salt and let sit for an hour, after pat dry with a paper towel and brush with olive oil. Place under the broiler for about five minutes or until browned. I promise you will make for a delicious gratin.

With just two of us, I made a half recipe. Although it looked rather skimpy as a result, it was still delicious. I agree with another cook that browning the zucchini (even for my half recipe) did get tedious. Luckily I had allowed plenty of time. Possibly I had sliced the zucchini too thinly because I couldn't get them all in the same skillet.

I too live in Boston...just wondering where the other cook from Boston found the "red zukes". I am a caterer, always searching for the new and different. This recipe is a classic, however I almost always use creme fraiche instead of the heavy cream, it is cultured and more stable. Mostly I make my own but Vermont Butter and Cream has a good product too. I always use garlic too. If I want "subtle", I infuse the milk and cream by heating with halved garlic gloves, then remove them. If I want "not-so-subtle" I ad minced garlic to the zucchini while sauteeing!

Awesome, awesome, awesome. I have made this recipe twice on holidays, and it has been very well received. This one's a keeper.

This is wonderful. Add some Havarti to the parmesan cheese and make sure to let the gratin rest after taking it out of the oven.

I didn't have any Parmesan cheese so I used cheddar. This may be why I was underwhelmed at this dish. The zucchini were far too soggy for our taste - I thought as well that there was a lot of work frying the zucchini in the pan before it went into the oven. If I decide to make it next time I will definitely broil the zucchini under the broiler until it is very very golden brown, with a bit of crispness to prevent any sogginess. And I will definitely use the correct cheese nest time! Nicole @ Alberta

This is also a great way to clean out the crisper drawer! I used red & yellow zuke, cherry tomatoes, carrot slices, shallots and broccoli florets cut small. I sauteed the shallots, left the cherry tomatoes raw and POACHED the rest of the vegs till just tender. Used Cracker Barrell cheddar as the cheese and it was utterly delicious!

This is a very nice vegetable side dish which I plan to use at holiday dinners. Just be sure to bake the gratin long enough. I made a mistake and took it out too early and the custard was not set. It was delicious anyway!
