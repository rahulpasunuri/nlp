The recipe is easier to make if you chop the parsley with a knife, then use the side of the knife to work in the butter, right on the board. If you want to add more to the sandwich, tomatoes are in season at the same time as vidalias.

It was too much work for a sandwich, but it tasted good. I felt like it needed more ingredients on the sandwich however.
