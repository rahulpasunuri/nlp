This was delicious! I made it with what I had on hand: leftover roast chicken and associated stock made from the carcass, instead of thighs/legs and warm water for the rice; a pint of cherry tomatoes chopped up, instead of canned tomatoes; frozen raw medium-size shrimp, instead of fresh jumbo shrimp. Because the shrimp were frozen when they went in, they didn't get over-cooked. I added a touch of oregano and paprika because I didn't use it to marinate the chicken, and added frozen artichoke hearts along with the peas. Skipped the lobster and clams. The dish was truly wonderful and had a very authentic spanish taste. The sweetness of the tomatoes and peas was a perfect complement to the savory chorizo and rice. It is important to use good saffron, the correct rice, and to not stir. My husband and son devoured it and said they wouldn't change a thing.

I really enjoyed this recipe, having lived in Barcelona for a year... I thought that the taste of the chorizo was too strong and we didn't need to pricey lobster. Maybe next time I'll add more vegies, cook the chorizo seperate and leave out the lobster. Will make again!

This dish is fantastic! It is also visually pleasing and quite easy to make. I made a paste with the oregeno and paprika by adding some crushed garlic and olive oil. I worked this into the chicken and let it marinate a little longer. To eliminate the problem of the thighs not getting done before the rice mentioned by another cook I used boneless thighs and I cooked the chicken a little longer before putting it in the rice. My guests raved about this dish. I will definitely make this one of my signature entertainment dishes.

The chicken thighs were not cooked through by the time the rice was done. Twenty minutes is way too long to cook the shrimp and clams--I put them in with the peas at the end (did not use lobster). My family was not impressed by this dish.

Amazing! I have been using Epicurious' recipies for a long time :) This one was awesome, I added more shrimp and clams, and doubled the rest including the rice, my Mom took it to work they loved it!!!

This recipe caught my eye as I was enchanted by Spain, it's food and it's history after a trip a few years ago with my now husband. I am certain that the restaurant that inspired this dish was in fact Los Caracoles Restaurant, "the snails" which began as a tavern in the 19th century and is one of Barcelona's best known restaurants. Carrer dels Escudellers 14, Barcelona, Spain

I have made variations of this "paella" many times with much success (even a meatless version). Whether using shrimp, lobster, clams, mussels, squid, whatever, the key here with paella is the rice. Find real paella rice (short grain spanish; I found it at Wms. Sonoma) and learn to cook it properly with the socarat as Tyler advises. A Spanish friend uses authentic paella pan with special burner but any large shallow pan will work. Also try to get fresh chorizo from butcher/spanish grocer as the packaged stuff is much less tasty.

Come on people . . . who cares how many peas and every one doesn't like clams and etc. or add enough for four. Use Shrimp instead of Lobster. We are talking about taste. The chicken change it to 4 breasts or 4 thighs the recipe is very good and very colorful.

...and shoot, 47 peas in one-half cup! That's an odd number! Now what?!

I haven't tried it yet. I am wonering how many persons this is to serve. The only way you can divide the ingredients (4 shrimp, 6 clams, 4 pieces of chicken, etc) is by 2, if my math is correct. And this is a heck of a lot of food for 2! Yet the recipe sounds great.
