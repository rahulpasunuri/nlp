This recipe was fantastic!!! I did 1/2 of the recipe for 4 people and there are still leftovers 2 days later- makes a lot of food! I used the soft ladyfingers my stores' bakery sold. Defiantly adding to my repertoire!

Also really impressive as a trifle. Beautiful for the 4th of July or Bastille Day.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I made a few changes though. I just used one package of frozen berries, which I boiled with sugar, water and a little bit of flour to thicken. I strained and kept the solids for layering in the dessert, instead of also buying berries in syrup. I added Creme de Cacao to the liquid instead of raspberry liquor, and it was a really nice combo. I made this for a dinner party and it was completely eaten in about an hour. Delicious, and other than soaking and layering the lady fingers it was really easy to do. Already looking forward to making this again!

Made this for this Thanksgiving and it was gone within minutes. Receive great review on dessert. I used Chambord for the liqueor and turned out great! A keeper.

My wife won the Blue Ribbon in the dessert category at the 2007 Taste of Grand Rapids Barbecue Contest with her Michigan Berry Tiramisu. With the WOW!!! factor for this dessert, no one else had a chance.

I've made this often, always with great results. Sometimes I substitute 1 cup of whipping cream, whipped, for 1 of the 8- ounce containers of mascarpone. Just fold it in after mixing the cheese, sugar, and vanilla for an airier, more spreadable cheese layer. This avoids the raw egg concerns some people may have. Also, you can use whatever berries are available.

This dessert was a HUGE hit at my party. The guys had 2nds! I couldn't believe it, and it looked beautiful too. The only thing I did different was I couldn't find any raspberries with syrup so like the other reviewer I added sugar and some vanilla to the raspberries, I also pureed them and needed everything for the sauce to dip the fingers in (didn't put through sieve). I also couldn't find raspberry liqueur so I used blackberry. It got rave reviews, I will definitely make it again!!

kstarnes50, I think the only thing I did "wrong" was not following others' suggestions. my review was meant to help others not end up with dry lady fingers (a problem others have had in their reviews) and too-thick filling (also a problem others have had). I believe this recipe could be much better with the suggestions other made and hope others will follow them rather than, like me, hoping the recipe will turn out fine by itself.

I don't know what "elaffint from Texas" did wrong but I've used this recipe for several years to impress guests. And impressed they are! It is expensive so I only use the exact called for ingredients for special guests but it seems to make no difference. Love it either way.

It looks like MOST of the people who "love" this recipe have made significant alterations (adding eggs, adding sugar, etc). I opted to make this "as-is" and was sorely disappointed. If you make this recipe, I suggest scrolling through and using others' suggestions. I made it as written and - I had about half of the syrup/liqueur mixture I needed - The mascarpone/vanilla/sugar mixture was very thick and tasted very blah Since a tiramisu is, to me, all about the lady fingers and the filling, these two problems killed the recipe for me. I think that maybe beating eggs with the sugar might have helped, or mixing some whipped cream with the mascarpone could have helped... But as is this recipe is NOT worth it. There are MUCH better tiramisu recipes available. While this wasn't horrible or anything, it definitely wasn't an outstanding recipe. Fresh berries, mascarpone, and lady fingers are outstanding raw materials and it comes out pretty, and while it's definitely edible, it could be much better than this recipe.

I brought this to a friend's dinner party. It was delicious! Everyone raved. Out of necessity I made some alterations . . . I didn't have Raspberry liquor so I substituted Creme de Casis. My frozen raspberries were without syrup so while they were defrosting i added some sugar to them and then added additional Monin vanilla syrup to the raspberry juice and liquor before dipping the lady fingers. We ate this about eight hours after assembly and it was perfect. The lady fingers had soaked up the flavors deliciously. I'm anxiously awaiting another opportunity to make this extraordinary dessert again. BTW: I also added a couple egg yolks to the mascarpone it added extra richness.

This was certainly an expensive dish as some reviewers noted. I would make it again only for a special event. I made a few changes. I substituted seedless raspberry jam for the reduced raspberry syrup. I worried that just quickly dipping the lady fingers in the raspberry sauce wouldn't soak them thoroughly and I was partially right. By the next day they were soaked nicely, but when we first dug in a few hours after finishing it, it still tasted good. Overall, this was expensive, but excellent.

Delicious dessert. I used lady fingers as well and added 3 egg yolks to the mascarpone. I only used strawberries and omitted the alcohol. Everyone loved it.

This dessert is delicious. The presentation is terrific. I used lady fingers, and next time I will soak them longer in the raspberry mixture to soften them to the center.I omitted the alcohol, and increased the raspberry syrup. I put it on a cake stand with fresh mixed berries surrounding and atop,Not a drop left!

I used this recipe to make my son's birthday cake and was very pleased with the results. However, I made the mascarpone filling in keeping with the more traditional tiramisu recipes. I added 3 egg yolks to the sugar and beat it until pale yellow before adding the mascarpone. Then I whipped the 3 eggs whites with a few tablespoons of sugar until it formed hard peaks. Then I folded the two together. Without this step, I tend to think that the filling would be too heavy. I omitted the liquer because the party was for 4 year olds! The cake is beautiful and is not difficult to make. The children all loved it and so did the parents!

I have made this recipe many times since 1993. It is always a hit. At times I have made it using mixed berry jam instead of cooking the frozen berries. ANd I skip the liquer so all guest can have it.

I made this for Easter and it was a hit. I made my marscapone from the recipe and used all of it. I also added 3 egg yolks to the marscapone to make it creamier and I layered the ladyfingers in the bottom of the bowl and after the first layer not around the sides, more like a rustic tiramisu.

What a delicious dessert that looks so beautiful! I followed some of the suggestions--added more sugar and vanilla, slowly soaked the lady fingers,and increased the amount of fruit on top and around the base of the plate. Put this dessert on a pedastal dish, and you will wow the crowd. I made this for a friend's 40th, and it was a hit--I made a smaller version the next weekend for more friends.

I just ran across this recipe again and realized it has been a while since I made it. I usually make it for parties or picnics, and as another reviewer stated, it is usually gone in minutes (most people grab a slice of this before any main courses), so get a piece for yourself as soon as possible. It is a bit time consuming the first time, but is quicker with each attempt. Have fun with the decorating - making different patterns with the fruit are easy and really impress!

Made this for a party, and it was a big hit. Delicious, not really all that difficult to make. Was not able to find frozen raspberries in syrup anywhere, so just used straight raspberry liqueur. Made for a slightly more "grown-up" dessert.

I've been making this tiramisu for 7 years! It has always been the favorite at any social function and we have many being military. I always make a little extra syrup for dipping the lady fingers...Hint: Trader Joe ladyfingers work the best for this one and I would not dream of using frozen berries on top of this dessert as the presentation is absolutely outstanding! As for the cheese...using the real mascarpone is a must and I always buy extra berries to decorate the top and the serving dish...yes, it's expensive to make but well worth it! This is a keeper!

Made this for our Easter dinner finale. While it looked beautiful when presented at the table and the taste was fabulous, it made a dreadful mess when cutting.....crumbled and fell apart. Everyone had seconds, so it was a hit---taste-wise. For that reason, I may try again. The stiffness of the mascarpone-sugar mixture may have been much the problem (Interesting that other reviewers found it runny?), pulling everything apart when cut. Perhaps I'll try adding eggs to it next time. And perhaps I'll let the dessert sit at room temp. a while before cutting. I also found that I didn't have enough syrup to dip all the ladyfingers, so will use two containers of raspberries.

Everyone loved this dessert this past Easter and Thanksgiving. This last time I followed Matawan's suggestion of whipping 2 eggs with the sugar, using extra sugar as well (3 Tbsp.) and extra vanilla (1-2 tsp.). This gave the marscapone mixture a creamier texture and a richer flavor. I also suggest using more liqueur and/or syrup for the outside ring of ladyfingers. Don't quick dip these. I think the outside ladyfingers tend to stay a little dry. Maybe I need to make the dessert the night before and let the ingredients soak in well. Quick tip: In lieu of liqeuer, I used inexpensive blackberry brandy and boil it down to get a stronger flavor. First class!

I served this at a dinner party tonight and it was a big hit! Everyone asked for seconds and many wanted the recipe.I didn't use Chambord; it's very expensive so I used 2 packages of the frozen raspberries instead. I also doubled the frozen mixed berries and sugar used for the jam. I used more bluberries and strawberries than the recipe called for which came in handy when decorating the top.I found authentic Italian Ladyfingers ($2.98) at a local wholesale food store in the gourmet section so I used them in place of the Champagne Biscuits. I trimmed the bottom of the biscuit to create a straight edge and they stood against the edge of the pan perfectly. This version of the recipe serves 12 VERY generously, and it looks elegant!

This dish was both simple and beautiful. Since I always taste my food before completing it, I added 2 egg yolks to the sugar and whipped til light and creamy. I added more sugar, as well as more vanilla extract , almond extract, as well as marsala. I would suggest either the vanilla or the almond, not both and it does not need the marsala- maybe because I used prety much straight chambord (mixed with a little jam) for soaking the lady fingers because it is what I had in the house. A delicious 'adult' dessert. Next time I will use half raspberry syrup, half chambord for the ldy fingers. Definitely use fresh berries on top! Beautiful AND delicious!

The first time I made this recipe was for my step-sons 14th birthday - he's now 24 and every year he asks for the same. Every time I make this tiramisu everyone raves about it. A wonderful presentation, taste and not difficult to make one of the best desserts - great for all ages!

I served this dessert tonight and it was very delicious. A little time consuming but well worth the effort. I used the recipe as is, and purchased the mascarpone cheese, but I imagine if you make your own mascarpone cheese it would taste just as good and probably less expensive. Also for the process of dipping the lady fingers, I placed the raspberry juice and liquour into a glass. It makes for a faster even coating. The dessert cost me around $38.00 to make. My guests were very pleased and I will definitely make this dessert again.

Great presentation and flavor. It's definitely expensive ($45-50) but worth it. Assembly was a little time consuming but otherwise an easy recipe. I doubled the dipping syrup for ease of dipping. Cutting and serving was messy as the cheese mixture was a bit runny. My dinner guests loved it. It will make a great presentation for a 4th of July party.

I made this recipe for my Mother's birthday and our dinner guests absolutely LOVED it. Due to time and ingredient availability, I had to make a few modifications: substituted Entenmann's fat-free golden loaf cake for lady fingers, couldn't find frozen rasberries in syrup so used frozen raspberries and Torani sugarfree raspberry Italian syrup, and I addes almond extract in along with the vanilla extract. I also used a pastry brush to coat the pound cake strips so they didn't get too soggy. Yum!!!

I got rave reviews on this dessert at a gourmet dinner club. Some said it was the best Tiramisu they had ever had. I went heavy on the liqueur went soaking the lady fingers and used extra berries to decorate. Everyone wanted the recipe. I'll definitely keep this one as a secret weapon!

I don't think I did anything wrong because I went over the recipe several times to see if I left something out, (I followed it perfectly) but I found this to be very BLA! Especially the marscapone, sugar, and vanilla mixture. It wasn't very tasty, and the consistency wasn't real creamy. Although it looked beautiful, I wouldn't make this again.

I made this for a 4th of July BBQ and it disappeared before I had a chance to taste it myself. I ran out of vanilla extract and substituted 1 tsp of almond extract instead and it was great. Next time I will brush on the raspberry liquid instead of dipping the lady fingers since they absorbed so much too quickly. Several people asked for the recipe since it was such a hit.

This recipe was a hit! It took it to a BBQ and got many compliments. One persone even called it "Art". It was very tasty but I think I would put a little less of the jam mixture and more fresh berries. The jam turned the Marscapone Purple. Also, I was trying to save money so I did not use alcohol. I used the raspberry juice instead and it worked just fine.

I made this for Mother's Day and all my family LOVED it! We don't drink or use alcohol, so I substituted Grenadine for the raspberry liqueur and it worked beautifully. This is a nice, lighter alternative to the traditionally heavy Tiramisu. I also cooked any left-over frozen berries with sugar and reduced by half to make a syrup that is perfect to drizzle over the tiramisu right before serving, I'll definitely be making this again!

I doubled the recipe to take to a covered dish supper and I received accolades! I had a bit of trouble spreading the marscapone cheese layers, especially the top one, evenly. I tried the old trick that you use with cake icing, of dipping my knife in hot water. Didn't work very well, so I covered the top with more berries to hide the lumpy cheese!

I've made this twice, and the raves were wonderful. Actually very easy to make. When I made it, I found the recipe did not allow enough raspberry liquid for dipping the ladyfingers, based on one package of frozen raspberries, and stores were closed, so I added some Polaner's POURABLE All Fruit to the mixture. Made a perfect substitute.
