Fantastic recipe and easy to make! We're trying to eat less meat and neither of us missed it a bit with this meal :) Definitely would make it again and wouldn't change a thing!

Vegetarian hubby liked this so I may make again. Next time I'll use more kale and less pasta. Life is hard for people without a kitchen scale.

Excellent week night one pot recipe. I used 5-6 cups packed kale and added artichoke hearts and sun dried tomatoes. Substituted parm for feta, but only because I forgot about the feta (it was even in my fridge...). This was great!

This dish is so wonderful - mostly due to the parsley-lemon peel-garlic mixture. I would recommend using two large garlic cloves, though. Also, I skipped the olives and feta, but added a generous squeeze of lemon juice. Next time I make it, I'll try it with the olives and feta, I'm sure it will be even better. This is a great dish for a week night dinner.

Easy recipe, made as detailed. Appx 3/4 fresh kale and 1/4 bagged spinach. Added sun dried tomatoes and sliced almonds. Squeezed fresh lemon over the finished product.

This recipe has made it into ourmregular weeknight rotation...fast, flavorful, healthy, and doesn't dirty a lot of dishes. It is easily veganized for non-dairy people too. I usually use 2 big bunches of greens (1 lancinato kale and 1 chard).

I used whole wheat penne, no added salt and about 1/2 the olive oil called for. Other than that I followed the recipe using a mixture of greens. My husband and I agreed, it's a keeper.

Made the dish with some alterations and loved it! Can't claim a one pot wonder though... Caramelized 4 large shallots and sauteed some garlic in EVOO. Added kale, a few splashes of apple cider vinegar (didn't have lemon) and a bit of water to help it cook. Once cooked, I added a few diced sun-dried tomatoes, a handful of toasted pinenuts, chopped, buttery green olives, and some herbed feta on top. Tossed it with cooked pasta and another drizzle of olive oil. Voila. Healthy and delicious. In time I started the meal to time we started doing dishes (after eating) it was an hour. Can't complain about that. Especially because that timeframe included opening a bottle of red wine...

I love the lemon in this recipe, and so do my kids. My goal was to introduce my children to healthy meals that include healthy greens, and this one meets that match. I have to tell you that I leave out the olives (though it's a key ingredient, I'm sure) and just use kale, pasta, lemon peel (with a little juice) feta (or goat) and garlic. I put grilled chicken on top of it, and serve it as a meal. My kids love it, and who can complain? They are eating kale and i'm happy!

I'm not sure how this recipe got such great reviews. It was just okay, decent for a quick meal on a weeknight, but i'm not sure we'll be making it again.

Thought this was good, not great. Yet a handy recipe for a weeknight when you have the ingredients in the pantry. Used kale and whole wheat pasta, and slightly less olive oil than called for.

I liked this alot; has a lot of my favorite ingredients. The only think I added was some freshly chopped basil as I thought the parsley was overpowered by the feta and the olives.

Rating: 4
This recipe is good (needs a lot of seasoning and the more feta the better), but it gets four forks based simply on how easy it is, and how economical it is. This is one of the fastest pasta dishes Ive made yet without too many dishes to clean: the spinach doesnt need washing, you can easily find kalamatas that are already pitted, so the only thing you really need to worry about doing is chopping the garlic and parsley and grating the lemon peel. Piece of cake. Its also very cheap to make, and best of all: its just as delicious cold, which makes a perfect lunch for work. Brilliant!

Needed more feta and more olives. Do not skimp on the salt and pepper.

Excellent for kale skeptics! We found this to be too oily for our liking the first time and cut the amount of olive oil almost in half and still thought it tasted great.

This is very tasty but needs a little tweaking. Next time I will do as some others suggest and sautee the greens in olive oil and garlic to give them more flavor.

This salad is so good! I recommend tasting before adding any salt at the end- between the feta, olives, and salted cooking water it's pretty salty without adding more. Otherwise perfect.

Delicious! I guess it depends on the kids, my three love sauteed greens with garlic and olive oil. Adding pasta, olives and cheese-yum! A keeper!

I can't wait to make (EAT!) this again! A delightful combination of flavors and healthiful ingredients. I chose kale and used whole wheat pasta. Instead of garnishing individual servings, I tossed the parsley mixture into the entire dish. It keeps well and makes a satisfying lunch. I see it's listed under kid- friendly, that may be a stretch..

I added toasted pine nuts to this recipe. Great flavor!

So easy and so good, plus quick. I used frozen spinach, zapped it in the microwave. Chopped up fresh parsley with the chopped olives and grated lemon rind. Cooked the pasta and put it aside. Sauteed the spinach with the garlic in a bit of olive oil for a few minutes. Then added the olives, parsley and lemon rind; sauteed for a minute or so. Then added the cooked pasta, sprinkled in the feta. Stirred it all up and YUM. Next time I might try adding some crumbled bacon.

My entire family loved this recipe. I left out the olives, because I was serving a bunch of picky teenagers, and I also served it topped with grilled chicken strips. Each child had at least seconds, and one (a boy that only eats chicken tenders and cereal!) had 3 helpings...and would have had more, if there was any left!

RE: Green Olive confusion cited in some of the reviews.... I think this is a typo and the recipe is really for " Penne w/ GREENS, Olives and Feta" :)

I liked the taste of this recipe, but next time I would fiddle with it. I salted the water extra as suggested. But when I took out the greens, they ended up clumping together and I never did get them to really 'separate' into the pasta. My kids didn't appreciate the clumps of greens. Next time I would spread the greens on a cookie to sheet to add bit by bit to the pasta. One of my kids said the olives and cheese should be condiments to add as you wished. So if you're making this for a family, keep in mind. It is a good use of greens from the garden or CSA as someone suggested. Would make again, but I would tweek it. It's good cold the next day as well.

Also! You must heavily salt the water for cooking the greens, or they will be bland. The greens get a lot of flavor from blanching in the salt water. Some famous cook says water for cooking vegetables should taste like the ocean-- definitely err on the side of saltiness!

I'm making an effort to incorporate more kale into my diet, and I found this to be a good, easy dish that I will make again. I served it as a side dish with chicken sausages. I did add a lot more garlic and some butter, which I sauteed with the olive oil before adding it to the dish. I would add more lemon peel next time. I might try adding some sauteed mushrooms, too. I'm giving it 3 forks since I tweaked it a bit and I think the recipe could use a little more flavor, but it's well worth trying.

Rating: 4
This is a seriously good pasta dish-- way more than the sum of its parts. I used a small bunch of kale plus a small bunch of chard-- I feel like the heartier greens might stand up better than spinach-- and I must admit I probably also doubled the cheese. I think mustard greens might overwhelm the lemony flavor but if you like mustard greens that might be ok with you.

Rating: 4
This is so fantastic and a great way to use up those CSA greens lingering in your fridge. I used mustard greens, collard greens and spinach and it was delicious. I will definitely be making this again!

Rating: 4
This was an easy-to-prepare and delicious recipe. Definitely go heavier on the garlic, feta and olives or else reduce the amount of pasta. I did add red pepper plus 4 cups frozen blanched kale from my CSA and a bit of frozen spinach (I just thawed both in a pan on low for 10 minutes along with a few tbsps. of water). The dish was delicious! It's just as good cold as hot and can be eaten the next day. I always thought kale was bitter but it didn't taste that way in this recipe.

This is one of our favourites - great for casual group dinners as well. Everyone seems to love it! I don't change a thing - and I find rapini works great.

This was bland. I used spinach, and I think sauteeing the spinach with garlic would have made it better. As it was, you bit into totally unflavored spinach. It definitely needed more of everything (especially if you used the full pound of pasta). I used bowtie pasta. I added extra garlic and some lemon juice. I didn't use cooking water and instead used olive oil. It needed a ton more feta and olives to give it flavor.

My fiancee liked this but I didn't. I made it as directed, tasted it, and decided it was missing something. I added red pepper flakes, more lemon, more pepper and a can of diced tomatoes. Still felt like it was kind of bland, and I just can't figure out to add to make it better.

i too wonder about the green olive title when clearly thise recipes cries out for kalamatas, as stated in the actual recipe. Nevertheless, the recipe is readily adaptable and lends itself to whatever is in the fridge. Personally, I have used chevre because that's what I had on hand. Secondly, try it with orrichiette, if you can find these 'pasta ears,' for a nicer alternative to the standard penne. Yum, I making some again tonight!

I have made this recipe a few times and always love it. I have changed it a little with each rendition. I add a bit more garlic, a pkg of mushrooms sliced and sauteed, and only use 250g pasta. My favourite green for this recipe is Swiss chard.

very delicious - I used less pasta, less oil and more of everything else - mixed olives, a dash of red pepper flakes, and 3 cloves of garlic. Yum!

This is so delicious. I love this recipe. My mom has made it several times and changed which greens she used each time. To make things even easier, she just substituted basil pesto for the parsley, garlic, olive oil mix. I know that's a mod on the recipe, but I'm sure the original would still be good. I'm craving some right now. Yummy!

I haven't made this dish so I won't give a rating. But can someone explain to me why it's called Penne With "Green Olives" and Feta? Kalamata olives are black are they not?

Very tasty. I used kale and 1 pound was 1/2 pound too much. I used one more clove of garlic and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes added to the parsley and 1 cup feta. I simply tossed everything together with 3 T olive oil and salt and lots of pepper.

Despite not being a huge fan of feta, I found this dish very flavorful, simple, and an excellent pasta salad for early spring. I used more greens (about 50% more), less olive oil, and more garlic, but the basic structure of the dish was excellent.

I found this in the April 08 magazine book and decided to make it for dinner last night. I didn't really have any idea where to begin since I'm not big on cooking, but it was surprisingly easy to make. I was nervous, so I undercooked the noodles a little, but my boyfriend and I still loved it. I will definitely make this again (and cook the noodles the right amount of time) now that I have an idea of how it all plays out. I changed the recipe and did not add the olives (I am not a fan). It still tasted great and had an olive-y taste from the olive oil. I also put some fresh squeezed lemon juice with the parsley, lemon peel, and garlic mixture. I will add more feta next time, and I don't know why they ask for 5 tbl spoons of olive oil. I found it to be enough with just three.

I made this last night and it was great -- when the pasta was done cooking, I sauteded a julienned shallot and the garlic briefly before adding the greens (I used spinach). I added the pasta with a little of the cooking water and oil and tossed until the spinach was wilted and then added the feta, olives, lemon zest, and parsley. I also added juice from half a lemon and a good amount of fresh ground pepper. I would add red pepper flakes next time.

I found this recipe in the Bon Apetit magazine this month (April 08) and I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand for weeknight dinner. Serve it with a Lamb course for a fine meal. It is a terrific combination of flavors - and my wife took leftovers to work the next day and people raved about the smell and wanted the recipe too!
