This was an amazing dish with a wonderful combination of flavors and beautiful presentation. As I placed my husband's plate in front of him he said it looked like it came from a 5 star restaurant. I used thinly-sliced pancetta instead of bacon. I had bought lemons and was surprised to see no lemon in the recipe. So, after cooking the pancetta, I sauteed thin lemon slices and then set them aside to use in the presentation. Impressive enough for guests and simple enough for a week night.

delicious and not complicated at all. I used pancetta, and only one small package (4 oz?) while I quadrupled the rest of the recipe. Used way less butter, I'm sure it would have been better with it .... but...

The capers, pine nuts and sage work wonderfully together. The flavors are hearty enough for a winter meal (serve with bread), and yet the scallopini is light enough for a summer dinner (serve with salad).

I have made this several times, I dont remove anything but use cubed pancetta instead of bacon (as it is italian bacon) and added in fresh lemon juice. Served over angel hair pasta it is a great dish!

Healthy Canadian bacon substituted for bacon and olive oil substituted for butter. Pine nuts add extraordinary flavor. Delicioso. My husband raved.

I love this stuff! I used chicken breasts, sliced lengthwise. I also cut back on the butter in the sauce. I served it with asparagus and roasted baby potatoes. Yummy!

I make this dish all the time, it's tangy and wonderful. Don't skip the pine nuts, they are perfect. We also add shitake mushrooms.

Very rich and very yummy. I used pepitas rather than the pine nuts as I don't like pine nuts. My husband loved it and so did I.

The combination of flavors and textures really makes this dish amazing...and yet so simple! I am sure I will tweak it here and there depending on what I have on hand, but this is a perfect 10 as is.

Great recipe-prepared it "as is" for a weeknight dinner. Would definitely make again for a dinner party.

Outstanding recipe made just as is. This veal lover's favorite!

Loved this! Made it with 1 1/2lbs of boneless chicken breasts pounded thinly and doubled the sauce ingredients. Would cut back on doubling the butter next time though-a little rich-and we like butter! Absolutely wonderful flavor. Would also try with pork.

I nix'd the bacon and used butter. Added 2 T fresh lemon juice and two lg portabellas sliced into strips to sauce...they added a nutty, slightly lemony flavor Very good and very easy!

Delicious! Made it with pork - boneless pork loin blade cut and cut thinly and pounded. Didn't use bacon and less butter in the end. Good with mashed potatoes and carrots. Yum!!

A great recipe only I substituted boneless chicken breats for the veal because in my little town in SC veal is impossible to get. It was delicious! I did double the wine, halved the butter, and used 1/2 lemon sliced thin for a garnish along with the fresh sage from my herb garden. The other half of lemon I squeezed on the chicken breasts right before serving. It was to die for! I definitely will make this again for a dinner party!

Quick and yummy. I added fresh lemon juice. Loved the crunchiness of the bacon and nuts. A nice dish to make last minute if you have frozen veal already thinnly sliced as if defrosts quickly.

A wonderful recipe. I pounded the veal first with a meat tenderizer, and then slightly pounded again with a flat surface pounder. And didn't use the sage (don't like it). It's a quick, very rich, great for guests recipe.

For some reason, sauce tasted a bit "greasy," not from a fat-conscious perspective but solely based on taste. Veal came out very tender, though, and the pine nuts were a great contrast.

This was a HIT at our house. The only change I made was to cut the amount of butter in the sauce by a third.

I doubled the sauce when I made this, because most recipes don't make enough. I served this over mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach and everyone thought it was delicious. The pinenuts are great, and I am glad I doubled the sauce.

Nix the bacon and use olive oil instead of butter...you might like it better that way! Good Luck.

a family favorite. Try it with boneless chicken thighs and brown rice ! As for the fat content, get over it -its not a weight watchers recipe.

Interesting flavor, but way too much fat in this recipe. As I was cooking, I kept thinking about how fattening this was going to be for my guests.

We just didn't enjoy the bacon flavor of this dish; it seemed a little overwhelming. Maybe olive oil instead? Has terrific potential...sans bacon.

had this last night on reccomendation of a friemd in oregon; it was outstanding and the sauce had the most unusual flavour; all commented on the ease of preparation and the superb taste; well worth while and definitely on my list of favourites

Delicious and easy. A real keeper. Did the garlic number and served it with tomato'ed couscous. Think it might be good with fish filets.

I thought this dish was wonderful!! Great flavor and easy to prepare. I have made it with bot chicken and veal. Each meat had good results!

I poured off the bacon dripping before adding the butter to the skillet and thought the dish was a tiny bit salty. My husband, on the other hand, liked the dish better than I but said he would prefer MORE bacon. So I will definitely make it again for him because he is a fussy eater and I'm thrilled to find something he enjoys, but for me it was just OK.

I substituted Swordfish for the veal and lost the bacon. I also increased the sauce by 50%. Outstanding.

Would definitely make it again. I sauteed a chopped shallot and garlic in one tablespoon of butter after browning the veal. I also used bread flour to dredge the veal - it thickened the sauce nicely.

I made this for my boyfriend instead of going out for an expensive meal. We loved it. I made this without the bacon and it was wonderful. I would increase the sauce - it was very good.

I served this for 8 at a wine tasting dinner party and it was wonderful. I multiplied by four but only added about 1 T of butter to the sauce at the end. I'll make this again for sure - it was a hit.

This dish was very good and I would definitely make it again. I substituted half the butter for bacon drippings and it gave it quite a powerful flavor. The pine nuts really add a lot to this recipe too.

This was very good! We had to keep the bacon out of our preparation, but it still was very tasty. With the cost of pine nuts being $52 per kilo, you could get away with less. We used three tablespoons which was plenty. Finally, I would add to the sauce quantity - having extra is always wise.

The first time I had ever cooked Veal. This recipe is fabulous. I did add additional bacon and less butter (using a bit more wine to make the consistency right) It is a special dish I will enjoy making and eating again!

Add more bacon for a real treat. Very tasty.

A lovely dish that is fairly easy to make. I have decreased the butter content with no noticeable effect.
