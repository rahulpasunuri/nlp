Made this for a recent holiday party. The flavor combinations were delicious. I made only minor modifications. For the butter cream, I used the same amount of sugar recommended, but made a caramel out of plain white sugar instead of using brown sugar. I also baked the cake at a higher temp and shorter time in order to prevent it from getting too dry. The cake rolled nicely. I will definitely make this again in years to come.

This is a wonderful recipe and the color of buttercream is CARAMEL, very appetizing. I have made it every Christmas since it has appeared in Bon Appetit and have never had any problems with it. It has to be refrigerated for at least 4 hours and taken out of the fridge about 1 hour before serving.

My daughter picked this recipe out to make for her French class. I have made plenty of Buche de Noel's over the years,using various recipes, and this is the worst. The buttercream is an unattractive shade of beigeish/orange. It has very little flavor. The cake is also bland. Just read the reviews, and most of the people who rave about it substituted another frosting, or changed the color of the frosting, etc. Too many great recipes out there to ever waste time on this one again.

I made this with a friend for a holiday dinner; we substituted one of the chocolate cakes from The Cake Bible for our cake (the one with 6 eggs in it). It was a little thin - we should have beaten the egg whites in two bowls since we doubled the recipe; I doubt that the eggs got whipped to the maximum volume. However, the entire thing was absolutely delicious. We also added meringue mushrooms.

Great recipe. Since I do not like the look of a whitish log, I divide the pastry cream in halves and make one half with white chocolate (using half the required amount of chocolate), and one half with dark semi-sweet chocolate(same amount as white chocolate). I use the white chocolate buttercream for inside the Buche and the dark chocolate for the outside. With a little powedered sugar at the last minute, it makes for a very lovely log, that almost looks real. I also use meringue mushrooms, colored marzipan holly leaves and berries, and tiny chrismas decorations to make it look very festive.

Everybody loved this cake. Personally I found it quite bland. Very professional looking.

MAKE THIS ONE! Oh my, this cake is divine. Even people who don't like cake will rave over this recipe. It is elegant, not too sweet and loaded with flavor. It also makes a grand presentation. Don't skip making the candied cranberries. They are beautiful and taste great too.

I first found this receipe when it arrived in my Bon Appetit in Saudi Arabia. That Christmas I made this and repeated the making of this for the next 5 years. After moving back to the states in 1995, I lost the recipe. I decided to look for this again and this year plan on making it again.

Made this for Christmas dinner, and it was a hit, but I had problems with the filling being very soft at room temperature. I may use the caramel-orange buttercream from Rose Levy Beranbaum's The Cake Bible next time. The taste was wonderful though. I also garnished with meringue mushrooms.

The cake recipe was easy and tasted wonderful; it won rave reviews. To lighten the log a little, I substituted caramel-orange mousse for the buttercream filling (I used the recipe on this site for Caramel Mousse Napolean, omitting the butter and adding orange peel) and a caramel orange boiled icing for the frosting. I added meringue mushrooms to the presentation. The candied cranberries were great and added a nice spark to the presentation. I didn't think it was that difficult; you just have to allow for cooling time at several points.

A delicous recipe, but an extremely time-consuming dessert- even for very experienced chefs. Good for a once-a-year spectacle though.
