Great recipe if you are trying to get out of the usual salad rut. I used clementines (satsumas) instead of the grapefruit. I left out the sugar in the dressing and didn't miss it. I would try dried cranberries next time instead of dates, although the dates were great in the salad.

This was good although I suspect with a bit of tweeking it could be great. The shallots were a bit too overpowering (and I LOVE shallots) the mustard greens I got were just a bit too tough for the delicate grapefruit. It is quite a lovely salad and the spicey greens and cool citrus are definitely a nice contrast

Yuck. I'm not sure if I should throw this out or force myself to eat it since it's "healthful." I think it's just personal taste. Maybe I don't like mustard greens and shallots raw or something, not sure.

This is delicious. I used wild mustards from my garden and I did use the pomegranate seeds. We ate this every night until we ran out of dates and grapefruit. Will make it again and often.

This is a wonderful salad with a good mix of sweet and sour plus other flavor nuances. I have made it several times, also with spinach and romaine, but the mustard greens texture and flavor make the best. I also tried it with mayo and sourwood honey.....too sweet.
