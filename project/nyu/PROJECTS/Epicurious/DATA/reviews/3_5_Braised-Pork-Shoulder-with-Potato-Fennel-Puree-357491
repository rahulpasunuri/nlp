I'm not sure exactly what went wrong, but I didn't seem to get the great results others did. I followed the directions for the fennel paste to the letter, but it ended up being more of a runny pesto than what I would describe as a paste. Like others, I did take it out early at about 180 degrees, but that was at about 45 minutes over the 2.5 hours it listed. I did take the foil off and let it brown, but even still the fennel/orange rub didn't have that toasty, baked on coating that I would have expected - still kind of liquidy. The bites farther inside the roast away from the rub were dull and flavorless. I'm glad others had better results! I will DEFINITELY make the potato-fennel puree again on its own, though. It was incredible!!

Made this recipe twice now and enjoyed it both times. To those criticizing the 190 degree temp ... have you ever eaten true BBQ in your life? The pork butt is cooked to 190-200 degrees because that's the temp that allows the fat to develop into collagen, thus resulting in a tender and moist piece of meat. Take it out earlier and it'll taste fine, but no way it's as tender as it should be, and probably also a little fatty. Anything over 200 and the pork will be mushy, but still not dry since it's quite difficult to dry out such a fatty cut of meat. Know what you're talking about before steering people in the wrong direction!

I didn't do this specific recipe but have braised pork shoulders before and love them. To those people who think the cooking time is too long-this is a braise......the shoulder is a tough piece of meat that's meant to cook for a long period of time in liquid at a relatively low temperature to break down the tough fibers and result in meltingly tender meat. It's not a loin type roast that gets dry with over cooking. The longer and slower you braise a shoulder the better it gets.

This recipe was good, but not super memorable. The puree was nice, which I added some cauliflower to because I had some on hand.

This recipe was okay, but not great. My family said it tasted like roasted pork - where was the fennel flavor? And, the orange flavor was over powering. Plus the cooking time is much too long - pork only needs to cook to an internal temp of 160° or even lower. Why do people always want to overcook pork? Will not bother with this again - there are other more flavorful and easier pork recipes and better ways to use fennel - like the grilled salmon and fennel recipe from this site.

Must agree with others. Stopped cooking at two hours, temp was 175 and while not dry, wasn't pink either.

I tried this recipe last night and it was amazing. I did not marinate overnight and added garlic and shallots to the marinade. I also roasted turnips with the potatoes and fennel. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious. Did not marinate overnight (only 2 hrs), but it still turned out incredibly flavorful with the lovely citrus-anise combination. Even non-fennel liking family members enjoyed the pork and the mash. Will be making it again!

Made the recipe as written. I worried about the roast cooking to 190 degrees so I took it out just a little early. It was still juicy and very flavorful. I could not find smaller fennel bulbs so I only used one large one. Even so, with this amount of potatoes, the mash came out watery and overwhelmingly fennel. Next time I will use less fennel or more potato. I will also thicken the pan juices. they were too thin to enjoy.

So tender. Used a 7 lb bone in shoulder. Adjusted for the increase in size. Roasted fingerling potatoes with the fennel and served them whole. It was a religious experience!

This recipe is delicious! Given the relatively small number of ingredients, it is packed with flavor. I followed the recipe (almost exactly) with 2 changes: I added 2 Tablespoons of Pernod (anise- flavored liquor) to the braising liquid, and I took the roast out of the oven at 160 deg (it was 184 by the time it was eaten); it was tender and moist and definitely done. I agree with the other reviewers; cooking it to 190 deg is overkill. Note on recipe as written: The recipe has a sentence written as follows: "Spoon pan juices from roasting pan into small saucepan. Spoon off fat and reserve." It should read, "Spoon off fat, then spoon pan juices from roasting pan into small saucepan, and reserve." As published, it appears that the fat should be reserved but it is not referenced again in the recipe and should be discarded. Please read "Eats, Shoots and Leaves," a humorous book of instruction on the use and importance of punctuation.

I wonder if mine cooked faster because I used a Le Creuset dutch oven rather than covering it with foil? Whatever it was delicious and I had leftovers for the freezer and enough for pork BBQ sandwiches for lunch.I did add a bit of cream to the pan juices to thicken them a bit

The roasting time in the recipe is WAY TOO MUCH! I put it in for the 1 hour, then added the broth and fennel then checked after 1 hour, the meat was done and the fennel was so soft. I didn;t plan on doing the mash. I wanted roasted fennel and roasted potatoes instead. Took out hte fennel and left it to drain. The meat did not need an additional roast at 375, mine was nicely browned and crispy. I did score the fat covering. Roasted my potatoes and brussel sprouts and put the fennel in to dry off at the end!

pork was flavorful, moist and tender. the internal temperature of the pork when we ate it was 170 degrees, not 190-200. the pork was cook through and moist. The potato and fennel puree was AMAZING! better and way healthier than mashed potatoes.

This was very easy to make (remember, you need to start the day before) and the result was outstanding. The best braised pork shoulder I have ever made, flavorful and moist, like my Mom used to make, but with the update of the fennel marinade. I used a 2 1/2 pound roast and adjusted the ingredients and time accordingly. I let it get up to 190 degrees by mistake, but mine came out perfect. This will definitely go in my binder of "Anne's Favorites"!

Great combo of flavors and will definitely make it again. The potato fennel puree we did as more of a rough mash and liked the results. One caution however, if you cook the roast to 190 degrees as the recipe says (what were you thinking BA?) it will be like particle board. Take it out at 160 degrees for much juicier results. Check any government food safety web site. (http://www.fsis.usda.gov/FactSheets/ Pork_From_Farm_to_Table/index.asp) They all say 155 -160 internal temperature for medium and it will continue to cook as it stands out of the oven for awhile.
