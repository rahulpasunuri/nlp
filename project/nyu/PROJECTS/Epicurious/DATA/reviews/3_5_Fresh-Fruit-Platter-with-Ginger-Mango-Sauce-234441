Spectacular! I made it exactly as laid out in the recipe, and would change NOTHING -- this was extraordinary. I think the fact that my mango was just shy of fully ripe was what made the difference, because the flavors were well-rounded and tart, and perfectly balanced. Not too sweet (and I used all the sugar and syrup called for), and certainly not bland. The part that bled over onto the Easter ham and babka went well with those items too! Totally a keeper, this goes into my Easter file for perpetuity.

I think this recipe is highly dependant on the quality of mango used. One reveiwer described this recipe as "bland" but I found it to be full of mango and ginger flavour. I didn't even have to use all of the maple syrup as a perfectly ripe mango is very sweet and flavourful on it's own.

I thought this sauce was excellent - I used the lime juice as well as the maple syrup and thought it was quite good -- the fresh ginger gave a nice zip.

Really really didn't like this sauce. In fact, I doubled the recipe for Easter dinner and didn't even put it on the table. I let a few people taste it and we all agreed that it was very bland (reminded me of baby food!) When I read the recipe, I did think that mango with maple syrup sounded a little off, but this was just a weird flavor. Like I said, I didn't even serve it, just put out the fruit and left it at that.
