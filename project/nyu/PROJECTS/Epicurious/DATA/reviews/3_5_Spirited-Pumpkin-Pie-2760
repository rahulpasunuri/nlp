I have been baking this pie since the original issue. If you are fortunate to have access to Stroh rum, an Austrian rum, please try it. Stroh's smells like a liquid butter rum lifesaver which adds a delicious flavor to the pumpkin.

I make this pie every year for T-giving and it is a huge hit. I like it spicy and not too sweet, so I cut the white sugar in half and serve with plenty of homemade whipped cream. Yum!

I started making this pie in 08 (see review - sorry for repeat comp problems)and it is still great!For those of you with complaints what in heavens name are you doing to mess up such a wonderful pie especially since there is so many ways to tweak this particular recipe to taste.

Horrible! This did not add any good flavor to the pie at all. I might have just as well dumped in a bottle off cough syrup. The alcohol and pumpkin flavors did not work with each other at all and I was left with the feeling that an otherwise good pie had been contaminated with the alcohol flavor.

Delicious!!! I may never make a pumpkin pie without rum again! It added a great flavor.

I made this last year and couldn't tell the difference between this pie and the spiced pumpkin pie also from this site. When I made it again this year, however, I had to use the Whole Foods brand of pumpkin because they were out of Libby's (the brand that Cook's Illustrated recommends, I think), and the pie was awful. I now agree with all the other reviewers who said that the spices and rum were overwhelming, whereas last year it was just a really nice pumpkin pie. So basically, I've come to the conclusion that the kind of pie filling that you use is VERY important. The crust was excellent, so I may try this again next year with a better brand of pumpkin.

This is one of my favorites. Usually use Cuban rum ( don't like any other kind of rum accept Havana Club) but Appletons Spiced rum (Hubby's)works well also.

Not the best pumpkin pie recipe I've tried. The spices were too many, and overpowering.

Rating: 4
I would recommend this pie, and I disagree with the other reviewers who said that the rum flavor was overpowering. This may be because I made it a day ahead of time, though. My only suggestion is to NOT under cook it. I left my pie in the oven for longer than the recipe said to, and it was still WAY underdone. I have an oven thermometer, so I don't think that the temp was the problem.

This is the best pumpkin pie I've ever made or tasted. I usually don't like pumpkin myself, but this one is light and flavorful. Every bite is usually eaten, wherever I bring it, and has been for the past two years.

I have made this pie two years in a row for Thanksgiving and it has been a great hit, even with kids. However, my personal taste would be to make it next time by cuttng the amount of mace, allspice, and cloves slightly. I thought those spices were slightly on the heavy side.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and made it the day ahead. I actually thought it tasted better 2 days later because the spices and the alcohol all seemed to come to a better harmony after sitting a couple of days. The first day I think the mace was a little too overpowering and you could taste the alcohol a little more. I'm not really a fan of rum because it seems to sweet to me so I substituted it for a nice bourbon, and really thought it came out wonderfully. Also, I only had a shallower depth 9" pie pan, not a deep 10", so I threw the leftover filling into a small casserole dish and baked that for 30 minutes, and that by itself was quite a treat, it would be a shame for it to go to waste. I will definitely make this again next year, but will be sure to buy a bigger pie pan and make this about 2-3 days before Thanksgiving so the pie can have time to sit.

My first attempt at pumpkin pie, and third attempt at pie crust, and both went well :-) I used bourbon for the liquor component, and that worked very well - even tastier the next day. I did have too much filling for the crust, but I suspect that's because my 10" glass pie pan isn't terribly deep. I just had to make another pie to use up the yummy filling - such a tragedy ;-)

All the spices make this a very complex tasting pie. Much more interesting tasting than others. Even people who don't like pumpkin pie liked this one!

Conforming to kosher dietary laws, I used a non-dairy whipping cream so that I could serve this pie with our turkey dinner. My family agrees it was the best pumpkin pie I ever made. Guests who normally don't like pumpkin pin thought this lighter version was terrific. Since I didn't have rum, I used 3 teaspoons of rum flavoring, and this worked very well.

My husband hates pumpkin pie and I had to twist his arm to even take one "small" bite. Well, needless to say, there wasn't much left by the second day. He absolutely loved it and said I could make it any time for him.

This was just OK - nothing special. I used less sugar and more rum than called for, and it still didn't seem very spirited...it was kind of bland. It's a good recipe if you want a quick and easy pumpkin pie that's a little bit out of the ordinary, but I wouldn't use this for entertaining.

I made this wonderfully 'spirited' pie for Thanksgiving for the first time and everyone absolutely loved it! Praise was given for the 'light and flaky' crust and the 'smooth and delicious' pumpkin flavors.

Made this for Thanksgiving this year, and it was wonderful! However, I only give it 3 forks because it was SO much better the day after Thanksgiving! When I make this again, I will be sure to make it a day in advance. I had to bake it for longer than the stated time, probably an additional 15 minutes. I also had great success using half & half instead of whipping cream, and 1% milk instead of whole. It was still very rich and creamy, and I would make these subs again. I also used the Easy Pie Crust from this site instead of the one printed with this recipe.

This is an excellent pumpkin pie recipe! The flavors are great and the rum really ties it all together. I added a little extra spice and used a premade crust. Even my guests who don't like pumpkin pie gave it rave reviews!

I have made this recipe since it first came out and it never fails to please. Even non-pumpkin fans like it. I have also passed it on to several friends. The key is the dark rum.

I made this 3 years ago and 50% of the family thought it was too spicy...this year, everybody raved.

I have never been a pumpkin pie fan until I tasted this one. It has none of the awful canned milk taste as it is made with cream. It must be the cream that makes it less dense and more "fluffy". I don't know if it was the rum or the cream, but the spices seemed lighter and more flavorful too. I am now a pumpkin pie fan. My husband liked this one so well - he now makes the pumpkin pie.

I am getting ready to plan my Thanksgiving dinner again. Each year I like to try new things but I would NEVER forget to make this pie. It is a Thanksgiving favorite. I highly reccomend for people who love pumpkin pie as well as those who think they don't. The kiddies don't love it, but we grown-ups need some special things too!

My family prefers a pie with a rich pumpkin flavor. The rum seemed to mellow out and almost overpower the pumpkin flavor in this pie. I'd recommend the Spiced Pumpkin Pie also on this website.

Great pie. Spice proportions are perfect and compliment each other very well. The dark rum manages to bring all the flavours together to make for a wonderful dessert experience. Using fresh pumpkin meat enhances it even more. Don't forget gobbs of whipped cream !

I love this recipe. I've been making it to rave reviews for four years and it is always a request for Christmas and Thanksgiving. This is a recipe I have given to dozens of friends who have enjoyed it. You can make the filling by itself as a mousse and it works fantastically well.

I think that this pumpkin pie was very good but also very similar to many that I have had before. It is a solid dessert but does not stand out as anything superb.

Yum, yum and more yum. This is truly a spirited variation on pumpkin pie. The spiced rum gives the pie a nice kick, and it keeps well, too. We're still eating it 5 days after it came out of the oven and it tastes great!

The crust tastes more buttery than we are used to so next time I'd use my own recipe. The custard is delicious but there is no doubt that rum has been added.

Rating: 4
Great filling... Due to my busy schedule I made the filling the day before and the morning of Thanksgiving I use a pre-frozen pie shell. I thought I brought everything to room temp..but the pie took a little longer to bake... I didn't have the mace...but felt the pie was delicious without it... The rum really adds to the flavor... This will be one of our favorites!

I loved this pie! I made it for some friends, none of us were pumpkin pie fans, but we all thought it was fabulous. The second time I made it I adjusted some of the spices a bit because I found some of them a little too strong. Great recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe. I've prepared it with and with out the rum, both are delicious. The crust is also excellent. If you have the time, it tastes much better than premade crust.

I first started making this pie three or four years ago - a shortcut I use is buying a prepared deep-dish crust - I received nothing but RAVES for this recipe. It is now a thanksgiving staple!

I may have used more rum than the recipe calls for. I have a tendency to do that. It caused the baking time to be greatly increased. I had to bake for at least 45 minutes more than the recipe says. Before adding the rum, the batter seemed a good consistency, so I may leave it out the next time.

I served this to a bunch of sceptical Brits for Canadian Thanksgiving ("A vegetable pie? For dessert?"), and won them over completely. Generally, I followed the recipe to the letter EXCEPT I freestyled the spices a bit to hit exactly the flavour I was looking for. It really didn't require much adjustment, though!

This is a really good pumpkin pie recipe...as stated earlier you can really taste the rum. I've been using Pillsbury pre-made crusts and the pie comes out fine (especially since I'm so busy the day before Thanksgiving).

This is easily the best pumpkin pie I've had. Don't be scared by the crust--it was definitely worth the effort despite the time involved. The filling was rich and creamy with just the right consistency. It was a huge hit, even with those who normally didn't like pie!

Absolutely delicious -- the crust is a lot of work, but it's worth it! The filling would make a good custard if baked by itself. You can really taste the rum.
