I was napping or something when I made these, and instead of grabbing the ground almonds from the pantry I grabbed amaranth flour instead. And I used regular unbleached flour because I didn't have matzoh meal. They were FANTASTIC. The nutty flavor of the amaranth perfectly complemented the almond flavoring (the good stuff from Penzey's) and the low-sugar apricot spread I used to fill them. Yum - a very serendipitous mistake.

Maybe I did something wrong, but these did not work for me. They spread flat but more than that, they didn't taste good, either. I love almond, I love marzipan, I love apricot jam. They just didn't gel.

I didn't have mazto cake meal and wanted to use the almond meal I picked up at Trader Joe's so I made the following substitutes: Replaced blanched almonds with 3/4 cup of almond meal. Replaced the mazto cake meal with 1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup wheat flour. Used apricot jam. The cookies baked for 18 min. The cookies turned out great and were very delicious. If you love marzipan, you'll love these cookies. I'd definitely make them again.

After reading previous reviews, I combined this recipe with a coconut jam thumbprint cookie recipe. After rolling the chilled dough (made per recipe) into balls, I then rolled them in eggwash and then rolled them in coconut. Substituted mango preserves for the jam then chilled and baked per recommendations in previous reviews. They turned out amazing! Like marzipan meets macaroons.

Well I haven't served these yet to company but did eat one and basically thought they weren't worth all the effort. Fairly tasty and not too "matzoh meal"-y but I found the dough hard to work with, crumbling all over the place. The jam oozed onto the cookie sheet, USE PARCHMENT. Also didn't even get 2 dozen out of the batch.

These were fabulous. I agree with previous posts that they need to bake longer...I baked mine for 18 min. I would also add another tsp. of almond extract. If you like marzipan you will love these!

I am not Jewish but love almond shortbread and was wondering what could be substituted for the matzo meal? Should I just use flour?

These were a big hit at seder last night! I agree with the other reviews: needs to bake longer than 12 minutes; I would say close to 15-16.

I made these today for a change of some of the Passover sweets we have been having. They were easy to make and quite good. I used strawberry jam, blueberry preserves and peach preserves. All were delicious. I used a small cookie scoop... about 1/2 tablespoon size. These do need more baking time than the recipe calls for... I baked them for 13 minutes and they could have used at least one more minute.

These were tasty. Make sure to grind the almonds quite fine, otherwise they're sort of grainy. I made these for Seder on Saturday and everyone thought they were quite good. I used "wild berry" jam that is a combination of blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries. I think they'd be really good with peach or apricot preserves, too. I made them very small by scooping out with my 2 teaspoon measure. Needed to bake longer than the recipe called for - more like 16 minutes.

Made and served these yesterday and they were a hit. All agreed they did not taste like a Passover recipe. I think the ground almonds keep them from being too dry. I used a small scoop to keep them consistent size and baked for about 15 mins. I made 1/2 w/ raspberry and 1/2 w/ apricot preserves.

What a delicious, easy and terrific Pesach treat. These taste like the Chinese almond cookies with chocolate drops I used to get as a kid in NYC many years ago. I used leftover lekvar from Purim, apricot jam and blackberry jam in these cookies and everybody loved them and agreed they did not taste Pesach at all. They made less than advertised so I was glad I doubled the recipe. These are a winner!

Excellent recipe - no one could believe they were for Passover! They really tasted like they were regular cookies, I'm tripling the recipe this year so that everyone will actually have enough!

These came out delicious. I followed the recipe exact and made with raspberry jelly. Delicious crispy passover cookie!

i really wanted to like this recipe, but the cookies melt and go totally flat when i put them in the oven. i've tried adjusting the temp and time, and making sure they're chilled before baking, but over 4 batches they keep melting into a giant cookie pizza. what am i doing wrong?

Just made this and they are great. I used whole raw almonds instead of the blanched ones. They have a nuttier, earthier taste with the whole nut. Baking time was much longer than suggested.

These are fantastic Passover cookies--substantial and chewy, but with a wonderfully light almond flavor. Try to use a jam without too much sugar in it, or--for a more traditional macaroon cookie--skip the jam altogether and press an almond into each one.

I thought these were great. They absolutely didn't taste like Passover cookies. Don't make them too far ahead, though; they were definitely better very fresh.

I made these a day ahead of the holiday and I wasn't disappointed. They are pretty good for Passover cookies. I doubled the recipe and used fig and apricot jams. I found the suggested cooking time to not be enough and baked them for about 5 minutes more.

These are really yummy. I definitely will make these again during the year. These cookies are good enough to enjoy when it is not pesech.

Did a trial run tonight in preparation for the holiday and will definitely make them for company. My husband says he would eat them any time of the year.
