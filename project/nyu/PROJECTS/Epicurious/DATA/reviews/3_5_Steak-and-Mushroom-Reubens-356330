we swapped out cheddar for gruyere... button mushrooms for shitake, and I didn't have pickling spice, so I seasoned the steaks with black pepper, paprika, coarse salt, a dash of allspice and then added fresh dill to the olive oil as the steaks fried. On assembly, we also added mayo and dijon to one slice of the rye, and then buttered and grilled them on a stovetop grill pan panini style. VERY yummy! We will make these again!

An excellent blending of flavors for a different treat. My husband, who is anti sauerkraut, gave this a thumbs up and asked for repets.
