This is a nice hearty winter soup. There was a slight bitterness to it that was not to my liking that I thought might be from the turnips. I'm not a fan of turnips. Next time I will substitute carrots or snow peas. I will also cook the noodles separately and add them as needed since there was practically no liquid remaining when we had it the next day.

I added 1/4 cup soy, juice of one lime, and 1 tablespoon brown sugar, and it was one of the best meals I've ever had. Next time I would cook it longer, however; the short ribs weren't tender enough. Also, it was MUCH better the second day. The only problem is it really only makes about 5 servings once you take the fat out of the broth.

Yes, this is very comforting Chinese home cooking. I think it's important to remember that China is a HUGE country, ranging from rough, harsh mountainous areas to almost tropical areas where the ppl have never seen snow. There is no definitive 'Chinese' cooking. In the north you grow wheat, so you eat more noodles. In warmer parts you grow rice. Logical, really. I teach ESL, and most of my students are Chinese males. Many of them live with us. It always fascinates me how regional their tastebuds are, and we seem to spend lots of time talking about food & culture. They range from ultrabland to extremely exotic & spicy. It's fun to use their Mum's recipes! And yes, 5 spice is used in many of their cuisines and is a blend of cloves, cinnamon, anise, fennel & asian pepper. Interestingly, most of my guys don't like cloves & cinnamon until they are soften and blended well with umami flavours like meat. If you like this recipe check out some recipes for 'Red Cooked" meat, too. It's a very popular dish in many regions, almost always is spiced with ginger, orange rind & star anise, and sometimes contains cinnamon & chilis. But again, it's home cooking: No two recipes are the same. Enjoy!

This is comforting and delicious. I used rice stick noodles instead of egg noodles (soak them in water first, then drain and add to the soup per instructions). I also added carrots and cabbage.

I don't want to rate this recipe, because I haven't tried to cook with it. But, I am a Taiwanese and both of my parents were from China, on top of that, I am a pretty good cook. So, I would like to clarify couple of things here. First, cinnamon is a very chinese spice. Chinese use something called 5-spice in stew pork and beef, sometimes duck also. This 5-spice can come in powder, or in the original form and or wrapped up in a small cloth pouch. When Chinese stew meat with soysauce this 5-spice is a must! and Cinnamon is definitely one of the five. Secondly, Tunip is not unsual with beef, but you won't find it in beef noodle soup. instead, we would add some sugar and reduce the beef soup to make it thicker, then put the turnip in and cook until turnip gets soft and serve with rice.

Why is this called "Chinese" soup? Sorry, but Chinese people NEVER use cinnamon in their cooking, especially not in soups!!!

Tasted good, but not great. I used star anise which gave the broth an odd taste. I refrigerated the meat and broth overnight and removed all the fat. But the end result looked like stringy meat in a thin broth over noodles.

This is definitely a gypsy-cold-cure kind of soup. The broth is so flavorful and healing. It smells great simmering on the stove. We skipped the turnips and added sliced fresh basil and a squeeze of lemon before serving. Very nice.

Substituted potatoes for turnips. The broth is tremendous. Definitely sticks to your ribs type soup. Can be a meal all by itself.

This is Chinese restaurant-quality. Don't worry about adding aniseed if you don't have any. I don't recommend adding turnips to this soup, because I don't know any restaurant that serves this soup with turnips. I also recommend that the noodles be cooked separately for a minute or two before you transfer them to the soup kettle. This way, the flour from the noodles wouldn't cloud and thicken this soup. Also, if there's any leftover, I would store the noodles separately so that they wouldn't soak up the soup overnight.
