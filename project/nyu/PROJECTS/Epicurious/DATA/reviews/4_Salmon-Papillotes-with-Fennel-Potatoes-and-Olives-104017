PS. To speed up the blanching process I recommend using two pots of boiling water (one large pot for the potatoes and a medium pot for the carrots/fennel). I blanched the carrots first and removed them from the water with a slotted so I could reuse the water to blanch the fennel. I think this is a better solution vs the microwave.

Absolutely delicious! If you have a food processor then a mandoline is not necessary. I blanched the potatoes for 3 minutes instead of 2 - just to make sure they wouldn't be under cooked. I used two fennel bulbs (I like to load up on low calorie/low starchy veggies) - and added a cup of thinly sliced red onion to the fennel/carrot veggie mixture. Since I was running late I doubled up, used a larger piece of parchment papers and put two fillets in one larger pouch instead of individual pouches. My kids LOVED this (they are 8, 6, and 4 years old)! This recipe is a definite keeper!

This was a huge success! In the store we saw beautiful golden beets and were inspired to use them instead of the carrots. We also used rockfish instead of salmon. Worked great. We used the parchment paper and wrapped them ahead of time and kept them in the fridge. I wished I had blanched the potatoes for longer than a minute.

Excellent! I was planning to make it as written, but at the store the salmon looked tired and the cod looked great. The recipe still worked well. Smells great, healthy, kid liked it too(although he didn't eat the fennel).

I microwaved the carrots and potatoes instead of boiling and cooling them. Lots easier. I also added spinach. Tonight I'm going to try it with trout and chard, leaving out the expensive fennel, b/c that is what is in my refrigerator. Adding a few things to increase the flavor, as suggested in other reviews, makes this a 4-fork recipe. It is easy, healthy, elegant.

Very light and healthy recipe. To make prep and cleanup a little easier, I adapted as follows: tossed raw, sliced fennel and carrots (added small sweet onion as well) with olive oil and placed on foil-lined baking sheet. Roasted for 15 minutes. Added fish and other ingredients per recipe to the foil, placing roasted veggies on top. Splash of white wine and lemon juice over it all. Sealed foil and baked according to directions. Perfectly done with no dishes to clean!

I had some trouble with this recipe. I followed it exactly and used foil instead of the parchment paper. Perhaps I crimped it too tight, as the fish wasn't cooked after 20 minutes and neither were the veggies. I used my mandoline and blanched...it needed more liquid. I did love the taste of the salmon with the thyme and the olives and I like the concept. I am going to play around with this. Next time, I will roast the potatoes separately.

Loved the flavor combinations! I make another recipe a lot like this, so I added a tablespoon of dry vermouth like the other recipe calls for (since I like it). Also, I shortened the prep and cooking time by putting the raw julienned veggies and salmon, wrapped tightly in their packet, in the microwave on high for 4 minutes. Veggies were tender and the fish was beautifully cooked. Perfect quick, healthy dinner for one!

I had carrots in my side dish (marinated baby vegetables on epicurious) so I omitted them. The results were absolutely perfect, and I had my reservations about olives and salmon together. Next time I will pre-cook the potato slices a little more, but otherwise, this was a gem. I made it for company, assembled it a few hours before, popped it in the oven when the salad went on the table, and it was so easy to portion (not to mention dramatic.) Yum.

Used green onions since they don't sell fennel down here. Substituted thyme with dill as some reviewers have suggested. Increased potatoes, decreased carrots and served it with steamed asparagus to make it a meal. It was delicious! My husband raved about it. I will definitely make it again.

What a suprisingly delicious dish! I would have never thought to put salmon with kalamata olives. The blend of the ingredients inside that pouch was heavenly. I will absolutely make this again!

This looked, smelled and tasted fantastic! I subbed capers for olives (we have olive-haters in the house), and I added a thin slice of lemon (cut crosswise) on top of the salmon before topping it with the fennel mix. I also used green lemon flavored olive oil from O $ Co. The flavors all came together beautifully!

absolutely fantastic and healthy. the element missing in the this dish, that another reviewer had commented on, was lemon zest and juice. i think, that is essential in melding all of the flavors together.

I enjoyed this dish very much, particularly since its perfect for someone seeking a low fat meal. I thought the flavor was a little anemic, and would have liked a bit more kick to the meal.

Good concept, but it falls short on flavor. I used the mandoline for all the vegetables and they looked great, and were cooked to perfection, but the dish just seemed to lack something. I didn't think anything with garlic, thyme, salt and pepper would lack flavor, but something was missing. The finished product looks and tastes so healthy. Maybe using sweet butter instead of olive oil and including shallots or onions would help. I do like the concpet of cooking in parchment and the presentation is impressive and I will try it again with a few changes.

I love this recipe. In fact, I have made many variotions on it many times. I prefer to use dill instead of thyme, as I think it is a more delicate flavor to couple with the fish. I also have added some sliced onions to the carrot/fennel mixture to give it some sweetness and added flavour. Instead of olives, I always use capers. Whatever you stuff inside the little pouches always turns out perfectly cooked, moist, tender, delicious, and impressive.

This is delightful, full of Mediterranean flavors and colors! It's an impressive dish to serve at a dinner party and you can do the preparation ahead of time, which makes it a breeze. Many people I have served this to don't care for the fennel...something you might want to consider when making it for people who's tastes you don't know!

wow, first rate. My potatoes were undercooked, but I had to cut them by hand, probably causing the problem. I preped everything early in the day, and served with roasted asparagus. Perfect, easy, delicious Christmas Eve dinner.

We've made this three times and each has been a reliable, and "aaahhhh" inspiring presentation with great flavors. A winner.

I believe this is the first time I have rated any recipe here a "4". My finace must have mentioned how great it was 6 times and I make a different salmon every week! this dish is wonderful!

Great recipe - so easy yet elegant for a dinner party. I originally tried this recipe exactly as written. My husband liked it, however I thought the olives overwhelmed the salmon, and wasn't crazy about thyme with salmon. I loved the concept, however, so I did another version substituting dill for thyme (increasing the amt by 3x), and currants soaked in brandy for the olives. We both loved it!

Delicious and a very pretty presentation. I followed the recipe exactly (doubled). Even though I don't have a mandoline, I just sliced the veggies and potatoes as thinly as I could by hand, and it turned out beautifully. This was great for a dinner party--it's all do ahead and there is very little clean-up. My guests were very impressed. Try this, you will not be disappointed!

I have made this recipe many times with snapper and chicken and it always turns out good. I make it ahead and just pop the packets into the oven during appetizers.

I've made this recipe a few times, and it is very, very good. The presentation is impressive for guests, and the marriage of flavours is near perfect. I thought the fennel would be overwhelming (not being a huge fennel fan) but it is just right. The only minor quibble I have is that there is something in the dish that seems to add a bit of a bitter aftertaste. Maybe the lemon zest (which can tend to be bitter with cooking) or perhaps the olives. Maybe leaving the lemon zest out during baking and then putting it on top might help -- I'm not sure.

I make this delicious recipe for special (and not so special occasions). When fennel is not available, I use parsnips instead, and dried herbs do fine too. It is one of my absolute favorite dishes, and healthy to boot!

This recipe is so easy! I've found that it's very versitile if you just keep the basis of potatoes and salmon (I've added onions and garlic instead of the fennel and olives and it was just as good). Clean-up is a breeze, it's very quick to put together, and the salmon comes out so moist and yummy! I generally make some version of this recipe at least once a week.

Impressive to make for guests and easy if you have a mandoline for the slicing. Much more flavorable that the recipe suggests -- the olives, oil, herbs, and fennel permeate the fish. I wouldn't change a thing.

The best part about this recipe is the clean-up -- there is none! that aside -- it got rave reviews. I'm not a fan of fennel, though, so I'd like to find a substitute. Any suggestions?

I found that this dish was great but could use a little more seasonning perhaps adding the foliage of the fennel with fresh thyme. I used parchment paper and think it is essential to give a spectacular presentation which in this case was perfectly outstanding since the paper turned a great golden color. I prepared it a few hours in advance and refrigerated and the recipe turned out very well.

A friend made this dish for me and it was superb. He used red snapper and fennel seeds instead of the bulb, and foil instead of parchment. It was outstanding and I'll make it next time I want to impress guests. The best thing about it was the entire dinner was inside the packet--so the kitchen was immaculate at serving time.

This dish was quite good, sophisticated looking, but not difficult to prepare, though it involved a fair amount of work slicing vegetables, etc before hand. The grocery store didn't have thyme so I used some fresh tarragon from my garden and added a little pastis over top of the whole package before it went in the oven to accent the black licorise flavour. I will make this again, next time for company.
