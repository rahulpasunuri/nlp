Review only for the ice cream recipe - This recipe is too rich for my tastes. I like a lighter ice cream, this one was much too rich and buttery ... very custardy I guess would be the right word. As the recipe calls for it to be served with pastries, this would probably make sense. But as is, blech... too rich, I couldn't even finish a spoonful. By the way, I followed the recipe to the letter ... Benedictine and all.

I didn't make the profiteroles but I did make the ice cream!!! OMG!!! This is soooooooo yummy! So very different from traditional ice cream...it takes me off to spa day! I did decrease the honey to 3 tbsp per recommendation and glad I didn't add that exact tbsp. I used Orange blossom honey from Savannah GA!

OMG this is sooo good. The lavender is just right if you follow the directions. I used a mild orange honey from Florida. My guests were amazed.

The ice cream is fab. I added a handful of hazelnuts, coarsely chopped, at the end of the freezing...yum. Next time I'm going to use 1 T less of the honey because I thought it was a little too sweet, though my bf disagreed. Make this!

The lavender honey ice cream was exquisite. I let the lavender steep for about 5 minutes to make it a bit more lavender-y, but you would have to be careful not to overdo it. I use White Tupelo honey from Florida, which works perfectly--floral and spicy.

Amazing! I wanted to do this after having Lavender ice cream in Sequim, WA (lavender capital of the world). This is BETTER than the ice cream I had there. Served just the ice cream.

HEAVEN! The recipe is perfection... and very easy to make. I got the lavendar at Whole Foods and went to work! I can't wait to serve this for guests- And definitely finish them with drizzled honey, chocolate and confectioners sugar- makes a beautiful presentation.

This was a special request item at my 12 year old daughter's birthday party and it was an absolute hit. I skipped the Benedictine and used 2 TBS lavender, keeping the rest of the recipe the same. Made ice cream in a hand crank ice cream maker--delish!

Ice cream only: Delicious. Lavender is my new taste obsession. Served with devil's food cake (BA, Jan Mar 2004, not online so far) which also has lavender and added lavender to the chocolate whipped cream icing from Chocolate-Chocolate Chip Cream Cake (BA Jan 2000). Magnificent combination, a definite repeat.

What an incredible and unique ice cream! When I first made this, I thought the honey overwhelmed the subtleness of the lavender so the second time, I cut the honey back by 1 T and its seems perfect now. I served it with pears poached in a calvados syrup.

I made only the lavender ice cream tonight due to time restraints. But, would make the profiteroles next time. Ther flvor of the ice cream is very interesting and complex. Very rich and creamy. I used fresh lavender out of the garden and "steeped" it with the hot cream mixture for some time. I just threw in a handful, and it turned out to be a little too much I think. Very powerful flavor, whereas subtle would be better. I will try again, but with about 2 tbls. fresh. I probably had 3 or more tbls. in there!

I only made the lavender ice cream portion of this recipe. It was delicious! Because of the unique flavor, my dinner guests are always impressed when I serve the ice cream. It pairs beautifully with almond tuile cookies as well as with a pear or an apple tart.

This might be the most exciting recipe I've found on epicurious. The ice cream is so complex, rich, and exciting. It was the showpiece of a recent dinner party. Amazing. And the profiteroles were fun and relatively easy. This dish has a very high "wow" factor, with little difficulty.

Made a number of substitutions to compensate for missing equipment/ingredients. Firstly, fresh lavendar from the garden gently toasted in the oven. Then cointreau as the alcohol (and double what the recipe called for.. can't help it!) I only strained twice as I wanted lavendar 'bits' in the finished article. Not having an icecream maker I froze in a dish and ended up with the most amazing flavour and texture sorbet/ice cream. Served in brandy baskets drizzled with honey and dusted with chocolate icing sugar. Most stunning sweet and incredibly yummy flavours. Guest who never eats desdert finished 1st and declared it the best dessert to pass his lips in 38 yrs - something had to be right! Make it your way and you'll have a winner on your hands too. Beware - You'll need to make it the day b4 if you don't have an icecream maker

Delicious. Here are my adaptations: I used fresh lavender (a couple of tablespoons) and let it steep for about 10 minutes off of the heat. Instead of making the profiteroles, I bought frozen puff pastry, baked them in triangles, halved them, and made a gourmet ice cream sandwich. Drizzled with local wildflower honey (same as in ice cream) and it is so fabulous. An addition I made that maybe not all would support is adding some red and blue food coloring to make the ice cream look more like lavender. I also through a tablespoon of fresh blossoms in the ice cream maker while it was churning.

The ice cream is wonderful: elegant, complex, and with a very nice lavender taste. My husband didn't like the choux pastries, but I did. I drizzled them with honey, since I think chocolate sauce would overpower the delicate flavor of the ice cream.
