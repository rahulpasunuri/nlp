I have been hunting for a great chocolate cookie recipe for quite a while. Once again I was disappointed. This recipe was easy to make but didn't have much of a chocolatey flavor.

The first batch I made I was a little unsure. The cookies are good but were lacking sweetness. They are almost like little biscotti. The second batch I made I drizelled some dark chocolate over them and they were a hit. The cinimon is an unexpected surprise that I like very much. I think these cookies would be a great accompaniment to a nice strong cup of coffee.

simple and sophisticated cookies. they're less sweet than most - but very rich and tender. the cinnamon is wonderful and adds a little something extra to keep things interesting. would be nice to round out a cookie basket.

This was a great recipe! It was just what I was looking for. Its a great chocolate cookie, moist, with just a hint of cinnamon. I would suggest omitting the salt however. It almost overpowered the chocolate.

These were a big hit. I used walnuts because I had no pecans, but any nut would work well here just as well. Yum!

This recipe, as all of Nick Malgieri's recipes are so easy to follow, make and are delicioso. I had bought Nick's "How to Bake" and I baked a Walnut Roll w/chocolate icing. She said "Where did you get this. You didn't make this! Oh! My husband said, "Isn't Mommy talented?" I knew it was Nick all the while. All I have to do is close my eyes, thumb through and stop on any page and bake, and everything I do turns out great as did these Chocolate Pecan Dollars.
