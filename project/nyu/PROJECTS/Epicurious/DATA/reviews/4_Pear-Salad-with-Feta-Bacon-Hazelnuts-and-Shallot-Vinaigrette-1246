Really Great Recipe! Made this for a dinner party. I won't rate because I changed a few things with the dressing. Didn't have sherry vinegar, so just used about 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar. Did not hurt the flavor at all. I let the dressing rest under a warm lamp for about 4 hours, which really melded the flavors together. Excellent! Also used a regular bag of mixed greens that I had in the fridge. REALLY GREAT! :-)

re: the review below. She makes an excellent point about the need to make the bacon crisp, to which I would add: don't add the bacon to the dressing. Reserve it and add it to the salad when you are ready to toss everything together.

I have one suggestion: Make sure the bacon is really crispy before you chop it up and add to vinegar/oil. If there are any soft pieces, it will soak up the oil, become chewy and the color blanches out. Kinda gross looking and the bacon texture gets fatty/chewy/nasty and not as awesome as I'm sure it could've been. Despite this, the salad disappeared. I will make again with this one correction.

This is a fabulous salad! I agree with the reviewers that you should definitely make the dressing a day ahead so the shallots have time to infuse their flavor into the vinegar and oil...also use blue cheese instead of feta. This was a hit!!

Fabulous salad! I used a nice roquefort instead of the feta and mixed baby romaine, but I think it would also be good with arugula---or with the watercress and endive. Would definitely use blue cheese instead of feta, though. My guests practically swooned over this.

I strongly recommend preparing the dressing 24hrs ahead of time, as the shallots really need time to sit in the dressing. It makes a huge difference. It goes from being rather oily to being a nice thick dressing. My husband and I love this recipe and I look forward to having it again. Guests are always very impressed when I serve this.

Great just the way it is. I've never used watercress or belgian endive before - alone they aren't so great but the combination here is super. Used white wine vinegar, blue cheese, bosc pears and pecans.

I wasn't able to get watercress and substituted lettuce but I have made this recipe a few times now, with resounding success. It is now one of our favourites!

Searched this site by fork ratings. This salad was a big hit at my first dinner party, so I made it for the next 2 occasions. A winner every time!

This dressing was very, very good. I made it exactly as written. Next time I would leave out the feta, maybe substitute a mild blue cheese. But everyone loved it. The carmelized shallots add just enough natural sweetness, I didn't feel like it needed any more sugar.

The dressing is great--you definitely need to add some sugar to it. I just used it with one of those bag o' salad mixes and it was very tasty. Serve with walnuts or pecans.

This is a great salad, very versatile. Like other reviewers, I used white wine vinegar instead of sherry. I also substituted slices of black forest ham for the bacon to cut down on the fat. I thought the dressing tasted funny at first because the flavors didn't mix together, but I left it in the refrigerator overnight and it tasted amazing the next day.

Wow. My absolute favorite salad. My steak-and-potatoes husband and I even eat this as an entree, it's that delicious and filling. I make this salad as written but substitute whatever greens are freshest at the time. The shallot dressing is wonderful. Don't skip it.

Impressive salad for dinner party. You can make this salad with any greens, I used baby greens. Like previous reviewer I used the blue cheese and some pecans (that's what I had on hand) Definitely add some sugar to the dressing (and add a bit of the bacon grease because everything tastes better with bacon grease) Everyone raved about this one so it's a keeper!

I did not rate this recipe, since I made several significant substitutions and changes. However, they worked out so well, I thought I would share them. I used white wine vinegar instead of sherry, bleu cheese instead of feta, mesclun instead of watercress, and toasted pecans instead of hazlenuts. Delicious!

What a fabulous salad. Easy and looks beautiful. I did not have hazelnuts so toasted some walnuts, and it was perfect. Made this for Easter dinner and everyone raved about it. THis is a keeper, I will make this again and again.

Very good recipe. I didn't think pears and feta would go well together, but I learned something new. The bacon is a must in my opinion, but I reduce by about 1/3. Used spinach, red leaf lettuce and watercress.

Made this salad for Easter - it was a hit. What a great marriage of flavors and textures! I used a Merlot vinegar and got a little worried when I tasted just the dressing - it seems bitter, but when it's mixed with the pears and everything else, it's just right. Cook the bacon in the microwave - I could see no purpose to fussing with it in a pan. Used the most incredibly creamy feta imported from Israel (available at Trader Joe's).

I never could find Sherry wine vinegar so I substituted with Champagne wine vinegar. I used half the oil called for. It was excellent. I made it at Thanksgiving and again at Christmas because everyone liked it so much.

I love this salad! The flavor and texture combinations are just terrific, and to my taste the perfectly ripe comice pears provided the right amount of sweetness without adding any sugar. I did substitute roquefort and sauteed chopped proscuitto, because that's what I had on hand. It was delicious, and will make an appearance as a salad course for my New Year's Eve dinner....cheers!

Served at a dinner party and received rave reviews from all. Added sugar-original recipe a little too tart. This is a keeper!

Fabulous salad. I do believe that adding a pinch of sugar may tone the sherry vinagrette as Cincinnati suggested. Will be making again tomorrow evening

Used this recipe for an upscale charity benefit dinner and it was a HUGE hit. It was the hands down winner among the participating chefs of all the submitted dishes. The only change I made was to add a little sugar to the dressing as I thought it a bit tart. Canned pears will work fine for this dish if time is a factor

I took this to a dinner party group and it was a hit, with everyone wanting the recipe. I would probably microwave the bacon next time to make the preparation a bit quicker.

After three months of searching for the perfect salad for our once in a lifetime Millinium dinner, this was my choice. It lived up to our every expectation. I found the secret was in perfectly ripe pears, and a mix of about two parts watercress to one part endive. Enjoy!

Delightful. Cooked shallots and warmed hazelnuts in luscious bacon grease; used dash of truffle oil in lieu of 1/2 cup olive oil, and rice vinegar instead of sherry.

The flavours blend together perfectly for a balanced, delicious and unique salad

What great mix of flavor this salad has, sweet, salty, and tart. I made a few adjustments to the ingredients by adding a tablespoon of sugar to the vinaigrette. I cut the Belgian endive and watercress by half and mixed in other greens so it didn't have such a bitter taste.
