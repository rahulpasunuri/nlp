Flavors are definitely off-balance. Added a lot more sugar, but just couldn't get it right. I don't see the point of the tomatoes, either.

I love the heat and tang of this sauce. I agree that it does not need as much vinegar or lime juice as the recipe calls--add those ingredients to taste. I highly recommend putting these ingredients through a blender to create a true sauce consistency.

This was all right, but I have made spring roll sauces that were much better. It was too vinegary-- I made it exactly as described and ended up having to sugar it more. Maybe I used the wrong kind of rice vinegar? Definitely use the seasoned, sweet kind.
