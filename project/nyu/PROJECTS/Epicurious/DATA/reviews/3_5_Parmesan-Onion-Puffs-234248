I had decent quality cheese and just thought this was blah......May try again with a really high-quality cheese and double the onion (at least) and add some garlic or garlic powder.

I made this with sourdough bread that was about to go stale. I halved the recipe and cut the bread into little hearts. My husband LOVED it and said, definitely make this again. Next time I will double the cayenne, and I sprinkled some parsley after it baked for some added color.

Quick, easy and yummy. I used the baguette and, of course, used more cayenne than called for.

My sister-in-law has been making these for family parties for a few years now. She uses mini-pumpernickel slices, though. They are so tasty!

These are yummy! I make them ahead (don't bake them first) and freeze them on a cookie sheet until frozen, then store them in a container in the freezer to have on hand for impromptu gatherings. You can pop them in the oven and they are fantastic! I sometimes add a tablespoon of pesto--give a nice green color and a little different twist. Only use the best parm, freshly grated--asiago is good too!

I made these for a baby shower and they were wonderful! I used green onion to add some color and doubled the cayenne pepper for a bit more spice. I baked them prior to atending the shower, so I was a little concerned that they would not be as good as when they are served fresh out of the oven, but they were still great! They are so quick and easy to make and I loved the fact that I didn't have to go out and buy a bunch of expensive, hard to find ingredients. I would definitely recommend buying the Parmigiano-Reggiano and grating it yourself. I gave the recipe to a friend and she used some pre-grated cheese, and said they were not nearly as good.

This was easy, quick and so yummy. I made twice what the recipe called for to have some left over and it was just as good the day after heated up. The only thing I would change is less mayo. I used light mayo and it was still too heavy, so next time I am going to use less. This is a good standby keeper.

Yumm-o! I used a shallot instead of an onion. Also, I used Kraft parm. cheese (the old stand-by in the green plastic jar) and got comments that the dish was really salty...wonder if a higher quality parm. cheese would eliminate that? Still delish, though!

This recipe was amazing! I made it with my sister and they were gone in a second! Definitely will make again

I haven't tried this yet, however here is a recipe I have been making for over 25 years that is similar...with a different take on it...you will love this. Ingredience: 1 small size loaf of cocktail bread (I use rye), 1/2 lb grated sharp cheddar cheese, 1/2 onion chopped, 1/2 c. mayonaise, 1 raw egg, pinch of dried parsley,thyme,red pepper or cayenne,paprika. Mix together and spread on bread rounds, then put under the broiler til cheese melts. I always made a double batch, because they go like hot cakes...people love them and the mix can be made ahead of time and is good for several days. Enjoy!

Very quick and easy to make, and everyone loved them. I used a french baguette instead of the recommended white bread, but it was fantastic.

I haven't made these yet but htey sound good. What is the best way to approach freezing them?

This is so good! And easy! I usually top mine with a sliced olive. A tad of minced onion is good as well. Love the freezing idea! I usually use cocktail bread--bagette is a good idea.

I've been making this for 35-40 years. Only on cocktail rye. The guys LOVE this stuff! And I never thought of freezing the breads! Great idea! Thank you!

Our family has used this recipe for years. Everyone loves it. We use sliced baguettes, and replace the onions with chopped scallions; they add the necessary color.

Delicious and easy! Many variations could be tried with yummy results. PS Disheveled One, at least learn how to spell your insults. It's "spaghettios."

Didn't make this but make a similar one that is very good....use party rye or regular rye cut into squares, spread with mixture and run under the broiler til bubbly. So easy and everyone loves them!

My mother made these for "grown-up" parties when we were little. We loved them and I still do. She had to hide them from the kids so she would have enough for the guests. They are not very colorful, so presentation needs to be.

This is an old family tradition - we call them "cheesy breads". I generally use thinly-sliced baguette as the bread. The combination is so fantastic. I love serving them because everyone goes ga-ga over them. When I tell them the base is Mayonnaise they are surprised and take another one. You can also put little bay shrimp into the mixture.
