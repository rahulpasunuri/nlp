Loaded up on garlic, and I'm glad I did. I'd also recommend two 28 oz cans of tomato product - I used Cento crushed tomatoes. Since those are more like thick sauce then crushed tom's, I coupled with can of petite diced to add texture.Good dish for weeknight supper. Make sure to salt appropriately.

I used uncooked turkey sweet Italian sausage and tossed that into the first step. I also had canned diced tomatoes rather than crushed--I used them drained. Otherwise, we made this as written and really liked it. It doesn't have a spicy kick but the flavors and texture all blended together into a nice smooth unity. Quite delicious!

Great starter recipe--substituted beef broth b/c had no red wine. Deglazed pan w/vermouth @ saute stage and sauteed turkey sausage in the pan to start. Delicious!

This is hearty and good! I served it over polenta rather than noodles or couscous, and it was great. I did add half a can of tomato paste, and it helped the whole dish come together.

Hearty and rich-tasting, and my kids didn't even notice the eggplant! I used mild, tender Japanese eggplants from the farmers' market, turkey kielbasa for sausage, and reduced the olive oil to 1 tablespoon.

Great, fast, hearty and cheap dish--serve with a nice salad and it's a great meal. I use 2 cans of tomatoes instead of 2 cups; 50% more sausage; more lemon; lots of pepper; more garlic; double or triple the amount of red wine; and a little bit of balsamic vinegar and brown sugar to round out the flavors (really, this doesn't make it too sweet--it just gives the sauce a little depth). I served it just like the recipe said (no baking here), but I did sprinkle with some tomato-basil feta cheese at the table, for a wonderfully creamy, tangy final touch. I used rainbow rotini instead of long noodles, and I think they were good in it.

I used fresh tomatoes, basil, parsley and a jalepeno for some zip. Needed to add some tomato sauce to thicken. Then baked in the oven with mozzarella cheese on top (thanks Avelet for the suggestion!). Worked out great. Good comfort food on a night of midwestern thunderstorms.

After having grown eggplant in my garden, I have more than I know what to do with. Being a batchelor, this was an easy dish to fix for me. My girlfriend loved it, but I thought *something* was lacking. The grated lemon added a neat twist to it I thought. I will try Avelvet's spin on this dish next time.

I really liked the mix of ingredients, but I can't help but change every recipe to my own thing. I used corn macaroni instead of noodles. I mixed all together as in recipe but then put it in a large iron skillet, topped with sliced canned artichoke hearts, Mozzarella & grated Parmesian. Bake for 20 min at 350F/ Lushious.
