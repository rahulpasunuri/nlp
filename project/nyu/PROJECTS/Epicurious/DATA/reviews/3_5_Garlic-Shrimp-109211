this dish was quite simple, i specifically used key west shrimp and made it with some pasta, quite unique and simple....... recommend it highly but be patient when peeling and deveining

This was the best shrimp recipe I've yet made at home. It is very simple to prepare and the taste is outstanding. Like a previous reviewer, I also used chipotles and the end result was wonderful. Served it with rice and green beans. I will definitely be making this one again!

Didn't have the chiles on hand so I used dried red chile and added a pinch of cayenne. The elimination of the "latin" chiles allowed me to serve the dish over penne pasta. I simmered the sauce for at least 30 minutes and then added to the pasta and simmered for another 10-15 minutes for the flavors to meld into the pasta. I received rave reviews. Leftovers were just as delicious the next day.

wow, excellent dish. i couldnt find guajillos, so i used chiplotes that had been in adobo sauce (significantly less than called for, as they are so powerful). i also added more shrimp, and served it over spanish rice and black beans. i made the mashed plantains from gourmet march 2004 as a side dish and they were also great. the crew said it was the "stand out" of the weekend's meals.
