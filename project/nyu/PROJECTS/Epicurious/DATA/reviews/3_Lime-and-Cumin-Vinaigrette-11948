I've been making this recipe for years and was surprised to see it had such a poor rating. I came across it after having a salad at a restaurant that I was trying to replicate. It worked perfectly. I use romaine, chopped tomatoes, corn, green apple (peeled and chopped), pine nuts, red onion, and if I'm feeling ambitious I toast up some strips of corn tortilla and toss it all with this dressing, it's wonderful.

This vinaigrette was kind of bland and was really missing something. I used it to marinade some prawns. I added some red pepper flakes and that helped some, but to me it was a disappointment. I have tried far better marinades and sauces both. I was expecting something new and different as I love lime and cumin, but this fell far short.
