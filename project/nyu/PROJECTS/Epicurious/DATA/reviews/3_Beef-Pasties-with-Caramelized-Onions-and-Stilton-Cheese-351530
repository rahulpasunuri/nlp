Made 6" instead of 9" rounds, and once cooked I cut them in half for easy finger food at a party. They received rave reviews. As I was not working out of my own kitchen, I used frozen puff pastry for the crust. Will probably make them with my usual pie crust next time. Not interested in bothering with whole wheat flour.

I mistakenly bought flank steak (won't go shopping without a written list again...), but decided to proceed anyway. I sliced the steak quite thin, but otherwise changed nothing. In a family of three, there were no leftovers!

I dont think there are any 'wannabe' cooks out there.You cook or you dont, and if , as they say, you can read, you can cook, and one only gets better with time. I'm stunned that you'd see a simple suggestion as to what someone thought she'd like and was open enough to share with others as an attempt to impress someone. Are you really that bitter, or are you just snarky all of the time? Lighten up, kid. Life's too short to not have fun with cooking.

I made a vegetarian version of this by carmelizing sliced mushrooms along w/the onions and wine. The dough was very dry and crumbly, difficult to roll out properly. The cheese basically disappeared when baking so you had an overall sense of flavor but not very cheesey. (I agree with someone else who said no need to add more salt - stilton was salty enough!) I guess the meat would have probably added more 'juice' to the filling but overall I found the entire thing to be way too dry - a bit shocking considering the overabundance of fat put into the dough! I also thought they turned out to be quite large, so I would consider making perhaps 5 or 6 of them instead of 4 (especially if I can make the dough more pliable.)

I made the recipe EXACTLY as written, including the white whole wheat flour (which I happened to have on hand). It was delicious! No changes necessary to make it a different recipe (there seem to be so many of those.) My only observation was that the pastry did need more water to help bind (likely due to winter low humidity) and definitely needs to be rolled out between parchment as instructed. Will make again.

Okay, so I didn't use this recipe EXACTLY, but the basic idea was there and mine was a LOT easier. I used pre-made pie crusts from Trader Joe's and they were fantastic! For the filling, I used a 1lb. ground sirloin (80/20 for a little fat) instead of skirt steak. Obviously MUCH easier to use. First I sauted 2 small onions with an equal amount of diced carrots until they were nice and caramelly. (Side note - the Vidalia Onion Chopper is a wonder with getting veggies like that cut in a jiffy). I then added the wine in and let it reduce and then removed the veggies. I then added in the ground beef (crumbled up) and let it just sit on one side for a good 5-10 minutes to give it that nice rich dark brown color and great taste. Then I grated in 2 cloves of garlic, cooked it until it was done and added the veggies back in - oh yes, I salted and peppered both the veggies and beef towards the end of their cooking. Then 1 tbl. of flour to the entire mixture - cook about a minute. Then add 1/2 cup beef broth and 2 tbl. Worcestershire sauce (or only one if you're not crazy about Wors. sauce). I also added the thyme, but all I had was ground. Then you just cut the pie round in half and spoon the mixture on 1/2 that crust, sprinkle blue cheese if you want it and fold the crust over your mixture so you get a sort of round triangle. Use the edge of a fork to press the two open sides together. Cut a slit in the top and brush with an egg wash. In the oven at 400 for about 10-20 minutes until the crust is golden brown. My family LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this recipe I will keep it as a staple in our house. BTW my recipe made 6 pasties. They are very rich and hearty so one should be plenty per person. Serve with something light, like fresh green beans or a salad. NO potatoes as it would be a very heavy meal.

The filling is excellent! I confess I used my English mother-in-law's shortcrust pastry recipe (butter + lard) rather than the one listed here (as this one looked to be too flaky for my husband's taste), but the result was scrumptious.

I would try this recipe again, but would add all of the blue cheese next time. (I only added about half because I thought that it would be too much and over-power the rest of the filling.) Needless to say, it turns out that the entire portion of blue cheese truly compliments the delightful caramelized onion in white wine (I used a bargain Pinot Grigio) and Thyme. Wow, what flavor! Also, the edge of the crust was too heavy for me so I'll leave less crust on the edge and also be sure to brush the egg white only as a glue along the seem. (It changed the consistency with a less than soft shell as I remember my mother making these when I was little and she used white flour and simply pinched the seem on the outer edge only to leave a slight crust.) I bought outstanding rib eye from the butcher (DD Meats, ML Terrace...for all you Seattle natives) which I still cut into 1/4" pieces...it cooked perfectly in 30 min. I served this meal with steamed broccoli. (I have a no-fail steaming technique of placing it on a plate for 3 minutes with a ceramic, microwave-safe bowl covering it and about a 1/4 cup of water on the plate. I nuked it just before the pasties were due.) Good times. Enjoy, all! Krista

My husband and I do not like blue cheeses so we used a nice strong cheddar. I used sweet onions to ease the carmelization process. These were good but not great. I had never had pasties before and I think if I try these again I would make them more like a pot pie.... The overall taste was good, but we didn't eat the leftovers which always the tell tale sign in my house.

I made these for an English friend for lunch but I made some changes for authenticity. To begin with I felt like the crust asked for way too much moisture so I avoided that but then realized afterward that you need the crust to be a bit tougher than what a pie requires because you should be able to pick up the pasty and eat it with your hands. My crust ended up way too flaky to do this. I used only spelt flour for dietery reasons and just reduced the moisture. Next time I'll add more water to give the dough more cohesion. In regards to the filling, I made the onion mixture exactly but I added an extra tablespoon of pepper. I used ground lamb instead of skirt steak because I had some around. No you don't cook the meat prior to stuffing it so if you are using the skirt steak, make sure you slice it somewhat thinly. The ground lamb turned out perfectly. I substituted bleu cheese for the stilton and I ended up only putting it in mine as the flavor was too strong for the lamb. I also blanched one large sweet potato (for dietary reasons but you can use a regular potato), roughly peeled it and then chopped it into cubes. Overall, it turned out wonderful and my friend really enjoyed it and said it was very authentic tasting except it needed more pepper as the real version is quite peppery.

I added sauteed portobello mushrooms to the filling. The flavor was great, but I had to roll out the pastry dough more. I think that helped to keep the crust and filling in balance taste-wise. The whole wheat flour adds a depth/ earthiness to the crust that compliments the steak, cheese and mushroom. This is not the pasty I grew up with, but a wonderful updated version.

This recipe was really good. I like the suggestion of using puff pastry as it is less time consuming, and will try that next time. I did add potatoes at the suggestion of other reviewers and am glad that I did. I wish that "wanna be" cooks like Sunnyregal from southwestern VA would refrain from rating recipes that they have not tried and that they would cease using this forum as a means of impressing others with what is in actuality a most unimpressive recipe. Sunny, let me state it as clearly as I can. I am not impressed!

Plan to have a large green salad with very little dressing as these are very rich and filling. Suggest not to salt the onion filling as the cheese adds more than enough salt. I had to use all butter as when I pulled the rarely use non-hydrogenated veg shortening out of the freezer it was so oxidized it wasn't usable. So my pastry wasn't as flaky as it would have been but extremely tasty. Half of a pasty is more than enough for a serving and they were very good reheated. Skirt steak is a bit hard to find but worth the trip to Whole Foods. Thanks Jeanne Thiel Kelley for a great group of recipes!!

This was horrible! The dough was what did it for me. Biting into these was like eating steak with sand. I had two bites, and then just dug the filling out and ate that plain. If I ever make this again, I'll just buy store-bought pie crusts.

These have no resemblance to any Cornish Pasty I ever had in England, but I decided to make them anyway because they sounded interesting. The filling was good but I didn't like the dough at all. The whole wheat flour gave it an unappetizing color and, while it was flaky, it was somehow just too much - too much pastry for the filling. I would have liked the filling more stuffed into a pita.

I thought this recipe was great. I did use gorgonzola cheese instead of stilton, and I thought it was just right. I liked the crust, but I might try it with puff pastry next time to save on labor (no I haven't tried it yet but it is just a thought! Don't hurt me!) I thought the steak/onion/blue cheese flavors were wonderful together and I am definitely making it again if I need to impress anyone.

Please please do not rate a recipe that you have not done it is conterproductive Please do it as suggested then alter and redo to your taste This is good and I did as asked all items I do agree that potatoes would help if you feel stilton is too strong why not try a camabazola you get the buttery flavour of the cream and still get the blue cheeses

I'm with Texas. Cook it first, even if you substitute the dough, then rate it. I've only heard one review of the dough itself, any other recommendations?

A good pastie recipe usually always has potatoes in it, certainly not fruit, raisins, etc. It's not a fruit tart you are making. I'm with those who say rate the recipe after you make it. Rating it before hand is like critiquing a movie without having seen it, then making your own movie to replace the one that's being shown. I don't mind one or two ingredients being substituted, but more than that and it's really not the same recipe is it?

sunny from sw VA: I'm sure you're an expert, but would you (and all the other self- appointed experts) be kind enough not to rate a recipe you have never tried. Perhaps you could apply for a job at Bon Appetit and write your own recipes. BTW, I always welcome suggestions from people who have in fact tried a recipe, or those who make a suggestion without a rating.

shortening may not be a healthy every day choice, but it is the best way to make pastry. i really enjoy other cooks thoughts, changes and suggestions, but appreciate them AFTER they've tried the original recipe.

Sunnyregal from SW VA - At Whole Foods Markets they have a vegan, all vegetable shorting which is great for all baking - no chemicals either, and they have sulfite-free wines. Pasties are a savory meat dish with no place for either walnuts or apple or any fruit juices. You must be thinking of a totally different type of dish to suggest these alternatives. I agree the Stilton sounds a bit too much, but simply reducing the quantity solves that without going to another cheese entirely.

A strange recipe, nothing like the pasties made in Cornwall or in the UP of Michigan by mother & grandmother who were born & raised in Penzance, Cornwall. Zero forks for this one.

Rating: 2
the meat in this recipe does not need to be cooked first, because it is sliced very thin it cooks in the 30 mins. that it bakes....overall i thought they were only ok...would make my own dough for the crust which is more flaky and leftover pot roast would be a better filling...used maytag instead of stilton..love the idea and would make the next time my way.

In my opinion, lacking potatoes...but otherwise very good Loved the saltiness of the stilton, but a gorgonzola would be good too for the creamy factor. I really can't stand it when people review recipes without even trying them...Don't give it 1 fork without trying the recipe and then add a totally new one for good measure. How very presumptuous of you...

The recipe in the magazine states that "You top the onion's with beef strip's" So it goes in raw. I know that skirt steak is quite thin & cook's quickly....soooo I hope this help's.

All of the pastys I have had or made have potatoes in them. These might be nice but they are not the way that I was taught in the UP of Michigan where the copper miners took them in their lunches.

I didn't try this recipe, but I'd change several things at a glance. 1)The shortening. I do not allow shortening in my kitchen. Sub a 3/2 1/3 ratio of butter & olive oil, or some other alternative. 2) Sub vinegar mixed with grape or apple juice for the wine (allergic to sulfites) 3)Onions, skirt steak, wine, Stilton (i'd sub the milder Bel Gioso Blue)...is something missing? Add a handful !/4-1/3 cup) walnuts, or a chopped apple, and a rounded half-teaspoon of tarragon, a light grinding pepperiest black pepper, and you've got a winner.

I haven't had time to make these pasties as yet, but have made the traditional Cornish pasties, which do not pre-cook any ingredients, including small diced potatoes, beef & raw onion. Since the beef here is sliced thin, I'm assuming it need not be pre-cooked in this recipe. The traditionals are very popular in the CA gold country where the miners from Cornwall came to mine gold.

Any chance someone who has a copy of the magazine could post the missing section of the recipe? I though it sounded a little weird that the beef strips wouldn't be cooked before they went into the pasties ...

So would someone be a dear and write the missing part of the recipe on this site. I'm assuming it has something to do with cooking the meat. Thanks!

Very tasty! My husband is English and he enjoyed these very much. I rushed the sealing of the pastry and they oozed a bit but the crust was still very crisp and delicious. A word of caution though - you are putting a LOT of Stilton in these and they can get a bit overwhelming. Serve them with a salad or something fresh to cut the saltiness. Otherwise very good! (FYI - I made these from the magazine - the recipe online is not complete - half of the filling section is missing at the time I wrote this).

The instruction for the filling is missing a large section right after "Sauté until deep brown, reducing heat if necessary to avoid burning."
