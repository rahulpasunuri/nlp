Probably won't make again. Too much effort for not enough pay off. Not that it was hard, but it took more time than I expected and dirtied more dishes for something that was just so-so. I liked the paste better than the oil - more flavor. Served the leftover solids on Naan bread - yum!!!! Also, thought that it was not the best contrast for the gazpacho it went with - and I LOVE tomatos and cilantro together usually.

A big thank you to the cook from Alamos, the Cilantro butter idea was better than the oil. Very good on french bread.

Congratulations to the author of nocilantro.com. Your web skills and content have improved greatly. This was not the original webpage. Notice that early responses (from several different recipes) to the original webpage were all very negative. Again, congratulations. I'm glad that you are at a happier place.

something fun to do with the leftover pulp - let a stick of butter soften, whisk it with the green stuff, form it back into a cylinder and wrap with wax paper. Gets you some green butter that's very nice with pasta or bread.

I thought the nocilantro.com was pretty amusing. Maybe some people need to chill and get a sense of humour. ;)
