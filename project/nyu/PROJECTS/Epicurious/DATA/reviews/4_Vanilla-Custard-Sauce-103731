As a South African, we grew up having custard at every family get together. Living in the States, made me miss that because it's not tradition here. Finding this recipe was like finding a little piece of home. Love it!

Flavor was great, but it did not set properly, even chilled overnight. Recipe needs more instructions for newbies like me, or something...

This makes a great filling for crepes.

Quick and easy---great dessert--we eat it warm or cold with fruit (raspberries ideally ) mixed in. Delicious!

I made this for a truffle type of dessert and my guests loved it.
