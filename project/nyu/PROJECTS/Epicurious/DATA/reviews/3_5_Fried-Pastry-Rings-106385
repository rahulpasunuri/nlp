I lived in Spain for many years, and I still have dreams with platefuls of these bunuelos and cups of hot chocolate. They are very easy to make, but just don't let the oil get too hot because they'll get too brown on the outside while remaining gooey on the inside. These are much better than any donuts you can get in the States. I wouldn't change a thing.
