I made the mistake of buying and using aweful Pecorino Sardo instead of Pecorino Romano. The substitution ruined the dish, but the proportions and technique of making the pasta were spot on. Avoid Pecorino Sardo at all costs.

A similar recipe was featured in Gourmet a few years ago, with one significant difference: Whole pepper corns are heated in a pan on the stove until they jumped (2-3 min) (2 teasp. for 1/2 lbs pasta), and then they are crushed with a mortal/pest. or with a rolling pin. This gives the pepper a unique and wonderful flavor. It's a must for this recipe.

Wonderful dish, quick and easy. Though it could use some more flavor. Maybe I didn't use enough cheese? Also, eat it quickly or you'll start to get little clumps of the romano as the heat dissipates. The pecorino romano garlic bread from this site is a perfect side dish, as you can just use the leftover romano from the pasta. Helps make the cheese flavor a little more prominent as well.

I have made this pasta many times to RAVE reviews. Use high quality cheese. People always think that I use a 'secret' ingredient - I love to surprise them by giving the recipe!
