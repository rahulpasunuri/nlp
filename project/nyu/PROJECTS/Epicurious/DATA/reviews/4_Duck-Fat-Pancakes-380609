I fried them in ghee. As another commenter mentioned, this is a classic Canadian-style pancake. Just the thing for a -40c morning.

This brought back childhood memories of my Canadian grandmother. We would all descend on her house when she announced she was making "Canadian Flapjacks". We would slather them in even more butter and then the maple syrup...Yum. She died at age 94, and I have been looking for the recipe ever since.

I imagine this will be very good...to all the "health" watch dogs out there it's all about moderation. The French have been using duck fat for centuries and there is no evidence of obesity here. Mc Donalds is popular very understated but a treat on occasions. No supersizing here.

I have not made this (yet). I'm thunderstruck at the negative comments though. This is Epicurious. Live a little for gosh sake! A little duck fat will not kill you! Just don't eat it every day (then, like everything else, it just might!) There is a food truck here in DC that sells French Fries fried in Duck Fat....SUBLIME!

Try this as an appetizer with some sauteed wild mushrooms with a little thyme on top! It will rock your world!

Maybe the name is a turn off ?The results are amazing! I may even try it with rendered chicken fat.

This is obviously not a dish one would prepare on a regular basis. Everything in moderation, you know? BTW, for the self-appointed food police who seem to believe that somehow duck fat will instantly seal off their arteries and kill their families: in composition, duck fat more closely resembles olive oil than other animal fats, like, say, butter (it's high in linoleic acid and omega-3 & 6). Educate yourselves, enjoy and provide a balanced diet for you and your families (like we do), and you may just raise children who don't have eating disorders. :) The bottom line, though - if this dish sounds like something you would like, then try it. If it offends you, don't, but please save the self-righteous indignation.

I agree with StevyD...go to Cooking Light if you are so offended. If you choose not to make this recipe, then don't. Quit lecturing.

McDonald's and Burger King does Duck Fat Pancakes? Moscotty, tell me where? Mine doesn't. but I never go to McD and rarely ever to BK or any hamburger joint anyway. Some people seem so afraid of food they must pack a pistol to market with so many evil groceries hanging about.

yum? well, i don't know, but i really don't want to. it probably tastes good but is it healthy? i doubt. would you really want to introduce this to your family as something healthy??? look around you at all the overweight people--they're eating FAT and CALORIES. duck fat? boy, that sounds like something i want my family to eat (or any animal fat!) so what if it's not healthy . . . it tastes soooo good, or YUM! as some have put it. please re-think your choice for your family. america is raising more and more overweight children and the "cook" is responsible for this. do your part to bring healthy, good-tasting food to the family table--don't blame it on McDonalds or Burger King. kids eat what their parent's allow them to eat. this recipe should not be in your files!

Duck fat is like liquid gold. Anyone who thinks this recipe is disgusting obviously knows nothing about good food. Haven't tried this yet, but it's on my list. :) Duck fat improves just about anything cooked in it - including popcorn. Yum!

Duck fat has been around forever! I am not fond of duck meat but duck fat home fries, to die for! This recipe sounds amazing :)

Wanna be "foodies" lacking grace and style are prone to such descriptive terms as disgusting, yucky, gross and icky. At least on Epicurious, there is hope they may learn something. Not often having duck or goose fat, I more commonly use bacon fat as a rare treat when I fry or saute; EVOO being my default fat.

I use duck fat in many recipes, including making my own tortillas. It has a buttery taste and is great both as an ingredient and as a frying medium. My only gripe is with the cornstarch as this is not Chinese take-out. Substitute tapioca powdered in a spice grinder. As for the cretin who turned his nose up at duck fat, perhaps he should check out what the best pastry chefs use in France. Bear lard at $50.00 a pound.

My mother-in-law has been making pancakes using a recipe very similar to this one for well over 30 years. Among other food items we cooked four ducks for 2011 Thanksgiving Dinner the next day we had the entire family come to the house again for breakfast/brunch (as we do every year.) The kids, and grand kids cant wait for Thanksgiving because they know the following morning its gonna be brunch at grandmas. The best pancakes imaginable.

Cannot wait to try these.. Foie gras or savory with seared scallops for a little surf n turf!

I haven't tried this yet, but feel I have to make a comment on the last review: duck fat is far from "disgusting" and, in fact, has many health benefits... just ask the French! Its chemical makeup has been described as closer to olive oil than animal fat. And anyway, this recipe is really a variation on donuts (and a lot healthier). Are they "disgusting", too?

This is the most disgusting recipe I have come across! It seems to me chefs are looking for something sensational but not tasty or healthy! Why all the drama!
