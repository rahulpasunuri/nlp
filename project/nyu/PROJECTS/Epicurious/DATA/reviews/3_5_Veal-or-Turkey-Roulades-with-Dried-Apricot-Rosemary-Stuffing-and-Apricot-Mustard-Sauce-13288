Delicious!!! I had doubted that once cooked the roulades would be able to be cut, but I followed the recipe, let the turkey wrapped goodness rest and it worked perfectly. My fiance LOVED this meal; he said it was one of his new favorites. I served it with a salad I read about in "Food & Wine." The dressing for the salad consisted of browned butter, sherry vinegar, a bit of water and almonds pureed together. I marinated a bunch of baby carrots in olive oil mixed with fennel seed, paprika, coriander, sliced garlic, salt & pepper (I think that was it.) grilled the carrots and tossed some arugala with the dressing and grilled carrots. The meal was terrific!!!

While the end result was perfectly tasty (using chicken), I think the flavor is a bit mild for the amount of effort. Although I had never tried to make a roulade before and this wasn't a bad learning curve as far as recipes go. I would definitely always make the apricot mustard sauce, though, because the flavor without it would be way too mild to comment on. You can probably find a tastier recipe for the same amount (or less) effort though.

Very, very good, but awfully time consuming to make. I made it for a dinner with guests, so I didn't mind taking the time, but I certainly wouldn't make it again on a regular basis. In fact, this is probably one of those things I'll remember fondly and never have again.

i like the technique but i thought the stuffing and sauce were not so good, and i followed the recipe exactly. i've thrown together better stuffing with random ingredients i had on hand. might try this again with my own stuffing recipe.

I used a whole deboned turkey and the stuffing was really good. The sauce did not taste mustardy at all!!

Awesome! Made this with turkey for an intimate Thanksgiving - very festive, special, delicious. I used smaller individual turkey cutlets and had a hard time pounding them out to be large enough without creating holes - but it all worked out in the end with a little creative toothpicking.

I prepared this recipe for my gourmet group and it was a unanimous hit, especially the sauce. I didn't use the arrowroot, because the sauce was thick enough with the cornmeal. I can't wait to make this again. Great party food.

Very nice weeknight meal. Bought veal scallopini cutlets (already pounded out) and cut the bread cubes and vegetables into 1/4 inch pieces. Next time I will not use the cornmeal, just flour. Toothpicks worked just fine.

This dish was fun to prepare and full of wondrful flavors. We used wooden skewers to close the veal rolls and these worked easier than toothpicks. Next time I think I might try closing the edges of the rolls with string and a darning needle - a technique I just read in either Bon Appetit or Gourmet in 12/02

I quadrupled the stuffing portion of the recipe and served it with roast turkey (I heated it in a casserole, I didn't stuff the turkey with it). It was wonderful--the rosemary, which I thought might be too strong, was quite mellow, and it had a lovely sweet/savory flavor and good texture (I think toasting the bread cubes is responsible for that). My husband assures me that the leftovers won't be around for long. The only thing I would do differently next time is to more finely chop the apricots so they blend with the other ingredients more. Highly recommended!

I used boneless chicken breasts, stuffed and just folded in half, secured with toothpicks, dusted with flour to brown instead of cornmeal. Also tried adding chopped pecans, that is also delicious.

Delicious! I used (gasp!) Peppridge Farm cubes because I didn't have anything but homebaked sourdough bread around. I agree with the comment to let the roulades sit a little before slicing. The flavors melded beautifully, and the presentation was so nice. I served them with vichy carrots and wild mushroom and leek galettes to start with (sound familiar?) and a Tarte aux Pommes for dessert. This was the easiest part of the menu!!

I tried this dish last night with pounded chicken breasts. Absolutely delicious. One thing I would recommend though, is that you let the roulades sit a bit....at least 5 min...after baking, so that slicing is easier. I made this with dressing mix...that is to say, dried bread pieces that were part of a boxed dressing mix. It was fabulous. I will DEFINITELY make this again.

I have made dish four times for large potluck Thanksgiving dinners, including picky family members. The roulades always seem to be eaten first before the roast turkey. I think it's because the roulades have more visual appeal and because they taste really great. I've also caught our guests eating the stuffing before the roulades were assembled and rolled. The stuffing smells phenomenal.

I made this recipe with turkey cutlets and I found myself feeling frustrated with the "tearing" while pounding the meat. I also found the cutlets to be a little too small to accomodate the stuffing. I would love to try this recipe again with well pounded chicken breasts. The flavors are mouth watering, the dish is pretty; next time I'm going to use chicken!

I've made this several times and it's always a crowd pleaser.
