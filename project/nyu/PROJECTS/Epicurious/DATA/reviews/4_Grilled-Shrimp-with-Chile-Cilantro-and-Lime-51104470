I should have walked away as soon as I read "30 cilantro sprigs." Reallly? It's one thing if you are garnishing individual servings with a couple of sprigs, but when it's going into the hopper anyway, can't we just say "2 tablespoons"? Not sure what I did wrong with the sauce, but 10 Anaheim chiles just about killed us and we like spice. And it made way too much sauce. Again, maybe I had the wrong type, but unfortunately I ruined some good shrimp with this recipe.

This recipe was a pleasant surprise. We used peeled/deveined shrimp just to save on mess/fuss. In the end, the shrimp aren't the highlight anyway. As others have said, it's the sauce! The stuff is killer! We reduced the volume of chiles, but used some more potent varieties. Turned out great. On a side note, we had black beans and rice as a side, which we at first thought might not complement the shrimp. It did, though, and the extra sauce on the beans and rice was fantastic! Will definitely be doing this one again.

Delicious recipe! The shrimp come out pulpy on the inside and beautifully scalded on the outside. The only thing I did differently is I used skewers: two parallel skewers through each shrimp so I could turn them more easily on the grill.

I thought this sauce was excellent and I will definitely make this again. I did take a reviewer's suggestion and reduced the fish sauce by half. It was still too salty so I will go down to 1 tablespoon in the sauce. I also don't use sugar so I added 1 tablespoon of raw honey. I prepared the shrimp as written and found the shells messy, especially with the finger staining turmeric. I will buy smaller, peeled shrimp and put them on skewers next time.

Found the fish sauce way too overpowering! Definitely cut by at least one half. Also, add lime or lemon to the shrimp marinade to enhance flavor. Not a keeper. Wish I had made a madras curry marinade with a raita dipping sauce instead.

Very easy recipe to make and just the right amount of spice. I added extra cilantro and ginger for an additional kick.

This was a great recipe and the flavors were even better the next day for lunch - I would take that brown bag any day to work.

made this with friends but instead of shrimp we used it with native super fresh stripped bass. cut back on the cilantro by half and used ancho chilis instead. this is a really great recipe if you cut back on these two ingredients that seemed to me would compete with the flavor of the seafood

In New Mexico, chile is revered. Chile is spelled with an "e" not an "i" at the end.

Correction of prior review... in my opinion, the garlic and the lime peel are much more effective on the shrimp than in the sauce....

Jpjones... agree with you totally... not an usual Epicurious recipe... we know better than that.. 30 sprigs?? Gourmet cooks know better.... but I have been making a very similar (my own creation) recipe for many year. I do suggest some garlic and some lemon or lime peel on the shrimp before grilling.. does make a difference... But an overall excellent recipe.. Do enjoy

RobinMcM, this is from freedictionary: Chile - very hot and finely tapering pepper of special pungency

Sounds great, but to the best of my knowledge, Chile is a country, while chili is a variety of pepper.

A fantastic recipe! The turmeric really makes it special, and the dipping sauce is delicious. The key, though, is grilling shrimp with the heads still on (the bigger the shrimp, the better). Keeping the heads on (and shells) helps keep the shrimp very moist. I even grilled them in a grill pan, further removing them by one degree from the direct heat, which can make them dry. They still had a wonderful grilled hue. Again, amazing taste. My one complaint is the recipe, which I found somewhat frustrating for an Epicurious recipe. What's up with the 30 cilantro sprigs? Why not just say 1 cup? And the ginger--how big beyond length? In short, be prepared to use your cooking skills to improvise a little, including using a variety of chiles, depending on how hot you like it. But overall, the tastes blend very well together. We accompanied this with a spicy asian cabbage slaw, and it all worked very well. The dipping sauce could also be used with a variety of fish filets, and you could also substitute scallops for the shrimp here. Oh, and one final thing--suck the heads of the shrimp (trust me on this one). If you've ever eaten a soft-shell crab, it's the same thing but better. Suck the head. No different, and if you don't, you are missing a massive blast of scrumptious taste (especially with the turmeric).
