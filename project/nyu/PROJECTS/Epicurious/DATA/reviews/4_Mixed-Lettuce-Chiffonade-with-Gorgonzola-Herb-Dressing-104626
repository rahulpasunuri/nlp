A beautiful array of colors & textures. Like Confetti on white dishes. This salad really gets the taste buds dancing. The dressing was so simple to make, maybe five minutes? Very easy to eat too because everything is so thinly slilced. It would make a great main course at lunch, but it was a side dish that accompanied my Steak Au Poivre.

I found this recipe to be exceptional and the chiffonade style of the lettuces made for a great presentation. I loved the savory qualities of this dressing and will make it again and again!

Made this for a bridal luncheon, it was the simplest item on the menu, but probably got the most raves. Make sure to soak the lettuces first to ensure they are super-crisp.

This dressing is so good. I put it on gnocchi (pasta potato). I know I should of had the salad. I didn't have parsley so I used basil instead. I will make again and have the salad.

This is basically a lettuce salad with a bleu cheese type dressing. It's good but not phenomenal. There are so many better salads that this one pales in comparison.

I only made the dressing, but its awesome. The only change I made is I used blue cheese, and doubled it. The dressing also works great as a dip.

I LOVED this dressing. It was so good that I made it 3 times in a row for our evening salads. I added a bit more blue cheese and extra pepper for kicks. Also, to make it super easy, it also tastes great with pre-packaged organic herb salads if you want to save on time. LOVED it!

This is a review of the dressing only - agree with the other reviews, an excellent dressing for any crunchy-leafed salad. I made mine with Stilton from Trader Joe's, and probably added more than the recipe called for. Also, used lowfat sour cream and mayo. Tip: For those who like to always have buttermilk on hand, I recommend keeping a cannister of Saco Cultured Buttermilk Blend (in powder form) in your fridge - it mixes up quickly with water for inclusion in any recipe calling for fresh buttermilk, and keeps indefinitely.

A terrific dressing for any salad!! I would add quite a bit more Gorgonzola and a touch more salt as it was a tiny bit mild but the crowd raved and raved! (and it was on a regular salad)

This dressing was SOOOOOOOO Good! I've made it twice already. It's better after it sits for about 8 hours. And even better the next day.

Delicious! Served it to 2 of our vegetarian friends and they also loved this.

Really good and super easy! I added a small clove of garlic to the dressing, and used a good quality blue cheese that I had on hand.

Excellent, delicate, try to get the right gorgonzola, not the typical supermarket variety. It's an interesting creamy dressing that goes really well with the greens they suggest and the great Braised Lamb Shank Shepherd's Pie that was also part of this menu.
