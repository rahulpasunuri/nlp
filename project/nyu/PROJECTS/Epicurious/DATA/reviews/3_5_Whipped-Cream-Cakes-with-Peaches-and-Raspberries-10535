This recipe was fine, not really sure why it got such great reviews. I don't think I'd make it again because it took longer than 25 minutes to bake and it stuck to the pan, and it just didn't have a lot of flavor. For that much fat I want a lot more flavor. However, if you do make this, raspberries and home made whipped cream are a must.

I substituted whole wheat pastry flour and splenda instead of sugar in this as I am hypoglycemic and try to cut out sugar wherever I can. The result was GREAT! The ww flour lent a taste almost like a sweet cornbread so I will use these in future efforts for both sweet and savory dishes. As for the fat in the cream vs what would be butter in any other cake, it's always a trade off. In this case it's a novel and very pleasant one.

I don't get all the fuss about these cakes, they were fine, but so not worth the calories of heavy cream--I didn't find them impressive at all.

These delicious little airy cakes were so light ,fluffy and delicate. They should call them fluffy angel cakes because they are so scrumptious. They took 35 minutes to make. Wonderful!

Very good cakes. Soft and light texture, and the flavor was so subtle. I loved them. Instead of using vanilla extract, I tried teh recipe with almond instead. The cakes would work very well if incorporated into a strawberry shortcake dessert, in my opinion. I wonder if I could modify the recipe to make an 8" or 9" round, full-size cake...?
