I've been making this for years. It's one of my most requested recipes. Here's my changes. I make it in a 12x 15" jelly roll pan, use premade pie crust dough, precooked and crumbled bacon, 2 whole eggs and 2 sweet onions. After baking, I cut into bar shapes and serve this as an appetizer. Delicious! This year, I'm making it with swiss cheese instead of gruyere, which is just too expensive.

I used a deep dish crust and baked at 10min @ 400 per review by RosiesMom, Added 2 onions and extra bacon. I did not add any salt. Easy and great light dinner with salad and fruit.

This was my first attempt at making any type of quiche and I am happy I chose this option! I did cheat and use a frozen deep-dish pie crust (I really hate a truly bad crust and am not patient or confident enough to make my own); I'm sure the crust here is better, but not so much that I imagine it would greatly change the flavor of the dish. I ended up cooking it for about 30 min once filled as opposed to the 25 for it to truly set, and it was perfect... my husband asked if we could have it weekly (based on the cream content, i said no). Easy to make, not a ton of ingredients, and quite delicious. Definitely adding it to my go-to recipes and will try more quiche!

this tart is addictive!mm mm mmm... i love that no "one" ingredient overpowers the tart, the flavors blend in beautifully and the crust melts in your mouth. i will continue to make this again and again.

Love this! I've made this so many times and each time I'm just licking my plate! I use store-bought crust and it tastes just as good : )

Used pre-made crust and only had cheddar on hand but it still went together well. Onions were sweet and a nice touch to the salty bacon and cheese.

i honestly think that this is a solid 3-fork recipe... "delicious" but not "exceptional". it's just a quiche, folks! i, too, found it a bit heavy. but it was definitely tasty. i threw in some thyme and will probably add a bit of creme fraiche rather than all of that whipping cream the next time around. hopefully that will give it more of a bite.

It's a little on the heavy side, but a guaranteed hit at parties! It will fool your friends and family into thinking you can really cook. I, too, used a pre-made pie shell and it turned out great.

Our dinner group had this as an appetizer and it was terrific.I made it a second time w/ premade crust and it was still wonderful.I will do this again and again.The crust recipe is very good and I think it would do well as a fruit pie crust too.

Very Good, BUT not worth my time. I have had better, quicker appetizers.

Made this last night for a cocktail party and it was delicious. I used a premade deep dish pie crust and doubled the onions. Absolutely yummy and very easy. I made the onions and bacon the day before and threw it together a few hours before guests arrived and served it at room temperature.

A fantastical tart! It is lovely as appitizer, side dish, or entree, and can play any role at any meal. I added a pinch more sugar for very caramalized onions, and about 1.5 times as much bacon. Also, I left it in a bit longer so that the top would be better browned, as it makes for a nicer appearance. Oh, and as this is almost better the day after because it sets more firmly, next time I'm going to leave more time for it to sit before I serve it.

This was great and easy! Be careful not to add too much more cheese than the recipe calls for as it will turn out way too salty.

Apparently, this was a great recipe. I served it at a large party and never did get to try it myself. I too doubled the onions and used the best bacon I could find. A definite keeper as I need to get a slice sometime.

Made this dish as an easy appetizer for a dinner party. I used purchased frozen mini tart shells and filled. Very good and easy to make if you don't make your own crust. I made onion/bacon mixture the day before. Mixed the liquid ingredients early in the day. 15 minutes before guests arrived I assembled tarts and baked about 10 minutes.

My sister and I chose this dish to make as part of a German inspired meal to honour my Mother's birthday. It is the perfect starter!!! The crust was buttery and flaky, and the onions incredibly sweet. Couple that with the bite of the cheese and the saltiness of the bacon and this dish is a complete WOW!!!! Definitely am planning to make this again. Everyone was talking about it then and still are NOW!!!!

These were absolutely delicious!! To save time, I used frozen mini tart shells and they were fabulous. I tested them out on myself and my boyfriend and now I will be happy to serve them to our guests at an upcoming dinner party.

Fabulous!!!! I have made this recipe 4 times and the ONLY change made was to double the amount of onion used (and to use a sweet variety when available). This makes for a great appetizer size when you use 4" tart pans. Everyone loved the flavors and were surprised how great onions can be!!!!!

Made 3 tarts for our Oktoberfest party and none was left. Our guests enjoyed it all too well. The carmelized onion, cheese, and bacon were a great combination. Since it was such a hit, I made it again for my girlfriends during a Sex and the City viewing party and paired it with a lovely frisee salad...my pals could not get enough of it. Cheers!

This is delicious! I made it for a "small plates" party (cut into bite sized pieces)and it was gone in fifteen minutes and to rave reviews. The cust was buttery and flaky and the onions were so sweet! Will definately make again!

This dish was fabulous and elegant at my holiday party! I used a pre-made pie crust, and a very generous pinch of sugar which made the onions extra sweet and carmelized. I browned bacon and onions ahead of time, and with pre made crust could throw it all together at the last minute. Everyone asked for the recipe!--A definite make again.

This is a really good recipe. I made it then refrigerated it and served room temp the next day. It was very tasty and rich. Easy to do with Pillsbury pie crust. Nice for a party or first course. It has a good bacon flavor because you sautee the onions in bacon fat.

Excellent! Thank you, reviewer from Florida for the suggestion of using extra egg white to brush over crust before blind baking! It made really helped keep the crust from getting soggy.

Rating: 4
This is just SO GOOD!!I did replace 1/2 of the heavy cream with skimmed milk and it was still sensational! Don't throw away that extra egg white , beat it up and use it to brush the bottom on the tart shell about 5 minutes before it is finished baking..this will keep the bottom from getting soggy.

Had to make a breakfast dish for a co-worker's birthday and all I knew was that he liked bacon. Found this recipe on a search, made it and won rave reviews. I added 1-2 more strips of bacon and a little more cheese. Turned out golden brown and beautiful. Co-worker said it was the best "quiche" he had ever eaten. Will serve again for sure.

I loved this as it "tasted" like it took hours to make! I added some green onions as I always do to my quiches and I used a prepared crust which worked well. Received rave reviews and requests for the receipe.

Absolutely the best tart! I served wedges of this tart along side my Easter brunch items. My guests were asking for seconds before they had tried the ham, etc. I wouldn't change one single ingredient. A definite keeper.

Delicious! Be sure to use the whipping cream; that's what gives this quiche a light and fluffy filling. The only thing I did different was to add garlic to the onions when I sauteed them. Yum.

This dish was excellent! I used a store bought pie crust and it was still fabulous. I also used 5 slices of bacon and smoked gruyere cheese. The sweetness of the onion was the perfect compliment for the salty and smokey flavor of the cheese and bacon. A spinach salad, french bread, and wine make this a perfect meal.

I made the tart (actually closer to a quiche) last evening using a pre-made deep dish pie crust and my children (ages 4 and 12) both loved it. The older one, a boy who would prefer to live on pizza, burgers, and fries, even asked me if I would make it again! I couldn't find Vidalia onions so I used a large red onion instead. I served it with a simple green salad and slices of bakery baguette.

I took one bite and knew that this is what I am going to be make for our Christmas morning brunch. It was delicious. I want to see if it can be altered a bit and add pear/apple and gorgonzola/bleu cheese in place of the Gruyere cheese.

Thought this was fantastic - very easy. I used a pre-made crust & aged gruyere cheese. Served it with the "apple, dried cherry and walnut salad with maple dressing"...the two complimented each other well.

This is very good! The caramelized onions add so much to the flavor. I recently prepared this for a brunch at work and it was quickly gone with several requests for the recipe. I even used a purchased pie crust and rolled it to fit my large tart pan.
