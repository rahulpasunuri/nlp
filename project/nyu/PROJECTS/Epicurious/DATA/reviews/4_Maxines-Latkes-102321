I know this recipe is a keeper because I even impressed my foodie (Jewish) boyfriend. Very easy to follow. Results were fantastic! Cooks' note: Once the oil is heated over medium heat, each latke only needs 2 1/2 minutes each side for a perfect golden brown crust.

I did not like this recipe. There did not seem to be enough egg, baking powder and bread crumbs for the amount of potato and onion. I doubled those amounts and finally got a decent latke going.

I have been using this recipe for almost 10 years. Over the years I have made a couple of changes. Like others I sub Matzo Meal for the flour. As to the potatoes, I grate half and using the steel chopping blade for the food processor, chop half of the potatoes. I place each batch of grated/chopped potatoes in cheese cloth over bowl, and wring out all the water from the potatoes before mixing the potatoes into the other ingredients. After several batches of the potatoes are squeezed out, when you pour the water out of the bowl, you will find the solidified potato starch. I add all that starch back into the potato mixture. Wringing out the potatoes and adding the starch back in makes the latkes more time consuming, but it is well worth the effort. Last night for 25 people, used 10 lbs of potatoes, make about 75 latkes, and ran out!

These latkes were fabulous. Delicious, simple and quick. A great recipe!

This was a fabulous recipe. Very simple and tough to screw up. As an FYI, for me it yielded roughly 25-30 latkes (I used 8 small potatoes instead of 5 large).

I didn't have baking powder, but no problems. I added a few TBSP of flour, more breadcrumbs (home made from a day old Grand Central baguette), and an extra egg. Tried some with olive oil, some with canola. not sure which i preferred. Great base recipe! and...i love the Schmaltz. i can't get a german kids baking song out of my mind as a result!

When I made these last night, I cheated and used part of a bag frozen shredded raw potatoes. After rinsing and squeezing out the excess liquid, I had 13 oz. of potatoes, so I halved everything else in the recipe. It made 6--1/3 cup pancakes that I formed by hand and fried in a combo of 1 Tbs. butter and 1 Tbs. canola oil. Served H/M applesauce on the side. They were VERY good, but I wonder why they wanted to fall apart??? Any suggestions would be appreciated...(I will admit to turning them more than once to make sure they were browning nicely.) Thank you. P.S. I didn't worry about being Kosher because I am not Jewish.

This is the second year I've made this recipe. Consistently good - and easy to make in large batches (ie, 10lbs of potatoes). I followed sjmcconway's suggestion from 12/08/04 and used 1 onion, 1 egg, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp baking powder per lb of potatoes. Skipped the flour, because we had wheat-free people coming. Didn't seem to kill the recipe. As sjmcconway says, each lb of potato yields about 1 dozen latkes. This time, I tried two variations. First, the traditional lacy-flat kind, fried in an inch of olive and peanut oil. The second batch we fried in safflower oil in a deep fryer. Since we scooped the potatoes in with an ice cream scoop, they came out in thick little spheres. Crispy on the outside, warm and smooth on the inside, and a fun change. I missed the flavor of the olive oil, but serving latkes in little balls really makes them easier to serve as finger food in large parties.

I really was just reading this recipe to see if I was forgetting anything from the recipe I have in my memory. As someone else mentioned .. skip the breadcrumbs & use matzo meal. Also to fix a couple problems that some of you wrote about: After grating the potato's put them in a colander. Then pour about a gallon of boiling water over them, mixing the potato's as you pour. This will turn the potato's back to their natural color (as long as you haven't let them turn black). This will also partial cook them so when you fry them the centers will be cooked all the way through without burning the outsides. Enjoy!

I have made this recipe twice. The first time was for my first grade daughter's International Luncheon. I made them again this weekend for Easter/Passover dinner. My daughter, who is a picky eater, loved them the first time but noticed that they tasted different tonight. I agree that I had better results the first time. The difference between the two preparations was that the first time, I used the KitchenAid grater attachment for the potatoes and onions and cooked smaller spoonfuls. I soaked the peeled potatoes in cold water until I was ready to grate them to prevent them from oxidizing.

These where wonderful! however, they seemed squishy inside, a bit undercooked, we tried to cook it slower and make them thinner the next time but it didn't help... I wonder if I'm doing something wrong? Also, the inside of them turned black quickly, very unapetizing I threw them out after that. If I can figuer out what I'm doing wrong I'll deffinitally make these again. I did follow the recipe to the T I believe.

I have a wonderful hint for those who think the preparation time added to the cooking time is too much to do all at once. I make the batter up to 3 days ahead. The potatoes won't turn black if the batter is stored in the refrigerator in an air tight jar or plastic container. Just leave a bit of room at the top and completely cover with a layer of flour. When ready to cook, skim off and discard the flour. The flavor is wonderful because all the ingredients have time to blend together.

These are the best potato pancakes I ever made.

I haven't tried the recipe, but I thought I should add a note: I don't think the recipe meant for the latkes to be cooked with oil that's not the ideal temperature for frying; I think he just meant that you should heat the oil over medium heat to bring it more slowly up to temp. You'll be better able to control the oil temperature and not push it over the edge. You definitely want to fry in hot but not smoking oil so that the latkes don't absorb too much oil. Also -- an old family tip: we always drained the cooked latkes of excess oil by putting them briefly on paper trash bags, a good reuse of the bags before recycling them. You can then keep the latkes warm in a 250 degree oven on a cookie sheet while the rest cook.

Squeezing out excess liquid is the secret to crisp latkes. Bread crumbs are not authentic, you need matzoh meal, if you can get it in your area.

I have not tried this variation, but I can tell you that my mother who's from the southern part of Poland grates the potatoes and l very large onion (that's what adds great flavor to the pancakes)she does NOT drain the juices, adds one large egg and enought flour to slightly thicken it, salt and a little pepper. Then would fry it in a cast iron (I don't always use the cast iron skittle)with hot oil until they're nicely crisp. Man-oh-man, the aroma was so wonderful that I would be eatting the pancakes as soon as they cooled on the plate. Oh, of course topped off with sour cream. Just thinking about it makes me want to make them tonight. Maybe I will.

Keep in mind that a food processor cannot grate the potatoes to a fine-enough consistency. So, you must put the potatoes throught the greater twice.

The first time I made these, I only had seasoned bread crumbs; great taste and I've stuck with these. I've probably made this recipe for the last 4-5 years and have some tricks: 1. Use enough vegetable oil so the latkes float--makes them crispy and absorb less oil. 2. Make sure oil is very hot before starting to cook latkes--again this is to make them crispy, not oily, because they cook very quickly. 3. Periodically drain all liquid from batter--the drier to mixture in the oil, the quicker it will cook so they are crisp.... I've cooked these in my daughter's grade school class for three years; the kids can help grate and mix. In our school, most kids have never heard of or tasted a latke; these are winners with them!

Should also mention it is easy to increase the recipe without having to double it--each lb. of potatos requires 1 onion, 1 egg, 1 Tbsp. potato starch, 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. baking powder. Yields 1 dozen.

Decided to make these for the first night of Hannukah. There are very few Jews in this part of the country, so I thought I would introduce the folks around here to a New Yorker's staple of the season. This recipe was great, although I had to adapt to available ingredients. I also will note some helpful tips. Five potatos peeled measured about 2 lbs. on the scale. I agree the grating disc on the food processor is great [?]. The recipe yields 2 dozen thin pancakes. No matzoh meal in Z'ville, and I think bread crumbs make gummy pancakes. Instead, drain off the excess potato liquid and use the potato starch at the bottom--yielded about 2 Tbsp. which was fine. I used half schmaltz and half peanut oil which worked well for me. The pancakes didn't brown too quickly, with the benefit of less saturated fat. I also fried a portion of the mixture using 1 cup of peanut oil and 4 Tbsp. of butter, just for giggles. They were fantastic! I know I might be opening up a new debate over traditional ingredients, but I'm Catholic so I don't keep kosher. Enjoy the holidays everyone.

These are the best latkes I've ever made. If you squeeze out all of the potato and onion liquid you have very crispy, lacelike latkes which my family thinks are the best.

I made a vegetarian version by using vegetable oil instead of schmaltz. Matzo meal replace bread crumbs as well. It was still delish except it was salty (the salt can be cut in half). Others said they were good, but they prefer the purist style--just potatoes, onions, salt, and lots of oil.

Unlike some of the people who tried this recipe, I've been cooking traditional Jewish foods my whole life (not that it's been soooo long, but you get the point.) This recipe strays a little from the traditional with the bread crumbs; but what's really out of the ordinary is the shmaltz! First of all, if you do decide to use chicken fat, if you keep kosher you can't have the sour cream (no mixing meat and milk) - and what's a latke without sour cream?!?! Secondly, the whole reason that Jews eat latkes and jelly doughnuts and other fried foods is to commemorate the miracle of the OIL (that is that there was only enough oil in the cruze to light the menorah for one day but it stayed lit for eight.) So you see, if you really want to celebrate Hanukkah the traditional way, stick with the oil!

Rating: 4
this recipe is flawed, latkes must be cooked in hot oil or they will become over saturated. please make sure your oil is hot if you want to try this. nothing wrong with a little scallion too. try peanut oil if you can't bear the thought of rendering chicken fat (it's delicous...)

just a quick suggestion. I did not make this recipe but use a similar one. You will get very good results by using the grater blade on a Cuisinart. It's very laborious to grate by hand; especially when entertainging crowds at Hanukkah. Enjoy! btw, Sundays AT Mooosewood Cookbook has an excellent recipe that i have used for years.

A variation for this recipe is to dump it into a greased baking pan and you have an easy potato kugel. Bake 400 for about 30 min. until crispy on the out side and tender in the inside. I bring to to my inlaws for Thanksgiving each year. (As a goyish son in law they are thrilled!) As for the bread crumb debate...I side with the matzo meal. You have to get rid of it somehow!

What, no Louisiana Hot Sauce? Y'all ain't got to wring the tater-onion mix dry. Prop the bowl up at an angle with the taters on one side. Drain the liquid after several minutes.

A quick question for those who have prepared this already: what's the yield on this recipe? It doesn't state here how many servings are produced. Thanks!

Excellent!! These taste delicious hot and were great the next day cold as well! Cooking them for the proper amount of time is key though... do not want to overcook, but want to get them crispy - about 12 minutes per side on med-low heat worked for me.

If there is any flaw in this recipe, it would be the directions for heating the oil. If you are using schmaltz (and I am a chef, and Jewish btw), you have to heat it at a lower temperature, due to the low flash point of poultry fat. If you use vegetable oil, you must heat it higher, as it has a much higher smoking temperature, and won't sear at lower heats. The recipe is quite good, and very straightforward. Matzo meal or bread crumbs...who knows? How close is it to Passover? Hope the notes on fats are useful to other readers. Incidentally: To the culinarily ambitious, to make schmaltz, buy fatty chickens, and take off all the skin and fat. You can reserve the skinless portions of meat to eat. Roughly cut up the skin and fat and cover with cold water. Bring to a simmer and simmer 2 hours. Let cool to room temperature. When cool, carefully skim off the surface chicken fat and refrigerate. You can freeze extra. Do at least five chickens, otherwise, it's a pain in the butt. Alternatively, buy duck fat and fry your latkes in that. Mmmmm! P.S. Adam Rapoport's combining of vegetable oil and schmaltz is the best of both worlds...it gives the flavour of the chicken fat with the high smoking temperature of the vegetable oil so browning and taste are not a problem.

My first try at latkes and we loved them! Had everything mixed up when I ralized I had forgotten to drain the potatoes and it didn't seem to make a bit of difference. Cut the recipe in half and still had some left over so poppped them under the broiler this AM and had them for breakfast. This is a keeper!!

I wouldn't make it again because I've always made them the way my mom and her mom made them - with matzo meal. Toasted bread crumbs are ok for folks who can't get matzo meal. Matzo meal and a HOT oil make for perfect latkes. Years of experience have taught me that.

I thought these were great. I didn't have any schmatlz (I never knew the origin of that word!) but regular oil did the trick. We always get great potato latkes at a local jewish deli, and this recipe is the closest I've come to replicating that experience.

This was my first serious attempt at traditional Jewish cooking, and a great success. My friends ate everything in sight and raved. The schmaltz added a lovely taste to the recipe.
