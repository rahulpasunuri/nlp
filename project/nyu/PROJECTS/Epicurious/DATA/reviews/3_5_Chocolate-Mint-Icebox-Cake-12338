I have made this as a log but I have found with children - this is BEST served as a frozen sandwich - cool and refreshing! I buy two boxes and fill the cookies with the filling. The last batch made I added more mint and no cocoa powder.

This didn't come out at all like I expected. The mint was not very strong, neither was the chocolate flavor. It was fine for my toddler who just liked the unique texture and sweetness, but it left much to be desired for a more sophisticated adult palate.

I was so excited to use mint from my garden in this recipe, but it added little flavor. More of a grassy taste than minty. Other than that it was delicious. Great presentation. Many of my co-workers asked how I got so many thin vertical layers. I did adjust the ingredient amounts; 2 C cream, 4 T cocoa, 6 T sugar. I don't see how 1 C of cream could ever cover all the wafers. 2C was just perfect and I preferred a little sweeter and chocolate-ier. Also topped with choc. curls...
