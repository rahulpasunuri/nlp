This recipe is AMAZING! Super easy to make and delicious! I would use this salsa on chicken as well as pork. So yummy!

I cut the recipe in half, and made this dish for me and my girlfriend for Valentine's Day. Everyone who tried it was blown away! Super easy and super delicious... and I've never even cooked before, hehe.

next time i would marinate the pork overnight. The cherry salsa was a winner and will make again just because...

"I didn't actually make this, but I've worked extensively with all of the ingredients listed here. . . " Congratulations. . . but you shouldn't actually "rate" this recipe.

Lovely! I marinated the pork overnight and made the salsa the night before as well. I used an indoor stovetop grill plate and the pork took about 45 min to reach the 145 degree temp as a result. I also did not include the pepper in the salsa, because my toddler daughter hates spicy food. It was delicious, but next time I will do two salsas, so my husband and I can enjoy the spicy version!

Not great...flavors not intense enough.

This was a tasty main course. The salsa is wonderful. We tried the salsa again with Elk steak and was a hit with everyone. Easy to make.

Tried this for family and loved it, there was plenty of the salsa leftover. Tried that as a dip the next day with corn tortilla chips and that was great too. I did change a couple of things though. I used walla walla sweet onion and a clove of garlic instead of shallots, and dried pepper flakes as a substitute for the chile.

I marinated the pork for 4 hours and made the salsa about 4 hours ahead of time with a fresh red jalapeno. Pork was tasty, but the salsa was really hot! I salted the salsa slightly to encourage it to juice up some after reading other reviews. But it sure wasn't bland (maybe it was the particular pepper I used-- and I even made sure to seed it). In fact, the salsa was so hot, you couldn't really taste anything else. And though I love spicy food, I think I'd cut the heat by using half the pepper or so. Good, but needs a little tweaking, imho.

Every time I make this it gets better. I've also made it twice for guests and they can't get enough. The key is great produce....I would also add another jalapeno.

I smoked the pork tenderloin first, and then finished it on the grill. The smokieness and the cherries really worked well together.

Great recipe and easy - I marinated the pork for most of the day and made the salsa ahead of time, too. The reviewers that thought this was bland might try again with allowing flavors more time to develop. Also, it's a good idea to season the pork generously with salt and pepper. I served it with rice pilaf and honey glazed carrots.

I made the cherry salsa the day before i was going to serve this. LOVED how the flavors melded together. Marinated the pork a full 24 hours and it was fantastic -- flavorful & moist on the grill. Grill time was fairly accurate-.needed only 5 minutes more. Rest time for meat was also accurate. I think i would have been disappointed if I had'nt let the salsa & marinade sit for 24 hours.

Can anyone suggest an alternative to the cherries as my husband can't stand them but we both love pork, coriander and chillies so I'd really like to try this recipe. Mmmm, maybe blackcurants?

Coming from someone who does not particularly like pork tenderloin, I thought this was delicious. I grilled it for just a bit longer than directed on my gas grill. The cherries were sweet, dark and meaty and the fresno chili added a good kick. Had artichokes alongside - a great June dinner.

Disagree with previous reviewer. I made this recipe "as is" save one thing... I "muddled" the salsa a bit after I made it. Just a little mashing to get the juice out of some of the cherries since i noted that the flavors weren't blending well. It just needed a little more liquid and an occasional toss to get the flavors going. I would absolutely make this for guests. It was very easy.

As it I found it uninspired. Nothing is done to the pork other than a general grill, so you're not getting much added flavor there. The Cherry Salsa may seem like there will be heat, but there isn't - the cherries and cilantro balance the heat to almost nothing. Too fresh and the salsa doesn't blend flavors, and leaving it sit for a while still doesn't produce anything extraordinary. Good for a mid-week dish, not something you'll be making for guests.

A lovely, quick, and impressive dinner when cherries are at their peak. My only change was to substitute a mixture of basil and parsley for the cilantro because my husband despises cilantro. The cilantro probably would have been better, but there was plenty of flavor with the herb mixture I used. Dinner guests loved it, especially the salsa.

I served this for a mid-week dinner gathering because so much of it could be done ahead of time. It worked out as planned though next time, I might dial up the hot peppers a bit and add more liquid to the salsa. I thought the dish needed a bit more moisture and a more liquid salsa would have done that. I served it with a brown rice mixture (because I could leave it to simmer while visiting with my guests). I might do a quinoa or orzo cold salad as a side next time. Will definitely make again this summer

My husband and I loved this. Used thick cut (bone in) pork chops instead of tenderloin. Had to use a green jalapeño since there were no red available. We marinated the pork for a couple hours. I also had trouble selecting a side dish. We had a summer salad and sautéed okra which was good, but not a good pairing. Maybe sweet potatoes next time.

This was an ideal recipe, simple to put together and offering an unusual mix of flavour - and colours on the plate. I probably overdid it with the coriander (cilantro) but, other than that, it worked well and was warmly received by the rest of the family. I served this with mashed potatoes and peas,which worked fine, but I would be interested to know what other people serve it with.

I was so excited to make this--with fresh cherries that I just purchased, but it was so dull! I added more cherries than called for to hopefully sweeten it up, but to no avail. I thought about trying to cook it and add some sugar to make it more of a chutney, because as is it was just too bland. Even with the heat of the peppers, and ALL of the cilantro it just didn't work!! The marinade was fine, but I too added more acid as well as salt and pepper to help it along. I wish it had been better---I was hoping to eat this all summer!!

I only gave it a 3 forks as I've always found pork tenderloin so boring a flavorless meat but I wanted to try this recipe for the cherry salsa and I do like a good pork chop with apple sauce. This cherry salsa was awesome, I doubled the recipe and between 3 of us the salsa was all gone it was that darn good, I made it about 4 hours ahead and just let the flavors meld at room temp. in a plastic covered glass bowl. You have to like cilantro thought to like this. I was trying to think what else this cherry salsa would be good with, perhaps a duck confit or how bout shredded duck meat tacos with a cherry salsa!

This was excellent. I was only cooking for two, so we just seared a couple of boneless pork chops and served them with the salsa. Very easy and very tasty. Couldn't get enough of the salsa!

The grilled Tenderloin is fabulous. I also used the marinade with some changes, of course! Who doesn't? Lime juice, olive oil, garlic (pressed, and fennel fresh herb makes this different but yum! Also substituted apple for the cherries. The fruit got lost.

Loved this! Marinated the pork for about 1/2 hr and it had this fantastic, fresh taste. I dumped the remaining marinade over it before cooking, pulled off some of the excess cilantro, put it in the oven at 375 for ~20 mins and it came out perfectly done and juicy. Doubled the shallots in both the marinade and the salsa, substituted safflower oil for the vegetable oil, and used 2 jalapenos (1 red and 1 green). I made the salsa first and let that sit while I did everything else. This is going in my summertime staple recipe box. How can you go wrong with fresh cherries? Next time I'll try grilling.

Very Good! I added some white wine and peppercorns to the marinade. One issue: I still find the need to cook all pork well done...any comments or enlightment?

The cherry salsa was a complete hit. The flavor and zing delighted everyone - even the pickier eaters. I used two Fresno chiles for added heat.

This recipe was greatly received at a potluck. I didn't have a grill for the pork, so I seared it in a pan and under a broiler. I heated the marinate with the drippings from the pork and made an additional deliciously potent sauce, and served on corn tortillas as tacos topped with cotija cheese. Yum. I'll definitely try this again, only next time with sour cherries.

Really enjoyed this dish. I marinated the pork for about 6 hours -- the pork has nice refreshing flavor. I used ripe Bing cherries, red jalapeno and made the salsa ahead of time to let the flavor meld. Only change was to quarter the cherries. I thought maybe next time I would chop cherries more, but my husband nixed that -- he liked the chunky-ness of the salsa.To enjoy the best flavor of the salsa, eat the salsa after a bite of the pork, not with the pork. Will definitely make again.

I used a jalapeno pepper (a lot of it since my boyfriend and I like spicy foods) and put all of the salsa ingredients in a food processor. It was great and the salsa was the highlight. Thinking about canning some to use when cherries are not in season.

Pork good but you'd better love cilantro. For us, it was a waste of delicious cherries.

Nothing special-if you like cherries it is an easy salsa but seems to be missing something

This didn't work for me. The pork came out great and the salsa looked good but didn't offer much flavor. I did use fresh cherries but perhaps it was just the variety available to me. I had hopes for this dish because I love cherries and thought this was a great idea. I loved the other ingredients in the salsa (cilantro, peppers, shallots) but the cherries didn't offer much. Perhpas other reviewers could comment on the type of cherries they used....

We loved it. 2.5 lbs fed 7 adults and 3 children with leftovers but will make more salsa next time.

I made this recipe being hesitant about using cherries but I must say I absolutely loved it. I made the recipe as written and would really look forward to cooking this for friends as I think it is also a very nice presentation.

Followed recipe as is except used a jalapeno - I don't have access to a wide variety of peppers in my area - and it was fantastic! Made just the salsa to go with chips at our neighborhood bbq - everyone loved it!

I made this for two BFF's last night. They both rated it 4 forks. Added 4 Tbsp dry white wine to the marinade which tenderized the pork.
