I am concerned about the recipe amounts - 17 pounds of lamb for 6 people? 16 chops per person? You much have hardy eaters!

I made the lamb this weekend and it was superb! I did toast the first 4 ingredients before grinding them. I did marinate for 24 hours. I used mini lamb T-bone chops that were quite thick and grilled 4 min per side and a achieved a perfect rare-med rare! My husband called it a do-over!!

For the reviewer who found it musty (or anyone else for that matter), I had a similar experience the first time around--it was fine, but a little dusty tasting without the presence I wanted from these flavors (which I love on lamb). I recommend toasting the cumin, coriander, and cinnamon before grinding, cutting down on the paprika, and being very generous with the salt before grilling. The salt is key in bringing the charmoula to the foreground.

I am a caterer and I use this recipe to make appetizers with small lamb chops.As a dip to serve with it I combine 1 lt vanilla yogurt, 1 tbsp wasabi powder & 2 oz finely minced pickled ginger. My clients rave about it! 4 forks doesn't do it justice!

I have used this recipe over the last five years in a professional setting. I have shared it with other caterers and chefs... RAVE REVIEWS. The spice is great. Sams club has the best chops/racks for the money. YUM!

Overall, after a long period spent marinading the lamb, the dish tasty musty, rather than flavorful or spicy. Quite a disappointment!

Overall, the lamb, after marinading in the sauce for some time, wound up tasting almost musty, not nearly as spicy and flavorful as the recipe sounds. Definitely not for repeating.

Pefect! I will admit I ended up doubling the spice rub - not sure why I needed that but I also used Lamb sirloin which worked well - next time would probably try the chops. I also marinated for 24 hours which I agree was a good call - think it does make a difference. It was definately a show stopper. Served it with the seven vegetable coucous and chunky harissa recipe which complimented it.

I prepared this recipe for a dinner party about one month ago. Instead of using lamb chops, I used rack of lamb, which I purchased at Sam's Club. While the lamb was excellent, I wonder if I would have been more impressed with the flavors of the rub if I had used it on chops. Honestly, I really didn't seem to get that much bang for my buck - and my husband agreed. (I marinated the racks for at least 24 hours.) I will certainly make the recipe again, next time using chops. Also, if you need a dish that's impressive for a group of people who you really don't know, but for whom you need to prepare a nice meal, this is it. (Which is why I made it...)

Great recipe! This whole menu is really great. The couscous and the eggplant complement the lamb so well. I can not wait to make it again.

I needed a good, hearty, and flavorful lamb dish to pair with a full bodied red wine for a wine and food pairing that I was hosting. I followed the recipe with some minor substitutions and it was PERFECT! Everyone RAVED about it!

We have prepared this dish for every "special" occasion (when we weren't duplicating crowds!) since I first found it... A 50th wedding anniversary, an engagement party, etc. We always match it with a cool, fresh crab salad. Wonderful!

Outstanding recipie. I made it for four of my friends for our monthly satuday night festival which is an overindulgence of food, wine and cigars. My fiends gave me a standing ovation and have begged me to make it again. Kudos to Epicurious.com

Perfect dish for entertaining - easy, can prepare ahead, and it's unlikely that your average guest has already samples these extraordinary flavors.

I use cubed lamb shoulder for kebabs rather than the chops. It's an impressive but easy dish. Invite your friends over for a summer bbq!

We use this recipe constantly at our catering company. The chops hold up well on a buffet and are still quite excelent at room temperature. We mark only one side on our grill at the shop and then finish them either in ovens or in the caves if on location. A quick falsh sets them up nicely.

I put this recipe into the permanent collection. We broiled the chops instead of grilled because it was raining and found that they only took 5 1/2 minutes in the broiler. This was very easy and full of flavor even with the minimum 2 hours of marinating. With the Israeli couscous and eggplant it was a wonderful meal.
