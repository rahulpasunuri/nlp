Very good! Made to recipe, except two tweaks: added some herbes de provence during the browning; added a Tbl of flour to the sauce at the end to thicken. But it was using exceptional heirloom plum tomatoes from my friend's garden that made this dish amazing.

This was excellent!! Everyone ate and ate and ate - even the 2, 4 and 5 year olds. I served it with brown rice - excellent!!

This is a really solid recipe, nice flavor, but something is missing. The sauce is a bit too thin. Parmesan cheese? I made it exactly as written except I used boneless skinless breasts for health reasons. Maybe more anchovies? Overall, a nice dish.

I love this recipe and have made it many times. I think I've actually made it better than the original by testing and tweaking. I've posted my adapted version at ellebeaugrease.blogspot.com

Delicious.We made it with skinless, boneless thighs and don't feel like we missed out on any flavour. We added a touch of flour to thicken the sauce. This had great flavour and was a quick and easy french-influenced dish. Give it a try.

So 'A Cook" - you basically made up your own recipe which had nothing at all to do with the original but you gave yourself 4 stars. Am I missing something?

Excellent, but I too made major changes for convenience and to bring out the basil: I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, left out anchovies, olives, & capers (thought the flavors would overpower the basil); I added basil after combining chicken and sauce, then baked at 350 degrees instead of in the pan until chicken reached 165 degrees...delicious! I served it with extra fresh basil on whole wheat linguine; will have to try it again with the omitted ingredients for variation.

This was just darn tasty hearty cooking. Yummy for any time of the year. Was happy to use my garden basil. Serving for good friends on Tuesday night. Easy to make. Doesn't get much better than this.

Nice recipe, going to make it tonight, but NO onion?? I will definitely use one, seems like they've forgotten it. And of course you shouldn't omit the anchovy, integral part of the overall flavour for sure.

I made this last night. We both loved it. Simple to make and quick too. I made it with boneless skinless chicken thighs, because its what I had. I cooked the olives for longer than the recipe calls for as my husband likes but not loves them. It mellowed them a bit so he actually said he loved the olives in it. I would make this for company for sure.

I have made this dish maybe a dozen times. I love it! By far my favorite chix provencal recipe. I never really follow the precise amounts dictated by the recipe, using the amounts of the ingredients I happen to buy or have around, and it has never been less than satisfying and perfectly delicious. I always use the thigh meat, and now that I am no longer afraid of them, I like to double the anchovies. It goes brilliantly with couscous. I've made it for several dinner parties and it has always been a hit. It's ideal if you just let it slow cook in the oven for six hours at a low temp. For dinner parties this is perfect, because then you can attend to other things, knowing that the big dish is pretty much out of the way! And the best part is that you can make a double recipe and then freeze it in batches, and as long as you eat it within six months of freezing it--it somehow manages to get tastier and tastier.

Very good. I had to change a few things to use what I had on hand. Boneless chicken breast instead of thighs. Also used drained petite diced tomatoes, and tawny port in place of the dry white wine. Couldn't really taste the basil with the strong flavors of anchovy, capers and olives, but loved to overall flavor of this dish.

Delicious, quick and easy to prepare. I agree, do not use extra salt as the olives add a level of saltiness. Thank you Bon Appetit and Janet Fletcher!

Absolutely loved this simple recipe! Lots of flavour and even tastier next day. Used anchovy paste in a tube and no extra salt. Everyone raved!

This is a keeper! It really is so easy but totally packed with flavor. I followed the recipe exactly except that I used anchovy paste instead of anchovies. Also, I used hot house tomatoes instead of plum because they looked better. I think it would be awesome in the summer when tomatoes taste really good but there are so many layers of flavor that it doesn't really matter if the tomatoes taste great. Next time I don't think I will salt the chicken when I brown it as it was just on the edge of too salty, probably my own heavy hand!

My husband made this recipe for the first time today. We fell in love with it. Even our neighbor had seconds. We will definitely have this again. Not only was the taste absolutely wonderful it looked wonderful. We are not fans of anchovies so omitted them.

I skipped the anchovy. This is savory and worth adding to your repitore.

I made this with skinless thighs to reduce the amount of fat and served it over wheat pasta. Definitely tasty and easy to make. The recipe was a wee bit salty (read: a LOT bit). I think I added a little too much caper juice, and when combined with the anchovies and olives, it was overwhelming. As a result, the sage and thyme flavors were overpowered. I would add twice the amount of the herbs next time... and there will definitely be a next time. It's a great weekday meal - you can do the dishes/clean the kitchen while the dish is simmering!

I was surprised by the bad reviews of this recipe! It is chock full of flavor. I think the key is browning the ckicken so the skin gets nice and crispy. I browned for several minutes longer than the recipe called for, and as a result, cooked for less time with the tomato/garlic mixture. It is a great, easy recipe and I will definitely make it again and again!

This is ok, nothing special. Perhaps it would be better left overnight to let the flavors blend.

Very good, but I didn't like the rubbery braised skin so the next time I removed it after browning but before braising.

Warning: This is one of those obnoxious reviews where I changed many things because I didn't want to go to the store. So. . . I used sherry instead of white wine and omitted the anchovies which worked fine because I used olives that were salty on their own. When the thighs were finished the "sauce" was more like a wet tomato paste consistency, so I added about 3/4 cup of chicken stock at the very end to get it to be a real sauce. Result: Fantastic!! I save 4 stars for a religious experience, but it was extremely tasty in a French provincal kind of way.

After combining all ingredients in a dutch oven, I baked it in the oven at 300 for about an hour and the chicken fell apart. It was fantastic! I used skinless breasts cut in half which worked also.

We didn't care for this recipe, which was surprising because all the ingredients sounded like it would be really great.

easy and delicious. served with crusty bread and arugula salad- next time will serve with spaghetti, there is a lot of sauce. used twice as much anchovies and lots of fresh basil from the garden.

This was an excellent dish, however I used chicken breasts instead of thighs. I also added a can of chopped artichoke hearts, sliced mushrooms and roasted red bell peppers. To keep the skin from getting soggy, I placed the browned chicken breasts on top of the sauce and baked in a 375 degree oven for one hour uncovered. Towards the end of the cooking time I sprinkled the dish with freshly grated Parmesean cheese. I served this dish with a side of pasta, using the sauce from the chicken to cover it. I also served warm crusty bread and a salad of sliced fresh mozerella with tomato, basil and roasted red pepper strips, topped with an anchovie butter dressing.

Absolutely delicious! Easy, quick. Used fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden. Didn't have anchovies on hand and still turned out great. Added some fresh homemade reduced tomato sauce at the end.

this combo of olives, capers, anchovies and basil was so delicious and easy to make. Serve with either pasta or crusty bread to fully appreciate the great sauce.

I'm not a huge fan of olives or anchovies, but when you put them together in this recipe, it is just delicious. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, and I definitely recommend serving a crusty bread to help soak up the extra sauce. Will definitely be making again.

This was quite delicious, especially if you love olives and have basil in your garden. Used skinless thighs, but did not use anchovies, and it did not take away from the taste. Fresh tomatoes helped plus extra wine. My husband and I both raved. linda1948

We love saucy chicken dishes but this one was disappointing. It might be improved by adding the last four ingred along with the chicken so the flavors could develop a bit more and infuse the chicken with flavor.

Easy to make and very tasty too. I serve it over brown rice. For a busy cook, this recipe is a quick dinner on a weeknight.

This is an easy and delicious entree. I will definitely make it again. Add the bread and a green salad for a real taste treat.
