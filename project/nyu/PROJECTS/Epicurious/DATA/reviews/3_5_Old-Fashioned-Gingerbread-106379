I increased the spices as many reviewers suggested and the results was delicious. My husband is from India and craves anything with spice - Mexican food, Indian food, whetever. What I loved was the texture of these cookies. They were crunchy on the outside and tender as could be on the inside. Perfect!

WHOOPS! I went a bit nuts with the spices in this one--added too much ginger and singed the nose-hairs out of several altogether-too-trusting family members. *evil laugh* But aside from that, I agree with others--it would have had a pale flavour if I had stuck to the suggested amounts.

This isn't the one for me. Even after doubling the spice amounts, I thought the taste was bland( the aroma was excellent, and deceiving). Cake itself was heavy. I've found much better gingerbread recipes. One on this website is called Gramercy Tavern gingerbread--excellent.

I had a horrible afternoon in the kitchen. Dropped an egg, shell and all, into the bowl while the mixer was on. Started over. Stopped to mop the floor after the pup raced through the kitchen with muddy feet. Stopped to mop the floor after I dropped the molasses jar onto the floor. AArrrggghh! But, the results were well worth it. Moist, spicy (but not too--I doubled the spices as other reviewers suggested), delicious. My kids, including my picky 12-year-old son, loved it. Will definitely make again.

A simply marvelous recipe for gingerbread! Moist,dense and it keeps well. I added about twice as much of each spice and also added 2 tablespoons of crystalized ginger puree,which gives a bit of a bite! I used a muffin tin to make individual cakes and served them with lemon curd--my guests and my husband adored them!

This is a nice "safe" recipe for gingerbread. It's tasty and moist. However, it wouldn't, in my opinion, be the ultimate gingerbread that one remembers fondly. Although I added a touch more ginger, I wish I'd been more daring and added much more spice as did other reviewers. I did add a small pinch each of nutmeg and allspice. A very good accompaniment to gingerbread is a tart lemon dessert sauce. Even with this, I found the gingerbread too sweet for our tastes. White sugar might work better in this recipe than the brown sugar called for. Note: This freezes well and warms up nicely in the microwave or toaster oven.

Definitely at least double the amount of spices. I also added a tablespoon or two finely chopped crystallized ginger for an extra kick. A simple recipe that definitely hits the spot - house smells great while baking, too!

I didn't have any molasses so I used regular honey and it came out great! I used at least twice the amount of spices it called for and the cake got raves from my husband.

A great basic gingerbread recipe - perfect without adjustment of any kind. The brown sugar cream from the recipe for tcranberry gingerbread on this site was a great accompanimen
