Simple and fresh, is how I would describe this recipe. With only 5 ingredients, I love the way you can taste each of the flavor components. I made the recipe with Irish bacon and farm-fresh eggs and will definitely make again.

Not sure why they're calling a breakfast of yaki onigiri "American" but I riffed on this idea and made a mixed-rice onigiri with shallots and bacon. I also used the bacon grease as my fat for frying...

I made this recipe as part of a brunch-for-dinner entertaining. It was a big hit, though I had some picky eaters. To make it more adventurous (and because I guests who I wasn't sure ate pork) I switched the meat to a choice of country ham or smoked salmon. It was a big hit for the whole crowd of seven, which included 2 really picky eaters. I tried both the country ham and smoked salmon variations, and thought they were delicious (preferred smoked salmon, though).

It just didn't really taste good for me, someone else might like it though.

Like the previous reviewer, I make something very close to this for breakfast with leftover Chinese-take-out white rice, over-easy eggs and warmed up twice-cooked pork (I call it "three-times-cooked pork"!)

I used to get this in Maui...they served it with chinese BBQ pork strips & soy. I always make it with poached eggs. so good.
