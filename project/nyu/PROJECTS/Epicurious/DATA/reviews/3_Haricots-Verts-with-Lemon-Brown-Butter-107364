Yummy - I wish there had been leftovers. I made these for Thanksgiving and again for a dinner for 20 one week later - with both I added toasted pine nuts as a final touch. I blanched the beans early in the day, then finished them immediately before serving. Couldn't have been easier.

This is no showstopper, but it's a really nice side dish. It's light and refreshing, and was a great contast to all the other heavy, rich flavors in our Thanksgiving meal.

Simple and flavorful preparation for green beans.

Made with 3 lbs. of regular green beans for Thanksgiving and it was very good--at first I thought it was too salty but it's the lemon that makes it really tangy. It could have extra elements added, but this is nice if you're looking for something simple without being boring.

This is how I usually make my Thin Pole Green Beans, especially when they are right from my vegetable garden. However, I add Minced Garlic to the mix. this is an exceptional addition.

This time of year when you can get those great thin and tender beans is the best time to make this recipe. The taste is light and clean, a great compliment to the creamier and heavier tastes that abound during this season. Try using Ghee, or clarified butter, for a rich and delicate taste.

Is this a recipe, or merely a way to cook green beans? This is like saying that steamed brocoli is a recipe. However, I added a few well-drained capers, and I like the idea of small lardons of bacon, too.

Doesn't pass as is. Add two fillets of salt-packed anchovies. Soak anchovies in 1-2 TBS red wine vinegar and about 1/2 cup water for at least 15 minutes. Squeeze fillets dry, chop roughly and add with lemon juice. This should add the 'basso' or earthiness this dish lacks.

How nice to have a one serving recipe, which looks like it could easily be multiplied. Light and tasty. By the way wouldn't bacon and onion make a totally diferent dish? ( I too love garlic and onion)

I have what might be a stupid question...I noticed it says it yields just one serving. Why couldn't the measurements have been adjusted for multiple servings from the start? Unless that was a typo...in which case, how many servings does it yield? I'm definitely interested in making it, but I anticipate messing up what looks like a very simple recipe.

As well as the butter and lemon, I add about a teaspoon of prepared mustard(either the yellow mild or Dijon) before adding the beans.

I loved these! They were a little too lemony, which is probably becuase I didn't measure the lemon, next time I'll be more careful! They were also super easy!!
