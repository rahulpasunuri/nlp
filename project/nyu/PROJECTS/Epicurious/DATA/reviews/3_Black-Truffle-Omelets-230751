Great recipe, and easy for entertaining. Got to believe the chocolate truffle thing is a joke...

Rating: 3
This rating is going to wind up skewed because the first reviewer made a chocolate omelette - unless that is a joke, that was a pretty good chuckle! I made this with fresh black truffle, sliced on a Norwegian osthovel, and really enjoyed it. The intense flavor of the truffle permeates the eggs, and the eggs are a wonderful foil for that flavor - sumptious. But, I agree with the cook from Laurel, MD...at $699.00/lb, this is an extravagant egg dish. I'll do it again with canned truffles.

As some may have surmised after reading previous review, there are multiple types of truffles, chocolate vs. tubers/wild mushrooms. I did not have fresh truffles (tubers/wild mushrooms), but made the recipe with canned truffles in oil brought from Italy. The truffles gave the omlets an earthy flavor. I expect that most cooks with expensive fresh black mushrooms may want to use them in a more exotic/fancy dish.
