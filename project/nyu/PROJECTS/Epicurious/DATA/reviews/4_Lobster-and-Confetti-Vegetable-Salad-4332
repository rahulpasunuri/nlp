To libby6, seasoned rice vinegar contains added sugar and salt. It's what gives sushi rice its distinct sweet and sour taste. To substitute unseasoned rice vinegar, you will need to use about 2-3 parts vinegar to 1 part sugar and add salt to taste.

I realize i'm a minority here but I really believe that less is more and this recipe proves why. A lot of people seem to think that great recipes must involve a ton of ingredients in order to be good. But if you have a sensitive palate, all you get is competing flavors. I would not waste anymore lobster on this.

Seasoned rice vinegar is salted. You can easily substitute regular rice vinegar and salt to taste.

What is "seasoned" rice vinegar? I have regular rice wine vinegar-is that the same?

This salad dressing should be a recipe all its own! Quick and easy to make and great for any green salad ( I used it with baby greens, grapefruit and blood orange segments, goat cheese and candied pecans).

I was too afraid to invest in lobster tails to initially try this recipe, so I used pan sauteed shrimp. It was FABULOUS.....next time I will definitely use the lobster!

Absolutely fabulous! Could easily have used more lobster as it tends to get lost in the other salad ingredients but got rave reviews from everyone! Incredible dressing - will definitely make this one again!

This is a great recipe. However, the leftovers do not retain flavor--eat it freshly made.

Easy and fabulous! We rarely cook lobster because of the fuss, but using the tails alone really eases the process.
