sorry to say that i found this to be a bit bland. i added alittle djion to perk it up a bit but it didn't do enough for me. i also mixed some greek yogurt in with the mayo to tone down the calories. one thing for certain is to use the best mayo you can get which is think is trader joe's. the lemon and carrots are a nice touch.

This was just what I was looking for, an alternative to the norm. I used 1/2 as much mayo and celery seeds instead of celery, all else as is. Stuffed into toasted "Columbo" sourdough rolls rubbed on the inside with raw garlic and tomato. it had them swooning (over a TUNA sandwich!) Thanks! A new fav.

Very colourful. Used low-fat yoghurt instead of mayo.

I made this for a bridal shower and it was a hit! One of the guests said it was the best tuna salad she'd ever had. I don't care much for tuna salad myself, but even I thought it was quite good. The additional veggies really dress it up. The colors make for a pretty presentation. Nice fresh flavors. Will definitely make this again.

Good lord...I wonder if people read recipes or just look at the page for 3 seconds! The "cook" from OR said next time she would drain some of the cans????? recipe said:"4 six-ounce cans drained chunk white tuna in water"...That means, NO water! How in the world did she give 3 stars when she obviously ended up with cold tuna soup?!?!?!? OMG!!! Anyhow...the difference for me, from the typical tuna salad, is the predominance of carrots and the addition of fresh garlic to mayo...that will make a zestier, more flavorful sandwich filling than the usual! Love it!

This is my favorite tuna salad. I use the vacuum packed tuna instead of canned & a little more than half the mayo so it's not so goopy.

A really nice, fresh sandwich loaded with veggies. I made mine by omitting the scallions and adding sweet red peppers.

This is good tuna salad, but not exceptional. At least it's easy! Next time, I'd drain at least half of the cans of tuna (like I normally do when making tuna salad). It was too watery with all that liquid.
