Loved this! Although following all the advice of previous reviewers I did make a lot of changes. caramelized the onions, added garlic, then red and yellow peppers. Used ras al hanout plus tony cachares creole spice as a rub on the chicken. Deglazed the pan with wine before adding broth. Used zucchini and bite sized potatoes. A keeper reinvented recipe!

Delicious, with many substitutions and omissions. Used what I had, celery, carrots, and cauliflower, instead of artichokes and fennel. Added some ras al hanout and served it with a bottled Moroccan Harissa sauce. Outstanding and not too much work.

I really enjoyed this dish. It's very "springy." I halved the recipe, used frozen artichokes, and addeded some white wine. I double the spices, and used zucchini instead of fennel, as per previous reviewers.

I love this recipe! I make it every year for Rosh Hashana and get rave reviews I make a huge batch and freeze some. It reheats beautifully

I made this dish for Passover this year. The most laborious part of the recipe is definitely prepping the artichokes; however, the results were well worth it. The results were fairly spectacular. The flavors were complex and balanced, and the spices were delicious without being overpowering. I punched up the herbs a bit and used Meyer lemons which added more depth and a little sweetness to the dish. I would definitely make this again, and not just for Passover! I served it with Saffron Rice, in the Sephardic tradition, and it was delicious.

This recipe results in a "good" meal but for the amount of work was a dissappointment. I spent 3.5 hours chopping, chopping, cutting, chopping, and cooking. Because of the raves from previous reviewers I had anticipated something really amazing. No luck. If you don't mind the time/energy investment for something that is "good" (B+) but not "great" (A+) I recommend it. If not, I'd say look elsewhere.

This recipe is "shockingly good" in the words of my guests. I tripled it for a birthday party (my 50th!) and held my breath, not sure what to expect. As many others have noted, it is nothing much to look at and takes all day to make. But boy is it worth it. I followed the recipe almost to a T, except that I used bone-in thighs, which were great, half fennel and half zucchini, and I didn't have quite as much lemon zest as called for. Whether it tastes good the next day I'll never know since there was not a scrap left. Highly recommended.

I halved this recipe and don't think the proportions were exactly right. I was expecting a bit more "punch" with all the amazing spices. Not to say this wasn't delicious. I also went ahead and used canned artichoke hearts and did soak them in lemon water. Served over brown rice.

Wonderful recipe! A little work, but if you use frozen artichoke hearts not too much. Have made it often for holidays. Everyone loves it!

Very delicious, although the artichokes were hard to make (then again, I never make artichokes...) This is a pretty hearty meal; I'd probably make this in the winter time when it's cold out. The chicken thigh meat is extremely tender after being left to cook the rest of the way in the simmering tagine.

This was a surprisingly good and somewhat "easy" meal to make. I made one major change and a few small ones: 1) (Big) I doubled the coriander, paprika, cumin, and ginger. Also, I use about 1/2 or so of those spices along with the cayenne as a rub for the chicken. I put it on from an hour to a day ahead of time. 2) To deepen the flavor, I cook the onions until slightly caramelized. Then I add the rest of the ingredients to bloom the spices, etc. I put it into a bowl when done. 3) Like many others, I use bone in chicken thighs. I then brown the thighs in the pan I just took the onion mixture out of. 4) To save dishes, time, etc., I just put everything back into the pot. 5) We're not huge fennel fans, so we substituted zucchini. I added the carrots after about 10-15 minutes and the zucchini after I took off the lid. 6) I used a slurry to thicken the sauce after boiling it down for 10-15 min. I leave in the veggies while boiling until they're done. No mush.

i was very pleasantly surprised by the simplicity and flavor of this dish. one pot, can be done in a slow cooker. calls for boneless thighs but bone-in thigh/leg quarters work fine. goes with almost every starch in the book... rice, mashed potatoes, polenta, etc... whatever you can use to soak up the sauce!

This is a wonderfully savory dish, especially if you allow the flavors to blend for a day. I used bone-in thighs and canned artichokes sprinkled with lemon juice, and the results were excellent as well as time- saving. I also thickened the gravy at the end with some cornstarch. Next time, I'll add the carrots and fennel during the last 20 minutes to keep them from getting so soft. The fresh herbs at the end are a must for me. This will be a favorite.

Wonderful and terrific! We looked at the reviews and served it on a platter-vegetables on the bottom, chicken on top. It worked great and looked less mushy. The Flavors were delicious. Maybe steam some of the vegetable to add to the mushy ones for color and texture? This was a huge hit at the seder. My sister in law who is a big Passover pessimist said, huh, I would make this during the rest of the year!

I just made this dish to serve at seder tomorrow. I can't wait to eat it because it is delicious from every taste so far. My husband says so too. It does take a long time to prepare. I used canned artichokes though I still soaked them in the lemon water. Also my husband is not a big fan of fennel so I used only 1 fennel bulb (I doubled the recipe by the way). Instead of the rest of the fennel I added sunchokes and parsnips. I think you could also easily add mushrooms. I also ran out of ground coriander as I was preparing it and used fresh cilantro instead. It is a very good addition. I also gave it a dash of cinnamon. I don't know how the liquid could reduce as needed in 10 minutes. I let it simmer to boil for 20 minutes to get the consistency I expected. Can't wait to eat it at dinner tomorrow. Will serve it with the quinoa with carrots and zucchini. I think it will be a nice complement.

This dish was delicious, but time-consuming. I was giving it a test-run before Passover, but don't think I'll make it for the holiday now--it has too many steps and, as others have mentioned, it looks pretty messy when served. I used preserved lemon rind instead of the lemon peel, and canned artichokes and the flavors were delicious. The chicken was moist and my family loved it, but I'll only make it again when I have a lot of time to cook!

I loved it, but I did make some fairly drastic changes based on what I had in the house. I used canned artichoke hearts. I used dried parsley. I swapped basil for the dill and mint. I only had bone-in chicken thighs, so I de-boned them and skinned them, but then had way less meat, so I threw in some dark meat from a roast chicken I had lying around. I didn't have fennel or carrots, so I used parsnips, asparagus, and summer squash. After all these exceptions, I wouldn't even call it the same recipe! That said, I followed all the steps as directed and it came out great. It seems like this cooking method: saute onions, bloom spices in fat, set aside, brown meat, set aside, bring broth to a boil, add to pot, add vegetables; is a pretty good general method. I'll make it again.

This dish is extremely time=consuming to make but is worth the effort. It has wonderful flavors and pairs well with a Shiraz. On the other hand, it has no eye appeal, so dim the lights for the meal.

Made this for Passover this year. I used frozen artichokes and used half boneless/skinless breasts in addition to thighs for the white-meat eaters in my family. Overall, it was tasty, though the sauce did not thicken as I hoped it would. I reduced like crazy, but it stayed thin. I even tried to thicken with flour, but it didn't help. We ate it for lunch the next day and it was much better than it had been the previous night. I highly recommend making this dish the day before you plan to serve it. It made a huge difference. This recipe seems like it would adapt really well to slow cooking in a crockpot, as well.

I haven't made this yet, but it sounds fantastic and will make it for Passover this year. For those folks who used either canned or frozen artichokes, what is the amount that you used (1, 2, or 3 cups)?

Delicious. Used homemade chicken stock. Next time will use frozen artichokes, as that was the most time-consuming part. Herbs/spices were right on, not overwhelming.

I made this recipe for Seder with some trepidation -- I'm not fond of fennel, don't like thigh meat, and the amount of herbs seemed overwhelming. When it was done, it sure wasn't pretty, but, oh, is it delicious! Everyone loved it, and the leftovers just get better and better. I did put in some breast meat, but it really didn't need it.

This was a great Passover dinner. My kids loved it and asked for seconds! I used chicken breasts, canned artichokes, pickled lemons instead of grated peel and omited the fresh herbs since I forgot to buy them. It was still wonderful but no leftovers. I will make this throughout the year.

I have made this recipe for Passover and it was a big hit. Most of my family does not like dark meat so I added boneless chicken breasts, cut to about the same size as the boneless thighs so that everything gets done at the same time. It works perfectly.

I'm thinking of making this recipe for Passover. Question to those of you who've made it before: Do you think it would be good if I also add some boneless chicken breast pieces to accomodate the family members who prefer white meat, or would the meat dry out?

I was VERY HAPPY with this. I also used canned artichokes. I did the work for the others but they didn't look too nice so i got rid of them. The flavours were wonderful and I loved that I could make it the day before and just warm it up. Served it with a nice rich risotto and it was a perfect mix. YUM!

This was fabulous, eventhough I overcooked it a bit. I'd never made fennel before and don't like licorice flavor, but when cooked the fennel was great.

I used canned artichoke hearts to cut down on the prep time. I also used a non-stick frying pan and decreased the oil by half. We served with this with couscous and a cucumber salad. It was a huge hit with the entire family (kids included).

Twas a tasty dish, but waaaayyyyyy too much work for what its worth. Addition of fresh herbs at the end is such a nice touch and we love artichokes and fennel in my home, but I'll head over to Atlantic Avenue next time I'm in the mood for this dish.

The dish was very tasty. I made it a day ahead and the flavors were enhanced. The preperation time was quite long. Because I live at 9,800 feet the cooking time was also longer by 15 minutes.

Like the cook before me noted, this really ought to be made ahead of time so the flavours are allowed to deepen. It was still quite good. I had to quarter the amounts, as it was only for my husband and myself, so my proportions may have been a bit off, but we still enjoyed it. Next time, however, I will skip the artichoke altogether and just increase the fennel. The fennel tasted heavenly after stewing. I served this with a fresh baguette and a chilled light Spanish red.

Very good recipe, with subtle, complex flavors. I used bone-in, skinless thighs and canned baby artichokes and made this two days ahead so the flavors could blend. In the future, I'd use fresh artichokes but otherwise wouldn't change a thing. Last comment: preparing in advance allows you to skim the fat, thereby lowering the fat content of this recipe.

This was the best chicken I have ever eaten! But, I made a couple of changes. First, I used chicken thighs with bones and skin. Second, I used artichoke hearts canned in water, drained, and then sprinkled with lemon juice. It was amazing!!!

I substituted 12 baby artichokes cut in half for the 6 large ones. Because they have no chokes, the baby ones are easier to prepare. Rave reviews from all!
