! inch); ended up broiling for 15min then had to bake at 450 for additional 5 min. The fish was very moist and tender. Just keep an eye on it. Took the asparagus out at the 10min mark, they were good but next time I'll make sure I get the thickest asparagus I can find. We had it with white rice drizzled with soy sauce and sriracha. Can't wait for next time!

Fantastic recipe to blow away your guests. It happens everytime. I usually acompany it with a dry Sake. Be careful to not scorch it and make sure the fish is extra fresh so you can prepare it just right. I also like to fry the asparagus in a combination of olive oil and sesame oil with a twist of lime.

This is one of the easiest and most delicious (and healthiest) meals in my regular rotation! Since I can't find the miso in my local grocery store I just buy the powdered miso soup mix on the ethnic aisle and it works great!

Wonderful. I used Escolar instead of Sea Bass, which took about 5 minutes longer to cook due to their thickness. But this was so fast, easy and delicious that I'll be making it as much as possible for a weeknight dinner. It's plenty nice enough for company too. Miso is so good on fish. I'll be looking for other similar uses.

My boyfriend had never tasted my cooking yet and he raved about my skills for days after this one! So easy and the fish gets moist and tender with the sauce browned on top. Perfect with asparagus and used the Butter Lettuce & Escarole with Pomegranate Seeds for a side salad.

Easy and tasty! I'm glad I checked on it before the 8 min were up as mine was done, not scorched but perfectly done. Very good - I used cod and had stir fry vegis with a mango chutney.

Very tasty, very easy. Like other reviewers, the top of the fish was a bit scorched, so I recommend cooking it more than 6 six inches from the broiler.

Great simple and tasty recipe - I make this all the time, minus the asparagus. For some reason I never seem to have asparagus in the house at the same time as Sea Bass.

Great recipe, but it came out very dry. Should add some olive oil in addition to moving away from broiler.

excellent, easy, just move fish a little further from broiler to avoid scorching top.

I used salmon instead of sea bass, and skipped the asparagus altogether. Great recipe. Very easy. My boyfriend said it had too much of a sweet tang to it, but I enjoyed the flavor very much.

This is so easy and simple, I think it will become a staple in our home. I didn't use white miso, as I didn't have it on hand, but it was still great.

This recipe was very good and extremely easy, the entire thing, including eating and cleanup, took around 45 minutes. However, I used turbinado sugar which may have been the reason the glaze burned on top of the fish for me. My fiancee, however, loved the burned bits, so I might just continue to make it that way. Definitely a very tasty and easy dinner, with the biggest challenge being finding the miso in the first place.
