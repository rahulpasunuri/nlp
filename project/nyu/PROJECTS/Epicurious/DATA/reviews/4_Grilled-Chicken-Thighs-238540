These were definitely good ... but not the best thing I have ever eaten in my life. A lot of flavor for a very short marinating time, but also a lot of sugar. Will probably make again.

I know that serving this fantastic chicken with jasmine saffron rice pilaf (peas, red pepper, onion, dried apricots, currants, toasted almonds) is sacrilegious, but it was tasty and perfect. Go multicultural. 25 min on the grill (bone in), 4 hours marinate with low salt soy. No leftovers.

Super easy and really flavorful for such a short marinade time. We did not use the sticky rice or Nori wrap-served with wild rice and salad and everyone loved. Repeater for sure.

So simple, yet really flavorful. Between the marinade (so short a time, great for last minute chefs!)and the flavor of thighs, chicken breasts have totally lost out!

Great recipe. Fast and easy; perfect weeknight supper. I did not wrap the thighs in nori; just served them as an entree with fresh green beans and a salad.

My guy is the pickiest ever. I mean he won't try anything he didn't like when he was 5. He tried this and loved it. I did it mostly by recipe, except I don't use a lot of fresh ginger. I used 1 TBS ground ginger and it was still great. Just make sure not to marinade more than the 15 mins or you will dry out.

I normally make this recipe with the chicken thighs, but tonight tried it with flanken ribs. Oh my goodness! So delicious! Toss everything in to marinate, make your rice up, toast your nori and by the time the rice is cooled, it's time to throw the ribs on the grill. I will absolutely be making this again (and again and again) Try it!

Easy easy easy. Instead of wrapping it in nori, I just grilled sliced peppers, squash and snow peas and served the chicken over that.I added a little chili oil to add a little heat too.

This recipe never quite makes it to the table. The kids start eating the chicken right off the grill. It's that good.

This is so simple and delicious to prepare. It is freezing outside, so I broiled the chicken thighs in the oven and sliced them up so that my kids could prepare the rice and nori wraps on their own. We added avocado, thinly sliced red peppers. It was an outstanding meal! Will make this over and over again.

delicious, easy...the brown sugar makes a glaze that seals the flavor. A keeper.

This was so simple, and so delicious! Usually I follow a recipe to the letter intially, and then follow suggestions at a later time... However, in this instance, I added a tablespoon of sesame oil, per the other reviews, and it was amazing! Fast, easy and delicious! Not everyone likes nori, but it adds so much to this recipe. I will make it again (and again and again and again). Added bonus - the kid LOVED it.

Good! I only had golden brown sugar and it was still good. Next time will add 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. Marinated for 20 minutes and it was perfect.

This recipe is quick and SO good! I was a bit amused by all of the reviewers who chose to marinate the thighs for HOURS and then said they were too salty. I followed the recipe and let the thighs marinate for 15 minutes and they were absolutely delicious!

I took the advice of someone else who reviewed this recipe and added a spoonful of sesame oil to the marinade...perfect! Also used low sodium soy sauce and marinated the chicken all day. I prepared 12 thighs and removed the skin from half so my guests could have their choice of skin on or off. I *loved* the smoky taste the charcoal grill gave the chicken and the leftovers tasted even better the next day. (Incidentally, I'd purchased bone-in thighs but knew they would take forever to cook so I found some 2 minute videos online on how to de-bone a thigh without massacring it and now I'm an expert!) Served with baby bok choy salad and cilantro rice.

Super easy, quite delish! The chicken does turn out somewhat salty because of the soy - maybe will use low sodium soy next time. Served with couscous & spinach.

I love this recipe - however, I up it a bit on the ginger and garlic. This is super easy and quick with bold flavors. It is definitely a family favorite!

This tasty recipe satisfies my asian palate for ginger and garlic. This grilled protein is well served with a light lager and a side of buttered sesame toast. Halving this recipe is perfect for two adult appetites. If you enjoy fruit sweetening, consider reducing the brown sugar and adding pineapple.

Great & easy marinade. My husband loved this and even my kids, 5 & 2, who don't often enjoy chicken ate every bite! I served the grilled chicken thighs alongside couscous & steamed veggies for a simple and fast meal. This will be made again!

easy and quick. I just barbequed thighs and wings with this marinade. Nice change

Super easy and delicious! Love the fact that it doesn't require hours to marinate. Didn't have wrappers or sticky rice. Served w/ plain basmati instead, sprinkled with a little fresh cilantro and lime juice.

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't have brown sugar, so substituted a tsp of mollasses and just under a third of a cup of sugar and like some others broiled it in the oven. Everyone loved it and we'll definitely make this one again. (I did the chicken only with a 3 veggies dishes to go with it.)

Great marinade. I added a chopped, seeded serrano pepper for some heat. Also, you should NEVER use the marinade as a sauce as raw chicken sat in it for 15 minutes or more.

Rating: 4
This is a quick, simple, & delicious marinade! I halved the recipe (since we only had 6 thighs to grill)--and added a heaping teaspoon of Sambal Oelek and a teaspoon of Kadoya Sesame Oil. Mmmm. Definitely making this again, and again, and again...

Wow was this ever good. An amazingly quick weekday meal. I didn't have any Nori Wrappers...but nobody noticed. I cooked the chicken on the stove in the marinade first and then transferred it to the grill for a few minutes so that the marinade could get sticky on it. Meanwhile I reduced the remaining marinade on the stove to use on the rice. Big hit with the family! Definitely will put this on the monthly meal planning roster!

The chicken was very good. The marinade was so good I chose, like others, to cook it on the stove and basically simmered the chicken in the sauce. Once cooked I chopped the thighs into strip and threw them in a bowl with the marinade they cooked in. I served this with brown sushi rice cooked with half coconut milk and water. We gave the nori wrappers a try, but found them extremely difficult to bite through so instead we just served the chicken over the rice. We will be making this again...very good and very easy!!!

One of our favorite meals! Ingredients and directions are perfect. Serve with "Asian Cucumber Ribbon Salad" Gourmet August '96, also from this site. Add chili garlic paste to the latter if you like spice.

This receipe is excellent! It does turn out very salty, next time I will use low-sodium soy sauce. I broiled the chicken along w/ all of the marinade in a glass dish. This turned the marinade into more of a sauce which i used to spoon over the white rice and sauteed spinach I served alonside the chicken.

This is my new favorite BBQ recipe. It's so simple, tastes so good, and my kids (2.5 years old) love it. That makes it an all-around winner.

Sublime flavor. We loved the recipe as written except didn't bother seasoning and toasting the nori.

This is a keeper. I broiled the thighs since I didn't want to deal with the grill and they still came out very tasty.I didn't bother with the Nori Wrappers, but did make some sticky rice. Very good and easy. I boiled the marinade and added some corn starch to thicken it for a sauce.

Put the search to find something for chicken thighs, and found a keeper!! the nori base, sushi rice, then grilled thighs were a great combo, especially for anyone who likes sushi, we served the wasabi on the side.

This is absolutely delicious! We make it all the time but use Braggs Liquid Amino instead of soy sauce.

I made this recipe top to bottom (thighs, nori, rice, eggplant, sweet & sour pickles) - it was a HIT! This is my go-to impress them lunch recipe. I tried them also without toasting the nori and found them equally great if you're looking to save a step. If you're using a grill pan be warned, the chicken and marinade give off a very strong smell when cooked inside, so be sure to shut the door if possible. The sweet and sour pickles were a real suprise, you have to try them.

Forget about the seaweed. This on top of white rice and steamed/poached bokchoy makes the best combination.

My husband decided to bone the thighs himself and now he knows why I buy them already done! We enjoyed this recipe. the flavor is excellent. We served it with the Grilled Eggplant from another menu, it has a garlic, green onion and sesame marinade that complemented the chicken marinade flavors. I loved the eggplant, but my husband wasn't wild about it.

Wonderful! We really enjoyed this recipe. I will be making this again for guests.

Very yummy! Another keeper. I used light soy sauce to cut down on sodium. Also, I used chicken thighs with skin-on as my son loves crispy chicken skin. I left the chicken in the marinade for about 8 hours--turning and massaging them every few hours. The thighs took longer than 5 minutes per side to cook through. But, it was worth the wait. The chicken was fantastic and went beautifully with sticky rice and nori and/or lettuce .

I did the chicken thighs with nori wrapper and sticky rice and did not like the dish together however I liked the chicken thighs on their own. Nice flavor.

Easy & delicious. Made half the marinade/w low sodium Tamari soy for 8 legs & it was perfect amount. Marinated about 5 hours, slowly grilled by master griller son. Absolutely delish hot & next day cold. Great for the lunch bag!

I should have grilled this, but instead put it in the oven and cooked the meat, it was not good. Perhaps if you placed the chicken on a broiler pan it would have been good, but beware not to cook it in a sheet pan.

I have been making this marinade for years, and it is my go to recipe. I have been adding about a tsp. of sambal to give it a little kick. I marinate about 6 hours.

Diifficult to grill. Boned thighs are very floppy. But once done, this is tasty.

Very good as well as quick and easy. I also marinated boneless skinless thighs over night with low sodium soy .

This is a very easy and delicious dish. I marinated it overnight and used boneless chicken breasts as well (which turned out very tender). I used low-sodium soy sauce so maybe that's why it wasn't too salty.

This is quick, easy and delicious. One caution - don't marinate the chicken more than 15 minutes. The first time I made this it was great, with a nice balance among all flavors in the marinade. But the second time I let it sit for about 30 minutes and the soy overwhelmed everything else. It was so salty we almost couldn't eat it - so watch the time and you'll be fine!

This was a very good marinade recipe. The only thing I did differently was add one tablespoon of sesmae oil. I also cooked the chicken under the broiler for about 6 mins each side (i flattened the thighs and put them on skewers). Family gobbled it up and claimed it to be a "do-over". Great weeknight dinner - it's ready in no time.
