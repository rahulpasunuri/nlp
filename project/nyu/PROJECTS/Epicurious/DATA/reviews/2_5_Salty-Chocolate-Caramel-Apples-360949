No part of the description or instructions say 'healthy.' Half the ingredients are not particularly healthy - it's not pretending to be something it clearly is not. What it clearly is is a yummy treat! If you want healthy then eat the apples and leave off the rest. Ta da.

Don't know what happened, but these were impossible to eat. Maybe the Kraft caramels I used weren't good, but they didn't want to melt at all, there wasn't enough to coat the apples, and when it dried, they were impossible to eat without risking serious dental injury.. Will not try this again.

These were really yummy. Easy to make with the kids as well. An occasional treat like this does no harm...and lets face it if we can't indulge in sweet stuff at halloween then when can we? It's a fun time, lighten up.

This dish is in no way healthy: 1. There is no sodium content listed, I know it is high with 30 pretzels in use in this recipe. 2. Over half of the fat is saturated. This is not healthy either. 3. This dish meets none of the FDA approved label claims. 4. Give us some real healthy dishes Epicurious.

My 4 year old loves these! Really easy and fun to make, and really yummy, too - what's not to like about sweet + salty + tart. Great alternative to nut-coated caramel apples for those kids with allergies.
