This turned out great. I used whole wheat fusilli, which worked well. I also used 2% milk and had no problems with that. I would probably double the mushrooms the next time around, to give it a more meaty taste. I also will use more bread crumbs (1/4 c more or so). But overall I was really happy with the way it turned out - my boyfriend and I both enjoyed it. Though I have to agree with others - the prep time can take a while - it took me over an hour to assemble this dish (before baking).

Delicious main course for a casual vegetarian dinner party. It's very versatile and forgiving--many different quantities and ingredients would work well. Prep work took a full 45 minutes, but baking was done in the promised 30 minutes. I doubled the recipe and made a pound of pasta (shells worked nicely in place of penne) to have enough for six (with lots of leftovers remaining). I needed a full-sized casserole as well as an 8x8 pan to fit all the pasta and veggies. I added squash per a previous recommendation, as well as artichoke hearts, onions, and some additional spices: black pepper, oregano, extra red pepper flakes (add lots! I'd also recommend doubling the garlic). I also subbed cinnamon for the nutmeg, which still added a delicious nutty, subtle flavor. Used regular tomato sauce in place of tomato paste. Also used standard shredded Italian cheese (which saved about $8)--it still tasted yummy. For a special occasion, I'd splurge on the real good stuff. All in all, my guests found it filling, flavorful, gooey, delicious, and it went really well with a light salad and white wine!

This is an easy, 4 fork recipe when you make the following changes: While penne is cooking, cook 1 lb of spicy Italian sausage in a large, oven proof pot (I used my new Le Cruset lime green dutch oven.) When the sausage is done, add ALL the remaining ingredients into the pot where you cooked the sausage, including the noodles. I used 1 large zucchini and 1 squash from the garden...it added a nice color to the dish. Be mindful of how much additional red pepper flakes you add...our Italian sausage was spicy enough that we omitted the flakes. Stir to mix everything completely. Add topping crumbs (with a few sprinkles of Parmesan cheese) to top and bake uncovered for 30 minutes at 400. This almost one pot dinner was very simple, quite tasty, and made for great leftovers the next day!

I am also confused by those who thought this was bland--be sure to use the fresh ingredients. The main reason this dish doesn't get 4 forks from me is the amount of work that went in to preparing the dish. perhaps next time I have leftover pasta i'll try it again. Or reserve the dish for entertaining so that I can simply stick it in the oven and not be stuck in the kitchen.

Like many other reviewers, I thought the recipe as published was quite bland. Changes I made include: more herbs (I added thyme and oregano), more tomato paste (to add more flavor to the sauce), hot Italian sausage (thanks for that tip!) and additional garlic. Next time I'll try adding some black olives as well. (And just as a picky side complaint: this may COOK in one pot, but it's not exactly an "easy clean up" dish as advertised on intro the web site - I had to use every dish in the house to make the pasta, sauce, veggies, topping, etc.)

This recipe has become one of my absolute favorite. It was a delicious vegetarian meal. Definately use the Fontina cheese and I would suggest baby portabella mushrooms. If you are serving more than 5 people and this is your main dish, you may want to double the recipe.

I thought this was great! I followed the recipe as written. It was cheesy (but not overly so), and nicely flavored with mushroom, garlic and just a touch of spice from the hot red pepper. The basil and nutmeg lend a nice, subtle touch. I honestly don't understand those that said it lacked flavor! But I guess it just proves we all have different tastes. Yes, I would make this again.

I made this recipe exactly the way it was written and LOVED it. I will make it again and again. I took it to a wine tasting party and everyone loved it as well. I don't understand how people can give a recipe a bad review if they modified the recipe somehow. That's not really making the recipe. I would recommend to those who did not like it and modified it, try making it the way it is written out and see if your taste buds like it. I will say this, it's not as good the next day, so eat it while it's fresh. Also if you don't know anything about Fontina cheese, it's about 10 dollars worth in this dish.

I used gruyere with a little parmesan, a sharper cheese would have been better. I agree 30 minutes was not enough time. I also used leftover spiral pasta. Prep was easy but it was on the bland side (yes I used the right amount of pasta) edible but nothing I'd make again.

I did more than called for, but used this recipe as a start for a half veg/half pasta creation. Followed sauce recipe, but 1/2 milk, 1/2 chicken broth. Thank- you comments! Used strong jack, 1/2 lb sauted Italian sausage, steamed about 1-2 cup broccoli & sliced carrots. Added w/zucchini & tomatoes. Used dried basil. Grated parm instead of crumbs. Prefer rigatoni. Thought I had dinner & at least one work lunch, but no leftovers! Next time, I am putting even more veggies in & doubling. Everyone loved it.

I have to wonder if the reviewers who found this dish to be bland and couldn't find a casserole large enough were aware that the recipe is for a half pound of pasta (1/2 box or 2 1/2 cups) not a pound. If your tastebuds are so desensitized that your idea of the perfect pasta dish is something drowned in tomato sauce and drifts of parmesan cheese, or a gooey cheddar cheese & macaroni dish a la Kraft, look elsewhere.

This was a good recipe but I would not make it with penne again. If made with ziti or angel hair perhaps, I would have given it 4 starts. The penne just didn't cut it, friends.

I wasn't sure about this recipe at first because of some of the other ratings, but I gave it a try anyway. It was really good and I would definitley make it again! I did modify the sauce: Added parmesean cheese, used a pre-made marinara sauce for more flavor. I also added green onions!

I enjoyed this dish. As always I made modifications... just used whatever cheese was in the house (mozzarella, cheddar and parm) and used some dried mushrooms instead of fresh... added a little chicken stock. Turned out very tasty and perfect for my toddler.

This recipe did not sound promising, but still gave it a go after reading the positive reviews. Used asiago, but still, very bland.

Delicious! It's wise to follow previous reviewers' suggestions about using a much bigger pan and a sharper cheese. I made mine in a 4-qt and used a sharp provolone with a little sharp white cheddar. Don't be afraid to use more cheese if you want. Also, I doubled the garlic and probably tripled the crushed red pepper flakes. It was VERY flavorful, despite what the previous reviewer said. I served it as a side dish with the Chicken Breasts with Oregano Garlic Butter, also from epi, along with toasted ciabatta and a salad, with brownies a la mode for dessert. I think that with extra cheese, this dish would make a great vegetarian entree as well.

In one word - bland. Moderately labour intensive prep work but definitely not worth it for the end result. Half an hour at 400 degress did not sufficiently cook the zucchini and tomatoes either. May be better with a sharper cheese such as asagio.

I did not like this recipe at all, it tasted awful.

First note, there is no way this fits into a 2 to 2 1/2 qt. dish. I couldn't fit it into a 3 qt dish. I used most of one big zucchini (a gift)rather than 2 mediums (which may have caused the problem with the pan size), added sausage instead of mushrooms, added onion, and used entire 6 oz. can of tomato paste. It was pretty tasty that way but I may cut back a little on the tomato paste next time since the sauce turned out a little TOO thick after baking. It's a great way to use up zucchini so I will make it again and my picky 6-year old was even willing to eat some! Good potluck dish.

Really enjoyed this dish. I added 2 scallions as recommended by one person. Also added a little more garlic and fontina. I made a little bit more sauce, 3 cups milk instead of 2 and added a little more tomatoe paste and nutmeg to balance. Simple dish but kinda elegant. This will be made often as my husband really loves it.

Made a half recipe for dinner for two tonight. I used plum tomatoes and dried basil in place of fresh, used less butter and 1% milk, but other than that followed the recipe. So tasty. Wonderful depth and variety of flavors. Use good quality tomatoes, and definitely use mushrooms. I was surprised by the pronounced basil flavor, considering I used dried. Ate with apples. Mmm.

I also thought this dish lacked a little flavor. I might add shallot or some spice to the sauce next time to give it some depth. But my family loved it and it was a great make-ahead dinner for a Sunday night gathering.

A classic. This is a great dish for entertaining especially for vegetarian guests. I added ground turkey to it once and it was even more delish.

My husband & I both really liked this dish. I found it to be relatively fast & easy to make, with just the right amount of sauce. Next time I make it, though, I'll start the sauce first & prepare the rest while it's simmering.

I thought this dish lacked flavor and enough sauce to suit my taste. I will not make this dish again because it was so time consuming to make and to clean up. Who ever created this recipe must have a prep staff and a cleaning staff.

I made this dish in the morning, and then baked it with the topping at dinner time. I will use artichoke hearts instead of zucchini as a preference. My guests RAVED!

Although the dish did come out quite yummy, I thought it was an awful lot of work, especially for a week night. I don't feel that the end results are worth the effort.

a quick, delicious, low fat , vegatarian dish. what more could you ask. even though i always try to follow recipe exactly the 1st time i did follow Vicki's advice and used asiago as I couldn't get good fontina either. I find asiago to be much more flavorful than most fontinas i can get here

This is a nice way to serve fresh tomatoes and zuchini. I used my plum tomatoes and they cooked up nicely. I used the hint below, and made it without mushroom and crumb crust - mostly to make it even quicker.

I loved this dish! It was so easy to make, but it tasted like something that would take a long time to make. I did alter the recipe a little, however, by skipping the mushrooms (I'm not a big fan!) and using water instead of milk. I just thickened it a little more with flour. Honestly, I don't think it made a bit of difference. It still tasted delicious!!

This is simple and delicious. In my view, it's worth using the mushrooms as it adds a "meaty" texture which is a plus for those of us who are rather reluctant vegetarians! I used asiago as I couldn't get fontina and it was still good. Next time I would increase the cheese by a quarter cup and add a touch more pepper flakes. My lot devoured this one.

Grown-up macaroni and cheese. Easy and delicious. The addition of tomato paste and nutmeg in the sauce adds a unique flavor note. I usually make it without mushrooms and skip the breadcrumb topping.
