Made it exactly as recipe states except was a little more generous with the cheese. Took it to work and also made it at home served with a salad. Big hit with everyone!! Very flavorful.

This is a great recipe. I will definitely be making this again, especially for vegetarian friends and relatives. My experience was that the puff pastry sheet shrunk a bit, so next time I will try building up the edges so that they extend up a little higher than the tart pan before baking the shell. This may have been why some reviewers had trouble getting all the filling in.

I've made this maybe 50 times since the original publication. Made several of my own inclusions and changes over the years and really love the product it has evolved into. My favorite change is to use phyllo instead of frozen puff pastry.

I forgot the onions! But it was delicious anyway. I made and blind baked my own short crust pastry shell, I used my standard tart tin and had no problems with too much fillig,it was just perfect. I was worried that the zucchini would not cook through but it came out just fine, will definitely be keeping this recipe.

I have made this recipe at least 20 times since it was published- as written except for using skim milk mozzarella and no fat half and half! I drain the sun-dried tomatoes. I have made it with the puff pastry shell in a ceramic tart pan and spray the bottom of the pan and don't have any problem getting it out. Also haven't had any leakage from the egg. It's always a huge hit- I made it for a bridal shower a few weeks ago and guests asked for the recipe. This last time, I made it the night before and then reheated it, covered with foil, at 300 for ~ 30 minutes. Cut into 12 wedges. It's a lovely summer dish served with a nice salad and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.

I was looking for a creative ways to use eggs and this was yummy. I added some ham for my meat eating kids and used frozen pastry shells for ease. The filling filled 2 pastry shells and the leftovers were gone in 1 day. We all loved it!

This was pretty good and I got some compliments at a small party. The recipe makes twice as much filling as I needed, but I ended up using a normal pie plate since I didn't have a tart pan. My grocer was out of fresh basil, but it's absence didn't ruin the recipe. Very flavorful tart.

Have made this dozens of times, I always make 2 tarts, cut them into 1 1/2-2 inch squares, freeze, and reheat before serving. A huge hit vis-a-vis taste and presentation.

This was very tasty, but I think I would only serve it as a brunch item. I couldn't make all the ingredients fit into the shell, but that was ok.

Served this with the mixed fruit compote from this site for a fabulous church-lady lunch. Using the frozen puff pastry is the way to go! And, even after 35 min, the tart didnt seem totally set so turned off the oven and let it sit another 5min or so. Served it at room temp to rave reviews.

I will (absolutely) be making this dish again! The flavors of the sun-dried tomato and basil were outstanding. I didn't have mozzarella on hand but instead used grated romano. The crust was soggy (I'm not sure I would use the puff pastry next time) but other than that it was a huge hit!!

I made this recipe for a buffet-style dinner party. This dish was gone within five minutes! I had only chosen it for the vegetarian that would be attending but it was an instant hit with everyone.

So tasty! I omitted the oregano to prevent it from tasting like pizza. Pillsbury pie crust (refrigerated) worked well, although mine was a little soggy. Perhaps I should have chilled it better.

This recipe was very easy to prepare and tasted amazing. I served it buffet style at a dinner party and it was gone in no time! The pastry was a bit difficult to work with but with a little practice it might get easier.

I have made this recipe many times since I first rated it. I tried the cresent rolls and really didn't like the taste. Treat yourselves to puff pastry, (not phyllo) but put something underneath to catch the egg that drips from the tart pan. Also treat yourselves and add small, raw shrimp on top before cooking....really good.

Rating: 0
sounds interesting, but to those who used the phyllo dough, did you pre-bake. How about using the refrigerated Pillsbury pie crusts for quick and easy. Roma tomatoes also do not juice and cook well in quiche, etc. K

Made this for a 4th of July picnic and it was great but definitely time consuming and I wouldn't put it in the super-easy category. I used the recommended puff pastry crust and it was definitely tasty but not required. I'll substitute another pastry next time (maybe even frozen). It got soggy pretty fast and I needed to make ahead. Worked well to "unmold" from tart pan, refrigerate and re-heat to crispy in oven just before leaving for party.

We really liked this tart. I used the cresent rolls, but did not like the flavor. Next time I will use my own crust recipe. Made it as is written, but added raw shrimp before cooking. A W E S O M E!!! A definite keeper!!!

Rating: 3
This had great flavor. I used the crescent rolls as suggested, and didn't like that -- too thick and salty. I also didn't have a tart pan available, so I used a regular pie plate. Next time I make this, I will just make it like a regular quiche and use a pie crust.

Rating: 3
This tart is very nice. I have made it several times, the first time for a party of 40. Always gets rave reviews. I substitute a couple cloves garlic for the onion, since I am not an onion lover. Also have used dried oregano. One annoyance is that the prick holes in the baked pastry have leaked egg all over the bottom of my oven before I could get a drip pan in place. The cheese must melt to seal the prick holes, so add when the pastry is hot. I haven't noticed any bad flavor with the tomatoes. I buy the julienned strips at Trader Joe's and strain them before adding. Great flavor.

Rating: 4
I also used refrigerated crescent rolls for the crust...much easier and great result. Also used low fat cheese and non-fat half and half so this was wonderfully tasty and creamy with little guilt!! I would imagine that one could use other types of seasonal vegetables, or ham etc. in different combo's.

This was so good and easy. I used the Pillsbury crescent roll dough, as other suggested, and that worked nicely, although it doesn't look very attractive. Mine baked 30 minutes and it was done. I'll make this again for sure.

I loved this tart. I omitted the salt due to previous reviews. Otherwise followed recipe as written. Great for my brunch bunch get togethers. They enjoy having a no meat choice. Next time will watch my puff pastry a little closer. It was a little brown for my liking. Great tart recipe. Thumbs up!

I read the previous notes, concerning the sodium content of the tomatos. I found another brand at the store, much less in sodium. The tart was wonderful!!!! please try & enjoy

What happened to my review

Rating: 3
Made this for a 4th of July party and it was a hit. Because I was baking ahead, I removed from the tart pan and refrigerated until time to serve and then crisped it up again in a hot (450 oven) for several minutes. No other changes - it's great as written. May try with alternate crusts, but it is hard to beat puff pastry

I made this for Mother's day brunch. Everyone loved it. I have made it several times. I added asperagus and decreased the parmesan cheese by half.

Excellent. When I took it out of the pan, our guests said it looked like something out of a magazine.

I thought this dish was really good. I used phyllo instead of puff pastry (make sure to butter each layer). Also, sub'd low-fat chicken stock instead of milk which turned out well. Also, used 1/2 sundried tomatoes in oil, and 1/2 chopped tomatoes - cut down on oily taste. Also, used a bit of fresh mint in there too which added a unique taste. Served with a big huge salad - great light dinner.

Rating: 4
Excellent! But I would recommend making it in a pie dish in case the liquid flows from underneath the tart pan. Plus, with a deeper dish, I could add more zucchini.

Rating: 3
Good, with even more potential. I made as indicated except omitted the salt, as all the cheese and tomatoes seemed salty enough. I didn't really like the "pizza" taste from the oil-packed sundried tomatoes, though. Next time I may try reconstituting plain dried tomatoes, or oven drying some of my own till they're chewy but not completely dry. I think it will be a better complement to the delicate mozzarella.

After all of the fabulous reviews, I was somewhat disapppointed in this recipe. I felt the basil was overpowering, and the other flavors didn't come through enough. The whole dish needs to be more delicate and elegant. In defense of the recipe, however, I used phyllo dough sheets (rather than puff pastry dough) but didn't layer and butter each of the sheets as should be done to make it truly a pff pastry. Having used Pillsbury Crescent dough in the past for other things, I believe that other reviewers' suggestions to use it for the dough is a very good one, as it will achieve that wonderful flaky and light crust. I also used frozen basil from my garden last summer, and it was very finely chopped, rather than sliced. That may explain why I felt the basil was overpowering. I will try this again, being more careful. The recipe certainly has potential!

What a surprise of flavors!!! Made this for a brunch and it went fast!! I agree that if you make your own crust PLAN AHEAD as it takes time. I am going to try the cresent roll suggestion to "speed up" the process and see if the results are as good. Re: sun-dried tomatoes. Used a variety not pack in oil...added my own olive oil to moisten and did not have problems with being too "salty".

Rating: 2
It was very salty. I will try it again with a less salty brand of sun dried tomatoes.

This was fabulous and extremely easy if you cheat like I did! Instead of making crust, I bought frozen pie crust and used it instead. Absolutely delicious!

OK i tried this again, after having the soggy crust thing the first time. this time i followed the directions closely. it turned out perfect. it wasn't goopy and i was able to cut solid pieces. it also happened to be delicious. only difference was that i did not have any fresh basil but happened to have fresh mint AND fresh flat-leaf parsley to use up. so i used those instead. the mint was interesting in a good way. glad i was able to make this recipe work.

I'm the cook from SF who submitted a review of this recipe and forgot to mention that when using Pillsbury crescent rolls for the crust, you don't prebake it. Just line the pan with the uncooked dough, put the filling in and bake.

Rating: 3
This was very good and I will definitely make it again. The cook who said to put a cookie sheet under it gave good advice. I took a major short cut on the crust and used Pillbury crescent roll dough. Just separate them and lay them down in the pan like pie dough. Guests raved about how beautiful it looked and swooned about the flavor. I used a spring form pan because that's what I had.

Am i the only person who ended up with a soggy crust? Is that a result of not freezing it for 1 hour? This tasted delicious, but was very wet. I was going to try it again with pie crust dough instead, but i almost want to try it again as-is because it turned out well for so many people. any suggestions would be appreciated.

This recipe was a hit at my dinner party. I used fresh mozzerella that came in a shrink wrapped package. It did not grate very well, but added a nice velvety texture. I am planning on making it for a baby shower in a couple of weeks.

I didn't have the time needed for puff pastry...last minute party...so I made the dish using phyllo dough instead...absolutely heavenly.

This is really delicious...my husband loved it. This tart tastes like a cross between quiche and pizza. Just a few suggestions: I didn't add any salt because the sundried tomatoes and cheese are salty enough. And make sure the dough comes all the way up the side of the pan, I had some of the egg/half and half mixture spill over. I also suggest putting a baking sheet under this while it cooks to avoid it spilling all over your oven. Will definitely make this again.
