They were just okay. The taste of the sour cherries didn't meld in well with the chocolate, which was surprising. There was nothing in this that recipe that made it stand out.

Very disappointing-- just 'ok' after a lot of work. Cupcakes out of a box are better. these were kind of dry.

Dried cherries are like gold here, about USD 80 per kilo! I used chopped glace orenge peel with grand marnier as the liqueur and the cakes were a big hit as well as being terribly easy. I double the recipe as seconds seem to be required!

Excellent! Very rich, with good chocolate flavour. I doubled the recipe and made 6 mini-bundts, which were almost too big for us to finish!

I made this for a special dinner last night, and i thought they were good, but not anything great. I followed the recipe exactly, but added an extra 3-4 minutes to the baking time. I served them with little scoops of Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia ice cream and I thought that it added a nice touch.

Boy, did I get raves over this recipe!! I doubled the recipe as I needed 8 small bundt cakes. However, they did not make a full cake. Also, I baked 4 at-a-time, and the second batch came out a bit flatter than the first batch. Next time, I will double the recipe and only bake six.

This is awesome. I baked them in mini bundt cake pans and the batter only made 4 but they were wonderful. I baked them for 25 minutes since the bundt pans are larger than muffin pans. I used Chambord and the taste was incredible. The cherry flavoring blended so well with the chocolate and it was not too sweet at all. The texture was fudgy just the way I love my almost flourless cakes. You must make this for guests. I wanted to make a ganache - but was glad I did not - since it would have been too sweet and taken away from the taste of the cakes. The powdered sugar on top is just right.

It is often difficult to get cherries here in Australia, so I substituted dried cranberries soaked in grand marnier and the cakes were still sublime.

My husband has been making these rich little chocolate cakes for my February birthday ever since this recipe was published in a 1996 Gourmet--our first year together. These are cakes, not muffins, and are absolutely wonderful! Definitely use sour cherries, not maraschino. He has used both dried and canned. If using canned, you can substitute the liquid for the liqueur. They are great both ways. I wish the picture of these cakes were on the web site because they are just adorable with the powdered sugar sprinkled in the heart pattern. If you love chocolate and are looking for a romantic dessert, definitely try this recipe!

I was just looking for a recipe to use up some marachino cherries I had. So, other than skipping the first two ingredients instructions part, I followed the recipe exactly. I have to say, these muffins were moist and delicious. For some reason though, my oven needed 30 minutes, not 20. Do definitely try this recipe. I must say, I was surprised that there was no baking powder or soda, but it didn't seem to matter. It looks like there is way to much for 6 muffins - but fill those tins almost to the over flowing point, and you'll get great muffin tops and good muffins.
