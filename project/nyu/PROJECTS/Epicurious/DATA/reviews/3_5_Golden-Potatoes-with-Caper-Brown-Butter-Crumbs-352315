Had this for Easter dinner. I misread the receipe and parboiled the potatoes a day ahead. When I realized this, I drained the parbolied potatoes very well, tossed then with the caper butter and put them in a large roasting pan, refrigerated overnight then into the oven for about 20 minutes, turned the potatoes and sprinkled on bread crumbs, and a squirt of lemon juice. roasted about 15 minutes more on speed bake.

Made for Easter dinner, simple. Par boiled early in afternoon and roasted after roast came out of oven, right before serving. All potatoes disappeared. Requested for the recipe and now expected to make again!

Good but not great. Maybe using red and yellow potatoes and smaller more fingerling size would help but OK

Terrible let down. This was bland, bland. Couldn't taste the capers at all. The bread crumbs were tasteless. All of this detracted from the wonderful flavor of the Yukon Golds.

Thought this was great and pretty simple. Went with about 3/4 stick of SALTED butter. Found the chopping of the capers odd when making the recipe, but thought it really helped to distribute the flavor. Even with the salted butter and capers, this still required salt and pepper...wonder if that's where the review about lacking flavor came from.

Oh, my gosh. Served these with the Pork Tenderloin with CHerry Chutney from this site and it was perfect. I agree that the capers dont need to be chopped and I drizzled the butter over the bread crumbs once I scattered them on the potatoes. Loved that I could par-boil them hours before the meal. I also made the butter the day before and kept in frig-just nuked for a few seconds and it was great. There were no leftovers for us!

An incredibly easy recipe to make - the butter took a little longer than the 5 minutes that the recipe indicated, but in my opinion better safe than sorry. I think I accidentally cooked the potatoes a little too long - they fell apart when I transferred them to the hot sheet pan - but it certainly didn't affect their taste! I would definitely make this again, keeping a closer eye on the potatoes to get a firmer bite out of them.

Cook from the MidWest must have been having a really bad day on 3/29. I never peel potatoes anymore anyway added more capers as we all like them. Have made additions each time I've made and quests and family keep wanting more. Have given this recipe to several people and have now enjoyed 2 of their versions as well.

cbmalm from Boston again: forgot to mention: used 1/2 stick of butter, rather than whole stick. Thought that chopping capers made no sense, so I didn't.

Fabulous - this is a keeper. My notes: Used small yukon gold spuds... (had roasted them whole for a prior dinner and had some left over.) Sliced potatoes into coins, skin on. Used Pastene Italian flavored bread crumbs (what I had on hand...) convection-baked for 20 min. Awesome.

Thanks for the warning, mid-west cook. I read it in advance of making this recipe, and I made some changes that I'll share. The outcome was a huge hit, and I'll continue serving this. 1) Don't bother peeling the potatoes. Organic potatoes, washed and sliced. For aesthetics, consider mixing small red and yellow potatoes. This will also bring an extra sweetness to the flavor. 2) Use a more generous helping of salt when boiling the potatoes. The teaspoon is a rule of thumb to keep the water boil consistent. A tablespoon will flavor the potatoes while boiling. 3) Fewer breadcrumbs. Just a sprinkling, really, when you put them in the oven. They're not adding flavor here, just consistency and additional crispness that we resolved during baking. (see below) 4) Twice the amount of capers (at least). We found the very idea of chopping them unnecessary. 5) If you still find this bland, consider salted butter or seasoning prior to baking. We tossed the caper butter with the potatoes. The whole thing. Don't toss any of it with the bread crumbs. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs onto the potatoes before baking. Spreading the potatoes onto a flat baking sheet (rather than a four-sided cake pan) will eliminate the need to stir intermittently while baking. When complete, transfer the potatoes to a serving bowl in layers. Each potatoe will have a cripness and the breadcrumbs will be evenly distributed. Hope this helps.

Given the labor involved in peeling the potatoes, the added fat and calories contributed by the entire stick of butter, and the blandness of the flavor, I will not be making this recipe again. I used a good quality butter (Cabot Creamery) and was astonished at the lack of flavor in the completed dish. Perhaps double the capers and use even more butter? To use leftovers, rewarm in oven and top with a poached egg.
