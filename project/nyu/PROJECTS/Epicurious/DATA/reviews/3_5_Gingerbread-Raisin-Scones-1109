This was a very yummy recipe and I have no reservations about giving these out to my friends this Christmas. I did have to add an extra 1/4 milk because the dough was dry. I also took some other reviewers' advice and doubled the spices and omitted the raisins in favour of crystallized ginger. To make them more festive, I dipped the tops in milk and then dipped them in fine sugar before baking. It gave them a beautiful "snowy" topping. These are definitely worth keeping in the holiday baking rotation!

I have made these scones for Christmas Day since the recipe was released. Although my family has always loved the, I found them a little dry. After reading the other reviews, I added some plain yogurt to the scones this year and it made all the difference. I also find that they don't need 25 minutes in the oven - 20 minutes is plenty.

These were good with raisins, but when I omitted them and added finely diced candied ginger, they absolutely came ALIVE. I will never make them with raisins again.

These were very good. I made them without the raisins.

I liked the flavor but not the texture. I only cooked them for 15 minutes, but they were still dry and more "cakey" than I would like for a scone recipe. It is possible they would be better with a shorter baking time, but I have other scone recipes that I would go to first (Epicurious's Cranberry-Orange Scone recipe is amazing!!)

It is a little dry, so I added another half an egg and they turned out very yummy!

I made these yesterday, but I was dissappointed to find them a little on the dry side. The flavor very good though, and looking at the other reviews I wonder if I might have done something to account for their dryness. Any ideas?

Absolutely delicious! I omitted the raisins and made a powdered sugar glaze to drizzle on the scones. Made them several days before Christmas, wrapped tightly, and froze until Christmas Eve. Warmed in the oven in the morning and they were a big hit.

I've made these three times in the past two months, and I'm giving them as gifts this xmas. I almost double the spices and cut them out into 3" rounds that fit nicely into tins. It may be my oven but 25 minutes is far too long; I rotate racks at 10 minutes, then they are usually done 5 minutes later.

Yummy. I've made this twice so far. Once as written which was good. The second time I doubled the spices and raisins (using half golden) and they were delicious. I also dropped the batter in mounds on the baking sheet and prefered the results over the wedges (plus its easier).

Tasty scones! I was out of ground ginger so I used some finely chopped candied ginger - it worked nicely. I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour, I enjoy the heartier taste of it and they weren't too heavy.

If anyone wants to know what happens if you accidently add 3/4 cup milk instead of 1/4, read on... I was in a tizzy over what to do when I realized I didn't have a dough to roll out. I put my bad luck down to the high heat and humidity of the summer. (I realized my mistake about 1/2 hour later.) I just put it in a loaf pan and baked for 25 minutes on Gas Mark 5 (as prescribed) and then turned it down to about Gas Mark 3 1/2 and baked another 25 minutes. It turned out absolutely perfect! Really moist. Will serve it for the mothers at baby group tomorrow. I can't believe my luck. Does anyone know why it worked?

This is by far my favourite recipe and the most frequently requested breakfast dish of my 7 year old son. Tender, moist, delicious!

I frequently make these scones for brunch, gifts, or just when it's cold and dreary outside and I wand something special. I hate raisins, so instead, I subtitute either dried cranberries or chopped dried cherries, which add a nice tanginess. Once I've made them for someone, I almost always get a request for the recipe.

Delicious! Love the ginger and cinnamon -- Pat the dough into circles and cut with a cookie cutter -- neater and looks better than wedges.

THe only reason I didn't give this 4 forks is because I thought it was a little light on the spices. I would definitely use a lot more ginger next time. But the texture was fantastic! So many scone recipes come out dry and hard, but these were soft and wonderful.

I make this every year for Christmas gift giving (I make a bunch of different scones, wrap two of each in plastic wrap and foil and tuck them into a bag with jelly/jam, tea, and the recipes - ALWAYS a big hit!) Everyone LOVES these and they freeze incredibly well. I shape it into a large circle, cut it into wedges with a pizza cutter and bake on a baking stone. Perfect, and an absoltely HEAVENLY smell!

These are very tasty--just keep an eye on them so they don't dry out. I like to make 2 circles and cut each into 6 wedges. My husband, who isn't a fan of scones loves these!

My spices for this recipe - 1 heaping tsp. cinnamon, 1 heaping tsp. ginger, 1/2 tsp. ground cloves. As I only had 1/3 cup golden raisins, I added 1/3 cup currants, which really came out well. Also took the advice of one reviewer and brushed tops with water and sprinkled with cinnamon-sugar prior to cutting and baking. Awesome, awesome scone recipe. It will be a great holiday addition to my snack table.

I added extra spice and left out the raisins, but next time I will double the spice. The dough is beautiful; soft, but not sticky. Another way to make these is to divide the dough into halves until you have eight pieces, then shape them into balls. Instead of brushing with milk, then sprinkling with sugar, I just pressed the tops in a small bowl of sugar. When the scones bake, the tops get all cracked and crinkled like a ginger snap! Very pretty. Lemon curd and whipped cream goes very well with this.

These smelled great in the making and baking process...I'd give it a 2+, they were very good but the gingerbread taste was much lighter than I would like. I left out the raisins, and would make it again- hiking up the spice levels.

Currently my favorite scone recipe! Dark, soft, and delicious, especially with a glass of milk. I brushed the top with water and sprinkled it with sugar, which added an extra sparkle. Yum!
