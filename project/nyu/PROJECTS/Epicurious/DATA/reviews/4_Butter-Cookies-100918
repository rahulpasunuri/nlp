This recipe was extremely easy to make and totally delicious. It's everything a butter cookie should be- light, flaky, melt-in-your-mouth and lends itself to variations. I used a cookie press and made adorable flower shaped cookies with a chocolate chip right in the middle. YUM and pretty!

Where did I go wrong? Followed the instructions to a t and even after chilling overnight was left with totally unworkable dough that was rock-hard. I added about a cup of flour to each HALF to be able to roll it out somewhat. Big fat FAIL.

This is a great basic recipe. The number of cookies was way less than 100 so I don't recommend doing a 1/2 serving. I also recommend using real butter for that extra creamy flavor, and maybe add something else like lemon for more flavor.

the only change i made to this recipe was to sprinkle colored sugar on before baking. my kids loved it! the dough was a little sticky, even after keeping in the fridge over night. and i must have sliced my cookies a little too think b/c i definitely did not make 100 cookies. i am making them again, but this time i am doubling the recipe!

These are my favourite cookies. I bake them all the time and they're my staple. I add a bit of lemon zest and lemon juice sometimes for a bit of kick. And you can add cinnamon and nutmeg when it comes to holiday time for a more festive mix.

I ALSO COOK MINE AT 350. I REMOVE THEM WHEN I SEE BARELY BROWN EDGES. THEY ARE THE BEST, MOST TENDER COOKIES EVER. BE SURE TO CREAM THE BUTTER A LONG TIME UNTIL VERY VERY FLUFFY AND ALL THE SUGAR IS DISSOLVED. I MADE JAM THUMB PRINT COOKIES WITH THEM...WONDERFUL. ALSO MIXED IN SWEETENED COCONUT AND TOASTED ALMOND SLIVERS...THEY WERE AWESOME!

great popular recipe - but I have to cook mine at 350 degrees instead of 375 to keep them from burning.

These are great. If you've tried Walkers biscuits, these are very very similar - and they're totally yum, and easy to make too! I cut them a bit thicker - almost a centimeter (2/5 inch) and they came out great.

These are the best butter cookies I have ever made. I use them for my chocolate chip cookies, I added a couple of cups of chopped dark orange chocolate, and made them generously sized- they were a HIT!!! Everyone loved them, and asks what I did to make them so good!

I pressed these cookies into high quality, crystal, multi-colored sprinkles. They turned out beautiful! I gave them as gifts and the recipients loved them!

Easy recipe with excellent results. I used my cookie press and and made the cookies flower shapes for Easter; put a dark chocolate pastel M&M in each center. They were adorable and delicious. For a cookie press the dough must be room temperature, and I recommend using parchment paper on the cookie sheet, which made removing & cooling the cookies quick & easy. No spatula needed. A definite winner!

Great recipe. Made them several time and they're always great - even when I used the wrong measuring cup and shorted the sugar by a quarter cup! I drizzled Wilton's colored white chocolate of various colors (red for Valentines, red and green for Christmas) which made them look fancy too. My little boys ask for these all the time!

delicious as written. I added zest from one small orange and it was delicious as well - without frosting.

This is a terrific recipe! I roll it out with plenty of flour handy and use cookie cutters. I've made these cookies again and again due to popular demand. Caution: they disappear fast!

This made a wonderful cookie! It's light and melts in your mouth, a wonderful base dough to add different ingredients. This will be my "go to" butter cookie from now on. :)

I have made these cookies several times now and every time, they were gone pretty quickly. I learned that chilling the dough overnight works pretty well, you just have to remember to take the dough out a little earlier before baking. I dip half of a cookie in bittersweet chocolate and let it dry before I pack them away in my cookie jar. I have also used icing on a batch I made this past X-mas. These are the best butter cookies ever.

I know I can always come to Epicurious for the best recipes--even the basics! They are so delicate and delicious when sliced thin as directed, but I knew they wouldn't travel well, so I made the second batch about 1/4 inch thick.

Luscious cookie but seemed a little undressed so....we made them 3/16" thick and nestled a small chunk of good semi-sweet chocolate, like Ghirardelli, in the center of each before baking. Indescribably delicious!

Excellent! Double the recipe and make 1/4 inch thick cookies. The thicker the better~ Yum!

I am a personal chef, and I made this recipe for my mother's annual holiday gala. She wanted something a little richer, so I substituted three tablespoons of whipped cream cheese for three tablespoons of the butter, and I added a half a teaspoon butter extract for a richer flavor. These cookies really came out amazingly well, with or withour the substitutions. They also lend their flavor perfectly to royal icing; plain, almond, or lemon-flavored!

Great recipe - yummy! Easy to make, using on-hand ingredients (even in my not-so-well-stocked pantry). I had a little difficulty forming the logs because the dough was very sticky, even after I chilled it, so my cookies were a little misshapen, but no one seemed to mind! I would suggest slicing the logs a little thicker, though - 1/8" is really thin.

I made these cookies yesterday and they were not only super easy, but delicious as well. I also used organic ingredients so my 15month old could enjoy them and they came out just great. I would make these again in a heartbeat they are also perfect for the novice baker.

Wow - great cookie dough. I rolled them into spheres and baked. Then dipped top in dark chocolate when cool. Would make a perfect, holiday cookie.

The best. Before baking, make a thumb print and fill it will a tiny bit of jam.

I make these cookies when my kids need to take a baked item to school.The kids and I like them because they are thin, buttery, and crispy.Use plastic wrap to roll and chill.It is a lot easier to work with than parchment.

These were good...even though I did have to make a few changes. I skipped the whole log thing, chilled the dough for a few hours in the fridge, and then rolled them and flattened them with a sugar-dipped glass (it was somewhat messy because the dough warms VERY quickly). They were tasty, especially when I added some spices to the sugar for the last two dozen. I was one cookie shy of 7 dozen by the time I finished, so a good yield for a pretty decent recipe. Now I just have to keep the cookies away from the boys so I can give them as gifts!

Simply the best. Takes me back to my childhood back East and a wonderful german bakery. YUMMMM. A flavor reminiscent of years gone by.

I disagree! After reading the glowing reviews, I had to try these cookies. But they're very cakey and don't have enough sugar (maybe that's why people add jam or icing). Not good.

Rating: 4
These were delicious, even with a few modifications: Almond extract instead of vanilla, salted butter instead of unsalted. To compensate, I reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp. Baked for 8 minutes. Tender, flaky, and delicious. This will replace the 55 year old Betty Crocker sugar cookie recipe I have been using....

Great recipe!! I made Easter cutout cookies with it. Then my little girl frosted them with a 10xsugar/butter frosting. I like them plain but the kids thought they were wonderful both ways.

Absolutely fabulous! Everyone loves them!! My mom asked me for the recipe. Great with sprinkles, dabs of jam, iced with lemon icing... and GREAT just as they are.

A huge hit at Thanksgiving. These are truly the ultimate butter cookie, and they are so easy. I made a small indentation in the centers and added a quarter of a teaspoon of raspberry jam. Both the cookies and the dough freeze well.

This is a good butter cookie recipe but it only made about 36 cookies to a batch (recipe says it makes about 100 cookies).

Fabulous cookies. The second time I served them I made them several hrs early and they got soagy (damp climate). Next time I baked them just befor serving. They were crisp and delicious. I freeze dough in small batches and bake as above. Especially good with sorbet.

This recipe has been a total success with family and friends. My young kids help and have a wonderful time by coloring the cookies with food coloring. Their very special designs and drawings make these cookies a wonderful "personal" gift.

If you are comparing other butter cookie recipies, look no further. I had the ingredients for shortbread and decided to try butter cookies instead. I won't bother with shortbread anymore. I agree with one of the other reviewers, be mindful of the cooking time. It may be my oven, but there seems to be a very short time period between done and overdone.

Really very easy and delicious. Great for novice bakers, and a good recipe to expand upon. I have four bricks of this dough in my freezer right now. And if you haven't guessed, it's a great make-ahead recipe. Wonderful.

These were delicious. I made mine for a July 4th picnic. I separated the dough into 3 parts. With food dye,colored one part blue, one part red. I rolled rectangular strips of red and no color dough, and stacked, alternaing colors. I then rolled a long blue rectangle and placed in upper left corner. Trimed entire dough to a perfect rectangle, wrapped and placed in fridge. Sliced and baked the next day. Voila! little flags. Better when fresh out of oven with lots of milk. Did manage to restrain myself and saved some for guests. They were a hit. Gave recipe to one guest that day.

Once the batter is made I dropped them by rounded tablespoons, make a thumbprint and add raspberry jam. Bake exactly 12 minutes at 375. They are soft and buttery with the slight tartness of the jam. The best cookie in the world. I have also added grated lemon peel to the batter and poppy seed for a variety and topped with a lemon glaze.

A very nice rich, buttery flavor although they seemed a bit thin. I would experiment with the baking powder a bit. If you crave that simple sweet taste of a classic cookie, this is it.

the recipe is great have a really delicious flavor.because the dough is too soft with 2 cups of flour im add just a little bit ( like 1/4 cup) then im frozen about 2-4 hours.instead bake in 375 im baked in 380. sprinkle a little bit of sugar before bake.taste great.its a hit.

Based on previous reviews, I also baked only 8 minutes. They were exactly what I was looking for - slightly chewy & buttery. These were not cakey at all. Very close in taste to bakery cookies!

This recipe worked out great! I rolled out the dough and used cookie cutters to make Christmas cookies. I used organic ingredients so my 13 month old could have some and she loved them. Roll the dough out very thin and you get many many cookies. They are lovely with tea. I'll keep some for guest at Christmas.

The cookies themselves were just too bready for me. If I wanted cake, I would have made cake. The process was messy and just seemed like it was more trouble than it was worth.

These cookies turned out delicious. They are very thin and fragile (if you make about 100 of them), but they are wonderfully crispy and flavorful. My kids liked putting sprinkles on them before cooking, and I must say that it is much easier to make cookies this way rather than rolling out dough, cutting into shapes and then putting sprinkles on.
