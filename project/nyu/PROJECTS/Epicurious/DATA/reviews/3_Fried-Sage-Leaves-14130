I fry leaves in about 1 tbsp coconut oil, stirring throughout. Leaves end up crispy; I crumble them over pears with blue cheese (Epi recipe). Fantastic.

We can never serve these to guests as we just eat them as they come out of the skillet. So good. But we both prefer them fried in a flour and spices batter. Just a quick dip into water and flour mixed with paprika, pepper, garlic salt, etc.

this is easy to do even if you don't have much experience frying things. it takes a bit of time, but well worth it.
