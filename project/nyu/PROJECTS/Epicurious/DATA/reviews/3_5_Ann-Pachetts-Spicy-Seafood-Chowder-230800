Couldn't believe how good this was. My small modifications: I substituted catfish for bay scallops, used fresh herbs instead of dried, 1 cup each of the "holy trinity" of onion, celery and bell pepper, used crushed peeled tomatoes instead of sauce, one 6 oz can minced clams with juice and one 10 oz can of whole baby clams with juice in addition to the bottled juice, and finally the key, used black Japonica rice instead of orzo. The firm black rice (which I'm addicted to) added flavor, texture and great color depth to the sauce and visual contrast to the other ingredients. The Chinese call it 'magic' rice and I believe it. Fantastic.

This "chowder" had wonderful flavor, despite its elemental ingredients. It was easy to prepare, and my husband, who doesn't like tomato, was very complimentary. I made to recipe except that I added about 1/4 cup white wine and used dover sole instead of scallops. Also, I simmered the base for at least at hour. Great stuff.

We really liked this dish. I read the reviews and decided to add a 22 oz can of Muir Glen whole tomatoes, which I cut into large chunks. I also upped the amount of celery, onion and pepper (I'm not big on measuring in dishes like this). It turned out like a seafood stew, rather than a chowder. I also served it with brown rice since there is an issue with gluten in my household. I will make this again, either as before or I could eliminate the whole tomatoes and serve it as a chowder.

This is a recipe that I have made over and over. It lends well to additions and substitutions. One thing we do almost always add is a good firm white fish. This recipe is always enjoyed by everyone.

This is okay - just okay. If I make it again I would use a can of diced tomatoes and increase the peppers and celery for more texture and a less "sauce-like" broth. Also would skip shrimp and add halibut and salmon for some variety in teh flavour -- found the shrimp rather bland.

I make this dish quite often, it is great for left overs. I do not put in the orzo though I prefer to precook brown rice then add it to it at the end

Very easy recipe, used frozen shrimp and scallops. The broth was very rich and the chowder tasted better than what I've had at most restaurants. Will definitely make it again.

Great, easy and quick chowder. I added more veggies and orzo and a about 1/3# each shrimp and scallops. I used 1 (10 ounce) can of whole clams. Perfect consistency. I served this with Great Scott's Caesar Salad, and garlic toast.

My fiance and I were really pleased with this recipe. It was extremely easy and turned out GREAT! I used a can of chopped clams and a can of whole clams, and also added two slipper lobster tails. Leftovers will require the addition of more liquid, so I would suggest having an extra bottle of clam juice on hand. This is definitely a winner!

I haven't read last month's magazine so I'm not sure if Ann Pachett mentioned the source of this recipe, but this is an exact duplication (literally line by line ingredients and measurements) of a recipe printed in Bon Appetite in the early '90's called "Sicilian Seafood Chowder." I've been making this for years and had to retype it a few times after my paper recipe got splashed with sauce! It's great for crowds and can be altered with different seafoods. I always recommend using really good canned tomatoes (like San Marzano) to friends I've shared the recipe with. Just thought I'd share the original source.
