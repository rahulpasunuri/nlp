This is pretty simple but somehow the flavors combine to strike a perfect note. I made it several years ago for an annual work luncheon and people have requested it ever since.

I absolutely loved this. It tasted even better with marinated artichokes (and its oil) in there too. I also put in extra feta cheese.

It was good made straight by the recipe, but it was MUCH better (and prettier) after I added a minced clove of fresh garlic and some thinly sliced red onion.

We made this for guests and discovered the next morning that we had forgotten the feta. It was very bland! It's an easy salad to make and I think the feta will make all the difference in flavor so I will try it one more time.

I like to use lemon juice instead of wine vinegar and lots of fresh parsley...
