I simplified the recipe by using 2 pounds of peeled and seeded butternut squash, gently sauted in a bit of oil, gradually added the chicken broth, and used a stick blender to puree when the squash was soft. Then I replaced the spices in the recipe with ground coriander, cumin, ginger, sea salt, and citrus pepper. OUTSTANDING!!! I tried it with the pumpkin butter and pistacios but must admit, I don't think they enhanced the basic soup.

Also, I substituted ground coriander, cumin, ginger, sea salt, and citrus pepper for the spices in the recipe. Outstanding! I tried it with the pumpkin butter and pistachios, but the soup was great without them and I'm not sure they improved the overall dish.

creamy and delicious. i used some fresh sage i had and added a bit of ginger. definitely a good base recipe, will play with it more next time. but as is, easy to make while still in my pjs and thus perfect for a creepy afternoon.

This soup was OK. I tried to follow the recipe as well as I could, but I did add some Cayenne to the dish (I like the smokiness that it gives squash). I also didn't have any Pumpkin Butter, so I used Sour Cream. Overall, the soup was pretty good, if not plain. I think I could jump up the flavor a bit with some caramelized onions and maybe a few mushrooms for added Umami. That would be my next encounter with this easy, mostly quick dish.
