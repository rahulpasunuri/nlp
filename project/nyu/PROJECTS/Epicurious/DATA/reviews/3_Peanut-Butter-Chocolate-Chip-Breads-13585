These are easy to make and they are quiet good for what they are - not muffins, not cake - but tea breads. This is sweet, with plenty of chocolate and peanut butter flavor. I make these a a couple of the other small loaves in the same Gourmet 1990 issue for gifts at Christmas

I added more chocolate chips (regular size) and substituted 1/4 C honey crunch wheat germ for 1/4 C of the flour for extra protein. Sprinkle extra wheat germ on top before baking. My picky 5-yr-old loves to eat this for breakfast. Makes 8 mini loaves.

Peanut butter and chocolate chips are best left in cookies!

Definitely nothing to desire to make again... dry and boring!

I used muffin moulds and baked them for 20mins. The top turned out to have nice crispy peaks. Not sweet enough as a muffin though, but I guess for a bread, it'll do.

I thought this recipe was great - the texture was very moist. Since I can never bake a recipe without changing it slightly, I added two bananas to the peanut butter mixture and it turned out well. However, if I were to do it again with the bananas I would leave the chocolate chips out. There were too many competing flavors. The peanut butter/banana combo was very tasty, though. I will definitely make this quick bread again. I think it would be nice baked in round cake pans for a layer cake.

I didn't care for this loaf. I've made it twice thinking I'd done something wrong the first time but it turned out exactly the same both times. I knew it would be dense when I saw the amount of flour vs liquids when reading the recipe but it turned out very dense. The taste was almost like a peanut butter cookie which sounds good but if I want a cookie I'll eat a cookie. There's nothing wrong with the recipe it just wasn't what I was looking for. Still I really appreciate Epicurious and their free service!!!

This bread was excellent. Light and fluffy, and great peanut butter taste! Everyone raved about it!

This bread was wonderful; very moist and very tasty. I wouldn't change a thing. Next time I might try muffins.

These were wonderful! Anything that has both peanut butter & chocolate I have a weakness for, but this recipe has to be one of the best I have come across.

I changed the chocolate chips to peanut butter chips and it was awesome warm from the oven. I can't wait to make them again and give them as gifts with little jars of jam.

These are very good, moist and delicious. If you like chocolate and peanut butter you have to give these a try.
