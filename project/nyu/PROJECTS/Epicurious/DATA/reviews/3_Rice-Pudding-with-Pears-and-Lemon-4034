Hated it! I was rushing out of the office when I printed this recipe. I didn't even look to see that it lacked dairy. My fault, but definitely never going to make it again.

I have to agree with the cook below this makes an excellent breakfast, but definately is not a dessert.

This was a good, simple recipe for a rice and fruit dish, but I would much rather eat it for breakfast or a light snack. It's not to sweet and using jasmine rice and orange zest creates a "oatmeal" like pudding with the addition of soft, cooked pears. While it is nice to snack on, I wouldn't necessarily serve it as a dessert!

I cannot believe the flavor of this wonderfully low-fat desert! I cheated only a little bit substituting a cup of water for a 2% milk. It came out heavenly! Great for entertaining as well.

I think the recipe by itself is fine, but i'd recommend the use of a combo of skim milk, condensed milk and/or lite coconut milk for some added richness without a whole lot of heavier ingredients. it's meant to be a light dessert, after all, with such delicate fruit flavours. oh, i also just made it all on the stove - tasted just fine.

Based on what seemed to be the warnings of the other reviewers, I got "scared" and decided to just use the inspiration of the pear and lemon, but still cook my rice in milk, and mix in egg substitute before baking (375 for 25 min) so that it was a more traditional pudding. It didn't need the egg, but cooking rice in skim milk doesn't add many calories, and might even add some nutrition, so that could be a beneficial step for some, although the egg was not needed. Regardless though, the pear was a terrific combo in the pudding, and the lemon served to augment the pear flavor. I would make this again, and maybe continue to play with the ingredients, but disagree that it "really shows" how low fat it is. It's a little sweetness for dessert while still being refreshing comfort food.

Quick and easy to prepare. Not what I was looking for when I looked for rice pudding but a pleasant surprise. Very light and fresh. My teenage son loved it!

Very light but full of flavor. Be sure to use ripe pears and don't skimp on the lemon peel. You can add more sugar to suit your taste. A wonderful alternative to any high-calorie, high-fat dessert.

I admit that I was looking for a more traditional rice pudding recipe, but I'm always willing to try something new...and this recipe knocked me out. Delicious! Though there's no dairy, the use of risotto in the recipe provides the creaminess that a pudding needs. Also, I doubled the recipe and added fresh peaches from the farmers market.

I made this dish to end a Thai meal and it was the perfect accompaniment. Though it isn't like a typical "rice pudding." It's very light, satisfying and flavorful. I added a bit of leftover canned coconut milk to boost the creaminess.

This just isn't what I'd view as rice pudding, sure it's low fat, but it really shows.
