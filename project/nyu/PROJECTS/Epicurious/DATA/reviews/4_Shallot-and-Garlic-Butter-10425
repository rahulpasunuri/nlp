I made the mistake of making half this recipe; it was gone too soon! I was looking for a unique garlic bread and I found what I needed. Spread on sliced baguette and browned underneath the broiler. Ah...heaven!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous served melted with steamed shrimp! I also used it to sautee some octopus and it came out beautifully. I have since used it to sautee the fish ingredients for some fish soup and it added wonderful flavor to the soup.
