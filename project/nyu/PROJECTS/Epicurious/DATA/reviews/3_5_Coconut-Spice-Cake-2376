I think that raisens would be great in the cake. I didn't include the ginger in the icing because I thought it might be too intense for my 9 year old

This cake was spectacular! The cake was moist and so flavourful, while the ginger of course is a special textural and flavourful addition, and the frosting is indeed sumptuous - using low fat cream cheese and less butter worked fine too. I served this with fresh sweet pineapple to balance out the richness, and this is definitely a favourite now.

I must've done something wrong. It was not so great even with great ingredients. I will try again

I thought the crystallized ginger was perfect, but then again we love it and that's the whole reason I made this cake. The cake itself was pretty dry and very labor-intensive. Next time I would forget the cake and just make the icing (it would be great on carrot cake).

Yum! My dinner guests gobbled up this cake. Don't leave out the mango around the perimeter.

Delicious spice combination. I found it to be too much ginger for my taste (and many others who tried it), so I will cut back on the crystallized ginger next time. Frosting is excellent.
