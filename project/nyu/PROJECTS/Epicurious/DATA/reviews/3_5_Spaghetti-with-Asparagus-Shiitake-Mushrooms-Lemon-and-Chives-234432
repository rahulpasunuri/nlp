I halved the amount of fat in the recipe (3 tbsp butter and no olive oil), and everyone agreed that it was absolutely delicious. If you make it, definitely reduce the vegetable broth as far as possible, and skip the olive oil - my lower-fat sauce was very flavorful, and I think olive oil would just make it greasy. Definitely making this again!

A fantastic pasta for spring. For me, the secret ingredient behind its success is the vegetable broth, which, when boiled down with some butter, creates a lovely light sauce that coats each and every strand of spaghetti. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

fantastic! made it with fresh pasta and halved the recipe...make sure to cook the pasta in the sauce for a minute before serving so it can absorb all that delicious broth!

Made this with too many substitutions to properly review, but note that I used onion instead of shallot, brown mushrooms, and parsley instead of chives and it was super tasty.

Simply delicious! I followed the recipe with these exceptions--used some tomato angel hair pasta and a mix of wild mushrooms, added some cubed and sauted chicken breast, and used parmesan instead of asiago. I just loved the lemony flavor and lightness of the sauce. Can't wait to try it with fresh Michigan asparagus in the spring.

OMG - this recipe is awesome; however, I followed some of the reviewers' advice. I think the following additions/substitutions made it 4 forks: 1) You must add some fried pancetta. It gives the dish some crispy texture. 2) I used chicken broth instead of veggie broth. 3) I added 5 tbl of lemon juice and it was fine. 4) I used broccolini instead of asparagus. 5) I used parmesan instead of Asiago. My father-in-law, who normally eats very little, had two servings because it was sooo delicious.

I'm making this tonight after trying it a couple of summers ago and loving it. I substitute leeks for the shallots and chives because I'm allium intolerant. I think the leeks are more subtle in flavor. I'm also going to try adding some zucchini this time. It is a very lemony dish, I like the strong lemon flavor, but it is easy to reduce the amount of lemon and zest.

This was excellent! I did not use any Lemon peel or zest & I still found it to be full of lemon flavor. I also added grated parmesan which add another layer of flavor.

I didn't use all of the lemon juice (75%) due to other reviews, but wish I had. Next time, I am going to add pancetta to give it another dimension. This was a really good, easy recipe! Great with homemade focaccia!

Really liked these flavors together. Used a hearty veg broth from TJs that tasted great in it. Also barilla plus pasta (the only pasta I use anymore). I halved the recipe and I could have done with a bit more sauce or less pasta. Very nice, filling, clean vegetarian meal.

I made this paying attention to others' comments. I used only lemon zest, then tasted toward the end and added a little of the juice. I used chicken broth (low- salt) and let it cook down way longer than 6 minutes. Maybe this is why it was so good and got raves and requests for the recipe. Next time I'll add pine nuts and Asiago!

This was a little bland in my opinion. I took other reviewers suggestions and only added 2 TBSPs of lemon. If I made it again, I'd add double the lemon zest. I think it gives it a nice lemon flavor without so much tartness.

Way too lemony for my taste. I tried adding cream to salvage the dish but to no avail. My husband liked it.

This is good, not great. I agree with those who said it was too lemony - and I didn't even use the whole amount of juice called for OR the peel. And it was Meyer lemon, too, so not as "lemony." The lemon overpowers the shiitakes. I would add it at the end next time, to taste. And it needs something else...not sure what. The pine nuts added by the last reviewer seem like a good idea.

I made it exactly as written, except I added pine nuts which gave it a nice texture. I also thought it was a bit bland, but somehow we ate every bit of it. I would call it delicious comfort food!

I have made this twice in two weeks. Once for just myself and then for my husband as well. I used whole wheat spaghetti. I have used both shitake mushrooms and crimini (baby bella) mushrooms and prefer the latter. This is a wonderful meatless main dish for spring.

I used dried shiitake mushrooms which were soaked in hot water, and the resulting mushroom broth instead of veg broth. The pairing with lemon and asparagus was wonderful, although I'd probably add lemon juice judiciously until you were happy with the flavour. I added sprinkled black sesame seeds over the whole dish, which added some nice texture and colour contrast.

I was really looking forward to trying this dish after reading all the possitive reviews. I feel like I wasted my beautiful mushrooms. This sauce is too sour! The lemon juice overpowered the mushrooms completely. It might have been ok with one tablespoon of lemon juice. I may try it again sometime when I forget my disappointment.

Outstanding. I only had dried porcini mushrooms, but I soaked them in hot water and used the mushroom water in place of the vegetable stock. I also roasted the aspargus with olive oil and sea salt to give a little extra flavor.

This is delicious! I've had the recipe for a while in my "must try" file and just got around to making it this weekend. The flavors are light and fresh and the combination of lemon and asparagus is just perfect. My husband LOVED it and he's not a big asparagus fan. I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was a wonderful, easy, weeknight recipe. I used whole-wheat penne pasta instead of spaghetti, crimini mushroom instead of shiitake, chicken broth instead of vegetable, and shredded parmesan instead of asiago because that is what I had on hand. Next time, I will replace more of the butter with oil and make as indicated in the recipe, except use the penne again. It made for a deliciously light, healthy meal. Loved it.

This was really delicious, a very fresh and bright combination of flovors. I made it as a last minute meal for seven and I doubled the recipe. I made so much pasta I was sure my husband and I would be eating it the next night for dinner, but not a single strand of linguine was left. (I added some large tiger shrimp to the sauce at the last minute, but the real winner in this recipe is the lemony sauce.)

This is a fabulous recipe I highly recommend it. I have made it several times as well. Tonight I am going to try adding the cream, and also some chicken. Very easy to make and great flavors!

I love this recipe! We make this all the time. I only make one substitution, per my fiance's preference. I swap out baby bellas for the shiitake mushrooms.

I loved this recipe! It's not quite creative enough for 4 "a dish beyond compare" forks, but it was yummy. The flavor of the lemon matches perfectly with asparagus and shitakes. Plus, its an easy, quick weeknight recipe. (Cutting up the ingredients was the longest part.) I've already made this dish several times, and recommended it to others.

Made with the last of the season's Meyer lemons. Second time added 1/4 cup cream and garnished with crispy prosciutto, excellent! Will make this every spring when Meyer lemons are available.

I don't see how anyone could think that a dish made from mushrooms could be flavourless! Maybe it's because I used so much of the mushrooms and asparagus... I was trying to get rid of them. I cut the butter and broth by 4, and used the recommended amount of the other ingredients. Instead of shaving the asiago, I grated it into the sauce after I'd added the spaghetti to the pan and stirred it just to melt it a bit. I thought this was delicious and very simple... I'll definitely be making it again.

I agree with the cook from PA - this was a really bland dish. The only change I made was using chicken broth instead of veg. broth because that's what was on hand - and then I must have tripled the asiago at the end to give it some flavour!

Rating: 3
I have prepared this dish twice, and it is always delicious. The only change I made was to cook the asparagus a little longer (maybe three or four minutes) with the lid on, and we only had Parmigiano cheese, which we grated and added at the end. It is a great dish to prepare when asparagus are in season and the sauce is wonderful (I use Pacific brand vegetable broth, although homemade would be even better). I will certainly make this again.

I found this dish incredibly bland. The mushrooms and asparagus were nice, but the sauce on the pasta had little flavor. After reading multiple 4-fork reviews for this dish, my expectations were high, but I was really a let down by the results. The only substitution I made was chicken stock for vegetable stock, but I can't imagine that making a huge difference.

Wow...this is amazing! I made it with portabello mushrooms but other than that I stuck to the recipe and everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
My entire family enjoyed this a lot. I cut the butter in half and used olive oil. Shitake mushrooms are pretty expensive, $10-14/lb, so I used 1/2 lb and threw in some marinated sun dried tomatoes for more flavor and color. I also diced a few slices of pancetta and used it to cook the shallots in to add more flavor. worked great, added some more carmel color.

Great. Girlfriend doesn't like mushrooms, so I substituted Artichokes. We loved it. Great with a Bell's Oberon.

Excellent flavor, easy to make. A great spring dish!

This was delicious. The only change I made was using oyster mushrooms instead of shiitake, and the only reason was because my grocery store had a beautiful batch of oyster mushrooms, but their shiitakes were not looking too good that day. Will make it again next time the shiitakes are looking good. Leftovers were still good the next day for lunch.

This recipe took me by surprise. I had to do a few substitutions (only had one shallot, so I added garlic) and used broccolini instead of asparagus but it was delicious. I carmelized the mushrooms and this added a nice depth to the flavor. Definitely a keeper in my house!
