Nice, simple. Really liked the orange-saffron butter. I did not have concentrate, took some orange juice and reduce it down with the saffron then added the vinegar and butter.

I made this dish exactly per the recipe, and it was awesome! We grilled it at low heat with the top down, and I heated the butter sauce on the stove and poured it over the fish before serving. This was truly a spectacular flavor. Fresh fish and fresh oranges and good saffron make a superb dish!

Good but not spectacular. The sauce added a nice touch to the fish.

I modified this recipe slightly to use Striped Bass filets (what was available) and an oven (since it is winter). I placed the fillets on an oiled baking sheet, brushed with the orange saffron butter, and laid thin slices of oranges on top, then roasted at 450 for 10 minutes. Very easy, and it came out delicious!

We made this recipe with rainbow trout, but in order to get enough for 6 people, we had to hit up 2 different grocery stores. There was a definite difference in quality in our trout, which made a big difference in taste. We gave the trout from Whole Foods to our guests and ate the QFC trout ourselves. Our guests all raved about the trout, but I couldn't finish my own because it was a little fishy. Presentation was beautiful. At first it looked like too much food (1 trout per person) but everyone else gobbled up the entire fish and still seemed hungry, so have some substantial side dishes. We served a tasty orzo, steamed sugar snap peas, and eggplant caprese (same Bon Appetit issue as the sea bass) and the guests were still hungry.

This is very good. The sauce is nice. Serve with saffron rice.
