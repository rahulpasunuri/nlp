found this recipe when i was looking for something quick and easy for company -- easy to make and impressive although i definitely cut down on the butter (mainly because the first time i made this it was extremely runny!). also great as a single person for weekend breakfasts!

Easy to make this healthier by using whole wheat tortillas, less butter and lower fat dairy. And, yes, it is delicious.

So easy and delicious PLUS hold it in your hands and eat it on the way to work/school. I've added all kinds of things to these: Chives, Tasbasco, dill to name a few. A blank canvas awaits.
