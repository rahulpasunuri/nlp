I can see why some people thought this was a little bland, but I enjoyed it (though modified it). I made this into a pasta sauce. I used greek yogurt instead of cream (thanks to other reviewers, great suggestion - but for pasta will probably go milk next time). I also used low-fat ricotta and it was fine (needed a healthy dinner). Served with capellini and lots of parm. Great quick week night dinner (and my toddler loved it). Having said all that, I'm interested to try the recipe as written for something more indulgent - maybe served with a delicate fish would be nice.

Yummly! As another reviewer suggested, I used a bag of frozen spinach instead of fresh, all else the same except instead of using whipping cream, I used greek no fat yogurt. I served it over pasta with some pan seared shrimp, and topped it off with grated asiago cheese. Everyone loved it! I wondered if this could be frozen for use later when I would not have an abundance of fresh basil?

Easy to make and very tasty. Served with a heavily spiced pork meal. Refreshing side dish.

A good starting point for a nice side dish. I just barely wilted the spinach, and went for the coarse chop, rather than puree. I also cut down on the cream.

My husband and our guest loved it. I was not as impressed, but the recipe has potential. I did enjoy the flavor of the basil in the spinach, but I'm still trying to decide about the texture. I think that I would prefer roughly chopped spinach rather than the puree. I agree with 04/04/01 A Cook from Odenton, MD. Next time I will use a larger clove of garlic and add more salt and pepper.

Blaaaaaaaah. I really really wanted this to be as good as all the reviews say it is. I used fresh homemade ricotta cheese and picked basil from my garden. I salted and peppered copiously (multiple TABLEspoons of each), increased the garlic, and added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice for added tang, but the end result was still very very tasteless and bland. I don't plan to waste spinach and fresh cheese like this again, but I think substituting reduced chicken or vegetable stock for the cream and adding Tabasco, Worcestershire, or even some soy sauce would help give it some depth.

This is a great dish, which is so easy to prepare! I added some shrimps and clams to make it more flavorful. Served with toasts, this is a dish on its own! Next time, I'll try it with olive oil instead of butter and Greek yoghurt instead of ricotta for a healthier version.

This puree was almost totally tasteless in spite of my adding extra garlic and salt.

Excellent, even 2 of 3 children liked it. I used lowfat cottage cheese and a little olive oil in the processor, and in the pan half the butter and some olive oil and only 2 tablespoons of cream and it was still great!

Good! I didn't have cream, so just used a little milk. Didn't miss it. Served with the Chicken Breasts with Sun-Dried Tomato & Garlic Crust also on this site.

Again I seem to be in the minority here. I hated this. It was like eating Pesto. The texture was horrible. If you want puree'd spinach, baby food would probably taste better. Better to look for creamed spinahc or some other recipe.

This is my new favorite food! I made this with frozen chopped spinach and it was so easy. I didn't add anything else to this recipe, but it does need a good amount of salt. This was wonderful as a snack or light meal, and I just bought more spinach to make it again tomorrow!

Very simple and delicious. I picked this recipe b/c I had most of the ingredients left from a different meal. You can vary the creaminess by substituting cream w/ other things. I will try it as pasta sauce next time.

My 3 children eat every vegetable except spinach. This recipe made converts out of them. I caught my 15 year old in the refrigerator eating it as a midnight snack.

Excellent side for any occasion. The flavors meld together so well. Definitely a keeper.

I only gave this 4 forks cause they don't have 5! I used 16 oz. frozen chopped spinach (cooked in bag in microwave 5 min), cooked the butter & garlic in dish in microwave, & used 15 oz carton of whole milk ricotta. Instead of cream, garnished with dollop of sour cream & basil leaf. Heaven.

I've never considered adding basil to creamed spinach before, but WOW, it was a tasty addition. This will now be the standard way to serve spinach in our house.

I've made it without the cream (using skim milk instead to adjust consistency) and I've also made it with (ahh, gasp)dried basil and it has been great.

This was easy to make and my company loved it. It was a tasty change from regular old creamed spinach

Made this for a summer dinner party and guests raved. Many even requested the recipie. Didn't think any additional ingredients, like bleu cheese, was necessary. Quite good as is.

I don't know what the 1 fork people are talking about. This dish was fantastic! I mean, if it's bland, SEASON IT! It says, salt and pepper to taste. I followed it by the book but added quite a bit of pepper and salt. You absolutely need to salt things with Ricotta Cheese in them. I served it underneath baked salmon filets topped with a beurre blanc sauce. My company raved about it!

The texture is not great. I love spinach but the combination of flavors were not up to my or my guests' tastes. My children who normally love spinach, hated it. I wouldn't go that far personally, but I don't think it is worth making.

I added 1/2 cup of crumbled bleu Cheese and sprinkled with parmesan. It was just the zip this recipe needed. The great thing is you can make it ahead.

It's good with little parm cheese added.

This recipe was not bad, just not good enough to justify the work adn expense of fresh basil. I love spinach and ricotta and basil but together they just did not shine. This was bland and the basil flavor did not come thru.
