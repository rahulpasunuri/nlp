Excellent. Two of us devoured this. I cut off the kernels from fresh corn, but I think off-season frozen would work well also. We loved this.

I give it three forks cos of the consistency of this dish. Taste - Yummy Look - Wow....like one has taken a lot of trouble making it The crust was perfect, but the rest was too runny. On trying to spoon it, it was like spooning milk with corn in it. Is it supposed to be this way? Or is this to be cooled/refrigerated before serving? Any comment from any of the folks who have tried this dish, is appreciated. I would definately try this again and try to get it right.

Easy dish to make, tastes great! I've also added grated parmesian for a nice additional flavor. Made both ways and excellent both with/without it.

It amazes me how much thyme changes corn. So easy, and so delicious!

Wow - Thanks to the other reviewers or I would have overlooked this as too basic and would've missed out on a yummy keeper. I added more thyme (chopped too much) and it was great also used white corn. First time I didn't cook it long enough but noticed the "crusty around the edges part" and it makes a big difference. The fresh corn still retains it's crunch. Recipe could be increased for more servings, I would use 3/4 - 1 ear per person as long as corn stays about 1 1/2 inches deep any bakware would work.

Received rave reviews from cookout guests! They couldn't believe it tasted so good but was so simple to make. I chose it because I didn't want guests to feel self-conscious about eating corn on the cob (and worrying about what's stuck in their teeth!). Nice alternative -- plus, I didn't miss the cookout by watching over the corn.

We found this recipe a little dry. And thyme must not be our seasoning.

very simple to make, very good flavor. I would make it again. You were not planning on using that frozen corn were you? ok, didn't think so.

I would make it again, I think I added too much cream and not enough thyme. The guests ate it all and the fresh, sweet corn was to die for!

A simple and delicious alternative to buttered corn or corn on the cob. This has quickly become my 5-year-old's favorite side dish!
