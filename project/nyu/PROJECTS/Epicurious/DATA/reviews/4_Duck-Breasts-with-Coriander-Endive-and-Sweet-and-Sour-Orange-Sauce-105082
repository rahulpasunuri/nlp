I served this recipe with pureed parsnips and sweet potato, the flavor balance was amazing. It was a huge hit.

Excellent! I did it for Valentines' Dinner. This was my first time cooking duck and it was very easy and very tasty. (and fast, compared with other duck recipes). I couldn't get endives, so as a side dich I did straw potato pancakes (cut the potatoes into juliane strips, dry them, sautee them as little cakes in a mix of butter and vegetable oil) which added crunchiness to the recipe. I served the sauce in a separate bowl, so each of of us could decide how much sauce we wanted.

Delightful combination of herbs & citrus. In place of endive I used mesculin -excellent.

Really great. Made this for Valentine's dinner and hubby thought it was terrific as well.

This made a wonderful holiday-time dinner for two. I considered halving the sauce recipe, but didn't, and it didn't seem to be too much at all when cooking only two duck breasts. The amount of sugar seemed like a lot to me, so I cut back on that just a bit, though now that I've made it, I don't think it would be too sweet if prepared exactly as written. I was surprised the braised endive still maintained a little crunch and retained its own distinctive flavor in spite of the sauce and the braising.

Made this last night- it was great. The endives may not be worth the effort (in my opinion) but the sauce is excellent and goes great with the duck. I could see it working with chicken or pork as well.

I was only able to find marinated duck breast which was good but therefor I didn't follow the recipe's seasoning for the duck. The sauce was good and I made only 1 endive per person which was plenty and good. It was my first time having duck so I would try another recipe before making this again.

Simply scrumptious. Great combination of flavours and textures. I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used sherry vinegar, which worked very well here.

This recipe is over my expectation. Even it is a bit long to cook and complicate, the result worth it. At first I was just looking for a recipe for duck with orange, but this is much better!!!

Fantastic flavours. Do the recipe just as instructions say - it is wonderful.

I have an infant, so I made a much-abbreviated version of this dish, skipping tons of steps. It was still great.

I agree with other cook, you don't need all the corriander. Sauce was awsome and worth the reduction time. The sauce would be great on Pork as well. I served it with an herb risotto. I am not a big fan of endive, next time I will skip it.

Fantastic. I love sweet and sour sauces, and this one is outstanding--and easy, too! But I don't think you really need all that coriander seed for the breasts. And brushing them off was a pain. Next time maybe I'll try just sprinkling the breasts with a little crushed coriander.

Great recipe! I had to give it to a bunch of people. The sauce takes longer to reduce than indicated. So be patient.

Delicious! Make sure you follow the instructions for making the sauce, i.e. ensure you boil down to 1 cup and then 1/2 a cup! First time ever making duck and it was a hit with the husband!
