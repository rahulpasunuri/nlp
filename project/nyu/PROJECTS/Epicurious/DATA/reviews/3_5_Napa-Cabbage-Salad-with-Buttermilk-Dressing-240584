I thought this was delicious. Being lactose intolerant, I never make recipes with buttermilk but this time I made some "buttermilk" with Lactaid whole milk and lemon juice. Everyone thought it was yummy. It added a nice fresh crunchy side to the usual brown, heavy, Thanksgiving meal.

My go-to coleslaw is the Jim and Nick's recipe on this site, but I had a Napa cabbage to use up so tried this one today. I actually added a bit more sugar than called for, plus salt and pepper and a Granny Smith. I wasn't sure why all the comments about watery slaw, until after letting it sit for 20 minutes - maybe some of the fluid gets drawn out of the cabbage? But it was good anyway. A more delicate version than traditional, and pretty with the radishes.

I subbed green pepper and shredded carrots for celery, but I doubt that was responsible for my assessment that it seemed to be missing something. I did use only 50% of the sugar, but think maybe 75% would be better, perhaps with a little extra salt and/or pepper, too. I put the cabbage in a food processor and chopped it quite fine. I think maybe I would prefer a thicker/richer dressing. My husband stirred a lot of tuna fish into it and said he liked it that way.

Yum. This one's going into the rotation. Easy, delish.

I thought this was good, but a little boring as is. The addition of a little crumbled blue cheese and some diced marinated tofu greatly improved it.It's a good, basic recipe that can be tinkered with nicely.

I like this recipe..recommend it highly.

Overall, this was a solid recipe. I only tried it because all the stars were aligned and I had every single thing to make it (except the chives). Cut way down on the sugar because of previous reviews, and also because I subbed orange champagne vinegar for apple cider. Husband had thirds and teenage kid ate it willingly.

This was easy and excellent. The dressing was thin, but light and I like it that way. Comes out more like a light coleslaw. Delish.

This is now my standard homemade "ranch" dressing. This is a great recipe to use if you have some particularly good radishes.

Try the Red and Napa cabbage slaw with apples and pecans. The dressing was terribly bland very boring.

Really good. Added an apple - but blue cheese would be just the thing! Reduced the sugar to 1 teas. The dressing is light - but it works. I may add some sour cream or yogurt next time to thicken.

forgot to add, I spoon in a dollop of s.cream to the dressing to thicken it up a bit; otherwise it's very thin

My husband the picky eater really enjoys this salad. Napa seems to be milder than typical cabbage, and the dressing is very light. A good go-to recipe.

What a great, hearty salad! I added thinly sliced kumquats, which added a little excitement, a nice contrast to the purple radishes in both color and flavor. Also added blue cheese to the dressing and used olive oil instead of mayo.

This recipe was very good. I used scallions instead of the chives. As I had no access to a grocery store at the time. The napa cabbage gave it a lighter flavor than ordinary cabbage. I liked the zip of the radishes..something different. I will definitely make this again.

Really like the Napa cabbage in this slaw. Definitely reduce the amount of sugar and it's even better made a day ahead!

This was very tasty but the sauce was not as thick as I would have liked. We kinda slung the sauce all around while eating it, but it was worth it. Maybe next time I will use a little less buttermilk and let it chill for an hour or two. I took the advice of others and didn't add as much sugar (about 2 tsp.) and was glad I didn't. Also instead of the radishes and celery I added shredded carrots. We ate this alongside some grilled Mahi-Mahi.

I substituted cilantro for celery and enjoyed the result.It's easy and I would make it again.Something was missing to give it the four fork rating!Give it a try.

Great! The flavor of the dressing is outstanding yet subtle for those who aren't crazy about dressing. A new staple in our Fall menues!

A good cold-weather cole slaw alternative. I like the crunch from the radishes and celery. My cabbage head was more like 1-1/2 pounds cored, and the dressing-to-cabbage ratio was about perfect.

We liked this recipe a lot. I made it pretty much like it's written. I may cut down on the sugar just a little next time - otherwise very nice. Even my cabbage-hating husband liked it.

I really liked this - and I don't especially like cabbage. I don't like radishes so I shredded a carrot instead. I must have had a big napa head because I didn't have much dressing in proportion to the veggies. I actually liked it that way - it wasn't soggy and overdressed. I'd definitely make it again.

This dressing was WAY too tangy. I would halve the amount of vinegar and shallots next time. Also, Napa cabbage doesn't have a lot of flavor, even when served with such a tangy dressing. I'd use butter leaf lettuce instead if I made it again.
