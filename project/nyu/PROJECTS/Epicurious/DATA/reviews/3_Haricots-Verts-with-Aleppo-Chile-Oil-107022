Yes! Aleppo pepper is different. According to Jean "The Pepper Lady" Andrews, Aleppo, Syria was the center of the pepper route supplying the west. This pepper used to not be available in the U.S., but thanks to Andrews it now is. The flavor is just wonderful. I am so delighted to have this recipe. I love Aleppo pepper.

The recipe was easy to make, and tasted good. I'm not sure what Aleppo chile flakes are, so I just used the ones you get in any grocery store.

Are Aleppo chile flakes much different from the kind I always find at grocery store?

I have been making a similar dish for many years. I also add skinned broad beans; sometimes some smoked lardon (bacon cubes); and I often use lemon and garlic infused olive oil in the summer. Delicious to accompany plain grilled (broiled) fish or steaks.
