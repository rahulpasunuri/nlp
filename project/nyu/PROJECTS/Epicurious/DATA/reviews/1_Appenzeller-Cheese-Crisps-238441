For my Labor Day dinner party I tried a new appetizer that looked interesting. I will post it with the following caveat: anyone who actually makes this appetizer is out of his/her mind. I was looking for a do- ahead appetizer, something a little different and the below caught my eye, a cheese crisp that wouldn't be too heavy before dinner and didn't require a plate, utensils, etc. This is a *very* labor intensive recipe and the result is, IMHO, definitely not worth the effort or waste of good ingredients. I only post it as a public service in case some poor soul comes across it in Epicurious or an old Gourmet magazine Oh, and if you make it ahead (as I did) and want to "recrisp" them, putting them in a 350°F oven for 15 mins. is going to leave you with nothing but carbon. 30 - 45 secs. is plenty.
