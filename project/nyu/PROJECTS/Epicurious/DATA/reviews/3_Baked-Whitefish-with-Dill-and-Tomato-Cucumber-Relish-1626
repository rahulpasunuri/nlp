served this instead of gefilte fish, and all my guests loved it. My fish store couldn't get a 4 pound white fish so I wound up with 4 smaller fillets and cooked it much less time probably only needed 10 minutes though I left it in 15. The garnish is delicious changed it only to use sherry vinegar and added a small amount of good extra virgin olive oil. Very light and flavorful, a big improvement on gefilte fish which is either so much work or jarred and barely edible.

I gave it three forks based on my opinion (I can't say I love fish, especially cold). However, my parents LOVED it, so maybe it deserves four. If you are looking to find something light for a fish-loving crowd, this is definetly a good recipie.

Very good recipe just as is. I modified the relish with the juice of one lemon and used it on smoked fish as well; it held up well even with the stronger smokey taste of the fish.

A great refreshing summer dish. I actually steamed the fish in the foil instead of baking. Don't know if that made it better, but it was tasty.

The relish is EXCELLENT. This dish is also very good when made with salmon; marinating the fish and serving it chilled with the relish is quite refreshing. A good brunch / summer dish.
