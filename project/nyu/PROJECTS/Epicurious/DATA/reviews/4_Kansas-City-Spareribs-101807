I am only rating the rub, which I used for beef ribs. Marinated with the 2/3 cup of the rub for about 5 hours, due to time constraints, then my husband took over on the grill. Did not want to spoil with BBQ sauce as they were perfect and a hit. Had lots of the rub left over, so can't wait to use again!

I've made this recipe for years and it is wonderful. I frequently "pre-cook" in the oven at 250 to prevent burning. I also make my own sauce.

Used spare ribs as meatier than babyback. Son & I argued (discussed) bbq methods. He won & did not turn the ribs but did loosely wrap in foil for the last hour or so. Loved the combo of rub & sauce. Served w/blackeyed peas salad from epicurious & veggie macaroni salad. Great Memorial Day BBQ!

This is my favor rub. We use it on ribs, chicken, and most anything we throw on the grill. Since we don't have a smoker, we use the Baby Back ribs recipe in the same issue for the broth, then throw the rub on just prior to the grill. Excellent.

This is the best recipe *ever* for ribs! My hubby and I make these every chance we get during the spring and summer. They are always moist, juicy and flavorful, and using KC Masterpiece barbeque sauce with it as suggested in this recipe is like frosting on a cake. It is to die for! As a matter of fact, we're having some today. My mom, brother and sister-in-law like these without any barbeque sauce, and hubby makes his own homemade sauce. Anyway you choose, these ribs are out of this world good!! I put the rub on the ribs when I buy them, then freeze until we are ready to use them. We prefer a St. Louis cut sparerib, but I buy whatever is on sale at the grocery store.

This is not a review, but a question, so please note that the fork-rating is just here out of necessity. For a big-city dweller who wishes to make these at home (with her own rhubarb-based bbq sauce, perhaps) without a smoker, I am wondering if there is someone who has any really good advice. I read some of the comments regarding the merits of slow cooking and know that the results would not be as stunning as the pork would be grilled outdoors or smoked. Still, this seems to be the most appealing recipe since dry rub and glaze are both included. Thanks.

Great recipe. We spiced it up with some smoked habanero in the rub. We also had a pan with orange juice, beer, apples, and onions under the ribs in the smoker - and smoked the ribs for most of the day. Excellent and low effort!

The 1/2 cup of Paprika is a misprint. It was even to mild for my wife, and she doesn't like her ribs very spicey. I added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and ground ginger. That gave it some Life.

These ribs were absolutely delicious--tasty,tender & juicy. We used 2 methods to cook:1)in smoker W/water pan beneath--slow cooking W/soaked hickory chips in foil pkts W/holes upon hot charcoal--good but took 5 hrs. 2)prepared on gas grill,turned on, turn 1 burner off--indirect heat,soaked hickry chips in foil trough--good.HINT;after cooked, wrap ribs in foil,put W/in paper bag & let sit for 1 hr before eating---great.

The dry rub is awesome. The ribs are so tender that they melt in your mouth. Delicious.

I have made this recipe dozens of times since it first appeared and everyone raves about them. One guest said she did not eat ribs and so I served her chicken as a substitute, but when she tried her husband's ribs, she ate half a rack. I cook using a gas grill at the lowest temperature and it takes about 1-1 1/2 hours. If you do not turn frequently, they can get charred on the outside.

Good basic KC rib recipe. For you Weber grillers having a tough time getting the ribs all on the grill: roll the ribs loosely (the meat should to be touching together) and place a wooden skewer through it. You will have an easier time. AS an earlier reviewer recommended, remove the membrane from the rib side.

This was a very good recipe, but I now make it with a 2 lb. flank steak thatI put the dry rub on and leave it on over night, then I grill it on a grill pan on top of my stove about 6-8 minutes per side and than I let it sit for about 5 minutes, I do not use barbecue sauce just the dry rub... than slice it thin, it is one of our favorites

I combined this recipe with the one titled "Barbecued Spareribs" and I made my own barbecue sauce to baste it with at the end of the cooking. I used molasses, lemon juice, dijon mustard, black pepper, cayenne pepper, a can of tomato paste and garlic in the barbecue sauce, just mixed and kept tasting for the right consistency and flavor. The ribs were to-die-for! Raves all around. Slow roasting is key - I raised the grill up high above the coals (with bricks) so the ribs' outside don't burn. Yummiliscious!

I tried this recipe using a gas grill as that's all I have-one burner on and one off and my temp gauge is accurate. I was surprised with the length of time required but planned dinner accordingly. My ribs were turning black after 1 1/2 hrs and I ended up cooking them 2 1/2 hrs by which time they were pretty charred. They had a great smoky flavour but I wonder if someone can enlighten me??? I used side ribs which weren't overly meaty. Is it the sugar in the rub? Is it just the cooking time for a smoker and a barbecue are quite different?

This may be a great recipe, but I had a hard time executing it, as it was tough to maintain the necesary very low temperature in my grill. I have a 22" Weber kettle, and it seemed that as much as I fooled with the vents and the amount of charcoal, either the coals were too hot or they died altogether. (I guess I understand where the gas grill folks are coming from, although, from my point of view, if I have to use gas I feel that I may as well use my oven!) In any event, the ribs wound up being way too cooked, charred, to be truthful. As it turns out, some of my family members like them that way, but I would prefer something a bit more juicy and tender.

I have used this rub many times and the ribs are always a hit. It's not necessary to use all of the dry rub, as the amount you apply overnight is sufficient to produce a delicious result. Also, because I don't own a smoker, I've always cooked the ribs on a grill. Keep one burner on the lowest temperature, with the others off, and let the ribs cook, cook, cook. Turn often, and get ready for the rave reviews from your guests!

Great on the smoker. I would cut the pepper a bit if the kids are going to have any.

I've never been a bar-b-que fan, until now. I slow cook the ribs on one side of my gas grill, with the heat on the opposite side. I usually cook about 10 to 15 lbs. at a time, so it's a two hour process, with moving the ribs around every 20 minutes or so. I've made these for just family, and for large parties. Everyone thinks I make the best ribs ever. My only change is garlic powder instead of onion powder in the rub, about half the salt, and bottled bar-b-que sauce from my uncle's restaurant.

I used 1/2 of the rub the night before and did not add the rub on the day I cooked. Other than me, those who ate it prefer a milder taste and they enjoyed it. Always cook to your guests preference.

This is a great recipe - never really used a dry rub before but it does make a difference....you can alter the salt & pepper amount to your liking and any barbeque sauce which you might have on hand......

I love this recipe. I not only make it on special occasions, but any time I feel like ribs. I have yet to get a complaint from a guest.

the dry rub was overpowering--too much salt and too much pepper! i added extra barbecue sauce during the final cooking but of course by then, it was too late.

Absolutely outstanding! I was a little apprehensive about this recipe, especially when the rub smelled so strongly of paprika, but the final flavor was incredible. I have to admit that I used pork baby backs instead of spareribs, as I thought they would be more tender. I put them in a 250-degree oven for about 3 1/2 hours, then finished them off on the grill with some homemade barbecue sauce (try the "Bourbon Barbecue Sauce," July 2000, recipe also from this website -- the flavors went really well together). I ended up with the most tender, juicy ribs ever! I truly believe the secret to good ribs is to let them cook slowly for a long period of time at a very low temperature. Anyways, I'm so glad I finally found an outstanding ribs recipe, and I will certainly turn to this one from now on!

I made this recipe last year for our BBQ and then on vacation at Nags Head and it was a hit and I'm making it again for Labor Day. I do suggest though try making your own sauce and experiment but KC Masterpiece is a good choice.

Smoked the ribs with an electric smoker for a few hours at a very low temperature. Cooked them in an oven for at least 3 hours at 225 F , then finished them off on the grill for about 15 minutes longer where I applied the BBQ sauce. I wasn't too impressed with the results, but my guests absolutely raved about them. Guess I got tired of smelling them for such a long period of cooking time. They were incredibly tender.

This is a good basic bbq foundation. However, I have a few words of caution. 1) Please don't use a bottled sauce if you can help it (unless it is a local or a small batch brand). KC Masterpiece is better than Kraft, but please be brave and make your own. 2) If using spareribs, remove the membrane on the back of the ribs, it makes it much more tender. Finally, I would not have you cook with the sauce on for 30 minutes as the instructions say. 10 minutes is all you need to make the sauce adhere. As a Memphian, I would encourage you to try some ribs without the sauce altogether- if cooked properly, you may never touch the "bottle" again.

I used the rub on babyback ribs and smoked them in a Weber smoker for five hours. No sauce is needed!! Putting sauce on these would be like putting ketchup on filet mignon!

Excellent...however I agree with a previous review...the longer you can cook them, the better. But I think the paprika is more expensive than the ribs.

I didn't have a smoker so I used the dry rub to marinate the ribs and then baked them in KC BBQ Sauce. The rub was a little bit salty when used this way but the next time I tried it (with less salt) I earned rave reviews!! The rub/sauce combination is even better on chicken...

I used my own home-made sauce and marinated the ribs in the rub for two days. They were some of the best ribs that I have ever tasted. I also used the rub on a pork loin which I then smoked with hickory and cherry. At the end of the cooking I mopped the roast with my lemon based tomatoe sauce and it was excellant. I cooked it to 160 degree internal temperature.

The ribs were great. Everyone loved them. This one is a keeper.
