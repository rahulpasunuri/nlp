I tried it, but I didn't like it very much. Will continue to make my old oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe and just eat one.

These cookies taste ok, I just wish they looked more like cookies and less like blobs of uneven batter. I guess there is no miracle good for you cookie out there...

I think these are great. I've made them twice - once following the recipe exactly, and once with some healthier additions. I like them better substituting whole wheat flour for all-purpose, and replacing 1/2 cup of sugar with 1/2 cup of mashed overripe bananas. They're not your typical decadent cookie, and they're a bit dry, but they're almost like a dense healthy muffin. We all enjoyed eating them.

Simply not a good recipe. I had to double the butter (tasted better when I swapped to coconut oil), added more water to the bean puree, added 1/4 cup apple sauce, 1/8 cup molasses, and added a combo of 2 tsp each apple cider vinegar and baking soda to lighten the overly dense cookies at the end of the mixing period. Threw in 1 cup each dried cranberries, rice krispies and corn flakes along with chocolate. Overall, there are much better bean cookies out there! Black bean brownies are a must try

I was pleasantly surprised how well these turned out! They're the kind of cookies that make you feel good about eating them. They also lend themselves well to other additions, like fruit or nuts. I added cocoa powder (chocolate fix!), dried cranberries and used white chocolate chips instead. I cut back on the sugar... maybe about 3/4 cup, and did a mix of raw sugar and brown.

These turned out delicious despite the doubts of my family about the beans. They should be eaten that day or served as scones in the morning, great with a cup of tea. I did use more baking soda, baking powder, salt, and vanilla along with butter beans to make up for the flavor. Delightful!

I really enjoy this recipe, perhaps because I'm not a fan of super- sugary sweets. I used whole wheat flour, a full tsp of baking powder AND baking soda, a 1/2 tsp of salt, 2 tbsp of butter, 1 tsp of almond extract, 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and a 1/4 cup of soy milk. I do recommend using the soy milk, as it will give it the right consistency. After pureeing the beans, I mixed in the soy milk and other liquid ingrediants (as well as the sugar). I blended them in the blender and then added mixture to the dry ingredients. I baked the cookies for about 20 minutes. Although this recipe isn't for everyone, I LOVE IT!

I changed this recipe so much I'm not sure it is fair to even rate it. I will say I was intrigued by the idea of beans for added protein and lower glycemic index. I am one who tries to stick to a low glycemic index diet- just without all that horrible fake sugar. SO here's what I did- used garbanzo beans, added 1/4 cup flax meal for added moisture and fiber, doubled the salt, baking soda/ powder like suggested. I added 1 tbsp good quality vanilla as well as 1 tsp really sweet tasting vietnamese cinnamon. Then, to reduce sugar use even more- I substituted 1/2 c brown sugar with 1/2 cup mashed bananas. Then I threw in the choc. chips, a handful of pecans, a handful of raisins, and a grab of coconut. Oh and I did not bother grinding the oatmeal.. for healthier snacks I thought they were good.

I really did NOT like the bean!!! If I were a judge I would give it a 1!!!

These cookies are great with a few changes as noted in earlier reviews (more vanilla, b-power, b-soda, salt). To give them a better texture, I ground only 1/2 cup of the oatmeal and put the remaining 1/4 cup in unground. I also used 1/4 c chocolate chips, 1/2 c butterscotch chips and crumbled up 1 chocolate bar. The cookies were very cake-y, but very good.

I wasn't expecting much from this recipe, but these cookies were exceptional for a lower fat and calorie chocolate chip cookie! Instead of 1 cup milk chocolate chips, I used one 12 oz bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also used great Northern beans. I was able to make 48 cookies that were 2 tsp's each. For a total of 89 calories, about 1/2 grams fiber,and 3 fat grams, these cookies were delicious and filling!

Thanks to the cooks who suggested serving these as scones. I made two dozen adding a healthy amount of cinnamon and substituted dark chocolate for the milk chocolate. Very well received by my husband, who hates low-fat secrets.

Four forks when I changed the recipe! for sugar: 2/3 Brown, 1/3 white, 1/8 C. molasses (or use more molasses and less brown sugar) ADD MORE SALT! (about 1/2 tsp instead) AND MORE BAKING SODA AND POWDER (almost 3/4 tsp. each) using about 2/3 C oat flour makes them less doughy, and sweeter (and has A LOT more fiber) I added about 1/2 C. cocoa for choc. cookies) MORE MORE MORE flavoring: 1 Tbsp. vanilla, 1 tsp almond extract, a shake or two of nutmed, few shakes each allspice and cinnamon) P.S: BEating eggs whites and sugar first, like a meringue, and then folding in the fats, makes cookies lighter and givces them a sheen. (I used 2/3 C. splenda, which is like granulated sugar, so I could achieve this better than if I'd added brown sugar straight into the foamy egg whites) I didn't use yolks, although using at least one would give a good, denser texture. maybe sub. yogurt or sour cream for yolks..? Oh one last thing, I didn't have chocolate chips so I used red hots.

I melted the chocolate chips to made a chocolate cookie. I would bake at a lower temperature, if I made them again.

I agree with the other reviewers. This was very bland. We ended up making them into big cookies and then it occurred to me, these were essentially drop scones and were completely different when treated as such! I slathered on the clotted cream, butter and strawberry jam and they were absolutely delicious! Of course, it defeated the purpose of being low fat but I felt so virtuous eating my beans as pudding! Go on, give it a go!!

These cookies are good if you are looking to mindlessly snack on something. They are a bit bland, but I happen to like baked goods that are on the plainer side. I think you can tell they are low-fat (no bean taste) but are good for a low-fat cookie. I used egg substitute and promise instead of butter. I would make these again for myself.

These make very good dunking cookies for tea or coffee, but are good on their own as well. I used white kidney beans, which worked very well. I also tried white-chocolate chips for a nifty, mono-chromatic cookie. Perhaps I made the cookies a bit on the small size, but I ended up with well over 40 cookies. I couldn't find a trace of bean smell or taste once they were cooked (it's actually not that much beans when you do the puree), so don't worry about this recipe being too strange. Plus, they make a good conversation piece!

These don't taste anything like an oatmeal cookie or a Toll House cookie. They taste, and have the consistency of more like a chocolate chip muffin. I doubled the vanilla, the salt, and the chocolate chips (and I used semi-sweet chocolate). With those changes, I thought these were very good. They aren't the kind of cookies you'd serve at a dinner party, but they'd be perfect for a toddler's playdate!

I thought this recipe was kind of a hoot! Very low-fat cookies are almost always cakey and don't spread much, and these come out of the oven the same shape they went in. They're not too sweet, and they taste better the next day. These are more an everyday sort of snacking cookie than something I'd serve to company. And they're better with semi-sweet chocolate chips if you ask me! I didn't make many changes. I added extra salt and vanilla (these would be pretty plain otherwise), and I rinsed my beans and used water instead of reserved bean liquid. Ener-G egg replacer works well in these if you want or need to avoid eggs.

Not a great chocolate chip cookie, but maybe a GOOD low fat choice. Cookie has cake like texture. I added more vanilla and chocolate chips.

I had high hopes for this recipe as the dough tasted delicious. The cookies didn't spread out and had a rubbery element to them. Maybe it's because I halfed the recipe. I'm going to wait for another review before I try them again.
