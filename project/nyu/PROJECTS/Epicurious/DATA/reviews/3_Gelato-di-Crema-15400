've passed over this recipe before due to the low fork rating - I wonder if the reviewer from Italy even tried this recipe? It had a wonderful, creamy custard quality. We liked it a lot and especially since it's easy to make!

i tried to make another custard gelato recipe from your list but it was WAY too labor intensive. this recipe was simple and delicious. today i am going to try a variation with chocolate although it is absolutely wonderful as is.

miss the milk cream, the lemon and the vanilla stick on the gelato alla crema
