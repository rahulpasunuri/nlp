My husband went wild over this recipe. Very very good. The only thing I would change is to use a little more spice than called for next time. Otherwise it is perfect as is and a great way to use up dried apricots left over from another recipe. It can be made after work, no marinading like with a lot of pork tenderloin recipes.

This was amazingly delicious. The only thing I would do differently next time is to cut the pears much smaller, so they would match the size of the apricots. The wedges we cut according to the instructions took a lot longer to cook than specified (like, 4-5x as long) and were gigantic and intimidating on the plate. We also found that this made a lot more fruit/sauce than we needed for the pork, but the leftovers were good stirred into sauteed veggies over rice.

Use California dried apricots, not the Mediterranean. They are more tart and so the flavors will be more balanced. We love this recipe, and make it each year as pears come into season. I've used all varieties; just vary the cooking time depending on which type of pear you use. When pressed for time, skip the oven and prep all in one skillet: rub the spice mixture onto the meat, then cut into 1/2 inch medallions. Saute in 2 tsp of oil in a hot skillet, about three minutes per side or until just pick inside. Remove to plate and tent with foil. Then proceed with the recipe as directed. You may not need as much butter for the pears as there will be some oil in the pan. Add the meat back in after the sauce has thickened, and heat gently, add the pears and almonds and you are good to go. We serve it over brown rice.,

This was good, but too sweet on its own. We served it over kashi whole grains and sesame blend. The rice mixure balanced the sweetness of the fruit and in my opinion this is a must. At any rate, I prefer the pork tenderloin with balsamic cranberry sauce...much cheaper and less work too!

This is the best pork roast I have ever had. Friends and family alike ask for it time and again. It's inexpensive, quick and very easy....yet, tastes like something one may order in a nice restaurant. One may need to tune down the spice if there are children eating...it's a little too advanced for their palate. In a word, divine!

A friend found this recipe and made it one night. It was SO outstanding, I made it this last weekend for all my sibs, who were in town for a visit. It received raves, fed a lot of people, and was very easy. I got bulk spices in small amounts at Central Market, so my expense for the spices alone was hardly anything, and I have made more of the Ras El Hanout spice for other things. Found that Bosc pears worked great....wonderful pear flavor, but kept their fimness throughout the cooking. The sauce gets better after a couple of days of sitting, and would make a great chutney if some vinegar were added. This is definitely a keeper for my kitchen!

This turned out fantastic! Really moist. My friends were really suprised that I pulled this off and very impressed by how well it turned out. I made no alterations and will make again the same way!

Recipe was excellent. I added a bit extra honey and I actually poured a bit of the sauce with the pears and apricots into the roasting pan. everyoe at the party said it was some of the most moist pork they have ever tasted. i would make this again and again!

This dish was fabulous! I loved the subtle flavors of the pears/apricots and Ras el Hanout. Others mentioned wierd taste - not sure what that's about. Prepared for a dinner party - Raves all around. Served with couscous, greenbeans, salad w/cranberries, almonds and a cheese course. A perfect meal!

Great pork dish. I used a commercial variety of Ras el Hanout and the flavors were wonderful. The leftovers were equally as good!

I didn't have any apricots, so I used some dried pineapple, raisens, and currants all soaked in warm water. Used some of the soaking water along with the beef stock. Drank a pinot noir along with this dish. A wonderful Fall dish and a good way to use a bunch of pears.

We enjoyed this a lot, and it was relatively quick and easy. Made some modifications based on what I had in the house-only 3 pears, no saffron or allspice, forgot to soak the apricots. Actually liked the pear to apricot ratio, as I think it would've been too sweet otherwise. The apricots didn't seem to suffer at all from not being soaked, but they were pretty moist to begin with.

This is a fanily favorite for over two years. We've even cooked the tenderloins on the grill, though I've no doubt they could be overcooked if not careful. I always have enough sauce for three times the amount of pork in the recipie and it freezes beautifully. I've relied on it more than once for a quick dinner when I'm late from work; not just for a family dinner on the week-end. The Ras en Hanout stays fresh in a plastic bag, and with lmited time, the pork goes into the oven. Baked yams and a salad round out the meal. I'd serve it to company and never worry it wasn't "fancy" enough. It's prefect all around. And my Mom, sister, and several friends have taken it as their own. This one's a keeper!

I love pork. Well, I love all meat, dearly. But porks is special. There are other ways that I love a P. tenderloin more, but this was still very good. Definitely worth the taste, HOWEVER there are a few important adjustments. Salt, pepper - both in the rub and the pear/apricot mixture. Lastly, just a bit less honey than the recipe asks for.

I followed the recipe to the letter (well, mostly: I cooked the tenderloins on a rotisserie instead of in the oven) and found that it was only fair. I'm not a big fan of pork tenderloin, but I've had it before when it tasted much, much better, so I do think the recipe is just not enough to win me over. I am looking forward to using the ras el hanout on chicken (maybe with a little yogurt?) and I think the fruit mixture would work well with that, too.

Usually I skip recipes that sound too sweet. But on a fall evening this one seemed just right. It is simple to prepare. Served it with baked sweet potatoes and will do that again.

The 'weird taste" comments almost deterred me from this recipe; so glad I made it anyway. Didn't think it was too sweet and it had an excellent taste. Halved the recipe and realized when making the spice mix that I didn't have mace, so omitted and added a tad more freshly grated nutmeg. Used D'Anjou pears. Served with whipped buttercup squash and baby turnips with greens.

RAS EL HANOUT Literally "top of the shop," ras el hanout is a Moroccan spice blend that can contain more than 20 ingredients. This streamlined version includes the main spices of the traditional mixture. 2 teaspoons ground nutmeg 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground ginger 3/4 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon ground mace 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon crushed saffron threads Mix all ingredients in small bowl. (Can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.) Makes about 2 1/2 tablespoons. Bon Appétit January 2002

This recipe did NOTHING for us! The flavors were too odd. It was too sweet. The big question I now have is, "What do I do with the rest of the ras el hanout spice mixture?" I was sorely disappointed and wondering about the rave reviews. Take your chances and good luck!

This was an excellent, simple recipe. The pears and apricots were very complimentary flavors. I served it with japonica (purple) rice and braised bok choy. I wouldn't change anything the next time I make this except the almonds - they didn't really add anything, so I would leave them out.

Our family does not eat pork, so I substituted chicken breasts and chicken broth for the pork and beef broth, repectively. LOVED IT! I have made it twice, both times to huge praise from our guests.

This was a wonderful dish, reminded me of Morocco! Yes, the flavors are wierd- but wonderful! Make extra sauce and serve it over couscous as a side dish- Canned pears work just as well if fresh are out of season. Wonderful for an ethnic dinner party!

I made this dish spur of the moment for unexpected guests and we all loved it. I did not have fresh pears but had canned pears and it worked out well. Had a little left over and it was just as delicious the next day. The spices left a wonderful aroma in the house. This is definitely a keeper.

Because of where I live, Bae, pear apples are easier to come by, so I used these. The result was so delicious, that my friends kept asking for more. I served it with a heated rice salad dish, and this really complimented the pork.

We found the spice flavor just too weird. Also too sweet, even though I cut way back on the apricots as advised.

This recieved rave reviews from my guests. I cut the apricots in half,and it was still sweet enough for me. This dish makes the whole house smell great. There was some confussion about what to do with the pears, after removing them to a plate. I put them in the dutch oven with the pork while it roasted, and all was fine.

These spices make a fragrant and versatile combination. This was very easy to make and can be easily prepared for a weeknight dinner. The sweet potato and squash side dish was a great complement to the dish, even though I didn't have time to roast the veggies, just boiled them and mashed. Still excellent! The spice was mild enough for the children, and they really liked the fruit with dinner.

This was great. The next time I'll use fewer apricots 'cause I think they made it a little too sweet. Also, I found I needed to cook the pears longer than the recipe said. Perhaps they weren't ripe enough. The pork is incredibly tender and the seasoning superb. I served it with saffron rice - it was a hit with my whole family.

This is delightful, fragrant, and easy! I discovered at the last minute that the dried apricots that I had purchased for this dish had gone bad and were covered with some sort of fungus, so I went ahead with the recipe, using only pears. This worked out fine.

Great recipe and rather simple to make. I sauted the pears longer than suggested and simmered the apricots and pears longer to make the pears softer. I also chopped the pears into smaller cubes rather than the wedges as suggested. It turned out great and everyone loved it.

We had this last night, and it was just delicious, as well as being very easy to make. It is quick enough to serve as a weeknight meal, but elegant enough to serve to guests. The spices add a very subtle and complementary flavor to the pork, and the pear/apricot sauce on the side was a nice change of pace. We will definitely be making it again.

My husband and I thought that this was a fun way to prepare pork. The tenderloin was wonderfully moist and juicy and the mashed yam/butternut squash side in the magazine was the perfect complement.

This recipe is a terrific change from the classic pork with apples. I substituted canned mandarin oranges since I didn't have dried apricots and used home-canned pears. It was delicious!

Just finished having this for dinner. Thought it was WONDERFUL. Had a boneless pork roast instead of tenderloin which meant it took a bit longer to cook, maybe 60 minutes instead of 30. Used canned pears because I didn't have fresh and only "sauteed" them for a short time. Oh, yes, I used 4T oil and what was left of the ras el hanout. (What a wonderful aroma it had!) And I also added the almonds right to the sauce. Will definitely make again - probably for company.

My husband made this dish for company last weekend. He substituted the honey with Vermont maple syrup and didn't bother soaking the apricots. They seemed moist enough. For the seasonings in Ras el Hanout, he left out the saffron. I thought the pork by itself was a little tasteless, but our company loved it. You have to be sure to take a mouthful of the pork along with the pears and apricot mixture together.
