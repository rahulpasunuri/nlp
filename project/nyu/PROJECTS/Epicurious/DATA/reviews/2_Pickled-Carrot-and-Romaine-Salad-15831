I liked this. It was easy to make and refreshing. I'd recommend just grating the carrot. It's a lot of carrot to julienne, and if your skills aren't great it could take a really long time!

Bland. I included it in a dinner which had fairly strongly flavored dishes. Thought the vinegar would make this salad comparable. Marinated it for 15 min. instead of the recommended 5, still bland. Perhaps 5 hours would be better. Adding a fair amount of pepper & salt, and some shallots in attempt to jazz it up didn't help.
