This was delicious and will become one of our families main-stay recipes. It is definitely a weekend meal because it is labor intensive, but the end result is worth it.

Yum! Definitely a keeper! I love that it's not quite the traditional chicken and dumplings - while this is still filling, it's much lighter - the gnocci really are like pillows in your mouth. I made as directed for the most part except, based on other reviews & since I was using ground nutmeg instead of fresh, I used 1/2 tsp instead & I thought the dumplings turned out perfectly. Not sure how good they would be left over as they're kind of sticky so I only cooked what was needed for dinner & froze the rest for leftovers tomorrow since they cook so quick anyway. I feel they should mention to boil the broth for awhile (like 20 min) after the roux is added in order to get a good consistency - I didn't expect that step to be as long as it was. And the veggies took a few minutes longer to cook also so I will be sure to slice everything thin enough next time.

This recipe is fabulous! The dumplings are awesome tender, cheesy and the perfect fit for the wonderful chicken stew. Highly recommended.

I liked the dish very much except for the dumplings. They really fell apart when I was cooking them and quite frankly, I didn't feel that they had a very good flavor. I would definitely make it again except I'd find a different recipe for the gnocchi.

OMG, these dumplings literally melt in your mouth. What a delish recipe this is.Follow the directions and make no changes. The leek and turnip marry so nicely with the entire dish making it even fancy enough to serve to guests. This is a must try recipe.

I made it tonight for my kids and they loved it! I did not have too much time, so instead of making gnocchi, i cooled the mixture and then placed it in the broth by the teaspoonful and let them cook there. they were yummy and i saved a lot of time!

A bit labor-intensive, but well worth it. Changed the recipe up a bit and added a thicker roux, more veggies and less nutmeg in the gnocchi. Also added a little tarragon (the chicken that I used had been roasted in white wine and tarragon) and herbes de Provence. It was filling, comforting and wonderful for a rainy Saturday evening dinner. Will definitely keep this as a new favorite chicken and dumplings recipe!

I forgot to add that I used thighs and breasts - I bought a small chicken (about 3 lbs) and removed the legs and wings and froze them for future use. I cooked all the rest of the chicken to add flavor, but used only the thighs and breasts in the final dish.

This is now a new family favorite! Following the advice of others, I doubled the roux and omitted the nutmeg and it was delicious! My wife wanted it to be more like a deconstructed pot pie, so I added a few peas as well. I will definitely make this on a regular basis.

Amazingly good! I'm making it for the second time tonight. First time I followed the recipe exactly except used a combo of chicken breasts and thighs. I love carrots so will be adding more this time around. Will also use more rue to thicken the sauce slightly as one reviewer suggested. The gnocchi are easy and are what make this dish special.

double the roux and it's perfect. Loved the dumplings; first time for me, will make again!

Very good! The gnocchi were delicious, and I thought the nutmeg was just right.

Wow! We have never tasted gnocchi so scrumptious! And the chicken and gravy, delicious! However we have a few quibbles. I grew up the son of a PA Dutchman, feasting a variant of this recipe called chicken pot pie! Much thicker and creamier. I found the broth scrumptious but a little thin for my taste. The next time I make this (and there WILL be a next time) I will reduce the chicken broth to 8 cups. However, I know where Chef Mike was going with this, having had the distinct pleasure of dining at FIG last June. He loves delicate, flavor balanced entrees and scored with this one. A very high scale, gourmet style dish, but one a simple couple like us cooking at home would love to make a little more hearty. Oh, and definitely reduce the nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon.

I grew up on chicken and dumplings, but I have to say, these are the best! I love the use of just thighs, and the ricotta gnocchi is a delicious alternative to traditional dumplings. As a matter of fact, these are hands down the best gnocchi I've ever tasted. They are light as pillows, tasty and very easy to make. I craved them days afterwards and will make them just to have with other mains.

Wow! This was so delicious! Made as written except I used thighs and breasts. I will make this again as written and also make a big batch of the gnocchi to keep in the freezer to have with marinara! I did cook the gnocchi in the chicken broth for extra flavor.

We loved this dish! I made a few personal changes tho. I started thinking about dinner late, so used store-bought fresh potato gnocchi. I also added white wine to the broth after reducing it. To the vegetables, I added chopped anise and sliced mushrooms (crimini, shitake & oyster). This recipe is a keeper!

This was very good! I didn't add the nutmeg to the dumplings (per other reviewers' comments- thanks!), but I did put a little in the gravy. I also added a little thyme and a bay leaf. Although I really like the dumplings, I'm thinking of adding some baking powder and maybe working the dough a bit more next time to see if I can get them to be less delicate and fluff out a bit (if that makes any sense). It takes a while, but if you're in the mood for chicken and dumplings it's worth it.

I particularly like the "Cracker Barrel" chicken and dumplings, but this one is not bad at all. Just different. The gnocchi is light & pillowy. However, I agree with other reviews that the nutmeg is overpowering. I'll make this again but without the nutmeg. I sauteed some of the leftover gnocchis in sage butter and sprinkled with parmesan; that was outstanding!

Followed recipe. Don't waste your time and ingredients. You can get better chicken and dumplings at any corner lunch place between Virginia and Texas.

I made this for dinner this evening and both my husband and 12-year-old daughter loved it. It does take a bit of time and coordination, but the results are well worth the labor. We all thought the gnocchi were delicious - I made according to the recipe but omitted the nutmeg after reading other reviews. The freshness of the veggies really comes through. I did add some frozen peas to the other vegetables, and all proclaimed that a good touch. My daughter literally begged me to make this again - and soon!

Would make again, but reduce the nutmeg in the gnocchi as others suggested. The gnocchi probably isn't the best choice to serve with this dish, but it was light and flavorful. If you want a heartier dumpling use a buscuit style dumpling. I would also cut back a bit on the amount of chicken and add more veggies. As stated previously this is not a thick, stew-like chicken and dumplings, but more a soup with broth.

This was absolutely incredible! The gravy was light and flavorful....the gnocchis :)

This is the best chicken/gravy recipe but I didn't like the gnocchi concept. Instead used the dumplings in the Chicken with Pan Gravy and Cornmeal Dumplings recipe. It's a perfect match as far as I'm concerned. Perfect winter dinner!

very disappointing!! the dumplings were not good, the whole dish lackluster and pretty blah for all the good ingredients. it was just ok. i ended up throwing away the dumplings and adding tiny macaroni to save the meal. most definitely would not make again.

Cook the gnocchi in the broth with the chicken, not seperately. It will give them more flavor, plus it's one less pot to clean.

This is easy and super yummy! Great comfort food.

so delicious! This recipe took me right back to my home growing up in the country. The ricotta dumplings were ingenious (I used half the amount of nutmeg per other reviewers), very savory and tasty. I added a bit more broth just because I love broth but everything else I did as stated. I will make this again and again...so good!

Chicken was easy, delicious comfort food. Extra veggies were added and much appreciated. Ricotta and parmesan dumplings are a clever idea, but the recipe called for an overpowering amount of nutmeg. I also needed to boil them for four minutes (not two) to get the texture right. I ended up serving flour dumplings and using the gnocchi to play with. Baking them didn't do much, but they were delicious fried with preserves on top.

When I think Chicken and Dumplings, I think thick and hearty. This is not that recipe, but it is still warm and comforting and delicious. The next time I make it, however, I will avoid the gnocchi. They are very tender, but they are very fragile and cumbersome. It's way too much effort for something that turned out to be mediocre. They seemed sweet because of the nutmeg, and it was not a good match with the soup, in my opinion. If you do decide to make them, I would definitely freeze them, and be SURE to take them out in small batches with a slotted spoon or small colander. As for the chicken and gravy. I used chicken breasts, and it turned out fine. I would definitely add the broth to the roux, instead of adding the roux to the broth. Maybe that's a roux-faux pas, but it was way easier to do it that way. Also, I let the vegetables cook longer than 5 minutes; I might also like some peas in the final product.

Would make again and again and again!

Took one hour start to finish. Worth the time - tastes AMAZING. I cut the recipe in half and was enough for a main course for four people with salad and bread. I didn't cut the veggies in half though because I love lots of veggies. DELISH!!!!

very good. I added more veggies and basil and oregano. Think I will also add sweet potatoes. It was delicious!

Truly exceptional comfort food. I thought there was just a tad too much nutmeg in the 'dumplings', I'll cut back on it next time. As with the great majority of recipes, great ingredients make tastiest results.

Chicken and Dumplings was one of the first things my mom taught me to cook - at 12 years old - and the recipe was almost identical to this one. I've always had a soft spot for those Bisquick dumplings and I always will. Have to admit that the ricotta dumplings took my favorite comfort food over the top!

Th chicken is excellent as are the dumplings but the pairing isn't the best. I made buttermilk biscuits for the second time we had this and it was a perfect match
