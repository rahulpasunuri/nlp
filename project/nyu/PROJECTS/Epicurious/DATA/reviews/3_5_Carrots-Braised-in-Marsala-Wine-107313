You know, I was expecting this to be something a little more - could be that my carrots weren't up to snuff. Because the dish is subtle and the glaze itself was very good, I would say the quality of the carrots might make or break this dish.

My family loved these. The only thing I did wrong, was not making more. I cut the butter in half and it was still a rich, delicious dish.

Always looking for a good side dish that wont overpower a main course. This is it!! A definite keeper!!! The good quality dry Marsala does make a difference.

This recipe made a wonderful vegetable dish with a grilled flank steak that we had marinated for a day before grilling. We changed the wine to a California Madeira, which was all we had and the results were delicious.

great combination of flavors, the marsala wine compliments the carrots so well. I could have eaten twice what I made.
