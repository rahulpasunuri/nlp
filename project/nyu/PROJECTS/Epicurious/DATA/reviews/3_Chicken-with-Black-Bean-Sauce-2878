Yuk. Bland, muddied flavors. I even got the authentic black bean sauce from an oriental market, instead of any sort of americanized grocery store brand, but following this recipe is a waste of good ingredients. I even tried amping it up with extra garlic & fresh ginger and still couldn't salvage it.

Simple, quick and tasty! Did use a tad more teriyaki and black bean sauce though. Next time will marinate longer and use more red peppers, add some mushrooms, and only cook vegetables for six minutes.

Edible, but not a particularly special meal. I found the black bean sauce tasted artificial, and a had bought a higher-end sauce as recommended by a previous reviewer. I would make it again if I were in a hurry on a weeknight, but not for company.

Excellent. Easy to prepare and extremely tasty. Will make again and again.

This was an easy dish to prepare. I added a couple of tablespoons of water and 2tsp of cornstarch so the sauce thickened up a bit. I also added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for some spice. I also used mushrooms and snowpeas.

Its O.K. Good but not great. I recommend looking for a very good black bean sauce, since it can make a big difference on the taste. I added mushrooms at the end and work out well.

We thought this was good, but not great. At the same time as the onions and bell pepper were cooking, I added 1/2lb of asparagus sliced into 1/2" pieces. As the chicken and sauces were cooking I added a drained can of baby corn and five roma tomatoes quartered lengthwise. I tasted it as it was cooking and it just seemed like "jarred black bean sauce on chicken and vegetables" -- it need some depth or character to it so I added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth which helped. I probably won't make it again, it definitely wasn't bad, but it wasn't memorable. (We didn't find it too salty at all.)

Very simple to make with ingredients you probably have on hand. I did find it slightly salty but this was offset by serving it with plain basmati rice (I don't salt the water when cooking my rice).

I thought this recipes was great! I also added a can of baby corn. Definately would add the corn again. It's a keeper.

I have made this dish several times. Sometimes I add baby corn and diced water chestnuts. I serve it over brown rice or asian noodles. This is a great weeknight recipe because it can be prepared quickly.

Simple enough for a on-the-rush student to make, and very close to authentic Asian-style cooking!

This was so good and easy to make! I marinated the chicken overnight in lots of teriyaki sauce. It was a little too salty (I'm not sure from using too much teriyaki sauce or from the black bean sauce).

Delicious, easy to make, one of my favorites! I added some shitake mushrooms which gave it a wonderful flavor in addition to the red pepper.

This is a great dish! I like to marinate the chicken a little longer, so the teriyaki taste is more noticeable. I did as suggested and added water chestnuts, and I also added baby corns. I'll make this one again, real soon!

This dish turned out wonderfully. The teryaki gave a nice sweetness that was balanced with the spiciness of the black bean sauce. I'd definitely make this one again!

I was interested to see that someone else suggested adding water chestnuts, as I've been adding them to this recipe for years. I add about 1/2 cup of sliced water chestnuts when I add the pepper and onion. This is also good served with sesame noodles instead of rice.

I thought this dish was very good, simple, healthy and easy to prepare. I would recommend cooking the chicken separately and then combining with the cooked vegetables at the end. Per the other review I added water chestnuts and agree that it was a good addition.
