This is a keeper--with some modifications! The sugar level seemed just fine to me, but I did double the lemon juice to add some more tartness, and added the zest of one lemon, finely chopped. I also added some spices toward the end--1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 3/4 teaspoon ground cardamom, 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves. The main thing that I'll do different next time is to cut back considerably on the cooking time. I started wondering if it wasn't getting thick enough after an hour of simmering had passed, but the recipe said, 1-1/2 to 2 hours...so I simmered it 1-3/4 hours altogether. I'm going to have to hack it out of the jars, it's so thick and stiff! I will, because it's so tasty, but I won't be giving this batch as gifts (good thing I wasn't counting on doing that--it cooked down so much it only made 3 half-pint jars!) Next time I'll trust my instincts and start testing it at about an hour--and I'll also make a double batch!

Question - Can this be frozen instead of sealed?

Everyone here seems to be talking about this being too sweet, but mine was very sour and strong. After the two hours, I added a bunch more sugar and a bit of water to make up for what had boiled off to turn it into jam instead of butter. Tastes fine in the end, but I wouldn't try this recipe again.

Excellent. We had really tart plums from a neighbor & they were still tart even after all the sugar! To the cook who felt she only had sauce, likely the only thing you did wrong was not test the butter on the frozen plates as directed. It has a sauce consistency until cooled, but once on the plates you can see how its setting up.

Um, for those who complained about it being too sweet: Jam and preserve recipes call for so much sugar because that is what is required to keep it from spoiling once jarred. Sugar functions as an important preservative here, not just for sweetness. If you mess with the sugar ratio, it could be dangerous (or at the very least, wasteful). If you want to reduce the sugar, don't jar it but freeze in batches instead.

Fabulous! So so good. We followed the recipe but also added the zest of the lemons and the zest and juice of oranges.

To me, all preserve recipes call for way too much sugar. I used 2 cups and this was still very sweet. Of course, all fruit preserve recipes call for experience and common sense to get the best results. I combined some very over ripe plums a friend gave me with several tart and not yet completely ripe plums to get my butter. The vanilla bean is brilliant. I will be using that with other recipes as well.

Have made this two years in a row (loaded plum tree), and the flavor is outstanding. However, I reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 c and still found it way too sweet. Will try 1 1/2c next near. It took the full 2 hours to turn into something thick enough to spread. I'm sure it has something to do with the water content of the plums. I used the small Italian plums.

I found it difficult to determine when it reached the "butter" stage, and got jam instead, but it was just fine anyway. I guess my small red plums (about 1 1/4") were sourer than most since I used all the sugar and it is a little tart. These plums are great for eating so I assumed they were sweet, even though the skins are mouth-puckering.

DELISH. I also used a little less sugar than called for but my plums were especially sweet. I subbed a splash of red wine for the lemon juice, and the results were absolutely divine. I used the plum butter to fill homemade poptarts, and now at last I am POPULAR. And no one, no one can take that away from me.

I followed this recipe exactly, but my result was a beautifully colored, delicious plum SAUCE. After 4 hours of simmering, it still had not thickened significantly, so I went ahead and sealed the jars. The sauce however, is really good, and will taste divine over ice cream, pound cake, or french toast. I just wish I knew what I had done wrong.

I followed the recommendations and used 1/2 vanilla bean and 2 3/4 cups sugar. It was gem colored and soooo good and very different. I keep looking at the ingredients wondering what makes it so unusual and spicy. Now a new family tradition!

This was one easy to make recipe! I made two batches in one day and could easily have made another. It also tastes very good. It is quite sweet like most recipes of this type though.

THis is delicious, but I agree with the other reviewer that it's a bit sweet. Next time I make it, I'd reduce the sugar a bit and also just use half a vanilla bean- I found using one to be too overpowering for my taste. This was my first time to make jam with no pectin- it works!

Absolutely delicious. I used a little less sugar than the recipe called for as most of these recipes call for too much sugar far my tastes.
