Although this is indeed a tasty way of preparing octopus, I would personally recommend using puffer fish if I were to make this dish again. The octopus can be a little rubbery while the delicate flavours of the puffer fish would be an ideal complement for the arugula. Also I feel the dish could be improved by the addition of a few teaspoons full of cayenne pepper to give it more of a kick. PS Remember to be careful when using cayenne pepper.
