i would use half the ginger if i made this again. but i probably won't---the lemon ginger hinted at cold-medicine.

Simply fabulous.Most everyone loved the surprise of the spicy ginger. I used just dug ginger and it might have been a little strong for some. I used Meyer lemons so increased the juice to water ratio and used my own crust with graham cracker crumbs embedded.

I made this with LOTS of ginger and it was spicy and wonderful. Everyone loved it. One word of caution: with only 1/4 c. cornstarch, it was a bit 'soft', add more if you want perfect looking slices.

I didn't care for the filling -- the addition of ginger wasn't a plus. The crust, however, was great, very easy to handle and roll out. I made it in the food processor, which was much easier than the method described. It only required a scant 5 T. of ice water, not the 8 mentioned.
