The rolls in this recipe are really big. I've made these rolls a few times, and I haven't been impressed. They're not bad. For the work that goes into making them, though, they may not be worth it. That said, they are fun to make; and the sauce is tasty. The rolls themselves need more flavor.

I love this recipe for many reasons. 1). I personally think it tastes GREAT, and it is fun that it can be personalized for me or anyone else who is joining me at the last moment. If I were still working long workdays , this would be a particularly advantageous feature. 2) Lovely presentation, particularly if cut in half on the angle. One can play with the preentation by dribbling the sauce in different ways, adding arrangements of the fresh herbs, and adding flowers like pansies. 3). I use the Asian seafood substitue that one can buy in the local Kosher supermarket. That way I ahve a more common summer roll taste with seafood, but friends with seafood allergies are safe. 4). I have a disability that makes me fatigue very easily. It can also make it hard for me to tolerate food. With this recipe, my aide can make it for me when I'm not feeling great, and then when I'm alone I can assemble it accordindg to my toerance at the moment and I have something perfect for me in seconds. 5). The fresh, clean tastes of summer are highlighted by using freshly grown herbs, which i cn do in my tiny condo garden. Fresh Mint and Basil grow so easily that they are paractically like weeds; only the cilatntro is more challenging here. 6). For guests, nice to personalize by adding more or less vegetables. Lettuce? Mung bean sprouts? I love them, but not all my guests do... I LOVE this and can't say enough good thigns about thsi recipe. Only problem: It makes me miss Gourmet extra. No magazine in press that I've seen compares even closely to Gourmet. BonAppetit doesn't come remotley close for me! Last but not least, if you can find the rice paper that looks like it was made somewhere in Asia, it works much better than the ones iwth labels geared towards and American audience. Those teng to not be as pliant and compliant as their Asian cosuins.

Very labor-intensive for a very mediocre recipe. Lots of stuff to cut up, lots of pots and pans. Have had summer rolls at parties and restaurants, and love them. Was eager to try at home, but ended up disappointed.

Perfect. Made them for dinner last week and I'm making them again tonight! Perfect flavors, excellent balance with the basil, mint and cilantro. Fresh, light- wonderful on a hot summer day!

I made this for the vegetarians and vegan at a party I had and everyone loved them! Even the meat eaters. They taste so fresh. I did exactly as it said and even baked some tofu for them. The peanut butter and hoisin flavors are a great pairing with these rolls. I'm really craving them right now.

I have loved almost every recipe I have found in Gourmet magazine, but this recipe was truly disgusting. I made it exactly as in the recipe and it was so gross that my husband and I had to throw it out. Don't waste your time with this one

This was delicious. Just made it for a Asian-inspired Sunday night dinner with friends, one of which said they were better than some in Vietnam! Couldn't find "baked" tofu, so skipped it altogether. Forgot to buy jalapenos, and it was great. The sauce is the best of its kind that I've tried. Easy, try it!

I'm not a lover of bean sprouts so I eliminated them. I also cut way down on the herbs so they don't overpower the flavor. It tasted healthy and delicious. Peanut dipping sauce was great. I will definitely remake this recipe.
