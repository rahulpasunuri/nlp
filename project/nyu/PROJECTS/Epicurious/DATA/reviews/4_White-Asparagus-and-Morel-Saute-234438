I made this for Easter dinner--I used dried, reconstituted morels. It was really wonderful! Everyone loved it. One of the best veggie recipes ever!!

We use this so much I felt compelled to review (this is my first review). We have only ever used green asparagus, use a little less butter than called for, and don't add the parsley. What we end up with is an extremely versatile result that we have used as a side dish, a crostini topping with goat cheese or ricotta, a great pizza topping, an omelette filling, and most recently, tossed with pasta for a great, easy dinner.

I use this method to make any asparagus: after trimming I put it in a frying pan of boiling water, turn it off and it is ready to eat by the time the salad course is done, I did the white asparagus the same way and it was great. None of the bitterness from the asparagus that I expected. The dish was perfect with our Easter dinner of ham and turkey!

This was a great recipe! I wish I would have been able to get white asparagus (can't find it in Northern MN right now) but I was able to obtain fresh morels. Tons and tons of butter in this dish, but worth it if served in moderation. Not an everyday side but definately an impressive dish for company. Just do a cholesterol count before you serve!!
