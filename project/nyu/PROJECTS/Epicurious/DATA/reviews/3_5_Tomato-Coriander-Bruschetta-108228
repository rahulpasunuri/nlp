This is really, really good. In the summer, I grill rounds of polenta and serve it on top of that instead of bread. It is always a big hit.

I had a dinner party where this was one of about 6 dishes, and when planning my menu it almost got cut. But I'm so glad I didn't cut it- it ended up being my favorite!! The flavors worked so well together and the red pepper gave it a perfect kick. Super-easy, too and leftovers were delicious. Will be making it as often as possible!

This dish is GREAT. It is great on bread, so simple to prepare and is a 100% crowd pleaser. I usually double the recipe and it always disappears.

I was impressed by the simplicity of this recipe!! I was having a busy weekend and needed some extra items to serve with coctails. Everyone raved, the coriander is a nice twist on an old standard. I'm making it again this weekend!
