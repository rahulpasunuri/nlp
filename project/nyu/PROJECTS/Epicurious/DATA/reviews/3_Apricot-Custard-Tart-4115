I made multiple small tarts instead of one large, so I halved the recipe quantities--otherwise, I followed it exactly. The tarts are amazing! The crust and custard are just sweet enough to balance the tartness of the apricots, and the tart as a whole is attractive enough to serve at any dinner party. I will definitely make this again.

I used my own pastry dough recipe and used good Cognac in the custard and had a brilliant result. Everyone asked for seconds.

I made this tart and it was terrible. The crust was hard, the custard dense, an all-around zero. I quickly made a souffle (which was great), but still served the tart - nobody ate it!!!!

I made this as a last minute dessert for dinner guests. It was lovely! I added some finely ground almonds to the crust and served it with freshly made french vanilla ice cream. A keeper!
