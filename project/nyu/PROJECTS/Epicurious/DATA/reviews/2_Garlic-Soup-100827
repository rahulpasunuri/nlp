The smashing of the garlic and "forcing thru the sieve" are very important - I had nothing left to spread on bread as another reviewer did. With that said, adding sweated exotic mushroom mix made the soup a keeper and I am looking to use it as a base for other soups/sauces.

First of all, I think garlic is my favorite seasoning. That said, this dish was a bit of a disappointment. Mine was quite bland as well, but I could definitely taste the garlic. The name "Cooked Water" is deinitely appropriate. It tastes just like boiled water alone. The flavor is complemented quite nicely by fresh bread, though. Since this is the first soup I have ever made, I think I will make it again to be fair but it isn't something I would serve guests.

This recipe is NOT garlic soup! It's actually more of a light parmesan cheese soup. You expect to taste an intense garlic taste, but it's really a wonderful, yet somewhat bland cheese flavor. A great recipe to use as a light starter. As mentioned below, smash up the garlic cloves before boiling them and grate the parmesan freshly!In addition double the amount of fresh thyme. I even used the left over garlic/thyme from the sieve to make some garlic crostini and serve it next to the soup! YUM!

Regarding the comments below, you probably have to smash each garlic clove a bit to release the oils. If you just simmer the cloves in water like the recipe suggests, you won't get any flavor out. I understand why you thought it was lousy. The garlic needs to be pulpy, not whole. The recipe may work better if you roast the garlic head with oil for 45 minutes in the oven, toss the softened garlic pulp in the water and then continue with the recipe. Haven't tried that, though.

I don't know what I did wrong with this recipe, but it did not turn out at all. The flavour was very bland, surprising for a dish that calls for so much garlic and parmesan. It was inedible.
