I have made this turkey several times, and it is always wonderful. Prior to finding this recipe, I cooked MANY different recipes, with varying levels of success. This recipe is simple, and I think it's quite forgiving. If you aren't sure about your skills with gravy, this is a good choice. Plus, you get to enjoy a glass of port while you cook! :-)

I have celebrated Thanksgiving for the last 6 years, in Holland. It includes with my husband's family and our friends, who come from all around the world. I am the token American. I chose this recipe to combine with the baste sauce of 'Port basted Roast Turkey' on this site as well. I always brine my turkey 24hours in advance. I followed the roasting directions and gravy of this recipe. I rubbed the bird with oil ,herbs, salt and pepper, then follwed the directions as stated. I then started to baste the bird with the 'port baste' from the other recipe, after 1 hour of roasting, basting every 30 minutes until the bird was done. I made the port gravy as stated in this recipe. The color of the bird as it came out of the oven was lovely. It had all my guest gasping in awe. The true test was the taste and indeed it was fabulous! The gravy complimented the bird very well. I made the '3 Mushroom Dressing', on this site, to rave reviews from all my guest, for this fabulous meal. All in all it was a wonderful Thanksgiving that everyone thoroughly enjoyed. This recipe is definitely a keeper and I highly recommend it to all!

I made this with a 20# free range turkey and doubled the gravy recipe. I've never cooked a turkey before, and this one came out really well. It was so moist compared to any turkey I've ever had [my family is known for making dry turkeys]. I even forgot to baste it and turn it around as the recipe indicated. The gravy was a touch sweet, but it worked so well with the turkey, mashed potatoes and cornbread stuffing.

The flavors in the turkey and the gravy were wonderful. I did change the cooking method a little. I followed Alton Brown's recomendation to cook the bird for half an hour at 500 degrees then drop it down to 350 and cook till it reaches 165. It gets to 175 in carry over cooking. This produced a delicious juicy bird with potato chip crisp skin. Ahhhh perfect!

Super easy and super moist turkey. this was my first time making turkey, and I used an organic bird. The grocer said it would be way better than regular turkey and organic always comes out moist. I don't know if that is true, but I know this is the first time I have ever enjoyed moist breast meat. the stock was simple and tasty and I didnt add port to the gravy, but it was delicious. Our bird was closer to ten pounds and was done when I pulled it out to pour stock over the bird.

I used this recipe for my first turkey experience. My husband and I had invited our parents over and we were all very happy with how the turkey came out. It was easy and the port added an exquisite, rich flavor to the gravy that made it special. The next time I roast a turkey I will definitely use this recipe again.

I would give this 3 and a half forks, but since it was so easy, it gets upgraded to 4! The turkey was perfect and the gravy was divine. I was worried that the flavor of the port would dissipate in the final steps of boiling, but it did not - adding a delicious richness and depth to the gravy. I did brine the turkey beforehand and also let it sit uncovered in the refrigerator for 12 hours which made for very moist turkey meat and a crispy skin. The finished product looked beautiful and was very easy to prepare.

This was the first year in a very long time that I tried new turkey/stuffing/gravy recipes and I am so glad I did! This was outstanding and the cornbread stuffing with fresh and dried fruits was a wonderful accompaniment. We now have a new standard in our house for Thanksgiving, and I seriously doubt that we will limit this dinner to once a year.

This was a great,simple recipe.Turkey was done in 3 hours. Gravy was a big hit. Got voted "best gravy ever" with my family

This was a much simpler recipe than we've done in the past (from Joy of Cooking), reducing our usual Thanksgiving kitchen stress level. Our 10 lb turkey cooked very quickly, was juicy, flavorful, and BEAUTIFUL. It really only gets 3 forks in my book, but the gravy brings it to a solid 4. Such a simple stock (no herbs or spices) but FANTASTIC! Though it all turned out successfully, next time I would not mix the butter and flour then add to the stock in the saucepan. The mixing was quite awkward, especially since they suggest you use a "small bowl". I would melt the butter in the pan, whisk in the flour, then whisk in the stock and pan drippings. Voila! Simple! Perfect!

I brined the bird overnight and it made the meat wonderfully flavorful and complemented the flavors nicely. The gravy was out of this world. I will most certainly make this recipe again!!
