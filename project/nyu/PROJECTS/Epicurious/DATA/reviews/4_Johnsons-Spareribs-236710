I just made this....rehearsing for Labor Day Weekend.....really really good. The only reason they didn't get 4 forks was b/c smoked ribs have a slight edge here...However, these were terrific. I used only 2 T tabasco -- I think the red chili pepper adds more heat than the Tobasco frankly, and it had a zing but the heat wasn't overwhelming. I would recommend doubling the sauce. I used McCormick's Cajun seasoning as the dry rub -- and b/c I was really busy -- they marinated with the rub for 3 days but still turned out great.

I think i probably should have kept this at around 300 or 325 degrees: the meat was a little dry when it came out of the oven

I've never made ribs before, but these were easy and turned out amazing! They were falling off the bones tender and the sauce had a great flavor.

Made this last night and it was wonderful. Different from our usual rib flavor. I used those big pork ribs, and even with a fairly short cooking time, they were tender and good. I even doubled the recipe as I had two racks of ribs. Note, I used a foil roasting pan supported by a cookie sheet and it made clean up a breese.

These were great. I consider myself a pretty experienced cook, but had never done ribs before. They turned out beautifully, done exactly as written. I will say the sauce was SO tasty, but very spicy hot -- I may cut down the tabasco next time.

These were fantastic, even considering that I forgot the Tabasco. The next time I make these, and I will very shortly, I will line the roasting pan with aluminum foil to help with clean up. My husband and our dinner guests raved about them.

I thought the sauce was very, very good. My husband came home from work, smelled the house and got all excited because he thought we were having Buffalo Wings for dinner. But, he was still happily surprised when I told him they were Spareribs! Yum!

Sounds like "A Cook from NYC, NY" is a cook from NYC, NY. The ribs were awesome.

Sorry, had to write this one before tasting the final product but, experince tells me it's gonna kick ass. Ribs rubbed 'n' chillin'. Sauce made. Really yum: 'Long drive to town so had to sub' dry mustard and Frenches, lime for lemon, went half & half roasted and minced-fresh garlic. 'Damn near put in some mango. 'Looked longingly at a bottle of Worchestershire sauce for what must of been pi/2 minutes. 'Sub'ed a little balsamic for some of th' white vinegar. 'Gone over to the darkside usin' chipoodle tobasco. Got distracted typing this by the really hot lookin' electrolux girl in the ad'. 'Sub'ed half of ketchup with kraft hickory bbq sauce. 'Wrestled a baby 'gator while th' sauce was cookin'. Forkin (sic) yum, dude! ...and I ai'n't even started warmin' my meat warm yet. Noticed ther ai'n't no "Hell, Yes!!" radio button so just clicked the "Yes" one. Sure I'd make it ag'in.

I am no BBQ expert so you may want to discount my opinion ... but when I tasted the sauce after it was cooked, I found the sauce inedible. I had to quickly tone down the vinegar and tabasco with more ketchup, more sugar and some hoisin sauce. I would taste before adding all the vinegar and tabasco.

Made these for my husband's birthday dinner with Potato Gratin with Goat Cheese and Garlic from this site. Excellent ribs and very simple to prepare (comparatively speaking). I used Urban Spice Cajun Street for the cajun spice, applied dry rub the night before. The only thing I changed was to reduce the Tabasco to 3 T and happy I did; the spice level was perfect paired with this particular cajun spice. We will be making these again, and again; my husband who loves ribs, declares these the best ribs ever.

Very good recipe. I used baby back ribs. Super tender and moist, falling off the bone.

Very good; very easy. I froze leftover (unused sauce) and making the ribs again today. First rib recipe I have ever made twice!

The best ribs I've ever mad. Not at all sweet considering the amount of sweetening added.

These are really very good. It is nice to have a rib recipe that is also not a horrid production to make. I loved them!
