Try starting with less vinegar and working your way up. Definitely add some sugar. I also added mirin (sweet sake).

Try with minced leek or even green onions. So yummy! I also added a pinch of sugar for hidden taste. Works great for salad too!

Made this to go with the Herbed Salad Spring rolls. FANTASTIC! I added a touch of sesame oil and a bit of sugar. WOW! Makes a great dressing to put over salads too! I'm keeping a batch of this in the fridge at all times!

this sauce is awesome. i have made the dumplings it goes with many times and they are fantastic too. it's best if you make the sauce at least 30 minutes ahead of time to really let the ginger soak into the sauce.
