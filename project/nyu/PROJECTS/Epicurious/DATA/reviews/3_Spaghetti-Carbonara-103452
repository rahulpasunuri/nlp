my spaghetti carbonra was dry also, but having viewed other recipe saved a portion of hot water i used boiled the noodles in added that to the mixture. I also added three table spoon olive oil,additional garlic and onions. I mixed crean, egg and cheese and let sit while cooked the (thick cut pepper) bacon and noodles. I loved the simplicity of the recipe and any one can make.

I shared Solaera's skepticism about butter & cream, & followed her/his suggestions - fabulous! An easy quick meal.

Reviewers have written that the end result of this recipe is too dry and some have mentioned that cream should not be added to carbonara. That is because in a traditional carbonara the sauce is never, never simmered! The egg sauce should be 'cooked' using only the heat of the pasta itself, no cream will then be necessary. If you add eggs to hot, starchy pasta and THEN simmer you will get glop. This dish, prepared tradtionally will have a silky, rich texture without the extra calories that the cream will add. What I do: I use 3-4 WHOLE eggs brought to ROOM TEMP mixed with plenty of fresh ground pepper, a dash of salt and 1/4-1/2 cup of parmesan cheese. Set aside. Saute the bacon in butter if you like, but really, is that necessary? I add a clove of minced garlic and a bit of chopped onion to the bacon after it is almost cooked, just enough to soften them a bit. When my pasta and bacon are done I add my HOT pasta to a HEATED bowl and quickly add my egg mixture and stir in my bacon. No glops. Perfect every time. And yes the eggs will be cooked enough....

There is a much better version of this dish on this website from the March 2003 issue of "Gourmet" magazine. There are flaws in this recipe that lead to its texture and flavor (or lack of it) problems. First, no cream. Second, use all the egg. The whites are mostly water and that will smooth the texture. Third, garlic is needed, and maybe onion. Basically, forget this recipe and use the one I mentioned above.

I was excited to make this recipe as I'd wanted to try Spaghetti Carbonara. I was disappointed. I found a lack of taste and the finished product was clumpy, because of the egg and parmesan. I guess I'll continue looking for a recipe that works.

After reading the reviews, I added a little more cream. The receipe was wonderful and my family loved the meal.

This dish was awful! I followed the recipe carefully and I have to say that I was embarrassed to serve it. After a few bites, we all threw it all away. I fix many recipes from Epicurious and most of them are excellent if not outstanding. This was a complete disapointment. It does not deserve to be listed.

Two major complaints. From me: too thick! will remedy next time with less egg and more cream. From the hubby: Not enough bacon! easily fixed:) I added some garlic, basil, pepperflakes and a dash of garlic salt at the end. Will be done again!

I've had this dish in Italy before. This recipe is very delicious and easy to make. We always like to add a good amount of salt and pepper. I added 2 tablespoons of the pasta water to temper the egg/cheese mixture more and combined everything over low heat to ensure no clumping.

this recipe was easy to make and very tasty. I used pancetta instead of bacon and it made all the difference. I also used a little bit of light cream to moisten but didn't need much of it. I added peas at the end which was a nice touch.

Spectacular! This is unbelievably easy and tastes so good! I've made it without the bacon and it's equally delicious (just takes a little extra butter). Pasta carbonara may not have any cream in the authentic sense, but this is a great dish. We served it once with some roasted pork tenderloin, another time with chicken breast ... great every time! And yes, it can get dry sometimes, so I just use a couple extra spoons of the cream and it works for me.

Rating: 0
For those who want to know how to make it moister... always keep about 1 or 2 cups of the water when you drain the pasta... after you mix the pasta and the sauce, if it becomes to dry, you stir-in some of that water. it works with all the creamy sauce pasta.

OK, OK, it's not "authentic"--at this point I'm focusing less on "authentic" and more on "what my family will eat." but I sauteed onion and garlic in the bacon fat and added that, plus some petite (frozen--thawed) green peas, plus LOTS of cracked black pepper. I also added a bit more cream to loosen the sauce. It was fab and I'll make it again.

I loved this recipe, because it was very quick to make, used ingredients I always have on hand, and it tastes great! Next time I will plate it up a little sooner so that the sauce doesn't evaporate as much. I topped each serving with lots of extra cheese!!!

It's a good dish, but bland. Next time I will be using the following recipe that I saw made in a Roman restaurant on food TV's $40 a day. You can use thick cut bacon instead of the pancetta and parmesan instead of the romano for a cost effective meal. Spaghetti Carbonara Recipe courtesy Enotcea Corsi, Rome Italy 1 pound spaghetti 4 eggs 1 teaspoon black pepper 3 teaspoons Pecorino Romano, plus extra, for serving 2 teaspoons cream, optional 3 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil 3 slices pancetta Boil the spaghetti in salted water until it is al dente. Drain and set aside. Beat the eggs. Add the black pepper and cheese to the beaten eggs. Set aside. Add cream to this mixture, if desired, for a creamier dish. Put the oil in a saucepan with the pancetta, and saute for 5 minutes. Add the spaghetti into the pan and saute for another 3 minutes. Turn off the flame (this is important) and add the egg and cheese mixture to the pasta and mix. Serve with additional Pecorino Romano on top.

I thought this was very good, but my husband thought it was too dry. Any suggestions on how to keep it moist? My children thought it was great, but again, by the end of the meal they were swigging their milk to get it to go down!

I have always loved Spaghetti Carbonara as the ultimate comfort food. When I lived in Vienna, I came across a recipe which has never failed me -- just like this one -- except add a pinch or two of nutmeg. You can also make this with plain old boiled ham browned in butter instead of bacon.

I prefer Italian restaurateur Romeo Salta's recipe from: "The Pleasures of Italian Cooking" Macmillan New York, London 3 slices bacon, cut julienne (pancetta, better yet) 4 tablespoons butter. 1/2 cup julienne-cut prosciutto (Parma prosciutto) 2 egg yolks. 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (Reggiano) 1 pound spaghetti, cooked and drained (Italian imported such as DeCecco or Barilla) Brown the bacon in the butter; mix in the prosciutto until lightly browned. Beat the egg yolks, then stir in 1/4 cup of the cheese. Toss the hot spaghetti with bacon mixture, then immediately with the egg yolk mixture. (personal note: don't let the egg harden) Serve quickly sprinkled with the remaining cheese. Serves: 4-6 (Personal note: No cream, no garlic, no shallots, only fresh ground pepper at pleasure)

Definitely NOT for the cholesterol conscious cook! This was by far the best, and simplest, carbonara I've ever had. Some of the previous reviewers were right, though. It was a little bland. I added some red pepper flakes to the bacon while it was cooking and some more to the sauce. next time I'll probably add some garlic as well

The BEST carbonara recipe I've come across! Just like my mom's! Always a hit, and I've tried them all. For a nice variant, use 1/2 lb of pancetta instead of bacon, and 3/4 parmesean + 1/4 asagio. You won't be disappointed!

This is a great beginner recipe, and allows lots of room for creativity. I have a strong feeling that this will evolve into something spectacular with a little added spice, and a couple days of rest in the refigerator. Always better the second day. Pieropan Soave Classico accompanies this meal very well.

I would make it again, but there would have to be some additions. The recipe as written is bland, so I added more Kosher Salt and Black Pepper, but still wasn't satisfied. My partner finally threw in some hot sauce. Perhaps it needs a bit of flavoring from some sort of herb, like anise, or italian parsley.

Wonderfully rich and delicious. Enjoy a small portion as a first course or small meal. If you're fat-gram obsessed, try Lean Cuisine...just don't tinker with this recipe! As with any pasta dish with few ingredients, this one succeeds only when you use the best quality ingredients (don't even think about using the cheese from the green can!) and don't skimp on the fat. The only change I made was to add a tiny pinch of red pepper flakes to help wake up all the flavors. I believe the original Italian recipe calls for pancetta, but I used the super-rich, super-smoky Nueske bacon with amazing results.

This was the first time i've ever had carbonara and I loved it (but I had nothing to compare it to). I think I"ll add a little extra cream next time though.

Rating: 3
This recipe is the real deal. Not for the calorically faint-hearted but oh so good. Be sure to use top quality imported spaghetti (de Cecco is excellent) and real reggiano parmesan freshly grated. Also REAL cream (not the kind that has "ingredients" like added thickeners!) Finally organic egg yolks (not the chicken concentration-camp-produced kind). Be sure to eat with a good Tuscan red (you'll need its heart-protecting qualities!) Great stuff!

For all you people out there who are so caught up in the awful low-fat/fat-free craze that has seized our ironically overly-fat nation, why the heck are you looking to make carbonara? I'm thankful for the rest of you who appreciate good rich food in moderation (the way it's supposed to be) instead of trying to dumb the recipes down. Blech to bacon bits and "Pro-Slim Tagliatelle", whatever that is.

I have to go back and review this again. After making this once and not liking it, I modified it and it was excellent! I doubled the recipe and used thicker sliced bacon. I was heavy-handed with the cream and it paid off. It will be dry if you don't double the sauce recipe at least. I added an extra 3 egg yolks and it was perfect. Served it for my son's 16th birthday party with the recipe for Fried Chicken (he requested both) from this site, credited to Mrs. Wilkes Boardinghouse Cookbook aand used the White and Milk Chocolate Mousse Cake recipe for the mousse. For the cake I used the Inside Out German Chocolate Cake recipe from this site and the glaze from that recipe modifying it by adding milk chocolate to the semi-sweet in the glaze. Perfect birthday dinner for a teen.

Ummm... "true Italian predecessor"? I have been to Italy many, many times, and this is the most authentic recipe for carbonara sauce I have found in the U.S. Note that is heavier on eggs than most American versions, and that you use egg yolks rather than whole eggs-- which is how it is traditionally made in Rome and the surrounding countryside. I personally love egg yolks, and prefer that this recipe brings out their flavor rather than just the heavy cream flavor that is typical in restaurants in the U.S. (granted, both are decadent elements).

This tastes very much like the spaghetti carbonara I've had in good Italian restaurants in Manhattan. One thing I wonder about: some places serve the dish with peas mixed in. Is this simply a variation on the theme, or are there many varities of carbonara, of which this recipe is only a starting point?

Finally - a carbonara recipe that challenged those I've had in restaurants. I added 2 cloves of garlic with the bacon and I think it made a big difference. Will definately make again.

This carbonara is the best! I've made several other recipes and haven't been nearly as pleased as I was with this one. My s.o. couldn't get enough!! I made a couple of changes though: added 2 minced garlic cloves and one shallot while sauteeing the bacon; added only 3 egg yolks instead of 4; added some cooked fresh peas at the end! Yummy!

This recipe was delicious! I modified it by sauteing the pancetta, shallots and garlic cloves together. Then later, minced the garlic. I used 3 egg yolks instead of 4, and added chopped Italian parsley and ground black pepper to the cream mixture. I would definately make it again.

Incredible! even my husband liked it. See, it's used to be his favorite pasta and i've tried to make it a couple of times before. However, it used to end with a sulking husband who would claim that I promised him Carbonara and he didn't get it :) But yesterday the mircle has happend: he had 2(!) servings! His only (constructive)comment was to use fat (and not lean) bacon. Oh, and I added some shallots and garlic (as someone has suggested before) minus the cream.

I split this recipe in two to serve myself and my boyfriend. Used pancetta with great success, and amended the parmagiana with a spoonful or two of romano to match the bite of the ham. Also, I added some fresh parboiled peas to the mix when combining the dish. Great results... and to all you low carbers out there, I had my portion with Pro-Slim Tagliatelle: a little thicker than with my boyfriend's linguine, but truly delicious!

This was a tasty dish, although not an authentic carbonara (traditionally, it's not prepared w/ cream). I cut back and used three egg yolks and added a little bit of chopped shallots & two garlic cloves, smashed, and then later removed the cloves after they sauteed w/ the bacon. It's saving grace is it's terribly easy to make. I also suggest using market place bacon (thick slabs), rather than pancetta or prosciutto. The thicker the better, for a heartier dish.

My boyfriend, who is extremely picky, LOVED this dish. I followed previous reviewers' advice and used 3 whole eggs, did not fry the bacon in butter or use the drippings, and added an onion. V. quick and easy - takes only as long as it takes the pasta to cook!

I add onion and sliced mushrooms to the bacon. Also, I lightened it by using 3 whole eggs instead of 4 yolks. Seems like everyone rating this recipe has made adjustments in some way or another, so I'd have to say it's a good base to start from--opens a world of possibilities!

A wonderful recipe. A similar one had been published this month in Martha Stewart Living, calling for a whole cup of heavy cream and 2 cups (rather than 1/2 cup) of grated parmesan cheese. I tried that recipe as well -- It was a little on the salty side with 2 cups of cheese AND salt AND bacon, but it's a wonderful way to thicken up the sauce if you like it that way. It's great when you need a rich, comforting meal to enjoy with friends and family with a great bottle of red wine and some italian bread! I'll definitely cook it again.

This got great reviews from my family. I used leftover spaghetti noodles, they heated them up with the sauce. I also used bacon bits because it was too hot a day to fry bacon, next time I'll try it with the bacon to see if it makes any difference.

Carbonara needs freshly ground black pepper, and there is no need to fry the bacon in butter, a portion of the drippings of the bacon and a small amount of light cream are ample when mixed with 3 whole eggs for the sauce. I sometimes add a little chopped onion when I cook the bacon and usually a tiny bit of chopped garlic.

Rating: 3
I thought the idea of frying bacon in butter was silly so I didn't. I also omitted one of the egg yolks and the recipe did not suffer because of that. I thought this was yummy and very reminiscent of a delicious carbonara that I used to get at a neighborhood Italian restaurant in NY.

I omit the butter and heavy cream. I add chopped parsley and lots of fresh ground black pepper.
