A beautiful and delicious pie crust. I sometimes sub a bit of cake flour for some of the all purpose to get a super flakey crust. Either way this is a keeper.

Good and easy recipe, but be judicious with adding the water. The egg already adds liquid, so just a drop too much water and you lose the flakiness.

Unbelievable - no matter how much I mangled rolling out this dough (no less than twice for each disk), it still came out looking and tasting fabulous. It's like a secret weapon: an easy, indestructable, idiot-proof pie crust recipe. You can't be disappointed with this one.

This dough makes an excellent pie crust, so excellent that I'd use it over the crust I've been making for the last 35 years. It pairs wonderfully with the apple-tart cherry pie.

My daughter made this pie in 1997, and ever since I tasted it, this has been MY pie for all special occasions. It is sooo good and so easy. And it looks spectatular on the table. I even have people request it at special holiday dinners. Some family members won't come unless I am bringing one of these pies, or two. Absolutely the best apple pie ever. I even variate it a little and use raisins, for my husband, who doesn't like the cherries, and also dried cranberries. Thank you for a great recipe.
