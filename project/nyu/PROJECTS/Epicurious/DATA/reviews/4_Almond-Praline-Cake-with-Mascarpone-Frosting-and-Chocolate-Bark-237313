I will make this cake again in 100%, but for sure I will reduce it sweetness. Outcome was stunning and have impressed my quests but was too sweet for serving with dessert wine.

This is a truly grand cake befitting a special occasion. I did not find the cake overly sweet and everyone at my event loved the almond flavor. It definitely shined. The frosting is light and compliments the cake well. As another reviewer noted, I was tempted to skip the bark but as it turned out, it was some guests' favorite part.

This cake is divine. Be careful when mixing the frosting. I mixed too quickly and could see tiny pieces of the marscapone. The end result is definately worth the effort.

This is an expensive, time-consuming cake to make, but it is absolutely amazing! Definitely worth it for a special occasion. Deep almond flavor complemented nicely by the ganache filling and light frosting. It took me most of one evening and one morning to put together, so definitely give yourself enough time to make it. If you follow the recipe exactly, you won't be disappointed!

This was the BEST cake I've ever made - absolutely amazing. I use some store-bought almond paste and also mixed up a little of my own in a food processor - and maybe didn't add quite as much sugar here and there -but truly an amazing cake. I'm not a cook, so most of my more ambitious recipes fail, but this one turned out spectacular.

Was this cake expensive to make? Yes...the almond paste alone cost nearly $20. Was it time consuming? Yes. I made it in stages over three days. Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY!!! One of the best cakes I have ever made, if not THE BEST. It had everything: Moist, almond-scented layers, crunchy praline & deep dark chocolate ganache, a smooth and dreamy frosting that whipped up beautifully. Truly wondrous. I am in a sugar afterglow.

I only made the cake part of this recipe. Although quite expensive (because of the almond paste), this dense cake is delicious. I made 2- 8x2" cakes and ended up with a gorgeous 4-layer cake (split and filled). My only complaint is that the center sank a little bit while set to cool.

It looks beautiful when done, a definite WOW factor. Unfortunately for me (and my guests), it was just way too much. The cake was too almondy tasting, and had a grainy unpleasant texture. I always count on these reviews to help in deciding what to try, and I realize I'm a lone voice in my disappointment with this recipe (which I followed faithfully), but I just didn't like it. Maybe I just don't like almond as much as I thought I did...

Hands down the best cake that I have made in a LONG time. Rave reviews across the board. My feedback is that once the sugar starts colouring for the pralines, it continues darkening once it's off the heat. Make sure that you have everything set up to add the almonds and spread them out before you start to make sure that you don't burn the sugar. Defiantly make and assemble the cake (sans pralines) the day before serving, the flavours are WAY more pronounced the day after.

Fantastic recipe, now one of my favorite cakes. The only thing that was hard to make was the praline. I didn't have the heat high enough to boil the sugar before the water boiled off (leaving a hard crystalline deposit in the bottom of a hot pan). I redissolved the sugar and then really turned up the heat and kept brushing the sides of the pan liberally with water to get an amber color after about 15-20 minutes of boiling. The next difficulty was chopping the praline. It was like cutting varnished nuts. Next time, I will try chopping the almonds before mixing them into the melted sugar. I didn't make the chocolate bark, but piped out onto waxed paper some chocolate decorations from a little bit of left-over ganache, froze them and then applied them to the sides of the frosted cake. All the flavors together are truly special. Don't be tempted to skip the praline!

This cake turned out great for a friend's 60th birthday. I doubled the recipe and baked it in 10 inch and 6 inch pans for stacking. The taste was incredible, it was well received, and I would make it again. The only drawbacks was the cost of ingredients and some other small difficulties. I had trouble with the almond praline being hard to deal with but I got it to work. The chocolate ganache set up too hard and I had to put it in the big mixer to get it back to a spreadable consistency. The center of the large cake wasn't cooked right, so next time I'll use my center baking cup with this pan. I also had some issues with the center of the little cakes falling, but I think it's an elevation issue and a matter of flour balance. My favorite part was the mascarpone frosting. I love the flavor and consistency, and it was the highlight of the cake.

I made this for my 17th birthday and everyone loved it! It took me about 5 hours in total to put together... 3 hours to bake the cakes, make the praline, and ganache on one day and 2 more hours to make the frosting chocolate and put it all together. The taste of the cake itself is like a "La galette des Rois" cake, but with the ganache, praline, and mascarpone it's much fancier and delicious. One suggestion is to not use a food processor to chop your praline. I recommend chopping it as the recipe calls for because pulsing them causes the sugar it self to quickly turn into a powder leaving large chunks of almond. Overall awesome cake!

Rating: 3
Amazing cake. The flavors and textures were everything I hoped they would be. I will probably use the mascarpone frosting on other cakes, it's so light and not too sweet. The cake does take some time to make though, make sure you give yourself enough time.

Made this for my Mom's birthday as she is a lover of mazipan. Great cake. Got lots of rave reviews from adults, kids were a little put off (if it's not chocolate..). It was even better the next day, so go ahead and make it a day in advance. Frosting was super easy.

Absolutely delish! Made it for friend's birthday and got rave reviews. Another friend has already asked if I would bake one for her niece's birthday! Definitely a big-deal cake. With some planning, the many steps aren't that time-consuming, and the resulting taste and presentation is definitely worth it! Followed the recipe as is but used 8" cake pans instead. This is a keeper!

I made this for my sister's birthday last month and it was great. People that aren't big cake fans even liked it. First, the cake turns out looking beautiful. Second, the marscapone frosting is very light and a nice departure from heavy buttercream. Finally, the combination of flavors is definitey a winner. Hats off to the chef at Bon Appetit who invented this recipe!

Wonderful! Surprised my husband when he came home from a business trip - he loved it, thought I ordered from a bakery and flipped when I told him it was homemade. I scaled it down by 2/3 and made it into a mini cake for 2. Also added amaretto to the icing and ganache for more flavor. Amazing and worth the effort.

Rating: 4
Brilliant! As others mentioned, many steps, but worth it. Definitely glad I started a day ahead. A very special dessert: the tastes and textures, presentation, the understated sweetness. I skipped the bark also, made my preferred praline recipe, and just piped a lattice of the ganache with crushed praline on top.

One of the best cakes I have ever had. Worth all of the work. I just purchased chocolate bark and used that instead of making that as well.

I only used the frosting recipe, with a different almond cake filled with lemon curd. The frosting is excellent - not very sweet, great flavour, easy to spread. The only downside to it is that it doesn't form a crumb-sealing layer very well.

Rating: 3
The steps in this recipe were fairly easy to follow. I've never made a cake before, so perhaps this isn't really necessary for the experienced baker, but I wish I had known to let the mascarpone come to room temperature before making the frosting. It came out a bit lumpy and I had to let it warm before beating again and the texture was not ideal (but still tasty). I also blanched some almonds and made my own paste because the product in the store was rather expensive. Everyone did enjoy this cake and it is impressive looking.

This cake is awesome!! My boyfriend made it for my birthday and it was quite special. There are many components but not too complicated. If you love almond paste (i do) then this is the cake for you!

Rating: 3
I thought the cake itself was delicious - very almondy and with a good crumb. However, with fine bittersweet chocolate, the ganache was not sweet enough to match the cake. Furthermore, the mascarpone frosting was not sweet in the least and didn't seem to complement the cake well. I'm not sure what would go best with the tasty cake, but I'm thinking perhaps the ganache and some raspberry sauce? Overall, a recipe that was almost sublime.

Rating: 4
This cake gets rave reviews each time I make it. There's a lot of components but the recipe is very easy to follow. If you need to ditch something, the praline isn't really necessary, as the cake/frosting/ganache is delicious; the praline is a very nice component and looks great, but can be passed if you don't have the time or energy for it. The frosting on this cake is probably my favorite frosting ever. Highly recommended and worth the effort.

Rating: 4
I made my own almond paste, like another reviewer suggested, and used half semisweet and half unsweetened baking chocolate in the ganache. I had some ganache left over. The cake came out great. I stored the leftovers in the fridge, and it was even better the next day, perhaps because the memory of all the work involved had faded... Every bit of this cake was delicious though, so I am thinking that for a minimalist variation I might make one layer of cake, frost it with the ganache, and sprinkle it with the praline and bark.

Rating: 3
I used the almond cake layers from this recipe to make a cake for my son's birthday. After careful review from other contributor's, I decided to decrease the almond paste to 2 tubes and use one jar of Baker's almond cake filling. Bakers is an excellent product. The cake was not too dense as described in other reviews. It received incredible praise from my guests. I brushed a layer of warmed raspberry jam between each layer of cake and substituted white chocolate almond filling in place of the ganache. Delicious. Considering trying a canolli filling next time.Any thoughts ?

I just made this for my Son's 37th Birthday and it was incredibly delicious. I had a difficult time getting the praline not to clump. I couldn't put the praline on top of the ganache because of the thickness so I used my mini chopper and sprinkled it on top. I also sprinkled some on the chocolate bark which looked nice on top of the cake. The next time I will put the chopped almonds in a single layer on the cookie sheet and then pour the hot sugar/water mixture over the nuts. I thank the person who advised chopping the roasted almonds before making the praline. That was a huge help.

This was a phenomenal cake. I have made it twice already. The only troublesome aspect was incorporating the almond paste into the batter. I had to run my hand mixer (I don't own a stand) through the batter several times before I got a smooth texture. Eventually I found that microwaving the almond paste several pieces at a time, until it was pliable enough, helped significantly. Aside from the cake, everything else was very easy to make and put together. Mind you, while I thought the cake was perfect, my family felt that the amount of ganache overwhelmed the almond cake layers. When I made it the second time, I halved the amount of ganache and they much preferred it that way. As well, for the second time around, I used cream cheese as a substitute for the mascarpone in the frosting and it worked fine. The chocolate bark and almond praline are easy to make, and the leftovers make a great garnish for sundaes. I used dark chocolate Lindt for the first cake and the second time around, Scharffenberger (62% cocoa). Both were exceptional in taste but next time I will use a higher cocoa content as I prefer the slight bitter edge they lend.

I was looking for a beautiful and delicious cake to make for my DS' bday and came across this cake thanks to a review on the chow boards. This fit the bill perfectly. Mine came out looking exactly like the photo and was soooo yummy. I broke up the steps into a couple nights - the first night, i baked the layers, and made the praline and the chocolate bark. The next day, I made the ganache at lunchtime. That evening, I made the frosting, and assembled it, and we ate it the following day. For those of you who said this is too sweet/candy-like, I wonder if you purchased marzipan paste accidentally instead of almond paste. At my grocery store, they were right next to each other so it would be an easy mistake to make. I didn't find it overly sweet; it was just perfect. I loved the texture of the cake, very moist and so flavorful. The frosting was light and not very sweet at all. A keeper and this may be the new required bday cake in my house!

I'm not a baker, but this came out lovely and impressive. I made home made almond paste (recipe on this site) to save some $. The cake and frosting are definitely not too sweet. I even added extra sugar to the frosting to give it a little more flavor. I had way too much frosting and will try it with only 1 container of mascarpone and 1 cup of cream next time. My ganache was a perfect consistency after @ 3 hours of chilling. I expected a little more flavor from the cake. But if you like your cake mellow and not too sweet, this is a keeper!

Almond paste is usually less sweet than marzipan. I checked in the store and marzipan lists sugar as the first ingredient where almond paste has almonds. I am making this cake for my mother's birthday today. I will let you know how it turns out.

I thought this cake was fantastic, and my boyfriend loved it as well. I did not think the cake was too sweet, but I did use high quality bittersweet chocolate for the ganache (70% cocoa) rather than semisweet which I think could have helped. This cake is not hard to put together, but does take some time. It is beautiful when its done, though!

Since some complained of overly candy like almond flavor, do you think almond butter could be substituted for the almond paste?

Rating: 3
I made this cake exactly as directed except for the chocolate bark...I just ran out of steam. The ganache, frosting and praline were all amazing. The cake, while a lovely color and texture, was just a bit too flowery and "marzipan-y" for me. It was a little like candy! All in all, it was time-consuming yet easy, but for the cost of the almond paste, I probably won't make this again. Too many other interesting cakes to try!

I'm rating the frosting only. Couldn't be easier to make or more fun to work with, though probably is not a good hot weather candidate if transporting to a gathering. The taste is light, not too sweet and perfect for the Almond Cake w/ Kirsch (this site).

If you are thinking this cake is too challenging, it's not! I made the whole thing in one evening. It took four hours, but the recipe is perfect. The cake came together beautifully. The one nitpick I have, is that the cake is VERY almondy--a heavy marzipan taste rather than a light almond. I also found the consistency of the cake to be a bit drier than I thought it would be. If I make it again, I would cut down on the amount of almond paste. And yes, it is expensive. Mine cost $67!!

This cake was such a joy (and challenge) to make. After having my first baby, I was itching to get back to baking after 10 weeks. This was the best challenge to prove I could still "bring it." My husband talks about this dessert 6 months later and has asked me to do it again for Thanksgiving. Those compliments alone are worth the effort.

This cake was a lot of work but really worth it. I "finished" it by drizziling a chocolate-merlot syrup over the top of everything. I made it for a friend's birthday and it was a big hit.

This was a very fun cake to make. I actually made it 7 layers. I baked three normal layers and one short layer and cut the three normal layers in half to match the short one. I used a very thin layer of ganache between the layers so it would not be overly chocolaty. It complimented the rich almond paste flavor perfectly. I also did not put the praline in between the layers I thought it might be distracting. The cake was great only using the praline on top and along the bottom of the frosted cake. It was a huge hit at my husbands 30th birthday party.

This is an AMAZING recipe. I made it for my parent's dinner party and everyone loved it. Even though I'm only 14, the recipe was pretty easy to understand, excluding the fact that I under-cooked the praline the first time. But I must warn you, if you don't like exceedingly rich cakes, or hate the taste of almonds, this cake is definately not for you.

This was the best cake I ever made. I got many compliments for this cake. I left the ganache in my refrigerator for 6 hours and assembling the cake was fine. I thought that I might have burned the pralines, because it tasted bitter, but it went well with the cake.

Rating: 3
I would of loved to give this recipe a 4 fork, but assembling the cake was quite difficult. Perhaps the ganache was too soft and the cakes were sliding all over the ganache. I couldn't get the frosting smooth, so it turned out lumpy. I really really hope this tastes good because I won't make it again if it isn't. It's too bad, I was looking forward to making this cake.

This was a true celebration cake. Many oohs and aahs when I brought it to the table and everyone loved it. All the components work well together. The cake is almondy and moist. I'm going to find other uses for the marscapone frosting -- it was great, not too sweet. The praline added a touch of sweetness and crunch. And I didn't think I'd like the chocolate in there but it really added to everything. I was going to skip drizzling the chocolate over the top to save time, but I'm really glad I did it. Looked great. All of the components could be made ahead. Except that I would make the marscapone frosting the day of serving and would asssemble everything then. My ganache got a little too hard, but I just heated it over hot water a bit and beat it until it was smooth and the right texture. Chopping the praline took a little time. Could probably be done in a food processor. In response to the question, this cake would not hold up for 4 or 5 days -- just too long. Plus, you wouldn't be able to resist cutting into it. I will definitely be making this again,

This is a fabulous cake, and really worth the time (it doesn't take 6 hours like the recipe says!)I would consider skipping the chocolate bark too, although that makes for a stunning presentation.

I rarely bake, which may account for the relative difficulty I had judging when these cakes were done. Part of my problem was that I used two pans instead of three, so my layers were substantially thicker than they should have been and took nearly an hour to bake completely. This recipe took me several hours to make and I skipped the chocolate ganache as I thought it would be too rich for my husband and myself. Bottom line for this recipe is that it is incredible!! The frosting tastes like softened vanilla ice cream and the cake is heavenly. The almond bark added enough chocolate to escalate this dessert to perfection without being too rich. We are not cake people but we love this dessert!

Really good flavors. The marscapone frosting with the praline, even after a couple days is great. I also made two layers (with five eggs) and it was more than enough for five people. Next time I would chop the toasted almonds alot before making the praline and I wouldn't add sugar to the chocolate filling. Just a plain 6oz chocolate to 3/4cup cream ganache, double for three layers. The great thing about leftover praline in that your can blend it in a food processor into sweet almond butter and then whip with whipped cream to make a great filling for eclairs, paris breast...

Decadent and delightful, rich and satisfying, the almond praline cake was my Sunday adventure. The recipe is involved, but none of the steps are complicated. I made two layers instead of three and used all of the ganache between the two layers. The cake came out beautifully, looking just like the picture. Cut small slices, it's very rich!
