I salvaged the cookie mess. Took the surviving cookies and layered them in a small serving dish with vanilla ice cream in between each layer of cookies.3 cookies on the bottom (they're soft so they can be shaped to line the dish), ice cream, more cookies, and so on....

I chilled it overnight....stayed sticky and really unmanageable. Could not roll it, it stuck to parchment, at least half were wasted. This is one I will never make again.

I also found this recipe wanting. The dough was too soft to roll into balls even after chilling for 3 hours. I also found the flavor a little bland.

The flavor was good, but the dough was very sticky and hard to roll into balls. Some came out nice and crinkled on top, and some didn't. Skip this one.

This was delicious! I followed the directions, but I think since I didn't put enough flour, the cookies just spread out when I baked them. I loved how they tasted, but I decided to make a mini-cake with the left over dough I had. I put the dough in a ramekin, decided to make caramelized bananas (more like a recipe I love for bananas foster), toasted some walnuts, out it on top of the cake, and viola my boyfriend and I had a wonderful dessert! I'll try this recipe again, it is a keeper!!

Really soft and delicious. I made the following substitutions based on what I did and didn't have in the kitchen: 1)Fresh minced ginger in place of ground ginger (I used 4 tsp, but they didn't have as much of a ginger flavor as I would have liked) 2)More cinnamon instead of cloves and nutmeg 3)3/4 c brown sugar and a little less than 1/4 c honey instead of molasses. Still delicious!

These came out just as advertised, soft ginger cookies. I wanted to make something that didn't require an electric beater (or the tedium of creaming sugar by hand) and these were just the ticket. The house didn't have a lot of spices, so to save money I used an apple pie spice mix and ground ginger which worked nicely. I don't know if it was the apple pie spice mix or not, but I think these would be lovely with some chewy apple bits mixed in.

I am a novice baker, an expert taster. These cookies were fantastic - soft on the inside, just like I wanted. I added an extra teaspoon of powdered ginger like the others said, and subtracted a bit of the other spices. I rolled the dough balls in powdered sugar before they baked. Brought them to a Christmas party last night and there were many a gingerbread expert who said the cookies were great! I'm going to make them for Christmas just as my family arrives to make the house feel warm and homey.

I think there was too much molasses for these cookies and not enough ginger...

Absolutely fantastic soft cookies. I added a half cup whiskey soaked golden raisons to the mix and drizzled them with whiskey icing made from powdered sugar, butter, milk, and the remaining whiskey from soaking the raisons. Will maked them over and over again.

Great cookies. Don't understand the mixed reviews. This much clove, nutmeg and ginger, no way are they bland. If they're sticky refrigerate longer. Suggest using 50/50 Crisco/margarine split.

These cookies were good. I did not roll them in balls, or sugar.... just spooned the dough on the cookie sheet. I thought they were good- soft old fashioned cookies...

These cookies turned out great. I added an additional tsp of ground ginger and some pieces of candied ginger. Lovely flavor and texture. Also substituted 1 of the cups of flour with cake flour, not on purpose, it was all I had.

The cookies came out very well. As other reviewers mentioned, the cookies were impressively soft. I doubled the amount of ginger and substituted corn oil (vol/vol) for the vegetable shortening. Even the trans fat free vegetable shortening called for by the recipe had some trans fat (hydrogenated oils).

Sticky Mess! Martha Stewart's Recipe is much better. Don't waste your time on this.

A very good ginger cookie. Used butter instead of shortening and sprinkled sugar rather than rolling the cookies. The family loved them!

Unlike many molasses cookies, these don't become overly crisp. They are soft and chewy on the inside. Because I didn't want the molasses to overpower the cookies, I reduced it to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of milk.

Very nice cookie. Needs more ginger, than the 1 teaspoon. Definitely better the next day. Bake for 10 minutes, 12 is too much.

This cookie definitely needed more ginger, and maybe a little less of all the other spices. When I went to mix it, it clumped together awfully in the mixer despite being chilled for several hours. i'd recommend perhaps chilling it overnight if anyone else has had that problem. I'd make em again though. They were a hit.

I'll definitely get a marriage proposal from these! My boyfriend thought these were the BEST ginger cookies he's ever eaten. I usually keep the dough refrigerated at least 12 hours before baking. Absolutely delicious and melt in your mouth.

These cookies are tasty and attractive. However, the dough was VERY sticky after being refridgerated which made it difficult to manage.

I made these cookies last year and gave some away in an assorted cookie tray. This year I tried a different recipe for ginger/molasses cookies and was really disappointed. I will go back to these again next year. They remind me so much of a cookie my dear grandmother used to make.

A grown up gingerbread cookie - soft, tasty, perfect with tea and not overly sweet. Flavors seemed to improve on the second day.

Most likely I screwed this up somewhere, but even doubling the ginger, these cookies are bland. The good news is, the recipe's easy.

These are really tasty--soft, sweet, and spicy. They tend to soften up and stick together if you store them for a couple of days, so next time I'll put them between sheets of wax paper.

This is my new favorite ginger cookie recipe. Perfect flavor, perfect texture. The dough is quite sticky, even after chilling. I had to drop it by the teaspoonful into the sugar and then roll it into a ball. A bit cumbersome, but worth it!

Very good,used more ginger, because I like it. Good keepers, stayed soft.

Nicely spicey, although next time I might up the ginger and decrease the cloves. Very easy, too -- and even easier if you line the pan with parchment paper. To the previous reviewer, there's about 1 minute between chewy and cakey, so don't leave them in a second too long...

These were okay cookies, easy to make. I have another ginger cookie recipe that I like better. I found these a bit too cakey . I like ginger cookies to be soft and chewy.

These are delicious and fast Ginger bread cookies. I appreciated that they did not have to be rolled out and cut. They were a bit hard at first but then softened up over night. Delicious!
