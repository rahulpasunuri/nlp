This is the best banana cake I have ever baked and ate. Very moist and delicious.

Good recipe although I would add more banana, make it more moist.

Results were too egg-y. Also, recipe doesn't call for enough flour. Fresh out of the oven, cake was very greasy - wouldn't hurt to reduce olive oil or butter a little. Also, could use half to one whole banana more. Recipe as is needs tweaking.

I am not normally a fan of banana bread but this recipie was fantastic. It was moist, rich and full of banana flavour. I served it with fresh strawberries and a brown sugar creme anglaise. What a fantastic summer dessert! So simple to make too! This recipie is a keeper!

I hated this recipe! WAY too buttery tasting, no flavor. A waste of time and ingrediants.

To everyone who's confused about whether this is a cake or a loaf: In France, the word "cake" is used to describe what we would call loaf or bread. E.g: cake aux amandes, cake aux raisins, these are really loaves.

I find this very bland, compared to the average banana bread. Toasting does help.

I have just made this for the second time,both times I've loved it.This time I iced with chocolate ganache and if you can wait for it to cool,I know its hard,I recommend it.I really believe the olive oil should not be excluded,use a good quality fruity extra virgin.I don't have the eloquence to explain why but it just seems to enhance the banana flavour.Smell the oil alone and it actually has a banana like nose.To the cooks who found it too dense,sounds like overmixing to me,be really quick,this is a quickbread recipe.

Made as written, but added about a cup and a half of chopped pecans to the batter. As previously mentioned,it's more of aead or tea cake. I don't know how it is after the first hour out of the oven, as the 6 kids in my house right now have just eaten the last of it! I got a slice to taste). Incredibly easy (I keep ripe bananas in the freezer for that spur of the moment craving), and great taste.

Very simple to make; moist and not too sweet. A definite one for the busy mother, short on time but wishing to bake treats for the family.

To the reviewer from Wilmette, it's not a good idea to substitute the fat in a pastry recipe with a liquer or an extract. They are not interchangeable as they perform different tasks. One is a flavor enhancer only while fat is what provides mouthfeel and carries the flavor to your tastebuds. Baked goods and pastries can be tricky and one should only alter recipes when they have plenty of experience on how to do so (unless you don't mind wasting time & money by throwing out many mistakes.)

This lady's opnion is: SCRUMPTIOUS!! I did make a couple of minor changes. I used applesauce instead of oil and added it in with the bananas, which I doubled. Because of the fruit increase, I used butter-flavored shortening and flour on my pan. Butter contains 20% water, and I wanted to decrease the liquid content. I also whipped the sugar and butter until very light and sifted the flour mixture twice. This got alot of air into the batter, really lightened the cake and made the mixing easier. I made an extra one for a friend of mine who says he doesn't like cake. Geeeeez, I love it when men beg!!

To the cook from Wilmette, PLEASE do not rate recipes you have not even tried.

To the cooks in Wilmette, Il and Los Angeles: the reason the writer mentions a whole case of bananas and only uses one banana on the recipe is obvious. He is François Payard, one of the best known patissiers on the world. He has a bakery, so he probably made a whole batch of cakes with that case. For us, one banana suffices. Hope it helps.

I agrre with the reviewer from Wilmette Il, if the author of this recipe had a CASE of bananas, then he must have made alot of cakes! This turned out like banana bread and not a CAKE!

I added a cup of chocolate chips, delicious, also served it with sauted bananas!

I used only half a tsp. of vegtable oil (not olive), and 3 eggs plus one egg white. Good cake over all, heavier than most cakes, very tasty. A bit eggy, maybe more flour would make it better. I'm sure I'll try it again. Very simple.

Far too greasy. Too much butter, olive oil? Not enough flour? Something wrong somewhere. Mistake in the printed recipe?

Great, easy recipe. It tasted a little too much like olive oil, so I use only half the amount and its much better and still very moist!

I have not (yet) tried this recipe, but I have a few reactions after just reading it; first, the author had to use up a CASE of bananas, yet this loaf calls for only one! He calls it a cake but as it is a loaf, my first thought is to compare it to banana bread. It is obviously much richer than that. I would consider substituting banana liqueur for the olive oil; why interfere with the buttery banana flavor? I would also add nuts. Who knows, I may even try this thing!

Too buttery for my taste!

This is an easy recipe. If you like banana bread, you will LOVE this banana cake. I brought it to the office to share, and it was like throwing it to piranhas. Gone in no time!
