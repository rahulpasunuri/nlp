This was our Thanksgiving pumpkin pie. I couldn't find plum preserves so we used currant jelly instead. I also made a gluten-free gingersnap crust instead of the pastry crust. The flavors are delicious. When you bite into it, the tartness of the currants is a pleasant surprise.

Perfect dessert for the finale of an autumnal dinner, wish I had spread more plum preserves on the bottom, terrific taste treat! B.J. Harrick

This is our new traditional pumpkin pie. The plum jam provides a wonderful counterpoint to the pumpkin. Using a tart pan makes service brilliantly easy!

I'm a novice baker (working without all the tools -- used a wine bottle for a rolling pin) and this turned out perfectly. The crust worked out well and was fairly easy to work with and the filling was delicious. The only issue with the tart is that it isn't a classic pumpkin pie. The damson was delicious and made for an interesting combination however if you're looking for the classic pumpkin, you shouldn't bother with this recipe.

I did not like this tart at all! The damson perserves imparted a strange tartness that did not balance well with the pumpkin layer. I much prefer traditional pumpkin pie. I will not make this again.

This was easier than it looks and was a huge hit. I microwaved the jam for a minute to melt to make spreading easy. Would definitely make again, a nice change to the traditional...which I made as well for those who insist!

This one is a winner! Forget those heavy pumpkin sludge pies typically associated with Thanksgiving...I almost "forgot" to pack the last piece with my guests' doggey bag. This recipe is perfect as written if you want a light, balanced flavor unecumbered by excess 'pumpkin spice'. The damson plum jam is a wonderful foil for the slightly sweet pumpkin.

This is a terrific pumpkin tart. Don't save it for (just) Thanksgiving. The crust was more than sufficient and I used the leftovers to bake a small apple tart at the same time. Instead of plum jam, I used cherry preserves. A thin layer was plenty. I did have to cook the tart a bit longer, but that will depend on your oven.

This was the first tart I ever made from scratch and it was a huge hit. I followed the recipe exactly (just to be safe) and used Bonne Maman damson plum jam. 12 of us shared small slices on Thanksgiving and we were so enthusiastic, I baked 2 more of them the following weekend for other guests, who also loved it. I think Ruth Reichl was right: this may be the best pumpkin pie.

the pumpkin mixture was delicious, the plum jam not so, and it made the crust soggy (or perhaps my oven isn't working well, but the edges of the crust were delicious), it presented well

I thought this was nice but not better than the traditional version. I found the magenta stripe of plum jam to be overkill. I like my pumpkin pie sweet and not as tart as the plum made this turn out. It was well recieved by everyone but I still have some left so it couldn't have been that good. I doubt I will make this again.

This tart looked beautiful and the crust was delicious, but the filling was a little too sweet for my taste. I used the damson plum jam from Stonewall Kitchens - next time I make this I'll experiment with another brand to bring down the sweetness factor a little bit.

This is good and I plan to serve it for Thanksgiving. Recipe has a few issues: pastry not sufficient for an 11-inch tart (1-1/2x next time will be easier to roll out). Not a super spicy filling, but nice and delicate, and the plum jam is a great touch. Definitely needs more like 1-1/2 cups to make an even, visible layer. Yummy!

Oops, forgot to add that I paired it with the apple calvados ice cream from the 9/97 Gourmet - a huge hit.

I will definitely make this one again, my husband loved it. Definitely go with extra preserves - I agree about one cup. The crust gets rolled thin so it has a nice crunch to pair with the smooth filling.

How Ruth Reichle can say this is the best pumpkin pie she's ever had is beyond me. At best, this was good, but not great. The combination of damson plum jam and pumpkin was underwhelming.

I couldnt wait to make this one. I had trouble finding the jam locally but finally got it at Chef Shop. Be forewarned: their brand contains pits! I had to spread the jam by hand, carefully seeking out the pits before baking. I baked per the instructions, but the tart was still a little jiggly at serving time. I chilled the remainder over night, and the next day, the tart had the consistency that I had hoped for. A little more firm and easier to slice nicely. When chilled, the tart was fantastic. I served it with an Amaretto-flavored whipped cream.

Not bad. Needs a thicker layer of plum preserves (1 C or so), but the pumpkin filling is good.
