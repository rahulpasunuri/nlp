I used good quality ingredients, but we thought this was too sweet, and the chocolate to pb ratio seemed a bit off. Won't make again.

A keeper for sure! So easy and everyone LOVED it. I am going to be making this EVERY Christmas! There wasn't one piece left....

These were ridiculously easy and very crowd-pleasing. I agree with the reviewer who recommends letting it sit 10 minutes before trying to cut it into squares - otherwise, the top breaks and perfectionists (like moi) will be dismayed at the misshapen pieces. Otherwise, this is very hard to mess up.

The first time I made it I skimped on the quality of the white chocolate and it was pretty horrible. I saw the potential though and tried again the next day with Ghiradelli, and it's delicious. Very rich...

Wow! These are good. Very rich, very easy. Used Ghiardelli chocolate and gave some as an Easter gift. I agree that coffee is a must have here!

Delicious. Addictive.

Luscious. Easy. Memorable. Use really great chocolate (I used Heilemann from Germany). Before you cut them, do two things. First, let it set for 10-15 minutes to avoid breaking. Second, make coffee!! Really wonderful stuff.

Loved this, so easy to make my 10 years old son practically did it alone. We made ours in individual candy cups. They were meant as gifts but they were so good we could't resist...guess we'll have to make another batch.

I am a caterer in Portland, Oregon. We are always looking for easy, yet unique finger food desserts. This recipe really fits that criteria. Easy to make - unique looking - easy to multiply for larger groups. Definitely an addition to our catering portfolio.
