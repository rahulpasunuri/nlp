this is a fantastic dessert - and so easy! I have made it twice in the last few weeks. The first time I used port as the sweet wine, which gave a gorgeous pink colour and subtle flavour, and served it on purchased meringues with mixed berries on top. The second time, I happened to have some left over champagne (!?!) so rather than pour it away I tried it in this recipe and it was out-of-this-world! Delicious flavour and the most amazing frothy texture. I will definitely make this again - it's a foolproof dessert that takes less than 10 minutes and looks and tastes so impressive.
