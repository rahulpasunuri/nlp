This was excellent. I didnt add the prosciutto because I dont like it and it is too salty. I followed the recipe all the way and after I buttered the dish I added the asparagus, and tossed it with olive oil and added the bread crumb mixture on top. Roasted in the oven and it was yum!!

I served this recipe for a Christmas Eve dinner and it was a huge success. I would absolutely make it again. I made the bread crumbs in advance so it was easy to put it all together.

Obviously, this recipe was a bit more work than simply wrapping the asparagus in prosciutto (which is delicious on its own). The saltiness depends on the prosciutto - as it "crisps," it loses moisture, but keeps its salt. So if it is a large piece, and on the saltier side, you may want to wrap with only one slice. Also, minced garlic cooks VERY quickly... so by the time I added the breadcrumbs, the garlic was on its way to bitter. I didn't "toast" the breadcrumbs as much as the recipe suggested (due to the garlic), but at least the garlic wasn't ruining the dish. I'd make this again, as I liked what the flavored breadcrumbs added to the dish.

This makes a great tapas or appetizer. I double or quadruple the recipe and use panko instead of dried breadcrumbs. You do not need to precook the asparagus. They can be roasted a few minutes, removed from the oven, allowed to cool slightly and then wrap into bundles with prosciutto. Lay bundles side by side and sprinkle panko mixture across the prosciutto portion of the bundles. These are good hot or cold.

I've had this at the restaurant and it was delicious and made it at home, also. I do leave out the salt, but it completely depends on the type of bread you're using for the crumbs and you have to be sure to use UNSALTED butter, like the recipe calls for. The textures are wonderful and the flavor is fantastic.

This recipe was a total waste of time.I should have been warned by the other reviews ! I only used one slice of prosciutto but it was too salty and the crumbs didn't add anything to it at all.

I used very thin asparagus and did not add any salt. Everyone loved it. It dressed up the asparagus and tasted delicious.

I thought this dish was terrible. It was alot of work to make normally good tasting asparagus taste awful. I made it with easter dinner and I noticed most people either scraped the bread crumb mixture off and ate the asparagus alone or didn't take a second bite at all. My suggestion is leave the delicious asparagus plain or butter & salt & pepper don't waste the time.

One slice of proscuitto is sufficient. And I thought the whole dish was too salty, I wouldn't add any salt to the breadcrumbs again. Don't get me wrong, it really was delicious and I will definitely keep making this , with these minor adjustments.

This was a quick, easy and delicious recipe, a fancy version of an asparagus accompaniment to a meal. I had very young and thin asparagus spears, so I blanched them for a minute only, and they were perfect when the recipe was done.
