My family suggested that this recipe go straight to my collection of "Greatest Hits". I didn't read the reviews, and have a cup and a half of oil left over. Hope it will be good on pasta, salads, etc. Our local Whole Foods did not have San Simon, but recommended the smoked gouda everyone else seems to have used. Great recipe! (Even without the chervil, which I forgot.)

The foundation of this recipe is a great idea for a summer salad. I followed earlier recommendations and used less olive oil. I roasted red organic cherry tomatoes. And mixed in smaller, fresh orange cherry tomatoes, Israeli cousous that was sauteed with sliced shallots, and some grilled fresh white corn. Instead of green onions I used chives with the chevril and throw some shredded basil. The smoke gouda was nice, but I think next time I'll try some smoked ricotta salata cheese.

Excellent! Lovely-tasting tomatoes, and the dressing is exquisite!

I've made this quite a few times now and it's always awesome. I've never found St Simon cheese but smoked gouda is perfect anyway. I've tried with both cherry and grape tomatoes and the smaller ones work better. They don't fall apart easily when the final mixture is prepared and they are the right size for a single bite when you get carmelized tomato, a fresh tomato and a piece of cheese all together. Also, 2 cups of oil is overkill unless you plan to use the extra for a salad or something. I put a layer of tomoatoes in the pan and then just cover with olive oil, about 1 cup, and then use all of it in the dressing for this dish.

This recipe is always a winner. Everyone asks for the recipe after serving to friends or family.

I made this for a dinner party last weekend and my foodie friends raved about it! It was difficult to find the San Simon, so I used an aged gouda that had some smokiness to it. It's in my permanent collection.

This salad is exceptional. My friends are asking me when I'm going to make it again. I did substitute the smoked gouda and an excellent balsamic vinegar for the sherry.

These were fantastic. They do need to be tossed very gently when adding the fresh tomatoes to avoid destroying the carmelized ones. Great combination of texture, color and flavor. While the total time is relatively long due to the slow cooking, the actual preparation couldn't be easier.

Terrific flavor. I found that the roasted tomatoes, upon tossing with the fresh tomatoes, totally disintegrated so in the end I had fresh tomatoes floating in a kind of slurry (albeit a tasty slurry). Next time I plan to roast all of the tomatoes, but for a slightly less time so they don't completely come apart.

OMG WOW!!! These caramelized tomatoes are one of the best things i have ever tasted. I can't wait to make a huge batch of these and jar them away.
