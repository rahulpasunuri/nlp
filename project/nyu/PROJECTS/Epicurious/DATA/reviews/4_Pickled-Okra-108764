Original recipe: 1 lb okra + 2 2.5-inch green hot peppers [halved/seeded] OR [or 0.5 t red pepper flakes] + 4 garlic cloves + 2 cups cider vinegar + 0.5 cup water + 1 T dill seed + 1 T salt + 2 t mustard seed. Me, I'd crush the garlic, would use any fresh hot pepper...bird, cayenne, habanero [1 only]. serrano, thai, etc...and would seed only a habanero.

Mmm...used a good quality sherry vinegar from Spain. Positively addictive!

Received some okra in a farm box from an organic co-op. Never cared for the stuff cooked, and didn't know what else to do with it so I tried this pickling recipe. The results are fantastic! They are tangy, briny with just a touch of heat. Such a delicious surprise. Hmmm now I wish i had more of that organic okra...

LOVE this recipe. Since I had never pickled or canned anything before, I especially appreciated the detailed directions. Everyone who has tasted the result appreciates them too!

Excuse me, WHY did this just come up when I searched for candy recipes??? I love okra as much as anyone else, but now I'm picturing it all sugary and sparkly like a sugar plum. Weird...

I used the recipe for the first time with white husk garlic and it came out great. The second time I used it I used purplish tinted colored garlic and the garlic turned BLUE. I see nothing wrong with eating them, but thought I should throw that out there. I was the talk of my family.

I have made this recipe repeatedly over the years and it has converted a number of okra haters. (Tip: The original recipe calls for 2 21/2 fresh green peppers or 1/2 tsp. of dried pepper flakes.) This is an excellent recipe worthy of the holiday table.
