I used red, medium-spicy taco sauce and the dish has a nice zing to it. This recipe makes a huge amount, so be ready for leftovers!

I love this recipe. The only change that I made was that instead of the green taco sauce I used a Chipotle taco sauce. It gave the salad a nice zing and flavor. My family loves it.

This pasta salad was too blah. I did use the red taco sauce like one reviewer had suggested. The flavors just didn't blend well together. I ended up adding some grated cheddar cheese and sour cream just to get through it. For two people, I would half this recipe, it makes a ton!

So easy to make, very tasty, light and healthy! Substitute red taco sauce for green. Marinate chicken in Italian dressing, cook, chop, and add to salad.

For me this was just ok. The market was sold out of rotisserie chicken so I had to make my own. I actually baked some chicken breast in salsa. I don't like raw onions so I actually threw them in with the chicken and cooke dthem too. I agree with another cook who said this was fine for a quick weeknight dinenr, but maybe not for company. It serves its purpose...light, quick, easy. Tasty...but not wonderful.

I liked this as a base recipe. I swaped the hominy for corn like another reviewer. I also added chopped jalapenos. Very good and easy. Great for a weekday meal.

This is a good base recipe. I admit, however, that my favorite way to make this is to swap the hominy for corn, and add a dollop of ranch dressing in addition to the taco sauce. I also give it a generous grind of fresh black pepper.

This is fine for a weeknight dinner--comes together quickly and is fine as a leftover lunch the next day. I wouldn't serve it to guests, though.

As others have suggested, I substituted corn for the hominy, and added a can of diced green chiles and diced avocado. Delicious as leftovers, too.

This has been great for parties where we've had a crowd. I use a can of garbanzo beans and a can of kidney beans instead of hominy and black beans. I also use the whole rotissiere chicken. Have had many requests for this recipe and my kids love it too!

We loved this recipe. Used less pasta than 1# and more chicken (a whole rotisserie chicken torn into pieces).

I made half of this with the taco sauce it called for and the other half with ranch dressing mixed with jalapeno flavored barbecue sauce. My husband and I like the ranch/barbecue sauce better. I would definitely make this again. Fresh jalapenos would be terrific in this, and I also used regular corn instead of the hominy.

I loved this dish! I adore cilantro, and I still found that this reciped required a bit too much. I would add more tomatoes, chicken, and black beans next time. I also added tabasco and black olives. It smelled terrific and was so yummy.

this recipe is pretty good i will probably make it again.

This dish is ok, but the flavors are a bit bland. Nice textures, but no real "zip" even though I used a tomatilla/serrano pepper sauce. Sort of a boring dish, although I did receive complements. Will probably choose something else to make next time.

My husband and I loved this recipe. Used canola oil instead of the olive oil and frozen white corn instead of hominy. Will definitely make it again!

Took this dish to monthly cooking class. Though very easy to make and feeds a bunch...I found the flavors bland. Used corn oil and corn as suggested but still feel it neede a "Kick"! Would be O.K. for a potluck or picnic but, nothing special. Would not make again!

Excellent dish...Next time I would add a little more chicken and tomatoes, and slightly less cilantro. I agree that corn or canola oil is better suited to this dish than olive oil.

Great dish. One thing I'll change next time. The olive oil isn't right- should be corn oil.

easy to make and very popular with the party-goers; perfect for a tailgate! I, too, prefer corn (canned is fine) to hominy. this is a large recipe, a half batch is plenty for a party of 10-15.

This salad was a big hit with my tennis group. I omitted the chicken and added sliced black olives and feta cheese. I also added a half cup of Santa Barbara roasted garlic salsa. Very good!!!

This pasta salad was great! Very easy and quick to make. Brought some for lunch next day, holds up great. I subsituted fresh corn ( boiled, at same time, diffrent pot, as the pasta..so no wasted time.

For the cook from New Zealand, hominy is corn that has been chemically treated (with kerosene, I think - if you can imagine that!). It's very bland tasting, soft, wet, and kind of puffy. You might try substituting garbanzo beans or regular corn.

This is a good quick dish, but make sure you have a bowl big enough! It makes alot.

This pasta salad was a big hit with my family. It was bright, colorful and tangy. I would replace the hominy with kernel corn next time. It would be a great dish to take to a pot-luck buffet.
