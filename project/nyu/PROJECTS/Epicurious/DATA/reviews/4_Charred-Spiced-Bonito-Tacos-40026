Wow, this was absolutely delicious. I was so surprised by how flavorful it was. This was despite making a couple changes -- using yellow bell pepper instead of the radish (the grocery store was out of radishes and I thought peppers would add a similar crunch and sweetness) and using storebought jalapeno-lime salsa instead of the homemade one. I also made only a small quantity of the rub since I wasn't sure what I could do with 3 1/2 cups of it. I used 5 garlic cloves, 2 chiles, salt and omitted the oregano.

Not the easiest recipe in the world, but the chipotle rub rocks! I've used it on tuna for tacos, chicken breast and london broil, and I'm sure I'll figure out about twelve more uses before I'm done. I bet it would be killer on grilled veggies. I had doubts about the salsa, (only charred the tomatoes about 1/3 of the way before I ran out of time) but people were eating it with a spoon at the last get-together I brought it too. The salsa recipe is probably a great base for a gazpacho recipe. Thank you, Epicurious!

Very good. I used bonito because I caught one fresh on a fly rod. I came to epicurious specifically looking for bonito recipes. I grilled the fillets within and hour of catching the fish. I love bonito and I do not know why it is not as popular in the markets. It is so subtle. Additionally, the fish itself is very beautiful on the outside. The recipe made a perfect lunch.

Yellow fin tuna never tasted better.

I used yellow fin because it was fresh at the market. Everything about this recipe, and La Parilla, is delightful. If you enjoy fresh, spicy, grilled food, it is a fantastic cookbook to own. Tonight, I'm making the charred tomato mint salsa for the third time this week.

It's Ok but is an aquired taste. The Bonita Tunais very hard to find
