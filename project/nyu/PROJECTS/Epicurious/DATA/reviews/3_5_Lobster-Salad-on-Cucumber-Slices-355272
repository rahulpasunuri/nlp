Could be four forks. Made it with crab meat, added some Old Bay, lemon and lime, and chives for additional flavor. Worked but I think shrimp or lobster would be a better.

This was certainly not bad, but I agree - BLAND. I have made it a few times w/ changes. First w/ rice wine and ginger another w/ meyer lemon juice and fresh basil. I'm sure there are a zillion combo's to add a little flavor.

I couldn't find lobster meat when I was making it, so I substituted salad shrimp...not as good but it worked. I also added a little curry. I put it on a silver tray, and had every other one on a water cracker. It looked beautiful and was well received.

Served this for a holiday party - everyone loved it. Very easy and quick.

I love lobster so I was really excited to try these. Unfortunately, I found it a little bland. Just not much taste at all. If I make it again, I'll probably think of a way to spicy it up.
