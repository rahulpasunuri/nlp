These were good but not repeat-worthy. I don't regret making them, but there are better "herb roasted potato" recipes out there.

nuttin' special. kinda made dinner taste like breakfast as these are totally homefries for a couple of over-easies and a pint glass full of mimosa. they were, in fact, scrumptious the next morning re-pan-fried in a lil' bacon fat and a couple of serranos. save this one for brunch.

This recipe has been a staple at our house for about the last 10 years. Love it!

My dinner guests would have given this recipe 4 forks- they loved it. I followed recipe exactly..except added a handful of chives. The lemon actually was comlplimentary-but the combination of lemon, herbs, and salt had too much kick for me. Potatoes were nice and crunchy..not overly greasy.

WOW! This was simple, easy, and delicious! I did not have any marjoram or Thyme (to my dismay) but I substitued Italian seasoning and extra Rosemary and they came out excellent. My guests all wanted more!

By FAR the BEST potato recepie! This is soo easy to make. I've made tons of recepies from epecurious and without question, this is the one that no matter what I'm making, everyone keeps asking for. I like to double the recepie, and as always, add a few garlic cloves, but trust me, a keeper!

Forget what people said about it being to lemony. I was scared of the lemon, but it gave the potatoes a nice (and subtle) zing. Very very good.

I liked the ease of preparation and crispiness of the potatoes but was disappointed the herb flavor was not more intense. I used fresh rosemary and omitted the marjoram, but otherwise followed the recipe. Next time I'll add more salt, pepper and oregano. The fresh lemon juice was not distinguishable.

These are so gooood. Why do they have to be so fattening? Ugh.. I used the fresh herbs because I have them growing on my patio.. Except for marjoram.. didn't even have any dried either. I will surely make these often. And marjorams on the list.

These potatoes were fantastic and so easy! I used a garlic-infused olive oil instead of the plain and also used less oil as suggested by another reviewer...but still could have cut out more. I also added more lemon juice for a bigger zing! I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

This recipe seemed so simple I was surprised just how good they were. I have made them many times now for a side. It has been a nice change for quests lately too. They are very flavorful and crusty at the same time. One reason they are so easy is because they fit on a cookie sheet and can slide right at the bottom level of your oven when you have other things going. The temperature is very forgiving if you have meat cooking a lower temperature. You just have to play with the cooking time and they come out great every time. Be sure to cook them enough so the get brown and a little bit crunchy on the outside. My favorite so far are made with the little reds. Enjoy!

This is a wonderful recipe, earning the cook many forks. I eliminated the lemon and added balsamic vinegar - great colour and great taste.

My BF and I have made this dish twice, served along side grilled steak and fresh salad, and each time we marveled at how delicious it was! Other people in the house came down to try a bite and finished it up! Even if you make extra, there won't be any left ;)

Before I tried this recipe, I thought I had a nice way to roast potatoes. Now I have a new way. You can safely use much less olive oil than is provided in the recipe (one or two tablespoons is really all you need), and feel free to mix up the herbs: fresh, dried, it doesn't seem to matter. They're always very nice, and very popular at my table.

This was easy to make and was a great side dish with London Broil (recipe also found on epicurious). After the 40 minutes of cooking time I turned on the broiler and added a little more crispiness to the potatoes. Along with sautéed asparagus dinner was a big hit!!!

These were fantastic! My husband said they were the best potatoes he's ever had ~ and that's saying a lot! I used fresh herbs instead of dried and added some freshly minced garlic as well. It was a huge hit with my family and I'm sure I'll be making it again and again in the coming years.

This was so easy to make. I will definitely make this again. I also substituted fresh rosemary and garlic for dried and powdered. I would have liked more garlic flavor. Next time I'll use powdered garlic AND fresh garlic.

Very easy and very tasty. I added a little savory from the garden, which seemed to give it a little more complex flavor.

Very good and easy, but I have to say I think the Roasted Onions and Potatoes (also on Epicurious) are even a little better.

Those potatoes turned out so well!! Absolutely delicious! I substituted dried rosemary for fresh instead and fresh garlic cloves instead of the garlic powder. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it.

Excellent. I used red potatoes @ 425 degrees and they took about an hour to cook to my liking, and were delicious! I found that the lemon juice (fresh) did add a little something to the flavor which was a nice surprise. I think adding red pepper flakes would be good (I like spiciness) but it would have killed the little hint of lemon so it would be a different side dish. The recipe is great as it is.

Always get asked for the recipe on this one. I bake the potatoes as long as it takes to get them brown and crispy outside. I always use the mini potatoes for this one which stay really creamy inside. I also throw in a bit more spice for kick (few chili pepper flakes or prefab spice mixes from store) You can substitute wine for lemon or lime juice. Fresh rosemary is also nice!

This is one of my all-time fav recipes for quick potatoes. I usually modify the herbs depending upon what I have available fresh. I prefer using red skinned potatoes, but the russets are also great. Always a great side dish. rjt

I make this recipe all the time now! I use about 2 teas. fresh chopped herbs instead of dried and then divide the potatoes into 2 equal piles and put in 2 foil pouches/packages. Grill the packages for about 40 min to 1 hr flipping them once. GREAT!

Easy and awesome! The whole family loved these potatoes! I served this with steak diane (recipe from Omaha Steak) and steamed broccolini -- great combo!

Very good and very simple. Good weekday dish. Even the 6-year old loved it (with ketchup of course!) Nothing was left over for next day's lunch. :)

Wonderful flavor, easy to prepare. I also suggest raising the oven temp to 425. Worthy of company. I made 1" cubes and microwaved them for 5 minutes (+/-) before putting them in the oven and saved about 10 + minutes - Iwas short on time!!

This is a wonderful recipe. I have made it many times and especially like it because it is so easy to do for a crowd of people. I have made it for as many as 20 people at one meal and every single person raved! Every single member of our family declares this a real winner.

These potatoes were delicious and very easy to make. I left out the oregano, used fresh garlic (instead of garlic powder), and added some dried orange peel since I was out of lemons. I especially liked that these potatoes were not greasy at all. I served with grilled Salmon and a tossed salad--a very nice meal.

This is a great recipe for potatoes.I spinkled KOSHER SALT on the potatoes after they were done and it definetly added tons of flavor. This recipe is a keeper and I will share it with family and friends.

Yum yum yum! My new favorite way to make potatoes. Made them last night as part of a special Valentine's day dinner and my boyfriend and i absolutely loved them. Will most definitely make them again soon.

I made these potatoes for New Years Eve dinner, along with a baked ham. They can be prepared beforehand and simply put into the oven when ready, which is great. They taste wonderful with the fresh herbs and lemon, and turned out nice and crispy (I put the broiler on for a few seconds at the end, and they turned out great!) I will definately make these again.

These potatoes are great and easy to make. My picky 3-year old loves them and calls them "potatoes that are like french fries". I make them extra crispy by cubing them smaller and baking them a little longer.

This is a no brainer! Scrub, chop, toss & roast. Next time I would raise the heat to 425 because we like a crispier texture. Oh. And I mistakenly added dried taragon instead of oregano. No problem. Great to jazz up week night meals & great for company!

I cooked this at 425 degrees because my husband loves them "done." I have to say they were AWESOME. I loved the lemon juice touch, and the blend of herbs. Definately a keeper.

I used the dripping from a roast pork loin and added olive oil up to 1/4 cup, then followed the rest of the recipe. It tasted great, but best of all, was EASY.

These were wonderful! At a previous reviewer's suggestion, I served them with "Garlic-Orange Pork Chops" (found on epicurious). I found the recipes at 6PM and had dinner served by 7PM. These potatoes would be great for brunch also. I doubled everything except the potatoes and flavor was wonderful. Recommendation: make potatoe cubes small!

I increased the lemon to 2T and added 1teaspoon of dried basil, I was afraid that it wouldn't have enough flavor because of what was said in the comments. I served it to friends and we all loved it. I didn't have marjoram so I left it out. I'm sure the recipe would have been fine as written also.

The taste was not bad, however, it was a little bland. The next time I make these potatoes I will add garlice and a other spices.
