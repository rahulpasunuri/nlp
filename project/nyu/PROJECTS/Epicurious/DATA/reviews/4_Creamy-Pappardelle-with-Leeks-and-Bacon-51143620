This is very good and very easy. Made it for a couple friends for dinner. They loved it!

Oh YUM! I haven't even tasted it yet and the sauce smells amazing on the stove. I used fettuccine, rosemary, and regular yellow onion since I didn't have pappardelle, thyme, and leeks on-hand. So easy, can't wait to eat it!

Really good weeknight recipe! Makes a lot as well so we get at least two meals out of it. We used 4 slices of 1/4" thick pancetta. We also used fettucinni instead of pappardelle. Next time I'll put some peas in there!

This is a really great and easy weekday meal that tastes amazing. I used pancetta and chicken stock and a splash of marsala wine. DELICIOUS. The second time I made this I added some chicken. Will keep this on my menu rotation.

A.MAZ.ING!! Followed the directions exactly and was not dissapointed. My 3 year old and I devoured it. After 5 minutes of sqwaking about the "green stuff", he ate it and proclaimed it "not so nasty". It's even great the next day. I used an extra wide home style egg noodle due to no paparadelle. Perfect texture. Highly recommend this dish?!

This was really good! Certainly not the healthiest thing, but delicious as a treat. We had it with an arugula salad on the side. When stirring everything together at the end, don't throw the 1 cup of parmesan on top and then pour the hot pasta water over the top -- it clumps up into a blob of melted cheese. Stir the water or the cheese in first, I guess.

I did make a couple changes. I used 3 leeks, light cream instead of heavy cream, and I added 1 cup of green peas. Peas were frozen and I just added them in at the end. We loved the results!

Amazing recipe. Simple yet super delicious! Would definitely make again. I also added mushrooms.

I loved it, alas, my boyfriend did not. I LOVE leeks and the combination of leeks and bacon is to die for. I had to use dried thyme in place of fresh (much less, of course) but it turned out quite good. I'd add a bit more bacon the next time and maybe cut back a little on the leeks. I'd like to try it with sweet onions and see how that works and to see if my boyfriend likes it any better.

Amen to triple thyme and use of pancetta instead of bacon. Add nutmeg too. Fresh pappardelle is a must and make sure your pan is huge for the final step. Insider secret: I added 1/4 lobster stock to the pasta's water: holy moley!

I really enjoyed this recipe, I added some mushrooms and used white wine instead of water. Would make again.

It was good but I wasn't "wowed" with flavour, and I even added more flavour than called for. I did not add the oil and butter since I thought the bacon should be adequate fat, but I added some minced garlic and sliced mushrooms with the leeks, white wine instead of water, more thyme, and some parsley, freshly ground pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg, and even used chicken stock instead of pasta water. I would still make it again, but based on the other reviews I was expecting a bit more I guess.

Loved, loved, loved this! It's certainly not a lo-cal dish but it was delicious! I cut it in half ,as well, and loved the simplicity and the richness of the dish. And who doesn't love pappardelle!? I would make this again!

Excellent! Slight variations make this a fantastic base recipe.

I'll make it tonight. Think I will use mild pancetta instead of bacon. I will let you know about the result.

Tremendously delicious. I halved the recipe and it came together well; predictably, the cook time for each step was a bit less than recommended. Easy recipe with a gourmet outcome. Will make again!

Excellent. Used 2 1/2 large leeks and 5 slices of bacon. Slightly more thyme as suggested. Also fresh fettuccine. Delish.

Easy to make and my kids liked it. I wouldn't change anything.

Absolutely a keeper! The only change we made was adding 2/3 of a cup of crimini mushrooms lightly sauteed. Outstanding.

Loved it! Great for a cold winter night.

I seldom write a review immediately following the preparation of a new recipe; however, this dish was so delicious I felt compelled to write this. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding a bit more fresh thyme. While cooking the pasta, I realized that I always add a pinch of fresh nutmeg to all dishes made with cream. That little change took this over the top. Absolutely wonderful.

Excellent winter recipe, I used a bit less cream and more thyme. Would be a good small first course followed by a salad and some nice grilled fish

I love carbonara and have friends who are allergic to eggs. This is a delightful alternatie and the leeks and bacon were perfect. Loved this recipe

My husband LOVES carbonara, so he was anxious to try a different version. It was a real hit! I did add an extra leek and I would recommend that little variation - they are soooo good! The amount of bacon was just right. I agree that adding extra salt must be done with care, if at all, but lots of pepper is a must!

I cut the recipe down for two, but still kept to the theme. Very good! I did add too much salt though, as I forgot about the salt in the bacon. Served it with an arugula salad, which was a perfect pairing. We will be making this again.
