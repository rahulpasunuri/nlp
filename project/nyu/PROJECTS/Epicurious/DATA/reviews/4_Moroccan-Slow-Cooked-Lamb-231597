I loved this recipe. It is wonderful, rich, and savory-sweet. My picky dinner guest loved it, though my 6 year old did not, saying it was too spicy. Personally, I did not think it was spicy at all but I like heat. I did tweak the recipe a bit by adding the following, only because I have been fooling around with Moroccan spice rubs lately and found these additional flavors to work well together: -Some allspice -Some cardamom -Some smoked paprika -Some nutmeg I also added about 4 cloves of mashed garlic (I just can't cook without it). Like other reviewers, I added chunks of carrots and threw in a handful of spinach at the end. I can't wait to get home to eat up the leftovers!!!

I made this last night for my partner and he absolutely loved it. I personally couldn't taste it because I was sick, but he asked me to make it again so that's a sure sign that it was good. One thing I could taste though was the heat from the spice so in future I think I will add less cayenne pepper to the recipe. This stew with some good red wine. Perfect combination on a cold windy night.

I was fortunate enough to get a whole lamb shoulder from my neighborhood halal market. Once boned I was able to use the bones and trimmings to make a lamb stock that really intensified the flavor of the dish. Added dates and prunes for a little more fruity taste, and some lemon juice for a little more acid. Also made the night before servings so it really ripened and sang with the couscous. A real keeper.

Wow! My friend made this recipe for a New Year's eve party and everybody LOVED it! Many people said it was better than the lamb they had eaten in a San Francisco Morrocan restaurant! The slow cooking really allowed the dish to develop deep, layered flavors. We all could have eaten a huge plate of this delicious dish!

YUMM! This is my favorite Moroccan-style lamb recipe in recent memory. Not overly sweet, as some tagines can be. Just a really nice blend of spices and flavors. This will become one of our go-to recipes for lamb shoulder. Fabulous!

This is the most fabulous recipe. I had a Moroccan party and made this along with other dishes and this was gone in a flash! Make this dish, but be sure to at least double the recipe, it's THAT good. Also have bread on hand to soak up all the incredible sauce,

I used leg of lamb and also cut back on the apricots and added 3 carrots as suggested. I had to used canned plum tomatoes that I drained and chopped up after I drained off the liquid. Served with whole wheat cous cous that I cooked with a green onion and some fresh cilantro. Really enjoyed and will definitely make again.

Excellent! I quadrupled the recipe for tomorrow night's New Year's Eve party. I wasn't able to get lamb shoulder so I cubed two large Costco legs of lamb. I followed the ingredients exactly. Since I made so much I needed to use two Le Creuset pots. As for the last step - reducing the broth: After the initial 1 hour of cooking, I scooped out the broth and reduced it in a separate pan and then put the reduced, thickened broth back in the stew. This was to prevent the chickpeas from getting mushy. Not sure it was worth the trouble but my two huge pots of stew are FABULOUS! Several of my 21 guests are bringing complimentary dishes including a pearl couscous dish and steamed green beans.

This was one of the best recipes that I've made in a long while. It was even better than I thought it would be, given the rave reviews. I did make a couple of changes - not big - because I didn't want the dish to be too sweet and I wanted additional veggies. So, I reduced the apricots to about 1/3 cup, chopped them coarsely; added a few chopped, pitted prunes; and, added about 3 big carrots cut into chunks. I found that I didn't need to simmer the dish to reduce the sauce - it was already fairly thick. I used chopped parsley instead of cilantro. Served with roasted cauliflower and whole wheat couscous. Really, really delicious. My 14 year old daughter loved it as did our 90 year old guest! A big time keeper.

Rating: 3
This was really really tasty. I served it with cous cous with some lemon zest and chopped cilantro in it. Next time I may reduce the amount of apricots slightly to reduce the sweetness a little. I also cooked this for about 3 hours - next time I might try it in the slow cooker. The perfect cold-weather dinner!

One of the tastiest Moroccan dishes I've ever made. Followed recipe except for using half dried plums with the apricots. Also made the suggested couscous with pine nuts. So good I overate and now I feel miserable. Will make this one for company.

This was delicious! I decided to roast the boneless shoulder whole to make use of all that nice fat, so I coated it in the spice mix and 1/2 c. non fat yogurt, let it marinate for a few hours, and roasted it at 375 for 1.5 hours. I used the pan drippings to make the sauce as specified. Served over plain cous cous. Will make again.

Not eating meat myself I can only go by what my family says. The first time I made this my husband requested it to be saved as a favorite and about a month later asked if we could have it again. The recipe is very easy with ingredients that I have on hand almost all the time, lamb being the exception. Both times I made it as written. I'm not sure why it's called slow cooked because it cooks up pretty quickly. Start in the afternoon and done for dinner! Much of the time is unattended time!

this is now my foolproof way to impress guests after having first made this recipe a year ago. The meat available here is quite lean so the result is not heavy or greasy, and these flavours are unbeatable. Every guest who's had it has taken their first spoonful and said "wow!" I usually serve it with a simple spinach salad dressed with lemon, and most recently finished the meal off with the olive oil lemon tart (recipe on this site) for a winner of a dinner party.

So excellent. Made exactly as written; not too spicy for us but wonderfully complex flavors. A HUGE hit.

Very good, but as previously said, spicy! I asked my husband to prep the lamb while I was at work. He follows directions to the t. I would have cut back pretty far on the cayenne. Taking it to a Moroccan dinner party tonight. I'm sure everyone will love it, but I'll probably have some yogurt with it to tone it down.

I have made this recipe twice and both times it was delicious. A little on the spicy side so if you don't like spice, be careful of this dish. The first time I made it with a yogurt-dill sauce which helped the heat. This is DELICIOUS.

This has been a family favorite for 5 years. I have often made it with ground lamb, lamb stew meat is very hard for me to find. Yesterday I made it with ground chicken for our "no red meat" daughter and it was wonderful. If you can resist the first day, it tastes even better the second day. I have never made it without getting rave reviews-an absolutely wonderful recipe.

This is really excellent- I only give 4 forks when my family exclaims over something, and this got a thumbs up from everyone. My son-in-law, who usually doesn't much care for tagine really enjoyed this. I didn't have tomato paste, or fresh tomatoes. So, I used a can of stewed tomatoes, and some sun-dried tomato sauce. Otherwise followed the recipe.

Fantastic. Used half the amount of ginger in dried powder form. Both my husband and I loved this dish. The combination of spices completely neutralized the one thing I often dislike about lamb: the musky taste. The meat and the apricots ended up as tender as could be. Served with mint/lemon peel/slivered almond couscous, as suggested. Will definitely be making this again.

Rating: 4
Just made this for dinner. Very easy, takes just minutes to get everything in the pot. We had the luxury of having very nice Iowa lamb chops. Some of the family would give it 4+++ forks. It's snowing and snowing, so we found everything in the cupboard. Used canned apricots, great northern beans instead of garbanzo. Half a large can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. All the spices/lemon peel/ginger we did have. The lamb just fell off the bone in our bowls. We didn't even use our steak knives. The seasonings melded so well; such a flavorful meal. Served over plain cous cous.

Rating: 4
This dish is so flavorful and so fragant due to the spices that it is a multiple sensory experience. I ground the spices at the moment, adding some allspice. Did not have fennel seed. I had to use canned apricots since could not find dried but worked out perfect. I cooked rice with almonds, garlic, carrot and parsley and served the stew in a large plate over the rice. My family raved about this meal and it surely will become a family favorite.

I love this dish - it's great. You can easily make a vegetarian version by substituting the lamb with tofu. Cook it the same way as the lamb. The dish still takes great (better with lamb) but my vegetarian wife appreciates it :)

Very easy to make and quite delicious. I made a double-portion and everyone really loved it... I made it with bone-lamb shoulder, cut into pieces, because I think the bones add great flavor to a stew. The meat falls off the bones so well, you can pick most of them out before serving.

IF YOU DON'T LIKE SWEETS, like me (the sweetest thing I eat is fruit), cut down on the apricots! I even used Turkish apricots and found the sweet aspect overpowered the spice and acid. Otherwise, a simple and tantalizing dish.

I love lamb tagines and this may be the best I've tried. It is layered and complex and truly an example of the whole being more than the sum of its parts. It's sweet, spicy, savory -- all at the same time. Like others I served it with Israeli couscous with almonds, mint and lemon zest. I also added raisins, carrots and shallots to the couscous. I altered the recipe slightly by adding a couple of handfuls (not handsful?) of fresh spinach at the last minute because I wanted something green for dinner. Opened a zinfandel that went perfectly with it. Enjoy this one.

Rating: 4
wow -- I expected to like this, based on the ingredients, but I ended up LOVING it. husband did too. made it mostly according to the recipe (for once!) except for quartering the apricots and using one can of chopped tomatoes. oh, and next time I'll double the spice mix, because I ran out. all I could find was chopped up leg of lamb which needed more like 2 hours to get fully tender, but the end result was well worth waiting for. this was easy to prepare and tasted fantastic. I'll be making it again and again this winter for sure.

I've made this twice now. Works really well when made a day ahead of inviting people around for dinner, so that anti-social time spent in the kitchen is kept to a minimum and the enhancing amalgamation of flavours is maximum. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will try with orange peel instead of lemon peel.

Delicious indeed! And so, so easy. I actually made this in the slow cooker. I browned the meat and onions as the recipe suggests and then threw everything in and cooked it on low for 5-6 hours. A-ma-zing. The lamb couldn't have been more tender, and the flavors were outstanding. Our only complaint was that we felt it could have used a bit more heat. Next time we may add more cayenne.

WOW. This was absolutely delicious. I made double the spice and cut the lamb into smaller pieces for stronger flavor. The rub is fantastic even before you get to the stewing part. As per the suggestion, I served this with Israeli couscous - lightly toasted in olive oil, then flavored with mint and lemon peel, almond slivers, and softened with chicken stock (instead of water). I will DEFINITELY be making this again. It was delicious.

4+ forks! I only had 1-1/2 lbs. lamb but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Next time I might even increase the spice mix used to coat the lamb. My husband liked it too. There was almost nothing left over. Served with "Couscous with Herbs & Lemon" from this site. Also good!

I do love Moroccan flavours and this was no exception. The proportion of spices really worked. I found that the simmering stew was very short of liquid, however, and was continually adding more chicken stock. I also used figs in this tagine. That works, too.

I made this for an end of semester party not too long ago (may we never need to read Derrida again!), and I can honestly say that it was the star of the whole affair. Aromatic, savory, and delicious, it never had a chance; there were no leftovers to take back. I think I even saw a few sociology students waddling away after thirds or possibly fourths. I've since tried a few pairings as to what grain to accompany this meal and so far the favorites are couscous, or a good jasmine rice. This recipe is top notch. Definitely a must try.

My guests LOVED this dish. I don't like lamb; but I did like making this recipe. It was perfect from start to finish. The spices smelled great and even the less sophisticated palates had seconds and thirds. The best part is that this can be made in advance so you can enjoy your company. One note, I live in NYC with plenty of shopping and I couldn't find a butcher to do boned lamb shoulder. I made this with boned leg of lamb.

Encore performance for my wine group last night, 40 guests. Served with toasted Israeli couscous. Added a touch of Allspice. It was beautiful. Nearly all disappeared.

Made this on Sunday morning in advance so that I could relax and enjoy the evening. Couldn't believe the dish was totally finished within an hour! Easy, very flavorful. Served with Israeli couscous for added texture. Will add toasted almond slivers next time for crunch, maybe a green vegetable, just blanched for more texture. Used lamb shank; very tender. Got thumbs up from guests, so serving for a party in a couple of weeks. Next review will report the outcome of party of 40 - 50.

Since I'm the 94th reviewer, there's not much more to say, except WOW! Spec-tac-u-lar stew! It didn't take as long as other stews to make b/c there's not as much to chop... no potatoes, etc. I didn't pay attention while shopping and grabbed dried apples instead of apricots but, surprisingly, they were yummy! Cut them in 1/4s, and added raisins and pine nuts as other reviewers suggested. I free pour herbs/spices and ended with a blend that was spicy enough for myself and hubby, and cool enough to give some to my mother-in-law. Can't wait to make it again--thanks Epi!

Rating: 4
This is amazing. The flavors come together so well, and in a relatively short time. The tang from the lemon zest balances nicely with the sweetness from the apricots. I used beef, but I can see that a strong meat like lamb or even venison would hold up well with the strong spices. I used only 2 lbs. of meat and added an extra can of beans. I think this would be a great vegetarian stew as well, just adding the spices intended for the meat at the onion/tomato paste stage. Or even coating big cubes of butternut squash with the spices and lightly searing or frying them. We ate this on couscous with some garlicky spinach.

This was the only thing that I want to improve, so next time I will add more pepper and perhaps some chile powder.

Delicious! I doubled the garbanzo beans, used canned tomatoes, and quartered the apricots as recommended by previous viewers. When I make this recipe again, I will likely use beef cubes to save money. The lamb was really very nice; however, my husband and I agreed that it's not required to make this recipe wonderful. If we have company over, I may splurge and buy the lamb.

Rating: 4
This recipe is to die for. Made it exactly as written, except instead of nice clean lamb shoulder I ended up with a hodgepodge of different lamb cuts. With all of the various bones, I decided to do a homemade 'lamb broth' in place of the chicken broth (basically the lamb bones, half an onion, a handful of peppercorns, a couple of cloves of garlic, and salt, with about 5c of water boiled down to 2c), and that worked out well. Followed others' suggestions of doubling the chickpeas, which I agree with, but then when it all came together I felt like more broth was needed. So added an extra cup of regular chicken broth. Anyway, the blend of flavours in this dish will blow your mind, and my only critique was that after an hour and a half, those chickpeas were looking a little soggy and crumbly. I might consider adding the chickpeas half way through the 1-hour simmering cycle.

This is an excellent dish, would be very good for a dinner party, as it's easy to serve. I halved it, but used the full amount of spice rub and let the meat sit an hour before browning.

Outstanding recipe - subtle blend of tastes. I substituted canned tomatoes for the fresh (out of season) and dried minced grated lemon rind (no fresh on hand) and sprinkled with dried cilantro (no fresh on hand) and it was still outstanding!

deeeeelicious. i threw lamb shoulder still on the bone right into the pot (a saute pan just isn't big enough) and slow-cooked it with everything for 2, 2.5 hours until it was so tender you didn't need a knife and it slid off the bone. left out the fennel seeds...have never liked them. the cilantro is a great addition to the top. mmm.

This dish was amazing! I was a little hesitant, since I've never tried Moroccan food, but the flavors melded perfectly! I followed the recipe exactly, except for using a can of diced tomatoes in place of the plum tomatoes, and I didn't let it cook the whole hour because we were so hungry--it was almost 9 PM! Prepping the lamb shoulder took much longer than we expected! Also, I don't think I've ever seen a skillet large enough to hold all this food--I used a stockpot for everything after I browned the lamb! But overall, this dish was pretty simple and well worth the wait!

This is a stellar dish. I have made it a half- dozen times to glorious appreciation of my dinner guests. It works with both shoulder or leg. Lamb shoulder gives a richer sauce than leg, which I prefer, but my wife who likes leaner dishes prefers the leg. I also made a slight change to the recipe. I reduce the apricots to 1/2 cup and add 1/2 cup of raisins to the recipe. Makes great leftovers.

Made this exactly as it is written. Easy, easy, easy. When your guests stop in mid conversation and exclaim, "This is really good!" you know the recipe works. This one is definitely staying in my recipe box.

This was an incredible dish! The flavors are marvelous together. My husband nearly ate the entire thing in one day! No leftovers for very long. This is a keeper

This was a delicious and easy dinner for company. One of my guests had lived many years in Saudi Arabia, and said it was very authentic to the flavors she remembered. I worried it might be too sweet or spicy for some, but the flavors all melded together beautifully. I did chop the apricots into quarters, which worked well. And I had to use leg of lamb, since lamb shoulder was not available at my market. It was just perfect for a casual company dinner -- I had hardly any last minute work to do in the kitchen, so I could visit with my guests, instead! I served it with cous cous that had toasted almonds and scallions in it, which was a nice complement.

My boyfriend's ex-wife is Moroccan. Perhaps the only thing he missed about her was the lamb dish her mother prepared while in Morocco. Per the suggestions of other reviewers, quartered the apricots and used canned diced tomatoes (the fresh ones are out of season and looked flavorless.) He said that this was not only the dish he had missed, but that this recipe was "even better." I particularly enjoyed how tender and flavorful the lamb turned out. Served with commercially-made Far East Pine Nut and Herb Couscous. A great cold weather dish to be made again and again.

This was a great recipe! I have never eaten Moroccan food before so I wasnt sure what I was going to get. The flavors were very complex, and the spices are great. I agree with other reviews about chopping the dried apricot, rather then leaving them whole. I will defiantly make this again!

This is one of my favorites and actually prefer waiting a day to eat it. I use a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of chopping plum tomatoes and used boneless lamb shank this last time as my grocer didn't have shoulder. The lamb was slightly drier but still very good. I make this with toasted israeli couscous with almonds, mint and lemon peel. I will have to try the cut up apricots next time. I agree they can be a mouthful!

This is an absolutely delicious dish. The flavors are very complex without being overwhelming. This is a keeper for entertaining; you can do it all the day before! I happened to have preserved lemons on hand so I used 1/2 in place of the lemon peel which seemed to add a very subtle lemon flavor.

Very nice. I would cut up the apricots next time because they expanded rather a lot in the cooking and became large unwieldy mouthfuls.

This is a new family favorite. Prepared day before and brought it camping. Everyone enjoyed the wonderful aroma and flavor.

I actually quadrupled this for 20 and it was my first time making it! I could tell by the recipe that little could go wrong but what a surprise at how much went right. Really great. I used three legs of lamb cut up for 20, by the way and used two pans for searing. i would use a bit more spiced next time.

thought this was great; I added an extra can of tomatoes and some red wine and we all loved it.

I made this dish tonight just as the recipe was written. Both my husband and I thought it was superb. It was easy enough to make on a weeknight but special enough to share with company. I also liked it because it didn't call for anything that I didn't have in the house. Once the apricots had cooked for the hour or so, I didn't think that even they tasted sweet. Certainly not too sweet. I paired it with couscous with toasted almond slivers and shredded mint leaves and served hommous with pita bread with it. Yum.

Tasty, easy recipe that you can make ahead of time so you can relax with your guests! Lots of wonderful flavor. I just wish I had some leftover. It makes just enough for six servings.

I am a private chef and my employer loves this recipe!! It appears and tastes like I worked hard all day but it is quite simple. What a taste treat!

This was a wonderful dish. My family loved it and it was fairly easy to make. I wasn't sure about the dried apricots, but I really like the flavor they give along with the citrus flavor from the lemon peel. I would definitely make it again.

This stew is fabulous!! All the varied flavors came together much better than I ever expected and created a very original taste. I will definitely be making this again.

This was my first attempt at Moroccan style cooking. The variety of flavors and textures was such a delight and the ingredients are full of nutrition! It was very easy to prepare and I will make it again and again. Thanks!

I made this and at first, my husband was unwilling to try it but, once he did, he ate all of the leftovers and didn't leave me any. Wonderful combination of flavors.... definitely a keeper

We love lamb, but not this recipe. Too much sweet flavor. Big dissapointment!

This is absolutely delicious! The flavors are amazing. I made as written except used 1 1/2 lbs boneless lamb steaks. Next time, I will increase the onion and tomatoes and add some golden raisins.

I made this for a large crowd, who raved. I upped the spice mixture a bit, and at first taste was afraid I'd overdone it, but after an hour of simmering, the spices had grown much milder and had melded to perfection. Mmmm.

Very good. I tossed the lamb in the oil before braising, which worked well. I'd definitely add all the apricots next time-- no risk of it being too sweet. And leave the cinnamon sticks in if you refridgerate for use the next day- otherwise the flavor gets lost. Note: this freezes really well as well.

The whole family enjoyed this meal. They are concerned that I'll loose the recipe.

Made this as written. 3+ forks. The lamb was tender and the whole dish was very flavorful. The flavors are enough different to make it interesting. They seem to work together. If you want a different set of tastes, then try this recipe.

Well, you can't say I didn't try. My husband, who is afraid of lamb unless it is rare lamb chops, was also fearful of a Moroccan dish. I assured him that he would love it but when I served it he just game me the look. He only tasted it. My twenty-year-old son ate a small portion with no comment which means he was underwhelmed. I thought it was pretty good, though. Just not a crowd pleaser at my house. We're pretty eclectic here, but this pushed the guys over the edge.

If I could give this recipe a 3+ I would. I did not the Fennel seeds hence the 3+ but the flavors were great! Instead of simmering on the stove I braised in the oven @ 125 celcius for 1.5 hours. Served over couscous with some Nan bread and yogourt sauce.

I'll make this again, because my daughter (who "hates" lamb) asked me to. However, I'll make it a day ahead, and perhaps tweak the spices. I though it was nice and easy, but didn't have the depth of flavor that I was hoping for. I served it with golden couscous (also on this site), and the combination worked well. Has anyone made any really great alterations that they'd like to recommend? I like the dish, but would like it to have more oomph!

This dish is absolutley fabulous. Even my food timid father loved it. But it only feeds 4; everyone wants a large helping!

We made this recipe midweek and it was incredibly easy and tasty. The lamb was extremely tender and the apricots and garbanzo beans really made the dish complete. The only thing we were missing were the Moroccan tapestries on our walls. We would definitely make this dish again!

This dish is really simple to cook - perfect to make early in the day or the day before. We made it for a weeknight dinner and everyone was blown away by the richness of the sauce and the tenderness of the lamb.

Excellent, made it in a tagine cooker and it worked perfectly. The flavors were fabulous. We will definitely make this recipe again.

I'm a huge fan of all things lamb and Moroccan, and have just added this one to my repertoire after trying it yesterday. However, husband and I prefer a mixture of dried fruits such as figs and prunes, so next time may use these in lieu of the apricots, or in addition. I used a 4-1/2 quart Le Creuset Dutch oven for the whole operation, and find that tossing the lamb with olive oil after coating it with the seasoning provides a better result with the browning. Try this rather than pouring the oil into the pan.

This was great - made it for a small dinner party last night and it got rave reviews from everyone. Maybe a little too sweet for my tastes - I may cut back on the apricots next time.

This is funny, I just made this for dinner thinking it was a friends recipe and word for word, this must've been where she got it! The dish is fabulous, it's a bit labor intensive at times, but if you like the moroccan flavours of cinnamon and spice with garbonzo beans, you'll like this. If you aren't a fan of a lot of heat though, I would be very wary on how much cayene pepper you add, I think the batch I currently have is a hotter one than normal, so this dish ended up having a bit more heat than I would've liked. Enjoy!

This was wonderful! I made it for my family and they loved it.....making it again this week for guests. Our butcher didn't have lamb shoulder so I used a leg of lamb.

Made it with wild game (sheep) and it was scarfed up immediately. Make a double batch when you cook it up!

This is delicious!! I served it over rice and it was so good, very flavorful. There is a hint of spice and sweetness to it. The garbanzo beans also adds some yummy texture to it. The lambs were tender and not overcooked.
