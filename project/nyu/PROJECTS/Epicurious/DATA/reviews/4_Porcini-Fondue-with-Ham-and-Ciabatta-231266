OMG--you can't imagine how great this is! We're making it again in a few days. The porcini really makes it. This is super simple. I followed the steps for the fondue exactly. But what we used for dipping was this: marbled rye cocktail bread slices, sliced pears, purple seedless grapes, pre-boiled (in salted and thymed water) fingerling potatoes (sliced to just under large mashmallow size after cooling), and proscuitto strips. We mixed and matched the stuff in a thousand ways--all being fantastic. Do this!

Wonderful, and very, very rich. Next time I would skip the ham and serve just with bread and maybe some new potatoes and asparagus. Use the best-quality cheeses you can find. This is a keeper!

I served this as part of a buffet with ham, cubes of bread and roasted cauliflower and brussel sprouts for dipping. A big hit. The porcini mushrooms really mellow the sharpness of the traditional swiss fondue. My only addition was a little bit of freshly grated nutmeg. Perfect. I saved what was left (not much), including the cheese that browns and sticks to the bottom of the pot, chopped it up and used it in a fritata the next day for breakfast. Delicious.

I blanched asparagus, brocoli and mushrooms and wrapped the veggies in procuitto ... the ham I though was too overpowering w/ the all this rich cheese.

My niece made this for Christmas.A few other fondues were made also. This one was by far the best. Very good flavor and consistancy.

Great flavor with a good consistancy. We dipped bread, cauliflower and broccoli. I will definitely make this again.

We made this fondue exactly as written, using Sumac Ridge Sauvignon Blanc for the wine. I was originally skeptical that we needed to use such a large quantity of dried porcini, but it worked out perfectly. The ham was clumsy to dip...but delicious!
