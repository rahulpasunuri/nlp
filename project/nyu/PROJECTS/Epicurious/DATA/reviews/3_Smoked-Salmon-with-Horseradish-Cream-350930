I appreciate this recipe -- thank you! It's easy and elegant, and perfect to start off a menu that is otherwise complex to make or to put something nice together quickly for guests.

I doubt I would make this again. The combination of cream with salmon is too rich for my taste.

Hi...you're not supposed to eat it all yourself dude. PS this is a holiday recipe and if you can't slpurge a little bit during the holidays you're doing something wrong the rest of the year

My wife really enjoyed eating this but I did not enjoy making it. How can you when *that much* heavy cream (read: ~300% of daily saturated fat content) is in one bowl? Stick with "recipes" (as reviewer mrokern would jab) that use sour cream or cream cheese.

These were... tangy. People enjoyed them, probably largely due to the richness of the cream. I would stick with butter & capers, or cream cheese and dill.

I took this to a potluck birthday party today. I served it with sliced sourdough bread and lox. It was the first dish to disappear and the first to be sampled! The cream creates a very light spread that is far superior to a whipped cream cheese.

My latkas died...literally were terrible...so I scratched that and used mini toasts and it was amazing. I added a small sprig of dill on top for garnish and it was a well working garnish.
