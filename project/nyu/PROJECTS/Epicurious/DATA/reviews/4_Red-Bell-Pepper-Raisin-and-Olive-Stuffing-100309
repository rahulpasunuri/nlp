This recipe is a regular on our Thanksgiving table, and it is as changeable as it is delicious as-written. I use the full amount of butter and increase the herbs and olives. Dried cranberries are an excellent substitution for the yummy raisins, and pine nuts are a good addition. Great with whole wheat bread.

I've made this recipe twice. First time, I served it with lamb and the other with chicken. Goes great with every dish and is even better as left-overs. You'll only need half the butter. Definitley a unique stuffing.

I made 1/3 of the original recipe (4 servings, and were they small!!) exactly as written except that I subbed leeks for onions and decreased the butter by about 1/3. Put it all in an 8-1/2" x 4-1/2" glass loaf dish, so buttering the foil was unnecessary. This made a sweet and deliciously different dressing that complimented a Dr. Pepper marinated and BBQ grilled boneless NY strip steak wonderfully. When I make this again I may try decreasing the butter even further, and increasing the broth (to make it a little less fattening). Too bad I don't bake stuffing inside a bird anymore, because I think that this stuffing would be SUPER inside a large turkey!!!

We frist discovered this recipe in 1999 and have been making it for Thanksgiving ever since. We omit the raisins (due to small children) and it works just fine without them. We pair this stuffing with the Roast Turkey w/Herb Butter and Caramelized-Onion Gravy and it's GREAT!!! NO LEFT-OVERS!!!!!

I don't like stuffed poultry, but this recipe made a believer out of me. Wonderful flavors, color and texture. I only used half the amount of butter called out.
