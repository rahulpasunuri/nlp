This is really good, BUT NOT ON HOT DOGS. Terrible mismatch. I give it 4 stars for flavor, 2 for how bad it is on hot dogs. I used the leftovers on roast chicken and it was delicious. It'd also be good on grilled pork chops. DON'T MAKE IT A DAY AHEAD as the recipe suggests. It gets too juicy. I think it's the liquid leaching out of the onions. I cut the sweet somewhat by adding twice as many onions, and more mustard, but it's still pretty sweet.

Not worth the hassle. The chutney flavor is not fresh and that's what is needed with dogs.

I love hot dogs to begin with, but this relish satisfies the need for sweet/spicy flavors and elevates the hot dog to "haute" dog!! :)

Served this at my 2yr old sons birthday party so we would have something for the "grown- ups" It got raves and not a drop left even with an assortment of other contiments

Wonderful! We use the relish on brats that we cook in beer with peppers and onions and garlic and then smoke in the Weber. If it is too sweet, cut down the amount of chutney but it is perfect for us! I make this for Cowboy games.

This relish is totally about whether you have a "sweet-tooth" or not. I didn't like this recipe at all, but I can see how other people might. Use your own self-knowledge here--if you don't have a craving for sweet things, you're not going to like this.

I didn't think this was very good. It was okay, but nothing spectacular. Wouldn't make it again.

What a great change of pace for the lowly hotdog ! Used Hebrew National franks and followed the recipe as written including cutting some of the larger pieces of mango into smaller size. Had some leftover and found it just as good a day or two later.

This didn't work for me. Too bad as I usually love anything with cilantro, and I drench my blt's with chutney. It was simply too sweet. I'll stick with mustard and ketchup.

Very good overall, but I think my chutney was a little too chunky and also had whole raisins (should have used Major Grey's). Would definitely make again.

Wow! Even my 6 year old agrees these are the best hot dogs he's ever had. I rarely indulge in them but with this recipe I can't resist!! Dying to make them again soon...

Delicious alternative to ordinary ketchup and mustard. I HATE cilantro so I substitued parley. I used hot mustard because I prefer more spice.

Rave reviews at our 4th of July BBQ (especially from the gourmands in our group). No one touched the other condiments. Used Trader Joe's Mango-Ginger Chutney (extra kick from the ginger). Also tasty as a relish on burgers.

What a great way to elevate the simple hot dog! Even with regular hot dogs and buns, this was delicious. The combination of the sweet chutney, cilantro, mustard and onion was incredible! Will definitely make this relish for future BBQ's.

This is a wow and I don't say that too often. We had good deli counter dogs and it was heaven. Definitely a keeper

This was a tremendous hit. Made the whole Fourth menu with my dear aunt and this was a fabulous hit. My husband would like to have it on hand in our refrigerator! Yum!!!!
