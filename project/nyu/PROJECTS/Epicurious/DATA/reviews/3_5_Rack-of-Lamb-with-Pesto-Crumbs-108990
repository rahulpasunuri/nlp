So easy! By far, the best rack of lamb recipe I have prepared. I didn't change a thing, except I used Progresso bread crumbs.

This was just okay. 2nd time I made it, I made fresh pesto and used less breadcrumbs. Much better.

This is perfect for a dinner party. It's quick, elegant & delicious. I use an internal temperature alarm and when it hits 130 degrees I take it out cover loosely with foil and we have our salads. When we're done it's perfect. This main dish allows you to spend time with your guests and still look like a wiz in the kitchen.

Made this last week as a tester for a dinner party. Serving tomorrow. Easy and incredibly delicious.

I almost made it with pre-bought bread crumbs, then I read that one user said it would be better with fresh. Why not fresh if you've got it right? Delicous!

Excellent dish. Did take longer to cook than the recipe gave for medium rare.I would make this one again.

This dish couldn't be simpler. It was very tasty and very easy to make. I agree with the other reviewer that it did take longer to cook than the recipe gives for medium rare, I had to cook it for another 20 minutes, but it was worth it. I didn't have bread to make breadcrumbs so I used dried breadcrumbs instead. Even though it was delicious, I'm sure the fresh breadcrumbs would make it that much better. I would definitely make this one again.

Just made this for Christmas dinner and it was perfect. Needed less pesto than the recipe called for (but happy to have the leftovers!). I made the pesto from scratch, but that's a breeze -- basil, garlic, olive oil, parmesan, pine nuts. Quick and easy in the Cuisenart. Cleaned it out and made the bread crumbs. Even with all that -- a very easy recipe, very elegant and delicious. Timing worked perfectly for medium rare lamb. Served with Sweet Potatoes with Goat Cheese and Truffle Oil and the Rose Pistola cookbook's Brussels Sprouts with Pancetta and Lemon. A wonderful holiday meal!

Delicious. But I had to raise the temperature and increase the cooking time and the lamb still was pretty rare. I combined the pesto with panko and liked the result. Very easy.

The crust was delicious. I had fresh rosemary that I needed to use and added it to the breadcrumbs. I felt that the rosemary made the dish even better. This recipe is so simple and good that I will definitely make it again. This would be an impressive and easy (do-ahead)dish for guests.
