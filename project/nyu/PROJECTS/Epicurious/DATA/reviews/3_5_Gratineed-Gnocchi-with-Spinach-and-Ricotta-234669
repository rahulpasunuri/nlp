I tweaked based on other reviews (so not giving a fork rating), but loved this. Made sure to have the cream/spinach ready first then barely cooked the gnocchi so it didn't sog out. I also started with half a diced onion and some garlic, sauteed until tender, added some white wine, then sprinkled about 1-2 T of flour. Then added the cream/nutmeg/S&P. I found I needed a bit more cream as it cooked down fast and I used a package of thawed/drained frozen chopped spinach. Added the gnocchi, stirred in, cheeses on top, quick broil - YUM.

I also made lots of additions to this recipe to make it tasty. As it's written, it's bland and not worth the trouble.

I love the simplicity and rich flavor of this dish.

This was a disaster. Nothing mingled well. I did add garlic and a bit more pepper than it asked for. In the end it was just a mingled mess of cheese on top with some bits of spinach sticking to it, gnocchi below and cream sauce floating on the bottom. Part of the disaster was a promising but disappointing gnocchi, combining a bland sauce with bland gnocchi definitely didn't help anything.

Just looking at the ingredients I knew the flavor would be "meh" so I never made it as written. I sauteed 3 cloves of minced garlic with 2 packages of sliced cremini mushrooms and a pinch of red pepper flakes to add to the cream mixture. With that addition it gets a 4 fork rating. Without I'm sure it would be 1.

I didn't have any mozzarella so I used a whole cup of ricotta. It was very nice but my gnocchi were stodgy probably because they were left waiting for the cream mixture. Next time, I'll have everything ready before boiling them.

This was the first time I found a recipe I decidedly hated on Epicurious. Maybe I've just been lucky in my selections. This was completely bland- it was boring in every aspect; from the texture which was mushy and soupy, to the flavor, which required my husband and I to heap on the red pepper flakes, parmesan, and salt to give it any sort of appeal. I used all fresh and good quality ingredients, so I don't think anything went particularly wrong, except for the recipe itself. Blah.

This was a heart attack on a plate and I mean that in the best way possible. I did add garlic like others suggested and increased the liquid to 3/4 cup. I also had some leftover rotisserie chicken I threw in there. It was a little thick and heavy, next time I will mix milk in with the cream.

This was just OK. Definitely should have added Parmesan and garlic or shallot, and better quality gnocchi.

I think this recipe as written would be perfect when using the best quality ingredients. It would be very subtle in flavor. I can see why others added garlic, parmesan cheese, etc. to give it a little more je ne sais quoi. I went the parmesan route, as my guest is not a subtle taste type. Turned out very good.

Very tasty and super easy if using frozen spinach. My 6 and 4 year olds really liked it. Instead of fresh spinach I used about 1/2 of a 10oz. package of frozen spinach, which I pureed with some 1/2 and 1/2 until smooth (I didn't have cream on hand). Then I stirred the spinach and gnocchi together and added cream little by little to get the right amount of liquid and compensate for the amount I'd added to the spinach puree. I did not boil/reduce the cream beforehand and I don't think it's necessary. I did use the flour as listed and it did not have a raw flavor for not having cooked it first. You could also substitute some parmesan for some of the mozzarella, or pass parmesan at the table. This was just the right amount to feed 2 adults and 2 kids as a main course with a salad. It would also be a great side dish to fish, grilled meat, or sausage. I'll definitely make this again since it was so easy, satisfying, and got my kids to enthusiastically eat spinach!

This was great; I made it with sweet sausage tortelloni instead of gnocchi, and added in a cup of peas for some extra greens - delicious!

This was very rich and tasty but I used fat-free half n half instead of heavy cream and I think that was a mistake. I had plenty leftover but it wasn't very good the next day and I used it as a side to another dish. I think next time I may put some pancetta or bacon in it at the end a bowl of this would be enough for a simple, easy dinner.

This was really tasty. We made home made gnocchi instead of store bought...think it added to it. Also added some garlic powder into the spinach/gnocchi mix. In between the ricotta and mozzarella I also added parmesan cheese. Instead of putting in broiler I put in the over for 15 minutes on 450. I also grabbed the pan with my bare hand after I pulled it out of the oven...I don't recommend that

Adding red pepper made this much better!

Followed the recipe precisely except for the addition of garlic and the substitution of guyere for the mozz. I found this to be just ok. The lemon gnocchi with peas and spinach is worlds better. I would not make this again. Too many recipes to repeat those that are only so-so. TRUST ME!

We loved this dish. After reading the comments about the sauce being watery, I added extra flour to the cream, and it actually ended up too thick so I had to add a bit more cream to thin it... Next time I'll try it as written. I did follow the suggestions to use less spinach and to add parmesan to the cream sauce and with the mozzarella, and will do the same next time.

This turned out very well with some amendments (thanks to the previous reviewers for good suggestions!) I made my own roux the usual way but with the addition of a couple minced cloves of garlic, and I did splash in some brandy as suggested by the Cook from Long Beach, which was a nice touch. Even with light ricotta this was a rich dish - I served it with a salad of very lightly dressed spring greens and white wine. I'll be making it again, and now that I know this 'method' I'll play with some other variations.

The whole family loved this. I did as other reviewers suggested & added parmesan. I also added halved cherry tomatoes to the cream mix with the gnocchi before broiling. The tomatoes added a little tanginess, which may have been lacking otherwise.

Delicious! My husband and I loved it. I sauteed a shallot and two cloves of garlic before adding the cream. Also, added parmesan cheese when I was simmering the cream. Might be nice with a little white wine or brandy as well to give it a little more depth?

This has great ingrediants but tasted so-so. I agree that the sauce was a little watery and it needed more cheesiness. Next time I would make a more traditional roux with butter, flour, and milk-- that might help...the sauce did not thicken very muc

Remind me never to ignore the previous reviewers' suggestions again! This was good, but a bit on the bland side; if I make it again, I'll definitely use the garlic others mentioned, and I'll add some Parmesan to the cream/spinach mixture. I had only frozen spinach on hand, which came out OK but a bit too much like creamed spinach -- fresh would definitely be better.

I never had gnocchis before and always wanted to try them. I had a bag from when I went to the nearest supermarket, but did not really know how to prepare them. So, I am late for lunch time and have no ideas.. I go on Epi and find this recipe! I say, well.. I have a box of frozen Spinach in the freezer. And it is already creamed with Philadelphia cream cheese.. wonderful! I still prepared the sauce mentioned in the recipe, but cut it down by half. I added the Spinach (once it was defrosted)and soon after the gnocchi. I topped it off with some shredded Gruyere Cheese and Voila! It took a bit longer for the gratin to form under the grill, so I left it 8 minutes longer than the recipe says to do. It was marvelous! Thanks Epi... Quick, Easy and above all Delightful. xoxoxo

I took others' suggestions of adding garlic, which the dish greatly benefited from. Although quick and easy, I found 15oz of spinach a bit much: I'd recommend approx 10-12oz. Also, I sprinkled parmesan instead of mozzarella, and liked the flavour and crunchiness of the browned parmesan very much.

This is really simple and great for a quick weekday meal. Will definitely make again.

This was my first time making this dish. So easy! I used fat-free half-and-half and fat-free ricotta, and it turned out fine (of course I had nothing to compare it to, but it was delish!). I also used romano instead of mozzarella and it was quite flavorful. Next time I might add some bacon other cured meat for a little flair.

Substituted frozen spinach for the fresh, and 2% milk for the cream. Came out quite well, just make sure you drain the spinach well!

This recipe is so easy, it makes Rachael Ray's recipes look difficult and time consuming. I did follow the advice of the previous reviewers to make sure the dish had enough flavor. I used some freshly shredded Fontina and Asiago cheeses in addition to a blend of Parmesan and Mozarella. I used fresh spinach and Trader Joe's Gnocchi and dinner last night was an amazing success.

This was pretty good, but I would make several changes in order to take it from good to great. First, I used frozen chopped spinach (also because of the E coli situation), but I really believe that fresh baby spinach would have been better. I used 1/3 parmesan and 2/3 mozzarella, and it was still a bit bland - in the future, I will experiment with other types of stronger cheeses, as the mozzarella was simply too mild. Maybe some gorgonzola and parmesan next time... I would recommend this dish to anyone, but with the caveat that experimentation is necessary to really make it a great dish.

I was pleasantly surprised by how much flavor this dish had - and it was incredibly fast and easy! Used fresh parmesan instead of mozzarella (b/c I ran out of mozzarella on a dinner from earlier in the week), and used frozen chopped spinach (b/c of the e.coli scare) - at any rate, I think I actualy prefer the parmesan over the mozzarella - compliments the nutmeg better. I don't think the frozen chopped spinach made much of difference either way. Will definitely make again!

This is great, and so easy to modify if you wanted to - adding lemon zest and/or garlic would be great. Tonight I plan to do this dish with asparagus and porchini mushrooms instead of the spinach. The possibilities are endless.

Tasty! Used chard from the garden instead of spinach. Pretty close to "comfort food" and a nice use of gnocchi. Makes good leftovers too.

Excellent and quick. I couldn't find gnocchi so I used polenta sliced into discs. Pan-frying the polenta discs in a combo of olive oil and butter made them stand out more in the sauce, but this was good right from package to pan as well. Makes great leftovers too.

This was wonderful in its simplicity. It came together fast but was still a treat to eat. I added canned artichokes... and I may try mushrooms next time as well.

I couldn't find Gnocchi so I used tortelini one was roasted galic and one was sausage.I also couldn't find baby spinach so I just used regular spinach and while cleaning it I took the stem off and chop into little piece worked out quit well,maybe next time I'll try frozen, but I was surpise how fast this dinner was,I served steamed aspagas and galic french bread. and it came out very well I really like it, I will try to used the Gnocchi if I can find it, I also used a little fat free margarine for the galic and onions and flour then added the cream.

I thought this was a great and easy dish. I sauteed some garlic and onions before adding the cream to give it extra flavour. Very tasty!

I made this recipe as a vegetarian main dish for my family and we loved it!!!!! I substituted the heavy cream for milk since we don't get low fat ricotta cheese here in France and I wanted to save on fat and calories.... It turned out a bit watery, but it didn't matter! I also sprinkled grated parmesan on top to give it some extra flavor. I served it with a tomato salad and will definitely make it again!

This was very, very good, and (as promised) super easy to make. Use arugula instead of spinach because that's what we had. Very tasty and quick - will make again.
