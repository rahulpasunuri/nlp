Delicious. And lighter in color and texture than I anticipated. I was expecting dark -- it looks like milk chocolate mousse. As another reviewer noted, make sure the chocolate you use is one you like to eat -- the flavor carries through almost 1:1.

Easy to make and great consistency, very light and airy. It is not very reach, so you can increase the amount of chocolate.

This is the last recipe for Mousse au Chocolat I will ever need. A neat trick a friend taught me is to save/toss one yolk for another occasion. It makes lightens the mousse and makes it less "eggy" tasting. If you're that afraid of salmonella (your stomach is full of hydrochloric acid, after all!) make pudding instead.

To Krissywatts from NYC: Salmonella can definitely be found IN the egg. Please see the following Factsheet from the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the US Department of Agriculture: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Factsheets/F ocus_On_Shell_Eggs/index.asp

Stellar Do-Ahead Recipe. Try to use the best chocolate you can find - something you would eat on it's own ... (ergo, if you're not a fan of bitter chocolate, don't use it). We like organic block chocolate, rather than the heavily processed store brands. Do make extra whipped cream for topping. Goes great with blackberries and raspberries.

I made this for my boyfriends mother and my mother. I used a coffee liqueur instead of the expresso. I served it in depression glass sherbet dishes and garnished with fresh strawberries. Very easy, tasted great and very decadent.

I thought this recipe was bitter and ended up throwing it away.

Made this two days in a row. First time with Lindt bittersweet chocolate and 1 tbsp Kahlua, second time with Sharffenberger 70% chocolate and 2 tbsp Kahlua. Sharffenberger and 2 tbsp Kahlua is the way to go. Garnish with chocolate shavings. Terrific! Am going to serve this to my book grp for lunch next week. Carrot ginger soup followed by rare roast beef on mini croissants with rosemary mayo and argulua and a capresse salad. A black pepper biscotti from an old Bon Appetit will accompany the mousse. Sounds good, no?

This is a very easy recipe (no thermometer) that works out really well. Rich, smooth mousse. I used 70% dark chocolate and it was fantastic. I also left out the espresso, but added a bit of vanilla. I served it with whipped cream because other reviews suggested you might want to cut the richness a bit, but I didn't actually think it was necessary. Great for entertaining!

Delicious and simple to make. I don't have a double boiler, so I set a glass bowl above a saucepan and it worked fine. Only difficult part is whipping the cream and eggs, which can be quite tiring.

Great mousse very delicate flavor and not too sweet. I served it with almond flavored whipped cream.

So easy and so delicious. I actually added the butter to the melted chocolate after I took it off of the heat to bring down the temperature. I tried it a few times following the recipe to the letter, but the chocolate separated into oil and solids. Did anyone else have this happen?

Great basic chocolate mousse recipe, but make sure you use pasteurized eggs; SALMONELLA IS INSIDE THE EGG.

Regarding fear of eggs. You get salmonella not from the egg but from the shell. Clean your eggs and you're fine.

YUMMMMM !!!! My new favorite chocolate mousse recipe. It's so rich, smooth, creamy and not too sweet, a fabulous dessert after an elegant dinner party or casual backyard barbecue. Very easy to make, a big plus.

I've made this fantastic recipe numerous times. I love the easiness of it and the fact that it is hard to mess up due to the great ingredients. A couple of times I played with proportions and it hasn't come out as silky as I like it, but it didn't affect the wonderful taste. When in the mood I also add fresh raspberries by dropping them into the mousse prior to refrigerating it or grate a little bit of orange zest on top. As far as eggs, I usually use either organic eggs from a supermarket or fresh eggs from a farmer's market. Never had a problem with salmonella, so I think it is an unfair review by A Cook from Tempe, Arizona who gives it one fork simply because the recipe calls for raw eggs. Silly. Have fun with it! It is truly a classic.

What about food safety? In the U.S., unless you have access to pasteurized eggs, you could be giving people salmonella with this recipe. Either the recipe should be modified to make it safe, or you should include suppliers of safe eggs.

This was my first time making mousse, and it was surprisingly easy. I used Scharffen Berger chocolate and substituted coffee liqueur for the espresso. It turned out really good!

Delicious!! I added cognac instead of espresso with excellent results. Definitely a keeper!!

Fast, easy and delicious. I used Scharffen Berger bittersweet chocolate and substituted 1T Kahlua for one of the tablespoons of hot water, being too lazy to make the espresso. It had a perfect mousse texture and a full chocolate flavor. Served in fancy dishes it would be a lovely make ahead dessert for guests or a special occasion.
