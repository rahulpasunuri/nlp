This recipe is excellent. It tastes just like I remember it as a kid. I used low fat mayo and sour cream, omitted the garlic entirely, and used a little lowfat buttermilk to thin it a bit.

Fresh, bright, delicious! Using lowfat sour cream doesn't impact taste or texture. I thinned it a bit with a splash of milk and tossed with romaine.

Wow! This recipe is wonderful. I served it as a dipping sauce for shrimp cocktail. I would make this recipe again in a second, and other than using low fat sour cream, I didn't change a thing. Our guests raved!

With yet another head of romaine to use up, I decided to finally try the "Green Goddess". I checked all the recipes and this was the one with the most forks - and boy is it good! I made it with light mayo and light sour cream, but everything else as the recipe says. Does anyone have a recommendation on how to thin it out without unbalancing the flavour? I like a nice runny dressing, but I don't want to just throw in pickle juice like my Mom would.

This is a fantastic dressing. I made it to go on poached salmon and it was soooo good. I even made it with fat-free sour cream and it was still fantastic.

I made the other Green Goddess Dressing and decided to try this one for another fondue dinner...Frankly, I LOVED this one even MORE then the first....Excellent compliment to the Filet Mignon, the Shrimp and Lobster tails (this time)....Green Goddess is only supposed to be for a dipping sauce for the vegetables as were the instructions from my favorite fondue restaurant, BUT I like it on EVERYTHING.... Fondue sit down dinners are back and so easy....Try one sometime to impress anyone you want....But do make this ahead and add to your list of dipping sauces.....Its a WOWSER!!!

Excellent, fresh taste and very easy to prepare. My market was out of chives so I had to use all green onions and I used plain white wine vinegar but I don't think that made a difference. It tastes even better the second day. Can't wait to try it on things other than salad.

I love this dressing! It is a big hit with everyone I make it for! Excellent with fresh tomatoes, and romaine lettuce, with a few other salad veggies.

We use this on BLT's and turkey sandwiches, really adds something extra. I also use this in macaroni salad, a wonderful change from the same old dressings

Absolutely delicious and gets better by the day if you keep in the fridge.

Wow, it really is green! Tastes better after a day or two as opposed to freshly made, but a good alternative to store brands.

Splendid! This is my mother's favourite salad dressing. I made up a batch for her, and she loved it. I would serve this over romaine tossed with radicchio and kale - the bite of the last two complement the mild sweetness of the dressing.

This dressing was incredibly delicious! And so versatile. We've used it not only on salads, but baked potatoes, as a veggie dip, and on toasted baquette slices with london broil. Everyone loves it.

Try this one with romaine, thinly sliced seeded cucumbers (make sure you let them drain first before mixing, they'll give up a lot of liquid), and sliced avocados. Totally addictive.

This is by far my favorite salad dressing. My mother used to make it when I was growing up and I haven't been able to find the exact recipe until now. It's perfect.

Oh boy is this good. I've made it several times and it has officially joined the ranks of homemade salad dressings that have ruined me for bottled dressings forever more.
