Made it the same way as most of the rest - threw in the seed goodies with the second kneading, put a handful of oatmeal on top at the end. Having made the fatal flaw of the milk being too hot before (thereby killing the yeast and no rising of bread), I was hyper-sensitive to NOT go over the 115 degrees, and erred on the low side. Took about the same time, maybe a tad longer than the recipe. For rising, I turned off my oven after it reached 200 degrees and put the covered dough in there. Delicious recipe! Definitely a keeper! Curious how much others have depended on a dough hook to do the kneading...?

Reading reviews before making this dough was really helpful. I think that it saved me from some potential mishaps. I did use Rapid Rise yeast as my "dry yeast." Also, after mixing the milk, honey and sesame oil in a medium saucepan, I used a candy thermometer which read at halfway to 130F. Since my thermometer doesn't start until about 130F, there wasn't a specific number associated with this warmth, but perhaps it was around 65F. Anyways, it wasn't more than just warm (vague, I know). After this, I followed the recipe as instructed, but added the seed/goody mixture after mixing in the milk and before adding the all purpose flour (while the dough was sticky enough to receive the seeds). I did not cut slits into the surface of my loaves.

Mixed all the seeds into the dough for the second rise, topped the loaves with oats before baking and it came out perfect. And I'm not an experienced bread maker!

Great recipe although I modified it so much I have no idea what the original would taste like. I substituted a mix of cornmeal, oat bran, flaxseed meal, quinoa flour for 3/4 cups of the whole wheat flour. Didn't have pecans or caraway seeds. Also did not cut slits into bread as I found the dough started to lose air when touched so just brushed egg white on top and sprinkled seeds. Love it.

This was delicious. Instead of certain seeds in separate locations, combined seeds in the entire mix, as well as a garnish. Substituted vanilla almond milk for regular milk. Could easily become a household favourite.

"too hot" is any heat that makes you say "ouch!" when you stick your finger in it. If your bread didn't rise, your milk was probably too hot which killed your yeast. For safety in this and other bread recipe, buy instant or rapid rise yeast that you add to dry ingredients, and just barely warm the milk. It'll still rise fine, it just might take an hour longer. I got distracted and added all the seeds in the first mix and it was still great. I've made this multiple times since, once with bran instead of bulghar and it was delicious then too. the sesame oil is a great addition.

My first attempt was not a success, but I know I will love it when I get it right. How hot is too hot for the milk mixture? Also...why didn't my my dough rise at either resting period? Too much kneading? Adding too much white flour? Any suggestions will be appreciated! Thanks. : )

i like this bread recipe, but it took a few tries to get it right. i think putting half the yeast in with the flour and half with the warm milk kinda gets it going a lot better [my first batch didn't rise so well]. i've been baking mine in glass loaf pans, which works well. i've also been mixing half the seeds in with the sesame & sunflower for flavor, and it brings out the caraway & fennel flavors in the bread.

I really liked the flavor of this bread but it was incredibly dense and heavy. It would have been nice if it raised more

I just made this and think it's delicious. Due to the altitude (Denver), I kneaded the bread longer than called for. I also mixed all the seeds in as another reviewer described. 50 minutes was too long. It only took my loaves 40 and they were quite dark.

This has become our "house bread". I bake every week and seem to go to this recipe more than others. I love the sesame oil...it's really subtle but lovely. I fold seeds and nuts into the dough before baking instead of the seedy decor described in the recipe. Great for toast, keeps well in freezer and is healthy and hearty.

I've made this bread twice now and I love it! The first reviewer had some problems, but I think if you make sure to use good yeast, make sure you get the milk mixture to at least 115 degrees (use a thermometer!) if not 120, and add just as much flour as you need (the dough will be slightly sticky), it'll rise just fine. Makes a beautiful sandwich or side!

I followed this recipe to the letter, and after investing in all those seeds, the third step of cutting into the dough and putting the seeds in deflated the dough, and it did not rise again. The result is two hard, heavy hockey pucks. I can't understand how the other reviewer could have had good results. I would suggest putting on the egg wash and seeds in the last 10 min. of cooking, if at all.

The four seeds added at the end of this recipe give the bread a unique taste. We really liked it and found it is particularly good with cheese. The method of slitting this bread makes a lovely presentation. I make a lot of bread and will definately make this one again.
