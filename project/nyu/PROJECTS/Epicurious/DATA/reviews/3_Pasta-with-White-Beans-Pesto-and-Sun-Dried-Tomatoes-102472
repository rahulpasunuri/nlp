Maybe it is partially our Italian background and being used to pasta and beans together, but my boyfriend and I both loved this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly, except I used whole wheat penne. Will definitely make it again and again.

This was pretty good, but I don't feel compelled to make it again. I don't think I care for the texture of the beans with the pasta.

I LOVE this recipe, with only a few easy changes...I add red onion slices in with the (2-3 cloves extra) garlic, a little extra wine, red pepper flakes, the spinach, and make sure that the beans and sun- dried tomatoes are well drained. This is one of my favorite dishes, both for flavor and for ease.

I will give it 3 forks for the inspiration it gave me. I omitted the beans and replaced the pasta with Butternut squash ravioli. I also added the spinach as other reviewers suggested. I also added a 1/2 cup chicken stock which made it more saucy. I think the dish had great flavor by the end!

I think what makes or breaks this dish is the pesto. We used homemade pesto and loved this dish. Not all store bought pesto is created equal. If you are using store bought pesto, you might need to add extra garlic or parmesan.

I used white northern beans that I of course drained, but wish I had rinsed them as well. The beans took over the flavor of the dish. Also everyone's kitchen works differently but my sauce reduced quickly so keep an eye on it! This dish has definite potential but I'm going to have to work on it.

We forced down one helping apiece and threw the rest in the garbage. Edible because we were hungry and had to eat, but I almost dialed pizza delivery. This is and not something I will ever cook again. I cook a lot and try so many recipes from this site and this is the first time I have ever been "inspired" to come back and warn others against a recipe!

Two forks, because I like the idea, but I will have to change the meal significantly to make it worth repeating. I was disappointed both with the flavor of the dish and with the texture of the beans. I'll make it again, but maybe add a bunch of pine nuts with the garlic and either chicken or TVP (if I want to maintain the vegetarian aspect) instead of the beans for good protein. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added a couple cups of spinach, which added some color, and I would do that again as well.

I have made this a couple times, adding shrimp, spinach and I have tried red pepper pesto. Its an easy dish, nothing special though.

OK - I know how everyone hates when people review the recipe even when they've made changes...but here I go. Instead of the sundried tomatoes and pesto, I just used sundried tomato pesto and I finished the dish with some half and half (yummy!!) (oh ya and I added some chicken because my boyfriend likes his extra protein) Anyway, this was absolutely delicious and so easy (and quick) after a long day of work. And the beans were wonderful! Try it!

So easy and very, very good. My whole family loved it!

Very tasty and quick to make. I used a very small penne pasta instead of gemelli and used the oil from the tomatoes to cook the garlic.Family loved it!

I added spinach and shrimp to this dish. Very tasty and would make again.

This has become one of my staple dishes. I make it as is and serve it with a basic red leaf salad. It's very rich and filling though, so watch out. It also makes a great lunch cold the next day.

This was very tasty. I did add roasted red bell pepper, aspargus insteaded of the spinach suggestion and crushed red pepper. A friend gave me some pesto he had made last summer and froze ooohhhhh sooooo goooood. will definatly make again as the vegtables come into season.

I added Red and Yellow peppers and about 4 cloves of garlic to the mix. I also used a store-bought vegan pesto sauce. It was delicious and very colourful. I would definitely make this again.

I've made this a few times now and really like it. It's quite hearty. Next time I'll do as so many others did and add spinach and red pepper. Sounds delish!

This is a great recipe! I sauteed a fresh red pepper with the onions, increased the garlic to 3 or 4 cloves, and added a bunch of fresh spinach at the end. I have made this recipe about 6 times in the past 4 months. Now we have a pasta machine, and the latest incarnation was with fresh fettucine made with sundried tomatoes. Yummy!

This is an okay tasting, but healthy, quick and easy meal, perfect for busy weekdays. I also added spinach -- which enhanced the colour -- and hot pepper flakes -- which enhanced the taste.

This was really just one of the nastiest things I have ever made. What a waste of the ingredients!

I made this recipe exactly as it was given and it was a hit with my family but I personally was a little disappointed by the blandness and color of the finished product. However, the fact that all of the ingredients can be stored to have on hand, and the ease of preparation, will mean that it will probably get made again in my kitchen. in the future I will probably add a little more of the pesto, a little more garlic, and possibly a pinch of hot pepper flakes to zip it up a bit.

For someone who likes to cook, but rarely as time, this is a quick and easy alternative to inferior thrown-together pasta meals. I used regular sun-dried tomatoes (not oil-packed) and added fresh spinach with the cannellini. Delicious! -- And the leftovers were great too. Would be a great for a novice chef too.

This is a wonderfully easy and very tasty recipe. It has become a weeknight standard for my husband and me. I use Knorr's pesto sauce (packet) instead of ready-made, since I have not been able to find ready-made pesto at my regular supermarket. It still only takes about 15 minutes to put the whole meal together!

This recipe has become a family favorite! Perfect for a quick homecooked meal on a weeknight. I substitute one jar of Trader Joe's Pesto and Sundried Tomatoes for the two separate ingredients listed in the recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe but I don't think I would serve it to company. The colour was really awful. Maybe it was the type of pesto or the fact that I didn't use sun-dried tomatoes in oil. I used the dried ones you soak in water for awhile. The red oozed into the green giving me a dirt brown colour. My 14 yr old claimed it looked gross but tasted great.

Very quick and easy! Delicious flavors. Even my 2-year old eats this dish. Good for leftovers too. I've made this for friends who have had new babies as a "mom-din".

A quick ensemble of ingredients you would not consider mixing but work rather well together.

We all enjoyed this dish. It tasted like an authentic Italian pasta. Next time we will try adding some red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.

This dish is very tasty and easy to make. Perfect for a hurried dinner after work. The beans lend an interesting texture to the pasta. I served this with garlic bread and baby carrots cooked in chicken broth
