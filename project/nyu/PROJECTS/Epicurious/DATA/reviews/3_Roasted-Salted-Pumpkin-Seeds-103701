$2 pumpkins at my local store so i had plenty of pumpkin seeds, fun and easy to make. i dried the seeds out first overnight in a warm oven. added a little garlic and paprika for some zing

Every Halloween I try to make toasted pumpkin seeds and every year they are lousy. I was tossing them in oil then roasting them in the oven. Half of them usually wound up on the oven floor after popping off the try and the other half were tough. This dry-roast method on the stove top worked well, and only 1 seed popped out of my pan. Thanks for setting me straight.

I love these- I used olive oil, salt, chili powder and granulated maple syrup- it makes a kind of "kettle" flavor. great and quick!

to dry- try to make small amount first to make sure you like them. may pop- don't worry. kids (like me) like to watch them

I tried Rene's recipe with soy sauce and it was fabulous. I've had roasted pumpkin seeds before and wasn't crazy about them, but these are really good!

Another seasoning suggestion: along with the olive oil and salt add some curry powder -- the real thing is the best. I grind my own, which is a bit of work (don't have electric spice grinder), but so worth it.

I rince the pumpkin seed when I take them out of the pumpkin. then place them on parchment paper and spray them with cooking oil. then I lightly salt them. and the rest of the recipe is great. 350 F at 20- 25 mins or till golden brown. I use the recipe alot around halloween.

I tried a recipe for toasted pumpkin seeds based on one for toasted butternut squash seeds with outstanding results. Boil fresh pumpkin seeds in salted water for about 5 minutes. Drain seeds; salt damp seeds generously with popcorn salt (superfine). Spread out on nonstick cookie sheet and bake 20-30 minutes at 325 degrees until seeds are dried out and some very slightly browned. The resulting seeds are light and puffy; some even pop when you eat them. We ate most of them straight off of the pan. No drying out or oil necessary.

I used to bake mine as well but I like this better. Seasoned salt and soy salt suggestions definitely made it great.

I love roasted pumpkin seeds. One thing we like to do at our house is instead of using regular salt try using seasoning salt. It really gives it a little extra kick.

This recpie worked out great. I had some left over pumpkins that were still good so after scooping them out and baking them for pumpkin puree, I decided to try toasting the seeds. First I rinsed them off and let them drain in a colander for a little while. Then I heated up a heavy bottomed frying pan (not cast iron, just a regular one) till fairly hot. I tossed in the still slightly damp pumpkin seeds. They coated the bottom in an even layer. I shook the pan and/or stirred the seeds every few minutes to keep things from burning. After several minutes of shaking the seeds started to get little brown dots in the middle. This is a good sign. A minute or so after that they start shaking and spinning, like popcorn popping. This is the sign they're almost done. After a goodly portion have 'popped' (puffed up or spun around) take the pan off the heat, sprinkle w/ olive oil and salt and chow down. Very yummy

I wish someone would try this & review it. I'm afraid I would scorch the seeds. Since there isn't another roasted pumpkin seed recipe and it's close to Halloween I'll give anyone looking for one ours. After cleaning and rinsing the seeds let dry on a baking sheet. They don't have to be totally dried out for this recipe. Slow roast the seeds in the oven at 250 turning every 10-15 mins. When the pumpkin seeds are dried out drizzle with olive oil, soy sauce (go easy) and salt. Stir well. The soy lends great tast and a nice browned color. These can take up to an hour or so to cook.
