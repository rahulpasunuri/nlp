Though the cake was tasty in terms of flavor, it was a brick in terms of consistency. The long cooking time was likely the reason. But at 1 hour, it simply wasn't cooked in the middle when I did the skewer test.

This is a very good cake if you are looking for a loaf-style cake. It was easy to make (I made the orange version) and very flavorful. I only baked it for one hour though. I can see how it would have turned into a brick if you went for the full time listed. Definitely check the cake after an hour and see if it is ready.

The batter is very thin but it bakes into a nice, firm loaf. I made the orange version and agree that is better after a day or two. To my taste, the orange flavor could be stronger but it is very enjoyable as is.

This cake was terrible, hard as a rock and I followed the directions to a T. What a waste of money!

This cake was terrible and I'm not sure why. It literally came out the consistency of a brick, I followed the directions to the letter. What a waste!

I made the orange cake, and absolutely loved it. The cake is moist and has intense orange flavor. It also age very well, so it's better if it's made in advance. One side note, I used homemade creme fraiche, and cut sugar amount to only 1 cup (I don't like cakes too sweet)
