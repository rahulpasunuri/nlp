I love this! I'm a big fan of soaking grains, so I was immediately intrigued by the recipe. It was so moist and a little chewy. I did everything exactly as called for and will make this again and again! For those of you not too familiar with soaking, it actually makes the nutrients in the grain much easier for your body to digest. It's been done for centuries and we're rediscovering the technique now.

Oh dear, cook from Asia. Cornflakes? Really? Your 2 fork rating is throwing off the aggregate score so some people just looking at the rating might not realize that this is The Best Cornbread Ever.

I fancy myself a cornbread aficionado, and this was wonderful cornbread! I didn't bother with soaking polenta overnight; just used regular (coarse ground) cornmeal and added it to the dry ingredients. I also sauteed the corn kernels in some of the bacon drippings before adding them to the batter. What makes this recipe special is coating the pan with bacon drippings. It makes the crust crispy and taste just like bacon. Genius. To the reviewer who rated this two stars and used crushed CORNFLAKES rather than cornmeal: that was your problem. Yuck! Cornflakes do not = cornmeal. Try it with cornmeal, and you'll be a convert.

Holy HANNAH! This is devine! My boyfriend had a bite and said he wanted it for his next birthday cake! Which isn't to say it's too sweet, it's not. He doesn't love sweet cake. Here's what I did different. Like the last reviewer I used cheese instead of corn (2 cups). I didn't use as much sugar as called for (about 1/4 cup less, and not too tightly packed). I didn't have two cups of buttermilk so I used 1.5 cups and a half cup of really gone off milk, arguing "it's the same thing." Everyone I live argued that it was not, but were forced to give in when they tasted the bread. Furthermore when I started mixing the other ingredients, I poured any un-soaked fluids off the top of the soaking polenta before adding them. One last thing.... I served it with a dipping bowl of gravy :)

I omit the corn, add some chunks of cheddar cheese and cook it in a pre-heated cast iron skillet. Unbelievably good stuff.

I couldn't find cornmeal so I used crushed cornflakes instead. I also sprinkled salt flakes and chili flakes over the batter. The bread was interesting taste-wise. Sweet and savoury all at once. But the texture was weird...gummy like half cooked batter. The batter did seem rather liquid...I wonder if the proportion of flour was misprinted? I note that it says "1 cup*s*".

Good special occasion cornbread. Nice corn flavor. Enjoyed leftovers with chorizo scrambled eggs on top.

"This cornbread had corn in it!" That's the response I get from everyone I serve this to. This is, simply, the best cornbread recipe ever. I make it for everyone I love and they LOVE IT. Do not be afraid of leaving the polenta and buttermilk out on the counter over night (I was, scientist that I am). It works. I have made this recipe at least twice a year since 1999 and it has been perfect. It is moist, delicious, and your guests will thank you.

loved it. moist and just sweet enough to balance some incendiary chili served with it. given the amount of fresh corn in it, it would make sense that it would get moldy if you didn't refrigerate the leftovers. i'm thinking it would be great for breakfast as well.

Okay, dig this. To make a faster version that doesn't require soaking overnight and risking spoilage, use regular corn meal half and half with prepared polenta, the kind you can buy in a sausage-like tube. I also gave the corn kernals a quick pulse in the microwave so they were more of a texture that unified with the corn bread and less like whole raisins or blueberries in a muffin. Works nicely with added minced jalepenos.

I love this cornbread; it's moist, delicious, the best cornbread ever. Isn't it amazing how we all get such different results? Oh well, vive la difference.

It started out sounding divine but upon tasting it was bland. Also, and this could be my fault, but because of how moist it was due to added corn, the bread turned moldy within one day.

I love this bread it is really good.I used a cast iron skillet though which I thought n=might give it more flavor and it turned out wonderfully.It was delicious.:)

I made this for Thanksgiving and was somewhat disappointed. It's a little dry, and on the bland side...here's what I would do to make it better...add more brown sugar and more honey, to sweeten it a bit. Use less (a lot less)corn, and more bacon. Also, if you can do it in a cast iron skillet, it will really add flavor to this otherwise boring bread.

Didn't do much for me. Bland, and didn't like the whole kernals of corn in the bread.

Maybe I did something wrong--but I followed the instructions and even baked a little longer: bland taste and the bread tasted like it wasn't done.
