BBQ is awesome. I don't like this cut of meat as it takes forever to actually get the ribs tender on the grill. Took 3+hrs for my ribs to get tender enough and I put water in the aluminum pan so they wouldn't get dried out. Flavor was great but I might try this on a regular cut of ribs or even a brisket.

Fantastic recipe as is. Used one chipotle and it was just the right amount of heat. This recipe also works as a base for experimenting with other flavors. Substitute 1/2 cup of blueberry preserves (or another fruit) for the cherry or use a different type of chili (jalapeno or habanero) in place of the chipotle.

Very good sauce. IT definetly has a distinct flavor. It was a split vote in this house. I will make it again. One chipolte was perfect, just enough of a kick. Would hold back on either the lemon zest or juice. Not sure which one. Didn't even have to use salt or pepper. Very easy to make.

Spectacular! I modified the recipe a tad (check it out with my slow cooking instructions at www.carolinescravings.com) by adding some vanilla and using tomato sauce instead of ketchup. The creators of this recipe are genius! I used this sauce with slow cooked ribs and they vanished into the bellies of very happy, very satisfied people in minutes!

I'm usually fairly picky about barbecue sauces and I like mine on the spicier side. When a friend recently gave me some homemade cherry preserves, I immediately knew I wanted to combine them with chipotles to make some kind of sauce for pork. Wouldn't you know, the planets aligned and I found this recipe in the issue of Bon Appetit sitting on my kitchen island. Made it almost as written, using 2 large chipotles (plus the TBS. adobo) and only one tablespoon of brown sugar. Paired with a grilled pork tenderloin (and then chicken, one week later!). This is my go-to BBQ sauce now. Fabulous!

Should be bottled indeed! But then again, simple and a pleasure to make. I made the dinosaur bones with this and realized that I just don't like beef ribs but this sauce is a keeper. Can't wait to slather it on some baby backs this weekend!

Excellent sauce! 1 can of chipotle was plenty enough spice of us. Did not have onion powder, substituted it with a finely minced shallot. Used it on bbq chicken. This should be bottled and sold in stores!

Made this for a 4th of July BBQ. It was amazing. I used 2 chipotles and thought it could have handled more. Everyone loved it.

Delicious! Made a couple of changes - didn't use lemon/zest, instead used cane vinegar. Also didn't use the chipotle chiles - may try them next time. Will definitely be making this again.

This is now my husband's FAVORITE barbecue sauce. It's perfect because you can add more chipotle if you want more spice. I found that sour/tart cherry preserves work well to prevent the sauce from being too sweet. Delicious on pork ribs or chicken.

Fantastic! I used fresh cherries picked off the tree in my yard, pulsed in the food processor. Added a wee bit extra brown sugar to compensate. Halved the smoke. YUMMY!!!

This recipe is a total keeper. I used it on grilled chicken, I love the complexity of flavors from the various ingredients....

Wonderful Sauce. I used it on baby back ribs... I started them in the oven at 300degrees with a beer and a little of the sauce and covered them tight-- baked for two hour and finished the on the BBQ. Delightful...

I made this recipe with baby back ribs and my husband and I loved it! The rub was very flavorful and I had some left so made a marinade with it for some chicken breasts, very tasty! I thought the sauce a too sweet for my tastes so I added a splash of cider vinegar and a bit of dijon mustard. I can't wait to make this recipe again.

This sauce was out-of-this-world good! I made it to go with baby back ribs rahter than the Dinosaur Beef Ribs, and it was just the right combination of sweet and spicy. I used one rather large chipotle pepper, so it definitely had a kick, but not too much. Everyone raved about it - it's definitely going to become a go-to BBQ sauce.
