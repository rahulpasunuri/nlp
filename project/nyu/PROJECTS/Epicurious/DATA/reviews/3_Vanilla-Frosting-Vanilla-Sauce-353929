People need to understand this is from a specialty bakery and that this recipe is meant for people who can't have gluten, dairy, refined sugar and egg. I have tried many many frostings, cupcakes and cakes. The only ones I will ever make again are these, from Babycakes. We can not have soy so I use unsweetened Almond milk and powdered Rice milk instead. I have had many "regular diet"/ no food restriction people who devoured the cakes, even eating the frosting with a spoon. Follow directions and either a strong blender or food pro. I have heated the coconut oil to liquid before adding it to a blender and that does assist the motor.

Three of my well-seasoned baking friends and I tried this recipe for a Bake Sale.. good gosh! The frosting tastes overpoweringly of 'soy' and coconut, it has an off color and is made from expensive ingredients to boot. After we tested several other recipes from the Babycakes cookbook, we all agreed that this book was put together with little or no testing when the recipes were reduced for the commercial market. It's either that or the writers don't want to give away their real recipes. If these were the actual quantities, bake times and ingredients, Babycakes wouldn't sell many cupcakes! As a previous Cafe owner and caterer I found it very disappointing.

Make this the day before the cupcakes. I added 1/3 Cup cocoa powder and sprinkled flaked coconut over the frosted cupcakes - yum! Unless you have a very strong blender I would recommend the food processor for this.
