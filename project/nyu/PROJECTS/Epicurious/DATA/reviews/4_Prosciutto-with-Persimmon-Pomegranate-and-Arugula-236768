Really tasty salad. Two slices of proscuitto worked perfectly. Followed the recipe except I made my own vinaigrette since I didn't have pomegranate vinegar: 1T pomegranate juice, 1T white balsamic vinegar, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 crushed garlic clove, 1/4t salt.

Used 2 golden mangos to make 4 servings instead of persimmon, used rasberry vinegar, walnut oil and chopped caramelized walnuts (whole foods). Use 1 T oil and 1/2 T vinegar per serving. Slice prosciutto crosswise about 1 inch wide and weigh 1 ounce per serving. 1 T walnuts per serving. 1/2 oz arugula per serving 1 T pomegranate seeds per serving 1/2 golden ripe mango per serving. Fabulous! Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Prosciutto-with-Persimmon-Pomegranate-and-Arugula-236768#ixzz1z2jgZ9gg

I simplified the assembly by strewing arugula leaves over a large platter, tearing prosciutto over top, scattering slices of persimmon and pomegranate seeds over that... forgot the nuts, oops... and made vinaigrette with olive oil, pomegranate molasses, and a bit of agave syrup to take the edge off. Drizzled dressing over the whole platter at the table. It was so very festive for Thanksgiving!

I couldn't find persimmons so subbed plums as noted in Cook's Thesaurus. GREAT salad with the prosciutto, pomegranate seeds and pistachios. We used Pomegranate Champagne vinegar. I would like to try this with persimmons and actual pomegranate vinegar. This salad does not need as much prosciutto as called for.

Ad did the cook from La Quinta, I made this with fresh orange slices instead of the persimmon. Served it Christmas Eve to family and at a holiday party for friends. Everyone loved it, and have asked me to make it again!

We loved this salad....but we didn't have it as a salad. Rather, we toasted baguette slices. Then we made the "salad" by starting with diced persimmon and then adding chopped arugula and all remaining ingredients in proportion until things seemed balanced. Then we spooned the diced mixed salad on the baguette toasts and served the salad as bruschetta. It was yummy.

Delicious - perfect for our thanksgiving picnic hike - this salad got rave reviews from guests! I used toasted walnuts in place of pecans, added a bit of crumbled blu cheese, and used white balsamic vinegar with a bit of pomegranate juice for the dressing.

I could not find pomegranate vinegar so I used raspberry vinegar instead. I also added a little fresh ginger to the dressing-yum!

Served this for Thanksgiving and it was a colorful, light contrast to the heavy meal.

Almost used the same ingredients. Used the prosciutto, pomegranates, and arugula. Added Walnuts, and shaved parmesan and pink peppercorns. Made my own walnut viniagrette and was amazing.

Add some avacado too!

I loved this and would definitely make it again. I used blood oranges instead of persimmons as they were the ones available. I didn't use the pistachios or the pomegranate seeds. I added a small amount of parmesan cheese for flavoring. Would consider making it as a main dish for a light meal night.

I made a *version* of this....leftover thin sliced baked ham instead of prosiutto. Butter lettuce instead of argula. Took my overripe persimmons and scraped the inside out and made a dressing with peanut oil, Orange/Muscat champagne vinegar and satsuma orange juice, salt and pepper....I love Epicurious for all the inspiration!

Thank you for a great recipe! Persimmons abound in Tokyo right now and when I stumbled upon some pomegranates at the local market, I decided to give this recipe a try. It's my first from this website and it was a hit! I didn't have time to make the pomegranate vinegar so I substituted Chinese black vinegar. I also substituted walnuts because I did not have any pistachios.

I've made this recipe twice and it was a hit each time. I'd scale back the prosciutto to make it more salad-like, though. Great seasonal flavors!

A nice seasonal salad with lots of different textures. I couldn't find pomegranate vinegar (even at Whole Foods!) so used sherry vinegar instead. It worked!
