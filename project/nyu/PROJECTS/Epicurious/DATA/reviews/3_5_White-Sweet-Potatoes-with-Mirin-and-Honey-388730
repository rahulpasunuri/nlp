This recipe as it stands should really fall into the category of dessert, and, indeed, I have used it as such on a couple of occasions. Often, though, I just want to add a little sweetness to a meal to balance my plate. This recipe is perfect for that, with a couple minor modifications: 1. Heat. Add some sricha or harissa, and all of a sudden what is a sugar fest becomes a tasty side dish. 2. Acid. Lemon or lime juice plays really well in the glaze, but I bet that any sort of citrus would make a tasty addition.

These were very tasty. I made once as written, and a second time with a couple adjustments that I though of the first time and just should have done. 1- used rice wine vinegar in place of white, 2- used 1T canola oil and 1/2 T toasted sesame oil in place of the corn oil. Also, the second time I used "regular" orange sweet potatoes and it turned out just fine. Made this with the hoisin pork loin. A nice change from the usual "steak and potatoes."
