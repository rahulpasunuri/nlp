I agree there is too much orange, and that the rhubarb becomes lost. Nice texture and pretty colour (my rhubarb was bright, bright red this year.) If I make this again, I will use about 1/4 the amount of the orange rind.

Good, but a little too tart.

I had trouble with the orange zest not dispersing properly through the rhubarb mixture. I should have mixed it with the orange juice before adding it. Also, the pie turned out a bit tart. Next time I think I will add about 1 1/4 cups sugar, or maybe just more strawberry preserves. I brushed the lattice crust with whipped egg instead of cream, which gave it a nice glossy crispy golden brown color.

This pie is an annual event for us. I disagree that the orange is overpowering, although I think that the cardamom does get lost; it could be that mine is a little out of date, however. I am going to try the Grand Marnier trick next time -- I also think that worrying too much about whether the rhubarb breaks down is a waste of time. It is going to taste like rhubarb pie, and the consistency has to do with so many factors that are hard to account for. (Age, time of day it is harvested, etc. etc.) Anyway, to the last poster with the extensive mods - - you need to start a blog!

This is an excellent recipe, although being well versed in pie-baking, I made a few modifications because when I read the recipe over, I knew there would be some trouble when I would attempt this in my kitchen: 1 - Be careful about the amount of orange/ other citrus added. I would not go heavy on the orange peel, and do not add any more orange juice than needed to simmer. Otherwise, the orange flavor will be overpowering. I used dried Valencia peel that I got from the health food store so I would have to worry about bitterness. 2 - Simmer the rhubarb for much less time than this recipe asks for, especially if you use an electric cook-top. I would say 5 minutes and check. Do not prod after initial combining of the wet ingredients. For most rhubarb pie recipes I've used, rhubarb is cooked in the oven while baking, just like an apple pie. 3 - Add about 4-5 tablespoons of tapioca flour after you recombine the reduced syrup and the cooked rhubarb and fold well. The tapioca flour will bind up the extra water from the rhubarb and keep your pie from becoming juice with a crust. Gives the filling a nice consistency. Definitely put more if you decide that rhubarb is too tart on its own and you want to add raspberries or strawberries. 4- This is just a preference, but if you can find it, I would use rhubarb jam or strawberry-rhubarb jam instead of strawberry preseves. However, if you like having the chunks of strawberry in your pie, preserves are fine. 5 - If you don't want to bask in the Indian subcontinental kƒÅma of cardamon powder (it is very expensive), then I would use freshly grated nutmeg, allspice, or clove powder. I just made this recipe the other day and the pie looks fantastic, just like the magazine photo, but I made a perpendicular lattice instead of one on the bias. The filling was out of this world. I recommend to all.

Made this for the Adamant Black Fly Festival pie contest and won "best in lattice" category! Great pie but really...how wrong could you ever go with a rhubarb pie in May?

What I liked about this pie was the consistency. The whole thing set-up wonderfully, and had a smooth but substantial texture. My rhubarb might have been pretty tart, or it could have been that I substituted Splenda for all the sugar, but the pie was pretty sour. I would increase the cardamom and orange next time, and try it again just because it sliced into such lovely pieces.

I thought I didn't like rhubarb but this pie prooved me wrong. I added a little food coloring because even with just the red parts of the stems it still didn't have the appealing bright color in the picture. I loved the orange and cardamon.

This is good pie. Several comments: 1.) I disagree with the remarks of the previous reviewers on the dominance of the orange flavor. I found the balance to be very good. Also, the cardamom is a wonderful addition and should not be neglected. 2.) The color of the filling was not nearly as bright and pleasing as that of the picture, despite our attempting to utilize the red sections of the rhubarb. We may consider adding some red coloring next time. Incidentally, using red pieces required a 5 lb purchase! 3.) We used Grand Marnier in lieu of the cream for brushing. 4.) The crust turned out well. Enjoy!

Rhubarb pie (straight up, no strawberries, please) is my favorite pie... that is, until I tried Raspberry-Rhubarb (2 cups raspberries with 8 cups of half-inch pieces of rhubarb). With about 1 teaspoon of orange peel and maybe a half a teaspoon of ceylon cinnamon. I think cardamom is a nice spice for certain things, and this pie may not be one of them. Cinnamon and orange complement both fruits really well.

The flavour of the cardemom was totally lost, overtaken by the orange. In fact, my boyfriend commented that he thought it was an 'orange' pie. So much for the rhubarb! There are better rhubarb pie recipes out there. One way I've found to combat the tartness is by adding white chocolate chips to the batter just before pouring into the pie crust. Give it a try!

My boyfriend asked for a rhubarb pie for his birthday and I made him this one. I had never made rhubarb pie before and this recipe is great. I will definitely make it again only next time I will leave out the cardamom and maybe add a little more orange. The cardamom adds a nice, exotic aftertaste but doesn't really fit in.

my husband don't like rubarb, but this time eat half of pie...other part was mine. To not make it runny I just cooked rubarb longer and didn't separate any juice...it worked great. Smacznego :D

I usually make a custard-like rhubarb pie (eggs, sugar and rhubarb for filling). This was much better color and taste. The rhubarb fell apart despite my best efforts, still came out fine. Filling a beautiful color.
