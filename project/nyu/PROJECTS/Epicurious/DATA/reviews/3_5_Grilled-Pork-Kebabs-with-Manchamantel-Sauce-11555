Left out the banana and this sauce was killer! Very tangy! I would make this sauce again in a heartbeat!

Very good. It was tasty, but could stand to have a bit more kick, I might leave some of the seeds in the pepper next time. Pretty easy to make as well, I made it in the oven, but I used a trick-putting the kababs directly on the rack and putting a couple of foil-covered pans on the rack below to catch the drippings. Just like a real grill. I also agree with a previous reviwer that this would make a great party dish. And don't skimp on the pineapple, so good grilled!

The pork was delicious! It took 5 minutes to whip up the marinade in the Cuisinart and the grilling time was quick too. Did not have the chilis but it tasted great anyway. My husband was really impressed. I will definitely make it again.

This was a pretty good recipe. I loved the pork in the marinade all on its own. This made a lot of sauce and the sauce did not go over as well. It needed something else added to it or taken away from it I thought. I will have to experiment...but I will make it again and modify the sauce a bit.

Oh my gosh, this was so good!!!! I am not a huge kebab fan but am always looking for things to do with pork. I cut a pork tenderloin into medallions and did everything else according to the recipe. The flavors were so delicious together - really different. This made a ton of sauce, but it would be good on another meat as well. Some kind of green is definitely needed to liven up presentation - the color is pretty blah by itself. This is time intensive but worth it!!!

Very good, mild, I would use a bit of chipotles next time I make it, in the sauce and the marinade. The kids liked the sauce.

These kebabs are extremely flavorful. I substituted pork loin for tenderloin in an effort to costs down - out of a 7.5 lb pork loin the yield was about 40 hefty kebabs for a party - to help tenderize I marinated over night- the 40 kebabs served 25 people as a main dish for a cost of about $30.00 total- everyone wanted the recipe.
