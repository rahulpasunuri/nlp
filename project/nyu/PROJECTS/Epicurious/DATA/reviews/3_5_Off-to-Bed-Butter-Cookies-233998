Even though I hate when people review recipes that they've changed significantly, that's what I'm going to do here: I didn't read the recipe thoroughly enough before plunging on ahead, and so I was horrified when I realized that I had unknowingly started a "chill before baking" cookie recipe. I'm too impatient for that! And, as several other reviewers commented, in such recipes the dough tends to be crumbly and hard to work with. So I added an egg and a splash of vanilla extract. Pressed 'em flat, sprinkled 'em with cinnamon sugar. And they turned out like the perfect hybrid of shortbread and sugar cookie.

Meh, these were ok. Nothing special and while they are certainly easy to prepare, the results are so dull it isn't worth even a little bit of work. Won't make again. Remarkably without flavor.

Instead of using a shortbread recipe for pecan bar cookies, I used this butter cookie for the base. Two things went wrong: 1]. While forming the dough into a log, it was a bit too crumbly and kept falling apart. I'm not sure if I used less butter than needed to hold the dough. 2]. After chilled, don't even try rolling it! It's clear that it wants to be a normal cookie - not a bar! If I were to have made it regular, I'm sure it would have been so-so. I more than likely wouldn't make this again.

I love the taste of shortbread, but it is just too rich for me. These cookies offer that same great flavor in a light, delicate package. Loved by kids and adults alike, this cookie is in my permanent rotation.

Very good cookie. I used a good European butter and am glad I did. Made as is - no extracts or spices - and they are perfect in their simplicity, almost toffee-like in flavor and delicately crunchy in texture. Can't wait to have them with my morning cup of tea tomorrow.

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe. The cookies were very easy to prepare and bake but I found them way too buttery. I added lemon zest to the batter and a raw almond in the middle of the cookie before baking but the butter flavor was still overpowering. I will keep looking for a great and easy cookie recipe...

I claim I am not a baker, however my friends now think I am a liar. I made these for my own birthday party so I could freeze the dough and it would be easier come crunch time. I used the premium butter and found the recipe went together easily. I added lemon zest and extract and they were a huge hit at the party! I even added some zest to the raw sugar. Watch carefully in oven and be sure to space them out as mine tended to spread. Great to have around in the freezer. I may try a nut extract next time.

I've made these cookies many times now, and always love them. They are very elegant, and not too sweet, but kids still love them as much as adults. Easy to make and delicious.

This recipe is described perfectly - crumbly and delicate - they truly are. I added 1 tablespoon anise seed. This rcipe is perefect as is or with your own addition of zest, seeds, flavoring, etc. I only got 2 1/2 doz from recipe though. Will make again.

SOOOOOOO easy and delicious. Butter cookies that are darn near shortbread, but simpler and lighter. I like to have a roll in the fridge for a quick treat, but we eat them too fast for me to keep one there!

These Off-to-Bed cookies are Off-the-Chain! Outta control easy, light, and delicious. I substituted pastry flour and will never look back. These will be on heavy rotation in my repertoire.

Better than spritz cookies! It was an extremely easy recipe and worth the time. The dough was really soft; almost frosting-like consistency. So rolling the dough and moving to a pan had to be quick. I rolled into logs, covered with plastic wrap and put in fridge overnight. Having the logs ready make it so quick and easy. Our neighbor's daughter brushed on the cream and gave the recipe 2 thumbs up. All our friends and family will get a bowl of these cookies with their Christmas basket this year.

These are more like sugar cookies than butter cookies, but delicate and delicious, nonetheless. The raw sugar on top is wonderful. I added a bit of tangerine oil and it really made the cookie. However, they weren't quite as easy to make as described. The dough was incredibly fluffy, airy and sticky - no way I could have rolled it up. I added in another half cup of flour and still no dice. Finally, I chilled it in the bowl for about an hour, then manhandled it into rolls, then chilled in the Freezer before slicing. Next time I would just pipe them out and avoid that whole ordeal.

Absolutely scrumptious. Really good to eat with your hunny before bed with some tea. I know everyone likes herbal before bed, but I'm fine with Lady Grey or some other black tea with these cookies.*******note-I didn't use turbinado sugar (didn't have it) so Imixed some cinnamon and sugar together and sprinkled a healthy dose on each cookie. Do not skip the sugar on top. Absolutely necessary. Grabulated sugar worked just fine. A nice sparkling glaze!

These were a big hit with my friends, but they need accompaniment. They'd be great with tea and with a bit of jam on top, but it was late at night and we were out of jam, so I served them with lemon wedges and honey, which was quite delicious as well. I'd definitely suggest being liberal with the raw sugar, as it is quite tasty when there's a lot, but it's a bit insignificant if there's only a light sprinkling.

A very delicious cookie! Pleasantly surprised with how delicate and wonderfully easy it was to make. I added dried cranberries to the cookie dough. My husband and family really loved these cookies. I'm going to try making them with a little bit of minced candied ginger.

Perfection. So easy, so quick, and so very good. I made the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.

This is a fabulous light cookie. Make sure to cook on a sill pat - if you don't it is easy to brurn the bottoms. The turbino sugar really adds to this recipe

These were a hit with my husband and my family! They are the perfect small nibble when you want a delicious sweet treat. The turbinado sugar is excellent on top. I can't wait to make them again!

Great and easy recipe. Did not do the turbino sugar [didn't have any], but instead added the juice of 1/2 a lemon and the zest of a whole lemon into the batter to give it a different flavor. My husband loved them so much that he said they were better than the butter cookies he gets from his favorite Parisian bakery!
