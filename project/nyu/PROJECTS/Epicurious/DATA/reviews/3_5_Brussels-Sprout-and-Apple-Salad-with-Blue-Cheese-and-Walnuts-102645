i love everything in this receipe so decided to try it and wow is it good. i left out the olive oil by mistake and didn't really miss it. i'm interested to try it again without a dump/guess on the measurements so figured out the proportions for 5 servings which is pretty close to what i tried last night and 2 of us ate every bite of it. i think it needs more celery leaves so went heavy on that. generous 1/2 lb sprouts,generous 1/2 tbs vinegar, 1/2 tbs mayo, 2.5 tbs evoo, 2 small or 1 very large apple, 1/2 celery, blue and walnuts. hope this helps and can't wait to try again.

Other that massively decreasing the quantities, I prepared this recipe as written. How yummy! Such a pleasant change from the usual brussels sprout side dish. Can't wait to make it again.

This salad is a wonderful combination of flavors. I sliced/shredded the brussel sprouts in a food processor and used Gala apples sprinkled with lemon juice. I'm not a big fan of blue cheese so I left that out. I served it with the baked pork chop menu from Bon Appetit Feb 2001. It was delicious.

We liked this recipe a lot but we are huge fans of blue cheese and it is definitely a strong flavor in the recipe. There were a few too many brussel sprouts so I would cut back on those. This is also a salad that can be saved for leftovers as it keeps for a couple of days covered in the fridge. We will make it again!

Gosh - I really like all of the ingredients included in this recipe, but I found that combining these strong flavors, especially the brussel sprouts and blue cheese, was an overload of too many distinctive tastes that are better on their own. Blue cheese on the side sounds like a good idea.

This was a hit at our annual holiday brunch. It was a great opportunity to avenge the screams from my family that people don't like brussel sprouts! For non-dairy eaters, I put the blue cheese on the side!

I love to use this recipe to punish non-gourmet family and friends who insist on my bringing a salad to dinner parties instead of a dish of my own choosing.

Nice, change of pace salad. Beautiful presentation. Had trouble finding sherry wine vinegar-used champagne vinegar with a splash of sherry. Also, cooked sprouts for only 6 minutes (personal preference). Will make again.

This dish had mixed reviews at my dinner party. People who don't like blue cheese will not like this. Next time I think I will cut down on the blue cheese, it kind of overpowered the salad.

Absolutely wonderful! Such a tasty dish,very pretty,and easy to make. I really impressed the family,especially sister-in-law & her husband on Christmas Eve. My hubby liked it too! Healthy for us all. Will certainly make this on a regular basis.

The texture of this dish is wonderful, and makes perfect use of fall produce. Next time, I might try adding more tang -- maybe stronger blue cheese.

This was a special dish, which was well-recieved at my Christmas Eve dinner. I did the sprouts and dressing ahead of time and it was easy to put together the rest. DIFFERENT and delicious.
