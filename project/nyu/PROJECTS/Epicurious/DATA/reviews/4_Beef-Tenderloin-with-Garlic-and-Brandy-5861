I was cooking a whole beef tenderloin for 12 people and wanted an easy sauce to serve alongside. I found this one and must say that not only is it easy but it is delicious. I sautéed the beef first then roasted it. I used the delicious pan juices to augment the sauce. It was very successful.

I agree with most others....really easy and very tasty. I (like another reviewer) cut the tenderloin into medallions, and man was it yummy! Super easy.

I love this recipe and get rave review from guest. I like to sautee white mushroom with the meat and double the recipe for more sauce. To thicken more quickly I use a little flour and water and you really don't need to use the tenderloin - I use sirloin and it turns out great

Great stuff. I don't like dining alone, so I called one of those services, and whamo! Two hours later I'm dining with this dame. She was hesitant about eating during a date, but it was so good, she couldn't resist. Pinot is wrong for this, as is an English stout. I recommend a Chablis.

Way too easy for how good it tasted.

Very good and a wonderfully flavorable sauce!

I have to say this was very good. I do not enjoy brandy however, and the flavor wasn't overwhelming. I cut the beef into strips and served it with stir-fried vegtables. I will definitly make this again sometime.

I forgot to mention previously that I sprinkled the steaks with McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of just salt and pepper.

WOW! For a last minute, throw-it-together meal (we planned on grilling tenderloins tonight and ran out of gas so I quickly got on Epicurious.com to find a stove top recipe), I have to say that this was one of the best quick meals I have made. Usually for a sauce to taste as good as that, I add cream and so forth. There is no need to with this recipe. I might agree with a previous review that the beef broth overwhelmed the brandy a bit, but all in all, I would rate this high up in ease and taste. I loved it and so did my husband. I used dried parsley, beef broth made from a bouillon cube and refrigerated garlic and it was still great. I would suggest cooking the tenderloins on a little lower heat for a longer period of time depending on the thickness of the steak. I served this with the Baked Cherry Tomatoes with Parm topping (but I used grape tomatoes) and we give them both two thumbs up.

The beef tenderloin was so tasty it didn't need anything with it. The sauce for me tasted too beefy and not enough of the brandy flavor came through, I did reduce it a bit too much so maybe this was the problem. I served it with Buttermilk mashed potatoes with caramelized shallots and roasted butternut squash with balsamic vinegar (also from this site). It was a fabulous meal.

Outstanding! I live alone so I just sauteed 5 beef tenderloin medallions (salted) in olive oil. For the sauce I used 1/2 tsp. of Beef Demiglaze (from Williams & Sonoma) with 1/4 cup water, 3 tbls. brandy after sauteeing minced garlic in the skillet. I will definitely make this one again!!!

I used ribeye steaks rather than beef tenderloin. The sauce was a wonderful accompaniment! I served the dish with a potato gratin, and got rave reviews.

Excellent dish! I definitely will make this dish again, not only for us, but for out guests too. The sauce is very, very good. Adding the brandy to the sauce gives it a special fragrant. I've never made filet mignon before, but with this recipe, I look like a filet mignon queen.

this recipe is SOOOOO easy! Definitely add sliced white mushrooms as well as sliced onions to carmelize with the parsley and garlic. adding a little cream as the broth part is simmering gives this a richer flavor, and a bit of butter-flour as roux would thicken this a bit very nicely. DELISH and easy. This recipe taste even better the next day if you leave the meat in the sauce overnight.

This was a very quick and easy recipe. I agree with the other reviewer who recommended doubling the sauce. Next time I make it with the mushrooms :)

Yes! It's Springtime,and what goes better with this dish other than fresh blonde morel mushrooms! We also had steamed broccolini and roasted rosemary fingerling potatoes! Doubled the sauce! Delicious!!

Very delicious. I made this over the weekend for Valentine's day, and it was tender and delicious. I cooked it a minute or two extra on each side, since I like my meat medium to medium well. I also added mushrooms and half and half to the sauce as it thickened, and it turned out great.

I realize this dish has received many reviews, but I just had to say how delicious it was and how easy it was to cook!!! Really impressed the guests at my dinner party. I took the other suggestions about the portabello mushrooms and the half&half. I cooked the tenderloin on the grill in an iron skillet with the olive oil. It was fabulous!! Something you might expect from a 5 star restaurant. Use the highest quality tenderlon you can afford.

Very good! I followed the suggestions of others and added sliced mushrooms and half & half to the glaze. Use good quality beef -- the glaze is tasty but subtle, and using a poorer quality of meat might make the recipe bland.

Delicious and easy! I took a cue from some other reviewers and added mushrooms to the sauce. It was just the right touch, and makes you wonder why they weren't included in the original recipe. Definitely a keeper.

Very good... Made it as a last minute meal. My glaze was too salty, so after reducing I threw in some heavy cream (couple tablespoons) and it seemed to make it less salty.

Rating: 4
WOW. Fantastic dish. I, too, added mushrooms as the glaze reduced. I also left it unattended and the glaze reduced to nothing, so I threw in some blend (half & half) and it was terrific. My guest raved. Easy and good. Will make over and over.

This recipe is something you could get at a very good restaurant! To enhance the sauce I reduced the sauce to a glaze and added 3/4 of a stick of butter cut in pieces. The butter melted while I stirred and a great beurre blanc type sauce was the result. Fabulous!

Rating: 2
I didn't think this was anything to write home about. The glaze wasn't that flavorful, and since the steaks weren't cooked with or in any of the sauce, the taste was even more mild. I've had many better tenderloin and filet recipes.

Best sauce I have ever tasted!!! Having prepared the steaks, I made this sauce while my guests waited in the next room...it was fast to make, smelt heavenly and tasted terrific!!! All guests complemented the sauce!!! I recommend the reader definitly try this recipie!!! Total thumbs up!

I made this for dinner last night. We had 4 guests, all of whom were very delighted with the flavor and appearance. We did garlic mashed potatoes which were very delicious.

We made this dish for 10 guests who celebrated the Millenium at our home. Instead of cutting this dish into steaks, we roasted 2 whole tenderloins ($165!! but worth it) at 375 degrees after browning them on the stove over high heat. Guests raved all evening, and my husband and son enjoyned leftover steak for breakfast for two days! GREAT RECIPE!

Very good and easy to make. I added mushrooms as I was reducing the glaze. After they were soft I topped the steaks with the mushrooms and continuing reducing the glaze. Delicious!

i found it better to cook the meat over med heat in butter it makes the meat more tender and gives the rest a better flavor
