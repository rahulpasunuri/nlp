This is a fantastic vehicle for bulgur and easily strong enough to work as a side. The crunch and sourness of the sprouts contrasts very well. I've even used it as an low meat entrée by tossing a handful of diced pancetta into the sprouts. I too cool the bulgur with chicken stock, though I don't consider it a modification.

I LOVE this recipe. I've made it a several times for friends and family on multiple occasions and everyone enjoys it (esp. me). Modifications? I prepare the bulgar wheat using chicken stock; I usually halve the amount of bulgar wheat that the recipe calls for; and I add often add fresh mushrooms to the mix.

Yummy! This really is better as a side dish than a stuffing, but it is fantastic.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and it was a bit of a letdown--not special enough. I will probably make it again (as other reviewers noted, it's pretty easy) but I'll use it as a side-dish for regular weeknight dinner.

Fabulous stuffing recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving, and even though it was not the usual breadcrumb stuffing, my family loved it. It was much easier to make than it looks - it's really just cooked bulgur, which cooks just like rice, with the addition of sauteed Brussels spouts and dried mushrooms. You have to 'cook' the dried mushrooms first, to make them edible, and using some of the mushroom stock adds depth. Sauteing the sprouts in butter is a must for a holiday dish. I will definitly make this again, and very soon.

Excellent stuff! I usually make a bread stuffing and a wild-rice based dressing. This year I made the bulgar stuffing instead of the rice one and it got raves! Our family LOVES brussels sprouts...so be aware that may be a turn-off for some people.
