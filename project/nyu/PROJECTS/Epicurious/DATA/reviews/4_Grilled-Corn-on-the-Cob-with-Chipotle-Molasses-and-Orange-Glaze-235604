Awesome! Great change for corn on the cob. Love the spice and the cilantro. Makes the cobs look amazing also. Added a bit of lime zest to the mix. Wouldn't add lime juice as is too runny. Hard to keep on the corn as it is. If you don't like spice this isn't for you.

Outstanding. Everyone in gourmet group loved it...better make 2 per person. Cilantro is unnecessary.

Love spicy, sweet recipes. Cut back on chipotle - like the flavour but not the burn. Left out cilantro - do not like!

Really great flavours. Cut back on the chipotle - like the flavour but not the burn. Love recipes with sweet, spicy combos.
