Yep. Hard to wreck this cut of meat. I would add: take it out of fridge at least an hour (2 for 3 ribs and larger) before you start in on it. And as for the "high heat seals in the juices" advice: rubbish. It does no such thing. Letting the meat rest for 30 mins after cooking attends to the juices.

The meat was the perfect doneness, but still pretty tough. Could have just been my cut of meat. The taste was very good though, and it made good gravy.

Maybe this cut is just delicious. Kind of like reading reviews on your standard filet recipes, pretty much everyone is gonna make it again, because the meat is good. Period. Agreed it is easy and delicious.

Made this for 2 w/ 2 3/4 lb one bone roast w/ some slivered garlic inserted into meat. Heavily seasoned w/ coarse sea salt and pepper and added some thyme. Seared in heavy large skillet and then finished in the oven (375) for approx 30 minutes. Temp should be at 115 and with resting will come to 125 for medium rare. Made a red wine jus. Used drippings in the pan, added some minced shallots and a splash of red wine and added some beef stock to taste. Finished the sauce with a pat of unsalted butter but cream would be excellent, too. Served w/ creamed horseradish, but also could have made sour cream horseradish sauce from this site. Sides were rosemary roasted potatoes, and roasted veggies ( carrots, asparagus, and green beans). Yum!! Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/ Standing-Rib-Roast-106702#ixzz15KCUd9Z2

I was told the best way to re-heat leftover standing rib roast! You place it in a pot with some high simmering liquid( drippings and beef broth) for about 25 minutes. Perfect, not dry at all!

Ah, my mistake. stand before cooking at room temp. at least a half hour. An hour is good.

Regarding how long to stand after cooking? About 10 minutes.

We served this on election night, not knowing how long the results would filter in and wanted a meat that could be served hot or cold. We served it as a sandwich with local bakery's rolls, mustard and horseradish. I overheard one person comment "I love this steak sandwich a bit too much."

This was delicious! Cooked PERFECTLY. I used garlic powder in lieu of the slivered garlic for two reasons: 1) I always do the slivers in my old original pork roast recipe (though I've now switched to the Garlic Rosemary at this site) & wanted something different...and 2) I was in a hurry 'cause it's a weeknight...FABULOUS !

Excellent!! We live at 5600 ft., so had to add an hour to the cooking time to bring it to 135 degrees.

This roast is comparable to a fabulous prime rib in a nice restaurant. It's so easy its not even funny, and it always gets rave reviews. I've been asked for the recipe every time I make it. It's a keeper.

This was my first roast, too, and it came out absolutely perfect. Juicy and perfectly medium rare. I don't know why I was so daunted--this recipe really is foolproof. I made just a 4-lb roast and adjusted times accordingly, and the recipe was still a hit.

I made this one for Mothers' Day and it was my first standing rib roast! I followed directions exactly for a 7.4lb three rib roast. It was perfect! This will be the recipe I will always use for this splurge. My Mom likes medium rare so we did not pull it out until it was almost 140 degrees on our meat thermometer. It was a perfect medium- rare in the center. I plan to try for rare on an occasion without Mom.

This was a fabulous roast! My grandmother would have been proud. I had to call my sister to verify times as she has carried on the tradition. She agreed to the timings, so I went ahead. Delicious, delicious! and simple! I even left the house to run a few errands. A keeper.

This is one fool proof out of this world family pleaser. Great fodder for sour dough sandwiches at Chrissey field picnics on Sunday. Life is good here.

Super easy to make and delicious! The garlic is a great addition.

I'm not a real experienced cook, especially when it comes to meats, so finding a simple recipe that turns out so perfectly is a marvel. I received compliments all around the table at Christmas that it was a "really good roast." My guests, who a returning for Easter dinner actually requested it again.

Absolutely delicious and s-o-o-o simple to make. I rubbed a very small amount of olive oil before roasting just so that it could brown better. Accompanying dish was garlic roasted red potatoes.

We made this dish for a small dinner party about a week before Christmas. Everyone loved it. I couldn't stop thinking about it and decided to make it a week later for Christmas Dinner! The entire house smells delicious. Make sure you make enough for left overs.

This is a very simple but excellent presentation. We roasted the meat in a convection oven which tends to cook the meat more evenly. Next time, however, I would reduce the cooking time slightly for medium rare. We live at 5,000' so you folks at the lower elevations would definitely want to reduce the cooking time.
