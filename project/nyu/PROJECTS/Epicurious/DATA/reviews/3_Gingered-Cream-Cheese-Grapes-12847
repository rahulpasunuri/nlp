I was disappointed with this recipe; very bland, even after mixing the cream cheese and ginger the night before. Family members agreed that they weren't BAD but definitely not GREAT.

I served these on an hors d'ouvres buffet with lots of spicy stuff. Everyone loved them, and they were good for breakfast the next day, too!

I don't think I would have liked these as much had I used low-fat or fat-free cream cheese. They were tasty with regular cream cheese, though I only could eat about 3. I too would recommend serving them with a dessert plate or as one of a few light appetizers in the summer.

I could not move around the room fast enough with these grapes! My guests went crazy for them and I have had to pass on the recipe numerous times.

Oh my goodness! I don't know what might have gone wrong, but I did not find these very tasty. I took them to a dinner party without trying them first, and by the end of the night they were one of the only items still left on the serving table. The ginger was overpowering and the cream cheese flavor did not mix with the grape. I was very disappointed.

This was not especially well received as a before dinner snack. I think it would be delicious for a dessert tray. People were very surprised to find a grape inside.

You have to try these. They are wonderful! If you are looking for something really different, this is it. I think it is a fun snack for kids to make.

This was putzy to make but so interesting and fun. I served it on red cabbage leaves and it looked beautiful. Guests were intrigued and kept going back for more. It was actually fun to make and so different it was a conversation starter. We had this with a peach/cream cheese/carribbean spice spread with dainty light crackers and champagne. Wonderful combination.

This is very strange tasting. I made them and they were eaten quickly but people couldn't decide if they were delicious or disgusting. The reason they were gone so quick is curiosity. Nice idea though.

I made this for a ladies luncheon and everyone raved about it. They were usually surprised to find a grape in the center. I assembled the grapes on leaves to resemble a bunch of grapes.

Great! Took these to an office snack-potluck today & almost had to police the table to keep folks from taking a plate full! Labor-intensive, but terrific.

I've served these at two different parties--a birthday and a holiday party. They're so unusual and attractive and light that they're always a stand out. People are amazed when they learn what they are.

Oh My Gosh!! This recipe was the best!! The flavor is wonderful and the varieties of texture is such a delight!! The roasted pecans add a crunch, the cream cheese is of course creamy and the grape is the sweet surprise in the middle!! I made this for a party and did not tell anyone what was in the middle!! My guests loved it!! It is incredibly easy to make and healthy too!!
