I made a few modifications. Had to use vanilla extract instead of almond in the crust because it was all I had. Also, could only find chestnuts without syrup so used those and made my own sweetened chestnut paste (put a few chestnuts, some powdered sugar and some heavy whipping cream into my mini-food processor) and added about a cup of that to the batter. It got good reviews, but I didn't think it stood out. Perfectly enjoyable, but nothing particularly special and really don't know that there would have been much chestnut flavor without the paste I made.

I made this when it first appeared in 1997 for Christmas. My mother still remembers it after all the years as one of the best she's had. Recipe is perfect as is and the chestnuts in vanilla syrup are heavenly.

I live in a small town, so when I said I was bringing Chestnut Cheese cake to our get together the response was underwhelming. However when a 17 year old male says something (anything) is exquisite, well let's just say there weren't any leftovers. This exceeded my expectations. UMMM!

This cheesecake was delicious and very easy to make. I made it for New Year's and everyone commented on how special it was. I found a jar of candied chestnuts at a local middle eastern market for $3 and they were perfect. I also added a small tin of sweetened chestnut paste that I got at the supermarket. Everyone felt that without the extra chestnut paste it would have been just a regular cheesecake with some chestnut pieces. The paste gave it a very smooth chestnutty taste which was great.

The marrons glace I found were whole, sugared, andwrapped in paper and not in a syrup. 1 tin (5 ounces) - priced at $24 - sufficed to cover the bottom of the cheesecake. I also added 12 ounces of an imported French chestnut puree to the cream cheese filling to enhance the chestnut experience. I served the dessert on Christmas Eve and everyone was very pleased with it.

It was basically very easy to make, I did not use marron glacee, it was not available here in Nigeria but I substitued whole chestnuts, pureed them and added them to the cream cheese mixture, it was extraordinary, my guests raved about it. I would definitely make it again.
