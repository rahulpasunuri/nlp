This cake was a smidge dry, but the icing definately makes up for it. Be sure to put plenty of icing in between the layers. The fresh coconut, paired with the cake absorbs some of it. Also, the almond really comes through with this cake, it adds alot to the flavor composition of the cake. I'm southern, and this isn't quite the traditional southern coconut cake...but it is absolutely delicious.

I DO NOT GIVE THE FOUR FORKS BECAUSE I ONLY MADE THE CAKE. I BAKED IT IN CUPCAKES AND THEY TURNED 0UT VERY GOOD, NOT DRY AT ALL.NEXT TIME I WILL MAKE THE WHOLE RECIPE.I USED REGULAR FLOUR, SIFTED THREE TIMES AND TOOK TWO TABLESPOONS OUT.ALSO USED WHOLE MILK.THIS RECIPE IS A KEEPER.

I've made this cake several times for a coconut lover. Recently I served it with sliced strawberries and the sweetest mango. It was very tropical and simply delicious.

I made it for my mom's birthday since she loves cocnut and she absolutely loved it and helped herself to seconds! For the people who had dryness issues: I did not use cake flour, nor did I sift it. But I did put some of the fresh coconut juice onto the cake layers while they were still warm, and I had no issues with it being dry at all. My only problem is that the icing seemed too sweet for my taste and I thought would have overpowered the cake had I not only put it on the top. I think next time I make it, I'll use a simple whipped cream icing with fresh stawberries or raspberries.

Maybe you have to be a southerner (or have southern roots) to really appreciate this cake. It's just like the one my grandmother made as well (from east Texas) and will become a tradition in my household.

Made this recipe for my cooking club, and it was the smash hit of the year. I'm quadrupling the recipe to make it again for a friend's baby shower, using raspberry filling. Great recipe with subtle coconut flavor.

I'm adding an addendum to my review one month later: after baking a few more things and re-reading this recipe, I realized I did not sift the flour BEFORE measuring, like the recipe said. I wonder if all the other "dry" reviews failed to follow the instructions like I did. I'm sure it'll make a world of difference!! I'm a beginner baker and was looking for coconut cake that tasted like the one my grandmother used to make. Well, I didn't heed all the warnings here. The cake looked beautiful, but came out dry! It had a delicious taste, but was just too darn dry. I served this for Easter dessert and people politely ate, but did not finish their cake. :( I think the key to this tasting like grandma's is the almond extract. The 7-minute frosting came out great and took about 10 minutes. I will try to make this again, but will search for other ways to make it moist before I begin.

Oh my gosh! This was the BEST coconut cake I have EVER made, and I would gladly do it again. I made it for Easter yesterday, and it was a HIT! Thanks so much for the fantastic recipe!

I think that 1/2 t. cream of tartar in the icing was a bit too much. It left a whangy after taste and I ended up scraping a lot of the frosting off the cake.

Maybe this is the recipe "Hartford, CT" should make. It's right up his/hers "gourmet" alley! I thought it was wonderful, but then again I liked the coconut cake using the boxed mix also.

This was exactly the recipe I was looking for when my mother asked me to resurrect my grandmother's coconut cake. To ensure that the cakes were not dry, I didn't bake them quite as long and drizzled fresh coconut juice on them while warm. Also, I beat the egg whites separately til almost stiff and folded them into the batter. This was delicious, and Grandmama would be proud.

I'm from the south and this is just like my Grandmother's. The frosting is called 7 minute frosting.It's similar to an Italian meringe. It will get grainy if you let the water touch the bottom of your double boiler. Another note if it cooks too long and gets stiff fold in some pecans and ya get divinity.

Very yummy. For the record, you can used canned coconut and the cake still tastes great. The icing is a bit sweet, but we liked it that way. Easy to make.

The cake was delicious but my icing was granular...perhaps I didn't get the temperature of the water hot enough during the preparation of the frosting?

I was so greatful for the information about how to tell your coconut is fresh -- my first one was rancid, but the second one was fine and the cake came out great! This type of icing is not my favorite because it's so sweet, so in the future I'll make the cake again but try out a different icing.

This is just like the cake my Southern mother and grandmother used to make. It is really delicious. However, I remember my mother always made it at least 2-3 days in advance and put it in the refrigerator or even better, froze it. It needs the time for the flavor to develop. It also insures that the cake is moist. I believe 30 minutes is too long for the cake layers, mine took a only a little over twenty minutes.

this Recipe was so good I made it two times. People should try this cake it was wonderfull.

I loved this cake. I have made it 4 times and entered it into a cake auction and it went for $140.00. Like most recipies you need to modify, modify, modify. The cake should not be baked for entire time, keep an eye on it so it does not dry out. Make sure your coconut is fresh, and not spoiled. The rich aroma is amazing. Love it!!

I don't know about those who made this cake before and gave it such a low rating, but I found it a good cake. The dryness can be prevented by moistening the cake halves. Only minus is that whipping the frosting took me almost half an hour.

Worst cake I've ever tasted.Definitely not worth the effort. Shame on Gourmet magazine for not testing this recipe before it went to print... or maybe they did test it!!! hummmmm.

it was not good. Too flat and no falvor. I should have read the other reviews before I tried it.

Dry, dry, dry! I followed the recipe to the letter, and it was quite a disappointment. A waste of time and ingredients.

The hard work put into this cake was hardly worth it. The coconut was almost tastless in the cake and even on the icing. Also, the cake's size was disappointing because it didn't rise very well. I made it for my Mom's birthday, thought it was going to be special. I made two to make a nice sized cake. NEVER AGAIN!

This is simular to my gmothers, she would drain the milk out of the coconut and drizzle it over the warm cake layers.
