Good way to use up extra applesauce. Interesting, I had an opposite reaction. I found the cake a bit too moist. Liked the cake, but would also reduce total amount of spices by 1 teaspoon.

I liked this recipe overall. It fit my needs at the time, which were to find a use for my leftover homemade applesauce and provide a nice and healthy snack/desert for my family. I made a few alterations due to the limitations of my cupboard. I used currants instead of raisons and microwaved them in the rum (covered) to save time. I omitted the nuts. I used "pumpkin spice" that I had on hand, using 2 1/2 tsp., which I think gave it an subtle autumn flavor. It was nice with a cream cheese/bourbon vanilla icing on top. I think next time I would use more applesauce to make it more moist.

I'd cut clove amount in half as one teaspoon makes the taste very strong. Would also follow advice for adding more applesauce as I found this a little dry.

this cake was quite tasty - I added extra applesauce and it turned out very moist. My family gobbled it down.
