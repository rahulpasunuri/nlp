If you want to heighten the poblano flavor I suggest broiling them in the oven first, then wrapping them up to "sweat" and once they have cooled slightly, remove the puffed skins (which tend to get chewy/tough when left on) and then chop the peppers. I also used five large poblanos instead of four. If you want more heat, throw in a jalapeno. ... When I removed the meat, I deboned it and then put it back into the sauce to make more of a stew. Then I served it with avocado, cotija and tortilla chips. ... Also, make sure you salt and pepper each layer as they go into the crockpot. I had no issues with it being bland. YUM!

Skinless thighs would be a better choice for this dish. I used extra garlic and doubled the chicken which produced a lot of liquid, maybe too much. I added the sour cream and a little shredded cheddar to thicken but didn't get a gravy-like sauce that I'd hoped for. Sadly I think canned chilis would help enhance the green chili flavor better. It just didn't quite hit the mark, but still produced tender, flavorful chicken.

A simple and satisfying dish! I usually prepare this for my parents and they love it! But, when I used to prepare this for my kids they dont appreciate this one. So, I do some research and I come up with this fantastic recipe which I find here: http://chicken.gourmetrecipe.com/Popular_Chicken_Dishes_Orange_Chicken! Got to shot on this one for more fantastic chicken recipes!

This is one of our favourite crockpot meals. I par-boil a whole roasting chicken and then place that in the crock pot. I double the onions and garlic and add an extra poblano or two. I also add black beans. Not everyone here are fans of sour cream, so I thicken with 1/4 to 1/2 cup of instant mashed potato flakes at the end, if necessary. But the chicken, onions and poblanos make their own delicious juice.

This recipe is so easy, and very good. I have made it several times and have found it to be a big hit. I did read a few reviews that said this dish was "bland," and "lacking something." The thing in common with all these reviews is that they all used boneless, skinless pieces of chicken. If you are going to slow cook this dish it is very important it at least has the bone in. That is where you are going to get all the flavor. Omit the bone = omit the flavor. And you will not get it back, no matter how much you doctor the dish. I recommend to the previous reviewers that did not like this dish due to "lack of flavor" to try cooking it with dark meat chicken that has the skin still on and the bone still in. Even a breast that is skin on and bone in will work. You will not be disappointed.

Meh . . . Despite pre-reading all the reviews and despite efforts to up the flavor quotient accordingly, this recipe still required so much doctoring it was almost comical . . . I used fresh corn right off the cob and boneless skinless thighs (normally a very flavorful meat), a huge and spicy Poblano, etc. I added extra garlic and salt, and also supplemented with an Adobo mix from Pensey's that contained more salt, garlic, cumin, coriander, etc. And it STILL turned out amazingly bland. So after shredding the chicken and adding the sour cream and cilantro, I was forced to doctor again, this time with chili powder and some cayenne. Still blah. I finally decided just to treat more as a chili, and served topped with melted cheese and some chopped tomato. This was finally . . . acceptable, but nothing to write home about. It occurs to me that the real problem might be the slow cooker method, which could be the thing leaching all flavor out of the ingredients. I'd like to give this another try, only this time treat as a quick skillet dinner. Something tells me the results will be better. ??

Was just OK for me. Since I'm not a "chef", I look to epicurious recipes to tell me exactly what spices to put in. Tried to doctor it, but was just lacking something.

A pretty lackluster recipe that needed a LOT of spice and salt added afterward for flavor.

Yummy dish. I only had a small amount of chicken breasts on hand so I added zucchini and potatoes to fill up the slow cooker. I prefer to eat mostly vegetables anyway. I also love garlic so I added some extra as well as some chicken base. I cooked the ingredients on high for 3 hours (your machine might be different) and the chicken was moist and broke apart easily to spread it throughout the dish. I didn't bother removing the stems of the chiles. The sweetness of the poblanos in the cream was the star of the dish, but I wanted more. I'd recommend using at least 6 poblanos if not more instead of the 4 in the recipe. It's a great dish for when you're craving something with poblanos but don't want to go through the trouble of roasting and peeling. It was better just made than reheated. Husband loved it.

I put this in my crock pot in the morning on high and it was completely done by lunch. Meat was really tender and the chilis were soft and flavorful! I added lime juice but no extra liquid and it was great!

The whole family loved this, but it needed a little doctoring. Trader Joe's didn't have poblanos, so I used green bells & jalapenos (2 each). Also 1 pkg. boneless skinless thighs & 1 pkg. drumsticks. I added lime juice, a pinch of cayenne, and some cream cheese to the sauce. Warm corn tortillas on the side to soak up the juice. Yum! Curious about all the comments about it being bland. "Season to taste" goes without saying... a little more salt & pepper made it perfect. Cooking is an art, not a science :)

After considering some of the comments, I decided to add a Serrano chile for some heat. I also don't care for leg meat, but I threw 4 legs in along with the breast meat and one cup of chicken broth to kick start the process. Added some lime at the end and voila! Tender chicken with a little kick, served over white rice. Pretty darn tastey.

Pretty bad. Although I probably let it cook too long, I used skinless chicken breast, that's all I had at the moment. The chicken was terribly dry of course howver there was no flavor what so ever, until I mixed everything up with the sour cream and cilantro. Then that's all we could taste. I even shook some cayenne pepper over the top when cooking...bland, bland, bland.

Not impressed at all with this dish. One using chicken legs with skin on, the chicken looked unappealing, and so I took it out and shredded it. It seems greasy, and lacking in flavor.

I made this for dinner last night. Turned out excellent. I used boneless chicken breasts instead. The chicken was too difficult to separate (it was fall apart tender) so i shredded it and left it in when i added the sour cream and cilantro. I also added the juice of one lime at the end (as a previous reviewer suggested) to brighten up the flavor. Worked well. The whole family enjoyed it. I served over roasted potatoes seaoned with cumin and red pepper instead of rice. Leftovers today are even better.

I love the chicken, corn and sour cream combo, but agreed that it lacked something. Everyone has a different flavor they go to, in any given day. For me, I took the chicken out of the slow cooker and shredded it, while the chicken was out, I put in 2 chipotle peppers. It still didn't make it happen. I then put in a small amount of curry, maybe 3/4 of a teaspoon. this made it work for me. I put the shredded chicken in and served over rice. Good luck in your food trials, definitely make again.

This received the coveted "wow" from my wife, a rare accolade. I substituted boneless breasts and thighs in place of the chicken legs (since she's picky about the cuts of chicken she eats) and slow-cooked the dish for about 10 hours. It was really delicious, easy to make, and smelled great cooking all day. I may consider whisking in a little fresh-squeezed lime juice at the end to bring the acidity up a little in the flavor profile, but overall this dish was a knockout.

This recipe was very simple and smelled fantastic! We ate it both with the sour cream and without it and preferred it without it. We did find it missing just a little... something... but I think that was due to our poblanos having absolutely zero heat, a dash of cayenne rounded it out nicely. We skipped eating it with rice and instead opted for hunks of crusty bread for sopping up the juice- simple and satisfying.

This is an easy to make dish that you can freeze without worry (but without the sour cream). I defrosted, added fresh green beans and sour cream and it's great.

This isn't the most exciting dish and the lack of liquid coming from the onions and peppers mean that it's not really like a stew or soup. I'm going to make it again with tomatillos. It's a good way to use poblanos, if you have lots of them on hand. I've frozen it without the sour cream.

This is very bland and the chicken does fall of the bone, but the problem is trying to her all the small chicken parts out of the juices. It's hard with the corn and peppers in there. My husband and I both dis not care for this. Won't make it again.
