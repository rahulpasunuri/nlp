I've made this pie three times and no matter what I do it comes out soupy and undercooked. I won't be wasting any more homemade pie crusts on this crummy recipe.

This pie was AMAZING. The crust was tasty and flaky and the apples were the perfect consistency. It was perfect. I did modify it slightly though: I used granny smith apples, which did not result in soup. My only question that I wasn't able to roll the pate brisee thin enough for the bottom crust to properly meet the top crust with a 1-inch overhang; I therefore wasn't able to squeeze quite all the apples in. And as for baking it, I did end up putting it back in the oven on about 325 for 15 minutes after the recommended baking time (after it had cooled), because the bottom was still undercooked. I put aluminum foil on the top and this seemed to work fine. This is a great, basic, tasty and delicious apple pie!

The taste of this pie is great - but I, too, ended up with apple soup at the bottom of my pie. I used Granny Smiths because that's all I could find. I also used refrigerated pie crusts.

I used half Rome Beauty, half Idared in my pie (both apples are known to hold their shape and are not very juicy), and followed the filling recipe exactly as written. I was shocked to find a pool of apple soup when I cut the pie approximately 1/2 hour after removing it from the oven. I started looking at other recipes to determine what had gone wrong. My Joy of Cooking has almost exactly the same recipe, with just two differences: 1.) increase the flour to 4 tbsp., and 2.) allow the pie to cool completely for at least 3-4 hours before cutting and serving. JofC specifically states that the lengthy cooling period is necessary to allow the filling to set up properly. It suggests that if you want to eat this pie warm, you should *rewarm* it in a 350 degree oven only after it has cooled completely. I wish that I had consulted my Joy before trying this apple pie!

to other bakers: getting "apple soup" is normal. Mcintosh apples release lots of liquid. I do my pie differently - I precook the apple filling on the stove for 15 minutes - drain the liquid - cool - then add it to the crust to bake for another 20 minutes. Less soup. Of course, I like my pie filling soft not crunchy like some people - so this process may not be for you.

Perfect! Quintessential Apple Pie. We went apple picking and then made this recipe 4 times with different apples. All of them were great. We used the prepackaged pie crusts that you roll out into the dish. Easy as Pie and twice as delicious.

Delicious (if not verging a teensy bit on the too sweet side), but I too, got apple soup. Like others, I'm convinced it was the type of apples I used (Pink Lady) because everything else came out fine. The pie was still presentable, I just had to "drain" the slice before serving!

Recently looked through a book containing nothing but apple pie recipes. Sure enough, I learned that Granny Smiths release more water during the cooking process than most any variety of apple. Whereas McIntosh's become softer and absorb more liquid than most any other baking apple. Hence the apple soup. The book suggested increasing flour whenever using Granny Smiths only or vice versa when it came to McIntosh's in other recipes. Just need to play with the proportions a little... I think a mix of the two apples with a little more flour should be just right.

This is my tried and true apple pie recipe. I'm not sure what other reviewers are thinking when they say the filling comes out soupy! I have been making this pie since it was featured in Gourmet in 1993! (I was 14!) However I use my own Pate Brisee recipe.

The spice and sweetness of the apples were well-proportioned. But, I too, like previous reviewers ended up with "apple soup" at the bottom of the pie. I did use granny smiths rather than McIntosh apples.. wondered if a veteran apple pie baker might know whether different varieties of apples release more juice and require more flour?? I'd appreciate any suggestions.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE. I HAVE MADE IT 3 TIMES NOW USING MCINTOSH APPLES AND PRE MADE CRUST AND EVERYONE RAVES ABOUT IT. I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM LIKE OTHERS WHO HAVE MADE THIS RECIPE. MY PIE COMES OUT PERFECT EVERY TIME.

I've been making this pie since it was originally published, and love it! I typically use Granny Smith apples, and take the easy way out with pre-made crusts.

I don't understand what happened with my recipe. The pie had way too much liquid at the bottom. I let it cool three hours before slicing. Was that not enough time? I used Jonagold apples (supposed to be good in an apple pie). I did not bake it for 20 minutes longer as suggested. The crust was nice and golden (used different crust recipe as suggested too) and the apples were cooked just fine. Any suggestions as to what happened? The taste was good, but my family joked that it was good "Apple soup"!

I followed the recipe, chilled the crust but it was a real problem to roll it out--I threw it away & started w/a new recipe. Apple filling was ok but not outstanding. Epicurious is great, not every recipe--or baker--is perfect...this one is not for me!

crusts must be light and crispy plus apples must be firm soft

I volunteered to make this recipe (which I found by doing a search online for basic apple pie) when visiting my Mother and her side of the family this past Thanksgiving. Praying it would come out good, I presented it to the family. I was all smiles when absolutely everyone raved about how delicious it was. I didn't print a copy of it so I could make it again. That is why I am here now. If this pie is such a hit I will surely be making it many more times. Very simple with basic ingredients. It was one of the first pies to be finished.

Note to Brenda Daily (if you happen to look back through these reviews): If you had looked through the reviews before making this pie, you would have seen that, a) many people recommended doubling the crust, which is consistant with most double-crust recipes I've seen, and, b) most people who raved about the recipe listed the varieties of apples they used, which were NOT MacIntosh. Macs are known for turning to mush and I have never before seen them recommended in a pie recipe. And thicker crusts would have held together better when rolling. I strongly suggest you read through reviews before making recipes; that's one of the great things about this site. Recipes printed in books and magazines are not always thoroughly tested, so it makes sense to take advantage of all the home testers that are willing to take the time and submit their feedback online.

This is the tastiest and easiest apple pie recipe I've have made. I used McCoun apples which I love as an eating apple, so it gave my pie a sweet & tart flavor. They stay firm too. I used a store bought pie crust to make my life easier, but the filling is very delicious. When you brush the top with milk and spinkle sugar, the crust comes out wonderful. Great idea. I love this recipe.

This pie will become a Thanksgiving traditon, although my daughter uses a family recipe for the crust. We presented this pie with a lattice top. The consistancy of the apples was superb. We used Granny Smith which gave the pie a crisp tartness that blended deliciously with the amount of spice. It was great with coffee the next morning, too.

This was the best apple pie I have ever had. I usually cover mine with vanilla ice cream, but this one didn't need a thing. My husband is an apple pie connoisseur and he agrees. I used Granny Smith apple for this one.

I don't know what I did wrong but my pie didn't turn out very well. I ended up with way too many apples in the pie (although I followed the amounts in the recipe exactly) and the apples were not cooked all the way through. Perhaps I used the wrong type of apples - can anyone recommend good types of apples to use?

Rating: 4
First pie I ever made. Would definitely recommend it. I didn't read the reviews before making it and ended up short on the dough for the top crust. Definitely needs to be corrected with double the crust ingredients. I just ended up adding flour, butter, etcc for the dough until I had enough and it turned out great!

This was my first apple pie--my poor husband has been asking me to bake one for 18 years, but since I am not an apple pie fan, and nor are my 3 kids, I never got around to it. It was absolutely delicious. The one change I made was to quadruple (!) the lemon juice to 4 Tb. To us, it tasted fantastic. Thanks to all the other reviewers I doubled the crust recipe and baked it 20 minutes longer; it would have been a disaster if I hadn't listened to you guys! I had never made crust before so I didn't find the rolling out part particularly easy; I had added 6 Tb. of the water but it was probably still a bit too dry to handle perfectly. After baking though, the crust was awesome. I used 5 granny smith and 3 fujis (macintosh are mealy, soft and flavorless this time of year)and the pie was fantastic. The cinammon and nutmeg tasted great to us and seemed to be just the right amount. Thanks epicurious!

I loved the ease of this pie! My 10 and 4 year olds helped make it and were so proud of how pretty it came out and of how delicious it tasted! I'm an apple pie freak and I loved this one!!

We made two apple pies for our Canadian Thanksgiving yesterday-- we used half McIntosh apples, half Granny Smith, added raspberries to one pie (yum) and omited the nutmeg in both (ugh). My husband also used the crust recipe from the Lattice Top Strawberry Rhubarb pie (our all-time favorite pastry recipe) since so many complained about the one featured here. Both pies were a smash hit. A very traditional, comforting flavor.

This apple pie is the best! I've made it with a variety of apples over the years and all of the pies have received rave reviews. It may not be the fanciest pie recipe, but it is a great one. I've made several copies of the recipe so I will (hopefully) never lose it!

Definitely double the crust recipe. Overall great flavor. I made it with 2 lbs. of apples and 1 lb. of bartlett pears instead. There was WAY too much liquid at the bottom of the pie -- even after it was fully cooled. I wonder if the pears let out all of that liquid?

Great recipe. I love picking my own apples in Wisconsin (this year I used Jonathans). And instead of the crust listed, I used the recipe for Basic Flaky Pie Crust (http://food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=101858) Baking apple pie in the Autumn! Can life get any better?

This was an excellent apple pie recipe, however it did help to read the reviews first as I did double the crust and cook the pie about 20 minutes longer.

The real deal, I used Crispin-Courtland that I picked from Peddicombe Farms, Niagra. Doubled the recipe twice for two pies, it helps to mash the butter & shortening together then with the flour with a lg steel spoon. Let the apples sweat a bit and definately use the sauce!!

Based on the reviews, I used another pie crust recipe. Filling was great classic apple pie. Only problem was that it required more time cooking than the recipe indicated...mine should have cooked another 20 minutes.

The apple pie had a great flavor, but mine was a bit dry, and the apples didn't get done all the way. I followed the recipe to the letter, but would like a pie with a filling that when you cut the pie the filling runs somewhat and the apples are soft. I doubled the pate brisee recipe which worked out fine.

This pie really tasted great. A very traditional apple pie flavor. I used the increased portions that the other cooks suggested. The only problem I had was making the dough into a round, a technique I'm unfamiliar with. Any help would be appreciated. Otherwise a great recipe.

I substituted Granny Smith apples for the McIntosh, and ended up with a great pie--sweet, but also wonderfully tart and intensely flavored. Like the other reviewers, I had problems with the pate brisee recipe---it was NOT enough and I didn't have enough to fully cover the pie. What gives??

Great apple pie!! If you lack lemon, which was my case at the time, try same amount o.j. with as much grated ginger as you like. Also substituted mac's for granny's and fuji. yes, and the pate brisee amount was not enough! thank you other cooks for sharing your amounts.

I had to change the pate brisee a bit. It was not enough pastry for my dish. This is how my pate is made.I change the flour to 2 1/4 c....butter to 1 stick(8T.) shortening to 4T. and water to 5T. I had some pastry left over and made a wonderful cinnamon roll just like my mother used to make.The crust was so buttery and tender, the family loved it. Thanks Epicurious we love you!!!!

While this pie filling is delicious, the accompanying pate brisee (dough) recipe makes an amount of dough insufficient for a 9" pie. It's very frustrating to try to roll dough out enough to fill the pan and cover the pie when there simply is not enough of it to do so. Other comparable dough recipes I have seen call for similar ingredients but an additional 3/4 cup of flour. Next time I try this recipe I'll use 2 cups of flour rather than the 1-1/4 called for.

This was the best apple pie I've ever had! It is so simple yet delicious. My husband, who is a lifelong apple pie critic, loved it too. If it passes his test, its a keeper!
