Who wouldn't like beets, avocado and fennel? Unfortunately, together they just didn't work. The avocado was completely lost in the the dominant flavors of the fennel and beets. And the 4 to 1 ratio of oil to acid in the dressing was much too heavy. The whole thing never came together.

Oops, forgot to say I would definitely make again!

Actually crave this salad. Everyone that has tried it has absolutely loved it. Also, saves well for a day or two.

Make this recipe when beets are in season and use a variety of colors....yellow, red, orange. Not only is this a delicious salad, it makes a beautiful presentation.I have made this for my friends who swear they dont like beets and they loved it.

This was really good, the avocado was a nice contrast to the crunchiness of the beets and the fennel was very refreshing. I want to make it again and again.
