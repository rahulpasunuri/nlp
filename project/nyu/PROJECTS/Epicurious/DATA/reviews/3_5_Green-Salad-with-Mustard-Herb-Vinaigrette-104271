I loved this vinaigrette dressing. I think that you need to be a fan of vinaigrette dressings to like this one. I made it for my family and they were begging me to make more for a pre-mixed salad the next night! Even my brother-in-law loved it and he does not like oil type dressings. I thought that it was delicious, and easy. The chicken broth could definitely not be detected in the finished product. I made more that same night to keep in the fridge with my store bought salad dressings!

Wasn't impressed. Won't make it again, but it was edible

This salad wasnt worth one fork. It was very easy to make but the end result was terrible. The flavors were just plain gross.

This was a very good and easy vinaigrette. I've never used chickin broth in a vinaigrette, but it was creamy and fresh tasting. Doesn't taste like chicken at all. will definately make again!
