- Reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. - Add 1/4 grated carrots (optional). My first batch (following recipe as is) resulted in bread that was too sweet and dense. Second batch (with changes) resulted in perfectly balanced sweetness to spice, and moist yet fluffy texture.

i've used epicurious for years and never felt the need to leave a comment till now. fortunately i read the comments before attempting this recipe; the proportions definitely seem off as i've never made a bread with more sugar than flour. i adjusted as follows: doubled the flour, subtracted 1/2c sugar, added about an extra cup of zucchini (to use it all up), and what i guess was about 1/4c milk. i did not change the oil. when i doubled the flour as others have suggested, i wound up with something like cookie dough, not quick bread batter, hence the milk--i poured until i liked the consistency. the batter tasted great (yes i licked the spoon!) and the bread rose perfectly, but when i finally tried it, it was BLAND. acceptably sweet and vaguely spiced, but bland. it did NOT taste like zucchini bread to me--perhaps more of a spice bread. it was very moist but not oily and the texture was nice. for anyone who wants to try this: were i to make this again, i might use 3 cups of flour instead of 4, and then add more by the 1/4-1/2 cup as necessary to get the right consistency. with that much less flour, i'd probably cut the sugar back to 1 3/4 (and again, add more to taste). finally, i'd probably add yet another cup of zucchini, without wringing it out. since it rose fine even with the 2 extra cups of flour, i don't think the baking powder amounts would need to be changed, nor the spices, as they were clearly present in the batch i made. all in all, it wasn't bad, but since it just didn't have that zucchini bread flavor, i won't be making this recipe again.

I made this bread according to the recipe exactly and it actually turned out really good. I had quite a few others taste it and I got their opinions and they all loved it, but I do agree with the others here. The next time I make it I will use less oil and I will up the flower. The flavor for me was just fine but it was a little too dense and oily.

Yes, half the oil...double the flour. I made it as muffins. 27 minutes at the same temp was perfect for regular sized muffins. And if you have a sweet tooth like me, lemon supreme frosting is exceptional with the muffins!!

I read the reviews and doubled the flour, halved the oil.....I also added chopped dates. This was perefect and I will make it again, The spice is perfect, sounded like a lot, but just a hint really.

Okay. This recipe is definitely *off* a little, but does have a really nice flavor. I think I averted disaster because a.) I used closer to 3 C. of zucchini and didn't squeeze out any of the excess moisture, b.) I used raw sugar (which is less sweet than processed white sugar) and c.) I let it sit out overnight before trying it. I'm also at high altitude, but I'm not sure if that makes any real difference. The recipe could definitely use more flour and way less sugar and oil. I will try some of the modifications posted here when I make it the next time.

Rating: 3
Luckily I reduced the oil myself to 1 and 1/4 and I always use about half the sugar and half whole wheat flour. It was very good, but still way too oily. I would make it again because the lemon zest was great in it but I would reduce the oil even further to maybe 1 cup or even less.

After taking the time to read many reviews and modifying, I think these came out perfect. I'd say in the top 5 muffins I ever made. How I modified: I made them into muffins for starters, Used 3 cups flour, 1 3/4 cups sugar, 3/4 cup canola oil, 2 eggs, added 1 teaspoon nutmeg with the other spices, added 1 carrot shredded, and after toasting my walnuts I tossed then in cocoa powder. Seriously light and fluffy. LOVED THEM and so did my lil' boy.

Something's wrong with the portions in this recipe. I followed it exactly as written. Bread stuck to the bottom of the pan; center of bread fell like a souffle; and it tasted too oily and too sweet. I'm disappointed -- I spent an hour on prep, including toasting the walnuts. Epicurious editors -- see other similar reviews. I too recommend that you remove this recipe from your site.

Mine turned out fabulous after I read the other reviews and made the following adjustments: " Halve the sugar and oil (I used grapeseed oil instead of veggie oil); " added a little nutmeg " added a cup of shredded carrots " tossed the toasted walnuts with a little cocoa powder. Very delicious! (I agree w/ the other reviewer that a cream cheese frosting would make this a great dessert!)

I love this recipe, but I'veadapted it over the last year to suit my tastes: Cut the oil in half. Yes, half! Cut the sugar in half! Cut the cinnamon in half Add 1/2 tsp nutmeg Change 1 cup walnuts to 3/4 C Walnuts plus 1/2 C Pepitas viola!

Tried it their way first, despite my own concerns about the high amounts of oil and sugar. Results were similar to others' here--too sugary and too oily, resulting in an overly moist and very dense loaf. I think by incorporating some of the suggestions to halve the sugar and oil and maybe up some of the other ingredients, this will be a great bread. I like the whole wheat flour idea, and the tips on using fresh baking powder and wringing out the zucchini first.

My husband loved this bread; he said it is the best bread I've ever made. I usually make yeast breads, so he might have been hankering for something sweet. My loafs came out of the oven with the centers indented instead of puffed, though. This was less noticeable after cooling.

This did require some adjustments. Not enough to merit how nasty some people were in their reviews. Personal responsibility seemed to be absent, and the idea of personal preferences forgotten. Suggestions: Read reviews first; squeeze the moisture out of the zucchini; halve the sugar/oil amounts; toss walnuts with small amount of dry ingredient mixture and a little cocoa; double the baking powder; add an extra egg; use kosher salt. Common sense stuff, for all you abdicators of personal responsibility. Jeez...sweeten up!

Rating: 3
I rated it 3 forks based on the alterations I made to the recipe-- could almost rate as 4 forks. I had actually made the alterations prior to reading all of the reviews and made muffins out of the recipe...everyone that ate them raved how delicious they were. I didn't have any of the issues mentioned in the other reviews and the texture was perfect. I think perhaps the fact that I added more zuchini than was called for and grated carrot as well balanced out the problem others seemed to have with the consistency. Here are the changes I made: 1.Used whole wheat flour exclusively. 2.Cut sugar to 2 cups and could have even reduced further, but the 2 cups definately gave it a dessert quality...a little cream cheese frosting would have topped it perfectly. 3.Used 1 cup of coconut oil vs. the type and quantity of oil called for. 4.Used approximately 4 cups of grated zuchini...could even use more. 5.Added approximately 1.5 cups grated carrot as well. 6.Added approximately 1 cup of raisins.

Forgot to add in my previous post - if you're looking for a bread / cake recipe to use up zucchini, try the Chocolate Zucchini Cake recipe on this site. I reduce the sugar a bit in that recipe too and bake it in loaf pans. MUCH better than this garbage!

UGH. What a hideous recipe. I would rate this no forks if possible. Wish I had scrolled down and read some of the reviews before making this mess, and wish I had followed my instincts that this recipe contained too much oil and sugar. The bread comes out a sticky, SUPER sweet, oily mess. I made one loaf and some muffins with the extra batter. Even the muffins took around 40 min to cook! To salvage this, one would have to completely change the recipe - so why not just make a different one? I agree with other reviewers - Epicurious, remove this garbage recipe so others don't waste their time on it!!

NYDepot is correct. This is amazing. It's a coffee cake, not a bread. But after reading all of the negative reviews that assert to follow NYDepot's direction, I think that the problem is that many folks don't understand that baking powder must be fresh! It has a mere 6 month shelf life. Lord knows that the baking powder in many pantries is a great deal older than that. So do yourself a favor and pick up a fresh tin before you attempt this recipe. Then follow NYDepot's instructions, and I am pretty sure that you will enjoy this immensely.

Please take this recipe off the site. I unfortunately made it before I read the reviews, otherwise I would not have made it. Not only did I reduce the oil to a half cup (instead of a cup and a half), I also reduced the sugar to 2 cups, just as previous reviewers recommended. It still wasn't right. There is way too much liquid in the recipe and the cake came out gooey and raw. When a recipe gets this many bad reviews, please just replace it with another. This cannot be the only zucchini bread recipe out there.

Are you kidding me?!? Epicurians- you're on notice. This recipe is a nightmare! I actually took a picture of my end result and wish I could post it along with this review. I followed this recipe to a T- I even mixed the living daylights out of it, as many reviewers have recommended. After meticulously grating the lemonpeel and toasting the walnuts and waiting over an hour for the bread to bake, I pulled out two loaves of gooey, uneven loaves that had completely flattened to pancakes. I was so disappointed. The chunks that I could redeem from the unleaved mess were delicious. But what good does that serve a careful cook who was expecting two loaves of bread? Unacceptable for a site as reputable as Epicurious. I move that this recipe be extricated from the site. Many reviewers give hints such as "mix it thoroughly" or "cut the oil in half." I don't see how simple steps like this can rescue this trainwreck!

For the record - I totally butchered this recipe; initially on purpose and eventually by accident. Reduced sugar to 2 cups but it was still way too sweet. I used 1 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce...next time I'd switch the proportions and do 1/2 cup of oil and 1 cup applesauce. Did 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup white. Added spoonful of flax seed and totally forgot the eggs! whoops. Baked at 375 for 50 minutes - still really good with afternoon coffee.

my bread was a tasty disaster. don't know if its the altitude ( a live at 6,500 ft) or what. but i think the recipe has too much sugar and too much oil. my batter bubbled over and spilled out of the pan, then the middles sunk and the loaves were dense and wet. definitely needs adjusting

Yes! Fabulous! I make it every week or 2, with 2 cups of sugar, 1 cup of oil, and adding the juice of the lemon as well as the peel. I grated the last of the summer zucchinis & froze them, for easy winter use; came out fine! I find the higher proportion of white flour I use, the better it comes out of the pan, but like to use at least 1/2 whole wheat.

This recipe is incredible. I was actually looking for a chocolate zucchini bread and came across this. In an effort to make the bread a little bit for wintery, holiday season like, I added 1/2 cup of re-hydrated cranberries, 1tsp of cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp of freshly ground cloves. The result was an incredible bread. Both loafs disappeared within hours.

Faced with a surplus of zucchini, I turned to epicurious once again and found this recipe. I read every single review and decided, based on nydepot's review, not to make any changes to the recipe. I used my stand mixer to whisk the wet ingredients to insure that they were well blended and then stirred the dry ingredients until they too were well blended. The house smelled delicious as the 'cakes' cooked and I was eager to try them. The loaves that came out of the oven were not pretty - the middle of each had completely sunk. When I removed them from the pans, large chunks remained in the pans despite the butter and flour with which I prepared them. The tops of the loaves were pretty yummy and crunchy which I attribute to the quantity of sugar in the recipe but the bottoms were just okay. My daughter did, through the course of the evening, eat the top of one loaf but I ended up throwing out the rest of the bread. Not sure what I did wrong, but obviously something!

Great moist bread! I used just under 1 cup of melted butter instead of vegetable oil (because I didn't have any). Used 1 2/3 cups of suger as suggested by others. Next time I will use even less sugar, a little more zucchini, walnuts and lemon zest. My husband loved it!

It's a good thing I read a bunch of the reviews for this bread -- I would not have made it if I hadn't read nydepot's review. This is a GREAT bread and I'll repeat what nydepot said -- you must beat the ingredients well, especially the wet ingredients. And it's not a tea bread for toasting and buttering but a rich coffeecake type bread. Everyone at my work place loved it and they are my best critics.

My boyfriend has wonderful childhood memories of zucchini bread so I decided to try my hand at some of my own. He ate every crumb! My office loved it too. It is definitely more of a cake than a bread, so I agree with NYdepot's review. I concur that a lot of mixing of the wet ingredients is necessary. I also added 0.5 tsp cloves, 1 tsp ginger, 1 tsp nutmeg. I cut the sugar to 2 cups and it was plenty sweet.

A friend made this bread and used whole wheat flour and used part brown and part white sugar. It was delicious but when I saw the recipe, I thought it had too much oil and too much sugar. I used 1 1/2 cups ww flour and 1/2 cup white, put in 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white, 1 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. It was every bit as good as my friend's. The second time I made it, I only made 1/2 a recipe, using all ww flour and cutting back more on the oil. I decided when I make it again (the whole recipe), I will use 3/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce. The lemon zest is what makes this bread so good - that added flavor is delicious.

I think that this is a good base recipe but I agree with other posts that you must use less oil! I used agave syrup instead of the sugar and used about 1 1/3 cups of agave syrup. I also used all whole wheat flour. This recipe is so moist that you really don't notice that it is whole wheat. I also used olive oil.

This was great as I made it today - very moist, very tasty, not horribly bad for you - but I have some suggestions for how I would make it better: What I did today: 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup allpurpose flour; nutmeg along with cinnamon and allspice; 1 1/2 cup sugar; 3/4 cup canola oil, 3/4 cup apple sauce; otherwise as directed. Mixed very well, as described in other reviews suggested. What I would do: 2 cups whole wheat flour; 3/4 cup sugar, 1/4 cup honey, 1 tbsp molasses; 1/2 oil, 1 cup apple sauce; otherwise as I did it today.

Unfortunately, I failed to read the reviews before making this and made the recipe as printed. I consequently ended up feeding the entire oily sickeningly sweet mess to the trash can. I should have trusted my instincts - 2 and 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 and 1/2 cups of oil for a relatively small recipe cannot morph into something good! I gave this 1 fork because that is as low as the ratings go, but really it's a zero - definitely not okay!

Its always interesting that you have a group of people that obviously know how to cook. You give then the same instructions, the same ingredients and they consistently come out with completely different results. Go figure. I gave this four forks. We found ourselves in Nantucket with a garden left by the owners of the house we stay at each summer and many very large Zucchinis. This seemed like an interesting recipe so I tried it. Were now at the end of week two of vacation and the fourth Zucchini Bread. Nydepots suggestions are excellent. I reduced the sugar by about a half because I just cant see ever using as much sugar as the recipe suggested in anything. Personal preference. I also cut the oil by about a third. It has come out perfect every time. I suggest that you might want to add some golden raisins which were an excellent addition.

I am giving this recipe 3 forks because half of my batch came out well, and if you read the review written by nydepot, it makes perfect sense. I think that if I had followed their directions, I would have had a satisfactory end product. I am once again REALLY kicking myself for not reading the reviews prior to making the recipe. I made a loaf what was edible and muffins that I threw away. I agree that even the loaf was pretty greasy, but it was my boyfriend's favorite (I've made a lot of zucchini bread lately). I think that perhaps I'll make it again and follow nydepot's suggestions. They were right that your first instinct is to use the muffin method and barely combine the ingredients. Don't do it! Listen to them! I also agree with the other reviewers who said that the recipe is well-spiced. I'd say that it's worth a try, and you can cut the oil by a bit if you like, or you could substitute apple sauce for some of it.

I wanted to add, I also left out the lemon zest. I substituted 1 cup of agave for all of the sugars. The batter is rather thin and cooks up very nicely. I mixed the agave in w/ the wet ingreds, mixed the wet ingred INTO the dry, even tho recipe calls to do the other way. No problem. Nothing you have to do special to make this turn out great. It is a really really simple recipe. :-)

i looked up this recipe and compared it with the one my mother has used for years. the amount of everything is close except for the sugar and oil, which are both a half cup more than my mother's. also, didn't care for the allspice, a little more cinnamon or ginger is easily better. keep the oil though- this bread tastes best when you spread butter over the warm slices, rather than bake it in.

This bread is, frankly, quite awesome. I made two leaves recently, and brought them to two separate events, giving about 20 people a chance to try the bread. Every single soul - every one - loved it. However, there seems to be a disagreement about this recipe in these reviews. I think it stems from a two key things: 1) Some folks prefer vegetable-based quickbreads (zucchini, banana, etc.) as toasting breads, suitable for buttering. This is not one of those breads. Rather, this bread falls into the coffee cake quickbread subgenre - very moist, rich and somewhat sweet. Its made for drinking with coffee as a breakfast (or as a dessert), and is not really made for toasting and buttering. 2) Experienced bakers tend to make such quickbreads using a muffin approach, being careful not to overmix even the slightest bit. Well, this is more of a cake than a quickbread, and it takes some serious mixing. In particular, one must pay attention to mixing of the sugar and wet ingredients. If this is not done thoroughly - until the whisking eases up a bit - then you will have a grainy mess on your hands. Be patient, and get your elbow grease in good order. Whisk the sugar and wet ingredients very thoroughly, until the mixing becomes easier and the sugar fairly dissolves. In other words, think cake - not quickbread - and you will nail this recipe. If you understand point 1 (that this is more of a coffee cake than a toasting bread), and heed the advice in 2 (coffee cake, not quickbread), you will not need to substitute butter, or reduce the fat, unless you want something less sumptuous and, ultimately, much less delicious. This is an absolutely superb bread - and the recipe clearly has no typos. But the instructions could probably be a little more explicit to aid the less experienced baker.

So without reading the other reviews i was a bit skeptical and made some changes to the recipe. I used 1 cup of butter melted and cooled instead of the oil. I used 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar. and left the lemon zest and walnuts out. Juries still out on these changes but i liked it this way. It is not dense like other "quick breads" but instead lite and sweet like a cake with a backbone.

I would use this recipe as the base for zucchini bread but would decrease the sugar and oil to make actual zucchini bread, not cake that falls apart.

I can't believe I forgot to read the reviews before I made this. I should have been put off by the constant mentions of OILY taste... I would recomend switching to a mix of butter and applesauce and then throwing the whole thing out. It's terrible. Even with lots of freshly ground spices, it tastes flat, and if you do feel the need to bake it, it WILL stick to your pans, even if they are non-stick and you grease them. I really wanted the dense, heady zucchini bread (which is really a cake) that my grandmother always made, but I didn't have a recipe. This is NOT it.

After reading the collection of reviews, it was clear that this recipe needed a little altering. I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose, added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup brown, 3/4 cup white and 1/4 cup of honey, reduced the oil to 1 cup of canola oil and added a 1/2 cup of raisins. I cooked the loaves at 325 F on convection bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes. The end result was two beautiful moist loaves full of flavour and spice. No sticking to the pans and not oily at all. Was a real hit with my partner, I will definitiely make again.

Bummer! I always read the reviews before I cook anything from this site, but for some reason I forgot this time. As everyone stated, the bread (more cake like than bread) came out way too oily. I decreased the sugar to about 2 cups and switched the allspice to half nutmeg, half cloves and the flavor is ok, but it just doesn't hold together. I also baked it in a bundt pan, but like the reviews said, it stuck to the bottom. I am surprised, as most receipes on the site are usually pretty good. Actually, the reviews make all the difference. Next time I won't forget to read them!

The problem with the recipe as written is that there's a typo. When you compare this to the Silver Palate recipe, it's clear that too much sugar has been put in. Change sugar amount to 1 1/2 cups and it works out quite nicely.

I would never use this recipe again. It was terrible The bread came out granular. Maybe too much sugar.I think brown sugar and white sugar together would be better. I would also use butter flavored crisco or real butter instead of oil. Adding 1/4 c. plus 1 Tbsp. would make a better loaf as well.

Too oily and not at all bread-like. I'll stick w/ my mother's version next time.

I hate to be rude to Ms. Henderson, but this was just awful. I had to substitute some brown sugar for some of the white because I ran out, but really that shouldn't make such a difference in the final product. What can I say? It was greasy, oily, dense and it stuck to the pan. If you do plan on trying it out anyway, be sure to grease and flour the pans really well.

It's true you have to use a first rate oil like corn or peanut oil, but this is the classic zucchini bread, moist and very popular. I didn't change a thing.

Too oily, but the spices were ok.

i will make this again, only not using THIS recipe!! too many eggs (3)give it a spongy-cupcake like feel,instead of the dense-poundcake like feel i was looking for.also,instead of so much vegetable oil,the recipe should of called for real butter.the oil made it too oily and not as rich tasting. find another recipe for zucchini bread!

I wouldn't suggest using bread flour when using baking power as a leavener. Bread flour is meant for yeast doughs.

I have never had zucchini bread. It was suggested by my sister-in-law that I make it. I went to serch on this site to find the recipe. I made some changes becouse of the reviews. instead of 2 c. of flour I used 1 1/2 c. of whole wheat and 1 c. of bread flour. 1/2 c. of oil, vanilla sugar as well as the vanilla, 1 tsp. of lemon oil but next time will put two. and I am not crazy about walnuts so I used pecans. I also added 1 cup of buttermilk becouse of the wheat flour tends to suck a lot of moisture. What a wounderful recipe. Healthy two.

I believe I followed the recipe to the letter. But ONE AND ONE HALF CUPS of oil. The batter was VERY gooey, I should have known something was up then. The final result was not bread-like nor cake-like. Are you SURE the recipe is correct?

This bread was very disappointing. I decreased the amount of oil to half of what the recipe called for and it still came out horribly greasy & soggy. Definitely NOT something I'd make again.

I read the reviews and decided to slightly alter the basic receipe. I cut back on the oil by half a cup, added an additional half-cup of zucchini, and also added an extra half cup of flour... it came out WONDERFULLY!!!... I only gave it three forks because I had to alter the receipe... other than that it'd be a four....

I read a number of the reviews before making this so I cut the oil down to just under a cup and increased the amount of zucchini by about 1/2 cup to add more moisture. I used 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of splenda. I also lined the bottom of the pan with waxed paper. The finished loaves have a nice flavor and are plenty sweet but the texture is still somewhat doughy and dense. I like the addition of the allspice and lemon, but this seems like an awful lot of adjusting to do just to make a pretty average batch of zucchini bread. I found another recipe in Epicurious for sweet potato zucchini bread and made that also. I followed the recipe exactly and it produced a wonderful loaf of bread! Next time I might take a hint from this recipe and add some allspice and lemon zest to the sweet potato recipe and use pecans instead of walnuts.

This is wonderful!!! My 5yr old had a play date so we made this from the zucchin from our garden. Every one that has tasted it asks for the recipe. We have a convection oven. Perhaps the recipe was intended for that. Everything turned out delicious.

Easy and delicious. I like the flavor combination although I had no lemon so I left that out.

Very oily. The flavor was good, but the texture was too dense - almost soggy. Two loaves in the compost pile!

I thought this had awesome flavor!!! Yes, I too was a bit disappointed because it stuck to the bottom of the pan, I'll try the wax paper tip next time. This is an easy, very tasty recipe!

This was actually pretty good, but I really changed the recipe. I used only 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup splenda to sweeten, and 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup water instead of the oil. I also used whole-wheat pastry flour instead of white flour, and 1/2 cup pine nuts instead of the larger amount of walnuts. I added a little extra baking powder. I made this into muffins, and baked at 400 degrees for around 18 minutes.

Way too oily. I had the feeling when I was making it, but went ahead and dumped in the listed amount anyway. I used whole wheat flour, and less sugar than the recipe listed.

I wish I had read the reviews before making this twice tonight. The first two loaves caved in in the middle but I figured it was because one of my children "peeked" in the oven so I made it again. Same problem. The bread tastes good - chewy, crunchy crust, moist bread, but the presentation is awful. I don't understand how recipes like this make it into Bon Appetit. I've wasted an evening making bread for a weekend outing to the lake with friends.

To the folks who thought it was too oily, why not sub unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 of the oil? I'll try it & report back on my results. happy eating!

Great traditional zucchini bread. I lined the bottom of the pan with waxpaper to avoid sticking. Works everytime.

This is a great recipe except for the exceptionally high level of sugar. Zucchini bread just doesn't need it. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and liked the results much better. For those of you that like sweeter breads, try 1 1/2 cups. I also made the bread "meatier" by using 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 regular flour

Delicious, however "too busy to cook"? I don't think so. Sweeter than a bread, more cake-like. Unlike other reviewers, mine didn'stick, and made it exactaly as the recipe stated.

Fabulous! I used 11/4 cups of oil instrad of 11/2 cups. Still stuck slightly, but the flavor was worth it! Wish I could solve the sticking problem.

This recipe seemed to be way too oily. It was very dense and not at all bread-like. Big disappointment and a waste of ingredients.

I substituted 1 cup of splenda for 1 cup of the sugar, used 3 cups of zucchini, and cut the oil to one cup. Baked at 300 in stoneware loaf pans (well buttered & floured)for 1 hr 10 min. They came out of the pans perfectly with just a little too much butter and flour on the bottom.

My bread stuck to the bottom as well. I used 2 different pans, (glass and metal) hoping one would be better than the other. They were both buttered and floured well. Maybe it is too moist? I cut back on the oil to 1 1/4 cup. Flavor was very good, I only wish it didn't stick.

I made this recipe for a Father's Day brunch. It's very moist and has a sweet, crunchy crust. My one complaint is that the bottom of the loaves stuck to both pans so they didn't look great but they tasted great. I would definitely butter and flour the pans more next time.

I really liked this, but it was a bit too oily for me. I will try this again with less oil.

This was a hit with the family. I added quite a bit more grated lemon peel and that gave it a little extra zest. This is a keeper for our family.

The loaf came out rather flat. The taste was OK - I did omit some of the sugar which was better. It was also a bit oily. I wouldn't make this one again.
