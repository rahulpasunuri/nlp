Cooking for one? It's just little ol' me in my apartment and I didn't feel the need to make the entire recipe. Here's how I converted it: I first laid 8 slices from one apple skin side down in a small (4"x6") enameled loaf pan. Then, I put about 2 T. each of dried cherries, almonds, and pecans on top of the slices. On top of that, I laid down another 8 slices from a second apple, skin side up. The butter went on those skins, before pouring a few tablespoons each apple cider and maple syrup. The apples baked at 400'for about 20 min. in my little DeLonghi convection oven. With low fat vanilla ice cream...perfect!

YUM! These were like inside-out caramel apples. I 1/3 the recipe (made a big hole in each apple and 1/2 the stuffing recipe) but kept the sauce amount the same. If you are making this with 6 apples, i would suggest doubling the sauce - it's so good! tastes like maple-caramel.

very good! I baked it about 10 min. longer than recommended but I think I had extra big apples - I used cortlands, which were perfect. Raisins subbed in for the figs and cherries as they wern't in the pantry, and a bit of heavy whipping cream finished it off! yum!
