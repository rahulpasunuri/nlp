I made these at Thanksgiving for my (0 year old Grandparents. My Grandmother could not stop eating them and never liked Brussel Sprouts! As farmers they always grew them and she made them for my grandfather but never liked them until she had these. She could not get over it. Now it is a family recipe made every Thanksgiving. I highly recommend. We always follow the recipe exactly.

Wonderful. Turned out very well and a nice change from the roasted brussels sprouts I usually do. The apple cider vinegar is a great addition!

Easy and delicious. Comes together very quickly once the sprouts are shredded. I made the shallots a day ahead (refrigerated) and added them with the butter and water to warm them up for serving. Would be great with some toasted nuts to add crunch (walnuts, pine nuts, or pecans).

So good. Requested by my family for any "food" get-together we have. Even if you think you don't like brussel sprouts, you should try this amazing dish.

I wanted to update my review. We had the brussels sprouts leftovers the next day for lunch. They didn't look as pretty as they had started to turn brown/gray but the taste was wonderful. It's as if the shallots had sweetened them and glazed them. It was really very lovely. I now wonder if I needed to let them set a little prior to serving or to cook them a little longer once I incorporated the shallots so they could become more glazed. I will definitely try the recipe again and experiment a little. Changing my review to 4 forks.

Rating: 3
I made this tonight. I caramelized the shallots and sliced the brussels sprouts earlier in the day and cooked it as the meat rested for dinner. I only quartered the brussels sprouts instead of cutting in slices. I had to cook them a little longer than the 6 minutes to get them crisp/tender. I also added the cup of water and cooked it away but then forgot to add the butter. It was good. I don't think anybody was blown away but everyone ate it. The caramelized shallots were fantastic. I will make them again by themselves.

Rating: 4
This is a go-to recipe in our house for daily or holiday meals! I have never made this for company and not been asked for the recipe. I begin by sautéing diced proscuitto ends in a little olive oil and setting aside. I then caramelize the shallots and set aside on top of the proscuitto. I finish the rest of the recipe as written, adding the shallots and proscuitto at the end, and serve as soon as I can. This is a delightful addition to poultry, beef or lamb and as soon as the leaves begin to change I find myself craving it en masse.

My family does not like brussel sprouts...but they love this dish!!! Its a quick one to pull together - especially if you do the chopping earlier in the day and put it in a container/bag until you're ready to begin cooking. Definitely a fall favorite!

Fantastic recipe! Wegman's now sells shredded brussels sprouts so now I can make on a weeknight. I cut back on the sugar and butter, use vegetable or chicken broth instead of the water for some depth of flavor, and add chopped craisins . . . adds nice color and a pop of sweet/tart. Sometimes I add crumbled bacon right before serving. This is the first vegetable dish to go at family gatherings.

I have made this recipe dozens of times now, exactly as written, although occasionally I put in a few more shallots. I always get asked for the recipe. It is really delicious, even if you don't like Brussel Sprouts, which I didn't think I did until I had this. If you don't have a food processor this is reason enough to buy one. Slicing all those little rolly sprouts and the shallots is almost enough to make you not want to make it again. ALMOST!

do NOT make this in advance - all the nice color goes away and it goes icky brown. still delish, but not nice to look at. also, next time I'll use white balsamic vinegar - I sued a high quality dark syrup, but that contributed to the unappealing color. my pancetta seemed off so I didn't add it. it was tart enough with the sprouts and vinegar. very balanced. delish.

This recipe was amazing. I only used one tablespoon of sugar, it was the perfect amount. Any more would have been way too much. I had trouble setting the shallot mixture aside as the sugar stuck together a bit. Didn't use any oil as the butter was enough. I recommend heating it up before combining with the sprouts. I will definitely be making this again!!!!

Well, I always cut down the fat content. Probably used about half of what was called for. I also couldn't get shallots at the grocery store near my house, so yellow onions had to do. It was fantastic, just the same. A recipe we will make again and again.

Rating: 4
This recipe is a winner! We eat a lot of sprouts in our house, but this was a new method of preparation for us. I followed the recommendations below (halved the sugar, used balsamic instead of cider vinegar and waited until most of the water evaporated before adding the last 3T of butter) and subbed in some red onion because I didnt have quite enough shallot. I used the chopping blade in food processor to chop the shallots and onions and while those cooked on the stove I used the same chopping blade to slice up the trimmed (but not halved) sprouts. It was fast and easy. My end product looked a bit like a slaw, but it was super fast and tasted delicious. Next time I will reduce the butter a bit and increase the vinegar a bit. Bacon bits (if you are in to pork) or some parmesan cheese could make this over-the-top delicious.

Who knew brussel sprouts could be so addictive? I used balsamic vinegar and smart balance light instead of the butter. SO GOOD. I promise.

I only recently learned that I like brussel sprouts, and this recipe is my new favorite way to make them. I took a few tips from the previous comments: 1. reduced the sugar by half 2. used balsamic instead of apple cider vinegar 3. added butter to sprouts after water evaporated, rather than at the same time It was FANTASTIC. I served it with lamb and roasted lemon-thyme potatoes, and will make it again and again, maybe trying a little more olive oil and a little less butter.

This is an exceptional brussels sprout recipe. Made it (as is) several times with Turkey and Prime Rib. Shallots are perfect, but onions (sweet are best) work well too. Family and friends loved it - even those that are not brussels sprout fans. Great as leftovers as well.

Made it for Thanksgiving and it was a hit...even for those claiming they don't like sprouts. I found I had too much water at the end and had to drain and put in an ice bath so they would not over cook. Also topped it with some diced cooked turkey bacon which added a lot of dimension and was particularly appealing to the non-sprout lovers.

Rating: 4
My four star rating is for the caramelized shallots portion of the recipe. Delicious and would be a great addition to other vegetables, and steak or burgers.I prefer my own brussels sprouts recipe. I roast them whole in a 400 degree oven, with olive oil and sea salt. The roasting brings out the sweetness of the sprouts and requires less attention from the cook.

Rating: 3
Good, but easy to overcook the sprouts, even with a very large pan, as the volume is such that they steamed themselves even before the water was added. Next time, I would double the shallots (super yummy)and cook the sprouts in two batches. I also cut back on the sugar by half and thought it was fine. Don't skip the butter!

Don't hesitate, make it. This TG no one knew that brussel sprouts were on the table. Everyone tried it and were blown away by the flavor. Sprouts have never tasted this good. I used my Cuisinart to prep the shallots and sprouts, cooked them just before dinner was served and they were nice and crisp. It's a new staple for Thanksgiving.

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving based on the rave reviews. We almost cut back on the amount of butter (and may have a little bit on the 2nd amount) but deferred to the recipe and found it didn't taste too greasy or oily. Converted non-brussels sprouts eaters- one even copied the recipe before we went home. Of course, the kids were not wowed, but the adults loved it. Will definitely make this again.

We love this recipe. We make it all the time, and it's become a Thanksgiving staple. It's delicious as is, but I usually cut down on the second round of butter by about a tablespoon -- in fact, to make it vegan for a housemate, I often use earth balance and can't tell the difference. I also only add about 3/4 cup of water to the sprouts. This is so good.

This is a delicious way to serve Brussels Sprouts. I've made this a few times now, and I change very little - half the butter and a 1/4 C of crumbled bacon. I found that by prepping all of the ingredients and storing them in tight plastic, I can throw the saute together a few minutes before dinner and not lose the greeness and crispness of the sprouts. It's a Thanksgiving staple.

This was very good. I used finely sliced onions because I was out of shallots, and it was delicious. I'm sure it's even better with the subtle flavour of shallots.

This is delicious. I used Sherry vinegar since I was out of cider vinegar. Next time, as suggested in another review, I will use my food processor to cut down on prep time. And will try rendering some bacon to cook the brussels sprouts in the fat. Then crumble the cooked bacon over the top of the dish as a garnish.

I never liked brussel sprouts and I think I've found my new favorite dish! This is sooo yummy and way better than the sprouts I used to gag on as a child (sorry mom). I only used 2 T of butter to carmelize the onions (white onions because I was out of shallots) and had to use white wine vinegar because I didn't have cider vinegar. Also used chicken broth instead of water. Can't wait to make this one again.

This is a WOW recipe. I had never cooked fresh brussels sprouts before and while the prep was a little work, the results are worth it. The only change I made was to use chicken stock instead of water. I think brussels sprouts are a surprisingly delicate vegetable and perhaps worth the effort of finding fresh, local produce. We would make this to serve guests at a holiday meal.

Wow, this is a keeper! Made this for guests and even the non-brussels sprout eater had 2 helpings! Did make some changes to boost the flavor- Only used butter when caramelizing the shallots (to cut down on calories), added 1/2 cup pure apple juice, and only 1/8 cup water, as I prefer the vegetables on the crisp side. Threw in a dash of crushed red pepper-fabulous!

This is my first time Ever having brussel sprouts, a shame I know. Just finished a test batch, just to be sure before making the full 10 servings for an upcoming dinner party. Amazing! Such a wonderful nuttiness from the butter, combined with crispy, caramelized shallots and a great note of freshness from the sprouts themselves. I'm positive this is going to be a big hit. They are a touch greasy, but if you cut down on the butter you'll be decreasing the great nutty tone. Speaking of which, I imagine lightly toasted hazelnuts or pecans would go lovely with this.

Rating: 4
Really tasty. I cut down the recipe by about a third. After making it according to the recipe, I would say that if you are worried about fat, you don't need to add the butter to the sprouts after you've just sauteed them in olive oil.

Wonderfully nutty, homey way to use your brussel sprouts. I didn't remember to buy shallots, so I used a leek instead. Didn't use all 4 tsp sugar - maybe 3? Used only 1/2 cup of water because another reviewer suggested not over-cooking it and I was scared of a smushy result. Thought it was perfect. Next time, thinking about sprinkling crushed, crispy bacon (or pancetta) and tiny bits of crumbled, mild goat cheese on top.

To WDBEDZYK on 3/21/09: I have made this recipe several times; I cut the amount of butter in half and it's still great. Out of curiosity and your post, I decided to try it with cauliflower. I blanch the florets first, then drained them and continued with the recipe as written. Just before serving I topped with a very small amount of Parmigiano Reggiano, grated with a microplane grater. ALSO excellent. You should try it yourself!

Hooray for Brussels Sprouts! As a kid I was pretty sure I hated them, and as an adult I was dubious, at best, about their merit on the everyday table; that is, until I found this recipe. I've made this dish half a dozen times and get rave reviews every time. Now I omit the sugar and replace the butter with a Benocol spread like Smart Balance. The sweetness of the onions comes out naturally if you let them caramelize on their own. If you're nervous about brussels sprouts - this is the one to try!

For 20 years my husband has insisted he hates brussel sprouts. My 17yo and 10yo had never eaten them. I made this recipe for myself and while it was cooking, they all commented on how good it smelled. Al three of them had second helpings and a couple of weeks later, my 10yo asked when we were going to have "that chopped sprout thing again". I did make some modifications based on the reviews - half the sugar and half the water, both sprouts and shallots sauted in 50:50 butter and olive oil with no extra butter added to the sprouts. This dish is part of our regular vegetable rotation now. I just wish I could find a way to do the same thing with cauliflower!

Ugh. I love brussels sprouts and was looking for a new way to prepare them. This was awful. Sickly sweet and greasy. 3/4 stick of butter AND 3T olive oil? Eww. I prepared it after reading the stellar reviews, but it was really disgusting.

Had it for Thanksgiving dinner. I enjoyed it though my husband would have preferred less sugar on the shallots. I think this would still be good without the sugar OR the vinegar.

This was insanely good. I did do a couple of the changes recommended by other posters and one of my own. 1. I did it as a one pan dish -- caramelize the shallots and remove to a bowl, then cook the sprouts. 2. I added crumbled bacon -- I cooked an extra couple of slices at breakfast and added them near the end. 3. I used sherry vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. This was a noticeable improvement and welcome change. I know a lot of people have said that this is a great recipe for people who don't like sprouts, and I'll buy that. But I do like them, and their flavor really shines and combines well with the shallots. You could sub onions, but I'd recommend going with the shallots.

Wonderful. Shallots are too expensive but they taste like onion and garlic so I substituted those, and the dish was excellent.

This is amazing!!! I have made this several times now and it is a HUGE hit every time...even with brussels sprouts haters. I don't use the butter at the end and not as much sugar on the shallots. Definitely company worthy. Made it for Thanksgiving yesterday and I have a feeling it will become a regular on the menu!

My husband and I are on a low fat diet and I made this with 1 tablespoon of butter and 5 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and it was fantastic! I used the butter and 2 tablespoons to saute then added the olive oil with the water. Not everything needs butter to taste great!

This is definitely worth the time it takes to slice all the brussels sprouts.

Excellent! We loved it. FYI - Don't waste your ingredients making a big batch so you'll have leftovers the next day, like I did - as this is definately best consumed fresh. Leftovers loose their texture and flavor.

For the woman with the son allergic to butter you can definitly make this with margarine. Last year I made it for thanksgiving with margarine and it came out perfectly. This dish was so good that everyone requested I make it again this year!

To jodam from Silver Spring, if your son has a dairy allergy, butter most likely will not bother him, since it is almost all fat. Dairy allergies are usually reactions to the milk sugar or the diary proteins. I love everything about this dish.

This is a delicious, spectacularly unusual vegetable dish that I plan to add to my Thanksgiving repertoire. I did make some modest, time-saving changes: I trimmed, then sliced the brussels sprouts, then washed them in a strainer; I sauteed them as suggested (using less oil), then micro-waved them (for about 3 minutes, as I remember - leaving them somewhat under- cooked) without adding any water. The rest I did as directed, but I made the dish ahead of time and just reheated it (in a large fry pan) for serving.

Took this to a dinner party because I was just tired of the same old veggies. Had a moment of panic when I realized I had brought brussels sprouts ... more than a little risky. This was a big hit - had to give the recipe to 2 people and one made it for her supper club the next week.

This was awesome! I recently convinced my husband he actually did like brussels sprouts through the use of a few other recipes but this one was the best by far. I didn't have any shallots so I used a finely sliced sweet onion which resulted in taking a little longer to carmelize but it turned out find in the end. I used vegetable broth from a box (always on hand, either chicken or veggie) in place of the water for flavor. I also cut back on the butter and oil because and found that it browned up just fine but still had a sweet, buttery taste as a compliment. Using the apple cider vinegar is another compliment to this side dish because it provides a balanced sweet acidity that I like with greens such as this. Per another reviewer's suggestion, I had planned to put some toasted almonds up on top before serving but forgot about them completely in the midst of finishing off everything else for dinner, they would have been an awesome complimentary flavor but this was just fine without it. Smokehouse almonds might be good too if they were on hand, in my opinion. I'll definitely be coming back to this recipe for more brussels sprout hater converts!

The flavors were good, but I found that adding a whole cup of water made my brussels sprouts too mushy - next time I'll add far less water, I may omit it altogether. The shallots were a nice compliment, but I will consider reducing the sugar next time as well.

My husband calls brussel sprouts rabbit brains and eats one to make me happy, he loved these! I halved the recipe and used balsamic vinegar.

My whole family - including the sprout-haters - gobbled this one up. I added a splash of good quality balsamic at the end since the cider vinegar didn't seem like it would sweeten it up enough for the non-veggie crowd, but it did taste good to me. I loved slicing the sprouts since it made them cook so much faster. With fresh sprouts you might not need as much sugar.

Wow! This is so good! Didn't have enough shallots so I used one large red onion and sauteed it down with 1 1/2 tbl oil. Great texture and taste. Caramelized onion masked some of the bitterness of brussel sprouts. Very Easy!

I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts, but my husband loves them. I thought this recipe looked like a nice compromise, and boy was I right. It was delicious, and I too ate it cold the next day! I'm not a fan of apple cider vinegar, so I use balsamic. I didn't use water to cook the sprouts either, so they would brown and get a little crusty. This will be a dish I will prepare at every future Thanksgiving.

I thought that this recipe was pretty good, but nothing to swoon over. The shallots almost overwhelm the sprout flavor, which I think is part of the reason that people have reported that people who don't like Brussels sprouts have liked this dish. I reduced the amount ob butter and oil, but I still don't think that the recipe is worth the fat or the prep time.

I threatened to serve Brussels sprouts at my Christmas party because some of my guests couldn't believe they could possibly like them. It became a kind of joke. Then I made this recipe and guess what? It was the only dish that had NO leftovers. That bowl was scraped clean! I should have made more. As for this recipe, I caramelized the shallots the night before. Great time saver. I also did not use any water to cook the sprouts. I simply sauteed them; water isn't necessary because they are sliced so thin they cook quickly. If you want to add water, I would use much less than the 1 cup called for.

This was one of the best recipes that I have found for brussel sprouts. My son just loves this vegetable but we don't often find recipes for it and so we jumped at trying it. It was delicious.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving, but I used some of the modifications suggested in the reviews. First, I added pancetta (but I think next time I'll used good old fashioned American bacon for it's smokiness). I used a little less sugar,less butter/olive oil, and broth instead of water. Finally, there was too much liquid at the end, so I had to drain it off to avoid overcooking the sprouts. There are few things worse than overcooked sprouts. Next time I'll use less broth. Anyway, everyone raved that it was the best dish on the table.

This is so, so, so delicious. I only used 1T of butter overall, if even that, and I imagine it would taste meltingly rich if you put all the butter called for. But I was just cooking for myself a simple lunch and didn't need all that richness. I used some low sodium chicken broth in lieu of water, and lots of pepper makes this dish pop! Had it with a link of Trader Joe's chicken sausage and it was the best lunch I've cooked for myself in a while!

I did a test run of this recipe last night for Thanksgiving, using some frozen sprouts that my husband purchased. I prefer fresh to frozen if given the choice, but I had the frozen sprouts and the shallots, so I thought it worth a try. These were just fabulous. I sliced the shallots in the FP as suggested by another, but because the sprouts were frozen I sliced them by hand. If they were this good using frozen sprouts, I can't imagine how good they'll be using the real thing.

Much to my dismay, I received sprouts last week from my organic produce delivery service. Well, this recipe more than made up for it! These are delicious!!!!

I loved the end result. This is definitely one of those dishes to try and convince people who think they don't like brussels sprouts to try them! but I will say that I refuse to dirty two skillets for a side dish. that would be especially impractical on Thanksgiving! I cooked the shallots first, then set them aside while I did the sprouts in the same pan, then added the shallots back. It may take longer that way but that way you can stagger the prep, too (slide the brussels sprouts while the shallots are cooking). Other than that I made as written. Agree you could probably cut back on the butter, they are very rich. Yum! Definitely will make again.
