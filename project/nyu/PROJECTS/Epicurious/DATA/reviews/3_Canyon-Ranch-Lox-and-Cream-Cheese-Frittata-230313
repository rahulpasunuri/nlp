A great way to use up leftover lox or other smoked salmon. I made this on a weekend and had easily re-heatable, delicious left-overs for breakfast into the next week. Also, I used a smaller pan than I think was intended, which meant less surface area was exposed on the top, which in turn led me to use less cream cheese than was called for. I'd say I used maybe a few tablespoons, and found the finished product to be just as great (and healthier!) than I imagine it would have been, otherwise. A keeper!

I'm trying to loose weight. This recipe was easy, satisfying and low on calories and fat. I did add sauted green onions, asparagus, and capers to the egg mixture. Everything else I prepared as suggested.
