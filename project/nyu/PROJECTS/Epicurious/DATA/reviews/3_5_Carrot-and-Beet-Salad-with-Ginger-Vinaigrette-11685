Surprise hit at Easter lunch. Made to add color to ham and scalloped potato menu. Made as written, except added 1 tsp honey and juice from half an orange (I liked how that sounded from other reviewer). I used finer grater on food processor for carrots and wished I hadn't. Larger grater was perfect for beets. Salad does get a little juicy after sitting, so strain before serving (but save juice for storing leftovers). Everone was surprised the beets were not cooked, they didn't taste raw! I will chiffonade (slice) spinach next time. Even baby leaves were a but awkward with the grated beets and carrots, but delicious and beautiful. Try this!!

I made this as a side dish contribution to a family dinner and, because I had 5 lbs of rainbow carrots on hand, left out the beets. I was concerned when I first added the vinaigrette - it seemed very strong too "vinaigrey" but by the time it was served - about 1-1/2 hours later - it had mellowed considerably. It's a great way to add colour to a meal and the leftovers were great the next day for lunch with some quinoa and black beans.

All I can say is yummm! I've been looking for something easy to do with my home grown beets (that are STILL in the garden in Jan.) and this was beautiful and good! The food processor made things really easy and my family loved it. I did use a little more rice vinegar that was called for because we like a little "wetter" salad, but either way, it's good.

Love everything in this salad, however I added 1 TBSP honey and 1 Tsp Orange zest to the dressing. Beets love orange and it added just that special touch. Great recipe, thanks.

Really tasty! Half the recipe is a great lunch for two. Put it on top of a little lettuce. Adjustments: 2 Tbl Onion instead of shallot (didn't have), 1-1.5 Tbl ginger, Seasoned Rice Vinegar, omitted sesame oil, 4-6 drops Chili oil instead of Tabasco, 1/3 c oil. Also finely julienned the veggies instead of shredding them, which was very pretty but a little more difficult to eat.

This was excellent. I love ginger and sesame. Guests loved it too. It would be a lot of work without a food processor, though, so I would not recommend making this if you are grating by hand!

Yum! Great recipe, and easy if you have a food processor. I added about 1/2 c. raisins, as one reviewer suggested. And a great way to be able to mix the beets & carrots together in one bowl w/out all the color bleed is to use Chiogga beets! Got some at the farmer's market this week. All the beet flavor but none of the dark red color takeover! I rated this three forks vs. four because it felt just a touch to simple...I'd have loved a few extra ingredients, along the lines of the raisins, to jazz it up just a bit. Still, we're enjoying it, and I'll make it again!

So it took me awhile to make this because I have never used beets before, so it was difficult to figure out how to work with them (for me at least). Other than that everything was delicious! I loved how simple it was and also how healthy it is. I plan to make the dressing by itself and use it on different salads in the future.

I was excited to try a recipe that didn't ask me to cook the beets. This was ok. I honestly didn't think that the flavor of the dressing was strong enough to mellow out the harshness of the raw beets (and I love beets). But, I'll try this again when I get more beets and adjust the dressing amounts to my own tastes. Worth a try, just may need some adjusting to match what you like.

This salad is so beautiful and vibrant in colour. I grated the carrots and beets in one bowl (didn't bother separating the two), poured the dressing and added baby spinach leaves. I mixed everything together and left it in the fridge for a couple of hours before serving. Rice wine vinegar is quite strong, so I think I may use another type of vinegar next time. It takes a lot of elbow grease to grate the beets and carrots, and I always say I'll make this salad maybe twice a year but I've made it three times this summer already! It's just so beautiful and a true hit with your friends and family!

This was excellent. Unfortunately, I was late getting dinner on the table and took a couple of short cuts. Next time I make it, I will be more careful to drain the shredded carrots and beats. Because everything was so moist, the dressing didn't stick to the veggies very well. i added a touch of salt. Served it w a pork tenderloin that had a very sweet glaze - this detracted from the salad. In think something savory would have set it off better

Very good and fresh for summer. I'm going to add golden raisins next time, as a twist on the carrot and raisin salad made with mayo.

Oh my God -- this is good. Prepared exactly as written and LOVED it. Served as a side with feta burgers and corn on the cob, and had the leftovers in a pita the next day with hummus. This will be a staple in our house, and very good for you!

I really liked this recipe- probably because it is so different and the colors are so vibrant. Visually, it makes a lovely and dramatic presentation- the spinach is key!. And I enjoyed the beets raw- because of the way they are cut- they are able to soak up enough of the dressing to make them a little more tender. Overall though, it is the rawness of the veggies that makes this appealing to me. This would make a great, easy salad to bring when asked to bring a salad- especially if there will be more than one. i served it with chicken on the grill, rice pilaf and the spring roasted vegetables w. salsa verde from Epicurious- (now there is a 5 fork recipe!)

In my opinion this dish was good, but not great. The dressing is the most interesting part. I had some dressing left over and I used it as a marinade and dip with London broil. Really good! It's also good in a steak or ham sandwich with mustard!

I'm not a fan of beets but will - grudgingly - eat them if they are put in front of me. However, I must admit, this dish was really tasty. I was glad to find it - now I know what to do when well-meaning friends give me beets from their gardens! I, too, mixed the beets and carrots. The visually startling (but attractive) color combo is lost when you mix them - but the resulting shades of red and redder is also quite attractive.

Wonderful flavor, a snap to make with a grating attachment for the food processor. Makes a beautiful presentation with the two bright colors. I will save the leftover dressing for soba noodles as suggested by another reviewer.

Absolutely delicious! My husband made this to serve along side some soba noodles with tofu that I made. It complemented the Japanese food well, and was quick and simple to make, which is not always easy to find in a beet recipe. To save on dishes, we tossed the carrots and beets together, and it still made for a lovely presentation.

I served this alongside pork tenderloin. Delicious. And pretty! I mixed the beets and carrots together, rather than keeping the apart. Make it a couple of hours before you plan to serve so all the flavors can blend together.

Well worth breaking out the food processor. I get vegetable boxes delivered and never know what to do with the carrots that are left over after I eat the more perisable veggies. This time I got a few beets, and this salad was great! Here are my variations: I reduced the oil to about 1TB olive and 2TB dark sesame oil and added 5TB pureed carrots and 3-4TB water instead. I subsituted concentrated 4 TB ginger-garlic sauce for the ginger, an extra clove of garlic for the scallions, thai chili dipping sauce for the tabasco, and omitted the spinach. Garnished with black sesame seeds. I had grated carrots and dressing left over and used that for a cold soba noodle salad. I stir-fried thai style cubed baked tofu and the carrots, then added the sauce and soba noodles. Then finished with a garnish of black sesame seeds and chopped peanuts. This could be made with raw carrots, but my s.o. has allergies. The best soba dish I've made yet!

I modified this recipe by heating the garlic, shallot and ginger in the sesame oil until they started to brown, and then adding the soy and vinegar and bringing to a boil. Although I never tried the recipe without this step, I think it conferred a nice caramelized note to the flavor and gave the dish more depth overall. I think that half a cup of olive oil is too much, and would decrease it in the future.

This is a wonderful, refreshing salad. I have added freshly grated turnip to the mix and served in separate, small scoops in individual lettuce cups. A beautiful looking and tasting salad.

I have made this salad several times now, and I just love it! The dressing compliments the flavour of the beets very well. It is a nice change from standard salad fare!
