I chose this recipe because I was searching for a way to use some lovely Savoy Cabbage and it so happened that I had dried Porcinis in the pantry. Well, my husband liked this more than I did. The cabbage-porcini mixture was not particularly attractive and not all that tasty. The chicken turned out well, so can't complain there. But I won't be making this again.

This was tasty enough served over rice, but seemed to be lacking something despite increasing the garlic and marinading overnight. I'm not sure what it's missing though...

I used fresh crimini mushrooms (sauteed them when I would have been re-constructing the others) and green cabbage for the savoy cabbage since both were what I had on hand, and the recipe still turned out really well. Light yet deep flavors and I agree that the chicken is surprisingly moist.

I found this to be somewhat blandish. The chicken was very tender though.

I'm not sure why this recipe isn't getting better reviews, but I found it to be excellent and I'm looking forward to making it again. For a chicken recipe, it had complex flavors. It was a nice dish for a winter dinner.

Wonderful dish. The aroma of the porcini and the strong cabbage taste blended well with the chicken. As a variant, try using duck breast instead of chicken.

The cabbage was nasty. The chicken was pretty good, like a kebab. Don't bother with this ensemble.

An interesting dish (not damning with faint praise). Cabbage and mushrooms (could also use shitake) combination tastes better than I thought it would, especially in support of the chicken. I was looking for variety in low-fat meals, and this definitely qualifies. Good, satisfying, will do again.
