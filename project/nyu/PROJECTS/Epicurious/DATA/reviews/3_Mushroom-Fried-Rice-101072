This came out pretty good. I made it for a potluck at work, and some loved it. Although others didn't touch it, maybe because the presentation lacked something. I think I'm rice-challenged. I can never get it to the right moistness before burning it on the bottom. So, to escape burning it, the rice was little softer/wetter than I'd like. The mushroom/garlic/cilantro combo was great, and I think next time I'll beef up the mushroom content a bit. Also, instead of rice wine I used two tbsps of white cooking wine and one tbsp of rice vinegar. It worked and gave it a little tanginess. I only did that because I was in a time crunch and didn't want to have to find an asian store. So I worked with what I had in the cupboard.

This is good. The one thing that moves it from 3 to 4 forks is in the way one prepairs the rice. Observe: Have you ever noticed how the good Asian resturants have a "chewy" consistency to their stir fried rice? They do, trust me. The way to get it in your home is to make good rice (go to a local Asian market and look for the "butterfly brand"; usually sold in bulk in a burlap sack) Cook it and then, and I am not kidding here, put it in a bowl, put the bowl in a paper bag and put the paper bag (with freshly cooked rice inside)in the cupboard overnight. Re-heat the rice the next day and you wont believe how good it is. Enjoy!

I served it with the Soy-Lemon Chicken. Everyone loved it.
