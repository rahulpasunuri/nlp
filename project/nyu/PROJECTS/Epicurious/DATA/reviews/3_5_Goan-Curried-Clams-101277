Very nice simple recipe. It might not be authentic to do this, but adding some thai fish sauce would add a nice dimension to this dish.

Found it a tad on the salty side, but otherwise very good.

Very easy and VERY tasty. Our 2 year liked it and our guest drank all the broth that was left.

My husband and I love steamed clams, so we're always looking for different ways to prepare them. We used fresh baked french bread to soak up the broth - yum!

The name of this dish is Xek Xek and sometimes it is made without coconut milk. All the spices are ground in grated coconut. Honestly, if Westerners want to eat Indian food they should stop using the word CURRY and learn the right names of the dishes. Otherwise the individual flavours of the dishes will never be tasted and apreciated.

i substituted mussels for clams, and pureed the cooking liquid before cooking the mussels. i also added garlic and white wine to the broth.
