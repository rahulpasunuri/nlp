Husbands been wanting me to make some good ole biscuits and I came across this recipe and he loves it! I just add a little bit of self rising flour with the recipe, and I'm a southern girl from a small country town and I don't know what European butter is, so I used plain ole butter! Turned out great! I did make some sausage gravy to go over my biscuits and it was wonderful!! I used Baking powder I think that was what it needs! I thought someone said recipe said baking soda!

Fluffy and moist, but not flaky. An easy recipe. I followed the recipe except for using regular butter, not European. I couldn't get them to brown as much as in the picture, which might have been b/c of the butter. Overall, not better than my grandma's biscuits.

This is my grandma's recipe. The only difference is that she used full fat heavy cream. Delicious!

I guess no one is really reading this recipe it calls for 2T of baking POWDER not soda.

Is 2 tablespoons of baking soda an error? I did not care for the strong baking soda aftertaste (even after I cut down on it) - quite bad.

I too used a cup of half 'n' half in place of whole milk and really loved the results. totally simple, made perfectly moist and flaky layered biscuits, great consistency and flavor.

outstanding, my go to biscuit recipe from here on. I subbed in a cup of half and half for the whole milk, and feel sure that grandma walters would have approved. very tender biscuit.

Love! Love! Love this recipe! I've been looking for a biscuit recipe for YEARS! I didn't have whole milk so substituted 1/3 c. sour cream + 2/3 c. lowfat milk, I increased the sugar to 1tbsp, but otherwise left recipe as is. The result is light, flaky, buttery and delightfully melt-in-your mouth goodness. The best biscuits I've had since childhood!

Loved these biscuits! I have been looking for an easy and delicious biscuit recipe that makes biscuits with both fluff and flake. They worked well with a reduction of baking powder--I used 4t instead of 2T.

Extraordinary! I made these this morning and I simply can't get over how delicious they are! I didn't have European butter on hand, but they turned out perfectly, regardless. I also substituted heavy cream for the milk and they had a crispy, brown cover to a delectable, soft, warm, light, magical interior. I would eat these every morning if I could!

This was a good, simple recipe. I did both of the substitutions. The result was a biscuit that was a little salty with a bit of a soda aftertaste. I would definitely make it again, lowering the salt content and maybe doing a powder/soda combination. The biscuits had a great color, layering, and fluffiness!
