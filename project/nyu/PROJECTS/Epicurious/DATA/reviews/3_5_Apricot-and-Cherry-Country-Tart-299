the fruit was great, but i replaced the butter in the crust with margarine. don't do that -- the crust was hard instead of flaky. but i'll definitely try it again without messing without altering the crust, because the cherries and apricots were great.

This dessert is very tasty and the crust is light and flaky. I did, however, substitute fresh raspberries for the cherries, and I baked it in a 9" springform pan with the bottom wrapped in foil and placed on a cookie sheet. This worked quite well and I didn't have to fuss with sliding the tart off the parchment. A tart pan with a removable bottom would have worked, too but mine was too big. The apricots I used must have been extra large because I could only get five to fit in the pan. This is an excellent way to use the wonderful fresh apricots, berries, and bing cherries that are in season right now. I will definitely make it again and try the cherries next time.

This is a wonderful tart--so simple yet so elegant. It's one of my favorite desserts.
