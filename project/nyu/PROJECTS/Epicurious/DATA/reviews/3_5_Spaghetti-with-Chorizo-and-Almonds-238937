This was really bad. We have a similar Spanish dish made with arborio rice in our regular rotation, so we were excited to try this variation. Even with best quality Spanish chorizo and saffron, it was really bland. None of the flavors came through.

Wonderful. I only changed proportions because I had 1/2 lb of chorizo in my fridge. Therefore, I used a whole box of angel hair (14oz). I did not double the garlic, but I doubled everything else. Unfortunately I didn't have fresh parsley. I ended up using about 1/3 cup of dry parsley (I was worried it wouldn't taste good.) I also FORGOT the almonds. Shucks. anyway, it was great. I made it for some friends and we all couldn't stop eating it. I would even put in more chorizo next time, because it was delicious. I can't wait to do it with fresh parsley.

I used corn spaghetti, I had to add extra liquid, but it turned out really nice. I also added the chick peas into the chorizo when I sautéed it because I was afraid they wouldn't incorporate well due to what other reviewers said. My dish turned out creamy, dinner guests asked how I achieved a cheese consistency with no cheese!

Very good! I used whole wheat angel hair (which worked well but did take more than 6 minutes and required a little extra water), but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. Yum!

I found this recipe because I had a little bit of chorizo I wanted to use. I made this according to the recipe except that I added a few tomatoes and some chili powder. It was pretty easy to make and came out good! I agree with the rater that thought the chickpeas seemed a little out of place. Other than that, I'll definitely be making this again.

Saffron broth and chorizo create a unique, delicious savory flavor for this dish. Garbonzo beans and crunchy almonds are a nice touch to this quick, healthy one-dish meal.

I was excited to find this recipe. Ive never made pasta this way before and wanted to give it a try. We loved the dish. My husband isnt a fan of most pasta dishes but proclaimed this one excellent! I dont think it needs any more chorizo. I dont think it needs more of anything its perfect as is served with a salad. Its nice to find some recipes that have a little bit of meat for flavor but arent focused around the meat.

Interesting flavor, but a bit heavy overall for my tastes. I used whole wheat vermicelli, which is difficult to discern the color change with, and probably contributed to the heaviness. Not having stuck to the original recipe, I wish I could delete my rating, but don't know how. Just saying, probably shouldn't go the whole wheat route with this one.

I made this recipe and everyone at my home loved it. I used left over garbanzos that I had cooked in a made from scratch chicken broth. Also I sauteed the chorizo. The garbanzos are an important ingredient in this recipe, the problem is that canned garbanzos do not taste right.

If your a cilantro fan..I add cilantro instead of parsley..and instead of saffron..paprika or smoked paprika

This a a very unusual and tasty dish, but was a bit skimpy for 4 people. I used slightly less oil and butter, omitted the chick peas, and added some chopped scallions on top.

My wife loved this one but I thought it was a bit boring as is. Were I to make it again, I would certainly double the chorizo, put other bits of meat in it, ditch the fideos and increase the garbanzos. However, all I would be doing is trying to make it closer to a cocido madrileño, which is a far superior dish to this and involves bits of other meat and tocino (lard). This dish is a lot of trouble for what is an ordinary result - so you might as well make a cocido.

In response to the comment from the cook on 08/08/07 - keep in mind that Mexican chorizo and Spanish chorizo are really very different. If it's ground and loose, or if it's even soft, it's Mexican chorizo. Spanish chorizo is drier and a little hard, like a firm salami, only tasting nothing like salami.

I truly hate when people write a review and say that they substituted most of the ingredients listed, but yet feel compelled to write a review anyway. That being said, I did make some substitutions. I used shallots for onions and I used fresh mushrooms (baby bellas) for chickpeas. I have nothing against the legume, I was just trying to appeal to our 8-year old son. I also try hard to dirty as few pans as possible. So, I used a pyrex quart measuring cup and microwaved the broth (3 cups CN broth, no H2O), wine and saffron, plus some smoked paprika. I sauteed chorizo first (6 oz, half-inch dice) and removed it from the pan. I then added the cleaned mushrooms (quartered, peeled, not washed), and sauteed for 5 minutes. I then added the broken thin spaghetti until golden brown. Then, I made space on the bottom for the shallots and sauteed for 3 minutes, then moved that around and sauteed the garlic for one more minute. Added the hot broth-wine mixture and a healthy sprinkle of parsley. After 8 minutes, I added the cooked chorizo, followed by marcone almonds very coarsely chopped. This was terrific and loved by all. My husband thought he would like to try it next time with the chickpeas, but even our son loved it as is. I told my son it reminded me of Rice-a-roni, but he had no idea what I was talking about. My husband even sang the jingle, but it wasn't ringing any bells. Good dish, though.

Absolutely in agreement with other reviews about doubling the chorizo!

I've made this recipe twice now since finding it first in Gourmet, then going back to it online. The chick peas just don't add that much. And 1/2 cup of parsley is WAY overkill. We altered to just enough to toss through as garnish. Otherwise, it pays to search out Spanish Chorizo. I've bought two different brands and there are differences in saltiness and smokiness. I prefer more smoky, less salty. This is a great dish for experimentation. More or less liquid; chick peas or no chick peas, or an alternate legume. The first time I made this it seemed lighter, the pasta and other ingredients more distinct. The second time I wondered if I was making the same dish. It came out heavier, darker - still very tasty. I would make this as an any weeknight dish, or to bring to a carnivore's dinner party.

This is a great recipe. My husband and I have made it several times for our friends they love it too. The only change we made was doubling the amount of chorizo. Gotta have meat!

My husband and I have made this a few times. We love it. So do all of our friends who we have made it for. The only thing we changed was to double the chorizo, (gotta have meat!).

I've made this recipe twice- the first time I followed the recipe to the letter. It was OK. As I was eating it I was thinking about how I could make it better. The problem was that the tastes didn't meld together. So the second time I chopped the chorizo into small chucks so that it would be better incorporated into the dish and sauted it w/ the onion and garlic. I found that frying the chorizo made it too hard and crunchy (maybe I did it wrong) I also added chopped chicken breast and omited the chickpeas as I don't think it added anything to the dish. The second time it was amazing. Soo good in fact that we haven't stopped talking about how good it was and I'm making it again tonight.

Absolutely outstanding. I bought the ground chorizo at a Mexican grocery store along with the fideos and inexpensive saffron. The fideos an chorizoare really key--so easy and my dinner club guests went crazy-I have made it three more times. --extra garlic is good, too.

After assembling all the ingredients for this recipe, I read the previous reviews. Determined to make it anyway, I looked for ways to add more flavor. First I used all chicken broth instead of diluting it with water. I added a bit of smoked paprika. Trying to keep the saturated fat down, I only used a teaspoon of butter and a bit more olive oil when toasting the pasta. I coarsely chopped the chorizo to more evenly disperse it throughout the pasta and then removed most of the rendered fat (which admittedly would have added more flavor, but its so high in saturated fat). In the end I added a cup of chopped tomato and 10 oz of steamed chopped spinach. Before serving, I topped it with a gremolata (chopped parsley, lemon rind and garlic) and the toasted almonds and drizzled the olive oil from the toasted almonds over the top. I don't know how this version would stack up to the recipe as printed, but everyone had seconds and I couldn't wait for lunch leftovers.

I thought this was very good, except: 1) the garbanzos seemed weird and I would omit them next time 2) I would double the chorizo, as there really wasn't very much in there. (Make sure to use Spanish chorizo, which is cured. It took me forever to find it, but I found it tasted very similar to Portuguese linguica, which is easier for me to find.)

This is a nightmare of a recipe. The proportions are all off, and is tasteless (not even the saffron can pull this one off). Try anything else.

Maybe it was my chorizo, but we found this a little boring. The garlic was delicious, and the almonds gave it a nice toasty crunch, but it needed more flavor-- I'll try it again with more and spicier sausage.

Awesome recipe. Make sure not to overcook the garlic, and the chorizo should be well-browned. We've made this twice already. Love it, and it's good for leftovers, too.

Make sure you don't overcook the garlic but make sure the chorizo is well browned. I've made it twice already.
