I've made this every Thanksgiving for the past 10 years. As cranberries aren't available where I live (Tanzania), I've had to adapt. I buy a bag of whole dried cranberries from Trader Joe's each summer, plus dried blueberries and/or cherries and save them for this recipe. I reconstitute the dried berries in the zinfandel if I can find it. There were no zins to be found in the whole of Dar this year, so I used merlot. Worked just fine. Yummy!

Like many other reviews, this sauce is the must have for our Turkey Day. I had popped back on here to check proportions before cooking, and loved the ideas other cooks have posted, such as the Buddha's Hand citrus and using it for toppings on cheese.Some folk have mentioned not being able to find cranberries after the holidays, and since this sauce is so fabulous, I thought I'd share my two tips. I stock up on cranberries during the peak season when they're on sale and freeze them. That way, I have them for recipes year round. Second, this sauce can be canned using any standard canning recipe (The Ball Blue Book of Canning has a great one), and makes a spectacular gift. It's super simple, even if you're new to canning, and you need very little in the way of special equipment.I'm off to make my sauce with all the fabulous tweaks you wonderful cooks have posted! Cheers!

I've made this recipe for 11 years now. It is perfect just as written IMHO. Delicious! A crowd pleaser and very easy to make as well.

Made recipe without whole allspice as only had ground, used a pinch of ground otherwise followed as written. Once the sugars added to sauce pan with the 1 3/4 c. Zin the volume is greater than 1 3/4c. contrary to prior review - this leaves more Zin for the cook to enjoy and share with another :) Able to reduce to 1 3/4c. in time specified. Tasty.

I made this for the first time this Thanksgiving, and have saved it for use in the future. Loved it! One thing confused me though. The recipe calls for 1 3/4 c. Zinfandel, then asks you to cook the recipe down to 1 3/4 c. Huh?? I used a bottle of Z. (minus one glass for the cook to drink) and it took it maybe 30 mins. to boil down to 1 3/4 c. I think next time I'll use 2 - 2 1/2 c. I used a bit less sugar than it called for, and powdered allspice as I couldn't find whole. Next time I'll throw in a few peppercorns and/or some cut up candied ginger. I think more orange zest wouldn't hurt it either. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

I've made this for the last two Thanksgivings. I like to use Beaujolais Nouveau, since it is a celebration of the season. Last year I also used Buddha hand zest, which was an experiment I will surely repeat this year.

Used a Shiraz instead for a little "bite". Took about 20 mins for berries to pop. Came in the kitchen as sauce was cooling and boyfriend had picked up the pan to spoon out the hot remnants directly into mouth. Enough said. Next time I will make a double batch, as this was a fav that folks really wanted to go with their leftovers. Alas, none left!

I have made this several times, and always use a Seghesio Zin that is my favorite of all Zins. This ends up making an incredibly expensive cranberry sauce, but it is absolutely delicious, and I generally don't like cranberry sauces.

This is the best sauce I've ever made and it is so easy. I'm with the other reviewer who believes that a Zin is too wimpy. A decent Cabernet or Shiraz works better, gives the sauce a fuller flavor. Use the leftovers to make Margaritas. Add a cup of the cranberry sauce to your normal recipe and decrease the lime juice by half. Everybody loved both the Margaritas and the sauce.

This is hands-down the best cranberry sauce I've had in my 1/2 century of life. This has been our go-to for six years. Even tho I'm a recipe "tinkerer", I make it just as stated, it's wonderful.

An excellent cranberry sauce recipe! Will be a repeat with the Christmas goose. Our German guests liked it as well - the spices are reminicent of holiday punch "Gluehwein". I have to echo many other posters and say: make well in advance to allow the flavors to develop.

Rating: 4
This is the cranberry sauce everyone not only tolerates but actually looks forward to. Flavor improves dramatically after a few days so make it ahead of time. I used about 2/3 of each sugar and that was perfect. It's also a good way to use up hardened brown sugar, as it dissolves instantly in the hot sauce. I tripled the recipe. Let it simmer off for a while so that it's not too liquidy.

Rating: 4
I was skeptical about the nearly unanimous rave reviews but I'm totally won over. I made it two days ahead to let the flavors meld and used 3/4 cup of each sugar - it was still plenty sweet. Might add a few peppercorns the next time to amp up that side of the Zinfandel. A new holiday tradition!

This was such a hit at the Thnaksgiving table and now I've been asked to prepare this dish for a family gathering in January.

like other reviewers, this has become a staple for our thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. I always make a double recipe but keep the sugars at the single recipe amounts. I've used different red wines and all are good but the Zin is still my favorite. Last year I even tried it with Port and everyone loved it, if you are going to try this, use a bit less because of the strong flavor of the Port. Freezes wonderfully which means you only have to make it once for both holidays. Absolutely the best cranberry sauce I've made!!!

Excellent cranberry sauce. My family loved it. It was an delicious side dish as well as a dessert. My father was eating it on ice cream, eating it with whipped cream, and eating it plain. It was a big hit. I cut the sugar down to 3/4 c. brown and 1/2 c. white and it was a good balance of sweet and tart. This will be added to my collection of recipes.

Rating: 4
This is, hands down, the best cranberry sauce EVER. I've been making it since it was first published, and even people who normally shun cranberry sauce dive in for seconds and thirds. To say that this gets rave reviews is a vast understatement. Be sure to use a good Zinfandel, as the quality and flavor of the wine has a huge effect on the outcome of your sauce. And make lots -- you'll need it!

I've been making this for years now, and friends even request it as a gift! We've served it as a dessert sauce, too, on ice cream or pound cake. It is the best use for cranberries I've ever come across!!! (DO cut down on the sugar--3/4 cups of each is plenty!)

Rating: 4
Fantastic! Just give it time to mature. I found that the cloves were too strong and the cranberries were too tart the first night, but it's perfect after aging for three or four days. I made a second, double batch for the office Christmas party, and though it got many compliments and second helpings, it was not at its peak as I made it only a day before. Make it in advance and let it rest, covered, in the fridge for a few days. I used a Ravenswood zinfandel and modified the recipe as follows: I cut both sugars in half, added 1/4 C honey, cut a quarter slice of an orange and cooked it whole in lieu of the peel or zest, and added half a red d'anjou pear, sliced. Absolutely fabulous. The wine and fruit flavors give it an amazing depth. My wife couldn't get enough, and my dad ate the entire container I gave him sans turkey. I'll be making this every year from now on.

Rating: 4
I love experimenting for Thanksgiving, but this is one of the recipes that has become a regular for me - it's GREAT. The only way in which I have modified the recipe is to add a few peppercorns while cooking the sauce. It adds a bit more kick and compliments the wine. Speaking of which, if you don't have any zin at home, I highly recommend getting out and buying it! For me, part of its appeal for this recipe is the fact that pepper tends to be one of its definitive flavors. It really is the perfect wine for this sauce.

Served this to a family of wine-lovers over Thanksgiving, and they thought it was delicious. I also took previous reviewers' advice to cut the sugar down a little bit, and may cut down even more next time. I was somewhat confused when the dish was supposed to be done and there were a lot of seemingly whole cranberries left, just sitting in the liquid. I didn't think anyone would want to bite into one of those, so I just put the whole thing in the food processor for a couple of pulses and it was perfect after that.

If you have little time to prepare for Thanksgiving, maybe you can save some time by doing what I always wanted to do: I made this up a month ahead of time and froze it. TGiving morning I defrosted it, and then I frose it again, added some grated fresh orange rind and it was good to go. Even more delicious, thanks to the seasoning it got in the freezer. This is the best cranberry sauce in my mouth at the moment!

This was a great recipe. I didn't have a Zin in the house so I used a Cab. It was great, but I'm looking forward to trying it with a Zin and refrigerating for a couple days. I also found it took longer to reduce than recipe states, and I also turned up a heat a bit to get the reducing going.

This will become a fall staple in our home. Due to other reviews I cut the sugars down to 3/4 cup each and I think this enhanced the flavors greatly. I also reduced the "syrup" for 5 minutes longer than stated and then added the cranberries. This produced a great tasting and great consistancy cranberry sauce. My husband couldn't wait until the following day so that he could put the sauce on his turkey sandwich.

Made this Wednesday and allowed flavors to thoroughly develop overnight. I used a very nice Zinfandel which my husband enjoyed finishing off after I did the cooking. It was outstanding! Flavors were rich,deep, and well balanced. My berries stayed mostly intact which gave it a great visual appeal also. I think it would also be a great addition to pork loin or chops. I will be repeating this often.

This was delicious. I cooked it down forever, but it never really thickened. That turned out to be a good thing - the morning after t-day I made pancakes, scooped out the berries and dropped them in the pancakes and used the warmed-up sauce as syrup. So good - the magazine should steal this idea for next year's edition.

Rating: 4
Wonderful!! This was a big success for our traditional Thanksgiving meal, despite my husband's usual polite "no thanks" he normally gives to cranberry sauce. Based on previous reviewers, I cut both sugars in half, which made a tart but tasty sauce. The zin adds depth to the flavors, and the spices come through without overpowering the berries. Everyone in this household LOVED the sauce, it was a perfect complement to the meal. This is a keeper for us.

I made this today and i think it's going to upstage the turkey tomorrow! Many thanks to aslone from Los Angeles for suggesting only half the sugar be used. Even then it was a little sweet.

A friend brought this to Thanksgiving last year and it was amazing! To be fair, I also love zin, but beyond that, it was fantastic. I'll be making this myself this year as said friend has since moved, but she passed on the recipe to me, for which I thank her sincerely. You won't be sorry if you go with this one! It is spicy and flavorful, really an excellent complement to turkey and other poultry.

I have never liked cranberry sauce and resisted adding it to my Thanksgiving menu for years. I liked the sound of this one last year and ended up making it for two Christmas parties and Christmas dinner as well. After being served canned cranberry sauce forever I never even suspected cranberry sauce could be this good. By the time Christmas rolled around I was making a 4x batch because everyone wanted to take home what little was left over! Incredibly simple, I use prepackaged mulling spices, threw it on the stove top and went about the rest of my meal preparations. I would sooner leave turkey off my Thanksgiving menu before I left this off. Quite possibly the best receipe I have ever gotten anywhere.

Of all the recipies I've tried on this website (and most were fabulous!) this is far and away the one I make most and love best. It's easy (though it takes a bit of time to reduce down, but so what!?-you can do something else while you're waiting), different, and tastes phenominal! My family won't even touch the standard sauces any more, and I usually have to make a double batch-at least! This sauce goes with many different dishes, as other reviewers have mentioned.Try it with pork tenderloin, and of course, with the best part of Thanksgiving-the turkey sandwitch. Essentially you are making a mulled wine in which the cranberries are cooked, for those of you cruising the recipie files. If you like your sauce thinner, let it cook for the recommended time (it will thicken a bit as it stands). Like a thicker sauce-cook it longer. Don't have Zin? Use another hearty red wine (this a great way to use up less than stellar bottles of red wine that you have hanging around, since you'll be doctoring it up with spices.) If you happened to receive a bag of premixed mulling spices in your stocking, and aren't sure what to do with them, use them here. Be forwarned-this recipe uses almost a full bottle of vino-just enough for the cook to have glass. This recipe is the BOMB-try it!!

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe every Thanksgiving since it was published many years ago. My mother requests this sauce every year. I do find that the sauce needs to simmer for a longer time than the recipe indicates in order to firm-up properly. Here's a hint - freeze a bag of cranberries and make this in the late winter when you'd like something spicy and delicious to compliment a roast chicken.

easy and fun to make. zin is a perfect fit for this. however, it has a very strong wine taste, it's not a "background note"; if you don't like red wine, this isn't the sauce for you. if you like red zin, this is heaven.

This was delicious and I have to make myself put it away so I would not eat it all before tomorrow. My husband who does not like cranberry sauce said it was great! I did not have whole cloves,allspice or cinnamon sticks so I used 1/8 teaspoon of each. I used 1/2 cup each of the sugars and 1 cup of an Hawaiian Pineapple Wine and 3/4c of water. I did not have any problems with it reducing. It reduced to 1 3/4c in 10 minutes.PERFECT DO TRY THIS ONE

I used a good Zinfandel that I was happy to drink what remained. It took 40 minutes to reduce, maybe less if I hadn't periodically removed from heat to measure, in a 2qt sauce pan. Otherwise, went very smoothly and made the house smell wonderful. After cooling a bit, I zested the rest of the orange into it. This tastes great, like it should be a pie filling, and the effort was minimal. Can't wait to serve on Thanksgiving. I give a 3.5.

Because I live in Minnesota where the liquor stores are closed on Sunday, I had to make this with a Merlot as it was all I had on hand. When I tasted the sauce right away I thought it was too sweet, but after it sat in the refrigerator for 4 or 5 hours I tasted it again and it was much better. While I have yet to serve this to company and get their reaction, I think it is delicious. My sauce did not reduce to 1 3/4 C in the time mentioned, but since I had already poured it out of the pan and into the measuring cup, I went with it instead of continuing to reduce (I had 2 C after 10 minutes.)

Every year, I have to hide this from my husband so there will be some left to serve with Thanksgiving dinner. It's excellent. If I remember correctly, I have to boil it quite a bit longer than the recipe states to get the desired consistency, but it's well worth the wait.

We've made this many times since it appeared in the magazine and loved it every time. This year, we didn't have any zinfandel at home, so I used the remains of a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon that we hadn't been able to finish the night before. It's also excellent with the cab. After 2 years in a row having this cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving, I can't imagine a turkey meal without it!

Forgot to get allspice berries and I used pinot noir instead of zinfandel (wasn't paying enough attention in the store!!) The resulting sauce was VERY sweet, but I did like the pinot noir.

This was very good, but next time I will make a few small changes to make it even better. Instead of 1 3/4 cups wine, I will use 1 cup wine and 3/4 cup water, as the wine flavor was a bit overwhelming for my taste. Also, I will add a bit of freshly grated orange rind at the end of cooking. Nice change from the typical cranberry relish!

Wonderful! I didn't have any oranges around so I substituted all of the spices and orange with a small handful of Williams-Sonoma mulling spices (has orange peel in it) Even my "I hate cranberries" guests had to concede that it is wonderful.

Everyone that likes cranberries loved it. It was really easy to make. My 3 yr old daughter ate as if it was candy.

Okay - I thought this recipe was really good, but since it was the right time of year, I substituted Nouveau Beaujolais for Zinfandel - it gave it a wonderful juiciness. I also cut back a little on the sugar. I'm going to make it again for Christmas because everybody loved it.

I loved the spicy taste of this cranberry sauce, but it was way too sweet. I had to add the juice of a whole lemon to cut the sweetness (which did add a nice, tart complement to the dish). I will make this again, but will only use half the sugar indicated in the recipe.

This was the best cranberry sauce ever, full of flavor and soooo easy! I served it for Thanksgiving and even the hard to please guests loved it. This recipe has now been added to the annual Thanksgiving menu as a must. I wouldn't make one change!

Excellent and easy. I loved the spicyness and the hint of orange. I spooned the sauce straight from the bowl into my mouth all weekend! YUM.

This is the best cranberry sauce I've ever had. Even my husband, who dislikes cranberries, liked this dish. My daughter-in-law's mother brought this dish to Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a hit! I couldn't wait to get online to obtain the recipe.

This cranberry sauce is just the best--and quite simple to make. I didn't reduce it all the way, but everything turned out wonderfully, and am now printing out copies of the recipe for my family and friends.

Great! Used cabernet instead of zinfandel, made the sauce several days before Thanksgiving and removed the orange peel just before serving. Gave the sauce a nice orange taste

What a lovely surprise! I think that the Zinfandel was a wonderful companion to the cranberries and gave the sauce a rich flavor. My relatives couldn't get enough of the sauce; even the picky, "non-cranberry lovers" were raving. For my palate, I thought that maybe the spices were just a bit much for the sauce, especially one to be served with turkey. I might cut the spices in half to begin with and then increase if needed. In addition, I'd like to see a bit more orange flavor. Maybe my peels werent great. I might grate the zest next time instead of using the thick strips of peel. Also, I wouldn't recommend reducing the syrup longer. At first it seemed like the sauce was very runny, but once I refrigerated it it set up very nicely and I think it had a perfect consistency.

Nothing short of FANTASTIC describes this sauce. My husband is the cranberry sauce fan in our house and he is the one in charge of picking the recipe and making it each year (he enjoys trying different variations). He insists this is IT, the recipe from now on. And I, who am not a big fan of cranberry sauce on my meat, also loved it. He followed the recipe to the "T" but used ground allspice instead of whole. You will love this cranberry sauce!

I changed some of the ingredients because I did not have some things on hand at our desert house. Champagne, leftover, for Zinfandel; orange juice for orange peel, and ground cloves, allspice and cinnamon replaced whole spices. We all loved the finished result. I am anxious to try it with Zinfandel, but may just stick to Champagne.

I found this recipe in Bon Appetit and thought it sounded great. I tasted it just prior to putting in the fridge to cool it off and it was the best I've ever had. Then after it cooled, it was even better. I too used grated orange rind due to not being able to find the oranges I had bought for that purpose, and it was still fantastic. This is one recipe I'll definitely be making again.

This is the best cranberry sauce I've ever made! We haven't even sat down with our turkey yet, and we've been eating it with spoons. One change I would make, though, is to reduce the syrup further than called for in the recipe. Also, I used grated zest which worked fine. We'll definitely have this again, and I think I will try it with pork.

Had several to pick from and just by luck I decided on this one. Definitely one that I would make again. Wine definitely enhanced the flavor of the sauce. I just wish I would have doubled the recipe.
