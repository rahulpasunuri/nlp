making this right now for my husband and kids, who all love hoisin sauce. using onion and bok choy instead of leeks and spring peas. My chunk of pork tenderloin may be closer to 1.5 pounds -- I needed a good 20 minutes more roasting time than indicated. The BBQ sauce is so great -- next time, i'll pre-roast pork for 20 minutes, then baste with sauce and continue for 25 minutes more, so as not to scorch the glaze.

To the Cook from Singapore (am a singaporean chinese too, like you), using rice that's cooked the day before is a matter of climate. if you are living in somewhere with 12C or so, you could actually cook the rice several hours before & put it in the balcony to cool. Also, rice from the refrigerator should not be used immediately but be cooled or brought to "thaw" first. When cold fridge-rice is used WITHOUT "thawing", the rice will become very hard & crispy - certainly not the desired texture of rice for any type of fried rice.

I'm Chinese and tatally agree with using day-old rice. Been using it for as long as I've cooked fried rice! The reason behind this is that day-old rice isn't as soft & mushy as freshly cooked rice. It remains as whole grains when fried together with the rest of the ingredients, allowing distinct flavours, rather than a whole blob of "rice balls"!

Very easy and tasteful recipe. You can add some extra vegetables if you like, for instance bok choy, carrots or mushrooms to make it a bit more substantial. Definitely a keeper for me!

This is OK - it's very bland though. I wouldn't make it again - just serve the bbq pork (which is great) with rice and some stir fried veggies.

Fellow Eaters: Here is the gift I give to all of you with much gladness, for in doing so I pass a carefull guarded Asian secret to killer fried rice: Here it is: STALE RICE! That is correct and I kid you not. Do the research just as I have. Day old rice is chewy. Like the way it gets in the big boys house fried rice! Try it! Enjoy! Stefano Manjano form Sonoma

Yum!!! We loved this recipe. Buying the barbecued pork from the store made this recipe very easy! You can even use a little less pork and still have the same great taste but less fat.

There has got to be a much more impressive pork fried rice dish out there! At the very least, this recipe requires many modifications.
