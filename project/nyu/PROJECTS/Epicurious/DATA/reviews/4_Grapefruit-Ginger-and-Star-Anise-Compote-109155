This has become a winter favorite in my household. A great way to use up a bumper crop of not-very-sweet grapefruit from our yard. Also a wonderful gluten-free treat (if you're looking for something in that vein). I serve it with creme fraiche: yum! I found cutting the grapefruit to be a huge pain, so now I just slice them in half as if I were going to eat them for breakfast & use a grapefruit knife to carve out membrane-free sections. The pieces are smaller, but the compote looks just as pretty & tastes just as good -- and it takes a fraction of the time.

I thought this was fantastic. Grapefruit has a tendency to be bitter. The syrup is sweet enough to balance out of the grapefruit but not so sweet to be cloying. The star anise and ginger are great flavors with the grapefruit.

Disappointing!!! Uck, I had so high hopes! I love the syrup it made, but it just did not seem to complement the organic grapefruit the way I hoped it would. The grapefruit was less sweet than I prefer, so I thought syrup would be perect right - what is sweeter than syrup. I also made a gingerbread cake with orange-cream cheese icing to go along. The syrup was great with the cake - but the grapefruit - not so much, and the grapefruit did have a great tart flavor beforehand. Oh welllll, at least it is healthy! Maybe it will taste better chilled.

wow - so simple but really, really good. Delicious on its own or over frozen yogurt. I will definitely make it again. I envision topping a simple cake with it!

Great over ice cream or frozen yogurt for dessert. Even better over plain yogurt for breakfast.

I didn't actually make this recipe but had it for dinner at my Dad's and it was awesome. I absolutely loved it! I can't wait to try it myself. He said it was easy to make and it went great as a light dessert with the Thai Shrimp Curry from the same month. I think it will soon be a regular in my repartoire.
