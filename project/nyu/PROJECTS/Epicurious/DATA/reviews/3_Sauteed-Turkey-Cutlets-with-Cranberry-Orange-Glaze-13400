The thin-sliced battered turkey cutlets were delicious. For the sauce, I used canned cranberry sauce, and instead of orange zest used cinnamon and cardamom. Deeeelicious (if only because we were out of orange zest). And very quick and easy.

Great dish. I used brown sugar splenda and it was great! Also used panko to make it crunchy! I also doubled the amount of sauce.

This recipe is good, but the addition of dried cranberries to the sauce adds texture and flavor. I also like to add the juice from the orange to this sauce to give it more depth. This recipe was Copyrighted in 1998 by the United States Personal Chef Association. Wonders never cease.

I looked up this recipe to e-mail a copy to my sister. I was amazed at the poor ratings. I make this dish regularly. It is my daughter's favorite dinner. Lo-cal and easy - a quick week night meal.

I haven't tried this recipe. I found it while doing a search. I do wonder, however, how one pounds a 1/4 inch cutlet to 1/3 inch????

This tasted pretty good, and was easy to make, but the presentation was awfully plain. (Like cranberry juice drizzled on fried turkey! What a surprise!) For some reason I expected more flair, if I did it again I'd just use canned cranberry sauce instead of juice, making a hot cranberry sauce, giving it more eye-appeal.
