I've made this recipe twice in the last two days. The first time the chocolate mixture was too cool when I added the whipped cream. The mousse was very dense and had flecks of chocolate throughout. The second time I added whipped cream to luke-warm chocolate and the texture was light and airy. It's important to lighten the mixtures before folding the ingredients in and I think it is better to add the egg mixture to the chocolate mixture rather than vice versa. You usually add the lighter mixture to the denser mixture when combining ingredients. Both versions were delicious, but I preferred the denser mousse.

You know a recipe is good when your minister declares it "orgasmic"! I used a mini-muffin pan, which was the perfect size. I (accidentally) left out the Frangelico, but the recipe didn't suffer for it. I topped them with a raspberry. A mint leaf would be good, too. Like other cooks I had trouble getting them out of the liners but I think that was more the liners that I used than anything else - will try a different type next time.

Loved this recipe! I made them for a dinner party and they were a huge hit. I did struggle a bit getting the chocolate cups out of the muffin liners, but quickly figured it out.

IMPORTANT NEWS!!! Made this once before and really had a tough time getting the chocolate shells out of the paper liners. Not this time!!! On a whim, had bought some unbleached cupcake liners and, when comparing them to the regular liners noticed that they seemed a little waxier. Decided to use them and boy- howdy....was I ever glad I did. They came off the chocolate beautifully with not a single one breaking. Last time I had quite a few that looked so miserable I had to eat them myself. Poor me. Anywho... with my fabulous breakthrough I can now put this recipe into the "easy yet splashy" category. Oh, it's also very tasty! Try it, you'll like it.

Was a bit short on time so I omitted the chocolate cups and used wine glasses (Make them small- this is really rich!) I used Amarula instead of Frangelico and substituted some hazels with toasted pecans. Tasted wonderful and proved easy to make, though it was a bit runny and the nuts tended to settle at the bottom. (Had to guess here and there, though, about measurements, as no metric equivalents were given.)

Delicious, impressive recipe. The mousse has a very good taste and texture. The chocolate cups are a unique and fun twist, but can be tricky to make. Be careful peeling the paper liners from the chocolate cups, as they might break or become a bit misshaped. I recommend keeping each individual cup in the freezer until you're ready to peel it, as it becomes more difficult once they're at room temperature.

I followed the suggestion to use mini-muffin cups, and thought the size was great. This was a yummy dessert with nice presentation - pretty easy to make and hard to resist!

Very easy to make. The chocolate cups were a snap to make but they were so hard when served that it was difficult to eat them. Next time I will let them stand at room temperature for awhile before serving. The chocolate mousse was yummy and piping it into the chocolate cups made a nice presentation. Next time I might look for cups smaller than cupcake size, since (I never thought I would ever say this but) it is almost too much chocolate.

I think this is wonderful and VERY easy. The one comment made stating it was difficult, probably cooked the egg mixture too long. It states that it serves 10, I stretched it to 20 and it was still very generous servings as it is so rich. I skipped the nuts and topped with whipped cream.

This recipe wasn't as easy as everyone said it was. To begin with, the chocolate/egg mixture did not mix well with the whipped cream because it had cooled down to a point where it solidified. Perhaps it was the chocolate that I used (Scharffen Berger Bittersweet)? I ended up with chocolate chunks in my mousse.

This dessert was so good I won a prize at my friend's birthday party! It was very easy to make and tastes great! I opted to forgo the hazelnuts and to make the cups out of white chocolate. (Yum!) Next time I make it, I would make one additional change by using mini-muffin cups so that the cups could be consumed in bite size portions.

Wow! This was delicious and easy to make. I chose to make it more difficult by painting the melted chocolate on balloons (make sure the chocolate has cooled or you have a HUGE mess on your hands), rolling the balloons in chopped toasted hazelnuts and then another layer of chocolate. Freeze the balloons and when the chocolate has hardened pop them. I left the hazelnuts out of the mousse.

This was a great recipe, I loved the idea of putting mousse in the cups, however, I substituted white chocolate for the chocolate. I piped in the white chocolate in the cups and made tiny chocolate leaves to stick in the mousse and topped the mousse with a fresh rasberry. They looked like little flowers.I served them on a plattter with raspberry sauce swirled on the platter. Everyone loved them.

Instead of muffin-sized paper cups, I used candy cups because the dessert is so sweet. It makes a great dish to take to holiday or office parties, etc.

Chocolate cups were a bit too thick, forced the mousse up my kids noses...

All guests enjoyed these mousse cups, although I thought it was a little too "chocolaty." Next time I would use 1/2 white chocolate with 1/2 semi-sweet for the filling AND/OR I would just spoon the filling into the cups, then pipe homemade whipped cream onto the top of each, as this would also cut the "chocolatyness." This recipe could have easily made 12 cups.
