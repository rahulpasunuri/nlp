I guess I just like the real thing - too bacony - not a real fried rice taste.

Excellent recipe--nicely seasoned. I add a beaten egg or two at the end of process. First, create well in rice/ingredients, add egg(s) and scramble, mixing into rice mixture. In cooking the rice, I wash the rice until the rince water becomes clearer; grains will be fluffy and separate upon cooking.

Pretty good. I used veggie bacon and veggie Worcestershire sauce. Nothing crazy special.

This is good - don't be tricked into thinking of is as an asian dish, though. The end result is a very western taste. I served it with teriyaki salmon and it didn't really match. It would probably be a good side for barbecued pork or chicken. Also, as many reviewers have noted, it's plenty salty, so go with low-sodium bacon if possible and for sure don't add extra soy sauce. Vegetables should be doubled.

Excellent! Nice & spicy but not overwhelming. Used a full can of water chestnuts. I would add more veggies next time I make it.

I have re-named this recipe "Super- Yummy Fried Rice". I know it's a hit when the kids actually EAT what I cook, so this is definitely a keeper!

Very tasty. Made the recipe as is and added small dice red peppers.

This is great for as easy as it is. I added chicken for protein and substituted brown rice for white.

I made this dish for a supper club, and it was okay. Nothing that special. Just an okay fried rice.

This is an easy recipe to make and is consistently good. I add frozen peas and/or sugar snap peas for a bit of color and flavor. My kids love it.

This dish was quick,easy and delicious. I reduced the amount of the soy, oyster and worschire sauce since I was worried it would be too salty and I didn't have anymore water chestnuts so I increased the amount of the other veggies. Great for any weekday night or for casual entertaining.

I liked the idea of this dish more than the outcome. Between the bacon, soy sauce, and oyster sauce, it was just too salty.

Wonderful -- added some cashews just before serving.

I have made this recipe several times, whenever having friends over for an Asian-inspired meal. It always wins rave reviews. At the end I adjust the seasoning by adding more oyster or soy sauce (depending on how much the rice has absorbed) and it hasn't failed me yet.

We loved it. Big hit with my husband. I didn't have scallions or chestnuts and it came out very tasty anyway! Make sure to chop the veggies really fine.

This is the best stir fried rice I have ever had! Forgot going to Panda Express or whatever chinese place you like, just stay home and make this! Add some egg and do beware of the cayenne pepper.

Well, I'm sorry but I found this extremely bland and boring. I loved the sound of it and had high hopes but it was very disappointing. I won't make this again.

Added the egg & what I had in the fridge & on the shelf. Best stir fried rice I've made at home. It's gotta be the sauce. Excellent!!

I also added egg. And whatever I had in the fridge - mushrooms, peppers... turned out great.

Looking for a delicious side dish? Look no further. This is it! I didn't have celery in the refrigerator, so I substituted small chunks of sweet red pepper. Turned out very, very well; with rave reviews. One word of warning however.......don't overdo the cayenne. This dish turned out pretty spicy at the levels I used (couple of generous dashes). I think that I will back off on the cayenne a bit next time.

This dish was a lot of chopping for rice. It was absolutely delicious, and I will definitely make it again. I love the mix of ingredients - the texture is very nice. Just prepare to be chopping for a long time.

This was excellent!! I added egg as well.

Great side dish that is hearty enough to be the main course. I used some extra bacon and drained the fat. I also added some fresh ginger. Next time I will use the full can of water chestnuts.

Simple, attractive, and great tasting! Substituting different veggies makes this dish always interesting.

Needs a little more soy sauce, otherwise, my family loves this dish.

Absolutely wonderful. I added some egg and extra green onion. Also went well w/ the mongolian beef we prepared. Will definitely make it again soon.

Excellent! It got rave reviews at a recent dinner party. I served it with Chicken, Shrimp, and Beef Sates with Peanut Sauce. I was able to make it right before guests came and let it sit in the pan on the stove and then rewarmed it for dinner time.

I could live off of this dish!! My husband liked it a lot too. I didn't change a thing in the recipe, but next time I'm going to add some fresh peas. This is delicious!!

My family loved this fried rice recipe. Be careful on the cayenne and black pepper or it will be too hot with pepper! I agree, the bacon makes this dish flavorful and so does the veggies! Goes great with the Beef and Broccoli Stir-Fry dish!

Beyond compare may be a bit much, but we certainly enjoyed the rice! The bacon is the key. Delicious.
