I sauted my garlic and onions and two stalks of celery before adding to the meat. The first time I made it I did not saute the onions first and found them slightly undercooked and a bit crunchy. This is even better the next day used on a sandwich of fresh sourdough bread - yum!

Excellent! It seemed a little weird at first, since I've only recently started branching out my meatloaf repertoire, but even my husband that hates onions didn't pick them out! One tip though - the mustard that goes on top? Make it a sauce instead of just the mustard alone. I put the mustard into a small bowl, added a couple splashes of [fish and chip] vinegar and tiny bit of the cajun seasoning, tasted, and then added some [Choulula] hot sauce to kick up the heat a little. It made the mustard spreadable, and gave it good flavor!

way too much spice!

I found this very tasty, even though I am a meatloaf-leery person. My husband enjoyed it too. I used 93/7 turkey, a whole egg, and quick oats instead of bread crumbs. It was moist and flavorful. Next time, I'll reduce the cajun seasoning a bit (the dish was slightly too salty). Definitely use only a medium onion. I stopped short of putting all of my large chopped onion in, and I'm glad! We'll make this again for sure.

I modified this with the items I had on hand / liked better. Other than being a little too salty (I would cut the Tony Chachere's by about half) I thought this was a great meatloaf. I agree with the other reviewers that I could not tell the difference between this and regular meatloaf. Changes I made: Since I only had the pre-packed 1 lb. of ground turkey I cut the rest of the items by 1/3 to maintain the right consistency (e.g., used 2/3 of an onion). Other than that, I also (1) used a whole egg, (2) left out the cumin - because I hate cumin, and (3) threw maybe 1/4 cup of leftover Provel cheese. So, not as low-fat as the original but very tasty!

This was a great recipe! I did add about 1/2 lb low fat turkey sausage because I didn't have whole amount of ground turkey, added the egg yolk & did not top with mustard. Was terrific cold the next day as well. A nice, warm spicy flavor and good firm texture.

My husband and I are trying to cut back on red meat and this was great! He loved it and ate all of the leftovers, which never happens. It was tasty and a bit spicy. Very good.

Hi I forgot to add that I omitted the cajun seasoning and just used a garlic pepper crush with one garlic clove for the seasoning, three cloves would have been too much

Hi All I made this as mini meatloaves. I used a whole egg. I sauteed chopped onions before I added the small onion in. The other thing I did was to coat all sides of my mini loaf pan with a mix of ketchup and brown sugar and also coat the top. My husband swore it was beef. The only downside : He swore the topping was so delicious that he scraped the pan- unfortuantely I call him steel fingers now- he scraped it with a metal spoon. I hope he did not eat the coating. He wants me to make it all the time now and promises to use a plastic/non-stick spook. Happy and Sad.

Pretty good as shown, but better with a few additions. Added 2 chopped green onion, 1/4 c chopped roasted red peppers, 2 tb chopped green chile. Delicious!

Great dish for nonbeef lovers. Just make sure not to get 99% fat free turkey. You need a little fat for the moistness!

Very easy and really good! Sauteed a small onion and used ketchup/brown sugar glaze instead of mustard. I even forgot the thyme and we still thought it was great!

We took other reviewers suggestions and used a small onion, we cooked the onion and garlic in olive oil before adding it the mixture and we also purchased a fancier dijon mustard to put on top. The first time we made it we did not eat it as traditional meatloaf and cut it up into sandwiches for a road trip with another couple, that worked out really well and they enjoyed it very much, we have continued to make it for dinners too. It is quick, easy and tasty - I would suggest trying it.

This is the first recipe out of about 50 that I will not be making again. I think it should be called "ONION Turkey Cajun Meatloaf". Maybe my onion was extra, extra large, but I highly suggest using a small onion.

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe quite a few times, because I always tend to screw up traditional meatloaf, and it comes out fantastic every time. if you want a new twist, replace the mustard and make a 'glaze' of katsup and brown sugar. I swear it was ground beef

I was disappointed, i had high hopes for a tasty low-fat meatloaf in the end it did not have a lot of flavor. I followed the recipe exactly except i used a whole egg and had to add another 1/2 lb of meat becuase my whole onion was too large.

I've made this three times now, and thought it was tasty and delicious each time - used suggestions from other reviewers and used a whole egg, less cajun spice, dumped a can of diced tomatoes on top while it cooks. I've also done other little variations like mix in mustard with the whole thing. My husband and I love it, and it DOES make great sandwiches the next day (if you have any leftover...)

My husband and children usually won't eat meatloaf. I made this recipe and they loved it. There were no leftovers. I eliminated the breadcrumbs and eggs for health reasons and it still came out good.

All the cajun spices don't make up for the bland turkey. My husband loves any kind of meatloaf....and even he asked me not to make it again.

This is o.k., but the BA July 1998 "Cajun-spiced Meat Loaf" on page 22 is ten times better. They don't have it posted for some reason, but dig it out if you keep your mags and try it. I adjust the fat down by using a mix of lowfat turkey and beef and it is amazing....

Very flavorful, especially when you consider how healthy it is. My husband doesn't like meatloaf, but gives it double-thumbs up. It is "spicy" but far from too spicy.

Too spicy? Sheez, I would hate to see what your idea of mild is...

This is a great alternative for us non-pork and non-beef eaters. I modified the recipe,as the other reviewer did...less garlic, less cajun seasoning and I hate mustard, so I used turkey gravy to top it off. I also added cayenne pepper because I love hot food. My family loved it! There were no leftovers.

This meatloaf was delicious! As a midwesterner in Puerto Rico, I like to make dishes that remind me of home. But heavily spiced meats are more common here than in the midwest, and it was a big success.

I also made a few minor changes to this recipe (added more bread crumbs, used half an onion and sauted it first, went easy on the cajun spice), but my friends and I love it! It's the best meatloaf any of us have had. And it's even better the next day in a meat loaf sandwich on focaccia bread!

This is not something my family enjoyed... I would have to agree with the above reviewers : too spicy.

I thought it was interesting to make, but it wasn't a crowd pleaser. My 10 year-old hated it (too spicy) and my husband thought it had way too much garlic (indeed, 3 large cloves may be a bit much). With little adjustments, I think however it could work.

If you're searching for a great turkey meatloaf recipe, try the one in The Barefoot Contessa cookbook.

This was delicious, with a few substitions and changes. I used four slices of whole grain wheat bread for the bread crumbs, 1 whole egg (not just the white), cilantro , and half a chopped onion. I added a little Crystal hot sauce and went easy on the creole seasoning. Instead of putting the mustard on, I dumped a can of diced tomatoes with basil and oregano on top of it and around it. I cooked it for a good hour, and it came out very tasty and filling!

I am very sorry I wasted my time and money on this recipe. My husband actually ran to the trash can to spit it out and I could only stomach two bites of it. Between the spices and the mustard it is overwhelming. Just rename this recipe "Cajun Spice with a side of ground turkey". Just awful!!

The meatloaf was very good. I used just over 2 pounds of turkey but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It was great, neither too salty or spicy. It satisfied even my pickiest of eaters.

This is the worst meatloaf I have ever had. I sounds really good on paper, but the onion was absolutely overwhelming, the turkey doesn't stick together well (no fat) and the whole thing just really tasted nasty. You can't even taste the chili sauce, all you taste is onion. I am going to stick to full-fat meatloaf from now on!

It was a very tasty meatloaf, but as others have stated, it could be a little salty. So I just cut down on the cajun spice (Bruci's Blend) a little and added a little cayenne and it came out very delicious and not salty.

I used a creole seasoning recipe I downloaded from the web (did not contain any salt) and spicy brown mustard. The family loved it!

I followed the proportions of the recipe exactly, and the meatloaf came out very salty. If I tried again, I would use much less of the creole seasoning (I used Konriko brand Hot 'n Spicy Creole Seasoning).

Other members mentioned the dish ended up too salty. I use Konriks brand cajun seasoning and in this dish I used one tablespoon of it and it worked well.

We used a cajun spice that contained a lot of salt and the loaf was horrendous - basically a loaf of salted meat. We actually had to throw it away. I'd try this recipe one more time with a spice that contains A LOT less salt.

Be sure to use ground turkey BREAST if you can find it; some of the other ground turkey products can leave a pretty significant birdy taste...

I agree that the Cajun/Creole seasoning can be too much, depending on the brand you use --- some are hotter tha others. I added some salsa. Quite yummy.

I nearly choked to death when I added the creole powder and there was just something about the flavor that just didn't sit to well. I'm not sure if it was the mustard or the seasoning but it was just overpowering.

I make this lowfat meat loaf about once a month and freeze slices to eat later. It is great. I have used a nice hot sauce in place of the mustard or on top of the mustard.

Quick and easy assembly. I recommend mincing the garlic to spread the flavor and adding a tablespoon each of lemon and honey to the mustard to enhance the finish.
