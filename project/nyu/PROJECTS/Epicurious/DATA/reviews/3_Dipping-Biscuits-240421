My husband and I really liked them. We prefer the whole wheat taste and healthfulness. Of course, there's a LOT of butter in them. I used only dried sage from my garden. I served them with soup. I'll make them again when I think my coronary arteries can stand it.

I found these biscuits very dry. Truely useful only if smothered in gravy.

We all loved these. Especially liked that they were made with more healthful whole wheat flour. I used fresh herbs and therefore doubled the quantity called for if using dried herbs. A keeper for sure.

They were bad little biscuits...

Ugh. Shoulda gone with Pillsbury. :-) These were okay, but nothing special on their own. If smothered in turke gravy, cranberry sauce, etc. they're not bad. But, on their own they're just doughy dry little doorstops, and the spices just make them taste.... I don't know... musty. Too much of the same herbs as were used for the turkey, I guess.

It is very good!!! It's very flaky and soft. I made this to go with corn chowder and other creamy soups. They were excellent. I will keep this recipe for sure!!
