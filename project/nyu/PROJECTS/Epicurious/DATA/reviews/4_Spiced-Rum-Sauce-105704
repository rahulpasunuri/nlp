Yes, excellent sauce that can be used for a number of dishes. Very easy recipe. I used half and half instead of heavy cream with success. I used half the cinnamon and added a dash of nutmeg. I also added a drop of vanilla. I used Myers Dark Rum.

This sauce is amazing! Very quick and easy, it reminded me of some butter rum pretzels that we get every year at Oktoberfest. It was great on our bread pudding, pies and ice cream! PERFECT!

This is awesome!!! Very delicious. I will definatelty make it again. Read the other reviews and made the following modifications: cut sugar back to 1/2 cup. Perfect sweetness for me. You can always gradually add more after adding the cream if you want it sweeter. Added 1/4 of rum as with the cinnamon, the 2 tbsp of rum could not be tasted. This was the perfect combo for me.

This is just fabulous. Made with cinnamon stick instead of ground, was easy and quick. Served with chocolate bundt cake to rave reviews, so made a 10 times batch and gave away as Christmas gifts.

This was fantastic! I used Appleton Rum not spiced but proper Jamaican rum. I served it with toasted honey pound cake and fresh berries. Everyone wanted seconds. It was fabulous!

This tasted like a hot buttered rum without alcohol. The word "rum" in the name made it less of a hit at my church function, but those who tasted it were in love. I took the extra home, heated it, added water and rum, and had a hot buttered rum. Yummy. The only issue was that the cinnamon got swollen, grainy, and clumped. I would probably use a cinnamon stick instead next time, or add the cinnamon at the end.

Orgasmic. With this collection of ingredients, difficult to miss. Added a hint of cardoman for fun.

Excellent taste and simple to make. A versatile sauce. This was great on the bread pudding and the leftover amt was used the next day on vanilla ice cream.

Holy moly, this was good! I served it over a bread pudding from my Galatoire's Restaurant cookbook, and it was divine! I can imagine that it would be good with just vanilla ice cream, too.

Notice that the only negative review was a cook that changed the recipe

I love this sauce. It will seperate a little beacuse of the butter, but if you just reheat it and stir it will be back to it's "just made" state.

I can't give it 4 forks...but it was very very good. I added chocolate chips per another suggestion and thought that really added to the layers of flavor. I bought some ice cream to go with it, but forgot to serve it. I will make this again and try to tweak it a little more (and will not forget to serve the ice cream!)

What a great sauce -- yummy, easy, few ingredients, quick! I made bread pudding using an apple crumble bread from a local bakery, and a recipe from a Paul Prudhomme cookbook. This sauce was perfect with it. Can't wait to have the leftovers tonight.

This sauce was the perfect compliment to the bread pudding. I made it last night and everyone raved about it. I would definitely make it again.
