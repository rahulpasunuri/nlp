I just made this tonight and it was fabulous! Mine turned out a tan colour, not light as others had mentioned. You have to let the butter turn brown but also, make sure to caramelize the brown sugar. It's hard to tell when the sugar is brown to start off, but should see whisps of smoke and smell the caramel, and when you add the milk/cream, you'll see lots of bubbling, sputtering. Will definitely make again. A new favorite!

This was easy and delicious. The only thing I did different was to cook the pudding in a double boiler after it was added to the egg yolk mixture. This eliminated the need for a blender. I've always cooked cornstarch puddings in the double boiler and they are always as a result smooth as silk. I'm looking forward to serving this to a women's group tomorrow night. Thanks for an easy and fast dessert that could be made ahead of time. I love the tiny vanilla seeds in it.

My second rendition of this pudding yielded spectacular results. My tweaks: Instead of browning the butter with the vanilla bean and its seeds, it was far easier for me to see the progress of the butter, by browning it alone. More than likely I underbrowned the butter the first time out as I couldn't distinguish it from the vanilla seeds. I added the vanilla bean and scraped insides with the milk mixture. My first rendition yielded a very smooth pudding, but I found it too thick. This time I used 3 tablespoons of cornstarch (24 grams), instead of 1/4 cup. I used an immersion blender for the last step, and tapped my bowl gently onto on my counter top to remove air bubbles. In a word? FABULOUS! Cheers all, Jeff

I just finished making this and I agree with the other review that it is light colored and lacks a butterscotch taste. Should it be made with dark brown sugar? Also, add another Tbsp of bourbon.

Just finished making this recipe. I agree with the other review that the color is very light and it lacks a butterscotch flavor. Maybe this should be made with dark brown sugar. Also, increase the bourbon to 2T.

This was a very easy recipe. I made exactly as described. I think I may not have browned the butter enough as mine has a very light color - not anything like close to the picture. I used my immersion blender and achieved a very smooth texture. My spouse said it tasted like eggnog. I would like to have had more of a butterscotch flavor but is very tasty.
