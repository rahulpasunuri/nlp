Just finished making this desert for an Easter brunch. Do not have the reviews yet, but with the way it smells and looks, I think it will be a hit. I doubled the recipe with fresh blackberries and was nervous that the dough would be extremely messy and was surprised that it was not, as others mentioned. It was very easy to make.

I thought this recipe was great! I used peach nectar instead of water and it came out nice and rich with just a hint of peach flavor. I definitely will keep this in my recipe box!

Extremely messy, but well worth it. Instead of using water for the syrup, I used the liquid from the thawed berries. Doubled the recipe and baked in a 9 x 13 pan. Will make this again and again.

I have made this a couple of times now and it is now requested from me. It is simply deliciously messy! I would definitely use frozen if you have them, even partially frozen is a little cleaner. But what great cook doesn't like getting a little messy?

I have not been able to find self- rising cake flour for 4 years. The substitute: 1 1/2 cups cake flour + 2 teaspoons baking powder + 3/4 teaspoon sea-salt. I know, I know, it's winter, but the organic blackberries in my Whole Foods have been simply outstanding. No changes - recipe stands as is (and yes, it is a messy dough). Compliments every single time.

Phenominal recipe - I've made it twice and my guests have raved. As far as rolling up the blackberries, you are really trying to make a blackberry tube - the sides don't have to come together (but it does make it a bit less messy) - I also brushed the exposed dough at the 45 minute mark with egg yoke and used large granual sugar - FANTASTIC!

My husband says not to tell his mother, but that this is the best cobbler recipe he has ever had. I rolled out the dough between sheets of parchment paper, helped the rolling out step as well as the "roll up jelly roll style" step. I also did not thaw the berries; I think it made it not quite as messy when rolling/slicing. Contrary to what other said, I thought the syrup ratio was perfect. I will definitely make this again, trying it with peaches.

If you are looking for cobbler recipes, I highly recommend taking the time to search out your grandmother's recipe. The crust on this one is all wrong.

I have made this recipe more times than I can count, and it is always perfect. I freeze blackberries in the summer, and just use them frozen; a little harder to slice, but less messy. A co-worker even requests this every year on her birthday in lieu of cake! Maybe "a cook from Ithaca" needs to prepare the recipe as written before rating it - apples are much too sweet for the amount of sugar, but blackberries are just right. Also - I use turbinado sugar on top instead of granulated; a much prettier presentation.

I followed a recommendation that apples would be good in these and used 1c apples and 2c blackberries. However, I must agree with the 'too sweet' coalition on this one. It is sickly sweet -- we tried to lessen the effect by drowning it in milk, but we were only partly successful and it made it soggy. Additionally, the dough was far too dry to roll up with any degree of success. I'll keep on looking for good blackberry recipes.

I made this last night. I had fresh raspberries on hand and used them instead of the blackberries and it was very good! I also sprinkled an additional 1 T. sugar on top at the end and it wasn't too sweet for our taste. One person who ate it said this recipe could also be used with other types of fruit. Another person commented the crust tasted like a cinnamon roll!

This is not only the best cobbler I've ever made. It is the best I've ever eaten. Blackberries are tart, so don't skimp on the sugar. Otherwise, follow the recipe to a T and you and your guests will not be disappointed.

Easy and different; would make it again; it came out slightly burnt after 48 minutes of baking time so I would watch it carefully.

This recipe was everything I wanted in a blackberry cobbler. My family and I really enjoy alot of crust in our cobblers so that part of the recipe was aplus for us. The crust was quite easy to handle and although the pinwheels really were a mess in the making, they turned out fine at the end. The one mistake i made the first time I tried this recipe was to make it in a rectanguar pan. The round pinwheels only turn out nicely if placed a round pie pan. I didn't find the cobbler too sweet but there is so much variation in the sweetness of different "batches" fruit that I'm sure this is a variable that's tough to control.

This is a terrific cobbler--delicious and easy to make. The recipe is different from most cobbler recipes due to making the simple sugar syrup and rolling the dough in a jelly-roll fashion, but it works and we all thought it was the best!

This is a wonderful dessert; and one of the easiest doughs I've ever made. I've made this several times, and it is always a hit.

I was looking for a recipe for blackberries and this one sounded interesting. It was messy but not too difficult to make. The cobbler looked good but was WAY too sweet for my taste! I didn't even use as much sugar as the recipe called for. I'll keep looking!

I've made this dish several times, and everyone raves about it. It's a beautiful dish, and quite easy to prepare. I usually use a sweetened bisquick version for the dough, to speed it up, and it still turns out great. Try it - enjoy!

After reading the reviews I was sure this was going to be a great cobbler. I was very disappointed. Too much crust and not enough berries for my family. I'll stick to my usual cobbler recipe next time.

for honey lovers. i used the honey instead of sugar syrup, but i also followed the advice of the previous reviewers, so i used only half cup of honey with little less than cup of water. I also used cherries instead of blackberries. I plan to try maple syrup/blueberry combination today. It's just such a wonderful versatile recipe!

Rating: 4
What an incredible dessert! The presentation was beautiful, the texture moist and the taste even better! I made this with frozen blueberries and cut the sugar by a full one half and it turned out just right. This recipe is definitely one that I will use over and over again!

I used a different dough (a bisquick-brown sugar dough) just for speed, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly--wonderful! instead of ice cream, I served this with some sweetened plain yogurt and someextra fresh blackberries, crushed up with a little sugar to make a sauce. I will make this again and again.

Made this for friends to rave reviews. Have already made it again, it's easy to substitute whatever fruit's on hand--I ran out of blackberries, so used a combination of berries and peaches, tasted just as good. Could safely pare back on the sugar, though.

This makes a nice presentation, but it is waaay too sweet for me, and I had to use 2/3 cup of milk.

This cobbler was outstanding! We topped it with vanilla ice cream and it was delicious. I was glad about the "messy" comment because mine did sort of fall apart as I was putting it in the pan but you couldn't tell after it baked. I would love to try it with different fruits - cherries maybe?

We have a tradition of picking our own blackberries(going back to my grandfather) here in WV so I love blackberry cobbler. This recipe was probably the best yet. The only problem I had was that my dish was too shallow, and the "juice" ran over in my oven, next time I will use a deeper dish. I thought the dough was perfect and even though my mother (cobbler maker from way back) questioned the sugar water thing (we never put water in our berries) it turned out just fine and she was surprised. I put my dough together by hand and the secret is not to work with it too much. :-)YUM YUM :-)

I made this recipe with ripe nectarines and peaches and substituted orange juice for some of the water(since I soaked the fruit in juice so it wouldn't discolor). Fantastic!!!!Also to anyone doing this recipe for the first time, make sure you add all the sugar water to the recipe. The first time I thought it was too much, because the rolls seemed to swim in the liquid. Note: It works with regular flour...make sure you add 1 1/2 t baking powder and hold back a a tablespoon of the flour.

Delicious. The proportion of dough to filling was perfect. The sugar was accurate, but I used a little less blackberries than called for. Altogether, a great standard blackberry cobbler recipe.

Wow! This recipe was scrumptious. Very easy to make. This treat turned out so good that I will use again, maybe with different fruit. I did add a necterine to my blackberries and it gave it a nice texture. Presentation is attractive and indivual servings easy to spoon out of dish. Thumbs up!

This recipe was wonderful. The extra crust is a drastic improvement over the traditional runny cobblers. Each crust wrap acted as individual servings and kept the fruit from running into the empty area. I will definitely make this again!

This was really easy to make, other than it being messy,(but what dish isn't, when you get down to washing the dishes you've made from it)it was super quick and super good. Alot more crust than a traditional cobbler, which is good in my book, and in my opinion, it tasted even better the day after I made it!

This blackberry recipe was very delicious. I found it very easy to make. People have said it was messy, however, if you use partially frozen blackberries it is not messy at all. I did use self rising flour which the recipe called for. You can find it at the grocery store. This recipe would be good with any type of fruit. I will try it again using fresh peaches !! Enjoy !! Rolling the fruit with the dough and slicing gives it a very nice presentation ! Which is very important!!

This recipe makes wonderful use of our abundant (at least in August) plump, sweet, Northwest blackberries. Frozen do nicely at other times of the year. Messy to make but well worth the bother. A unique and delicious cobbler!

I've made this recipe again and again and everyone loves it. I have many friends that request this!!

I have made this recipe several times using different berries. It reminds me of one I used to use and had misplaced. The only negative I would mention is that I have never heard of self rising cake flour. I used plain Martha White flour with 3/4 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt and a pinch of soda

I was hestitate when I saw the word messy...but then what cobbler isn't? This recipe, by using the jelly roll technique, allowed for good mixing of all ingredients and made the presentation agreeable. The flavor is great! Thanks.
