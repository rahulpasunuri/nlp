I made these as part of a festive New Years Eve of movies and small plates, and they were just scrumptious and perfect. Delicately steamed, with just the right amount of crisp on the underside. Cannot recommend highly enough. Want to try with other fillings just for fun.

I kind of understand the bland part mentioned by another reviewer but, since I first made them 3 years ago, I've adjusted this in a simple manner. There's a flavor boost to my suggestion: Halve the pork and add 10 shrimp, chopped. Sprinkle some "fish sauce" (nam pla) and add a handful of chopped cilantro. Dip in a spring roll, chili dipping sauce alongside a dipping sauce of 1/4 cup soy, 1 minced garlic, some minced ginger, nam pla, red chili sauce, some orange juice, lime juice, sugar and a touch of sesame oil. You'll be pleased.

This was just average. I found the filling to be bland. I would probably add shrimp, hot pepper flakes/sauce and use less cabbage if I were to make it again.My won ton wrappers were not great which did not help but the main issue was bland filling.

The very best dipping sauce that I've been using for years is Kikkomaan Pork Cutlet Sauce, or any Pork Cutlet sauce if you can't find Kikkomaan's. I know it doesn't sound right, but it is delicious.

Delicious! We had these for our Chinese New Year celebration and they were liked by all. I did blanch the cabbage for 1 minute (as seen in another recipe) and would recommend a nonstick skillet since my 2nd and 3rd batch stuck (hence the name, I guess)! I was unsure about not pre-cooking the pork, but it cooked through and was flavorful!

A keeper for sure! I used premade cole slaw mix and omitted the carrot. I used a little more pork (about 8 oz) and these were perfect. Used plain soy sauce for dipping this time and that was fairly tasty, but will make again with some of the dipping sauces recommended by other users. Better than my local chinese carryout dumplings.

Love the flavor! I have made these with pork and with chicken, both ways are delicious. Don't be tempted to use a non-stick pan, it just means disaster! I love having "take-out" by taking these out of my freezer!

Wonderful. This was exactly what I wanted. I made them with turkey because I keep kosher, I didn't notice any difference from the pork ones I used to eat. The flavor is spot on. I served them with soy sauce with a touch of rice vinegar.

Absolutely outstanding! I did not have cabbage so used endive (did not salt and drain it, just chopped in food processor and added to pork mixture so ended up being a lot easier than cabbage). Otherwise followed recipe to a T. Next time I would use a bit less oil but otherwise the cooking technique was just fine. Much, much better than the Chinese restaurant up the street. My husband raved about these - next time I will make more and freeze some!

Fabulous pot stickers with a fresh flavor -- I'll never buy pre-made again! Do yourself a favor and make a double recipe so there's a few in the freezer for another time. An assembly tip: bring the wrappers to room temperature and keep very moist. I found chilling the filling made it easier to handle too.

Wow, these are amazing! I've always loved pot stickers, but have always been hesitant to make them. This recipe is straight-forward and calls for ingredients that are easy to come by. I followed it to a "T" and it came out beautifully. The only changes I made are: I steamed the dumplings for 10 minutes before I fried them, and I used wonton wrappers, because that's all I could find. They didn't seem to suffer for it. I'll definitely be making these again!

These were fabulous, the only thing I did different was I steamed them. They were excellent!

These are the most delicious pork dumplings I have ever tried!!! after frying I used bamboo steamer with EXCELLENT results.

I've made this twice already. Its light and simply delicious. I freeze the pot stickers on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper before I put them in plastic freezer bags. This is definitely a keeper in my recipe box!

this was an excellent recipe. I made them and they tasted just like the ones I order in Chinese Restaurants

Made as per the recipe and they turned out wonderfully! Got all ingredients at the asian market. We used the food processor with a grating blade to shred the napa cabbage. These were fantastic!

Delicious! Followed recipe for the pot stickers exactly, and they turned out perfectly. Great flavor! Cheated with store bought dipping sauce, though.

Yum! These were quite delicious- a definite make again! I made them in advance, and froze them. To cook, I added the dumplings to a pot of boiling water and cooked until soft. I then placed the cooked dumplings on a cookie cooling rack to drain, then quickly pan fried them until crispy. I ended up tripling the recipe, since I had 1 lb. of ground pork (and added only 1 egg total), so I have a bunch in the freezer for dinner on more than one occasion. These were time consuming to make, but well worth the effort!

this was seriously time consuming, but well worth the effort. i followed this exactly, & used a gyoza press. i am completely blown away at the results. i like these better than any i have had in an asian restaurant. it's kind of bad because it's easy to chow down a couple dozen in a sitting. this is seriously a perfect recipe.

perfect. If you can't find the wrappers most grocery stores sell won ton wrappers that work just as well. Go easy on the sesame oil because it can overpower the other flavors, I tend to cut back a bit on it. SERVE WITH NUOC CHAM DIPPING SAUCE RECIPE if you are not afraid of fish sauce it goes perfectly with this recipe. To the cook who left out the cabbage, carrots and scallions...duh, thats why it wasn't good.

This is quite good, but be wary of following timing instructions-it notes to remove the lid once water has been boiled off, but following that instruction produced some very burnt pot sticker bottoms for me. Limit covered-and-on-the-stove cook time to 7 minutes--the water can be poured off. Also, the cranberry teriyaki glaze for dipping? Avoid.

This recipe is perfect! Next time I will add some shrimp as well with the pork. Also made a dipping sauce with soy sauce, lots of rice wine, and a little sesame oil and this was perfect. Yummmmm!

The flavoring was good, but I couldn't for the life of me get all of the liquid in the pan to boil out. It was fortunate that I decided to triple the recipe, since I burned the first thirty to a crisp. I started frying them in batches of ten and took them out of the pan when the meat was cooked, then tried to crisp them up in a different pan with no oil, since the skins had absorbed enough of that to coat the pan themselves. I left out the cabbage, carrot, and scallions and they tasted fine. I mixed up a dipping sauce consisting of one part soy sauce to one part teriyaki sauce to one part Worcestershire sauce that tasted pretty decent. I might make it again to see if I could get everything to work properly, but it's an awful lot of work for something that I could go to a neighborhood restaurant and order much more easily and have it taste better.

These are the BEST pot stickers ever. The seasonings are perfect. It's important to use the napa or (even better) savoy cabbage. I use seasoned rice vinegar/soy dipping sauce.

These potstickers are excellent! I doubled the recipe so we'd have leftovers to nosh on during the week, but they were completely gone within a day. As I did not have all of the ingredients on hand to make either of the linked dipping sauces, I substituted the soy/lemon/ginger dipping sauce from a classic Bon Appétit recipe from nearly thirty years ago, "Vietnamese Pork Sticks with Dipping Sauce." Even my husband, who is not a huge fan of Oriental cuisine, told me, "Don't lose this recipe." Filling and pleating the dumplings is kind of boring and time- consuming, but I roped my 9-year-old daughter in as an assistant, and once we got the routine down it went pretty quickly.

These were delicious!! It took a while to master the folding process of the dumpling wrappers, but they were fun to make and really tasted great. To speed up the process, we tried steaming them, which I would not recommend..they just got all smashed together. Maybe if you had a bamboo steamer this would work a bit better...

Perfect Pot Stickers. Take your time creating them all and then use a large skillet to cook 8-10 at a time. Very easy and so delicious. Restaurant quality.

I used to make dumplings/pot stickers with my grandmother when I was a little girl and this recipe takes me back. I was looking for a basic recipe to use as a foundation for both basic dumplings and more complex variations and this is it. The proportions of soy sauce, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, are perfect. This time I made them without the napa cabbage and carrot and it was fantastic! If you do use the napa cabbage, be sure to follow the draining instructions or your mix will be too watery. Next time I can substitute chives for scallions or add glass noodles. I also made a dipping sauce my grandmother always used to put out. Soy sauce, sesame oil or chili oil, white vinegar, and mashed raw garlic all mixed up. To mash the garlic, we would place the garlic in a heavy bowl and pound it out with the end of a rolling pin (use a french rolling pin). You can't talk to anyone afterwards but it's worth it.

Excellent recipe for pot stickers. One could use wonton wrappers as well. I used egg roll wraps and cut them in half diagonally. Dim sum dipping sauce is excellent.
