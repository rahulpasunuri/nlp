I used equal parts chanterelle, oyster and the mini portobellos and cooked to the "Can be done ahead" note. I kept them separate from the "gravy" and let the end user combine to their taste. I also served a horseradish sauce but in truth, the gravy and mushrooms were so good not much of it was eaten.

The flavor of this dish is absolutely amazing! It was well worth the time and effort to make. We felt like we were eating in a fine dining restaurant.

I have made this recipe three times, twice for Christmas Dinner using beef tenderloin and most recently with a sirloin tip roast. It is always excellent as written. Rubbing the beef with salty garlic thyme a day ahead makes the meat so flavorful. The mushroom sauce is exquisite; I have used combinations of chantarelle, shittake, and/or oyster and it is always delicious. Now that I feel comfortable with the recipe, I switched things up a bit with the cheaper cut of beef and swapped a more labor intensive Beef Stock for the reduction (wanted to get leftover stock for another recipe.) It's still excellent! I just can't recommend this recipe enough.

This is an excellent recipe. Just delicious! Like several other reviewers, I highly recommend going all the way and making the Beef Reduction. It's time consuming, but not tedious or difficult. I think it made a huge difference in the final product. Also, I strongly suggest not adding any salt until the very end. When the Reduction is added to the mushroom mixture and it cooks down to get thicker, the whole thing becomes more concentrated and saltier on its own. I used a mixture of mushrooms, including some rehydrated morels. Fabulous!!!

The salt & herb rub for the beef was fantastic, and I'm positive that doing it 3 days ahead is the reason the grass-fed/pastured standing rib roast I used instead of a chateaubriand was as tender as one from a Monsanto-fed commodity cow. Word to the wise: for a perfectly pink-right-up-to-the-crust med rare roast, pull your roast out of the fridge well in advance (at least an hour, a couple for a big hunka cow) so that it comes to room temp before it goes into the oven. Having done so, my head may never fit into my hats again due to the swelling-inducing praise I received for the way this roast was cooked! The mushroom sauce was spectacular, as well: I used 8 oz each chanterelles & oysters, though the ingredients list didnt specify the amount for the oyster mushrooms. Beef reduction... well... wouldnt bother with that one again (as a sauce, anyway). It was fine, but a far tastier & less time consuming reduction sauce can be found on the Roast Beef Tenderloin with Port Sauce recipe here on epi.

Very, very rich, but really good. I thought the process of making the sauce and potatoes was unnecessarily complicated, but otherwise this recipe went off without a hitch. I would also criticize the recommendation of serving asparagus as a side, since asparagus season is in the spring, and chanterelles are harvested in the fall.

Excellent. Made for a group of 8, who raved about the meat. Expensive, but definitely worth the $$. Have made twice since!

The preparations for this recipe call for oyster and chanterelle mushrooms, however the list of ingredients only list 8 oz. chanterelles. How many oyster mushrooms should be included?

Best roast beef I've ever eaten. Followed the recipe but used a mix of oyster, crimini and portabello mushrooms as Chantrelle's would have cost more than the meat! I would be just as happy with normal mashed potatos as with these. The beef reduction is absolutely incredible. I made it a day ahead. Served with fresh green beans quick steamed then tossed in browned butter. If you want a splurge meal, this is amazing. And the leftovers made the best french dip sandwich ever!!!

Uhhhhh .... this is the best best roast beef I ever ate. I follow the direction exactly like the recipe, but instead of using the beef tenderloin, I used beef chuck, turned out .. so good .. dark outside, pink and juicy as prime ribs inside. Definitely I would make it again, and highly recommend this recipe. Make sure you have to use fresh thyme, no substituion.

I made some cheap-o timesaving changes and it was still delicious so I can only imagine how good it is with the real ingredients. I used beef stock rather than the reduction and button mushrooms. I used Brazilian tenderloin and it was sensational. The juices in the roasting pan were quite salty from the rub so if you use a ready made stock, use low-salt. I can not make mashed potatoes and this dish was excellent. Served with lemon-pepper broccoli as well. Yum!

I cooked this for Christmas 2009 for 12 people. It was absolutely amazing. We all loved it, I'm probably going to repeat this year.

I won't give a fork rating as I substituted sirloin tip roast (cooked longer) for the chateaubriand to save $$ and could not find chanterelles either so wound up with fresh crimini and shiitake mushrooms, but I will probably make this again for company with the real stuff, and would make it again for family as I did this time with random mushrooms and tip roast. My husband is raving about this dish. The flavors in the sauce were fabulous, the outer parts of the meat (which absorbed the rub) were delicious. I really liked the potatoes. I made the beef reduction, but was a little puzzled, adding purchased beef stock to homemade beef stock? Is it "stone soup" or merely a beefier stock? I don't know, but it didn't take that much time to do so I would certainly go to the effort if I was roasting tenderloin which would benefit from the added flavor.

Oh. my. goodness. I made this for my in-laws and their longtime friend at Christmas. We spent a fortune on the beef, but it was worth it. If you have the time, absolutely make the beef reduction. It was so delicious. When I wanted a quicker version of this for an impromptu dinner party, though, I used beef stock. It wasn't jaw-dropping good like the other time, but it was still impressive. My guests raved about it, but my husband and I both knew how much better it could be. DO NOT USE DRIED THYME! The dish gets a lot of depth from the thyme, and would suffer for the substitution. Side note: The market's chanterelle's were too pricey and some looked soggy, so I got crimini instead. I liked their firm texture perhaps better than I would have enjoyed the chanterelle's taste.

This was the best roast we have ever had! I didn't buy the suggest beef here because of the price. I didn't think it was worth it if I wasn't entertaining. The cheaper meat was still great, so don't hold off on this recipe because of the expensive meat. Also, the reduction is SO worth it! It doesn't require a lot of effort, just a lot of time to reduce. I made as is the first time, but I think this time I will use half and half in place of both whole milk and whipped cream. This is a great spin on a somewhat mundane dish.

This recipe appears to be exceptional as I rated it but if you prepare the roast beef along with the beef reduction isn't this just too much? Do you serve the entire reduction along with the roast beef?

I made this for my husband's B-day. I was hesitant at first because of all the ingredients and steps involved in this recipe but it was ABSOLUTELY worth it!!!! My husband took thirds plus he sneaked the left overs while I slept that night! I couldn't find fresh Chanterelle mushrooms so I used dried, make sure to follow the package's instructions. I used fresh oyster mushrooms and threw in a few crimini as well. This was THE MOST delicious dinner I've eaten.

The printed recipe is different than the displayed recipe. Printed it calls for 8 oz fresh oyster mushrooms in addition to the chanterelles.

I love to cook, so I thought I'd tackle this on a long rainy Sunday. I think it took me about 5 hours start to finish. It was one of the best recipes I've ever made. Absolutely worth every single step - don't even hesitate! LOVED IT !!!!

Wow, this was wonderful. Although making the reduction was an additional step, it was well worth it as no stock could give you the depth of flavour it added to the sauce. This was great for a dinner party as most of it was done earlier (caramelizing the shallots, the reduction etc.) Will definitely make again - very impressive.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe exactly as written, along with the potato recipe suggested. A) It was a huge pain in the butt, and B) it was absolutely FANTASTIC. If you use just beef broth instead of bothering to make the reduction, you're committing a cardinal sin.

Unbelievable! I've made this multiple times--and used the mashed potatoes with other dishes. It's always a hit!

the recipe says roast beef, but the chateaubriand cut, at least here in quebec is a filet mignon cut- i bought the roast beef cut, and all the work for the DELICIOUS mushroom sauce (beef reduction was soo worth the effort) would have been wonderful with the finer cut. that said, the whole thing was an absolute, wonderful winter extra

I made this one night during a girls weekend out of town trip with my 2 friends. Even with cooking in an unfamiliar kitchen, it turned out wonderul. I couldn't find chanterelle mushrooms locally, so I substituted with a combination of crimini and shiitake. I was also unable to make the beef reduction due to time constraints, so I used a good quality beef broth. The beef was tender and very flavorable. The potatoes were also a big hit, as was the sauce. I served it with roasted asparagus, as was recommended. The tenderloin may be expensive, but it is definitely worth the price. I was even able to bring home the leftovers and reheat them for my husband. He loved it too.

I want to make this recipe but am wondering if the beef reduction is a must. According to the recipe link it takes almost 3 hours to make. Can I just deglaze the roasting pan of the beef tenderloin with Brandy and use those juices mixed with beef broth to add to the mushrooms? Any suggestions?

I made this dish last night and I have to say that everyone enjoyed it. The meat came out perfect and the mashed potatoes were also very good. This is a keeper:)

I have used this recipe three times and it comes out perfectly each time. The rub creates a wonderful flavor without being overwhelming. I have used both brandy and marsala (in a pinch) and found them both nice.

Rating: 4
What is going on here is "dry brining". At first, the salt pulls moisture from the meat, but as time passes, almost all of those juices are reabsorbed, bringing the salt along with them. Check out Chowhound.com for some discussion: "The Los Angeles Times did a recent article about Judy Rogers' method. Its results found pre-salted (and pre-black peppered)beef fillets had much fuller flavor and firmer texture than the unsalted beef fillets."

This was absolutely fabulous! I prepared it as written for my husbands 30th birthday, and served it with the caramelized shallot mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. It seemed to make more sauce than we would need, but I was surprised how little was actually left over! We are seriously thinking of just pouring the leftover sauce we do have over bread. The beef reduction is definitely worth the extra time, don't laze out and just use beef broth (like I almost did), the depth of flavor will be seriously lacking  and youll be very glad you took the extra time. To mrsdeere, who asked about the brandy, if you left it out, it wouldn't ruin the recipe; however, alcohol (brandy, wine, etc) really helps to dissolve all the fond from the roasting pan, much better than just water or stock and that is a lot of great flavor to waste! You could also cut the brandy in half and just use it to deglaze the roasting pan to get all of that good beefy flavor into the sauce, and if you dont have brandy in the house, look for the mini bottles at a liquor store, which would be about all you would need.

We made this nearly as-is (subbed marsala for brandy due to not having the latter) and it is super-fantastic. The rub is absolutely *critical* to the flavor - do not skip! We expect this recipe will enter our household's stable.

Other than cutting the cream in the mushroom sauce to 1/4 cup, I did not deviate from the recipe in any way. This meal was exquisite.

This recipe is wonderful as is. Much ado about nothing with the cream and brandy. For heaven's sake don't use brandy if you don't want to....use broth instead....if you don't want to use cream, use skim milk...just add an extra tsp or two of flour to help thicken it. This is obviously for special occasions...don't fret over a 1/2 cup of cream or using brandy. Be adventurous....You only live once!!

Nothing can truely substitute the amazing richness that cream gives, however, some of us have had to come up with alternatives.. so here is one suggestion: Carnation /Nestle makes a canned product that is 2% M.F. Rich & Creamy Evaporated Partley Skimmed Milk. (Found next to the sweetened condensed cans in the store.) This is not an artificial product,, has 80% more calcium than the same amount of reg. milk, and for 1/4 cup there is 1.4g of fat. Goes great in all kinds of things, K..

Looks like a classic Sunday roast. The dry rub is likely to be a vital step for this cut of meat; tenderloin while of a delicate texture isn't as flavorful as you'd hope it would be (especially at the price one pays even at a discount club store). If you were making this dish with another cut, say a rib, you might want to omit the salt rub. You can use non-fat half and half in most cream sauce recipes that are prepared this way. The result will be flavorful and creamy, but not as heavy as with cream.

Rating: 0
The recipe does not call for brining as some have descibed the process of salting the meat. There is no "solution" in this recipe. As for an alternative to the cream, you may try using Soy milk but it will alter the taste a bit.

KC - if you don't have cream, you could try substituting cream cheese to make them ultra-rich. Just be careful not to go overboard!

Rating: 0
KCLewis - You could probably get away with substituting 1/2 &1/2 or milk for the cream, but you'll likely not get the same richness and might get an entirely different texture than is expected. I've had recipes that changed this ingredient in order to take out fat and calories, but some recipes just shouldn't be "de-fatted". If you are asking due to a lactose issue, I would simply suggest that you experiment and see what happens. That's what we "experienced" cooks do. I hope this helps.

Rating: 0
KC, It's a half a cup of cream for six servings which is not that much. Also, the sauce is served on the side so you can adjust the portion even more. However, if it is that much of a concern, try half and half instead. You may have to cook a little longer to get the thickness desired. Good luck!

Is there anyway a recipe like this can be made without the cream? Any advice from the more experienced cooks out there?

There would be no reason to BRINE (soaking in a strong salt solution) a tenderloin roast, however using a RUB or COATING (as this recipe calls for) enhances the flavor of the meat and provides a protective coating to seal in the meat's juices, with wonderful results. I have always used a rub when making a rib roast or a tenderloin roast and received great reviews. My son, who attended Le Cordon Bleu Culinary School in London was also taught to use a rub on many cuts of meat. BRINING is a great technique to use with poultry, I BRINE turkey for at least 24 hours prior to roasting and it comes out very moist. BRINING is also a good way to enhance the flavor and restore the texture of frozen shrimp after they have thawed. I plan to use this recipe on Easter Sunday and expect great results. I will have a problem finding the mushrooms that are called for so I will substitute with varieties that I can find.

Dear Cook from Germany, I can think of no earthly reason to brine red meat. When I read the recipe I thought it was written by mistake. I was taught that the whole purpose of brining is to allow for sugars and salts to cellularly rearrange themselves in preparation for cooking a meat/fowl or fish that might otherwise overcook. I can't imagine why you'd do that if you have a good meat thermometer and a brain. So, I'm going to skip the brining recommendation in this recipe and do the rest. Have fun making this it looks like it's going to be delicious.

Dear fellow cooks, I am new to making roast beef and need advice. This recipe calls for brining beef in plastic while other recipes (e.g., Dec. 07), call for leaving it uncovered. What's the difference, if any? Thanks in advance!
