This is one my familys favorite meals. I agree with others that there is WAY too much oil called for. On a week night we use bagged slaw (although chopping a cabbage takes no time). I usually throw in a lot of cilantro and mint. I serve it with thinly sliced steak (usually London Broil) which Ive coated with Chinese Five Spice before cooking. There are rarely leftovers.

I have made this for cookouts many times and people love it! I agree about cutting back the oil and upping the amounts of ginger and sesame oil for flavor. I also substitute other veggies for the snow peas--they are very labor-intensive when you're making a double recipe for a party, and I didn't think they added much flavor-wise.

Just made it. Brought some out to my husband in a small bowl. Two minutes later he comes back in, hands me the bowl and says, "that's the best slaw I've ever had."

Delightful summer slaw. I agree with others to cut the oil in half or more, and add the brown sugar and lime as suggested. Next time I will use Ponzu sauce instead of soy sauce since the Ponzu has soy, citrus and sugar, Be creative and use any crsip raw veggie in addition to the napa and snow peas ( a must), I used red and yellow pepper, yellow squash and carrots. Don't forget the peanuts, they add the perfect crunch.

Loved this and would definitely make it again. I added thinly sliced raw snow peas.

I would cut back on the oil and use bagged shredded carrots over the snow peas.

I served this to my boyfriend who doesn't like slaw, and now he requests it all the time!

I have to agree - not much flavor and too much oil. The dressing really lacked flavor - for all the work it was to chop the veggies for a party of 15 it was a total disapointment.

Agree with others that dressing needed a lot of work. I cut the vegetable oil in half but to add more flavor added extra sesame oil. Also added more soy sauce, juice of half a lime, asian chili sauce and some sugar to take away the bitter edge. Eventually, it tasted very good.

i had to improvise with many of the salad ingredients, but the dressing is what really needed tweeking. i cut way back on the oil, added a little more soy, and maybe 1/8 cup of sugar, because it was so acidic (harsh, really.) bottom line: still a pretty darn tasty salad with the cabbage, gr. onions, shredded carrots and cukes, bean sprouts, pistachios (!), half the veg. oil, and try the sugar!

I've made this twice and will make it again. The oil needs to be cut in half. Added jalapeno peppers for some heat. Great with pan seared scallops.

Wonderful blend of flavors and so easy to prepare. I served this with Indonesion-style burgers with peanut sauce (on this site). This recipe will be served many times this summer.

Great side dish for mahi mahi and coconut-ginger jasmine rice. I omitted the peanuts and added some grated carrots. I also added a few squirts of lime juice.

I have made this many times over the years and love it. It's great in the summer. I would highly recommend this recipe!

Recipe required a few modifications to make it three forks. My suggestions are in line with previous reviewers...it definately needs more soy (plus I added salt but no peanuts). If you're a cilantro lover, this salad is a natural match. Like others, I cut the oil in half and thought it was perfect balance of oil/acid. I also added juice from half a lemon because it seemed to need just a bit more tartness.

Pretty good. A very standard Chinese chicken salad, minus the chicken. I added toasted seseme seeds and mandarin slices. I would reduce the oil by half next time, and add some fresh lime juice.

this is a great side dish that is often used as a main course by vegetarians at cookouts when no other alternatives are available. I usually add shredded carrots and a yellow pepper for additional color. Very festive.

Needed a salad to go with Teriyaki Chicken so I tried this. It was good although I didn't have any peapods or roasted peanuts. I did use toasted slivered almonds and that worked out well. Look forward to making it again with all the proper ingredients!

I did cut down on the oil as suggested and added chili oil for some zip. I also substituted roasted almond slivers for the peanuts. This turned out great.

bland. I even cut back on the oil, like others had advised. Maybe with chicken it would be better - along with something to give it a lot more kick. Otherwise it's just cabbage and oil...

We found this salad crisp, fresh, and delicious. Next time I would cut down on the oil - maybe 1-2 Tb less. It was a nice accompaniment to Thai chicken breasts, a good outdoor BBQ menu with a twist!

This slaw was a big hit to the party I took it to, and I enjoyed it very much myself. One mistake I made was doubling the recipe to serve 8 people. It makes a lot, plus I added some things to my slaw, by the advice of some other reviewers. I added a bunch of cilantro, chopped, a yellow bell pepper, and a half a small head of red cabbage. I also added a couple tablespoons of dark brown sugar to the dressing, along with some cayenne pepper and some hot chili oil. I also halved the amount of vegetable oil, which I think made for a better salad. This is a terrific salad and very beautiful and everyone who tasted it insisted on the recipe.

Just add some diced, cooked chicken breast to this and you will have a nice main course. I have made this with or without, it's all good!

Very good, but next time I will also cut the oil in half and up the ginger and soy sauce. This is a colorful, tasty, and healthy side dish or light meal.

I love this recipe and make it over and over again. It is delicious, very easy, and a nice change from lettuce salads. I usually leave out the snow peas and the peanuts simply because I don't have them on hand. It always disappears when I bring it to potlucks.

Great Recipe. I use both red and yellow peppers, and I also cut in some red cabbage. Having all those different colors really helps the presentation. Also, I followed the lead of other reviewers and slightly lowered the amount of veg. oil, increased the amount of ginger, and added the juice of a half a lemon. I would highly recommend for summer entertaining.

I halved this recipe in making it for two. It did make a lot of dressing and I even further halved the oil and increased the soy and ginger per the comments below. I used fresh ginger and dried and about 1/2 tblsp of sugar. I also used sliced almonds instead of peanuts. I thought this tasted very good. Nice ginger flavor. Good accompaniment with fish.

The liberal addition of cilantro is a big help to this recipe, as is the addition of one other color of pepper for a more lively presentation. Cut the oil in half, up the soy and ginger, and consider adding a bit of lemon juice since the other acid is a bit mild. Everyone I serve this to loves it - it looks great on a plate and unlike many other salads can be prepared (though not dressed) in advance.

I was in a hurry, so I used 1 lb. of shredded coleslaw mix, instead of the Napa cabbage. I increased the soy sauce to 2 Tbls. It was delicious. Very crisp and crunchy.

Very oily. Needs more color. Needs a LOT more soy sauce and rice vinegar.

Wow - what a terrific recipe. Great color, texture and taste. Each bite is a treat to the senses.

It seemed too oily to me - maybe I added too much dressing? I had to make 5 times the recipe, so it was difficult to judge. If I make it again, I will reduce the vegetable oil. It was definitely crunchy though - even after several hours. And I should add that many people said they thought it was great.
