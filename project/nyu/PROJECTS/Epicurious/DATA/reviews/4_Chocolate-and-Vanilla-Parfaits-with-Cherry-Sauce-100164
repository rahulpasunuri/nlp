There are no directions on what to do with the eggs and sugar with the chocolate. After you freeze the parfait for 4 hrs, do you thaw it first or eat it frozen?

I made this recipe following the instructions listed in the correction review below. Both were excellent, very rich in flavor. I personally liked the Parfaits without the cherry sauce, but many of my guests enjoyed the sauce.

The recipe is not complete. It has left out the instructions for treating the eggs and sugar in the chocolate part. They need to be cooked over simmering water and beaten intil light and fluffy and the sugar disolves, about 5 minutes. Then incorporated with the chocolate and the beaten cream.
