Followed the recipe, except instead of pan cooking, I stuck the chicken in the oven for 30 minutes after marinating. I thought the chicken turned out very well - very moist. Altogether, the chicken was easy to make! I used another reviewers recommendation of adding siracha to regular miso pasta as a substitute of kochujang, and the result was very tasty. Will certainly make again.

i prepared this dish for my family including my two children and it was marvelous. my 13 year old was asking for more. i fixed it again for several of my friends but added 4 1/2 tbls of the miso paste and 1 1/2 tbls of red cyanne pepper and i used toasted sesame oil instead of the plain sesame oil,that the receipe calls for, which added a really nice flavour to the marinade. i hope someone else tries it. please let me know what you think. btw, it will add a kick to the meal so beware...he he

I make this all the time with kochugang (I also use miring instead of water). But, if you can't get it, regular miso mixed with some siracha to taste makes a reasonable substitute.

Made with kochujang, this recipe is a keeper - although I doubled the kochujang to get a little more heat and doubled the water to loosen up the paste. Made with white miso, not a keeper - just salty & gingery, no flavor depth, pretty uninteresting. Agree with the other poster that kochujang is not the same as miso....

This marinade didn't do much for me. It just pretty much tasted like a plain grilled breast. I love the miso sea bass recipe on this site, though.

this was so "blah" - I didn't even bother to eat it once I cooked it. My boyfriend ate his, but I gave mine to the dog.

This didn't really make a marinade, more of a paste that I rubbed into the chicken. All in all, the flavor was wonderful the meat moist and I will happily go for this one again.

The ginger was a little overwhelming for met, but my husband devoured this. Very moist and flavorful, though I had only marinated for one hour

Made this according to recipe last night. Was quite good, kids also really liked it. To clarify, however, Kochujang is not the same thing as miso paste. When made with Kochujang, this dish is very good; could be dull with miso paste (though to be fair, I have not tried). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gochujan g

OMG! So moist!!! Great flavor. I marinated for it a day or 2 and it was SUPER. Made it with the edamame/corn salad. Everyone (4 people)loved it so much I ran out of a double batch. I'm making it again the same week with the edamame salad. Can't get enough!

Miso is one of those ingredients that is not available in small amounts. so when I buy it, I try and plan a number of menus to use up the Miso. This is one of those recipes...quick and tasty.

I really enjoyed the flavours of this dish. Had some trouble cooking it all the way through without burning the marinade. I think when I make it again I might halve the chicken breasts horizontally to make smaller easier to cook fillets.

Kochujang is not the same thing as miso - it's pepper-based, not soy-based. Dwenjang is the Korean version of fermented soy bean paste.

Rating: 2
I didn't have the Korean Kochujang miso and just used white japanese miso and I found the flavour to be really weak. I tasted the sesame oil and ginger but it was kinda bland overall. Maybe if I had the right Korean Kochujang paste it would be better. I agree with another reviewer that the "miso paste" is incorrect term because Kochujang is a fermented chili bean paste but not a miso which is a totally different Japanese fermented bean paste.

I made with miso paste on hand (not Kochujang) and thought the flavors of the marinade were excellent. Hubby doesn't care for ginger, so this probably won't make it to our regular rotation based on his tastes. If you like ginger and a bit of spice, it's a good choice for bringing chicken breasts up a notch.

The marinade was too thick, more like a paste, even when I used hot water to thin it. The flavor was good though. Watch it carefully though because the marinade browns quickly, before the inside is done. I would pound the breaasts flat next time for more even cooking.

This recipe is simple perfection. So easy to make, it's great for a weeknight dinner. The flavor is delicious and it makes the chicken so juicy and tender... it cut apart with a fork, I didn't even need a knife! I used an indoor grill to get the nice grill marks. Served with the edamame corn salad as suggested - it was great! Will make many more times. It would also be great as kebabs for an appetizer.

This was super easy to make, not time consuming, and tasty to boot! I did end up using spicy sesame seed oil instead of light, but that just gave it an extra kick of heat (which is fine by me).

For a quick, light meal this was really good. We followed the recipe and marinated the chicken in a ziplock bag. At first I thought the marinade was going to be too thick, but in a plastic bag it worked great. We also used chicken tenders which are a bit thinner and it really worked well. If I use a full breast next time, I will pound down as another reviewer suggested.

So simple. So awesome. 'nough said.

Very good. Easy, too. I would pound the breasts 'til they are a bit flattened and uniform in thickness so that they cook faster and more thoughly. As they burn easily, keep a good watch on the heat level.

Rating: 4
Very good flavor combination and very easy. However, I found that the glaze caused the outer crusting of the chicken to burn and the chicken took much longer to cook than 8 mins. The chicken was still moist and tender, though. With the leftover marinade, I heated it up and mixed it into white rice which was delicious.

this was delicious. the marinade was too thick so i mixed in some mirin to thin it out. dipped the chicken in the mixture and baked in the oven...still delicious

I made a few modifications to this based on what I had, and it was fantastic. I used instant miso instead of the paste like some other reviewers; instead of light sesame oil I used spicy toasted sesame oil for more kick, and while I don't know exactly my quantities I definitely know I threw in more minced garlic and ginger, with a little bit of honey as well. Marinated it for most of the day, definitely delicious and just enough kick.

Rating: 4
Oh my yumminess! This was exceptional, and if I could give it more than 4 forks I would. I used red miso and minced garlic and ginger. I poked the chicken breast before covering it in marinade, and the flavor was bold, rich and memorable. I will certainly prepare this again, and it goes in my list of "cook this to impress others!" foods.

I couldn't find miso paste so instead used a packet of instant miso soup. It still tasted wonderful and everyone enjoyed it. I made this last night and then today I found miso paste in a local Asian market so I can try this recipe again.

In the Marinade it calls for Miso paste (Preferably Kochujang)....Well Miso paste is made out of Beans, and Kochujang is made out of Chilli pepers. Bottom line..Miso and Kochujang has totally different taste and flavor.

I made this recipe exactly as directed except that I used instant miso, and I pulled out my George Foreman grill and grilled the chicken rather than sauteeing it. It was FABULOUS! My husband and 4-year-old son loved it.

Delicious! I marinated overnight, so it was particularly miso-y. Also, and I know people will shudder, but I used instant miso because it was all I could find at Harris Teeter and I wasn't going further. Served with satsumaimo amani (boiled/steamed sweet potatoes with soy sauce and sugar) and bok choy.

have made this twice now, 1st time exactly to recipe, thought it did not have much flavor even though i let it marinate for 3-4 hours; 2nd time i added beer in equal amounts to miso paste, it had more flavor but was still nothing special ... will continue to play with the recipe

I'm a bit sorry to say this, but you should know--Kochujang is actually Korean red pepper paste (not very hot), but less salty (more savory) than miso. Miso is the Japanese name for Korean Daengjang (fermented bean paste). While both are fairly interchangeable, there are several varieties (w/out bonito, for ex.) He definitely used Kochujang (see color in the pic). And there's no such thing as 'spicy' miso paste. While I applaud fusion cooking as a means to expand tastes and repertoires, I am a bit irritated by the lack of research and sloppy work on the part of some chefs, which betray a lack of real deep food knowledge or interest!

Quite good. Easy to make and pleasing to all who ate it. Perhaps a bit on the salty side...too much miso paste? However I was the only one of the 6 eating this meal who thought so. Planning to make again soon perhaps with 3/4ths the miso paste for comparison. The edamame salad was a hit as well.

This recipe, and the Roasted Corn and Edamame Salad, are both EXCELLENT! Very easy to make too. I added ginger, garlic and chili sauce to taste, not as listed here. Also, needed to double the sauce to have enough.

This is a great recipe for a quick midweek meal. I have relied on it many times when I want to eat healthfully but don't have a lot of time or energy to invest. Very tasty. Most important tip is to make sure you have quality sesame oil. Like olive oil, good quality oil can make all the difference in a marinade. I also added chili sauce on top of red pepper flakes and enjoyed it. My miso paste: Yamabuki. My sesame oil: San-J. My chli oil: Lan-Yu.

I did not find this recipe difficult at all. It was rather easy except as mentioned, you need to add broth of some sort to create a marinade, other wise you do get a paste. GREAT flavor!

This was okay. It tasted fine, but it was a lot of work for what ultimately tasted very similar to the good teriyaki sauce I can get from Trader Joe's. The marinade also turned out like a paste, and it was not an option to "pour" it, so I smeared. It was good, but since I can get almost the exact same results out of a bottle, I probably will not make this again.

This is a really good quick and easy healthy recipe. I added 2 tbsp low sodium fat free chicken broth and marinated the chicken all day. I also grilled it which eliminated the need for oil. Yummy!

This is a great recipe. I've made it many times this summer on the BBQ, and have also added it to salad with mixed greens and grilled veg with a sesame dressing. It has definitely secured a regular spot in our meal rotation!
