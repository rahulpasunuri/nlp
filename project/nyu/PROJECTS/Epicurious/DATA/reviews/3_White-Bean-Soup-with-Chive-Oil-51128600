Loved it. Agrees with others that amount of broth sound like an error. I used a vegetarian broth and almond milk instead of chicken broth and 1/2&1/2. Served it to my dinner party. Very well received.

Loved this soup. Used only 3 cups of chicken stock. Rosemary and thyme are VERY strong spices, so a light hand is the way to go. Pureed soup with hand blender. Very easy and delicious.

Made exactly as written. 11 cups was far too much chicken broth, mine was too soupy and therefore not creamy at all. It tasted weak and watered down. IF I made again I would reduce the broth to 6-8 cups. Very disappointing and it makes a ton. The chive oil adds nothing special and also somehow lacked the flavor punch I was looking for. Not recommended!

This soup is wonderful. I did use 3 Tbl. bacon grease instead of olive oil to saute the vegetables. It tastes very fresh and earthy and we had it with toasted homemade oatmeal bread and freshly made apple butter.
