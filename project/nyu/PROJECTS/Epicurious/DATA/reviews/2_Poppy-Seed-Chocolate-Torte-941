I love the idea of chocolate and poppy seeds, but this cake was not very chocolate-y. It tasted rather like a chocolate-poppy seed quiche; very eggy.

This cake tasted fine, but all of my poor poppy seeds settled to the bottom of the cake during baking, which made the texture less than pleasant.

An unusual dessert and very good.
