I love this recipe! I was in a hurry to make an icing and I saw this recipe and it turned out great in only a matter of minutes! I can't wait to use this recipe for cookies and cakes as well!

I made the cookies and icing in 1998 and my family keeps asking for them! WARNING: They can be addictive! : )

Mmmm... For me - who really isn't fond of icing - this was very tasty! It was wonderful for my Easter sugar cookies... I was dubious about the salt but a 1/4 tsp really brings out the almond flavor and cuts the sweetness a bit. Will definitely use this every time I need to decorate cookies-

This was delicious, and also very easy to make! It made a wonderful toping for my Almond pound cake! We can't wait to try it with the Christmas Tree Shortbread.
