I can´t say I made this recipe as I did not have the red Holland chiles, but my sambal was absolutely delicious anyways. I only had one red Thai chile and half a sweet red pepper, so I chopped finely and mixed them together. Then I followed the recipe as is. All the chopping is worth it. I should have used less of the sweet red pepper as it wasn´t spicy enough for me, but everyone else enjoyed it.
