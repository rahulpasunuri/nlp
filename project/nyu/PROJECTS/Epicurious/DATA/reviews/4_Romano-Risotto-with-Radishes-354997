Maybe my radishes weren't peppery enough, but I thought this pairing was bizarre. Sounded bizarre, but I hoped for the best and was disappointed. Don't bother with the radishes (and all the tedious chopping) and just make a great risotto instead.

Competent straightforward risotto recipe. Good. Radishes a good garnish.

Wow, I do not see the allure to this receipe. The risotto turned out very bland and while the radishes were an interesting touch, I found myself really missing some vegetables. Next time I will stick with a risotto with zucchini and peas (or other veggies) and just add the radishes if it seems appropriate still.

I love this recipe. Just made it tonight, for the second time. I skipped the butter at the end, and added in the radish tops (I sauteed them with the onions and garlic). I also added a little extra vinegar, which makes the radish/chive mix a bit more like a salad mix that you throw on top of the creamy risotto. A great way to eat radishes.

This was a very easy, tasty risotto recipe. Would definitely make again. The radishes were surprisingly delicious in it too.

Very easy and yummy. When I started cooking I realized that I did not have onions and I took a risk. I added finely chopped eggplant (I know, it was a long shot) but it actually worked. My guests loved it. I would like to make it again with onions just to see what it would be like.

simple and delicious. I found that i didn't need all three tbsp of butter to mix in at the end. It was plenty rich with only 1 tbsp, I might skip the butter at the end altogether next time. I added two shredded chicken breasts to the risotto at the beginning and I think they added to the savory taste--and made it more of a complete entree. also, since I was too lazy to get to the market for radishes, I served the risotto over red chard and carrots that had been simmered in the leftover chicken broth with roasted garlic. The bite of the chard provided a nice contrast to the warm, creamy risotto. It was a hit, will definitely make again.

Perfect as is. The sharpness of the radishes balances out the heaviness of the pasta. Nice texture, too. This is my new favorite risotto recipe.

Wonderful recipe! I sliced the radishes using my food processor and used them in rounds instead of in julienne. Amazing presentation!

I had asiago in the fridge, so used that instead of romano. The result may not have represented the recipe, but it tasted delicious. The fat and cream in the risotto cut the bitterness of the radish, and the bitter radish gave the risotto a bit of a fresh flavor. I served it with a simple green salad and it made a nice meal of comfort food that almost felt healthy.

I loved this. I halved the recipe but kept the Pecorino Romano at 1/2 cup. The combination of risotto and radishes was amazing and unexpected.

This recipe turned out great-- substituted garlic herb butter and added some rehydrated mushrooms and their broth. The radishes add a fresh crunch, and the sharpness and spiciness of the vinegared radishes are a really nice contrast to the creamy risotto.
