Nothing special here. Amaretto didn't make a difference to the pudding, but it was quite tasty in the whipping cream.

Too easy and so wonderful. Tried the Grand Marnier as suggested earlier (thanks for the tip) and it is fantastic.

Ridiculously easy, delicious, gourmet-tasting. Have made it many times, with assorted liquors, to the delight of my family. Makes up for some of those 2 day, 15-ingredient, "dare you to figure our your own shortcut", recipes. Try it, you'll like it, Martha.

i substituted rum for amaretto, and on a second time through i would not do that. i thought this was a quick and very tasty recipe.

The amaretto was a bit strong. Next time I would try 4 tablespoons instead of 7. Very easy and fast.

This was insanely easy and really good. I couldn't find any good raspberries, so we had Bing cherries on the side, which was a good flavor combination, also. A couple of my family members said it was too amaretto-y, and they felt like they could light their breath on fire, so maybe you could consider cutting back on the alcohol. Then again, maybe my family memebers are just picky ingrates who don't deserve homemade desssert ever again!

Super way to get a great dessert in a few minutes! Don't think anyone would know it began with boxed pudding mix. I used the larger size pudding box and increased the other ingredients by 1/2. Easy to do, and it yielded 4 very generous servings plus "leftovers". Perhaps more accurate to say would serve 6 dainty eaters!

Leave it to Epicurious... Staring at the sad looking box of cook and serve chocolate pudding my post-surgery father had requested for dessert, I did a quick search here to see whether Bon Appetite or Gourmet ever published a doctored version I could use. Low and behold, the first recipe that came up was simple and absolutely delicious way to make a quick dessert into an epicurean one, too! My parents didn't have any Amaretto, so I substituted Godiva White Chocolate Liqueur-- absolutely delicious! I'm going to try it with Frangelico next, and then Grand Marnier, and then... yummy!

The dish is a little too sweet for my taste, but my guests liked it and you can't beat it for ease. I think the next time I make it, and I will, I'll play around with the alcohol used. Maybe Grand Marnier for an orange taste? Rum for a little more "punch"? A good desert for unexpected guests, but not something that I think is impressive enough for for that "special" dinner party.

I have also made this numerous times, and I absolutely love it. I recently substituted Kahlua for the amaretto with great success. EASY, DELICIOUS, MAKE-AHEAD dish.

This is tasty and couldn't be any easier to make! I would definately make this again.

Since I first made it in 1995, this recipe has become a staple for company. I've probably made it 25 times in the last 4 years. I LOVE the taste, and it's so easy to make. It's a real winner.
