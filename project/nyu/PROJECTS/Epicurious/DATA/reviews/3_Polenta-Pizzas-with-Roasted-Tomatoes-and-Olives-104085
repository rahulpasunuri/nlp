I actually made this as a main course and added some chopped kielbasa to the topping. It was great! I also just cut the polenta into squares instead of cutting out circles- this way we didn't waste any. If you don't have the time to roast the tomatoes for 2 hours, you can increase the heat and roast faster (375 for an hour or so works well)

I made this for Valentines day and used a heart shaped cookie cutter for the polenta. Loved the roasted tomatoes.

This was a great looking and tasty appetizer. I made it for a "pot-luck" cocktail party. I thought (and the other guests did as well) that the "pizzas" had a wonderful flavor. I made the recipe exactly as is, but next time I would decrease the oregano just a bit to 1 1/2 teaspoons. For polenta first-timers, please be aware that some of the brands cook faster than others !

I really liked the presentation of the recipe. I ran out of time to roast my tomatoes but substituted a sun-dried tomato spread instead. The dish came out a bit salty from the spread and the olives. I'll do it again but maybe rinse out the olives before adding them.

This dish was a big hit as part of an appetizer buffet. They looked beautiful and tasted great. I used Provencal seasoned black olives which I like better than kalamatas. A side note to the person who gave this one star: It sounds like the reason that you didn't like this is you don't care for polenta or you are unfamiliar with what it is. For many of us, the polenta is what makes this dish interesting and different. Your food tastes may be better suited to a standard pizza.

I made this for a party and got rave reviews. I roasted the tomatoes in a hotter oven for a shorter time to cut down on prep time. Also used Kalamata olives,

The cornmeal "dough" was a letdown. I would leaven the dough to make it rise and give it some character. Also, I would add red onions and bits of sausage, pepperoni, or other meat to spice it up.

This is a really different appetizer - and a party full of people I had never met before raved about it. I wasn't really sure if the polenta was done because it never "pulled away from the sides of the pan", but it was fine. I found they were better if I reduced the heat to 400 and baked for 12-15 minutes. They tended to burn and not completely heat through at the higher temperature called for in the recipe.

My husband and I both enjoyed this relatively-healthy appetizer. I made a double batch of corn meal and it took about 30 minutes to thicken appropriately. I still only got 24 2-inch appetizers. This was a wonderful way to use the last of our garden tomatoes.

These were quite yummy and turned out just like the picture in the magazine. They were easy to make, not too fiddly, very colorful and lovely tasting. I used Kalamata olives because that is all I had on hand and they were a fine substitution. I would make them again for sure.
