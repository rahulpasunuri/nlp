Great recipe that I would try over and over again. I made a couple of changes like substituting the vanilla bean with 1tsp. Vanilla extract, adding plum wine and using a variety of plums. I reviewed the recipe on my blog and have recipes for it too. Stop by if you are interested, http://spiciefoodie.blogspot.com/ and thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it was fantastic!

We made this with white plums instead of red and it was delicious! Everyone loves it!
