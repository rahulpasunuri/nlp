I've made this several times following recipe to the T, and each time, to rave reviews of guests. It's not something that you can prepare totally ahead of time, but you can make the dressing earlier in the day, and wait until closer to serving time to prepare the rest of the recipe to prevent it from getting sticky and mushy. A great side for any occasion!

I made only the dressing to use on a chilled shrimp & vegetable salad (snow peas, broccoli, napa cabbage, red bell peppers, cilantro, green onion and crushed peanuts)to take to work. I used water instead of chicken stock (50% called for in the recipe) to thin it out because I didn't fell like opening the huge can of chix stock I had on hand. I was very pleased with the dressing flavor, and I printed it out so I can make this again!

Taking the tip from other Pan-Asian recipes, I added 1T of lime juice and it was fab. Whole family enjoyed it. Be sure to chill it. Might try diced cucumber next time.

Made this tonight for dinner and thought it was terrible, with an overpowering soy sauce flavor. We definitely followed the recipe so I'm puzzled by all the positive reviews. I guess I'll chalk it up to "different strokes".

I thought this was a good base to start from; just didn't have enough oomph for me. Added a 1/2 lime juiced, dbled. ginger, added garlic and maybe teaspoon of schiracha. Used a hand blender to whizz up. Then I thought it was great and will make again. Definitely, fresh cilantro makes a difference.

This was edible. I used crunchy peanut butter cos that's all I had and a yellow pepper instead of an orange one and had no green onions. Everything else was done as described. I'm not sure why everyone's raving about this. I ate it because I was hungry but wouldn't make it ever.

I used this recipe for the sauce and then threw in some pasta, zucchini, cabbage, cilantro, red peppers, and carrots. I also added cubed tofu breaded in cornstarch. It was delicious! I think this would make an awesome brown bag lunch or picnic dish.

Pretty good. If adding chicken or shrimp, I recommend making 1.5 servings of sauce so that it doesn't dry out. I feel that it's best when served right after you cook it otherwise it gets mushy. Make sure the noodles are cooked al dente or again, you will get mush. Next time I will substitute sriracha sauce for the cayenne, add a clove of chopped garlic, and add a tablespoon of toasted sesame seeds. I think I will also substitute shredded carrots for the matchstick peppers, as I am not a big bell pepper fan and I don't feel that they added much. Oh, tried this heated up....meh....not so good.

I just made this for a reunion with all our Asian friends. Oh, my! Everyone loved it and it went very quickly. My husband thought it was better than the version we always order at our favorite restaurant. I kept it on the mild side as half the eaters were kids. Also, I used Veri Veri Teriyaki sauce in place of the soy sauce. No lettuce leaves for us...we just heaped it on plates. So very delicious! This has a permanent place in our family's repertoire.

Rating: 3
Delicious! Made it as directed, the only modification I made was to use garlic chili paste instead of cayenne. I needed to make another batch of sauce as the noodles were not dressed enough for my taste (so much for low cal).

I'm eating this at my computer. This is amazing. Kids really like it. Fast and easy and you can use whatever you have in your crisper to change it up. This is going into my rotation.

2nd review on this. I now use Lee Kum Kee Chili Garlic Sauce instead of the pepper flakes and omit the sugar. I also make 50% more sauce and add shredded chicken, poached in chicken broth, ginger and a dash of soy.

This salad is delicious! I used veggie stock to make this salad vegetarian. I also add tofu coated in corn starch and pan fried to add extra protein to make it a meal.. in addition I like to add broccoli slaw.

Sauted 1-2 cloves of garlic and ginger for a minute or two and added it to the sauce along with a Tbsp. or so of chili garlic sauce and juiced 1/2 a lime. In addition, mixed in cooked, cut up chicken and blanched matchstick cut carrots. Yum!

Rating: 4
My guests loved this and happily had seconds, even though I prepared it as the first of three courses I was going to serve! While I was preparing the dressing, I found it to be a bit too salty, so I'll probably cut back on the soy sauce next time. It definitely helps to warm the ingredients for the dressing so it's easier to mix.

Rating: 4
I followed prior reviewers' suggestions and notes--- used water plus a bit of extra salt instead of chicken broth, added more red/yellow pepper, shredded carrots, shredded zucchini, a few cloves of minced garlic, srichacha sauce instead of the cayenne. Too lazy to plate with the lettuce, and forgot to buy peanuts. Also, the kids ate it too!

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe and was delighted with the results. This is a yummy salad and perfect for a light summer meal. I would add sauteed chicken breast strips next time and make it a complete meal. The flavor of the dressing is exceptional!

Rating: 3
I served this tonight for a light summer dinner for my family. They are tough bunch of critics. We all agreed that next time I will decrease the amount of vinegar and heat up the sauce as suggested by the cook from Michigan. I believe it will make the sauce a bit creamier. Other than that it was great! I added some shelled edamame, grated carrot and a few peas. served it with some sauteed scallops and it was a nice easy summer meal.

Rating: 3
I agree with all the good reviews as far as flavor goes. I did not change anything about the recipe. When I make it again, and I will, I will wait till I am putting it on the table before I add the sauce--I added the sauce, tossed it, and refrigerated it until dinner time and the sauce got too thick. (I should have predicted that the peanut butter would do that). Several reviewers suggested adding more sesame oil and soy sauce to thin the sauce so I will try that.

Whoops - the review below is mine; I forgot to give it a fork rating (four!).

Delicious! I served this to 12 guests who enjoyed the heck out of it, and several asked for the recipe. The peanut sauce is one of the best I've had. I added some extra vegetables (julienned red pepper, carrots and cukes) and based on my previous peanut sauce experiences, I found that the sauce came together easier when the peanut butter was heated slightly with the wet ingredients (except the sesame oil) before blending and adding the other ingredients. I'll definitely make this again.

This is the best version of this cold peanut-noodle salad I have found, including several on this website. I made it for a casual luncheon and it completely disappeared with many requests for the recipe. I roasted and shredded some chicken breasts to serve alongside for those wishing to make it a main dish--well-received.

Rating: 3
I made significant alterations to this recipe based on reviews and what was available in my kitchen, but the peanut sauce base is a keeper. Easy, quick, filling, and delicious. The only change I made to the sauce was substituting ginger infused simple syrup in place of the sugar and fresh ginger. I used rice noodles instead of traditional pasta, and traded in the red pepper for sauteed carrots and celery and fresh cucumber. I also added shrimp to the top sauteed with lots of garlic (I didn't have spring onions) and five-spice powder. Despite the liberties I took with the recipe, it tasted great. I would definitely make some version of this again.

I made this for a cookout and everyone loved it, especially the men. It is spicier than I expected, but that's a serious part of the charm. I also like the mix of textures...creamy, crunchy, soft, crisp. Very easy and I will make again

Rating: 2
I made this exactly as per recipe specs minus the bell pepper. Flavor is good, but texture is too gloppy. Perhaps it depends on the peanut butter you are using; I used Kirkland creamy organic. Next time, I will use 4 TBSP peanut butter and 3/4 cup broth.

I loved this. I followed other reviewers and used 5T of peanut butter, although I think I might try the full 6T next time.

Rating: 1
The flavor was pretty good. However, the texture was somewhat of a turn-off to me. It retained too much of a creaminess from the peanut butter and was really thick. Not that it should have been runny, but not as thick as it was. If i were to make it again, which i dont intend to, i would use a little less peanut butter.

Rating: 4
This recipe was delicious as-is, however, consider adding a bit more chicken broth and soy sauce if you'd like to thin the sauce a bit. Chili paste would also be a nice addition to make it a bit spicier.

I love this recipe. Since coming across it 2 weeks ago, I have made it 4 times for various groups of people. I never have any leftovers. I have used Kecap manis for this (Indonesian sweet soy sauce) and wheat pasta, both which have turned out great. People love the colors in this dish as well. Easy and it tastes great, what else do you need?

Dressing is fantastic! I did add some garlic and only used 5 tbs of peanut butter at suggestion of others. Next time I would use an asian noodle or at least a thinner one and also would add a lot more veggies. But it was quick, easy, and good!

Enjoyed this recipe. Added more soy sauce, sesame oil, and broth as it seemed overwhelmed by the peanut butter. Also added minced garlic. Made this with rice vermicelli noodles & served with chicken marinated in soy sauce, vinegar, garlic. Served warm & definitely plan on making it in the future!

A delicious twist on boring old pasta salad. Made it with campinelli noodles for a party and guests loved it. Much better served at room temperature than cold, and it is also not bad heated up. If you must make ahead I would suggest making the sauce the day before, and refrigerating it, and then allow to reach room temp before pouring it over freshly made noodles. It tastes much better fresh.

Rating: 4
I used chunky peanut butter because it was all I had. I used the food processor to blend the sauce and it was fantastic.

Rating: 4
I omitted the lettuce and just used a very small pepper (all I had) so essentially just made noodles and peanut sauce and the sauce was amazing. The cilantro and peanuts added texture but were not essential for the taste. Don't use more than 8 oz of noodles though unless you plan on making more sauce. Two thumbs up!

Rating: 4
This recipe is 4 forks with a few minor changes/additions. I used fusilli pasta because this pasta "grabs" some of the sauce. I hate cilantro so I substituted parsley, much better. I added a generous amount of chopped garlic and lime juice. Don't skimp here. I added chopped rotisserie chicken to make this a complete meal. YUM! YUM! YUM!

I often used to get cravings for peanut-sesame noodles from a great little place in downtown Charlottesville. I can't always get downtown on a whim though, so I tried a few different recipes at home myself - and these noodles were the best, I dare say even better than the ones I used to buy in town. And so easy! I left out the cayenne because I wanted something cool, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I foresee this becoming a staple in my diet!

If there were a 3.5 star option, that's what I would give this. It's really tasty and easy to make -- and even non-pasta fans like it. I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers to add shredded chicken and carrots, which filled this out into a great warm-weather main dish.

Love this recipe!! I put shredded chicken in it as well but otherwise leave it as is. Even my nephew, who hates anything spicy, loved it when I substituted ground ginger for fresh and chili powder for cayenne. Took the heat down but still maintained the flavor. I always look forward to leftovers with this one as the flavors really develop overnight.

I would suggest adding some fish sauce and substituting brown sugar for regular sugar. We love spicy food so I also added some thai red curry paste and chili garlic sauce. Awesome recipe will definitely make it again, I also added some oriental frozen vegetables just before draining the linguini...yummy.....can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow

Definitely a dish that can be prepared the night before and picks up more flavor as well as one that you can add all sorts of veggies to your own taste. We commented that adding chicken would have made it great too. I made it for a Christmas Eve party I hosted and the spicy aspect definitely turned away those less tolerant. Great stuff!

This is one of my favorite pasta salads! When making as an entree, I'll serve it hot and add chicken, sauteed onions, and broccoli.

The recipe says not to use old fashioned or freshly ground peanut butter. I don't like to buy the other brands because of the added hydrogenated fat. I used old fashioned peanut butter for this recipe and it worked just fine. I put all the dressing ingredients in a tall container and used my stick blender to combine everything. Worked like a charm! I took the salad to a neighborhood bbq and everyone commented on how good it was.

I liked this recipe because it was quick and I had all the ingredients in the pantry and you can do so many variations. I added chicken and fresh mint and basil because I didn't have much cilantro on hand (the mint tastes really great). I am going to make it again tomorrow for a bbq and I might add a little hoisin sauce and sesame seeds this time and try a thinner noodle.

Rating: 3
I really liked it with the cabbage and carrots...it gave it great texture. I would like to make it with some cut up chicken breasts, even just the ready made kind--there is enough sauce left over to coat it. I don't know that I liked using the lettuc leaves. it was nice presentation but it made it harder to toss to spread the sauce and nuts and cilantro.

I found this recipe when looking for a "pasta" dish for which I already had the ingredients. Made the sauce exactly as indicated (although I did have to use the dreaded bouillon cube for chicken broth), put all the ingredients but the broth in the cuisinart and whipped it up. (I whisked the broth in afterward to keep from splashing the entire kitchen.) I served it over rice noodles (pad thai size) with shredded carrots. Delicious. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious. Makes a lot of sauce. If making ahead and refrigerating it becomes quite dry so save some of the sauce to add when serving.

Finally, a great recipe for noodles in peanut sauce! Recipe is delicious as is, but it could use a bit more kick - I used plain rice wine vinegar, will try seasoned next time, plus a dash of hot chili oil. I would cut back a hair on the peanut butter only because the dressing was too thick (I thinned it with a little more chicken stock). Served with grilled chicken and mixed greens, this was fabulous! Will make over and over again for sure.

Scrumptious. If I could I'd give it 3.5 forks. I used whole wheat fettucine for a little more heft and, upon the advice of other reviewers, cut down the peanut butter by a tablespoon. I still ended up with enough sauce to have coated half again as much pasta. Bet it's great with chicken or shrimp - next time I'll try that.

I thought this was very good and very easy. The one problem I had with it was that there was too much of a peanut-buttery taste. I would cut the amount in half next time. I served this with the Asian chicken and water chestnut patties also listed on this site.
