Yuck. I made it as written as I was attracted to the simplicity and few ingredients (though a lot of pots). Not sure what I expected to happen but it's just a bunch of nice things in a dish. If I ate cheese I would have surely added some, that might have saved this dish but honestly, try something else.

Gave this 3 forks because my company loved it though I thought it too dry. I made a couple of changes: layered mashed sweet potatoes on the bottom, added gruyere to the quinoa-chard/kale mix and topped with toasted spelt breadcrumbs. Next time will add caramelized onions and maybe a drizzle of cream to add moisture.

For the reviewers who think a "gratin" requires cheese, or some kind of liquid (e.g. cream sauce), that is not correct. "Gratin" refers to the "crust", not the cheese (or sauce)... So this is DEFINITELY A "GRATIN." Here is a definition: "Gratin is a widely used culinary technique in food preparation in which an ingredient is topped with a browned crust, often using breadcrumbs, grated cheese, egg and/or butter. Gratin originated in French cuisine and is usually prepared in a shallow dish of some kind. A gratin is baked or cooked under an overhead grill or broiler to form a golden crust on top and is traditionally served in its baking dish. The etymology of gratin is from the French language in which the word 'gratter' meaning to 'to scrape' as of the 'scrapings' of bread or cheese, and gratiné, from the transitive verb form of the word for crust or skin." From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratin

i didn't follow the instructions but i used the ingredients and other reviews as a guide. i roasted cubes of sweet potato with oil and salt, sauteed the chard with oil and salt, cooked the quinoa, layered them in a casserole pan, topped it with gruyere (not breadcrumbs), baked it for 10 minutes and then broiled for 5 minutes. served with a drizzle of really good aged balsamic. we loved it and the kids devoured it!

I made several changes but used this recipe as a base--I made the quinoa in my rice cooker. I only got 1 sweet potato in my CSA, so I used that, along with 2 smaller red potatoes. To save time, I chopped those into chunks and boiled to soften before mashing, and then added nutmeg, cinnamon and hot paprika to taste, as well as 3 tbsp butter and 250g of soft tofu for some extra protein. I layered half of the chard mix, then the sweet potato mix, then the rest of teh chard. I put about 1.5 cups of shredded cheddar on top-- I think gruyere would have been better, but cheddar was what I had :) Then put some ground flax on top, as I'm gluten=free but i wanted the texture. Came out quite tasty!

It was very good, but I thought a gratin had cheese in it. I didn't have sweet potatoes so I mixed in carrots sliced about 1/8" thick and cooked in the microwave. I added the garlic to the stems 1 minute before adding the leaves. I used red and green chard. It needs more quinoa. Next time I'll use twice as much. I used Tuscan herb olive oil and drizzled some on top after baking. This doesn't even need baking, it's good just sauteed.

Had it just been for me, I would have rated this 3 forks, but my husband, who truly likes most everything, couldn't eat it because of the texture (it made him gag!). But I really did like it, and it was indeed better the second day. I made a ton of changes to the recipe, as per the suggestions of others. I added gruyere cheese underneath the breadcrumbs, which I thought was wonderful. I added black eyed peas to the quinoa mixture to add ever more protein. And I used collards instead of swiss chard because I had some on hand. I think my husband would have liked the dish better if I had followed the suggestion of other folks to roast the sweet potatoes and not puree them. If this had something a little bit more substantial, like a crust or something to chew on, the gag factor would decrease for those sensitive to texture.

Def. not a "gratin". This should be called a casserole. Made this w/o modifying ingredients (had lots of chard in the garden). Did do what others suggested and scallop potatoes in some butter. Then I mashed them. Could've used a few more sweet potatoes to balance out the earthiness of the chard. I liked the breadcrumbs on top, gave the dish a crunch against all the other soft ingredients. Overall thought it was quite good, but missing that extra something. Maybe some fresh herbs. Others used cheese on the top layer. I could see how that could really give the dish the zing it needs. Finally, I didn't find this particularly time consuming. Maybe 30 min prep time. Overall, I'd be willing to give it another shot b/c it has potential.

I made many of the changes that other reviewers suggested, and it turned out very well. I mixed a bit of cream and butter into the mashed sweet potatoes and layered them on the bottom. I topped that with the chard mixture, grated gruyere and breadcrumbs. It was very tasty -- and colorful! The red and green of the chard next to the orange of the sweet potatoes was truly special. Like other reviewers, I sliced the potatoes for faster cooking. But next time I think I'll bake them in their skins -- they turned a bit gray. I'd give it four forks, but it is, as others have pointed out, very time consuming. But warm and hearty and delicious, and I'll probably make it again.

Why is this calle a gratin? A gratin is a dish covered in liquid (usually cream or a cream based sauce) & baked until browned on top. I made this time consuming dish as a way to eat some quinoa, but is was not worth the time or trouble.

I read all of the reviews, and modified the recipe accordingly. I thinly sliced the sweet potatoes using a mandolin. I substituted kale and beet greens for the Swiss chard. I mixed a small amount of half and half and about a 1/4 C provolone cheese into the greens mixture before mixing it with the quinoa. I added caramelized onions to the greens mixture as well. I layered the sliced sweet potatoes on the bottom of the pan, spread the greens mixture, and topped it off with another layer of sweet potatoes and the breadcrumbs. I mixed 2T of flax seeds into the breadcrumbs for extra nutritional value and taste. With these modifications this was an impressive dish. Even better the next day as leftovers.

Although labor intensive, I thought the end result was excellent...with several alterations. First, I used swiss chard and kale and I added gruyere after I mixed the greens with the quinoa. I layered the greens mixture on the bottom, followed by a layer of caramelized onions, then the yams (which I mashed w/ a tbs of butter and a splash of milk)and topped it all off w/ panko breadcrumbs (but fresh would've been better).

I thought this recipe was delicious, with a few changes. I followed the below recommendations and added gouda and used panko instead of breadbrumbs. I also cut the yams thinkly, alhtough next time I'd probably leave them out altogether and just use the quinoa mizture. I also added about 1 tbsp of fresh rosemary to the swiss chard, which definitely added some great flavor.

I followed the suggestions of a couple of previous reviews and 1) sliced my yams very thin and used them like that instead of baking and mashing beforehand, and 2) added some gouda under the breadcrumbs. Also I used panko breadcrumbs which stay very crunchy. And it was delicious! I will make this dish again and again.

Even with the addition of oregano and thyme to the gratin, this dish was quite bland and the texture was nothing to write home about. It needs some serious tweaking, if it can be salvaged at all

Delicious! I reduced the number of steps, and the cooking time, by slicing the sweet potatoes (scalloped potatoes style) and baking them right in the casserole dish. Then I just added the quinoa/chard mixture and breadcrumbs in layers. Healthy and good!

I've made this dish twice; once used fresh spinach with some frozen spinach to fill out, and I thought the recipe was very good, but a little bland. The second time I used all rainbow chard and added 5 ounces of shredded smoked gouda, under the bread crumbs. The second was definitely the way I'll make from now on. The flavour and texture of the chard stems, bread crumbs, cheese, quinoa and potato is great; makes good leftovers too. Prep time can be a little long - but I like spending time in the kitchen. You could speed this up dramatically by chopping the chard stems in the food processor, after crumbing the bread, then grating the cheese in the processor (each separately.) Do season to taste, with kosher or sea salt and fresh pepper. Serve with a non-oaky chardonney or a white Rioja. This would also be a good veggie dinner party entree or a great Thanksgiving side dish; for a party, just prep all ingredients ahead of time - take 10 min to put it in the casserole and bake.

The swiss chard and quinoa mixture was very good. I would skip the sweet potato part and serve the quinoa and chard as a side dish. I used rainbow chard for great color.

I dunno - I found it easy to make and quite tasty. I agree with the "fresh breadcrumb" comment - one cannot use storebought dry crumbs and expect it to come out right.

Rating: 3
I was hesitant to make this in view of other negative reviews. However, I found it easy to make, not time consuming at all and the reason people are having problems with breadcrumbs is that they're obviously using the kind you buy in the supermarket, rather than course, fresh, breadcrumbs. It's tasty, extremely nutritious and loaded with potassium for you fitness buffs.

Delicious, straightforward & incredibly healthy! Don't salt the water when you boil the quinoa though...just salt entire dish before adding the breadcrumbs.

I admit that I substituted spinach for the chard, but this was one of the worst recipes I've ever made! Shame on you, Gourmet!! It took forever to prepare and tasted bland. So many breadcrumbs made it very dry. Awful.

We loved the combination of flavors. Would definetly serve to company; however with two changes. Cook the quinoa in chicken stock for added flavor and decreasd the bread crumbs to about 1/2 cup. It was even better the next day!

I have to agree w/ everyone's comments on this recipe. For vegetarians, it's worth making, since it's very nutritious. BUT, it's MUCH too time consuming. To speed things up, I used 1, 10 oz. pkg. frozen, chopped spinach, cooked in the mircro. Stick the potatoes in the oven or micro (or cook them the night before). While the quinoa is cooking, saute the garlic & mix the spinach into it. Mash the potatoes w/ the cooked spinach, stir in the quinoa, scrape it into the baking & follow remaining instructions. I think tofu cubes might be a nice addition to the topping & if you mixed wheat germ into the bread crumbs, it would be more nutritious. Speeding things up makes this recipe worth it - the original is rediculously overinvolved in its preparation.

This dish took a lot of effort and, although I added extra garlic, it was not particularly flavorful. I ended up needing only a small portion of the breadcrumbs.

The dish was a little more time consuming than what I am used to preparing, but it was a good main dish for this vegetarian family. I love using quinoa in my dishes.

I found this recipe to be too much work for such a bland, flavourless experience.

I used collard greens instead of swiss chard. Don't use as much salt as called for in the recipe. The sweet potatoes really complement the quinoa/greens. My husband really liked it.
