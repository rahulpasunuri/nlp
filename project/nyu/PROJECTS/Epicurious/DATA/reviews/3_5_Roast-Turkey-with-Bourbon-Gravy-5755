Nice basic turkey recipe when you don't have time to do the fancy stuff like brining etc. The gravy was good. I used home made chicken broth instead of turkey broth since that's what I had and it was fine. I cooked the turkey until it was almost done (3 hrs for a 13 lb bird unstuffed) and then I uncovered the bird and cooked it about another 20 minutes until it was golden brown.

Beautiful bird! Delicious gravy. All of my guests were impressed with the presentation and taste of this turkey and the gravy. I did not care for the stuffing recipe, but I will make the turkey and the gravy again exactly as written. A keeper!
