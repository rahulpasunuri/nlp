This was a good meal. I did not have the pomegranate seeds so I used dried cranberries instead, which was a great combo with the orange segments. The marinade for the lamb was also good. I did not grill the lamb, but used the broiler instead. I think the grill would have been better providing the smokey flavor. All in all, this is a good meal, great for a light summer dinner and good for company.

Made this two nights ago. The meal was ok - but last night we turned the leftovers into a delicious salad! Chopped the lamb, threw in the leftover relish with some cucumber, dressed with grapeseed oil, salt and fresh lemon juice - was BEYOND delish! Much better than the actual meal and a bit healthier!

I cooked this dish for my "recipe tasting club"! They absolutely loved it. I didn't particularly care for the pomegranate relish; however, it was very tasty when consumed with the lamb (not a la carte like I intially tired to eat it). The pinot noir marinade gives the lamb an awesome flavor. Although I served the lamb well done, I tried a piece med-rare and the next time I make this dish; or if I make it for myself- I will make it med-rare. As for the relish, the next time, I won't use the orange segments and will use less lemon juice. I feel that the citrus flavor ruins the mint-onion flavor which is AWESOME. I served this with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and green beans sauteed in olive oil with shallots. Absolutely delish!

This reciepe with the relish is on the lighter side of all lamb dishes. We did not have pomagranate seeds, so we substituted 2 Tbls flaxseed, ground in the mortar. We also added 1/2c of pine nuts to the relish. This reciepe is perfect for a hot summer day.

We just weren't that impressed with this. It was pretty good, but just wasn't great. We made the cider glazed lamb chops from this site a couple days before and liked that much better, plus it was far easier to make than this recipe.

This recipe was so great! I couldn't find pomegranate seeds, so I just made the recipe without it; it was fine! I added a bit more garlic which was also tasty. Highly recommend.

An outstanding lamb experience. The marinade and the relish create a unique taste that is quite different than the typical garlic and rosemary flavors that are usually associated with lamb. We made the marinade the night before and kept it in the refrigerator. The flavors all blended nicely and the extra time of "brewing" the marinade is worthwhile. We pecan smoked the lamb for about 10 minutes (medium rare) in a smoker grill. It is festive and light enough to withstand hearty associates. We paired this with wilted spinach that had a fresh garlic and butter sauce and with roasted root vegetables that were dusted with Cajun spices. Paired with a big shiraz. Happy New Year. I recommend taking the relish, which we prepared the day before, out of the refrigerator 2 hours prior to serving so that it is room temperature. We liked this recipe so much that I am wondering if I can vacuum pack and freeze some pomegranate seeds so that we can make this at another time.
