Also, I did not have any problems with the dip being too runny. It was the perfect consistency, I thought. I did not switch the mayo and the sour cream amounts, however, as some people did. Perhaps that is the reason why. I figured, you have a birthday once a year, so you can eat a little more fat!

I made this dip for my Grandpa's surprise 85th Birthday party. My sister in particular liked it so much that she requested it for Christmas Eve! So I am making it again for Christmas Eve. At first, I thought that the sesame oil was too overpowering, but when it all melded together overnight, the sesame was less pronouced. However, I will probably add a little less next time, 2 tsp instead of 1 tbsp. Sesame oil is notoriusly very strong, so a little goes a long way. Also, a bit more cayenne might be nice. I couldn't really taste it with all of the other flavours in the recipe.

While there were guests at our Thanksgiving dinner who enjoyed this dip, I was not one of them. I found it too runny to be a satisfying crudites dip. Though that is most likely due to the fact that I switched the quantities of mayo and sour cream. The sesame oil (I only added 1 1/2 tsp) dominated all the other flavors. I chose this recipe because I wanted a dip that was different from the typical sour cream/dill/ranch dips out there and I'm sorry I didn't keep looking. I guess I will keep playing around in the kitchen until I can find just the right combination of spices and flavors to compliment and enhance a plate full of crudites.

Tastes good and couldn't be easier to make. I think if you like Asian flavors, you'll like this one. I followed others' suggestions to swap quantities of mayo and sour cream and didn't miss the calories at all.

This was just ok/good, I might make a version of it again but would change proportions of most things-especially the sesame oil (use less). What was very good was mixing the leftover with some olive oil and water to thin it out and using as a salad dressing.

Excellent dip. I've been making it for years always to rave reviews. Wouldn't change a thing to the recipe

Flavor was great on this dip. I think that people stayed away from it because it LOOKS like onion dip (brown, sour cream based), but whoever ate it at my housewarming party loved it. Will make again for sure.

This is one of the most requested recipes I get from clients and friends to make. It's fabulous with asparagus, snow peas and celery. I've found that the women are especially crazy about this dip. Men, not so much.

A great tasting dip, especially when dipped with asparagus spears, celery, and peppers. I was looking for something simple to compliment an Asian dinner and this was perfect. This is not a dip for a potluck; would be harsh next to lasagna. I served sidecar cocktails and it was a perfect pairing.

This is a fabulous dip! I have made it several times to rave reviews. It is a wonderful change from the standard ranch, dill or onion dips that are usually served with vegetables.

This was definately different, some guests raved "the best dip they ever tasted", others could take or leave it. Worth a try a different dip.

Switched amounts of sour cream and mayo, and added a teaspoon of white miso. We love Oriental flavors and so do our guests, but this was not a hit. I think the sesame oil overpowered the other flavors in the dip. Probably won't make this again.

This was yummy. I used low-fat cottage cheese and just a tablespoon each of mayonnaise and sour cream, then added all the ingredients to the food processor. I also added a bit of cilantro, because I had it. It was delish!

This is different than "normal" dips. Some guests raved (and raved), others I think just found it "interesting". It was different. I would make again, at least a day ahead.

I loved this dip before I ever got it to the party, so was pleased that all there liked it too! I would give it three and a half forks if I could...it's not quite a four. I used half mayo, half sour cream, dried basil and stayed true to the rest of the recipe. Definitely a keeper.

I've made this recipe several times. It has a distinctive flavor. You either love it or not. I love it and so does almost everyone who tries it. It's a nice change from the sour cream vegetable dip that's usually served. I swapped the amounts of mayo and sour cream (used low-fat of both), reduced the amount of soy sauce to 1 T and used dried basil instead of fresh. I'm getting ready to make it now and can't find my original recipe I clipped from the magazine. Thank goodness I found it on-line.

Sort of an odd color, but once people tried it, it disappeared. Very tasty and great with the snow peas and cucumbers.

Really good. I used low sodium Tamari instead of soy, and it wasn't overly salty. Too late, I read the recommendation to swap the amounts of sour cream and mayo - it sounds like it would make it even better. I thought the dip tasted a lot like the dressing used on salads at hibachi-style Japanese restaurants, and could do double duty as such.

Really amazing - my favourite dip. I did, however, only use 1 Tbsp of soy sauce, and switched the quantities of mayo and sour cream - it made for a cleaner taste. It was beautiful with a mix of white and black sesame seeds on top.

This is one of my favorite recipes in the world! My mom suggested it when I was throwing an aisan themed cocktail party. It was a hit! I served it with snow peas, asparagus, cucumbers, brocoli, and carrots. In a world of onion and spincach dips, this really stands out. Highly recommended. And don't worry about how it looks - it's delicious.

I enjoyed this dip, although it wasn't fabulous. I didn't have any mayo or sour cream on hand, so instead used lowfat greek yogurt, which is super-thick, and lowfat ricotta cheese. It definitely had a good flavor, but the consistency was kind of runny (probably owing to the above substititions). Were I to make it again, I would still skip the mayo but use a sour cream / strained yogurt combo.

I loved this dip as a change from more traditional dips that i make all the time. Very easy to make, and tastes great when served with rice crackers. I've already made it a few times.

This dip got raves at a party served with crudites. Several guests asked for the recipe and since then, it has been served numerous times by people in our social circle. I'm serving it tonight with all the usual veggies as well as snap peas, edamame, and jicama.

I thought this was distinctly odd --tasted and looked weird. So I brought it to a gathering of college students together with some crudites. They just left it sitting there and ate everything else on the table. I had to throw it out. Believe me, college students will eat ANYTHING, but they sure snooted this.

It is very rare that I cannot salvage a recipe, but this one just couldn't be fixed. They just were not flavors we liked. The dip tasted kind of like it should be found on the inside of a sushi roll (and actually might be good that way), but as a veggie dip it just tasted all wrong.

I make this all the time and am completely mystified by any negative reviews. I got the recipe from a friend of mine who made it for a party. Now several of my friends all make it for parties. It's great!

I was looking for a dip for an asian themed cocktail party, and this was pretty much the only one I could find. Based on the previous complaints about the dip being too liquidly, I added the soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice wine vinegar very slowly to avoid ruining and probably only used about half of each. The dip served its purpose, adn was pretty good, but I probably wouldn't make again unless doing another asian theme- there are better dips out there

Rating: 1
Far too salty and liquidy for my preference. So I added more mayo and sour cream to fix it, but it still was too salty and liquidy. Threw it out. Luckily, I already had made other items to bring to the potluck...

I'm addicted, especially with the Eti Sesame Sticks! I've tried both low or non-fat and regular mayo and sour cream, and the low fat version was much thicker. In a pinch I've even tried with ground ginger and dried basil, and the end result was just as delicious.

Although this was a big hit at my party, I had about 3/4 c. of the dip leftover. I mixed it into 3-4 c. of shredded cabbage for a tasty Asian slaw. You could also add leftover crudites (chopped) to the slaw.

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes!Friends and family request it all the time and it's a surprising but welcome change from the usual ranch, artichoke, or onion dips. Definitely make it as early as possible, as the more time the flavors have to marry the better it tastes. Also, I've tried using low-fat alternatives - it tastes okay but is very runny and is more the consistency of salad dressing.

I made this dip 24 hours ahead and it turned out "okay." However the next day, it was awesome. I think maybe it thickened up a bit more, and the flavor got better too. It would also make a good different-tasting salad dressing.

Very fast and very good--I generally omit the basil and use Chinese chili paste w/garlic instead of the cayenne pepper, and I also (personal preference) use more sour cream than called for to cut the mayo taste. Think of this dip as the old standard onion dip with an updated flavor and you can't go wrong.

Incredibly easy (it took me 5 minutes to make the dip) and delicious! Mine came out a bit runny (my own fault, I used low-fat crème fraiche instead of sour cream), so it also made a good salad dressing. A definite I'd-eat-it-on-anything kind of dip/sauce.

I made this dip when I had my girlfriends over for movie night and everyone loved it! The sesame oil is what gives it a really different flavour from the ubiquitous onion dip.

Despite the rave reviews, I was disappointed with this dip, and it was hardly touched. For a dip with similar ingredients albeit spicier, and a chunkier consistency due to chopped eggplant, I would rather recommend "SZECHWAN-STYLE EGGPLANT WITH PITA WEDGES". It was much better received. Enjoy!

I substituted shiso, a Japanese herb, for basil. Shiso has a flavor midway between basil and cilantro and it's often paired with sesame. The substitution worked very nicely. The dip was a little bit too runny for my tastes, next time I'll reduce the amount of liquids slightly.
