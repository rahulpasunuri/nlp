My husband said this was the best thing I made him all Year! I only made the leek sauce, but oh my gosh, I can't believe something so simple could taste so amazing - it's even delicious on its own!

Rating: 3
While this was very tasty, it was rather involved and didn't need to be-the leeks sauce does not need to be put in a blender just place it under the salmon when serving-the salmon can be done in the saute pan. Asparagus was a delicious side.

Rating: 4
This was excellent-- a little labor intensive, but with a great payoff. I used skin-on salmon fillets, and thus only crusted the skinless side with the almond/parsley mix, sauteeing the skinless side for about 4-5 minutes before putting the fillets skin-side down on a foil covered cookie sheet and popping it in a 450 degree oven for about 12 minutes. It was perfect. I served this with green beans (crisp-steamed), to balance the richness of the sauce and fish, and it turned out scrumtrelescently. An attractive, impressive-looking dish. Can't wait to make this again.

This recipe was a ton of work and didn't turn out well at all. The leeks burnt quickly, as did the almond coating. The lemon sauce was tasty, but was time and labor intensive. I wouldn't suggest attempting this recipe unless you have a lot of time and patience on your hands.

Have used this recipe several times.Used this sauce recipe with the addition of 3 dill weed stems which I removed before blending the sauce ingredients. This time I paired this sauce with Baked Sea Bass With Walnut Breadcrumb Crust And Lemon-Dill Sauce (also available on this sight)and omitted their Lemon-Dill Sauce. This is also a fantastic combo. Yum,Yum go on try this combo you won't be disappointed.

Made this last night - super delicieux! straightforward and simple the leek was a great accompaniment, few comments: added more lemon juice - probably used juice of a whole lemon (I like salmon with lemony flavour) and after I had pan fried salmon I actually had to pop them in the oven for approx 30min - I guess our filets were too thick to cook completely...that worked out just fine because we ate our salad first. I really enjoyed this recipe and will make it again for my parents next week!

This is a great dish for a dinner party where you're not sure if everyone likes fish or not. I usually make half with salmon and half with chicken breasts - the sauce goes wonderfully with both.

We have made this dish many times. If we're in a hurry, we will skip the almond crust and use the sauce on a piece of grilled salmon instead.

I've been making this recipe since it first appeared in 2002. I really prefer it with halibut, as the lean fish makes it less heavy. I always panic when I find out that my parents are going to come down for dinner, as they prefer very simple American food, and I'm best known for making...un-American food, I guess. This is a great recipe to make for picky parents---not at all intimidating for less adventurous palates, but not at all boring for me and my husband. I could eat it every week. Delicious times 10!

The best!!!! I made this for a luncheon for 4 and everyone loved it. I made it exactly as directed, including the times and temps for cooking the salmon. The only thing I did differently was to prepare the fillets ahead of time and then refrigerated them until I cooked them. I had made the sauce the day before, so all I had to do once my guest arrived was cook the salmon and heat the sauce!

Outstanding. I had a diner party for 20 so needed to find a way to make this work easily given the size of the group and everything else I was making. I followed the receipe as-is until the final step. Instead of finishing it in the pan on the second side, I placed all of the filets on a baking sheet and placed the sheet in a hot oven. It was perfect.

Oh yeah. This baby is a keeper. Made plenty of sauce and what a yummy sauce it is. Watch your salmon while it's cooking - for me five minutes was a bit long for each side. My salmon fillets had skin on one side - just left it on and pressed the almond mixture to the non-skin side. Wonderful recipe. Big hit with my family.

Wonderful recipe - a little time- consuming but worth it. We had to make some substitutions since we didn't have exactly what the recipe called for. Used onion instead of leeks. We ground pecans in the processor and used them instead of almonds and I would recommend that. Better than almonds. Also, we didn't strain the sauce and it still tasted fantastic.

OMG!!! This was so good !! It had to be the best meal I had in ages. I was so surprised at the intensity of my reaction to it.

This is a great recipe!! I made it for our dinner club last weekend and it was a hit. I used Sockeye Salmon from the Copper River (yum!), and made the sauce ahead of time.

This is one of my favorite company recipes. I love the sauce and have served it with other things as well - it's best with the leeks but I've used shallots or onions also and it's fine. Make ahead: still need to pan fry the almond coating but can do this then finish in the oven.

This is a reliably good dinner for company, but it's not sinfully good as I would have expected of a recipe with four forks and 150+ reviews. The presentation is great. My sauce didn't have that nice yellow color as in the picture, however. It was a very pale yellow.

I made this recipe as written with the only exception being that I added grated lemon zest to the sauce as well and the whole family loved it. I would not skip the sauce - it is not that time consuming and the flavor is delicious. With sides (wild rice pilaf, green beans) this was too time consuming for a weeknight meal again, but it is definitely weekend worthy. Yum.

I think the sauce was absolutely wonderful.The only change I made was I added 3 stems of dill(which I removed before blending). By following the recipe exactly I had no trouble with splitting or curdling. This sauce was so delicious that it could turn a plain piece of steamed fish into a masterpiece.

Rating: 3
I first had this dish at a restaurant called Moxies where it is served over wild rice with vegetables - I loved it so much I searched for a similar recipe and found this - after making it I'd say the chefs at Moxie's must spend a fair amount of time searching recipes on the internet as well.

Rating: 3
very good - huband, mother and other company all loved. for sauce, added thyme, wine, broth - all in the name of trying to adjust it - it was too lemony for me. also simmered it for quite some time on VERY low, which added to the depth. for the fish, i chopped the nuts very finely, brushed the fish with oil, as another cook recommended, sauteed quickly in a non stick saute pan, and finished in a 400 degree oven. FANTASTIC!!

Rating: 3
This was really yummy. However, I don't think that the almond-crust really add anything - all the flavour came from the sauce. Next time, I will likely just make the sauce for plain salmon. Also, I didn't blend or strain the sauce at all and it was still great!

My wife and I enjoyed this dish on our 3rd Anniversary dinner date. The only thing I changed on the recipe was to put 1/8 cup of fresh Italian parsly + 1/8 cup of fresh Cilantro, and I did not strain the sauce. My wife likes the sauce thick, but I will strain it next time.

I had a real problem with the sauce. It curdled, but I managed to rescue it, and then when I pureed it it separated again. So once I strained it I ended up with pure melted butter. Next time I make it, I'm not going to puree it. The salmon was good and I thought the almond crust added an interesting texture, however, it lacked flavour.

This was great! I made it for dinner guests and it was a big hit. I took the left-overs to work the next day for lunch and everybody wanted some. The only thing I did differently was not strain the cream sauce. I really like leeks and felt like leaving them in. It worked out great. The almond is a great crunchy, nutty addition to the salmon. I will definately do this again!!!

it did have mixed reviews at my dinner party. I loved the leek & lemon cream and the salmon. my husband thought it was so-so, and i noticed one guest left the entire leek & lemon cream. I used less cream than suggest and it was a little too thick I will try adding some stock next time.

Although I did not make the sauce to accompny this salmon dish, I have to say that the almond/crust was absolutely delish!! Next time I might try the sauce with it; it looks/sounds good. I just avoided it because of some of the comments I read on it.

I was travelling and was brought salmon and leeks and had to figure out what to do with them, so I made this, with two necessary alterations. I used cashews instead of almonds because the almonds here are quite poor in quality--it worked fantastically, staying on the filets beautifully when I turned them, and they didn't overcook despite having to cook the filets (which were very thick) about 7-8 minutes per side-perhaps the thickness of the nut pieces helped. The sauce was prepared exactly the same except for straining (they had no strainer here, not even anything to create one from!), and maybe because of the leek quality vs the lemons, it was overly lemony for my taste, though others liked it. I had to use it very sparingly. The leek flavor was overridden entirely. I think I'll certainly use the recipe again for the fish part, but I doubt I'll make the sauce--it was a lot of time for something that I think would have been as gratifying with a more quick and simple sauce. Everyone was quite pleased and agreed that it looked utterly gorgeous on the table.

Rating: 4
This is one of our favorite salmon recipes. We have it at least once every 2 months. I found that if you follow the directions, the leeks almost always end up burnt - must check them frequently! Also, if the salmon doesn't cook all the way through before burning the almonds(also frequently the case with the thick filets we get in Calif), throw it in the oven at 350 for 10 mins.

Rating: 2
I was so excited...it smelled so good. I followed the recipe to the letter, but when I added the cream, it instantly curdled and I had to throw it out. Unfortunately, I was out of leeks, so I sauteed onions and garlic in butter, then added lemon juice and white wine and let it reduce. The fish was great. It browned up perfectly, with a crispy almond crust, but was perfectly moist inside. (Don't forget to cook it in a combination of butter and oil!) But how I had hoped for that sauce to work out...

Rating: 4
This was an exquisite salmon recipe. Restaurant style at home! I didn't have any leeks, and couldn't drag myself to the store, so I used shallots instead. I didn't puree or strain the sauce and it was wonderful anyway. Delicate yet very flavorful sauce. Try this sauce with crab cakes - fabulous!! High praise from DH. He says put it on "the list".

Awesome! I did make a couple of revisions though to lower the calories: only used 1/2 the required almonds (it was enough) and used light cream instead of whipping cream. Next time I will reduce the lemon juice and salt, I think with the light cream it was too much. I also roasted it for 20 mins at 450 degrees instead of sauteing and eliminated the olive oil. Easy and definitely impressive enough for company!

This recipe turned out to only be okay. I followed some other suggestions and baked the salmon for 15 minutes at 450 degrees and then broiled it for 3-4 minutes to brown the almonds. I kept the leeks in the sauce and I thought it enhanced the lemon flavor tremendously. It was very easy to make and my guests seemed to enjoy it but I think there are better salmon recipes out there. I served it with sauteed yellow & red peppers and pea pods and the plate was very colorful which is always a plus!

Rating: 3
A perfect dish for a dinner party, especially if you bake instead of saute the salmon. I placed olive oil and butter in a rimmed cookie sheet, preheated it in a 450 oven and baked the fish, turning once. For the sauce, I used a food mill to extract as much of the leek flavor as possible.

Rating: 3
The sauce was great--quick and easy! But, if you make it ahead of time, be prepared to thin it down quite a bit. I just baked plain salmon with some sliced lemons and fresh fennels fronds atop as I was running short of time before the guests arrived (and I didn't want to mess up the kitchen). Everyone loved the sauce (even though mine was a bit thick), and one guest even had seconds just on the sauce to dip his bread in!

Rating: 3
If you feel like salmon, this is a great one! Based on previous reviewer advice, I lightened up the sauce by adding approximately 1/4 cup of white wine and substituted low fat half and half for the cream. To add more flavor to the fish, try substituting cilantro for the parsley. If you're not in love with the idea of dredging in egg and flour like me just brush some olive oil on the fish before applying the crust and bake at 450 for 15 min. It turned out awesome! The blend of flavors with a bottle of pinot grigio made for a really great summertime meal.

I have never cooked salmon before and I found this recipe to be extremely easy and absoultely delicious. I also made a few alterations to the recipe. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream for the sauce just to make it a little bit lighter. I blended the mixture until smooth in the blender and skipped the straining step. Once I had the crust on the salmon, I lightly sprayed each piece with olive oil and placed the four pieces on a cookie sheet and baked at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. I turned the broiler on high for no more than 3 minutes just to brown the crust. It was awesome!

I did make some modifications to the recipe, so my rating might be taken with a grain of salt. :) Extra lemon juice, no bread crumbs. I went for a more textured approach. Did not blend or strain sauce. Also did not crush or chop almonds, but used pre-sliced almonds, which I pressed into the salmon, which had been drizzled with egg and melted butter. Baked in the oven instead of pan frying. Absolutely delicious, although I found it a bit heavy with the cream.

Rating: 3
Delicious! With a few simple alterations, I made this recipe much lower in fat and calories. I substituted canola oil for butter and light cream for whipping cream. I also omitted the flour from the salmon, since I'm trying to be low carb. Finally, instead of sauteeing the salmon in the pan with more oil, I just baked it in a 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes, with the last few minutes under the broiler. Only change I'll make next time would be to toast the almonds before I make the topping.

Rating: 4
We have made this several times and agree that it's exquisite. One time, however, the leeks got a little carmelized. That may be one reason that some other cooks are having with their sauce not being the right color; the leeks are not supposed to brown, just get tender. Our sauce was a drab shade of tan, but actually still tasted pretty good, although almost a bit too rich.

Rating: 3
I'm a big fan of cashews, so I used chopped cashews the first time I made this, but I really think that chopped almonds complement the salmon flavor much better - but terrific nonetheless. Also, make sure to cook the salmon on medium low or medium heat, because the nuts burn easily and leave the middle of the salmon raw. Absolutely a gorgeous dish, sauce is fanastic. I didn't bother pushing it through a strainer, just leave it in the blender a little longer for smooth consistency. It really deserves 3.5 forks.

Rating: 4
Wonderful dish. We loved it. Sauce is particularly nice. I like that a lot can be done ahead of time, which makes it a nice dinner party dish. Followed the advice of a previous reviewer and baked it insteat of frying. Found it easier to make a larger quantity this way and again this is more party-friendly. I did everything ahead and just put it in the oven at the appropriate time.

Made this for Valentine's dinner--outstanding dish. Sauce is amazing!!!! And the salmon was great as well. Served with steamed asparagus and sauteed cremini mushrooms with Creme Brulee for dessert--Sauvignon Blanc to accompany the main course and champagne with the Creme Brulee. Fit right in with our Somersizing way of eating as well. Followed other reviewers thoughts and cooked in the oven for 20 minutes rather than pan frying which gave me time to change ;-) Be careful broiling the topping to finish off--burns easily and I caught it right before it got too crispy.

a great starting point. chop whole, roasted almonds in the food processor for fuller flavor. nut lovers: resist the urge to make a super thick crust, it turns into an iron plate when cooked. beware the crust browns quickly, keep heat moderate! the fish is so good it doesn't need the sauce, but the sauce is lovely!! i also crust swordfish with almonds this way, with mango salsa.

I followed the the advice to bake the salmon & did not fry it at all. I baked it for 20min @ 350. I sprayed some olive oil on the almond mixture so it glistened. At the end I broiled it so the topping became golden. This gave me time to spend with my guests instead of at the stove. The sauce was wonderful. I served the meal with creamy polenta with brie & parmesan; sauted swiss chard, spinach with bacon & garlic & then topped with feta & sunflower seeds. The sauce was delicious on the polenta. This is the first time I've entered a review and was very glad that others had also. Their experience gave me great tips. Keep them coming.

Apparently I'm one of the dissenters, but I didn't care for this dish at all. The cream sauce was mildly interesting at best, and the almond crust burned in the time it took for the fish to finish cooking in the pan. Possibly would have been better had I finished the fish in the oven, as one reviewer suggested. Oh well, next time perhaps...

This is divine! A truly spectacular presentation and flavor. I made the sauce the day before and did not strain it (had to adjust carefully with salt and pepper though). I was worried that the nut topping would fall off in the pan but it was ironclad and didn't budge. I only cooked it on the topping side for 5 minutes then baked at 350 for 10-12 minutes. Served with Asparagus Risotto (on this site) and the two together were out of this world.

All the sauce needed was a tad of seasoning (perhaps I should have seasoned the salmon more instead.) By the way, after putting the leek mixture in the blender, there was nothing left to strain, really.

I haven't had this yet, but being a fan of all the ingredients I would love to try. Can anyone provide me with any suggestions for making it a little lighter?

I substituted halibut for salmon and it turned out great! The sauce was delicious as well, and my guests loved the whole dish. I served with roasted new potatoes w/spring herb pesto and haricot verts sauteed in butter and shallots. This is a great recipe to draw ideas from for other kinds of nut crusts. A keeper!

Made it for a group of ladies at a special event--overall hit!!! Made it for my 14-year-old grandson, and in his words "I feel like a king of somethin'" Made it for my husband--he hid the leftovers---shared it with a coworker, her husband fell in love with her all over again!! It was worth the extra effort to prepare.

I made this dish with both salmon and red snapper and it was equally as good with both fish. The dish looks lovely. I would also substitute the heavy cream for a lighter fare, as it was a little on the thick side. We will definitely make this again. The idea of "painting" the fillet before dipping in the almonds also makes this much easier...good technique.

Did not have leeks so used shallots instead. The sauce was absolutely delicious and have used since with chicken. This recipe is a little more time consuming than others but well worth it! Quite impressive looking.

The salmon crusting was easy and delicious. The sauce was tedious to make and dull flavored. I added more lemon and some white wine and it still was still characterless.

Great Easter dinner. We all love salmon and usually simply grill it with a brushing of lemon juice, oil worchestershire,salt,pepper and a dash of Tobasco - so this was a real treat, especially for the griller in the family! The sauce was a little fussy to strain, but I don't think I would have liked the stringiness of the leeks (but I did consider it at one point during the process. Actually I saved the leek portion an will think of a way to use it (maybe in mashed potatoes where the texture won't be a problem. My salmon was a little thick so after turning and sauteeing for the 5 min I put a lid on the skillet just until I could see that the center was opaque -both sides remained nice and crusty, and didn't burn. No need for skinless as skin on works just fine (also served as an insulator from burning the bottom). Amazed at how well the crust stuck-must be the flour and egg combo (used all white as I had extra from the dessert recipe). Easy to do all of the pre-prep ahead and refrigerate, then heat sauce and cook coated fish just prior to serving. Next time I may add just a touch of dijon to the sauce to boost the color and flavor.

I made this for my fiance's birthday last night. We both enjoyed it and I served it with a spinach and strawberry salad, wild rice almadine and roasted asparagus. All the flavors worked great. I will comment however, on the sauce. I blended it and did not strain it and think that next time I will just serve it up after it is cooked. The browned leeks looked great and I thought the thinner sauce was very tasty. Very rich meal...a special occasion one.

To the lady who's hubby doesn't like salmon....Any firm fleshed fish should work (Shark, Swordfish, etc.). Here in the Northwest we get great hazelnuts. I have substituted them for the almonds in this recipe on occasion and find that they have a better flavor.

My husband can't stand salmon (I know, he's weird!), so can anyone suggest a good substitute? Thanks!

We loved this recipe and consider it a good addition to our list of favorite salmon dishes. I substituted evaporated milk for the cream in the sauce, and the result was, as expected, very good but not great. I would use real cream if I served this to company. My only suggestion would be to be careful not to over-brown the almonds. .. my salmon needed a little more time on that side, and a bit of the crust was too dark. Overall, this was a super dish and I'll make it again.

Rating: 4
This is a very good recipe, I'll definitely make it again. Also, this is a site for reviewing the recipes, not the cooks who make them. I eat out all the time in great places, but, I need some help in cooking on my own. What I've learned has been on my own, and from cookbooks. Also, this site is a tremendous help, with all of the legitimate reviews I read, thank you to all the posts who helped me with this recipe!

Rating: 4
This was really good. I took the suggestion below of frying and then finishing in a 400-degree oven -- if you can saute it at a high temperature, the almonds get crispier. The sauce is a pain, maybe not worth it; if you're in a rush just squeeze a fresh lemon on top and eat

Yum Yum Yum! I have to say this is one of the best dishes from epicurious. The sauce was lovely...did not strain either. The almond crust was wonderful on the salmon. I chopped the nuts , lemon zest and pasely in my mini food processer until fairly fine. Very simple , not to many steps and easy clean up....easy elegant mid week meal.

This is a truly memorable dish. I made it for 15 people, which stretched my time in the kitchen...my husband hates it when I disappear, and since it was the first time I made the dish, I couldn't really talk with guests during the meal preparation as I usually do. This may be best for a dinner of 6, and I would practice it once before hand. Really special recipe.

Rating: 4
The almond coating and the sauce was to die for. I did have to season the sauce with some salt and pepper, but I did not strain it. So delicious. However, the salmon required more cooking time. I feel that it would have been better to partially panfry the salmon and then finish in the oven at 400 degrees as in the Javanese Roasted Salmon recipe.

Rating: 4
If I keep cooking like this, my husband will not take me out to dinner anymore! He loved it and said it was better than any salmon he's had in a fine restaurant. The only changes I made were to use shallots instead of leek (because that's what I had) and I did not puree it. He said it was wonderful!

Rating: 4
I cannot convey how amazing this is. Without exaggerating even slightly, this is possibly the very best entree dish I have ever made. The lemon sauce is beyond words -- it's worth every bit of effort and the complexity and richness of the flavors is surprising. When making this for a dinner party of six, I prepared the sauce a day ahead and reheated. My father, who is not a fan of salmon, told me it was the best he'd ever had in his life - and he is one that does not give compliments lightly. The almond crust is spectacular. I implore you to make this; you won't regret it!

Rating: 4
We really liked the almond crust part of this recipe. I am not a huge fish fan, and I even enjoyed it on salmon. I put a very small layer of dijon mustard on top of the fish and pressed the almond mixutre on to that. I then baked the fish at 375 for +/- 20 minutes because I didn't want the kitchen to smell. Instead of the lemon cream sauce I did a small slice of compound butter (butter mixed w/chopped garlic, lemon rind, lemon juice & parsley) on each piece of fish. Served it w/ asparagus risotto and a nice white wine. Very good and VERY easy!

Rating: 3
We made this instead of the Javanese Roasted Salmon (also on this site & fantastic) for something a little more "light". It's delicious, but I didn't like the potatoes with it -- the flavor competed with the salmon. I'll serve again with rice and asparagus.

This was fabulous- it looks impressive, though not very difficult at all. My boyfriend isn't a huge fan of fish but loved it, said it was the best fish he's ever had. I didn't have to strain the sauce either, it was fine after being in the blender.

Rating: 3
This recipe is easy and very nice. Elegant, I would say. And VERY rich. Salmon alone is rich, but with the crust and cream sauce, it's even more so. Not techically challenging, either. Unfortunately, the dinner guests I was testing this for don't like salmon, so I think I will use the chicken substitute suggestion from another reviewer. This recipe is definitely worth trying, in case you're considering it. I had no trouble straining the sauce through a mesh colander type thing. But after pureeing, it probably doesn't need it.

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic recipe; everyone I made it for has been impressed. And it's easy too, which is a big plus for me since I'm new to cooking. But I do have one suggestion. I made this recipe twice - once with fresh, natural salmon and once with orange roughy. The whitefish was much better with the sauce. That's my 2 cents....

Rating: 4
let me preface this by saying that neither my husband or i really care for fish, but we were given some coho by a relative that went fishing in alaska so....boy was i surprised! this was great! loved the crunchy texture, and could have eaten just a bowl of the sauce. fantastic!

Wow. The almond coating was so fantastic I wished I had coated the fish on all sides! This is a gorgeous, delicious dish. It is, however, quite filling; if you're serving it after appetizers and with side dishes, consider reducing the portion size. Highly recommended.

I LOVE this recipe! I've made it a few times and decided I like to get the flavored almonds from the salad section. The honey roasted, slivered almonds work great! Definatley use the whiter part of the leeks or it will turn out an unpleasant color. Cook up - You'll feel gourmet!

The potential for this recipe is great, only problem...pan frying the salmon. Against my better judgement I figured i should follow the recipe. Huge mistake. Took the elegant taste of salmon and reduced it to some cheap fried catfish flavor. Unless you like that fried fish taste (very greasy and my kitchen still stinks) I would recommend baking it. Sauce was good (added teryaki to it) and definately, grind up the almonds finely.

This recipe works equally well with chicken breasts - just dredge and use same almond crust, same sauce. When I have guests, I make it with salmon for them and with chicken for my husband, and everyone LOVES it. I usually don't repeat the same entrees for guests but this one is different, everyone teases me that they do want it again. Making the sauce ahead of time really saves time when you are pulling off the dinner.

Because of our guest's food preferences, we served a "surf and turf" dinner for eight.Along with roast beef tenderloin,we served the almond-crusted salmon accompanied with roasted new potatoes with spring herb pesto and also, green beans.I must say "even our devoted meat and potatoe guests raved about the salmon". Everyone requested the recipe.(good sign!)

We can't stop raving about this salmon! We accompanied this with a nice bottle of wine and had a wonderful New Year's Eve dinner. Like others, we did not strain the sauce - you don't need to. We seared the fish as instructed but finished cooking it by placing all of the filets in a pan and baking them for 20 min. at 350. Can't wait to try this again!

Rating: 3
Although it ended up tasting good, I had a few problems with the recipe directions. As the other readers found, you cannot strain the sauce because it's too thick, so skip that part. Also, since it says to saute the onions for 20 minutes, they start to carmelize and so the sauce becomes sweet in nature. I found that I would rather have a more savory sauce so I added lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, and salt. Next time I won't saute the onions as long.

Rating: 3
Great, easy recipe. Family really enjoyed it. I think that I over cooked the salmon a bit. The sauce was yummy but when I tried to strain it after blending there was NOTHING coming out of the strainer so I decided to serve the sauce pureed and unstrained. That worked fine. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
This recipe is as delicious as it is beautiful. The fish can be prepared (dusted with flour) in advance and prepared while your guests are finishing their salad or soup. The almond crust turns out exactly perfect if you follow the directions. The lemon leek sauce (can also be prepared in advance) is to die for. My guests were very impressed and said it was better than anything they had in the finest restaurants.

This is a recipe to revisit! I had one of my guests do the honor of straining the sauce (no idle hands in the kitchen). We served the fish with lemon-thyme mashed potatoes and green beans, a perfect fit. Next time I may crush the almonds a bit more.

This dish was absolutely wonderful! The sauce is incredible and it's what makes this dish so tasty. I did not strain the sauce which saves some time.

Thanks for the recipe!

This was a simple recipe, though a little time consuming. All the preparation can be done ahead, and it's a wonderful dish for company. As another cook mentioned, make sure you stick with the pale bits of the leek (not the green part), and your sauce will be the pretty yellow color in the photo. Yum!!!

DO NOT substitute fat-free half and half for the cream. I knew better but I tried it anyway based on the "Cook from Kansas" comments. Fat-free half and half breaks when heated and makes the sauce grainy. Outside of that problem, I was not that impressed with the salmon. There are better ways to make salmon. I agree that the crust would be better with a different type of fish (white/flaky.)

Neither my husband nor I are big salmon fans, but we both actually liked this dish a lot. Both the almond crust and the leek-cream sauce must serve to neutralize the fishy flavor of the salmon. Bought the salmon fillets with skin and had some difficulty getting the skin off without tearing into the flesh--does anyone have any tips on that? (Other than nicely asking the fish guy to remove it!)

This sauce was so delicious. I have to admit, I did alter the recipe slightly. I added 2 cloves of garlic, green peppercorns, and cajun spice while sauteing the leeks.

This is a great recipe for company because so much can be done ahead. The lemon sauce is sooo good! I did add some sea salt & white pepper to the leeks. And I did it ahead & reheated. With twice baked smashed wasabi potatoes, sesame snow peas at room temp, this was a snap for company!

The salmon turned out fabulous! I loved the almond crust, and it wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be, my biggest concern was for the almond mix to fall off during cooking, but it was very good, I wasn't crazy about the sauce, a bit bland and too different of a flavour for the salmon (my opinion). I'd recommend serving it without the sauce.

I thought this recipe was simple and excellent. For those of you who experienced an odd colored sauce, you may have included too much of the green part of the leeks. Next time only use the white and yellow parts. As for a less fat version of the sauce, you may want to use only a tbsp of olive oil instead of the butter and stir a tbsp of flour into the leeks and add skim milk instead of the cream. I'm not one to drown things in sauce, so the recipe as it stands is good for me.

We enjoyed this recipe very much. The sauce is wonderful as is though we have a lot left over. I seasoned the salmon with our favorite creole dry rub and used a cast iron skillet.
