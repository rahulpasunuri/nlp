Made this for Valentine's day this year instead of steak for my meat-loving boyfriend. The chops were delicious and the warm vinaigrette was a nice compliment to the flavor of the veal. I added a little extra grlic b/c I love garlic but this recipe is great as is.

The veal was tasty and the vinaigrette was tasty, but it was not a particulary good pairing. My husband and I both thought the vinaigrette would work better as a bruschetta topping. I will keep looking for a better way to flavor up veal chops.

Made it exactly as directed and it was amazing! The vinagrette was superb (although I would call it a salsa or a relish since it was so chunky). Our 11 month-old baby gobbled it up too.

In spite of the last minute change from grill to broiler (out of gas ) we enjoyed this dish. Cut the oil by a bit, next time will halve the amount. Served with herbed orzo and broccoli florets; thought they were good go-withs.

Unbelievable! Simple & delicious. Served w/ angel hair tossed in a garlic lemon olive oil w/ crimini mushrooms & bread crumbs(from this site), & roasted green beans tossed in balsamic vin.(also from this site). We were all blown away.

Fantastically quick and simple, this is a great dinner for those busy summer evenings when you'd rather be outside sipping wine or playing with the dogs than cooking. Like the below cook, I also found no need for all the oil. This also works well with balsamic vinegar if you manage to drop the red wine vinegar on the floor and it explodes all over everywhere.

Three forks, but, I didn't follow the recipe. I used chicken rather than veal, but prepared and cooked the chicken the same way. I skipped the olives and used fresh chopped tomatoes in their juices. So--I guess that the recipe was altered, but it was good, and healthy!
