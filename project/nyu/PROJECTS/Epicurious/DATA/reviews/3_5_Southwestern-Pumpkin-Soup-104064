I followed sjaneparker's recipe as well. Really a totally different recipe with the added ingredients. It was yummy. It got a little thick and probably should have added more beans and corn as 1 cup each was not quite enough. Will try with lime sour cream pin top as suggested by another reviewer or maybe just a little lime directly in soup at end.

This soup was awesome especially with the corn and beans, very filling.

Yeah, also followed sjaneparker's recipe and it was fantastic. I cut the heat and added avocado as a garnish at the end. But a fantastic winter soup for when you are feeling blue and need some warmth in your belly!

I pretty muc followed sjaneparker's changes, so should really review that recipe instead, but it was great! Made it twice, once as a tester, and again after that success, for a starter for Thanksgiving, with black beans and canned corn. I even forgot the fresh coriander on Thanksgiving and it was still great, although the fresh herb would have been a welcome lightenening of the flavour, colour and texture.

I changed the recipe and it came out AMAZING. I don't know how the original one was, but I had my doubts. Also this version is really enough for 8-6 people. 2 small or 1.5 large white onions diced 3 cloves of garlic minced one cayenne pepper (small) minced (optional can substitute for a few dashes of tabasco or just dried cayenne pepper (2 tsp's) 2-3 tab's of oil 2 tabs of butter 2.5 tabs of brown sugar 2 tsp of cumin 1 tsp chili powder 1/4 tsp nutmeg 6 cups of chicken stock (and or 6 cups of water with the appropriate amt of veg or chicken bouillon cubes) 1 cup of milk or cream (i used skim) about 30 oz (1 large can) of unsweetened pumpkin puree- you can use a can and a half though corn (i used 2 cans) black beans (1 can) about 1 cup to 3/4 of a cup of cilantro chopped roughly throw first paragraph of ingredients in a soup pot at low heat. allow to mingle with minimum stirring for about 1/2 hr so that the onions slightly caramelize. add the spices and incorporate. add the broth and milk. allow to come to a simmer. when hot whisk in the pumpkin. I have a soup blender, so I blended the ingredients at this point. you can use a regular blender and just run it through in batches. i'm not sure but the soup may be fine without this step. once blended you can add whatever southwestern ingredients you like. i listed just corn, black beans, and cilantro but i'm sure there are others i did not think about. and it is ready to serve.

K made this soup exactly as written except I did NOT put in all that sugar. I only used 1/4 cup. I used Seitenbacher's Vegetable Broth so that it would be vegetarian. Also, I used all organic ingredients. The soup does have good flavor BUT I agree with everyone else in that it is way too thin. I like a heartier soup and have made much better pumpkin soup in the past. Yes it's easy but I will NOT make it again unless my customers rave. If you don't mind dish water thin soup then you might like it. Even so you might want to doctor it with a little kick - maybe a sauteed minced jalepeno or some cayenne.

I was looking for a soup to bring to a potluck that didn't involve me slaving over the stove. This was just perfect. So dead simple, yet so flavoursome. I made my own pumpkin puree (bake pumpkin, half and cored, cut side down, for 1 hour at 200C, then scoop out flesh and puree with blender) as I couldn't find canned pumpkin. I increased the amount of pumpkin to almost 2x to thicken the soup (it seemed a thin) and because my pumpkin wasn't very ripe (hence needing more pumpkin flavour). 3.5 stars just taste-wise, but it deserves 4 stars for being so amazingly simple to make!

This was delicious. I added some cayenne pepper to add a kick, then topped with a lime sour cream mixture along with the cheddar cheese, plus some roasted pumpkin seeds. Everyone loved it.

I love, love, love this recipe. Although an acquired taste, I prefer to double the recipe, replace the cream with unsweetened almond milk and replace the brown sugar with 1 packet of Splenda. What a deal! The entire double batch has roughly 400 calories. If you like this sort of soup, I think you will find this incredible.

The first time I made this soup, I thought the cumin was overpowering, so the second time, I used half the cumin called for. It made it much milder, which (to me) made the pumpkin flavor much stronger and better. It's really easy and delicious.

I am looking forward to making this soup again, but I think it needs more body. Next time I am going to saute onion and garlic before adding the broth and cream, and I think I also will broil a poblano chile and blend it up with the pumpkin (I used a fresh one that I baked and blended before adding to the soup).

Yes, this soup is about the easiest thing on the planet. I tried it based on the good reviews and was not disappointed. My modifications: Vegetable broth for the chicken; coconut milk for the whipping cream; 2 cans pumpkin; double the cumin, coriander, and nutmeg. I don't think the soup needs cheese or cilantro garnish. It is sweet on its own. Also, what does anyone think of using half pumpkin and half canned carrots?

Wow!This soup is so good. Even my not hungry husband finished without speaking a word!! I added two cans of pumpkin instead of one and doubled the spices..rest same.

Four forks for ease! I doubled the recipe and only used 2 TB of brown sugar and bumped up the spices adding ground chipotle. I also used half and half which thickend fine after boiling. I used the lime of one lime in the soup which helped balance the sweetness. I put the grated cheese in the bottom of heated bowls, poured the soup into them and added the cilantro. Delicious!! I love the combination of lime and cilantro. A keeper!!

This was good, not terrific. I agree with the other person who felt the soup was too thin. I would add double the pumpkin and probably double the spices. Otherwise it's very broth-like, which wasn't what I was looking for. You can't beat this recipe for quick and easy, though. It tastes better the second day, especially with cornbread.

Phenomenal. Four stars for flavor, texture, and ease of preparation. I used 2 tbsp of brown sugar, and used half and half instead of whipping cream. Next time I'll try using either evaporated milk or equal parts milk & half and half to cut the fat down a little bit.

This recipe was fantastically easy and delicious but I made some instinctive changes: I used only a quarter cup of heavy cream and 3/4 cup of milk -- for health reasons. I used TWO 15 oz. cans of pumpkin -- without the second can, the soup looked pallid and thin. And I added a little more of each spice (for the additional can of pumpkin) and cooked the whole thing down a little more than the recipe called for. Texture and taste was beautiful. I served it with cornbread and my vegetarian man swooned.

This tastes much better than you would expect given how easy it is. It's so nice not having to blend it at the end, since there are no chunks of vegetables or anything.

I just made this recipe tonight and after tweaking with it a little, it is delicious! I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream, and added salt and white pepper, extra chili powder, and two tablespoons of butter to thicken it a bit more and add richness.

What a great recipe! I would never have thought of adding these particular spices myself, but it turns out wonderful. It's a it like a Pumpkin Curry, but then in the form of a soup.

I love this recipe- it is so easy. And it's a very different taste from what we normally make. We go a little heavy-handed on the spices when we make it, and use less cream. Also, the cilantro and fresh grated sharp cheddar really are essential to this dish, so don't skip them.

Like others, I tweaked this a bit. I didn't have any ground coriander, but I added 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes and used chipotle chili powder instead of regular chili powder because I like the smokier flavor. I used half & half instead of whipping cream and eliminated the cheese to cut the fat. I also used organic free-range chicken broth, which has less sodium tastes a LOT better than regular chicken broth. The result was delicious and I will make this many times over - so easy on a cold fall night.

I hate to be the dissenting vote on this recipe, but I just can't give it a thumbs up. I really wanted to like this soup as I love pumpkin soups (& butternut squash). I've made this recipe twice (followed the recipe to the letter on the first try & tried to adjust the seasonings on my second attempt following suggestions from other reviewers). I'm generally good at tasting & seasoning various recipes that need tweaking. I even allowed the soup to "rest" overnight to see if the flavors would marry better. No such luck. In particular, the cumin overwhelmed the flavor of the soup. Sorry, but this soup was a disaster for me.

I made this to bring into work, and after tasting it immediately after it was done cooking my first reaction was to prepare something else. But my husband tried and loved it, so I brought it in. MUCH better the next day, after the flavors blended, and my coworkers loved it -- people would walk into the office and comment on how good it smelled. I quadrupled the recipe, used half and half and skim milk, bumped up all of the spices and added green chiles. I should have added more heat to it. It definitely needs the cheese, cilantro and sour cream. If you're going to make this, test it out to make sure you like it, and prepare it a day in advance to allow the flavors to come through.

We don't have tinned pumpkin so I used fresh ... so adding sugar would have been too sweet.

J.J. from FL This soup was outstanding. I needed something that looked difficult but was really quick for a 12 person dinner party on Thanksgiving weekend. What a hit. The flavors blended wonderfully. I also used 2 cups chicken stock instead of 3 and 1 TBS of brown sugar. I am making it for a friend of mine today who is a non-fat freak so I'm going to try 1/2 and 1/2 or evaporated milk. My favorite twist to the recipe (belive it or not) was the cilantro. This time I am going to add more into the actual soup. My guests chewed on it and loved the explosion of flavors.

I was so excited to make this soup due to the overwhelming number of good reviews. I was not so excited with the results. I agree that this soup was easy to prepare. The problem was that it was not easy to eat. My husband & I simply did not like the flavors at all (& we both LOVE pumpkin soup!) I have made this soup three times now just to see if I was missing something. I disagree with reviewers who suggest using less sugar--I used canned pumpkin & it needed the added sweetness. The second time around, I tried to put more spices in as several reviewers suggested. Still no good. Then I tried to cut down on the cumin as I felt it was the overwhelming flavor. Nothing made this soup something I would bother to prepare. I am so glad I made trial batches before serving this soup as the first course to an elaborate holiday meal. Alas, I am still in search of the perfect creamy pumpkin or butternut squash soup recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2000 and it received rave reviews. Two of my teenagers (12 and 13) and several adults requested it again this year as well. It is simple to make.

Made this for a holiday luncheon and it was an absolute hit with all the guests, including a gourmet cook whose presence was rather daunting to me. She now has the recipe as well. As suggested by other reviewers, I reduced the brown sugar to 1 T. I also left out the coriander (which I didn't have on hand). I had grated the cheese but forgot to present it and the soup was fine without it. I added the cheese with the leftover soup the next day, and it was fine that way as well, so I would say the cheese is optional. Great recipe, one for the file!

THIS SOUP IS GREAT!!! It looked like an awful combination of things but I wanted the color to show off my new bowls. I made a trial batch and finished it all myself.

It's quick, it's easy, it's delicious, and all the ingredients are readily available.

This is a rich, tasty soup, but I don't think I would make it again simply because it isn't to die for. I followed the recipe very closely except I ground my own coriander seed and doubled it, and I more than doubled the cumin. I omitted the sugar altogether (yuck!), and added a little cayenne pepper. I used fresh pumpkin which I roasted, pureed and strained beforehand. The pumpkin was very mild tasting, almost like a butternut squash so maybe that was the problem. I can't wait to try it tomorrow after the flavors have had a chance to meld.

This was a delicious and easy soup to make. I took other reviewers advice and added some heat (a small amount of chipotle) to the soup. It did need it; without it was a little to bland for my taste. I also found I liked it with the full 3 cups of chicken broth; others had advised only using two. I'd like to try making it again with something other than whipping cream (too fattening) -- evaporated (possibly skim) milk or half-n-half?

This recipe is so easy and tastes really good. I tried using no-fat half and half. I wouldn't do that again, as I wonder about the ingredients in such foods, but I'd probably use "normal" half and half or light cream to cut the fat a bit. Otherwise, it was a keeper.

An ideal dish- tasty & impressive, yet quick & easy. I've made this several times now and it has always been a hit. I've used sweet potatoes when I didn't have pumpkin and it was excellent. I never bother with the sugar and always use lower fat milk- even skim works. For a friend with milk allergies I used coconut milk which added a nice twist(with a few calories of course!)

Because I HATE pumpkin I used sweet potatoes for this dish. And what a dish it was! Flavor beyond compare, hearty, creamy... what more could a dish ask for? I did make a few changes other than the sweet potatoes. I did not have any whipping cream, but I did have a small can of evaporated milk. Also, I peeled and sliced my potatoes and brought them to a vigorous boil in the chicken broth, mashing them frequently. I then threw in my spices (used cayenne instead of chili powder - I was out), excluding coriandor and nutmeg, though we added two cloves of garlic, and continued to let it boil like crazy. The more it boiled, the thicker it got. We served it with the cheese and cilantro. The cheese as a great mellow flavor in contrast with the spice of the soup. My husband couldn't stop sampling it while it was cooking. He raved about the soup all night! I was very impressed with this simple, yet truly delicious, dish.

DELICIOUS - QUICK - EASY What more can you ask for in a recipe. I made this for lunch with a friend. It was like something from a fancy restaraunt. To make it thicker and creamier, I only used 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth. I also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the whip cream. I wish I could give this more then 4 forks. The flavors blended so nicely. I can't wait to make it again.

Very yummy. Creamy with a combination of different flavors that work well with one another. Great presentation with cheddar and cilantro garnish. My husband commented that it looked like a pro chef had cooked it. I'll definitely make this one again.

Unusual flavors, but they definitely work. I like my cream soups to be very thick (like bisque), so I reduced the whole volume by about 1/3. Also, used vegetable broth instead of chicken, for my vegetarian friends. Delicious!

This soup is astoundingly easy to make, and very elegant for a dinner party. I couldn't believe how SIMPLE it was, and yet how really good it tastes. I've had at least six people from work as me for the recipe. Thanks, Bon Appetite!

I made this awhile back, and thought it was quite good and different. I used only 1 Tbsp. of sugar, but may cut even THAT in half next time. Also, I'm thinking of swirling it with a chipotle cream next time, instead of adding the cheese (or less cheese.) Use whole milk to cut fat even more than 1/2 & 1/2. Served this with smoked turkey quesadillas...great combo!

I prepared this soup for my family's Thanksgiving visit. I eat low carb and this fit in perfectly for me. I did add shredded cooked chicken breast to the soup per my husband's request the second time and it was quite good. I garnished with asiago cheese, sour cream and cilantro. Everyone was quite pleased with the results, including a picky brother in law.

This soup is very good. I used no-fat half & half. I would use it again. Yummy!!!

This is a delicious soup and tastes like it took an enourmous amount of time and energy though it is very simple to make! I accidentally left off part of the recipe so I had to "wing it" at the end. I always melt the cheese into the soup at the end and just discovered the recipe calls for using the cheese as a garnish!!! Well, I think I'll stick with my "mistake" as it tastes wonderful!

I should have paid more attention to the suggestion that I decrease the sugar - 1 tablespoon would have been fine - the full amount renders the soup a bit too sweet. Otherwise, an easy an interesting soup.

I served this at Thanksgiving - it was a huge hit. Very different and very tasty. It was much better the next day. Next time I will make it one day in advance.

This recipe gets three forks based on ease of preparation alone! Four fork recipe: -omit brown sugar or decrease to one tablespoon -decrease cream to 1/2 cup -add one clove garlic -pureed chipolte in adobo adds welcome smoky heat. Toasted pumkins seeds were a colorful and crunchy garnish. I think I'll try Fritos next time, as suggested! Leftovers were even better the next day.

Since pumpkin is rather sweet, I use 1T loosely packed sugar or omit it entirely. I also like to add a small can of Ortega mild green chilis, drained and finely chopped as pumpkin simmers. Green Tobasco is a wonderful condiment for this soup...perks it up without overpowering it. This one definately goes in my favorites file.

I loved this soup. Just a pinch of sugar was fine and I replaced the cream with more broth. It's nice with a swirl of cream on top before serving. My boys liked it with a few beans thrown in with fritos on top along with the cheese and cilantro (basically a twist on the ole Frito Chili Pie)

Finally...a way to use up the leftover pumpkin I always end up throwing out after making my pumpkin roll. This was very easy and very good. I think it would make a great first course for holiday dinners.

Excellent! I made it twice already. Nice and smooth and warming, especially in the cold weather.

I loved it! Trying to watch the waistline so I upped the chicken broth to 4 c. and used 1/2 c. half and half and 1/2 c. evaporated milk. Also upped spices alittle and added a pinch of cayenne. Love it with the cilantro and sharp cheddar (otherwise a little bland). Also good with a few croutons thrown in for crunch!

We enjoyed the soup, but when I prepare it again I won't use whipping cream...way too rich! I'll add cayenne pepper for a kick, and only add a pinch of brown sugar. I used 1 tablespoon of sugar and found it a little too sweet. I thought it was a nice way to start the holiday meal.

Lovely soup. It tastes wonderful with cheese as well as without.

I used half-and-half instead of cream, and it was still good. I also used only half the cumin the recipe called for because I'm not a big cumin fan. I added about 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper which spiced it up. Next time I make it, though, I'll definitely take everyone's advice and use less brown sugar - it was a bit sweet. Very interesting soup.

Rating: 3
This was interesting, and it took me awhile to decide if I liked it. I do, but definitely am glad I kept the brown sugar at 2 tbs, and added a dash of sherry (the sherry definitely made it, in my opinion). Next time, I think I'd add a little more sherry and some caramelized onions and garlic.

I made this soup for some friends under the weather. One of my friends said it was the best soup she ever had. I thought it needed something but I'm not sure what. It was somewhat over come with the cumin. If I make it again I will probably cut back on it.

After all the great reviews, I was excited about trying this. I'll give it that its certainly about the easiest soup I've ever made, but it isn't very exciting. I put in less brown sugar, and upped the spices, and still felt that it needed tons of tabasco to give it any real character. The cheese and hot sauce made it good, but I can't say I think I'll be making it again. My boyfriend thought it was very good though.

I have made pumpkin soup several different ways, usually involving onions and potatoes and lots of time and work. This soup was BETTER and took far less time. I left out the sharp cheddar cheese COMPLETELY since I was having grilled cheese sandwiches with the soup, and added another cup of broth, used 1.5 cups of evaporated milk instead of whipping cream, and about 18 ounces of roasted and pureed pumpkin with very little moisture. I also used a little more spice and cut the brown sugar by more than half. This soup was excellent, and I will definitely make it again. As a fan of the bland potato-pumpkin variety, where you add tons of nutmeg to give it any flavor, I was surprised that I liked this as much as I did. (I shouldn't tell you this, but the pumpkin had been in the freezer for about 14 months, and the spices completely covered any freezer-taste that might have otherwise spoiled a dish.)

I was really excited to make this soup after reading the reviews. It was very quick and easy. I made it with the whipping cream and went a little heavy on the spices. I was expecting a hearty pumpkin soup but this is a creamy french style soup. Very rich and not a lot of flavor. Our family of eight voted it down, 8/0!

This is a wonderful soup, simple to make, incredible flavor. Every time I serve it I get rave reviews -- even from from my most finicky guests. I altered the basic recipe slightly and reduced the amount of brown sugar by half when some of my first "guinea pigs" found it interesting, but too sweet.

Very tasty. I used an ancho chilli powder and a bit more cumin than called for. The flavors were quite nice, if not real hot. I gave it four forks, and my wife, who is not as wild about pumpkin as I am, gave it three. VERY EASY.

I made this soup for an annual Halloween potluck in our neighborhood. I am known for not being a very good cook and this turned out great! It was so easy, just add ingredients and stir. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream and as a big dairy lover, this was still good. I did not have the ground coriander and that did not seem to matter either. I used a very spicy chili powder so the soup was quite hot but we loved it.

Wow! This soup exceeded my expectations. It is quick, easy, and delicious. I had all the ingredients on hand except for whipping cream, so I used half and half instead. It was delicious and will be added to my list of incredible edibles.

I was so intrigued by this recipe that instead of saying "I should make this sometime," I said "I'm making this tomorrow!" I didn't want to use whipping cream, so I substituted a creamy soy milk, which I had on hand. It was delicious. Next time, I will try using evaporated skim milk, for a creamier texture without all the fat. The sweetness of the pumpkin combined with the cilantro and sharp cheddar made for a very pleasing flavor palatte.
