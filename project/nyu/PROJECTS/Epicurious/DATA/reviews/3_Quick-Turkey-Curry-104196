Second time making this recipe. Again, found it easy and delicious. Used less cumin than specified and double the garlic. We added salt to the finished curry (it seemed a bit bland) and it perked up nicely. The condiments (currants, coconut, and almonds toasted in butter) are critical.

Instead of using apples, I added red potatoes as well as mushrooms, carrots, and sliced jalepenos (things that I needed to get rid of before they went bad). I also didn't use apple cider or mango chutney (these aren't ingredients that I have around my house). Despite all of this, it tasted pretty good! Next time, I would add some fish sauce and play around with the spices some more. I would suggest this for a quick dish, even for beginners!

So my review is to be taken with a grain of salt. I was working with what I had in my kitchen. I made the curry sauce mostly according to the directions. I didn't have mango chutney so I used dried apricots and a few tablespoons of apricot jam. The curry sauce was good, but next time I would not put as much cumin in it. I felt it overpowered the curry. I ended up adding a can of pineapple chunks, a red bell pepper, an orange bell pepper, and I added the currents directly to the sauce. I used ground turkey and it tasted great - perhaps not the visual feast I like, but I had it in my freezer. I mixed the sauce and turkey together with the rice and garnished it it with sliced scallions and fresh cilantro.

I love Indian food and this recipe was so far from what I wanted! If you have a craving for curry, get take-out from your favorite Indian restaurant rather than make this dish. If you are an experienced Indian food cook, you might be able to doll up this recipe with top ingedients and technique. Otherwise, skip this one.

I like curry and thought that this is a good good 'starter' recipe for new curry cooks. I am not sure if folks from India would use cow's milk in the recipe. It does need to be jazzed up with more curry. When I make it again I will add some lemon zest, raisins, coarsely chopped ginger, and more apples.

After two nights of traditional turkey dinner leftovers, this was a welcome change. The recipe was truly quick and easy. I wanted the sauce a bit thicker and added another Tbsp. of flour blended in later. I am sure it would have been even better if I had a tart apple instead of a Fuji and the cilantro which I was missing. Makes a generous amount and used up all the leftover turkey. Yay! I will make this again for sure.

Hi! Everyone in my house thought that the recipe was just delicious. Even my 2 year old son thought it was good. It was quick and easy, and much better with leeks, instead of onions. Anyways, thanks for a great dinner! I'll definitely be making this delicious delicacy again.

Mediocre only. My husband actually really disliked it! Maybe if I'd used a hot curry it would be more flavorful. Also, didn't have mango chutney, but i don't think even these two ingredients could dramatically improve.

Not so great, although not bad either. I made it "almost" as described: all out of cilantro and used spiced cider instead of plain, but otherwise as written. Used the full amount of cream in spite of my post-Thanksgiving resolve to feed my family healthier food. People took seconds but without gusto. Next year I'll look for other ways to use turkey leftovers.

Really good and super easy.

Yummy and lends itself well to various substitutions (yogurt for cream, fresh tomatoes for paste, etc.) Great way to use up leftover turkey.

EXCELLENT!! I had never made any kind of curry dishes before but love eating it, so gave this a try. Easy, and a great change from the usual post-Christmas turkey leftover recipes. A definite "do-again" at our house. With no stores open I did have to substitute for the mango chutney and used some orange marmalade instead. YUMMY!!!

Made this for my family from leftover turkey as a nice change. Didn't have the mango chutney and substituted half and half for the cream. It didn't suffer from the lack of cream, but my 8 year old son said that if it had the chutney he wouldv'e given it 3 1/2 stars instead of 2 1/2. Would be lovely for a post-holiday get-together with friends. Great for a crowd.

Definately a keeper for leftover turkey. I recently roasted a turkey breast specifically to make this dish. Good hot curry powder is the key.

Lots of flavour here. I made a few substitutions, partially out a necessity and thought I'd mention them: I used diced fresh mango instead of chutney and found that with the additional juice from this, it made sense to cut back on the broth (2+ cups instead of three). I also used orange-mango yogurt instead of cream and found that worked nicely, particularly since I used hot curry powder. I agree with the comment that it's almost better the next day. I'd also recommend letting it simmer a bit longer.

This was delicious and even better the next day. I used low-fat coconut milk in place of the cream and apple juice, instead of cider. It was enjoyed by all, including my 7 year old.

This is a great recipe for leftovers. I used left over home made cranberry sauce instead of the mango chutney and it was excellent!Would definitely do it again.

OK...this is a fantastic recipe! What is so terrific about it is the ability to really improvise. I used yogurt instead of cream, apple juice instead of cider and beef broth with the rest of the listed ingredients. I then used my blender to blend some of the apple to thicken it even more. A little coconut jasmine rice and roasted broccoli really added the final touches. You must try this!

My Mom use to make Curry turkey with Thanksgiving leftovers..This is just as good! I added raisins. I did not have apple cider, so I used apple juice. Fantastic recipe!

I made this twice, loved it both times. The second time I used coconut milk to replace the whipping cream, and apricots instead of mango chutney. It is a great recipe, seemingly foolproof. I think the secret is getting good curry -- hot madras, for example. It is definitely not bland. I used cilantro and chopped dates for a garnish. A great, fiery meal on a gloomy winter night.

We love this recipe. My children (even my 6 year old) ask for it often. For those who feel it was blah....try buying a quality curry (say from an Indian market) since their curries are more potent and flavorful. Serve with Saffron Basmati rice!!! Yum!!!!!

We loved this recipe. Both of my kids ate it! I have made it with lamb and pork left overs. i serve it with yoghurt and a lot of fruit -- bananas, pineapple, mandarin orange slices, etc. in addition to suggested condiments. I have made it with milk with a little arrowroot flour to thicken instead of the cream. I too will try yoghurt next time.

Made this last year, great taste and easy to make, what else do you what after a busy holiday! Look forward to making it again this year with a little more heat and some brown rice.

I used Hot Indian curry powder and loved this recipe. I probably would not recommend regular yellow curry to give as good a result. Other than the hot curry powder, I followed the recipe exactly. Served it with a little saffron basmati rice and received ovations. Super quick too!

I'm sorry to disagree, but we did not love this recipe. It was just not flavorful enough for our taste.

Fab! The perfect antidote to Thanksgiving gorging. This was a spectacular success with many guests who were new to curry.

I must say, I was feeling very Gourmet--because I actually had all the necessary ingredients for this dish in my pantry. This is a great way to use up Thanksgiving turkey disguised as something wonderfully different and that doesn't remotely smell of gravy or cranberry. We served this with bowls of green onions, chopped fresh cilantro, and lime wedges. I also had some hot lime chutney that was a great addition for we who enjoy a little more spice. Yum!

This was absolutely delicious, but I would hardly call it quick. It took me at least an hour, but was well worth it. Next time I will try substituting yogurt for the whipping cream to make it a little more healthy.

Delicious! I used chicken rather than turkey, since I needed to use up some leftovers. I would definitely make it again, using either chicken or turkey.

What a great curry recipe. High flavor without being too hot, very creamy.
