I used Mission Figs, Gorganzola, and proccutto. I squished the cheese in the seedy center and then wrapped with the meat. Baked it in the oven without plank in glass dish. My guests couldn't get enough of them. So easy, so delicious. I just wish our tree produced as many figs as we can eat!

I was at a cabin for the summer and didn't have access to my full kitchen, so I made these without following the recipe perfectly; will rate this as a 3, but even my version was 4-forks-worthy. Made them with black figs; used Chambord instead and didn't have the planks. Even with these changes, they were the BEST appetizers I've had in a very long time, easy to make and had them ready to go about 3 hours before everyone showed up. After baking them, they were GONE in just a few minutes!

I gave this recipe to members of our dinner group. Four forks for flavor, two for ease of eating. They used calimyrna (green) figs, which were too large for an hors d'oeuvre serving. I'd recommend cutting larger figs in quarters or using black mission figs, which run smaller. Also, tucking the cheese under the pancetta would make for better finger food. These would also be great as part of a cheese course, and definitely easier to eat with a knife and fork as the recipe is written. You could certainly do these without the planks, but planking adds a very welcome smokiness that I wouldn't want to pass on.

Made during late summer and our guests adored them! Dipped ours in Balsamic Glaze, wrapped in proscuitto, topped as suggested, plank roasted & drizzled w/honey. Outstanding! This appetizer also traveled well to a rooftop BBQ in Avila Beach, CA. Prepped them completely, then planked on-site. Very unique, luscious & guests were impressed. Recently made a date appetizer using similar ingred which made me look-up this dish. For dates, I stuffed w/herbed goat cheese, wrapped in proscuitto, baked in oven & drizzled w/Balsamic Glaze. Think I'll try planking the dates too!

"I would like more than anything to see Paris again," she said, gazing out my apartment window. The fog had rolled into the bay, as it did almost every night, and an unearthly glow blanketed the city. "That would be nice," I admitted, slicing a small basket of figs in half one at a time. They were ripe, and the sweet smell of the fruit wafted gently throughout the room. "Yes, it would. Are those figs?" "They are," I reply, wrapping each of the halves in pancetta after topping them with goat cheese. "Do you like figs?" I ask. She doesn't answer, but crosses the room in her sad, waltzing manner to look out the window again. In the distance a foghorn sounds, a lullaby of San Francisco if ever there was one. "I think I should like to see Paris again," she says sadly. " I would too." We both know that if we do it won't be together, and we're both sad about that. I bake my figs, the rich, pungent smell of the cedar filling the apartment. It make me think about camping as a child. Later we drink wine and eat the delicious fruit. and then we kiss; her lips taste of honey. The fog grows thicker, and we talk about the deliciousness of planked figs.

Good recipe. But goat cheese doesn't crumble; it's too creamy. A Greek feta made from sheep & goat's milk works fine and it crumbles! These can be a little messy to serve and hold. Consider putting them on rounds or triables of thin white toast with a little goat cheese spread beneath them. And planks really aren't essential. A lightly oiled baking sheet works fine with a little lower oven temperature (400-ish).

Superb. Sublime. Superfralacajalisticexpealidocious. My husband and I adored this. I've made it several times this Fall as the fresh figs won't be available much longer and a bit of overindulgence in that regard shouldn't be faulted. I made this strictly according to the recipe twice as well as once with prosciutto which had a nicer, crispier result than did the pancetta. It was also a bit more delicate, though that was because I used prosciutto di Parma that was very thinly sliced. Could be that I should request that the butcher slice the pancetta very thinly next time.

I did not have a plank, so instead used a Le Creuset baking dish, and it was still delicious. I would like to try the plank, though!

This is one of the best appetizers we've ever had and our dinner guests agreed. I don't think that the plank is mandatory - a baking sheet would work just fine. So easy and delish!!!

This is a keeper. I made it for Independence Day and everyone loved it. Had to soak the figs in Port, that's all I had, and used a cedar plank. All of the flavors work so well together it is a classic!

We had this with greens for a lunch salad. The pancetta was a bit hard to work with and I might try prosciutto next time. I used a cedar plank (all I had). The result was delicious with many layers of flavor from the sweet fig, the touch of Calvados, some "hot" from course pepper, smoke from the plank, nice texture and mild flavor from the cheese and who can resist "bacon"!
