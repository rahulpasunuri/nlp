OK, so its too soon to tell if my guests will rave over this soup, I've just finished making it for tomorrow. I've learned one incredibly valuable lesson and that is I may never again take to heart the reviews of well...less experienced cooks. To begin, it was painful for me to add anything that might overpower the delicate leeks, and watercress surely does, on that front 3 cups of watercress is sufficient, less would be fine, even 2 cups would suffice. For the person who said they needed to add more just to give it some flavor...I dont know what to say. The beauty of my gorgeous leeks is lost. Absolutely. It tastes very much like watercress, which luckily I like...I'm not sure my guests will agree. It is a beautiful soup and I believe will be a lovely summer soup as it is not meant to be served piping hot. I will be serving it with scallops though if the soup does not mellow overnight I might consider a garnish of sour cream instead. I did thin it with milk as the recipe suggests though additional chicken soup would work just as well. As watercress is already peppery (and hydroponic watercress even more sharp) I would warn against adding too much pepper to taste. Altogether a beautiful soup though, I will update after I've served it though I've only invited devotees of my cooking so I'm not sure I'll get an honest sampling.

I love this soup. I get fresh watercress from a friend every spring and it's the first fresh local veggie. This year I got it late, so it was very flavorful and strong. I used vegetable broth and less sour cream and it was plenty rich enough. Topped with the first chives from the garden.

Just wanted to add a PS to my previous review--I used 4 cups of watercress for a very rich soup, plus extra for garnish.

This was a very good soup and I've made it before, but this time I decided to serve it cold (good call!) with room-termperature butter-sauteed scallops as a garnish. I split the scallops in half so they were more bite-sized. Chopped chives on top. The sour cream was very rich; next time I might try light cream. I might cut back the leeks a bit next time. This is really a classic watercress vichyssoise.

Classic French soup. I like to serve soups as appetizers in demitasse cups- this one works well for that.Instead of scallops used small dollop of creme fraiche and teensy scoop of caviar.

I have made this recipe for four Christmas dinners. It is requested by my family. Note: Leeks were very dear this year. One package of watercress makes 3 cups.

Super yummi! Made it with veggie broth instead of chicken so it would be vegetarian. Plus, I added an extra bunch of watercress for flavor.

This is a wonderful addition to any meal or just a fabulous lunch. Susan I hope you like this, you can add any shell fish to this dish as well. Or just omit it

Everyone loved this soup. It was pretty easy to make and looked great. Served it for Easter. The chicken broth, milk and sour cream keep it light.

Easy, easy, easy and fabulous. Served at Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. I used 3 bunches of watercress to enhance the flavor.

I'm glad another cook suggested adding mustard to this soup. I found it a bit bland until I added some bold n' spicy mustard. It was then wonderful!

This recipe was quite good. I ended up being unable to find watercress (grr), so had to substitute a milder leaf. I added a couple of T of dijon to up the peppery punch. It's a very nice soup - nothing really extraordinary, but good and a nice choice when you want to serve something mild.

Love it. I made this for the first time nearly seven years ago for a dinner party. Guests raved about it, hopefully not just being polite. It's flavorful, not over powering, makes a nice transition from one course to the next, and the presentation is lovely. I appreciate reviewers suggestions of adding more watercress for added flavor, and a pinch mustard for a slight touch of punch. The scallops add to the flavor and presentation. This recipe remains at the top of my dinner party soup list. I serve it in clear glass short stemmed dishes. I usually serve a recipe once per person. I've made this so many times, I now need some more friends.

You can easily please your vegetarians by using good veggie stock instead of chicken and offering the scallops only to those who want them. This soup is really nice chilled. I would also add a little chopped fresh herbs (thyme or tarragon?) to bump up the flavour.

This soup is fabulous! Iv'e made it many times and it always gets rave reviews from very young and old. I'ts a great make ahead course..

For a weeknight supper, I lightened this (1T butter for leeks, 1 lg potato, no milk), kept it rustic (skin on, immersion blender for rougher texture) and topped w a poached egg vs scallops -- very satisfying fare, indeed. FWIW, this recipe may make a great spinach soup but spinach is no substitute if you seek watercress' bright pepper bite. Made as described, 1c=WW3 pts

GREAT DISH! I make this every year for Christmas Eve - it's wonderfuk hot or cold and fabulous left over - I have made it with shrimp rather than scallops as well and w/o the seafood altogether and it stands alone well.

Made this as the opening course for my dinner party last night. Fantastic! Every guest said it was the favorite dish of the night. Beautiful presentation served in shallow, cherry-red soup bowls. Followed the recipe exactly (even the garnish). Love scallops, but they didn't really add anything. The soup by itself is delicious, and smells so wonderful cooking, too! Definitely will be making this again and again and again!

I am posting this way after I made it b/c I didnt have a chance to earlier. Made for XMas last year (that's right, last year, I've been really busy). This was a showstopper -the scallops, watercress, soup base, the whole thing was perfect. I served it in small shallow bowls so the scallops would float and everyone wanted another serving. Added extra white pepper but other than that followed recipe as written. Delicious, elegant and easy.

I've made this soup 3 or 4 times now and though my fiance raves over it, I still consider it just good. I find I have to add a bunch of extras, like dry mustard and cayenne, to punch up the flavor a bit. Adding more watercress than called for helps. I can't complain a bit about the texture, though...velvety and smooth. Have substituted spinach when watercress is hard to find with good results.

This was a nice & easy soup. My family thought it was o.k. nothing special. I personally thought it was good but nothing special. I did not make the scallops.

Twice I have served this to guests as an appetizer, and I will definitely make it again. I have never bothered with the scallops, and have always prepared it a day in advance. Actually, it was pretty good reheated in the microwave for lunch today - three days after I originally prepared it.

Good and easy recipe. I used AT LEAST 3 cups of watercress, rinsed well and removed ALL the thick stems. Soup needed every bit of it. Didn't need any milk to thin, but maybe my potatos were a little small. Added a little nutmeg and a touch of tarragon. Served in small glass bowls with herb marinated shrimp, that I had grilled earlier, hooked on the side. That way it could all be done in advance.

Made this as part of the Christmas dinner also, just fix the scallops last minute and you're good to go. Added just a touch of sherry to the recipe to make it a bit more interesting. Everyone was happy!

I also made this for Christmas dinner, and everyone really enjoyed it. I was able to get very nice sea scallops and seasoned them a bit more than the recipe called for. I made it the night before and reheated it, so all I had to do was sear the scallops and serve.

I made this as a part of our Christmas dinner and wished I hadn't. It's very easy to make, but I don't think the watercress or the scallops added much to the taste or presentation.

I would consider this excellent soup. The key is having fresh ingredients, especially for the scallops. This dish was served as an appetizer for several people, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.

I made this soup for a multiple course new years party meal. Everyone absolutely loved it and it was great to prepare a couple of days ahead of time. Great flavorful winter or anytime soup.

I decided to only make the soup. I thought that the watercress added little to the flavor of what turned out to be a decent potato-leek soup recipe, though it did add color.

I made this soup the evening of the Superbowl for a group of guys, and they absolutely loved it. I omitted the watercress but added extra scallops and more potatoes. It was delicious. It was very tasty and I look forward to making it again very soon.

Absolutely delicious! Beautiful soup. Only problem is my husband hates the smell of fish, and I hated to stink up the house right before I served this. Would not miss the scallop.

I made this soup on Christmas day and thought it turned out quite well. I followed others advice and skipped the scallops. I thought it was a good basic cream soup, but would probably do it the day before next time.

Rating: 4
I made this soup without the cream because I had a lactose-intolerant guest. It came out wonderful nonetheless, since the blended potatoes gave it body. The fact that it was lighter without the cream also helped us not to feel overwhelmed by the 5-course dinner (w/beef and rich dessert).

By the time we all sat down to dinner (15 of us) the soup had turned luke warm. Aside from that, I was very pleased with the results and everyone seemed to like it. I also skipped the scallops due to time. I did make this 1 day ahead and believe that helped with overall flavor. I'll make this one again!

My husband and I served this (along with the rest of the dinner party menu) on Christmas. We also did not use the scallops. I thought it was tasty but I don't think I'll be making it again. I made the soup the same day that we served it although I did find that the flavor improved somewhat after a day.

Made this as part of the epicurious "make ahead" holiday dinner. I was quite generous seasoning with fresh ground pepper, and it really worked well. One of the best soups I've ever had.

I made this soup for the family Thanksgiving dinner. It was the big hit of the dinner, not the turkey! I made it without the scallops also, because I ran out of time. It was requested for the Christmas dinner where new people tasted it and loved it! I'm making it again for a dinner party with friends and expect the same results!

Made this for Christmas Eve and it was a hit with my family. I couldn't get large sea scallops so I got smaller ones and put 2 in each bowl. My nephew liked it without the scallops, though. I used plain russet potatoes, and don't think I would spend the extra money on Yukon Golds.

I made this recipe with small white potatoes, because that's what I had on hand. This is a pretty, delicious and elegant soup...perfect for a first course New Year's Eve. I used very large sea scallops and thought they added a unique and rich texture and flavor. One note...this soup can be made ahead and frozen..so all you have to do is thaw, reheat, and saute the scallops.

I made this soup for a dinner party last night. It was delicious! Next time I'd skip the scallops--they didn't add that much--the soup is quite elegant on its own. That way you can skip the stress of having to saute scallops at the very last minute.
