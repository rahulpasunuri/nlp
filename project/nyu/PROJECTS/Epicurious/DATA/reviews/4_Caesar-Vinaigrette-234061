Four forks for the adapted version recommended by others here. i reduced the cheese, used EVOO, coddled the egg and added a dab of mayo. Outstanding!! Served it new years eve and got raves. Best ever.

Delicious dressing, but I make it in the blender. All the ingredients but the oil and Parmesan cheese go in first. When they are combined, I add the oil - drizzling in with the blender on low speed. I increase the speed after the oil has been added. Finally, I add the Parmesan, salt and pepper to taste. Making this in the blender alleviates the need for any whisking if it is stored - the emulsification is complete and the dressing has the consistency of mayonnaise.

REALLY GOOD!!! , did it in a blender with olive oil and raw garlic , came like a mayonese, fantastic flavour, next time will just take the garlic "soul" out!

Delicious recipe, although I agree with many of the other reviewers to use EVOO in lieu of peanut oil. I halved the amount of oil and substituted a couple of tablespoons of chopped capers for the anchovies. Turned out a little thin but had great flavor!

Top notch! Came out perfectly! This recipe is the perfect blend of ingredients, my Husband raved about how much he loved it. Please dont be squeamish about the anchovies {as some people are, myself NOT included.} Anchovies absolutely 'make' the dish. Without them you can't really call it 'Caesar', they blend with the other ingredients in the dressing enhancing them but not standing out on there own as overtly fishy. I will be making this again and serving it to my dinner guests this upcoming weekend! A keeper!

Skipped the anchovies since I'm a vegetarian and we were very impressed. Our dinner guests loved it it too. We'll definitely be making this again!

I used EVO, tabasco instead of the dried pepper flake, and two eggs. OUTSTANDING! The EVO hits your palate first, the mustard comes on, and then the garlic slaps into your tonsils. The rest is the aftertaste. WOW. This just became our "go to" Caesar dressing.

This has become my staple recipe for caesar dressing. I did use good EVO and only used about 3/4 cup. Turns out awesome every time. Had a litte pumpernickle bread and sauted bread cubes with olive oil and Penzey's garlic salt.

Really delicious. I used 150 ml olive oil (a mixture of extra virgine and plain), added 1 anchovy extra and used slightly less cheese, and it was wonderful.

Wow, really easy and delicious. This dressing has a nice kick to it. I used anchovy paste instead of anchovy fillets and it was still great. Definitely a keeper when making caesar salad.

THIS RECIPE WAS GREAT!! I first read some people's reviews and decided to substitute olive oil for peanut oil and i only used 2/3 of a cup instead of a scant cup. but other than that i kept it the same and it was soooo good! I loved it so much I even wrote this poem about it: yesterday i made some caesar it is a real crowd pleaser i added some wooster dijon and egg for a taste of it you will beg maybe youll get to try if you are nice or you can if you roll snake eyes with the dice i want to bathe in my special dressing about it being finished i am already stressing but no fear my friend! i can make more because i am a caesar salad whore

I strongly advise using olive oil rather than peanut oil. I'd increase all the seasonings by 50% but keep the amount of oil the same; it was slightly bland.

I love this recipe. It's become a go-to dressing for us. I substitute olive oil for peanut oil, however, and only use 2/3 a cup instead of the "scant cup" it calls for.

I've never made a recipe from epicurious that I didn't like. I look for the recipes with high ratings then read all of the reviews before I make it. This dressing was TERRIBLE and BLAND. I followed the recipe exactly--peanut oil was overpowering. The dressing tasted like peanuts with spices. I can usually add ingredients to fix a recipe, but there was no fixing this one. Oh, and one of the other reviewers was right--the recipe on other sites includes 1/3 cup olive oil.

Major yum! I omitted the red pepper flakes but otherwise followed the recipe and it is a winner. I did coddle the eggs first. I wonder about the oil because I doubled everything EXCEPT the oil and it was perfect. Restaurant quality.

Delicious. But how is this a vinaigrette? It's vinegarless.

This recipe has a typo. You will notice it says "whisk the oils". I researched Wolfgang Puck's Caesar Salad recipe, and on his website all is the same except for the addition of 1/3 cup of extra virgin olive oil. Nonetheless a keeper I think!

This is a quick, wonderful dressing! I make it all the time. I use anchovie paste from a tube and even substitute garlic powder for the real thing on occasion and it always turns out great.

Rating: 4
This was absolutely fantastic and easy to make. I was skeptical about the red pepper flakes because I didn't want my salad to be spicy, but I couldn't taste them at all. Next time, I would double the anchovies and maybe the worcestershire sauce. I coddled the egg before adding it. Even without these tweaks, this salad was SO good. One of the best caesar salads I've ever had! Do try it!

I used this dressing for a pasta salad and it was great! I used olive oil and coddled the egg-the idea of serving raw eggs, even organic, is too risky.

Excellent salad dressing -- more subtle in flavour than other recipes I've tried. Only variant was that I used anchovy paste versus fillets. Very creamy texture. Served with romaine lettuce, homemade croutons with parmesan cheese, and shavings of parm-reggiano. This may well become my "go to" dressing recipe.

Like others, I thought this was great. Easy to prepare, and I like that It can keep in the refrigerator for 10 weeks. I used about a tablespoon of anchovy paste and olive oil rather than the fillets and peanut oil.

Perfect. Caesar. Salad. Dressing. EXACTLY what I was looking for. Made according to recipe, except for substituting canola oil for peanut. Man, this is good....

Rating: 4
Really liked this Caesar dressing. Doubled the recipe for 4 heads of romaine and have lots of dressing left over. I used fresh anchovies. They really just disappear into the dressing. No one has to know. And increased the garlic by 1 1/2 times. Thanks other Epicurious commentors, Your comments help me decide what recipe to use and hints on how to improve the recipe.

By far the closest recipe to restaurant quality. I use olive oil instead of peanut, a little less parmesan than spec'd and I coddle the egg yolk. My daughter is a Caeser salad freak and she calls this "Dad's world famous Caesar dressing." I'll take that.

Rating: 3
This was good. Changes made were to use the yolk of the egg only as I normally do and to add another anchiove. Very subtle but good!

Pretty sure the 10 week is a typo. I believe it should read 1 week. Notice the work week is singular not plural!

Rating: 3
This is a good recipe if you like subtle flavors. I however thought it tasted like peanut oil (I used 1-3/4 cup for a double batch), and didn't have the bold lemon & garlic flavors that I prefer. The recipe however has potential, so I will try it again with half peanut oil and half safflower or olive oil, and will increase the lemon, garlic and anchovy (I used 1 tsp anchovy paste).

Rating: 4
Excellent ! Did use the raw egg - but couldn't test whether it's ok after 10 weeks - we finished it off in just two weeks.

Rating: 4
i agree that 10 weeks for a raw egg is too scary. i coddled the egg for 1 min and blended it in. used anchovy paste and lightened with 1/2 cup olive oil and 3 tbs plain greek yogurt. doubled the garlic and worcestershire. yummy

As a P.S. to previous post I made - I had some dressing left over. I brushed the dressing over some striped bass before grilling it. Outstanding! We've been using this caeser dressing recipe on grilled romaine lettuce. Slice a head of romaine lengthwise, brush with oil and grill until a little blackened and crispy on the outside but still cool and crunchy on the inside. Serve with this dressing, and shaved parmesan. You will be transformed! I promise you.

This is far tastier than any caesar dressing at the store and carries none of the preservatives. I followed the recipe exactly and found it very easy to make.

Excellent recipe. My kids would drink this if I let them. It has made them start eating salad - yay! I make it with about a cup of good extra virgin olive oil, Grey Poupon Dijon mustard, a bit less parmesan than called ofr and one or two extra anchovies. Marvelous. I also mix it up in a mini-food processor until it is every so slightly thickened.

Outstanding recipe. Simple, quick, great results. I substituted 1 tsp anchovy paste for the anchovy fillets, I used Miele dijon mustard, and used 1/2 cup Colavita olive oil, with 1/2 cup canola oil. I added about a 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt.

Wow. Excellent. I used extra virgin olive oil, a little less than a cup, a dollop of mayo just to smooth it out and 2 extra anchovies. I wanted to eat it with my finger, dip my bread in it, etc. My husband and I had none left! Can you really keep it for weeks with the egg in it? Excellent recipe.

Always amazing salad dressing! I used only a 1/2 c. olive oil. I "coddle" the egg in boiling water for 30 seconds just in case of bacteria. I have doubled the recipe too but would not double the chili flakes! Too much!

Absolutely the best caesar dressing that i've found! I put in 6 anchovies, doubled the garlic, and used olive oil and it was fabulous. I've been searching for the perfect caesar recipe since moving to europe and will look no more.

Delicious with a little tweaking. I used 5 anchovies fillets, and 1 1/2 times the garlic. I also used 1/2 tsp red pepper, and maybe 1 1/2 - 2x the lemon juice (but I used Meyer, so it wasn'too tart). I also used maybe 3/4 c olive oil. I didn't want it too greasy. I then sauteed some shrimp in butter, garlic and salt and threw them on top. Little bit of croûtons and my craving was satisfied and I've found a recipe worth holding on to.

This is by far the best Caesar dressing I've had. To make it even easier, use a food processor to blend the first seven ingredients (coarsely), then add oil (I use olive due to peanut allergies) in a thin stream. Remove blade and then add the cheese, salt and pepper. It keeps in the refrigerator and is great to have on hand.

Impressed, think this recipe is the closest to restaurant-style caesar that I've encountered. It needs tweaking somewhere, somehow, lacking a little oomph....and keeps for 10 weeks? really? with all that egg? perhaps a typo....?

I opted to try this version over Food Networks olive oil version and, wow, I'm truly amazed there aren't more reviews/ratings for this recipe. It is awesome. So for those who are reluctant, don't assume by the low number of ratings that it is so-so. It is not!! This is THE caesar salad dressing you've been looking for all along. It is so very delicious! It's the little-known secret that will wow your guests. Here Here Wolfgang.

Very close to my old-time favorite. I omit the red pepper flakes and subsititute the peanut oil for 1/2 Saflower and 1/2 Olive Oil for a more authentic, yet lighter taste. Also, I use a whole can of anchovies (oil and all) and add about 1/4 cup parmesian cheese. Everyone loves this one - even the people who say "I am so glad you don't use anchovies... I hate anchovies" :)

I'm slappin' my salad forks together in applause, that's some fine eating! Actually I think the intent with the peanut oil is to have a neutral base for the other ingredients. I used regular ol' vegetable oil with a little EVO--I think that all EVO would detract from the other flavors.

Excellent, very authentic (or at least what I'm used to as authentic). The only change I made was to substitute olive oil for peanut oil. Never heard of peanut oil in a Caesar recipe...oh and just a scant more Worsteschire...
