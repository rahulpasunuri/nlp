So simple and delicious - I agree with other reviewers about not minding getting your fingers messy with this dish! I liked the tomato relish, though found it a little too juicy. I cheated the mayo, adding the flavourings to 1 cup of store-bought olive oil mayonnaise. I skipped the cilantro-lemongrass dip, not wanting to open a can of coconut milke for only 1/2 cup. I too would probably serve this dish with a warm garlic or lime butter sauce. Definitely next time.

Almost bomb-proof, it's so easy. And it is a delicious result. Now a regular in my rotation.

So long as the seafood's fresh, there's no way to go wrong with this recipe. I made the three sauces two days ahead which worked to bring out the flavour.

I really enjoyed this dish. I don't think it was bland at all. The shallot mixture in fine, it lets the real flavor of the seafood come through. I skipped all the sauces and just made some lemon butter to dip as wanted. Delicious will make a again.

I made this for a nice dinner-for-two and we both thought it was delicious and elegant. The shallot mixture is easy and I use it all the time on fish, chicken, vegetables, and seafood. The trio of sauces I didn't really care for so I just added some of the shallot mix to some melted butter and it was great. Would definitely recommend for a simple or fancy dinner.

I'm not really sure what the other reviewers saw in this recipe except maybe an excuse to eat a lot of seafood. I thought the shallot "sauce" was on the bland side. The preparation was a breeze but there are many other tastier ways to prepare such a lovely assortment of seafood. I won't make this one again.

4 forks for the wow factor and it's simplicity in preparation. I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a hit. Just make sure the people you serve are willing to get their fingers messy to enjoy the crab legs and the shallot sauce to the maximum. I alsmost skipped the crab legs but my 21 year old insisted and I'm glad he did-they were the best part. After reading the reviews I made only the Roasted Tomato Sauce (the other two may be good but would require many more meals of other shellfish to be able to use these quantities and one sauce with the shallot sauce was enough of a sensory delight.

We made this for our gourmet supper club. This was a great way to cook the shellfish. We followed the times and everything turned out great. Made & used extra shallot/parsley mixture on the shellfish. Multiple sauces were fun. Based on reviews we made the Lime Butter Sauce; the Lemongrass & Cilantro with addition of lemon zest & juice, and fish sauce; the Roasted Tomato, Orange & Basil Relish with extra toasted cumin seeds. Made all the sauces 1 day ahead - which we think improved the flavors. Used "tin snips" to cut the lobster and crab shells. Left crab legs with just the one side cut - wasn't too hard to get the crab meat out. We'd do it all again!

I've made this twice now. It's very easy and delicious. I made extra shallot mixture, added olive oil, and served as an optional sauce. Also served a pesto mayo that worked really well with the scallops.

this turned out really well. didn't use lobster, increased the amount of shrimp instead. i halved the crab legs myself - and that was a pain - have it done for you if possible. i made the saffron sauce, and was, as reviews indicated, underwhelmed. cooking times were accurate - which i was worried about. served with a caesar salad / bread. i will for sure make again.

This was a superb, fun dinner! I too found the sauces disappointing, but the lime butter sauce from another recipe on this site was outstanding with this shellfish combination!

Outstanding! I made the saffron mayo and the cilantro sauces - both were just okay and I would not bother to make them again. The shallot sauce was the best. I will definitely be making this again!

Made this for X-mas dinner and everyone loved it. I skipped the trio of sauces and made more of the shallot sauce for dipping.Definitely a good choice for a special, high end dinner.

yum! We actually made this recipe with fresh lobster ($$$) but I think it was worth it! We tossed everything in the oven for about 7 minutes and then threw the lobster on the bbq which worked out really well since you can see everything a litte better. Plus the guests really ooh and aaw. (If using fresh lobster remember to crack the claws first or they will turn out salty b/c they cook in their own brine! oops) I tried the safron and the pesto sauces and they were kinda fun to try, but not worth the effort. We melted a couple cups of butter and added the shallots and parsley to that and it was perfect and not overdone.

Splendid!!! My family thought this was a holiday dinner. I agree w/ previous review to do in one pan and add the various seafood as needed and watch the timer. Considering the cost of the ingredients, this is very high end. I had the seafood man steam my lobsters and cracked and picked the meat myself then added them last. I also made each sauce and have a word of advice: Make the sauces the day before as they took me over an hour. Once guests ready to sit, combining the main dish takes only minutes. I served this with a fresh misto greens salad and crusty, toasted Italian bread bruchetta!

Easy and impressive. I made it just for the 2 of us so I used one pan for everything and just added the various seafood at the appropriate time. Next time I would under cook just a minute or 2 as everything continues to cook as it is being plated. I did not make the sauces except for the mayo. This is indeed a great party dish
