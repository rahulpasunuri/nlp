Really delicious. I made it because I had looked up another recipe in the same article that I had previously prepared. I added a little more chili powder. We drank a spicy red wine with it.

This recipe, with some modifications, is one of our family favorites. I add more spices, including cumin seeds, green and yellow diced peppers, chile powder, and fresh or frozen diced green chile, along with more onion and Rotel canned tomatoes, I also mix the cooked pasta with the sauce in the pan before serving.

I'm surprised by some of the low ratings - I use this recipe as one of my back-ups on a day that I need to make something quick, but want it to be healthy/lowfat and homemade. My whole family will eat it, it satisfies a pasta/carb craving, and isn't a typical pasta dish.... I often use 50% fat cheese. Very tastey.

This was a nice twist to "Monday Macaroni". But the jury is still out on whether I would re make this dish. I created more sauce, I as other subscribers, found it too dry. It was definately a fast, easy to prepare meal but not that remarkable.

One fork looks so negative; but it truly was "just so-so". The ground turkey sauce wasn't bad at all as written, but it was too dry for my liking. You could jazz it up to suit your tastes. I didn't get the pairing with rigatoni at all. First because the "sauce" didn't coat the pasta, it was like eating ground meat sprinkled on plain pasta, and also because I think the southwestern flavor would have been more vibrant with rice.

Oops, forgot to mention that I also used fire-roasted diced tomatoes instead of those mentioned in the recipe.

With a few adjustments, this wasn't bland. I used some vidalia onion, chipotle powder instead of chili powder, doubled the spices per another suggestion and added worcestershire sauce and red wine to the sauce to richen it. I didn't have fresh coriander, so I used ground coriander instead. I also used cheddar. Loved it!

i appreciate everyone's enthusiasm for this recipe; that's the reason i decided to make it. but it didn't do much for me. i added the mexican style tomatoes as suggested and a little extra heat, but i thought the recipe was still unexciting. i'll stick with the mac 'n cheese, ground beef, and canned tomato soup concoction if i'm interested in duplicating the mouth feel of this recipe.

After reading some of the reviews, I altered the recipe a bit. I used 1 medium sweet onion, thin sliced; 2 cloves garlic, minced; 1/2 yellow pepper, sliced; 1 T chili powder, 1/2 t cumin, 1/4 t cayenne pepper, 3/4 lb ground turkey; 1 14.5-oz can Mexican stewed tomatoes, 1 8-oz can tomato sauce, 1 c fresh corn. Serve on thin multi-grain spagetti and garnish with black beans and shredded medium cheddar. Just enough for my family of four. This recipe was a huge hit and I will definitely make it again.

Fantasic, quick, easy-great for a cold day. My boyfriend and i made this after coming home from the gym (starving of course) and with two of us chopping and grating (and drinking wine and having fun), we threw it together in 25 minutes! mmmm. my boyfriend raved about it. we served it with cheddar cheeese instead, whole wheat pasta (no, we're not health freaks) and doubled the spices, which was necessary (+ lots more cayenne!). yum. dishes like this don't make you feel guilty about indulging in that after-dinner cheese plate! yum.

My boyfriend and i loved this quick and easy recipe. it is healthy and delicious. i also opted to double all seasonings and added more heat with habanero chilli sauce. we are veggie fans, so we added celery and beans too. i also used cheddar, which worked really well, and added a squeeze of lemon juice at then end. hearty and satisfying.

I thought this recipe was so-so, my boyfriend thought it was FANTASTIC - took all the leftovers home with him. I added extra cumin and chili powder at the end because it seemed a little bland. He thought this was made with sausage and was really surprised that it was ground turkey. I'll make it again because it really is an easy meal, but I think I'll tweak the spices a little more.

This recipe is a great mid-week, family recipe. Definitely use the suggestions by previous reviewers. I doubled the seasonings, used penne instead of rigatoni, and added tomato sauce. I also added about a teaspoon of Frank's Red Hot Sauce for some extra flavor. This is a good basic recipe that you can easily make your own.

I just made this for my family and it was a hit! I didn't have the fresh red pepper so I used a can of diced green chiles. Also, cheddar cheese works well if you don't have jack. The seasonings were not exactly by the book, but any style of mexican seasoning you use would work. Also, I was out of fresh cilantro, so I used dried, I will make this again, next time I will plan ahead and get the fresh ingrediants.

This was a decent dish. I wasn't blown away, but it was a nice, quick dinner. I didn't have the coriander, so I'm not sure if that would have made a big difference. I did add some fresh chopped Italian parsley, which I though added a nice flavor to it.

This was really good,and I had all the ingredients on hand. I made a couple of substitutions. I used an orange pepper instead of the red, store bought minced garlic which is very good and for the herbs I used half parsley and half basil (I don't like coriander or cilantro for that matter),which turned out really well. I used san marzano canned tomatoes, if you can get them, use them because they are delicious. I served it with ziti and parmesan cheese, it was a big hit, I'd definitley make this again.

This was EXCELLENT! I can't wait to make it again. I used ground chicken, whole wheat pasta and added about 1/2 cup of salsa. Unbelievable! I wasn't expecting much based on the reviews but this is really worth a try.

This is easy and very flavorful. I did not have a fresh red bell pepper so use roasted from a jar. Also did not use coriander and it still had lots of life to it. I recommend this one and will make it again soon.

Very easy to make, great for during the week. It still took an hour from start to finish though. Very flavorful!

This was really easy and very good. My food market did not have fresh coriander so I used cilantro and it was great. I will definately make this again.

This is a good weeknight dinner--most of the ingredients are things we'd have on hand, and the preparation is a breeze. I have to say, though, that this feeds way more than two--not a complaint.

Given the rave reviews, I was a little disappointed with this recipe. It was ok, but nothing very special. Maybe ok for mid-week, but wouldn't serve to company.

I made this recipe follwing previous advice (included corn, black beans, extra tomato, doubled spices) and it was a HIT with my family. I served the sauce in a large bowl alongside jalepeno cornbread, omitting the pasta all together. Ole!

I took the advice of the other reviewers, and doubled the spices (except the caynne, I like hot but not smokin'), it was the right thing to do, I didn't feel it was too spiceful with the extra. I had in my freezer, blanched soy beans, I threw in about a cup or so and it added another meaty texture, plus they're really good for you. I also used whole wheat pasta, so this dish was pretty darn healthy and tasty! I used crushed tomatoes, (I've found that there is a greater ratio of tomato to juice in the can). And I simmered it all until it was more dry then wet, so it wasn't too soupy. Make extra, it's holds up well and is great the next day.

This recipe is great if you add the extra spices and tomato sauce. I also like to throw in a can of whole kernel corn and a can of rinsed and drained black beans. They really add some Southwetern texture and color to the dish.

This is pretty good. I wouldn't serve it to company, but it's quick, easy, and uses ingreadients that are always on hand. Plus, it seems to be relatively low-fat. It's a great dinner for the mid-week rush, give it a try!

I'm not sure what happened, but no one in my family liked this one. It sounded great, but just didn't have a lot of flavor.

This is a great recipe and an unusual twist on my favorite food group. I have made it several time over the last couple of months since I found it and will continue to make it in the future. Make sure that you follow the prior additions (ie tomatoe sauce and doubling the spices).

I have been making this dish for years, probably once a month since it was first published in 1991. I always substitute penne for rigatoni just becuase we like smaller pasta, and recently I made two other changes that I think make a big difference, so I'd like to share them. I increase the spices as other cooks have suggested, and now I add an 8-oz. can of tomato sauce in addition to the canned tomatoes. This makes the sauce MUCH richer. I also increae the simmering time to about 20 minutes. I also suggest adding the chopped cilantro at the very end. Otherwise, it gets cooked down and less flavorful. This is a wonderful weeknight dish and I'm sure it will continue to a staple in my repetoire.

Left Over Turkey? This is a great recipe to disguise one more day of left over turkey. Substitute leftovers for the ground turkey.

I followed the suggestions of others and added more spices and made more pasta -- this was really delicious and pretty quick and easy. I think next time I may add another can of tomatoes and make it more saucy.

A savory, easy, and quick recipe. For the same amount of turkey and tomato I usually double the amount of spices, EXCEPT the cayenne, which I cut in half. I have also tried to make it into a casserole, which was delicious.

Delicious! I took the advice of the cook from Maui, HI and used twice as much pasta, spices and garlic and the dish was wonderful and full of flavor. It was easy and quick to prepare, too. Great meal for after work and there was even enough for leftovers!

Have made this recipe many times and have always enjoyed it. I use more pasta than what is called for and add more (double)spices and (3) garlic. Use spicy Montery Jack. A regular work night recipe that is always good.
