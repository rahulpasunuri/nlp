I enjoyed this recipe, but my kids were not thrilled, too adult I guess. The flavor was exceptional. Since I used light coconut milk instead of coconut cream, the texture wasn't as creamy as I would have liked. I accidentally purchased the wrong coconut stuff at the store. It worked out fine and cut out a bunch of calories. I would make this recipe again and serve with Nilla Wafers or add mini chocolate chips before putting it into the ice cream maker.

This ice cream was one of the best I have ever eaten or made. I doubled the recipe, however. Also, I had ripe bananas in the freezer already. All I had to do was take them out and put them into the blender. That seemed to save a step and this recipe is a great way to use up those sweet but brown bananas. I served the ice cream with a rum carmel sauce, ginger tuile, and roasted pineapple. YUMMY!!

Based on the ingredients, I thought this ice cream would be really good. It wasn't awful but it wasn't good either. My two year old son loves ice cream but ran away saying "all done" after a bite of this ice-cream.

My wife said this was the best ice cream she had ever tasted. I certainly thought it was in the top 5. We served it with warmed organic peanut butter, crushed dark chocolate and whipped cream. One piece of advice: make sure the ice cream is pretty firm in the maker before taking it out, otherwise it freezes too hard to serve.

I tried this recipe for a Father's day celebration and was very disapointed based on the previous review. DECADENT? Not at all. Store bought ice cream is much better than this.

THIS IS SO DECADENT!!! It's almost sinful for how easy it is to make. I followed the recipe exactly, and all I can say is YUM! If you want to whip up something simple to impress your guests, here you go. A little chocolate sauce on this...Mmmmm!!! Definitely a keeper. A little chunky banana puree is a nice touch, too.
