Excellent! I added some cooked and chopped oyster mushrooms to the watercress cream reduction because I had them; fantastic!

This was an easy quick recipe that impressed my boyfriend and got a definite thumbs up. The left over sauce was really nice over scrambled eggs as well.

Very quick and easy. The spicy/sourness of the watercress works excellently with the cream sauce. The local market was all out of sea bass so I substituted fresh salmon. I also doubled the amount of sauce so 1/2 cup white wine - I used Orvieto - and 1/2 cup cream with 1/2 cup milk. I used a "bunch" of watercress so I'm not sure the exact measure but it was excellent. I served the fish over a bed of linguini and topped with the extra sauce.

My first time making sea bass - what an easy and simple recipe! Would highly recommend!

I think this dish is delicious. However, I think that it could use much less whipping cream in the sauce. But overall, this dish is quick, easy, and filling. I'm just 14 (trying to learn how to cook) and this took me all of... 30 mins. from start to finish.

Very very good and incredibly easy. (took about 10 minutes from start to finish) As suggested, I increased the sauce a little bit and it turned out great. Great for weekday dinner but also good enough for guests.

Incredibly easy. I substituted scallions and half-and-half for the shallots and cream since I didn't want to run back to the store. I served it with Jasmine rice and a dry white wine. If it was this good with scallions and half-and-half, I will HAVE to try it with the shallots and the cream! One suggestion: Make extra sauce. The sauce seems to disappear quickly once the eating begins.

This was outrageously good. I made it for a date and impressed the hell out of him!!
