Picked up a bottle of verjus from a winery in sonoma. Basically grape juice on it's way to becoming vinegar. Used it over basic baked black cod and was wonderful on top of the quinoa served with the dish as well.

FYI -- after wondering what the HECK "verjus" was (and there is no entry in the Epicurious dictionary), I finally did a recipe search for it and came up with this -- verjus is the juice of unripe fruit. In another recipe, it calls for 2 T verjus, or 1 T lemon juice. Also it says, "Verjus is available at some specialty food shops and by mail order from Dean and DeLuca. Call 212-226-6800 ext. 268 "
