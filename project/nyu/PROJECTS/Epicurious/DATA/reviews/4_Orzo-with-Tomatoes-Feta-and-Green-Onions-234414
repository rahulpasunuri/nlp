Not bad, but nothing amazing. It pained me to dump all that chicken stock down the sink, and I really didn't find it made a huge difference anyway. I prefer Gourmet's orzo with feta and cherry tomatoes (July 1999). That one's awesome!

Rating: 4
Like all - everyone asked for the recipe. To be able to make far ahead BUT keep all fresh, I cooked hte orzo the night b4 and put the dressing on it. Then 2 hours b4 serving the next day i took out of refridge, and added all the tomatoes, basil, cheese, etc. I used a full box of the heirloom tomato variety which gave the salad even more color.Very delicious - perhaps a bit heavy on the olive oil. I;ll take that down a notch next time i make.

This is my go-to summer potluck/picnic dish! I usually make extra of the dressing for other salads and add mint and cilantro to the mix so the total herb amount is equal to 1 c. roughly. I also have added in cucumber, red onion and sweet peppers. I'd really recommend the addition of fresh mint, it really makes it amazing!

This year on my organic farm I grew some tiny, blueberry-sized cherry tomatoes. They're sweet and very flavorful. It's harvest time and I have a million of them, and this recipe is perfect for using them up. The sweetness of the tomatoes blends perfectly with the honey/vinegar flavors of this salad, and their rich red color adds visual appeal. I don't change a thing when I make it, except I rarely have pine nuts on hand, but I don't think it makes that much difference.

Rating: 4
This is my favourite summer recipe, to add on to anything barbequed and for any summer party. I go crazy with the tomatoes, green onions, feta and basil, but omit the pine nuts because my boyfriend is allergic to them. It doesn't taste like anything is missing though. Giada hit the nail on the head.

Fantastic recipe! All I can say is DO NOT overcook the orzo. Too much liquid is fine. Just drain it off. But don't let the orzo get stuck together or you have a mushy salad.

I was very disappointed with this recipe, especially given the rave reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, minus the pine nuts. But, the vinegar was too overpowering for all of us.

I took the recommendation to bump the honey to just under 1 TBSP. And doubled the tomatoes. I liked this mix very much. I felt that the feta was perfectly balanced with the vinegar.

I've made this many times, and it's always a big hit. To turn it into a mail meal, I add chunks of chicken. I cook the chicken in water, and then use the fresh broth to cook the orzo. Also, I roast the pine nuts, about 10 minutes in the oven to brown them. I like to eat it a little warm, but it's great room temp or even right from the fridge. Highly recommend.

It was ok, but not as great as I expected based on the reviews. If I were to make it again, I'd use some of the ideas from the other reviewers like adding cucumbers, peppers and mozzarella cheese instead of feta.

This is a very tasty and delicious salad with a flavor similar to greek salad. It is delicious hot or cold. I also like to add cucumbers, bell peppers and olives to this. I do find that I prefer to cut the oil in half for my own preference.

This salad recipe is so amazing, I just can't say enough about it! Giada really hit the mark on this one in a major way. This recipe is perfect as is, make sure to use every component here, they are all important for optimal flavor and texture. Also, use fresh basil it makes all the difference! I add a little more cracked black pepper at the end, and increase the honey to a scant tbsp, but other than that, I follow it to a tee. I am seriously considering packaging and selling this salad, it's that good!

I made this several times as written and have changed the dressing a bit since the red wine vinegar left it a little pungent for us. More lemon and honey, less olive oil, and white wine vinegar. Good in-season tomatoes and basil are a must! Yum!

No changes for me. This is simple and quick, although you need to plan ahead for time for the pasta to cool. Great summer staple and a perfect vehicle for some homegrown tomatoes.

I make a rendition of this quite often...great to take to any "potluck"! Along with the other ingredients, I also add julienned oil-cured sun dried tomatoes, and sliced Calamata olives, ( and in the vinaigrette also add cracked pepper, garlic & small bit of oregano.) I use real Feta made with Sheep's milk just because I think it has a better flavor ("VIGO" brand is a good one) and someone mentioned Goat's Cheese...that's great as well instead of Feta. YUMMY!

This was a really good pasta salad, I didn't use broth just plain salted water to cook the orzo. I found there was rather more dressing than I needed, but everyone seemed to love it.

Rating: 2
I find this recipe adequate and tasty, and was complemented well enough by others when I brought the dish to a party, but a definite candidate for tweaking. It's certainly nothing special as is, but a simple and healthy pasta dish with lots of potential. My next version will cut back a lot on the chicken broth, for the flavor was pungent! and overpowered the veggie elements. I will up the basil and ponder other crisp greenery to add to the mix.

Rating: 4
I cannot count how many times people have had 2nd and 3rd of this as well as the number of people who have asked for the recipe. I too nearly double the pine nuts and add extra feta and use a little less than a cup of green onions. I just use grape or cherry tomatoes cut into 4ths for easier smaller bites. I can't get enough of this and it is very easy.

I wish I could give this 5 forks! Love it, love it, love it! I used more pine nuts than called for and some extra feta. Couldn't find the right shape tomato so just used red and yellow regular tomtatoes diced. Everyone wanted this recipe. Will be in my regular rotation for sure.

the mix of tomatoes and green onions is wonderfully fresh. i used the feta with basil/herbs and that was really lovely. i may add more real basil later. i think adding bell peppers would be good too. it does make a lot; for everyday, i might split the amount of orzo, and make it more veggie'd. tip: let the orzo cool, i think my feta melted a bit bc the orzo was still too warm.

I made half of the recipe and used all of the ingredients as they are listed except for halving the amount of feta. We have fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden, and the flavors were wonderful. The only change I would make is to use less olive oil. The dressing was a little too oily.

Subbed quinoa for the orzo (ran out) and added shrimp - it was delicious! My husband raved AND it was much more healthy!! Cut recipe in half since it was just the 2 of us (cook quinoa according to directions - 1 part quinoa to 2 parts broth). Will def. make again!

WOW! what rave reviews. I like this but didn't love it. I used assorted heirloom cherry tomatoes and thought that would put it over the top. I had to toss out my basil and that may be the secret to the great reviews.

I love this recipe! The orzo is a nice change from traditional pasta salad. Besides using different types of tomatoes to use the freshest available, I make the recipe as is. Wouldn't change a thing. It's to die for if you have garden-fresh basil and tomatoes on hand. Makes a lot, so it's great for a party. Leftovers are still just as delicious, but you will need to eat them up within 2 or 3 days. I have made this twice and am making it yet again for a 4th of July cookout tomorrow.

I loved this. We enjoyed it at an outdoor dinner in the Texas heat, and it was the perfect cool dish. I thought it needed a bit of salt, and then realized that I had forgotten the Feta cheese. So, if you've got somebody who does not like feta, save them a serving and then dress according to directions. Actually, I think 12-16 serings is more reasonable estimate than 8.

I have made this recipe countless times to rave reviews. It is the only recipe I've ever made that causes people to (1) request the recipe and (2) request that I bring it to events. That said, I do change it a bit (sorry!) and substitute edamame for the pine nuts. Cooking the orzo in the chicken broth is critical. Do not drain the stock off - just let the orzo sit in it until fully absorbed. Also, I tried it with arborio rice this weekend for a friend who can't eat gluten - everyone loved it, but I had to make 2-3x the vinaigrette to give it any flavor. I highly recommend this dish.

This is a great side dish with little effort and easy to find ingredients. I originally made this as a side dish for a summer dinner and my boyfriend, and we both loved it. I also made this for a small group of women when it was my turn to bring a "snack" to our committee meeting. This second time, I did substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth, as I was not sure if there were any vegetarians in the group. It still turned out really well. Everyone enjoyed it and asked for the recipe. I've made it a few more times, and it always turns out great.

About 2 years ago when I first found this recipe, I saved it in my recipe box and have made it many, many times to rave reviews. We like it so much I don't just make it in the summer when the tomatoes are in the garden, but in winter when yellow tomatoes are very difficult to find here in MN. I just put in more red grape tomatoes and it's just as wonderful. I've never messed with the recipe as we find it to be perfect just the way it is!!

This was a very pleasant dish. I rarely cook with orzo, so this was an interesting change. I used very fresh tomatoes from the farmers' market, which helped. I omitted the pine nuts ($$) and added about 1 cup of edamame. That made it a little healthier and full of some protein.

We don't even like feta cheese, normally! Friends at work wanted the recipe. This is great for a potluck.

This is absolutely delicious. Fresh-tasting and light. I omitted the pine nuts. I halved the recipe and I still think it would serve 6 people. Wonderful. Will definitely be making this again.

A huge hit! Served with a lamb loin and greek salad.

I LOVE this salad and so do all the guests I make it for. I use more feta than the recipe calls for and I cook the orzo for 8 minutes only. This is such a winner.

What great flavors! I halved the recipe for a bbq lunch for 7 people, and it was enough as a side dish. I omitted the pine nuts, only used one can of chicken broth (and the remainder salted water), and the pasta tasted nice and seasoned. I used a good quality lemon-infused olive oil instead of plain, and I didn't have honey on hand, so I sub'd 1/2 a teaspoon of brown sugar, and it was just the right amount of sweetness for the dressing. I probably added an extra big pinch of chopped basil and few extra cubes of feta cheese than the recipe calls for. The flavors just meld so well! A big hit!

This is a very quick and easy summer salad recipe. I skipped cooking the orzo in broth and didn't miss it. I substituted fresh mint for the basil (by necessity) and quite liked it. Definitely make this a day ahead - it is much better after it sits a bit. It's really a 2 1/2 fork recipe.

Although I like the idea of orzo instead of other pasta for a different pasta salad, I was not that impressed with the flavor of this. I have tasted better pasta salads. This also makes a huge ammount so unless you are making it for a lot of people you might want to half it. If I made it again, I would add olives or red pepper also.

Couldn't stop eating it. It was delicious and easy to make. You need the fresj basil and the feta.

I've made this dish twice and have garnered rave reviews. The addition of the fresh basil really adds a punch and you can never go wrong with feta.

This is a beautiful salad with great flavors. I couldn't find yellow tomatoes, so I used yellow bell pepper for added color, and had extra snow peas which I also used. Delicious!

This was terrific, and a great base recipe for nearly anything you'd like to add. The dressing was a bit tart so next time I'll omit 1 Tbs. of the lemon juice. I added some finely diced sun dried tomatoes (maybe 3-4 Tbs) and the same amount of capers. I also added some oregano and served it on a bed of baby spinach (so that any leftovers didn't have wilty spinach leaves). I substituted Bermuda onion for the green onion as well. It was great w/ the "Grilled Butterflied Leg of Lamb with Lemon & Herbs" from this site and some roasted asparagus.

This was very good and so easy. I threw a couple of chicken bouillon cubes in the orzo cooking water instead of using and draining away canned broth. It tasted fine. I also had only roma tomatoes, so I seeded and diced those rather than going to the store for the grape or teardrop varieties. I made this for a light dinner for my husband & myself...had enough leftovers for my lunch the next day. Of course, almost everything with feta and pine nuts is a keeper in my book. Will definately make again.

Fantastic. I served this at a large dinner party, and my guests had eaten it all almost before I sat down.

Great Recipe, thought I'd have to be stuck with lots of leftovers, but guests devoured everey bit.

We loved it. Nice change from standard pasta salads. Try it at room temperature, too. I actually think it's better like that than straight from the fridge.

Excellent. I have made this twice for company. Everyone loves this pasta salad. Definately use the chicken stock to cook the orzo. It wouldn't be the same with water.

Terrific dish! Will definitely make this again.

Really good. I didn't have lemons so I used fresh lime juice and it was still fantastic. I also don't know how much a pound of orzo is (mine is in a glass container on my countertop!) so I used 2 cups (uncooked). My husband loved it and asked me to make it again as soon as possible.

It's good the first night and even better the second and third nights. Simple and delicious.

We've made this a couple times now and it's been a big hit ! We originally used it as part of an Easter family dinner then had it as part of an informal outdoor event. Easy to make and works well with much done in advance.

I tripled this recipe and seved it with Grilled Flank steak for a buffet dinner for 30. I actually forgot to include the feta cheese and I still got rave reviews and many requests for the recipe!

What a hit! Extremely versatile recipe. Made it twice in a week. Added diced carrots for extra crunch and color. Tossed in grilled chicken for a great leftover lunch the next day. Everyone who's tried it has loved it. A real winner!

I absolutely love this recipe. I put it together except for the tomatoes the day before serving, then refrigerated overnight. Tossed it with another batch of dressing and added the tomatoes right before serving. It was the hit of the party. Everyone wanted the recipe. Thanks, Giada!

I REALLY liked this recipe. Easy to make and the flavor is excellent. Light and flavorful. I did not include cheese, as I didn't have any, and it was still extremely tasty. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

Very simple and delicious recipe. A change from regular salads. I agree that it is very suitable for a party.

Delicious and easy! I left out the olives, as I'm not a big fan, but otherwise was true to the recipe. It made quite a bit, but my husband and I ate it all in only a couple of days. This would be a great dish to bring to a party, as it's bite size and doesn't require heating.

I grilled and diced chicken breasts using the rub from Grilled Butterflied leg of Lamb with lemon, herbs and garlic (from Epicurious.com) and added to this salad. I also added Kalamata olives, doubled the vinagarette, and only put in about 1 tbsp of olive oil. I didn't think this recipe made too much- it was perfect for a gathering. Totally yummy!!!!

I thought this was a great yummy summery pasta salad. I cut the olive oil and ended up using equal amounts of the red wine vinegar and olive oil. I would consider adding strips of grilled chicken next time for a complete meal.

I wasn't overly impressed, and thought that cooking the pasta in chicken broth was unnecessary. Gourmet's Orzo with Feta and Cherry Tomatoes is my favorite orzo recipe so far.

This is a great (and easy!) recipe. I made it for a crowd and everyone loved it. The combination of flavors are a favorite of mine.

I love this recipe. It's so easy to make and everyone always raves. I like it with chickpeas and mint and I add a bit more honey to take away a little of the 'bite' from the lemon juice. This is also good with mozzerella instead of feta.

This was a great pasta salad, and nice to be able to make it and leave setting out while you finish dinner. Made no changes to the recipe. The orzo cooks in about 10 minutes. Hard to stir before adding the dressing, then it stirs quite easily. Was great as cold leftover lunch the next day. Everyone liked it. I would definitely make it again and it is ideal as a dish to pass.

I made this last night for the first time and loved it! It had such different flavors and went great as a side. It does make a LOT though. This would be perfect to bring for a holiday get together!

i made this for the first time last night and everyone liked it. I did halve the recipe as I did not want any leftovers--I also made it ahead of time and refrigerated it. I took it out to stand at room temp about an hour before we ate it--it did need a bit more dressing which I reserved just for that purpose.

It was perfect. I used a French feta which tastes like a cross between Greek feta and goat cheese, but would be just as good with Greek feta. A real keeper.

I cooked it in water and cut the Olive oil in half. We loved it. The fresh basil is a great flavor enhancer. Makes alot - was good for a side dish for 2 at dinner, then 3 lunches for one. Keeps well for 2 days. Thinking of adding cooked chicken strips to it next time for a full course meal.

I haven't made this yet, but I would highly recommend checking out the Orzo with Everything recipe on this site, because it was excellent. This recipe just looks mediocre.

Rating: 2
I might tweak the dressing proportions if I make this again. It's very heavy on the olive oil & I found the result a bit rich, even though I was also using less than half the called-for feta. I thought the yield was high too -- I will probably get lunch for a week out of this, at least.

Very good and easy as pie. I made some changes: used veggie broth in place of chicken, sliced almonds instead of pinenuts, and left out the basil. Very enjoyable. The broth added a bit of creaminess to the texture and sort of a "comfort food" element to this dish, I thought. I did feel bad about just draining the broth away after cooking, however, so next time I may try it with just water and see if it's still good. I would have given this dish four stars except it had a slightly bitter/acidic aftertaste, maybe from the onions.

This is a great make ahead side dish to lamb - and a great left over served at room temp (that is, when you have some left!)

This was an outstanding side dish with our surf & turf Easter dinner. Didn't have pine nuts, so I added sliced water chestnuts for crunch. Also added roasted (thin) asparagus, cut into bite sized pieces. I will definitely make this again.

This was a wonderful recipe!! The only thing I had to change was I used lime juice instead of lemon juice only because I realized (at the last minute) I didn't have any lemons! It really was terrific.

Everyone enjoyed this salad. It has a lot of flavor. I agree with the previous reviewer that it's nice to serve as a side dish because it sits at room temperature. My husband is not a fan of onions and felt that it could use fewer green onions. Overall, it was a big hit.

Excellent salad... fresh, clean, flavors. It's a great side dish because it can sit at room temperature while you are preparing the rest of a meal.
