I really like these. However, I find the batter too thick. I add an extra egg and the batter is much better.

Nice product - good taste and crispyness. For me the best thing about this recipe is the proportions - I only have one 12-shell pan. I will try some different flavour modifications... I dream of ginger & currant or lime & coconut!

I really loved the combination of all the different spices. The madeleines came out great, the texture was right, the flavor nice. A very nice change to the simple madeleines. Side notes: if you want youe madeleines to rise properly, place the batter at least 30 minutes in the fridge before baking it. Also, these are best eaten the day they are made, they do not keep very well.
