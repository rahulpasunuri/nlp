I always get a great response when I make these. I usually substitute dried cranberries for the raspberries and drizzle dark chocolate over the finished cookies (I do keep the white chocolate chunks in the cookies themselves, I've tried it with dark as well but the sweetness of the white chocolate is necessary). I've also made them with vanilla extract (used double the suggested amount) with good results. Almond gives it a more traditional flavor, the vanilla makes it taste more like a dessert. The first time I made these was as a christmas cookie. Sent some along with the boyfriend to his grandmother's house and she said they were the best biscotti she's ever had! I've made them every christmas since, and they're always a hit! Pretty and juuust fancy enough to give as gifts.

Flavor was fabulous, but recipe was dry and crumbly and very hard to work with. Also made Chocolate-Orange Biscotti which was much easier to work with, so next time I will try to alter the base recipe slightly by using 1/2 cup butter instead of the canola oil. Also had a hard time with the white chocolate dip - too thick and overpowering. Found that doing a white chocolate drizzle rather than a dip gave a nice balance and a nice presentation.

These were delicious with a few minor revisions. I used raw almonds and freeze dried raspberries since I could not find regular dried ones. To enhance the raspberry flavor I substituted Chambord for 1/2 of the almond extract.They were good without the chocolate dip but would be even better with it.

This recipe is not bad but I replaced the white chocolate with dark chocolate - personal preference. And I replaced the cranberry. All in all not bad. The best biscotti I have had come from a place near my house here in Scottsdale called Gina's Homemade. I got them in a gift basket but have bought more from them at

The smell alone is enough to make this recipe! I used dried cranberries instead of rasberries and they turned out delicious. My family started eating them before I could start cooking them a second time.

This was so easy to put together and just outstanding!! Everyone loved it. I used dehydrated raspberries that I found at my local natural foods store and they were fabulous.

These are fantastic! Of course, I changed up the ingredients. I could only find dried cranberries, I had walnuts on hand, and only olive oil. They turned out fantastic. A good friend of mine who was born and raised in Italy said they were the "BEST ITALIAN BISCOTTI I'VE EVER HAD!" She asked me to bake them again. So I'd definitely give them 5 forks if I could.

This was perhaps the most difficult recipe I have ever made, but it was only because I was unwilling to change the recipe despite the fact that I couldn't find dried reaspberries or shelled pistachios. (I dried my own berries and shelled all of the pistachios.) My persistance paid off and the biscotti was incredible. My coworkers, family, and friends were delighted to recieve homemade biscotti as a Christmas gift in '05 after the recipe was first printed. I still remember how delicious it was, so if I ever find the ingredients in my local grocery stores, I'll make this again.

I've made this recipe each Christmas since the recipe was printed in 05. Have heard "best biscotti I've ever had." I use a mix of dried berries since dried raspberries are hard to find. Also, I always make at least a double batch. I replace 1 egg (out of the recipe's 6) and the canola oil with with 1/2 cup of butter. These biscotti are just great.

Instead of trying to dip the chocolate, I melted some dark chocolate and brushed a layer on top of each biscotti so I get chocolate in each bite. I used dark chocolate to offset the white chocolate in the biscotti itself. These disappeared in a day at my office with one friend telling me, "this is the best biscotti I've ever had." Enjoy!

I didn't have raspberries or strawberries so tried dried blueberries and cranberries. I haven't even dipped in chocolate yet and already my husband is taking them off the cooling rack. Delish!

My husband and I loved this biscotti. It was easy to make and very delicious. I used dried cranberries instead of the raspberries. I will be adding these to my sweet table at Christmas. I highly recommend this recipe.

These were terrific biscotti! That said, I made the following changes: no almond extract; instead, just a little vanilla extract and a lot of lemon zest. The lemon added a freshness to the biscotti, and worked very well with the cranberries. Used whole-wheat flour for added crunch. Used Ghirard. white chocolate for dipping, which is good b/c that brand's white chocolate is very sweet! Overall, a delicious crispy snack.

I use to make my mother's delicious biscotti and never would try any other. I broke down and tried this recipe and I was won over. Loved them. Only I had trouble with the chocolate getting hard on the biscotti. Am I using the wrong type of chocolate? I didn't have Lindt or Perguria.

Just tried a test run of 1/2 this recipe in advance of trying to make them for Christmas presents. Delicious! Although I think I'll try to smooth them out a bit on top and flatten then (I wasn't too sure about the "drop by teaspoon in to logs" instruction). The texture was excellent - I probably undercooked them a little bit than recommended. And they were really easy to mix up. Will definitely make again - only next time a double batch for give-aways.

Wanted to impress Husband's new boss last Xmas and use all local ingredients from northern California: local Almonds for pistachios, dried cranberries for raspberries, Ghiradelli chocolate for the Lindt, and local Olive oil for the canola. Came out incredible! I'm already planning on baking this year's TRIPLE batch to give out again as gifts!

I'm not really sure why everyone loves this recipe. I've read all the reviews and there's one in there that talks about substituting butter for shortening and there's not even any mention of either in this recipe at all! And that's the problem with this dough - I've made it four times and was careful not to over mix it to over develop the gluten but it always came out way too hard. And that's because there's NO type of lard or fat in it to make it softer. I know biscotti is a "dunking" cookie but this is ridiculous. You're supposed to be able to bite down on it without coffee too. If I made this for my bakery it would never sell!

These are absolutely amazing! Not only for it's low fat content, but also for it's flavor! I couldn't stop eating them! However, the dough was much drier than I expected but the biscotti turned out wonderful. I didn't use all the cranberries or pistachios that were required-- less is more. I highly recommend!

I used things I had on hand, dried cherries (mine were Rainier) and slivered almonds. This was the best biscotti ever. i had a fondue party and used these to dip into Chocolate Grand Marinier fondue. There were 20 guests and I am still getting calls about the biscotti. It was great without the fondue as well. Make this one it was awesome!!!

I would like to make this again...but it really didn't turn out for me. The logs didn't dry out the first time and were soft and crumbly when I sliced them and they didn't dry out during the second round of baking either. I am wondering if subbing half shortening for the butter affected it badly. Help anyone? They taste fabulous though.

Follwed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfectly! Sent them to work with my husband and everyone begged for more. The dried raspberry and pistachio combination makes these biscotti over the top!

Fantastic! I used dried cranberries instead and it was delicious. I have also used white and milk chocolate chunks in place of the pistachios and fruit. Really yummy!

Rave reviews all around. I substituted dried cherries for the raspberries and dipped one side in a combination of semi-sweet and bittersweet chocolate. Fantastic!

A very good biscotti. I substituted cherries for the cranberries. Also, mine took much less time to bake than the recipe suggested.

I made these several times during this holiday season. The first time I made them exactly to recipe (Trader Joe's has dried cranberries and shelled pistachios) and they were wonderful. The second batch was made without nuts, for friends who have allergies, and I also added some cranberries and a few chocolate chips. They were just as delicious. This is really a good biscotti recipe!

I made this recipe several times during Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays and got raves. I exchanged the dried raspberries for dried cherries and pistachios for hazelnuts but would have been pleased to use the original ingredients. The recipe has a lot of forgiveness and comes out a delightful texture that is dry enough for dunking in coffee but not as cardboard-like as store-bought versions. Many thanks!

yummy!! i used salted pistachios and just soaked and rinsed for a minute, then dried in paper towels. i also chopped the pistachios for easier chewing. whole pistachios seemed too big. i used 1 T. brandy instead of almond flavoring. good dough just for eating uncooked, too, if that's not too gross! also, i used a bit of the flour mixture to sprinkle on the raspberries - mine were so sticky straight out of the bag i was worried they would clump up in the batter. easy and will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I could not find dried rasberries and used stawberries. No problems! I also couldn't find unsalted nuts but it was still ok. This is the first biscotti recipe that has turned out perfect for me! The dough wasnt' undercooked liked usual. great flavor!

I couldn't find raw pistachios or dried raspberries so I used toasted and cherry flavored Craisins. I had to add some water to the dough to get it to be the right texture, but it came out wonderfully. I get together with girl friends to do Xmas cookies, so I did the batter and first bake ahead, then finished baking at the friend's house. They came out great!

This is definitely a keeper! I was unable to find dried raspberries so I used cranberries instead with no problem. As my husband does not like things too sweet, I did not dip these in chocolate and it wasn't missed. This was my first attempt at biscotti and I will definitely try other recipes now!

Yum! I had always planned to use cranberries instead of raspberries since it was what I had on hand. But when I reached for the pistachios, I found they were rancid so in a pinch I used walnuts. The cookies were still fabulous! The recipes baking instructions were a little confusing. I referenced other biscotti instructions and just formed two 12-inch logs. I followed the rest of the instructions as written.

These came out the best of any biscotti I've ever made - they cut beautifully with no crumbling and have a nice texture to go along with their full flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, including the dried raspberries. I might mention that 2 friends of mine made these using dried cranberries instead of the raspberries, and the texture was much harder than mine, which makes me wonder if the moisture in the dried raspberries made the difference...in any case, these are pretty and fairly effortless, and therefore will be a keeper!

These are wonderful! I made a batch for Christmas gifts and will probably end up making two because they keep disappearing around the house.
