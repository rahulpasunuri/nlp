Oh my goodness... we didn't have cream on hand, so I made the pudding with 2% milk. Making the custard first and pouring it on the bread made the smoothest-textured bread pudding I've ever had. Amazing. I made it with plain white bread, not pumpkin bread, so it wasn't all that sweet-it definitely benefited from a sweet sauce.

I cheated and used a Krusteaz pumpkin bread box mix and my dessert still turned out incredibly well. I used Calvados in both the caramel sauce and the bread pudding which melded really well with the pumpkin. People who were not actually at my dinner party are now asking me to make this for them because they heard how good it was!

This was a real hit! I doubled the recipe and made a small loaf and a larger loaf; we enjoyed the small loaf just as bread and I cut the large loaf into cubes that I let dry out for a day and a half. Followed the bread pudding recipe to a "t" (omitting the bourbon only) and it was terrific. Only used cinnamon and nutmeg in the caramel sauce and omitted the alcohol there as well. Yum! I'm making this again today for a friend (will lace hers with the bourbon), and have sent the recipe to two other friends. Definitely a winner!

This was a delicious and impressive addition to our Thanksgiving table. I'd give it 3.5 forks if I could, but there are a few suggestions I'd make: The recipe is quite time-consuming with many components. I do recommend making the bread from scratch with the attached recipe as it is very good, but make it in advance, if you can, to spread out some of the work. I added some additional spices to the bread, 1/4 tsp each of ground ginger and ground cardamom. As other reviewers have noted, the final product is quite sweet. I reduced the sugar in the bread by 1/4C but next time I would reduce the recipe's overall content by a total of 1/2C, probably by cutting an additional 1/4C from the custard. As it relates to that, serve with freshly whipped but unsweetened cream; anything else will just make it cloying. I used Honey Jack in place of the bourbon and it added great flavor and depth without tasting at all of alcohol. The caramel sauce was amazing but it was looser than I expected, so not sure if I undercooked it or what. Instead of the pumpkin seeds, I served with dried cranberries that I plumped in warmed Apple Calvados. The tartness was a nice contrast to the sweetness of the pudding.

I haven't made the pudding yet (I'm doing that on Friday), but I have routinely made the pumpkin bread recipe that goes with this. DELICIOUS! I serve it warm with a scoop of Blue Bunny Homemade Vanilla ice cream (read the contents of that one, no preservatives, just whatever we'd use to make it at home).

It's a real pet peeve of mine when someone gives the amount of certain ingredients by volume when it's more appropriate to have them by weight. Case in point, this recipe: 8 cups pumpkin bread? How about giving them in ounces? Even bread in grocery store aisles list their servings in ounces. Robert Flay should know better.

My only criticism is that mine does not look as pretty as the picture. The pumpkin bread comes out pretty dark creating more a brown pudding than an orangey one. But other than that, this recipe is absolutely delicious. Just make the bread a day or two ahead and then it's not so time-consuming to assemble the pudding.

This was very good bread pudding. I did use another recipe for the pumpkin bread. I served this for Thanksgiving topped with the caramel sauce and mincemeat ice cream. The fruit and pecans in the ice cream added a nice element to the dish.

While a multiple-day endeavor, this was worth it. I followed the recipe, except to reduce the amount of sugar in the pumpkin bread to about 3/4 cup since a number of people on the FN site wrote it was too sweet overall. It made the most sense to reduce the pumpkin bread's sugar since most bread puddings are made with regular, unsweeted bread and the custard and sauces would be enough. I made the pumpkin bread several days in advance so it would dry out some. I made not only the Spicy Caramel Apple Sauce to accompany, but also the vanilla creme anglaise that is published with the FN recipe from last year's Throwdown. With the sweetness of the caramel and anglaise, the reduced sugar in the bread wasn't noticed at all. If you don't mind recipes that use up every saucepan you own, this one is for you. It isn't simple but can be broken up, with the sauces made the day before. Loved it!

I was skeptical about using a quick bread for bread pudding because I typically like something really crusty that retains a lot of body, but... wow this was good! I was a little distracted by my toddlers while I was baking, and I completely forgot about the water bath. I'm guessing the purpose of the bath is to prevent curdling, but the recipe turned out great without it. My family was so-so on the caramel sauce, so I probably wouldn't bother next time. As delicious as this dessert was, we liked it even better cold for breakfast the next morning.
