Made this tonight and it was very good. The sauce is wonderful. Served it with mashed potatoes and spinach & mushrooms tossed with truffle oil. It was a satisfying, hearty dinner.

Came to website looking specifically for a riblet recipe. I found and printed this out only to find, once I was set up to prepare the dish, that the riblets were just used for making the sauce. No. no. no. We don't waste anything. The recipe does not state what to do with the riblets after they are sauted. Will not make it again.

I used olive oil instead of veg oil, diced bacon instead of pork riblets, just chicken broth, a mixed-berry jelly and no corn starch. I also added shallots and whole garlic.

I just made two chops so I skipped the riblet step and instead cooked the chops as in the recipe, and used the pan I cooked them in to make the sauce. I did not have current jelly on hand so I used currents and a dash of sugar. I used a combo of chix stock and veal demi. No cornstarch thickening needed. Sides of mashed Roquefort potatoes w/Port carmelized onions and green beans made a nice home cooked meal with a gourmet twist.

I halved the recipe and made the sauce from leftover pork broth I wanted to use. I served the reduced sauce on a plate with pork chops I'd cooked in an iron skillet with a small amount of oil. I did not thicken the sauce with cornstarch. The sauce was scrumptious--a definite do-again. I served mashed Yukon Gold potatoes and Napa cabbage slaw.

Exceptional sauce, I put the loins in the sauce as it thickened. I used rib tips in place of the riblets. Later, made pulled pork sandwiches from the tips rather than discarding them.

We thought this was very good dish. The sauce and pork chops was very good, although I didn't make it with the suggested sides. Made the sauce with the bones instead of riblets like others suggested.

This dish is ok but it was to much trouble to make again for the taste.

My husband and I both enjoyed the sauce in this recipe. I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe!!! Peppery with a touch of sweetness from the currents. I've made this recipe twice now and it was a hit both times!!!! The sauce is what makes this. I'll definitely be making this again

This dish was excellent-my whole family loved it, including my kids. The sauce was outstanding! I did what the cook from Aptos, CA did - I de-boned pork loin chops and used the bones in place of the riblets. I would use 6 chops the next time; 4 was not enough. I served it the Baked Apple Compote and Sweet Potato Puree with Brown Sugar and Sherry.

A nice rendition of sauce poivrade without the hassle of making a demi-glace. I de-boned the pork loin chops and used them in place of the riblets. Didn't have currant jelly so I used leftover cranberry sauce flavored with candied ginger. No red wine vinegar left in my pantry so I substituted 1 T. each of balsamic, and white wine vinegar. Even with the improvising the sauce was delicious. Can't wait to make it again according to the recipe. I also seared the pork chops on the stovetop and finished in the oven. They were tender and juicy. Might possibly make the sauce to accompany a pork tenderloin for Christmas.

A new favorite - the sauce has a yummy sweetness & then a kick on the end from the pepper!

The sauce is great! Plus it is very flexible. I've used it with steak by adding a bulb of roasted garlic as the last step.

Sauce was absolutely delicious. Didn't quite know what riblets where so I used pork ribs as substitute. Also, didn't have currant jelly and used apricot and hoisin sauce as sub. The sauce definitely was something I would use again on other dishes. Served with braised red cabbage, apple compote, and whipped parsnips. Parsnips were so sweet (used low fat milk and half and half instead of cream). All that was needed was seasoning - sweet! Oven roasted pork chops after a quick sear on the stove. Delightful way to start the week!
