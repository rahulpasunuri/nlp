I meant legumes, not lentils :)

I liked the combination of mint, orange, feta, and kalamata olives, but I felt the canned garbanzo beans didn't do much for the salad, even though I let them marinate in the homemade balsamic vinaigrette for 30 minutes (which I think is a must to infuse them with any flavor at all.) That said, it was an okay way to get some healthy lentils into our menu. Frankly, I'd leave them out next time.
