6 cloves garlic - remove while browning meat, chop, return to stew. Cook meat with 1/2 T dried oregano, 2 T balsamic, 1 c wine and whole can of tomatoes and a sliced, sauteed onion for 3 hrs, then add 4 peppers for last 1/2 hour or so (until tender). 1 T capers, chopped up.

We have been making this recipe for years. The best stew for a fall season meal, and very easy to make.

Rating: 4
This is one of our favorite meals. We love to serve it to guests when the temperature drops. I usually serve without the egg noodles, but always serve with a hearty bread to mop up the excess at the bottom of the bowl. Without the noodles, this serves 4. I always try to make the day before so the flavors have a chance to blend.

The 4-star rating is for the way I made it, not as written. We had some left over veal roast, so I had to skip the browning part. So our stew wasn't thickened at all and didn't have the brown flavors. I'm sure it would also be delicious starting with raw meat. I started with a mirepoix of about 1/2 cup each of celery, carrots and onions. After cooking that for 10 minutes in olive oil, I added the garlic. After a few more minutes I added peppers. After another few minutes I added the wine and turned the heat up, cooking til the wine was almost completely reduced. Then I added the tomatoes and cooked over high heat for a couple of minutes, added the cooked veal and turned the heat down and partially covered the pot and simmered for about 20 minutes. As for the original recipe: stews really need to start with a mirepoix. The wine works so much better if you add it by itself and reduce to almost nothing, rather than adding the liquids all at the same time. And peppers don't need more than 30 minutes total cooking time. The recipe was great inspiration, but needed some execution adjustments.

I made this wintery dish today before the weather turned too hot. IMO - it was OK, but a little boring. Without capers, extra garlic, onions, and green olives, it would be downright dull. I'd file this recipe under "comfort foods, wintertime".

Rating: 4
I made this today and it is excellent. Veal is readily available and cheaper here in Italy. It is also a lean meat and this can be adapted easily for a lower fat diet. I cut the butter a little and added mushrooms and garlic as others recommended, but pretty much made it as the recipe called for. No, we will not be having noodles or pasta with it but I think it stands well on its own.

This is a fantastic recipe-both easy and very tasty. I have paired it with both mashed potatoes and rice, and both were very good. If I could give it more forks, I would!

Rating: 3
Definitely a keeper. But as my wife says, veal needs lots of stuff. We added mushrooms and carrots and shallots, but kept the cooking time the same. It came out yummy!

Rating: 4
This is a keeper, but oh my, the price of veal: $15/lb. at Whole Foods this afternoon. I'll hold on to this recipe and whip it out when I see packaged veal stew meat in the supermarkets for much cheaper. I read all the reviews so I knew to hold back on the sage, and used only a teaspoon (I halved the recipe). Instead of capers, I threw in a few green olives. My husband doesn't like chunky tomato sauce so I used crushed tomatoes. Served it over leftover primavera. Delicious.

Rating: 2
This was alright, but the sauce is too strong for veal, and subsequently, I felt like I wasted good veal on a stew that is more suited to beef. I should have known that the capers added at the end were going to romp and stomp all over the delicate flavor of the veal. :(

Rating: 4
This was a truly delicious meal and relatively fast for a stew. I used extra wine and tripled the garlic - also listened to the reviews that said to leave the garlic in the pan to cook the meat. Finally, I used fresh sage rather than dried which added far more flavor.

Rating: 4
Up front, I made changes. I had a leftover veal chop that I didn't want to waste. I cut the meat off the bone and made stock with the bone. I halfed the recipe and I followed the suggestion of a previous review and added an onion to the garlic and kept both. Added 2 cups of stock before simmering for 30 min. I also added a chopped carrot and red potato and an additional cup of stock. Simmered for 45 min. Perfect! Served with crusty bread. Made about 4 servings.

Rating: 4
A real keeper!!! I will definately be making this again and again. I added one medium onion chopped and 2 cups of sliced mushrooms. After browning the veal, I sauteed the onions and chopped the garlic, sauteeing them with the onions.

This is one of the best stews I have ever made and I cook and entertain ALOT!Make it exactly as written, except I did return the garlic and added a small onion.Also some fresh thyme.It is worthy of company and keeps beautifully. Bon Appetito!

Rating: 4
Delicious (although mild flavored) stew. Did not discard garlic like others, but did temporarily remove while browning the meat so that garlic didn't burn. Sauteed onions and added to the tomatoes. Like all others meat stews I make, I cook the meat for 2 hours, then add all veggies during the last 1/2 hour (otherwise they're too mushy for our taste). Works every time. This time I added chopped carrots and red potatoes in addition to the red bell pepper (topped off with water - next time I'll use broth). Husband loved this dish. Don't omit the capers!

Rating: 4
An excellent recipe. I added a couple extra garlic cloves and 25% less capers. Definitely a keeper, especially on an evening that is supposed to get down to 7 degrees in Ct.

This is the best veal stew I have ever made! I added the Dijon, Balsamic vinegar, and Worcestershire recommended by another reviewer and cut the broth in half. This would be great for a dinner party.

I made some of the adjustments noted below (added sauteed mushrooms, kept the garlic plus some, and cooked longer than suggested), however, I still found the stew to lack depth of flavor. There are many other stew recipes I would rather make on a Sunday afternoon.

This is an annual party dish for me. I serve it to 30, buffet style with wide egg noodles and a roll. A one plate meal. I have added large green pitted olives when I needed to stretch it. The onion sound interesting.

Easy and delicious! Great comfort food for a winter night! We make this pretty much as written, except I would never discard sauteed garlic.

Outstanding success with this recipe with minor adjustments. Cooked meat and set aside; added peppers and 1 onion and garlic chopped finely and then the remainder of ingredients. Added thyme and cooked for 3 1/2 hours. After 3 hours, added 1 bag of frozen pearl onions. The sauce was perfect and complemented the meal with wild mushroom and asparagas risotto. Would have added cooked mushrooms at the end if not used in the rice. Just made another batch for the freezer. This is perfect dinner party fare.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent dish for cold nights. Easy to make, it is one of the best veal stew dishes I have ever made (and I have tried a lot!) The only change I made was to not discard the garlic -- we are garlic lovers and I think it adds flavor. I used fresh peppers the first time I made it, and used Trader Joe's frozen red, yellow and green pepper package the second time, loved both... This is quality that I would make for our close friend/neighbors who do not expect GOURMET! The taste is there, but most dinner guests probably would not expect a stew....Still, this might surprise them!

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe pretty closely (for me). I'm only cooking for 2, so I used 3/4 lb veal stew meat but kept all the other proportions the same (we like a lot of sauce). I reduced the amount of sage - I only had rubbed sage, which is more potent than leaves, and a whole tablespoon seemed potentially disastrous. I probably used about 2 teaspoons in the end, though, perhaps a bit more, and it didn't overpower, so the 1 T of leaves is probably right. I used a bit less butter than specified. For the peppers I used one red pepper and one big cubanelle, which was great for color/texture/flavor contrast. I also probably used less than 2 T capers - that just seemed like an awful lot - I used about 1.5 tablespoons. Served with noodles. It was delicious! It definitely took longer than an hour and a half to get the veal tender - if I were doing this again I'd probably make sure I had at least three hours to be sure. Next time I'd probably give the capers a rough chop, as there were a lot of them and they cling to the noodles - I don't like getting a whole caper with every bite. I might also add some onions to up the vegetable quotient.

Rating: 3
I thought this was a very nice stew, but I also thought it could use some additional flavor. I added 1/2 a cup of balsamic vinegar, 2 t. of dijon mustard, and 2 T of worsteshire sauce. I like my stews a little bit more soupy so I added 2-3 cups of water as well.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe exactly and used a really nice piece of veal chuck from my butcher. It turned out really good. My husband and I are normally not much of a beef stew fan but we both loved it. The meat was very flavorful and yet juicy tender.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! I added 2 small quartered potatoes, 2 small sliced carrots, 1/4 cup finely sliced celery, and 1/2 cup diced onions when I added the red peppers. After browning the veal, I quickly sauted 1/4 cup diced onions and 3 sliced garlic cloves before adding thw wine and tomatoes. I think the sage gave it just the right flavor.

Rating: 4
This is a keeper. I triple it when making. I season the flour with paprika and cayenne, use diced rather than whole toms, keep in the garlic!, add carrots and add frozen peas at end. Not sure what happens after only 30 minutes cooking, but I simmer for 2-3 hours and it's perfect.

Actual rating: 3.5 You are going to like this one if you dig "savory" food. Peppers cut into diamonds verses strips did a lot better for me. Came together with ease and required minimal effort. Try it.

I would give this 3 and one-half spoons, it is the best veal syew recipe I have evr made, and I have been searching and testing for about 10 years now! It is a wonderful comfort dish, great for a fall or winter meal. It is the only veal stew (homemade) that my husband asked for repeats! Bravo

This is a great recipe for veal and peppers. There is a place in Providence, RI that makes this and I think I almost have it the same. Also, you must shake off any excess flour or it will be to thick as another cook added.

This recipe is fantastic! I have made it several times and my family loves it (even the kids)! The only changes I made were adding chopped garlic after browning the meat to keep in the stew, and using a whole (28 oz.) can of tomatoes. Served it over egg noodles. It is, without a doubt, the BEST STEW recipe I have ever made. I cannot believe some of the other responses were negative. Maybe they did something wrong?

Rating: 1
This was very ordinary. It also didn't look too pretty, which was a shame because I made it to take to a friend. Maybe I didn't braise the meat properly, or dust off enough flour, because it was quite thick and floury in the sauce.

Add baby carrots beore the peppers as they take longer to cook. Added pearl onion and peas as well. Cooked for 3 1/2 to 4 hours till meat was falling apart. Amazing with mashed potatoes.

No red peppers in the fridge so I substituted green bell peppers. I think it made the dish more savory, but it was still very good. Also used high quality veal stew from my local butcher--O'Driscoll's so it was tender after about 1.5 hours of simmering.

I love this recipe, I make it often, with veal and beef stew meat. Its quick, hearty, and definately delicous. I change two things: I add twice the red pepper and omitt the capers (I loath capers) Sometimes I get fancy ;) and throw in other things as well, onions, green pepper, carrots ect. This is a classic easy dish. Definately a keeper!

Rating: 2
something about the sage and capers made this flavor kind of sickening to both my husband and me. We didn't really notice it the first night but when we had it for leftovers the next day neither of us made it through more than 1/4 of our servings. not my favorite stew- we threw the rest out.

Rating: 3
Loved the recipe but recommend doubling the amount of tomatoes and wine, otherwise you are left with about two and a half servings. Delicious stew and very versatile.

Rating: 4
An amazing dish. If you'd like it spicier, add extra pepper while flouring the veal, and also at the end. I also added probably an extra half-tablespoon of sage: that stuff is *strong*, and lovely, lovely. I added half a bag of baby carrots. I'm going to double the recipe next time, maybe add peas--this is a real keeper!!

Wow! The base of this stew is absolutely wonderful. I did not have capers or red peppers, and I had more veal so, I changed it a bit. 1, baked veal bones at 400 for 30 minutes, then boiled them in some beef broth until the wet stuff went into the stew. 2, added a little paprika to the flour. 3, added a small bag of mini carrots, and a can of peas with the water the came in. Such a tasty stew! I can't wait to try it with the red peppera and capers. This one is saved in my recipe box!

It is 5 degrees out!! Time for stew! Did not have capers in the house, but did have mushrooms and carrots,which I added the last 30 minutes of cooking. Added more garlic and left it in the stew.We love garlic.Also used 28 oz of canned tomatoes. Easy and quick to make. Used Veal shoulder (it was in the freezer)Very tender after 1 1/2 hour simmer. Served over brown rice with steamed brocoli, green salad with goat cheese and spiced pecans and a crusty whole wheat baguette.

A very tasty stew with tender meat, due I think, to the long cooking time. Veal can be tough, I agree. The sauce would have been way, way too thick if I hadn't added a generous amount of very rich homemade chicken stock as the cooking progressed. In addition to the peppers (red, green and orange in this case), I added three small chopped carrots. The two of us have enough frozen for another meal. I did use less veal, about 1 1/2 pounds, which I cut up from a shoulder steak and veal riblets. I cooked the bones with the stew for added flavor. Like others, I added a dash of hot red pepper sauce, also some paprika when flouring the veal.

I served this at a dinner for 8, doubling the recipe. No one being a being a big eater, there were only enough leftovers for 2. The recipe as written is not enough for 6 unless they are REALLY light eaters. I made the recipe as written and it is VERY good. It does need lots of salt and pepper or in general, more flavor. I thickend the sauce with flour and served it over egg noddles which was perfect for the dish. I made Baby Greens, Pear, Walnut, and Blue Cheese Salad (BA 9/2002) and offered a baguette. Great make-ahead recipe (I made the stew a day ahead) for informal entertaining. It is not cheap however, the veal stew meat was $9.99/pound.

Made this exactly according to recipe and after simmering for a while, tasted it. Added a little more sage, a few splashes of Louisiana hot sauce, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. It was absolutely delicious, served with garlic mashed potatoes. Next time I would add a few lightly sauteed pearl onions for about the last half hour of cooking.

Delicious, and easy. I found tiny sweet red and yellow peppers at the farmers market, and they were just right. Also added meaty veal neck bones as well as stew meat. For eight people, I had 2 1/2 pounds of meat, plus the neck bones -- and it wasn't quite enough; next time try more. I added chicken broth to make more sauce, and probably added too much. Next time, I would add just one 14-oz. can, instead of two.

I make this every other year for my Christmas Open House - always to rave reviews. One year I added large green olives. This year I added pearl onions. Made days in advance, served from a chafing dish with noodles, one plate - couldn't be simpler. The other years it's Chiken Marbella

My partner thought this was the best dish I ever made; I was somewhat less enthused. Still, it's very good. I didn't change anything. The raters who found this recipe fast and easy must have bought pre-cut veal stew meat; I bought some expensive cuts (shanks cut for osso bucco) first, and spent a lot of time trimming them, and later found stew meat for about half the price. The stew meat was cut in pretty irregular pieces, some way too small, but all in all I'll take the time savings any day. The meat turned out nice and tender.

I'm not too fond of peppers, so I took them out and used peas (add close to end of cooking) and omited the capers. Delicious! peas gave it a slight sweetness, and I've served it over both mashed potatoes (great on really cold days) and rice. It's now a regular winter dish.

Excellent dish. Veal turned out very tender and tasty. I used an entire can of italian style diced tomatoes (28 oz) instead of what the recipe called for and would recommend that everyone tries this. Contrary to what one would think, the tomatoes do not dominate the dish and it gives you lots of sauce for those egg noodles.

Very delicious. I tried something alittle different - I made couscous and served the stew over the couscous - very very good! Nice hearty and flavorful meal - the tomatoes and sweet red peppers blend so well together. I would not change a thing on this recipe. Try the couscous instead of the egg noodles, the couscous will soak up the stew very nicely :)

This is a great make ahead dish to serve family style to friends--I served mine over homemade noodles that I first tossed with a little butter and minced parsley. About the recipe: The veal definitely needs to cook the full time to become tender. I also thought it needed a little kick from a bit of cayenne pepper and a dash of hot sauce. I also added mushrooms and found that the flavors mellow and gather more complexity day two--rave reviews from friends for this one.

Fabulous recipe. I cut the veal into small pieces(about 3/4") to make them brown faster, and it makes them more tender. I also added a whole 28 oz. can of tomatoes and added some water. Did not use the capers. The water will boil down and thicken. This is a great one-meal dish over noodles with warm Italian bread and wine. Even better the next day.

I was very pleased with the flavor of this dish. It was delicious! The only disappointing thing was the veal was "tough". I even got it from my butcher shop. When eating this dish, I would recommend cutting the veal cubes into very small pieces. I'm not sure if it was the meat I used or if this is the nature of veal cubes?

We loved this recipe, even more so the next day. I had purchased a large veal roast to make the veal tenderloin w/ goat cheese, basil and yellow pepper (on this website). We were not impressed, even though we made it exactly as stated. Way too rich, and just didn't taste that good. Used the leftover veal tenderloin for this recipe and thought it was fab!!! Definitely plan to eat it the next day. Use good quality canned tomatoes.
