These were pretty good, but a little rich (but it's made of only parmesan cheese, so I should have expected rich). The cheese took about 10 minutes to brown, instead of the suggested 3-4 minutes. They were also pretty greasy, and I ended up blotting both sides with paper towels. With those adjustments, they will make a pretty hors d'oeuvre at my friend's wedding party.
