This recipe is AMAZING. I've made it several times and everyone who tries it loves it. Because the recipe results in such a huge quantity, I started a Christmas tradition a few years ago - I make the full recipe on the stovetop, and then divide up the recipe into several ceramic crocks that I refrigerate or freeze. Then I pull one out and bake it in the oven to take to each of the 5 or 6 holiday events I attend. I keep rosemary in the refrigerator so I can top it with a fresh spring. People love it.

My family LOVES! this recipe. I don't make it often, but when I do my husband is happy to eat any leftovers for however long they last. I half the recipe {all but the dried mushrooms} and I often sub shitaki mushrooms for the porcini mushrooms, but either way its a hit!

This is the exact same recipe from the "Easy Pasta Party" menu from 1989. Except the original recipe was not this large. It's great. I've never used the dried porcini mushrooms. So glad to see this recipe again!

This is a wonderfuly delicious pasta dish! Its spicy and creamy and just simply very GOOD! Makes a very large amount which works well for a crowd or holiday gathering. Time intensive...yes...worth the time? OH YES!!

Served at a Tuscan-themed wine tasting last night to rave reviews! I found that it was simple to make, other than concern over the liquid volume. Only used 2 cups of cream instead of half and half, and had to simmer down for more like an hour, not 20 minutes. Will definitely make this again!

The flavor is fantastic and received rave reviews from our guests. True, this recipe does make an insane amount of pasta. I served it as a side to 16 guests and only went through half. Great for a party and way more interesting than serving lasagna.

Really? Come on. If you're going to post a recipe that feeds 20, offer another version that feeds 1, 2, 4, perhaps? Or better yet, put in a menu calculator that will proportionately up or reduce ingredient amounts to suit the reader's plans.

GROSS. My husband loves mushrooms, so I tried this recipe. I now know that I will never use Porcini Mushrooms in anything! Most of this went in the disposal. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. I can't even begin to think of any ingredient substitute that might make this worth eating.

This recipe is really amazing. I made it the other night- although a lot of prep work- the results are OUTSTANDING. My boyfriend told me it was the best thing he had ever eaten- and I definitley agree. I saw some comments earlier about not having enough liquid (or at least for the ones that halved the recipe)- make sure you get the dried porcini mushrooms- do not skip this ingredient- it ties the whole dish together. The broth from the mushrooms makes it a perfect amount of liquid- I had plenty left for 3 days of leftovers. One substition I made was using basil, tomatoe, garlic chicken sausage- and it tasted perfect. Enjoy!

I have given this recipe out numerous times. I did not change a thing as I find it flavorful just as is. Maybe I put a few extra red pepper flakes in it but it is superb with garlic bread and a nice bottle of merlot.

I altered the recipe a little: Added dairy after baking (I can't have dairy). Only made 1/4 of the recipe. Used turkey sausage and chicken stock. I used pre-sliced white mushrooms (made it easier to prepare). Also, I used a shallot and garlic instead of an onion. For the wine, I used a high quality sherry. It was good without the dairy but those that had it with cream and cheese loved it. I would maybe add some roasted tomatoes instead of cream and serve parm on the side, next time.

I first made this recipe for a large gathering, and it was a big hit. It has since become a family favorite. I do make some substitutions, I use sweet Italian bulk sausage, thyme over rosemary (which I dislike), Baby Bella mushrooms and reduce the amount of liquid. When making for a weeknight family dinner, I also do not use the dried mushrooms.

I was very pleased with this dish and got rave reviews from many folks. The only changes that I made were using baby bella mushrooms over button and fresh thyme rather than rosemary (personal preference.) Excellent, I will definitely make again!

My guests liked this very much. It was a lot of work but that is true whenever one makes such a large quantity.

I made this dish last night for a dinner party and it was fantastic, I halved the recipe for 12 people. I made it just as the recipe called for. It got rave reviews. However it did soak up a lot of the sauce while baking, next time I won't bake it. I will make the pasta and reheat the sauce, toss with parmesan and then top with more parmesan and put under the broiler for a minute or so. This dish is very rich and the combination of the spicy sausage and all the mushrooms is wonderful. I served it with the Tomato herb bread and a simple green salad with green onion, cherry tomatoes, avocado and tossed with balsalmic dressing and topped with toasted pinenuts. Definitely will make again, already had two people call for the recipe.

I chose this because I wanted to a prepare my main course well before my party so I could relax with my guests..... with the help of my husband, I was up until 1am with the preparations and then, it took up all my oven space to warm it up for dinner. BEWARE... this dish takes FOREVER. It is good, but I think there are other cheaper (this isn't) and easier recipes that would be just as welcomed. I won't make this again.

Delicious! Creamy, spicy, with the earthiness of the porcini mushrooms...it got raves at the Christmas buffet we had this past December. I halved the recipe and omitted the rosemary (simply because I didn't have any). I also used regular mushrooms, sliced, because I could only find canned buttons which I thought wouldn't work as well. I will definitely make it again for my own family.

I've made this recipe on two different occasions and both times it was a hit with my guests. While both expensive and time consuming it's worth it!!

I made this recipe and got great reviews. However next time I will double up on the broth and half & half & wine. It had great flavor and was easily quartered.

I made this for company - both adults and children alike all asked for seconds and thirds. My husband who is a devote tomato sauce lover - told me how incredible this dish was and he cant wait to have it again - good thing because I made the full recipe and now have dinner ready for tonight. I just cant bring myself to freeze it for later. Yum Yum

Pretty good, added crushed tomatoes, used 50% chicken sausage. Family went back for seconds and finished the pan, they wanted 3rds but will have to wait to next time.

porcini and their juices make this dish. Nice taste- my 8 year old even ate it and asked me to make it again! Added some canned chopped tomatoes and broiled mozzarella on top of dish- although it doesn't need these additions to "make" the dish.

I've made this recipe twice, the second time I doubled the wine, broth and half-and-half; and added some crushed red pepper. With these alterations, it came out very creamy, tender, and worth making again.

Love this although have to quarter the recipe and it's still more than enough.

A truly boring recipe. It all tasted the same, no outstanding flavors.

Just okay....... nothing special. I agree that the portion of sauce to pasta was too little. Too dry for leftovers.

Nothing special...as others have noted, too little sauce for the amount of pasta.

LIke others, I made a quarter of the recipe and agree with another cook here that there isn't enough sauce to cover 1lb of tubular pasta, especially for next-day leftovers. It is all taken in and completely dry. So I cooked down the remaining broth and some half and half and poured it over the leftover; mixed and rebaked. But I did like the flavors and may play with the proportions (2x the sauce) if I make it again.

Warning: This recipe needs a whole lot more half-and-half than it lets on! I made it for a smaller gathering two days before Christmas, so I divided the recipe by four, and therefore should have needed one cup of half-and-half. It turned out that it needed a quart, and even that was just to make it reasonably moist. (I wasn't going for the swimming in sauce effect by any means.) I happened to have enough half-and-half on hand to save the dinner, but the episode really threw off all my planning for subsequent meals, for which the rest of the half-and-half had been earmarked. I had to send my spouse to the store on Christmas Eve to fight the mad crowds to get more. He is finally speaking to me again.

This was just ok. I have made many other baked pasta and sausage dishes which had a lot more flavor. However, we "ate the whole thing".

a great dish for entertaining a great number of people! used shiitake instead of porcini and loved the taste. quartered the recipe for just the family and it was perfect.

I made 1/4 of this recipe. Overall, pretty good, but a bit time consuming. I had to sub dried portabello mushrooms for the porcini, but otherwise made as written.

This is a wonderful party dish. The previous review is correct about the color. The photo is not accurately depicting that this is a brown colored dish. Nonetheless, my guests wanted the recipe before leaving.

Please notice that, while the dish in the photo appears to have a red sauce, there are no tomatoes in this recipe. The color of the actual finished product is brown.

This was fabulous! It easily cuts down into quarters and goes great with the fennel, orange and radicchio salad on the menu.
