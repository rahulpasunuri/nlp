While I love the idea of the mini mac and cheese as a portioned side dish, that is the only thing good about this recipe. The sauce did not stay together - it was smooth, but separated when I tried to pour into ramekins - and the brandy gives it a funny taste. Next time I'll stick with my usual mac and cheese, and just bake in ramekins.

Love love love this recipe! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of baking in ramekins (I don't have good ramekins so I just used a baking dish). Don't skip the arugula, it pulls it all together.

I thought this was a tasty version of mac n cheese. It is NOT super creamy like more traditional versions, but I liked that. I used a combination of jack and sharp cheddar instead of the swiss that is called for and it turned out well. It was easy to double the recipe as well.

This was quite a disappointment. There was no creaminess, and it was lacking in flavor. I even added some extra spices to the top, and that didn't save it. Maybe my cheeses weren't very good picks, but my grocer didn't have many options in the lowfat category. Overall, I'll stick to regular mac'n cheese recipes, and just eat a smaller portion.

While the flavors improved considerably the next day (the leftovers tasted better than the servings out of the oven), my family hated this dish, primarily because of the brandy. I couldn't get anyone to finish their servings, which is why I had leftovers -- and I ate the leftovers not because they were delicious but because it pains me to throw stuff away. But the next day, the brandy taste diminished a fair amount. Maybe cutting the brandy back to a tablespoon or less would help. Not sure that it's worth the trouble to mess around with this recipe...I'm sure there are other "healthy" versions of mac and cheese around and readers should probably start with one of those.

This was a really good recipe. Since I'm cooking just for myself, I'm always looking for recipes that are easy to make for a small number of people. I really like macaroni and cheese, and I thought this was a pretty good recipe. The combination of the nutmeg, brandy, and cheeses made for a really good flavor. I would definitely make this again.
