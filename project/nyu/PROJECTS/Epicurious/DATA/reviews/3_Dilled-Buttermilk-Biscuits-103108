I didn't use as much butter or shortening and added more milk. I loved the dill taste but they came out a bit dry. Also the dough was very sticky. Next time I won't stray from the recipe so much.

Good stuff. FYI "cook from new york" - never use salted butter in cooking or baking.

These biscuits turned out light and fluffy with a beautiful golden color. There was quite a bit of fat in them but they didn't taste fatty or greasy. I doubled the recipe and used plenty of fresh dill and they were gone in a matter of minutes. The only thing I noticed was that the biscuits needed a bit more salt. Maybe I should have used salted butter. The guests disagreed about needing more salt so maybe it was just my taste buds wanting more salt! I plan on making these again...so easy!

I would make these biscuits again, but I want to further reduce the fat. I left out the shortening and used 1 cup of low-fat buttermilk. I may try a bit less butter next time as well. The dill makes a great taste that they were a great addition to my turkey potpies.

I've made this three times now(Only when I'm fine and thin) and they have always turned out perfect,all puffed up and no doughy taste.I've served it the three times for guests and they have all asked for the recipe.

I'm not sure how this recipe got past the test kitchens. I was surprised, looking at the recipe, at how much fat was used: about twice as much as in normal biscuit recipes. I made a test batch (luckily, before 14 people showed up for brunch) and sure enough, the dough wasn't wet enough and the biscuits tasted like shortening and left a fatty coating in my mouth. In future batches I eliminated all of the shortening, added an extra 1/3 cup of liquid, and ended up with marvelous biscuits.
