I had almost forgotten about this recipe but am making it again tonight after too long without! Like some other reviewers here, I prefer dark meat so we use drumsticks and/or thighs. After the chicken marinates, I brown it so it takes on a nice color then bake it skin side up. We love the tangy sauce and have this dish with couscous. Can't wait to eat this tonight!

Really not very exciting (or good)... just ended up with salty, soy-flavored chicken.

This was really easy, and there was enough sauce to go over some rice.

I have been cooking this dish since it first appeared in Bon Appetit. The fact that my kids really like it and the ease of preparation are definite pluses. I admit it is a bit on the sour side. You have to really like the taste of soy sauce and lemon (which we do!). I'm making it tonight and intend to use one of the reviewer's advice to use boneless, skinless breasts.

2nd time making and I answered my question. It seems like a lot of liquid, but I baked it with all the liquid, also added a little honey and fresh ground black pepper. Much more tender juicy, got good review from someone I was trying to impress.

This was truly awful. Sour chicken. Yum. I attempted to salvage by adding brown sugar to the marinade to use as a sauce which helped. Also the cooking time is too long...the chicken was dry. And SOUR!

This has been a staple in our house for years. We use dark meat (our preference) and cook a little bit longer. Serve on couscous to take advantage of all the delicious sauce! Great with steamed broccoli on the side.

Very easy, and my kids like it. That makes it a winner.

One suggestion if you use boneless chicken parts: bake what would have been the skin side down for the covered 35 minutes (it infuses the chicken with more flavor) and then flip the pieces over, dribble the oil, and bake uncovered for the final 15 minutes to brown.

Orange juice is a terrific substitution.

This was very good, and best of all......sooooo easy! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, and ran out to my garden and got some green onions. I made Fried rice with bacon, scallions and water chestnuts to go with it. Delicious!

I first tried this because of how easy it was to prepare. I varied the dish a bit by leaving out the green onions (I forgot to buy them) and by seasoning the chicken with lemon pepper. I also used dark meat. Serve this on an oval platter with all of the sauce and the sesame seeds garnishing the plate and chicken. DON'T leave out the seeds. This chicken really picks up on the flavor of the soy and the lemon and it is not too salty at all. I recommend Uncle Bens oriental rice to accompany this dish.
