this is very good. i have been making it since magazine came out - 10 years! its hot in LA today and this will go so nicely with a sauvignon blanc and a spinach salad. i always have cilantro in my fridge. tip: to keep cilantro very fresh for almost, if not, a whole week - slice off ends and stick it in an inch of water in a glass and put in the refridgerator - you won't be throwing it out after 2 days anymore.

Let's fact it, folks, this recipe is all about the garlic ... my preference is to slice the cloves paper-thin ... a little more fuss is worth the effort. Cilantro is an interesting choice of herb, parsley or basil would be more traditional.

Tried this recipe as is but doubled, as there are five in my family. Thought it was okay. Reheated the leftovers with a spoonful of Patak's mild curry paste...and, oh my gosh! I suggest you make it (omitting some of the oil, if you must)and add 1-2 (for single recipe) heaping teaspoonfuls of the mild curry paste, then stand back (or serve yourself first, then stand back)!

Simple and flavorful, the way weeknight cooking should be!

I have been making this wonderful dish now for months. Don't use garlic press - mince the garlic and use at least three cloves - the flavor is much richer and the garlic won't burn too quickly. I usually add about 1/4 cup of liquid to make a creamier sauce no matter what. Trader Joe's has a nice dried spinach & chive linguine or fresh store-type refrigerated spinach fettuchine works just as well. Fresh cilantro is a must and lots of it! Yum! I make this as part of a vegetarian meal I call my Green Meal with steamed asparagus spears tossed with 2 tsp. olive oil, 1 clove garlic, pressed, 1 tsp. balsamic vinegar, salt & 1 tsp. dired tarragon and a green salad. It's a little wierd but you'll be loved for making it.

i think that it was a very strange taste and very simple nothing special .

Good but very oily -- next time I'll reduce the oil by a third.

Very simple, but different. I substituted rotelle pasta and added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, for a bit a color and bite. Very Good!

It was easy to fix and tasted great. Seemed like a lot of garlic but it tasted wonderful. I used lemon pepper fettucini, wonderful added flavor.
