This was one of the best ways I've found of using up some of that leftover dark meat turkey. That said, we can never have it again - with all those eggs, a whole stick of butter, AND cheese... Yikes! Utterly delicious though. I think if I do make it again (which as sinful as it is, I might anyway), I would add some carrots and celery to the turkey mixture just to get a few more veggies in it.

After you have had your fill of turkey sandwiches with lettuce and mayo - always sublime - this is a perfect recipe to use up all the remaining bits without being obvious "leftovers". It is excellent as written but lends itself to tweaks too - I have tripled the mushrooms, added a splash of white wine and reduced it, used turkey gravy because I still had it instead of broth, added garlic/a minced chilie. The beautiful golden puff is cheesy and eggy and complements the turkey so well. A keeper.

This is excellent, and very versatile. I've even substituted beef and beef stock.

I love this recipe! It is my husband's favorite! I typically make 1 1/2 times the recipe if I want to feed 4 people (using a slightly larger casserole dish). I also add more parsley, more mushrooms & have added zucchini to the mix, which was TASTY! Yum, Yum! I have not served to a single person that was disappointed. I am not such a skilled cook, but this really is not difficult (a mixer does help with the pastry, if you are doubling the recipe). Can't get enough of this one!

Now a staple at my house. I follow the recipe to a T, or substitute chicken, or use a heartier mushroom, beef broth, and beef or lamb and skip the tomato. This recipe is so simple to make, a great weeknight dinner!

This is one of my all time favorite Gourmet Mag recipes - I use it a lot for small suppers and just vary the filling with whatever leftovers I've got - a simple and inexpensive way to impress the guests When tomatoes aren't in season, a canned plum tomato works much better and has lot more flavor and better texture.

The filling was very good (followed the recipe except added a few extra mushrooms). The crust was a bit too cheesy (I was expecting almost a puff pastry crust from the description); it tasted a bit like a cheesy quiche. The overall result is more like a tart/quiche (that's why the tomatoes are appropriate). Not bad, but not what I was looking for...

To the cook who doesn't like mushrooms and is looking for a substitute, I would try 1/4 to 1/2 cup of diced, skinned eggplant following the instructions for the mushrooms. Texture will be softer, but eggplant and turkey go well together.

Followed the recipe as written, including the tomato (although I used canned diced rather than fresh), and it turned out perfectly! Always looking for ways to use turkey leftovers, but I think this would also be good throughout the year with chicken as well.

My husband loved this dish. I did make a couple substitutions - I didn't have mushrooms but added celery instead. And my husband is lactose-intolerant so I used goat gouda instead of swiss. I had never made a dough like that before, so I wasn't sure if it would turn out correctly, but it was very tasty and golden brown. Great for those small bits of turkey leftover from Thanksgiving.

This recipe looks delicious but am wondering what I might add instead of the mushroom since I don't like them. Any thoughts on a good filling subsitute?

I loved how easy and flavorful the puff pastry was. Took the advice of other reviewers and left out the tomato (which seemed out of place with other ingredients) and added extra mushrooms. What a wonderful way to use left over turkey.

This dish is great hit!! I actually left out the tomato and added six mushrooms instead of two.

Delicious! I made as specified except for adding a few more mushrooms and a little more swiss. I boiled turkey drumsticks for the turkey and used the extra meat in turkey salad and soup - no need to wait for leftovers! I will absolutely make this again! It was a big hit!

That was a wonderful use for leftover turkey. I agree with the previous reviewer to add more mushrooms. I also added celery and carrot - which I would not add again. I thought this was going to be like a turkey pot pie and it wasn't. I also left out the tomato and would not add that either next time. The swiss cheese pairs wonderfully with the turkey and mushrooms. The crust puffed up great and the center of the crust was rich and eggy. Delicious.

An excellent, easy (time consuming but not stressful) recipe for leftover meat (I'd try again with chicken or lamb). I didn't have parsley or tomato and it was still incredibly delicious. It probably doesn't need all that butter in the filling, and I might even substitute olive oil. Oh, and use more than 2 mushrooms, because mushrooms are tasty. Mmmmm, mushrooms.
