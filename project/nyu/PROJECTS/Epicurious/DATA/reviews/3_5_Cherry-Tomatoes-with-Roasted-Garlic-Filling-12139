Receipe is fine. Extra garlic doesn't hurt. Don't stress with the cherry tomatoes. Use the next size larger such as Ambrosia or Campari; slice in half and continue with recipe. Much easier to handle. Also, I slice English cukes about 2" thick, core and stuff with dressing.

Have made these many times, always to rave reviews and a quickly cleared platter. Easy, but time consuming. Even using a pastry bag it takes a while, but that may be because I use the tiniest of tomatoes, but the result is absolutely delicious and well worth it.

My daughter(6 years old), and husband who are not big fans of garlic, (but were willing enough to try this) really like this recipe. I thought it was delicious, and easy. For a party, double or triple this, it will go fast.

This filling is SO GOOD! Forget the tomatoes, I just make it as a spread. I make this all the time.

Made this as a dip as previous reviewers suggested. I found it very bland. Most of it was left at the end of the party.

I made this recipe as written but instead of stuffing tomatoes, I served as a layered dip. Garlic mixture on the bottom. Chopped tomatoes and basil on top with bagel chips. It was a big hit!! I overheard several guests raving about it without knowing I made it. That was nice.

I made the filling and spread it on bagel chips and put half a grape tomato on top and my friends loved it. They were gone so quickly!

This recipe, as is, is DEFINITELY not worth the effort. I made this as other reviewers recommended, as a simple spread, and served on top of crackers with a slice of tomato on top. A HUGE hit. You get the complete intent of this recipe with half the effort. A wonderful spread.

Not bad, but must add more garlic for real taste. Everyone who tried it (including non-garlic lovers) agreed that it was a bit bland. Will make it again for a party this weekend and will double the garlic. Also, could not find cherry tomatoes, so used grape tomatoes which really added to the work as they are so small. This works really well as a dip.

I make these as part of a relish dish every Christmas, and my family loves them. Yes, the proportion of cherry tomatoes to stuffing is off; however, I use a regular tomato to use up the excess filling. This larger tomato is the centerpiece for the relish dish. The larger tomato becomes a serving dish of sorts. My guests use a spreader to scoop out the filling onto crackers. Recently, I made these as a dish for a Tapas party for members of our local Chamber of Commerce. They were a HUGE hit. They really team up well with some of the other (more traditional) Tapas dishes.

The filling is very yummy, but the overall dish is not worth the effort. In the future, I will spread the filling on bread rounds and top with either a tomato slice or a little scoop of chopped tomatoes and basil.

WOW! I made these for a cocktail party & they were gone in what seemed like seconds! The result is well worth the time & effort required to make these little bites. The filling is delicious & can easily be doubled for later use.

Devine! BUT - I omitted putting the filling in the tomatoes and instead served the filling, diced tomatoes and chopped fresh basil all separate with large crackers for everyone to spread, top and sprinkle their own! Hard to stop eating!

Great concept, great filling, but salting the insides of the tomatoes is a no no. Would make it again in a heartbeat without that part though.

I found doing the whole tomato thing a bit tedious, and the ratio of tomato to filling off (too much filling per tomato). I did love the filling though and thought it was a great taste with the tomato. So next time, I think I'll spread filling on crackers and top with diced tomatoes (that's sort of how I ended up eating them, I put a tomato upside down on a cracker and squashed it flat).

I have made these several times and they are always a big hit. They're always gone long before the tomatoes have time to get soggy!!

You've got to taste the garlice/cream cheese filling before stuffing. The garlic flavor was very strong and I would have cut it with more cream cheese.

I'm a big garlic fan but I thought these were overpowering. The only change I made to the recipe was that I used prepared roasted garlic vs. roasting the garlic myself. Maybe that made the difference. Even so, I don't think I'll be brave enough to try these again.

Outstanding. I keep getting asked for the recipe every time I make it. I also stuffed snow peas with the same filling and it was great.

I thought these tomatoes were quite bland. I ended up having to triple the amount of lemon juice suggested to give it some flavor.

The first time I made this recipe I followed the directions and my guests liked it. The second time I made it I used both green and black olives instead of the tomatoes and my guests loved it. I also found it much easier to make the garlic puree with the husk ON.

To avoid the potentially soggy tomatoes, I prepared the filling,piped it into mini-phyllo cups (in your grocer's freezer) and topped it with a mixture of minced tomato, fresh basil and garlic. My guests were so impressed. They didn't last long!

Very delicious and easy to prepare.

The tomatoes needed to dry for over an hour, even with the salt, but these were a hit and the first things to go on a large buffet.

Very delicious morsels. Just bite size and they look beautiful on the platter. A big success, very tasty. I prepared the tomatoes the day before and drained them on paper towels in refrigerator overnight. No watery residue.

Excellent recipe - a big hit at cookouts this summer. I use a 1/4 teaspoon to scoop out the tomatoes while I watch TV or listen to music - far less tedious that way.

The filling in the tomatoes is excellent, the tomatoes did get watery even though I did drain them. I had leftover cheese and used it on crackers and it was a hit.

This was a good recipe, although the tomatoes with the cut bottoms got a little watery on the platter. However, I had leftover cheese and used that on crackers the next night - yum! Now I make the cheese and pipette it into prepared phyllo cups and top with a small cube of tomatoe -a smash!

These little babies are really quite good. They look beautiful and taste terrific. The recipe seems involved -- scooping out all the tomatoes -- but it actually goes quite fast.
