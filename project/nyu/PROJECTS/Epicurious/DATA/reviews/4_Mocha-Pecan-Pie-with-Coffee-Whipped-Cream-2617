I made this recipe in 1994 and each year since. If I don't offer to make it for a family holiday, some one asks why. All my substantive comments have been made by others already. It's just an oustanding desert.

The filling is great, but I always ruin every pie crust that I have tried to make. I used 2 commercial crusts. Recipie fills two 8" pie crusts

I'm from Australia and we don't have vegetable shortening(or at least we don't call it that anyway), what would be our equivalent?

I really enjoyed the unique flavor of this pie. The orange in the crust puts a different spin on the traditional pecan pie. It reminds me of fig newtons.

This is a fabulous pie! I've made it several times and always get RAVES for guests. Crust is difficult to roll out but worth the extra effort!

Very good. I did change the whipped cream by using 1 T instant espresso powder instead of the liqueur. It really did balance out the sweetness of the pie!

I made this pie and the Lime Mousse Cake for my son's christening party. The Mousse cake is always a huge hit. The pecan pie was a wallflower...guests ate about 1/4 of the pie. This dish could be too sweet for most people. The crust came out quite dry and crumbled apart each time a piece was cut. I would recommend covering the crust edge with foil while baking the filling. The whipped cream was very tasty!

Delicious. Next time I'll increase the cocoa as it was barely detectable. Also the crust will shrink in baking, so be sure edges extend above rim of pie plate to start. The orange was a great flavor note.

Haven't made the recipe, but I'm due to have a baby within a week or two and thought this would be a wonderful pie to bake and freeze now for Thanksgiving. Does anyone have good freezing tips? Should I let the pie rest before freezing, etc.

Got rave reviews, but had to make it twice: the first time it burnt to a crisp. Changes for the second time were: I did NOT prebake the crust, and also, I covered the entire pie lightly with foil throughout the baking process except for the last 10 minutes. In this way it was all perfectly crisped and browned. Also, I cut back by a third on the coffee--I thought it was too strong with the full amount. Finally, I know crusts are a pain, but really, this one is essential to the taste of the pie (I recommend adding even more orange zest--the crust was really a crowd pleaser). The cream is also a great compliment, but premade coffee ice cream would probably also do nicely.

I made this pie for a pie baking contest at my work and won the grand prize. Everyone raved about it, especially the coffee whipped cream. It was also the first pie I ever baked from scratch. It's a great twist on pecan pie. I've made it every thanksgiving since and my friends love it. Everyone should try this recipe!

Made this for Christmas. Yummm. I thought the whipped cream could have been slightly sweeter; but when combined with the generously "sweet" pie, it was a perfect combo!

Best ever -- not insipidly gooey like many pecan pies.

This was very tasty, but I think I like plain old pecan pie better. The flavor of the pecans was a little lost with the chocolate.

Delicious! This was my first pecan pie AND my first crust ever to make and it was easier than I thought. Making the crust is a MUST - the orange zest really compliments the pie. I took others suggestions and did not pre-bake the crust and it browned up just fine with the filling. I will definately be making this one again - it was perfect! Oh, and the Kahlua whipped cream is not to be forgotten! Enjoy!

I used a chocolate crust instead of the crust in the recipe and really recommend it. I couldn't really taste the coffee at all in the filling which was fine with me (not being a coffee fan, myself) but coffee lovers might want to add more instant coffee. Still a great recipe that my whole family loved. I really agree with the previous cook's idea of not pre-baking the crust. The fist time I made the recipe the crust didn't work at all.

I've made this pie a couple times, and each time it was a hit. Personally, I thought it was a bit rich, and I pass on the coffee whipped cream, opting for plain. I also had trouble with the crust the first time, and now I don't pre-bake it before I pour the filling in. I suppose it depends on your pie plate.

We have been making this pie since the 1994 issue came out. It is now a family favorite and extended family members request this pecan pie. I have to admit I do use store bought crust but you can't skip the coffee flavored cream. This one is in my permanent recipe box.

Read all the wonderful reviews and was so excited to make this pie! However, I followed the directions to end up with a slightly burnt crust(even though i covered the edges) and a smoky flavor in the top pecans. Perhaps next time, i will not bake the crust ahead of time!

I made for a Gumbo dinner party - this made for an excellent variation of the Louisiana traditional pecan pie dessert and was gone in an instant. I didn't make the coffee whipped cream but instead chose to make just plain whipped cream. Minor baking adjustments I had to make: bake for about 1 hr 10 min in order for it to set up properly and cover the top with foil after about 50 min. to avoid burning.

It is now a traditional holiday favorite in our family. This pie is requested more often than pumpkin or apple.

Exquisite! I host a pie party every holiday season and this is always a hit. Tips for other bakers...I NEVER make the crust. The orange doesn't add a lot, and the ready made crusts from the store work just as well (in fact, I'm always complimented in *my* crust). The coffee whipped cream makes the pie -- just use sparingly!

I made this into 11 cupcakes in filo shells, baked at 350 for 30 min. Next time i would skip the coffee whipped cream--it is over-the-top good but too much for this wonderful pie that should stand alone. (you can't taste the pie for the topping.)

This dish was very good. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. The filling was the best part, and the crust with the hint of orange was a nice touch. I had a little trouble with the crust. It over baked and I had a hard time trying to serve it. I would not prebake the crust before putting in the filling. Otherwise this pie was awesome.

I have made this outstanding pie for Thanksgiving for several years now; it has become a family tradition. I usually make 50% more crust because I'm still not great at rolling out the dough, and I have learned not to bake the pie in a stoneware pie pan because it soaks up the butter and dries out the crust, but you won't find a better pecan pie recipe than this. Almost as easy as a standard pecan pie but made better with orange rind in the crust, espresso in the filling, and Kahlua whipping cream on top.

This recipe made the first Thanksgiving Dinner we hosted.

Wonderfully different twist on traditional pecan pie. I loved the flavor of both filling and crust, but the pie needed longer to bake than the proscribed hour, and the crust..... Well, the crust was a royal pain in the ass. I'm one of those who consider making piecrust from scratch one of the biggest wastes of time on the planet but figured I'd try this one as it was easy and seemed necessary to the flavor of the pie. Well, after following the recipe exactly, I ended up with a very skimpy, very difficult to handle crust that had way too much butter/fat in it and not enough density to properly support the filling. Good thing it tasted as good as it did. I think in future I will revert to my frozen piecrusts, add some orange zest and perhaps a few drops of orange extract/liquer to the filling and call it good. I didn't make the whipped cream but will try it next time.

This was a great dessert. I substituted walnuts for pecans and halved the espresso powder (to balance the natural slight bitterness of the nuts). Also blended 1 teaspon non-dairy flavored coffee creamer and frozen dessert topping instead of making coffee whipped cream. Fabulous!

I had the same problem as the reviewer from Santa Fe regarding the crust sticking. I think it's because this filling doesn't include as much butter as my traditional recipe does, consequently it's less slippery and can stick if it seeps through. I enjoyed this pie very much, but I guess I'm a traditionalist who prefers the regular version. I don't like things to be too rich and the chocolate was a bit too much for me. On the other hand, my husband is a choco-holic who loved it.

Yum!!! The coffee and unsweetened chocolate balance the sweetness of the filling. I agree that the November 1994 issue of Bon Appetit was an excellent one. I have probably made more dishes from that one issue than any other.

I made a practice run of this pie this week before Thanksgiving, and I will definitely be making it again! It's easy to make and comes out delicious. The only difficulty I had was separating the dough from the plastic when transferring it to the pie pan, as it's very sticky. I recommend a good dusting of flour on the plastic. The mocha pie comes out similar enough to be considered traditional pecan pie, but with just that extra something to make it special :-)

I thought this pie was good but perhaps not as extraorinary as reviewers' comments indicated. I had a terrible problem with the crust sticking to the glass pie plate. I surmise some of the filling leaked through and really bonded. Any suggestions??

This is the most incredible pie. I use to make it for our restaurant and everyone raved about it.Some times when we had to really mass produce we would use a plain pie crust and add a few drops of orange oil to the filling. Still with great results.

I won the "Perfect Pies" category at a local Chocolate Festival with this recipe. To give a little extra chocolate kick I used Godiva Chocolate Liquer rather than coffee in the whipped cream.

I've made this pie 4 times now, and each one has been superb. The crust really makes a difference, with its subtle orange flavor. Well worth the extra time it takes over my usual pecan pie recipe. Always a winner.

I was one of the guests who ate Mara's pie. I loved it and plan to make it for my next dinner party.

The ingredient list leaves out "3 tablespoons of all-vegetable shortening", which I know because I have made the same crust for a different recipe. You will note that, although shortening is not listed as an ingredient, the mixing directions refer to blending in the butter and the shortening.

Got rave reviews from everyone who tried it. Would definitely make again. Could add more Kaluha to the whipped cream.

I have made this recipe back in 1994 when I received the November BonAppetit issue. The pie was a success again and again. I was very happy to find the recipe in the digital file of epicurious because the 1994 issue was lost some time ago. I use my own pie crust recipe remembering not to overwork the crust, that way it remains light. A definite good receipe for the season !

This is an extraordinarily good twist on chocolate pecan pie. Very easy to do and quite good. Probably does not need to bake as long as instructed. The top will develop a candy like consistency. The whipped cream is a necessity because it balances the heaviness of the pie. The crust is worthy of the pie, but if you have a tried and true for your own crust it won't diminish the pie at all. Frankly, this november 94 issue is the best thanksgiving issue they have. It is worth your time to find it.

A wonderfully different pecan pie.
