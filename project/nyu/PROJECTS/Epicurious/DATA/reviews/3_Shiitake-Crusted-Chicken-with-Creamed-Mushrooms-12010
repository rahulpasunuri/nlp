I would definitely make this again, however, I have to agree with other reviewers that the sauce is sickly sour. A simple mushroom gravy would fit this dish much better. I made this with a number of adjustments to address some of the problems. Instead of Shiitake, I went with cremini, as you're going to lose most of the delicate Shiitake flavor anyway. Be sure to mince them Very fine for the breading. Second, to fix the issue of crust falling off during the pan frying, I sauteed the mushrooms in butter on the stove top, instead of roasting in Olive Oil. After 2 minutes, I added the bread crumbs, and sauteed until everything was golden brown, removed from the pan and pressed flat. Then followed the chicken breading process in the recipe. Instead of pan frying, which ads too much stress to the delicate breading, I roasted on a rack, Very loosely covered in tin foil, it at 450 until internal temperature was 160. The crust came out beautifully crisp, no flaking or falling off. Just be sure to roast it on a roasting rack, not flat in a pan or the bottom will get soggy.

If you just got back from the farmer's market with some super-fresh shiitakes and were looking for something yummy to do with them, then don't waste them on this recipe. If you ignore my advice, at the very least be aware some of the quantities and cooking times are a bit.. strange. 6oz of shiitakes will produce way way more than half a cup of chopped mushrooms. And chicken breasts left in the oven for ten minutes will usually be dripping blood unless they're extremely small and were pounded flat before being coated - try 20 minutes for small breasts and go up if they're larger.

This recipe was great. I used panko bread crumbs which were about the same size as the mushrooms so the mushrooms stuck on easier. I also used skim milk instead of egg to adhere the mushroom/bread crumb mixture. For the creamed mushrooms I used low fat ricotta instead of heavy cream. It make the mushrooms delicious. Everyone loved this recipe.

I thought this was very tasty. Maybe not over the top, but good nevertheless. I think you really need to use shiitake mushrooms (more flavor) and I agree with other reviewers above that you need to make more sauce. I also added just a smidge of flour to the sauce to help it thicken up a bit - but I wanted more actual liquid, so added a bit of water. I also think I'd add a splash of sherry or maybe sherry wine vinegar to the sauce.

This dish was very good. And the added bonus is that it is soooo easy to prepare. Next time I would double the mushrooms for the breading, and double the creamed mushroom sauce. My chicken turned out beautifully crunchy and tender...I may try a different variation with the sauce sometime, maybe more of a mushroom gravy and serve it over french frys.

While making sure the roasted mushrooms are minced very finely so they do adhere, the result was disappointing. There are better recipes for both chicken and mushrooms.

I agree that the mushrooms in the breading is a total waste of good mushrooms and time. Also oil is too much for frying the chicken and roasting the mushrooms. For this much fat content, there are much bettrer recipes.

An excellent dish that's easy to prepare and looks fabulous. The mushrooms and sauce really dress up an otherwise basic piece of poultry. I found the balance of flavors in the sauce to be just right.

Honestly my chicken turned out so-so. Nothing special with the breading, in fact, the bread crumbs are the only ones which stick to the chicken, the shiitake pieces are left behind. The cream mushroom is too sour for my taste, with only 1/2 lbs of mushroom and 1/2 cups of wine PLUS 1 T of vinegar, it is too much acid to balance with the cream. Won't make it again.

I needed a quick meal that was different...this was it. The chicken was so tender and juicy and the breading was to die for. I ran out of rosemary so I substituted thyme. It worked out great. It was easy, quick, and worth it!

I love how easy this recipe is and yet it tastes like you worked on it all afternoon. I doubled the creamed mushrooms so that I would have enough for the potatoes too. I was done with the preparation and sitting down to dinner in 45minutes! Extra points for that!

If I was served this at a restaurant not only would I proclaim that I had the best dish, I would also beg the chef for the recipe. And it's very easy to make. Impress your friends, MAKE THIS!

Once the mushrooms are chopped this is a very quick, easy recipe. I may use a 1/2 teaspoon of fresh rosemary next time instead of a whole teaspoon.
