This cake is exceptionally delicious. Made it for a dinner party and everyone just raved about it. It's even fantastic left over. Substituted Nutella for the hazelnut paste and the cake was so dense and fudgy. Baked in a 9 inch springform and had to cook for about 60 minutes. After it was out of the oven for about 20 minutes, the middle fell, but this may have been from transporting it. Highly recommend! Made with Nutella gelato and it was to die for!!

These were tasty, but I was disappointed with the flavor - or lack thereof. When I tested the batter, it reminded me of a Ferrero Rocher candy and was delicious and hazelnutty, but after being baked it seemd like a lot of the hazelnut essence was gone. I followed the recipe exactly (had to make my own hazelnut paste, too) so I'm not sure what went wrong. I served them with whipped cream with Frangelico added, and the crowd loved them.

i made this dish for a fancy dinner out on christmas day. I had no paste so i substituted it for nutella and it worked out great i had left over nutella and put it on top of the cake and then put a almond whip cream flavour on the cake with hazelnuts and almonds chopped up on the cake as a garnish. there were rave reveiws and about four people want this recipie.

This was my first from-scratch cake. A challenge? Yes, especially since I had to make my own hazelnut paste. But it turned out so good that by the end of the night it was gone! I'd never seen any cake disappear so quickly. And I've been asked to make it again.

Really good. I couldn't find hazelnut paste so made my own in the food processor using toasted nuts and hazelnut oil. The texture probably wasn't quite as fine as it should have been but since the recipe includes processor-chopped nuts anyway I didn't figure it would make much of a difference. To accomodate a family member with an allergy I made a non-dairy version using pareve margarine.
