OOPS, I made a mistake on my review. I meant that I wanted to make a chickpea dip without Tahini which I didn't have on hand. (next review I'll preview first)

I had leftover parsley and wanted to make a chickpea dip without hummus, which I didn't have on hand. I would definitely make this again,but would not add an extra clove of garlic as I did. This was very easy, very good and a nice change from regular hummus.

I added a fresh red pepper and chopped up green olives (maybe 8) which added texture and flavor. Delicious. Will definitely make again - quick and easy.

I made this dip a few minutes ago....added 1 extra clove garlic and used 1/2 argula and 1/2 parsley....I think it's great.

Yummy, I did add more garlic and salt than the recipe stated. And to get the creaminess I wanted I added a few extra teaspoons of olive oil.

I was bored and decided to make something with chick peas which I had a can of in the pantry. I looked up the ingredient in the search feature of epicurious and decided to make this simple little dip since I have an abundance of fresh pardely in my garden right now. THis is another great variation of a greek style hummus. It is not bland at all and really tastes wonderful. I recommend this one. I made pita cumin croutons/crisps which I found in a chick pea soup recipe on this site. Its a great combination.

omitted the water and added some lemon juice and liquid from the can of chick peas & it tasted great !

I gave this a 2 as-is, but after adding some pureed green olives, we loved it...would give that version a 4. Definitely not bland then.

I've made this several times now, and it has been consistently zippy...use huge fresh garlic cloves, a little extra lemon juice, and make free with the herbs! Cumin, cilantro, and cayenne are all good additions. I think it's good as-is, too.

Had high hopes, but it just lacked something... I added quite a bit more garlic and spices but it didn't seem to improve the flavor. Won't make again.

This was just too bland.

The dip was so bland I added a little cumin and red pepper and it still was pretty bland.

Fresh, easy to make and delicious. Was a big hit around here. I served this with toasted pita wedges and raw vegetables.

Loved it! Loved it! Loved it! The can of chick peas I bought was only 15 oz, but it tasted great anyways. Looks and tastes delicious. I'll make this again and again.

This turns a beautiful shade of green from the parsley, which is very inviting. It is a delicious alternative to hummous, and made lighter by the parsley. Note: it did not yield as much as the recipe indicated.

Excellent party dip served with toasted bread or pita. I have often been asked for this recipe and it continues to be a favorite among my friends. Very easy to make.
