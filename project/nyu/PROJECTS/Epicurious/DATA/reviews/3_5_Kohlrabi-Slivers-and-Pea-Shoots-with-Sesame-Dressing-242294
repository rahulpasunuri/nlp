I found this to be light, easy, and very satisfying. Using tahini was a great call- thanks for the suggestion. I had fresh apples and sugar snap peas from my farmer's market so I threw those in- nice variety of textures and mild flavors. Great summer salad.

As I did not have snow peas, I made with with fresh green beans. I enjoy a little more zip, I added a little Piri Piri spice. Excellent flavour and easy to make.

I wasn't sure what to expect, since I hadn't had kohlrabi before, but it's very mild. The dressing is superb! I used tahini instead of grinding the sesame seeds myself, and that worked out fine. Easy yet elegant and tasty!

Nice and light, easy to put together. Served with Stir-fried Pork with Long Beans and Spicy Glazed Eggplant.
