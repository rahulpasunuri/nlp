This was the dessert hit for Christmas dinner. I added more sugar, butter and candied ginger to the liquid while cooking. The presentation was perfect with the beautiful caramelized glaze-. served with whipped cream. Delicious! Next time I'll serve it warm.

Quick and easy. I used a little more butter (+2 Tbsp.) and sugar (2/3 cup) and added Pecans! Yummy!

Glad I tried this out before serving for Thanksgiving - very pretty, but extremely bland! Simple is good, but it needs to taste good, too!

Rating: 2
Have to agree that this was a beautiful presentation, and that turning it out was scary but it works. However, I was a little disappointed in the taste. I used more cinnamon than called for as well as lots of candied ginger, and it still was a little blah to my taste. I used frozen puff pastry which was terrific. My guests liked it, and each took some leftovers home, so I guess that's the most important part! Probably wouldn't make again unless requested by someone!

This tart is wonderful and representative of simple & rustic elegance. I followed the recipe and it came out perfect. The only thing I added was a couple spoons of cognac right over the pears. I used my 9" cast iron skillet and the time & temp suggestions worked perfectly. The pears did shrink a bit and I should have started with an extra half pear in the pan.

This was a fabulous tart. I made it in a 10" nonstick pan and sliced the pears, arranging them in a circular pattern. Also added a bit of allspice. Be sure to use lots of pears - initially it seemed 3 would do, but after they shrank and cooked down in the caramel, I felt compelled to slice 2 more, tucking the slices evenly between the others before laying the pastry on top. This worked without a hitch - and had I not done this, I think there would have been too few pears. The pastry was delightfully flaky and buttery. I will definitely be making this again! Very simple and delicious flavours with a lovely presentation.

This tart is fabulous. I make mine in a Le Creuset skillet. It is rustic looking and so delicious. Sometimes the best recipes have the fewest ingredients. Give this one a try!

Quick, easy and delicious. Use puffed pastry to expedite the process. Have found that a lower oven temperature works best (I use an iron skillet)and it almost burns at 425. I cook the pears on a gas stove using a very low flame for almost an hour. I just made it for a last minute dinner party and it looks gorgeous! It travels well, too!

I followed the recipe exactly, but when I turned it out the crust fell apart around the edges. It also seemed a little soft at the bottom. I'm going to make it again, but I shall roll the crust a little thicker around the edges, and start it at 450 dg, then reduce heat to cook a little longer. That might do it. Any other suggestions?

Hmm. Hate to disagree with the general consensus, but I really wasn't impressed at all. The crust was dry to the point of feeling powdery in the mouth. I'll use my usual crust or try another new one next time. Doubled the butter & sugar as many recommended (I like desserts very sweet, and I generally love caramel), and the caramel flavor so overwhelmed the pears that the whole dish just tasted like so-so toffee, and the texture was way too chewy. If I make it again, I definitely won't double the caramel. But I think the effect would have been similar with less caramel -- the flavor was just too strong for the pears. It was quite pretty, and if you let it sit for a few minutes before flipping, it won't spill caramel everywhere. The pears were perfectly done, but could only be tasted if you picked them out and ate them separately.

This recipe does work well. Since we were having company who don't like to eat too much sugar, I used 1/2 cup of sugar called for in the recipe. Next time I probably will increase the sugar and butter as others have suggested. I will also cook the pears a bit longer. This crust is very good. I will use it for other recipes too.

This was delicious! It was not complicated, but a little tedious waiting for the caramel to brown. Mine took over 30 min, but I did start slow so it wouldn't burn. I doubled the butter and sugar as suggested in other reviews - it gave plenty of caramel. I think next time I'll use 6TB butter and 3/4 cup sugar. Be sure to pack the pears into the syrup closely, as they shrink when they cook and cool. Used frozen puff pastry, perfect! Tuck a 1 1/2 inch border in thoroughly for a pretty ruffled presentation. Use a plate that's a larger diameter than the pan, or else the hot caramel drips out onto your arm. I garnished it with a little chocolate ganache, but this was overkill, and it was better without it. Ice cream was good, but so cold it froze the caramel and made it sticky. Whipped cream or creme fraiche would work better.

AN EASY AND ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL RECIPE. IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG TO MAKE AND EVERYONE LOVES IT. I, TOO, USED FROZEN PUFF PASTRY AND IT MAKES THE TART LOOK EVEN MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT REALLY IS. I USED A COMBINATION OF PEARS, INCLUDING ASIAN PEARS. TO SERVE, I DRIZZLED THE PLATE WITH ALMOND SYRUP AND A DOLLOP OF FRESH WHIPPED CREME. DELISH!

Just returned from New Year's Day brunch where pear tart was the hit of the buffet table. Looked gorgeous, tasted delicious, gone in 15 minutes. As other reviewers suggested used frozen puff pastry and a couple of squeezes of lemon juice. One tip: make sure juices are thickened before removing tart from oven.

We thinly sliced the pears instead of using the whole pears. It made a nicer presentation. We liked this tart but it didn't "knock our socks off".

This is my favorite dessert to make and to eat! Always a hit with my family and friends, this tart is best topped with some almond flavored whipped cream piped around the edge. I, like a reviewer before me, use puff pastry and love the results. Definitely try this one!

Great easy finish to a dinner party. Never bother turning it out of the skillet. Serve it like cobbler. I aways toss the peeled pears in lemon juice, ginger and cinnamon before adding them to the skillet adds a nice tart touch.

I made this for my family for Thanksgiving, and it was a HUGE hit! It looked beautiful and tasted fabulous. It was so easy to make, and even easier because I used a frozen puff pastry sheet for the crust - just roll it out a bit, cut it into a circle, then pierce it a few times and glaze with egg - very tender and flaky.

This is delicious and fun to make. I had some doubts about the method before I started, but it turned out fine. As someone else noted, crystalized ginger adds a nice touch.

A delicious and beautiful way to serve pears. The pastry dough is wonderful and inverting the entire tart from my cast iron skillet to a plate was scary but it worked. I sliced my pears and upped the butter and sugar... nice and syrupy and great with French Vanilla ice cream. I'm ready for Thanksgiving...

I'm a slacker cook so I made this using store-bought refrigerated pastry dough -- and it was still very good! One of the easiest desserts I've ever made and looks wonderful on the plate.

Rating: 1
It smelled great, it looked wonderful. When I went to invert the tart, nothing came out. (I had even lightly oiled my tarte tatin pan before cooking!). So now I have a mess of terrific tasting dough, caramel and pears and no dessert for my dinner party!

Fabulous and sooo easy. I am not a baker at all, my specialty is main courses and app's but don't I get assigned dessert at our last supper club! I made 2 of these- one as is except I slightly increased the butter/sugar to make more caramel. When I realized that one probably wouldn't serve all of us I made another, this time adding crystallized ginger to the pan and sprinkling the pears with both cinnamon and ground ginger and using one of those ready made, folded pie crusts. I served them with true vanilla and Hagan Daz's Dulce de Leche ice cream. Both got complete raves and no body could tell the difference in the crusts! I would reccemnd this recipe to any one.

Beautiful and delicious. The dough was very much like shortbread - yummy! The perfect finish to a great meal - everyone was impressed.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. We had wonderfully large pears, so I quartered them pears instead of halving them. I also increased the amount of sugar and butter so that the resultant tart would not be too dry, but reduced that separately and poured it over the tart after it finished baking. The edge of the tart was difficult to make even around the edges of the cast-iron pan, but otherwise it tasted and presented very well.

I made this for thanksgiving......I made 3 "pies" and this was the winner....hands down. The tart is not too sweet and perfect after a heavy meal. The only problem I had was the tart got too brown. Very dark. I will carmelize less next time. I will definately make this one again.

I didn't have a heavy skillet so I prepared this in a quiche pan, and quartered the pears instead of halving them. The result was delicious...flaky pastry dough, carmelized pears, rich buttery flavor, topped with some vanilla ice cream this was pure heaven. Easy to make and very wonderful.

This was a delicious recipe that I will definitely make again. The tart had an almost shortbread-like texture and the butter and sugar cooked together to make a wonderful caramel that complimented the pears perfectly. It was a little scary during the flipping stage but it turned out beautiful and was very easy to prepare.

Great presentation. The pears brown up beautifully. I would double the sugar and butter next time or make extra caramel in a separate saucepan to pour over the tart, after it's flipped. Too dry. Also, I'll add some available liquor to the sauce for more flavor. I did use a 9" store pie crust which worked just fine. Tuck it around the pears and it forms a nice nest as it browns. Cooked up beautifully in a cast iron pan. Easy and a big return for the effort.

Quick and easy but the crust was too crumbly and made for poor presentation.

Rating: 3
I really liked this tart. It was fast and easy to do. Even though the recipe says not to stir the pears while the caramel is forming; I did shake the pan a few times once the caramel was pretty welll underway, which kept the pears from sticking. I don't have a cast-iron skillet so used my regular old, non-stick Calpholon, and the tart came out just fine. I would agree with the suggestion of not using a premade crust. I used the one provided with the recipe. It wasn't a lot of work and was nice with the tart. Definitely would make this again, it's a fast, tasty and economical way to use up pears before they get too ripe.

Rating: 3
I liked it, but thought that the tart could have used more caramel sauce because it came out on the dry side. It may be because I baked it longer than recommended because I wanted a browned crust.

This is a favorite. I first made it the month it came out in Gourmet. Everyone that I have made it for now has the recipe. It is easy to make, gives a wonderful presentation, and the taste is out of this world. A good quality vanilla ice cream is the perfect accompanimment.

I made this for a small dinner party and everybody asked for seconds. It was a real smash! Very very tasty and also looks great. I used just a simple aluminum pan (instead of iron skillet) and it worked just fine. Doesn't take very long to make either.

Made this dish again for Thanksgiving and it stole the show! I added fresh ginger to the tart this time and also some allspice, both of which worked wonders. A cast-iron pan is best, believe me!! Also made a smaller one a few days later using cut up Granny Smith apples, pears, and golden raisins (also using fresh ginger) Out of this world. Don't use a ready made crust on this one if you want the total effect!!

Rating: 3
This was really yummy and has a beautiful presentation. I would give it four forks if I hadn't made a couple mistakes. I used cast iron which I guesse conducts heat pretty quickly because my pears turned out kind of black, although the crust was perfect. This doesn't taste bad but look a little odd. Make sure there is no room for the heat to sneak in between the dough and the pears while baking and keep in mind that the pears may done before the crust is totaly golden. Next time I will also keep the time cooking the pears on the stove short.

I made this upside-down tart for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! It looked so beautiful and tasted great. Flipping it out onto the plate WAS frightening but it worked! I'll definitely make it again. (I used a little more butter than called for, as the sugar seemed a little dry in the bottom of the pan.)

The making of this tart is easy and simple yet the finish product looks so professional! I just used frozen pastry dough and it turns out just fine for my tarts. All you need to do is roll the dough out and trim it into a circle. I spice up the recipe by zapping some dried blackcurrant in Grand Marnier, and then add to the caramel. Yum yum!

This is a scrumptious dessert. I find that pears are a fruit where the texture is so important that it is difficult to find a dessert that justifies cooking them rather than eating them fresh, but this recipe does just that.

Rating: 4
I concur with the overwhelming kudos on this recipe. I substituted ginger for the cinnimon, and added some fresh minced ginger with the sugar to give it a more intense flavor. I recommend this, especially with the ginger addition, as a quick and easy dessert to serve at a dinner party because it looks like you spent so much time on it....I also sliced the pears relatively thinly and arranged them in concentric circles, which made it very pretty and more professional looking.

Drop-dead, to die for delicious. And the easiest dessert I've ever made. You could make 6 in a day easily. It's so pretty and gourmet looking noone believes I make it myself. I added a few sprinkles of fresh raspberries on top for some color. Served with Hagan Daz. Yum Yum. Make sure you use unsalted butter or it doesn't come out the same. Don't pass on this one. Truly delectable.

I love to delight my southern family with new and different holiday fare and this was a big hit.

Don't insult your efforts by skimping on the vanilla ice cream!

This is a fast way to prepare a lovely dessert using fresh pears. It's a bit rustic - perfect end to a meal of freshly harvested summer vegetables. And the recipe is right - flipping the tart out of the pan is a bit daunting, but it works great!
