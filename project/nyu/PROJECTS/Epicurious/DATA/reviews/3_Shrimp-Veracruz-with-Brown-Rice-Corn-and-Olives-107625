I took the advice of adding a can of black beans when I added the corn and then i sauteed the shrimp in the cumin vs. adding the cumin directly. Both were great enhancements. I also added a chopped jalapeno and added with the other vegetables. Could probably use less rice next time, as this made a massive amount.

Went from two to four forks with following modifications: Cut rice in half. Once rice was cooked, added can of black beans. Roasted green/ red peppers and five ears of fresh corn on cob (removed husks and wrapped in foil. Could also grill in husks). Grilled rather than boiled shrimp. Before gilling gave shrimp moderate coating of cumin and ancho chili pepper (use according to amount of "heat" you like). Used half jar of Paul Newman's Black Bean and Corn Salsa (medium). Full jar makes too soupy if cutting rice in half and diminishes taste of grilled veges and shrimp. Doubled amount of lime zest. Did not add cumin in salsa as recipe called for since used to cover shrimp. Replace green onion with red (about half medium sized onion). Eliminated olives. Once veges cooked, chopped into bite size pieces. Cut corn off cob. Added veges, corn and shrimp to rice/beans and mixed well. Then added half jar of salsa/lime juice mix and very generous amount of fresh chopped cilantro. Served warm. Absolutely delicious, especially when using fresh, locally grown veges.

Dish went from three to four forks with following modifications. More than doubled corn and roasted on grill along with red and green peppers. Sprinkled shrimp with cumin and ancho chili pepper (use according to your tolerance for "heat". Also grilled shrimp. Cut rice in half and added a can black beans. Used half jar of Paul Newman's Black Bean and Corn Salsa (medium) which was mixed with lime juice and zest (double amount of zest). Full jar makes dish to soupy and diminishes flavor of roasted veges/shrimp. Did not use required cumin in salsa since did so on shrimp. Added in tons of fresh cilantro. Grilling veges/shrimp gives amazing smoked flavor and really kicks up flavor. Especially wonderful when corn is in season.

Excellent recipe and allows for many variations. I've added habernos and cilantro for a spicy unique flavor. Although, the original recipe remains a favorite and is always on the menu for our annual holiday party. I'm always asked for the recipe.

I made this a few times, with some variations. I use hot salsa, and add some more heat to my taste. And I use white rice instead of brown rice, so it tends to be a lighter dish. It tends to be a dish for a crowd. I have folks calling me and demanding this recipe. With a little variation, it is a great versatile dish.

Hated it! Pretty bland, considering the ingredients. Not worth the effort!

This was great except I made a few (vegitarian) changes. We sauteed the bell peppers, onions and corn (skipped the olives) and added the veggies to the rice still hot, and then added black beans. We still topped it off with the blended salsa mix. It is a great dish hot, and all the guests loved it. I will definalty do it again- prep and cooking time in under 30min? What more can a busy girl ask for?

I thought I would love it, but I was disappointed. My guests seemed to like it,but it didn't have the flavor I was looking for.

This recipe is definately a Super Bowl Party recipe - it made enough to feed an army! It was a great compliment to the party and spiced things up a bit! I got alot of good comments on it. I used frozen shrimp and it could have been better if I used fresh shrimp. This goes great with Chili!
