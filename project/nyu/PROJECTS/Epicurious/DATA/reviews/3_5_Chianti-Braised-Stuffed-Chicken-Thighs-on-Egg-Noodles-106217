this was truly delicious. 31/2 forks. I pounded the chicken to make it easier to stuff it. Did not have fresh parsley or thyme, added a ts of italian seasoning to filing and sauce. I up the tomatoes by a cup or so, and reduced the broth to 1 cup. I let the sauce reduce first and then added chicken. added fresh basil at the end. Yum!

I have made this recipe 3 times and its always great! This time I shortened the work by wrapping the boneless thight around a ball of stuffing, placing in a baking dish and topping with the sauce. Great short cut!

Make this now! It is perfect as written except for the tenderizing omission. Pounding the thighs makes stuffing much easier. Don't halve the recipe. The sauce is fantastic and stores well. Reviews have said it's a lot of work but it isn't difficult. Just takes time.

Made this last night and tweaked it just a bit. For our household I used turkey sausage and turkey bacon. Used a 14.5 oz. can of chopped tomatoes instead of the crushed tomatoes. Amazingly delicious---served it over cous-cous. The hubs loved it and can't wait to have the left overs tonight!

To a cook from vegas You don't buy crustless french bread. Just trim the crust off of a loaf with a good sharp knife, preferably a serrated knife. The main objective is to have crumbs made from the soft, white interior of the bread. Good luck and have fun with your recipe.

This was good, although very rich, but I must reply to some comments. First, it is not difficult to stuff the thighs. After reading the comments, I was terrified, but I had boneless chicken thighs from the grocery store, and it was easy to roll them up and tie them with a string. Now, cutting the string was another matter . . . And boiling the sauce for 10 minutes (or less) reduced it perfectly -- I had no extra sauce. Nice recipe, especially for oompany, since you can prepare it ahead.

This recipe does indeed make a ton, and it is incredibly delicious! It does take quite some time, though, so be prepared for that. One other thing, turn on your stove vent before doing any of the frying or you may end up with all the windows open to air out the place like we did lol! We used an inexpensive Chianti (was $8.99) and it did a great job. Only change I made was only cooking chicken in sauce for 30mn and simmering at the end for just 5mn, as it seemed pretty thick already. Was perfect, will make again!

Rating: 4
Even after deskinning and deboning my chicken thighs, I found this worth all the prep.Subbed in some salumi in the stuffing since I had no bacon, with good results. Wine flavor was rich and prominent, but not overwhelming. So complex and tasty.

Rating: 4
This is an elegant and delicious recipe. It's easily halved (2T beaten egg) and the assembly is simple. I recommend not oversalting the thighs before browning. Everything else should be followed to the letter!

This was really lovely. I served it with Mashed potato rather than noodles. I used regular sausage meat as I couldn't find Italian Sweet Sausage in the UK and it would have probably been tastier with better sausage. I halved the sauce and it still made loads. I also flattened my thighs and used tooth picks. I would probably use less thyme in the future but it was well worth the effort.

Rating: 3
Great recipe, and once you get the hang of stuffing and tying the thighs, pretty easy. Be sure to pound the meat to make that part easier. Didn't have any red wine, so subbed a cup or two of Chardonnay and about 1/2 c of balsamic vinegar and threw in some leftover spaghetti sauce I needed to use up. It makes tons of sauce - next time I'll do more chicken for more leftovers and will probably add something to heat the sauce up a tad.

I'm eating the leftovers for breakfast, so you know my opinion! My only change was to add mushrooms (mixed) to the onion/garlic mixture. Added some earthiness that I enjoyed. The dish was a bit saltier than I prefer, but that's easily remedied. I'll definitely make this again. Simple and hearty. Even the picky boyfriend liked it!

I love this recipe and have made it several times, always impressing my guests. The only thing I add is a couple of tablespoons of pesto to the sauce (homemade or store bought) since I usually keep some in the fridge or freezer to add to recipes. It adds a bit more flavour, especially if you are a garlic lover.

Rating: 3
The sauce is delicious. Stuffing the thighs is a chore, but they were good. Ambivalent about making it again - while it is good, for me personally, it is not worth all the effort. Presentation is a problem since the thighs, after being cooked in a bottle of red wine and tomatoes, come out reddish/brown in color and not suitable for an elegant dinner party.

Rating: 4
A keeper! I altered it slightly so that it could be baked (and thus shared more easily with neighbors). Browned the stuffed chicken as directed, then made the sauce and reduced it more after adding broth & tomatoes but didn't add chicken. Placed the stuffed chicken in a baking dish, poured sauce over it and baked for 1/2 hour. Perfect! (Also added a few tablespoons of cream to sauce to cut the acidity a little.)

Rating: 4
A wonderful flavor and the stuffing is amazing. I used turkey thighs and it worked great. After stuffed, they were quite large and one was enough for two people. I sliced each thigh into four slices, making a nice presentation on top of the noodles.

I served this at a dinner party last evening and everyone loved it. My husband couldn't wait to get the leftovers. Next time, I might try pounding the thighs a little to make them easier to stuff. Great recipe!

This is good. I doubled the filling and the thighs this time as it makes an incredible amount of sauce. The recipe is very filling as well, and no one could eat more than 2. So now I have another meal of it in the freezer. Hint to anyone who tries this: use 2 pans. Served it with a slightly chilled bottle of that good old Chianti (wrapped in a straw basket), marinated tomatoes/cucumbers and warmed up bread. Great recipe for a very hot day (as long as you have AC). It is a lot of work and makes a big mess, but well worth it.

I've made this dish several times, everyone I've served it to loves it. After I stuffed the chicken the first time, I told myself I'd never make this again. But it is too good not to take the the time to make it. I have used Chianti and Merlot to make this, they both work. I got smart the second time and doubled the recipe and froze the leftovers, it freezes very well for a few months.

My husband & I love cooking together, and were looking for a different chicken recipe. We found that this was very flavorful and worth the effort. The list of ingredients is on the long side, bit well worth it. The sauce was delicious so make sure you have some bread! A good dish for company.

I thought it was great. I read many of the reviews and anticipated a lot of work, but found the opposite. I think it boils down to... Do you really enjoy cooking? Yes, there are several steps, but start to finish it took no more than about 100 minutes. Turn on some tunes, open some wine and let it fly. The stuffing was excellent, I am going to try bleu cheese in the stuffing next time. The sauce was also great. I really like the taste of a wine based pasta sauce

To the cook in Chandler, Arizona: chill out!I'm sure you'll never visit this recipe again or the reviews, but if you do, I have just a couple of things to say to you: 1) I can tell you are a young, budding cook. You are experimenting with things, and that is VERY good; 2) You are young, I think, and haven't ever pawed through recipe books and indexes etc. If you have, GREAT, but, you seem disturbed by the number of people who DID like this recipe, and you were allowed the internet forum to express your anger toward this recipe; 3) Everyone has a different taste for things, and up until epicurious came along, there really wasn't the forum to discuss how good or bad a recipe was. I am sorry you found this particular recipe to "suck", but I think what irks you is that so many people did like it and you couldn't understand why. I hope you can pull it together. Cooking can be stressful, but for me it is therapeutic....keep your mind open.... It isn't the best, but it isn't bad, and up until the internet came along, many of us were pretty alone in our cooking. I love the Epicurious forum because it is a chance for feedback. Prior to that, I threw a lot of expensive food in the trash because it just didn't taste good enough, and of course, that is weighing in cost and labor intensity. Of course what you like is important, but if you want to cook well, you must be willing to take risks, and experience those failures. Sorry that this one was a failure for you, and maybe with some maturity in cooking you will use the epicurious website better--and the internet overall--better as well.

Considering the fact that an awful lot of preparation went into this (not to mention an entire bottle of wine), I wasn't too impressed with the final result. It was okay but not outstanding. I do think I'll use the stuffing recipe in the future -- it would make excellent meatballs.

This makes a fabulous and impressive dinner for guests. I've made this twice now, and everyone just loves it. The second time was even better. The best part is that it can be made the day before. True, the stuffing of the thighs are a bit time consuming. I spent a total of 2 hours in the kitchen from start to finish (that includes clean-up). If you're going to buy thighs that are already skinned and deboned, try to find the largest ones---that will make it easier. I was able to stuff 13 small thighs with this recipe. Only made the following adjustments to the recipe: used 2 14-oz cans of low sodium broth and a 28-oz can of the puree tomatoes. Only spent $7 on my Chianti, so I didn't think that was too pricey as others have complained about the cost of Chianti. The sauce is delicious. Other reviewers had problems thickening the sauce---the key is to have your heat on high to reduce and thicken it. I served this over campanelle and fresh chopped spinach. You know this recipe is a hit when your dinner guests ask if there are any left-overs to take home. This is a definite keeper!

I made this for company, so it was a good dish to make the night before, then finish easily during company. Making the darn things was another story, however. Stuffing chicken thighs is a pain, and it required multiple toothpicks per thigh to secure the meat. The dish had great flavor, and the dish continued to be fabulous as leftovers, but the effort would make me think twice before preparing this dish again. I served this dish over fresh herb papardalle pasta with generous helpings of fresh parmesan. I also used more pancetta than called for b/c you can never have enough pancetta!

The stuffing of the thighs is a bit of a pain (a couple of hands help) but well worth the effort. Once that's done it is very simply and easy. Be sure to buy 2 bottles of Chianti though - one for the recipe and one for the chef.

I read all of your comments and then made it exactly as called for in the recipe. The only exception was that I too used toothpicks to hold everything together. The sauce turned out great and I was advised by my guests to "please make this again."

The sauce for this recipe was very nice. The stuffing, however, was awful -- a real waste of good regiano. I would perhaps make this again without the stuffing, or with a lovely sausage stuffing for chicken from Perla Myers book "The Art of Seasonal Cooking" (out of print now, but a really great cookbook).

I took the adventurous step of making this for the first time for a dinner party, and my guests really enjoyed it.

We had a potluck dinner for my son and his friends before they went off to their first year of college, and each mom was to bring her son's favorite dish. I was surprised to learn that, of all the many meals we've made through the years, this was the dish he chose as his favorite and asked me to prepare! It's a little heavy for August, and hours over the stove in this weather wasn't pleasant, but it's certainly hearty "comfort" food. Rich and delicious.

This is a very good and easy to make recipe, especially since you can buy boneless thighs. I used a Merlot instead of chianti and the aroma from cooking was great. I did use hot Italian sausage but next time I am going to add some red pepper flakes to the wine/broth mixture because I like dishes with a little more "heat."

I almost didn't try this, but now I am really glad I did. This was wonderful, and thanks to the comments below, the sauce was perfect! I had to make some modifications to the sauce, extra spices, as I am onion intolerant (I like them, they don't like me), and used hot Italian sausage for the chicken. Also used an inexpensive Italian red wine, only ½ the bottle, and cooked the whole sauce down to almost the right consistency before adding the chicken back in. Very special, and I cannot wait to make it for company! I love this site.

This was good, but I suspect I didn't find large enough chicken thighs, as I definitely needed to supplement for a 6-person dinner party. (Ended up with 8 little rolls -- would have been better with 12 so each person could have 2) I ended up buying some more Italian sausage and braising it in the Chianti, served it alongside the chicken atop polenta, all napped with sauce. This was excellent tasting -- definitely do ahead though, it's time consuming. Received rave reviews from the guests.

This is great, especially when entertaining. I made twice with chicken breasts, and once with Chicken thighs. It is a much better dish made with chicken breasts. I also used 1/2 bottle of Chianti, and still felt there was plenty of sauce to serve over the pasta. Guests think this is fabulous!

Rating: 4
Delicious. A bit of work (I deboned thighs myself) and followed it to the letter without a problem with too much wine or sauce. Perhaps some didn't reduce it on a high enough boil for the specified times. I'll make this again and think it would be great for a party since it can be made ahead. It might be nice with polenta or a pasta instead of the egg noodles.

Rating: 3
My husband is not fond of dark meat, so I tried it with chicken breasts and stuffing under the skin. DELICIOUS. I did not find the sauce too watery as some did -- maybe they forgot to simmer uncovered or did not simmer long enough?? Next time I might try boneless chicken breast pounded thin and then tied up with stuffing. But it was really good.

made it. it was good, but am i the only person who thought the "wrapping/stuffing" stage was a bit of a mess. it was very difficult to keep everything in. if i do again, i will reduce the liquid in the sauce (i alreadt reduced by quite a bit - i felt i had to add corn starch for it to thicken. overall good. i love chicken thighs and the consistency was good and tasty.

My husband and I had this dish at someones home and decided to make it for our supper club. After reading all the reviews, I decided to comletely reduce the liquid in the recipe and then let it cool for a day with the chicken immersed in the sauce. I then brought the reduced sauce to a boil and simmered the chicken for 35 min. The sauce was the perfect consistency, but I felt like the chicken could have been cooked a bit longer. If I make it again, I would put a lid on it for about 10 min. We served this on soft polenta and liked it better than the noodles. The leftovers two days later were even better. I think this dish could be prepared as much as 48 hours in advance. Be prepared though as it is very time consuming. I also used a really inexpensive chianti and the sauce couldn't have been better.

Rating: 3
What a great use of an unknown bottle of Chianti! Being quite the Italian "wino" I am always receiving unknown vintages as hostess gifts, etc. Some of them are suspicious at worst or fabulous at best. Either way, not being a wine "snob" I love them all! Some of the best Italian reds have been the 9.99 vino-di-tavalo, exceptional when pared with the right meal! I tried this recipe the other night and it was wonderful! I never consider cooking with a wine a waste!!

Rating: 4
We skip the time-consuming chore of deboning/skinning the thighs and use chicken quarters. (Just put the luscious stuffing beneath the skin and continue.) The chicken skin enhances the flavor of this dish, deepening it, making this recipe outstanding and allowing the chicken to stand up to the hearty sauce.

This dish is absolutely wonderful! The stuffing is fantastic (I substituted turkey italian sausage). I thought the sauce was delicious. I used half Chianti/half red cooking wine. It was neither sweet nor acidic. The flavors in the dish are deep and perfect for a chilly winter evening by the fireplace.

The stuffing was fabulous - I will definitely make it again (w/o sauce). But the sauce had too much liquid and I think the canned tomatoes make it too acidic (especially when you add all the wine). If you do want to try this, try making it with fresh tomatoes and cut down on all the liquid. I reduced for over 30 minutes and still wound up with watered-down sauce.

I too thought that the wine flavor was overpowering. The stuffing for the thighs was very good. I threw away the sauce and substituted some jarred marinara sauce. If I do make it again, I would probably use only a cup of wine.

The sauce made this recipe devine! Read the previous comments about the sauce turning out too thin. I followed the recipe verbatim, and I ended up with a rich, thick and hearty sauce.

This was really a hit with my guests. I liked the fact that it could be made in advance (this is something I always look for in company recipes, and I wish I could search Epicurious recipes in an "advance" catergory!)It took a lot of time, but was definitely worth it. I found that the Chianti wasn't necessary - I used a cabernet that was on sale! I had on hand a good bread - asiago cheese and black pepper - from my grocery's bakery that had gotten stale, and used if for the bread crumbs. I made the noodles in advance, then microwaved them just before serving, and it worked out well. I made garlice parmesan popovers from the Epicurious site, and a green salad. I had a lot of compliments and empty plates.

A nice prepare ahead dish for a cold night. This was not an "over the top" dish but one I will do again. After cooking the chicken I removed the thighs from the sauce and reduced the sauce to the thickness I wanted and then put the thighs back in with the heat turned off until I was ready to reheat and serve. The flavors were rich and hearty. I used a Rosemont shiraz/cabernet at $6.99 instead of Chianti. I served the thighs over fresh pasta.

This is the first time I've cooked something from Bon Appetit that I didn't like. I was really disappointed. The flavor of the wine was overpowering - yes, I bought a good chianti.

The sauce was absolutely divine. It was thin, next time will thicken with cornstarch before serving.

I wept over the waste of fine Chianti! Why would any recipe need an entire bottle to create a sauce for a mere eight chicken thighs? The basic recipe is good, and if I make it again, I will use my trusty all-clad brasier and about 3/4 C of Chianti and maybe a quarter of a cup of broth.

This dish (while not quick to prepare) was outstanding and even better the next day. Two major changes are recommended: (1) I used much less broth in the braising liquid than the recipie called for (about half) - more would have been too soupy. (2) Egg noodles are blah, choose another pasta like bucatini or penne.

Rating: 3
This was very tasty but even though I used only half the wine and broth called for, the sauce still seemed too thin and would not thicken despite the additional cooking. I thawed a box of frozen chopped greens and added it to the stuffing, which I would definitely do again, and cut down even further on the liquids.

This recipe was great. It took some time to make but got rave reviews. Substituted chicken sausage in stuffing. I'm not sure how big their frying pan is...I couldn't fit all the liquid in my huge skillet! Added 2 cups of chicken broth instead of 3 and it was still really good!
