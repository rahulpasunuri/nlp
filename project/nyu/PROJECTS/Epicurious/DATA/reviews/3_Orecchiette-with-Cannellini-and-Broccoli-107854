After reading all the reviews, I knew that this recipe might need more than written. So, borrowing from another pasta dish that I make, I added a generous tablespoon of Penzeys Greek seasoning (a mix of salt, pepper, oregano, marjoram, lemon peel), along with lots of basil, to the tomatoes, and substituted white wine for the water. I threw in about 1/2 cup of crumbled feta cheese and grated parmesan cheese in with the pasta and tomato sauce, and voila - a very spicy, tasty pasta! I used a full 16 ounces of Barilla 55% whole wheat pasta shells (alas, no orecchiette in whole wheat), rather than 8 ounces, and there was plenty of sauce to mix with the pasta. I ended up adding a bit less than 1/2 cup of the pasta water - just enough to moisten it. One other thing: I used extra-virgin olive oil. I will definitely make this again, and recommend that cooks consider adding more seasoning to the base recipe to get a full-flavored dish.

Good for a rainy weeknight when a trip to the store for ingredients just does not appeal. I had everything to hand but fresh basil. For that I substituted a handful of salt-free, Italian herb mix, added with the tomatoes, and the flavor was fine. This is a good, healthy, out-of-the-larder recipe and I would make it again.

This dish is exactly the sum of its ingredients - nothing magical happens in the cooking process. Good option if you have lots of broccoli you need to use up. Dumping in the hot pepper and parm helps to give it a little more life.

This is a good, cheap weeknight supper. I did everything old-school--cooked my own beans, cut up a couple of pounds of tomatoes--and it was still easy and relatively quick. I really like the crushed red pepper because it gives life to an otherwise bland dish.

Made this last night with some changes and loved it. Forget brocoli - add spinach to the pasta (we used rigatoni) after draining to let it wilt. I also used 28oz of crushed tomatoes since I was out of diced. I loved the beans and the lightness of the whole meal. Will be making this again soon.

I found this to be very satisfying for a weeknight dinner. I used tomatoes canned with garlic, basil and oregano and I think it added good flavor. I also cooked my onions a little longer to get good flavor before adding the liquids. I see what people are saying about it maybe being a little light on taste, but I prefer to think of it as "subtle."

Not bad if you have a head of broccoli about to go bad and you are in the mood for pasta. This was exactly my situation...so the recipe works. Overall, a bit bland, but a good cheese at the end can make all the difference. Not a bad recipe...just not a great one. I'll make again when I have a head of broccoli about to go bad and I'm very much in the mood for pasta.

How funny that everyone on this site seems to suggest making vegetarian recipes more flavorful by adding meat, thereby ruining them. I hope you all don't throw the chorizo in and then try to serve it to your vegetarian guests (although thsi isn't really a guest recipe). Add more spices and/or use fresh tomatoes (they really don't take that long to chop or cook). Try adding the broccoli before the tomatoes and sauteeing it in olive oil with the spices, and add the tomatoes at the end for a quick simmer. I haven't made this recipe but I cook something similar often. Try also adding chopped bell peppers, adding more red pepper flakes, possibly some cayenne, and some dried italian herbs like oregano.

Broccoli, tomatoes and beans...very healthy but not a very flavorful combination in this case. If you are going for the health thing throw together fresh broccoli (blanch for a minute or 2, cool with cold water and dry if you don't like raw broccoli), a fresh tomato chopped, can of rinsed beans, can of drained albacore tuna (Trader Joe's albacore is good and reasonably priced) and a little lite dressing of your choice. Hubby was glad he had a big piece left over lasanga for lunch (Turkey Sausage and Spinach Lasanga, Bon Appetit, March 2004, very yummy and a little more work...although not as healthly!!!). I would not make it again.

I didn't think this recipe was anything special. After making this recipe, I think that I'm just not crazy about pasta dishes with canned tomatoes as the main flavor component. My husband liked it better--he rated it 3 stars--and said it was healthy.

Sorry to be the minority but this recipe was dissappointing. My whole family thought that the dish was very bland. Although very healthy, the flavor or lack there of just wasn't worth it.

this has definitely become one of our favorites. Great flavor, quick and easy on a weekday night. For even faster preparation, I use whole wheat penne pasta (do not over cook!)and a bag of trader joe's broccoli florets.

Nigella Lawson makes a similar dish, but adds chorizo and bitter greens (broccoli rabe or kale). Absolutely yummy. If you go with the kale, braise it in beef broth before sauteeing everything, then reserve some at the end to add back instead of pasta water.

This is an extremely easy, fast, healthy and delicious recipe. We used great northern white beans instead of the white kidney beans and also used medium pasta shells instead of the orecchiette.

This is great and really easy. Perfect weeknight dinner that doesn't require too much attention to put together. Just don't overcook the broccoli; there's nothing worse than soggy, flavorless broccoli! Oh, and I added extra garlic, of course...

I've made this several times for weeknight meals. It is healthy, unbelievably quick, and has a nice distinctive flavor. If you, like me, are often tempted to fall back on pasta and marinera sauce as a last-minute meal, give this a try instead. It's practically as easy.

Simple, quick and delicious. I used organic baby fava beans and even my kids enjoyed it! Great for a high fiber, high protein and meatless dinner.

This is quite good, but also a little heavy. My wife very much enjoyed it.

Almost a 4 because it's so quick and flavourful. Great for a late supper.
