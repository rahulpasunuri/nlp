Lovely! Used 1 1/2 c. cornmeal and 1/2 c. flour (like many here, I prefer a grainier corn muffin), added 1/4 c. milk as suggested by a previous reviewer, as well as 1/2 c. shredded sharp cheddar and a can of drained green chilies. Made 14 substantial muffins.

I'm about to make this for the second time; it is a wonderful starting point but even better with variations. During the first attempt I added a bit of milk, substituted yogurt for half of the sour cream, left out the corn (only because I didn't have any on hand), and used all corn flour rather than regular flour and corn meal (to be gluten free). This time I want to add the corn, which may mean that the batter won't be as dry, but using corn flour made them very light and not typically gritty. As Julia would say, delicious!

A bit crumbly but completely delicious. Made without changes.

Absolutely wonderful corn muffins. Moist and savory with a touch of sweet. I didn't have sour cream so used the trusted milk and vinegar substitution. Worked beautifully. Will make this over and over.

This was delicious, moist and savory -- the green onions added a nice flavor. I used 1 1/2 cups fresh corn, boiled and cut off the cob (about 2 ears). Also subbed in 1 cup plain yogurt for the sour cream, and added 1 1/2 cups sharp cheddar cheese. ** Note: if you add cheese, you may want to cut salt to 3/4 t or 1 t because cheese has lots of salt in it anyway

I thought these were delicious and moist. I used nonfat yogurt and added 1/4 c milk to moisten the batter. Also had two pickled jalapenos and 1/2 c shredded jack cheese. They were so tender, moist and full of flavor. I think adding the milk was very important, because the original recipe looked to dry to me.

I personally would like these better if they were not so dense; however, with that said, they still are VERY good. They represent a much more sophisticated tasteful corn bread than the dry hard tasteless stuff from the south or a light cakey sweet version that we tend to favor in our house.

I made these as mini-muffins for a big luncheon, and they were a big hit. I substituted fresh corn for the frozen and used lowfat sour cream but otherwise followed the recipe. They also froze well and were very good later after a short zap in the microwave.

A delicious step up from the usual corn muffin.

These were a total hit. I made 3 dozen for a New Year's dinner party. First time making them (or really anything like it) so when it came time to put the batter in the cups I was a little worried it was too thick. Turned out just fine. I used Greek Yogart with full fat content instead of sour creme (lactose intolerant). I'm not sure I had the full amount. Wish I could add a photo and show you.

These were really good. Will definetly make them again.

Great texture and flavor. Followed recipe to the letter, although the recipe certainly allows for creativity. No problems. This is a keeper.

I made these to go with Frogmore Stew and they were great. I added 1/4 teaspoon stevia powder and used 1/2 cup buttermilk & 1/2 cup yogurt. I will make these a bunch!

Great basic, unpretentious corn muffin recipe. I added a pinch of cayenne pepper and served with gumbo. This recipe is flexible--a little extra sugar for a sweet cornbread taste, or for savory muffins, I'll definitely add cheddar and jalapeno next time. I thought it was maybe a bit plain as is, but my dinner guests raved. The texture was perfect for corn muffins--not coarse like cornbread, but not as soft and dense as a muffin. I'm making again as a gift this weekend (with a touch more sugar.)

Rating: 4
Excellent, tender muffins. I used whole fat natural yogurt instead of sour cream and duck eggs (great for baking!) instead of chicken eggs. Made half the batch without green onions and some with. People raved about them. Will make again and again and again.

We love these muffins, good texture, they go perfectly with soups, stews or brunch. Followed the recipe and omit the onions when I serve with brunch.

I made this in a pan instead of muffin tins, skipped the green onions and used lowfat yogurt instead of sour cream. The result was good basic cornbread, with a light, absorbent crumb and well-developed corn flavor.

Rating: 1
I was surprised at how stiff the batter was and the muffins were very heavy. I followed the recipe almost exactly (was slightly short on the sour cream and added a bit of milk), though I did add some cheese. I want something lighter. I don't know if muffins are more likely to be dense than bread made in a 9x9 pan.

Rating: 4
I made a few subs, too, like other reviewers: omitted the onions, used 3/4 lowfat plain yogurt and 1/4 c milk instead of sour cream, and canola oil for butter. Delish. I overcooked them a wee bit by accident, and they were still moist, but with a good "crumb" (not too crumbly, or grainy, or dry). Definitely a keeper.

after reading reviews, i used low fat sour cream, added and extra 1/4 cup sugar and used 1/2 cup or so of scallions, chopped fine. thought these were delicious. way better than a corn bread recipe i recently made without sugar.

Rating: 3
Very good, but I made some changes. I wanted just a good, basic corn muffin with the kernals. I omitted the green onion, replaced half the sour cream with buttermilk, added 2tsps of veg oil to the wet mix, increased the sugar to 1/3 cup and the salt to 2tsps. I didn't use muffin cups and they came out just fine, 20 minutes exactly. What I got was moist, corn flavor, slightly sweet, very good

Terrible. Strange texture, salty taste, and a huge disappointment.

Very good muffins. I made a half batch and they came out great. I liked the texture with the kernels. The scallion taste was actually quite strong in mine, maybe I'll decrease the amount a little next time

Rating: 3
These are really delicious, soft, flavorful and chewy. I love the scallions and used plenty of fresh ground black and white pepper to add complexity to the muffins. Definitely a keeper and nice with hot soup. I served them with Sarabeth's Velvety Tomato Soup and my vegetarians were thrilled.

Everyone thought these were very bland. They were nice visually with the corn and scallions. I may try again with extra sugar and spice.

I messed up the proportions of this recipe & it still came out great--a hit with jambalaya

Delicious! I used egg-beaters instead of eggs, non-fat yoghurt instead of sour cream, but added 2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese (grated) and 2 four ounce cans of diced green chilis. To die for!

This is one of the best corn muffin recipes I have tried. I've made it a couple of times and each time it comes out delicious and moist. This last time, I had to improvise and I made it with a cup of nonfat plain yogurt instead of the sour cream, used canned corn instead of frozen and omitted the scallions because I didn't have any, and it still came out great. Definitely make this!

I've made these muffins many times since originally published. They have a good flavor without being overpowering.

This recipe was a disappointment. It did not have that cornbread flavor we like--tasted more like a basic muffin. I cannot recommend this recipe.

Rating: 1
I was very disappointed - even though I used less scallion than the recipe called for, the onion flavor was overpowering, and there wasn't much of a corn muffin texture. The muffins were barely touched at my dinner party and I ended up throwing them away.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. Next time I will heed other suggestions and add a little shredded sharp cheddar and just a touch more sugar. I think chives would work in place of the scallions as well. I've not had a lot of luck with other muffin recipes from cookbooks, but this one made me want to try again!

I made these for my New Years day dinner to go with the peas. Very good muffins -- I could eat them for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I used low-fat sour cream, 1/4 pound colby jack cheese, and a healthy shot of my favorite hot sauce -- Cholula. I will definitely make them again.

Rating: 4
These are outstanding and so quick and easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand anyway. They look irresistable, too, with golden brown tops studded with corn kernels and bits of scallion. I served a batch yesterday at a New Year's Day feast. There were 6 adults, 12 muffins and a table full of food, but somehow I only have one muffin left. I highly recommend these.

I always get raves with these muffins...one addition though: a healthy pinch of cayenne sharpens the flavour.

I'll make these again, just to have something different. Like other reviewers, I think I'll add cheese next time. They were good, but nothing special. My family generally are not fans of corn muffins, but thought these were better than regular ones.

I made these muffins last night using some left over corn I had. It took 3 ears to make about a cup and half. I also added a little extra sugar but not sure that it was needed. Very tasty. Next time I'll make them to go with chili. Yum!

Excellent muffins (especially with chili). Very simple to make. They freeze pretty well too, so I am always sure to have some available in case I get a craving.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! Easy and tasty. I also did not defrost the corn,and added about 2 tablespoons of milk. Some of the other reviewers wrote that the onions added little flavor, I disagree, if not added for the flavor the color is a nice plus. Make extra; their great toasted with a little butter for a quick breakfast.

Rating: 4
Loved 'em. I took the suggestions to add a little more sugar since I was serving them with spicy chili. I only added about 1/8 cup more and it was enough. I used chives instead of green onions. I let them cool before serving and they were fine but I think they would have been even better warm from the oven. Ate one the next day warmed in the micro for 15 seconds and added butter. Mmmm, wonderful! I will definitely make these again.

Rating: 4
Mm! I couldn't keep my hands off these. Though I substituted cream & buttermilk for sour cream (sour cream is not commonly available here & didn't have time to make my own), it turned out just fine. Great texture & flavor. Used less sugar & found it still quite sweet.

These muffins where very easy and very good..i had them with country chicken (chicken cooked in white gravy) and blackeyed peas/smoked turkey (tradition for newyears)everything was great! nice comforting meal! I also made the candied butternut squash...ummmmmmm ummmmmd :) perfect winter meal

I'm sad to say that my father told me this was the best thing I'd ever made in my life, which was sweet but made me feel weird about everything else I've ever made. Anyway, they were REALLY good, and I am not a baker. Next time I want to try them with jalapenos and maybe cheddar cheese...

I used this with chili (as did the last reviewer) and I was very pleased. Easy to make on a work night. I omitted the green onions, used fat-free sour cream, and forgot to thaw the frozen corn--still turned out great!

I baked these moist and tasty muffins in a hot cast iron muffin form and my family claims they are the best corn muffins they've ever had! We used the leftovers to make turkey sandwiches the day after Thanksgiving. Yum!

For some reason my muffin tin ran away from home, so I used a loaf pan and it turned out just fine. I like the earlier suggestion to add grated cheddar cheese, and I concur that you could do without the green onions. They added color, which was interesting, but contributed little in the way of flavor.

Excellent. I added another 1/4 cup of sugar to make it a little sweeter. I also substituted jalapeños for the onion for a variation.

How did you ever find my Aunt Robin's cornbread recipe!!?? :) The only difference is the amount of sugar. We prefer a more savory taste, using only one tablespoon of sugar to give it a nice brown crust... Great for cornsticks!

These are the only corn muffins I make. The corn kernels are a must. I always use yogurt instead of sour cream, and it works fine. They're good without the onions, too, for cornbread purists.

This was awesome. I used plain yogurt- didn't have any sour cream. I added 1 cup of sharp cheddar cheese, 2 jalapenos, and approx. 2 tbs milk.

These are excellent. The sour cream I used was extra thick so I added 3T. milk to thin the batter a little. I also used 1/2 cup of green onion and it still had a good onion flavor. Very moist.

This is a nice twist on cornbread. Moist and delicious, it really spices up a meal. My picky husband even liked them. I'll definitely make these again.
