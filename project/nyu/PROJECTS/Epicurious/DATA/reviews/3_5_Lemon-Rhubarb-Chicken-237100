I made this faithfully other than using boneless chicken and making modifications there. The sauce is quite good. I felt the stuffing had a little too much lemon juice. I'd suggest others try with half, then add to taste, especially if using a lemon fresh off the tree as I did. I did not get the boneless chicken to work as well as I would have liked: the stuffing fell out and then became mushy. I wound up doing the whole thing on the stove, and cutting the chicken into medallions to cook through. Next time, I'll just start that way. I made enough for several nights, so I put the extra sauce into ice cube trays, and I'll freeze the stuffing in meal-sized portions too. It was a lot of prep tonight, but the next nights will be fast and easy. Very tasty dish, with flavors I do not usually serve. It tastes like summer!

This sauce is SUCH a keeper! It was absolutely delicious on the chicken - and could be parlayed onto salmon or halibut, or it would even be fun experiment with it as the saucy stuff in a chicken pot-pie setting. A few elements I played with: I used coconut oil instead of olive oil both for saute'ing the stuffing mixture and for cooking the chicken breasts. I used a half teaspoon of anise seed instead of an Anise Star. Then I also replaced maybe 3 Tablespoons of the rhubarb ingredient quantity in the "stuffing" mixture with mango - and it was just fine. And finally, the times suggested for cooking each part of the dish worked out perfectly on my stove.

This was wonderful. The rhubarb is growing in the yard again and I'm trying to find things to cook and this was very very good. I used a whole chicken and put the stuffing under the skin and roasted it on a rack. Then I deglazed the pan with the sauce which gave it a very rich flavor. It was perfect with white rice and roasted vegetables.

This was delicious, it was nice to use rhubarb in an application other than dessert. I would suggest making extra stuffing but a wonderful dish

this sauce was amazing. AMAZING. i 1/2ed the recipe ( I had 3 chicken breasts) and still had enough sauce to freeze.I also used skinless boneless chicken breasts and cut pockets for the stuffing. I browned each side over high heat in the skillet and then dropped to low and let the chicken cook. my boyfriend agreed that this would get a high score on top chef!

The stuffing oozed out and made a black mess in the pan. Sauce excellent.

Rhubarb is finally available so I whipped this up for my family last night to RAVE reviews. It was wonderful and easy. We are health conscience so I used boneless skinless breasts and slit them open to place the stuffing and just baked off. Definate keeper!
