To avoid the confusion that I saw in some of these reviews, please note that there is HUGE difference between bbq sauce and bbq DIP. NC Lexington-syle bbq DIP is supposed to be thin and vinegary. I suggest that Elizabeth change the name of this recipe to Lexington-Style BBQ DIP, rather than sauce, since labeling it "sauce" may mislead some readers into thinking it's like one of those sweet, thick sauces you can buy in any grocery store. Also, anyone from the area certering in or around Davidson County, NC, will tell you that Lexington-Style bbq (not to be confused with Eastern NC bbq) must be served with BBQ slaw -- not cole slaw, and washed down with sweet tea or Cheerwine.

Funny thing: I made this recipe without reading the reviews -- came back and read the reviews -- and learned that our friend from Alamagordo, N.M. had done exactly what I did: cut the recipe in half, and lowered the heat. (I also replaced the ketchup with good ol' Heinz Chili sauce). Now . . . I love vinegar, and I love hot, but this was just too thin, and too acerbic. NEVERTHELESS -- I agree with the reviewer who wrote "You can go to your local grocer and pick up any thick, ketchup style" (gloppy sauce, I call it). So I added a bit more Chili sauce, just to give it some body -- and it's now great! Sweet, with a lovely underlying tang.

Make this in smaller portions and only add the heat to taste. I fully agree there is just too much of everything and it overpowers the flavor of what you put it on. I made a half recipe, tried it for the coleslaw and ended up dumping it.

After reading the reviews on this recipe, I don't believe any one here understands Lexington style. It's supposed to be thin and very tart. You can go to your local grocer and pick up any thick, ketchup style. Yes, it is an acquired taste, but here in the Carolinas, it's best. I am going to try this recipe and hope it's as good what I experience around here.

Last night I wanted to make a BBQ sauce for my 12 oz. pkg. of Curly's sauceless pulled pork, so I tried this one. Thank goodness I have cooked for over 40 years and looked at the reviews!!! I made 1/2 of the recipe--used 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar, a generous sprinkle of table salt, scant 1 tsp. white pepper, 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, 2 Tbs. of both white and dark brown sugars, 3/8 tsp. ground black pepper, and 1/4 cup ketchup. It was so liquid that I cooked it a bit to thicken it. Needless to say it was borderline TOO hot. I live in NM and am used to hot food, but this just wasn't very good, and I'm sure there are better recipes out there. Would NOT make this again!

Perfect compliment to the rich flavor of pork!! Adds very nicely to the cole slaw.

By far my favorite BBQ sauce.

The sauce is way too tart and acidic - mouth-puckering. Tried adding more brown sugar, but that didn't work - just made it sweeter, but still too much vinegar. I had to dump in a jar of store-bought barbeque sauce to make it edible, but it still doesn't taste right. Might try mixing the pork and sauce with beans to try to lighten up the acid.

This recipe is wrong, but not because of all of the vinegar...there's too much stuff in it and the proportions are incorrect. It should simply be ketchup and cider vinegar in about equal proportions (a couple more tbs of vinegar than ketchup), a touch of granulated sugar (NO brown sugar!), a couple of pinches of red pepper flakes and a whole bunch of black pepper. I have no idea what restaurant in Lexington gave her this recipe, but it sure isn't one of the good ones (maybe it's that awful new one that just opened in Welcome that doesn't even serve Cheerwine). Her slaw recipe is wrong, too. Anyway, if you don't like vinegar, you won't like Lexington style BBQ regardless of what recipe you use. Search the web...there are authentic recipes out there.

OK, but I agree with previous comment -- too much vinegar in this recipe. I tried to compensate (once I read the comment) with more sugar and katsup, but we will see how everyone likes it.

SO bad! The recipe is wrong - original recipe at girlsatthegrill.com calls for only ONE cup cider vinegar. I'll admit - now that I know I'll try again w/ one cup - has amazing potential!

If you like vinegary bbq suace, this is for you, great simple recipe which went perfectly with Pork Butt and Brisket. For once, more or less followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing.
