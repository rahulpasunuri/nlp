First made this recipe at my sister-in-law's place in Key Largo -- we bought shrimp from the dock, plucked lemons from trees in her back yard, got fresh avocados for a salad from a neighbor, grilled the shrimp outside. It was perfect. We have made this many times at the beach. Maybe one needs sand and surf for this to be wonderful, but I have never had a problem with the sauce, and, as other reviewers have said, use Pepperidge Farm bread.

Needed to check something on this recipe and was shocked to see its poor reviews -- this recipe is superb. Has been a summer standard for years and I've never had a problem with the sauce being gummy or too thick (maybe the bread choice? I use Pepperidge Farm sandwich bread). These shrimp disappear as quickly as you put them out.

The garlic sauce (more like a spread) is better suited for dipping bread. I didn't think it worked with the shrimp at all. I doubt I will make this again.

Although the Shrimp had a good flavor the dipping sauce was the worst thing I have made from this website(I have made about 30 recipes). It tasted like paste, I served the shrimp with a mixture of ranch dressing, feta cheese and garlic instead, and it worked out much better.

The shrimp in this recipe was delicious but the greek garlic sauce was very unappetizing. The consistency was almost gummy and an awful color with mostly a wet bread taste. I would make the shrimp again and come up with a better dipping sauce or just alone.
