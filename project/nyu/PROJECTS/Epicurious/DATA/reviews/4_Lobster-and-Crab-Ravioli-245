Whole Lobsters too expensive. Bought Lobster tails for $6 a piece. Wrapped shells in cheese cloth fro easy removal.

My Gourmet Club loved it! Omitted the lentils and cilantro. Added a splash of Pernod to the sauce. Made my own pasta. Garnished with Fennel stems and quartered cherry tomatoes. It was beautiful!

What an elegant dish! Made it as part of dinner party meal at Christmastime. I left out the lentils as other readers have. Doesn't make sense to me. I also substituted parsley in place of cilantro. My guests raved about it all night.

As an earlier reviewer suggested, I substituted fat- free evaporated milk for the cream to spare some calories. I also made my own pasta for this recipe and left out the lentils and cilantro. Although I modified the recipe significantly, I thought it was great and rated it highly. I wholeheartedly recommend this to other users.

Quite a bit of work, but quite good. I substituted the pasta with Won Ton Wrappers and left out the chick peas as suggested by other reviewers.

I have made this dish a couple of times and it has always been a major hit. I typically make my own pasta, but discovered that wonton noodles make an excellent substitution if you're cramped for time. It also tends to make the dish a bit "lighter",

Actually had this recipe, or one very much like it, at a little place in MD a few nights ago. My homemade version, via this recipe, was excellent... I think it's safe to say that if you hail from TX or middle America, better stick to great barbecue and ribs and leave lobsters to us in the cold Northeast...

I had some lobster stock and cooking juices left over so I use it to make this delicious sauce! I use it over sun-dried tomato and mushroom ravioli. I was fantastic! I can't wait to try the complete recipe. The sauce was first rate.

Had to laugh at the Indy (mais oui) reviewer! Green foamy stuff? Bile? Guts? I'm ROFL----she should have done her homework and learned about cooking lobster! That green foamy stuff(as she put it) is the lobster's tomalley and is considered a gourmet treat! Delicious! A small amount is always called for in many, many lobster soup, chowder, bisque, pasta,toasts, etc recipes. Too bad she didn't understand lobsters!

Hmmm...the majority of reviewers who liked this dish seem to have made major revisions to it on their way to "4-forkery". Just an observation.

Hated it. Admittedly, this was my first live-lobster-cooking experience so I let hubby do the murderous honors. However, when simmering the remains (shells & bodies) in the onionesque-laden broth, a suspicious green foam appeared from the crustaceans' abdomens, resembly avacados, amazingly! Hubby and I were equally repulsed by what we could only guess was guts and/or bile and opted instead for an emergency alfredo sauce. Meanwhile, having read previous reviews, I knew the lasagna noodle trick was not a fave, so I made my ravioli from homemade pasta...the only element worthy of a compliment. Eventually, we were able to laugh about it, but you see, we're newlyweds and this was my first flop...an unmitigated failure, I'd say! I'm sure there will be more...

What a waste of money and time! Please pass on this one. The porportions are way out of wack and though the sauce is good, the meat is inexcusibly bland.

Wow! This was expensive to make, but with some modifications, outstanding. I made both in rolled lasagne noodles for individual servings. I made the lobster lasagne rolls with the red sauce and the crab with the white sauce that one reviewer suggested. That one was a huge hit. We thought the red sauce was much better prior to adding the cream. I making the crab with white sauce again this weekend, though!

Excellent! I made the recipe into ravioli (homemade)but took a bit of liberty with the sauce. The sauce as it is it very good. After the ravioli were boiled, I fried them quickly in some oil and butter, added half cream and half lobster sauce with a generous amount of grated cheese. I know that I shall use my lobster shells in the future to make this sauce until just before adding the butter roux and cream. Freeze and use it as a flavoring in numerous ways. Thanks for this recipe.

My dinner guests raved about this delicous dish. I bought steamed lobsters at market to cut down on cooking, used yellow onion in lieu of shallots and green onion in lieu of leeks. I doubled madiera and LEFT OUT LENTILS. I cut wonton wrappers with round cookie cutter, washed one side with egg glaze, filled, covered with second wrapper and sealed all around edges with fork. (Prepared in morning,covered with clingwrap and refrigerated.) Right before serving, cooked in gently boiling water. Drained, added sauce and served. OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD!!!!!!!!!!

Wonderful! My husband & I had this as a main course along with Haricots Verts, Beligian Endive and Mushroom Salad BA 1/94. Good combination for a full meal. After sauteeing the shallots, etc. I deglazed the pan with the 1/4 C Madeira and needed to double it - great flavor. I substituted evap. skim milk for the cream. Next time I will try the wonton wrappers. The lasagna noodles slip off the filling. I found the lentils to be a good addition for texture. Definitely worth the effort and great as a 1st course for a formal dinner.

We who make our own pasta from scratch appreciate the time involved. Instead of using lasagna noodles, try substituting wonton (Lumpia) wrappers for a light and delightful alternative. Also, delete the lentils. They're like bread crumbs in a crabcake. They're wonderful on their own and should not detract from the sweet bouquet of the sea. Add a tablespoon of sherry to the sauce. Quite scrumptious!!

Today, I spent all afternoon on this "labor of love" to impress my persnickety (sp?) in-laws. What a success! Everyone wanted the recipe, so I directed them to your web page. Thanks so much!!

This was an outstanding dish. I couldn't have received enough praise. It's a "little" time consuming but well worth it! I went all the way and made the homemade pasta squares. Try it, you'll LOVE IT!
