Followed the recipe precisely. My first bite reminded me of something from my 1960s Easy Bake Oven. My dad used to say it was the best chocolate cornbread he ever had. I thought the muffin tasted like chocolate cornbread. My second bite made me think of a mix...the muffin taste as if it's from a box, not homemade.

We LOVED this muffin recipe. We used fresh cherries but changed nothing else. It is not to sweet. So yummy warm. Very moist.

Didn't have quite enough bittersweet chocolate, so I improvised with some white chocolate. After reading everyone's reviews about them being not so sweet, I added a dash of almond extract for fun. Also, used frozen cherries (didn't have dried ones on hand), threw them into a saucepan for a bit to thaw/simmer, pulsed in food processor & added to mix. Great muffins.

These worked well for a big company meal in place of boring bread & butter. Next time I will do a few things differently, however. I used frozen cherries to get the moisture, but they weren't sweet enough. Next time, will try dried cherries boiled in white wine to reconstitute them. Also, I would cut the second part of the chocolate either in half or out entirely to make the chocolate flavor a little less heavy. Fact is, however, even without the changes, we just kept eating them.

These were excellent! I used frozen sour cherries I had bought last summer at the farmer's market. Not super-sweet, but with the dark chocolate, an excellent combination. Only took 15 minutes to bake, no changes otherwise.

My family loved the muffins. I used fresh cherries and added 3 tablespoons of cherry jam.

Not chocolaty enough and the chewey cherries in the muffins was just all wrong. Cherries would work in brownies...but muffins? No way. I won't be making this again.

A huge hit with my husband and son who are chocolate lovers.

Why all the bad reviews?! We thought these muffins were great! I found the recipe because I have quite a few fresh cherries I need to use, so I did make with fresh (pitted and quartered) rather than dried. Because some other testers found the muffins dry, I baked them for 10 minutes, checked (very underdone), then 12 (still underdone), and finally took them out at 14. I used high quality dark chocolate...maybe that has something to do with it...higher cocoa butter content? We will be making these again and again...I think they'd be great with blueberries, too!

These muffins were indeed dry. After having read the previous reviewer's comments about dryness, I used the full stick of butter instead of the 3/4 stick, and still they were dry. I really don't know why, either. I made a few adjustments for high altitude (I live at 7,000 ft.) but nothing that would have made them as dry as they were. Also, I even baked them for the minimum time. I probably should have taken them out of the oven at 10 minutes.

I have made this several times and it has always been a hit. It isn't cloyingly sweet. It is perfect for a afternoon treat with a cup of tea.

Needs vanilla and/or a little bit more salt to bring out the chocolate flavor. Guests said they liked them, but there were sure a lot left!

These were so dry! Easy to make, but not worth wasting good chocolate and cherries in our kitchen. I ended up throwing some out, which saddened me, as I have to haul dried cherries over here from Michigan.

We really enjoyed these. Note: they are NOT sweet, but that's what worked for us, because we like our chocolate deep and dark. Dried cherries are costly so next time I will sub dried cranberries.

My family loved these muffins! I did use pie filling cherries that I rinsed and chopped to make the muffins more moist. Next time I'd like to try using sweet chocolate chips to add at the end. I'll definetly make again!

These muffins are OK, but nothing special. Not moist and chocolately, just lumpy.I wonder why the first step of the instructions tells you to preheat the oven. My oven was preheated before I finished melting the chocolate! Then the chocolate cooled for 15 minutes, while my oven was on. Could have waited on the preheating, I think. Better directions would be appreciated.

I used a cup of chopped dried apricots instead of the cherries. Everyone loved them. It made a lot more than 12 muffins though!

Delicious. Light and fluffy. Everyone asked for more and I obliged.

The muffins turned out very dry and tasteless. The cherries were also dried and added nothing. Not worth the time or effort.
