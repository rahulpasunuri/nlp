The Dutch call this Hussar Salad and it is a classic!

For folks who might think these ingredients in combination sound a mite peculiar, think again. I made this delicious salad with basically the same ingredients, but substituted red onion for the pickled onions. I did a combination of this recipe and the one for Layered Pickled Herring Salad with Tart Apples and Red Onion which is also on this site. Sour cream and just a dab of mayonnaise was the extent of my dressing, and I seasoned all with salt and pepper. The fresh dill called for in the second recipe is an important addition, in my opinion. Try it, you may love it, we did!
