If you're looking for a good Thai rice, we found that the best - and easiest - way is to add 1 tablespoon each of sesame oil and of fish sauce for every 1 cup of dry rice. If you don't have fish sauce, at least do the sesame oil.

This was fantastic! The rice came out perfect. Make the dish even simpler by rinsing the rice in a sieve until the cold water drains clear. Served it with the Chicken Stir-Fry with Holy Basil (also absolutely fantastic).

Since my last message of 1999 I've "discovered" what I consider to be the easiest, fail-safe method for cooking Jasmine rice. After rinsing, I place one cup rice and 1 cup cold water in a Pyrex bowl just big enough to leave an inch or less space at the top. Place it in anything you have that will serve as a steamer. When water in bottom of steamer boils, set rice bowl into the steamer insert, cover, and let it steam for 20 minutes. Turn heat off, leave lid on for 5 minutes. Open and stir rice with a meat fork to loosen. That's all there is to it...no salt, no oil, just water and rice. You could oil the bowl a little, but mine doesn't stick without oil.

I have actually been making jasmine (and long grain) rice this way for years. It is fail-safe and so good!

This was a wonderful recipe and a wonderful rice. I will never again use long grain rice -- which always seems so gummy to me.

I lived in Thailand for 4 years and Jasmine rice is the only rice I have made since returning. My husband used to eat Uncle Ben's, and now that he has tried Jasmine, he refuses to ever touch that minute rice stuff ever again! We cheat because we have a rice cooker, but I highly recommend Jasmine Rice to anyone!

I've made Jasmine rice like this for over 10 years. It always comes out perfect. I've even made it over a camp stove. My husband never liked rice until he tasted jasmine made like this

This is how I learned to make jasmine rice and it is always perfect - even in our rice cooker. My husband could eat this rice every night! Sorry, Chella, you'll never know what you're missing!

We spent a month in Thailand last year, and this is exactly the way the rice tasted there at every meal - delicious!! Thank you - I'll never cook Jasmine rice at 2:1 again!!

This seems unnecessarily vague. Everyone knows that rice is cooked 2:1 with water.
