Fantastic with smoked chicken! The flavors blended perfectly.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but my sauce wasn't thick enough. I tried adding more cornstarch, it was good, but I'll keep trying other recipes.

We served this sauce with our home grown, free range, 3.5 kg dressed weight Muscovy drakelet, bbq'd with applewood smoking chips. The result was ... superb!

This BBQ sauce is a favorite that we have made several times and we will make for years to come. It tastes great on chicken and pork. If you can't find the cherry preserves, any berry preserve will do.

Recipe was great the first time around. Added about 4 extra oz of cherry the 2nd time and it was fantastic!! Used it to glaze some smoked spare ribs and they we a definite hit.
