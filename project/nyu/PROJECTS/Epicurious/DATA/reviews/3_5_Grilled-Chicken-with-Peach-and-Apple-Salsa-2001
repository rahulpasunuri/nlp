This chicken recipe with the fruit salsa has been one of my family's favorites since it was published in 1993. I don't change a thing. I serve it with steamed white rice and we always add the salsa on top of the rice as well as the chicken.

I whipped this up quickly for some last minute guests, and, wow, it was great. Served it with with basmati rice and some fresh sliced tomatoes.

This was a very light and yummy summer meal. I served the chicken and salsa over jasmine rice. Next time I would make more of the salsa so the rice could soak up the flavor from the liquid. Very good!

This was an awesome recipe. I doubled the amount of lime juice in the salsa to make it more "sweet and sour". I would definitely make it again.

Very good - i was a bit late for ripe peaches so i used frozen which worked just fine. Granny smith apples with the peaches gives the salsa a nice sweet-tart contrast.

I made this dish for a ladies pool party I hosted this summer. The peach salsa was awesome and a new treat for all my guests. I suggest to serving this dish immediately after the chicken is grilled to prevent the meat from drying out. Definitely will make again!

Although intriguedby the concept of peaches with chicken, the salsa was way too sweet. Even reducing the honey didn't help. It needs more savory and spices notes, like green onion or jalapeno peppers.

I was disappointed in the taste of the chicken. The flavor was very mild. I even let the chicken marinate overnight, and it didn't taste like anything special. (The salsa, however, is outstanding. That is what really makes the dish.)

Add our raves to this recipe! Me on the ease of preparation and both his and mine on the taste! I served it simply with rice and steamed baby carrots. (Then immediately bookmarked it to my **** Menus folder!)

To the cook who did not make because they did not find the paeches and apples, they just needed to click on the other recipe for peach and apple salsa (underlined).

Excellent! I was forced to use can peaches and still the salsa was delicious--a great combo of honey and cilantro. I served it with couscous and sauteed china peas. Easy and impressive, a great dinner for a date!

Delicious and easy to make. I loved the salsa and can see it would go well with many other dishes.

This was a great recipe. I didn't feel like buying white wine worcestershire so I just used a little regular and added and extra T of white wine. I look forward to trying the other reviewer's suggestion of using the salsa for swordfish.

Good simple recipe, with great flavors for Summer. Take a tip from the Cook from Grand Rapids.

Unless I am missing something, this recipe has neither peaches nor apples in the list of ingredients. So why is it named "Grilled Chicken with Peach and Apple Salsa"? With these ingredients absent, I decided not to make it!

Actually, this is an excellent recipe. For the enlightenment of prrthd (parrothead, perhaps?) click on the green Peach and Apple Salsa link to find the (duh!) peaches and apples!

I think this recipe sucked, it does not mention peaches or apples in the recipe or ingediants anywhere! I was expecting a recipe using, duh, peaches and apples.
