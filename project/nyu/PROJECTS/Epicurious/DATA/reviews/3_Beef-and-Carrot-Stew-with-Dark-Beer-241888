Very good. I especially enjoyed the carrots.

To potent. I would put in potatoes too. Added some other veggies that I had such as parsnip. I did use extra stout, could that be the difference?

I very much enjoyed this recipe. I did augment it with a tablespoon of red current jelly. (I made it once in Palm Springs for family while on vacation and used black current jelly which worked as well). I've served it Irish style over a bed of mashed potatoes. It also goes well served over basmati rice.

This is really quite good. Nice dark broth, good strong flavor, really requires good beef. Normal substitutions: olive oil instead of peanut; Sirloin instead of chuck roast; beef bouillon instead of canned broth; dried spices instead of fresh; peeled baby carrots instead of ones with tops. Results: olive oil works fine, sirloin is good but Pot Roast is better choice. Bouillon creates a nice beefy broth that works well with the Guinness. Reducing spices by third since using dried still gives good flavor of rosemary & sage. Usually served over pappardelle egg noodles. Could feed four adults, but we have two adults and one large teen-aged raccoon/eating-machine so there are no left-overs. As for timing; start this one half hour before the football game, so it goes to simmer at kick-off. Add the veggies at the half; put the water on to boil for the noodles at the two-minute warning. Food will be ready when the game is over. It's stew; overtime is no problem. The longer the game, the better this gets. Occasional Options include: * one pound sliced mushrooms * one can whole water chestnuts, drained * substitute frozen pearl onions for chopped onions

I usually braise meats with the bone in, but this was a nice change. It is easier to serve without the bones and much less fat. I also would braise it a little longer. I used homemade broth and it did end up fairly dark. I am going to make it this weekend in a dutch oven camping.

This was quite good. Too late I discovered I had no tomato paste so I chopped up some sun dried tomatoes. I found the color to be quite dark. The recipe calls for 90 minutes of cooking, not 45 as stated below.

A decent stew. I made it with a really dark porter that I made myself and it had a great smell to it. I would have liked some more garlic, and some more color. I did add some wild mushrooms near the end though, and those were a great addition.

This was good, but if I make it again, I will add a potato.

I loved this. I was very faithful to the recipe (surprise). Like the other reviewer , I let mine cook longer and I changed my oil to olive. I also seasoned very generously with cracked pepper and salt while browning the meat. I got sidetracked and didn't taste before serving and I still loved it and so did my family. Lots of favor which we love. My only quibble was the color. In the magazine it was this lovely intense dark brown but I used extra stout and the color of my stew was a soft brown. Maybe if I brown my meat a bit darker to begin with. Also, the look of the whole baby carrots was nice but when serving to children I would leave off the green tops and chop to a more manageable size.

I'm not sure what to think of this. I love beef and I love Dark Beer. This was a LOT of beef and beer. My kids loved it, my Wife had to have some egg nooodles to go with it. It was good, but very strong flavors. Maybe I should try again without having those 2 Whoppers for lunch....

A great way to make the house smell yummy! Only exception to the recipe was that I let it simmer about an hour and fifteen minutes (instead of 45) as the beef and carrots were not quite soft enough for me.
