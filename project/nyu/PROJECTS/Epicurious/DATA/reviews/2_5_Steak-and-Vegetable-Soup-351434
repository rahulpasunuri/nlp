Underwhelming. Skip it.

The best thing about this recipe was the kale and the grated fresh parmesan I decided to add to give it some life. It is vegetable soup, plain and simple, with the foolish addition of steak, of all things, that just get tough in the soup. Epicurious can do far better.

I agree with previous reviewers. This was pretty good but no home run. I liked that it had all these good things in it but seems like you could get by with way cheaper cut of meat and just cook longer. I added some balsamic to the broth at the end as it was a little bland.

Nothing very special about this recipe. Just a simple beef and vegetable soup. There are hundreds of this kind of recipe on the internet. This is good, but doesn't stand out of the crowd.

Very tasty on a cold winter night! I doubled the recipe to serve 4 and had leftovers for lunch, another plus. The only change I made was to substitute lean ground beef for the steak. If I'm going to invest in a good steak, it's going on the grill, not in soup!
