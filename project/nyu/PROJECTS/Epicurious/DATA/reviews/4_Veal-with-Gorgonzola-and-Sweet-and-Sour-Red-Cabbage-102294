Impressive recipe. Perfect for dinner guests. Please make the red cabbage too. That recipe is the best red cabbage I've ever tasted!

My husband and I loved this wonderful dish. Only changes I made was to season the dredging flour with salt and pepper. Additionally, a little last minute garnish (chopped parsley or chives) would be nice. Cabbage was a PERFECT accompaniment.

Made only the veal dish and added more gorganzola to sauce. It was fabulous - a keeper recipe! Served it with noodles with sage butter and oven-roasted brussel sprouts and got rave reviews.

Wonderful recipe. I used half & half because that's what I had on hand. The gorgonzola flavor is very sutle. We also liked the Sweet & Sour Red Cabbage but of the 2 recipes the Veal was a highlight. Would be good for company but it is last minute. I served it with the Mushroom, Apple, Potato recipe - Gourmet 2000.

Had a party of 6 come over and made 22 thin veal cutlets. This was too little because the recipe was so good. A definate repeat.

Talk about easy to prepare. And the presentation is great. The previous reviewer is correct in that the sauce makes the dish, I've also substituted chicken breast instead of veal on occasion. I too make it with a jar of pre-made red cabbage.

This was excellent! I used pork instead of veal, but obviously it's the sauce that makes the dish. And sweet and sour red cabbage is a perfect accompaniment--even if you get it in a jar, like I did.
