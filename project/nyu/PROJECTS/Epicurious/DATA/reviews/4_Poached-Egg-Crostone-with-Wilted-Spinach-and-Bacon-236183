Delicious! A quick, easy, and elegant breakfast. I never seem to have spinach on hand, but I made this once with arugala and again w swiss chard-awesome both times :-)

This is a very good recipe but a little complicated. I was making a recipe for 2 so I improvised with the bread. I used 4 slices of bread and made a hole in the middle of 2 pieces and proceeded with the recipe. After reading the reviews I made a very small amount of the seasoned olive oil mixture and brushed that on the bread before baking - worked great. As written the olive oil should be cut down from about 10 ounces to 4-5. I followed the recipe going forward. TWO egg crostone per person was too much because this is rich, really good but rich. The flavor of the thyme and crushed red pepper comes through on the bread and really adds to the result. It would impress guests. I would buy the bread and follow directions if I was making for 4 people. This is nice with fruit.

After reading some of the reviews about prep time required I decided to try doing some advance prep. I prepared the bread the night before which worked well and had no adverse affects on the recipe. Also, I used one of the micro egg poachers (my daughter the college student turned me on to this) which also helped with the juggling aspect of this recipe. As others commented before, I used half the olive oil and half the spinach called for which was sufficient; but don't bypass the shallot I think it adds a dimension otherwise missed. I also used a combination of thick-cut peppered bacon and canadian bacon..my husband and son couldn't decide which they liked better. Now that I've worked out the reduced prep time I can't wait to prepare this dish for weekend guests.

Way too much olive oil!!!!! Way too much! I would cut the oil to a few table spoons, unless you want your sourdough turn into sponge-cake soaked with greese.

I made this recipe this weekend and we loved it! I agree that you have to do a lot of juggling with this one...having several things going at one time. It took me about 35 minutes from start to finish. I didn't make the bread "boats" either but opted for just about 1/2 slice (on the diagonal) of sour dough bread and it worked out just fine. I also just used grated parm cheese. Definitely going to keep this one around for a special weekend treat!

This was a perfect Valentine's Day breakfast! It tasted exactly how it was supposed to. The spinach was a good addition to average the breakfast. The description to make a successful poached egg was great also, because I've tried a lot of different ways and this one was the best, and also easiest. I will most DEFINITELY be making this again.

so very good! easier to microwave the olive oil & spices (30 sec) than in pan. I suck at poaching eggs, so i just scrambled them & put them on top. No need for the shallots in the spinach (hey, its early!) Bought stuff, made for myself saturday & sunday :)

Great Breakfast! I used Red Swiss Chard in place of spinach which added some nice color and flavor.

This dish was excellent! The texture of the bread with the flavor of garlic and thyme was devine. It was all very gourmet and a pretty presentation. I used turkey bacon and it was just fine. There was a lot of left over olive oil/garlic/thyme so next time I would half it. This recipe would be great to serve for guests.

I just finished making this dish for the second time and have to give my comments. It is now my husband's most favorite breakfast dish. In many ways it is very forgiving, use more or less of the spinach to taste. We made some with bacon and some with canadian bacon; my husband loved both. Extra egg for him. Used grated parm the first time, grated Asiago the second time, delicious both ways. First time made it almost to the recipe, the only modification being the shape of loaf I had, and I cooked the spinach dish in the pan with the bacon drippings. I seemed to have a lot of spinach. The dish is sublime, the bread brushed with the flavored olive oil was wonderful. Second time I was a bit careless, the recipe is so easy I had it memorized, but I used only about 1/4 cup olive oil and tons of garlic. Big mistake, way too garlicky. I much preferred the original recipe, good balance of flavors. I also used bagged spinach and made about 5oz; it was enough for two. I did notice though, that using bagged spinach, you do have the small stems; it's purely a visual thing if you are serving to guests. First time used bunch spinach and broke off the stem/spine; much prettier. It is a dish that moves quickly if you can juggle pans. It is easy to take the bread out and layer it with everything then place back in oven if you are serving a big group, does not dry out because of the oil on the bread and oil from bacon. And it is pretty when assembled, until that yolk is broken!
