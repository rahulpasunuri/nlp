Bland. Won't bother with this one again.

my husband and I both loved this recipe. I used a shoulder cut instead of ribeye to cut down on the price. I also substituted the same amount of anise seeds for fennel seeds (just because I couldn't find fennel seeds). The sauce is very flavorful and so simple and quick. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

RIBEYE??????? Are you kidding? Steak pizzaiola was a dish that used inexpensive cuts of beef where I grew up. It was usually made with chuck steak and oven cooked at low heat for a long period of time. Although this recipe is well thought out, the dish may become price prohibative for some. I noticed a medium sized chuck steak the other day in a local chain market for around $14. [six months ago the same steak was about $6]. Good luck to all in the kitchen these days!!!

simple take on a classic italian dish. instead of using two pans I prepared the steaks first then made the sauce in the same pan. this is easy enough to add to weekly rotation.

Very good, hubby said he really enjoyed the rustic flavors of this dish.It is a very fast dish, but does require some organization--made the polenta, too, so had four pans going at once.
