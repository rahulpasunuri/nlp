I'm a big fan of sweet and sour so I really like the flavors in this soup. However, those Thai chilies aren't messing around! I'm a 2-star kind of Thai food gal so I would drastically reduce the number of chilies I garnish with next time.

I added 1 cup homemade chicken broth, a handful of grape tomatoes, and snap peas, and about 4 oz of angel hair pasta, to make it more substantial. It's very good. I would make it again. THere is a whole lot of chopping/prep, so it's not a weeknight recipe, IMO.

I found this recipe under the section of Epicurious entitled "Recipes Children Love". My children are very adventurous eaters, so I gave it a try. However, my kids did NOT like it one bit. I also had to add chicken broth because one can of coconut milk, 1/2 c. lime juice and 6tbsp. fish sauce does NOT make an ample broth. My husband and I liked the soup ok, but felt that it was too tart.

Following reviewer recommendations to changes to the recipe turns this recipe into a 4 fork rating. My version adds a quart of low-sodium chicken broth, sliced white mushrooms, double the chicken because of the extra soup volume, celery, onion, carrot, green onion. I only used one serrano chile, coarsely chopped, but I think I could safely add 1-2 more. And 2 tablespoons of fish sauce is plenty! The soup was sour, salty goodness with a little spice. Even with the added chicken broth, I would say it's 4 dinner-sized servings.

Very tasty, but I would have used less fish sauce and a little water to thin out the richness and balance the flavours a bit more. My husband and I both thought it was delicious but very very strong in fish taste, salty and tangy. Would definitely make it again but suggest tasting before serving!

My rating is more for the inspiration the recipe gave me than for the recipe itself. After seeing there were some issues with ingredient proportions and directions, I looked at other recipe sources. I ended up using a combination of this recipe and a recipe for the Food Network. I simmered the seasoning ingredients in a quart of chicken broth, then added coconut milk, and sliced mushrooms. After cooking for a bit, added the chicken for 4 minutes. Tossed in 2 Tbsp fish sauce, a few extra vegetables (slivered peppers and carrots, then bean sprouts). Added lime juice (less than listed) last as I thought it would toughen the chicken. Toppped it off with chopped cilantro and green onions. Oh yes, and some rice noodles that I cooked in a separate pot (to make it a full meal). Forgot to mention, only used one serrano pepper! As I say, my rating is for the inspiration. If this inspires you, I recommend that you give it a try.

This is my favorite soup to order and now I am so thrilled to be able to make it at home and have fab results! :) After reading the reviews I made a few adjustments and Im glad I did because a couple of the quantities in the recipe as written seem off. With the following adjustments this soup was amazingly flavorful. It even satisfied my very picky father-in- law because you can spice it up really hot, easily, if desired. I adjusted the following: added approx 20 oz. of chicken stock to the original coconut mixture, used only 2 T of fish sauce (I think more would overpower the whole soup), our serrano chiles were REALLY hot so we only added 1 to the entire soup and the 1 teaspoon of curry paste as it cooked and then more to individual bowls for spicey eaters (8 would've been ridiculous) and I wanted the chiles for heat but not to take over the other flavors, omitted chicken and used chopped white mushrooms instead. Even if you want to use chicken, the mushrooms are an excellent addition for flavor and texture. Rave reviews from everyone at the table!!

really enjoyed this soup! took the other reviewers' advice and used: light coconut milk, chicken stock and reduced the amount of naam pla (only used 1 tablespoon and i doubled the recipe). i added the lime juice and the curry paste directly to the soup and it was fine. i will definitely make this again.

Great example of Thai flavours: sweet, sour,salty & spicy. Ditto on adding chicken stock and paste to simmer. Used dried lemon grass instead of fresh and removed after simmering, as well as frozen ginger. Great broth, but in need of more substance; bean sprouts? shredded carrot? green onions?

Simple and delicious. I also cut back on the fish sauce because I don't like it strong in flavour. Used lemongrass in the tube because hard to find in grocery store sometimes. Dinner guest asked for the recipe.

Great recipe! Quick and easy. Cut the fish sauce down to 2 TBs and added mushrooms.

wow, I'm addicted to this soup! I used ginger, crushed lemongrass, chicken thighs, palm sugar, 1TB panang curry paste,reduced the fish sauce to 3TBS, added 2c chicken broth,shallots, garlic,straw mushrooms, and held the lime juice to taste.Super easy and delicious!

Very delicious and easy soup. I, as others, added chicken stock to add to broth as without, there isn't much liquid. Very tasty

This was simply delicious. I added mushrooms, cut in quarters, and used only two shakes of fish sauce; I think the 5T if definitely a typo. I added approximately a quart of chicken stock; *just* coconut milk did not seem right to me. Also, I did not put curry paste in the bowls, I added 2t while it simmered and then used Sriracha to get the heat I wanted. I did juice half a lime in the bottom of each bowl before serving. Overall, it was awesome and my family ate the whole thing for dinner, even though I thought I made enough for leftovers.

The recipe I always use can be found at http://www.recipesforlaughter.com/2008/12/tom-kah-gai-chicken-coconut-soup.html I think it is a MUCH better recipe. I usually use equal parts light coconut milk and low-sodium chicken broth, and I usually put the ginger and lemongrass in cheesecloth to easily remove them at the end. Don't skip on mushrooms, as they really make the dish. Dark meat chicken (boneless skinless thighs) is the best with this, but I've also used firm tofu for vegetarians. Rice noodles make it a main dish.

I followed the directions and I can't even say in words how much I loved this soup. My husband was blown away, too. We each took a big bowl of it, but it was too much. Smaller portions next time. We can't wait to serve it at a dinner party.

This soup is delicious but needs some changes. One, I agree with the others that only 2T of fish sauce is needed. Two, I added an entire can of chicken stock and it might take more. Three, I substituted the chicken for tofu, added shitake mushrooms and rice noodles. And four, add the lime to taste, not the entire half a cup. Half a cup of lime juice would have been way too much. Even one qtr. of a cup was plenty.

delish! quick and easy weeknight soup, and just what the doctor ordered to soothe my cold/sinus infection. couple of suggested modifications- - I added 16 oz of chicken broth, to cut the richness of the coconut milk. still rich enough, and means I have more leftovers. - I only used 2 tblspoons of fish sauce, which was plenty salty for me! if you are new to fish sauce, start with a little, TASTE, and then add more... - in a pinch, 1 heaping tblspoon of siracha works well in place of the curry paste and chiles - and I imagine that thinly sliced vegetables, rice or rice noodles would all be great additions, to make it more of a meal enjoy!

Loved it! Just like my favorite Thai restaurant. I ut in mushrooms and used half regular coconut milk and half light.

I made this recipe (sort of) and it was great. I did not have kaffir lime leaves and the fish sauce I had was japanese. I did not crushed the red hot pepper I used but minced it. Made chinese noodles (like spaghetti) and put the fresh lime juice and Thai red curry paste in the bowl with the chinese noodles. Poured the soup in and topped with the minced red hot pepper and chopped cilantro. Wonderful main-dish meal!

The amount of fish sauce called for in the recipe makes the soup WAY too salty. I wonder if it's supposed to be 5 tsp not tbsp. Anyway, the soup is good, but only if you don't add more than a third of the fish sauce! I used 5 tbsp and had to add triple the coconut milk and some water to cut the saltiness. But it is quick to make and yummy if you watch the fish sauce.

This was good, but I would definitely recommend adding the mushrooms. They were missed in my dish.

Delicious! We added the curry paste with the second batch of coconut milk and, to cut the sweetness, ended up seasoning our bowls with soy sauce along with the peppers and cilantro. Served with a side of sticky rice for a quick meal. Will add to the soup rotation.

This was yummy! It is very simple to put together, and I like the idea of being able to customize the heat. I added the red curry paste with the rest of the coconut milk instead of in the bowl, then a shot of Siracha in my bowl with one Anaheim pepper to get the right kick. I did remove the ginger and lime leaves, which made for easier eating. The amount of lime juice was perfect for us.

This was delicious. I would have given it 4 forks but my husband didn't love it, so I compromised. He thought it was too limey...which I guess is a matter of opinion. I prepared the soup exactly as instructed except that I added button mushrooms at the end. Next time, I will remove the lime leaves and ginger before serving. Additionally I will consider using low-fat coconut milk next time. It was rich for a weeknight, but decadent for a special meal.
