Tasty and fairly easy. I'd suggest using less olive oil because the roasted peppers are already moist and a bit oily.

I made this recipe a few hours ago and so far it is bland, bland, bland. It needs vinegar, lemon juice or something! I just hope the "overnight" period will smarten it up. I'd love to hear any ideas for how to balance the oil.

Everyone at our Easter table raved about this easy to make salad. I will definitely make it again. It could be served as a bruschetta topping very easily - just chop the peppers a little smaller.

It turned out pretty well, but it wasn't spectacular. The chopped italian parsley kind of stuck out, perhaps I didn't chop it fine enough--it was a very "grassy" flavor that I think detracted from the experience.

Made this yesterday. Do follow instructions and prepare this at least a few hours before serving. Next time I make this I will use less oil. the quarter cup recommended left the ingredients swimming in oil. I also added a handful of toasted pine nuts. I would absolutely add them when I make this again - which will be soon. I was not diligent about the perfect strips of peppers when cutting - but the dish was still visually beautiful.

This is an excellent accompaniment to a seafood pasta dish and an alternative to a lettuce salad.

This was a taste explosion and absolutely amazing the next day. As a cheese lover, I added a few crumbles of goat feta as well, which worked quite nicely. My only caveat would be to other garlic lovers who might be tempted to add more than what's called for: I did, and thought it was too garlicky (very rare for me). Stick with the recipe!

What a great recipe! I've made this a few times and it has always been a hit. I added some sliced cherry tomatoes just because I had them on hand and it worked really well. The second time I made it, I cut back on the Italian parsley and added some fresh basil--YUM!

WOW! It looked like there wasn't going to be enough for my large group, but alot goes a long way! Made it exactly as written. I made it a day ahead and kept it in a ziploc bag in the refrigerator.

Loved it. Every ingredient melded perfectly. Used leftovers on crostini and in a salad.

This was very tasty and very attractive! I think it is versitile as a leftover. I want to put it on some Italian flat bread with goat cheese or mix it up with some pasta.
