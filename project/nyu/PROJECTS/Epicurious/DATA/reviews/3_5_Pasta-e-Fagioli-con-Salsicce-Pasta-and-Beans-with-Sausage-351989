I agree. Add a can of diced tomatoes when you add the beans (2 cans). Also, top with basil. Very, very good. It feels very hearty, but it's actually quite light.

I don't want to rate this recipe because I made so many changes but I did use this recipe as a base. I added red wine to the cooked onion and sausage with the garlic and rosemary. Once that simmered for awhile I added canned cannellini beans as well as a can of fire roasted tomatoes, Fresh basil and oregano. I also simmered it for a long time before adding the pasta. The end result was a dish everyone loved.

I made this pretty much as is, and then after having a small bowl, went back and added the tomatoes & basil, as suggested. It also needs to sit on simmer for about half an hour, so flavors can blend. I made the mistake of adding dried rosemary, and ended up having to pick out pieces of rosemary when eating, as they were like little sticks in the mouth. I do like the flavoring of the rosemary, however. Also, I used dried beans, cooked them longer than suggested, and they still were not soft enough. All in all, I thought this recipe was very good.

This was okay, but didn't have the depth of flavour I remember from the pasta fazule of my childhood. I made lots of tweaks--deglazed the sausage with red wine, added the garlic in with the onion, added kale, and a grana padano rind. I also topped it with grated romano at the end, and let the flavours marry a bit more before serving. In future I'd make these changes, and possibly use a richer stock, maybe half chicken/half veal.

Made this last night. I added a can of plum tomatoes (chopped), a teaspoon of fresh oregano and two teaspoons of fresh basil (both finely chopped). My wife told me to add this to her favorite soup recipes and make it again soon. It was very, very good!

Delicious. I added about 12 or so ounces of rushed tomato, 2 cans of the beans, and cooked the soup for about 30 minutes on low before adding the pasta. Sprinkled some dried oregano and basil and cayenne pepper as well. My roommate and I went to town on it. Absolutely delicious.

Agree with tomatoes and 3rd can of pureed beans for thickness. I also used 16oz pasta which makes it a little pasta-heavy, but still delicious. Flavors are great.

I agree if you are using canned beans use 2. Probably could handle more if you like. Add the crushed tomatoes...you'll be glad you did. Half the amount of pasta I think. Those little ditalini soaked up so much of the liquid (after being cooked) that I had to add stock the day I made it and add several cups for leftovers the net day. The pasta just over took the dish. I would absolutely make it again and just a few tweaks. I halved the garlic too.

If you watch the video, you can add whole garlic during cooking and then remove it for serving to give a subtle garlic flavor. Also for those who don't want all that pasta, pre-cook pasta and put the desired amount in the individual bowls prior to adding soup.

I love this as a base recipe. I didn't want to take the time to soak the beans overnight, so I bought canned beans. I strongly recommend using at least two cans, though. Additionally, I would finely chop the rosemary instead of leaving the sprig whole. Some other reviewers believe the recipe calls for too much garlic, but I disagree. In fact, I used a few more than 10 cloves because I just didn't want any left over. It was absolutely delicious and the garlic taste was not overpowering at all. I opted for hot Italian sausage instead of mild. This really gave it the kick it needed. For people who do not like spicy food, I would go with the mild. I found that 3/4 of a tsp of freshly- ground black pepper was not enough, so I added more to taste. Finally, this recipe NEEDS a can (preferably large) of crushed tomatoes. It's just not pasta fagioli without them! I highly recommend this recipe (with the above modifications, of course ;) )

I would give this ZERO forks. I too increased the beans to two cans. There was way too much pasta for the amount of broth and beans.I agree crushed tomatoes would be a good addition Recipe needs serious work.

I thought that 10 cloves of garlic was a bit much. I also think the recipe should have included tomatoes. I did like the combination of the beans and rosemary. Will make it again with tomatoes and less garlic.

Is it possible to give this recipe zero forks? I ate one bite and couldn't eat anymore. I followed the recipe as is, and never thought I'd say this, but I'd take Olive Garden's Pasta e Fagioli anyday over this recipe!

I found this to be almost inedible. I must admit that I did not read the recipe ingredients through prior to making this. If I had, I would have seen that there were no tomatoes in this soup, which can't possibly make it a true pasta fagioli in my opinion, and 10 cloves of garlic! I still did not use the full 10, but found this to taste like garlic soup with macaroni. I too, added some tomatoes, but all I could taste was garlic and there was WAY too much pasta. The soup needs thickness, perhaps boiling a potato with it, a lot less garlic, more beans and definitely tomatoes and then it might just be edible. I prefer a good base recipe that doesn't require as much tweaking. This didn't cut it for me, sorry.

This really is delicious, although I'd change a few things next time: 1) After soaking overnight, my simmering beans were done in 45 minutes, not 90! So check them from time to time; 2) Instead of leaving the sprig of rosemary whole, I think I'll chop it up finely; 3) More beans, less pasta; and 4) Add a teaspoon of hot red pepper flakes (per suggestions from others).

Easy and delicious! I used 3 cans of beans, crushing the contents of one of the cans to add substance to the soup. I also added a can of crushed tomato...Other than those changes, I pretty much followed the recipe and it is wonderful. A keeper!

Very good. I used hot sausage instead of sweet, for that extra zing.

Used the basic recipie as a guide and was very happy with it. I did add an extra can of beans and a can of diced tomatoes.. Better than "Olive Gardens"

Excellent soup. I made it once more or less how the recipe is written, using one can of beans rather than dry (as per the introduction to the recipe). It was good however there didn't seem to be many beans in the soup compared to the amount of pasta/sausage. I made it again and doubled the beans (2 cans). I found that even better but the original recipe is still excellent as written.

Recipe calls for chicken broth, but in the video the actually use beef broth. Wonder which would be better?

This is very yummy! I left out the sausage, and ended up adding more beans and 1 can of roasted chopped tomatoes. It was perfect! My Italian grandma use to make this dish without meat and with 1 can of tomato sauce. It might sound weird, but it tastes wonderful.

Tripled this recipe to sell in our restaurant/deli. It was a huge hit, so much so that we sold out very quickly. I added less garlic (three cloves minced) and a bit of red pepper flakes. Topped it off with a sprinkling of reggiano parmesean and served with piece of crusty Italian bread. Kept pasta separate until it was dished. What a nice fast easy recipe! This soup makes the "special" list!

Made this last nigth---very quick and easy. I used canned beans and ended up using two cans because I wanted a lot of "substance" to the soup. Next time I would puree some of the beans to thicken the broth slightly. Agree with others that the rosemary is a must---really adds to the flavor. And I couldn't fidn the suggested types of pasta so used penne. That was a mistake. The penne is really too large for this soup. I would make sure to select a smaller pasta next time. but all in all a very good relatively quick supper.

This is terrific. I usually put a little hot red pepper in, so instead of the sweet sausage I used hot. I agree the rosemary is a must. I have another recipe that calls for it too, which I thought was a little odd, but it is REALLY terrific in this dish.

I made this yesterday using canned beans. When I read the ingredients and saw all that garlic, I decided to cut it down a bit. I'm glad I did because it would have been drowned out in garlic flavor. The fresh rosemary is a must. I used sweet Italian turkey sausage. I might add some tomatoes to cut some of the garlic taste. It's an excellent recipe and very easy.
