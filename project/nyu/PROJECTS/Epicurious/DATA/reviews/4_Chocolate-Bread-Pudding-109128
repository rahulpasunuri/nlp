This is seriously the best bread pudding recipe. I let the bread soak for two hours and added Heath Bar bits.It's still amazing days later with some vanilla ice cream...YUM!

Delicious! Baked w/o water bath in ceramic Pampered Chef pie baker. Added 1/2 to 3/4 cup extra French bread cubes, but after 45 minutes of baking, very liquidy on the bottom. Silky in some parts, delicious, almost chewy 'crust'. Definatly making this again! P.S. I used 3 1/2 cups challah cubes, French rustic baguette cubes, and a waffle. Amazing.

I don't know if this is the case with the people who have too much custard, but my experience with these dishes is that the bread needs to be very dry in order to absorb the liquid! I put the bread in a slow oven (200)until the moisture is released and then, when cooled, crumble to crumbs and small pieces. Otherwise you get a texture more like french toast casserole... not bread pudding!

This was good, but instinct told me that 4 cups of bread wouldn't be enough for all that custard, and I was right. I had to bake it a lot longer than the recipe said, and was left with bread pudding on top and regular pudding on the bottom. If you want to try it, up the bread by a large amount, maybe even twice. I'll try another recipe next time.

Phenomenal! The next day after it chilled in the fridge it had a mousse-like consistency.

Incredibly delicious & decadent. I brought this to a party & it was gobbled up & raved over. I'd definitely make this again.

A very simple, error proof bread pudding. The texture was perfect and I really liked the chocolate flavor. But with bittersweet chocolate, I think the recipe needed something else. I liked the suggestion of adding grand marnier. Or if making whipped cream, adding orange or lemon zest to it.

This was OK but not great. Next time I am looking for a choc dessert recipe I will try something else.

Museum quality.

Very easy and delicious! I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon when I added the vanilla. I forgot the butter bits until I was done cooking so I added it at the end and let the dish sit in the cooling oven. It didn't do anything for the dish so I would skip this step next time.

Fabulous. I upped the amount of bread by about 40% or so and put in a larger baking container--there was still plenty of liquid and the end product was plenty moist and chocolatey. I let it soak 1.5 hours, and I'd still let it soak longer next time, maybe 2-3 hours or so. Fabulous and rich. Do not skimp on the quality of chocolate. I served this with the Irish Cream Sauce listed on another bread pudding recipe on this site, and it was a great combo. Will make again.

The best bread pudding I have ever had - hands down! Treat yourself with fresh whipped cream, you're in for a fabulous desert!

I ended up with a lot of liquid - could be the size of the eggs (farm fresh, some very large) or that the type of bread was not dense enough (brioche rolls). As a result, I had to increase the cooking time by 30 minutes and still had a lot of uncooked custard mixture at the bottom of the dish, though the bread was saturated. Considering two modifications for next time: 1. will use a baguette, per the recipe, though I loved the texture and soft flavor of the brioche rolls 2. I might cook the custard until just starting to thicken before adding it to the bread. I should also mention that I, too, did not dot the top with butter before baking. I fail to see what might have been gained with that step. This was incredible served warm, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This recipe was fantastic and very easy to make. 2 additions: I added 1+ tsp of grand marnier when adding the vanilla and it added a nice richness. I also skipped the butter step at th end and it was just as fabulous.

We love this recipe. Have used sourdough baguette. The contrast between the chewy crusts and goey pudding underneath is wonderful. Topped it with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Everyone always asks for this recipe.

Yum. Really good. It comes out with a bread top and a pudding bottom. Excellent and not so difficult at all.

I thought this recipe was delicious. Instead of the whipped cream, I made a bourban cream sauce with two cups heavy cream, four egg yolks and two jiggers of bourban. A real hit with my husband and 17 year old son.

This was fantastic-- super rich, but great. served it with unsweetened whiped cream and fresh raspberries. Using really good quality chocolate is a must.

This was a great bread pudding I made it for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. with orange scented whip cream and pommegranet seeds

I used 1 c half-and-half, and 2 c fat free half-and-half, which worked fine. I'm not sure how long I had to bake it, maybe a little longer than stated. Everyone loved it.

Great for chocolate lovers, not so great for traditional bread pudding aficiandos. Had a pudding texture to it.

I used challah (egg bread) instead of a baguette and added a couple teaspoons of orange zest. Has anyone tried this with fat-free half-and-half? It was delicious, but I'd love to lighten this recipe a bit if possible...

Good, but the consistancy was a little off. Also, next time I would put it together in layers...a little bread, add mixture, add bread, etc. This would have helped me avoid dry spots.

If I could choose my last meal, it would include this dessert. It is dangerously delicious. I used Scharffen Berger bittersweet chocolate.

I have been looking for a good chocolate bread pudding recipe for a long time and this is it. Very easy to make. I also thought the butter dots were unnecessary and didn't use them the second time I made the recipe with no problem. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate. I love dark chocolate but others might have preferred some semi-sweet mixed in as it is not overly sweet. Good quality bread is a must. The bread mixture needs to be soaked long enough so that the bread is soaked through, otherwise there are white flecks of bread when it is served. I tossed a handful of Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Chips on top and it was excellent. This recipe is a keeper.

I made my finicky friends sooo happy with this recipe! The butter dots made the top crispy and was just the perfect balance of texture for the dense chocolately goodness inside. I thought soaking it too long might make it soggy, but it was even better than before.

I added 1 cup of dried montmorency cherries soaked in enough brandy to cover-delicious! Soaking the bread longer gives a more souffle-like texture.

SO GOOD, and so easy. be sure to use really good quality bittersweet chocolate (70% cocoa or so) or it'll be too sweet. dotting the butter on top at the end is totally unnecessary. it's great cold, too.

I don't normally like bread pudding but this was amazing because of the chocolate. So easy and great for a casual dinner party

I don't usually make anything this calorie-intensive, so I decided to tart it up a bit. Added a tablespoon of orange zest and a generous splash of Grand Marnier with the vanilla... also Ghirardelli only makes bittersweet chocolate in 4 oz bars, so I went for broke and used 12 oz chocolate instead of 10. The result was incredibly yummy -- not too sweet, very chocolatey, and rich as Croesus. I won't be making this again anytime soon, as my arteries need at least a year to recover, but this recipe is definitely super-tasty.
