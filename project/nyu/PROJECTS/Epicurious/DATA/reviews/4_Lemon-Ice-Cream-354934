This is a really nice recipe. I don't think it gets much out of the lemon zest (you have to strain it out or it will clump in the churning process). Not being one for subtlety in matters of lemon, I tried it with a capful of lemon oil (about 1/4 tsp.) and a bit more lemon juice (1/2 c.)- very lemon. I might toss in some nutmeg next time around; this is the sort of simple recipe that it's tempting to play around with (lemon/lime, perhaps?)

I made this as written (including all 8 egg yolks!) but with two small additions -- a tiny bit of lemon extract (about a capful) to bring out more lemon flavor, and about an eighth of a teaspoon of vanilla to make it even richer. The resulting ice cream was marvelous. We ate it with marionberry pie and the combination was lovely. I agree with the earlier poster who said it would be nice to use this as a general ice cream base. I will have to experiment with that next time.

I expected a more lemony flavor. The ice cream by itself was creamy, but very simple and not a lemon-rich as I'd like. The second time I had the ice cream, I added 2-3 tsp. raspberry preserves in the bottom of the bowl and microwaved the preserves about 20 seconds. Then, served the lemon ice cream on top. That was amazing! The raspberry added to and brought out the lemon flavor deliciously. I like the idea of using this recipe as a base for other flavors of ice cream. I'll try that as well.

Made as written and it was delicious. I liked it so much that I use a modified version of it as my basic/starter ice cream recipe. To lighten up a bit without compromising on flavor or texture, I use 2c whole milk with 2c whipping cream and scale back on the egg yolks by half (4). Then I add whatever flavor I'm in the mood for (vanilla bean, mexican chocolate, coffee...) to the hot cream mixture before blending with yolks. Works every time.

Absolutely delicious. I cut the cream down to 1.5 cups and used 2.5 cups of skim milk. I also used only 3 egg yolks. The ice cream turned out very creamy and has a wonderful lemon flavor. Originally paired with the Carolina Peach Tart Tartines. I would skip that part and only make the ice cream
