Great way to do beans. We add garlic and onions to the sautee or sometimes garlic and ginger and a splash of soy sauce after they're cooked.

So easy and tasty. I threw a few cloves of garlic into the oil and sprinkled toasted sesame seeds on top afterward. Went well with roast chicken. The green beans were so crunchy and juicy, they exploded in my mouth when I bit into them. Definitely an easy staple, or something to build on and add variety to.

I loved this recipe with the addition of three cloves of garlic sauteed lightly in the oil before adding the green beans. I also boiled them about 3 minutes longer and sauteed them about 3 minutes longer, too. They were still crispy and tasty.

You can get a nice seared effect if you use peanut oil, cooking on high heat. The peanut oil seems to enhance the flavor. + garlic and salt

I added sliced mushrooms and some garlic. I liked it...the boyfriend prefers canned greened beans.

I did a variation on this to make a faux sauteed green beans like you get from a Chinese restaurant. I blanched exactly as the recipe says, which was perfect. I added a few drops of toasted sesame oil to the olive oil. I had some thin-sliced prosciutto leftover from another recipe, so minced it with 3 good-sized cloves of garlic. Sauteed the garlic and prosciutto first for a couple minutes (until the garlic starts to look translucent). Then I added the beans and also a pinch of red pepper flakes, a sprinkle of ground ginger, and a couple dashes of soy sauce. Sauteed it all for three minutes. The beans were perfect crispness/tenderness. I ate it over rice as a main course; it was delicious. I have a small bit of leftover ground pork that I'm going to make this again with.

so easy! they tasted great. I modified it slightly by sauteeing some minced garlic in the oil before throwing the beans in the pan. delicious!

These are perfect! I used the french haricot verdes from Costco, so didn't need to "french" them. I cut them up into a bit smaller pieces, about 2 inch long. Added 2 cloves of garlic to the oil, but that's it. My kids love them and they are perfectly done! Finally-a keeper green bean recipe that doesn't include cream of mushroom soup!

I'd like to give this 2.5...it's a fine concept, but missed a bit in terms of timing. It may have been the beans I had - haricot verts grown in South America - but they were not anywhere close to being cooked in the time provided. In the past, I've needed to cook them a bit longer, which is surprising given how thin they are. I blanched them just under two minutes, then did the cold water thing, dried them, and put them away for a couple of hours. My plan was to finish them in about 2-3 minutes before serving dinner. I heated the oil and added the beans. After 2 minutes they were so crunchy they might as well have been raw. I covered the pan, turned the heat to medium low so they wouldn't burn, and stirred every so often. It took almost 8 minutes before I could serve them. They were still tender-crisp; I know some people who wouldn't have eaten them this way. I'd suggest tasting them at the end of the blanching time but before dumping them into the cold water. If they taste extremely crunchy and raw, blanch longer. Since they only have 2 more minutes to cook, I'd say they should taste the way beans taste when they are almost done and only need 2 more minutes of cooking. I had 1 T of fresh lemon juice left from another recipe, so when I had about a minute of cooking time left, I added it along with 1 crushed garlic clove and 1 T butter. My guests loved it, but I plan on making it without the garlic and lemon the next time.

Sometimes simple is perfect. Very tasty with garlic and plenty of salt and pepper. Will definitely make again, and can experiment - add mushrooms, pancetta, etc.

I don't often make green beans. I thought this was tasty and easy. I put some garlic in the pan and seasoned with a little lemon juice and salt and they were great. I served it as a side with pork tenderloin and rice and peas. I will make it again.

Extremely easy and the taste of the green beans were tasty.

I've made this recipe as written but tonight I roasted a beautiful boneless pork roast in a cast iron pan. Threw the blanched beans in and they were wonderful. They were seasoned with rosemary and lots of pepper.

I think the debate over this recipe is sad. I have a an appreciation and developed taste for fine cooking, But, I did not know how to prepare green beans so that they were cooked but still firm. This recipe helped me know the basics that are obvious to others.I was very happy with my outcome. I added garlic and thought this perfectly complimented the Wasabi Tuna I served with it.

Try adding crushed garlic to the (Olive) oil.

The recipe may sound simple but but this is exactly what I was looking for today. I am hosting a spring gourmet dinner tonight for 10 making veal scallops with vermouth and capers and wanted a simple green bean side dish that I could start ahead of time and just saute before serving. I may add some toasted slivered almonds. Guests are bring Spring Greens with roasted beets and blood oranges, orzo risotto and lemon tart with lemon cream cheese frosting. All recipes from this website. I am rarely disappointed and always find the directions to be quite helpful and appreciate specific minutes to cook items as well as suggestions for make ahead options.

Stop, stop, stop. How do you get to be a gourmet chef (and what really is this) without a little help? You may be great at dessert, and less stellar with vegetables. I actually was curious about whether or not to blanch g. beans I planned on sauteeing just because I'd never done it before. And I didn't pick up a spatula yesterday.
