This makes a lot more syrup than needed for the vodka gimlets! After two pitchers over the last few weekends, this weekend I made a watermelon cocktail! Froze watermelon chunks after removing the seeds, filled blender, added one martini glass of vodka, one martini glass of the simple syrup and juice of 1 - 1 1/2 limes! blend and drink, but be careful, it goes down easy! I had to repeat it again yesterday for my sister after work. Of course, sadly, my husband and daughter had to scrounge for leftovers for dinner as I no longer felt like cooking. LOL

Lake side, loons, and basil vodka gimlets...doesn't get much better than that!!! Awesome summertime drink for just me or me and a bunch of friends!

This syrup is wonderful in the basil lemonade recipe also found on this site--everyone raved about it and it disappeared as soon as I put it out at a recent party--and I think it would be great to make some summery cocktails as well. I think the few people who thought it was "too sweet" or undrinkable must have tried it on its own, which is pretty clearly not how it's meant to be served.

An addition any bar tended could keep to make up simple cocktails or non alcoholic summertime drinks. I substituted agave nectar for the sugar (1 cup agave to 2 cup sugar for a tart lemonade mixture or 1.5 cup agave to 2 cup sugar for a sweeter mixture.)

I used purple basil and the syrup turned out a pretty pink color. The gimlets are a great drink for a summer afternoon.

Delicious. I have made this often to rave reviews and recipe requests. It's so simple. You can easily adapt it to make limeade or any other combination of citrus fruits. Likewise, I have substituted the basil with mint, thyme, lavender, scented geranium and/or a mix with lemon verbena. This is a very versatile base recipe. Equally tasty with the suggested vodka gimlets or substituting an equivalent of water for non-alcoholic mixers.

Try pouring some on plate and using it as a sauce for a mild flavored cake or torte.

I love making this syrup to use in gimlets when the weather gets nicer, and I think it really deserves a better overall rating. If it isn't obvious, it's meant to be used as a syrup for flavoring other drinks like the "basil vodka gimlets" found on this site, not to be drank on its own. To the negative reviewers, give it another chance! :)

This drink tasted like basil flavored sweet tea. Way too much sugar. Undrinkable.

Delish, made a couple of times. I used 1 cup of sugar cause I don't like overly sweet anything. Mix with vodka for a great summer drink.

This is the third time I made this, but I cut the sugar by half down to 1 cup and I think it's a better result -- not so sweet as before. Poured it over vodka and ice. Yum!

This is just awful!! I was really looking forward to a refreshing summer drink, but it was way too sweet. It was undrinkable, and we had to pour it out.

This was a wonderfully addictive syrup. Just different enough to be special. Give it a try!

The one drawback to this recipe is that I crave it! I adore the Vodka Gimlets, and I keep a supply of this syrup on hand to spice up any drink (even just water). It can be frozen (I use an ice cube tray), and although it never hardens like ice, it keeps a long time and mixes easily into cold drinks. A real winner!

Very good and simple. I used only 1-1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2 (I don't like my drinks really really sweet) and it still had plenty sweetness for me and my fellow drinker's tastes. Used the syrup for Lemon Basil Gimlets on this site for Easter cocktails in Florida, and everyone loved them. Will definitely make again!

I was dubious, but I thought that this syrup (which I used for gimlets) was extraordinary! I rarely give 4 forks for anything, but I am wild about the lemon basil gimlets made from this syrup!!!

Lovely, lovely summer cocktail! I made it on a whim for friends and they all agreed - this one is a keeper!

This was really easy to make. After it was chilled, I poured it in a pitcher, added vodka and some ice cubes, and served it straight up in martini glasses. My guests loved it and nearly all of them went back for more. Next time I think I'll cut back on the sugar by about 1/2 a cup, although it's wonderful as is!

Excellent! A refreshing change from the ordinary.

Less palatable than you can imagine...the author of this recipe obviously had a bumper Basil harvest this year and an over-active imagination. I shudder to think what they will concoct when their zucchini crop ripens........Raspberry-Zucchini syrup ?

I had this during a girls' night martinifest at the home of my old college roommate. It was so refreshing and such a wonderful change from the usual vodka martini. I can't wait to make it myself!

Very good and very different. Try it!

This syrup is fabulous. I've used it for both vodka gimlets and lemonade, and both were sublime. Perfect for a cooling summer drink!
