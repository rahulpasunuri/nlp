GREAT PANCAKES, no changes to the recipe what so ever.

Really, the pecans make this recipe. The pancakes are light and fluffy with a nice texture added by the cornmeal. (I substituted low-fat yogurt for sour cream and used 1% milk and they turned out fine.) I'd add more salt to the batter next time, though. Since making the pecans is extra work, next time I would apply the honey and cinnamon directly to the pancake and then sprinkle the toasted pecans over the top.

so so good. I made this for breakfast this morning. I could have eaten the honey pecan butter all by itself it was so good. Will make this again but not on a regular basis. It is quite fatteniing!

Having never made pancakes before, I set out to learn how to make this tasty breakfast food a couple of weeks ago. Just this morning I made these for the first time, and they were everything I was looking for in a pancake! I had been looking all over for the right recipe,and in my search I made two of the pancake recipes from Cook's Illustrated, which is normally my go to place for dishes I've never tried before, and I'm sorry to say it, but this version blows them out of the water. It is light and fluffy where other versions I tried were denser with more chew, and it has just enough cornmeal to give a crunch to the texture, but not so much that it turns cornbready as I found so often in my testing. I made warm bourbon maple syrup,and after I poured them into the pan, I alternately pushed pecans and blueberries into the tops before flipping. Raves from my guests, and a permanent place in my recipe book.

I have made these several times, the last time without the sour cream and they came out just as well. I have also made half batches without a problem.

Great pancakes. I didn't make the pecan butter topping - just the pancakes, but they were lite and delish! The cornmeal is subtle, but just perfect. Great with blueberries.

Made these for Father's Day - used 1/2 cup whole wheat and 1/2 c. white, and the 2 tbp with rye flour. Did not have fine cornmeal - the medium grind worked well here. Used whole milk yogurt instead of sour cream. The pancakes are a 'perfect' consistency, the best I have made! Made a quick fruit sauce with an assortment of frozen fruit (rhubarb, straw., rasp., mango), oj and sugar instead of the butter.

Loved these pancakes...didn't attempt the butter due to time. I used non-fat plain yogurt (I don't use sour cream in anything anymore) and 1% milk and they still turned out great. My husband loved them, too. Definitely a good pancake alternative.

Made these without the pecan butter and they were delicious. I threw in some fresh blueberries at the end- I agree with others, these were light and fluffy and the cornmeal lent the batter a lovely golden color. Easy to make- will definitely do again.

Very light and fluffy. I used whole milk yogurt instead of the sour cream, and added a little whole wheat flour instead of just all-purpose. It had a delightful graininess.

I made these pancakes today for Easter breakfast. They are the best pancakes I have ever made! I really enjoyed the texture added by the cornmeal and how light and fluffy they were. I only had 1/2 cup of sour cream so I used 1/4 cup of vanilla yogurt. I think I will make the vanilla yogurt a permanent addition. I did find that they took a little long to cook on the first side so I would make smaller pancakes next time so I can flip them more easily before they get too brown. I didn't have any european style butter so I added some "fleur de sel" to unsalted butter. YUMMY!

These are unquestionably the best pancakes I have ever had or made. I found the recipe when I was searching for a cornmeal pancake recipe. These were perfectly corn-y (ha, ha), and amazingly fluffy. I've never seen pancakes rise so much! The flavor was superb. It took a lot of self-control for me to stop at 2 (ok, 2 and a few bites!). :) There were a few things I did differently: I used a corn-canola oil blend instead of the vegetable oil, my milk was only 2% (which was rich enough!), and I made my usual substitution of Fage Total 2% Greek yogurt for the sour cream (it tastes almost exactly the same as sour cream and has the same texture; not all brands are the same as Fage Total, though, so be careful if you sub in yogurt for the first time!). I also used regular butter, not the high-fat kind. All in all, my adaptations made the recipe a little healthier. I can't get over how good they were!!! Since I'm taking advantage of the Autumn apple harvest I topped my pancakes with a mixture of apples cooked until softened in a bit of butter, water (it boils off) and sugar. I'll try the pecan mixture another time. I'll be making this recipe for _all_ of my future house guests!!!

These were so yummy and I'm very picky about my pancakes! Contrary to other reviews, I didn't find that they were at all time consuming. I even added an extra step and beat the egg whites! There was allot of extra butter, but the pancakes were good wtih loads of it. The only suggestion I would make is too add a little brown sugar to the batter. I don't like my pancakes too sweet, but I prefer brown sugar to adding syrup.

These take forever! The recipe makes waaay too much butter. I would skip that step and add the pecans to the batter like other's suggested. Still despite the wait, these were drool worthy. Not great for a last minute breakfast, but perfect for a well planned brunch.

Great pancake recipe, unlike any other I've ever tasted. I love the cornmeal in them. I've made them with "european" butter and with regular butter and I think they taste about the same. Light and fluffy. I've made them several times already. They're good even without the honey-pecan butter.

These pancakes were wonderful! Tasty &delicious. I thought that a cornmeal pancake would turn heavy,wow was I surprised...these were so light and fluffy.I used Land-O-Lakes salted butter for the compound butter. I didn't think using a european butter was necessary. Just a good quality butter will work fine. I would avoid store or no frills brandsthough, the butter fat content tends to be too low to use in a compound butter.

Great pancakes! Made breakfast in bed for my wife who was pining for pancakes and we both loved these! This will become a staple!

Pancakes were very light and airy, I was expecting something really different because of the sour cream- but really didn't wow me. All in all, delicious pancakes, WONDERFUL butter- but nothing to write home about.

Made these this morning and extremely pleased with the results. I have difficulty making light and tender pancakes but these turned out so light and airy! I prepared the dry and wet ingredients the night before and mixed them in the morning to save time. The honey pecan butter made them so decadent! This is now my pancake recipe!

After all the rave reviews, I apologize for what I am about to say. I don't know what European-style unsalted butter is, so I used regular unsalted butter to make the Honey-Pecan Butter. It turned out terribly greasy for my taste. (Next time I would delete this part of the recipe, and do as another reviewer has suggested--put the pecans in the batter.) The pancakes were excellent, even though I had to almost burn the first sides in order to get them done enough to turn without breaking them. Perhaps they were too liquid because I used low-fat sour cream and 2% milk, and maybe too hot of a burner. Next time I would use a scant 1/2 cup of the batter to make 1 pancake at a time, so they are easier to get at to flip. Hubby thought they were the lightest and best pancakes he has ever had!!!

This is a great (Light and Airy)breakfast dish. I reduced the cornmeal to 1/4 cup & increased the A.P.Flour by 1 TBLS. and cooked them as waffles for 6 minutes.... WOW... I'll make these again soon.

Best pancakes I have ever made or eaten. They were so light and airy. Only change - I would add more sugar to the pecan butter

This was an extremely delicious dish. It was simple and a pure joy putting the fork in your mouth. My fiancee could not get enough of them!!! I can't wait to make this recipe for more people!

Very good pancakes and easy to make. The honey-pecan butter is yummy. I plan to use the left over portion on toast during the week.

These are absolutley wonderful!! I usually try a different scone or pancake recipe every weekend. My husband said yesterday after tasting these..."I think that you have found it!" They are very easy and so "high" and light. And, I even used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose! Loved the butter and with warm maple syrup....YUM! My little guys loved them as well! Will be doing again and again!

These pancakes were light and melted in your mouth. Our company thought they were wonderful also.

There are two things I would change about this. Instead of putting the nuts in the butter, I would have them in the batter. Secondly, I would use white cornmeal. It's almost always better than yellow.

These pancakes were totally incredible! And they were really quick and easy to make. We couldn't stop eating them, and the pecan honey butter is to die for....we have some left and have been eating it on everything!!
