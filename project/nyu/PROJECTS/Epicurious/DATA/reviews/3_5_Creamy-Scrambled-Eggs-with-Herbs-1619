My family insists that I make this for Christmas morning breakfast every year. It is quick, simple and delicious. Even the kids love it!

I wanted to try something new for breakfast but this was only ok. I probably won't ever make it again. It's just not my taste.

This recipe was kinda gross. Perhaps it's because this is my first time cooking, but I don't really like it. The taste wasn't creamy at all.

Very tasty & creamy. Fresh herbs are a must. Will try tarragon next time!

Seriously, I don't see what all the fuss is about. It's not bad, but certainly not a "dish beyond compare". Didn't even rate a "delicious" as fas as I'm concerned. There's alot of similar recipes that I'll try before I make this again.

I make this meal every weekend for breakfast. I tried with with and without cream cheese and I prefer this meal without the cream cheese. Very simple and satisfying!!!

This was very good! I usually don't like scrambled eggs plain, but this makes them great! I only had fat free cream cheese and dried basil and parsley. I also added dried minced onion and a little extra salt and pepper. I'll make it again!

I have served these eggs several times now and experienced rave reviews. Can't count the times I had to copy for someone. Needs NO revisions!!! Just be sure not to overcook.

I loved this dish! It is easy and yet impressive. Fresh herbs are a must, and I've used different ones depending on what was available. Lovely brunch dish.

This is a very quick and delicious dish. I used normal chopped onion instead of green onions and it turned out wonderful.
