My little brother and I picked this recipe off this site when I was in high school, almost 10 years ago, and it has made a pretty regular appearance our Thanksgiving and Christmas tables ever since. We make it approximately as written, although like many reviewers we sometimes get lazy and leave the skin on the squash. Just mash the garlic a little with the dressing--silly to try and slice it. Simple and delicious. Could you add, modify, enhance to your heart's content? Definitely. Do you need to? Not at all. I'm living in Malawi this year and, to my astonishment, found brussels sprouts at the grocery store! I was able to make this with the substitution of local pumkin and butternut squash for the acorn. People loved it and it made Thanksgiving for me!

I have made this for Thanksgiving every year since it first appeared. My family loves this dish! I love all vegetables, but since I have another much loved sweet potato recipe I do omit the sweet potatoes. Over the years I have added/substituted parsnips, shallots, baby carrots and rutabagas and all turn out delicious. Yes, the garlic is too mushy to slice, but I just add it to the dressing. I make a foil pan in one corner for the beets to minimize the red staining everything. I have never peeled the acorn squash...the skin ends up soft and edible.

I LOVED this recipe! And everyone I gave a taste to loved it too. I replaced the beets and brussel sprouts with parsnips and green beans. Delish! No reason you can't use any veggies you want. Key, I think is using the highest quality balsamic vinegar you can afford. That makes the recipe. Today I am making it with some very special balsamic that is almost like syrup that my cousin sent me from Italy! Can't wait!

This is just delicious! I plan on making this for Christmas dinner. I think even my sweet potato haters will like it. I substituted parsnips and green beans for the beets and brussel sprouts. But I think the key for this recipe is to spring for a really good quality balsamic. I let a couple of people in the office taste it and they immediately ran to their computers and printed out the recipe. The taste "pops" is one comment I got. Love this!

Simple but good. Use any combo of root vegetables; I used parsnips, carrots turnips and sweet potatoes. You could probably add the sweet potatoes about 10 minutes after the rest unless you don't mind them a little mushy. I also wouldn't bother doing the garlic separate, just toss the cloves in. Oh, and I also didn't bother with the balsamic or lemon. Is it still the same recipe???

I have found that roasting the potatoes and squash together, the beets separately, and the brussels with the garlic allows you to control various cook times of each. I've also added parsnips and red skinned potatoes which was delicious. I don't slice the garlic- it's perfectly mild and a whole clove is a special bite.

This was a pretty good mixed vegetable dish. I made it for a weeknight dinner which was a mistake because it does require quite a bit of prep and while there was a fairly good result I'm not sure it's really worth it. Like a few of the other reviewers I was surprised but the acorn squash skin was actually edible.

I first saw this recipe in Bon Appetit when I was making one of my first Thanksgiving dinners in 1997 and it has been on the menu ever since. I have always made it as the recipe suggests, with the exception of adding less garlic in the end. I think the flavor is wonderful, and even tastes better the next day (more time for the vinaigrette to coat and flavor the veggies). Highly recommend.

Fantastic flavor and presentation! Seriously, how can a site like this instruct readers to slice whole roasted garlic? My family didn't get the joke, but they ate the veggies with gusto. Kept my red beets separate until serving to prevent bleeding. Blended garlic into dressing. Trader Joe's has fresh peeled acorn squash.

Excellent basic combination. The lemon gives it some welcome bite. But the beets and squash need longer to cook than the potatoes and brussels sprouts so I'd start them 15 minutes first. Also, the garlic was mush, which couldn't be sliced, not that it made any difference!

I found this delicious but the vegetable avoider in our group didn't eat it. I pureed the left overs with some chicken broth and cream. All leftover from Thanksgiving and we now have a delicious roasted veggie soup. I'll save this for a more adventurous group.

This was delicious. I made it for valentines dinner and cut the beets into heart shapes. It was a nice touch but more importantly this is easy and tasty. I added some fennel as well.

Great recipe. I add a few other fall veggies for interest. Surprisingly tasty - I could make a meal of this dish by itself. Get requests to make this dish every Thanksgiving. Even people who are not fond of veggies will eat this as it looks so appetizing and tastes so good. Highly recommended.

Wonderful recipe. Made this for the first time for a large crowd. Decided against the brussels sprouts this first time out. Used a variety of beets, butternut squash, acorn aquash and the sweet potatoes. It is a must to roast long enough, as the recipe directs, to bring out the sugars in the vegetables. I was worried about the unpeeled squash. Don't worry, the skin becomes tender! Used a Penzey's Mignonette pepper (has a hint of coriander). This is a wonderful basic approach; could be used on a variety of combinations of root vegetables. Use a high quality Balsamic. And, oh yeh, I would probably cut the sweet potatoes a bit larger, so that they retain more moisture as they roast.

This recipe was really great and so easy once I got all the veggies prepped. I think I would probably simplify in the future and concentrate on 3-4 vegetables (I added some turnips, fennel, and carrots to the mix). I used chiogga beets for the benefit of the red color without the bleeding; the flavor is much milder, though. The garlic got really mushy (just lovely!) and was a pasty, gooey addition to the dressing, which was fine. I will up the fresh rosemary a bit next time.

LOVED this! I added yellow beets (with the red beets), fennel and carrots to the entire mix. The final product was so colorful it even surprized me. And it was a huge hit at the party. I definately would do this again, and I served it to a party of 21...an easy healthy dish that looks great too! Note: I roasted the red beets under all the other vegetables so I would not color the entire mix red.

I didn't really care for this dish. I like balsamic vinegar dressing with my salads. But with roasted root vegetables, I didn't think the flavors go well together. I don't think I will make it again.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was heavenly! I left out the sweet potatoes (there were already 2 other sweet potato dishes), and I don't think that the recipe suffered at all without them. The lemon zest was a perfect compliment to the root vegetables! I will be making this very often this winter!

I made this for Easter dinner, and everyone loved it. I substituted carrots for the sweet potatoes, since we were having potatoes, and omitted the beets. Next time I will try it with the beets.

Just made this for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic - definitely use the balsamic vinaigrette, since it adds an interesting zing. I replaced the beets with parsnips and radicchio, which everyone seemed to like. Lots of people going back for seconds!

wonderful, pretty dish. i use turnips instead of acorn squash, and it works well. served it twice...once at a romantic dinner for 2 w/ salmon encrusted w/ cranberries and thyme to rave reviews, and then yesterday at thanksgiving for ten! it was a "constant comment" dish. i was asked for the recipe several times. i don't even use the balsamic...i just mince the garlic & mix w/ the olive oil, then baste everything w/ that. i do use the rosemary. the veggies are so flavorful and pretty, they only need that.

This dish is terrific! Used thawed frozen brussels sprouts. Worked fine. An extra garlic head doesn`t overdo it.

I have neither feasted on nor prepared roasted vegetables before and all I say is ... where have you been all my life :)! This dish is incredible! I originally selected this particular recipe because of the brussel sprouts (one of my fav veggies) and then mixed things up a little (no to beets, yes to fennel, etc). Although I cooked/roasted as stated, my garlic was actually very soft and unable to be cut. This actually was fabulous as when added to the veggies, it coated everything like a paste! Incredible flavour! I will do this every time now. As well, my personal suggestion would be to let the veggies and balsamic/oil sit together for awhile - 5-10 minutes - as this only enhances the flavour. This an incredibly flavourful recipe prompted favourable reviews from my husband and will make continued appearances on the dining room table.

I am not much of cook, but desperately trying! I have used this recipe for the last few family gatherings and it was a smashing success! Which in turn made me look pretty good and that says something in itself. I always end up giving the recipe out at the end of the evening. Very, very scrumptious.

Absloutely terrific. Roasting the beets to one side helps keep everything from turning purple. Peeled the acorn squash prior to roasting with great results.

My niece and nephew picked out this recipe for XMAS dinner, and it has become a family favorite for festive occasions. (It is a lot of work for every day.)

I've made this recipe several times. It's absolutely amazingly good. I often use it for potlucks, and people invariably pester me for the recipe--so I send them here! Last time I made it, I added some onions that had been cooked until they caramelized over a charcoal grill (with aluminum foil). Amazing.

I used regular size beets and roasted them wrapped tightly in foil 1 hour (makes peeling easier). Then I cut them up and added to the edge of roasting pan about 1/2 way through cooking. Followed squash peeling recommendation. I really liked this and thought it was more attractive than the picture. Next time I'll try it with thyme.

This dish has become a family favorite - I made it 3 times and it is a real hit with company.

If I could rate this a zero I would. It is by far the worst thing I have ever made from this site. For one thing -- the cooking time is way too long. You end up with mush if you follow the recipe. And microwaving brussel sprouts doesn't work - the dish gets soggy and inedible. Run away! Run away!

Super! Great flavor need to use good balsamic and extra virgin olive oil to make the flavors emerg!!

This is a delicious dish! I would recommend peeling the squash even though the recipe says otherwise, as it was a bit too chewy with the peel on it. I served this two Thanksgivings in a row, and it was a hit both times. I think I'll try it next time with the suggestion one reviewer had of separating the beets, as it does turn everything red! May be a better Christmas dish! :) My boyfriend is English and had never heard of ROASTING brussels sprouts, but soon warmed to the taste of it. Delicious!

I made this last year at Christmas and it was a hit. I don't like brussel sprouts, but this recipe has changed my mind. I have more requests for this side dish than any other. However, make sure the beets are cooked on one side of the pan, so that they don't discolor everything.

This was amazing! The flavors of all these vegetables are intensified by the dressing and by roasting them. I was so impressed with the flavor of the brussel sprouts -- delicious!

I've made this dish at Christmas, both for my family and to friends for Christmas in Vancouver, Canada. It was the main attraction. Now I intend to make it on Christmas for people I am living with in London - and I always make lots to ensure there are leftovers for turkey the next day.

A great new recipe for Thanksgiving dinner with wonderful flavors. Everyone loved it! I would definitely cook the beets separately to prevent the discoloring of the other vegetables.

Great ... but I suggest making a small foil pan to tuck into the corner of baking dish for the beets. Otherwise the color spreads and is rather unattractive. At serving time I add the beets to the other vegetables.
