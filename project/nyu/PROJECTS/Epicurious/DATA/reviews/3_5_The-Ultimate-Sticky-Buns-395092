It's a complex recipe, and has lots of butter. The results are sooooo amazing. I had to look up,the assembly directions on BonAppétit, but everything else was straight forward. I used a springform pan and inverted the buns after they cooled for 5 minutes. The sauce is A LOT of sauce.

Individually the components in this recipe were divine! The dough was soft and sweet, the sauce buttery and delicious and the filling was rich with a nice spice taste...BUT put it all together and it was butter overload. I felt like they were practically boiled in butter and the recipe could have easily made more than 9. Way to much work and a waste of butter so few buns.

I agree with the reviewer who called these Divine. Truly one of the best things I've ever turned out of my kitchen. I made them over the course of two days. Dough the first day. Filling and sauce the second. A lot of work, but totally worth it. My book club was swooning with pleasure. The taste and texture were perfect. Yes, a bigger pan may have worked better, but wow! these were amazing.

I used a 9 X13 inch pan and it was too big but that wasn't the problem for me. I used tupelo honey which is strong and flavorful but I think any honey would have been a problem for me. I like my sticky buns to have the caramel taste of brown sugar and butter and the honey changed that. If you are okay with this, youll probably think these are good.

There were many problems with this recipe. 1. The pan was way too small. Next time I'd use a 9 x 13. But there won't be a next time because... 2. The buns were more of a cake than a bread, and by day 2, the bread was dry and tasteless. We fed it to the chickens. 3. All the butter was overkill---it didn't make the buns taste any better than less-buttery buns. In my experience, mashed potatoes are much more successful in making a tender dough (http://bit.ly/dcn38v). 4. There were too many steps. For example, it's easier to drizzle the dough with melted butter and then sprinkle with sugar and spices than to beat the butter with the sugar and spices. 5. Personal notes: I don't like my sticky buns to taste of honey or nutmeg. 6. One redeeming quality: the syrup had a great texture. I'm wondering if I could make it with corn syrup in place of the honey...

Oh. My. Goodness. These are incredible! I could sell them for 5 bucks a pop on any street corner, seriously. Definitely an investment of time, so prep them the night before. And yes, the 8" pan is too small. I like the other reviewer's suggestion to make a dozen instead of 9 (they're really too filling to eat at this size anyway, and you will want to slap the hand that dares to throw away such culinary artistry) and put them in a larger pan.

These buns were RIGHTEOUS! I LOVED them. Talk about divine. They are very rich and definitely have way to much butter for the nutritionally conscious, but they are spectacular and will only be reserved for special occasions like Easter and Christmas. YOU GOTTA MAKE THESE just as they are written! I did use a 9-inch cake pan... The caramel sauce is spot on delicious and perfect in EVERY way!

These were delicious, but the 8x8 pan recommended was too small. The topping boiled over as the the rolls expanded so had to clean the oven before making Easter dinner. In the future I would make more rolls in a larger plan to avoid the boil over problem.

These are outstanding and very much worth the effort. I would try to make them smaller next time by increasing the number of rolls from nine to perhaps a dozen. The individual roll size is very generous, and a smaller portion would be just as satisfying and thus less filling.

This recipe was delicious but it comes at a price.....time. Be sure to read through directions before embarking on this journey. If you have the time, this recipe is well worth the investment (of time). Definitely have a lined cookie sheet ready for any overflow of sauce.

Made them for Easter Brunch and the family said they stole the show!I baked them in a 11 inch master chef skillet. gave them plenty of room to rise and spread out. I loved them!

Way too much butter in this recipe - total of 3 sticks within bread, filling, and topping. Most other sticky/cinnamon bun recipes have half the amount of butter, so this one is overkill. No issues with glaze running over - the instructions say to only bake 1 cup of it, so that my be the issue with the other reviews.

I agree with the above- they barely fit and ran over a little but they were awesome! A lot of work, but I would definitely make them again for a special brunch!

Not worth the time invested. They fit perfectly in the pan with no run over but the baking time should be 35 minutes and not 50 minutes. The cover made it look so good and it was just average.The sauce was a keeper.

My husband thinks these are the best pastries ever. I don't see how they could fit in an 8x8 pan and my 9x9 pan was almost too small. Definitely put a cookie sheet under them, as the other reviewer suggested because the syrup does bubble over.

Time consuming, but worth it! As it is only my husband and I, I will make them again but only for a crowd. Nine rolls doesn't sound like much, but they are huge and very rich. The filling does run over so be sure to line a cookie sheet and place underneath.
