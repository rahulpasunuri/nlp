This recipe is very similar to what my family has made for generations. In our recipe we use dry cottage cheese in the filling, and smother the finished product with drawn butter and cut up bacon. Usually serve a simple salad with vinegar & oil dressing on the side. I crave this dish fortnightly.

We loved this one. It was not as hard as it looks and will be much easyier next time now that I know what I'm doing. We topped it with a simple tomato sauce and had kale on the side. Very much worth making

The dough for this is really easy to work with, and it rolls out in no time. Very delicate flavor but tasty. We used traditional cheesecloth, and it stuck to the dumplings, tearing them in a few places, which made them hard to slice. I would actually recommend boiling these in a linen kitchen towel for better results. They really don't need a sauce, but we made one with a simple tomato puree, some onions, white wine, and a bit of dill. Served some with and some without. Definitely worth the little effort this takes--and really much easier to make than ravioli and with a much more unusual and unexpected flavor and texture.

A lot easier to make than the descriptions lead you to believe. I used pastry cloth (just from the grocery store, around the same area where you'd get the cheesecloth) instead of a tablecloth and cut the recipe in half - which gives about the perfect amount of dough to roll out to fit the pastry cloth size and make 2 large dumplings. With a pastry cloth and rolling pin cover, the dough rolls out very easily without sticking or breaking. The final result is like a large, rolled ravioli - perfect for dinner alongside a salad. Now that I know how easy it is, I'm going to experiment with different fillings - feta and mint finished with an eggplant sauce, for example. Cheap too!
