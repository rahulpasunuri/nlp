This recipe falls into the "okay" category for me. It was nice, but not particularly special. I might make it again, mainly because it was fairly easy.

I make this excellent dish regularly -- every few weeks -- and best of all, it's a flexible dish: You can use virtually the same proportions and make this dish with broccoli or green beans, instead of spinach (I recommend broccoli, as spinach ends up much smaller after you've cooked it). If you use broccoli, make sure to steam it a few minutes before adding to the saucepan; otherwise, it's too crunchy. Last, I've added sauteed onions for flavor, but I don't think they made a significant difference.

Try substituting Balsamic vinegar, but leave out the sugar. Great results.

I would make this (standard Asian) dish again only if I figured out the correct amounts for the ingredients. The proportions are wrong. Way too salty and gingery, too much sauce for my liking, sauce didn't thicken enough.

Goes well with barbecued lambchops, the different tastes gives the meal a lift. A good way to make children eat vegetables.
