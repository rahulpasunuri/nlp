A lot of work for a so-so cake. Everyone who saw and tasted it was very impressed, but I didn't think it was worth the effort. It was dry and could use more jam and lemon cream -- for moisture and because the cake and meringue frosting are pretty bland without them. For reference, I do a lot of baking and am pretty sure I did everything correctly (although the cake looked a bit more done than I would have liked, well before the recommended baking time was up).

I agree with everything the last reviewer said. The cake was very dry. I wished I had used much more filling in between layers and it was a TON of work. Though my guests oohed and ahhhed, I was not happy with how the final product looked, because the meringue frosting did not set up very well. Directions said to do 12 minutes or so on a stand mixer (I have the kitchen aid commercial mixer) I did 15, and it was so limp that the second layer actually slid and had to be pushed back into place, so some of the strawberry/lemon showed at the back, which wasn't too pretty. As I said, my guests were very impressed with the visual, but after seeing how dry it was, I served it with a dollop of leftover lemon curd cream to give it some moisture. If you are a very experienced baker, you may well have better results than I did, so go for it, if you have a lot of free time to get this done!

I made this cake for my father-in-laws birthday, something different as he says I always make chocolate :-) The cake was a lot of work and I wish I had done a little more prep work. I ended up being disappointed with the final product (but perhaps that's because it wasn't chocolate :-) The cake was a tiny bit dry and I wish I had used much more of the jam and lemon creme in between layers...1/3 cup of each did not go very far and there was an awful lot of lemon creme left over that went to waste. The meringue had very little flavor. Overall, people said they liked it but compared to an almond cake I had recently, it was bland in comparison

what else can you use instead of using lemon? strawberry or cherry?

@Bluemule, according to Miette, it's because the sides aren't frosted. https://www.miette.com/pickup/cakes/vanilla-tomboy.html

I do believe this must be delicious, and for the name I've found this at Askville by Amazon: "This cake has a gamine quality, a little rough around the edgesa bit of a tomboy with a little rose on top. The expression tomboy has become part of the Miette vocabulary for a particular decorating style; any cake and frosting combination can become a Tomboy." ~Bakerella
