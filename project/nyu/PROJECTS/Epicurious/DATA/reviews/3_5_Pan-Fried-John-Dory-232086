While very simple, this is an excellent recipe and turns out great as is or with your preferred sauce. I used Cusk, a thick deep water fish and was excellent.

everyone is so quick to knock this simple recipe, as if they are above it. well prove your worth. inspire others: sauces that may be worth pairing off the top of my head-balsamic vinegar/dijon mustard sauce, lemon/tarragon/white wine, white wine/fish stock/fresh thyme, fresh fennel with a tarragon/proscuitto vinegrette? explore the possibilities. enjoy. ~Zaza's Cucina~

OK--I also checked out the recipe hoping to find something new. It only confirmed what I already knew--- good ingredients properly combined and prepared is what good cooking is all about!!!

I agree with the cook from Des Moines. It is necessary for there to be recipes for the beginner cook also. Thumbs up!

This is a recipe we have made many times before, still it is very good. You can change it a little bit by adding 1 tbsp. sesame seed to the bread crumbs.

Not everyone is an expert like you guys. Glad Epicurious thinks of us amateurs. This was great!

I'll have to agree with the first reviewer. I checked out the recipe in hopes of finding a new way to prepare fish, but was disappointed at the very common recipe.

Yeah...? Did I miss something? Pan-fried fish is good but I don't see how anyone visiting this site could possibly learn anyting from this recipe... sure I'd make it again as I've made it a 100 times before; big deal.
