I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I thought it was very good. It definitely needs quite a bit of salt and pepper - the recipe doesn't indicate any, and I could see how it would be bland with no salt and pepper. My only issue was more of a presentation thing. Using milk instead of something heavier like cream or half and half causes the soup to look a bit curdled if you let it sit and simmer. Not a huge deal, but?? I will probably make it again. I liked the mace.

I love this soup! I made it exactly to recipe and took it to a party where it got excellent reviews. For me the mace is the highlight of the soup. Yes, it is mild, but so very good!

I have made this soup twice. First time to the recipe and second I added grated turnip and I used fres nutmeg, hot paprika, and a pinch of cardamom. Took it to a party and it was a sure fire it!

This made a thick and creamy soup, but the mace is overpowering, and the cabbage flavor is so subtle it fails to satisfy. The chives and parsley are absolutely necessary to offset the blandness and the mace. I loved the idea, but I won't be making this particular recipe again.

Paired with caraway soda bread and a nice pint, this soup made a perfect St. Patty's day lunch!

Satisfying creamy soup, and so healthy! I used red cabbage, and the soup turned out a lovely violet color that looked very inviting in pale turquoise bowls. I also substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth. I wouldn't increase the mace, since the cabbage flavor is delicate. I might try olive oil instead of butter next time.

My boyfriend asked me to make cabbage soup. I'd never heard of it, but I found this recipe. I carefully read the reviews and decided to practically double the mace, with which I have no experience, and ruined the recipe. We couldn't eat it. The mace overwhelmed it. I love nutmeg, but not mace, at least not in this quantity. Oh well. It's all about learning, plus just another way to make my boyfriend doubt that I truly did attend culinary school. He has strong doubts about why I'm still paying the student loans, and so do I.

Made this soup (twice) for my cooking club and everyone loved it. The first time, I followed the recipe except substituting nutmeg for mace--very good. The second time, I took the advice of some of the other cooks, and increased the chicken broth/milk ratio (2:1 instead of 1:1). I also used mace (doubled the quantity) and it went from very good to excellent--I barely had to add any salt and pepper for taste. Both times I used savoy cabbage, for color and flavor.

I also made this last night as the starter for our Saint Patty's meal. Agree it is a very nice soup, the cabbage is so mild this way it wouldn't offend anyone (so mild my 15 year old spiced it up with a bit of hot sauce). But with lots of fresh chives (that are just beginning to return to my herb bed) it was great. Will try the addition of kale next time for a variation.

Made this for St. Patrick's Day last night. It was very nice and creamy, but the cabbage flavor was not very strong, hence a little bland. Next time I might add some green onions or a little kale, more salt and maybe a little more mace.

Made this recipe for a dinner party and everyone really liked it. Just a nice creamy soup. A very subtle cabbage flavor, one I think even finicky eaters would like. Followed the recipe exactly with no problems.

this was really yummers - however, i would add a lot more onion and a bit more mace than called for. also, if you want it to have a bit more color, throw in some kale before you puree it.

I made a few subtle changes. I increased broth ratio, I added 1-2 tsp of brown sugar when sauteeing the cabbage. I also added red pepper and tarragon at the end. Really yummy!
