Wonderful! Made it Christmas Eve (used whole garlic crusty bread) and baked it for Christmas brunch. Everyone loved it....and asked if we could keep it and have more with dinner!!!

This is devine. My husband said it is the best egg dish he has ever eaten in his fifty years on this planet. I was worried it was going to be too rich or too heavy based on a couple of the other reviews, but it wasn't (and I note that only a couple people said that anyway). I'm not saying it's a health-food (of course not given the ingredients), but the flavors and ratios were very nice and not over the top. I did make a few changes based on suggestions from others and I am glad I did: (1) I used good quality crusty french bread (sourdough) instead of Wonderbread; (2) I used half shitake and half crimini mushrooms instead of all shitake; (3) I only used 4oz of crumbled goat cheese instead of 9oz (Trader Joe's sells it in 4 oz. tubs, by the way). I think using less goat cheese is what kept this dish from otherwise being too rich and heavy. I think it also kept the goat cheese from dominating the other flavors too much. Personally I like goat cheese a lot, but I still think 9oz would have been too much. Plus if serving it for company I think it's safer to use less since some people (like my mother) are not big fans of goat cheese. Even my mother would like this dish the way I made it, though, since the goat cheese was not so in-your-face when using 4oz. One more comment about the bread: a couple other reviewers said they didn't soak the bread since they made the recipe the day before baking it. I don't understand that--what did they do with the milk, omit it or just pour it in and let it all run to the bottom? Either way, that doesn't seem right to me...I would soak the bread like the recipe says to do whether baking the same day or the next day. Just my two cents! Anyway, this recipe is a definite keeper. Enjoy!

I got raves from all my guests. Here are the changes I made: I used multigrain bread; skipped the soaking; added two medium leeks sliced thinly along with the plain white mushrooms I used; cut goat cheese to 4 oz and skipped the fontina (we all thought there was plenty of cheese); and I added an egg because the custard seemed a bit thin. Made it the night before and baked it in the morning before brunch - in a hotter oven than specified because I was also making muffins, but it came out beautifully anyway. I think I did 400 for 40 minutes or so and it was fine - gorgeously browned. Will definitely be making this again.

Yummy, but then again, how can a dish loaded with cheese and cream not be yummy? Although like another reviewer said, I could feel my arteries clogging with every bite. Instead of green onions I sauteed 2 chopped leeks with the mushrooms, and I used leftover focaccia instead of wonder bread. Great comfort food.

Awesome! Though I felt my arteries clogging with every bite. Used crusty bread instead of Wonder Bread. Will make this again for a special occasion breakfast/brunch when I've got a houseful of guests.

Served this for Christmas brunch with the sugar bacon (also from this site)and they were a hit. I used day old foccacia and substituted mozzarella for fontina as that was what I had on hand. Followed all other instructions and didn't end up with soggy bread though I should mention I probably had closer to 9 or 10 cups of bread. Delicious and will definitely make again.

This was absolutely delicious! My guests were excited just from the fabulous aroma while it cooked, and we finished the whole pan by ourselves. I followed instructions exactly but substituted cheeses based on what I had on hand -- herbed goat cheese and a block of gruyere, which turned out to be an excellent combination. Next time I might not soak the bread as it was a bit too spongy for my taste, but this was a very minor complaint.

Love it! I added my own homemade mozzarella cheese, so it was more like 4-cheese http://www.fourgreensteps.com/community/recipes/52/281

This recipe was a home run. I followed others' suggestions and used a crusty, heartier French loaf. I prepped the entire thing the night before so it was a breeze to just bake it on Christmas morning. The three cheeses blended beautifully and everyone raved about this at brunch. I'm passing the recipe along to several friends!

This is very good but only because I took reviewers advice and used less goat cheese and more fontina. I didn't like the little "bursts" of goat cheese but where the cheese was evenly distributed it was great! Next time I will use even less goat cheese. Also, the bread is the key - I used leftover french bread and the result was nicely browned with cubes of bread poking through the surface!

This was only OK. Made it for Christmas morning. I used french bread and loved that, however, the cheeses have a very strong flavor which can overwhelm your mouth a bit. I probably would not make this recipe again but look for a strata with the same type of base (i.e. bread rather than potatoes).

I use english muffins instead of the bread the recipe calls for and diced white onions instead of chives or green onions. I vary the cheeses and add jalapenos and crumbled sausage on occasion. In any form, this has always been a HUGE crowd pleaser!

Excellent and always a huge crowd pleaser. I vary the cheeses and always add a good mixture of exotic mushrooms. Make sure you use a really crusty dense bread. I've also added spinach to this and fresh herbs like basil and rosemary.

This got RAVE reviews. I used a crusty baguette for the bread, mixed whole milk with cream for half and half, and mixed portabellos with the shiitakes. Delicious. Made a great brunch addition and good left over.

This recipe is excellent! I've made it on several occasions, and have always had a request for the recipe. I did follower other reviewer's suggestions and mixed up the mushrooms a bit -- I used some shiitake, some cremini and some white mushrooms. One suggestion...do not use dried (and rehydrated) mushrooms, I did this once, and flavour was no where near as good. I also used a more hearty sourdough type bread, and sauteed the garlic in with the mushrooms, and did not soak the bread, as I make this the night before. Excellent! One last note, I find that this is a very filling dish, and usually serves more than 8 people.

This was very easy to put together but only rated so-so on taste. My parents thought it was good, my boyfriend and I both thought it was a little strongly flavored. Not sure if it was the cheese or what. I might make again, but would tone down some things.

Excellent, Added sausage to the mix, used leftover Italian bread from the freezer and subed buttermilk for the regular milk.

This dish was absolutely fantastic. I only made one modification -- I couldn't get my head around using Wonder bread, so I used a nice rustic Pane Francese from my local bakery. I think it made a huge difference to use a more crusty bread -- I think it would hav been gummy and spongy with sandwich bread. Absolutely delicious, will make again for any brunch occasion!

Wow! This was really good - followed directions, aside from using a heartier Italian bread substituting some regular mushrooms for about 1/3 of the Shitakes, as I didn't have quite enough. Husband absolutely loved it and suggested making this for breakfast for guests on Christmas morning, which I'll definitely do!

I made this dish for a food carry-in at work. Everyone raved about it.

I made this recipe for a large group and it was a major hit! I quadrupled the recipe and made it in 3 half-chafing pans. Each pan was quite full, but it looked very pretty with the chunks of bread poking through the cheese on top. Here are the changes I made: Subbed the shiitakes with button mushrooms. Subbed the Wonder Bread with french bread (I think a major contributor to the final result). Subbed the goat cheese with Colby-Jack (only because I wasn't sure how adventurous the group was). I did not pre-soak the bread because I assembed the strata the night before. This worked out great. After assembling the first pan, I found that the green onions worked better when I added them as their own layer instead of mixing them into the half & half mixture. As another reviewer suggested, I sauted the mushrooms with the garlic instead of adding it to the half & half mixture. The result was a beautiful looking and devine tasting strata! It was very rich and elegant. I can't tell you how many people raved about it. For the next time, I would increase the thyme and Fontina, as they go so well together. The few bites I had when I could taste them specifically were my favorite bites.

This was a great dish for a New Year's Eve breakfast right after midnight. We used button mushrooms but increased the amount, which was nice, but use shitakes if you can afford them. We also switched the bread to french bread which was good, but I will cut the amount of bread in half next time I make it, no matter what kind I use. As mentioned by other reviewers, you can cut the amount of cheese as well, and maybe try a few different kinds for a more unique taste. A very rich breakfast treat!

Yummy and rich! First thing to go at a potluck brunch. A pound of shitakes was too expensive, so I used about 2/3 crimini and 1/3 shitakes, and it was still good.

Rating: 3
Very nice make-ahead dish. I used sourdough french bread. I also sauteed the garlic with the mushrooms along with the bottoms of the green onions. Used crimini mushrooms. This smells great while it's baking.

Whoa, is this rich. Delicious flavor, but next time I think I would cut down on the goat cheese - I found it cloying. I also used plain white button mushrooms instead of (unavailable) shiitakes, with good results.

Absolutely fantastic! Made for guest brunch for Easter. Minor adjustments included: used baby Portabellas, used 1% milk, 1 cup half and half, 1 cup kielbasa, no salt, and 6 eggs - 5 of which were egg substitute. Very, very rich. Very "upscale" tasting. Will try modifications with cheese to make more healthy.

This dish was very tasty. We enjoyed it thoroughly. It is a lot of preparation but well worth the work if you have the time. As a side note, I would add more mushrooms, it isn't a must but would be a nice extra!

I don't know if I would necessarily call this dish EASY, but it wasn't too, too bad. I made it for Christmas morning with tossed salad and banana cake, and everyone loved it, even those who do not usually like goat cheese! Also, I used dried shiitakes & thyme instead. We all liked the "soggy" bread as it seemed like a savory bread pudding. In any case, it was something different and I'm glad I tried it.

It was excellent. Easy and everyone wanted the recipe. It was great as a company dish as I made it the day before. I did not use the thyme and substituted swiss for the goat cheese as I could not find the other but it was still excellent.

I read the complaints about soggy bread and because I didn't have time for my new bread to become stale, I lightly toasted it before cutting it and it was fabulous. Rave reviews. Feeds 8 hungry people...I made it for brunch for 12 and had leftovers. Very rich.

Easy and delicious. Perfect for a casual buffet brunch, as it keeps well in the pan. Will try it again with an egg substitute for my egg-allergic mom.

Tangy and creamy. Served for Sunday brunch to rave reviews from sophisticated eaters. Didn't have Fontina, so used shredded Colby/Monterey Jack instead; added color so it was good. Will try with stale bread next time, as Wonder Bread gets a little soggy when you warm it up (I'm eating for lunch today!)

My husband had picked a lot of wild mushrooms and this seemed just the recipe. However, it was mediocre. The flavor was flat-all butter and cream. I should have imagined the recipe more carefully.I suppose I could try it again and spice it up but I think I'll saute today's chantrelles with cognac and just a touch of butter. I'm sure I can find something to put that mixture on--maybe couscous?
