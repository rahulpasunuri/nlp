Made per the recipe, my logs were longer and created 6 dozen smaller biscotti. I will make them again, probably divided into 2 logs.

Very disappointed with small volume of cookies this recipe made. Two very small logs made very small cookies. Flavor and crunch were good, but I'll try another recipe for ginger biscotti next time

Did I miss something here? Were these supposed to have any butter? I followed instructions as is and they were very crumbly, not sweet enough and terrible texture. I can't figure it out. Beware is all I have to say.

I've been making these biscotti for years now. They're fabulous. I increase the powdered ginger to 1 tablespoon. Oh, so yummy!

Wonderful flavor and easy to make. I used 3/4 c preground almond meal in place of the chopped almonds which seemed to solve the sticky dough problems mentioned by others. I also added 2 t. cinnnamon & 1/4 t. cloves because I love those flavors with ginger. Used a bit different baking times & temp as I make various biscotti recipes and always follow the same process. Put log on cookie tray and bake at 325 for 35 minutes; cool log on cutting board for 10 minutes; slice log with electric knife; put slices upright back on cookie sheet about 1/2" apart and bake at 325 for another 23 minutes. YUM YUM!!

WOW. So delicious. I am a pretty hard core ginger lover so I thought this would work for me but not my husband... I was wrong! The ginger really mellows after cooking. I chopped the crystalized ginger in the food processor with a spoonful of flour to keep it from sticking, (thanks cook from Eugene!) and I misted the loaf with water after the cooling period so it sliced without crumbling. No way did I hit the 1/8th inch mark, more like 1/4th to 1/2 inch for mine. But oh so tasty! I know what I'm making for Christmas gifts next year!

These are delish. I love biscotti and always enjoy new flavors. The only change I made was using slivered almonds (what I had on hand) with no skins. Love the ginger flavor and the crunch of the nuts. Great with a cup of tea.

I enjoyed this recipe so much that I used the base for some other biscotti creations. I just replaced the ginger with dried cherries, subbed walnuts for the almonds and added some chopped chocolate. I slcied thinner this time and they turned out wonderfully! I am so excited about the possibilities of this recipe... I will be drinking more coffee this winter!

This was a wonderful recipe. Very nutty and gingery! I doubled it and made it free form on the Silpat. I think I will try to slice it thinner next time as they were very hard. But that is how biscotti is supposed to be? Yum!

Rating: 3
Great recipe; I also did not think the amount of ginger excessive. I would recommend waiting until the loaf of biscotti cools entirely prior to slicing; will slice more thinly, and with less of a chance of crumbling. I would also flip the biscotti over about 10 minutes into the second bake.

Excellent! I also "free formed" the loaf.

I used chocolate chips instead of cystallized ginger because I didn't have any, but I still thought the recipe was good! The cookies had a good crunch to them. Be careful not to leave them out, because they will get soft within a day.

Oh man. So, so good. I added fresh grated ginger and used almond instead of vanilla extract, as well as slightly less sugar and slightly more flour, and have not been able to stop eating them. The dough is a bit sticky and, I'll be honest, this is one of the stranger biscotti recipes I've used, but it makes a mean, crunchy, light, DELICIOUS little cookie. Gingery goodness.

Ok recipe, but too much ginger for me. You must be a ginger lover for these.

Rating: 3
Great recipe-easy and very flavorful. I made it according to the recipe, except for baking it in a free-form loaf on my Silpat. Also used my food processor to cut up the ginger-just added a tablespoon of the flour to keep it from sticking to the blades, and that worked well. Yum!

These are great low-fat biscotti. I actually added more powdered and crystallized ginger than the recipe called for, and it wasn't too much for this ginger-lover.

I found this a very tasty recipe...and the friends I shared it with did too! I can't imagine slicing the biscotti 1/8 of an inch thick, though? Mine were more like 1/2 inch.

I substituted about 3/4 cup whole-wheat flour, which worked out just fine. Great flavor and easy to cut.

this recipe is awsome, and now a part of my permanent collection. I've made it twice in 2 days. I like to form the dough on a parchment lined cookie sheet rather than a loaf pan. I glob the dough down in a line and use wet hands to shape it like others have suggested.

Rating: 4
This is really really good. Quite simply, if you like ginger, make it. I quintupled the recipe the last time I made it so that I could take lots to work as well. I did find that the sugar can be slightly reduced without any ill effects. I'm even thinking about adding a little fresh ginger the next time too.

This biscotti is wonderful! As other reviewers have stated, I was a bit concerned when I read only one cup of flour (I think I actually used about 1 1/4 cups) to all the rest of the ingredients. It worked beautifully though, I wouldn't change a thing.

Wonderful flavor combination and great texture. For a low-fat dessert, I served the biscotti with a sauterne dessert wine. They tasted wonderful dunked in the wine!

A cook from Nanaimo, B.C. This is a great biscotti recipe. The only problem is, I have to keep making it as my husband wants it everday with his cappacino. I just form it on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. It's a little sticky to work with, but I just flour my hand. We love the amount of ginger.

Rating: 4
With the exception of the ginger, these are very much like the Almondina sold at gourmet stores for a small fortune. They were awesome. When I made the recipe I thought y'all were nuts - 1 cup of flour to all those almonds and ginger?!! It was a VERY sticky small amount of dough, but it turned out wonderfully. I'll definitely make these again.

Delicious recipe. I had to change it a bit to accomodate high altitude (9,000'): 325 degree oven and about 1/3 c. of milk. Oh, and I dusted the top with cinnamon. Great!

Rating: 3
I wimped out and omitted the powdered ginger, but I think I will put it in next time--the crystallized ginger really does mellow out. I agree that if you don't love ginger you should make another biscotti. The use of a loaf pan is a great technique if you don't have your heart set on a crescent shape. I didn't line it with wax paper and I was sorry--the loaf tore when I turned it out.

Just took the first batch from the oven -- fanstastic! I added a bit more flour to stiffen the dough slightly so I could shape a log on the baking sheet, and they turned out wonderful. They could use slightly more ginger (perhaps because of the increased flour.)

This is a wonderfully easy recipe to make. I buy crystallized ginger in bulk from an Asian market. It is very easy to cut up because it is not sticky. I can't understand why anyone who is not a fan of ginger would even attempt this recipe. There are plenty of other biscotti recipes that can be made, without altering this one. It is perfect the way it is and was an instantaneous hit with my family - who by the way, all love ginger. Making it in a loaf pan is a wonderful idea, and helps to slice it almost to 1/8th inch thickness. My Wussthoff serrated knife was able to cut it to 3/16th of an inch! This recipe will remain inj my permanent collection.

These were some of the best biscotti I've ever made. The candied ginger kept them moist. I served with canteloupe gelato--everyone loved it all.

Love these! Rave reviews. Perfect after dinner sweet without being heavy. Tips- lightly dust the ginger with flour and it won't stick to your knife. Also, chill dough for about an hour and they will form a nice roll without the need for baking in the pan.

The ginger taste is delightful! The textures are melding flavors are delicious! I've made this recipe 7 times in the last 3 months.

As a ginger lover, I thought the amounts of ground and candied ginger were just right. I, too, agree that it's impossible to slice them 1/8" thick and the dough is extremely sticky, but the results are divine. If you like ginger, this is your biscotti recipe.

Thanks to all the previous reviewers -- the advice to cut the powdered ginger to 1/4 tsp was perfect, as was the suggestion that slcing them 1/8" was near impossible. these were delicious and light and refreshing -- great to end a heavy meal.

delicious,good for you,& easy to make! I had people at work asking for the recipe-everyone though it was a winner!

Rating: 1
I followed the recipe exactly, and thought it was awful. Candied ginger is very hard to chop, and despite my best efforts I ended up with pieces larger than I would have liked. They, combined with the powdered ginger (which I recommend reducing or leaving out altogether) made for a gingery-to-the-point-of-disgust biscotti with a distinctly odd texture. Yuck. Try the cranberry and white chocolate biscotti instead.

these were great biscotti. my changes are as follows: i left out the powdered ginger, used a combination of almonds and brazil nuts (they're a great addition), and added a bit of almond extract.

Wow -- these are the best biscotti I've had. The ginger adds a really satisfying tang, making it not too sweet -- just right. I added craisins (dried cranberries), which gave it a bit of moisture and lovely bits of color; I highly recommend this addition. These were pretty as well as tasty -- I've gotten rave reviews from everyone I gave them to.

The amounts of ginger were just fine. I think those reviewers that thought it was too much should not make a ginger biscotti. The candied ginger was especially tasty - little chewy morsels in the cookie. make sure you toast the almonds. yum.

Turn me off ginger for the rest of my life? No way, it wasn't that bad! Delicious treat.

Good enough, not great. Although another cook said the ginger was too much it seemed not enough in the three times I tried so we should trade ginger sources. The recipe is easy and can be made ahead which is why I said I would make it again but probably I will try gingersnaps instead.

Wonderful biscotti--I decreased powdered ginger to about 1/2 or 3/4 of a teaspoon--the flavor was not at all overpowering, and the candied ginger stood out more pleasantly.

This recipe is excellent. I have made it many many times over the last two years and I always get rave reviews from my friends and family.

There's something wrong with the recipe. The ginger in it will turn you against ginger for the rest of your life. It is postively gross. I made it again and omitted the ginger, added mini-chocolate chips and macadamian nuts and it was "ok". I've made better biscotti.

Vey easy recipe to follow. Came out perfect the first time. Ginger was little too strong, but everyone liked it anyway.

Excellent, quick and easy. Can't count how many times I've given the recipe out. Cutting to 1/8" is challenging, but 1/4" works just fine. The last time I made it I substitued 1/2 the flour with spelt flour and it wasn't altered significantly.

Can someone please explain to me where we went wrong? I followed the recipe to the 't'. Half a cup of crystallized ginger for 1 cup of flour???? There must be some mistake. Our batch came out inedible.

this biscotti is VERY tasty - the recipe is very easy and the combination of ginger and toasted almonds is a paradise for the palate. it is a little unrealistic to slice 1/8" sections - i would recommend 1/4".
