I don't know what is with this whack job from suffolk VA (see the turkey meatloaf and Gordon's pot roast reviews) but this was absolutely wonderful. We served it at my daughter's birthday party and it was a huge hit. Then banana chips are way fun and we added toasted pecans, too.

Yuck'ums The idea is good but the banana chips are not Not even if you were trying to be original or impress your guests with something new This dessert is not for the faint at heart it is quite rich If you make this recipe and I hope you wont invest in a good dental plan
