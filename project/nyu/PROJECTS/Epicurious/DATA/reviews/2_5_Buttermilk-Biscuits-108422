I've made this recipe a couple of times and think the proportion of ingredients is actually better than the original Blackberry Farm recipe. These biscuits are some of the best I've tasted - they're flaky and tender inside, but maintain integrity and don't crumble. Only biscuits I make now.

conscious of the previous reviewer's comment, i was very careful not to overwork the dough, barely kneading it and going almost straight to the folding. i found that they rose adequately, and the flakiness was outstanding. next time, i will probably try a little more baking soda to see if i can get it to rise more. i might also try an egg glaze for more browning.

I loved the idea of the puff-pastry-like-layered concept for these biscuits, but the pressing out and folding process is repeated so many times that it's virtually impossible to keep from overworking the dough, even when using a very light touch and working very carefully. The final end result was a biscuit with pretty good flavor, but they were a bit heavy and tough, no doubt as a result of the inevitable overhandling. The novelty of the layered affect isn't worth sacrificing that wonderfully light and delicate texture that is so wonderful with many of the other biscuit recipes on this site. I won't bother to make them again.
