My wife and I definitely enjoyed this soup, but it wasn't as exciting as I expected. It wasn't bland by any means, but I guess I expected more. I was surprised how much the cheese overwhelmed the port and I used more port than the recipe called for. If I were to make it again again, I would take that into account for sure. Overall it is a nice soup for those days when the weather starts getting a little colder.

This was more like vegetable and potato soup with some cheese thrown in. Reading the other comments in advance, I used Yukon gold potatoes and thus avoided graininess. In the end, though, the soup tasted like an odd version of "twice baked potatoes." I was looking for a soup that showcased the stilton.

I thought this was a nice twist on an old standby. Made it with leeks and potatoes from my garden, subbed Danish blue cheese for the stilton. I must say I don't understand this penchant for russet potatoes in soup, when boiling potatoes have a much better texture. I used Carolas and the texture was perfect.

I was kind of afraid to make this but it turned out wonderfully. I used probably more leek than it called for (two large ones with the light green part). I didn't have half-and-half so I used a small can (5 oz) of evap and about 1/2 c of lowfat sour cream. I used 4 oz. of gorgonzola - I think any more would have been too strong. As it was, it was edible and cheesy. My kids even ate it (they don't like blue cheese). I didn't have Tawny Port and so left it out. I also didn't have chives (they just froze). It took a lot longer for the potatoes to get tender, I think because I used homegrown ones. About 15 minutes longer. I will be making this again to use up a bounty of homegrown leeks.

Stilton is simply too good (and too expensive) to be wasted in what ultimately takes like grainy potato soup. Put it to better use in another dish - or better still - alone with a nice glass of that port.

This soup is rich but I found the texture boring. I'm not sure what the solution would be, but I can find better ways to use Stilton and port.

Made this for a small dinner party and everyone loved it. There were arguements over who got to take home the leftovers!

i realy enjoyed this soup, but I would caution that if your guests expect potato soup the flavor may be a little complex

We loved this soup, and added a few dashes of Tobasco for a bit of extra flavor!

This soup is awesome. I took the suggestion of another cook/reviewer and used Yukon Gold potatoes. I also diced some potatoes with the skin on, cooked them separately and added them after the cheese was incorporated for a little chunkiness. I used the potato water to thin the soup a bit and for extra flavor. The color is gorgeous and the flavor and aroma most appealing. We had it as a main course accompanied by a green salad with a red wine vinegar dressing and sourdough french bread sliced in half, spread with butter and paremsan cheese and toasted under the broiler. A perfect cold Autumn night dinner. In fact, we had it two nights in a row my family was so pleased!

The flavor of the soup was good but the texture was grainy.

Wow! This is a superb soup. Substituted skim evaporated milk for the half & half with no ill effect. Also froze the mixture (without cheese and port) for two weeks and it reheated well.

This was a very aromatic and tasty soup. A special start to a meal. Very smooth.

My family and I really enjoyed this soup. The melding of the flavors of leek, cheese, and port were a very nice experience. I used Yukon Gold potatoes instead of the Russet---a personal preference.
