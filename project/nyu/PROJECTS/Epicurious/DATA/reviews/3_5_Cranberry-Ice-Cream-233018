Wonderful flavor and color. Agree that it's too rich; half milk, half cream and 5 yolks was better. Sauce: Cook cranberries in the microwave about 12 minutes; perfect consistency and it won't scorch.

I would have to say that this recipe is pretty advanced and, as others have said, could have benefited from additional detail about cranberry cooking and custard making. Luckily I've got a bit of a professional background, so here are some observations: 1) cinnamon: I first steeped the cinnamon stick in the heated cream mixture, then I rinsed it and also used it in the cranberry mixture. This seemed to up the flavor quotient quite a bit; 2) the time it takes to cook the custard base will depend to some degree on how much heat you use. It's better to look for the necessary texture than watch the clock; 3) if you rinse the cranberries and only just barely drain them, when you put them directly in the pot for cooking the residual water will help protect against scorching. Lovely flavor, and given the specialty nature of it, I won't make it often, but it's nice to have in the arsenal. I served it for Thanksgiving with the gingerbread angel cookie recipe, only I used that dough to make cookie bowls and then served the ice cream inside.

I think I found a way to address some of the problems mentioned here. The Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream and Dessert book has a sweet cream base with fewer eggs and a mix of milk and cream. The custard isn't cooked. Good: quicker and no fussing with cooking methods. Bad: raw eggs. I've been making this base for years, though, and have never had a problem. My iced cream turned out great--I'd definitely make it again.

I just made this last night. I love the flavor but it came out more like soft serve than ice cream. I think this was for 2 reasons. First, I think the recipe calls for too many egg yolks. Next time I will use less. Also, I have the cuisinart ice cream maker and this receipe made a little too much for the freezer thing which may have affected the churning. However, I may have not let the mixture cool enough before beginning to churn it. I also did not use a cinnamon stick I just sprinkled some powder in and couldn't taste it really. I also subbed brown sugar for most of the white sugar.

Would I make this again? I don't think so. It got rave reviews from my guests, but with all that cream, it was just too rich for my liking. If I did make it again, I think I'd go half cream, half milk. The flavor is good. I didn't use cinnamon, but added Grand Marnier to the berries and dark chocolate chips at the end of the churning.

This was great and different ice cream! I realized I had some cranberries left over in the freezer from the holidays, found this recipe, and decided why not? It was easy and tasty. Thanks to previous comments, I added the cinnamon stick as well as some freshly grated cinnamon and appreciated having the cinnamon/cranberry combo. Also, I didn't strain out the solids which I thought made the ice cream more exciting, as some bites contained cranberry skins. Yummy! While I wouldn't necessarily make this ice cream again, I would recommend it for those who have some cranberries lying around and are looking for a simple, tasty, and refreshing dessert.

Best Ice Cream Recipe ever

The color and texture of this ice cream were great, and I even splashed a little water in with the cranberries because my sugar was burning. It had a mild cranberry flavor and I did not taste any hint of cinnamon at all. It was a lot of work for the final product. I think my kids summed it up when they said... "it tastes like whipped cream!" Nothing extraordinary, so I probably will not do again. It did help however to throw some crystalized ginger on top when I served it, so I can see how it would be good served over something like gingerbread.

I forgot to say - it is weird that there's no liquid in the cranberry boiling stage - I dumped a splash of grand marnier in and it didin't affect the final texture at all. It sure did taste good, though! And it kept the sugar from burning before boiling, as another reviewer warned.

It was delicious, and I made it without milk, just cream. Bright, clean, intense flavor - really, just fantastic. We loved it - I served it over gingerbread.

Just a commentary. I have not made this ice cream, but when I do, I'll put in some whole milk. Using 100% heavy cream would leave a very greasy mouth feel, which is why almost all ice cream makers use milk as well. Just a word to the wise. I'll use at least one half milk.

Made this for the 1st time tonight, and it's setting up in the freezer, so I haven't tasted the finished product yet, but it tasted great before it went into the freezer. I have to comment on the recipe itself, though. There are a few things you should know before you make this: 1) although the recipe is VERY specific about how to know when the yolks are beaten enough, it's extremely vague about how long the custard should cook (while you're stirring it continuously). It took a long time for the custard to come to 170 degrees. 2) keep an eye on the cranberries when. By the time the sugar melts enough to have any liquid to actually come to a boil, you run the risk of burning it. 3) The recipe recommends putting the cranberries in a 2 qt. saucepan. I used a 2 1/2 qt. saucepan and could barely avoid spilling the sugar and cranberries on the stovetop. Next time I'll use a bigger pot. 4) As far as I can tell the cinnamon stick didn't add any flavor. If you want to put it in, go ahead, but next time I'll see if there's any difference without it. But do make this dish. It's a pretty color and it tastes fabulous!

This was an excellent recipe. I generally save making ice cream for summer, but when I saw I had two frozen bags of cranberries in the freezer, I had to try it. It's delicious! I will definitely make this again- perhaps as part of a Thanksgiving or Christmas feast.
