Love this recipe! I've made it with hanger steak, but also NY strip and ribeye. I've even made it with chicken and subbed white wine. Fast and delicious!

This is such a solid recipe. Delicious and relatively easy. I don't usually prepare hangar steak, but I probably will more often thanks to this recipe. I'm sure it's great with other steaks as well.

This recipe is ridiculously good. Restaurant caliber. I didn't even go through all the steps they suggest. I literally just threw all the ingredients in a saute pan, cooked it down, and poured it over a filet mignon. Really easy, quick, and unquestioningly superb.

I am willing to try this one more time since I've done it once and it turned out amazing. I had leftovers, and the sauce when it cools down shows the amount of grease in this dish that it's not so visible when it's fresh. It's not good as left overs doesn't taste the same... do the amount for one meal. It's fantastic!

We substituted t-bone for the hanger steak, I used oregano and basil instead of rosemary and tarragon, and green beans instead of mushrooms, and it was good! just kidding. We followed the recipe and it was perfect. Absolutely will make again, changing nothing other than us being more aggressive with the redux so the meat doesn't get cold. Fantastic dish.

So amazing! The sauce would great on any steak/ roast.

The beef was excellent but the sauce was lacking. It wasn't strong enough to stand up to the flavor of the beef. If I was going to do it again, I would use a zinfindel, which might make a better flavor.

I will definitely make this again!! It was so good and incredibly easy. I used skirt steak instead of hanger steak because that is what Whole Foods had on hand. The hubby really enjoyed it. This is company worthy.

We really enjoyed this dish. I used baby bellas and shitakes for the mushroons.Had small yellow potatoes as a side and they tasted great dipped in the gravy. However,in my neck of the woods, skirt steak is very expensive and next time I will try the flank steak as an alternative.

An easy, delicious dinner my husband and I both enjoyed. Wonderful with a simple salad on the side.

* very tasty * the beef spends a lot of time away from the heat while the sauce is prepared... recommend bringing back to the heat to really warm it up good before serving

I subsituted flap meat for the hanger steak and even saved a step in not having to pound the hanger steak to 1/2" since the flap meat was already thin and plenty of marbelization in the meat! This was easy to make with little prep just cooking at the end. It was excellent!

hanger steak (skirt steak) is nor similar to flank steak. it has more fat making it more tender and flavorful. best price at costco.

Rating: 0
It differs from flank steak by the flecks of fat marbeled thru it. It doesn't require being tenderized like flank steak.

Hanger Steak on the West Coast is called Skirt Steak or Sirloin Skirt Steak. It comes from the edges of a Tri Tip and has a good marbeling of fat. Excellent flavor! Great on the BBQ cooked quickly. Costco has it at the best price. My Personal favorite next to a Ribeye.

Hanger Steak is similar to flank steak in taste and texture, but more expensive. Chef Rich

This was the first time I had ever made hanger steak. The steak was tender and delicious and the mushroom-wine sauce was excellent. I did substitute shallots for the garlic because we're not garlic fans and skipped the tarragon. If you like tarragon, feel free to use it, but we loved it without. I also didn't bother straining the sauce as we don't mind the pieces of shallot. The entire family thought it was a keeper!

This was so simple, and tasted amazing! I will certainly be adding this to the go-to list! To the reviewer rebeckahtx...I think the recipe called for one, one and a half pound steak, not an eleven and a half pounder...they should have put a dash in I guess :)haha!

Would somebody tell me what is a hanger steak? Recipe sounds great i sure want to try it.

Super quick for the flavor payoff; this is a keeper. For the reveiw of the size of meat it is meant to read as is but does look odd. It is One 1&1/2 lb. steak.

Rating: 0
well a 111/2 pound hanger steak would feed a lot more than 4 people. I hope it is a typo and should be a 1 1/2 lb steak
