I have made this recipe a few times and it is always a hit. I love them!

Made this recipe last night, and the rice didn't cook! Left it simmering for ages, added more water, but the water didn't seem to reach the rice where it was packed tightly inside the vine leaves. Next time I'll cook the rice separately, and then bake the dish in a little lemon juice. Also, I won't add salt because the vine leaves are so salty, the dolmades now taste too salty. Oh, I also added lentils (I cooked these first), and they were an excellent addition.

Made this as one of a few entrees at a vegan-friendly meal (obviously without the dip). Successful with the vegans; not so successful with the rest of my family. Would make a nice carb accompanying a Greek- themed dinner

I made these for an appetizer at a dinner party and they seemed to be very well- received. I thought the filling had a wonderful taste, but I followed the directions exactly and I felt that the rice was slightly overcooked for my taste. I think that I will use either less liquid or less cooking time the next time I try these (probably both). Other than that, I thought they were great! I'm still giving them four forks because they were so tasty.

This recipe is a regular at parites or football games. I skip the dipping sauce, and serve with tzatziki. Killer.

I thought these were excellent. I've never even had stuffed grape leaves, let alone made them, so I'm surprised they worked out. I used a large pot instead of a dutch oven, and it worked fine. I also realized belatedly that I only had crushed tomatoes, but those were fine too. I added some chardonnay to the cooking water. AND, I left out the mint because I don't care for it, AND, I forgot to put the dill in the filling, so I put some in the sauce instead. Yum! They're so good. How much fiber do grape leaves have? Hopefully not excessive amounts, because I just ate five of them!

I made these a couple of months ago for a Passover seder. Every single person in the room told me they were the best dolmades they'd ever had. I couldn't find fresh dill so left it out (I live in the Congo so substitutions are a way of life!) - it wasn't missed. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I too wasn't a huge fan of the sauce - while the feta/yogurt base is good, seems to be lacking something. Next time I'll try adding a bit of garlic or something else with a bit of zip.

I grew up on dolmades made only with ground lamb. I thought I give this recipe a try for a large cocktail party. They were such a hit. I was even asked to teach a class on how to prepare them. Dolmades are so light and flavorful. Wasn't too fond of the sauce however.

I have made this over and over again. Family and friends love it. It is a regular item on our Easter menu. I follow the recipe to the letter.

Truly a hit. Discovery that I can make such great tasting "vegetarian" dolmades w/o cooked ground lamb usually included. Also surprised that pine nuts and tomatoes do not much change the basic taste of this Greek classic. I used mixture of wild rice and white rice, which works great for the flavors, plus various diets.

Made this dish with two other dolmades (another vegitarian and one with lamb) and this was unique in that it had the addition of tomatos. It can be made with a pot rather than dutch oven if you line the bottom of the pot with grape leaves so that they are carmalized rather than your stuffed leaves and if you use an oven safe plate to wiegh down the dolmades while they cook. Add enough water to almost cover the dolmades and bring to a boil. Lower heat and allow to simmer for 30 mins. or until most of the water is absobed. Remove from pot and serve chilled. Although iI have made the dish once, I would not reccomend the use of lemon juice in the cooking/steaming process as it made the dolmades really bitter (the yogert/feta dip cut the acidity conciderably) and the use of water or white wine will be tried next.

A delectable treat! What a fabulous recipe! It's extremely easy but rather time-consuming. One error in the text: it calls for two 2 lb. jars of grape leaves. I used one and still had almost 2/3 left over. Raves from all at the party.

I made these for a Greek dinner party with friends, and it was easy and delicious. I thought I had over-catered - but they all went!! I didn't made the yoghurt dip - but it sounds delicious too.

The stuffed grape leaves were out of this world but I really didn't like the yogurt-feta dip -- too tangy and salty. Maybe next time I'll make a yogurt-cucumber dip with it.

Yummy! The dolmades came out simply tasty. Cooking time, though, took about 10-15 minutes longer, till the rice was fully cooked. The yogurt-feta dip was especially good, and I used it for other stuff, too. Try substituting the Feta cheese with salty Bulgarian - still comes out great. All in all - a really good summer food.

This is a very interesting dolmades with the pine nuts. My husband thought it needed more seasoning. The dip was good. If you care to take the time to make these, I would add oregano.
