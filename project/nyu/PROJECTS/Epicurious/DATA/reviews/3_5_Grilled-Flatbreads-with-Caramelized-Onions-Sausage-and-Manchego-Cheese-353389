I started with a pre-made crust from a company that does flat bread. Company is called Fabulous Flats. Grilled as directed but used and indoor grill pan. Did everything a head of time, as recipe suggests and added chopped arugula before popping into oven for 12 min. after guests arrived. Had rave reviews and requests for this. Make sure to stick with the Manchego cheese.

Wow. I've been dying to try this. I made my own flatbread (Indian--no yeast, with yogurt), which I feel made a big difference. Great appetizer. We actually had it for dinner. You can make everything ahead of time and reheat on the grill. This will be served as an appetizer. A keeper.

The big hit of the party. Used pre-baked pizza dough and put them in the oven until everything melted. Excellent appetizer. Will certainly make again!!

Suprise, suprise, my husband loved this. The sausage on hand turned out to be hot and he is not a fan of spicy. With the market 11 miles away, I used the hot sausage. Flavor was wonderful.

Really good. We made it with manchego but I think other kinds of cheese would be good too with the sausage and onions. Great with some wine.

I thought that the vinegar flavor overpowered the onions and sausage. If I were to make again, i'd probably just saute the onion in olive oil until soft and mix them with the sausage and some fresh herbs.

Quick and easy but very tasty. Used purchased flatbread, crisped in oven before topping.

Tasty. Used purchased flatbread for dough and would definitely take that route again.

Grilling pizza is a great alternative in Summer..keep the heat out of the house. Mozzarella is nothing like Manchego Cheese. Manchego cheese is the most important and well-known sheeps milk cheese in Spain with an intense taste and crumbly texture. It ranges from mild to sharp, depending on how long it is aged. It takes well to grilling and baking, although it will not fully melt like some cow's milk cheeses do. If you can not find it try a richer goats milk cheese with more body than mozzarella. Most of the Gourmet Food Stores in the US carry some or most of the best Spanish Cheeses.

This was a super easy. I added an assortment of mushrooms and some fresh thyme. A wonderful snack to have on the patio with a glass of wine!

Great appetizer or meal with a small salad. Manchego cheese is not available where I live and no one I know has ever heard of it. We ubstituted with buffalo mozzarella.

We used mozzarella instead of Manchego and it was still quite tasty. Cut into small pieces, it made a great appetizer.

Simply Amazing! The onion, cheese and sausage combo is perfect. Don't change a thing. We baked the pizza using pre-made dough. Made it again a couple of days later.
