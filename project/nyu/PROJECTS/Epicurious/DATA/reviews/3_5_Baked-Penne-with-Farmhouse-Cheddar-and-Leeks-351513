This is a great grown-up mac'n'cheese. I've made it twice, and most recently served it as a side dish at Christmas Dinner and it was really well received, there wasn't a bit left at the end. Don't go light on the leeks, they are what makes this delicious. I had more luck with a yellowy cheddar as well.

I'm not generally a fan of creamy pasta dishes, but needed a baked dish to take to a gathering, and had everything available, so I made it. All I can say is YUM! I followed the recipe to the letter except I took the advice of some other reviewers and added some cubed pancetta in with the sauce, and topped with Panko. Superb! The flavor of the leeks is sweet and creamy and delicious. Obscene with a nice glass of red. Very rich, to be certain, but worth a try. Will definitely make again. And again.

Excellent recipe! I halved it, with 3 leeks, 1 shallot and 2 eggs. I used equal parts 6-year aged cheddar, Musser cheddar from Iowa, and Gruyere cheese. The mustard we had on hand was dijon with capers and tarragon - when I test-tasted this was way too sweet, so I added balsamic vinegar, which balanced it. For the hot sauce I used equal parts Valentina salsa picante (very flavorful) and Sriracha (very hot!). I baked it topped with a sprinkling of Panko bread crumbs, a bit of each cheese grated on top, plus a tiny bit of Italian truffle cheese to add an extra bit of flavor to the top crust. We paired it with a Pinot Noir from Bergstrom, Cumberland Reserve. This dish made a wonderful Sunday supper on a cold, snowy night in late March.

Made this tonight and followed the recipe except I topped it with a little panko and broiled it for a couple minutes at the end. One of the best baked pastas I've had. It was super easy to make and everyone loved it.

Great Mac-N-Cheese dish! We used lowfat milk and put panko breadcrumbs on top and it turned out great!

This recipe is so good I have made it a permanent fixture in my family cookbook. The leeks add a sweet flavor to this rich pasta and lightens it a bit, too. I seldom find a recipe that I find to be too perfect to change, but I prepare this one to the letter. I don't sweat the tempering of the eggs; I just wield a whisk with zest while adding the cheese mixture to the eggs, a little at a time.

This is good, but very rich, so I wouldn't make it too often but I would definitely make it again. I followed the recipe exactly but sprinkled parmesan cheese on top, and it was delicious!

I really enjoyed this, but I feel like the flavors muddled together a bit because the cheese and leeks are both so mild and rich. Next time I'd add some lemon juice to the sauce for a bit of "pop" and brightness. Otherwise, a delicious and elegant variation on mac and cheese.

This recipe is fantastic. We devoured the whole dish. I ended up halving it since it was just for 2. I also didn't have pepper sauce or dijon mustard, so I substituted with Thai sweet chili sauce and spicy brown mustard. I also added a bit of parmesan and cornstarch. It still turned out quite well!

This was a well received mac and cheese recipe. I used skim milk, and egg yolks, since I had them left in the fridge.

Good not great. Maybe it's because I usually make my mac and cheese with extra sharp cheddar and not mild cheeses, but this essentially tasted like a plain mac and cheese with sauteed leeks dumped in it. It was good enough but not worth a repeat.

I really like this, though it wasn't exactly clear how they expected us to temper the eggs. I added fresh oregano when the leeks were almost done, then salt and pepper before I put it in the oven. Delicious.

Excellent! I followed the advice of others and allowed extra time for the cheese sauce to cool before adding to the eggs. I used a reduced fat irish cheddar and 2tsp of hot honey mustard instead of the dijon and hot sauce. I decreased the amount of leaks to about a cup. I couldnt resist putting bread crumbs + grated pecorino on top. It was amazing!

I'm a huge mac & cheese fan and LOVED this variation and will definately make it again. For the novice, make sure the eggs are at room temperature and SLOWLY whisk in the cup of cream sauce and you won't end up with scrambled eggs. You can also let the cheese sauce cool a bit before whisking into eggs. Definately worth the effort.

I made this as written the other night and loved it. It made six generous portions. I'm going to try the suggestion of adding a bit of prosciutto or some other salty meat.

This is a wonderful recipe. A little different with the leeks. I wasn't sure how the kids would react but they loved it. I would and will deffinately make this again.

I made this the other night. No problem with curdled eggs. It was really great. Only problem is I could have fed an army! I should have halved the recipe. But, it reheats in the microwave really well. I have been sending it off in portions for lunches.

I cut the recipe in half and used whole wheat penne. I rounded up the number of leeks to three and thought that all of the flavors blended perfectly. The sauce had no texture issues at all. I do confess to tossing some whole wheat bread crumbs on top, I could't help it. Whole Foods Market often has the exact cheese mentioned, but I couldn't find it the day I made this. I look forward to making it again, with that farmhouse cheese.

Enjoyed as written, however, I now use Louisianna Hot Sauce and 5 to 7 drops of Worchestershire Sauce. (pronounced worstersure sauce)

This was a great mac n' cheese! The leeks and the farmhouse cheddar (I used an Irish cheddar, since that was what I could find at the market and it said it was farmhouse style and very sharp) really made the dish feel more sophisticated than your average mac n' cheese. I followed the recipe exactly, and did not find the end result curdled in any way, but I was very careful to bring the eggs to room temp first and make sure the cheese sauce had cooled a bit before mixing together. It looked beautiful and tasted even better, will make again for sure.

This receipe was very good but very rich. I lightened it a little by using reduced fat sharp cheddar, fat free milk and eggbeaters instead of real eggs. I also used whole wheat penne pasta - one 14.5 oz box rather than a full pound. Then, I probably defeated my slight lightening attempts by topping it with some crumbled bacon. I didn't have any problems with the texture that some have noted - you do want to be careful when adding the hot cheese- leak mixture to the eggs. Wonderful side dish - I love the addition of leeks as I find regular mac and cheese a little boring, even as comfort food.

Made this for a potluck and got a wonderful response! The sauce was a bit curdled as previous reviewers said, but this did not impact the taste nor deter people from trying it/getting seconds. I salted and peppered the sauce to taste and added an extra 8 oz shredded cheese layer on the top before baking. For the sauce I put in a squeeze of wasabi since I only had sweet mustard. Replaced the hot sauce with a tablespoon of red chili pepper flakes. The addition of leeks is an inspiration to this "mac & cheese" dish. Delicious!

If you don't want your dish to be lumpy, simply omit the eggs. Eggs coagulate at around 140 degrees... baking at 400 for 30 minutes brings the internal temperature way above 140, basically scrambling the eggs. Aged cheddar will also contribute to a less than smooth consistency. Try using half as much aged cheddar, for flavor, and make up the other half with a much smoother melting, higher moisture cheese, like fontina.

I am also from the Southern Style macaroni and cheese Group. The smooth saucy style reminds me of cafeteria food. My family recipe is macaroni, cheese, salt, pepper and milk period; cooked until the top forms a layer of brown crusty cheese. The sharper the cheese, the better the flavor. The addition of leeks, hot sauce and mustard is wonderful. I liked the idea of prosciutto the Toronto poster used. The variations on mac & cheese are endless.

I saw this recipe in Bon Appetit and came on to look at the reviews before making it. I notice that many people have been concerned with the texture, the texture simply comes from using very sharp cheese. As cheddar cheese is aged it looses its smooth melting qualities. It becomes more dense, and crumbly which is why it separates when it melts, the cheese has a lower water content so there is less insulation to keep the fat from melting out. This is why you end up with a bit of greasiness, and the cheese solids giving it that "curdled" texture. So its nothing wrong with any of the techniques you are using, its just the cheese. The recipe is choosing flavor over texture, if you would like smoother texture, use a younger less sharp cheese.

I am bookmarking this for future use, but wanted to note for other cooks who might think their mac turns out a disaster if they don't follow the recipe instructions 100%... as a Southerner who grew up on old-fashioned, Southern-style mac and cheese, it is supposed to be "curdly" rather than "creamy"! I'm interested to try the technique here, but I've never tempered eggs in any other versions of this dish. (Paula Deen's "The Lady's Mac & Cheese" comes to mind.) The Southern mac that I grew up on holds together with lumps of egg and cheese and other gooey goodness, and it bakes up with a crispy brown top (not bread crumbs!); it's also not saucy like the blue box stuff or fancier versions thereof. May not be to some people's taste, but that doesn't make it wrong. :-)

I saw this recipe in Bon Appetit and was intrigued by the idea of making a custard for the mac and cheese. I bought the ingredients and was ready to make it to take to a pot luck. THEN...I read the reviews that talked about the custard curdling, even when the eggs were properly tempered. I got a bit nervous, knowing that there was a Southern raised mac and cheese lover at the pot luck. So, I went back to the tried and true roux method instead of making the custard. SO..all I can comment on here is the flavors of the leeks and sharp cheddar together, which were wonderful. I used the mustard and hot sauce as written in the recipe. Take my review with a grain of salt since I didn't follow the technique, but the flavors are worth experimenting with.

This may well be the best mac & cheese I have ever made! I used regular shredded cheddar cheese -- maybe that's the difference from the other reviewers who said it came out lumpy? Also used cavatappi pasta rather than penne. I'll definitely be making this again!

I am really disappointed to say that I thought that this dish was really bland. I had such high hopes! I love leeks, love a good mac and cheese, but this just didn't do it for me. I asked my husband to rate the dish (before I let him know how I felt about it), and he gave it a 4! A four!!

I agree with the cook from Santa Cruz - Nice flavor. At first I thought that her problem with curdling was because she did not temper the eggs, so I was very careful and my sauce was perfectly smooth as it went into the oven. But once baked, the texture was no longer creamy smooth, but a little more like cottage cheese.

This recipe was simple, yet rich and unbelievably tasty. I added proscuitto for an extra bit of saltiness, although it would have been great without. Six satisfied diners would agree as well... would definitely make it again.

Nice flavors here with the leeks and the mustard. The sauce was a little to curdly for my taste, I prefer a creamier, cheesier sauce for homemade mac n cheese.
