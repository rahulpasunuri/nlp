Ok, I've done it now, & it was delicious - a great combination of textures & flavours. Had to use dried curry leaves (unfortunately, as they're much less aromatic). Added the finely minced wild garlic stalks with the coriander root, & also stirred in the lime zest. My wild garlic leaves were large, so I chopped them roughly before adding. I only used two red chillies (with seeds) as they were big & I didn't want it to be too hot, but it could have taken three. I also used half soy/ half veggie stirfry sauce, as my partner is vegetarian. As I said in my previous comment, US cooks could use ramps, but out of season any green (spinach, chard etc) would be fine, as there's lots going on flavour-wise (& tinned beans would be fine too).

Skye Gyngell is based in the UK, where wild garlic is a native plant. It's from the same family as ramps so I think that would be the closest US equivalent (or texture-wise mature spinach or chard leaves plus garlic would probably do). Luckily it's in season here right now &, as I've been making pestos, soups & omelettes galore with it, I'll be trying this next. Yes, coco beans are a bit obscure, but she does provide a substitute. Everything else would be easily available from Asian shops or any big supermarket here in the UK.

Re spices in NYC: Check out the indian spice store between 5/6 streets on 1st avenue - they have every thing imaginable.

I agree...ridiculous and obscure list of ingredients...why does this get 4 forks?!

This dish sounds delicious will have to try it some time and post a review soon... I felt bad for the two ladies from NY on finding the ingredients and I sympathize, so here are a couple of suggestions for melindagh from Cooperstown, NY. I'm not familiar with Cooperstown but if by any chance there is an Indian or Asian restaurant in your town, speak to either the owner or cook and ask where they shop for Asian/Indian spices. I have done this in Cincinnati and got pointers for several Indian food/spice stores. Now i do all types of Asian cooking with no trouble, plus i get huge bags of spices for less price than in any Wholefoods or American groceries. Now for the "A Cook from New York, NY" posted on 04/28/10 you should have no trouble finding all these ingredients in NYC. I grew up in NYC area and if anyone i know needs spices they go to little corner Hispanic stores or Bodegas. Another is to go to Whole Foods, which they charge a bit more for their spices in my opinion. If you want to get more for your money and do one trip go to Washington Heights for the Hispanic or Middle eastern grocery stores, China-town is another hot spot for these spices, Fairway Market has 5 or more locations in NYC area, also Jackson Heights area for Indian groceries (I think they have an area in Brooklyn called little Bangladesh). For New York Metro area see: Apna Bazaar Cash & Carry or Little India Store, Inc. (http://littleindianewyork.com) or Google "Indian groceries in nyc" and you'll find a ton. In my experience you can find most or all of these Ingredients in an Asian-Indian grocery store than in a typical American grocery. So I hope this helps.

I'm thrilled to find a curry recipe that doesn't call for simply curry powder or paste! The ingredients don't seem terribly obscure to me. I plan to try this out tomorrow and will report back.

I live in New York City- fairly cosmopolitan- but would have no idea where to begin in finding these ingredients without resorting to substitutes!

Okay with me to list unusual ingredients, but how about an explanation, suggestions for substitutions, and tips on where to find the ingredients if you don't happen to live in a large metropolitan area.

I agree with a Cook from Cairo, Egypt; No editing. Let us all find and try unusual ingredients. I will save this one, but hope to see more reviews from those who actually try it.

coco beans are also known as borlotti or cranberry beans - you could substitute pintos if you can't find either. wild garlic is quite similar to onion grass. chives would be a decent substitute.

I will say that for some people this might be difficult recipe.For me a stop at any of our Asian grocery stores or even Wholefoods I can find everything. Jaggery is Palm Sugar ( Asian mkt. )sub Dk Brown sugar and Curry Leaves (Indian or Asian mkt.)- sub Thai Basil. You could sub new Pea shoots for the garlic greens ( Asian mkt & whole foods). I am excited to try this recipe and I think I might add fried tofu for more protien. Look's like a winner for a vegetarian.

I'm not up to the challenge - well, maybe for the million dollars - but I bet you could find all of the ingredients in San Francisco!!

Don't forget that epicurious is on the world wide web. coco beans might be difficult for you to find.. but bacon is hard for others to find. I argue for no editing! I want all the recipes with all their exotic ingredients.

ktaormina is right. When the ingredients are this obscure, even when the recipe sounds interesting, what's the point? There are too many other good dishes to make with ingredients that can be obtained locally to bother with this one.

I think Epicurious should offer a million dollar prize to anyone who can assemble these ingredients in less than one week without doing mail order. WILD GARLIC LEAVES? COCO BEANS? I'm pretty food savvy and I haven't even heard of some these things. But it sounds delish!
