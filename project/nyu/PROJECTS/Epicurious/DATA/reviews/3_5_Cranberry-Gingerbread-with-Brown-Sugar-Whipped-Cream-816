This recipe is a family favorite. It has a rich flavor and texture and is spicy so it is a very filling dessert.

This is GREAT - with and without the cranberries - for a wide range of palates (young to old, mild to spicy). Buttermilk and butter give it luscious taste and texture, and crystallized ginger elevates but does not overpower the flavors. It's lovely with peaches and/or nectarines, too.

I made this twice, once the way the recipe was written, and a second time with modifications. First, I got rid of the cranberries; they don't make sense in this recipe. Also, it's a little blah in its original form so I increased the ginger to 2 tablespoons, the allspice to 1 teaspoon, and the cloves to 1/2 teaspoon. I also used dark molasses instead of light, and incresed the buttermilk to 1-1/3 cups. I baked it in 12 mini Bundt pans for about 30 minutes. I served them on individual plates that were drizzled with caramel sauce, topped with the gingerbread and a dollop of the whipped cream and sprinkled with additional crystallized ginger. Yum.

Used the brown sugar cream for the Old-Fashioned Gingerbread from this site. Will try this one next time I'm in the mood for gingerbread - but the Old-Fashioned recipe will be hard to beat.

This was a disappointment. Not enough ginger taste, although we did like to crystalized ginger chunks.

I tried the cranberry gingerbread for Christmas and everyone loved it. Although it was wonderful served warm with the brown sugar whipped cream, it was still tasty leftover because the gingerbread stays quite moist. I'll definitely make this again.

The reviews were great, and the gingerbread smelled wonderful while baking. Sadly, it didn't live up to its promise. No one ate more than a bite or two; and I tore up the recipe to be sure that I never make it again. The brown sugar whipped cream was great on the Thanksgiving pies.

This cake is wonderful and rich. I made it for an office Christmas party and people loved it. I used regular molasses, and I baked it in a bundt pan and sprinkled icing sugar on it. I also used regular whipped cream, to save on time. I can't wait to try it with the brown sugar whipped cream!

Made a double batch for an office birthday party. Came out spectacular! Everyone loved it, particularly the subtle infusion of cranberry and crystallized ginger. Didn't have a glass dish so I baked them in two foil pans of the suggested size. Found they needed an extra ten minutes of baking. I collect gingerbread recipes and have quite a few very good ones. This is one of the very best I've ever had.

We tried this recipe last night and it just hit the spot! Very delicious. Light texture with a nice balance between the tart cranberries and the sweetness of the gingerbread. The crystallized ginger added sparkle. A most-definite repeater.

THE best, most gingery gingerbread I've ever made-or had. Fabulous. And when I had the urge to make it again, and had no crystallized ginger, I was so desparate I figured out how to make some form of c. ginger. (Just simmer chunks of fresh ginger in sugar water for a very long time, then roll the chunks in sugar and let them dry. The leftover ginger water/syrup makes great tea, too. Or add it to seltzer and lime for a good summer drink.)

There are many gingerbread recipes, but this is special. Easily one of my favorite desserts, the whipped cream is a simple and perfect compliment. The cake is moist and stays that way. The candied ginger packs punch. All in all an instant classic in my house, and I have been making for 5 years.
