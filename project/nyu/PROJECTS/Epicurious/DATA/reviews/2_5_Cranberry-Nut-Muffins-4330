This was a great recipe!!! I added frozen blueberries that I had frozen fresh from the summer. I also used whole wheat and soy flours in place of the all purpose flour and really enjoyed these muffins!

I have young children, so I substituted white chocolate chips for the nuts. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and they were a huge hit. These will definitely become a muffin staple in our house.

These muffins are really nothing special. The texture is not right and they lack flavor even with the addition of dried cranberries. Epicurious needs to find a new receipe for cranberry muffins.

The muffins were bland and the texture was off. The batter was good but the finished product was unremarkable. Increasing the orange zest to a tablespoon did not help. There are far tastier and healthier muffins out there.

Actually, I quite enjoyed this recipe and would make it again. My only comment is that I found the muffins to be a little too heavy and would like to make them a little lighter. Otherwise, a very good muffin recipe.

YUCK!...and I followed the recipe exactly. The muffins were heavy without much flavor. Definitely would not make again.

These muffins were dry and heavy. I followed the recipe and just didn't like them. Won't make again

I've made these twice, (trying to use up some applesauce and dried cranberries) and they were a bigger hit with my health-conscious, low-fat-not-too-much sugar friends then with my own taste buds. They taste good, especially it seems if you fall into the former category.... but also if you're trying to use up that applesauce. I cheated and melted some butter into the muffin tins before baking. :)

I found these muffins dry and bland. One of the most disappointing muffin recipes that I have ever made.

What a great recipe! They had great texture, sweetness and tastiness! This will certainly be a frequently used recipe and you would never know these didn't use butter or oil.

I've made these twice now, with the following changes: fresh cranberries instead of dried (at least 2 cups' worth), non-fat sour cream + 1Tbsp oil, unsweetened apple sauce + a bit of extra sugar. They're turned out very nice, I thought them fairly light, with good texture. I'll be making them again, and using dried fruit when fresh is not available.

This is a wonderful recipe. I loved the use of dried cranberries instead of using the traditional fresh cranberries. I did however omit the walnuts due to food allergies, and the muffins still came out great. Definetly will use this recipe again, and again.

I used 1/4cup apple sauce and 2ozs. softened butter. No orange peel (I didn't have any). Although heavier than most muffins, the cake like texture was excellent. Eaten as is or with butter or jam they were very good indeed. A sure winner.

When I try this again I will decrease the cranberries and increase the walnuts. The muffins were quite heavy and filling. I would prefer them to be lighter - maybe it was something I did.

Excellent considering the low fat. I used low fat sour cream and soaked the cranberries in a little rum tossing them occasionally while I prepared the recipe. A big hit at my husbands office and with our friends.

the flavor was nice, but sort of a different texture.

Good recipe. However, I replaced half the apple sauce with butter.
