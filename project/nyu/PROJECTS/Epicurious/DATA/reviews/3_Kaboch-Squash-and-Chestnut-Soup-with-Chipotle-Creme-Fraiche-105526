Easy to make but not terrifically quick. The chipotle creme fraiche is really important to the flavor of the soup, makes it more complex and interesting. I made the creme fraiche nearly a week ahead, the soup several days ahead, and it became a simple task to reheat and assemble just prior to serving. I topped each dollop of creme fraiche with a chestnut and my guests enjoyed chasing it around in the soup. A good tip for preparing the kabochas: microwave each of them for a few minutes to slightly soften the skin. It becomes much easier to cut them in half.

It's ok, but not really worth the effort or the expense of all the ingredients. I substituted butternut since no Kaboch locally. The soup is all about the squash taste. I added some cider vinegar as I felt it needed some brightening. The soup has a clean squash soup. You can sense the presence of chestnuts, but the squash overpowers them. The chipotle creme fraiche was good, but it took 40+ minutes to reduce the sauce. And again, not really worth the cost of the port & wine I made some plain creme fraiche as well and used both. People liked it, but seems really expensive for squash soup.

Here are the backwards instructions: 1 cup ruby port 1/2 cup dry red wine 1 teaspoon canned chipotle chilies or 1 teaspoon chrshed dried chipotle chilies 2 tablespoons tomato paste 18 ounze container creme fraiche or 1 cup sour cream Combine port, wine, chiles, and tomato paste in heavy small saucepan. Simmer over medium heat until reduced to thick paste, stirring often, about 12 minutes. Fold in creme fraiche. Transfer to small bowl; cool. Cover and chill at least 1 hour and up to 1 week.

A new challenge: reading parts of the recipe that are written backward. I can do it, but haven't yet, so no review. The ingredients sound great.

I'm not sure I understand the fuss. This was o.k., but not very complex. It tasted somewhat like pureed baby food to me. I must admit to being especially disappointed as I had a bumper crop of Kabocha squash this fall and am looking for interesting recipes.

I made this soup for my annual Christmas dinner for 11 people and it was huge hit. The Kabocha squash was not available, but my local green grocer recommended butterCUP squash in its place. The fraiche made the soup! Caution, though, it took probably 40-50 minutes to reduce it the mixture to a paste, not the 12 minutes mentioned in the recipe.

This soup is a winter winner. I made the chipolte creame fraiche with sour cream and a bit spicier than call for. I took a big pot to work for our roving crock pot day. Even the "I don't like squash" people thought it was great. So do I!

I love this recipe. I have made it probably 6 or 7 times, usually around the holidays. The soup is quite creamy, and if you can't find the chestnuts, cashews (boiled for a good 45 minutes or so) work just as well. I also use a little more maple syrup to sweeten this, but it's good as is.

I would make this again, but wouldn't do it with the creme fraiche. Instead, I found the flavors more agreeable with a curry powder mixture I made myself (chile pwoder from N. Mexico) done in a quick, heated oil and drizzled on top.

I followed this recipe to the letter and the soup was wonderful. Even my finicky husband liked it. Having patience with the chipotle reduction is well worth the effort to achieve the paste consistency. I also make my own creme fraiche, which really adds to the creamyness of the soup. I also make butternut squash soup and the kabocha squash has a stronger flavor than the butternut - I'm sure it's okay with the butternut, but it's probably better if you can find the kabocha. My greater challenge was finding chestnuts - you could probably substitute walnuts and cook until soft.

Rich and creamy. The chipolte creme fraiche was a perfect foil.

Awesome, especially the chipotle cream made with creme-fraiche drizzled on top. We made the recipe with butternut squash and it was just great.

A good substitute for Kabocha is Butternut Squash. They share the same texture, taste and color.

Does anyone know a good substitute for kaboch squash? I would love to make this recipe, but am pretty sure I won't be able to find this particular squash.
