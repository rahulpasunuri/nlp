Terrific. Very tasty. Used gin instead of rice wine.

A very good recipe indeed. My husband, who's Chinese, agrees. The only problem I have is the oil -- too much even though I was wiping out the paper towels. We have a non-stick wok so we will use less oil next time. Very flexible recipe. We used different veg and it came out great.

I always forget about the different pace of Chinese cooking; after the chopping the cooking is so fast. This was good. I would have liked more ginger & garlic so will increase this next time. I also added a teaspoon of sirachi sauce.

This was exactly what I needed to fulfill my craving for Cantonese chow mein: a crispy noodle cake with stir fry nestled on top, oozing a delightful brown sauce. The only comment I have is that the sauce was a little too salty; I'll reduce the soy sauce next time. (The saltiness could also have come from my cheap rice wine, which had salt added.) Otherwise it was delicious. I'll definitely make this again. Pay no attention to the reviewers who say there's too much vinegar; vinegar isn't even in the recipe! Maybe they used rice wine vinegar instead of rice wine by accident?

The sauce used here is an excellent base for a chow mein or lo mein dish in general. The first time I made this I followed it exactly and had trouble with frying the noodle cake, but I think it was because the heat wasn't high enough. It was quite tasty but the marinade on the beef was a bit overpowering. This time I skipped the noodle frying step and went for a lo mein style dish instead of chow mein. I'm working on a semi-veg diet these days and so I excluded the beef (although I did cheat and keep the chicken stock), and instead added the 1/4 teaspoon of sesame oil to the sauce mixture because I wanted to keep that flavor. I added half a red bell pepper and a finely chopped thai chili just after the broccoli. I added a couple handfuls of bean sprouts just after the sauce was poured in. This was a delicious and filling veggie dish, and that's coming from a young guy who is really struggling with meatless meals. Next time I will add pineapple.

I was disappointed with the taste of this dish, and I really love Chinese food. It was too sour (too much vinegar), too salty (too much soy sauce), and had a strange spiciness (too much white pepper). I would definitely recommend cutting (at least) in half all three of these ingredients, although I will probably just look for another recipe that does not include the vinegar and uses some sort of chili instead of pepper to add spice.

Good food here! Although a little oily. Next time I won't fry the noodles into a patty. If you get the beef juice burning/sticking onto the bottom of the wok, stop between steps to clean it out or in the last step all that burnt food will release into your sauce...

Unusual for me, I nearly followed the recipe. I added some red bell pepper which helped the color I think. This was simply great. It is not as much work as it might look at first glance. Don't scrimp on the mushrooms, they really complement the beef.

I can't believe that anyone would be so ridiculous as to rate a recipe which they have admittedly made incorrectly (I won't name whom - it's obvious) & which they have changed completely! It's one thing to critique the ACTUAL recipe & to offer improvements, but to give a negative rating because of one's own mistakes is quite unfair & a waste of time for the rest of us!

Followed the recipe the first time. It makes a good but not spectacular chow mein. I have since been modifying with other vegetables and proteins. Turville from Los angeles, Please try actually making the recipe the way it says before rating it. If you changed the proteins, the vegetables and the techniques, it is no longer the intended flavor profile.. especially if your adding base sauce ingredients that need to meld into the recipe to taste right.

Really nice dish. Great flavours. Must be eaten immediately!

made this with pork, instead of beef, but other than that, followed the recipe. It's very good and a great "base" recipe for chow mein.

I give this recipe a two fork review because when I finished preparing the dish,and began eating it with my husband, I realized that I forgot to add the oyster sauce. It was not that the dish was lacking anything, it just occured to me as I was thinking about the ingredients while eating. So, what I did was add the oyster sauce the the remaining chow mein, and honestly, I preferred the taste of the chow mein without it...REALY. You may be thinking that perhaps I added too much oyster sauce, but I must tell you that this is highly unlikely because I am quite an experienced cook. Next time I prepare this dish, I will leave out the oyster sauce. I also used different vegetables: fresh shitaki mushrooms, chinese pea pods, green and white onion, cabbage and bean sprouts. I also used fresh jumbo shrimp instead of beef and alot less oil than the recipe called for.

This recipe is a good starting point, but a bit bland and salty. (I used low sodium soy and broth too).

Made this last night--it was EXCELLENT. Couldn't find the right noodles or choy sum. Subbed "Wel-Pac Chow Mein Stir-Fry Noodles" and broccoli florets. Also used Portobello mushrooms and Sherry. Since I used a non-stick wok-type skillet, only used 3 Tbs. peanut oil. Made the whole recipe (except only 6 oz. of noodles) for 2 good size servings. DELICIOUS

this recipe was just not that great. beef marinade is good--but dish as a whole lacked flavor. needed more garlic, ginger and more. not bad, but I was surprised it got a 4 star review. I won't bother with it again.

I used broccoli...although I didn't fry the fresh noodles into a cake, I put them onto a plate and served the stir fry on top. It was spectacular! I'd like to try this with chicken also...

Loved this recipe! I had a larger flank steak so I increased all the other ingredients proportionately and it was soooo good. I did it with broccoli but it would work with other vegetables as some other reviewers have mentioned. This will be my go to stir fry. I found by prepping most of the ingredients a little earlier putting dinner on the table was pretty quick.

A great recipe, although we had to substitute the shiitake mushrooms for Portobello, and the choy sum for broccoli, due to the former ingredients being near to impossible to find here. The noodles were very bland, but the sauce made them taste great.

We love this recipe (includes my fussy hubby and 7 year old)!! I make this every couple of months and follow the recipe to a T using broccoli. Highly recommend.

I'm so sorry to disagree, but my husband and I really did not like this dish. I suspect that it has little to do with the recipe itself, given how universally popular it's been. Perhaps we're just not chow mein-loving people.

This was an amazing recipe! I made this as a vegetarian dish with tofu and it turned out wonderful. Added extra fresh ginger and chili flakes to add some kick to it. This will become a staple.

It is an awesome dish. I'm chinese so I love it.

This dish is absolutely fabulous and is even better than any chow mein I've ordered in a restaurant. I didn't have oyster sauce so I substituted asian black bean sauce; I also substituted half an onion, carrot and celery for the vegetables listed as this was all I had on hand. Last, I doubled the sauce ingredients. I can't wait to make it again -- and accompany it with a glass of plum wine.

This recipe is too good to be true! Very easy to prepare - and incredibly delicious. Some modifications: I used a large skillet instead of a wok as I am useless with a wok - it worked just fine; I used chicken instead of beef - also worked great; added red chili flakes and some chili oil to give it a kick - this was a welcome balance as the dish is somewhat rich. My family thought it was the best "stir fry" they've ever had - I'm going to make it again next week (by request).

Took a little longer than I had anticipated, but was well worth the effort. I substituted shredded cabbage, celery, and carrots for the choy sum, and added bean sprouts. Next time, I will double the sauce and serve it over cooked chow mein noodles. My husband loved it.

This is SOOOO good. The best recipe i have gotten from this site. Wonderful flavor. I make this a few times a month. It is a regular dish for my family. Really hits the spot if you are craving chinese food but do not want take out. You can control the ingredients. I bought everything from the whole foods store so it has no msg and I bought reduced sodium product. This dish is fantastic!!!

Excellent recipe, the sauce is perfect - I would make more than called for ,though. Also a great base for whatever veggies you like in stir fry. Would make again in a heartbeat.

Excellent! I found the fresh noodles at an Asian Market, Chinese Chow Mein/Kim sum is what they were called. I also got the Choy Sum at the same market, Bok Choy Sum is what they called it. I added 2 stalks of sliced celery and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. The noodle cake and sauce fabo! I made the recipe for 4 with 4 ounces of the noodles. It might have served 3 with more noodles but not 4. I used a 10 fry pan and it worked just fine.

So now I know what real chow mein is. I enjoyed it very much and loved munching on the left over noodles. I would increase all of the ingredients except for the noodles if you are really going to serve four.

This is not the dull, boring, tasteless chow meins of the past. This has wonderful, bright flavors and is deelicious! The sauce is great! The fried noodle cakes are a nice crunchy compliment. I was making this for 2 so only used 2oz. (dried) total of the noodles and found it to be plenty. I also did not make one large cake, but 2 individual ones. This made it much easier to manage frying in the wok. I plan to make this often.

Everyone in my family loved it. I made 4 times the amount of sauce, as we all enjoy extra. I also used stew meat instead of the flank steak. I trimmed all the fat off. It was great.
