Very easy and very yummy. I made the broth ahead as the recipe suggests can be done. My only changes were using one full seeded serrano chile (because I'm crazy about spicy) and lightly pan-frying the tortillas as some other reviewers recommended. This is something I will make often.

I made this for guests who are vegetarian/vegan. I doubled the recipe, used 2 whole cans of black beans and a whole jalapeno since I like things a bit spicy. I also took the advice of another reviewer and used 2 cans of rotel in place of the diced tomatoes. I simmered it for awhile, so it was thicker and we all really liked it. I served it with sides of shredded cheese, diced avocado and pan fried corn tortilla strips. It was delish and I will definitely make it again!

This is one of my favorite soup recipes--simple to make, delicious and healthy! I usually add some chili seasoning to boost the flavor a bit, and I also omit the tortillas and add some diced fresh avocado (to individual serving bowls, not the pot). Yum!

I thought this was pretty good. I may have made a few modifications for ease-- I used one full jalapeno seeded, full can of beans, one whole zucchini, which made it heartier and chunkier. I thought the tortilla strip were a bit soggy but i didn't really mind. I did fry some strips up for a garnish. I'm taking this to a potluck and hope they like it too.

While this was tasty, I was disappointed that it was not a little spicier, as I was expecting. Next time I will add more chili powder and jalapeño. I agree with others that the tortillas were mushy, but I thought it added a nice texture and wasn't gross. I also added more beans, tomatos, and a whole zucchini so my soup turned into more of a hearty stew, which I loved.

We made this last night and LOVED it! It was quick and easy. We added chipotle pepper to it. In the first bowl we put the tortillas in as described and they quickly got soggy and frankly, gross. For seconds, I cut the strips in half and fried them crispy and added a touch of salt and served it on top of the soup and it was AMAZING!!! We doubled the cumin, used 1 tsp salt, 1/3 tsp black pepper, had not cilantro but used 1 tsp coriander instead.

I'm not the biggest fan of tortilla soup in general but this recipe was great! Very easy to make although I did tweak it a bit. Used 4 cloves of garlic and a pinch of salt as well as double the cumin, a dash more of chili powder and a dash of cayenne. I added the extra spices and salt after the allotted boiling time had passed because the broth was too bland. I also added a whole zucchini, a whole can of black beans and an extra tortilla. The soup turned out great - really nice texture from the tortillas.

I do not understand the rave reviews for this recipe. I made it exactly as stated and it was not good. I've had better tortilla soups out of a can. I used good ingredients from the Fresh Market and I know how to cook. It's not even worth tweaking. There was an odd sweet flavor - not nice - and the tortillas turned to absolute mush. Blech.

This is a great stable. And totally agree that the tortillas are used as a thickening agent. I toasted some slices in the broiler to use as a topping for added crunch. Loved it! And next time I think I will add more beans, some cheese and slice avocado.

This is a winner! I fried 1/4" strips of corn tortillas and served them at the table to ladle the soup over (in addtion to chopped avocado, sour cream, cilantro and cheese).

This soup turned out great! I increased the black beans, and zucchini. I also added corn. The tortilla strips definitely thickened the soup.

This soup is very healthy and easy to make which is a plus!

Delicious recipe. I made the following changes: used chicken broth instead of veggy broth, added a teaspoon of sea salt, added the juice of one lime. Also, I pureed all the ingredients except for the zucchini, beans, and corn strips because I prefer smooth soups to chunky soups. I also combined all the ingredients up front and let sit overnight rather than waiting until service to add the corn strips, zucchini, and beans. This allowed all the ingredients to blend together overnight. Yum!

I really liked this and it was very easy. I have to admit, though, that I didn't stick to the recipe, so I guess I can't really say much (I know that's a pet peeve of many people reading reviews). Part of it was on purpose but most of it was because I realized I didn't have the ingredients I thought I did. In case anyone is looking for ideas, here's what I did: I used salsa instead of tomato paste, used a whole 15oz can of black beans, subbed corn for the zucchini, omitted the jalapeno (because I have young kids) and added some mild canned green chili, added small chunks of chicken (because my hubby won't eat vegetarian), and used chicken broth instead of vegetable. It turned out delicious! I am going to try and make it again following the recipe better! The way I made it was very hearty. I really liked having the extra beans.

We love this soup. The second time I made it, I add the tomatoes and squash a little earlier so that it absorbs more flavor of the soup. We sprinkle Cotija cheese which really adds a nice flavor.

I don't rate many recipes, although I usually read them. This is exceptional soup. really easy to make with great flavor. I made only one change by using one big fat Chipotle Chili (we love the smokey heat and flavor of them). Amazing - easy to add a little shredded chicken for my husband who needs to have his meat.

Made this on a cold night and ate it for the next 3 days! It was delicious! I put a little mozzarella on top and let it melt a little. The corn tortillas make it great and the jalapeno adds a great kick! I also added some garlic powder and didn't have any cumin but it was still delicious!

I thought this recipe was just ok. My husband enjoyed it. Next time, I will dd corn to it.

Adding corn is definitely a must, but the reviews saying to add the tortillas at the end or fry them beforehand are missing the whole point. The tortilla is supposed to disintegrate and create a thick, rich texture to the soup, that's how authentic Mexican tortilla soups are made. A bit of avocado and some sour cream/creme fraiche are good additions. The only other change I made was swapping chicken broth for the veggie broth and real vegetable oil for spray. And it definitely will serve more than four.

We had this for dinner. I followed the recipe except took advice from other reviews and waited to add the tortillas till about 2 minutes were left. My daughter and I both thought it was delicious. Not horribly spicy, but nourishing, and comforting. There is plenty left over for lunch tomorrow. It says it serves 4, but those would be gigantic serves!

This is really easy and versatile - I doubled the recipe, added a can of corn, skipped the tomatoes (not a fan of raw tomato) and at the table served a bunch of toothpick-sized grilled corn tortillas (from another tortilla soup recipe on epicurious) to sprinkle on top. Do add a dollop of sour cream - adds smoothnes and richness Nice flavor, especially on a chilly autumn day!

I absolutely love this soup (and usually double it). the longer it sits in the fridge, the better it is! I agree with all the other remarks about the corn tortillas - they do disintegrate, but that adds to the thickness. I usually tear up an extra tortilla for each bowl to add when I serve it. I also recommend slicing half an avocado into each bowl before ladling in the soup.

The tortillas did "melt" in the soup (i.e. they were not distinctive) but they thickened the soup into almost a stew. This is the kind of soup that you could add a variety of veggies and it still would be great. I topped it with a tofu based "sour cream."

I made this soup last night to rave reviews from my family. I added the juice of a fresh lime at the last minute.

This was a great and simple dish. I added a bunch of stuff to it to to beef it up a little. I used salsa instead of tomato paste, added some red bell pepper. I marinated some flounder in lime, jalapeno and garlic and tossed that in with the other ingredients near the end, but the flounder was not firm enough so and fell apart in the liquid... it still had great flavor though, but was hoping for some nice light fish strips like you would get with the chicken version. After all that I threw it in a bowl over a little brown rice with some olives, avocados, cheese and tortilla chips. I like a lot of flavors and this had it but any of the extras could have been left out and it still would have been great. Maybe no fish and just beans and rice or not beans and rice with just fish... so many possibilities!

This soup was wonderful! I used canned crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato paste and fresh tomatoes and used both corn and zucchini as my veggies.

So quick & easy and yet still full of flavor! I increased stock by two cups (used chicken stock for better flavor), used full cup each of zucc. and beans, increased tortillas, and leaned on the salt and pepper.

I am not going to say that this soup isn't good -- it has its tasty moments. However, I by no means think it deserves four forks! I gave it the "like it, don't love it" 2 forker. Near completion, I tested it with great anticipation and had to go back to re-read the ingredients to make sure I didn't forget something - I was that disappointed. My tips would be to up the spices, add a little adobo, use a good broth, and by all means use low sodium canned goods...otherwise this will have days worth of sodium. It's important to hold half the cilantro until the end so it doesn't develop that bittery aftertaste. Definitely crisp up some tortilla for the top - beautiful presentation! Give it a try for something quick, but don't get your hopes up too high.

Also, used radishes and an avocado for garnish. Great vegetarian soup!

Very easy and yummy. I also used canned diced (petite) tomatoes instead of fresh, extra broth, and added hominy. I did not add the tortillas to the soup, but cut them into strips, sprayed them with Pam, sprinkled with salt and baked in a 350 oven until crispy. I got that from another tortilla soup recipe, but definitely like this soup better. It was very satisfying without meat, even for my husband. Kids loved it because I kept the jalapenos on the side for husband and me and added shredded cheddar/jack cheese. Husband said make it again on Friday (Lent - no meat)!

I also added the tortillas at the beginning which disolved and thickened the broth nicely. Several reviewers mentioned adding corn which is a nice addition.

Not sure if everyone else has mouths made of iron or if I just ended up with a larger-than-usual Poblano chili, but the end result was terribly hot for my and my guests' taste. (People were gulping water, dabbing their eyes, and fanning themselves..!) That said, the soup had the best flavor of any tortilla soup I've ever had anywhere, and everyone adored it in spite of the perspiring! I used chicken stock (fresh homemade, not canned broth) and a head of roasted garlic instead of the 2 cloves of fresh garlic the recipe called for. Next time, I'll use half the Poblano and declare it a masterpiece!! Definitely a keeper.

Just a comment about the posting that said the tortillas were soggy. The corn tortillas used in tortilla soup are really supposed to dissolve completely. They're a flavoring and thickening agent.

A funny story. I teach a cooking class and kids do the darndest things. We were making soups so one of the ingredients on the ingredient table was canned chili(to compare with homemade).
