This soup had a good flavor and you could easily use other vegetables. I did not use the cabbage and think it would have been too many vegetables if I had. I did use kitchen basics beef stock for some of the liquid. I have been disappointed in many beef soups so I was very happy this one worked!

I've been a little lacking in the vegetable department lately, and suddenly the craving for veggies with a little tasty protein hit me hard. Then I found this recipe. It was just the combination I needed. I used fresh thyme instead of marjoram. Ended up leaving out the peas, which seemed out of place to me. Instead, I upped the amount of cabbage, and threw in a lot of kale as well. Also added some green beans, zucchini, celery and an extra potato. With all the extras, the soup took six 14.5 oz. cans of beef broth, the lower sodium kind, and it was still very thick and hearty. Using bags of coleslaw mix and chopped-up kale decreased the cutting time significantly. So does using stew-cut chuck. Cook it first to retain the needed fat, then cool it in the fridge during the next step. Then you can cut it into bite-size pieces and add that to the mix. The result is a super delicious meal. I had some for dinner the same night, and then saved half for work lunches and froze the other half. Perfect for fall nights in Alaska!

an excellent recipe, very versatile, you can substiute veggies, I didn't use corn,peas or cabbage. Instead I used green beans and some small pasta and it was great!

Very good recipe that you can be flexible with. I simmer the soup for about an hour and a half so the meat is super tender. Super good with nice bread and some fancy cheese.

Instead of cooking the chuck roast, I used leftover short ribs (bones removed and diced), which I added the last 20 minutes of simmer time. I also had some leftover great northern beans, so added those too. In other words, this is a very versatile soup that allows you to be creative and also clean the fridge! Followed others' suggestion and used a little red wine for some of the broth. Added a couple Tbsp of chopped parsley too. Did not have cabbage, but didn't miss it. Really nice for a cool, rainy November day like today in Chicago--served with sourdough baguette.

Delicious and hearty. Just right for a cold day. Made the following adjustments: added 3/4 cup wine per previous reviewer's suggestion, used half chicken half beef broth, deleted cabbage (my hubby doesn't like it). Just before serving added a couple tablespoons of couscous to each bowl. My husband loved it. Will definitely make again.

As a previouls reviewer suggested, I always make half a recipe and it still gives us plenty share or freeze. This time when I made it, I had about 1 1/2 lbs. of ground chuck that needed to be used. We decided it was better with the chuck than with the stew meat. It gave you lots of meat in every bite. And its much more economical.

Have been making this recipe for over a year and a half now....and we just love it! Sometimes I add different veggies like yellow and green squash and fresh green beans. Personally, I prefer it without the corn, but overall it's great. And, the second day it's even better. Enjoy!

Tasty, hearty, soup. Easy to make.

I halved this and still had some to freeze, so this make a huge amount. I used the fresh thyme and marjoram and put them into a cheesecloth bundle, with the bay leaf, so it was easy to remove later. I also added a half cup barley.

I added one cup barley after browning meat, added 1/2 diced rutabaga and omitted cabbage. Made a huge batch and shared it with three other families who thought it was the best veg. beef soup they had ever had. My husband and I loved it. Easy and wonderful

I did as one of the other reviewers recommended and added 3/4 cup red wine after browning the beef and adding the beef and veggies back into the pan. I also added both thyme and marjoram. I dded a large dash of Worchestershire Sauce for a bit more flavor. I found the beef tough after 50 minutes so I left it simmering for a couple of hours until the beef was fork tender. We loved it!

My family loves this soup and I've made it a few times now to rave reviews. I usually make it pretty close to the recipe with just a few changes depending on what's on hand. This time I tried sweet potatoes which works wonderfully. Also, just for fun, we threw in a cup or so of Alphabet noodles near the end of cooking. Yummy and healthy.

I'm so glad I found this recipe. It was hearty, healthy and very easy to make. It will become a go to soup recipe for me.

Love this soup! I didn't have any frozen corn but added diced yellow squash. Actually, I can't think of any veggie that wouldn't taste good in this soup. I browned the beef and removed it from the pot before sauteeing the carrots, onions, diced celery (my addition) & garlic. Deglazed with 3/4 cup red wine before returning the beef to the pot. Delicious...and even more so the next day!

This is a wonderful recipe. My neighbor came over and had 3 bowls - and we hadn't even invited him!!! His wife went on to make the recipe as well. Kids like it too....

This soup was great for winter dinner. I omitted the cabbage but it was still very silky and thick. It could be a little on the bland side without plenty of garlic and fresh herbs (I used marjoram).

N.B. I made a vegan version (eg, tempeh instead of beef), so my comments probably don't generalize. I know - - no surprise. That said, the soup was very good comfort food.

This is a really good soup--very hearty! Instead of using stewing beef, I used very lean, meaty short ribs--sooo good! Besides this change, I followed the recipe exactly as it's written! My husband really enjoyed the soup as well--not his typical "meat and potatoe" dinner!! Definitely a keeper!

This is a good, hearty soup, but it's a bit bland. I would suggest adding about 1/2 cup of red wine vinegar with the beef broth. I added some vinegar and it was wonderful.

I made this soup for my girlfriend and she loved it! It was very easy to make for a novice cook like myself. It's great on a cold winter evening.

An update to my previous review... The soup is VERY tasty the next day, and it keeps getting better. We've been eating it all week. I would make it again, but i would make it in advance and wait for the flavors to meld a little.

We thought the cabbage was nice, but the soup didn't have a ton of flavor to us - but we DO like things savory/spicy, so we are biased that way. I added more garlic than called for, and kept adding salt and pepper, but it just didn't do it for me. Maybe tomorrow night it will be more flavorfull. I think the addtion of red wine and/or parm. cheese would help.

Excellent, rich flavor and super easy to make. Who could ask for more? Followed the recipe exactly, using fresh marjoram for seasoning (so fragrant!). I'll continue making this for years to come.

This was so simple but my husband can't stop raving about it. It really is a lovely, simple dish and I would think could stand up to a lot of variation.

This soup was so excellent and quick and easy to make. It made a bunch, so I gave some to my mom and dad. My mom and dad liked it so much that my mom made some for them. The cabbage made it really good. I made no changes to the recipe. I will make again. It is my favorite vegetable soup.
