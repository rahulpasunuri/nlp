This recipe is a winner. I have made it several times now and people lick the plate clean--young and old alike. I use high quality vanilla ice cream mixed with 3/4 cup shredded coconut and a teaspoon of coconut extract, I have found several varieties of coffee ice cream to compliment the coconut beautifully--with and without chips. To my taste along with what I have seen watching guests I will tend to go heavier on the coconut portion and lighter on the coffee ice cream in assembling the cake. I have also found that doubling the recipe will fit a 9" springform pan well and suit a larger crowd. It is wonderful to have a spectacular dessert that can be prepared days ahead. Bravo!!

I made this for my Gourmet Group, it was delicious and the presentation was nice. I used a Coconut & Rum gelato and Starbucks coffee Ice Cream. I also toasted fresh coconut strips in oven and then sprinkled them with vanilla sugar. I garnished the side of the plate and a little on top of the cake with the coconut and this added to the presentation of the dessert.

I have made this three times now. Delicious! Easy to make and nice to have on hand. It will keep for a week if well wrapped.
