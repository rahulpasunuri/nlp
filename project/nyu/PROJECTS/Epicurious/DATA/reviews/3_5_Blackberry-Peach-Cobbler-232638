I agree with several of the other reviewers, the topping was too heavy and too much, it over powered the fruit. Guests did not really like it either so poor choice for entertaining. Will find another recipe that has a different topping.

Um did somebody forget to say "turn down the oven temperature" on the part when the topping bakes? I ended up with a hard, brown mess on top and overspill of berries all over my oven. This is an easy recipe and I should have known better than to bake at 425 so for others who don't know that recipes have built-in mistakes, take heed!

The taste was great. There certainly wasn't enough peaches and I put in extra! I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. Definitely too much biscuit mix. Drizzled honey on top when it was finished baking. Also changed flour to 1/2 white, 1/2 wheat and added a 1/4 c alomnd meal. Despite the changes it was very good. Can I cut down on the butter to 1 stick?

This cobbler is amazing, we cut the sugar down to 1 cup like suggested, and added raspberries & plums with the peaches & blackberries. Will definitely make this again! Also added cinnamon, nutmeg & sugar to the topping.

Basic, easy and good. I was almost out of sugar in the house so I only added about a tablespoon to the fruit and then the tablespoon sprinkled on top of the biscuits. With fresh blueberries (my mother has bushes in her backyard) and peaches, it was plenty sweet without extra sugar. I did add some chopped up crystallized ginger which gave it just the slightest hint of a kick and was a very welcome addition. I agree that the fruit to topping ratio was a bit off - I didn't even use all of the dough and still felt like I wanted more fruit for the biscuit I had.

This was great, I was out of cornstarch but flour worked fine, just used a little more. Added a couple tablespoons Amaretto to the fruit mixture just for fun and some cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping. The topping was very light and tender, not hard and dry like some I have tried. Can't wait to have leftovers for breakfast :)

I made this for my family last night. What a hit! I didn't use the blackberries, but I'd like to try the recipe again with them. I compensated by using more peaches (including white ones), which enabled me to make three pies! I sent one home with my sister who is a professional chef from the CIA! We ate the other one for breakfast- delicious!

Excellent cobbler! I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup. I also just pulled the dough apart and dotted it on top of the fruit.I did add some baking spices to the dough.

I made this for my family, but instead of peaches, I added blueberries and raspberries, along with the blackberries and it was a big hit. I did adjust the recipe and cut the sugar by 1/2 cup. I also took another commenter's advice to add nutmeg and cinnamon to the topping. Really easy to make and yummy to eat.

Very good recipe. I cut back on the amount of sugar and added a tsp of sugar and a tsp of cinnamon to the dough mixture before cooking. I also let the dough mixture sit for about 10 extra minutes before baking. The crust was light (not dense, which I dont care for), and It had a nice flavor right out of the oven and the next day too.

Threw this together pretty quickly. Subbed 1 c. of wheat flour and honey for the sugar.

I made this for a a recent family dinner night. I substituted Almond Milk (Almond Breeze: Original) for the whole milk and followed the suggestion I found in the reviews to add cinnamon and nutmeg to the mixture as well as the top. It turned out fantastic! The aroma that filled the house had me on the edge of my seat waiting for a taste. Unfortunately my family got stuck in the airport and didn't make it home, so I had to enjoy seconds and thirds by myself. Hah.

I made this for a picnic with super fresh peaches and blackberries. It was a huge hit with about 20 adults at the party! I kept the sugar levels as stated since the berries were pretty tart. No cornstarch, so in went 1/2 cup of flour (just right). I added a little nutmeg to the fruit mixture and cinnamon- nutmeg-sugar to the topping. My only comment is that it was a little heavy on cobbler. I may reduce that recipe by 1/3 for the next try.

This is extremely simple to make when you are in a rush. I used fresh raspberries instead of the blackberries and served it with vanilla gelato. My friend's son thinks this is so good that I have to give him the recipe to get my dish back!

I didn't have the amount of fruit called for so I halved the recipe, including the topping. I also cut back on the sugar, but it didn't matter. It was delicious served with a bit of ice cream. A definite keeper!

Fantastic recipe. I did substitute buttermilk and it was amazing. The topping was the best. I would also add more fruit next time and I added strawberrys and blueberries and made it a summer berry cobbler and it was so good. I think I would cut back on the sugar next time as it was really really sweet with 1-1/2 cups. I will add only 1 cup next time.

I should have read the reviews before making this... totally my fault. It turned out to be way too sweet - so much that I can not eat it! It's going to the compost-bin tomorrow. I feel guilty for wasting perfectly good blackberries and peaches. :(

This recipe is great as it is. However, I like that I can change the qty type of fruit to what I have available and it's still wonderful. I've tried blueberry/peach and strawberry/banana. Both variations are great!

A very simple, easy and delicious dessert. I played with the fruit, adding peaches, blackberries, blueberries and plums. Also, I rolled out the crust and cut it into 15 biscuits which baked nicely and made for a much nicer presentation.

I just made this for my son's birthday and I was very pleased with how it turned out. I used peaches and wild red raspberries (my husband's a great berry-picker!). I like the biscuit much better than other cobblers I've tried; it's very tender and not dry. I had to make it the night before, so the biscuit was getting soft, but I popped it in the over for 10 minutes and it crisped up again. I also sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar instead of regular sugar. I agree with an earlier reviewer who suggested putting a tray underneath; mine also bubbled over.

I have made this recipe several times when in California and it has turned out wonderfully each time. I have switched up the fruit used in it and everything has worked great. I have done just peaches, just berries, and a combo of both. However, I just moved to Colorado and don't have the slightest idea how this needs to be changed for the altitude. Does anyone know what needs to be altered for 5,000 feet elevation?

This cobbler recipe turned out too sweet for my tastes. I only had 4 cups of blackberries, so I used 7 larger peaches instead. The fruit seemed overpowered by the sugar, and maybe needed that extra cup of blackberries to give a tart/sweet balance. The baking of just the fruit for 10-15 minutes also concentrated the filling, making it thick and syrupy (wasn't thin or runny in the end). However, after placing the biscuit mixture on top, which was a heavy dough, some of the liquidy fruit bubbled out of the dish while baking, making the pan and oven a sticky mess. Go with a slightly deeper pan, or put some foil down in the oven. The biscuit top gets very brown, but bready and moist inside. I made 15 dough balls vs. 12, and they were nice-sized servings. I served it with lightly sweetened heavy whipped cream. Ice cream would be too sweet. The group I served it to loved it, enjoyed the sweetness.

My sister's family loved this recipe as is. I thought it was delicious but I would have preferred a thinner, more even topping. They disagreed. I'll make it as stated next time I visit them but will thin the topping and add more fruit when I make it for myself at home. It's super delicious -- just a case of preference over the bread to fruit ratio.

This is a very easily prepared recipe and is absolutely delicious. I made the recipe, as written for a family picnic and several people declared this the best dessert they every had (our family tends to like fruit desserts rather than chocolate ones). They liked the biscuit texture of the topping. It like shortcake and it soaked up much of the syrup of the filling. About two weeks later I tried the topping recipe that was provided by the reviewer from Virginia for a smaller gathering of family and friends. The folks that had both preferred the original topping. The second topping was slightly lighter than the original recipe (as the reviewer from VA wrote) and I thought they were both good, just a matter of "taste". I certainly will keep this recipe to make again and again. If someone is interested in another delicious berry recipe, try the Berry Streusel Pie.

I seem to be one of the few dissenters. I found this much too sweet and too liquidy. As suggested by others, I tried the topping from the reviewer from VA. I made the mistake of tripling the dough, but still needed to use less buttermilk and baking powder. I also added salt to the batter and should have added a little sugar too.

I made this tonight with peaches I bottled last summer and fresh raspberries. I took the suggestion from fellow reviewers and modified the dough recipes. It turned out splendidly. I was in a rush and didn't cook the peaches and berries seperatly before hand but it still turned out great. I also think next time I might reduce the sugar in the cornstarch/sugar mixture, especially if I use bottled peaches again. This recipe is definitely a keeper, though!

I made this recently using frozen blackberries (one lb. bag) and some peaches I canned last summer. Along with the cornstarch I used 1 and 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp lemon juice and 1/2 tsp cinnamon with the fruit. I also used the modifications suggested by the reviewer from VA for the topping. It came out great and was SO easy. I am anxious to try it again with fresh fruit this summer.

Phenomenal. After one taste, this became my stand-by dessert. It is easy to pick up fruit & whole milk before an impromptu dinner party; the other ingredients are generally on hand. I measure the ingredients before dinner & assemble after. It allows a nice pause & lovely aromas for guests to enjoy while baking. And it is simple to throw together, even after a few glasses of wine! But I would make this one even it wasn't easy. Hot out of the oven, with the juices still simmering, topped with a good vanilla icecream, it is unsurpassable. (Like other reviewers, I add a bit of sugar & cinammon to the cobbler dough.)

Amazing crust, love the biscuity texture, perfect portions. I made a few adjustments. My father can't have blackberries, so I've made version with blueberries and with peaches only. These worked fine, but I felt them a bit overbalanced twoard the sweet, so I added some fresh lemon juice to balance it out a bit. I assume the natural tartness of blackberries would help with that, but I'd still be inclined to add a bit. I also added some cinnamon to the fruit to give it some character and complexity, and this was very well received. I also used demerara for the final sprinkling, which gave a nice caramel note to the crust. After these adjustments, the recipe was amazing, and much better than the dated recipe I had been using with about three times the butter and four times the sugar. Love my grandmother's cooking, but that was just too much.

Very tasty! I made a double batch for a party- the first exactly as written and the second with some changes, because I discovered that I didn't have enough blackberries. (oops!) I used peaches, blueberries and a couple plums and cut back on the sugar as the fruit was pretty sweet. The topping got a healthy dose of cinnamon and turned out beautifully. Easy to make and both the original and tweaked version were just wonderful. VA's recipe for a lighter topping sounds really good...I have to try that next time.

I made this cobbler and was extremely disappointed with the peaches I bought - you know, not juicy, mealy - well, turned out just delicious. Not sure how. I also used the VA cooks biscuit recipe and it was just great! My guests were pleased!

I also used the "cobbler recipe" from the VA cook, and realized almost too late that you need to triple it to get enough dough. Duh. But the results were, as she said, lighter (which I liked) and yummy buttery. Also, I only added 1 cup of sugar the fruit because most cobblers are too sweet for me.

Very good warm but even better at room temp the next day. Subbed blueberries for blackberries and used 1% milk in topping. Filling overflowed a bit and burned on my oven floor, creating a smoky situation. Next time, I'll bake on a cookie sheet to catch drips.

This was great. Between my mother's peaches and the blackberries from the local Farmer's Market, I made this cobbler. I loved this and plan on making it again tomorrow. The only thing I would recommend is lowering the temperature on the oven. The dough didn't seem all the way cooked but the top would have burnt had I left it in there any longer - it still turned out great.

Overall, delicious. (We did make a few tweaks.) I substituted the flour with 1 part almond meal, one part whole wheat flour and one part all-purpose flour. We added a teaspoon of cinnamon, a teaspoon of vanilla powder and half a teaspoon of nutmeg to the "biscuit" topping. In the fruit, we also substituted tapioca for the cornstarch and splenda (1/2 as much) for the sugar (although we sprinkled two teaspoons of real sugar on top.)

This was good! A friend had just spent a very hot and humid afternoon picking blackberries, so I had fresh berries. I reduced the amount of sweetener to 1 cup, and used 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar, since we don't like our fruit pies and desserts overly sweet.

An incredible cobbler. The topping/dough is similar to a biscuit's density, which some of my family did not like. My mother has a cobbler recipe that has a much lighter, springier dough, which I really like. So I do the fruit according to the recipe here and make the dough as follows: 1 cup plain flour 3 teaspoons baking powder 1 cup buttermilk 1/2 stick butter (melted) Whisk the flour, baking powder together. Add buttermilk and butter and mix just until dough forms. Drop batter onto fruit, bake until top is brown (20-25 min at 425)

Much easier and "no sugar" friendly recipe when I made a few changes: instead of cornstarch, I used instant tapioca. For fruit, I used 6 oz. fresh blackberries, 1 can (1 lb. 13 oz.) sliced peaches, and 16 oz. fresh strawberries (cut into blackberry size pieces). Also instead of sugar, I used 1 1/2 cups Splenda sweetener mixed with the fruit and then 1 1/2 tbls. Splenda brown sugar to sprinkle over the mixture before final baking. Much easier and fluffier when you make the dough in a mixer (on low setting), and for better dough flavor, add 1 tsp. cinnamon to the flour mixture. Deliciously served with Breyers chocolate chip ice cream. My entire family and I enjoyed thourougly!!

This is wonderful! My husband loves peach cobbler, I made this for him for Valentine's day and he now preferrs this to any other cobbler. I use frozen fruit, so have to bake it about 3 times longer initially (before adding the dough) but it turns out perfectly. Also added some almond flavoring to the dough... Oh, and this works perfectly well using soy milk instead of the regular cow milk. Yummy!

This was really delicious. The topping was so good, I am going to use that part of the recipe to make biscuits for strawberry short cake. I had to make a few small changes out of necessity. I was not able to find any fresh blackberries at a reasonable price, so I used frozen. Only half of my fresh peaches were ripe, so I substituted the rest of the peaches for my own home canned. I did not have any whole milk, so I used about a 1/2 cup heavy cream and the rest 1% milk in the topping. Other than using all fresh fruit, the only thing I'm going to do next time is cut back on the sugar just a little. It was slightly too sweet for my taste. This is definitely a "make again" dish.
