Made as written except for substituting equal amount of fresh tomatoes for 1 of the canned tomatoes. Served with halibut and haricot verts. It was delicious! Used a sturdy french baquette on top - The smaller slices made serving a single portion a little easier. Leftovers were surprisingly tasty reheated with fried eggs for breakfast. Nice change from the usual side dishes. Love the rustic look.

I substituted fresh yellow and orange tomatoes from the garden for the canned tomatoes. I just weighed them to equal 5 pounds. And I used garlic olive oil instead of butter. Oh my god! This was wonderful!

I totally "get" this recipe... and I'm from Minnesota! To me this is one of the ultimate comfort foods. I like it warm right off a fork, it's delicious cold too. Leftovers reheat well. If I'm looking for a big comfort meal I LOVE this with fried eggs and baked polenta with a crumble of blue cheese. I think some of you are over-thinking this.

Simply Fabulous. The first time we made this, e ended up serving this without the bread, almost like a bruschetta, and it got rave reviews from our guests. Absolutely delicious!

This is a wonderful recipe for baked tomatoes. Notice that all of the people who didn't "get it" are not from the South? Hrmm. Perhaps they wouldn't "get" collards with pepper vinegar, fried squash, or hoppin' john either. If you like simple Southern food, you'll love these tomatoes.

My family really liked this dish. It's easy and a good way to get some tomatoes in the 10-1/2 months of year when "real" ones are not available. We ate the leftovers the next night and they were just as good.

I totally "got it". I thought this was an amazing dish; simple, delicious, incredible subtle flavors. I've made this twice and consider it a new comfort food.

Good taste, but not interesting. Basically tomato/pizza sauce (therefore good with cheese on top!). Disappointing.

It's like upside-down Bruschetta! I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, but still prefer right side up 'Bruschetta'.

I made this for my wife last night and she loved it. I didn't have a large casserole dish, so I had to halve the recipe. My wife doesn't like allspice or thyme (picky, isn't she!?!), so I wound up using a 28-oz can of whole tomatoes and a 14.5- oz can of diced tomatoes with green chilis. It had a lot of flavor and paired great with the tilalia I served with it.

Pretty good but Lydia Bastianich's bread lasagna is better. Same premise though - add more herbs for a more flavorful dish.

I used olive oil instead of butter, and I topped the dish with mozarella and parmesean...

I somehow managed to buy 2 cans of whole tomatoes and 1 can of crushed tomatoes, and ultimately had to drain off some of the liquid. My own error aside, I think the recipe was a nice, easy side dish - nothing spectacular that I am dying to serve to guests, but a nice way to enjoy tomatoes at home with family.

I tend to agree with those who didn't really "get it." I'm a big fan of Edna Lewis and Scott Peacock, so I'm surprised. This was beautiful to make and serve (in a ceramic pie dish) but didn't set off fireworks for me. My guests liked it. I served it on New Year's Day along with ham, black eyed peas, collard greens, mac and cheese... maybe it got lost in the shuffle. I'll try it one more time.

I totally agree with the cook from Boston, this is nothing more that tomato sauce! Nothing amazing happened during the cooking process! What a waste of SanMarzano Tomatoes!

Surprisingly good and very easy. I would really give this 3.5/4 stars.

I don't get it. I made this exactly as written, and this dish doesn't end up being more than the sum of its parts. It tastes like a hum-drum tomato sauce with buttered toast on top. Not exciting, and it's not even that great as comfort food.

This dish was great the day I cooked it... and a million times better the next day with lunch! I can't recommend this dish enough, it will absolutely become one of my go-to side dishes. Cooked it just a week ago, and already can't wait to make it again.

Really good - husband didn't like though - he thought they were kind of blah, and said they tasted like canned tomatoes and bread.

Very good. Served with breaded tilapia and parmesan. Leftovers ( minus bread topping ). Will be a delicious pasta sauce.

Tried it last night and it was a hit - even with my husband who can't understand why I am always trying new things. I made a smaller version with only 1 can of the tomatoes. I left out the all- spice because I didn't have it at home. The flavor was really delicious - better than I had expected. You could probably make the tomatoes plain and serve with toast or cheese and crackers around it. Definitely try this one.

Just great. A wonderful way to have tomatoes in the winter.. warm and soothing and just slightly sweet.
