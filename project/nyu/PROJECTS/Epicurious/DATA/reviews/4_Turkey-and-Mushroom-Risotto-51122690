A tasty, hearty, one-dish dinner. I used short grain brown rice and it turned out really good, just a bit less creamy than traditional risotto. I also added a scant tablespoon of fresh chopped rosemary midway through cooking.

Really yummy! Despite only adding the turkey at the end (and using flavorful mushrooms), it still had a really pleasant and delicious turkey flavor. I also added a splash of dry white wine during the cooking for a little extra flavor. Definitely making again.

I had some extra raw chicken and I added it after the onions in the recipe. We loved it and will make it again

We were wondering what to do with turkey tonight, and this recipe appeared. I made it and it was delicious. Definitely a keeper. Something different for turkey leftovers.

made half the recipe and it was enough for 3 large portions. in hindsight, shoulda made the full recipe because we were fighting to see who got the last spoonful.

Made this last night and we all loved it. It's a keeper and probably a reason to have turkey even when it's not Thanksgiving. I followed the recipe and used turkey broth.
