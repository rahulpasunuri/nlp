I made the same ginger dressing as pattib7221 and added a couple of good dashes of sesame oil. Excellent. I had no scallops but shredded pre-cooked chicken made this fast and yummy

I have not tried this recipe as yet, but wanted to add that Newman's Own has a very good low fat Sesame Ginger dressing that I recommend.

Everyone seems to be looking for a ginger dressing recipe. Surprisingly, Wishbone makes a pretty decent Sesame & Ginger light vinagrette. It tastes close to some of the ginger dressings I've had in NYC Asian restaurants.

This is a really delicious and quick recipe. I've made it three times now and would like to add one small change. Today the store had no savoy cabbage but I had red cabbage at home. I salted the shredded cabbage to soften it (1 tsp kosher salt, 20 minutes, rinse and pat dry.) I liked it much better. The red cabbage has a slightly sweet flavor and the color looks great in the salad.

Would that be the Benihana salad dressing or the Benihana ginger dipping sauce? There is no Benihana ginger salad dressing at copykat.com

There are some ginger dressing recipes at this site. A nice lime -ginger or miso-ginger dressing would sound good. I plan to try this recipe tonight with 3 or 4 different dressings to find what's best.

For the ginger dressing I have found that VONG'S rosemary ginger dressing to be a superb dressing for all sorts of asian recipes. The dressing may be purchased at WILLIAMS-SONOMA.

This sounded like an interesting recipe but there is no explanation on how to make the ginger dressing. This is just an observation. If I had the recipe for the dressing I would love to try the recipe.
