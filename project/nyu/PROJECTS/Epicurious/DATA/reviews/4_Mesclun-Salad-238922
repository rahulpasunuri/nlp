This salad is always a hit. I do add thinly sliced red onion and mushrooms - more for presentation than for taste. Someone always asks for the recipe.

I couldn't find Mesclun. I even went to Whole Foods! I just picked up some green lettuce and used that since I'm weird with the bagged salad. The dressing was very light, lots of flavor and was the perfect next course after the main entree. Light and tasty.
