Excellent. I too, placed the smoked mozzarella on top and then into the oven to melt...lovely.

I changed nothing and this dish is extremely tasty--no extra salt needed!

Overall I thought this recipe was easy and good. I had to use white wine in place of the vermouth and I didn't add olives. I took previous cooks' suggestions and topped it with the mozzarella and put in the oven. Worked out very well and was easier to coordinate the dinner for guests.

I enjoyed this dish very much (and so did my guests, who all had seconds). I did deviate from the recipe a little. I roasted about a half-pound of cherry tomatoes with an eggplant (cut into pieces), some of the onion, olive oil, salt & pepper. Then I started sauteeing the other ingredients as directed, adding another full pound of cherry tomatoes. I added about 1/4 cup of red wine and about 3/4 cup of a commercial tomato pasta sauce. I added the roasted vegetables to the pot and let it all simmer while I cooked penne pasta. Thanks to the cook from Washington DC who suggested pouring the whole thing into a pyrex dish (big - 10 x 14), putting the cubes of smoked mozzarella on top, and putting it in the oven to melt -- delicious!

Made this twice. The first time it was good. The second time I left out the parsley and added Worcestershire sauce and sauteed zucchini. It was incredible! Would be good with any other combination of fresh veggies. The secret is using very fresh, good tomatoes - otherwise it will be bland and tasteless.

I somewhat enjoyed this dish. I am a huge cheese found but felt this was way to cheesy - I would cut down the amount of mozzarella buy about 1/2. Also - I didn't think there were enough olives but my husband thought too much. We thought it was okay but not good enough to make again.

I love this dish. I sometimes add some proscuitto for my meat loving husband, but it's delicious just as it is.

Very good dish. I could not find the smoked mozzarella so I used the regular, and I used fresh tortellini instead if dried. I like the olives yet found them too strong for delicate freshness of the dish. Also, the cheese cubes got clumped, so the second time I did it, I just poured the dish in a rectangular Pyrex dish, placed the cheese cubes on top, and let it melt in a hot oven.

This dish is very nice. I don't know why one would use cheese tortellini, however. I used campanelli instead, and if you use a nice, quality smoked mozzarella, it is wonderfully tasty.

This dish is very tasty. I do not use the mozzarella because there is enough cheese in the torellini. I have made it many times.

I love this dish. The smoked mozarella makes it. The combination of the tomatoes with the basil and olives is divine

I only used half a pound of mozzarella and added some extra vermouth because I couldn't use onions (my husband is allergic to them). It turns out absolutely fabulous every time. Friends and family ask for this dish when they come to visit.

We LOVED this dish. I added chicken, and my husband had two helpings. A great way to use fresh produce. You could always add a bit of chicken broth if you need more pizzaz in the sauce.

A pound of smoked mozzarela was overpowering. I'd like to try it again with a combining plain mizzarela with the smoked. Hopefully the flavor will be more subtle. Once you get past the clumps of cheese, it was tasty...

From the picture and the first reviews I thought this would have been fantastic - however it is just average. I did add sauted red pepper and mushrooms as another reviewer suggested which helped. I actually made it at the condo the night we arrived, and it was easy and quick but the flavors were "just ok".

This sounded so good, but I was very disappointed with the results. As other reviewers have noted, the sauce was rather bland. The parsley overpowered any other flavor that might have come through; I couldn't taste the smoked mozzarella at all. A waste of expensive ingredients, unfortunately.

most people i served this to came back for seconds, but i found it a bit lacking. like a previous cook indicated, the cheese got stringy and made a mess. many added salt and pepper. it *is* very easy to prepare, but less than thrilling overall.

My husband and I did not like this dish. The sauce was bland- I had to add lots of salt and pepper. The mozzarella chunks melted and formed clumps of cheese mixed with onion... I would not make this again.

This was tasty but not a rave in our house. Nobody was crazy about smoked cheese with regular cheese tortellini. It's a nice idea--sauce with reduced wine or liquor, savory goodies, and tortellini. But you don't really need a recipe--can probably do just as well using what you have on hand.

This is a great recipe. It is also wonderful to make additions to it. I added fresh spinach and red bell pepper. Also, I used half mozzarella and half smoked gouda. Very good and very easy.

This was fantastic and a huge hit when I made it for dinner guests. I served it with some crusty bread, mixed green salad and an easy drinking red. I did substitute white wine for the dry vermouth (didn't have any on hand) and used fresh mozzarella because I could not find smoked mozzarella anywhere. This was definitely a keeper.

WONDERFUL. My dinner guests raved. The flavors are fresh and yet rich at the same time. An extremely satisfying dish. I served it with garlic bread and a salad. One small recommended modification: I found the 1/2" cubes of mozzarella a bit large, I would suggest maybe 1/4" cubes.

Excellent recipe and very easy. I also couldn't find smoked mozzarella like the previous reviewer. I used half smoked gouda and half brie which is what I had on hand, and it was great. I also added an extra clove of garlic.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, and it was outstanding. I would make this again any day. I made a half recipe and it fed 3 with *plenty* of leftovers (probably would have fed 5 or so).

I changed the receipe somewhat - I used sweet peppers instead of tomatoes, shallots instead of onions, and added mushrooms. I also couldn't find smoked mozzarella anywhere, so I put in smoked gouda - delicious!! Husband says it's in the top 10, and its very easy to make - I served it with a chianti and some dark rustic bread, which rounded it out to a perfect romantic meal.
