Add some honey and don't add the salt as noted - the soy provides enough salty flavor. Also, if you like a kick, add some hot pepper flakes.

excellent all-purpose dipping sauce. We made it for the tempura sugar snap peas and it was a perfect accompaniment. We've used it for all sorts of dim sum, dumplings, and wontons since.

This stuff is great. We have used with dungeness crab, shrimp, spring rolls and vegetables. It's also easy to make .
