A really great simple sauce. Subtle tastes. Maybe go a bit generous on the dijon. Takes a bit of time for reduction, but the longer the better. It says to "boil" but suggest a soft rolling boil/simmer instead. The mustard seeds are not necessary. Will make it a 'go to sauce' for my dishes

This was terrific. I read the other reviews and then made a dish with leftover smoked ham and smoked turkey. Made the sauce, added the diced meat and frozen peas and some tomatoes, and served over fettuccine. Wonderful. The mustard seeds give a nice texture to the dish but don't worry if you don't have them.

I've made this recipe a million times. I take a whole chicken, cover it with oil, tarragon, salt and pepper, then throw it on the grill. Serve the chicken with this sauce and everyone goes wild. The trick is to simmer the sauce forever to bring out the flavors. Also be sure to use a good lager.

What a delicious sauce, I did add a bit of sugar because it seemed like it needed something, but what a hit for my family. All of the plates were licked clean.

I just love this recipe...I add tarragon as well and mushrooms which make it very rich but I also serve over chicken parmesan and rice or buttered noodles...and a light salad makes it a great meal!

This sauce is great, but it needs some adjustments. A little sugar did a great deal, but I'm still not quite satisfied. It lacks something... But by all means, it made my boyfriend quiet, made me happy and I'll make it again. Until then I'll be thinking of what to add to make it delicious...

Deliciously delicious ! And so easy to make. I cooked it according to the recipe and meanwhile I slightly fried 8 chicken steaks, then I mixed them with the sauce and cooked for another 30 minutes. Fingerlick. I kept some leftovers in the fridge and I must say that the next day the sauce was even more delicious.

The sauce is divine...I use it on boneless chicken breasts too. The secret seems to be to really boil the devil out of it after the additions of the beer and stock. When pushed for time, have also reduced the amount of stock to 2 cups.

I really liked the sauce I thought it was delicious. It did take a while to prepare with all the reducing but I started it way before the pork tenderloin to make sure I had enough time and then I just kept it warm until the pork was done.

I wanted to make this dish with ingredients I had on hand. I used green cabbage instead of red, and some fresh cranberries. I enjoyed the cabbage side dish very much. It turned a lovely rosy pink color after the cranberries popped. I think the sweet/bitterness of the cranberries complemented the cabbage, probably more than raspberries would anyway. I also substituted the raspberry vinegar with apple cider vineger, and I recommend you julienne the apple slices for better consistency. Also, the mustard cream sauce was very tasty, but I would thicken a little with a beurre manie the next time. Also, did not have any mustard seeds, but did not seem to miss them.

After 40 minutes of reducing, this sauce still wasn't fully reduced or even saucy. Very disappointing. Too much work for a weak result.

I have Made this several times and everytime it's a real hit. I use "Samuel Adams" Lager and fat free half/half. I also strain out the onions so that it is totally creamy except for the mustard seeds, which I add JUST before serving.

I was disappointed with the sauce. So much work..not enough taste. This dish is served at the Red Hen, Medford, N.J. Identical recipe was in Philadelphia Inquirer.

This smelled awful, took too long for a weeknight dinner and had the kids running in the opposite direction! Flavorless.

i too used the wine, but other than that adhered to the recipe. in a flat pan it cooked down well. however , at the end, i felt it didn't have enough "zing" so i added more mustard, and some rough grated black peppercorns. a bit better but still needed something to give it a bit of identity. i served it with chicken breast and rice. was good, but i expected more.

I've tried this sauce twice. The beer adds a bitter after-taste. Try it with white wine, vermouth or nothing and I think you will be very happy. You can't miss with good chicken stock, shallots,a dash of mustard, cream & s/p (salt and pepper).

The pork was great but the sauce had a slightly bitter taste. I would try the medallions with the sauce from the seared tuna with mushroom cream sauce recipe. Epicurious is THE BEST recipe site!

This was very good. I even made it using evaporated skim milk instead of the cream to cut down the fat and it was still very flavorful with a nice creamy texture.

This was delicious! Absolutely wonderful, even though I had to alter the recipe. I didn't have shallots, so I used 2 tbsp yellow onion and 2/3 clove garlic both thinly sliced, then very finely chopped. Also had no dijon mustard, so substituted spicy brown and omitted mustard seeds. Next time I'll try to the white wine idea instead of beer, it might be more mellow - the beer gave it a hint of a bitter edge. Served by pouring over baked salmon, then garnishing with a few capers. My husband said this sauce "made" the meal!

I substituted white wine for the beer and this was delicious. One trick however: after the cream reduces for a while, I whisked in approximately two tsp. arrowroot dissolved in a couple of tablespoons of white wine. Within seconds, this thickened the sauce up to a lovely consistency. Then, I added mustard and it was delicious. Highly recommended!

This is fabulous! Takes a while but worth the effort. Exquisite with flank steak and salmon.

Wow! We loved this sauce. I didn't have any beer so substituted white wine and it was fantastic. I reduced it for quite a lot longer than indicated in the recipe which resulted in a nice, thick sauce. Served it with the pork medallions the first night which was good. Used the leftovers on poached trout which was fantastic. Will definately make again.

This did not reduce quite as well as hoped, so I thickened at the last minute with a little cornstarch paste. However, it got rave reviews at Thanksgiving. My brother-in-law actually kneeled and kissed my hand. I guess you could say he liked it.

DELICIOUS!! This sauce is a keeper. Everything you would want in a mustard cream sauce-the beer adds depth and the mustard seeds add a nice crunch to the texture. Serve it with chicken, pork or shrimp. Great over rice as well. Make sure you allow time to reduce the sauce though-as others say, it takes a lot longer than the recipe states. I suggest making it the nice before and gently reheating the day of. Sure to be a hit!

EXCELLENT - I made it with the pork tenderloins, but I'd try it with chicken also.

My husband liked it more than I did... I found that the mustard seeds added a crunchiness that I didn't like, and the sauce itself was kind of bland.

Made this for the 1st time tonight..no mustard seeds on hand, so left them out. I served it with pan-roasted chicken breasts and it was great. The family loved it and thought it was worth having again. Cooking time seemed a little longer than the recipe indicated...a lot of reduction involved. Next time I'll make the sauce a day ahead.

This sauce is out of this world! Was not crazy about the pork so I will serve it with other meats.

I make a lot of sauces, but this one ranks near the top! Pork tenderloins, chicken or veal, they all work, also I use the sauce over rice.
