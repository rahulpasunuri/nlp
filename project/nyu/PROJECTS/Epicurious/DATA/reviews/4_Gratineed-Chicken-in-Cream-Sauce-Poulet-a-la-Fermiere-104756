Absolutely loved this chicken recipe. The gruyere smell was a little bit strong but the flavor was amazing. This dish took no time at all to put together, the potatoes were amazing I added them with the carrots and got a bit of color on them. Leftovers the next day were even better.

This was delicious! It took longer to make than one hour, but that's probably because my frying pan only had room to cook 3 thighs at a time. I would use a bit more wine, broth and cream next time. The broth was fantastic soaked up in a crusty bun!

This dish was superb and I actually was very impressed that it was done in an hour, prep and cooking...all of it. I actually made this and served it over a bit of wide egg noodles. I just thought the sauce would be nice with noodles. It was a bit overkill b/c of the potatoes so next time I might leave the potatoes out or put in less. But still delish!!

It is basically a deconstructed chicken pot pie and instead of pie crust it's cheese. Very average- lacked depth and interest. Good for a cold winter night in for the family but not good enough to serve to company.

Delicious, easy chicken stew. Next time I'll omit the potatoes as they seemed out of place in this dish (and we're potato lovers) and I'll add quartered mushrooms. Nice subtle flavors - comfort food.

I used 2 lbs of chicken with 1/2 of everything else except no potatoes and one pound of frozen green beans. It was a perfect one pan dinner dish. Even cutting all else in half left tons of sauce. It was an easy dinner.

I thought this was excellent. I halved the recipe but doubled the wine and broth. Used shallots instead of frozen onions and chopped the herbs. Added less of the Gruyere so it wasn't so cheesy but wouldn't exclude it in the future - adds another wonderful layer of taste to the dish.

I love this recipe. I do make a couple of small changes. I use boneless chicken thighs and cut them up. When I made if for my 9 year old niece, I left out the onion. She even had seconds. I also add mushrooms. Wonderful meal on a chilly day.

Anyone who actually follows this recipe will have success and agree it is one of the most delicious things they have ever eaten. Something I do to improve it though, is to cool the chicken enough to handle it and take it off the bone. Then replace it and finish up with the final step of the gratin.

This dish was absolutely heavenly. I made a mistake and then had to alter the recipe a little but no matter as this dish was beyond divine. First off, I accidently forgot to toss the onions and carrots in the fat before deglazing but no matter, I added them and then tossed as indicated. Secondly I forgot that the pan I was using doesn't have a lid which fits so I used two lids and foil but I ended up losing alot of moisture so I had to keep adding chicken stock. Lastly because I had so much stock left after the second simmering that I ended up using all of the creme fraiche (which was about 3/4 cup) instead of just 2/3. It was gorgeous anyway and both my husband and I couldn't wait until we could have leftovers the next day!

I made this recipe as written and I guess I'm the only one who thought it was really greasy. And, much as I love Gruyere cheese, I didn't think it really added to this recipe. I subsequently adapted the recipe using boneless skinless chicken thighs and a small bit of cream (1 Tbsp.) rather than creme fraiche and no cheese - and I like it much better that way.

My whole family (hubby and three kids) loved this recipe. I used dried herbs because I did not feel like going out and I used two leeks instead of frozen onions. I also replaced creme friache with half sour cream and half cream. Wonderful!!!

Rating: 3
A little fussy but surprisingly easy to make given that it was a one pot recipe. After reading the other reviews I also substituted sour cream for creme fraiche (not stocked at my market) and used smoked Gruyeres instead of regular. Pay attention to the suggestion to brown chicken in batches. Given the liquids it is important to start with very brown chicken that isn't done through. Going with 3 forks only because I think it takes the substitutions made to give it a distinctive flavor profile, otherwise it would be mild. Served with sea salt crusted french bread which was delicious and my wife compared it to chicken pot pie (without the pie).

Nice easy recipe. I did put some chicken breast but took them out earlier than the rest so that they did not dry out and added them back at the end. Pre-cooked the potatoes and also added more liquid. Used comte cheese and fresh cream as that was all I had in the fridge. Will make again.

I don't get the 4-fork reviews. After reading the list of ingredients - I assumed maybe the cheese would be the flavor factor for this dish because nothing else stood out as flavorful. Instead, this was bland and sweet, and the sweetness ruined the taste of the cheese.

Love this recipe! I changed one step and instead of making a bouquet garni I used Herbs of Provence. Super yummy!!

This will be my new dinner party dish. A one pot meal that is out of this world (yet, so easy!!). I used chicken legs and chose to braise them with the fixins' for about an hour as opposed to cooking them on the hob. I also just threw the herbs directly in the mix (use flat leaf parsley). I had no problems with a thin sauce as described by others which was a relief. I also par-boiled the potatoes and added them with some green beans to the braising chicken for the last 5-10 minutes, sprinkled with cheese and that was it! Simply amazing. A very rustic, gorgeous and delicious meal.

I halved the chicken and vegetables, excluded the peas but kept everything else the same which I'm glad because it allowed us to have more of the wonderful sauce. Make sure you like the taste of the Gruyere as it is the strongest flavour. I added my potatoes in with the carrots and onions (I used french shallots) and luckily I did as they were just cooked, if I had put them in later they wouldn't have cooked.I also kept the herbs in the dish.

well, I love how sweet hte carrots are at the end, and I env made some changes, I added sherry vinegar instead of wine, and it's delicious, all of you should try it that way, not much, just a bit of vinegar before adding hte bouquet garni

Rating: 4
This was very tasty. My store doesn't have creme fraiche, so I just used some cream and a dollop of sour cream and it was still really good (next time I will think ahead a bit more and make the creme fraiche at home). I just used chicken thighs for this dish because they're so flavorful. I didn't bother making a bouquet garni, just chopped the herbs and put them in. I used quite a bit more thyme than just two sprigs. Around 1 teaspoon of the leaves, maybe a bit more. Next time, I will add a lot more potatoes and I think I'll just use onion slivers instead of the fresh pearl onions I used. Having a big hunk of onion on my plate is not my thing. Overall this was VERY easy and reasonably quick (the gruyere is a nice touch), and hey! It's a one- pot, one-dish meal! What more can you ask for?

Rating: 3
I made this recipe for one - quartered the chicken and veggies, but kept liquids at full recipe. I did have a lot of sauce, but found that the liquid was needed to properly braise the meat and veggies. Lovely flavors - I will now use it for informal company with crusty bread and a light salad.

i've never written a review in many years of using epicurious, but this recipe demands it! How fabulous! this is one of the best chicken recipes i've ever made, and was a huge hit with all age groups. it will now be a weekday fall-back for me, and i can't get enough of those! thanks epicurious.

This recipe worked incredibly well! Try using white zinfandel instead of white wine. I had no choice the night i made this, as it was the only non-red wine I had in house. It gave the dish a whiff of sweetness that really balanced out the creamy rich deliciousness of this dish. Of course serve this with good wine, and let that be the "secret" ingredient your guests will never figure out!

Rating: 4
I choose Epicurious recipes first based on my own preferences, then on the reviews, and this one I had to try. Everyone raved, and one of my 9 guests said it was the best thing I'd ever served them. Used bonesless thighs, half and half, and fresh pearl onions - a breeze to peel if you boil them for 30-60 seconds, then rinse w. cold water. Also small redskin potatoes, quartered. Did a tart salad of beets and oranges and fig/meyer lemon vinegar - perfect contrast.

Awesome recipe! No need to broil at the end. I just cranked the oven and turned on the convection fan. I was afraid my ceramic gratin dish would crack under the broiler but skipping that part didn't hurt the dish at all! My kids love this and it's so pretty and easy that I've served it for dinner parties. I get rave reviews and I also get to enjoy my own party. Another plus, only one dish to wash

We made this for a dinner party of 8, doubled the recipe, and asked the butcher to french cut two whole chickens, and two extra breasts (which gave us two pieces for leftovers and a lot of vegetables in cream sauce for tonight) instead of the thighs and drumsticks which were called for. I added about a cup more wine and stock than the recipe called for and cooked it longer (on a lower temp) resulting in chicken that was falling off of the bones. For our guests, we did not add the gruyere cheese and broil (due to logistical issues), but it wasn't needed. Am going to make again this weekend--it was that good!

This recipe is wonderful. It has subtle and simple tastes which makes it a great 'anytime' dish.

I served this dish with a salad and plenty of crusty bread to soak up the savory liguid. I will definitely make this recipe again.

I started making this recipe in 2004 and I still get requests/raves from family and friends to make this dish. It's simple peasant food, yet tastes more complicated. The recipe works great as is, but I did make small changes; light cream instead of creme fraiche, regular onions instead of pearl, and boneless chicken thighs as I do not like the bones. I consider this one of the best chicken stew recipes I have ever made.

Very good, my husband and his friend loved it! I didn't add all of the vegetables (none of the carrots, peas, potatoes and cheese) since I wanted the chicken to be served as an accompaniment to a cauliflower and potato gratin, and it still came out delicious. I used what I had on hand that night: chicken breasts instead of drumsticks, half a red onion, beef broth and whipping cream. Then I poured more liquid than recommended (1 cup white wine and 1 cup broth) and let the chicken simmer longer... I'll make this recipe again, probably using lamb instead of chicken next time.

Rating: 4
Actually a pretty easy and hearty dinner. I cut the creme fraiche to a scant 1/2 cup and it was still a creamy and rich sauce. Paired with a mushroom risotto, it was great with a fruity chardonnay. Portions were enormous cooked as written; with a little more chicken this would feed 6 easily (without increasing vegetables). I also used quartered red potatoes- skin on- (as smaller weren't available) and it was perfect.

I would rate this recipe 3 1/2 forks. After making it a few times it narrowed it down to this; wash and DRY the chicken well. Add salt and pepper to some flour and lightly dust the chicken in the flour. Fry in HOT oil/butter as recommemded. Brown chicken throughly all over then remove from pan. Pour off some, but not all, of the fat, leaving 2-3 Tbls. Brown your carrots and onions very well, until they are golden. Triple the amount of wine and broth mixture, add some finely chopped herbs such as sage and rosemary, and let the mixture cook down, without the chicken. (I found that I would get a crisp skin on the chicken only to have it get soggy fromo the continued simmering of the broth) Once the wine/stock mixture is thickened and tasty, add the chicken pieces and cook for only 5-10 minutes more, uncovered. P.S. I added canned artichoke hearts and fingerling potatoes to the simmering broth in the last 15-20 minutes. As for whether the chicken is done or not, if you thorougly brown the chicken in the beginning it really doesn't need any more that that.

I made this with reduced fat sour cream in lieu of creme fraiche, and I accidentally cooked the chicken through instead of just browning it. It was still super moist and the sauce really was so good. I will certainly make this again! It was a crowd pleaser.

I read every review before making this dish, because I didn't trust the cooking time for the potatoes. So I put the potatoes in with the carrots and onions. Well, like many others I wanted to let the sauce cook longer than the recipe called for, and as a result the potatoes simply cooked down to mashed and thickened the sauce. It still tasted great, but I would do it different next time, maybe have potatoes on the side, or wait until the sauce thickens quite a bit before adding them. This time I am trying the recipe with canned artichoke hearts and large onions quartered. making potatoes on the side. Also used twice the amount of wine and stock and just let the sauce simmer. Yummy.

This recipe appears in the new Gourmet cookbook, which is supposed to feature the best of the best, and between that and the glowing reviews on this site, I was expecting something magnificent. I was disappointed. The sauce was tasty, but overall, I thought the vegetables were uninteresting, tasting almost as boring as the frozen ones my mother used to buy by the bagful when I was a child. I even used fresh pearl onions, so it was a surprise to have the vegetables come out so blah.

This is a great dish. I had to make the following changes the first time I made it due to what I had on hand at the time, and received raves. I get requests to make this dish and have found that it can be easily doubled for a dinner party. The changes I made were that I used cream instead of creme fraiche, I just cut an onion into chunks instead of using pearl onionsm and I also used just boneless chicken thighs.

I'm going to try this soon but just wanted to ask why creme fraiche is so hard to get in America? It's available pretty much everywhere in England, and the half-fat version is pretty much an essential in my fridge. Also was amused to read that carrots with the tops on are more European!!

Delicious! Worked well with skin on, bone-in chicken breasts, but will try with the dark meat next time. Couldn't find frozen onions, so blanched and peeled pearl onions which worked great. Used sour cream instead of the creme fraiche, and mushrooms instead of the peas---Wonderful! The potatoes took longer to cook so I would add them sooner next time. Loved the gruyerre broiled on top! Crusty french bread was the perfect compliment, and necessary to sop up every last drop of that incredible sauce.

Delicious! I added a couple of chicken breasts, left out the frozen onions and did not add the cheese. I also cooked this meal in the oven at 350 for an 'additional' 1/2hr. My family loved it.. even our fussy children. A one dish homemade tasty meal.

WONDERFUL!! I added much more wine, spices and creme fraiche. I also added french green beans and used purple potatoes for color. And baby carrots with the stems and squash blossoms to give it a european look and give my guests more veggie choices. My guests also request it and think it must be so difficult. C'est magnifique!!

This was excellent, and actually looked great when it was plated up (due to using very small potatoes and petit pois)! I pre-boiled the potatoes, and added lots of fresh tarragon as garnish at the end. Also, I didn't use the gruyere; this was rich enough already without it. I served it with crusty bread and a simple salad of round lettuce, thin sliced onion, and red grapes.

Good winter comfort food. Addition of Gruyere gave it a nice twist. I tried an Alouette brand of crème fraiche and it was expensive and not very good (plastic aroma flavor)so next time will likely use heavy cream if I don't have time to make my own. Will also use the peas frozen as they were a bit over cooked for me. Substituted dried thyme (no fresh from my garden in February in Ohio)

I loved this and I have 3 teenage boys who all gobbled it up. I put it over white rice cooked in chicken broth but it really could be a one dish meal. I needed a huge amount so I put it into two large pyrex dishes for the broiler step. It worked beautifully. I used heavy cream instead of cream fraiche and I think I'll use light cream next time.

I'm certainly in the minority here! Just wasn't overly impressed with this. The creme fraiche/guyere combination didn't appeal to me flavor-wise and the frozen onions didn't do much for me either. I probably won't make this again as I have a similar recipe for a clay pot that is incredible but ... if I did I would subsititute cream for the creme fraiche, use fresh onions and add mushrooms in place of the potatoes. I wanted so badly to love this but just didn't.

Rating: 3
I will definitely be making this again... my husband also loved it. I used boneless / skinless thighs, but about half the amount called for and probably made up for the difference with extra vegetables. I also used fresh sliced onions, and extra wine and chicken broth... which I reduced more than was called for. The creme fraiche recipe from this site worked great even though I was uneasy with the idea of leaving cream out uncovered. The flavor of this dish was delicate and simple and qualifies as "comfort food."

Very, very good. Will make it again as it was very easy and very tasty. I omitted the peas as I am not a pea girl and added more chicken stock and reduced it for more intense flavour.

Second Review: Love this recipe. Easy to prepare, no complex ingredients, can be done ahead (up to adding the cream), tastes great, looks beautiful, and there's only one pan to clean! I used bonless/skinless thighs, which I salted, peppered and floured before browning. Probably used over a cup of wine, and let it reduce down. The secret to this dish is to keep the amount of liquid very low, simply add heavy cream at the end, simmer for a few minutes more, and you'll get a nice, velvety sauce. I add some sauteed mushrooms along with the peas. Serve with rice pilaf and a nice green salad and a burgandy wine.

The sauce was incredible! I'm not sure all the reviews are doing it justice! I agree that in comparison, the chicken seemed a bit bland. I used boneless skinless thighs, and maybe you just need the skin for this recipe. Will play with that, but would definitely make again! Used sour cream, but I found a recipe for creme fraiche on this site.....uses whipping cream and buttermilk, much more affordable than the stuff I couldn't find in the store anyway. Look in the food dictionary for that.

pretty good. i couldn't find small potatoes at my local fancy "whole foods" market (??? very strange) so i used yukon gold instead. and i added turnips as well. the other thing i changed is that i added the potatoes along with the onions and carrots, because i was worried that they wouldn't cook all the way through. i probably wouldn't do that again, though it did make the sauce nice and thick. the sauce was really really tasty, the best part -- in fact i used too much bay leaf, but i still liked it. however, the chicken didn't seem to absorb as much flavor as i had hoped. and the one thing that surprised me, after starting the recipe, was that the description says that the recipe contain's a farmwife's bounty, but the recipe uses frozen onions and frozen peas. ha! :-) i think when i do it again, i'll use fresh onions, because the frozen ones didn't have much flavor.

This is a great dish! Delicious and easy to cook in just the one pot on the stove-top. We improvised with the dried herbs we had already (parsley and sweet basil), and sloshed in double the wine. The flavours were lovely, but quite subtle. Because our pot wouldn't go under the broiler, we put the cheese in at the end and replaced the lid for a few minutes: it melted beautifully, but the dish would also be nice without it. The leftovers (with the chicken shredded) made a great pasta sauce!

Great recipe. I substituted the peas with fresh sliced mushrooms, and used 1/3 c. sour cream with 1/3 c. cream for the Creme Fraiche.

This was yummy! I have never had the bravery to try to use crème fraîche, after all leaving cream at room temperature? I made 2 batches of it, one left about 20 hours and then in the fridge, the other at only 8 hours. The one in the fridge is the consistency of marshmellow fluff! Using the thicker version would have been spectacular. As it was, all these flavors were just right. I cooked the potatoes along with the carrots, and added fresh mushrooms, skipping the onions (I am onion intolerant) and I would not have a clue whether my bay leaves are from Georgia or Sweden. Absolutely perfect, would make a spectacular guest recipe, wondering how much can be done in advance.

Great recipe, very easy to make and not too time consuming! I used a mixture of frozen peas and pearl onions (3cups) as I think 2 cups of pearl onions alone is too much. Would highly recommend this for a Sunday lunch.

The fresh flavor in this dish is fantastic! My husband can not wait for the occasion to make it again. I did not use the creme in the sauce either.

Made this for my husband's birthday, and he liked it a lot. The only problem was I couldn't find the creme fraiche, and didn't have time to make my own. I just used cream. Try using dental floss to tie up the bouquet garni, but be sure it is not cinnamon or mint flavored! Cut the potatoes small.

Your food editors can choose my dinners anytime! This is a great dish. I agree,imported bay leaves give a dish a completely different taste-not the medicinal flavor of the Bay Laurel we have in California.

Loved this recipe! The sauce is wonderfully rich, but not too complicated. Simple and quick to make. And it tastes wonderful!

Fabulous! A definite keeper. The only change we made was using dried thyme and a 'California' bay leaf. Served with a small salad this is a perfect meal for any occasion.

I used non-fat sour cream in the recipe. And substituted Jarlsburg cheese. I also used fresh baby onions. And, the chicken we used was skinned and boned. Because of these changes, I don't know what it was supposed to taste like, but the result was fabulous. The sauce is rich, but not too rich, and was appreciated by the adults and children alike.

Superb indeed! In answer to the previous reviewer who wondered how to make the recipe without the creme fraiche, I intended to add it but completely forgot - and it turned out perfectly without it. Also, I used fresh pearl onions instead of frozen. Also, I used lowly California bay leaves and the boneless, skinless breasts I had on hand and it was devine nonetheless. Alongside, I served aspargus and hollandaise sauce(using the recipe from the same issue) and a salad of baby greens with lemony poppyseed vinaigrette (from the Silverpalate cookbook). Definitely a keeper.

Fabulously delicious!

This is a lovely and lively version of a french classic, one we will keep. As for it's richness, well, as we say in the South, "No cross, no crown." However, luckily the legs and thighs are more forgiving than the breasts and ca be browned without their skin. Keep the creme fraiche and strip the meat. (But save the skins for stock.)

Excellent dish - it was easy to make, and it is definately a 'comfort food!' The sauce is VERY rich, however, so be warned!

My favorite part of the chicken is the dark meat and this recipe really does it justice. The previous reviewer is correct in suggesting a longer cooking time. I used fresh small onions instead of the frozen and also would suggest putting the potatoes in the pan when you add the chicken back in. I hated to add the creme fraiche, but it really did make the sauce. I can't wait to see the suggestions of other cooks on how to keep the flavor without using this ingredient, perhaps some no fat sour cream? Great flavors in this recipe.
