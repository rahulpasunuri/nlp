Simply gorgeous. I didn't have (and don't particularly care for) raisins, so I used dried cherries. Amazing.

This was fantastic and went perfectly with the accompanying veal chops recipe. Also served with toasted pine nut couscous. I substituted currants for the golden raisins, and omitted capers (don't like them). If you have the time, make the roasted peppers yourself...the fresh flavor and softer texture (compared to jarred peppers) is really nice.

I followed this recipe except that I bought roasted red bell peppers in a jar, drained them of the oil, and made the recipe mostly as written. I made one more change: I left out the capers because I don't prefer them. By using bought roasted red bell peppers, I cut down on the work. The recipe was a big hit.

This is so yummy. I served it on top of "Chicken Bundles" for a ladies Christmas luncheon. A big hit!
