This is nothing special in my opinion. It really didn't do much for the pasta it goes with. I will not make it again.

O.M.G.. This was delicious, and it is ridiculously simple. We had it with the Thai curry dish, which was pretty good, but made great by the Chutney. I've been thinking up new ways to use it all week. My first experiment may involve a turkey burger.

My chinese friend says that it's a little too acidic and my other friend who's from CA says that it's pretty good but I don't really have an opinion either way. I added about twice as mush ginger as the recipe called for. All and all, it is a necessity for Thai curry penne dish.

Excellent chutney! Made it to accompany the Thai penne dish. I will definitely need to double the chutney next time because it was such a hit!

This chutney is fabulous, and so easy to make.
