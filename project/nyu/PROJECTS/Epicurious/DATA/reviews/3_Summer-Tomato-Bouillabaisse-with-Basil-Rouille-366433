Awesome and very easy. All my hungry teenagers loved it.Use less water by about half and more wine.

Pretty tasty, and pretty easy to make. I made the rouille earlier in the day so it all came together very quickly. I followed the other posters and reduced the water to 2 cups and I felt that was more than generous, even after removing the shellfish and boiling the sauce for a couple of minutes to reduce the flavor. The rouille and the bread make this meal as the bright flavor perks up everything else. My guests ate extra bread with rouille after the shellfish was long gone.

You definitely need the bread and rouille to make this a filling meal. Overall very tasty and I could concur with the poster before about water. Just use 2 cups of water and you maintain all the flavor and have enough water to boil the shellfish in. Also, for those of you who can't eat mayo, I substituted the mayo in this recipe for low-fat sour cream and the rouille still came out marvelous!

This was a light, flavorful restaurant quality dish, with 1 critical change to the recipe. DO NOT ADD 4 cups water to the broth. Add only 2, or soup will have no flavor. The rouille is fabulous!

This recipe looked so good. Even though I thought it was odd that the recipe called for adding 4 cups of water, I wanted to follow it as written the first time. Well, I should have followed my instincts. The water completely diluted the wonderful flavor of the clams, mussels and tomato in this dish. It was so watery and a real disappointment. If I make this again, I will only add about 1 cup of water (it that). And I will also halve the tomatoes (wasn't a fan of whole cherry tomatoes in bouillabaisse). The basil rouille on toasted bread was delicious though.
