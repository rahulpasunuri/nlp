The flavors in this work really well together, and it was a huge hit with a couple of my more particular foodie friends. While it is time consuming to prepare, it's an ideal meal for a dinner party because so much can be done in advance, leaving more time to spend relaxing with your guests because all you have to do is grill the lamb and finish the vegetables while it rests. I followed the recipe exactly except I also prefer to leave the bones on the lamb, so I covered just the bones with foil to prevent too much charring on the grill.

I give this recipe an "exceptional" review.. BUT you really must be in the mood to cook when you choose this entree. This recipe takes some time and is a bit tedious to execute; however, the end result is delicious. It would be great to figure out a shortcut to get these marvelous flavors but the time and the labor of love probably can't be compromised here. Save this one for a special occasion for a lamb lover!

Really good flavor. Grapes took a little longer to roast. The veggies were amazing. Quite a bit of work...probably two hours of solid work.

Great taste. Make the reductions way ahead of time as they seem to take longer than the recipe suggests. The roasted grapes for the gremolata are not necessary. To save time and effort just roast the cut up cauliflower, halved brussel sprouts, and halved or whole small potatoes together at 425 for 30 minutes. Sprinkle with olive oil before roasting. Shake the pan at 15 minutes. I combined the curry butter with the roasted vegetables in a bowl not a pan. They were warm enough without dirtying another pan. Great meal for guests.

A labor-intensive recipe, but worth it. Excellent, restaurant-quality fare.

this was an absolutely delicious meal. Probably one of the best I've made. I followed the recipe exactly other than I used tiny sweet potatoes as I wasn't able to find fingerling potatoes. I think I'd actually do that again as they were very good. I also left the meat on the rack just because I prefer the look. The sauce was a perfect flavour and consistency, the vegetables had just the right curry flavour and the gremelota was very interesting in flavour and texture. The instructions on preparing the vegetables made for very nice looking veggies. And best of all everything was done in the afternoon and only the meat needed to be cooked at meal time - just a quick heating of veggies and sauce. No unusual ingredients either - everything easily available at your local market. The perfect meal. This will definitely be made again.
