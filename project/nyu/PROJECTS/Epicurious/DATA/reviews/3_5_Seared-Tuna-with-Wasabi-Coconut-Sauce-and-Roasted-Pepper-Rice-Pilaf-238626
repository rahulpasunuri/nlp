My husband and I made this last night for dinner and found it to be very simple and tasty. We used the wasabi powder and it turned out to be a very good compliment to the (rare) tuna, we chose not to use sesame seeds. The rice was very simple as well. I made the rice using fresh duck stock (I made myself) and that gave the rice lots of flavor. In sauteing the spinach, I added both fresh sliced crimini mushrooms and chopped garlic. Very, Very Tasty.

Lone dissenter I guess. The sauce ended up having an odd bitter taste. Used wasabi powder if that matters. The rice pilaf was more work than expected too.

Coated tuna with black/white sesame seeds before I seared it. Wasabi sauce is incredible. Made rice pilaf with raw spinach. Used coconut as a condiment (excellent accent). It was a very mellow dish but we kept going back for more, especially the wasabi sauce, which I made very spicy.

Great recipe! You can offer a wonderful dinner with it and it doesn't take too much of your time. I substituted the rice for brown rice and would not cook the spinach, but add it raw to the rice. I also added sesame seeds to coat the ahi tuna but it did not add any taste but made a nice presentation.

This is a great seared tuna! The coconut milk and wasabi salsa make it perfect! I made medium grain brown rice instead for the pilaf and did not added sugar in the salsa, even if the coconut milk I use is unsweetened. I also coated the tuna steaks with sesame seeds using sesame oil, what did not add any special flavor but made the steaks crunchy outside. The combination of the rice pilaf and seared tuna is awesome, and I also steamed green beans to serve aside. It is a perfect dinner to serve for friends as it demands from you only few minutes in the kitchen before you serve it (make the roasted pepper and spinach ahead and you will be in good shape to enjoy your friends). :)

This is excellent an easy, esp if you make the spinach and red pepper early in the day. Possibly, they left out the part where you put the pepper in a bag for 15 min and then peel it which I did anyway. Like another reviewer, I used wasabi paste instead of the powder and sugar. I did a taste test between the two and found the premade paste was better than the batch made with the powder. I just added the paste until I got the flavor I wanted. Also, I made twice the sauce.

Wow! The coconut wasabi sauce is fabulous. This sauce is so much better than wasabi by itself. The coconut milk gives it a cocnutty richness and it's so easy. I had wasabi paste rather than the powder and just kept addiing until it was spicy enough for us. We like it hot. The rice was delish too. I used more spinach than called for just because I like it. This is a restaurant quality dish,
