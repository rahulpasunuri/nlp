This is a keeper! Followed recipe exactly. Meanwhile made mushroom risotto and broccoli to accompany. Paired with a Central Coast Pinot Noir, it was a perfect meal. Definately a "Do again" dinner.

Wow! This recipe does not disappoint. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added some merquen (Chilean spice)and it came out delicious! The skin is so crispy, you would think it's fried. Definitely will make this again.

Quick and easy. Yes, use a splatter guard and open the doors and windows for a bit.The only drawback is that the neighborhood stray cats were wailing because of the delicious aroma. I was looking for a quick recipe for chicken thighs in order to use the meat for other purposes but wound up eating two thighs immediately after baking.

Easy and delicious week night dinner with Tri-color Israeli couscous and broccoli. Basically followed the recipe exactly except used lemon pepper. Next time I might spice it up a little. I used a pan with high sides so the splattering other mentioned wasn't that bad.

Very good, but could have browned it a bit less or at a lower temperature. Would definitely use this recipe again.

Very easy and delicious way to prepare chicken thighs when you don't have too much else on hand! Very tender and nice crispy skin! And since it isn't prepared with extra flavorings/spics, it will go with many sides! Great for no planning cooking, I'm going to fall back on this one from now on!

This is a very versatile recipe, can be served with a salad in the summer...to herbed roasted potatoes with parsnips in the winter. Check out my take by going to membership recipes do a search under "myhl" then check out my "Chicken Provencal". A one pot meal...plenty of bread required.

This is a great recipe. I used a couple of drumsticks too. It is a little messy, but so much better than boneless, skinless breast meat.

I use non-stick pans and have LOVED this recipe multiple times. Very easy BUT also super messy! We have a black cooktop so I have to clean it after I cook no matter what so I don't mind. I should probably clean the oven... Maybe a vented tin foil tent would help with oven mess? Anyway... FANTASTIC chicken that tastes just like my grandmother's famous southern (lightly) fried.

The only chicken I had was leg quarters I cut in half, and they did not fit into an oven proof pan, so I had to do this in batches so the "easy and quick" part was a misnomer. I ended up browning it skin side down, then roasting it all in a pan. Tons of grease released! I added capers to the mix but it was nothing special.

I followed the recipe to the letter, with the exception of adding more spices. I placed a lemon under the chicken before transferring it to the oven, added Rosemary and Garlic, and used a cast iron skillet. The skin was flawless and the chicken was delicious!!!

I've roasted many a chicken, but thought I'd see if a new simple recipe would intrigue me. This one did - only because it emphasized "the technique". My gut instinct said hmm . . . . skin side down for 27 minutes, partly in a 475 oven? sounds like a recipe for burned skin. It was, and I only heated oven to 450. The smoke, and charred blackened skin made this a recipe to avoid. It was edible, that was it. I'll stick to my gut instincts for the future.

Holy Cow!! Crazy Good! Used a splatter screen on the stove top and in the oven. Had no issues with smoke or over cooked skin. Followed recipe exactly except for using garlic salt instead of regular. Made a gravy with the leftover fat.

I am not normally a huge fan of chicken thighs but I had some sitting it my freezer calling out to me. These turned out amazing! The skin was incredibly crispy and yet somehow not heavy at the same time. The only thing I didn't enjoy was having to fan my smoke alarm as it was going off every five minutes from all the smoke which was quite annoying! regardless I would still make it again. and again!

I don't know if it's my kitchen equipment or what, but this recipe did not work for me at all. I even turned the heat on the stove down at the beginning to Med- med/high and it was still way too hot... I blackened most of the skins before the 12 minutes was up. When I transferred to the 475 oven I almost smoked us out of our house. WAAAY too hot! Word of caution, if you are working with older appliances be sure to use a much lower temp. Keep the stove at medium and do not roast higher than 450!

I found the mess (yes, I used a splatter screen) was not worth the crispy skin.

This is my new favorite way to cook chicken. I brined the thighs for an hour first then seasoned with garlic powder and black pepper. I also added lemon slices and fresh rosemary to the pan when I finished roasting in the oven. Deglazed the pan with chicken stock and flour to make some gravy.

I make chicken with the same effect as this at least once a week, it is probably my husband's favorite food, but I do it much more simply. I preheat the oven to 400 or 450, then season the chicken thighs and throw them face down in the dry skillet. Cook them until done (depends a lot of the size of the thighs, I use a probe thermometer but generally about 30 min). The skin will be beautifully crisp, the meat juicy and delicious, and you've done 30 seconds of work. They are also very forgiving if you overcook a little.

Best chicken I've ever made! I too joined this site just so I could comment on this recipe! I am glad that I read the other reviews first as they saved me a lot of clean-up! I seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I cooked them in my dutch oven and used my splatter screen on the stovetop. This left me with NO clean-up! I also lined the oven rack with foil before I preheated to keep any splatter off the bottom of the oven. It worked like a charm! The chicken was moist, flavorful, and the skin....OMG! Crispy beyond belief!! I used the drippings, added a couple of tablespoons of flour, some butter, and a little chicken stock and whipped up a very tasty gravy that made it that much better! Wish I could have given it 5 forks! Will definitely be making this again!! :-)

Holy cow this is good. This is such a simple dish that quality of ingredients really does make a difference. I've made it a few times and I could definitely notice a difference in taste between organic and non-organic chicken thighs. Obviously the organic chicken tasted superior. Recipe is fantastic as is, but I prefer to use butter instead of vegetable oil, and I sometimes add paprika to the seasoning mix. Also - don't crowd the pan.

I have made this with thighs and with leg quarters. It's so easy and delicious - esp when you get it browned and crispy. Next time, I'll try adding herbs/spices (besides salt and pepper) for a little more flavor.

This is so good... I had a couple of pieces left over. You know how the skin is never the same after it's been in the fridge and reheated? Gets all soggy? I ate the skin off the leftover pieces before I put them in the fridge. It's just too good to waste that super crispy skin! The skin is literally crunchy. It's more of a technique than a recipe. But, I'll be going back to it again and again. Plato's chicken thighs. Perfect!

Made this last week and making it again! The skin was so crispy and full of flavor...and I'm not someone who usually eats the skin. The meat was very tender. After reading other reviews about the mess, I tried to prepare for it. I laid paper and small hand towels around the unit but there isn't much you can do about the grease in the oven. Well, it has to be cleaned sometime anyway! This is a definite keeper!

I followed cooking times and temps to a 't' and ended up with some very burnt skin. I used a cast iron skillet and transferred to a different burner when going from high to medium-high heat. (I have an electric stove.) Any suggestions?

Like several others, I joined epicurious after years of use to comment on this recipe. Being a Southerner, I've made loads of fried chicken. This is the best chicken I've ever made! The only thing I did different was add some granulated garlic to the chicken along with the salt and pepper. This is just outstanding, and the mess of oil popping is so tolerated for the amazing results.

So easy, yes messy, but the kids and hubby liked it very much, especially the skin. With my trusty cast iron skillet I did not need to add any other oil or butter, as the chicken fat from the skin easily rendered.

What an utterly easy recipe to do and such spectacular results. I am usually not a fan of thighs plain as I prefer them in high flavor dishes like curry or szechuan, But friend was exclaiming over it and I finally made it tonight. Skin was super crispy and rendered beautifully. Chicken meat was tender and moist. Everyone raved over it. I added fork tender chunks of potatoes in with the chicken and they browned up nicely in the rendered chicken juices and were delicious.

I made this last night for Valentine's Day. If I could give 3 & 1/2 stars, I would have. The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I did have to adjust the temps for the recipe. I have a glass top stove and my cast iron seemed to get VERY hot and only on medium heat. It was so romantic to run around the house opening windows and turning on fans to make sure my meal was not completely smoked out ha! Thank goodness it delievered in the end. Next time I will start will all these things on or open a bit and lower the heat even more.

This was unbelievably good! I used chicken legs and thighs and fit a total of 8 in my Al Clad Pan. I have an old nonstick AlClad that the surface isn't too nonstick anymore but this pan was perfect for this recipe. I may invest in a cast iron pan just to see how much better this may be. I did use the oil but I don't think that I needed to because the skin renders fat fairly quickly. I thought for sure that I should add some seasonings other than salt and pepper but another reviewer said it didn't need it so I followed the recipe. Typically I rub my seasonings under the skin but did not do so here and truly, it was perfect. I cooked it for about 5 more minutes in the oven because it looked like the legs needed just a bit more. Had I only used thighs perhaps the timing would have been fine according to the recipe. But the extra time didn't dry the thighs out at all. Yes, this makes a bit of a mess but there is nothing else to clean up so it's more than worth it! I will keep this recipe in my back pocket forever. So easy and delicious!

I have made this recipe probably 7 or 8 times since it first appeared last year. My family loves it and asks for it all the time. I usually make some kind of pan sauce or gravy to go with it. It is a great technique. I don't have a cast iron pan, so I just use my stainless steel Cuisinart saute pan. Also, I cook it at 475 rather than 500. Delicious!!

I've made these on a regular basis since I first saw the recipe in the mag. They are truly perfect. Initially, it was mind-boggling to use such high heat for such a long period of time, but it works. So, use an apron. DRY the thighs well before starting. Not sure the oil is necessary, depending on the amount of skin. The fat renders fast and furious at that heat. Season the skin well, reverse side needs nothing. I use All-Clads as well (2 pans, as I cook 12 thighs at a time). They work great. So, so worth the mess.

This has to be the best recipe for pan roasting chicken ever. The skin came out so crispy and the meat was juicy. I used my all-clad pan. Next time I might add some garlic and fresh herbs to the pan, but as written its exceptional (and yes, most of it is technique)

This is the easiest chicken recipe I have ever used. I was a little bit skeptical about the amount of time that the chicken stays skin side-down, so I checked it every few minutes to make sure it wasn't burning. I found the suggested cook times to be right on, however, and my chicken came out perfectly browned and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. For reference, I used a 2-pound package that contained 5 chicken thighs. So simple, so delicious...this recipe is definitely a keeper.

Rating: 4
Mmm this was simple and tasty. My chicken didn't get quite as seared/browned/crispy as the chicken in the pic looks... I guess I need to get the pan hotter in the beginning. Broiled for 3mins at the end and this helped make a moderate crisp. Added a lemon juice/garlic/olive oil 'marinade' while broiling that worked nicely. The man loved it.

So perfect and so easy. My skillet is too bit to put in my oven, so while the thighs were browning on the stove I heated a tray covered with foil in the oven and transferred the chicken to the tray. Served with string beans and baked sweet potatoes. A perfect fall dinner.

Yes! As advertised, this is the Perfect pan-roasted thigh. I had small cast iron pans and had to split the thighs- three to each pan. Only one fit into the oven (small oven, also roasting cauliflower)- so I left one batch on the stove, flipping them after the first 12 minutes and pan roasting them for only about 5 more minutes. I cooked the other three according to the recipe. Honestly, the thighs left on the stove were just as good, as those put in the oven. So! skip the oven step and have equally delicious chicken. While the thighs rested, I sauted shallots in the pan, deglazed with white wine. Added water and lemon juice. Delicious final touch!

This was an excellent and easy recipe! Loved the way the chicken was crispy on the outside and moist and tender inside! Perfect if you have little time and not a lot in your fridge to work with. A great way to dress the chicken if you want a little zip is after cooking the chicken and transferring it to a plate to cool, reserve 2 tbsp of the drippings in the skillet, add 1 tbsp of Sriracha, 2 tbsp of brown sugar, about 1 tbsp minced cilantro, and the juice to half a lime. Whisk and bring to a boil until the brown sugar has dissolved or until it thickens and becomes a nice glaze. Spoon over the thighs and enjoy!

Super easy and with 3 ingredients! I had to watch the stove temperature, since the first time I burned it a tad. Second time around, I didn't turn the flame quite as high, and removed it from the oven 3 minutes early. The skin was crisp and the meat was juicy. I will make this again and again.

I love this recipe but I hated the mess it made in the kitchen - on the stove and in the oven. So I tried making it on the BBQ - in the same cast iron pan. I started it on direct heat for 2 + 12 minutes then moved it off the flame and closed the lid for another 13 + 5 minutes. It turned out great and no mess in the kitchen.

4 out of 5 family members loved this crispy and juicy chicken. Instead of kosher salt I used "Flor de Sal" Olivas Negras which gave it a delicious mediterrean flavor. My daughter doesn't like skin or dark meat for that matter, so she wasn't keen. Cast iron skillet is a must. I used peanut oil for its neutral flavor but want to try it with clarified butter. Will definitely make again in a variety of ways.

I've made this several times and each time it was sooo delish! My husband and daughter were craving fried wings (Alton Brown's is THE BEST) so for a less labor intensive version I did these thighs and served with Frank's Buffalo Wings sauce on the side and a salad lightly tossed with Marie's Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing. Huge hit. Going to make the chicken/cherry salad tonight - can't wait for dinner!

I really liked the simplicity of this recipe. Upon making it, I thought that the chicken was going to be greasy as all get out, but to my surprise it was not greasy at all. This recipe is all about the technique. It truly made the skin perfectly crispy. Love that. The chicken itself was pretty ho-hum however, but chicken is chicken. My partner LOVED this dish, and asked me to make it again the following week. I noticed in the photo that there are lemon slices. I think that would have helped brighten the flavor of the chicken a bit. All in all a great recipe.

Excellent recipe! I made it with both thighs & drumsticks, so I extended each of the times by about 2 minutes and still was slightly worried about the drumsticks cooking through, but the thighs came out perfectly!

I will absolutely be making these again!

This recipe is everything it says, delicious, and easy. I have never had skin that crispy. But - what a mess! I had to clean my stove top, my floor, my counters and my oven because of the high temperatures and splattering grease. Even with a splatter cover. I don't know if I'd make it again.

wow, this is fantastic! Super easy to follow and comes out tasting like fried chicken, with smaltz left to boot. The only alteration was to pat the thighs dry prior to salt and pepper to minimize spatering. Can't wait to make it again. Cast iron is a must on this one.

Skip the oil! It's not needed as the chicken fat will quickly render out. Also, I do not turn them but leave them skin down throughout the entire cooking process. I season the cut side generously with bbq rub. Total cooking time is 38 minutes at 425. The same applies to pan cooking airline chicken breast---no oil, do not turn. Try it!

This is basically Jacques Pepin's Crispy chicken thigh recipe from way back. No need for cast iron any frying pan will do. And no need for the oven step just leave the thighs skin side down in the pan for 20-25 minutes. Everyone loves the chicken cooked this way and I'm always asked to make it.

At the risk of sounding stupid; there are lemon slices and thyme(?) in the pan in the picture. How did they get there? On a different note; I roast chicken thighs like this all the time - although without the oven step - regulating the heat on the stove and roast/frying for a longer period creates a wonderful result. So my evaluation is not quite correct.

My husband and I always have chicken thighs so I was anxious to try this recipe. I'm giving it four forks because it is VERY good but I probably won't make it again because of the grease splatters stove-top and in the oven. It was so bad that I had to use the oven-cleaning process and our entire house smelled of chicken grease. I think this recipe probably is better for a professional kitchen with a staff of people to do the clean- up! But, I do want to reiterate that the end product was very, very tasty. Maybe the next time my oven needs to be cleaned I'll try this recipe again.
