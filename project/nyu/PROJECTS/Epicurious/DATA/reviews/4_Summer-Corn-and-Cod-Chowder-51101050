There is nothing healthful about fat free half and half. It's corn syrup. Use the real deal. If you won't use real ingredients don't bother cooking.

I haven't tried the recipe yet, but I'm wondering if anyone would know the nutritional info without the bacon? thanks!

Fat Free 1/2 and 1/2 has is made with corn syrup solids. def not good for you. Use real 1/2 and 1/2. I mean, this recipe has bacon in it, It was not meant to be low fat. You are not going to eat this every day. This is an indulgence that you are only going to eat now and then. go for it and get the best taste.

fat-free half & half is made from skim milk with the addition of carageenan, which is derived from kelp, and not a "synthetic pseudo food."

We love summer chowder recipes and this one is great too! I substituted leftover apple chardonney chicken brats, chopped, for the bacon, added canned creamed corn,added carrots, fresh parsley and basil, replaced the cod with shrimp very tasty!

Seriously, if you want a great fish chowder try the New England Fish Chowder recipe on this site. You can easily add corn. Have to agree with the previous reviewer regarding the "fat free half and half"- WTF?? I think of Epicurious as appealing more to real foodies-this recipe is just plain silly.

Seriously. WTF is "fat-free" half-and-half? Half-and-half should be half milk, half cream. This is half milk and half what? Thank you, but no way. Epicurious should not promote synthetic pseudo foods. Wouldn't it be better to use fat-free milk and real half-and-half?

Took about 45 minutes all-in. Quick and tasty.

Would make it again if someone requested chowder, but perhaps with a bit more bacon. Simple prep, simple taste.
