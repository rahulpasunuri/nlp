These taste just like the almond cookies we had in France in 2004 (in Provence). Baked in this fashion, they don't quite look the same. My family loves these cookies and they keep very well.

I was hesitant to make this because of the reviews. However, I am throwing a party for aprox. 100 guest with a Moroccan theme and needed cookies for dessert. Moroccan food is so strongly seasoned that I think these will be great with the mint tea after dinner. They grew on me as I nibbled on the end pieces. They are not terribly sweet, but for my purposes, that's great. Glad I tried them. Also, one batch makes tons!

This was a tasty and easy to make cookie and I especially liked the whole almonds. However, I found that during the 2nd baking my first batch of cookie burned when they were baked for 14 min. I baked the next batch only 10 minutes and they were somewhat better, however with both batches the cookies turned out very hard (which I liked as a dipping cookie). Next time I will try lowering the temperature of the oven for the 2nd baking.

Loved it. I made this for my friends and they are already asking me for the recipe after tasting it. Really great!
