I love this recipe. I've made it enough times that I've looked into ways of speeding it up, and it works great to do a double batch and freeze half. Right after the kneading, coat half the dough lightly with olive oil then wrap it in plastic wrap, put it in a ziploc, and freeze it. Half the sauce goes in a tupperware bowl in the freezer. Not sure how long they'd keep, since it's only ever been a few days before I want to make the pizza again. Move dough and sauce to the fridge 24 hours before you plan to bake, move the dough to an oiled, covered bowl to warm and rise for about an hour and a half. I've always slid both pizza and parchment onto the stone and cooked for about 10-11 minutes (my oven runs a bit hotter than 500 when it's set to 500.) The parchment does end up burned but that's not a problem.

This pizza is DELISH!! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly with a few small changes. For the crust, since I didn't have any unbleached flour, I just used regular bleached all-purpose flour, which turned out fine. For the sauce, I added a bit of chopped onion, a few shakes of dry oregano, and some extra garlic, since a few reviewers said the sauce was rather bland. Also, the recipe doesn't specify whether or not the basil leaves should be chopped or just put in whole, but I chopped mine for the sauce and to sprinkle on top and it tasted great! As for the issue of transferring the pizza onto the stone, my method involved covering the bottom of a round cookie sheet with cornmeal without using any parchment paper. I spread my dough and assembled the pizza on the cornmeal covered cookie sheet, then carefully slid the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone with absolutely no problem. Try using cornmeal -- it really works!

This pizza was DELISH! I used half wheat flour and it was still great.

Amazing! I have just started experementing with Pizza and have been disapointed a few times, but this recipe was exceptional. My boyfriend even commented on how good it was!

I'm giving this 4 forks just for the crust bc it was exactly what I was looking for (super thin crust/ brick oven style) using a pizza stone. As for the rest of the recipe... I think I could make a more flavorful sauce, but this is good and pretty quick. Here is my dough notes- If it's tacky and wet add more flour. I had to add almost a cup more and then a whole bunch more flour and corn meal when rolling out the dough. (It was a humid, cold, day.) I also held my oven at 550. It only takes about 6-8 min. I would NOT leave it in for 13-16 or the toppings burn. I also brushed the crust with olive oil and garlic salt when it came out. Oh! and handling one big pizza is challenging. I made 2 slightly smaller pizzas and built the pizza on the back of a cookie sheet so I could gently slide it off in 1 swoop.

This was a great recipe and it got our teenager away from his computer and into the kitchen to cook with me. It took a long time and cost a lot more than a takeout pie, but we were so happy with our very delicious success. We followed the recipe without any changes.

I used frozen pizza dough, so I can't comment on the dough.

Excellent pizza! Sauce was a nice consistency and flavor. Yes, parchment started to burn but I lowered heat to 450 degrees and pizza still came out great!

The addition of parchment paper is a mistake. The paper burned, as it did in the recipe photo, and stick to the bottom of the pizza. It took two people and lots of scraping to make the pizza edible. Instead of parchment, use kosher/sea salt and corn meal to keep the dough from sticking.

Excellent crust! I used a stone and increased the temperature to 550º, with great results. Parchment may be only "rated" to 450º, but you can use it at higher temperatures. That's what it's designed to do. It will not spontaneously combust, though it will char and smell burnt.

I made this recipe exactly the way it was said, and it was completely amazing. I might have used a little more flower then necessary but it was completely flawless and amazing. I put a lot of cheese on it which made it even greater. The dough rises more in the oven, so I made the dough even thinner. It was utterly delicious!

This recipe is amazing. I am from Europe and I have had some amazing pizza either home cooked or at restaurants, but this is definitely an amazing recipe! My friends don't even want to go out for pizza anymore, they just want to come over so I can make this one :)

This was a hit. I don't have a pizza stone, so I pressed the dough out directly onto the pizza tray which I had sprinkled with corn meal first. I cooked for the same amount of time at 500F and it was lovely. I used 8 oz of fresh mozzarella instead of 6 since I had an 8 oz ball on hand.

Sauce is good, but will never make this crust again. Tasted fine, but extremely difficult to work with. Used flour and corn meal as others suggested, but still too sticky to move from paper to pizza stone. There must be a better way...

great recipe. I use store bought dough from the freezer case (in pizza sized balls; directions are on the dough package), fresh tomatoes which I let ripen first, fresh basil grown in my window, oregano, and low or nonfat mozzarella (not fresh). I add some shaved cheese: reggiano, parmesan, or another salty, dry cheese. Put some red pepper flakes on it before cooking or a good amount of black pepper.

I agree with "use good ingredients" (remember GIGO - Garbage In Garage Out). I would call this Pizza Margret - in honor of North American styled pizzas. I hate to be picky but a real Margherita does not call for tomato sauce but rather fresh tomatoes seasoned with salt, pepper, fresh mozzarella, basil leaves and a drizzling of olive oil before cooking and then just at serving, all on a thin crust dough. In fact purists would not use tomato sauce on any type of pizza. I guess it's the North American spin. Try real tomatoes (Italian plum - Roma,Capri or Sans Marzano) you can taste summer! Better yet tomatoes from your garden. Wax paper or parchment paper at 500 and you'll have smoked pizza. Buon Appetito

Not to get into semantics, but I believe the author of the recipe intended the directions in the last step to read,"...slide pizza WHICH IS ON the parchment paper, OFF OF THE PAPER & onto the stone." As per the reviewer from WA, parchment paper should not be used in an oven above 450F - it even says so on the box. Also, WA is right on about the cornmeal. Put in on the parchment and the stone. Anyway, I love a good Margherita pizza and this one is awesome. I added a little more cheese, but less is more with this pizza, as it is meant to be rather simple and spartan with the ingredients.

Easy to do and tasty too. I added kosher salt to the edge of the crust right before baking. I love that salty taste with the tomato sauce and basil.

Took me a few years to finally find a pizza dough recipe that I like. One HUGE tip that I got a long time ago was not to pre-cook the sauce - it will get too sweet. Besides, it cooks while it's in the oven! Try it, you won't be disappointed!!!

This recipe is a little off from the traditional pizza dough. I recommend a little more flour and certainly avoid using wax paper, but I also recommend not using parchment paper, as the oven temperature is specified for 500F, and spontaneous combustion temperature of paper is 451F. That could be bad. Instead, simply use cornmeal or coarse semolina under the crust when you build it on the peel (or a baking sheet) and slide it onto the stone that way with a quick jerk--the semolina/meal acts like ball bearings. And I do recommend using lots of the stuff as it will stick with too little. Also to prevent sticking, make sure you flour both sides (but especially the bottom) of the dough well once it is shaped. This gives another barrier for the dough's moisture to have to absorb before it does so to the meal/semolina or any parchment paper that it is built upon. I've had good results with this technique and it bumps up the quality a notch to have the semolina on the bottom of the crust.

Great pizza dough recipe! I made it about 24 hours in advance and doubled the EVOO on accident, but it was just what we were looking for. We rolled it pretty thin and the pizza turned out crispy on the edges but still soft in the middle. I think I'll add just a little seasoning to the dough next time though.

Whatever you do, DON'T use wax paper instead of parchment paper. At the high temperature, the wax melted onto the dough. Even if it weren't for the wax, I thought that the flavors were pretty mediocre and it certainly wasn't the best dough recipe that I've used.

I tried 5 different pizza dough recipes to determine which one we liked best, and found this to be the favorite. I tried using 00 Pizza Flour from Italy instead of all purpose flour but found that it was not very good (too chewy). The favorite pizza dough was this recipe, using bread flour instead of all purpose.

The dough is wettish. Make sure to use parchment paper, as the recipe directs, because the pizza cannot be shoveled onto the stone without it. My dough stuck to my tried and true floured paddle and when I gave it the typical shove into the oven, the pie ripped apart. Even so, a very good pizza.

I only followed the recipe for the dough and it was fantastic! The dough is light and fluffy and has a great taste.

Made this for friends and everyone was really impressed. Sauce is very easy to make. I made the dough and left on the parchment paper too long and it stuck. Next time I'll shape the dough right before use.

Both the sauce and the dough are easy to make, and very flavorful. And, it is ready to eat in 90 minutes -- about the same time as it takes to order in.

wonderful exceptfor the caveat: fresh mozzarella is watery; drain/dry it first. that's it. enjoy and have a very happy year.
