Super simple and delish! Lime is a nice touch. Dad was not a fan of Brussels sprouts until he tried these on Thanksgiving...

Outstanding recipe especially for Thanksgiving because it takes so little time. I shred them in the morning then saute just before we eat. People who don't like Brussels sprouts love them.

Looking forward to trying this. I am curious, I have seen never known 26 brussel sprouts to weigh only 10oz. Am I shopping at the wrong place? Why 4 forks? Sounds like a 4 fork to me

This is one of those simple recipes that some how manages to amaze. At first glance, you think 'what were they smoking when they came up with this combination'. Somehow, the sprouts and the scallions are perfectly balanced by the miniscule amount of lime juice. The sprouts are no longer pungent, and lime is imperceptable. Alton Brown needs to analyze this one. Wonderful, quick, tasty.

I have never liked brussels sprouts until I had them shredded. Added sauted proscuitto and toasted pinenuts.

My partner told me I was crazy serving Brussell sprouts for a dinner party. In the end, all of the them were gone, people asking for more. Great flavors and nice presentation. I will make again.

We love this dish. We pour a little orange juice into the pan and saute for a minute or two before taking out. Gives it a brown carmelized quality and sweetens the sprouts a bit.

Actually, very good. I added a bit of chicken stock to deglaze and served just as it had evaporated.

Best brussels sprouts ever. My husband--who usually chokes them down just to please me--asked for a third serving. I there is a lot of surface area when you slice them like this, so I used a LOT of butter. Delish.

Really liked this. Shredding the sprouts is a great idea; I will try that for other brussels sprout recipes, too. Love the lime juice!

A hit with everyone. Easy to make ahead, I just reheated them once thedinner got underway..easy.

This was fab! I used a mandoline to shred the sprouts, and at least twice as much butter as called for. They were even better when cooked a little too much, so they were all brown and crispy in some places. An easy keeper!

The chiffonade is definitely the way to go with sprouts! Since I had no more scallions nor lime juice, I used the suggestion below for balsamic and shallots. Wonderful. Can you believe it, four forks for brussels sprouts???!!! They could only have been better if I had grown them myself. Healthy, easy, quick and delicious.

This smelled really good while it was cooking. My husband, who isn't crazy about brussels sprouts, said it was delicious. But he didn't ask for seconds. I think it needs more lime juice - a lot more - to really mask that bitter flavour.

This was an excellent recipe for brussels sprouts. Like someone said before, shredding the sprouts really takes away the bitterness for the center. i will definitely shred my sprouts from now on.

Slicing the brussel sprouts is key. My husband loves them, but I have found that the centers often do not cook through and tend to have the acidic taste they have when they're raw. I also added a clove of garlic to this dish, a couple extra cranks of fresh pepper and a pinch of cayenne for a nice kicky flavor.

Fabulous! I have never had brussel sprouts before, and I thought that these were fabulous (I even finished off the extra after dinner). My husband who hated them as a child, loved them! These will become a staple in our house. Tonight I served them with meatloaf and au gratin potatoes. What a comforting meal!

Loved by all the Thanksgiving guests. I made it the day before and it reheated beautifully in the microwave.

Yum! Made for Mothers Day and everyone (including very picky younger siblings) ate this and loved it. Lime really added a great taste.

Five at table last night, all of whom are indifferent (at best)to Brussels sprouts. This approach resulted in four of the five taking seconds. The main comment was that having the sprouts cut up allowed the lime and butter flavors to permeate them, greatly enriching the taste. The fifth? They're green, therefore....

This is terrific! So much better than regular steamed brussel sprouts. It has a bit of kick to it and the sprouts are still crunchy - my favourite way to eat veggies. I will be eating lots more brussels now that I have this recipe.

Try this with shallots and balsamic instead of lime juice. I can't get enough of them!!!

My husband is a dedicated hater of Brussel sprouts and he actually liked this dish. Excellent served with pork or ham.
