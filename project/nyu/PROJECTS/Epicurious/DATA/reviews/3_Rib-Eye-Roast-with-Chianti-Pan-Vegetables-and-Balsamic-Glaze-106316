I took the prior reviews to heart and swapped the vinegar and red wine amounts called for in the recipe. The result was just OK, not exciting. In addition, I cooked the veggies at the same time as the roast. The veggies were slightly undercooked (I substituted quartered Yukon Golds instead of the baby potatoes). The roast however, was really good, just perfect with a warm pink center. My family was very pleased with the roast. All in all, not a bad recipe, but not one that I'll keep on hand!

Good roast, but not great. Certainly not company worthy. I stuck the vegetables in late per other reader's instructions and then found I had to hurry and finish them off at 425 while the roast was resting. The balsamic glaze was great but darned near killed my husband and parrot with the fumes. I'd make it again but it's not an "all-time-favorite".

I made the roast and the glaze. They were both amazing!

The roast was delicious. I took the advice of the other reviewers and shortened the cooking time of the vegetables and they were really good. The glaze took longer to reduce, but the wait was well worth it - very good!

I made this for a dinner party last night and it turned out great! I was surprised to see the previous reviews. I agree with the cooking time of veggies. They were almost too done. I thought the sauce was a nice touch. It yields way too much though. Could cut in half.

I use the Epicurious site for inspiration-this is not an inspired recipe. In fact, the meat was tastless-a poor choice of cut for this dish. The veggies were simple but need less cooking time. The syrup about ruined a good All-Clad sause pan. Needless to say don't bother following this recipe as it is written-use your imagination and it will most assuredly turn out better.

it was missing herbs.....I don't think I reduced the sauce enough, I think I got sick of the smell also, so I shut it off. I don't think it is worth trying again.

Turn on the exhaust fan and leave the room while you're making the glaze - it's torture! Also, I overreduced the glaze on the first attempt; you might want to watch it in the last 5 minutes. I didn't tell the butcher to trim the roast BEFORE rolling it and was disappointed to get a lot of fat inside when I sliced it.

I made this recipe for Christmas & it was a big hit. I agree with the others - no need to put the veggies in earlier than the meat. The vinegar smelled SO strong while cooking that my husband had to open a window - his eyes were watering! So I was nervous that it would be way too strong & told everyone to go light on it. They thought I was nuts & poured it on. A really delicious, low-fat way to serve rib eye.

The sauce adds no flavor to the meat. It must have been added for photographic enhancement. It is not worth the bother. Next time, I would choose another method for preparing a rib-eye roast.

I cooked the vegetables in the meat pan and they were very good. They could have been added just a bit later, but I like my onions and potatoes very crispy. I also didn't realize the sauce thickened after the reduction during the cooling stage. Just thought others would want to know that instead of wondering what went wrong. The kids loved the glaze too.

I loved this recipe and so did all my guests. I agree with the reviewers who thought the glaze was fantastic! There were a couple less adventuresome who did not enjoy it a much, 1 a finicky child. So, don't be afraid of it.

This was fantastic! and besides that, it was soooo easy. The sauce was not overwhelming. The recipe for the sauce made quite a bit, but I put a sparing amount on (as the recipe said to do), and everybody wanted more. A wonderful dish. I do need to work on the veggies a bit. They would have been better if I had been willing to let them sop up the meat grease and juices and cooked them in the same pan as the meat!

I'm glad I made the glaze a day in advance. It has HORRIBLE. What a waste of good balsamic vinegar. I will be doing the recipe without the glaze.

Fabulous. The prior reviews were very helpful, as the vegetable instructions are confusing. DEFINATELY put the veggies in at the same time as the meat (not sooner). This is plenty of time for them to roast to perfection. A new suggestion: I poked some holes in the meat and inserted thin slices from two cloves of garlic. This added a wonderful, subtle flavor and aroma. Everyone had double and triple servings! The sauce is a must.

Wonderful! I served this to family and they loved it! I would recommend, however, increasing the oven temp. to 350 degrees or 375 degrees. The temp. recommended here made the roast take a long time to cook. Roasting the meat to an internal temp. of 125 degrees was very good direction; ours was perfect (medium rare) after roasting it to 125 degrees and letting it rest for 10 minutes. The balsamic glaze is divine; my stepdad said he doesn't agree with the "go easy" direction of the recipe; he loved the sauce! This is absolutely fantastic.

I served this to company and everyone raved! I can't wait until I can invite more friends over, so I can serve it again!

the method of cooking the vegetables confused me at first..especially because the vegetables were more than done after the initial 35 minutes of roasting..i couldn't imagine roasting them further, so i just took them out and added them to the roast at the last minute. besides that, it was a good recipe...great for a dinner party.

Very easy and delicious. My guests preferred the roast without the sauce, even though they said the sauce was good. It overpowers the taste of a good roast though. The vegetables got a little overdone. They could start at the same time as the roast and be done enough.

I test-drove this recipe this past weekend, thinking it would be a good entree for my gourmet dinner club. It's all that and more! Next time, I will reduce the amount of time for the vegetables though or put them on the top and the roast on the bottom. It may be my oven (it's small and gas so the heat is from the bottom) but I had to take the veggies out much sooner than the recipe called for. No problem ... I just tented with foil and then popped them back in while the roast was resting.
