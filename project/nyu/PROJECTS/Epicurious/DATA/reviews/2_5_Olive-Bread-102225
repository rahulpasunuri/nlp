Everything in this recipe worked perfectly but it just wasn't what I was looking for in an olive bread. I will continue to search for that perfect blend of flavor, which this had, and texture, which this did not, for my taste.

I made this olive loaf for a church coffee hour. There was none left over. Congregants asked for the recipe. I always soak olives in water before using them to remove unwanted saltiness. I also use exceptional flour from the Great Valley Mills in Pennsylvania, suppliers of flour to Gen. Washington at Valley Forge in 1777-1778. I will definitely make this recipe again and again.

I thought that this recipe was good, however, I didn't put all the basil in it, only about half. I also put half ripe olives and half green. My guests that it was an interesting alternative bread choice. It was easy to make and very eye appealing.

I made this for a holiday event and found it way too saltly.

I had read the previous comments for this, and made some modifications to the recipe: instead of 1 cup olives, I used slightly less than 1/2 cup; a little less than 1/4 cup oil; used 8 egg whites and 3 egg yolks; no salt at all; and a little extra baking powder. And it came out really good.

This bread was, indeed, veeery dense. The taste was actually quite good, but the texture was just a little odd. I probably won't make it again--I have better recipes--but my husband thought it was wonderful!

I fixed this bread for a Greek theme potluck. I didn't much care for this bread. I love all ingredients in it but this bread came out too salty, too dense... Like you said in your description of this recipe... smells good , and is lovely to look at...that seems to be all. I probably would cut the amount of Greek olives to 1/2 cup instead of one.
