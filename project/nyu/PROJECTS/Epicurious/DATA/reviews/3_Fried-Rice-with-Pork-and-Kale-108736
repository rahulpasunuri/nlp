I was disappointed. The texture was sort of mushy (I used 2 day old rice) and the flavor was unremarkable. It's a fairly long recipe... perhaps a few too many ingredients were coming together and canceling each other out, or just the wrong balance.

I liked this recipe. It's easy to change - a simple fried rice dish.

When making fried rice, it's always a good idea to scramble the egg first and then to add it to the dish at the end. Adding the uncooked egg at the very last moment turned my formerly perfectly textured fried rice into a gluey mess, no matter how much I stir-fried. It still tasted good, even though I would go easy on the soy sauce the next time.

This was really good! I substituted spinach and omited the fresh cilantro and scallions. Really tasty. I did end up using a little more soy sauce than suggested and added a dash of fish sauce for flavor.

the orig. marinated pork was wonderful. I would have preferred eating that as my leftovers rather than this recipe. Nothing special, considering the work involved making the kale, etc.

Made this as a follow-up to the ginger pork/kale dinner, and was pleasantly surprised, despite the so-so reviews. Made as specified and I found the flavors to be a little bit korean and quite delicious. I used a larger kale and pork to rice ratio and less oil to make the dish lower carb and lighter. Very yummy!

My husband, toddler and I all liked this and will make it again. We did the pork tenderloin dish first with the leftovers to use for this recipe, and boy did we appreciate the concept of "planned leftovers," as it made this fried rice dinner so easy. My husband likes hot food, so he added Vietnamese hot sauce to his serving. Nice strong ginger and lime flavors (we use a microplane for the ginger, which we find results in huge ginger flavor).

We really liked this one! I thought the flavors were great. We did use quite a bit of hot sauce as accompaniment. And day-old rice is KEY, otherwise it's tasty mush.

Pretty bland, even though I added red pepper, thai hot sauce, and lots of soy sauce. I may try the meat and veggies alone, and serving over rice, rather than cooking it with the rice.

We enjoyed this easy dish. I used collards instead of kale, but any leafy green would do, and used thai hot sauce because the serreno 'disappeared' between the store and my house! Very nice dish for using leftover pork tenderloin - you can add other veggies or even tofu as well.

This dish really disappointed me. I made the pork soley for this purpose and likewise, the kale. The pork was fabulous and I'll be making that again and the kale was delicious on it's own too (and I've never had kale before). But when you put it all together, I felt the rice was rather bland if you can believe that. I won't go to the trouble of making this again.
