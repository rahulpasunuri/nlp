Wow- I was surprised by other reviewers- I thought this was excellent!!! Delicious comfort food- I made it exactly as written. I will def make it again!

Excellent recipe! At first, with the oil, is possible add a little piece of butter: this will make the sauce creamier. Then, as soon as they have melted, add the onion, finely chopped. Your advice for Roero Arneis is interesting; in Italy, some use red wine instead of white wine. Take a look to my recipe: http://www.academiabarilla.com/recipes/emilia-romagna/chicken-cacciatora.aspx

This is classic comfort food. It was easy to prepare. I altered the recipe with double the garlic and half the bell pepper. Will make again, but only using thighs. The white meat was quite dry and too thick and dense to absorb the flavours.

This receipe tasted awesome, is easy to make, and is extremely healthy! I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts & thighs, replaced water with chicken stock, and add one cup of mushrooms. I served it over pasta too!

Just OK. While I realize this is a Tuscan style dish (use the best ingredients, some of the flavors might be muted), I did just that but still wound up with something that was only "good," certainly not great. Although recipe is easy. Maybe I am accustomed to bolder flavors, or other cacciatora dishes I have had, but this one seemed to be missing something. However, the suggestions below were all good and helpful.

I was a bit hesitent to make this as I don't care for stewed tomatoes, but I'm glad I did. When cooking chicken I always substitute broth for water and reduce the salt. This isn't a dish I'll serve for a dinner party, but it's an easy "weekday" meal. (especially if you chop everything the night before)

An easy and kid-pleasing meal. I added a pound of sliced mushrooms. Also I dredged the chicken pieces in seasoned flour before sauteing.

Very good basic recipe. I added artichoke hearts at the end because I love them. I let it reduce because I like my cacciatora thick. Also, I did not use the water, I used more tomatoes in their juice. I thought they would give it more flavor. I could not find the specified wine, so I used a Soave, which is a dry white Italian wine. Excellent, can't wait to make again.

Good, but better with a little garlic and stock instead of water.

This was fine -- not great, not bad, but just "fine". Everyone happily ate it, but it didn't rock anyone's world and certainly wasn't memorable. I used chicken broth instead of the water just to give it a little more flavor and also added some artichoke hearts (canned), which seemed to get lost in the sauce. Not much else to say here...except that I completely agree with reviewer JonathanR.

I'd make it again, but only for two reasons: 1) Time..it was fast and easy 2) Uninspired or wary guests. Tasty..but not exciting. You can, however, rest assured that it will offend no one's taste buds

This is a really good starter recipe- very basic and easy to alter to your own tastes, if you find it a bit bland, or if you happen to be like my Mom and dislike rosemary.
