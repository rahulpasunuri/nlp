Simple, and very nice. Next time I'd be more careful with the yolks and the flour, as the eggs I used were a bit small.

Delicious! Easy, beautiful, I am eating it for dinner.

This is a nice change of pace from the ordinary omelet. I thought it was alittle sweet; I'm going to leave out the pinch of sugar next time.

An impressive-looking but easy-to-prepare dish that's great for a lazy Sunday brunch. Took me 30min to make, including baking time. Instead of onions, I used scallions, and substituted dill for the tarragon. Tasted great!
