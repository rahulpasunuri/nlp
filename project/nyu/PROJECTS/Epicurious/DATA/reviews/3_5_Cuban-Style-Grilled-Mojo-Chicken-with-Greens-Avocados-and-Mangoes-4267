My husband and I loved the grilled chicken with the fruit salsa! I chose this recipe, because I was looking for something that used avocado and chicken. I wanted to use ingredients that I had on hand and not make a trip to the store. Some ingredients I didnt have, so I made a few changes. First I would like to disagree with all the cooks who mentioned that the recipe took too much time. I thought it was quick and easy. It doesnt take but a minute or two to toast the seeds and another minute to mash the other dry ingredients into a paste using a mortar and pestle. While the chicken is marinating, prepare the fruit salsa, and then sit down and relax! As to the changes I made, I didnt have any oranges or orange juice on hand, so I had to omit that. Like other cooks, I also drastically reduced the amount of oil in the salsa dressing, and I added lime juice. Remember, I had no oranges on hand, so that was not in the salsa dressing. I had to substitute jalapeno for the Serrano pepper. I loved the combination of the spices on the chicken. It was very flavorful. We will have this again for dinner.

In preparation for making this meal for a special dinner guest this evening, I made the dressing this morning. It's dreadful. Not giving up, I added: 2 T. brown sugar 2 t. salt 2 garlic cloves 2 T. fig balsamic vinegar 1/2 seeded & deveined jalapeno, minced 1 T. lime peel After it sits for a couple of hours, I'll adjust it further. My suggestion is to find another "orange vinaigrette" recipe to replace this one. The rest of the recipe looks fab!

I LOVE this recipe! My parents have made it several times but it seemed time consuming. I made it tonight and cut down the time by using the salad dressing to marinate the chicken with the inclusion of chopped garlic. I also used olive oil because it's healthier. I let the chicken marinate during the day and finished the rest of the salad before serving. The only other thing I would change would be to cut down the amount of oil. Otherwise this is fantastic!

Had such high hopes but the dressing is HORRIBLE!! First I made without honey because everyone said it's too sweet, ended up adding it and it still wasn't quite right. The orange peel made it sooooo bitter! I strained it out but it was too late. I added some garlic and mustard but never got past the bitterness. The marinade was good. Time consuming, but good. I only had a couple hours to marinate, and I pricked the chicken with a fork to allow it to penetrate more. I oven roasted and the chicken turned out juicy and pretty flavorful. I didn't taste as many layers as I'd hoped. I'm going to try the "Roasted Mojito Chicken" next (same idea, slightly different).

I previously entered in a detailed review. However, the web site asked me to update my profile and lost my review after I spent several minutes typing it in. the dish was wonderful. Will make it again.

I did not like this. It took a long time to make, yet didn't wow me in the end. It wasn't worth the time.

This was pretty tasty, but I'm glad I read other reviewer's notes first, especially about the dressing. I made the dressing and it was just strange - the soy sauce really knocked it off balance. So I followed one reviewer's advice, just used balsamic vinegar and olive oil. I substituted baby spinach for the salad, cut the chicken into strips before marinating, and sautéed the chicken rather than grilling. I mixed the hot chicken in with the spinach, mango and avocado (with addition of red onion and red peppers) and tossed it. The warm/cool effect was very nice! Will make again, but nix the funky dressing!

I had to review this recipe again. This has become a family favorite. To pump up the flavor of the dressing I increase the soy sauce until I like the taste. I throw on extra cashews and yes, the cashews are a must. I make this dish over and over again.

I agree with others that the dressing leaves something to be desired. I added some honey mustard and that gave it a little oomph. I also added cilantro, red and jalepeno pepper to the mango and avocado mixture for more color and crunch. Used half baby greens and half arugula and liked the peppery flavor of the extra arugula with the chicken and fruit. I liked the marinade--tried to inject it into the chicken breast, but that did work very well. I'll make this again with some modifications.

This is a great salad,each time I have made it, everyone has loved it, including my 70something hard to please Dad.I did make a few changes, to the dressing, add garlic,half of the oil i use olive oil .Cilantro tossed in at the end and no cashews, i just dont think they would go well with this.Does anyone think the cashews are a must?

Cuban or not who cares?? Geez! The salad is good! Yes, the dressing is sweet but it all balaces out I think when all combined......I added chopped green onion....

I made this dish a few years ago for a group and I keep hearing about "the best chicken, avacado and mango salad you made once" from a few of the folks that were at that meeting. So I am here to print and make it again. I agree with the other reviewer about the oil. Too much. I have worked in restaurants, I understand that fat improves flavor, but sometimes Bon Appetit recipes are too heavy on oil. It makes things just plain oily. There's a good balance, sometimes you have to tamper with the recipes to find it. I tend to like dressings with some kick anyway, so losing half the oil would be a good thing. Anyway, the recipe is very good, I would recommend it regardless of it's authenticity or lack thereof. Just drop the words Cuban-style and call it what it is.

This dish is not Cuban (I am Cuban - I know this for a fact). A Cuban would never use a chili pepper in their dishes. Chili peppers are used in Mexican and Central American cooking not Cuban cooking. I would not try this as it just not authentic.

I just made this dish for friends and it was a hit. I added some cilantro, both in the marinade and on the salad, and also added some papaya-pineapple salsa that appeared in a recent issue of gourmet. Really delicious and easy!

I would attempt this chicken again but with less olive oil so that the taste on the chicken is more concentrated. I marinated it all day and you could barely taste the marinade although it was quite fragrant during the grilling and preparation. I skipped the salad dressing and sprinkled some olive oil, lemon, lime and orange juice over the salad just before preparation. The salad was a hit!

The marinade for the chicken is outstanding!! Like the others, I will skip the dressing. Instead, serve the chicken with mango (or other fruit) salsa.

I hate to rain on everyone's parade, but I have to cast my opnion of this recipe: GONG! I found the dressing to be sickeningly sweet. Especially combined with the sweetness of the mango. I felt as if the dressing was crying for an edge; maybe a little garlic? Also, for whatever it's worth, this dish is not Cuban. In all fairness it's called "Cuban Style", but even that's a stretch. Also, although I marinated the chicken for about two hours the chicken tasted plain as plain can be. Too bad, because the mojo marinade smelled wonderful, perhaps with more time beter results can be obtained. I won't be trying this again soon though. Next...

Great "meal", even in the winter. Broiled the chicken. Used cumin powder (1 tsp) directly, instead of cooking seeds, also dropped the chili for a milder version. Alot can be done ahead; will definately make again.

I am a caterer and i have made this dish several time but just for the chicken. I serve it with a mango chutney and a coconut rice and I get rave reviews. It is an easy marinade and fun to make. For a different chicken dish try it.

As is, I wasn't a big fan of this dish but with some changes it became a three-forker and something that I will definitely make again for a light summer meal. To the mango and avocado I added diced serrano chile, red bell pepper, green onion, and cilantro. I also thought that the dressing was way too sweet (even with significant doctoring). I tried the salad with a balsamic vinaigrette instead and it was delicious.

I've made this recipe over and over. It is delicious just as is - well okay I added a few more cashews. I always get raves when I make this for anyone.

I really enjoyed this one. It was a great way to eat mangoes and avocadoes. I'm going to Cuba so making this recipe was sort of a way to get into the spirit of the upcoming trip.

One of our favorites. Made it several times during mango season. Perfect for company.

We thought this recipe was fantastic. We cut out some of the oil and when Mangos were not available, we substituted with fresh peaches. We've made this numerous times and loved it each time. It's a keeper and guest worthy.

Overall, pretty darn good. We added diced fresh red pepper to the salsa for color & crunch. The marinade needs much more serrano pepper than called for to counterbalance the sweetness of the salsa and the dressing. We sprinkled some fresh minced serrano pepper over the dish, and that worked fine. Makes a great chilled salad the next day.

We made this dish for our neighborhood's progressive dinner and it was a great hit. I'll definitely serve it again!

While I thought this to be a very pleasant dish, both the marinade and dressing could be reduced, and the marinade could be done just as easily in a mini-processor. Also needs color-perhaps the addition of cherry or grape tomatoes.

Definite do again. I would cut up the chicken and toss all together as a salad. I used lemon juice in the dressing as well to add tartness to the orange juice, also adding soy sauce instead of salt to taste.

Refreshing blend of ingredients to stimulate your taste buds! We've made this receipe several times and will do again! Pistacios are a good substitute for the cashews.

A very stylish and tasty lunch or warm-weather supper dish in mango season. I made this twice last spring, and look forward to a reprise.
