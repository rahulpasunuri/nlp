This was my best turkey ever. Would it hurt the outcome if I leave the salt rub on it for longer than 24 hours?

Made this turkey for Thanksgiving 2010. It was fantastic. Very Moist!

I made this for Thanksgiving 2010 using a fresh turkey and it was just great! My sister's mother-in-law said it was the best seasoned turkey she had ever had and in 88 years that's saying a lot! I did wonder if the lemon would make the drippings a little "off" for gravy but not so. I followed the recipe as written and it was a huge success. Also "dry brining" this was so much easier than using a tradional brine. I did make the ultimate turkey stock for the gravy. You will not go wrong on Thanksgiving using this technique.

Best Turkey ever! Tender, juicy and flavored thru & thru. Fairly simple to follow the directions and worth every minute.

I was pleasantly surprised! This was the second Thanksgiving turkey I made, and it came out moist and flavorful with a crispy brown skin. The only deviation I made was to use a 12 pound turkey.

This recipe turned out great! I was a little apprehensive about salt brining the turkey, but it was so juicy and made the gravy perfectly seasoned. I did not use the lemon oil on the skin, but used herbs/butter/olive oil all over. For an easy, additional step, this was really worth it.

I loved this turkey! I followed the recipe but used an electric stand alone roaster oven. The skin was not crispy (I didn't throw it in the oven at the end) but the meat was so tender and moist and fragrant. The Mediterranean gravy was tangy and wonderful. I will definitely be making this again for Christmas.

I'm surprised to see several negative comments since my guests thought this was the best turkey ever. (Well, they do say that every year!) The herbed flavor was subtle, but it was there, and this is a lot easier than finding a large enough container to brine a 16-18 pound bird. The turkey did cook a lot faster than the recipe specified. Our 16 lb turkey was done in 2-1/2 hours and I even turned the temp down to 325 after the first hour. I'll be preparing it this away again.

Eh, you can do a lot better than this turkey. I more than doubled the herbs, and this had no effect. I left the turkey in the fridge for 24 hours, and it was too salty and the meat tasted awfully dried out. The only positive really was the visual -- the turkey looked great. But this is really nothing to write home about . . . .

Beautiful presentation - golden and delicious. Cooked mine a little too long but tasted great. The drippings made a truly delicious gravy - though no additional salt necessary.

A tasty and juicy turkey! I cooked it for the recommended time, but since my turkey was not quite 14 pounds it was technically overcooked. Even the breast, while not juicy, was not dry. Much of the flavor goes into the drippings, and the accompanying gravy recipe is tasty with the turkey.

I was disappointed. I was kind of wondering how you can place an oregano lemon garlic rub on the outside of the skin and yet taste it in the meat. I even kept the rub on for 48 hours. The turkey was moist, but nothing more than carefully cooking the standard way. We detected no rub flavor in the meat. We did cook a larger turkey (25 lbs) which may have affected the outcome.

Only made the rub; filled the cavity with stuffing instead of the lemons etc., and brushed the outside with olive oil and butter - no lemon juice. The skin was perfect and SO delicious. Perfectly crispy. The turkey was really moist. The lemon and herb residue in the cavity made my stuffing taste awesome. I know I didn't follow the recipe entirely, but I would definitely do the salt/herb preparation again!

This is my first review but I just had to share! This was a great turkey. Very moist with a crispy skin, and you could taste the lemon and seasonings. I was only able to allow the rub to set for about 8hrs, and did not have any fresh oregano (used dried). I did use a lot of lemon juice. I just used the two lemons for juice that I had used for the peel.
