Great recipe. I added about 2T of fresh rosemary chopped and otherwise made as written. (This breaks my "review the recipe as written" rule, but I didn't feel like adding herbs ruined the integrity of the recipe) Delicious, buttery, great texture, very easy despite the longish rise times. Delicious even as leftovers.

We enjoy this recipe, but like it better with garlic in the dough. I add several cloves of minced garlic in the melted butter. I also like this they come out so pretty - just like in the magazine!

I loved this article about Valentine's bread rather than traditional sweets. When I made these rolls I used bread flour instead of all purpose. They turned out great. The "fantails" create multidimensional bites with the center being moist and chewy and the tops a little firmer and crisper. If you do think they are not flavorful enough you certainly could add herbs or other types of flours, seeds etc.. They also froze and reheated perfectly.

These came out really nicely! They are easy to make and very lovely. They do come out just like the picture. I think the taste is quite nice and is a simple buttermilk roll. They make a nice presentation for a dinner party. To vary the flavor, I'm sure you could add some whole grain flour. I plan on using the shaping method for other dough recipes because it looks so nice!

Try these rolls. While this recipe takes a bit of time, it is quite easy for yeast rolls and makes just 12 rolls which is good for a small household. I made them for gumbo at our super bowl party and they looked great on the plate and were perfect for dunking in the gumbo. The few I froze and reheated were just as good. I might throw in a tiny bit of whole wheat flour or ground flax seeds next time. Don't forget the butter as they come out of the oven. And I will definitely have for breakfast with jam as another reader suggested.

Hi, Id love to make these, but am worried about the lack of flavor based on other reviews. Do you think adding dried or fresh herbs into the dough before baking could help?

I was a little nervous about making these after reading the reviews; I was also nervous because I had sort of given up trying to make bread from scratch because I find that it never tastes as good as purchased versions. However, these came out great. They didn't have the yeasty taste that I find a lot of home-made breads have, and were yummy and buttery. It's true that they're not the most flavorful things out there, but they're rolls....they're supposed to be a base, and they're great for that. These were also really easy to make. I'm by no means a bread expert, and these looked just like they did in the picture. I only gave 3 stars because they were a tiny bit dense, but that was probably because I'm a bad kneader. Anyway, this is a great recipe for beginner bread makers looking to produce something yummy and impressive.

Easy to make but the taste was bland and the texture rather dry and like cardboard. Many recipes that are better. I already threw this one out.

These rolls were good, but a little bland, tasting somewhat like Pillsbury dough. They are simple to make, and beautiful - mine look just like the photo in the magazine so I am going to try again and see if I can get them more flavorful by adding to the recipe.

We thought these were quite good. I hadn't made a yeast bread in years and this sounded pretty basic so thought I'd give it a try at my kids' request as a Superbowl snack (why not?). They baked up perfectly and had a light, not overpowering, buttery flavor. The kids loved pulling them apart and eating the individual fan pieces. Quite a pleaser. The few leftovers were delicious reheated for a few seconds in the microwave and spread with blackberry jam. yum!

The dough was very easy to work with and the assembly straight forward. The final product looked exactly like the picture and my fantails tasted light and buttery. They were a huge hit at dinner. My only complaint is some of the rolls came apart when I was removing them from the muffin tin.

after drooling over the picture these did not turn out as well i had hoped. the instructions were not complicated, the dough rose perfectly and the rolls themselves easy to assemble. my only complaint was the taste. i tasted one hot out of the oven before i brushed them with the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, and the taste left a lot to be desired for me. i mixed some honey into the butter in hopes of giving these rolls some of that buttery yeast roll goodness. mmm...

They look amazing, but don't taste all that spectacular.

I mostly agree with the previous reviewer. I made them just as written and they were okay. The dough was very easy to work with. I actually liked that it only made 12 rolls, it makes it easy to make them for just the 4 of us for dinner. I might make them again just because of how easy they were. The rising time doesn't bother me. Mine didn't taste too much of buttermilk, they were just on the rich side, and heavier than I wanted them to be.

I made these rolls exactly as the recipe stated. They looked just like the picture. I thought they were good, not great. They were not as light as I had hoped and the buttermilk flavor was a little prominent. They were very easy to make, but for the amount of rising time to yield only 12 rolls made me think of the old saying "a lot of sugar for a dime".

Very easy to make. I didn't do the fantails, but made round rolls in a 9 inch cake pan (followed the last part of the parmesan rolls from the same issue). The taste is somewhat like a mild sourdough bread.
