YUM! Instead of discarding the stems I sauteed those with green onion in olive oil, mixed that into herbed bread crumbs and some parmesan and feta, will definitely be making this again soon.

I make this again and again for my vegetarian fiancee as a main, accompanied by garlic mashed potatoes and pan-fried carrots with cumin--it's wonderful for a non-meat fall/winter meal. I cut the amount of bread crumbs, don't skimp on the olive oil, and sometimes add veggie crumbles.

Enjoyable. I followed the advice of putting in the mushroom stems, Did everything else the same and added 2 tablespoons of puree squash for moisture. Excellent flavor.

pretty tasty. i added diced sauteed red peppers, onions and garlic to the bread crumbs which i thought worked out well. i also added a little dried rosemary which was a mistake, wouldn't recommend it. served over sauteed spinach. quick and easy, worth doing.

I thought these were pretty good. I used whole wheat bread for the crumbs, which made the stuffing a little mushy. Next time, I'd use white bread or baguette. Needless to say, I didn't have a problem with the stuffing being too dry!

Based on previous reviews, I chopped the stems and sauteed them with an equal amount of chopped italian sausage in a little olive oil and added it to the stuffing. Was wonderful!!

Mince the stems and sautee them in the olive oil before adding to crumbs, cheese and herbs. This helps with both quantity and dryness issues, and why throw them away at 7 bucks a pound??

Make more of the stuffing than the recipe calls for. It's barely enough to stuff 4" Portabellas.

Dry, dry, dry, and uninspired....but a great base recipe for add-ins like chopped olives, sauted mushrooms, cooked Italian sausage

This recipe looked so appetizing on paper, but the end result was far too dry and bland, in my opinion. The good thing about it is it is a very simple and quick recipe to follow. I would probably use a lot more olive oil on the mushrooms themselves, and maybe moisten the stuffing some more. Rather than broiling them, which only seems to dry them more, I might sautee them, w/a spot of garlic in the olive oil, then add the stuffing, and heat shortly.

Yes,delicious. Thanks to previous review. I added the chopped mushroom caps and 1 tbsp shallots to the stuffing, and a little milk after the cheese was added (had no chicken broth). Quick and easy to make.

The consistency of the stuffing was so dry. Drizzling the remaining olive oil on the stuffing didn't work, so I had to resort to desperate measures to make the stuffing edible.
