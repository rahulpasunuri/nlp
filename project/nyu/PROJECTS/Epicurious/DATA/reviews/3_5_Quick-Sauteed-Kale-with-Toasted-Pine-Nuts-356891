Even my 8 year old son ate every bite and asked if I could make it again tomorrow. I used baby kale straight out of the box, reduced the already low prep time.

This was delicious and healthy! Can't go wrong!

I don't know, this didn't turn out that great. First of all, it took forever to cook, more like half an hour, before the kale wilted enough to eat. An I also had a problem with the onions burning. The kale doesn't release enough water to keep the whole dish from sticking and burning. I had to add extra oil and water. Still tasty when it was ready, but much more of a hassle than it sounded. Probably wouldn't make again.

This was simple and delicious. Leftovers made a wonderful, light meal over fresh pasta with red pepper flakes and parmesan.

Very good - the browned onion is a really tasty complement to the kale - but - I did have a hard time keeping the onions from burning. I shouldn't have browned them as much as I did before I added the kale, and probably should have kept the heat lower. I used about 1 pound of kale and got about 3 servings out of it (maybe 4, but it was so good!)

Yum! I haven't had luck with kale before, but this was simple and good. I will make it again.

delicious! the pine nuts added a nice crunch. I went light on the olive oil and added a touch of vegetable broth.
