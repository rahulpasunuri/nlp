This is a good basic recipe, but I felt it needed something I couldn't put my finger on to help with taste and, of course, fried rice is never made with fresh rice but day old leftover rice which helps the texture and makes it less of a sticky mess. Finally, eggs ARE vegetarian, but one could veganize the recipe by omitting them.

This worked well with our Hoisin Marinated Pork Chops entree. Not anything special but good. It requires more soy sauce than called for.

Extremely easy to prepare. I cut the ginger down a little and add a little extra soy sauce. Very good!

This was okay. I thought that the ginger was very overpowering. With added soy sauce it was good, but I wouldn't make it again.

A very easy, yet tasty, recipe. I didn't use the bell peppers or the soy sauce, but they would probably add to the flavor. For vegetarians, egg can be replaced with peanuts. Works as a quick breakfast. Rice can be prepared from before-hand.
