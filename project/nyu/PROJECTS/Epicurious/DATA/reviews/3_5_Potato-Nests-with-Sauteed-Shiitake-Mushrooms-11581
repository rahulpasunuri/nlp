I would like to make these without the fryer ( i don't have one ) Has anyone baked the potatoes instead?

loved it!! I didnt have a potatoe nester so I simply mixed the shredded potatoe with a scrambled egg and deep fat fried it. It was still excellent.

This was a wonderful addition to our New Years Eve party. We brought in the New Year with these wonderful nests and fowl. They were very tasty, and made for great novelty item in complimenting the cornish hens. I would recommend it to anyone, and have.

THIS RECIEPIE WAS A VERY GOOD ADDITION TO MY VEGITARIAN MENU BOTH AS A SIDE DISH AND AS A LARGER STATER
