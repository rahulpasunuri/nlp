Excellent! Made as prescribed. If you use this sauce for the pumpkin souffle, use sparingly. Drizzle a small amount of sauce on to the souffle. I also spooned this over vanilla ice cream.

I just made the sauce in preparation of the souffles which I will make later. It tastes like a Werther's Original candy (at least to me)....yum! However, I will use it sparingly with the souffles.

I have made this twice. It was perfect both times. It puffs beautifully and the Bourbon sauce adds exceptional flavor

I LOVED this sauce. Only a tiny amount was needed but these sturdy flavors greatly enhanced the pumpkin souffle!

This sauce ruined the Spiced Pumpkin Souffle it was paired with. It was horribly sweet and overpowered the delicate souffle. I rate it zero forks.
