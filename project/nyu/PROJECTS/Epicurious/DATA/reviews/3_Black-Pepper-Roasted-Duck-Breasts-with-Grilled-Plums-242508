Wow! Frying duck on the stove is messy. Even with mesh splatter guards, this method creates a lot of grease. This was the first time I cooked duck. I could not find duck breasts, but an Asian market sold duck hindquarters which worked well. The cook times were adequate with the 5 minute rest period. Our guests liked it and wanted to try this recipe too.

I read the earlier reviews before making this and decided that I was going to use more plums -- lots more plums -- than the recipe called for. I added Cointreau, Cognac, and apricot syrup to the plums before charring them on a ridged grilling pan -- plus sweet smoked paprika for a little grill taste. I also used the paprika on the duck. And after pouring off most of the duck fat, I deglazed the pan with more Cointreau and Cognac, then added butter before re-adding the plums and the plum marinating juices. My wife said that it was one of the best meals she had ever had -- easily restaurant quality.

Try it with regular duck breast. Forget the plumbs and grill some figs with Balsamic . Throw fresh peaches in too! It'll be GREAT!

I love duck breasts, but this recipe does its best to kill that idea. The plums, while taking fussy time, add nothing to the result and times recommended for cooking the breasts would result in shoe leather. Luckily, at least, I kept the cooking time down for a medium- rare breast. If no one would make it again, how does it rate three forks?

I could not find fresh Muscovy duck breasts locally. I ordered them from Grimaud Farms in Stockton, CA (http://www.grimaud. com/) and was sent beautiful Muscovy drake breasts (whole breasts= 1.75lbs.=14-oz/half breast). Rather than pan-roasting, I cooked them (and the plums) on an All-Clad Indoor Electric Grill. It did a wonderful job - the skin was crispy and the excess fat drained away as they cooked. My guests loved this dish and I am reflecting that in my rating. My personal opinion is that the seasoning should be pumped up. The reason that I would not make this recipe again is because of the lack of availability.
