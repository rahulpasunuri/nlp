Delish! Simplicity is terrific, and with extra fresh ingredients fresh from my CSA this was yummy!

_This_ is a recipe? Not that I don't love zucchini, olive oil, garilic, or basil, or that I don't often cook my zucchini this way, but seriously, if you have these ingredients on hand, and this didn't occur to you independently, it must be really boring living in your head/eating in your kitchen. Oooh - be bold! - substitute mint for basil and see what happens!

This dish is easy, healthy, and delicious! What else can one ask for in a side dish?

Although I wanted to make best use of our fresh garden zucchini & basil, I was reluctant to try this recipe due to its simplicity. Not to worry. This simplicity is a beautiful marriage of the two. It has been a crowd pleaser at summer potlucks. I mix in fresh parmesan before serving.

This was neither good nor bad. I used home grown zucchini and basil and dressed it up with grated smoked mozzarella, which helped, but the general flavor was pretty neutral. Some lemon zest would have perked up the flavor. I will say that my husband, who does not like zucchini, ate two helpings!

I added all the basil in at once, and this dish came out great. It's simple, easy, refreshing, and very healthy. What more could a girl ask for? My boyfriend liked it, too.

I added a clove of garlic to the oil before I fried the zucchini. At the end I added the extra basil, and sprinkled with parmesan as suggested. It was simple and very good with the 2 lb lamb, feta (12 oz) and tomato (4 large sliced)(cooked at 400 degrees for 60 - 90 minutes. baste to keep moist). Yes the lamb recipe is that easy. I serve with rice.

I'm always looking for new ways to prepare zucchini in the summer. This is a winner.

This is a wonderful dish, especially with home grown zucchini. I like it best with a finish of fat free parmesean cheese, to taste, added just before removing from the heat. I also cook all of the basil with the zucchini rather than adding half when you serve.
