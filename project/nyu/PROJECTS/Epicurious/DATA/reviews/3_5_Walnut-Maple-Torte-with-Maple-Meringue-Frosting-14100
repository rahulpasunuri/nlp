The butter in the cake recipe reads as such: 11/2 sticks (1/8 cup) unsalted butter. One and a half sticks would be 3/4 cup. Is the recipe calling for an additional 1/8 cup? Thank you.

CAke was a little dry, especially a day after it was cut. My broiler doesn't give me enough room to get 4" from flame, so I had a gigantic flaming marshmallow after 15 seconds. I thought it would take too long for blow torch. I thought the cream cheese clashed, BUT despite all this, it was DELICIOUS!!!!

I really love this cake. I made a couple of changes. First, I added more maple syrup to the cream cheese layer. Second, I replace the meringue frosting with more maple cream cheese frosting. So yummy! I made it for a company party and at least 5 people asked for the recipe!

Made this cake twice. Very good, but first time was dry. Second time I used a maple soaking syrup to spread on layers before I frosted them.

This is a fabulous cake. I had to alter the recipe somewhat, but that had to do with the type of flour I used more than the recipe itself- plus I'm almost right at sea-level. Yum Yum, I will, no doubt, make this cake again. Be sure and don't skimp steps when making the frosting, it really has to be heated to the given tempurature or the texture won't be right (learned that the first time I made it) This is a cake that makes you swoon with every bite ;-) Its a permanent part of my recipe collection.
