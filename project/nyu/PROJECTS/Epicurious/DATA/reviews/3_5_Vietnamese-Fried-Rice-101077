Great stir-fry recipe. Mild but flavorful - probably works better as a side dish unless you add another protein or more vegetables. I added another egg to make a little more substantial on it own. Also added a red bell pepper, and used a white onion in place of scallions. I didn't have cilantro or peanuts on hand but the mint went a long way in this recipe! This would be great with grilled shrimp. It can also handle more vegetables - bell peppers and snow peas come to mind.

My go to fried rice recipe. Many adaptations, and always good.

to make this a truly vegetarian dish for my daughter, I had to replace the fish sauce with soy sauce. Based upon other reviewers' comments, I used extra cilantro to pep it up more. I thought it was delicious with the soy sauce, although being a carnivore, I must admit that it probably would have tasted better with the fish sauce. Worked great as a one-dish meal.

This was a refreshing change from the usual Chinese fried rice with soy sauce. At first I was put off by the idea of the fish sauce rather than soy sauce but decided to go for it anyway. It was great--just needed more of the sauce. During the meal we added some soy sauce and it changed the dish completely and negatively. I used left over pork chops thinnly sliced and some deli ham slices. I'll do this many times.

I make it without the bean sprouts and scallions. Add an extra egg and an extra teaspoon of dried hot red pepper flakes or Prik Nam Pla (Traditional Thai Sauce) to your liking. Add some spicy sausage on the side and a cup of coffee and orange juice and it kicks off a Sunday morning like you wouldn't believe!!!

This turned out really well. I added sliced grilled flank steak (marinated in soy sauce, olive oil, and fish sauce) for a full (delicious) meal, and substituted snow peas for the bean sprouts for a little extra color. I would double the seasoning sauce next time. Everyone LOVED the meal.

Delicious. I had some cooked rice, mint and cilantro on hand, plus a vegetarian daughter, so found this receipe through a search. A delightful combination. I like soy sauce, so I added that to the seasoning mixture.

Two and a half forks. This is good, but pretty mild and sweet. I've never had Vietnamese fried rice before, so I don't know how it supposed to taste. I was hoping for something more flavorful. I don't think I would bother again because I didn't like the sweetness of it. BTW -- I cooked sticky rice an hour beforehand, it was still warm, I used cast iron instead of nonstick, and it did not stick at all.

This dish is very authentic and not bland at all. It would go perfect with any Viet. dish. It isn't ment to stand alone as a main dish, but as a side dish- like white rich with chinese food.

This dish was pretty easy to make, and it's the first time I have made fried rice and the texture was perfect. I added dried shrimp to this dish from another vietnamese recipe. I also substituted fresh chili pepper for the dried flakes. This was really good. I will definately make it again, I think I will add some pork or shrimp next time and use it for a main course.

The seasoning sauce makes the whole dish. Very authentic taste. I added beef, chicken and pork with garlic. Adding your favorite meet or vegetables can make this a main dish. Great in the summer. Taste good cold too.

This dish goes very well with the satay chicken.

Really enjoyed this - very authentic flavour, simple.

I added shrimp to this and then needed to add extra red pepper flakes and herbs to get a nice flavor. It was just so-so. Very nice if you're serving it with something that has a lot of flavor and the rice is a side. Not so good as a main course.

there was quite a bit of homework but assembly of the fried rice was quick. this turned out so yummy and i don't have any complaints of blandness like the other reviewers. it was very flavorful, and i agree that the cilantro and peanuts really made the dish. i even had extra peanuts in a bowl for those who wanted to add more. threw in some chopped bird-eye chillies to make it more fiery. delicious!

This is a great dish, simple and tasty! Don't leave out the cilantro and peanuts...it is a bit bland without them!

This dish puts all fried rice dishes to shame. I use shrimp, tofu, chicken for variation. I also add thai bird peppers

This recipe was really easy for a novice cook like me. I highly recommend using the cilantro and peanut garnish because it adds flavor and texture, but it was delicious.

By now I've made this dish at least five times, and it's only getting more tasty. I usually add a bit of shredded pork and almost double the amount of sauce, as I consider it too dry and bland otherwise. I also use a fresh red chili instead of dried flakes.

Great fried rice recipe! I followed recommendations to double the sauce, but did not double the sugar amount. As my family does not like sprouts, substituted snow peas. Everyone liked it, even my son who doesn't like Asian food very much. Can't wait to eat the leftovers.

I am really only rating the seasoning sauce. I read through all the other fried rice recipes and this sauce seemed the most interesting. It was great. I was a little doubtful when I was pouring it into the rice (because no matter what fish sauce smells weird). But this was really good. I will add this to my recipe box. Cold rice seems key. I added whatever crispy veggies I had on hand. Had to tupperware leftovers immediately and shove it to the back of the fridge to keep from munching on it. Easily serves 4.

This was tasteless. I followed the suggestion to doublethe sauce but it was much too sweet.

I make lots of recipes from this site, some I like better than others... but this, this is my favorite recipe of all time!! It is so easy and quick to make, and has a great flavor. Wonderful for last-minute guests. I serve it with snow peas, too. I don't feel the need to double the sauce -- that is too overwhelming. One warning though -- NEVER use canned bean sprouts! I tried once when the store was out of fresh ones and had to throw out the whole dish!

I loved the seasoning liquid. I doubled the recipe for the sauce. I also added green onions and sweet peas (just a little) and left out the carrots and bean sprouts.

This is a great basic recipe, I usually add whatever is left over in the fridge and every time it turns out different! Just make sure to double the sauce.

Even though my husband liked this receipe I did not. I found it boring. Perhaps if I had double the sauce it would of have more kick. Would not make again.

I love this recipe and make it all the time. I double the sauce for more flavor and add snow peas.

Quite good, and with a few modifications, it could be even better. I think it calls for too much carrot, I would also add sweet peas or snow peas. The sauce has to be be doubled, otherwise there isn't enough flavor. I used a combo of sesame oil with the vegetable oil, which gives it a real authentic taste. I don't like peanuts in Asian food, so I omitted them, but it still is a great veggie dish! The saute needs to be a bit longer than what they say, unless you like it raw and really crunchy.

This was good, but could use a bit more kick. Next time, I'll use peanut oil and a little chili oil instead of vegetable oil. Even increasing the garlic and onions would be helpful. Also, I felt it was a bit too sweet for my taste, and could have done with less sugar or more salt. Finally, I'd recommend cooking it longer than 2 or 3 minutes after stirring in the rice.

This was really good. I think I used more carrot and less bean sprout than was called for, but the recipe is flexible that way. The dish looks colourful and tastes light and slightly sweet. Most of the preparation is done in advance and the final stir-frying only takes a couple minutes.
