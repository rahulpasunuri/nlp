Made this today for my book club meeting tonight. It made the house smell delicious & everyone liked it. After looking at reviews, I think I'll make a note to skip precooking the apples & just stir them into the batter without using the butter & sugar, & top with streusel. I'll add nuts when our nut allergy people won't be here.

Excellent, made it as-written (though mine cooked in 50 minutes) and it turned out amazing!! If you want to know how big to dice your apples (I was wondering before I cooked this), then cut them into eighths and then cut each 8th into 1/2" cubes. I agree with the poster who said it is like pumpkin cake mixed with apple crisp. Holds its shape really well, too, so good for potlucks etc.

Followed the recipe as written and waited anxiously to try it as it filled my house with the most wonderful fall aroma. I have never made a cake with instructions like these, with the crumble base, and was excited to see how it turned out. My husband finds it very tasty. In my opinion, the pumpkin cake parts tastes far too eggy, almost custard-like, and I find that off-putting in this recipe. For the record, I love custards and egg nog. It was also done cooking ten minutes early.

I made this as a birthday cake-- which means that I didn't want it in "streusel" form as much as "cake" form. Instead of topping with the apples and topping, I used half the cake batter as a layer, mixed the streusel and apples (cooked longer than suggested) and then another layer of cake batter. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and cloves (freshly ground). Also had pumpkin puree from a roasted pumpkin, so I didn't use canned. Served with cream whipped with domain de canton ginger liquor. The spice, pumpkin, and apple flavors blended very well, but all were distinct and obvious. Tastes like fall in a springform.

Delicious! I loved this cake! I used fresh pumpkin instead of caned, cooked it with a little bit of water on a non-stick pan till soft and then mashed it into pure. I agree with other reviews  adding nuts (I used walnuts) to the topping helps. Turned out perfect! Definitely will make it again.

Have made this twice and my family loves it! I did add an extra apple and, because I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, I added cinnamon, ginger and allspice to the cake. The combination of flavors was wonderful. This is a perfect fall dessert.

Quite a range of reviews with this cake. My family loves it, but I do make the following alterations: (i) double the spices, (ii) use 6 cups of apple and cook to a deep golden brown, (iii) half white sugar, half brown when white is called for, (iv) add 2 Tbl. of oats and 3 Tbl. chopped toasted pecans to the topping, (v) only bake for 50 minutes and use a cookie sheet under springform. Good advice from other reviewer who suggested mixing the pumpkin, sour cream, sugar, spices and baking soda first before adding to flour mixture, and just combine, then add eggs and just combine. Tastes like Autumn!

Moist and flavorful. I added walnuts and candied ginger to the topping.

This came out really great. I used golden delicious apples and 2 Tbsp brown sugar for the apples instead of white sugar and it gave the top more flavor. The topping was nice and crunchy the first day but got a little soggy the second day so next time I make this I'll add some chopped nuts to help it stay a little crunchier.

I'm giving this three forks only because my boyfriend liked it, I did not. Made exactly as written, I felt the cake was too dense and agree with others that the spices got lost. I won't make this again.

I made this on a cold and stormy night in the Fall in New England. Needed something seasonal yet comforting yet different. Succeeded. Served with Haagen Dazs' brown sugar ice cream-- delish!

I followed this recipe carefully but the cake failed to rise. There was a thin layer of cake on the bottom and a dense wet layer over that. I wonder if it should have said baking powder instead of baking soda?

Based on my previous experience with this recipe I decided not to cook the apples. Rather, I topped the muffins with 2 cups chopped apple and then the streusel before baking. This time they were perfect...a little less sweet and with a better texture. My fussiest eater gave these 4 forks!

Absolutely delicious! So yummy that even those who don't normally like pumpkin pie LOVED this cake!

Rating: 3
A really nice combination of flavors! I made muffins, using 3/4c whole wheat and 3/4c white flour, and baked at 350 for 28 minutes. They're realy moist and must be cooled in the pan to avoid collapsing. Additionally, I felt that the apples added unnecessary moisture. Next time, I won't bother cooking them in advance. This is the first muffin I've made where the whole wheat flour is indistinguishable in the final product, and that's a winner for me.

Wow, this is delicious. I've never seen a batter put together like this before. I don't know why--- it produces a cake with an exceptional, unusually rich crumb. (A method note: I mixed the pumpkin, sour cream, spices, and baking soda together before adding the flour mixture, then barely combined, then added the eggs and again, barely combined. I did not try to make the batter smooth.) Used Fujis and Honeycrips cut into 1 inch cubes. They were delicious and complex. Also made my own spice mix: 1.5t cinnamon, 1t powdered ginger, 0.5t nutmeg, 0.5t cloves.

Wow...What a great and easy recipe. My husband loved it, and it made the house smell so good. I made the apples the night before to save time. I made two batches one normal with a few modifications and one with Splenda. Also, I made cupcakes instead of a regular cake, because I didn't have a springform pan. Since I ran out of brown sugar, I used reg. sugar, and added 1 tsp. of Kings Syrup. Yummy!! Here were my modifications:Add to Apples: 1/3 chopped pecans or walnuts Use brown sugar instead of white add a small bit of allspice Add to Cake: 2 Tbls extra butter 2 tsp of Vanilla 1 tsp extra pumpkin spice used plain yogurt instead of s. cream Great for cupcakes, cook at 350 for 20-25mins.

Rating: 3
I liked it, and apparently so did everyone at work! I used extra sourcream & for the streusal part, i didn't have nuts so i added Honeymaid graham crackers crushed coarsely...not as crunchy as nuts but it did give it texture and volume. I could see how not adding anything to the streusel would leave it bland.

This was really good. Maybe the folks you thought the cake was bland need to get fresh spices. I'll make it again. Easy.

I am not a confident baker, and so making this cake to use up the left over sour cream was a bit intimidating, but it turned out to be exceptional. Here were my all-I-had-in-the-house-while-my-toddler-is-asleep substitutions: used light brown sugar instead of brown sugar; used 100ML of sour cream, and a little extra on the flour and butter to compensate; covered the top with raisins instead of apples; & since I didn't have time to make pumpkin spice, i just added a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon. Very moist and flavorful!

I made this last night and it was so good. I added walnuts to the apples mix on the stove. Had to add more butter to the top crumb mix to make it more like streusel

Made this tonight for dinner. Loved the Granny Smith's--I disagree w/ rtaormina who said they were too tart. Once sauteed with the butter and sugar, they provide the perfect contrast with the cake. i do agree the cake was a bit bland so next time I am likely to add more spice.

Just made this cake and, after reading nearly all of the reviews (yes, their were 147 before mine), I have to say I am a bit disappointed. The best way I can describe it is as bland and very coffee-cakey. As for the different aspects of this recipe: The apple part - Granny Smith's are WAY too tart for this recipe (and any recipe if you ask me). I would definitely recommend using a different type of apple (but, to be clear, I will not make this recipe again). Also, there is not nearly enough streusel set aside to make this cake a true streusal. The cake part - I challenge anyone who tastes this cake to identify pumpkin as one of the ingredients. Maybe you can taste a bit of a gingerbread flavor...but, really, the cake is very bland. Take any coffee cake recipe...it would taste the same. Overall, I think this was basically just a bland coffee-cake with extremely tart apples on top. And for those of you who report that all of your dinner guests raved about this cake...of course they did...no person with any type of manners would tell you that this dessert was just "okay," which is exactly what it is. Definitely not worth the ingredients.

I made this as written and everyone agreed that the apples weren't great, but the cake was nice. Now I actually use the cake base only and bake it in loaves with the streusel on top as pumpkin bread. It's not as dense as most pumpkin breads and people LOVE it.

I read a buch of reviews before making this cake, so of course I had to tweak it. I increased by half and baked in a 9 x 13 pan. Since lots of folks complained it was too moist, I added two tablespoons extra of flour (to the already increased recipe). I cooked the apples a little longer than noted to lose a little more moisture. I used dark brown sugar throughout - no white at all. And I added chopped pecans to the struesel. It was very good, a great snack or lunchbox dessert. I think the pecans added the most.

This cake was excellent -- loved the texture, spices & tartness of the apples. The recipe could have been more specific as to how long to beat the batter after you add the eggs. baking. I would add chopped pecans to the reserved topping mixture for added crunchiness.

I made this recipe last weekend, but I added a sour cream glaze on top after the cake had cooled. My niece and her husband were here for dinner and when I served the cake for dessert, they all just loved it. She said it was so good that I could probably sell it. So I will definitely make it again except that I couldn't stop eating the leftovers. It was extremely moist and yummy!!!

To the cook from Wales - Libby's Pumpkin in the tin is available from Waitrose here in the UK. Might make things a little easier for your next pumpkin based recipe

Rating: 3
The cake is a bit dense but tasty. To the cook from Wales: Fahrenheit/Celsius 300°/150°, 325°/165°, 350°/180°, 375°/190°, 400°/200°, 425°/220°, 450°/230°. A teacup is a Cup measure and neither metric or British. Pumpkin pie spice = 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon ginger, 1/8 teaspoon allspice, 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg. Canned pumpkin = baked & pureed pumpkin Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C. Cut the pumpkin in half and remove the seeds and the stringy parts. Use a baking sheet with sides and line it with foil. Brush the cut edges of the pumpkin with melted butter. Place cut side down on the baking sheet and bake until tender when pierced with a fork, about 1 hour. Baking time will depend on the size and type pumpkin being used. Cool the pumpkin and cut into pieces. Place the pulp in a blender or food processor and purée until smooth. If the resulting purée is too watery, place it in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until the purée thickens and the water has cooked away.

Please remember that I had to guess a lot of this due to your U.S site..but the previous reviews were useful. Firstly we dont get Pumkin in tins in the UK so I had to guess that it means cooked/stewed pumkin (which is what I did - fresh, and I went from there). Secondly, remember that we work in o'C not F so I have to convert. I do find the "Cups of" useful instead of measuring all the time. Anyway. I used much more creamed Pumkin than recommended. I also left the Pumkin and Apple overnight in Fridge after Prep - Worked fine. Next we dont get Pumkin Spices so I used "Mixed Spice" and additional Ground Cinnamon. Also I noted what others had said about Blandness so I added extra Sugar / Sweetner and spice to the batter. I also added Pestal/Mortar.crushed Walnuts AND roasted Pumkin seeds to the batter AND the top of the cake (at the end). Finally, I added a drizzle of honey and a drizzle of toffee topping to just finish the cake off. My cake was bigger (extra Pumkin) so I had to cook it longer and it rose more. The family loved it and it was dead easy. Definatley not bland but I agee with some it needs to mature for a few days to get full flavour. I think this is a pudding and not a cake.. I used the excess pumkin and Sour Cream to invent a "Cream of Winter Veg and Pumkin Soup". That is another story..

After reading all of the great reviews for this cake I expected something out of this world but when it came out of the oven and we all took our first bites I was disappointed. Altough I had baked it for over 1.5 hours (because i doubled the recipe and bake in a 12 inch round pan) it was tto moist and almost like pudding. I wish I had added some spices into the cake batter (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, etc.) because I found the batter to be very bland. On the plus side, this was an easy-to-make cake and just needs a bit of tweaking.

Rating: 2
I think this cake is so-so. It is very easy and looks impressive for how little time you need to spend on it. But the taste is kind of ho-hum. The actual cake is very bland - in my opinion it is only saved by the apples. And the strusel does get soggy after about six hours so it is not a good make ahead cake. I just thing there are better fall type cakes out there.

I always read reviews and many times agree with them, I love to cook, love great flavors. I read the reviews again on this one and can't believe I am possibly the only one that wasn't wild about this cake. It just didn't do it for me. I didn't serve it with ice cream, I put a dollap of whipped cream on the side of the cake with fresh grated nutmeg. It was almost too moist. There are so many wonderful fall recipes, this is just not special. Possibly with fresh ginger in it?

I've made this cake a few times and everytime it's been a big success. Each time I had people say they wouldn't like it and they always end up asking when I would make it again. If you haven't tried it, definately do. It's great for morning meetings at work...

The night I made this recipe I had a slice and wondered why it had received so many great reviews - then I had a slice the following day and could really taste why everyone loves it. My friends thought it was the best thing they had ever tasted. Definitely better the 2nd and 3rd day - so make it a day early. Next time I make it I'm going to try making 1 1/2 times the recipe & baking it in a 9 x 13" pan and cutting it in square slices. Hmmm... maybe it will work. Then it would serve quite a few people.

Very easy to prepare except the apple dicing part. I made it for a pre-thanksgiving party last night. My taste buds were desensitized by the time I got to the dessert course. But many people raved about it and told me it was the best cake they've had for awhile. So I will definitely make it again - actually thinking about entering a baking contest with it. I used 5 apples, will likely make more of the apple streusel next time. I will also chop the apple more coarsely for more texture next time. I used less sugar, added a whole can of pumpkin puree, and almost doubled the amount of sour cream to lighten the cake a bit since other reviewers seem to think the cake is a bit too dense. It was dense, but by no means dry. I made my own spice concoction as well. It looked great and smelled great fresh out of the oven.

I've made this cake 3 times over that last 2 years and it is always well received. I never have any left to take home. I use a 10-inch springform so it does not need to cook quite as long and I coarsely chop the apples rather than dice them. I made no changes for altitude (6600 feet) and it still turns out good every time.

Dark, dense layer at the bottom made me uncomfortable serving it to friends, I felt like it was undercooked even though I baked it for the full 70 minutes and the tester came out clean.

I also felt it was a bit "eggy" or uncooked tasting, so gave everyone a squirt of ReddiWhip.

This recipe is so tasty! I've made this recipe 3 times and have loved it each time. The cake is very dense and full of flavor. Leftovers also keep well for a day or two. Perhaps the reviewers whose cakes collapsed after baking need to add a few minutes to the baking time? I noticed mine turning more brown than I thought was good toward the end of the baking time, but it needed the full amount, plus a few minutes. The cake did not become overly brown or burn by doing so.

This was a huge hit as a breakfast coffee cake both pre- and post-Thanksgiving. I made the following personal modifications - used golden delicious apples and slightly less sugar to saute them in; added three tablespoons of minced crystallized ginger and a handful of Craisins to the cake batter. Also, used my own blend of spices - 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp ground cloves. Made it on Tuesday, kept refrigerated , then brought to room temp. and warmed briefly before serving. Moist and scrumptious, will make again for New Year's brunch.

This recipe held so much promise - it was fairly simple to make, and looked and smelled great out of the oven, but when I served it the following day, I was somewhat disappointed. It tasted just OK, and I didn't think it looked very appealing. It was very dense on the bottom and an ugly color at that. Our hosts served it with their homemade vanilla ice cream which helped, but there were no requests for the recipe - or even second helpings, for that matter.

While chopping and dicing apples is the hard work, this is definitely worth the effort. I don't use pumpkin pie spice, so experimented with my own - ginger, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, etc. Cranberries and/or raisins would add zest, as would some orange zest!

I loved this recipe, and would definitely make it again. However, the apples I used required about twice the called for sugar to be palatable. I don't know if that's just that particular crop, or if I just have a very sweet tooth, but I found them way too tart without extra sugar.

I tried it warm and it lacked the flavor I expected with so many promising ingredients. However, the next day and even 2 days later it tasted better and better. The spices really do intensify as it ages, alnog with the pumpkin flavor and the apples. My recommendation is to ignore the "serve it warm" if what you want is flavorful cake. It does make a very good coffee cake though.

Made three versions,as per recipe. 2nd using margarine. 3rd using my own pumpkin spice mix, which was 1 tsp nutmeg, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. End result, use butter, my blend of pumpkin spice mix and sour cream, this made a very moist cake with great flavor.

This interesting cake is very tasty. The pumpkin taste is subtle, but good. I will probably add chopped pecans to the topping the next time. While this recipe does not require extreme skill, it is not exactly "simple" to put together; coring, peeling, dicing and then cooking the apples, mixing the dry ingredients with butter before removing the topping, and then mixing the remainder of the batter are all time-consuming steps. But the result is worth the effort, and I will try it again in the fall.

Excellent! But definitely more of a coffee cake than a dessert. I've already made it several times and it dissapers immediately!

This cake is great and perfect for a brunch as well as a dessert. Next time I make it I will definately serve it with a hard sauce and whip cream instead of ice cream.

Everyone loved this recipe. I actually made it somewhat differently, but it was perfect: I substituted yogurt for sour cream. And I accidentally reserved 2/3 of the dry ingredients for the topping (instead of 2/3 cup!!) Thus, the cake was very moist almost like a bread pudding. We ate it for dinner and breakfast and found it delicious!

It was great. Husband loved it as well as my 5 and 9 year old boys. Do try!!

Delicious and very easy to make. When I woke up in the morning half of it was gone (and the only other person at home is my husband)! Since I didn't have pumpking spice I mixed cinnamon, cloves (just a bit), nutmeg and ginger. I used a 10" pan and baking time was only 50 minutes.

I have made this cake 5 times since receiving the October issue. It is easy and fabulous...a mixture of all great fall dessert ingredients. I did find the recommended baking time was too long. 50 -60 minutes was all the cake needed in my oven. Can't wait for Fall to return so I can make and serve it again!

A big hit twice so far! Can't agree with others on blandness. Fresh pumpkin pie spice is important. It is easy, delicious and impressive looking.

What a disappointment. Made for Thanksgiving and didn't get a single positive review. No pumpkin flavor (come to think of it, no real flavor at all, needs lots more spices too) and the cooking time was too long, even though it took the entire time alloted to get a clean tester, the bottom was almost burnt. It looked so promising, but what a let down.

interesting alternative to the traditional coffeecake. nice spice and texture. flavors seem to meld together best in time, so prepare a day or 2 ahead, and warm to serve.

A guest brought this to my house for Thanksgiving and everyone really enjoyed it. Although I do agree, it is probably even better as a coffee cake than as a dessert.

Rating: 3
This recipe was very good and I'm surprised at the reviews that said it didn't have pumpkin flavor. The cake certainly had a pumpkin flavor, and it blended very well with the apple and streusel topping. I wouldn't serve it as dessert again - we all decided it was the perfect "coffee cake" for Christmas morning, though.

Tasted great and a big hit at my house! I used fresh pumpkin, and a mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. The cook time for me was only 45 minutes! I also used a reduced fat sour cream (that was what I had in the fridge)and a different apple than what was requested in the recipe.

I did not have pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1 tsp each of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. This is an excellent "coffee cake" style cake. My family is still raving about it 2 weeks later.

My co-workers raved about this recipe. I found it to be much better when warm out of the oven. It was very moist, perhaps from using the same baking time at high altitude.

The picture is gorgeous but the cake didn't match! An hour and 10 minutes was too long in the oven, and the cake came out too dry on the edges and bottom. As many others have said, the pumpkin flavor didn't shine through enough.

This is my first negative review to this site. I thought it sounded great, it certainly LOOKED great, but was bland, heavy, and unpumpkiny. what a disappointment. I served it to guests, who were"kind" and then I flushed it down the disposal . . . without regret.

I made this the minute I received my magazine. It was a hit with my family and co-workers. I made a maple glaze (powered sugar, vanilla and maple extract). Drizzle across the top (lightly) and serve warm (heat ea. slice 30 sec.) GREAT and as pretty as the picture!

The pumpkin cake was delicious, the apple crisp topping was delicious, but the combination of the two had no chemistry. I wouldn't say it was a total waste of pumpkin and apples, but there are certainly more delicious uses.

This was a totally awesome desert .. nice change from the same old pumpkin pie.

Great cake! My guests gobbled up the entire thing. The pumpkin flavor is a bit weak, but the apples and topping added a nice texture. I would rate i 3.5 forks, actually.

I tried it also, and felt a little let down by it. I defintly felt like something was missing. I could not place the special, umph that it needed. The pupmkin flavor was week, however the apples with the struesel, great. I look forward to trying it again with the suggestions, I have seen here in the feedback. My husband and I agreed that the flavor did get better in the fridge the next couple of days.

I made this dessert along with the entire menu. It was okay the first night, but really terrific several days later. Great to make ahead and refrigerate as it just gets better - warm before serving.

Delicous and very easy. We will use chopped pecans in the topping next time. It would be a hit with any fall meal!

We absolutely LOVE this cake! I have already made it three times, but altered the topping. Here's what I do: Make the streusel topping as indicated and add the required amount to the batter. Then, add to the remaining streusel mix about 1/2 cup rolled oats and a bunch of coarsely chopped pecans. You might have to add a little more butter and brown sugar to maintain the proper consistency. Use this for the topping and bake as directed. This makes a tastier and very crunchy top. The first time I made this, we ate about 1/3 of the cake and when I came home the next day my husband had eaten almost all the rest of the cake and picked off ALL of the of the topping!! He tried to blame it on a mouse! This is a new all-time-favorite for us!!

This was an easy recipe (save for the coring, peeling, and dicing of the apples!)and the cake has a nice texture to it. I think the combination of the carmelized apples and the pumpkin work quite well together, and the cake is surprisingly light, which probably triggers the sentiment from others that this is more of a brunch/tea cake. As for myself, I wouldn't hesitate to serve it with a scoop of premium vanilla ice cream as the ending to a nice fall dinner. I will definitely make this a staple of a fall menu, be it brunch or dinner!

I made this cake for a special dinner party and served it with homemade vanilla ice cream. It was a big hit, everyone loved it. It was a good mix between a pie and a cake. Next time, I would add a few more apples to the topping. I thought the top layer of apples would be thicker than what came out when I followed the recipe.

While I thought this was very good and quite moist I felt like something was amiss. The previous reviewers are right - more of a brunch/tea cake. I will make it again and I like the idea of adding nuts-I will add walnuts.

I made this cake for my roommates and family and they loved it. It was excellent served warm with some ice cream. Definitely more of a breakfast/lunch dessert and probably not appropriate for an elegant/special occassion.

Did not knock my socks off, nor those of my guests. Agree with the person who said this is not a dessert cake - much more breakfast/tea time. Lacking a certain excitement for a real dessert.

Rating: 4
This is a great cake. However, when I read the recipe, I felt that the texture of the pumpkin and applies could benefit with some crunch in the steusel. I toasted pecan pieces (small chop) and added them to the 3/4 cup reserved for the struesel. The nuts made such a difference. I urge all of you who make this recipe to add the toasted pecans to the struesel topping before you bake it. I promise, you will not be dissapointed.

It is a good coffee cake. Since I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, I put 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ginger, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, and 1/4 teaspoon all spice.

This is a good cake- simple to make and it keeps very well. Make sure you include all the spices.

A disappointing recipe overall. This is a good morning coffee cake, but I wouldn't serve it as a dessert. It was better with more apple and more strusel on top.

It was "strictly OK" -- there is an apple bundt cake recipe floating around somewhere (made with veggie oil instead of butter) that is MUCH easier and MUCH more delicious. This was not that easy and far from delicious. The pumpkin didn't really come through -- it sounds better than it tastes!

I did not read the reviews, I saw this recipe in October's magazine and decided to use it for a dinner party. I have to say the rest of the menu (as it was printed on the rag) was great (a delicious chicken stew, bread and a great salad with hazelnuts). However, this cake was AWFUL. I was really happy when I found out that it was such an easy cake to make, BUT, what a dissappointment! the pumpkin didn't taste like much, the apples where so so. It wasn't the combination, as much as the lack of flavor or punch. Definitely, not to our tasting.

This was a delicious cake. I had the same thought while eating it as the other reviewer: It would be great with coffee. In fact, it reminded me of a coffee cake. As a bonus, my seven-year-old daughter thought the whole house smelled wonderful. It was well worth the aroma alone!

Very good. Luckily I heeded the advice of previous reviewers, and checked the cake at the 55 minute mark. It was ready to come out of the oven. This dessert is fine by itself, but much improved served alongside a good quality vanilla ice cream.

I made this recipe because the combination of apples and pumpkin sounded so good. I cooked the apples and butter as written, but really don't see the need to. Next time I will just mix the apples, sugar, and cinnamon. I also added the whole can of pumpkin, which was about a cup. The pie turned out fine with the extra pumpkin. I just added a little less sour cream. Everyone liked it, the streusel topping was good. This pie was good with whipped cream.

A nice combination of Fall flavors. This cake went quickly. Easy to make. Will definitely repeat this recipe.

Overall this was tasty, but not fabulous. I also had trouble with it cooking quicker than the recipe stated, hence the outside was a little chewy. I'm going to try again though. The pumpkin/apple combo was nice.

Maybe I did something wrong because my husband and I felt this was nothing special at all. The pumpkin part of this was too dry. I wish I had used the apples for regular old apple crisp.

I've made this cake twice already! It is delicious! Very tasty fall flavors. Also, beautiful to look at. It made a nice addition to the dessert table. The only part that I found time consuming was dicing the apples. I did dice them small so that every bite would have a piece of apple. Highly recommend! A definite repeater for me!!

A wonderful combination of traditional fall flavours! This cake is definitely best the day it's made, as the pumpkin cake part gets a little denser after being in the fridge. Awesome with whipped cream or good vanilla ice cream. A treat for those who have trouble with the texture of pumpkin pie filling.

I made this cake as soon as I saw the picture. Pumpkin and apple, how could you go wrong? I thought the cake turned out good and gave it four stars because my husband polished it off. However I thought the cake part could have used a little more sugar and spice. Either way this cake is easy, yummy, and worth making anytime of the year.

This was very easy to make with delicious results. The only problem I had with it was that the cake part seemed to be a bit dense, but I'm not a big cake eater. I'm used to eating pies. This was good warm or cold (ice cream with warm and whipped cream with cold). I would make this to take to a fall/winter dinner party.
