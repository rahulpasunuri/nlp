I make this for Christmas every year--started making it because my mother loves panforte. The only changes I make are candying my own mixed fruit peel (lemon, orange, grapefruit) instead of using citron, and I skip the melted chocolate. Delicious, deep, spicy, nutty, figgy. Incidentally it also makes a great energy bar for hiking!

I have made this two Christmases in a row and really like it. I may use slightly smaller amounts of some of the ingredients; otherwise no changes. I don't bake it quite so long as the recipe says because my oven is somewhat hot.But everybody who tries it really likes it: it's complex, not too sweet, really delicious.

I followed the directions exactly but used some different dried fruits. However, it burned black before it was even halfway through the baking time! We couldn't even try it, it was ruined. I will try this again another time and be sure to watch it carefully, but I think something must be wrong here!

Added some dried cherries in exchange for some of the other fruit. Will use some mixed peel next time as suggested by others. Like the addition of the sour flavors; fairly sweet as is. As noted by others, watch the cook time. It's kind of hard to tell when it's starting to brown with all that cocoa powder. I'll probably take one out after an hour next time to check. Found the mixing difficult; bad arm. The problem was getting all the flour/cocoa mixtureincorporated. Hard to stir with all the fruit and nuts. Any suggestions besides weightlifting?

Yummy- but you must like fruitcake! All the fruitcake lovers loved this cake but the fruitcake haters didn't. I was too much of a chicken to use all that coriander so I used only 1/2 teaspoon plus 1/2 teaspoon allspice. I also used 1/2 cup citron and 1/2 cup mixed dried fruits and candied peel.

Very similar to the panforte from Sienna. I omitted the cocoa from the recipe (don't increase the flour! it makes it too cakey), but used cocoa to dust the top and sides. The baking time is too long, so watch it. Any mixture of dried fruits should work, so don't get hung up on having the proper ingredients. I used dates and figs and dried cranberries. The aroma is heavenly and it is a great recipe to make with a helper in the kitchen.

This is a very difficult recipe to perform, and I mean perform! Can anybody say Ibuprofen? It should read, "Warning. Do not make this if you have neck, shoulder, or back problems." Seriously though, the flavors are wonderful but the baking time should be reduced by at least a half hour/thirty-five minutes. I do have neck and shoulder problems and I had bought enough ingredients to make cakes for all my friends, so I was committed. So, today I made another batch. Omitted the sugar and butter. Added 3 beaten eggs, 1 tsp of baking soda and 1/4 tsp of salt. Much better.

I prepare this wonderful Christmas treat with a few changes: I omit the cocoa altogether and instead use 1.25 cups flour. I substitute allspice for the coriander, and add a few tbs of maple syrup to the honey mixture. I like a citrus note, so I increase the orange peel and add 3 tb of the fresh juice as well. I use mixed candied peel instead of plain citron so I get notes of grapefruit, which is lovely. Finally, don't be afraid to double or even triple this recipe. A few times I have dragged out my "cauldron" and made a gigantic triple batch of panforte, and it always turns out great. You just need some elbow grease to try and mix the whole thing together! Beacuse I'm a purist, I omit the chocolate coating as well..the recipe just doesn't need it. Enjoy!

This is an outstanding recipe, terrific flavor with subtle (even "mysterious," according to one friend) notes from the spices. I received rave reviews and recipe requests from those I gave it to. I made one substition, dried cherries in place of candied citron, and the cherries were a perfect sweet-tart complement to the other flavors. I found that one recipe made six, 4-inch cakes, baked for a slightly shorter time; these are the perfect size for gift giving as part of an assortment. This is also a good choice for shipping to loved ones far away, because of its long shelf life at room temperature.

Absolutely outstanding and a dead ringer for the panforte I have had in Sienna. The texture is perfect and the flavors complex. Very easy to make. The hardest part was cutting the dried fruit by hand to maintain the integrity of the fruit. I did not find I had to bake it longer than the recipe called for and it made the two cakes only that the receipe says. I had searched long and hard for a panforte recipe and THIS IS IT!

I liked the combination of dense fruit with nuts and chocolate, my wife and another guest felt it was a waste of good hazelnuts and a better use could be found for the ingredients.

I've never made anything like this before so it was both challenging and fun. I substituted the candied citron with a combination of dried pineapple, ginger, and cranberries. I skipped the choclate finish and dusted confectioner's sugar over the top. A co-worker claimed "This is the best damn thing I've tasted in a long time!"

A brilliant combination of flavors. I would consider making the panforte about a week early to let the flavors ripen, then finishing with the chocolate when ready to serve or give.

I came across this recipe while searching for recipes for the dessert course for our neighborhood progressive New Year's eve party. It was a great take home favor(I cut it into small wedges, wrapped in colored plastic wrap and tied with ribbon. The greatest part was that it was a recipe that could be made well in advance and provide a unique flavor and texture to the party. Although it has several indredients (and I did make a few substiutions for the fruit types (according to what I had on hand- just making sure to keep the ratios correct)it was very to put togather and store. I did wait until the day of the party to add the finishing touches of chocolate glaze (a great way to use up the rest of the dipping chocolate from my truffles) and cocoa powder dusting. Will definitely make my keeper recipe file

I have made this as gifts for friends every year since it was first published in 1990. They have begged me for it and most of them tell me they even hide it from their spouses so they don't have to share! It has a deep & complex flavor. The combination of soft fruits and crunchy nuts is great. Our winters can be warm here so I have never used the chocolate coating - just dusted with a good cocoa powder. I may try the glaze this year.

It tasted better than I thought and did make a good Christmas gift. I found that the quantity made three cakes. Will definitely make again this Christmas.

This recipe has 1001 ingredients, but it's so worth it. It's a provincial, deep flavor that's almost exotic, and very appropriate at Christmastime. And it beats all other fruitcake recipes!

This IS delicious, but I had to bake it much longer than recipe said to get top dry and then it was overbaked. I will experiment witih baking time when I make it again.

This is the best panforte recipe I have tried. Wonderful memories of Siena with every bite. The bittersweet chocolate coating is perfect.
