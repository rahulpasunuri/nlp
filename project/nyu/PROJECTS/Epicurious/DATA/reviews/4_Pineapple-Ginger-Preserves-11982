This was good, but a bit too sweet, possibly because I made it with very ripe gold pineapples. Even though I have a powerful sweet tooth, if I were to make this again I would definitely add lime juice and possibly a pinch of salt to cut the sweetness.

Sooo good! Soooo easy! I have had Pineapply ginger preserves before (from a local farmstand) and it was so good. I couldn't find it for the longest time and decided to search it out online and I am so glad I did. I use this in thumbprint cookies and always get reve reviews! Thank you so much for posting this wonderful recipe.

MMM I'm surprised so few people have made/rated this! It's delicious. I got a free pineapple from a friend and had some ginger lying around so I gave this a try. Halved it and after like 75 minutes of simmering it STILL had not reached 220 according to my candy thermometer but it was really thick so I stopped it there. It tasted delicious and spicy from the ginger. i also left some larger pieces of ginger in there along with some smaller bits. the halved recipe filled up 3 half-pint mason jars.

I made this at Thanksgiving to use as a relish with baked ham. My guests loved it. I added a finely chopped jalapeno pepper and made about half of this recipe. Cooked it about an hour (less water) and mashed it up at the end so the pineapple and ginger were soft. Yum!

This is a great way to use pineapple! I served it warm with caramel sauce for grilled banana splits! I hope pineapple goes on sale at the supermarket again.

This is so good for it's simple ingredients. I left the ginger in larger dice so that it would be chunks of crystalized ginger. I just stirred some into Greek Yogurt and took a trip to heaven. I will definitely make this again.
