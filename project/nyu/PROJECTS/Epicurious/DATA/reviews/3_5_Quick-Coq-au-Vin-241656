I used 10 boneless skinless thighs, pancetta instead of bacon, less oil, more mushrooms, less wine and more broth. We didn't eat it till the next day, as is recommended by other recipes, and I think that made it even better. I loved how tender the wine made the chicken. There was a lot of liquid, so I ended up boiling it for a while without the lid. Still a lot of liquid at the end.

I made this for the most part as written, but I didn't have bacon and I used lg carrots in moderate size chunks. It had pretty good flavor, but I was a little disappointed that the wine over powered many of the other flavors. I think that next time I will reduce the amount of wine put in and will increase the chicken broth. I loved how tender the chicken was! It just fell apart beautifully (even if it was a strange purple color).

Truly outstanding -- and easy! I made this as a weeknight dinner for two, because I happened to have crimini mushrooms and bone-in chicken thighs. Made half the recipe, but upped the garlic somewhat and added some tomato paste as suggested by another reviewer. Also made sure there was plenty of salt and pepper seasoning the flour. And, I did everything I could to fully develop the color and flavor: browning the chicken sufficiently, using crimini (vs. button) mushrooms, adding the tomato paste. The result was outstanding in all respects. My sauce cooked down beautifully. I wouldn't have wanted to thicken or enrich it further with cornstarch, a roux, or anything. I used the pearl onions, which had great flavor, and also used fresh cut regular carrots instead of the baby carrots, as another reviewer suggested. Definitely will make again!

I love this recipe. Perfect for a casual dinner party. I've made it 3 or 4 times, and I always cook it much longer than the 45min. More like 5 hours. I serve over mashed potatoes, and it's always a hit. Next day, if there are left overs I bake them in pie dough for an incredible savory turnover. YUM!

Easiest coq au vin I have ever made - great taste with minimal effort. I used regular onions chopped up, had no mushrooms, chopped the garlic - you know? - you can play around with these recipes and sometimes it is still great food!

Made this tonight for a Bastille Day dinner. Wonderfully simple and delicious. Followed the recommendations of a few others and added more garlic and tomato paste; then thickened the sauce with corn starch. Served with crusty french bread and Chocolate Mousse for dessert. Vive la France (for today anyway)!

I love this dish, and so does my husband and my mom. Since I don't eat red meat, I substituted a couple of andouille turkey sausages for the bacon, used a bottle of decent red, and about 5 cloves of garlic. Oh, and I used regular carrots cut up, since I hate the flavor of those so-called mini carrots. For the chicken, I used a combination of boneless skinless thighs and some drumsticks. I'm going to try adding some cut up new potatoes next time, but crusty french bread is a very nice foil too! I like to sprinkle the coq with a bit of chopped Italian parsley just before serving; that bit of fresh, herbal flavor nicely offsets the deep, mellow sweetness of this dish. It isn't bland in the least (I have zero tolerance for bland); it has a fabulous balance of sweet/tart/savory.

Very good recipe and easy to make. I agree with some of the other cooks here - it requires a bit more seasoning (salt, pepper), but that is easily adjusted after the fact. I used white wine and added a pat of butter to the sauce at the end to enrich it a bit as suggested. I also threw a couple of new potatoes on top of everything and they steamed up nicely. I would definitely make this again.

used about a 3/4 bottle of chardonnay - drank the rest while cooking. I was out of mushrooms and substituted 6-8 prunes, quartered. As weird as that sounds, they dissolved and gave a great complexity to the sauce. I didn't need the roux, as others had suggested. I also added about a pound of parsnips, just 'cause they were in the bottom of the fridge. It was a great meal.

I've made this recipe several times with white wine. I make a few minor tweaks here & there (I cut back the liquid ingredients a bit, and use boneless, skinless chicken thighs), but otherwise follow the recipe. I serve over mashed potatoes. This is always a hit in my house.

The dish itself is tasty but not excellent. I also added a tablespoon of tomato paste like another reviewer (and if you check Julia Child, she also does thsi) and thickened the sauce with a roux. I think without those two additions it would have been somewhat mediocre. A good version for making coq au vin quickly, but not ideal.

simply delicious! i modified it just slightly with more garlic and an untraditional addition of one tablespoon of tomato paste after i removed the chicken.( i know, blasphemy!) i then simmered and reduced the sauce down till it was thickened a bit more. i was tempted to add butter but the tomato paste added th richness i was seeking without extra fat. i don't think this recipe would taste right if you just used chicken breasts the flavor would be off.

I've made better versions of chicken in wine. This one is just... bland? And with coq au vin you don't want any extra strikes against it, since it's already not very pretty. I don't know if this is worth the bottle of wine.

We did not love this recipe. I used 4 chicken breasts (with skin & bones) but otherwise followed the recipe. I felt it was missing depth as others have said. Probably won't make this again.

I've made this recipe at least 4 times and it's a hit every time. I've made Julia's, Ina's, Cook's Illustrated, you name it, and this recipe is the best. I follow it exactly. NO substitutions!

I cooked this meal tonight and I really enjoyed it. I loved the fact that it took so little time and it only required a pot a plate and a spoon. I added a bit more garlic than required and also when I was sauteing veggies I added little red potatoes, cooked them first in butter then added the veggies. I also took out the olive oil and used, of course, BUTTER!!

I wonder if the reviewer who fed this to her cat has ever eaten coq au vin before - the vegetables looked stained?- they were cooked in red wine so what would one expect? I have used both red and white and like them both - this is a very nice quick coq au vin recipe.

I thought this dish sounded fantastic, and it looked visually stunning even though the vegetables were stained. I used Cote du Rhone wine and more herbs than the recipe required. It smelt amazing! But then my cat ate it so I gave it a one.

Good, easy recipe. I cooked it with thighs and breasts, boneless and with skin. Next time I will bump up the seasonings and try a bit of tomato paste. I used white wine, and the dish looked lovely. I disagree with the review that called the recipe messy. What's messy about one pot, one plate, one plastic bag, a cutting board, a stirring spoon and a knife?

This is really between two and three forks. I used skin on chicken thighs and added more garlic and more thyme and a little rosemary. It was nice and easy to make and smelled absolutley wonderful. It didn't look so great however, a kind of sickly purple color took over. The taste was nice, but surprisingly bland for the ingredients that went into it. It needed salt and a good bit of pepper. Even then it needed something else that I couldn't place. I might try it again, but I would season it more aggressively.

An excellent version of coq au vin! Some users have complained about the wine staining the vegetables - keep in mind that a deep red - such as a merlot or a cabernet - will result in a much darker color than a lighter red - like a Cotes Du Rhone. If you enjoy a heavier sauce remove the chicken and vegetables and boil down the sauce for 10 minutes or so at medium-high heat. You can also thicken with a roux of flour and softened butter - but it makes the dish VERY rich.

We just finished having this for dinner and my family loved it! We used chicken breasts because that's what I had; finished a bottle of white wine and added a splash of the red we were having with dinner; a handful of small red potatoes, 1/2 sprig of tarragon - then other ingredients as per recipe. It was yummy. It would have been yummier, I'm sure, if we used a whole chicken but even with the chicken breasts it was tender and flavorful. We served it over noodles as is traditional. I'll definitely make it again. It was easy. The only time consuming thing was chopping the onions and the carrots. I think I will also try the addition of a squeeze of tomato paste as other reviews have suggested. But for an out-of-the-pantry/fridge meal it was great! Oh and my kids are 14, 12, and 7.

After reading the reviews for this recipe, i added chicken bullion to the sauce and made sure to leave the vegetable choped large which resulted in a flavorful sauce with distinguishable vegetables. I also didn't use the creepy, flavorless "baby" carrots recommended in the recipe. Next time i would use white wine to avoid the stained vegetables.

Maybe I messed up this recipe, but I found it to be bland and boring. The veggies disappeared in the sauce, and the sauce was rather watery and uninteresting. I even let it reduce down by half, and it was still not especially good. For the expense, I don't think that this recipe is worth it.

Great recipe. I added tomato paste and used Cotes du Rhone wine which was perfect to complement the chicken and veggies.

We served this recipe tonight 4-13- 08 and it was fantastic! I added some tomato paste and used Cotes du Rhone wine which was perfect. I would do it again because of the rave reviews it got.

Maybe I did something wrong, but the purple leftovers were not very appetizing. And the meal itself, just okay. My husband did like it though.

Not impressed; tasty sauce but messy prep and unappealing presentation--the vegs turned purple from the red wine-- yuck. Based on reviews I made a double batch and froze half so we'll have to have it again and no-one will be excited about that.

Years ago, JC's version of this dish was a standard in my repertoire. I don't cook like that anymore, but was drawn to this recipe for its ease and ingredients. It's pretty good but just seemed to lack depth of flavor. First I added about a quarter cup of cognac; that helped but not enough. The key is 2T of tomato paste. Just buy the tube and squirt it in. Makes the difference. Let it simmer on the stove for a little longer than the recipe suggests. Also, cook it a day in advance and reheat.

I made it to the letter. It was delicious. I need to watch my cholesterol so I will cut down a little on fat in a few places but not much. This will be a splurge meal for us.

I thought this was alright but not so good that I would make it again. Next I plan to try an authentic Coq au vin recipe.

Very tasty and easy! Actually 3.5 forks for me, too. I used skinless,boneless chicken thighs which were delicious and tender. I would use more bacon next time. (However, my daughter ate more than half of the bacon I'd sauteed before I could add it back into the pot!). It also needed a good bit of salt and pepper at the table, so I might use more of that while it's cooking. Overall, it's a keeper! My family loved it!

Really delicious! And easy for a beginning cook too! Like the others, I pretty much followed the instructions to a T. If you aren't cooking a whole chicken (which I didn't) I would suggest getting chicken legs (basically drumsticks + thighs). Three large ones weight about 2 pounds and so I just halved the recipe. Next time I will definitely serve w/either some potatoes or garlic bread on the side. The sauce is too good to just leave alone after the chicken's all gone!

Even my French husband loved this Coq Au Vin. I pretty much followed the recipe using a decent, but inexpensive red wine, pearl onions, homemade chicken broth, and whole baby portabello mushrooms - which worked out fine. I couldn't help drinking the sauce it was so delish; even better the next day. Served with whole potatoes, boiled then peeled and sauteed in butter.

I loved this recipe. Super easy to make and very tasty. I did use frozen pearl onions and inexpensive red wine. Still to die for...

I'd actually give this 3.5 forks - very easy to make and delicious - let the chicken cool slightly before eating - absorbs more of the flavor of the broth. Paired this with the red leaf/orange salad and the pear clafoutis - yum!
