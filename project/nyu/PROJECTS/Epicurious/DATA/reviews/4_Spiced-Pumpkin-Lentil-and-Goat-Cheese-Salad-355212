Pretty darn good! It's an easy salad. I prepped the pumpkin & lentils ahead of time, and quickly threw everything together right before I served it. It's so easy to throw together that it would make a great a quick lunch or dinner, if you're in a pinch -- just save some pumpkin/lentil mix in the fridge and you can put the salad together in minutes! This is a new go-to salad, definitely making it again and again for myself and guests. Side note: I'm a HUGE fan of smoked paprika. It's a beautiful and complex addition to any dish, adding an unexpected depth. Strangely enough, it was less expensive than the regular paprika at Whole Foods. I highly recommend it; you will use it often.

This salad is excellent! I use butternut squash, which took 25 minute total to cook. Lentil took only 20 minutes. Omitted mint. Used white wine vinegar since I didn't have red. Amazing taste combination!

For a recipe listed as low cal, healthy, etc., this is an incredibly rich-tasting salad, and it is delicious. I opted for butternut squash, and the roasting of it with the cumin and hot smoked paprika is tasty enough to make on its own if you wanted to. But the combination of everything together is really special, delicious and unique. I wanted to try this out even though it's still summer, but I will definitely be making this again in the fall.

This was a nice change from your typical salad but what took it from good to great is the balsamic reduction I drizzled over the top of each serving. I used another recipe from this site -- Seared Salmon with Balsamic Glaze. 1/4c balsamic, 1/4c water, 1 1/2T lemon juice and 4t brown sugar. Mix together and reduce until the desired thickness. Reducing in a non-stick saute pan works better than a sauce pan (more surface area). This reduction is soooo good - would be great on lots of things. Try it!

So good! The textures and flavors blend so well. I made this salad for a lazy, foggy Saturday late lunch/early dinner, paired with a pumkin- apple soup. I did make a few changes which turned out wonderfully. 1. Instead of using crumbly goat cheese mixed into the salad, I took round rinded french style goat cheese cut into 2" slices, pan fried in olive oil and lay atop the composed salad. The cheese oozed out into the lentils in a nice way. 2. There is no smoked spanish paprika to be had here in Eastern Europe, so I substituted with 1/2 tsp sweet paprika and 1/2 ground chipotle chile (which I smuggled back from the US). The pumpkin had a nice spice kick from this. 3. Green lentils cooked for 20 minutes to a perfect al dente 4. Pumpkin cooked for 20 minutes and was almost too soft but still held its shape. All in all, an A+ salad. Id happily serve it as a main course at a vegetarian dinner party or Thanksgiving. Yum!

I really liked this recipe, though I made few modifications. I chose to omit the arugala (I didn't have any) and the mint (i just couldn't imagine it). I toasted some pumpkin seeds towards the end when the butternut squash was roasting. I used fig balsamic vinegar in place of red wine. I bet adding a reduced balsamic would be great too. The recipe works fine with green lentils (not French). I'll be making this again and again!

I thought this recipe was pretty good. I ended up using butternut squash instead of pumpkin since the pumpkin I bought didn't turn out too great. I only used 1/2 the amount of oil on the squash and it still roasted up nicely. I also added a bay leaf to the lentils while cooking. I would probably make it again.

Rating: 4
This was a delicious fall salad! I used half the amount of olive oil and goat cheese and it was still great. The squash only needed to be cooked for about 23 minutes in my oven and came out the perfect texture. I did not use the mint and used regular paprika. Easy, healthy, and yummy! This will be in regular rotation this fall.

Two thumbs up on this one...the flavors need to meld together a bit but hubby and I love it! Watch that both your lentils and squash don't get too mushy.

Loved this salad. Very healthy vegetarian. Super-good at room temperature, so it is an easy do-ahead recipe. Used butternut squash, since pumpkin is out of season. Also, the second time I made it, I drizzled the squash with maple syrup while roasting, because I enjoyed the extra sweetness.

I can nearly always rely on my fellow cooks' reviews. On this one you steered me wrong. Very, very wrong. I pulled up the recipe again to make sure this wasn't an evil April Fool's joke. We all took one bite and promptly threw it all out. I made it exactly as written but the flavor combination--mint, red wine vinegar, goat cheese, cumin--truly awful. But at least the texture was mushy.

Rating: 4
I love the flavour combinations. This is a great salad and very easy to make on a Sunday and then take to work for lunch during the week. I accidentally made this with mung beans once as I didn't pay close attention to which dried bean I was soaking and it turned out pretty good anyway.

Absolutely wonderful! Made this salad for Christmas Eve dinner as our "something different" dish and it is truly wonderful. The sweet squash is a lovely contrast the smoky paprika and the tangy goat cheese. The cook times on the recipe seem excessive and could be contributing to the mush factor for some. I used both delicata squash and pumpkin, after 20 minutes the squash cubes were cooked through and firmer, the pumpkin was mush softer. I boiled the lentils with garlic and salt for 12 minutes and that was perfect. I tried the red wine vinegar and did not think it complimented the salad, so I made a new dressing with olive oil, smoked paprika, cumin, salt and the juice of one orange, lemon, and lime.

The first bite I took of this salad was delicious. It must have had the perfect combination of all the ingredients. Every bite after the first was fairly average. The textures together were a bit odd and while the flavors were good in perfect proportion, they weren't very good if the bite was imbalanced. If there is a way to ensure the perfect bite every time I'd say go for it. Otherwise it wasn't worth it.

Rating: 4
Great fall recipe. Followed according to recipe with a few exceptions: omitted the mint (couldn't picture it in there), used mixed greens instead of only arugula. I also saved the seeds from the butternut squash, tossed in some melted butter and a little salt and brown sugar, and baked in the oven until they were crispy. This added a nice variation in texture. I will definitely make this again. It was plenty filling and the lentils give it enough protein to qualify as an entree on its own.

So easy and delicious! Used cooked black lentils from Trader Joes and a Kabocha squash from our CSA box. Needed more dressing so used a little oil and vinegar.

I can't get over this salad. Every time I make it, it's a huge success- guests go for seconds, thirds, and even fourths sometimes I usually omit the lentils, but even so, it's still a hearty salad. The flavor and texture combination is unique, which is exactly why I adore it so much. This is one of my favorite recipes this fall!

Just made this for a dinner party last night and it was a super success. I may have made a bit much and am hoping that it will still be good today. Prepared this recipe as is, with one substitution. I used mixed greens instead of arugula and it was still incredible. The flavor combination was delicious and my guests all loved it. I'm definitely making this again for weeknight dinners. I think you could prepare the lentils and squash ahead of time then assemble whenever....

This was a delightful, hearty fall dish I made to welcome the new season. I used chevre cheese, because it was leftover. However, it really needed a crunchy, salty element, so I added roasted pistachio nuts. It was an inspired addition! I imagine you could also use salted pepitas if no pistachios on hand.

This is a great salad. I left out the arugala since I wanted to prepare ahead of time. It was great even without the greens served either at room temp or out of the refrigerator.

Made this with butternut squash, but had to sub regular lentils (couldn't find french green). Was amazed how everything came together. I thought the different textures (mushy lentils, tender squash, crisp greens, cold cheese) wouldn't come together but they did. On a remake I'd sub some different greens (maybe baby spinach or just mixed fields greens) rather than arugula. For reheating purposes keep the squash / lentils separate and dish out portions into individual plates, we made a big bowl of the salad so when reheating have to warm the greens and cheese, which I'd prefer to keep separate and just warm the lentils and squash.

Rating: 4
Fantastic. I used paprika and chipotle in the absence of smoked paprika. I also accidentally tossed in some ground coriander. Wonderful. This is a very complex tasting dish. I can see why some people wouldn't like it, but I happen to love all of the flavors. I'm not sure who said it was bland...they must have done something odd like omitting mint or picked out an unripe squash... I mixed the red wine vinegar with balsamic and olive oil for more dressing. Yum yum yum.

I made this recipe exactly as written. My fiancee tasted it and declared it inedible, a surprising review from a man that absolutely adores my cooking. I wasn't happy with it either.

This is a real winner. I made this as described except that I substituted spinach for the arugula. It was a great combination of sweet, spicy, and salty, and the lentils gave it a nice crunch (maybe they were underdone, but I liked them that way). I'm planning to make this for the second time in a month tonight.

I love this recipe, except that I substitute the pumpkin for diced/chopped sweet potatoes. The sweet potatoes can be roasted to whatever texture you like--soft and moist or browned and chewy. However they're roasted, the mush factor is alleviated. I also add garlic to the lentils (as recommended by another reviewer) and substitute feta for goat cheese if I don't have the latter. I've also found that sliced radishes add a nice crunch to the dish.

Despite the reviews I was still surprised this came out so well. There is still a bit of an issue with the pumpkin being a bit mushy and you may want to fiddle with the dressing a bit. But still a really nice dish with unusually combined components. In the category of: 'and now for something completly different."

I had 3 girlfriends over for lunch and I mad e a Pumpkin Coconut Bisque soup and I served this salad. The salad was a hit!!! I was able to find the Sugar Pumpkin (it was a major pain in the neck carving it....) however I roasted the seeds and everyone put them on the salad. I could not find French green lentils so I used the Goya lentils. We enjoyed the recipe so much I'm making it for Thanksgiving.

I was skeptical about the combination of ingredients at first, but gave it a try and it was a very satisfying dinner. I had some white lentils which were probably more delicate than the French kind, so I added toasted almonds, which tasted sooo good with the squash - I used butternut. I added chopped apple as another review suggested, but it didn't quite work for me with the savory flavor of the squash. Also used a cheddar style goat cheese, but next time I'd stick with the soft variety. A good salad to experiment with. It did need extra dressing, as others said.

I adapted this recipe for use as a side dish and substituted a bland winter squash that was lying around and it turned out great! I put the squash on the barbeque instead of the oven and added some roasted Red pepper to the dish. Skipped the arugula and vinegar. A colorful, healthy, economical, and tasty side dish that we all enjoyed!

LOVED this. I'm new to vegetarian cooking and this did not leave me wanting for more! I followed the advice of the other comments and added garlic to the water for the lentils. I substituted cayenne for paprika and white balsamic for the red wine vinegar. I also added thinly sliced red onions to the arugula and spiced pecans - YUM. I want to make it again tonight :)

This needs to be eaten alongside something really savory (and preferably fatty) - otherwise the pumpkin's sweetness just tastes bland and watery. It worked really well as a substantial side dish to accompany small spicy merguez sausages. Chorizo would also work. Like many others, I felt the recipe needed tweaking. I added some pomegranate seeds for freshness, crunch, and color. Sherry vinegar has a sharpness that helps balance the pumpkin. I also used spinach instead of arugula - the spinach wilted a bit when I mixed it with the lentils and cheese, which was nice. Wilted arugula is actually pretty nasty. Next time I'll add some garlic and maybe some slices of jerusalem artichoke.

This was a very good fall salad. Really liked the spices used for the pumpkin - so much that I used them on a chicken breat too. It made a tasty addition. The flavors combined well. Will try to make the pumpkin a little crispier next time.

This was a complex, delicious recipe and one I'll probably make again despite the work involved. I followed the recipe except for the following deviations: I sprinkled cayenne pepper on the pumpkin before roasting, and I mixed the red wine vinegar with olive oil to make a vinaigrette for the salad. I wish I had cooked the lentils less - they lost color and were a little mushy.

This is an absolutely lovely salad. I overcooked the lentils by accident, but it still made a delightful fall meal. A small sugar pumpkin only made about 3 cups, but the spices were delicious! Don't skip the mint -- it really adds something special. Also, I was using very soft chevre, and (as I often do in salads) mixed it into the arugula until it completely coated every leaf. I can't wait to serve this at a dinner party -- simple, beautiful and memorable!

I made this salad at the start of Spring, here in Australia. I found it very delicious, the smoked hot paprika added to the flavour of the pumpkin.The combination of flavours were exceptional. I used tinned and drained lentils, worked well.

Yum! A big hit with my whole family, including kids. I added about 1/2 cup toasted pecans and a tiny bit of chicken (grilled, then sliced) for the carnivores in my house. Definitely needs a bit more vinaigrette than what is called for (the pumpkin absorbs all of the oil, so there's none left in the pan), but that's a really easy fix. Will try again with blue cheese and maybe a little bit of onion or garlic cooked into the lentils to give them a bit more "punch".

Read it this afternoon & made it tonight! I LOVE IT. g/f just dropped off a big bag of cut up pumpkin - she only wanted the seeds! Recipe looked interesting so I gave it a shot. Had to sub a few items - didn't have goat cheese but used combo of feta & Gorgonzola, used baby spinach I just happened to have.

Not my favorite. Palatable but not worth making it again. I took my pumpkin out 2/3 the way through the recommended time and it was total mush. The overcookedness of the pumpking does contribute to my underwhelmedness however not enough in comparison to the fairly bland, overly earthy taste in my opinion.

I made this last night with a smallish pie pumpkin and was underwhelmed. The pumpkin was spicy but there was really no taste to it besides the spices, so that's probably the reason. As I was tasting it, I added some crispy pepper bacon to up the flavors. It helped, but even with a generous mix of mint with the arugula, it was kind of blah.

This salad is really yummy, but even better it's a good starting point since you can mix it up any number of ways. I've done it the written way, I've left out the mint, I've put in apples, I've put in walnuts and cheddar cheese, and often I just bring lentils, the roasted pumpkin (or squash) and lettuce of some sort to work and put premade salad dressing on it. The lentil + roasted pumpkin on a salad are lovely.

I'm sorry, i really looked forward to making this dish, and was overwhelmingly disappointed. Maybe it was the fact that the butternut squash I bought ended up being a bit mealy, but I found this to be dry, and really bland. I added more mint than called for, and I did also substitute blue cheese for the goat cheese (can't stand goat cheese). All of the oil/dressing was absorbed into the squash and lentils and there was nothing left to coat the beautiful arugula I bought at the farmer's market. I am glad I didn't make this for guests, and will not be trying it again. Boo!

I love this salad! It's a great balance of flavors and textures. This salad is hearty yet healthy, and perfect for those cool fall evenings. Being in Japan, I had to adjust the recipe according to the ingredients at my disposal. I used kabocha instead of pumpkin. No lentils on hand, so I substituted black beans instead, which worked quite well. Like other reviewers, I mixed the paprika with cayenne pepper. Goat cheese, wasn't available, so I opted for an aged white cheddar. I must say that the fresh mint added an extra dimension to the salad and it brought all of the flavors together perfectly. I made a vinaigrette using white wine vinegar and fresh-squeezed sudachi juice. I made it tonight as an accompaniment with pan-fried sea bream and vegetables steamed in an oden dashi stock. My partner raved about both dishes. This salad is very filling, so next time I make it, it will be as a main course salad.

I loved the low-maintenance version I made of this. I wanted a quick dinner, so I simmered the squash (I know, the texture and flavor suffers a little), then dumped the water and sauteed the squash with spices. I also used feta instead of goat cheese, beluga lentils instead of French, and made a vinaigrette with a little Champagne vinegar, orange zest, moutarde a l'ancienne and olive oil. The mint brings it all together. It was perfect for a rainy fall night! I just served with bread on the side and my bf and I were both full afterward.

Wonderful blend of Autumnal flavors; smokey, slightly sweet, earthly. The mint brightens everything up. My smoked paprika wasn't hot, so I took another's advice and added a little cayenne. I also had sherry vinegar on hand so used that instead of the red wine. This is a very flexible delicious salad I'll be making again and again.

I was given this recipe for our "gourmet club" contribution without photo. Now that I see the photo, mine looked different because I really mixed together well the pumpkin, lentils, goat cheese, etc and the cheese made a creamy coating on everything. It worked out fine and everyone loved it. I used small black, green, orange and beige lentils (you can tell I'm not a gourmet since I'm sure they have a name) and they were nice because they didn't overtake the texture. Hardly needed to cook them. I used white wine vinegar. I also could only find smoked Spanish paprika, not hot smoked. I think next time I'd put in a little cayenne as a reader suggested. I'm making this again soon for a group. I am going to add chopped toasted walnuts this time. I felt the nutty flavor would complement the dish. It's a great vegetarian meal!

Rating: 4
I thought this was awesome. I made an actual dressing with vinegar, oil and cumin along with a tiny bit of brown sugar and mixed it with the lentils because some other reviewers complained of blandness and it seemed to go well. I also didn't have arugula so I served over baby greens. Really good!

Rating: 4
I made this salad for a group of friends and we all loved it! I added salt and pepper to the water in which I boiled the lentils. Since I could not find the pimenton at my grocery store I used Spanish smoked paprika and added a little sprinkle of cayenne pepper, to spice up the squash. I usually would not save leftover salad, but this tasted delicious for lunch the next day, all of the flavors mingled nicely. Although, I would have loved to serve this recipe with warm squash, I had to prepare it a couple of hours ahead and it was still delicious, after sitting awhile.

If I was to make this again, which I probably won't, I would have to change quite a few things. First of all, I don't know why I listened to the directions and actually boiled the lentils for half an hour as opposed to simmering them for a little longer. They had a terrible texture, as well as being bland. If I did this again, I would stir some vinegar and maybe some mustard directly into the lentils, because the vinegar that the whole salad gets tossed with is not enough to flavor the lentils. The vinegar, by the way, is not doing much for the salad. Next time I would spend 2 more minutes and make a vinaigrette. I'm undecided about the goat cheese-perhaps blue would be better, as another person suggested. Some toasted pumpkin seeds might also be nice. The only really good thing about this recipe was the squash. It was delicious. Maybe I'll make that again.

Rating: 2
I'm not sure everything quite works together, texture-wise, especially. The firm mush of the squash seems at odds with the al dente lentils and weak punctuation of arugula. But in the end I rather liked nibbling on this from time to time. I would add more arugula and not skimp on the goat cheese (I suspect that the cheese is what makes it work at all).

I completely agree with the last reviewer about this recipe being flexible.(My dog liked the squash as well but I made sure to guard it after reading the last review!) I used butternut squash and feta cheese. Luckily, there was just enough mint left in my flower bed for the recipe. Curry and chili powders made up for my roommate using all of the cumin and not replacing it. A simple recipe with complex flavors, I will surely prepare it again soon.

Rating: 4
okay, this was an adventure. The point of this review is that this recipe is flexible depending upon your circumstances. The dog ate my roasted butternut squash while it was cooling (yes, really!) so I substituted sweet potato. Because I used the last of my smoked paprika on the purloined squash, I used a little bit of chipotle chili instead. Then, because there was no time to cool the sweet potato before serving I put it on the salad warm. I liked it this way. Lastly, I subbed feta for the goat cheese because my daughter does not like goat cheese. Very good!

Easily one of the top 10 Bon Appetit recipes this year, if not in the past 5 years. Really exceptional flavor pairing - non-traditional and yet completely perfect. I loved the mint and agree that it adds something unexpected and special. I've made it with pumpkin and with butternut squash, and I think it's better with butternut squash. My husband and I often have main-course salads for dinner on a weeknight, and this makes a great addition to the fall/winter repertoire. The lentils make it more hearty and satisfying than our other stand bys.

This is a fantastic salad! I made it for a dinner party last night and it was a big hit. I couldn't find sugar pumpkin at the store so I opted for butternut squash. If you are looking for a little color on the squash, you may need to cook it for a little longer or perhaps at a higher temp than the recipe calls. I know previous reviewers say you don't need the mint but I think it adds that extra deliciousness to the salad that just can't be ignored.

I just made this recipe last night. It is SO good! The pumpkin is a delicious treat. It's healthy and hearty, and with the seasonings it makes this salad taste like a treat for good behavior. I added the mint, and loved it. I can see that it would be fine without, but it gives the salad a little extra zing that is truly delicious. Because I couldn't find baby arugula in my grocery store, I ended up tossing the salad over field greens that had arugula in them instead. It was great! My only warning is that cutting raw pumpkin was a little more difficult that I anticipated. Don't try it with a small knife, like I did - it's not worth it. If you're substituting the goat cheese, I'd try feta, or bleu cheese. Both would be acceptable (I'd lean more towards the feta, because it's very similar to goat cheese).

This recipe is really delicious! It's hard to believe that so relatively few ingredients can come together to such a delicious, tasty meal (which is basically how I ate this, as a main dish). I did make some very small changes: added 3-4 cloves of garlic to roast with the squash; added some cracked black pepper to the lentils (and a tiny bit of thyme, though really not needed); and used baby spinach instead of arugula; and also disregarded the mint. I made this as a somewhat composed salad--didn't mix them all together until I piled them on the plate--and I added some grilled portabellas, sliced, too. Delicious, and highly recommended.

This is a fantastic recipe! I didn't have mint on hand either, like the previous reviewer, but it came out amazingly well. I used normal paprika instead of the hot one as that's what I had on hand. We ate it as a side with fish. My husband raved about the taste, and he's not a big pumpkin fan.

Rating: 4
This was a very nice mix of flavors and textures. I forgot to add the mint, but it was good without it. Also, could not really taste the pimenton--if you don't have it on hand I think the squash would be just as good without it, or tossed with a bit of regular paprika.
