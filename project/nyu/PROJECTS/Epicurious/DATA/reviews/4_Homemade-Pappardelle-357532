Grandma, aunts, and girl cousins would made these by hand with a rolling pin. We had the tables and counters were we would stand and roll this, and other noodles out. We kept the counters and tables covered with a thin layer of flour. Many hands made less work and we would tell stories and chatter while we would work. It took a good part of the afternoon but we ate well that night and went home with fresh dried noodles. It is easier with a pasta machine.

I have not made this yet because I don't have a pasta machine. Can this be made without one?

Not sure why KathiSue gave this recipe only 3 stars when she loved it, however it is a basic recipe that was well described for the "First-time" users. With that in mind it is four (4) stars!

The pappardelle was light and delicious. I tossed the cooked noodles with a little olive oil so they wouldn't stick together, set it on a bed of fresh spinach and topped it with sauteed garlic, fresh basil & oyster mushrooms--it was lovely. This was my first time making homemade noodles and it was surprisingly easy but most definitely time-consuming. Next time I'll make them a day ahead. This recipe is a keeper!
