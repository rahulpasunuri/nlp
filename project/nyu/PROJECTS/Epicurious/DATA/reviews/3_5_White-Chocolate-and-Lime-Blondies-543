tasty dessert - the white chocolate and lime are a great combo. it came out more like a cake than a chewy, moist blondie, however. i'd try one less egg next time. some coconut flakes would add nice texture and flavor too. it could be a little more exciting all in all...

I realize I'm in the minority here, but I thought these blondies were terrible. Admittedly, they have a lovely, moist texture, but they were so cloyingly sweet that I couldn't take more than a bite or two. I used less white chocolate (Lindt) than the recipe called for, and added in more lime peel and some lime juice as other reviewers suggested, but I still found the bars (even without filling) so oppressively sweet as to be unpalatable. I also thought the white chocolate gave them a strangely artificial flavor, as if I had used a boxed cake mix instead of starting from scratch.

Delish. I wanted to make something cakey with lime and I ran across these blondies. I made it without the filling and added 4 tablespoons of key lime juice and omitted the vanilla and lime peel. I also added white chocolate chips to the batter. Amazing. Also, 35 minutes was too long for my oven, next time I'll start checking after 28 minutes.

This was awesome. I cut the blondies into 4 squares split it in half. Put the bottom 4 slices back in the pan spread the filling on top of that put the tops on filling. The portion size for this recipe is way off. I cut the 4 slices into 4 being this is so rich. Everyone enjoyed this on top of being already full from a big dinner. Other than presantation I followed recipe to a "t" other than using white choc chips to scatter over blondie dough before baking.

unbelievably good. i actually just made the blondie w/o the topping, added some white chocolate chips to the mix [not a lot], used egg beaters, didn't actually have grated lime peel but added 2 Tbs. lime juice and cut into bars after everything baked. one word: amazing. great texture [very moist] and taste - especially when chilled. a perfect hint of lime with the subtle richness of creamy, white chocolate. this actually makes cheating on a diet somewhat excusable.

I have made this dish many times over the past few years..and several times just the brownie part. The brownie recipe is good enough to stand on its own. I took previous advice and add 2 T fresh lime juice, extra zest, and a few drops of lime oil. Very good! Love this as a trifle as a previous reviewer suggested: Beautiful presentation and lots of compliments on the unique and wonderful taste.

I'm clearly in the minority on this one. I admit to preferring dark chocolate but was in the mood for white when I tried this recipe. I had anticipated that the tang of lime would provide nice balance to the sweet of the white chocolate. I never intended to make the cream, thinking that if good, the blondies should stand on their own. What can I say. The texture was lovely. The white chocolate definitely provided a richness and subtle vanilla flavor. But overall, they were downright bland I thought. You could increase the lime some which would definitely be an improvement. But too much lime and you'd overpower the choc. I guess I just didn't like them enough to find the optimal proportions. Sorry about this one.

Fantastic! The servings are far too large (we served four and still had leftovers), but that's hardly a complaint. Great flavor, great textures, and fairly easy preparation. I think this will become a dessert mainstay in my house.

This dessert was delicious, and I will make it again, but the servings were definitely too big! I think next time I will either cut smaller hearts or slice one heart into two layers. That would have been perfect. Really...how often does on eat a half pan of brownies in one sitting??

I made this dessert for Valentine's day, and it was wonderful! I will make it often. Love the blondies by themself, and can serve at least 4 people if you cut them into squares. My kids thought this dessert was awesome!!!!

Oh my gosh. The name "White chocolate and lime blondies" does not due this dessert justice. LOVED IT. I added some extra lime to intensify the flavor (yum!). Even my husband, who isn't a huge dessert lover, really liked this one. The combination of flavors is exquisite. The blondies by themselves are excellent. I will make this over and over again.

YUM YUM YUM! I made this with one of the menus offered on epicurious for Valentine's Day Dinner and my husband was in heaven...this is one of the most delicious and impressive looking desserts I've ever made...and it's really easy! Tonight I'm making it but I will do it as a trifle with the blondies and filling layered in a trifle dish...can't wait!

The brownies are delicious both with the filling and without. The lime cuts the sweetness and compliments the white chocolate well. These would also be nice served with a strawberry sauce and a white chocolate dipped strawberry. I was able to serve four with this recipe by cutting smaller hearts.

These are luscious. Go heavy on the lime zest, even adding more than the recipe calls for. I doubled mine and added 2 Tbsp. fresh lime juice to make them even more delectable.
