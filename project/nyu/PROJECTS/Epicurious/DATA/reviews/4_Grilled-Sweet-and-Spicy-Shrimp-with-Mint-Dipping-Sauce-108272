So, so good. I cut the cayenne in half and it was still pretty spicy. I've made the mint sauce as written, and I've also made it with olive oil - I prefer the olive oil.

The shrimp was fine and was truly both sweet and spicy. The "sauce" was like thick oily mint pesto. In the future, I will either just spinkle fresh chopped mint over the cooked shrimp or add some chicken broth to the blender (and maybe cut back on the vegetable oil) to try to make a smoother less "paste-y" sauce.

I love this recipe. It's so simple and always a hit with my guests. Even my 11 year old son loves it. The first time I made it I used the full amount of cayenne pepper and I thought it was way too spicy. The second time I made it I used half the amount of cayenne and thought it was just perfect.

Easy and tasty. I doubled the marinade and let sit for over an hour. I cut the oil for the mint dipping sauce. Was hesitant about the sauce but it was great and added a depth to the shrimp. Rave reviews from all the guests at the BBQ.

this has become my go-to app. the shrimp are skewered and ready to hit the preheated grill as soon as my first guest arrives. the shrimp disappear. everyone LOVES this app!

my take on this recipe is to chop tree ripened apricots, boil in a skillet, adding one red jalapeno and one serrano chili, chopped, large pinch of salt, cracked black pepper, 8 tbsp. brown sugar, and juice of one-half lime. Chill the sauce overnight. Grill the shrimp with Santa Maria Dry Rub (Suzie Q Co., Santa Maria, CA) and paint the shrimp just before taking the shrimp off the grill (high heat, one minute on each side). Serve small ramakins of the sauce on the side! Also, omit the mint sauce!

So good and so easy! My guests loved it.

This was outstanding! I increased the amount of cayenne & brown sugar a tad because of the large size of the shrimp I used. Also added a small splash of white balsamic vinegar to the mint sauce which was a nice addition. Everyone loved this & I'll be making it again for sure.

I made this for a July 4th BBQ and EVERYONE loved them. I followed the recipe to the letter and was so proud of the results.

This was really nice. Sweet, spicy, minty, and all-around tasty. Ran out of lemons and used lime juice in the mint sauce: delicious. We had this as a dinner for two, but there's no way this wouldn't be a huge crowd-pleaser for parties. Probably also really good with the shrimp served at room temperature if necessary. Will definitely make it again.

Shrimp were sweet...with a kick from the cayenne pepper. Mint sauce added a nice touch.

I was concerned about the taste of the mint dipping sauce after I made it. (I hadn't read the other reviewer's notes previously) I couldn't imagine the sauce making ANYTHING taste better as is, so I added a couple tablespoons of mint jelly and, voila!, the perfect dippng sauce. The shrimp were quite spicy right off the grill but, with this dipping sauce, tasted perfect. My friend, a frequent shrimp eater and chef, said these were among the best he's eaten.

I thought the shrimp were really good. The spice does sneak up on you. I marinated for longer than recommended. I did not like the mint sauce. I used two cups mint, but it ended up tasting like oil.

Rating: 4
We made this for a family BBQ almost exactly as written- the small changes we made were adding half the cayenne, as ours was really strong, and we took the shrimp off the skewers and tossed with a tiny bit of the mint sauce on platter so that people would know to use it. It was the biggest hit of the party, and the shrimp were beautiful!

I have made it many times just like the recipe says and have had many compliments. I have tried it without the sauce and it's better with the sauce. I buy frozen, raw, deviened and peeled shrimp and have great results.

Very good, spicy, sweet, the mint sauce adds a lot. Always looking for grilled shrimp recipes, usually disappointed. Not this time.

Wow, finally a shrimp recipe that doesn't taste like every other shrimp recipe. YUM!

Though not sensational, it was very, very good. The mint sauce went very well with the shrimp as others noted. I made one change because I somewhat agreed with others that the mint sauce tasted "grassy". I added a little sugar to it and it was perfect.

Rating: 3
Great flavor deceivingly simple. I served this chilled recently and enjoyed it even more. The mint sauce doesn't taste like much on its own (the reader that suggest adding a bit of honey is spot-on) but goes really well with the shrimp.

Just made these for a Halloween Party and it really went over big. I marinated peeled and deveined shrimp for about 18hrs,doubled the brown sugar and kept the cayenne at the original amount. I grilled them on a gas grill and they came out beautifully. The shrimp had a nice sweet taste and then a slow burn as the cayenne kicked in. Fabulous!

Rating: 3
Have made this recipe many times and loved it. Never had a problem with a grassy tasting sauce until the last time I made it. I used spearmint earlier and it was fine, but with regular mint (which I normally prefer) there definitely is a grassy taste. At least I now have use for the spearmint in my garden.

Everyone loved these (even shrimp eating kids)! Try it while you can still find mint. I did throw a little basil and one garlic clove into the sauce.

Rating: 3
I thought this sounded interesting enough to give it a try. Plus we have a huge stand of mint! I used the nice big shrimp you can buy at the Costco seafood counter but I didn't peel them so the sweet & spicy might not have come through as much as if I did peel them. I will try that next time. The dipping sauce turned out great although I did add some honey to counterbalance the grassiness of the mint and we couldn't stop eating it until all the shrimp were gone!

I used the frozen pre-cooked, peeled, deveined shrimp. Marinated as directed, skewered, and put them in the broiler for 3 minutes. I had no problems with the marinade sticking to the shrimp either. My guests loved them and didn't move from the platter until they were all gone. Will definitely make again!

Loved this dish! At first, I wasn't sure if I'd like the mint dipping sauce but it added just the right something to the dish!

I made this exactly like the recipe except I cooked the shrimp in a non-stick skillet without any additional oil. I served this at my annual holiday party and everyone raved. It went so quickly I didn't even get to taste the dip. I had numerous requests for the recipe and finally had to admit I got it on epicurious.

I've made this 3-4 times now, pretty much according to the recipe, and have loved the results. Tonight, I happened to have fresh scallops, and it occurred to me that they'd do well with the same treatment--and they were excellent this way. My only change was to add a clove of garlic to the mint sauce, which tastes great both with and without the garlic. A superb recipe, and easy to make,too.

The first time I made this, I tried the mint dip on its own and I gagged. But then I tried it with the shrimp...and I couldn't believe the taste. The sweet and spicy flavours mixed with the mint is fantastic. Actually all the flavours just explode in your mouth. Its my favorite shrimp recipe. My husband isn't too fussed about it but friends have raved about this and I've passed on the recipe many time. I get cravings for this.

I found the shrimp to be a bit bland; I only marinated for 3 hours, though. I really didn't like the mint sauce either, I added a clove of garlic, but it still tasted rather earthy to me.

Easy, tasty and because of the mint, not run-of-the mill!

I've had this receipt for 3 years now and knew by the ingredients that it would be great. My husband and I both loved it and made it twice in one week. The marinade is both easy and tasty. The mint sauce really cools it off and gives it an overall awesome flavor. I will definitely make this again for a crowd.

Rating: 4
Yum! This is a good simple recipe for grilling shrimp. The mint sauce is a must as the marinated shrimp alone is too bland. I tried the mint sauce as in the recipe and found I wanted a little kick, so I added some fresh garlic to the puree, as another reviewer mentioned. It was perfect! Suitable for company.

Made this as an appetizer and everyone loved it! I marinated the shrimp for about 5 hours, didn't change a thing to the recipe. Everyone loved the mint dipping sauce! We all voted this is a keeper!

I made this for guests last night and it was a big hit. I marinated shrimp and halibut chunks and cooked them on skewers on the grill. I didn't even bother with the mint sauce - no time, but everyone raved over the taste. I thought the halibut was better than the shrimp!

This is a new favorite recipe and would be great to make for a party. I followed the reviewer just before me and added garlic to the mint pesto; Wow! What a combination it was - the hot, sweetness of the shrimp with the minty, cool, spicyness of the sauce. I felt this recipe had an almost Indian influence. Highly recommended!!

Yum!!! The entire dinner conversation was about how well the spicy shrimp and cool minty pesto went together. We felt the mint sauce was missing something and a clove of garlic did the trick! We served with tri-color orzo and baby romaine. Delicious!

Truly wonderful, spoken from someone who is not a big shrimp fan; but the shrimp looked so great I bought them anyway, hoping to find a recipe for them. This is it! I used 1t. cayenne, and 1/2t. each dried chipotle and Anaheim chili powders. The shrimp are terrific on their own, but the sauce adds a new dimension that made us keep guessing if they were better plain or with the sauce. Yum!

Absolutely, hands down, my new favorite shrimp recipe!! I love the spicy marinade, the mix of the spices, smoke from grilling and sweet dip make an amazing dish.

I made these for my daughters birthday party but I let them marinate for at least 12 hours before hand and I thought they they were phenomenal! The guests couldn't get enough...just the right amount of spicy and sweet.

Served this as an appetizer and every bit of shrimp was gone. The sweet and spicy flavors complement the shrimp well. Didn't serve with the dipping sauce and it was not necessary. Very easy to make.

This recipe is amazingly easy yet tastes complexed. The mint dipping sauce complements the sweet and spicy shrimp perfectly. I gave the recipe to a caterer and all of his customers rave about it!

I made the mint sauce a day ahead, and was really nervous that it wouldn't hold up to the flavor of the shrimp. Overnight the flavor developed and the sauce was terrific. As for the grassy flavor, many times mint does need to be washed before it is used - that may be it (?).

Rating: 3
I've prepared the shrimp marinade a number of times and love it, but found the mint sauce tasted grassy every time I made it. I've reduced the amount of cayenne by half in order to capture more of the cayenne flavor than heat, but suspect I can keep reducing. It's a great ingredient but guests really have to be used to it if you use this for an entree.

I made half the recipe and served it as a first course at a three-person dinner party. I let the shrimp marinate all afternoon, and it was just great. Next time, I might substitute honey or molasses for the brown sugar.

Excellent! I served it as a main course with BASMATI RICE WITH SUGAR SNAP PEAS AND GREEN CHILES (Gourmet August 2001) -- beautiful and delicious! I thought it might be too spicy, but it was just right. I will definitely make it again.

My whole family just loved this recipe! As one other reviewer suggested I left the shells on the shrimp and just split the back and deveined them that way. I also let them marinade most of the day....very spicy but fantastic! The mint dipping sauce was excellent with the shrimp..added a nice 'coolness' to the heat! My 13 year old daughter has already requested that I make this dish again next weekend, so looks like this may become a regular around our house!

A bit better than average.. just expected it to be a little bit more exciting than it was. Easy to prepare so I would probably make it again. Good with rice and a light salad

This is a great recipe - the shrimp marinade has just the right balance of sweet and nice-and-spicy. With wonderful fresh mint in the garden right now, the dipping sauce is really superb. With pilaf and a salad, a winning after-work dinner.

Excellent marinade. I can see using it (marinade) again. I did add some veggies, pineapple and plantain to a couple of skewers. Served over rice... not too bad, but I've had better.

Our whole family enjoyed this dish, even though it was a little spicier than sweet. Next time I might reduce the cayenne slightly so the sweetness of the brown sugar was a little more prominent. Due to pouring rain we didn't venture into our herb garden for the mint, so we didn't try the sauce, which may have cut some of the spice. I served it over basmati rice cooked in lobster broth with grilled zucchini ribbons. YUM!

I make a 'house recipe' grilled shrimp at work in Jackson Hole, WY, and it is a 2-fork'er compared to this! Although a bit more time-consuming than what I'm used to, this one is going in my recipe box for future use. Having made the sauce the day before added so much more depth to the outcome than the day of.

This was the best shrimp I have ever tasted. the cayenne pepper and brown sugar was the perfect blend of flavors. We didn't even use the dipping sauce. The shrimp had all the flavor needed. We will make this on a regular basis.

My family and friends enjoyed this dish immensely, and it will become a summer standard in our household. The cayenne spice in the shrimp balanced perfectly with the brown sugar in marinate and the mint. I served the shrimp over wild rice and drizzled the mint sauce over the entire dish. It was fabulous.

This was a big hit at our house. I made it for my husband's birthday dinner. The flavors blended so well. The mint sauce was very different and we'll try it again. I also tried it with a lemon sauce. Both were good. This is a perfect entree dish and/or appetizer.

This recipe was a big hit in our family. I divided the marinade and made one portion as per the recipe and the other I minimised the pepper seasoning. The latter was for the younger members of the family. It was a definite make again, and would be especially suitable as dinner party cuisine. The mint dipping sauce complimented the dish well.
