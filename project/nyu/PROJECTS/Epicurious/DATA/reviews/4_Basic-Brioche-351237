Although this recipe is time consuming, it was well worth the wait! I used it to make a batch of maple pumpkin pecan sticky rolls [my own recipe] and they turned out beautifully.

I love this recipe. I've used it so many times. I like using the organic cultured butter from Whole Foods in this recipe. I use brioche as the base for many appetizers, toppings, coatings and bread pudding.

Made this recipe a few times, I even quadrupled it once and it's absolutely perfect. @Ethanallen - you definitely missed something, you're supposed to leave the dough at room temperature for 1 hour and then refrigerate it until the next day.

Did I miss something? I made the first step, left it out on the counter.. came back the next morning and remembered that in the past 24 hours there was a mixture that contained EGG on my counter on a 90 degree summer day. Of course I threw the whole thing out, but should a raw egg be left out of refrigeration for two days without sickening people?

Perfect. I have never made bread before and it turned out like one wonderful butter croissant.

exellent recipe, made it to use in a bread pudding and had a hard time keeping myself from eating it instead.

Excellent recipe. I tried it with the extra butter, but it was too much, so I'll just use the regular amount next time. It rose beautifully and the flavor was amazing.

My local coffee shop made a lovely chocolate brioche that I was addicted to, but they closed down several months ago. I've been looking for recipe to replicate and have tried a few. This is the best one hands down, I think it's even better than the one the coffee shop made. I add some good quality dark chocolate when forming and putting into the molds. I also coat the ball with sugar before putting into the mold and it creates a sweet crisp coating. I followed the advice to let the sponge sit for 24 hours & let the dough ripen for an additional 2 days - well worth the wait!

If you love attention to detail and are a purist at heart, you'll love making this bread. This recipe requires time to let the dough ferment and ripen, so don't plan on having bread ready in a couple of hours.
