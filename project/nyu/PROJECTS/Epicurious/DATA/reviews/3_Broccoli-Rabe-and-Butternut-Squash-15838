I basically took this recipe, omitted the water, added a clove of garlic, tossed everything in a baking dish and roasted @ 425 degrees for about 20 minutes. Seasoned to taste, and it was quick, simple, and delicious.

This is a new favorite of my family. Like another reviewer, I added more spice: 3 tablespoons sesame seeds, 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper. We ate this over rice and added soy sauce. It is delicious!

I was in the mood for a butternut squash and broccoli recipe and came across this one in my search. Unfortunately the rating wasn't as good as I had hoped, so mixed the idea of this recipe and another broccoli recipe here on Epicurious.com and it was absolutely delicious! So try the seasoning from 'Broccoli with Sesame Seeds and Dried Red Pepper' from Bon Appetit, March 2002. ENJOY!

This was disappointing. Although I love all the ingredients, it came out tasting like collard greens. Maybe vinegar or crushed red pepper would help.

This seemed like such a great idea, and I was really looking forward to it on my new diet, but it was disappointing. Maybe I should have really added tons more salt, and I can't imagine some fresh garlic wouldn't hurt either. I am eating the leftovers with butter melted into them and it is much improved.
