It usually cracks me up to read review that detail how the reviewer changed sixteen things about the recipe and then complain or rave about the recipe. That said, I used blueberries instead of blackberries and maple syrup instead of honey....and it was fan-freaking-tastic! My boyfriend called it "Maine BBQ" due to the blueberries and maple flavor. We'll be trademarking that term :) Really solid recipe and I'm sure the blackberry/honey combo is delicious too.

I believe in cooking baby back ribs "low & slow." After applying the rub, I wrapped the ribs in heavy duty foil, placed on a baking sheet and cooked them at 325 for 2 1/2 hours. I used about 1/3 of the sauce to coat the ribs meaty side up and cooked another 15 minutes at 400. This sauce is wonderful - made just as directed with fresh blackberries. I had more sauce than needed and look forward to using it as a sauce for pork tenderloin.

Second time making this, first time reviewing.. Both were a hit. Suggest to double the sauce, yet keep the ginger at the same quantity. Going thru the effort of sieving the blackberries, might as well keep some extra for another dish. Skip the idea of extra sauce for the table. As well a nice substitute for the hot pepper is 2 tsp. of Sambal.

The basic problem, which I'll avoid if I make this again in the future, is that the pureed blackberries are still too thick and pulpy to yield sufficient sauce; I can't possibly see how you'd get enough for 1 cup after a pan reduction. I might try this with a blackberry juice, or even something like a pomegranate juice, to liquify it more in the pureeing. Once you get past that problem, yeah, it's all great. The spice rub (I used country rubs like Prewitt from Chicago) was perfect.

Wonderful spin on ribs. These were fantastic. I used frozen blueberries with 1 cup of fresh blackberries.Straining was a must, but not hard. So easy, so good. Great company meal.

Made the sauce to use on country style pork ribs. Easy and incredibly good! It seems like too much ginger, but it adds a fantastic warmth. I used a fresh serrano pepper instead of pepper sauce, for a more green heat, which worked beautifully. Loads of blackberry flavor with just barely enough sweetness (surprising, considering the amount of honey). Perfect with pork; can't wait to try it with salmon.

The spice rub is really good and makes this a really easy rib recipe. The sauce is a little much to dip with, but work well brushed on.

Excellent base, but I am very happy I doubled the base keeping the ginger @1/2 cup. I believe it would be overwhelming (after smelling/tasting the first half in the blender) to use the full amount. I actually wish I'd backed off a bit more, even tho I love ginger. I had a glut of cheap blackberries so it was a no-brainer to make the big batch, considering other reviews. Mine will glaze broiled king salmon. I will serve it with additional fresh berries to keep them in the forefront.

We use frozen blackberries (have used fresh, but can't tell the difference; frozen are much cheaper and are available year-round). Straining seems to take a long time to completely separate the solids (we puree and start staining as soon as the ribs go into the oven).

If there is an overflow of inexpensive blackberries, this would be a decent way to use them up. Not outstanding but pretty tasty- we didn't puree or strain the sauce to have more texture so, if we make it again, might do the straining and add more hot pepper sauce.

I love this recipe. It is really, really unusual, but really, really good. Fresh blackberries are crucial. It's just not the same with frozen. This recipe is well worth a try if you are looking for something different.

Great recipe. Even my son who is a chef and own a Vancouver restaurant really liked it. even used leftover sauce om beef tenderloin dinner two nights later.

Sorry, but although this was an unusual bbq sauce, I thought it was a waste of fresh blackberries, which aren't cheap. The rub was great and I'll make that part again, but I'd rather have a traditional bbq sauce.

My first try at ribs couldn't have been easier or more delicious. I had fresh blackberries from a recent picking trip, and this was a great use for them. The sauce is to die for. I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. By all means, try this.

Wonderful and easy. It's not berry season and the grocery was out of frozen blackberries so I substituted frozen mixed berries. It was still fantastic. My husband loved it!

Delicious - most successful oven-baked ribs I've made. Would have been even better with high-quality baby-back ribs.

Wow! So easy and quick -- and the sauce was incredible. If you want to come across as an amazing ribs chef, make these! Basically everything can be done in a little over an hour.

This was great! I also cooked the ribs on the grill one time as well. Very good too. I had friends who also used the sauce over lamb. A nice change from plain bbq - very summery-tasting with the fresh berries!

Fabulous rib recipe! Ribs are my husbands favorite so I'm always looking for a new recipe. I made this for father's day and everyone loved it. I ran out of chili powder so added 1 tsp each of chipotle and ancho chili powders along with 4 tsp of regular (1 1/2X the rub). I used a combo of fresh and frozen blackberries and followed the recipe as written - no need for alterations!! I bought my ribs at Costco and they were so moist and meaty.

Made this recipe tonight and really enjoyed it, finally found a GREAT recipe to do ribs in the oven. Loved the sauce, used frozen berries there were just fine. I will surely make this recipe again, baby pork back ribs are the best for it.

I made this with boneless country-style ribs. The sauce (made with fresh blackberries) was very good, though I might add a bit more "hot" to make it qualify as spicy. The boneless ribs don't take as long to cook as baby backs. They were a bit tough after 50 minutes. Extra sauce was good to drizzle on top.

Just made 2nd time, w blackberries AND noting instructions to strain after pureeing, which was missed the first time. And the verdict is ... liked the raspberry better (more flavorful) and unstrained (bit more texture worked w meat). So: your choice!

Oh so good. I've had miserable failures w ribs, this was excellent. Used 16oz raspberries (on hand), not sure it cooked down enough. Accidentally put garlic into sauce, decided to use it on ribs as well. STILL very good.

Another awesome dish! The boys *loved* the spicy blackberry sauce. I didn't buy enough blackberries to double the sauce, so I added some raspberries and blueberries. But, I didn't double the ginger. I thought it'd be too much. I used one of those tubes of "fresh" ginger (the whole thing!) and the sauce still turned out great.

delicious-we found baking at 400 for 50 mins too long-dried them out too much-will play around with it and let you know how it turns out.

The sauce is delicious. I couldn't find baby back ribs so used spare ribs. I should have cooked it longer. Next time I will make sure to use baby back ribs.

I loved this recipe! Easy to make, and very yummy. I did add a bit of cumin to the rub mixture as I thought it would be a nice addition. I only basted the ribs once, but I definitely think that they could use a second basting - they needed more sauce. I have an extra bag of blackberries in my freezer to make another batch!

This dish was amazing! I had never cooked ribs before and I was so happy with the outcome of this dish. Used powdered cayenne pepper and it was hot! Other than the cayenne substitution, followed this recipe exactly and i wouldn't change a thing. This is in my and my husband's top 5! Also, this was dish was so easy to prepare with such little mess and quick cleanup. Will definetly make again.

Made this for friends visiting - and it was a hit! Couldn't find blackberries -- used frozen blueberries and it was great. We love Hoisin, so we were already biased. Used part Anjo Chili powder and part Cayenne Pepper -- was a bit spicy. Might tone it down a bit next time. But, LOVE the ease of baked ribs -- no parboiling or grilling mess, and they were still VERY tasty.

I didn't have fresh blackberries in season so I bought a frozen mix of blackberries, raspberries and blueberries. Excellent recipe! There was enough sauce left over that I used it on a pork roast later in the week. Kudos to the chefs!

I use grocery store-bought ribs for this and they still turned out moist and delicious. My brother, a bit of a ribs aficionado, stated he may never eat any other recipe again. And definitely try the Cucumber-Kiwi Salsa!

This was yummy - although I added a couple tbsp cider vinegar to the sauce to give it a little extra snap. However, and I am not sure if anyone else have this had better be prepared to brush your teeth with baking soda and soak your fingers in lemon juice, cause you look like you just dived into a blackberry bush!! So just because of that one fallback, I am only giving two forks to this dish. Tastewise, it was three forks, but I could not serve it to any guests visiting as I am sure they would be pretty embarassed after seeing thier teeth turn blue!

These are some of the best ribs I have ever had. I congratulate the creative chefs who devised this recipe. My family usually tires of meals quickly, but after devouring these, they requested the dish again for the next night and the next and that it be placed on a regular dinner schedule. Each of the slabs of ribs I purchased weighed about 2+ pounds so my 2 slabs of ribs came to 5 pounds. I made extra sauce and had lots left over which made it real easy to just defrost the sauce and make the ribs again for a weeknight meal after work.

This is easy and delicious- I had frozen mixed berries and used those. The sauce is so good!
