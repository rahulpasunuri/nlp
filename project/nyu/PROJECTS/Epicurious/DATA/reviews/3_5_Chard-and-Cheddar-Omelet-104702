yummy! i love the technique for cooking the eggs. by adding the cheese to the eggs before cooking helps to create a nice crunchy outside and the way they have you cook the omelet really makes a nice fluffy omelet. will make again and again.

This was extremely greasy. I would definitely cut down on the butter next time. Maybe use half a tablespoon to cook the greens and then just spray the pan for the omelets. With the cheese and egg there is already enough fat, and you don't need more.

Yum! I made it with cotija cheese, because that's what I had in the house and it was great.

We had some leftover swiss chard and made this for breakfast today. Very simple and tasty with some cornbread muffins, we'll definitely make it again.

I even messed up the recipe a bit and this was absolutely delicious! Next time, I will add bacon.

I make a variation of this recipe all the time--more of a fritata baked in the oven than an omelet. I just keep it in the fridge and eat it for breakfast, put it in a sandwich w/ some roasted red peppers, or serve it as an appetizer at room temperature. I have substituted aged manchego cheese and it works out great, even better than the cheddar I think because it is less greasy. Chard, eggs and cheese together is a fantastic combination.

Very tasty. I have not cooked chard much so was pleased with the results. The hot sauce made all the difference. I also made the chard filling once as a stand-alone side dish, with good results.

I give this 3 forks for ease, taste and ingredient availability. Definitely now "in rotation."

Great recipe. I made for a brunch and forgot to put in the hot sauce. It was delicious and easy to make.

This recipe was my first introduction to Swiss Chard and I was thrilled. I only like eggs when made into omelets and this filling was a more than scrumptious accompaniment to a usually bland food. Additionally, I would make these greens in this manner without the eggs anytime. I was amazed by the combination of the hot pepper sauce and the greens -- very delicious.

Wonderful. Used olive oil instead of butter, red pepper flakes instead of hot pepper sauce. Used 4 eggs and did it all at one time (vs. making two omelets). Served with salad. Really nice, simple dinner.

Made this with a combination of parmesean and feta cheese since I couldn't find the cheddar. I used the beautiful multi-colored chard from our garden, chopped the stems, threw them into the pan for a minute or two before adding the chopped leaves. It was good but I think cheddar would have been even better. This would make a nice breakfast to serve to company.

I didn't have chard so I used a package of prewashed baby spinach. Instead of hot sauce I used 2 tbsp. of chili sauce and since I like cheese I increased the cheddar a bit to nearly a cup. I thought it was delicious. Since I am a widow, I had to make it in two batches a night apart, but it still held up.
