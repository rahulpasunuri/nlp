Agree that it is like a simple paella. Flavor was very good and it was simple to prepare. Cooking time is likely ok for long grain rice, but needs to be at least doubled for brown rice. I added rice and chorizo to sauteed vegetables along with saffron and then added the broth once the rice was nicely coated. Nice side dish for grilled chicken and the left overs made for an excellent lunch.

Despite the title, this appeared to me to really be a paella recipe. Accordingly, I used pearl rice rather than long grain rice. It was fine, not particularly flavorful, though the rice was nicely cooked according to the directions in the recipe. I ended up using green Tabasco to give it flavor. I liked the concept, but would alter the recipe in some way to give the dish more taste next time.

Yummy! This dish is very similar to jambalaya. Most everyone had seconds. I sauteed the rice with the vegtables. Chicken or shrimp could be added to make this a main course instead of a side.

I served this dish as a main course, by adding an extra piece of chorizo (1/2 lb total). I sauted the chorizo with the vegetables, and added the rice once the broth started to boil. It worked perfectly.

Do you add the rice when you saute the vegetables or later with the broth?
