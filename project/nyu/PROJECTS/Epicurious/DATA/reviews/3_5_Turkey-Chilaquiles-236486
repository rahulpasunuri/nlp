I cant rate the recipe because I changed several things but it was a REALLY great starting point and a wonderful turkey leftover recipe. I made 1 ½ times the recipe using a combination of tomatillo sauce and enchilada sauce but I added about a cup of the leftover turkey gravy from Christmas Dinner. I used our favourite Aged Irish cheddar and added a can of black beans (rinsed) and 1 ½ cups of frozen corn kernels. I also used 6 inch corn tortillas cut into 6 wedges and baked in the oven at 350 degrees until just dried out. Everyone loved it. Yummy.

Absolutely the best thing that has ever happened to my Thanksgiving leftovers. This will be a regular recipe for me from now on! Delicious comfort food. The only reason I haven't given four forks is that I made a lot of substitutions, living in the UK, so I didn't make the dish as written. No way to get 3 cups purchased salsa or queso fresco here (devastating), so I used 2 cans of chopped tomatoes with 3 chopped garlic cloves, plus a bit of a nice imported American chipotle salsa, and also cheddar and creme fraiche. Was delicious. You could throw anything in and it would be great, to be honest! Can't wait to make it again.

This was very good and very simple. A great use of leftover Thanksgiving turkey and things you might already have on hand. I think black beans would add something to this dish and I'll try them the next time I make this!

I substituted ground bison for the turkey and used a homemade tomatillo salsa. This was addictive and very simple to put together. This is a new favorite in our house!

This recipe is easy and delicious. I used leftover poached chicken breast, and mixed chunky red salsa with salsa verde and canned enchilada sauce to make three cups total. I didn't have canned green chilis. My husband had thirds.

This dish has become a regular dinner for our family. Quick and easy to make and very tasty. I use either leftover chicken or turkey and I use the roasted peppers if I have them in the house. Not fancy food, but very tasty.

A friend brought this recipe and made it after Thanksgiving and it was outstanding. Can't wait to make it again on my own.

Excellent quick and easy family meal. 3 cups of salsa would make this too soupy so I reduced the salsa to 1 cup and used Tillamook Pepper Jack cheese.

Good background taste, but very salty. Definitely use unsalted chips or complement with an unsalted.

I used pulled pieces of roasted chicken because I don't really care for turkey. This was a really easy and really tasty recipe. My husband loved it.

I substituted grilled chicken breast halves (marinated in lime juice & olive oil) and thought this was a fantastic dish! Very flavorful!

Very easy and tasty recipe. I didn't put as many chips in, and I forgot to put the sour cream on at the end, but it was still great. I'll definitely be making this again. Great for serving during football games.

A great version of an old favorite, and much simpler to assemble (or at least read through) than the Rick Bayless recipe we'd been using. The canned green chiles are unnecessary, though, as the salsa and chipotle overpower them anyway. Roasted poblanos might be good. We also saute some chorizo (1/4-1/2 lb.) with the onion.

Great easy dish to use leftovers or a quick weekday dinner. My guests all raved about this one. Will definitely make again.
