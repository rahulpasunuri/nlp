A gorgeous thing to place on the table  I wish Epicurious would let us post our own photos. I made this galette for a girls'-night-out party, and people were jockeying to take the leftovers home. I would have taken them myself but my husband is allergic to wheat. For him, I made lots extra of the filling and we enjoyed it as a side dish the next couple of nights. I tripled the sage, which was just about right. I also roasted the squash at 425ºF instead of 500ºF, which I'm sure would have burned it. It's wonderful that the dough and filling can be made a day ahead, since the final assembly takes only a few minutes.

Wow the squash is outstanding. I was looking for a side dish for butternut squash so I didn't make the galette only the squash, leeks & goat cheese mixture. The only change I made was add some dried herbs from my garden. There were only three of us and we finished it all. I'm definitely going to try it the galette.

This was certainly easy and delicious. I couldn't really taste the sage in the pastry, probably because I used dried rubbed sage. I used just one leek, which seemed like plenty. And I substituted some mozzarella and feta cheeses for the goat cheese, which I didn't have on hand. By accident, I kind of over-browned some of the squash, but it just made it sweeter.

I've made this three times as a side dish in the last month! However, I don't use the pastry. You can just roast the salted/oiled squash (cubed or sliced) in a glass baking pan, and saute the leeks as directed. Once the squash is fork tender, top with leeks and goat cheese crumbles. It's fantastic! Not a scrap left over from Christmas dinner.

This was delicious. I've made other galettes but this crust was exceptional.

This galette is obscenely good!! I made it for my husband, daughter, and future son in law for football munchies. I cut it into 12 pieces and it went in a heartbeat. I used a half an onion, since I had no leeks. I will definitely make this again and make modified versions with tomatoes since the crust was unbelievable.

Delicious, and perfect for entertaining since so much can be done ahead of time. This made a substantial side for our Easter meal. Next time I will add bacon or pancetta and serve as a main course.

This is an excellent recipe, and the results were both attractive and very tasty. I prepared it as a side dish for a large dinner, to provide a vegetarian option. I made the crust and filling the day before and assembled the galette a couple of hours before baking it. Using the suggestion of another reviewer, I baked the squash (cut lengthwise in half) for about 15 minutes to make it easier to peel. The filling is very tasty and the crust is delicious. It was too good (and filling) to use as a side dish, so the next time, I would prepare it as a main course, accompanied by a salad. All of my non-vegetarian guests enjoyed it as well.

A few things seem to be off with this recipe. I bought a 3 lb squash and used only the 4 cups the recipe called for. But when I added the onions and cheese there just wasn't enough squash. I cooked and added another cup of squash, but it still wasn't enough. Also, the tempurature and time for roasting the squash were both too much. The squash would have burned if I hadn't lowered the temp and taken it out after about 15 minutes. In addition, The squash pieces are too big - I cut them up more after cooking. I imagine that there are others like me who have never cooked a galette, so it would be nice to have a picture of this one. All that said, the taste is very good.

Absolutely delicious. Easy to whip up especially since I had some pre-made pie crust on hand. Don't omit the egg wash on the crust; it gives the galette a lovely shiny golden color. I am imagining countless variations on the theme...veggie, cheese, onions, leeks, scallions, or shallots... a very versatile recipe. I took a photo of the finished product at http://www.liz- sullivan.com/2010/11/24/butternut- squash-galette

Delicous. Agreed could use a bit more sage in the crust and even in the filling. Filling could be used on it's own as a side dish without the crust. Nice as a vegetarian main with a side salad. My husband, who claims not to care for goat cheese, loved it.

This was to die for, and quite easy. I prepped the crust the night before and it's a lot of hands off time, great for a weeknight dinner. I used dried sage in the crust and about 4 oz of cheese as opposed to 6 as recommnded by a reviewer. My husband who claims not to like leeks or butternut squash devoured it, as did my 18 month old, who kept asking for more. I'll be making this again for Thanksgiving.

This was delicious! The only change I would make is to saute some sage with the filling. The crust is wonderful but we didn't taste the sage.

This was bombness! My girlfriend made it for her man (me) and it was the best thing I've ever tasted. Ok, that might be a little overboard. However, it was truly tasty and I could eat it once a month for the rest of my life and be the happiest man on earth.

This is a fabulous recipe made exactly as written. I make it for brunches all the time. It also lends itself to lots of creative experimentation with other fillings. After the first time I made it I was hooked on galettes for months.

I followed this recipe with the exception of trading onion for leeks (the store was out of leeks). I was pretty disappointed. When mixing the filling, I tried it after having added only one half of the goat cheese. The filling (with 1/2 the goat cheese) was AMAZING. I could have gobbled the whole bowl up with a spoon. So, I added the rest of the goat cheese and finished the galette. I was so excited to try it. But once all together, it really wasn't every good at all! The sage was overpowering and the goat cheese was too heavy. If I make it again, I think I will just make the filling with half the goat cheese, add some nuts, and eat it as a side dish.

I was looking for something to do with a with a sugar pumpkin, so I swapped it in for the butternut squash. This galette is easy and delicious! I will make it again soon!

Very easy and very good. For pastry I used leftover pie dough from thanksgiving and just added the sage (I used 2-3 tsp of dried sage) to the squash mixture. Also didn't have leeks so carmelized two onions and added those instead. Won rave reviews from vegetarian husband who said "this tastes like thanksgiving"

This was the hit of a several course Thanksgiving dinner. Guests commented on its flavor repeatedly. It was served with a salad on the side, and was very easy to make. I was worried the dough was overworked but it was very forgiving and came out incredibly savory and interesting. The leeks, goat cheese and squash were a warm and memorable combination. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.

I love this; I made it as main course for just my husband and me, and it was perfect - with leftovers. I plan to make it for Thanksgiving and a Christmas lunch. I just hope the squash lasts. I used Trader Joe's peeled squash, but next time I will bake a farmer's marketsquash to make it easier to peel. I used a 3 pound squash, 10 oz of goat cheese 2 T sage and 3 leeks. It worked fine in the pastry.

This was the best tart I've ever made. I have to admit that that's not really saying much, as all of the other tarts I've ever made really sucked, but this was delicious. I might even use more sage in the crust next time. The dough was delicious and very easy to work with. I would definitely recommend this recipe.

This is unbelievable! I love tarts - sweet and savory. This one may be my new favorite. My only substitution was fresh rosemary for the sage, and only because I didn't have any. I will definitely try it with the sage next time. The crust is crunchy and the vegetables are perfectly cooked. Perfect recipe.

unbelievable recipe - I thought that 2 pounds of squash was going to be too much- but it was just perfect!The sage in the crust fools the palate into thinking there's meat in the dish- great choice for a meat eater trying to cut back - also the possibilities of fillings are endless.

This is a wonderful recipe cooked as written It has just the right amount of sweetness from the leeks and butternut squash, savory from the sage, and crustiness from the pastry. It is delicious enough to serve as a elegant side dish at a chefs party, or rustic and earthy enough to serve at a peasant lunch. And, it will taste great with any wine. I shall experiment with wild mushrooms as an addition when they come into season. This is definitely going to be one of my most asked for recipes, I can tell it from just one time cooking. Don't be over concerned with the complexity, it will go must faster the second and third time it is made. And, if the dough is made up and refrigerated one day ahead you are way ahead in its preparation.

I love butternut squash and as I made this I wasn't sure it would be enough to be a main course with salad. But the dough with fresh sage was delicious and the finished dish was beautiful and excellent.

Delicious. Made exactly per the recipe. Really a nice way to serve butternut squash. The sage in the crust does add a nice touch to the overall taste. It will be a great dish for fall.
