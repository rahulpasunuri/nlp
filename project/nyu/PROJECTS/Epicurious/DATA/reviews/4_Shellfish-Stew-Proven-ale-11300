What a disappointment this recipe was!It cost a small fortune to make and I really only tasted the fennel and the tomatoes which I felt overwhelmed the dish. I followed the recipe exactly so I don't understand the rave reviews.

I have made this recipe many times for company and it's always a hit. I use store bought frozen fish stock and when feeling generous add lobster. I live in the northeast so clams are plentiful. This is one of my favorite all-time recipes...and friends ask me to make this again and again.

Made this using leftover crab stock in place of the white fish stock, dried thyme, and peeled chopped tomatoes instead of canned. Terrific. I'm an ex-chef and my wife thought this was the best thing I've ever made.

This stew was fantastic. Used frozen cod, shrimp and clams from Trader Joe's and vegetable broth (that's what I had on hand). Squeezed a lemon in, buttered some hard bread and opened a nice hearty red wine. Perfect, quick, delicious rainy night meal.

This dish is very very good. Like everyone else, we subbed mussels for the clams and used monkfish. The broth in this stew is so delicious due to the combination of saffron, orange zest and fennel. It may be the best dish that I've found on this website.

This is the dish that you make for very good friends or to impress anyone. I made it for my husband, teen son and myself and we loved it. We used shrimp, scallops, oysters and white cod. The only thing I would change is to leave out the fish and stick to shellfish. I substituted the white fish stock with vegetable broth for the sake of time

This dish was really great! We made it for our Christmas Eve Dinner, and was able to put it together after work. Well worth the while to make fish broth from scratch (it was easily done the weekend before serving). The leftovers were good served over linguine. Note that we too subbed the shrimp and scallops with mussels and the freshest white fish available at the market per previous reviewer from London.

This recipe was delicious and would be impressive to make for company. Skipped the homemade stock for time's sake and used store bought seafood stock and clam juice instead; I served it with a baguette to sop up the broth which came out fragrant and lovely. My only grievances are that the seafood alone is at least $40 and that the shrimp and clams especially don't take well to reheating in the microwave the next day.

I have made this several times and really like the combination of saffron and orange. Easy and delicious...I find myself craving it occasionally.

This was amazing; a reastaurant worthy recipe. I would make this dish again and serve it at a dinner party. The orange zest really makes the dish. Because I had a difficult time trying to get fish bones from any of the fish counters, I substituted chicken broth for the fish stock. I would recommend this to others. The broth was and much easier to procure. We also used cod and flounder instead of the shellfish for allergy reasons and it worked very well. We served it over rice and it made quite a hearty meal.

Wow - this was one of the best things I've ever cooked. Not only was it delicious, it looked impressive and was relatively simple to prepare. I used mussels instead of shrimp, and sea bass fillets instead of scallops. I served it with homemade garlic bread using a rustic Italian loaf, and a simple green salad. I am definitely going make this again.

This recipe is delicious! It's light and very flavorful. I've made it several times. Substitute whatever seafood is fresh and readily available. We've even used skinless chicken and chicken broth. Once, when fennel didn't look good in the supermarket, I used celery with ~1/4tsp of fennel seed.

I should add that I was able to sautee the veg in just a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, so you do not need to use 1/4 c of olive oil if you are trying to reduce the fat content. It was delicious and still have a rich full mouth-feel.

This dish is delicious, decadent AND healthful - that's a combination you don't find everday!! I made this for the first time over the weekend and will make it often from now on. When I visited the fishmonger they had no fishbones (!?!) for me so I used the shrimp shells along with the scraps from the celery, leek, carrot, parsnip, garlic, and herbs to make a shrimp stock. It worked so well that I may do it that way from now on. As noted I added a few more vegetables to the recipe and also I used some fresh thyme, marjoram, and tarragon from the garden. I finished the dish with chopped parsley and some addition lemon and orange zest. It seems to me that one could use any combination of seafood (apart from oily fishes) and be pleased the the result. I added monkfish and omitted the clams based on my assessment of that days catch! I've made a very similar dish with lobster and plan to use this recipe the next time I prepare it. BTW - if you don't cook a lot and this recipe seems complicated, it really is quite simple. It's worth a try!

I have prepared this recipe several times, both following the recipe to the letter as well as doing some improvisation. The first time, I believe it is well worth it to follow the recipe as it is fabulous! I have prepared it for guests as an earthy, winter meal as well as a treat for the family. It is always a huge hit. Most recently, I prepared it and turned it into a more Italian stew by keeping the basic ingredients and switching the herbs. Adding oregano, flat leaf Italian parsley and fresh basil. I used about a cup of basil chiffonade at the beginning and tossed in about 10 to 12 basil leaves just prior to serving. Additionally, I changed the seafood a bit. I used huge shrimp, 10 to 15 count, Cherrystone clams, Littleneck clams, small mussles (never, ever those huge Green Lip mussels which I find have no redemming food value whatsoever), Alaska King Crab meat and I know this seems odd, but I added 2" strips of Skate Wing. The Skate was amazing! It added a nice sweetness, it was a nice addition of something sans shells and it held it's shape and texture. I also took some large Italian Country bread and toasted it to a golden brown. I rubbed the toasts with olive oil and a clove of roasted garlic and placed the toast halfway in the bowl, so that part of it soaked in the sauce and the rest remained crunchy. The combination of textures was a nice touch and the sweetness of the roasted garlic nicely complimented the shellfish. No matter how you make this, it is truly one of those recipes which you will prepare again and again.

Bernadette from SF had a great idea (although what she describes is a rouille not a roux). Great combination

THIS WAS VERY GOOD BUT SINCE IT REMINDED ME OF "SOUPE DE POISSON" I DECIDED TO MAKE A ROUIX (PUT 4 EGGYOLKS IN PROCESSER WITH 1 LARGE GARLIC PRESSED AND AABOUT 1-2 TBL OF TOMATO PASTE. BLEND AND SLOOOOOWWWLY POUR IN OLIVE OIL WHILE RUNNING MACHINE TILL U GET A SEMI-MAYO CONSISTENCY. ADD CAYENNE TO TASTE AND SALT. SERVE WITH TOASTED BAGUETTE SLICES AND GRATED GRUYERE. GUESTS PUT THE ROUIX ON THE TOAST AND FLOAT IN SOUP THEN TOP WITH CHEESE.)I USED SALMON AND COD IN PLACE OF CRAB BUT NEXT TIME I'LL PUT IN AT THE END AND NOT STIR CUZ IT DIDN'T HOLD TOGETHER AS I WUD LIKE. I WUD ALSO SKIP THE CLAMS NEXT TIME. WHO NEEDS TO MESS WITH THOSE SHELLS. I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN BUT THE RIOUX IS A MUST!! OR AT LEAST THE GARLIC BREAD SUGGESTED BY ANOTHER REVIEWER.

Used bottled clam juice, because, even though I live 2 minutes from Gloucester, MA, it is almost impossible to find fish bones for a stock. This is a pretty pricey dish, especially if you have to use clam juice (at $1.09 a bottle for 10 ounces) and of course a nice white wine, but for a special occasion, well worth it. I added 1/2 # of white fish (haddock), used 2 cups of coarsely chopped onion and a couple of bay leaves. I rarely rate any recipe 4 forks but this to my taste clearly deserves it.

Excellent! I used the bottled clam juice, deleted the scallops because my sometimes "picky" boyfriend doesn't like them and doubled the shrimp. Very nice flavor - crunchy french bread and all you're all set...

I make this alot, it is terrific, I use mussels instead of clams (much easier to get fresh in Australia), and vary some of the other fish, but always use prawns (that might be your shrimps)and scallops. It's a great easy flexible recipe.

I can't recommend this recipe highly enough, it's one of my favorites, easy and even tastier the next day. I make it every year for Xmas Eve dinner. Not only does it make for a warm and delicious holiday supper, but also for a wonderful lunch the next day. One delicious trick I've learned is to place a slice of crispy garlic bread on the bottom of the bowl and ladel the hot stew on top. This thickens the soup just a little and adds a last minute bite of garlic to the flavoring. Absolutely marvelous when served with its accompaniments of tarragon salad, Parsleyed garlic bread and chilled white wine.

I have made this recipe twice and found it great each time. I substituted lobster meat for the crab. I made it for my daughter's b'day. She requested that it be her annual b'day dinner.
