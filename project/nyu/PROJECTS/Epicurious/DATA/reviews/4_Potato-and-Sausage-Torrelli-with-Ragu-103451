My all-time favorite epicurious recipe! When I crave a homestyle meal but want something a little different, this is my go-to recipe!

The ragu was very good, however, the filling was like a perogie. It was like being in a bad Italian restaurant in Poland. Next time I will change the filling to a ricotta/spinach mix.

This recipe was great, although we didn't follow the recipe part for making the pasta dough (we used the recipe on the label of the special pasta flour we bought). Very delicious filling and ragu. From start to finish it took us (2 people) about 2.5 hours and was worth every minute. I would definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe. I just made ravioli out of mine though. As the recipe stated there is way more pasta than the ravioli calls for but I just doubled the filling and made extra to freeze uncooked. The first time we had it with the ragu. So delicious! The second time I thawed some and sauteed in butter like a pierogies with grated nutmeg. In the end I only had a couple left so I deep fried them and put one on the top of first course salads with sauteed mushrooms and truffle oil. Wonderful presentation and so delicious. I will definately make this again.

Delicious! Fun with a pasta maker. For the last reviewer with the question about how much "one" sausage would weigh, I'd guess about 3-4 ounces. I know that when I buy a pound of some commercial brands of Italian sausage, there are five sausages in there. So I hope this helps. Best of luck!

I am dying to try my hand at making this recipe, but can someone please tell me how much "one" sausage is as far as weight goes? My grocers sell Italian sausage in casing by the pound, and I don't know how much to buy.

These are awesome! The torrelli filling is straightforward and easy. The ragu for being so quick and easy to make is wonderful. I made double the quantity and froze half. Best stuffed pasta I've ever made and enjoyed!
