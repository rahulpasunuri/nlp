Quick and easy as can be. Can be used in a myriad of ways as is or even more uses as a jumping off point (mmarinade, salsa, dipping sauce). It IS a bit oily as written. Recommend using a whole, decent sized clove of garlic too.

Terrific...I added a few San Marzano tomatoes to the blending. Nice kick, too!

Surprisingly easy, strong flavors, and impressive to guests because it's fresh. The first time I made the mistake of being impatient with the onion, you really need to let it get soft and blackened a good bit. Sometimes in summer I chop fresh tomatoes or tomatillos (or both!) and add them to the mix. Very yummy!

wow, very spicy. But you never can tell if the chiles are going to be extra spicy or not when you are buying fresh chiles. I added some lime juice to tame the heat of the chiles. LOVE the consistency, but the flavor is just so-so. I will use this as a base for my tomatillo sauce though.

Wow, what an incredible flavor and very easy! It was quite oily, though, so next time I'll reduce the oil to maybe 1/3 cup.

This was excellent and very different from other salsas I have prepared. I made it to go with the carnitas tacos with green onion rajas, as I am not a fan of sour cream. Blending the ingredients in this salsa gave a nice, smooth texture, and it had a wonderful bite. I wish I had doubled it!
