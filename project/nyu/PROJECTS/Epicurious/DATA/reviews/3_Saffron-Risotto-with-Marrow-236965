This was pretty good, although it required quite a bit of ingredient searching and intensive cooking. The instructions were easy to follow. It was incredibly fatty though, and defintiely works better as an accompaniment rather than a main dish. I had it without anything else and I would ahve preferred to have it with some meat, as is recommended. If anyone has any suggestions about better ways to cook the marrow, I'd appreciate it: I put it in a hot pan, as suggested, and it basically deep fried itself, which was not the texture I was looking for. I've roasted marrow in the bone before and gotten that beautifully gelatinous texture, which definitely did not happen in the pan -- too much fat rendered out.
