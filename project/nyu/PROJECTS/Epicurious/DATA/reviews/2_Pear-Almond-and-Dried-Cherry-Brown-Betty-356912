I agree with passionize from Atlanta. I served mush--tastey mush- -but mush, nevertheless, for New Years Day football & food gathering. Everyone liked it (topped with vanilla ice cream), or so they said. Had only one serving left. The sliced almonds reminded me of uncooked oatmeal. Loved the combination of flavors, but will probably not make it again.

I am an avid fan of Bon Appetit recipes and have used many of them over the years. This recipe appealed to me on a number of levels. I love pears, I've used marinated cherries in my brownies, the idea of toasted almonds and bread crumbs with melted butter sounded so good. So I made the dessert to cap off an amazing Christmas dinner. The recipe is easy to follow but takes a fair amount of time to assemble. And when I poured the honey-water mixture over the top I kept saying to myself, "This is going to be mush." But I had faith. Well, the flavors are outstanding, but all those bread crumbs turned to mush, just as I thought. Like pears and cherries mixed with cooked cereal. It tasted good, but I didn't want cereal for dessert. I haven't tried it again, but I wonder what would happen if you omit the honey- water mixture and let the lemon juice and pears give it moisture?
