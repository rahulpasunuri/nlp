I did not care for the texture or the lemon flavor. I think I'll stick to plain vanilla panna cotta.

Rating: 3
Made the panna cotta exactly as written, but would definitely only steep the lemon peel, instead of having the grated. I do prefer my panna cotta smooth and found the bits and pieces annoying, No other changes required. It was deliciously smooth and had the right consistancy for me. No problems with curdling, separation or unmolding. The sauce however could use some punching up. I made it mainly with fresh blackberries but had to add some blueberries as I didn't have quite enough. I also used Chambord, instead of Cassis, which I didn't have. Both were minor subsitutions. I found the sauce to be a little bland, but didn't adjust it as it needed to be judged with the lemony panna cotta. Had the sauce been better, I would've given it a higher rating.

WOW...... this was a show stopper. I made it with fresh raspberries from my garden. I substituted vodka instead and I cooked the berry mixture for 10 minutes then let it cool and put in the fridge till I was ready to serve.

I loved this one! And so has my guests! It's a lovely ending for a great dinner. Looks beautiful and teastes great! I get also fresh blackberries and soak them in the sauce to decorate. And one time I used kirsh instead of black current flovored liquor, tasted great also.

A very easy recipe! I could not find creme fraiche but I used greek yogurt 2% fat and a bit more sugar and it was perfect. My guests loved it!

After several trials, I thought the following adjustments to the recipe were more to my taste: Use one whole vanilla bean rather than 1/2. Use 1/4 cup lemon juice rather than 5 tablespoons. Use 1 7 gram packet of gelatin rather than 2 teaspoons. Finley chop the lemon zest before adding to the mixture.

Rating: 0
Following the recipe, I felt that the lemon flavor of the panna cotta was too strong, the texture was too firm, and the grated lemon peel in the final product was distracting. The next time I make the recipe I think I will reduce the lemon juice by half and the gelatin by 25%. I would also strain out the lemon peel after allowing it to infuse as another review had mentioned.

Has anyone else had problems with the lemon juice curdling the cream?

I'm making this for the third time-it's always a big hit with guests, as it gives you the false impression that it's light. I do infuse the lemon rind, and strain it out, but otherwise, I keep it all the same. We have fixed it with both raspberries and blackberries. Lovely. A "keeper".

I have cooked for a number of dinner parties and I must say that I believe this is the best desert I have prepared from this web site. The Panna cotta was tangy and the sauce a superb compliment. Prep was easy and I made the dish the night before.

this was just ok. i made the recipe as written, it looked beautiful, with the fresh blackberries and mint leaves - the panna cotta was good, not great and the sauce was not good at all. i've made better recipes for panna cotta, won't make this one again.

Rating: 4
Loved it! However, I don't agree with the cooks who suggested decreasing the amount of gelatin. I took their advice and cut the amount to 1 1/2 teaspoons and, although the panna cotta was delicious, it did not hold its shape well and fell apart after a few minutes. Next time I will use the full amount of gelatin. And, for a special punch, try using fresh blackberries in the sauce.

Rating: 3
This was good! I do agree with it being alittle too dense. If you really measure your ingredients then I would level off each tsp of gelatin, or use one heaping tsp. In exchange for gelatin, I used agar agar because I prefer a more healthful approach. I also used an entire vanilla bean, which I really liked. Thanks for this recipe I will use this again. Oh.. I didn't make the blackberry sauce, ran out of time.

Cannot wait to try out this recipe. But if I don't have vanilla beans... how much vanilla extract can I put in instead? Thanks!!

The panna cotta turned out far too dense. Maybe only one spoonful of gelatin would do the trick. The coulis is very good.

SO easy! I couldn't find frozen blackberries, so use raspberried instead. I also didn't bother to strain the seeds out. This was a massive hit with my guests--from presentation to flavor. I followed the advice below and stepped the lemon peel in the milk. My market was out of creme fraiche, so I used half sour cream and half yoghurt. Simply fantastic!

Excellent. I also infused the lemon rind, and then strained it out. It left a wonderful creamy smooth panna cotta. Very easy and impressive.

hard to control amount of lemon juice. I used lime juice with the exact portion, it turns out over stingy. And I can not taste difference brought by Creme Fraiche. Other Panna Cotta recipe are simple and have better results to me

Divine. Wonderful flavor (I used vanilla flavor, not a bean), creamy texture, fast, foolproof preparation that can be done the day before. You can make the sauce out of any fruit in season. A dinner party favorite at my house that always pleases.

Light, flavorful, beautiful and easy. I used blackberry brandy in the sauce and simply simmered it, then strained out the seeds. Served with an almond tuile for texture contrast. Also, mine set up in only 3 hours. I highly recommend this!

This was a fabulous, light dessert to serve on a warm summer evening. We thought the sauce and fresh berries nicely complimented the lemony taste of the panna cotta. Creme fraiche is impossible to purchase here, so on the advice of my sister (a chef) I substituted 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup cultured sour cream the creme fraiche and it turned out great! Had some fresh raspberries and tossed those on with the blackberries - divine!

great make-ahead dessert. "light" dessert was a great end to my company's meal. Great presentation -- added some mint leaves to top of panna cotta. received many compliments. Will make again.

Rating: 4
The absolute best dessert there is. This was very easy to prepare and the presentation is fabulous. Like other reviewers I too steeped the lemon peel and removed it to maintain a smooth texture. As I happened to have frozen blackberries on hand, I simply thawed them and served on top of the panna cotta - no need to add sugar or liqueur, as this would overpower the delicate flavour of the berries and the whole dessert.

Rating: 4
A hit at my dinner club. I agree with the other reviewer who said that the blackberry sauce overpowers the delicate and wonderful vanilla-lemon flavor of the custard, but as with her party, my friends loved it. I followed the other reviews by steeping the lemon zest and straining it out. There was definitely enough lemon flavor and a nice smooth consistency. I used Trader Joe's frozen mixed berries for the sauce and Chambord liqueur in place of Creme de Cassis. Meravigliosa!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I've made several other panna cottas before, and this one was a bit on the heavy side. It just felt more dense, which is not a bad thing. Very tasty; guests were raving all night. The blackberry sauce is a must! Plated as the picture shows, with a single blackberry on top--looked very impressive. I thought the lemon juice might be a little much, but it turned out perfectly. Steeped the peel along with the vanilla bean and strained it. Yum!

What a wonderful dessert. I was looking for something elegent, yet light, and this was perfect. I took the suggestion of the cook from North Michigan to use 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 plain yogurt to replace the creme fraiche and it worked like a charm. I also followed the advice of those who steeped the lemon peel with the vanilla bean and strained it all out. All the lemony flavour was retained while the panna cotta itself remained perfectly smooth. This is something you'd find in an upscale restaurant and I was absolutely delighted with it.

What a fabulous and easy dish; Splenda substitution for sugar; and 1/2 sour cream + 1/2 plain yogurt ( no creme fraiche, no time for the recommended substitution)in no way adversely affected the dish. Raves from dieting husband and picky 5 year old eater! Try some raspberries in lieu of all balckberries! Yummy!

Fabulous, easy, beautiful dessert. Served for a birthday party and everyone loved it! Thanks to the cook who suggested adding the lemon zest to the mixture in the beginning...it was creamy and not grainy at all. This will become a favorite for dinner parties. Thanks Epicurious for another winner!

Fantastic. I've made these as part of a New Year's Eve progressive dinner dessert buffet menu twice and they were a big hit both times. Serve them in elegent little wine glasses for faster presentation (can cut back on the gelatin slightly for a less firm texture in this type of application). The first time I made a raspberry sauce and it was great, but this year I made the balckberry sauce and it was even better. Frozen blackberries hold their shape and add a lovely look and texture (as in the picture)

Rating: 3
Loved this, really loved how I could make it the night before, followed the previous reviewers advice and just steeped the lemon zest with the vanilla bean. However, I did find that a thin layer of gelatin ended up at the bottom of each ramekin, and mine tasted like there were air bubbles in it. Is that right? I expected something a bit more dense, and where did I go wrong with the gelatin?

Rating: 0
Several reviewers omitted the lemon zest. I, too, prefer my panna cotta to be creamy, not gritty. But if you want it to be lemony, you can steep the lemon zest in the cream along with the vanilla bean. After you mix everything together, put the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer, squeezing every last bit of liquid from the lemon zest. An alternative to the blackberry sauce would be whole blackberries and diced mango, tossed with a bit of lemon juice, some orange liqueur (I used Grand Marnier), a touch of honey, and just a hint of vanilla extract. Just sprinkle the fruits around the panna cotta.

Easy and delicious. I thought the blackberry sauce a overwhelmed the delicate panna cotta, but everybody else loved it and wanted the recipe. I bet it'd be good with blueberry sauce too.

Made this based on reviews and it was fantastic! Left out lemon zest as per other reviewer. Had no cassis so used framboise and the sauce was absolutely great. Didn't know it beforehand but one of the dinner guests orders panna cotta whenever it is available and she said this was the best she had ever had.. a real keeper of a recipe and very easy.

I know this recipe tells you how to make creme fraiche, but I'd also like to know where to buy it, if possible. I don't even know what is is, actually. But anyway, it's not in my local supermarket so is there a specialty store, mail-order perhaps, that someone can share with me please?

this was FABULOUS! the lemon panna cotta was simple and delicious! i did deviate from the sauce - it's june and it's fresh blackberry season so i took 3 cups fresh blackberries and macerated them in about 1/3-1/2 cup sugar for about an hour or so. then i put them in a blender with the 3 tablespoons of cassis, strained and chilled. it was WONDERFUL. this is truly easy to prepare and got rave reviews!

This was a delicious and easy dessert. I didn't use the lemon rind as I don't like the change in texture it creates. The lemon juice didn't curdle the cream when I made it. The creme fraiche really adds something as does the little vanilla bean.

This is delicious AND beautiful! I did not have any curdling problems with the lemon/gelatin mixture and the cream. I made my own creme fraiche and the blackberry sauce was delicious! I substituted Splenda for the sugar in both the panna cotta and the sauce to cut the carbs and this dessert tasted sweet and light! Just right for summer and an impressive way to end a meal. Thanks again, Epicurious!

I've made this 3 times now as written and it has never curdled. Delish every time. One thought: It will curdle if you heat the gelatine mixture on too high a heat or for too long, so be careful with that step.

This is wonderful, my family loved the panna cotta. It took a couple of days to make the creme fraiche, I did not simmer a vanilla bean in the milk mixture, instead I used a teaspoon of vanilla bean paste, and added it to the milk and cream. I had no problems with curdling

I haven't tried this yet, but I just wanted feedback from others about the cream curdling-- it makes sense that it would, but is there a way to prevent it? Thanks for your help.

While it's true that yes, this IS an easy recipe & yes, it IS delicious, WHY didn't anyone bother to mention that the lemon juice will CURDLE THE CREAM? I'll make this in the future, but without the lemon juice or the rind, which only adds to its odd texture. I like my panna cotta creamy & smooth. In addition, I used Slenda to make this low carb, as another reader did. If you're eating low carb, this is a good choice (w/o the sugary sauce of course).

This was outstanding! The panna cotta was delicious and the lemon added a refreshing zip. The blackberry sauce was easy and flavorful. I also scattered fresh raspberries around the plate for additional color and taste. No trouble at all unmolding after placing in warm water for 45 seconds as recipe says. My guests raved!

V.similar to a recipe I already use. For perfect unmoulding every time, try to find plastic moulds with covers top AND bottom. Remove top lid, invert, remove bottom lid and hey presto !!

Helped a friend who was hosting her annual easter brunch in NYC with this recipe for dessert. Fabulous and intensely delicious don't even begin to describe it. Best part? The ingredients and the preparation are extremely easy to acquire and not very time-consuming and the result is a beautiful dish that looks like you slaved for days over it. Great bet for impressing your guests and good for those who want something a bit different and sweet.

Definitely a dessert to impress! I used the recommendation to line each ramekin with a piece of saran and lightly oil them (used veggie oil and applied with paper towel, did not use spray). Since I was running behind time, (opps, forgot the lemon rind, didn't matter though) i placed the ramekins inside a bath of icewater in the freezer. Releasing the panna cottas was painless, inverted ramekin and peeled of the wrap without a hitch. Spooned the sauce around the plate (rather then in a pool) and served. The company loved it!

This was an excellent recipe. I tripled the recipe and had no problem. I used fresh blackberries and fresh mint as a garnish with the sauce. It made a beautiful presentation. The panna cotta got rave reviews.

This was a really simple and tasty recipe. I Didn't have vanilla beans so I skipped the first step with steeping and just added some vanilla extract to the cream/milk mixture. For the sauce I used mixed berries and cassis liquer rather than creme de cassis. The sauce was delicious and the panna cotta had a great, subtle lemon flavor. I don't think I oiled the custard cups quite enough because the desserts were stuck in the mold but a little loosening with a knife got them out, presentably entact. I'll definitely be making this again.

Amazing! I served this to a savy international crowd and I was complemented as serving the best dessert they ever tasted! The blackberry sauce was equisite!! It presented beautifully and was not difficult to prepare.
