This is a regular in our home. The flavors and tenderness of the lamb almost brings tears to my husband eyes and my son LOVES the beans (that alone should say something!) I did make one small adjustment in my last batch which added a nice dimension that I thought I would share. When adding the tomato paste, I also added on one medium sized, quality salt-cured Greek anchovy (Italian would also do). It gave a very subtle tang to the base that added even further depth to flavors of the dish. Don't be scared off by anchovies, the dish does not at all come out tasting the least bit like them.

I've made this 6-7x over the years for guests and it is universally a hit. Even people who "don't like lamb" love this dish. Do not skip the gremolata - it takes 2 minutes to make and really puts the entire dish over the top.

This recipe never fails. Do not leave off the gremolata - it makes the beans! This also makes way more sauce than could ever be used on 4 shanks. The sauce however then makes a fantastic base for soup when mixed with a bit of stock. Don't forget to get a small fork or even a straw to get the marrow out of the shanks. This can also be done in a pressure cooker (use less stock and wine) to speed things up with still delicious results.

I have made this recipe several times and it will continue to be my go to delicious, food for the soul and my loved ones meal. I often braise the lamb and and put it in the wine/ broth /veggies the day before and then cook it in a dutch oven in the oven the day I am serving it. You can leave the dutch oven in the oven at 200 for as long as you want- I believe it just makes the shanks that much more delectable! I also use the remaining sauce for soup . I usually make extra lamb shanks for lamb and barley soup! Enjoy

Omg!! This was wonderful! But definitely make it one day in advance so it's easy to remove the fat. I think it lets the favors meld, too. Oh, my. It smells wonderful cooking, both the first time and as leftovers.

I have to admit I have only made the beans and gremolata, but what wonderful recipe - even my teenage son requests them. I make them exactly as written - wouldn't change a thing. I usually serve these with a pork roast, since good lamb shanks are so hard to find.

This was delicious. I was looking for a lamb recipe that didn' t use rosemary since I was looking for a different flavor profile. The gremolata is a must. Husband and sons were uncertain about the beans but they were a huge hit. Will use leftover sauce for grilled lamb chops.

My family loves lamb shanks and this recipe was a hit. Up until now I have been using a recipe from Michael Lomonaco which is also outstanding, but without white beans. I cooked the lamb shanks in a clay oven. Will definitely make this again.

Thought this was a delicious and impressive dish! Besides the chopping, it's really pretty easy. Great company dish.I served it to a lamb snob and he LOVED it! The only changes I made were that I added some morels to the sauce, and I cooked the beans(dried) in the crockpot that morning to save time after work.I will save the leftover sauce for the base of a ragout and turn the leftover beans into white bean soup with kale(since I cooked a whole bag).I served it with sauteed spinach to counteract some of the richness.Wonderful recipe!

I used this recipe to cook a lamb neck roast in my crock pot. It was so good that I broke my rule of "no second helpings" and my husband had a third helping. Because I was using my crock pot I didn't seer the meat before I started cooking it but that didn't seem to have any detrimental effect on the outcome.

Rating: 4
Fairly simple preparation, with excellent, tasty results. Much preferred this recipe to another with coriander, fennel and star anise on this site. Should be made the day before, so you can skim off the fat from the sauce. I did use less chicken broth and didn't need to reduce it down. I cooked it in the oven, but I'm sure either way works. The beans seemed lackluster until I added the gremolata. It really makes the beans. I also used two cans of beans with the same quantity of other ingredients and it worked beautifully. These also benefit from advance preparation as the flavors will sink in more.

Rating: 4
We tried several other recipes for lamb shanks, but this is stellar! We did follow some of the other reviewer suggestions and braised the lamb in the oven in a LaCreuset dutch oven early in the day so we could defat the sauce after it cooled. We used an excellent Italian Barbera and pureed the vegetables with the sauce. We served the shanks with the gremolata, Tuscan Beans (on Epicurious), spinach and the rest of the wine. Fantastic!!

Rating: 3
Very nice lamb shank treatment, the gremolata adds such a spark, quite a welcome contrast with the unctuous lamb and beans. We have a meyer lemon tree and I chopped julienne strips of meyer peel rather than grating. My husband went crazy for the beans. I forgot the tarragon at the end but the gremolata has such a lively flavor it wasn't missed. The sauce reduced nicely, was velvety smooth even without the added butter. I'll make this often I'm sure.

We just made this recipe and it was wonderful. The one change we made from the original was that we braised the lamb in the oven in a roaster since we don't have a casserole. This seemed to work out just fine. Some other reviewers complained that the sauce was greasy. We noticed that the braising liquid seemed fatty after it was strained. We easily solved this by using a gravy fat separator on the braising liquid. This resulted in a well balanced sauce. The flavours were wonderful. Next time we will double the amount of beans since there didn't seem to be enough of this side for the amount of meat in the recipe. We used young organic lamb that had been freshly butchered and the flavour was mild and savoury. There was none of the gamey flavours that some reviewers mentioned.

I prepped everything beforehand and put the shanks in 2 1/2 hours before the guests arrived. I always quadruple the beans and add parisien herbs to them. My guests raved! This is a great dish for company, people who say they don't like lamb haven't tried it this way. I added 2 extra shanks and sent one of my guests home with his lunch for the next day. He said it was even better than the night before. I highly recommend this dish, it's a little time consuming but worth it. I even make the recipe for the beans to serve with other dishes. Seared scallops with the beans are divine. Just add some fresh herbs to the presentation, otherwise it's a little to "white". Yum!

This was really good and is definitely a keeper. I too thought there was a lot of liquid and might reduce the amount proportionately, next time. Like one of the other reviewers, I finished cooking the dish in the oven. The beans were greatI used one can of white beans and one of lima beans, both drained and rinsed. I also substituted fresh rosemary for the tarragon. Wonderful!

Rating: 3
I prepared the lamb slightly different (did them in the oven instead of stove top) and they turned out good. Just watch the shanks and wait for them to pull from the bone a bit. Meat should be tender, but not completely fall apart. Careful not to overcook the beans. I added some kale to the beans and it was great. Good recipe.

Rating: 4
I made this for a Valentines Day Dinner last Feb and it was fantastic. You definitely have to make sure you trim the lamb so it doesn't end up too oily. I used a chicken demiglace instead of stock for extra richness and served the lamb and beans with some spinach sauteed with only lemon for some brighter flavor. Everyone cleaned their plate.

Made it for my mom, she loved it! Lamb is a dish I love to make for guests because most people don't enjoy it often and it is so easy to make. I did cut the liquid in half and there was plenty to go around. Make sure you use a good quality lamb. For those people that thought this recipe was soooo much work, seriously think about taking a knife skills class and buy a good knife - it really makes a big difference in cutting down prep time.

Rating: 3
As usual, the reviews by the readers are always so helpful! This was delicious! But do skim off the fat. Even though I trimmed the (already) lean shanks, it produces a lot of grease. I also used the crockpot (high 2 hours, low 4 hours), then removed the shanks, strained the sauce, chilled it, and removed the fat. Then I reheated the shanks in the sauce with about 12 oz of quartered cremini mushrooms. The meat fell off the bones, so I took them out and served the meat and mushrooms atop the beans, with the remaining sauce on the side. The beans were WONDERFUL - so creamy and easy to make. I will make those again with other dishes! Do try this!

I'm rating the bean recipe, it's fabulous! Make the gremolata, it's easy, and very tasty. I served the beans with loin lamb chops, and it was delicious. I made the braised lamb shank with carmelised onions and shallots recipe recently, and they were v. good!

My mother and I made this recipe for a holiday dinner and it won rave reviews all around. My brother, who does not usually rhapsodize about food, described the shanks as "silky" and went on about them for days. The beans are fantastic - I plan to make them just to eat on their own (maybe with some bacon thrown in). Do not, under any circumstances, omit the gremoltata - it is magical. Great recipe!

I made this dish for Christmas dinner and it was great - total comfort food for a rainy night. This dish does require significant time to prepare and it's definitely not an easy dish to make. However it's a tasty dish and the sauce is excellent.

This is an excellent recipe. However, any excellent recipe can be ruined by poor quality ingredients. Lamb can sometimes have a terrible gamey flavor which cannot be masked by the flavorings here. If your lamb has a strong, unpleasant smell then it will taste bad as well.

This is a lot of work but well worth it. I've made this recipe several times (only for special occasions) and it is high end restaurant worthy. Have made it with dried beans but now make it with canned drained beans - excellent and it cuts out one step. Not difficult but time consuming recipe but soooo good.

I made this as written, and was not too impressed by the lamb. The kitchen smelled wonderful, but there was way too much sauce left at the end, even after reducing, and it was too greasy. Maybe it would be improved by leaving overnight and skimming off some fat. I usually adore lamb, but the meat didn't have much flavor in the end. The beans, on the other hand, were wonderful. I'll definitely be making those again. The hint of lemon from the gremolata mixed in with the beans was perfect.

I'll make this again with several changes. I like the vegetables coarsly chopped and the sauce more of a gravy. I thickend it a bit with beurre manie and used Herbs de Provance as the seasoning. I also prefer using a white wine (dry vermouth) to the red (but do thank tdleigh for her wine suggestion - it was good) as I think the lamb flavor is more pronounced. I love white beans but thought their flavor is also masked by cooking with chicken broth. I'll use water next time. I doubled the recipe for my family and hardly had a bit left over.

This recipe STINKS. Literally and figuratively. I spent so much time making this dish, and was so excited to make it with my brand new Le Creuset. I followed it to the word except for the beans (they're not my husband's favorite), and was so disappointed with the outcome. Make this recipe if you want your kitchen to smell like sheep for a week.

Rating: 3
A big hit! I made it the day before, refrigerated the broth and shanks separately, degreased the refrigerated broth and pureed the remaining liquid with the vegetables. It gave the too liquid broth a nice thickish texture, perfect to coat the shanks. Good idea to double the amount of beans too. And don't skip the gremolata, it gives the dish its zing.

I only made the beans from this recipe and they were very good, particularly with the gremolata which was new to me. I'll be making that more often. I served some marinated lamb chops with it.

Wonderful recipe; As in previous reviews said there was too much liquid, I cut the wine to 1 1/2 cups and the chicken broth to 2 cups (the lamb portion of the recipe only); added about half a small can of tomato paste instead of the one tablespoon. Sauce thickened up like gravy and it was mmm mmmm good, enough for 4 fairly generous helpings of sauce. Served it with buttery mashed redskin potatoes and sauteed green beans, and skipped the white beans and gremolata. I'll probably try them next time. Oh, and I skimmed the sauce a couple of times, as it did get a bit greasy. Very yummy.

I have made this numerous times, always to rave reviews, I use shanks when I can get them and chops when I can't. The gremolata is a must in my opinion. it adds a brightness of flavor.

I was wary of the amount of gremolata so added only 1/3 of the recommended amount to the beans. That was all it needed, in my opinion. I added none to the lamb. I agree that there is a lot of braising liquid. I thickened only a bit of it at the end. An excellent recipe. I used a very good quality Bordeaux...that may have helped a lot. Definitely to make again.

This one goes down on my top 10 list! Served Lamb in a lunch pasta bowl with beans surrounding it--truely stunning. This was THE best meal I've eaten in Harrisburg, PA. Bless you Epicurious! P.S.

Reading everyone else's comments, I followed some of your suggestions and added some, and it was wonderful. I used 2 cups Merlot, 1 can beef broth (plenty of liquid) and cooked the whole thing in the oven. You have to turn the shanks often, but it makes such a nice finish on them. I had no lemon, so threw in some dried lemongrass, and it worked. I thought the whole thing, including the beans, was quite good and very easy. And I didn't do the gremolata (had no parsley or lemon and I'd used all my garlic with the shanks).

Rating: 3
The flavors of the lamb and the beans were great. I used beef stock instead of chicken broth. There was way too much sauce in the end. I'd recommend cutting the liquids for the braising in half. I don't recommend using the lemon zest, garlic, parsley mixture--it added a crunchy texture to a very smooth dish.

Those are my husband's ratings. I did most of the work, and I'd give it 2 forks and no, I would not make it again. It's a ton of work with an unwieldy cut for a small amount of meat in the end. And beware, it's terribly fatty. I doubled the recipe and made it the night before and then stored the sauce in a tupperware. I kid you not, the next day I skimmed off a layer of hard congealed fat 1/3 inch thick. I was very happy not to be putting that in my body. I should note, my guests had no objections - I think they really liked this.

Rating: 4
What a wonderful dish. I made a couple of changes. First I used twice as many beans. Next time I may even use more. They cook down a lot. The lamb shanks I totally trimmed of all fat first then tied the meat like a small bundle so it wouldn't fall apart in the cooking process. This also reduces the amount of grease tremendously. I also like to have the meat provide flavor to the beans, so I prepared the beans as stated then for the last hour of cooking I added the shanks to a roasting pan with the beans and roasted in a 350 degree oven for the last hour. Turning frquently to keep the meat moist. Liquid reduces and the finish was exquisit.

After reading the reviews, maybe I was expecting too much! This was OK, but not worth repeating. I thought the "sauce" was way too greasy (my daughter disagrees), and the lamb was good, but not outstanding. It was easy enough (chopped with the processor), but not worth using up that much good wine. I'll keep looking for a good lamb shank recipe. (The beans were good-I may repeat them)

I'm not a meat eater - but wanted to cook something special for someone that is. Not ever have made anything meat related other a hamburgers - this proved to be easy - simple to follow insructions - and quite wonderful. And - it stood the reheating test. The beans were in my opinion the best part. This recipe has truly made me an epicurious loyalist. I looked to the reviews for input.

This is a good dish if you like very tender meat, and the beans are delicious. However, the lamb was much greasier than I expected. I happened to make it a day ahead, so I was able to refrigerate it and skim the fat. Otherwise the sauce would have been very greasy. Also, I agree that the flavor of the lamb is not as strong as the wine broth.

This was really good and hearty. Good for the winter months (even though I made it in the summer). I seared the shanks on the stove and finished in the oven, and they were tender and falling off the bone. I made it in advance and both the beans and lamb reheated perfectly (probably even tasted better than if we'd eaten it right away) but by the time we ate it, I no longer felt like making the gremolata and it was still delicious. I'll probably make the gremolata next time to see if it really adds something extra. Even with all the chopping, a very easy, delicous dinner.

Rating: 4
Fabulously delicious meal with a lovely presentation! Canned beans worked greatly, creating a creamy but textured base for the lamb. The gremolata addition really topped off the fresh flavors. The only modification I made was to place the shanks (after browning) and vegetables (after sauteing in the lamb skillet) into a heavy covered casserole to bake in the oven at 300 for 2 1/2 hours. It simplified the recipe for me, although I still did the beans on the stove. Next time I would follow previous suggestions and maybe thicken the broth and/or save the excess broth for a subsequent risotto. Luscious dinner!

I unfortunately made the lamb shanks with fennel on this site (DO NOT make that!) with these white beans. These beans were fabulous, made with overnight soaked dried french white navy beans. Full of flavor and the beans kept their structural integrity. Yum. Next time i'll try this lamb as it sounds better than the other one.

Rating: 4
I've made this twice and it was fabulous both times. Wonderful comfort food. My butcher sells boneless lamb shanks as 3-4 lb roasts, so I braise and cook the entire roast. The meat stays juicy and literally falls apart when done. I've used dried (but PRECOOKED, not just soaked!) beans as well as canned. Dried is better but the canned beans were not bad, possible even creamier.

Rating: 4
I highly recommend this recipe if you like lamb. Be sure to follow directions exactly...it really needs nothing to improve it. The lamb,white beans,wine sauce and gremolata are simply such an elegant entree your guests will rave and rave. I removed the lamb from the shanks and placed it ontop the white beans to facilitate eating it. Try this for sure!!!

Rating: 3
Absolutely yummy. I made ahead for a trip to a log cottage where I wanted something impressive but that could be warmed up on the site. The fresh gremolata really takes away from any feeling that you are eating "leftovers". I cut down on the proporations because I was just making two servings. I thickened the sauce with a little bit of cornstarch but only after reducing it considerably. Fresh thyme was really worth it. The beans were a lovely accompaniment. I used canned navy beans.

Rating: 3
Why go through the trouble of cooking the lamb and beans separately? Add a smoked ham hock and garlic sausage, adjust the tomatoes/wine and make a cassoulet--skip the duck which is always a bother. Make sure you have enough leftover beans for another winter comfort, pasta fagoli

I have made this twice now (once by special request from my husband after the first time). He was so grateful that I followed the receipe as I was able to 'duplicate' it the second time!! The sauce is so flavorful and complex - a real treat. This really presents well also. The next time I am going to cook my beans from scratch and see what the difference is (I used canned both times). I served this with some really hearty country Italian bread and salad. Very filling. The next day, I used the leftover beans as a topping for bruschetta with the addition of some garden tomatoes - delicious!!!

This was way too much work for a so-so recipe. Meat is tender, but loses the wonderful lamb flavor with cooking. Beans were good, would make them again, probably with canned this time.

THE BEST! do make it the lamb the day before and skim most of the fat off the top -- easy when straight out of fridge. Consider adding a bit of corn starch to the broth to thicken it a bit. The beans and gremolata are wonderful with our without the shanks. This is a bit of work in the prep but well worth it. Trust me.

I have made this several times. Always a hit. I usually add a little rosemary & thyme, as I have those accessible in my garden. Last time I made it, I left two shanks in the fridge over the weekend. After two days, the flavors were EVEN BETTER!! There was a lot of sauce left over, so I used it as a stock for cooking risotto. My boyfriend says it's one more thing he can't order at a restaurant, cause Tom Valenti's (now mine) is better!!

I'm a good cook, but this was the first time I could proclaim a dish of my own "restaurant quality." Canned beans worked fine; I just used less broth. And I suspected the gremolata would be overkill (there is already a rich complexity of flavors without it), so I simply made a bed of the beans on the plate, topped the beans with a shank, and liberally sprinkled parsley overall. My guests pronounced it AWESOME!

My husband and I prepared this dish for our wine-tasting group this weekend, and it was a big success. We substituted boned leg of lamb, cut into large cubes, to make the dish easier to manage for eight people. My husband did all the vegetable prep the day before, which made the actual cooking a breeze. I served it on a large oval platter with the beans around the edge and mounding the meat in the center. Dramatic! A French Margaux wine held up to the strong flavors. The beans are fabulous, creamy and garlicky, and I'll make them on their own.

It's an excellent braise for the first-time braiser of moderate kitchen ability (me). Absolutely delicious and not terribly complex to make - plenty of time to prep while it's braising. Great texture, too. Didn't do the butter sauce thing. Used only 3 shanks due to size of pot. White beans with mirepoix were an attractive base for presentation.

Rating: 3
Have done this twice...once for ten and a second time for twenty-five. Both times it was a big hit. A great meal to cook ahead for a large number of people and be able to enjoy your own party. The beans help make this possible since, unlike a rissoto, they can be done ahead. Did thicken the braising liquid a bit with arrowroot, but that was a personal choice. Good meal to serve in chafing dishes.

Rating: 4
This is worth the effort. It is AWESOME !!!!!! I made this for a dinner party on Saturday night. Served with couscous and carrots steamed in brut champagne. The sauce is great as well. I doubled the recipe and had some extra lamb. I used the extra lamb in the lamb and spinach salad recipe available on this site. I never ate lamb as a child (something about the untimely demise of a family pet during my Mom's childhood), so I try new recipes every chance that I get. Still cannot get my Mom to eat lamb, but that means more leftovers for everyone else.

Made this last night and it was GREAT! Don't change anything the first time you make this. Could save a little preparation time by prepping all of the carrots,onion,celery, and garlic at one time and then using one third for the meat and the rest for the beans.

This is a terrific recipe if you are looking for a restaurant quality, no short cut recipe. A few tips. Have the butcher use the band saw to cut through the shank just above the meaty part of the shank. This will allow an easier fit in the pot and allow the marrow to melt into the sauce. It doesn't mess up the presentation either--fits on a plate better. Also, be sure to reduce the sauce well, its so much better once it develops a thickness to it. The beans are the best recipe I've seen--try it with dried beans cooked about 1 1/2 hours while the meat is braising. Don't bother to soak overnight. Can't wait to try this with ossobuco.

Rating: 4
This is one of our favorite recipes. It consists of simple, homey ingredients, yet it comes out complex and impressive. One of the rare dishes that is of restaurant quality. My husband requests this one for special occasions. It really does make a difference, however, to use dry beans (and take care that the shanks are hot enough).

Rating: 4
The beans were extraordinary, though I agree that dried beans would hold up better than the canned ones I used. I made this recipe in advance and the time spent marinating in the sauce only improved it. Before reducing the sauce, I removed the shanks from the sauce and re-heated them in the oven and ran them under the broiler to brown. Superb!
