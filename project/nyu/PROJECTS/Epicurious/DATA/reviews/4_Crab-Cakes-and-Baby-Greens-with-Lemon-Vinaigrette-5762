Vinaigrette needed a bit more lemon juice; seemed too oily. Crab cakes were good. However, we are used to more seasonings so will probably seek out a different recipe next time although these were good. Also, as we had it for a main course, I wouldn't put the cakes on the greens. Overall, we enjoyed but would do differently next time.

I have not made this in awhile, but I recently ate mediocre crab cakes at a couple of very fine restaurants while travelling in Vancouver and San Francisco, which prompted me to search for this recipe. I can honestly say that this is a great way to make crab cakes. A simple mix of crab with a few seasonings, combined with the lovely lemon vinaigrette-dressed greens - you just cannot go wrong.

This is the perfect crab cake recipe! So many recipes call for unnecessary ingredients. "Fillers" only ruin the delicate taste of the crab. The viaigrette is lovely as well!

Excellent! I doubled the ingredients and made 10 large crab cakes which served 10 people. Used gluten free breadcrumbs, blue crab (mix of lump ad jumbo lump) and they turned out great. Served with rice, the lemon vinaigrette/greens and cucumber salad. Will definitely make again.

Delicious, easy, and impressive! My whole family loved these. I will definitely be making them again. Only pointer is that I used a measuring spoon to make sure I got 20 cakes (we had 10 for dinner) and they were too big. I ran out of crab, so had to go back and make them smaller. Still only got 18 small cakes. Next time I will double it because they were gone in a flash!

I agree, the salad with vinaigrette is great with this! I halved the recipe, which was perfect for four nice cakes (and saved a few dollars, too!) I made the Creamy Lemon Rice from this site, and prosecco was perfect with the meal.

This is a simple yet fabulous tasting recipe. I cut the amount of bread crumbs; the cakes came out great. The Dijon, Hot Pepper sauce, worchershire & fresh chives really flavor up the cakes. I served without the greens or sauce and will add them in next time.

I made these for a dinner party and received rave reviews! Guests commented about how good the crab was and how there wasn't a lot of filler. To ease in preparation, after mixing all the ingredients together, I used a mini-muffin pan to divide out the meat mixture before rolling in breadcrumbs. I could easily gauge the size of each one and they all turned out identical in size! Also helped me plan to have the exact number I needed! Served with a creamy roasted tomato sauce along side the baby greens and lemon viaigrette. Delish!

I have made these several times and will make them over and over again - every time. Easy to make and they get rave reviews every time I make them. I don't always serve the vinaigerette - sometimes a roasted red pepper roumelade from Whole Foods.

These are lovely - the crab flavor and texture are perfect. Used panko, Old Bay and sea salt as suggested. I have made the lemon vinaigrette and greens - they were good - but we found that the flavors were too distracting. If you're going to splurge on good crab, don't you want that to be the star of the plate? Used Emeril's remoulade which we much preferred. Enjoy!

Yum! I just made these tonight with Dungeness crab (when I lived on the East Coast I used Snow Crab). A 1.8 lb crab yielded about 8 oz of meat. Perfect for 1/2 recipe and dinner for two. Hubby loves em. As everyone has said already you should use panko crumbs. I'd never heard of them until I saw the reviews of this recipe. Now I use them in all my breaded/fried recipes. The lemon vinaigrette is really good too.

Really good. I made 4 big ones for a main course and used light mayo and olive oil to lighten it up a bit. still very rich and delicious, and the vinaigrette cuts the richness of the crabcake perfectly,

This recipe was great - my first time making crab cakes, which for some reason, always seemed difficult and intimidating. There is very little filler here - very tasty. I served these as entrees with the greens and vinaigrette - they made 4 large cakes. Next time I may increase the amount of mustard and/or hot sauce but otherwise wouldn't change a thing (I used panko, as suggested by previous reviewers - thanks for that tip!).

Great recipe. Followed advice from others to make as a meal and made full sized crab cakes. Being able to prepare ahead of time was great b/c it allowed me to spend more time with my husband. Also followed advice from others adding Old Bay and used green onions instead of chives. Added heirloom tomatoes to the salad too. Exceptional and super easy.

I served these as a first course on New Year's Eve and all plates were empty when I cleared. I did substitute panko for the bread crumbs which I think made them a bit lighter.

These were quite good but very rich- I think it was the mayonnaise. On their own these crab cakes were just ok but when served with the baby greens and lemon vinaigrette, which cut through the richness, they were fantastic! I did add some more sugar and also some vinegar to the dressing though as I thought it needed it. A quick and easy dish which tasted good too!

These crab cakes are amazing! The crab is very 'forward' in this recipe which is exactly the way I like it. These were easy, delicious and, as crab cakes go, light! What more could you ask for in a crab cake? I followed three suggestions from reviews below: I added 2 tsp finely minced shallots, 1/2 tsp old bay and subbed panko for breadcrumbs. Using fresh, high quality crab is key in this particular recipe. I am also looking forward to modifying this into a crab salad for appetizers (leaving out the egg, of course). I kicked up the vinaigrette with more lemon, some champagne vinegar and some chives. Served the cakes on butter lettuce salad with blood oranges and avocado. We licked our plates!

I made these for my parents and husband- we all thought they were delicious. We particularly liked the lemon vinaigrette, definitely worth making your own. I found I used a LOT of bread crumbs to hold everything together. I've actually made these twice- once in a frying pan, and then again in a deep fryer--everything was MUCH easier, safer and cleaner the second time

Excellent recipe. Since this was my first time making crab cakes, I was choosy about the recipe I selected, especially since so many other ones call for a lot of mayo. I used reduced fat mayo and used a little less than asked for. I used panko crumbs. Made a simple tartar sauce to go with it. Fabulous. Wonderful flavors. My husband LOVED it. This will be guest food.

This dish is easy and elegant. My husband and I have made it several times with the following modifications: add breadcrumbs after all other ingredients have been mixed together (this helps to better disperse the breadcrumbs and keeps them from clumping); add a bit more cayenne pepper; broil crabcakes approx. 3 minutes per side; for extra light and fluffy cakes use Japanese Panko flakes instead of bread crumbs. A simple dressing of lemon juice and olive oil is a wonderful accompaniment.

Very good and moist. We do not like crab cakes that are all breadcrumbs so these were great! The quality of the crab is important. I added a little old bay for some kick and some fresh lemon juice. I made 6 large cakes and cooked them for about 3 min. per side. Very good and easy because you can prepare early!

Rating: 4
Absolutely wonderful! I used Panko like some other reviewers suggested and it worked out beautifully. These crab cakes are very flavorful and not greasy at all. I would caution that if using 2 tablespoons to make one crab cake as the recipe calls out, this does not serve 10 people but at the most 4 to 6 people. My husband was looking around for more! We will make this over and over.

I make this dish as a starter for Christmas dinner every year and everyone always raves. I only use fresh dungeoness crab, which is rather expensive, but worth it for special occasions. One small change, I use Japanese Panko instead of basic bread crumbs, giving the crabcakes a light, very crunchy exterior.

Although I used canned meat and did not have chives available, this came out pretty good. I used a mix of cornmeal and breadcrumbs for the coating, which was a good addition.

just moved to Boulder from Tidewtaer Va. We can't seem to get good crab cakes out here (there's a surprise...), so made our own. These are as fabulous as you could hope for anywhere. No filling, just great, sweet lump crab. You MUST use fresh lump crab meat for the best result. I didn't bother with the vinaigrette, just went with traditional cocktail sauce. There will be no other recipe in our house!

Made for a crowd at X-mas. Everyone loved them. I especially liked them because they were easy and held their shape. Loved the lemon vinaigrette.

We served this at our Christmas dinner party. The best we've ever had. The delicate flavor of the crab is not overpowered with a lot of additives. Easy to make.

I made this recipe for a dinner party of 12. It was the best tasting crab cakes I had ever had and they got rave reviews from my guests. I used baby greens and tossed them lightly with the vinegarette.

I made this for an elegant Christmas dish for my husband and me....YUMMY!!! Made just as written with the exception that I added a wee bit more Frank's Hot Sauce. And rather than baby greens, I used the asparagus with lemon vinaigrette recipe elsewhere on this site. We gobbled them up and found ourselves looking around for more...the flavor of the crab really shines through if you don't spoil it with too much junk. GET GOOD QUALITY CRAB MEAT!!! We got ours from Central Market and were able to taste-test it before buying. I believe it made all the difference.

I made the crab cakes this weekend as a "dry run" for Christmas, and thought they were great.

These are sooooo good! I used panko crumbs instead of regular bread crumbs. And served just as written. Although I certainly understand the comments of others that they are not "seasoned" enough, they were JUST what I was looking for. I don't like a lot of fillers when dealing with an ingredient as wonderful as crabmeat. My biggest complaint about crabcakes in a restaurant is that they taste pasty. These are wonderful for my tastes just as is. Except for the panko. I use that for most of my "breaded" dishes.

Rating: 4
Made this as the first course for a dinner party, and it was a big hit. The baby greens and vinaigrette are the perfect balance to the crabcakes. Make sure to use a generous amount of fresh lemon juice in the dressing -- a little extra doesn't hurt. I fried the crabcakes an hour in advance and kept in a 200 degree oven before serving with no problems -- if anything it helped the flavors develop a little more.

I made this dish as a starter to a fabulous New Years Eve dinner and it was a hit!!! The crab cakes were quite wet so I added more bread crumbs to bind them and needed to add more dijon and hot sauce for flavor. This was a perfect light starter to the rich dinner that followed. Happy 2001!!!

This recipe is fantastick! Very easy...some say bland, but crab is delicate, and I usually dont like anything that masks its wonderful flavor. I did add a dash of Old Bay and a little dried dill. I formed larger patties, and ended up with eight. Great for an appetizer or a meal, and well suited for entertaining because they have to chill prior to cooking. This will be one of my mainstays!

I thought this was one of those simple yet elegant dishes. I found the crab cakes to have excellent flavor - I added more dijon just to give it more kick. I also added a little lemon pepper to the vinaigrette to make it a little more flavorful. My guests loved the crab cakes - however I was fortunate to have 6 guests so there were enough cakes to go around, but I couldn't imagine getting 20 cakes out of this recipe...will definitely make it again.

I also jazzed these crab cakes up with extra seasonings, and I did find them a bit wet. I think they held together well when I was sauteing because I made them small. They were great as a first course with the salad. I would make them again as an appetizer or first course.

I just didn't think this recipe had much taste. I added alittle Old Bay and some extra Tabasco, but to no avail. Additionally, I made mine alittle bigger, as I planned to serve them as a main course, but they did not hold together well. Frying in a skillet requires some turning and this is where a tad more filler would have helped out.
