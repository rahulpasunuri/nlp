I really hated this recipe. It was a bland, goopey mess at the end. No doctoring could fix this monstrosity. The pasta was overcooked. I suggest dropping the eggs in 2 minutes BEFORE the pasta is supposed to be done so that the pasta doesn't suffer while you cook the eggs. Maybe that would help?

Ok, I see what another reviewer said about curdling. It's not the most attractive soup, so I probably wouldn't serve it to company. However, the taste is very good, and it's a nice comfort soup for an easy weekday meal. The only change I made was to add a bit of lemon juice. I can see this recipe could be added to with a lot of different things, like carrots, dill, etc. Tasty basic.

This is my standby dish. It's extremely easy to make and delicious to boot. The egg ribbons can be finicky in getting to the right texture, but fortunately it still tastes good. To add variety or make the soup a little bit heartier, I sometimes throw in a couple of matzo balls. I've also discovered that using very aged parmesan cheese gives the soup a gritty texture - best to stick to cheap bagged parmesan in this dish.

Yikes, my soup curdled! What happened? All ingredients were fresh and high-quality... Anybody else have this problem? I was looking forward to making this my go-to quick soup for the rest of the winter!

When I prepared this recipe for the first time, the whole family said, "Make this every week"! It is a very simple and delicious meal.

I like this soup, because of how simple it was to make. Two of my three children liked the soup, however one of them did not care for it. Seemed to me the soup was missing something, it really needs more favor.

A very good, extremely easy soup. Use plenty of parsley to make the soup taste fresh.

This is a great easy soup. My kids love it. My mom use to make something like this and add a spoonfull of ricotta cheese. Delicious.

Great Soup. My mother would make this soup for us when we were children- a heartier version she would called "Sopa Blanca". Diced potatoes were boiled in prior to the addition of the egg and parmesan mixture. She used water instead of chix stock and would add a little cream cheese to make the water look milky. And lost of freshly chopped parsley.
