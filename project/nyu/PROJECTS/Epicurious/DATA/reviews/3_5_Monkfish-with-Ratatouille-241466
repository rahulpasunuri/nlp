I loved this, though I think the quality and simplicity of the red sauce is crucial--a store-bought sauce with too many herbs and spices will completely overwhelm the fish. I made my own- canned tomatoes, a bit of garlic, a bit of salt and basil, and it was very good.

The ratatouille part of this recipe is great, but if you use this much monkfish, it can be very fishy. I've made it with a couple of tilapia filets before and it was a much better flavor and texture combination. (not to mention cheaper)

I prepared this recipe with high hopes but my husband and I were disappointed. It was really rather bland and hardly worth the effort. I would have thought the capers and fresh thyme and basil would have added some nice flavor, but somehow the whole thing was overwhelmed by the marinara sauce (Paul Newman's). This recipe is good if you like bland. It certainly does not flatter the (also bland) monkfish.

I used catfish instead of monkfish and it seemed to work well. The best part of the dish, though, was the ratatouille part. Delicious. Next time I'll make twice as much of the ratatouille part - yum!

Extremely bland. Didn't like it at all.

I did this recipe many times. In spite of the work of cutting all of the ingredients this is a nice and healthy recipe. I increased the seasoning, I chopped a small red chili pepper without the seeds I also put more salt.

i love monkfish, but it is hard to find. this can be made with many different kinds of fish. i will make this without fish sometimes and its still a delicious ratatouille recipe. with the movie out now, even my 8 yr old daughter will eat her veggies this way!

this was GREAT. my pathetic grocery store didn't even know what "monkfish" was... but was willing to sell me Chilean Sea Bass at $35/lb. the recipe was GREAT. didn't change a thing... won't change a thing next time. but will try to find a "cheaper" alternative for the fish. YUM!!

I couldn't find monkfish anywhere in Omaha so I used mahi mahi instead. I wouldn't recommend it. The ratatouille part was great though - I will try again with a different fish.

This was really great. Made it with Salmon instead of monkfish and it was truly exceptional. Serve it with crusty hot bread and a spicy pinot. Even my kids at this one!

Very good, easy to make. I added some yellow squash and a few mushrooms as well. Really "simple" last minute dinner. I used cod loin because that was what was available and it was perfect. Very good eye appeal when you bring to the table. I'll make again but will increase the capers and add a little crushed red pepper.

Made this for a dinner party and doubled the recipe. Monkfish was tricky to find but was well worth going to a fishmarket for! Absolutely delicious.

My local seafood store didn't have monkfish so I used skate instead. I used much more garlic and added a few mushrooms. This was delicious. My 2-y-olds loved it!

My family loved this recipe, even the kids who usually don't like fish. Used grouper instead of monkfish. Added some mushrooms and yellow squash. Wonderful

This was a delightful recipe. I didn't have eggplant, so I used portabella mushrooms. Enjoy!
