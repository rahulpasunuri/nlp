made muffins and were very very dry, though put them in for reduced time. Flavor was a tad metallic. All of these went straight to the freezer, and I cannot imagine anyone will see reason to defrost them.

Too heavy and dense - very similiar to baked polenta instead of a moist fluffy cornbread.

Served with the salad course this year for Thanksgiving. A wonderful cornbread full of flavor, perfect with a sharp winter salad. The Texan in the group said it was terrific and asked for the recipe. I will be serving this alongside chili and many other main courses in the future. I poured melted butter over the top and popped it under the broiler for a minute right before serving and it was delicious!!

Standout cornbread. I substituted polenta for one of the three cups of yellow cornmeal, and used non-oil packed sun-dried tomatoes, chopped small. The polenta makes this bread crunchy and gives it a lot of character. Served it to friends and it was a unanimous hit. No one guessed the tomato flavor. You might also try adding a half cup or so of fresh or frozen corn kernels, but it's certainly not needed.

Fragrant, moist,flavorful cornbread. Use stoneground cornmeal - great source is Kenyon Gristmill, RI.
