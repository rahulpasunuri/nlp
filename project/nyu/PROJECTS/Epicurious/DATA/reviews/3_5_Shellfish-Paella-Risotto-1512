A great base concept. I read all the reviews and used many of the ideas (added fresh garlic with the onion, andouille sausage because I had it, chicken broth plus some clam juice, combo of arbario and basmati because I didn't have enough arborio in pantry, Sam's frozen paella mix for the shellfins again because it was on hand and a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes! So hard to rate the exact recipe, but this is what I like so much about Epicurious-great recipes for inspiration and great reviews for more ideas. Definitely goes in the file for repeating and maybe someday I'll even follow the recipe.

Nice autumn dish. I would make the sausage/shellfish portion later rather than sooner. Perhaps 5-10 minutes before the risotto was ready. I had to use chicken broth with saffron, and I didn't have spicy Italian sausage so I added 1/2 tsp. Thai chillies. Overall, very tasty and easy to prepare.

This recipe was wonderful and simple. After reading other comments, I skipped clam juice (problems with it before), and instead used chicken broth and first simmered the raw shrimp, with shell, in the broth for 10 mins. I used cherrystone clams and, instead of de-skinned sausage, a great pre-cooked organic pork polish sausage. I also added garlic while cooking the onions. Easy, delicious, and the husband loved it. 3 forks instead of 4 because of the changes.

Great, great recipe! I've made it many times with the following modifications: instead of clam juice, I use 48oz (as previously recommended by another reviewer) of a combination of vegetable and chicken broths. For a bit more of a seafood flavor, I boil the shrimp shells in the broth for 10 minutes or so then remove before adding the saffron. I used a can of clams (to avoid shells), 1 lb shrimp, .5lb small scallop, and .5lb imitation crab or lobster for the seafood, along with the sausage (I added the can of clams after cooking the sausage). For color, I added chopped tomato and red pepper, plus the peas. The pot gets really full, but the leftovers are great!! =) Enjoy!

This dish was great, it was worth the work. I subituted homemade fish stock for the clam juice. Also use yellow spanish rice as a sub for medium grain rice I couldn't find.

As many other reviewers noted, the recipe requires additional liquid. Thanks to one reviewer, Jeff from Marin, for noting the necessary corrections. Had his corrections been in the recipe, I would've given it 4 forks.

Like any risotto, this recipe takes a little while to prepare. . . but worth it. I used a veggie bouillon cube and boiled the shrimp shells in lieu of the clam juice (that stuff is expensive). I also added the tomatoes and peas at the very last minute to minimize the disintegration factor.

I was surprised at my disappointment with the results after reading the other reviews. I followed the recipe closely, and while the dish was fairly tasty and impressive-looking, I found it too clammy and otherwise bland to rate more than two forks--just nothing to get excited about. I am eager to try it again with diluted clam juice or vegetable broth.

This is wonderful! Out of necessity I made some changes: used vegetable and chicken stock instead of clam juice (but simmered the shrimp shells in the broth); omitted the tomatoes and added chopped red bell pepper and garlic; added the broth a cup at a time; omitted mussels and clams and used shrimp and scallops instead; used a mix of homemade sausage and Mexican chorizo (which imparted a great flavor!) The dish came out beautiful and tasted even better. The peas were a nice touch, adding good color and texture. I thought it could have served a lot more than four. More leftovers to enjoy! This is truly a fabulous dish.

A goood dish overall. The rice requires quite a bit more liquid than listed. I used a can of chicken broth as the rice was still crunchy when all the clam juice was cooked down. I found the clam flavoring to be a bit overpowering, but my husband and brother went absolutely nuts over this. I'll definately make it again, perhaps with a few modifications.

Wonderful and easy. I used basmati rice this time and it worked fine. I want to try the aborio rice next time. Everyone raved!

I have made this several times for my guests and everyone swoons. I found the recipe needed more liquid, so I shelled my shrimp and boiled the shells in low salt chicken broth and used that. I added garlic and red pepper, and used an aged spanish chorizo sliced, which I also cooked seperately so I could add to the dish without the oil. I also passed freshly grated parmesan cheese on the side. Spectacular "impress your friends" dish.

This was delicious and so very easy to make. I will be making this again and again!

This was excellent! I skipped the clams and mussels (too much work) and added 4 cloves of garlic and a diced red pepper to the onion. I used 3 links of Aidells habanero & green chile sausage, which is chorizo-like but less fatty. I added about 1/2 teasp. each of oregano and thyme, and used only 1 cup of arborio rice, which absorbed everything. I added 1/2 lb. of scallops with the shrimp at the end. Yum!!

Even if you've never cooked a day in your life - this is a great recipe - follow it to the letter for sure success. Wonderful dish to invite the neighbors over for.

We don't like mussel and clams all that well, so I added the precooked gourmet chicken (as suggested by a prior reviewer) and doubled the shrimp. Also browned and sliced the sausage, so those who don't eat meat could easily avoid it. It was a delicious dish. Next time I'll try sweet sausage--some thought it was a little too spicy. Also think a red pepper in addition to or instead of the tomatoes would be worth a try. I like the colorful presentation this dish makes.

This is the first recipe I have felt is worthy of four forks. If there would have been a 5 fork option I would have selected it. I have made the dish 4 or 5 time. This is a reliable recipe. Absolutly delicious!! You will get raves.

Correction: the rice needs at least 6 (not 4) bottles of clam juice, and we ended up putting 3/4 cup of dry white wine. Sumptious. Also, recommend putting a lid on the simmering paella after adding the rice; that way evaporation doesn't take its toll... White fish (red snapper, halibut, cod, etc.) can be added to recipe or used instead of the shellfish. Also, pre-cooked gourmet chicken or turkey sausages add a zest to the dish... Mmmmmmmmm!
