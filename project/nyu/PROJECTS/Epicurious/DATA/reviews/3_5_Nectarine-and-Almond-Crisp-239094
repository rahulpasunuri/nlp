Great -- if you like sand in your nectarines! The topping was gritty and coarse. Too many tasteless nuts; they might have been improved by toasting first. But the rest of the "crisp" was a no go.

Great recipe. The topping amount is pretty generous, though, so I divided it in half, froze the remainder and used it another time. That made for a super-easy dessert the second time around.

its in the oven right know and i am loving the almond paste. i only used half of the flour and subed the other half with oats. i think it gave it more harty flavor and made the topping more thick. mine ir of a non-bottom pie/crumble. i also subed the butter with apple sause just because the almond past has so much sugar. i had about four cups of nectarins so i use 2 cups of strawberrys and i didnt use apricot preserve i used tart cherry. it might come out a little to tart but you learn from your mistakes. i will most defanatley make thins again. i suggest it because you can take off of the recipie and make it your own very well.

Made this recipe for the first time yesterday. It is rich but absolutely delicious! I didn't have ground cardomon, substituted some allspice, cut down almonds to 3/4c and cut butter to 4T Next time I will cut almonds even more, maybe 1/2 c almonds and 1/2c oats. I don't think that reducing these things will change the overall flavor.

This is rich and delicious. Great for company. On the sweet side, even though i left out the second sugar addition. Don't overdo the cardamom. I added a half-pint of boysenberries which added great flavor and wonderful color. I also subbed half the flour for oats. Very quick to make. I will make this again.

Very good--I made this exactly to the recipe but found that the cardamom amount was too much. Would probably reduce by 1/4 tsp or more.

Delicious! I used peaches instead of nectarines, added cinnamon and didn't use the apricot preserves (thought that would make it too sweet) and it was still a big hit! Will definitely make this again!

Very tasty . . . go easy on the almond paste, especially if you have superb fruit . . .

This recipe was a huge hit at a potluck dinner, and very easy for this inexperienced cook! I couldn't find sliced almonds so I ground whole ones in with the topping and some broken up ones on top.

A great recipe. Only changes I made were I didnt add the xtra sugar to the fruit and added a little more flour since the fruit was ripe. My kitchen smelled so good while it was baking.

This was one of the best fruit recipes I've made. I had a tree heavy laden with nectarines so tried this recipe - fabulous. The almond paste adds an interesting touch.. A Must Try!

Tasty & easy: what more could you want? I warmed the preserves in the microwave to soften/liquify, added a splash (or two) of Grand Marnier & let the nectarines rest for 15 - 20 minutes before adding blackberries to the mix & baking. Served warm with whipped cream - my foodie pals & I loved it.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great and there are too many fabulous fruit dessert recipes out there for me to make this one again. Also, it was very liquidly, so if you're going to try it I would use some kind of thickener.

This is my old-standby summer dessert. Actually all year long, as I freeze summer's bounty. I do not put sugar in the fruit. I often substitute or partially substitute oatmeal for the flour for texture.

WOW!!! This was fabulous! I was in a rush so I used frozen peaches and 1 cup of blueberries. I didn't use any of the spices in the recipe, but, added 1/2 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. of almond extract to the fruit mixture. I baked the fruit for about 15 min. at 375 since it wasn't thawed completely and then added the topping. Baked another 30 min. Served with ice cream. Everyone loved it!

We found this to be extremely bland and not even close to sweet enough. We ate it once and tossed the rest. Too bad, the almond paste was a great idea.

Great recipe! The only change I would make is to peel the fruit and then cut into wedges. Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper! I used peaches instead of nectarines and it was fabulous.

This is so simple and tastes really nice. I have substituted the nectarines for plums and the apricot preserves for blackcurrant jam, and it still tastes absolutely fantastic!!!

Very good. I think I would prefer the nectarines were peeled. Otherwise, no complaints.

I happened to have peaches on hand and used them instead of the nectarines. My fruit was juicy so I cooked the juices with a tbsp. of crushed tapioca to thicken. I used cornstarch instead of flour with the furit. I also added 1 tsp. of almond extract to the peaches. Worked out fine and everybody loved the crisp.

Very good. Made recipe exactly as written. Has a slight bitter aftertaste, I think from the topping. The nectarines are delicious. Pretty easy to make.
