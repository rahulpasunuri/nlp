This was a great easter dish, and wild mushroom and yukon gold potato gratin was amazing with it. I used a boneless leg of lamb rolled and tied for easier carving and it took a long time to cook, about 45 minutes longer. Use an instant read thermometer to evaluate doneness. Brilliant with the shallot sauce and don't skimp on those fresh sprigs: they made a beautiful presentation and lightened the whole dish.

I made this today for St. Patrick's Day along with colcannon from this site. Both were delicious. I loved the combination of herbs. I only gave it 3 forks though because even though it was delicious I've made so many delicious dishes with leg of lamb from this site I couldn't say it was beyond compare.

Nice dish. Don't get lazy on trimming the excess fat, though. I rubbed the herbs into the sheath of fat, so most of the flavoring ended up in the fat that melted off, rather than in the meat. Alternatively, you could stab down into the meat and stuff bits of the herbs, salt and pepper down under the fat. The accompanying rutabega puree was nice, too, but no better than garlic mashed potatoes.

An absolutely wonderful recipe! I made this dish along with other recipes from Epicurious..Leek and Wild Mushroom Stuffing, Sauteed Haricots vert, Red Bell Pepper and Pine Nuts....All with rave reviews from dinner guests. I think we all went to bed dreaming about dinner. I will definitely make it, and all, again.

This lamb is outstanding with the mint shallot sauce. Didn't make the puree but served with a wild mushroom and potato gratin (also on this site) and guests raved. Thank you Epicurious for these wonderful recipes.

I thought that the puree was very nice with the lamb (though I like celariac puree even better).If you don't want the fat, just substitute chicken stock for the cream. I also did the lamb, which was delicious, with some young carrots and a few rutabaga chunks. To these veggies I added grilled portobellos for a very nice veg mix.

We loved this recipe!! My husband made it for the family and got eight tumbs up. We enjoyed so much that I servered it for Easter dinner. Both times however, we served it with the Roasted Root Vegetables from the Dec. 1995 Bon Appetit issue instead of the Rutabaga Puree. Nothing against rutabagas, it just seemed a bit high on the fat-o-meter.

LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT! MY husband did the prepping so putting it together was a breeze. Made the apple chutney-perfect and delicious.

I omitted the puree because I've never even seen a rutabega. But I give this dish four forks (how weird is that?) because the herbs and the lamb were really, mouthwateringly good. Speaking of mouthwatering, the kitchen smelled incredible. My first attempt at leg of lamb, fwiw.

We have made this recipe several times and savour the herb blend combined with the distinctive taste of lamb. We have slow cooked the lamb on a grill and roasted it, both with outstandingly excellent results. When we think of leg of lamb, this is a recipe we like to use over and over. We did not make the accompanying vegetable and cannot comment. The lamb stands on its own.

The herbed lamb and mint shallot sauce were very good but the rutabaga puree just didn't fit well. The puree was too bland to stand up to the lamb but too sweet (unlike, say, mashed potatoes). Fortunately I had canned some of the wonderful Apple Ginger Chutney that I found at epicurious.com, so I pulled that out of the pantry and it was a hit with the lamb.
