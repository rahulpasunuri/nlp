I made this for the first Rosh Hashanah dinner I hosted after marrying my (Jewish) husband - was looking for dishes that would be a "little different" than what people might know from their childhoods. SPECTACULAR! And now a regular hit at RH & Pesach. If I can't find anaheim chiles, I often use a combo of bell peppers and any kind of smaller (even if hotter) peppers & nestle them mized in with each other. The tsimmes balances out even a little hotter pepper, and has lovely "bite."

Rabbi Joe Black from Congregation Albert would tell you to use Big Jim green chilies from Hatch, NM. They were designed by the NMSU Ag Dept to be used with Chili Rellenos. Vince Wahler

I got a batch of green chiles (New Mexico) that were a bit too thin, so they fell apart when I peeled them. I chopped them up and put them in the tsimmes. Turned out really good!

I cook southwestern type stuff a lot and I like the idea of stuffing roasted chiles with something sweet. The whole point, to me, is the unusual and intriguing combination of chiles ( Anaheims are only slightly hotter than bell peppers) and the vegetable mixture. It takes quite a while to roast, prepare and stuff chiles so I prepped the thing the day before, leaving myself nothing but the final bake at mealtime. First off, it seemed strange to roast the chiles in a 450 oven and expect the skins to char-I've always broiled them-and it was! Nothing much happened. I ended up raising the temp and broiling the chiles, and then the skins blistered and blackened and I was able to continue the prep. Second, maybe I used a race of super carrots, but no matter how long I baked the vegetables at 250, the carrots never softened enough to mash. I baked them for hours and still ended up with hard carrot bits. No mashing possible here-you'd end up with grit in your teeth. So I pureed the vegetables and, no surprise, the texture was peculiar, homogeneous and pasty, though the taste turned out to be fine. It s exactly what would happen if you pureed, rather than mashed, your potatoes. I stuffed the chiles ahead of time as planned and they looked lovely, taasted good, and my guests enjoyed them. But, I'm disappointed when I follow recipe directions and it doesn't turn out the way they promise. My respects to all who were successful, but it just didn't work for me.

This recipe (minus the chilies) has served me well for at least 20 years. I make it every passover to rave reviews from jews and non-jews alike. Credit goes to Waldbaums of Brooklyn, NY.

I love this recipe. I never stuff it in chiles though. I just make it as a casserole. It's a family holiday favorite.

This was delicious served as a side dish in a casserole--no chilis and no cilantro. I left it in the oven overnight on a low heat and didn't mash the vegetables though the prunes and yams had pretty much disintigrated. There was something different about it from the run of the mill tsimmes and everybody at our seder enjoyed the mellow citrusy flavors.

This is our signature dish for our Passover Seder. Always a big hit - even with people who don't like tsimmes or chilies!

I made this in a casserole without the chiles. I added two thinly sliced leeks to a more than doubled recipe. I also used a little ground coriander because I could not fine fresh. The result was super. Not a drop was left!
