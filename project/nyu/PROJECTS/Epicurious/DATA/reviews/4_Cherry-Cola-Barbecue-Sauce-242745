This is the best BBQ sauce. My daughter puts it on everything. I gave some to my neighbor with some ribs, and she told me she was using bread, boiled eggs, you name it, to use up the remaining sauce. It keeps a long time and has become a staple in our house.

Loved this! We used it to baste country-style ribs, and it was absolutely delicious. We used molasses instead of brown sugar and pureed the reduced sauce in the food processor.

Here in the south, we've been making barbeque sauces with cola and ketchup for decades; so I had to laugh when I saw this one. I tried it, though, and I must say it's delicious. I prefer molasses to brown sugar, too, but otherwise wouldn't change a thing.

Very good sauce. Made it for company and they loved it. I pureed in a blender for a smooth sauce and poured some in a squeeze bottle to use at the table.

Does it really matter if I use balsamic vinegar rather than wine vinegar and what about the chilli sauce....how much of a difference will that make if I just used ketchup.....

Made this for a large family BBQ. I used it on chicken parts. It was hit! i really like the sweet/spicy-ness. it would be good with pork.

This sauce is the bomb. I add roasted jalepenos to make it pop even more. My friends freak out when they taste this sauce on my smoked ribs.

I made this sauce for a 4th of July barbecue with ribs, and it was spectacular. We've been making a Kentucky whiskey barbecue sauce for years for the 4th and it's a favorite. This year, this cherry cola sauce beat out the Kentucky whiskey sauce as the favorite. This sauce is spicy but has an incredible sweetness that is amazing with savory barbecue. I was a little nervous at first because, fresh-cooked, the chili sauce flavor really overpowered the cherry cola and preserves flavors. However, a day later, the flavors totally balanced out and the cherry flavor came forward. I did, however, add more cherry cola at first because I did not want the chili sauce to be the feature, and I think that was a good choice. This sauce is definitely a family staple from now on. A week later, I want to make another pot, just to have around. It's that good.

This is easy and completely amazing. The cherry flavor was delicious with the very spicy chili rub I used from another recipe (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Chili-Rubbed-Baby-Back-Ribs-with-Espresso-Barbecue-Sauce-108240). I added a bit of espresso powder at the end but I am not even sure it was needed. I will definitely make this again. In fact, I am looking forward to using the leftover sauce again this weekend.

Reviewed this recipe the other night as I used it on chicken breasts on the grill. Tonight, with the leftover sauce, I used it on pulled pork (in a slow cooker I cooked pork tenderloins with a little water and s&p until fork tender, I shredded it, sprinkled the rub over it, added the leftover bbq sauce and slow cooked it another hour). Served it on buns and it was amazing! Bet it would be great with pulled chicken or beef as well.

I always have difficulty with meat as a main dish since I don't eat too much of it. Found a deal on a pork butt, had yet to return a friend's crock pot, and thought I'd prefer a homemade barbecue sauce to bottled. Well. Delicious! I didn't have cherry cola-used dr. pepper. Didn't have chili sauce-used ketchup and cayenne (watch out-as the sauce reduces the heat intensifies). Listened to the southerner and used molasses instead of brown sugar. So did I really make this recipe? I'd say so.

loved the rub mixture- it perfectly matched the sticky sweetness of the bbq sauce. Used it on bone-in chicken breasts and the grill and it was fantastic!

Fantastic stuff. Used it for pulled pork and it got rave reviews. Strain the cherry chunks out it before you put it in a squeeze bottle, it will make it easier to serve.

Fabulous! This is an unbelievable sauce or condiment; it's perfect on burgers. Using brown sugar in a barbecue sauce offends everything in my Southern heritage, so I subbed in some molasses instead. That said, the initial sweetness is deep and rich without completely overpowering the tastes, and it's followed by a mild heat that builds but never reaches an uncomfortable intensity.

This was the best BBQ sauce ever. My sister followed the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious. I can hardly wait to make it also.

Excellent and very different BBQ sauce. I made half the recipe, easy to make.

Boy was this sauce good! Served it on grilled steaks and my guests all raved about it. The recipe makes a lot (about 2 cups) so cut it down or, better yet, plan wonderful things with the left overs. Yum!

The sauce was delicious. even my picky daughter loved it. I used it on ribs the first time, but later (it stores well) tried it on chicken and pork chops. Great flavor and easy to make.

We loved the cherry hint and the sweetness but it is a bit thick as in a relish or chutney consistency, but very flavorful and useful as a side sauce for dipping or as a baste for pork ribs(which is where i tried it first as i am a pork hound) Good recipe!!

Absolutely delicious.

God! this stuff is good! I used my stick blender to smooth it out and It thickend it up a bit, too.

To A Cook from Baltmore: Add a little gumbo file to thicken (powdered sassafras)Buy it at penzeys.com. Will add a slight lemony flavor and just a touch will thicken the sauce beautifully!

Tastes great but it never seemed to thicken up - any ideas on how to make this sauce a little stickier?

As a condiment this tasted more like a chutney than a barbecue sauce, but it worked wonders as a basting sauce on baby back ribs!
