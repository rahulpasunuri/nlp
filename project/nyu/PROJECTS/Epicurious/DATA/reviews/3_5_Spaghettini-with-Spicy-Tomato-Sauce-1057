I thought this was delicious and perfect for a cool fall evening!! The only changes I made, was to leave out the carrot, add a little extra sausage and used bowtie pasta. My husband said to put it in the keeper file!!

I thought this was great even though I had to substitute canned mushrooms and yellow squash for the zucchini. My teenage son however wanted to know what I had "put into" the spaghetti. Maybe not a dish for kids but a keeper for adults.

I just made this and loved it. I think I put too much peppers in it because it had kick! But I loved it nevertheless.

Fabulous recipe! I made some modifications to make use of summer produce: 4 pounds fresh tomatoes instead of the puree and canned and added 3 tspns of fresh herbs in the last 10 minutes of cooking instead of the dried oregano (basil, italian parsley and oregano).

I have been making the dish regularly since it first appeared in Bon Appetit. Since I have two vegetarians in the house I make a few changes to compensate for not using the sausage: I double the mushrooms, add chopped sun dried tomatoes and a little dried fennel. I also increase the spicing. Everyone loves it and it is healthy as well. Great recipe!

This is absolutely yummy. I used 1/2 lb. each of sweet Italian sausage and hot Italian sausage, and I used a 19 oz. can of stewed Italian tomatoes.

If you can find it, substitute turkey spicy italian sausage - still very tasty, and not nearly as unhealthy.

I made this recipe and it was excellent, however for the non-vegi people in my house I ommitted a few things. Such as the carrot, bell pepper, and zucchini. I also substituted a can of plain tomatoe sauce instead of the crushed tomatoes, and the italian stewed tomatoes. It was still really a great meal his way but if you enjoy a more diverse chunky sauce I suggest leaving the vegis in.

This has become a family favorite! I cook things in a different order though - particularly the sausage - I cook it first, dump it on several layers of paper towel to soak up the grease; pour any remianing grease out of the pan; lightly carmelize the onions and garlic in any remaining fat; add the mushrooms and wine to the pan and simmer together until the scraps come loose from the bottom of pan then I add the meat/onions/garlic/wine mushrooms to the tomatoes; saute the peppers and zucchini and add them to the tomatoes etc. and let it all simmer together for a bit. Wonderful! Freezes well too!

not rating it, but i just wanted to say that i unwittingly made a sauce very similar to this, and it was excellent. i used celery instead of bell pepper (for a mirepoix), 2 tbsp tomato paste, dried basil and thyme w/ the oregano, and a smaller proportion of canned tomatoes. the key, for me, is simmering the mirepoix + garlic for a long time in the beginning, in plenty of oil, to really sweat it out (i think i cooked it for 1/2 hour). the sauce was delicious!

I doubled this recipe for a family gathering and served it with homemade pasta. I used half hot/ half mild sausage, since I wasn't sure if the sauce would be too spicy for some family members. Next time, I will use all hot sausage. Regardless, it was wonderful. A definite keeper!!!

This is a different sauce recipe. I liked the depth of flavor from the carrot and the sausage. It needs twice the amount of garlic that called for. A solid recipe.

Have made this dish a dozen times -- it has a deep, rich flavor. I pump up the crushed red pepper by another 1/4 tsp, and pour off the sausage grease and substitute olive oil. This dish is a keeper.

I have made a spicy sauce nearly identical to this and loved it! Although I spent more time cooking than I usual, it was worth every minute. The texture and flavors blended just perfectly. Definitely worth the effort.
