I've made this a couple of times and have really enjoyed it. The dressing is great and can be used on a basic salad. I added grilled chicken, peeled cucumber chunks, and steamed green beans to make it more of a meal.

I have made this dish several times always to rave reviews. I push the olives aside for my own serving as I hate olives, but most people love them. Go figure.

I've been making this regularly since the original issue came out - my husband absolutely LOVES the dressing...we use it for more than just this recipe! Definitely a keeper..

Absolutely incredible, especially with garden fresh tomatoes.

Great flavor, simple to prepare and an excellent salad/accompaniment to almost any menu. I halved the tomatoes, olives and feta for 2 people and only made 1/3 the dressing. One-half cup ++ dressing would be way too much for 2 tomatoes.
