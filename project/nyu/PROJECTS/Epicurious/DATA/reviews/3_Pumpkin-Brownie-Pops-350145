I used the recipe with the whoopie pie recipe on this site. It makes A LOT, especially if you finish it for a few minutes in the standing mixer. I used 1 tbs of vanilla bean paste, which left pretty little black specks in the frosting. A yummy frosting for those who like it sweet and marshmallow-y.
