I think I used a little too much orange peel, because it overpowered my poor custard! Oh well. I'd make it again, use less peel, and fresher fruit, because my fruit is getting a little too ripe. Overall though, very good! The crust is *delicious* (I did add a teaspoon water, but probably not needed). Custard easy to make. Quite a simple recipe really!

Awesome. I'm not too fond of cream cheese, but the texture of the cheese with the sweetness of the fruit is divine!

The crust was way too crumbly, like a short-bread, couldn't roll it out so just pressed it into the pan which made it tough. Should there be water added? Also the custard was runny. Total flop.
