I thought this was very yummy (my tastes dictated that I be a little more liberal with the mustard and less generous with the haricot vert),but it was a lot of effort for a less-than-stellar payoff.

Yum! The photograph is not correct! It is a photo of the salmon and halibut tatare with fennel, chives, avocado and pistachio oil. The correct photo is on page 133 of "Salad as a Meal"

Based on prior reviews, I'll try this tonight but with the Cilantro Dressing (Bon Apetit 2004)left over from another recipe.

We prepared this salad with shrimp instead of lobster. It was most excellent. The next time, we may substitute asparagus for the green beans and add jicama. In any case, this recipe is guest-quality and we will prepare it again.

This is light, crisp, refreshing, summery, amazingly healthy and plain bland. My reaction was to go back through the recipe and look for what I forgot to put in there. I'll probably do it again, but I'll find some way to jazz it up for my tastebuds.

While I have prepared just superb Epicurious recipes too numerous to mention, I have also observed quite a few glaring errors in many of the recipes posted here. I have no idea what dish is pictured for this recipe, but it is not from the posted recipe. I agree with others who have commented about that.

I must agree with Nonnie46 - the photo looks absolutely delicious, but not a lot like the recipe accompanying it. I don't see any green beans, either and question what those large raw salmon-looking (to me, not tomatoes)chunks are - it doesn't look like lobster or lobster roe. It also looks like there are onions or julienned jicama in it as well. (I'd love the recipe for whatever that salad in the picture is, as well!)

My husband and I thought the recipe was average but nothing special. We actually found it so bland that we added curry, and that was a definite improvement. It just needs some pizazz.

This salad is so good, it's part of our regular rotation. It's so filling and yet so light. My husband refuses to eat fruit inside a meal but this recipe was so good, my husband ate every last bite.

The photo in this recipe is very misleading. It looks like it has tomatoes instead of apples and it doesn't look like there are any green beans. Is this the same recipe?

This is an amzing salad. I made it for 2 peple and I only had 4oz lobster meat on hand so I added crab meat to supplement. Served in lettuce cups.
