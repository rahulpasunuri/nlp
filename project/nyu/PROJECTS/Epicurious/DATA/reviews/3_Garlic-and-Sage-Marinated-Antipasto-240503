This was OK, but I didn't think it was much better than what I can buy pre- made at the deli. And what exactly is "fruity" olive oil?

The recipe makes it sound like this dish should be served immediately, but the flavors need to set. Let the olives and artichoke marinate overnight in the vinegar and olive oil. Add the feta before serving.
