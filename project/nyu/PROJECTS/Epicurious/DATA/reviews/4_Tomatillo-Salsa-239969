Very good! If you want more heat I add a habanero and jalapeno (seeds removed).

it's about time there's tomatillo recipe where you don't parboil or broil the tomatillos first. great idea. it was simple and refreshing.

Left out serrano chili and water, added a T. sugar. Used red onion instead of white and did not cook the sauce. Just pureed everything together at the same time. Served it with chicken fajitas. Delicious!

Super yummy. I decided not to cook it and wonder what is the reason for doing so? Mine was very pungent-just the way I like it.

Very tasty, though I added more lime than it calls for. It did end up a little watery, but vey delicious would make it again.

Super easy and surprisingly easy. I substituted a piece oh hot pepper for the serrano because that's what I had here.

This was a big hit, we made it just as instructed. Surprisingly, everyone liked this better than tomato salsa.

This was pretty good. I love tomatillos...but really dislike cilantro. (taste like soap). I upped the chile and the lime just a bit. Used a fraction of the cilantro. Substituted some fresh parsley and oregano (just a little). Very nice!

Simple but effective recipe. I usually add a few green olives in my mix to have my Tomatillo Salsa stand out from the rest.

So good, so easy. But if you want any heat, add more than 1 chile. I added 1 and a half, and it still had not detectable heat.
