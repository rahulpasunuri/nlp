A great deal of work. Too much to be prepared on the day of entertaining. But preparing in advance, and then chilling, caused the custard to crack severely which really spoiled the appearance. Taste was only okay.

What I liked best about this recipe was the crust (with extra spices as recommended by other reviewers). I did not find the pears to be particularly tasty or attractive, possibly because I started with small and relatively flavorless pears. Curiously, there seemed to be twice as much custard as the crust would hold. If I made it again, I would use more pears, less custard and possibly skip the cranberry juice poaching step.

I've found that recipes calling for ginger never call for enough. So I used 3 tablespoons of ginger. I also doubled the allspice, cinnamon and molasses. I had trouble with the poached pears falling into mush. Maybe my pears were too ripe to begin with. So at the last minute I used unpoached pears on the tart. I also did not have any cranberry juice so I used apple juice instead. I reduced the juice all the way down to a thick glaze and spooned all of it onto the pears to finish. It was a spectacular dessert that got completely consumed at my Christmas party to rave reviews. I would definitely make it again.

This is a fantastic recipe that I made back in Dec 91 when it first was published in Gourmet. The aroma while it is baking is so fragrant!

It was so-so for all the work. I thought the crust was bland...not very gingerbread tasting. However, it was pretty but probably will not make this again.

I served this wonderful dessert to my family/clients at a great Christmas party. It was a great hit with all the women, I doubled up on the pear's and used half in the dinner salad. It was a smart move because everyone loved the salad and when it was time for dessert everyone had this dish and not much of the others. Second time is easer, and so on and so on.

This was a very heavy and dense tart. Indeed it looked quite impressive but that's because of all the work that was put into it. Still it had a bland taste and there was way too much filling. I prefer the French way of making tart - very flat and with a delicate filling.

I made this dessert for my oldest son's christening party. Not only did it look beautiful and elegant, it was delicious and appealed to the palettes (sp?) of both young and old alike! Highly recommend!
