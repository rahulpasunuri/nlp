I subbed the brandy with Bailey's and almonds with Ghiradelli milk choc chips and it is wonderful!

Great! I have made this a few times now. Great for Christmas gifts since one batch makes quite a few. I added dried cranberries (reducing the amount of almonds) and omitted the almond extract (replacing it with additional brandy). Yum! Definitely make these ahead of time.

IMPORTANT TIP: Since the loaves do not change shape at all when baking, and the dough is impossible to shape into logs after refrigeration (I left it overnight...), I recommend you mold your desired shape before refrigeration. Baking does not alter shape, whatever form it has on the baking sheet is the form it will come out... I wasn't aware of this and as they were my first, I thought they would flatten out and make the usual biscotti shape. Nada... ended up with malformed tree branches... LOL

This recipe may be designated Italian here but it is virtually identical to the mandelbrot (camische bread) recipe handed down through five generations of Jewish mothers to daughters in my mom's family! The family originally lived in Kishinev, in what was then known as Bessarabia (now Moldova). Small world!

This is one of the best biscotti recipes I have tried. For Christmas I substituted 1/2 cup pistashios and 1/2 cup dried cranberries for the almonds, and it worked beautifully. This one is a keeper for sure.

You should double this recipe, as they will be a huge hit. Easy to make, and delicious.

My first review is below. My second time making these I substituted half/half corn flour and whole wheat flour and it gave the biscotti a nice rustic flavor and texture. I also added cranberries and chocolate chips to one loaf for variation. Be careful to only add about 1 to 1.5 cups of extras (nuts, berries, etc) because they get super crumbly when the ratio of extras to dough gets stretched too far. Also, unless you like tall biscotti, flatten the loaf out before baking. Neither of my loafs changed shape or spread all that much during baking. Lastly, be careful not to cut them too fat - they are difficult to eat when they are thicker than 3/4".

These are my first biscotti and they turned out really well. I made it as directed except I substituted cognac for brandy, accidentally added an extra tsp of vanilla, and used salted butter (skipped the 1/4 tsp of salt). I had almost zero issues with crumbles. My guess is that if you cook it too long on the first baking, you wont be able to cut the loaf smoothly. My loaf had the consistency of a cookie when I scored and then sliced it. The loaf was barely brown on top. I baked them about 8-10 minutes on each side to make sure they got perfectly done on each side. I got almost 2 dozen large and perfectly shaped biscotti. Personally, I thought they tasted blah after coming out of the oven the first time. After they came out of the oven the second time they were better but I was still disappointed. After they sat on the counter for few hours and dried out they tasted great. I don't think the almond flavor is too strong and I'm glad I didn't cut back on the almond extract. Toasting the almonds is a must! Next time I'm going to use a mix of flour types - I think a whole wheat flour blend would be better than all-purpose white flour because while these are good, they taste and look exactly like starbucks-bought biscotti. Usually I make stuff that looks and tastes a bit more original/homemade. These came out too perfect!

Delicious! Reduced the almond flavouring to 1 tsp as suggested by others. Increased the chopped almonds to 1 cup and drizzled with bittersweet chocolate. Watch while baking for the second time as mine started to brown half-way through the recommended bake time.

Not as flavorful as anticipated.

I have tried a great number of biscotti recipes. These were, by far, the easiest to make and the very best I have ever baked. I followed the recipe closely and really liked the strong almond taste and smell of the cookies. Having read the reviews, I followed the advice of the reviewer who suggested cutting with a very thin serrated knive - it worked great for me and the cookies did not crumble. I will definitely try these again as this is a recipe that is prime for endless variation.

I just finished baking these wonderful biscottis I followed the recipe except I added rum instead of brandy and garnished them with melted chocolate. There is no way you will go wrong with this recipe. Love it love it love it!!!! I had an old recipe for biscotti and I will make them from this recipe for sure from now on...

My husband declared these not just good but really, really good. I made the recipe exactly and had no problems. I did put the dough in the refrigerator, then had to stop baking to make dinner, so it chilled for about an hour and a half. I had no difficulty at all forming the loaves, didn't even need wet hands. For anyone who had trouble with crumbling, it may be your knife. I made the first few cuts with my serrated bread knife, which has a thick blade, and the biscotti did just crumble. So I switched to an inexpensive serrated knife with a very, very thin blade, and the rest of the biscotti did not crumble. I also noticed that when I exerted too much pressure on the knife they wanted to start crumbling, so I just eased up on the pressure and let the knife do the work, and had no crumbling. I will definitely make these again.

Excellent. Wet hands is the key to making the logs. I have made this many times with no almond extract to great results. Last time I used 2 tsps, as directed, and found it to be overbearing. One is plenty.

This is a fantastic biscotti recipe. Just the right amount of sweetness and crunch. It also lends itself beautifally to variations. I cut back on the toasted almonds from one cup to 1/2 cup and substituted dried cherries for the second 1/2 cup. Used cherry brandy and toppe each cookie with melted chocolate. They came out fantastic.

So simple & so tasty. One of the things that I like most about this recipe...I didn't need to use the Cuisinart or Kitchen Aid so there was that much less to clean! It seems that I didn't have any brandy but Amaretto worked perfectly. I made a second batch right on the heels of the first batch using dried cranberries, orange zest & bourbon. (I could have sworn that I had a bottle of Grand Mariner when I started on the second batch, but no...did not). I would so make this again!

Love it! Easy, Fast and Delicious! Easier than Chocolate chip cookies i think. The aroma filled the house when i was making it. All the people who ate it rave about it. I can't wait to make it again!

Easy and delicious - it takes about 2 1/2 hours, but most of that is just waiting for it to cook or to cool on the counter. The preparation is only 20 minutes. I made it with friends and we substituted cut-up Lindt milk chocolate for sliced almonds. The kitchen smelled wonderful and the biscotti turned out perfect. I think this would be a perfect gift to make. I can't wait for my next morning cup of coffee!

Best biscotti recipe I've ever found. Thank you!!!

This was just OK for me. Good but not great. There are better recipes out there.

Wow! They are in the oven right now for the second round of baking and I can't tell you how heavenly the house smells. The dough is so fragrant with the butter and the almonds. Like other reviewers, I used amaretto in place of the brandy to up the almond flavor. I couldn't resist snacking as I sliced them and let's just say that I can't believe that they get *better* after this. They are phenomenal fresh from the oven!!

Fabulous, fabulous recipe!!! I made this for the first time last night. The cookie tasted like what I buy. I opted to use Grand Marnier rather than cheap cherry Brandy; maybe some Drumgray Creme Scotch next time....

Made this recipe and changed it up with adding about 1/2 cup of dried cherries and they turned out fabulous. Also made them exactly as recipe calls for and they turned out great. Disappeared from the platter immediately--guests enjoyed them so much. :)))))

Everything one ought to want in a biscotti recipe: easy and yields consistently great results. It also lends itself well to variation and alteration: have played around with different extracts, tried other nuts, and added things like cocoa nibbs or dried fruit. Lovely every time.

Just like my Italian grandmother used to make. I left out the Brandy for a teetotal, and replaced half of the almonds with more hazelnuts. I also baked the slices on both sides.

Wonderful! I added chopped dried apricots which paired perfectly with the almonds. I bought a bottle of brandy just for this recipe--it was very inexpensive.

Absolutely delicious. The almond flavor is great. I omitted the brandy, and they turned out perfectly.

This was DELICIOUS. I used amaretto as well because a) I don't like the taste of brandy and b) i didn't have any almond extract. It worked perfectly! I also didn't roast the almonds beforehand (I didn't think it was necessary) and I added about a half cup of craisins. SO good! A real hit.

These cookies are crispy, easy to make and best of all delicious. Will make many times again.

These cookies turned out well. I added cognac instead of brandy, but might try amaretto like another reviewer suggested. I would also add more almonds and maybe some dried cranberries. I made them on parchment paper and had no problems with sticking. They did turn out rather hard, but I guess that's how biscotti are supposed to be.

These are fantastic and so easy! As the recipe says, they do get better over the course of 1-2 days. This is a keeper.

What a great recipe! I added about a cup of chocolate chips which melt nicely when dunked in coffee. These aren't super crunchy like a lot of biscotti, closer to a cookie consistency, but I think they are great.

These are great and very easy to make. The only thing I would change is that I would add more nuts. I like a lot of nuts in my biscotti.

These were good, easy to make. I made them a little longer like you buy them at fancy coffee houses. I didn't have any brandy in the house so I substituted amaretto which tasted delicious, brought out the almond flavour.

These biscotti had good flavour but the loaves stuck to the ungreased baking sheet and broke when I transfered them to a rack to cool. They also crumbled when I sliced them. I baked the pieces and they tasted great. I'm guessing that the first baking was too long or too high a temp so I'll try again, underbaking a bit and greasing the baking sheet. I did follow the recipe exactly.
