I am gluten intolerant (Celiac). The origin of blue cheese involves bread mold. However, most (or many) blue cheeses are gluten free, as modern mold cultures are made in the laboratory and don't contain any gluten. There are some traditional blue cheeses that will contain gluten. I think Belgioso Gorgonzola, Marin French Cheese Factory Blue Cheese, Maytag Blue Cheese, Monforte Blue Cheese, Pt. Reyes Blue Cheese, Rosenborg Blue Cheese, Paladin MonSalvat Blue Cheese are all gluten free! Contact the cheese makers to make sure for yourself. I look forward to trying this recipe myself!

I agree with the other poster... due to the blue cheese, this is NOT a gluten-free recipe.

I've made this salad twice in the past month, both for dinner parties. It was a huge hit! Even people who didn't like grapefruit and/or beets truly loved the flavour. This is a new addition to my guest table.

found this on a "gluten free" search. Blue cheese is not gluten free. It is fermented with bread

This was awesome. I didn't have watercress and don't care for it so I used spinach and beet greens, from the garden. The grapefruit really made it. I just used average blue cheese as well. I forgot the salt and pepper but it didn't need it.

Really liked the salad. I think the bitterness of watercress is important. I strongly disagree with the order of ingredients on the plate. The beets are luscious and beautifull but putting them on top hides (and stains) the blue cheese and grapefruit segments. I recommend the following order: watercress, beets, dressing, grapefruit, blue cheese, fresh cracked pepper

We enjoy this salad a lot and I've made it many times, usually substituting mixed baby greens for the watercress. Rather than sectioning a grapefruit or cooking up beets, I've sometimes used refrigerated sectioned grapefruit from a jar and grated whole canned beets, chilled, when I've been in a real hurry. Fine-quality blue cheese is important.

This one was a true find. Even those that weren't crazy about beets enjoyed this salad. Great mix of flavors to please the palate. I was unable to get watercress, so had to use mixed baby field greens, worked well. To dress the salad I used the food processor and added some goat cheese. It was delicious.

We often serve this using a bunch of arugula in place of the watercress. Important: be sure to use an excellent cheese, preferable roquefort.
