This was a really nice, easy soup. I used 2%milk instead of cream, so I'm sure it was slightly less wonderful, but still good. Seemed like a lot of leeks to me, though--you could probably get by on one only.

This was so good - like an authentic New England fish chowder (which New Englanders know isn't thick). I didn't have any leeks on hand, so I substituted with chopped onion. Husband loved it. This recipe is a keeper.
