Soup was amazing. Took advice of other reviewers. Used a little sherry, added thyme and pureed half the soup. Also added a little shallots and onion. So delicious!!!

This soup is exceptional. The flavor is perfect. The concentration of mushroom flavor is exactly what a true mushroom lover would try to attain. There is no cream to take away from the mushroom flavor. The leeks give another layer of flavor that perfectly complements the mushrooms. I would serve this as a first course with a roast beef or chicken but it is perfect with a roast beef sandwich as well.

This was very good and easy to make. I made a few additions and/or substitutions. I added thyme while mushrooms were sauteeing, rehydrated dried porcini's and added them as well as the liquid to the soup, used mushroom instead of chicken stock (Better than Bouillon brand), red wine instead of white, and added cooked barley (which necessitated adding more stock). Will definitely make again.

I made it mostly as-is, except added a tsp of dried thyme. I thought it was delicious, but my husband declared it 'boring'. There's no accounting for taste, eh? So next time I may try some of the enhancements others have suggested....

This recipe turned out wonderful. I added more mushrooms, including fresh shiitakes, one more leak, 3 cloves garlic, and a few more ounces vegetable broth and let it simmer an extra 20 minutes, then pureed it a little. My guests loved it, and it was even better the next day! I served it with an olive cheese toast that really set it off.

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. It was very easy to make, but packed a lot of flavour. I think next time I make I might add some Chinese noodles to make it more of a meal.

Excellent. of course I couldn't leave it alone,for 10 people I used 6 leeks, 10 cups of vegetarian chicken broth (I don't know how they do that!) & added very thin slices of celery plus the tops. Used white pepper, an Orvieto wine, and just a tad (about 1/2 tsp) poultry seasoning. to boost the broth. This kind of soup is easy to expand for a crowd without getting bogged down in mathematics, & is always pleasing any time of the year.

This dish was so quick, easy, and delicious. Perfect for using up leeks and mushrooms. I added a bayleaf, fresh thyme, and fesh oregano and let soup simmer for a little while.

This soup is great!!!!! I used parsley instead of chives and it was fine. Everything the other reviewers say- using a bit more wine, plenty of salt, and different types of mushrooms, is good advice. For the amount of time it takes to prepare this soup (next to none), the results are excellent.

Delicious mushroom soup recipe! Used crimini, shitake, and oyster mushrooms. Also substituted good quality vegetable broth and increased quantity of broth as well as wine. Added a shot of brandy with the wine and a little bit of thyme as well. Pureed half the soup and loved the results. Definitely one for the collection.

We used one pound cremini mushrooms and followed the rest of the recipe with precision including use of canned broth. This soup is lovely simplicity. I would like to make it again using some exotic mushrooms with the creminis, and maybe a better broth. Very good though!

Delicious, flavorful soup! As per previous reviewers, I increased the amount of mushrooms (to 1 lb., using a combination of cremini and white button), and slightly increased the amount of white wine (by ~ 1-2 Tablespoons). Pureeing half the soup produces tasty but visually unappealing results; pureeing 1/4 to 1/3 is a good compromise. Instead of canned chicken stock, I prepared homemade vegetable stock, using the recipe from "Sara Moulton Cooks at Home" - outstanding!

Spectacular soup. I used fresh leeks and crimini mushrooms; cooked a first stage with more green portions of leek, mushroom stems, and some potato and onion, which I then pureed and added back to the main body of the soup (which had the white/light leek plus sliced mushroom caps.) I also substituted dry sherry for the white wine. Everyone raved - fabulous meal.

This is the best mushroom soup I have ever had/made. I used baby bella mushrooms. I ate the first serving "as is", and liked it a lot. For the second serving (the next day...) I followed the advice of another reviewer and I pureed half of the soup: WOW!!! I can't wait to make this again, and I will puree half of it - that's the best! Thanks for the tip!

Made it vegetarian and added a carrot, celery, boiled yellow potatoes. Pureed half the soup. It was wonderful. I love how it doesn't need any heavy cream or milk! Lovely for a rainy winter evening.

Made a vegetarian version that was scrumptious. To add a bit of hardiness, would use 1 pound of cremini and a small package (1 oz.) of dried porcini reconstituted and chopped. The woodiness of the porcini really adds to the depth of this dish!

This is a simple dish that really tastes wonderful. My husband told me to put a star next to it.

Absolutely delicious! I took the advise of the other cooks and doubled the mushrooms. I used a pound of crimini mushroom and a half pound of button mushroom. I also added more broth and wine. It's a keeper at our house.

I never made soup before and luckily for me this turned out to be a very good recipe. Thus, I will try again. It is quite tasty and light. Since the recipe does not specify what type of mushrooms to use, I used half portabello and half shitake. I really enjoyed this!

It's amazing how so few ingredients can produce such a flavorful soup. The key to this soup is getting a good caramelization on the vegetables before adding the wine. I sauteed the leeks and mushrooms a bit longer than the recipe called for and it intensified the flavors beautifully. Next time I will try this with beef broth and red wine.

This was excellent! The only changes I'll try are to replace the wine with sherry and to serve the soup in a sourdough bread bowl.

OH-MY-GOSH!! This soup was out of this world!! Really, really good. I agree with everyone else though, add the extra chicken broth and season well with salt and fresh ground pepper. I will definetly serve this over and over again! A keeper for sure!!

I made this recipe for a holiday dinner and it was very well-recieved. There was not one drop left in the pot. I served it with large homemade croutons. I did find that i had to season it with salt and pepper generously before i got it tasting flavorful. Overall, very good.

Mmmmmmm I tried this on a snowy evening and it was a BIG hit. And this is a great vegan dish as well. I hydrated about 6 dried shitake shrooms and used the resulting broth as a substitution for the chicken broth. I used one large portobello, the hydrated shitakes and button mushrooms. Definately use at least a pound of shrooms. And I used a little over a half cup of wine. Increased the broth as well. It really hit the spot. Hardy yet elegant!! Can be used as a fast and easy weeknight dish OR an elegant first course when entertaining.

I really liked this soup. I used a pound of mushrooms, an extra 1/4 cup wine, and about an extra 1/2 cup broth. What really made this recipe was the added salt (it took plenty) and lots and lots of fresh ground pepper which gave it a real kick. Next time I make it I will also add a third leek. The french bread with it made it a very filling meal.

Awesome!! Standout mushroom flavor and broth. If you are a mushroom lover you must make this. Easy, I love it. Great starter or light lunch. I too doubled the wine and did a full pound of shrooms also. I used button and crimini.

I've made it twice so far and it's a big hit at the house. Satisfying and perfect for mushroom lovers. And the more mushroons you add, the better.

Made this soup with about a pound of mushrooms and liked it, but my wife LOVED it. Next time I'll use the full pound of 'shrooms, but I think I'll add another 1/4 cup of wine and can of broth. Served it with some French bread, and it made a nice, light dinner. Given the time expenditure, it's really a worthwhile dish.

Very good soup. I always add another can of chicken broth, another 1/4 cup of wine and make it with a little more than a pound of mushrooms. It has become a favorite in our house.

Although this soup did have a great flavor, It was a little to much like eating plain broth. I will make it again, but next time I will try stirring in a little cream right before serving. Also you definetly need to increase the mushrooms to 3/4 a pound.

This is a delicious soup with a wonderful broth. We substituted a good quality mushroom broth for the chicken stock and increased the amount of mushrooms.

This is a delicious, easy soup. I, too, added more mushrooms than the recipe calls for and that did the trick. I also used Knorr's vegetable bouillon cubes instead of chicken broth and it was still great. Yum

After tasting this soup, I felt it needed more of a mushroom taste. I then changed the quantities to 3/4 kg mushrooms to 1 litre of chicken stock.Now that's a Mushroom Soup, gloriously flavoured, real comfort food. Will definitely be making this one again.

i have made this soup three times. the broth is simple and delicate. You may want to add more broth to the recipe. I find that works best. Enjoy!
