This was delicious, but I only made a half of a box of shells and the full recipe for the sauce. And it was still not overly saucy.

This is one of our favorite meals. I make only 1 small adjustment. I roast the entire head of garlic but only use about half in the meal.I save the other half and use it the next time I make this or with garlic bread. My main reason for doing this is because I take leftovers for lunch and the garlic would be way too overpowering at work. The dish is fabulous!!

This was a great combination of flavors, but it was filed under the quick weeknight dinners, and with the roasting of the garlic this wasn't quick. I added an extra sausage but stuck to the rest of the recipe exactly. Next time I would reduce the broth by about 1/2 cup because it was a little watery, and I wound up cooking it for too long to try to thicken it, and the beans got really mushy.

I took the reviews to heart and doubled everything except the pasta. Everyone in my family liked it and would eat it again. It did have a texture issue for only one person but he still ate it with more cheese on top.

My whole family enjoyed this. The alterations I made: I used turkey sausage instead of pork. Onion instead of shallot, and more than 1/2 cup. I added diced celery and carrots. I used a 26 oz can of diced tomatoes, NOT drained, and 2 15oz cans of white kidney beans. Only 1.5 cups chicken broth. I would say adding the celery and carrots gave it a lot of extra color and flavor, made it more interesting to eat. Overall, good recipe!

Tasted ok, but needed something to make it worth making again. I didn't care too much for the texture of the beans in the sauce with the pasta--it was a bit grainy. Hearty and easy for a weeknight dinner though.

Stuck to the recipe except used hot italian sausage and a mix of stocks. Delish -- can't wait for leftovers!

Yup, great for me too. Delicious combination of flavors. I agree with some other cooks who say there's a tiny bit too much pasta for the amount of sauce.

I make this dish several times a year, exactly as it is written, and we absolutely adore it. Good for company, and great comfort food.

To quote my husband "this is a keeper!" I prepared the recipe as written, with the addition of browned, sliced zucchini and button mushrooms (about 6 large). We're actually looking forward to the leftovers!

fantastic winter dish and an easy weeknight meal (very little chopping or preparation). the dish is so flavorful - roasting the garlic adds so much flavor. be sure to use good cheese because the broth/sauce is flavored and thickened by it and it is so good!!! the only change i made was to double the recipe as it is one of our favorite family meals.

Delicious! This is now part of our regular rotation of dishes. Easy to make (with some planning ahead for garlic roasting) and wonderful flavor. Be sure to top with quality parmesean

My young daughters are pasta lovers but usually will only eat traditional style dishes...they did however love this dish! I did use a lowfat chicken sausage to reduce the fat content and the love for this dish was still HUGE!

I made this Pasta Last nite it was Delicious. I followed the recipie except i used spicy italian sausage. I wish i had used less pasta though because there wasent enough liquid. Pasta got a lil dry. Next time i may add some Pesto and white wine like some of you suggested.

I was very happy with this recipe, and like another reviewer said--it is substitution friendly. I was craving pasta with beans and sausages, but never had seen it done before. I was thrilled to find that someone had already thought of it for me. This dish came out better than I had hoped. My subs, based on ingredients in the house were: white onion instead of shallots (but I see where shallots would add an extra dimension to the dish); pesto instead of fresh basil; butter beans; fresh Parmesan cheese; and curly parsley. Oh, I also used a funky new pasta made from beans(!) and corn--that's why I wanted to try some dish with beans. It tastes good, but immediately collapses and lumps. Guess it would be better for some sort of baked casserole?

Really enjoyed this one! I was a bit surprised how much we ended up liking it. Once you start eating and get your head around the idea that its supposed to be a mellow, yet-robust, peasant-type dish, youll love it! It will become part of our regular rotation. Easy to make, and adaptable to things on hand. We had hot Italian sausage, no fresh herbs or scallions (just yellow onions), and I didnt have time to roast garlic. Nevertheless, with deep carmelization of the yellow onion, and more olive oil than called for, it turned out to be a really pleasant surprise for a busy familys happy-that-its-the-end-of-the-week meal. Ill admit that Im a bit of a food snob (a former New Yorker), so, while Im sure roasting the garlic would add a wonderful dimension, and shallots are always divine, I must say that theres no need not to make this dish just because you dont have these things on hand (or the time). I would also contradict previous reviewers regarding the use of white wine: it would, in my humble opinion, add a certain note that really doesnt go with the spirit of this dish. Obviously people can do what they want, but I think that those who dont like this dish (as well as those who add wine) are trying to make this into something else.

This was good, but the recipe on this site for Pasta with Sausage, Tomatoes and Mushrooms is a better pasta-Italian sausage recipe in my book. I doubled the amount of sausage in this recipe, which helped, but it still felt like it was lacking something. Perhaps a good recipe for people who don't like mushrooms? So, yeah, I liked it okay but I won't make it again.

i love this dish. I improvise a bit on the quantity of the ingredients but it has been great every single time.

Used 1/2 dry white wine and 1/2 chicken broth; as well as fresh basil and parsley..with a cup or so of fresh spinach, more or less for color. 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes was fine and 3/4 lb of rotini was plenty. I happened to have about a pound of sausage so I used it all. Forgiving dish...be creative.

The past reviews really helped me to flavor this up a bit. I used about 3/4 pound of sausage and wished there were more. Also added one diced yellow pepper and a half a diced fennel bulb, just because they needed using up. Doubled the pepper flakes (maybe overdid that a bit) and was generous with the parley, basil, and cheese. Agree that you don't need a pound of pasta--I used 9 or 10 ounces and was glad. Otherwise, you will need more liquid and that would dilute the flavor. The result was tasty and satisfying. Didn't have white wine on hand, so just used the chicken broth, but also didn't drain the tomatoes. I think you need that tomato juice for flavor. I think the yellow pepper and fennel really added needed flavor to this dish, and I will make it again. Easy prep and I didn't have to go to the grocer for anything!

I expected a superb pasta dinner after reading the reviews. It was good, but not great. Something is missing but I can't figure it out. I made it exactly as listed. I'll make some changes and if the end result is spectacular, I'll post the changes to this recipe.

This was absolutely delicious! Great recipe for a quick dinner, our family throughly enjoyed it. Followed the recipe almost as written, with some minor adjustments as recommend by other reviews. Used 1/2 lb pasta, 1 1/2 cups of white wine, 1 1/2 cups chicken stock. This recipe is defintely a "Keeper"!

I thought this was a fabulous way to do sausage and pasta. My husband loved it. I did not drain the tomatoes and took the advice of other reviewers and used a little white wine. I also used whole wheat pasta, and the nutty flavor went with this dish well.

I made this pasta sauce for my fiance last night in an effort not to just cook the same old tired spaghetti, and it turned out fabulous. I added some cayenne pepper to spice it up even more, and used spicy italian turkey sausage, and whole wheat pasta. Fabulous and so easy!

My family enjoys this recipe. It is one of their favorites. I also found the end result to be dry, so I add 3 cups of chicken broth.

I don't usually rate recipes that I don't really like but I thought this was very medeocre. I used half white wine, half broth, took some suggestions at leaving out some of the pasta, also added more red pepper flakes, basil and parsley and also added chicken breast pieces dry rubbed with onion and garlic salt, and still, lacked flavor and interest.

I thought this was very good - my only suggestion is to be careful not to reduce too much or it's dry (or add less pasta). Also, add the beans toward the end of the reduction time or they become mushy.

To the previous reviewer: Who said anything about soup???

Rating: 3
1lb of Pasta is way too much unless you expect to cut it with a knife and eat it with a fork. 1/4 cup is about right. You can't reduce the soup by half by simmering 20 min. nor would you want to if you really want soup! 1/2 half oz does not equal 1/4 cup. 2 oz will get you there. Other than those obvious glitches, it's easy to make and delicious. I especially like the sausage!

This recipe is great and so easy! The flavors work really well, the beans add great texture. I might suggest that more parsley and basil would help, but that may be because I love fresh herbs. I also added salt to the sauce, but I had used a low sodium stock initially. If any reviewers have any idea about how this recipe could be jazzed up or tweaked to make it even better, I'd love to hear!

A really great dish, and not hard at all! Next time I'll be using the white wine and also add a little more sausage. Didn't have any shallots around, but my yellow onion did the trick nicely. Destined to be a weekly favorite at our dinner table!

Had this dish tonight at friends' home. My husband and I loved it. I'll definitely prepare it for us and probably for guests, as well. I think the substitution of white wine for some of the chicken broth would be a good idea.

This was good, but nothing spectacular. The flavors were better the next day. Makes a quick and easy weeknight meal if you roast the garlic ahead of time.

My whole family loved this recipe! I took a cue and used 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup white wine. I certainly wouldn't omit the roasted garlic. Definitely will make again.

This is a great recipe. When I first read it, it sounded a little mundane. But once my partner and I tasted it, we were both amazed. I broke my "no seconds" rule and had another helping. Oh well -- I'll walk the dog tonight.

My experience was completely different, and I thought it was almost inedible. The beans with the pasta just didn't work.

Since my family likes hot, I used hot chicken sausage and a heavy dose of red pepper flakes. Next time I will replace a cup of the broth with white wine and given the simplicity and flavour of this dish, the next time will be very soon.

One of the best things I've eaten lately. Like the cook from Los Angeles, I couldn't put my fork down! I omitted the sauteed garlic (I try to appease sensitive palates, ie. kids) and totally spaced on the basil. Guess what's on the menu Chez Whirl next week? =)

Excellent and very easy dish to prepare. I used rotini and only so-so parmesan but it was still very good. Also, I forgot to buy shallots so I substituted a little sliced yellow onion.
