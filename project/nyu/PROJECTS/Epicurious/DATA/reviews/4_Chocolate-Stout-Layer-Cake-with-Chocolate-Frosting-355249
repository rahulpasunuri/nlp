This is a very unique cake, so I love making it for special occasions. Surprisingly, it is not as sweet as most cakes, but it is still very rich and delicious, plus I prefer cakes that taste like something other than sugar. Sometimes I use instant coffee instead of instant espresso powder for the icing, which I make BEFORE THE CAKE. If the icing isn't setting properly, I just put it in the fridge for up to 30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes. For the coffee, I often make an americano (espresso + water), but it is important not to make the coffee too strong, otherwise the flavor is overwhelming! Unlike other reviewers, this case has never come out dry for me, it is always very moist. I am not a huge fan of really rich chocolate, though, so I sometimes use lighter chocolate to give it a slightly lighter, slightly sweeter flavor.

I can't even give it a one fork. The cake was so dry and crumbled all over the place. Couldn't even stick a fork in it that it wouldn't crumble. After 2 pieces my husband and I both agreed it was time for the trash bin.

Made this two weeks ago for a gathering and it was an absolute hit! Making it again for my hubby's birthday at his request. Both the cake and frosting are easy to make. I think this is now my go to chocolate cake :)

Loved this cake! Very moist and the frosting was delicious. Noting another reviewer had said their cake turned out dry, I decided to check mine about 25 minutes in. It was a good thing I had because one was done and the other needed just a couple more minutes! I also second the reviewer that said this cake made a mess: it did!

Loved this recipe! Probably the best chocolate cake I've ever made.The icing is what makes it--rich, and deeply chocolatey. Icing definitely needs time in the fridge to set up, but after 2 hours mine was perfect for icing. My cake did not come out dry at all, but I could see how even an extra couple of minutes in the oven could make it dry. A keeper for sure.

Love this! Amazing rich flavor with the stout as a base. The icing is excellent, when you have a craving for chocolate, especially cake, this one beats all!

Delicious. Rich. Worth the effort. Messy to make. Followed exactly. Subtle stout flavor. Better next day. MMmmm.

Made this cake with a mocha mascarpone frosting. I still kept the bittersweet chocolate as the middle layer. It was for a friend's birthday, and everyone raved about it! The cake is not as dense as the usual chocolate cake (take the extra step of whipping in the egg whites). Also used a double chocolate stout and kept the remaining beer to serve with the cake. Will definitely make again.

rich chocolate cake without being overly sugary and sweet. i couldn't find chocolate stout but did find lagunitas cappuchino stout which enhanced the coffee chocolate flavor in the cake which was very nice. i mixed 50/50 semi and bitter sweet chocolate for the frosting since some kids would be eating it as well and was worried the bitter would be too much for them. i liked the blend and gave it a nice balance to the cake.

This recipe makes a wonderful cake. There are quite a few steps, so this isn't a cake I would pick to throw together at the last minute. I followed the recipe exactly though and it came out like a cake at a fancy restaurant. I will definately make again for birthdays and special occasions and I'm thinking about trying to make a mocha cream cheese frosting for some variety. From reading through the reviews, I think most of the people who had problems changed the recipe or substituted an ingredient. For example, using 80% cacao or vegan chocolate or halfing the recipe and using the wrong sized pan all seemed to create problems.

I love to cook but I've never been much of a baker... I was charged with baking a chocolate cake for my wife's birthday and she does not like very sweet pastries etc. to make a long story short I followed the recipe to a tee and it was phenomenal. I am making it for the second time because it was so popular. It is not particularly difficult but the results are outstanding. As usual preparation is the key. My cake was not visually outstanding but still tasted great. I did use cake flour cause I had it on hand not sure if the results will differ. Good luck!!!!!

I made this for my husband's birthday and boy was it a hit. I topped it with caramelized bacon (recipe found on epicurious, too). The cake was incredibly moist and dense. Per our local craft beer store owner's suggestion, I use an extra dry Guiness stout for baking. I made some cupcakes, too, which cooked in about 10-12 minutes- if you'd like to have more of a beer flavor, cupcakes are the way to go, as the reduced cooking time left the cake tasting more like the stout - in a good way.

Flavor was same as the slice eaten at Barrington Brewery! Hunted for a recipe online & found several that were identical, except for the addition of the expresso, which the Brewery does NOT add to their cake. I WANT TO SHARE A COUPLE MISTAKES I MADE: 1. My cake came out too dry. It should be dense, & slightly moist. I halved the recipe & used a 10" spring pan. The toothpick wasn't clean after 35 mins (no surprise as I poured all the batter into this one pan) So I baked 5 mins more but still not quite clean. Instead of checking cake after 1 more min, I set the timer for another 5 mins, when the cake likely needed just 1 more min! So lesson learned! 2. FROSTING: Never got thickened all the way (wrong chocolate used? recipe says nothing about brands to use/avoid. I used a bar of Godiva 80% cacao bittersweet plus semi-sweet vegan morsels = great flavor!) BUT I heated the cream past the point of simmer (by accident). There is no warning about heating past simmer in the recipe but I think this is reason for my problem. OR perhaps chilling in a non-metal bowl hurt the thickening ability? (again, no mention in recipe) Ganache is new to me, so not sure & only guessing here. Some recipes say to pour hot cream over the chocolate & wait one minute. Is this a key factor missing in this recipe? So, more info needed about mixing the cream & chocolate, & whether to whip/mix/beat once thickened or do nothing. Mine still not thick after 8 hrs so used freezer so something not right. So, gave up, frosted cake & put in fridge overnite. Delicious today, but cake a bit too dry & icing should be bit thicker to duplicate Brewery cake I ate. Will try again & hope I have better luck with lessons learned by trial!

I just baked this cake, but halved the recipe and baked in a 10" spring pan and it fit perfectly! I'm troubled by the frosting, however. I've looked at this recipe all over the internet and all are the same, except for the expresso, which I omitted as I don't care for coffee flavorings. I used 2 cups whipping cream and 1 lb (weighed with scaleL) BUT the frosting is still a bit too thin. What on earth is wrong; many here and elsewhere say their frosting got too THICK! How could this be? I used a broken up bar of Godiva 80% cacao bittersweet chocolate, and vegan semi-sweet choc morsels. Someone please tell me what I did wrong! I ate a piece of this cake at Barrington Brewery & Pub last weekend, and their keep the cake out under a glass dome. There is no way my frosting will be able to be kept out like that; it's not nearly as thick as the frosting on the cake last week. Tks for any suggestions. I will put the bowl of frosting in the freezer for a bit. Could it be that I used a small pyrex mixing bowl rather than metal? Is it the chocolate I used?

Made this for my brother-in-law's birthday party. After reading the previous reviews, I decided to use milk chocolate for the frosting. Although it tasted fantastic, the frosting took MUCH longer to firm up enough to spread. We used the Highland Black Mocha Stout. The beer imparted a subtle flavor that complimented the chocolate and coffee flavor beautifully. It also helped the rise and texture in the cake. It was definitely a fantastic, and unique birthday dessert. Perfect for any beer lover, especially with the Stout Floats on the side.

Made this recipe for Valentine's Day with Rogue's Mocha Porter. Ever since then (over 6 months later), every time I smell a porter or stout, I CRAVE this cake. I finally broke down and made it again today, this time with Rogue's Chocolate Stout. Equally as heavenly and to die for. One of my all time favorite cakes.

Loved this cake. Made a few substitutions. Used milk chocolate in batter because I didn't buy unsweetened chocolate at the store and the batter tasted fine. For beer, I used a black butte porter. I thought the flavor was great.I loved the frosting but family didn't like the bittersweet chocolate. Next time I will use a sweeter chocolate for frosting.

Made this cake for a birthday. The cake is very good with a light spongy texture...almost a sponge cake. I would make the cake again and possibly in a bundt pan. The frosting on the other hand is another story. I used the Trader Joe's pound plus for the 16oz of choc. for the frosting. That is a alot of chocolate. The recipe recommends chilling the frosting for about 2 hrs. stirring occasionally. At the 1hr. stir I could barely move the whisk the chocolate had solidified so much. I removed the frosting from the fridge and the cakes where still slighty warm so with some coaxing I was able to frost the entire layer cake. It was a good thing I put the candles in ahead of time, right after the frosting job. A few hours later those candles were cemented into the solidified "frosting". The frosting does melt in your mouth rather like a rich chocolate bar. The cake certainly had a hard candy coating. The frosting is so rich and chocolate bar like that it is difficult to eat very much of it.

this recipe has become standard fare in my house, on 3/17, and I've always gotten great compliments. Thank you for publishing this recipe! Refrigerate after serving, one year I left the cake,in a cake-keeper on my hutch, it got little mold-spots all over it, and I unfortunately had to toss about ¾ of the cake (that was a sad moment!) I've never had trouble keeping it in the fridge. my family devours it quickly. the frosting is yummy;rich like a super-soft & creamy fudge

I made cupcakes with this recipe. It didn't taste very strongly of chocolate, and the cupcakes looked shriveled after they cooled. Probably a stronger stout would have helped the flavor. The frosting improved the final result, but I won't be making this cake again.

Made this cake yesterday for my husband's birthday. I only used about 1/2 of the icing and did add a little confectioner's sugar to the icing. We all really liked this cake. It was dense and moist and it looked great. I used chocolate stout which really came through. It was delicious. My kids (5 and 8) really liked it too. The cake looked beautiful, and the batter was the perfect amount for my two pans. I will definitely make again. We tried with stout last night as the recipe suggested, but enjoyed it more with a cold glass of milk.

I think everyone that has commented about having too much batter is using the wrong pans. If you use the correct size, the amount of batter is correct. I wasn't even close to having too much. I used a cheap 'double chocolate stout' for this, and the beer can absolutely be tasted in the cake. I hate beer, but I still liked the flavor in this cake.

I loved this recipe. I did not make any changes to the cake's recipe but modified the frosting -as recommended by sarahp8 - i.e. add 5oz semi-sweet chocolate. I think any stout would work for this recipe, so I would not fret too much about specifically going for the chocolate stout.

holy crap! this is so good! i will say that i was concerned about the richness of the cake and dark chocolate frosting...so, i used 11oz of 60% chips, and 5 oz of semi sweet for the frosting. make this cake!

This cake is amazing. I really love the flavor, and the combination of the frosting and cake was absolutely perfect. I definitely suggest measuring everything out ahead of time and making sure that everything is ready to go to incorporate. (I beat the eggs and sugar first and put them in the fridge so I could just fold them in when I needed to, instead of beating them when the recipe called for it.) That having been said, I will be making it again. Actually, I HAVE to make it again, because I went by the suggestion of some of the reviews that this recipe made too much batter and there were leftovers. So I halved the recipe and wound up with a two-layer cake that is about an inch and a half tall. (I used two 8" round cake pans.) Not exactly an exciting birthday cake. So I'm making it again tonight--the whole recipe--and fully expect it to come out perfect this time.

Like other people here I halved the recipe and still had enough to make two cakes. I ended up adding all of the egg whites in one go and folding them in before putting it in the oven. The effect produced a very light, fluffy cake with even air pockets.

This.is a terrific cake! Half a recipe made two 8" cakes for layering. Too much batter to make 3 8"layers as recipe states. My family kept eyeing the leftovers and tried to be polite about wishing for the last piece.

Awesome! Used my friends home brewed Chocolate Hazelnut Porter. Was scared that cake was going to be dry, but it was very moist. Pulled out of oven 10 minutes early. Only used half the frosting. Next morning I microwaved a slice and it was very similar to a molten cake.

This cake is delicious and straightforward. I made it for a birthday party. Rather than do a layer cake, I baked it in a 9x13 pan then cut some of the cake to shape it like a glass of Guinness. I halved the icing recipe and used whipped cream for the "foam". Also, I didn't have the adjust the baking time for the larger pan. It seems like this cake recipe is adaptable and would be well-received in any crowd. I'll definitely make it again, maybe as a layer cake next time since the frosting is wonderful!

Very moist & flavorful cake, & the frosting is spectacular & very simple! I adjusted the liquids a bit to tone down the coffee flavor & bring out the stout; try 1 cup of chocolate stout & 1/3 cup strong coffee. I also used unsalted butter by accident, & the batter tasted fine. A good grown-up birthday cake for someone who likes things that aren't too sweet but still quite rich.

I also cut this recipe in half (though it's hard to cut 3 eggs in half, so I used 2 eggs, which made for a light fluffy cake). This recipe combines 3 of my favorite foods: chocolate, beer and coffee. I LOVED this cake because it was moist, dark and not too sweet, but I didn't love the frosting. I think the frosting needs to be a little sweeter with no coffee to juxtapose the lack of sweetness in the cake, and to intensify the chocolate taste, which gets a little lost.

Great texture, moist and not too sweet. The best chocolate cake recipe I've found yet. I love the beer-y flavor. I substituted Newcastle brown ale, Cocoa powder with heavy cream, and Turkish coffee with the grounds. Definitely a keeper.

This is an excellent chocolate cake that is not too sugary sweet. I made a half recipe - just one cake round - and cut in in half to make a 2-layer 1/2 circle cake. This worked out well since this is a very rich cake. Also, I didn't have instant espresso powder for the frosting so just added a little strong coffee and still loved it.

I am on the fence on this recipe. I used a good chocolate stout but didn't notice the taste come thru and my icing was really runny. I made the salted caramel ice cream to go with it. Very happy I did. One of my guests took the rest of the cake so I guess they weren't on the fence about it.

This was a great cake for the chocoholics in my family. The cake tasted almost brownie-like and the frosting was rich. I used dark chocolate throughout and I took other reviewers suggestions and only made 2 cake layers [2/3 of batter] with the full frosting. Delicious.

After reading other reviews, I subbed dark chocolate for the frosting and used bittersweet chocolate for the cake. I used a Rogue Chocolate Stout beer and man this cake was gobbled up! The egg whites kept it from being too dense and the switch in chocolates gave it a sweet, but not overly sweet taste..very grown up. The beer was perfect in this dish and gave a wonderful flavor to the cake. Make this with the rest of the menu for an Oktoberfest party for 12 and it got rave reviews. Will make again for sure!

I loved this cake and the frosting. The frosting was also incredibly easy to work with, smooth, thick, creamy and not too sweet.

This is a very grown-up chocolate cake -not the cake from childhood that is sticky gooey-sweet. It's also a heavy, rich cake with a not-sweet ganache. All in all, this was not my favorite cake. I don't think my family will finish this one off. To be fair, though, I think we prefer a sweeter, more traditional cake.

This looks amazing, so I plan to make it, but wanted to comment on the last review saying that 8" pans were too small. The recipe DID say to use 9" pans and even mentioned that they need to be 1-1/2" tall. Most bake ware sold at the stores is not that tall, so if you don't have "professional" quality pans, be careful of overflow.

Rating: 3
Loved the flavor of this cake! Unfortunately, I had some trouble. My cake layers overflowed all over the oven - maybe 9" pans would work better? Also, I had some trouble spreading the frosting so we just decided that it was "rustic". But, my guests loved the flavor. Cut small pieces - it's VERY rich.
