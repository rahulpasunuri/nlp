Be careful of adding too much hot sauce. I added a couple teaspoons sweet pickle juice as I found the recipe not sweet enough..(guess I am used to the bottled variety) Good texture...I chopped everything very finely even the capers. The egg is definitely needed in my opinion, gives the dressing depth. All in all a very good dressing, not worth 4 stars (it has to be FANTASTIC, BEST I EVERY HAD to warrant 4 stars for me)

This is so yummy and full of texture, and not too sweet and gummy like the bottled version. I used lowfat mayo and also added one small gherkin.

This thousand island dressing and salad made a tasty quick lunch. I had to skip the egg and use less onion since I ran out, but I will try the remaining dressing with them later in the week. I had homemade chili sauce in place of the regular bottled sauce, used 1 T mustard, and did not drain the capers.

This was wonderful! I made reubens, and I did not want to buy thousand island dressing because the organic was too expensive and the others had hydrogenated oils. This was SO easy and made for a very delicious dressing. I did not add the pimentos, and I added a little extra pickle juice (2 T) to add vinegar and extra flavor. I also added about 3T of brown sugar, and I did include the egg. It is smooth, creamy, and delicious! Next time, I will make it with plain yogurt instead of mayo since there is so much flavor in the ingredients. Consider planning two meals around this dressing and keep it in a Good Seasons cruet. Maybe crispy romaine salad one day, reubens another, and an avocado tomato and chicken salad another...it is so good you will want to use it all up!

Throw away the bottle dressing, this is fantastic! I was very leary of the egg but I decided to give it a chance. I loved the texture it gave. I think without it, the dressing would be more of a Come Back Sauce. I cannot wait to serve along with a steak.

Because I didn't have all the ingrediates, I had to make a few substitues. I used light mayo and less than the recipe listed. The addition of the capers was awesome. My husband did not know he wass eating Thousand Island Dressing, which he hates! He wants me to make this recipe again.

Had crab louies last night and added lemon to this recipe. I love crab.... really dislike 1,000 island dressing. So looked for something new and found this. It was SO GOOD. Mom, a fellow 1,000 island dressing hater also loved it. Dad still liked his sweet pickle & ketchup variety-he's on his own. I will definitely make again.

I made this recipe as written including the hard-boiled egg, which I liked, but did not have pimento. Still authentic. The dressing is not exceptional-it's Thousand Island- but good for what it is. My husband found it nostalgic. Certainly a good accompaniment to an old fashioned steakhouse meal or roasted chicken sandwiches.

I am not a fan of 1000 Island dressing at all. I *never* eat it at home, and never order it in restaurants. But for some reason tonight as I was searching for a new salad recipe for a very hot summer day, this sounded good. But it was more than just good. It is amazing. Wonderful. Tangy & tasty. Holy wow! I loved the chunks of capers & pickles. I used whole grain dijon, chives instead of green onion (as suggested by another reviewer) and skipped the eggs at my husbad's request. I will make this for my friends and family for the rest of our lives. Triple yum!

Perfect every time! I do omit the chopped egg though. We make this often, great as a dip for veggies too!

Thousand Islands dressing is such a guilty pleasure and this recipe is wonderful. Sometimes, I leave out the chopped egg.

Served this delicious dressing at a dinner party and have been dipping various and sundry items in it since then (crudites, pretzles, fingers). Yum.

This is so good and definitely my husband's favorite. I follow the recipe 'cept for fresh chives for the onion. A child of the 60's, I loved my mother's homemade Thousand Island - served on iceberg wedges, of course. But this is way better, with the tang of dijon, dill pickles and capers!!! Tonight we had it on ribbons of crunchy romaine with sliced radishes and cherry tomato halves. More tender lettuces do not hold up to the body of this dressing.

When I was a child, I loved Dorothy Lynch dressing. When I grew up, bottled dressings never 'hit my spot', and were always so chemical tasting to me. So, my idea of a Kraft of Wishbone Thousand Island was pretty pathetic. Then, a friend had this recipe made to dress her fresh grilled tuna sandwich on sliced ciabatta bread with delicious greens and slices of radishes. Oh be still my pounding heart! What a flavor and what a great compliment to the tuna. Since then, I have made this myself and love it with fish, but also on salads, vegetables, and thin slices of leg of lamb, some havarti, and mixed greens in a pita.. oh man! What a wonderful sandwich!

Don't want to be a spoilsport, but I have been making the 1000 Island dressing from the Pillsbury Kitchen Cookbook for the last 20 years, and this just has way too much mustard in it. Actually, why is mustard in it at all? I think I will stick with the tried and true favorite.

Great salad dressing! I left out the chopped egg and added fresh lemon juice to taste. My family really enjoyed the kick that the chili sauce imparted.

Great dressing & have always added lemon juice for Louie salad. Out of capers but still delicious. Used juice from half large lemon. Huge mound of sweet tiny shrimp, thinly sliced bermuda, pickled beets & avocado. Tossed some endive w/romaine & freshly made sourdough garlic croutons. Perfect.

We love the poached chicken salad at Kenwood Grill in Kenwood, CA. We replicated it and made this Thousand Island dressing they serve on the side and it was perfect! We have made it several times as is and wouldn't change a thing!

Delicious! Just the right amount of tang ... not too sweet. I'll never use bottled again...

I was looking for a Thousand Island dressing recipe for Rueben sandwiches and the minimal effort to make this dressing raised these Reubens to another level. This used to be my favorite dressing at a restaurant I frequented years ago, but the bottled dressings are plain awful. This dressing is as good as or even better than what I used to crave. My husband doesn't want me to ever buy a bottled dressing again. It is that good!

A+++. I have not had Thousand Island dressing in years, but this recipe is a delicious keeper. I served it over iceberg lettuce wedges, topped with choped tomatoes and crisp bacon. To make a great presentation, chill the plates and forks in the freezer.

I enjoyed this more as a sauce for crab cakes than for a salad dressing, but I am not much of a thousand island dressing eater.

Great dressing! It is easy to make (I used Hellman's "Just 2 Good", in place of regular mayo, with no problems, and has great flavor. The hot pepper sauce comes through more strongly next day, so take into consideration. (Still really yummy! I may have to run out for some corned beef and rye...)

This dressing is fantastic. I served it over wedges of iceberg I made it to complement an upscale comfort food Sunday night dinner: turkey meatloaf and maple and tangerine glazed carrots, both from this site. I also served orzo with butter and fresh parsley. The meal made it a bit easier to face the work week.

I love this recipe, the flavor is so great. The simplicity is a beautiful thing. Everyone who tastes this wants the recipe. No more store bought thousand island for this household!

This dressing is so good that I could eat it by the spoonful!! Our Shrimp Louies were a huge hit with all the guests - sitting out on the patio on a beautiful, cloudless day and a divine lunch, thanks to Epicurious.com. You HAVE to try this one to believe it like I did!!

This is an absolutely fantastic dressing and so good on sandwiches. It's very easy to prepare, looks great, and tastes divine. Have no idea how long it lasts in the frig, because in my house, it isn't around very long.

THIS IS AN AWESOME RECIPE, NOT ONLY IS IT TANGY, BUT ALSO PRESENTS WELL. I ALSO ADDED A FEW MORE DROPS OF CHILI SAUCE AND HOT PEPPER SAUCE TO ADD MORE SPICE. RAVE REVIEWS FROM EVERYONE. ALSO USED ON CRAB CAKES WITH EXCELLENT RESULTS.

Not ONLY is this salad delicious, but it is impressive to look at, and so very simple to make. I have now said goodbye to store bought 1000 Island dressing--it is wonderful as the dressing on Reuben sandwiches, as well as the dressing for tuna and egg salad sandwiches--even as the drssing for potato and pasta salad. Every time I use it, I get requests for the recipe. It has become one of my "stand-by" recipes.

We love this recipe! It's much more than just a salad dressing. It's especially good with crab cakes and fish. I've made it often; it's become a "standard" in our house.

This recipe is great!! I make it on a regular basis. Sometimes I add crumbled blue or feta cheese for variety. This recipe freezes well, so if you have some left over, you can save it.

We actually used this recipe for corned beef sandwiches on rye. The dressing is great. I used sweet relish because I was being nice and deferring to my husbands old-fashioned tastes. We too kicked it up with more hot sauce. The result was surprisingly good. A nice mix of sweet and spicy!

This isn't your everyday thousand island. It is a wonderful adaptation that seems to deserve a more upscale name. I added quite a few splashes of tobasco because, like Emeril, I like to kick it up a few notches! I added some hard boiled eggs and croutons to the salad. It was wonderful and I would certainly serve this dish to guests.
