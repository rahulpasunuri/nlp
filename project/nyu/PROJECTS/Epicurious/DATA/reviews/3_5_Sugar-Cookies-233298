Not sure why so many people have trouble with this... I use Silpat baking sheets, and that is definitely a help. I also lightly flour the door before each roll. Dough rolled out perfectly, even with just a few minutes in the freezer (be sure to put in refrigerator between rolls). No, they are not that sweet, but that is how roll out cookies are supposed to be. But they were flaky and delicate, but tough enough to roll easily roll to a 1/4 inch and still not break.

This was my stand-by sugar cookie recipe for years (sorry my tasters have now voted it out for a Martha Stewart one) but its really good recipe. The technique is really important and if you can get these right it will make you a better baker. I wouldn't suggest frosting these cookies. Just a little sugar for that satisfying crunch. Also I suggest starting with highest quality butter you can get and brand new flour. Fancy vanilla won't hurt either.

Loved this cookie recipe. Subtle sweetness and buttery. I followed the recipe exactly. Dough might've a touch dry but held up well to multiple roll-outs by the kids. Will definitely make again.

A very unmemorable sugar cookie. My biggest issue is that was very bland. Texture was just ok. I will not be making this one again.

We enjoyed these cookies. My daughter is allergic to egg, so we used pear baby food in its place. We also used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, to try to make the cookies a little more nutritious! Two babies, a toddler and their mommies all agreed that these were easy and tasty.

Thin, brittle, crispy, flavorless cookies. Icing is sweet but not tasty. Will not make these again.

Golden standard for cut outs any time of the year. Sometimes I use a little lemon zest to flavor. Make sure you use the finest butter you can get your hands on.

We made these cookies in lieu of valentine's cards for Sam's classmates. His class is doing a unit on writing reviews, so we thought we'd post one. The dough was easy to make. It was really hard to keep together when we were rolling it out and transferring it to the cookie sheet. After the cookie is baked, the taste is good and it is really easy to decorate. We might explore other sugar cookie recipes in the future before making this again.

These were really good. They hold up pretty well when decorating. Not one of the 12 large Snowmen I made broke. I will keep this as a favorite.

This is a recipe for an old fashion sugar cookie. It is more like a butter cookie. The cookies don't plump up at all and don't taste very good. I am sorry I picked this recipe to make holiday cookies with my husband for the first time. I guess they do look like the picture, but I love sweet fluffy sugar cookies. I did not like.

Best sugar cookie recipe I ever tried! Made these tonight with my 5 yr old and they were perfect - held their shape when baked, didn't puff too much, just the right texture, slightly crisp but not too much. This is my new standard sugar cookie recipe. Added a small pinch of cardamom and used cream cheese frosting. Perfection!

These made GREAT cut out sugar cookies. I tweaked per comments, used 1 c. sugar, used vanilla and lemon extract, and did 1 stick butter and 1/4 c. reg. Crisco. rolled between wax paper (didn't need extra flour to roll), and didn't need to refrigerate. Dough was a tad dry so added a little (1/8-1/4 c.)heavy cream until right consistency. They were not too sweet and rolled perfect. Super easy and very tasty!

Fantastic. I needed a stiff dough that would hold up and not rise too much when baked, these were great for the button cookies I prepared! Great flavor as well.

I got great compliments both times I made these cookies. Rolling between wax paper works great and no floury mess! I chilled as needed while rolling and before baking. The seccond batch I made I used 1/2 vanilla & 1/2 almond extractand loved the flavor!

I'm pretty lukewarm about these. On the one hand the taste was really good. They were not overly sugary like store bought ones. Just a very pleasant lightly sweet taste. On the other hand I hated the texture. It came out too hard and dry. Maybe I over worked the dough, but really I followed the recipe exactly. Mine did not rise at all and remained flat and a little sad looking. Good tasting, but sad looking. I did not have the same problem rolling these out though. Lightly sprinkling some flour on top of the dough might help rolling it, or putting some parchment paper between the dough and rolling pin. Sadly, I think this is one I'm going to pass on in the future.

I just read all these reviews. I have been making these cookies for years. The only change I make is to roll out the dough between two sheets of parchement paper and then freeze until they are hard enough to cut shapes. Get them right into the oven and bake for exactly 10 minutes. They are great. I am always being asked to bring these to every function and they are the first thing to sell out at bake sales. I always use the royal icing recipe that comes with it. Beautiful.

great recipe! i added chopped fresh lavender and a little bit of honey and they came out great. not too sugary like some store bought cookies. this was my first time making my own cookie dough and it was surprisingly easy, especially given that i had none of the standard baking equipment. i beat the butter and sugar by hand and used a pint glass to roll the dough, which i let chill overnight in the fridge. cookies came out perfectly despite all my alterations and lack of machinery!

I did not experience the same issue as other reviewers. Put in the freezer for 30 minutes, rolled out, cut out, and baked, but I did have to work quickly. It did take my right back to childhood...lovely recipe.

I also added a teaspoon of lemon extract because i love lemon sugar cookies. i put the whole batch of dough in a freezer bag and rolled it out then chilled it. i cut apart the bag and used a juice glass to cut them in circles. they were thicker than this recipe suggested, but have that tender crisp texture, perfect balance. i served them with lavender ice cream, and i feel like a very creative hostess:) really tasty because there isn't any shortening or baking soda. totally suggest the lemon extract, way good.

Well I prepared the dough and chilled it for an hour. Took the dough out and tried to roll it. It was extremely hard to work with and crumbled to pieces. I don't know what happened bc I followed everything exactly. I used to make cookies like these when I was younger with my Mom- we never had this problem. I only wish I could find her recipe... this one is not so good :-(

Rating: 0
Everything seemed all right, but when I started to roll out it, the dough was more difficult to work with than other sugar cookie recipes I have used in the past. It was really sticky. I like how basic and natural the recipe is, but I think I will find one that is more workable.

I made these as cut-outs for Easter and they were a really good, basic sugar cookie with none of the bitter flavor that sugar cookies made with baking soda can have. And I wanted a butter-based cookie for the great flavor(not a crisco-based one)so this recipe was just right. I made the dough and divided it into two disks, then rolled out each disk between sheets of wax paper to the desired thickness and chilled the dough on a flat surface. Using this method avoids using flour to roll out the dough, which can leave flour marks on the cookies, and makes rolling easier because it is done while the dough is soft and pliable. The best part: no big,floury mess to clean up afterward. Yesss. TIP If you happen to end up with some cookies that are a little thicker than others, I suggest putting the thicker ones in the corners of the cookie sheet and on the edges as these areas seem to bake faster than the interior areas of a cookie sheet.

We made this recipe for our class Valentine's Day cookies, with no icing or sprinkles per the teacher. I increased sugar to 1 cup, and increased butter to 1 3/4. Both 3 and 5 year olds had no trouble rolling and cutting, dough is super easy to handle. I thought the cookies came out really well, and plan to use this recipe again for the next holiday! (a few sugar sprinkles wont make them too sweet, either.)

These were the perfect cut out sugar cookies. I made the most wonderful christmas cut out cookies with this recipe and everyone just loved it. The dough is a bit crumbly when first mixed but after chilled for an hour and then neaded a bit..it was fabulous!

This turned out great! The cookies hardly spread, and puffed just right. After the time in the freezer (rolled out ready to cut) the dough was easy to manipulate. We also used the icing recipe to great success. Will definitely make these again!

Just not a very exciting sugar cookie recipe. I thought they were kind of bland without frosting. I've had better.

Too much like shortbread and not at all like a cookie. They were also quite bland even with the icing. We threw these away.

These are yummy! This cookie is very much like a short bread and has a classic sugar cookie flavor. I substituted fructose for the sugar which may have made it a little sweeter than sugar would. I also substituted whole wheat pastry flour for the flour which gives a little nuttier taste. I baked at 325 for 14 minutes because my oven runs a little warm. I only got a dozen cookies on my first batch so I guess I wasn't rolling thin enough. I rolled the dough out in between layers of wax paper but it still stuck pretty quickly when it began to warm up. My husband and my three- year-old gave them the thumbs up!

I tried these for Halloween cookies and they turned out great. Easy to roll and cut, crispy but not hard or crumbly, not too sweet (since you're going to ice them anyway). One batch made 30 medium-sized cutouts.

Classic sugar cookie recipe. I would recommend rollingthe dough flat before chilling it. After cutting the very cold dough, put them sirectly into the oven. They have the perfect crispness when done and they hold their shape beautifully. I am asked to make them for every occasion. I've never eaten them without lemon tinted royal icing - maybe that's why they don't seem "dull" or "bland" to me...

Rating: 3
I made the dough a day ahead and THEN read the other disappointing reviews...I was worried! While the dough was a little difficult to roll out, the cookies were perfect (if cooked for 10 minutes exactly) and they were not too sweet which allowed for a sweeter icing. Will definitely be using this as my new cookie recipe.

these cookies just taste like biscuits with a little bit of sugar in them. They are not the cookies I would make all the time. I couldn't find my recipe I usually use to make sugar cookies with so I thought I would try this one turns out they weren't what I was looking for.

The cookies I got out of this recipe had just what I wanted from a sugar cookie. Crisp but not rock hard, they tasted good and didn't lose ground to the icing I used. The dough was easy to manipulate, too.

I just used this recipe to make Halloween cookies with my 3 year old and 19 month old. We were lucky to have Grandma to help, too. We reduced the amount of salt and sugar a little bit to suit our taste. The dough held up to the enthusiastic rolling pin work and extra patting and squooshing by my 3 year old daughter. The refrigeration for 1 hour was perfect for us: we made the dough and then ate lunch while it chilled. The dough was very forgiving for the novice cookie cutters, and all three generations agreed that the cookies were delicious! We will use this recipe for all of our holiday cookies!

I followed the directions exactly and the cookies came out perfect all 3 times I made them. They aren't the most complex in flavor but they round out a cookie selection nicely. Every one loved them.

Rather than roll this recipe out, I formed into a long roll and cut the cookies into round slices. I still followed baking instructions and they turned out just fine. Although I wouldn't say that these were the most delicous sugar cookie I've ever baked, they were EASY to pull together and with a little icing on top they are delicious.

Rolled out and handled well; however a little bland. Used the icing from another recipe with lemon juice, milk, and powdered sugar, which helped punch up the taste.

The dough keeps well and it's important to follow the chilling. While not the best sugar cookies I've ever had, I in no way ran into the problems that kiwi did. My cookies cooked in time and tasted fine.

YUCK!! these are sugar cookies?? My mother and I were so exited to make these sugar cookies together, we did everything right, it says 10-12 minutes to bake (haha) it took more than 30min and they didn't even flatten out. by the end of the cookie exqperiment they were lumps of brown. they don't even taste good ( like playdough ) I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS RECIPE AND WOULD NOT RECOMD THIS TO ANYONE ELSE. some backing experience = [
