Made this with 2 sweet potatoes and a white potatoe. Chopped into pieces and combined with the asparagus. Gave the finished product a nice color and more flavor. I didn't have the Montasio cheese and used shredded NYS sharp, Romano and Mozzarella together. It was still delicious. I would cut the asparagus into 1/2" pieces to make it easier to press into cheese.
