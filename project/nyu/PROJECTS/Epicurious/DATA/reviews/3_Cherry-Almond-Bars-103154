This was easy, but really just too sweet (and this is coming from a pregnant woman with a suddenly insane sweettooth). I did, however, really like the crunchy almond bits in the crust/dough part.

These were delicious and relatively easy to make. The almond-cookie base is a little crumbly, though, and hard to cut. A big hit!

Fast and easy and a real hit!
