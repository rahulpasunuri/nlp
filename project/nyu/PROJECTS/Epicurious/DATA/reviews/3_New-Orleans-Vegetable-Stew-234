i didnt have all the ingrediants on hand when i made this so i also made a few substitutions - i used plain canned tomatoes but added a couple cans of peeled green chiles, i used canned black eyed peas, and i couldnt find okra so i used zucchini instead, i also tossed in some greenpeppers and popcorn shrimp...i also used a bit more spice than the recipe calls for...id definitely make it again

I also used a can of beans rather than the peas. It was okay but not good enough to do again.

This is quite good (especially for an okra lover like me), but to be honest the sweet potato and pinto bean chili recipe (also on this site) is similar and much tastier. We keep this in the rotation for variety and because it's a good way to use up leftover veggies (you can pretty much dice up and throw in whatever you've got!)

We have a garden so fresh okra and fresh corn, instead of the frozen, and a couple sweet and one Hot banana peppers. Substituted one can black beans I had on hand, also one sweet onion, sauteed, and it added that touch of sweet without the sugar. Also used some of my vegetable broth for more liquid (no mention of added liquid in recipe?) Served with rice on the side of the bowl, homemade sourdough bread as garlic toast (had two fresh loaves), and that was tasty, though would serve cornbread next time as the usual with okra. Our own Tabasco sauce. Yum!

It is perfect when you are planning a Mardi Gras party and some of your friends are vegetarians.

I love all the ingredients on their own, but this tasted OK. My husband described it as reminding him of the southern "everything in the pot" left overs. Won't be making it again.

I started this dish by carmelizing about 1/2 a sweet onion. My husband stated this was the best soup I had ever made. My grocery store did not have frozen black-eye peas, so I used one can instead. Served with corn bread and honey. Yummy!!! To the last reviewer, reading the recipe I took it to mean that you cook the black-eye peas before adding them to the mixture. That way nothing will be overcooked.

Really enjoyed this dish. Very tasty and had eye appeal. However, I needed to cook peas for longer than recipe said, so the okra began to fall apart. Next time will add okra after all is completely cooked.

Quite yummy. I followed another reviewer's advice and added 1 tbsp of brown sugar, which made it a bit too sweet for my taste. Mixing yukon with sweet potatoes, sauteeing garlic and olive oil, and adding chicken broth are all good suggestions. Next time, I'll use a lot less okra -- not crazy about the texture -- and add even more potatoes to give it a bit more chunkiness. Good for leftovers.

It was a real disappointment. It sounded absolutely delicious, but it was rather ordinary. I sauteed onion and garlic in oil before I started, but even that didn't make much of an improvement. While it's not a bad dish, it's not particularly good, either. Not a keeper.

Quite a good vegetarian recipe, with some modifications. For variety, I added Yukon potatoes to the sweet potatoes (not the same as yams). A bit of brown sugar (1 tbsp.) helps offset the spiciness. I didn't use okra (but will next time) and only had regular peas (which were fine). As another reviewer suggested, I added onion and sauteed it with garlic in olive oil first, and added chicken stock (1/3 cup).

Loved it!!! A couple suggestions for making it a 4**** recipe: 1) omit yams and replace with Yukon if you're not in the mood for sweet carb, 2) begin with 1/2 an onion, chopped, and 6 cloves garlic, sliced, sauteed with bay leaves until carmelized. Gives it tons of flavor!

My father loved this recipe, but unfortunately my brother was a bit undecided.

This was just a so-so vegetable stew. Nothing special, I'd prefer to try something new rather than make this again.

Being a cajun, I found that adding some crawfish tails (shrimp if you can't get the tails) and using red potatoes (the ones you use in a crawfish boil) instead of yams makes the whole stew that much better!

This was a delicious surprise for the black eyed peas my aunt gave me because she didn't know what to do with them. I did add some chicken stock and Ol Bay spice. Will definately add to my personal cookbook.

This recipe was good but nothing special.

I made this meal in about 35 minutes after work yesterday. It was delicious. My family loved it. Our Ethiopian housekeeper even asked to take some home because her people traditionally eat hot food. She didn't believe any American food could taste that good.

THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT RECIPE. I WILL BE MAKING IT AGAIN SOON.

Delicious! I sauteed some chopped celery and yellow onion and put it in the saucepan, prior to beginning step 1. I served this dish as a side dish with blackened catfish and plain steamed white rice. Excellent!

Excellent and easy! Couldn't find Cajun tomatoes, so I used tomatoes with garlic and omitted fresh garlic. Will keep this recipe for vegetarian guests. Made a lot to freeze for later!
