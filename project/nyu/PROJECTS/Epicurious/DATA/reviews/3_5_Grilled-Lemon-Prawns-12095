Excellent and easy to make! Rave reviews from all family members! I left the shells on and followed the recipe to a T (except added garlic as recommended by others). Will definitely make again.

Made this dish for the second time, and my thoughts haven't changed. It's good (and easily made with ingredients you are likely to have on hand), just not fantastic. I made the recipe as written (plus minced garlic), with all the olive oil (although you could cut back some). Only had time to marinate for 1.5 hours the second time, and my shrimp were "15s," not prawns. The seasonings flavor the shrimp, even with the shells on, and sucking on the cooked shrimp with the shells on is to be expected, I think. (Many cultures eat the shells, especially when they're thin.) Letting each person peel his own helps pace the dinner and provides a tasty, finger-licking experience. I broiled mine in the oven. Charcoal broiling probably would have added another layer of flavor. This is probably a pretty good way to cook prawns on the grill. For smaller shrimp, there are more flavorful ways.

Good basic recipe for grilled prawns on the bbq. Lemon zest gives a nice note as do herbs. I used the proportions of oil and salt indicated, shells and heads on. Not too salty once shelled. Nice with greek salad, pita, tsatsiki etc.

This was a nice and simple recipe. I added garlic as others suggested, and used a lot less olive oil. I thought there was too much thyme, so next time I'll reduce the amount.

Tried this for Fathers day, everyone in the family enjoyed it. Added garlic as recommended and marinated overnight. Cooked them in the shells on the barbecue. Will definitely make them again when I pick up some more tiger prawns from the wholesalers.

We loved the recipe; not sure why it doesn't say shelled vs. unshelled for the prawns. (I took shells off to marinate them) Used 1/2 cup oil as previously recommended--next time I will use 1/4 cup. I also used 1 tsp of salt as recommended. And added three cloves of minced garlic.

This dish is way too salty! Next time, I will leave out the salt entirely. I also used about 1/4 a cup of oil--1 cup is not necessary. With less salt, this is a very good and easy dish that I will make again.

I made this last night and we had the shrimp on top of green salad. I made a mistake while preparing--I added the lemon juice too early so I ended up only marinating shrimp for about 35-40 minutes. Also, cooked without shells over on grill pan but would like to try with proper marinating time and shells on next time. Would be a great meal on a hot summer night!

I made these twice - once with shells on and once with peeled prawns. I think I liked the results with the shells on better, although more work at the table. Served 3 large tiger prawns with lemon wedges - nice starter. Also made it (without shells) and tossed with thin egg pasta - yummy. Kids and hubby ate it up.

As all we Epicurious foodies, I changed a few things. I added the lemon juice with the spices. Instead of grilling or broiling, I drained the shrimp then qickly cooked them in 2T butter with 2 cloves of garlic. I added a 1/4 cup of white wine and the juice of 1/2 a lemon. Served it over polenta and my husband loved it.

I've made this dish several times, and it's one of those that goes in my all time favorite category. Will use this recipe till the day I die. Definitely follow the other suggestions of adding garlic. Also if you prefer to take the shells off your prawns before cooking, I'd cut down the amount of salt a bit. I have done it both ways (shells on and off) and the time I removed the shells, they were a bit salty.

I was disappointed with this. It was not lemony enough even though I used the full amount for half of the seafood. Neither did it have enough of a garlic taste. It was slightly bitter, and I decreased the herbs by half.

Forgot to add, served over toasted orzo boiled in seafood stock, with sleazer salad. Dressing homemade, fresh every time, but croutons are the Garlic and Parmesan from this site.

This is rated 4 forks with my changes. For the marinade, I added three cloves of garlic, white pepper, GREEK oregano, and two generous pinches of aleppo pepper. Marinated for 5 hours. Good quality spices really make the diff. Good basic recipe, but def. need the garlic in the marinade. Added 1/3 cup of lemon juice. Let sit for another hour at room temp. Dumped the whole thing in a 12" hot skillet all juices. Used U 6 shrimp from Costco, peeled and deveined. Sauteed for about 2 minutes per side, and added a splash of vermouth towards the end and lit it till flames died out. Great Valentines's dinner. The huge shrimp really made it, don't over cook.

I used pre-cooked prawns & reserved the marinade to use as a sauce with the prawns. It was excellent! We can't wait to make it again.

I took TK's suggestions and added garlic, and also boiled the marinade to use as a sauce. It was excellent! I suggest cutting down on the salt to 1 and a half teaspoons, and adding the juice of an entire lemon, rather than three tablespoons. I served it with "hasselback potatoes" (recipe on this site) and greek salad. Yum!

Loved this recipe! I did as suggested by others - cut salt in half, added several cloves of garlic, mashed. Marinaded for about 1 hr. Barbecued the shrimp (a 2 lb bag of frozen tiger shrimp, peeled and deveined, thawed), and boiled the remaining marinade to use as a sauce over the shrimp and rice. Being shrimp it's special enough for company, but my family (incl. kids 12 and 10) loved it too!

At the FoodNetwork website they have this exact same recipe (and it says courtesy of Gourmet magazine) except that they state that the shrimp should be shelled and de-veined. Plus they add an bearnaise sauce, completely unnecessary in my opinion.

It's easy to make. Dish is simple but tasty. Replying to Sanja: It depends. But for nice looking, I won't shell them, but of coz it needs more time to marinate.

This was good, added garlic and substitute thyme for basil. And instead of grilling it, I sauteed it with its marinate so it is juicy. Served with Orzo and Swiss Chard.

I have Not made it yet - Could someone please tell me if I should shell the prawns or leave them whole & shelled before marinating - the recipe is not clear??????????

Just wonderful! Loved the flavor combo - I used lime instead of lemon and added garlic. I couldn't stop eating them.

Excellent! We didn't have time to marinade it the full time but it was still wonderful! We did add two cloves of garlic. We will definitely make it again-even my 6 yr old loved it!

I totally earned Queen of the House status after making this. Definitely add a large clove of garlic and mash it with the salt. Holy moley!!!

I made these last night for my boyfriend and he absolutely LOVED them! I added garlic like the other reviewers suggested, I didn't increase the lemon juice because that is what dries them out. I also grilled them right after I had grilled some BBQ chicken, the prawns picked up that smoky aroma, it was great!

I should have listened to the others-- definitely add garlic! I also made the mistake of peeling the shrimp for the sake of ease when eating, and I think that dried them out. This had a decent flavor, but it really needed more of a boost.

This was awesome. Following other's suggestions (which I'm finding invaluable across the board!) I reduced the Oregano, Thyme & Salt; increased the Lemon Juice; and added a small amount of Crushed Garlic. If the house should burn down, I'm running in to save this recipe!

This is a great recipe! I have made it twice and both times my dinner quest have raved about it. Preparation is minimal and you can let it marinate for as little as an hour and it still tastes great. For a nice summer meal try the prawns over a fresh green salad.

We(2 adults and 4 young girls) loved this dish! I also included some sea scallops and on a few I wrapped them in bacon. OOOOOWWWEEEEEE!! To the marinade I also added some garlic.

I really enjoyed these prawns and followed the recipe as written except I added 5 small garlic. Next time when I make these though, I will cut down on the basil and thyme and add more lemon juice. They were just a little overpowering for me. As I had a lot of prawns to cook up, I did them in batches in the wok. I cooked them until they were pink then removed them. (1 minute) Even though these were good, they will be excellent next time!

My husband and I love this recipe so much. I buy the jumbo prawns and marinate them overnight. Then we grill them and mmmmm, they are so good. It is important not to overcook them or they are too dry and lose a lot of flavor.

Made this for a 4th of July BBQ. Even though they got too much heat (someone else turned the BBQ's gas up without us seeing it), they turned out delicious.

My husband loved it. I added a splash of white vermouth.Actually cooked 3 min on one side and 2 min on the other. Next time will only cook 2 min on each side

I ran out of olive oil.. disasterous!! So I used whatever that's left (less than half a cup) of olive oil, increase the number of lemon juice to 6tbsp and reduced salt to 1tsp. I marinated huge king prawns (cut in half length-wise) for less than an hour and grilled it in an electronic oven. Tasted great but the next time I would leave it a little charred.. I think the spices taste fabulous slightly burned..

I made these prawns for a family reunion dinner. Because I was making so much, I broiled the prawns. They were a hit and very easy. The key is not to overcook the prawns.

I made this for Super-Bowl Sunday and what a hit it was! Used less that 1/2 the salt called for, otherwise left everything else the same. It's definitely a "keeper".

this didn't work for me at all. i cut back on both the oregano and thyme, added a clove of garlic and increased the amount of lemon juice. there still wasn't any real "life" to it.

We made this for friends and everyone loved it. I found it slightly salty, so I'll cut back on the salt. I can't wait to try it again.
