Use this recipe. Don't believe anyone when they say they can make focaccia without a starter or sponge. It will have no complexity and you might as well use bisquick or pilsbury dough. If you look through the LA Times website there is a great article by Nancy Silverton on focaccia with some tips. 1. Use 2 smaller cake pans instead of a big dish. You'll have to manipulate the bread less to fit it into the dish. I used a cast iron pan for one of my focaccia breads and it was excellent. The cast iron lent a lovely crunchiness to the bread. 2. Really dig the toppings into the bread, and move your finger outward toward the side of the pan when you put them in. This will mean your toppings get cooked inside of the bread and be devine instead of burning a little bit on top. 3. Put 1/4 c. of oil in the bottom of the pan so the oil flavor gets seeped up through the bread.

This focaccia recipe takes time and care, but it is well worth it. I used a quality bread flour and yeast, having recently had a bad experience with "all-purpose" flour and rapid- rise yeast (and a poorly written recipe on another site). Instead of the sage on top, I used less salt and grated just a little Parmesan-Romano. A lovely focaccia, and the sage flavor is subtle and wonderful.

I have just started making foccacia, and of the recipes I've tried, this is the best. My family definitely prefers this one also... So far, we have not used any sage, either...

I made this recipe with the exact proportions listed and it turned out great. I didn't have any sage (fresh or dried) so I used a teaspoon each of dried rosemary and oregano but that's the only change I made. I have made a lot of sourdough bread and the sponge was very similar to my sourdough starter. It was thick, but still stirrable - not doughy, not runny. My finished dough was a bit sticky so I had to add another quarter cup of flour. I didn't have anything to spray water so I didn't do that. As a result the top crust may have been a bit too hard but the inside of the focaccia was just right for tenderness.

This recipe was disappointing. I followed it closely and it turned out a very crackly, almost brittle focaccia .. and I am not a novice focaccia maker. The flavor was fine, but the texture was way off. I like a much more tender focaccia. I used a pan that was 10 x 15 and I still had trouble stretching the dough to fit. So, I might try this again but it was a lot of work for an only-okay outcome. I highly recommend "Tomato Flatbread with Two Herbs" in Jane Freiman's Dinner Party cookbook. It's easy (made in a food processor, rises in the fridge) and has always turned out delicious and gotten raves .....

My favorite focaccia. Can be easily made with a different herb than sage.

But I too am curiouw...I know what a sponge is, but how is it used here? Do you make one or the other or are you combing the sponge with the dough? Can someone explain? I've made focaccia before, but never with a sponge...just yeast, water, flour etc.

QUESTION: Does anyone else have problems with the recipe as it is written? See the ratio of flour to water in the sponge. You can't stir 3 units of flour into 2 of water. You end up with something doughy that requires kneading and not a liquidy sponge. I'm at the first stage of trying out this as a new way to make focaccia and am skeptical about bubbles forming. I've conducted a search and discovered that this recipe appears as written on other sites; unless all copy directly from epicurious, it does not seem to be a typo.

One of my favorite recipes on all of Epicurious. This focaccia has become a real regular at our house: it lends itself to infinite variations, from replacing the sage with rosemary to using spelt or whole wheat instead of flour. I recently made the bread, sans herbs, and topped it with a carmelized onion jam and gorgonzola cheese before baking--pure heaven!!

I've made this several times and think it is the best focaccia recipe on the site. I sometimes use 1/2 semolina flour and top it with whatever I have on hand. Recipe doubles easily.

While a little bit time consuming, this recipe was delicious. I had forgotten how much I enjoy making bread! I agree with the previous reviewer in that rosemary would make a fine substitute for the sage. I reduced the amount of salt sprinkled over the top.

I have made this recipe for years, but with rosemary instead if sage. Everyone raves about it. I would not change a thing.
