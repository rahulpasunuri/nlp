I am still in the "evaporation" stage and have not actually tried this dish, but to peel the squash I cut it along the ridges that run from top to bottom. Meridians if you will. then used a regular vegetable peeler for the rest. Hope this helps!

I found this dish VERY bland. As such, I added much more turmeric, curry, salt and even pepper.

Forgot to add below that I baked the squash halves on a baking sheet in the oven for about an hour at 400F, until brown and soft.

This is a really delicious, quick and easy recipe. I substituted my local international store's curry powder for the cumin, coriander and turmeric (all of those ingredients were in the powder). To make it easier (I can't see how this is under 45 minutes - it could take a while just to peel and dice the acorn squash), I just cut the squash in half and filled the cavities with the mixture instead of adding the squash to the mixture. Then I served it by cutting each half into 4 pieces. I will definitely be making this again.

Fantastic! Great flavor, and surprisingly filling. Peeling the squash, as noted in previous reviews, was the hardest part. I did it by cutting off the top and bottom, then cutting into eight wedges and removing the skin from each one (how I cut a melon). I used a VERY sharp knife, and even then it required a lot of force. I also used stock instead of water - a highly recommended substitution since it added a lot of body (careful on the salt if you do substitute, though). Finally, I drained most of the liquid off before reducing, as it would have taken an hour to boil it all off if I hadn't.

I liked this but it didn't rock my world. I used butternut squash which is much easier to peel, so maybe that affected the flavour (but butternut is my favourite so that probably wasn't the issue). My spouse liked it a lot though, and he isn't a fan of squash, so it certainly isn't a bad recipe, not disappointing, but just lacking a little something that will make me try a different recipe next time.

The spice flavors were a bit on the bland side, so I would increase the quantity of spices in the future. The brown sugar may counter the spice, so I might skip that in the future. An easy way to get some veggies in my stubborn hubby!

prep time on the squash makes this one i won't try again--too much for a weekday dinner. i had to use brown mustard seeds, but the flavors, overall, were weak. i would have liked the option to add some heat, making it a spicier curry. also, any tricks to speed up peeling the squash? suggestions?

Surpassed my expectations! Aside from peeling the squash, which was time-consuming, this was a very quick and easy dish. I added some red lentils and used 3T of sweetened coconut, omitting sugar. Served over basmati rice, it was a very delicious and filling dish!

I made this recipe last night as a side dish for the Malaysian Roast Chicken and we enjoyed it very much. I did not have a red onion so used a regular cooking onion. As suggested, I also added curry powder (about 1 1/2 tsp). We are used to adding brown sugar to our squash so did not find it quite sweet enough, and actually added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar to the recipe. I covered the pot for part of the cooking time so that it would not be too dry, and cooked it until the squash was quite tender. This would be a wonderful make ahead side dish for the Thanksgiving or Christmas turkey, and we will try it this year for something a little different.

I used this recipie with buttercup squash which I had already baked, but wanted to spice up. Using the proportions and spices, I created an onion/spice paste and added the smooth buttercup squash (ommiting the water) to heat it up. Yum! Quick and easy whipped squash dish!

This was my first time making something Indian and I must say I was quite pleased. I used yellow mustard seeds instead of black and much less oil than called for and it still turned it fine. Only problems were that I found it a little sweet and thus would omit or reduce the sugar next time; I needed to add more water, and although I didn't this time, I would probably puree it if I were serving it to company, as the finished product is not all that attractive.

Simple and fairly quick to make, this dish has nice flavor, and, as others have said, goes well with basmatic rice. I forgot to try yogurt and chutney with it. Next time for sure!

other than peeling the squash which had very deep ridges, this recipe was pretty quick. Loved the complex flavors; served over rice, it's a very satisfying vegetarian meal. I substituted yellow mustard seeds for the black and used sweetened coconut. Was still very good and I will definitely make it again.

This turned out to be tasty over basmati rice, though I must admit I tinkered with the recipe. I added 2 tsp. of good quality curry powder and used honey instead of brown sugar. I also cooked it for a good long time, then mashed the squash a bit for texture. Served it with plain yogurt and hot mango chutney.
