This chowder is delicious! I substituted a large shallot for the leeks (none at the store that day) and added some chopped celery at the same time. I also used baby reds instead of the russet potato and simmered covered for about 15 minutes, then simmered uncovered for 5 minutes after adding oysters. I actually used drained, smoked oysters (3.75 ounce tin) since that is what I had on hand. I also used fat-free 1/2 & 1/2 to cut back on some calories, and seafood broth instead of clam juice. The consistency of the broth was perfect and the smokiness of the chowder was outstanding!

Really good. Used smoked oysters...coconut milk as dairy alternative, no bacon, homemade chicken stock...great!

OK,so it's sort of winter here and I saw the ouysters calling out to me, so they ended up in my basket. My mother taught me to make oyster stew a long time ago, so I sort of merged this recipe and that. The only differences were using leeks instead of onions (which I did) and the addition of the potatoes. The one difference I would highly recommend would be to add about 3 tablespoons of Worcestershire Sauce, just to give it a little more kick and flavor. It doesn't cover up the oysters like a lot of additions would.

This was tasty and hearty. Perfect for a snowy evening!

I made this using freshly caught Wellfleet oystrs plus a few fresh clams that we also caught. It was delicious. Adding corn (even canned) was a fantastic addition.

We've made this recipe many times and it's always a crowd pleaser. We had it as a post-Thanksgiving dinner this weekend and everyone loved it. Be sure not to cook the oysters or potatoes too long or they do get a bit mushy. We also use pepper bacon. Yum!

I'm a seafood lover, and a fisheries biologist, so I'm acutely aware of the impact of fishing on our oceans. That said, I've been looking for recipes that use sustainably caught and farmed seafood. Oysters are great because farming them is actually good for water quality, making them an excellent sustainable choice. Plus, they're farmed close to home. This was an excellent oyster soup - simple, hearty, delicious.

We have a familhy tradition of Oyster Stew on Christmas Eve. This year, I decided to put a new twist on this tradition. This Oyster Chowder is an incredibly delicious twist to that tradition! The vegetables make this a one-dish meal- what an incredible mix of flavors and textures! Like some of the others, I added corn to the chowder, and it really added to the mix of flavors.

Fantastic! All loved it, even those who don't like oysters loved this chowder with the oysters picked out. Used homemade seafood stock instead of clam juice, and added a pinch of cayenne. Will make this again and again, including with other seafoods.

I've reviewed this recipe before and I wanted to add that last night I made this with leftover corn on the cob. Replaced the clam juice with chicken stock and used the kernels from 4 ears of corn. Kept everything else the same. Delicious.

Being a good PA Dutch girl, any chowder is not complete without corn, as the corn provides a sweet decadence to the flavor. If cooking the recipe as is, one ear of sweet corn will suffice otherwise double, triple as all other ingredients. I also used the oyster juice with the clam juice and 1/3 milk with 2/3 h&half.

Simple and perfect as written. Flavors all come together beautifully. I served with a green salad dressed with olive oil and balsamic and crusty sour dough bread. Great light lunch.

Excellent, very tasty rich and easy too. We will use this recipe again and again!

Excellent! I used a mix of silver and lemon thyme which gave a nice flavor. Sweet onions insted of leeks, but would use leeks if I had them on hand.

Easy & Delicious! I agree with another reader, this makes a great base for any kind of chowder. Didn't have any clam broth, but used the oyster liquor, half water and half chicken stock with good results.

I quadrupled the quantity. Why would anyone make oyster stew for two? What a waste of thyme. (Get it?) Great recipe, very easy. I didn't even peel my potatoes.

A great after Thanksgiving soup! It's much better than the traditional Oyster soup(milk,butter and usually canned oysters)that my family traditionally ate on Christmas eve. The rest of my family are not huge fans but I'll be making it again for me!!

This chowder was a hit...I used fat free half and half which worked very well.

Though, I prefer a clam chowder recipe I have, my husband really liked this chowder. He has asked me to make it again soon. So from my husband, this recipe gets a thumbs up.

As did other reviewers, I use a combination of one part milk and one part half-and-half. I also added some sherry. I thought it was excellent.

I made this recipe for my mother's birthday dinner & everyone loved it. Very easy. Used one part half & half & two parts milk.

I think the next time I'll add a dash of Worst. sauce and a dash of Tabasco. I also used 2% milk instead of half & half which really cuts down on the fat. This is a real keeper!

This chowder has been a Christmas Eve tradition in house since it was first printed. Everyone raves about it. It is definately a keeper!

Very good chowder. I used milk instead of half and half and fish stock instead of clam juice. My boyfriend asked for a second helping.

This was a great recipe and you can use clams or shrimp instead of oysters if you wanted. A great white base for any seafood/shell fish chowder.

This is a regular meal of ours. I add 2 cans of clams w/juice instead of the bottled clam juice & add 1/2 C or so of chicken stock. SO easy. So yummy, especially on a cold snowy night.

This was delicious! Like another reviewer, I added some chicken broth with good results. I served with slices of lemon, lots of saltines and Louisiana hot sauce and everyone was very pleased. I will definately make this again!

This was very good. It makes two hearty portions, possibly three with a salad. We like to eat it with a shake of tobasco and a little squeeze of lemon.

Very easy and very good. Needs salt and pepper. Other than that no changes. Perfect for a cold winter night....tonight was our first snow of the season! What timing!

We brought fresh oysters home from a picnic in Tomales Bay and used this chowder recipe as a guide. I used shallots instead of leeks, and soy milk instead of dairy, and beautiful little golden potatoes with fresh thyme from our garden. It was stupendous. It's important that once the oysters are in they not cook beyond 3 minutes.

It's great chowder, especially on a blustery winter's day. I hope to be able to find Crown Pilot crackers in the Bloomington, IN area!
