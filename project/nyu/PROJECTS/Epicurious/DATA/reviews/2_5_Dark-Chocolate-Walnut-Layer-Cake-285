I have made this cake several times and it is always perfect--everyone loves it.

I was disappointed with this cake. The taste was only okay and the layers were quite thin and crumbly though the cake wasn't dry. I threw out the recipe -- there are so many better chocolate cake recipes out there.

Great cake, however, the layers were only 1/2" thick. Would definately make again, only I would double the recipe.
