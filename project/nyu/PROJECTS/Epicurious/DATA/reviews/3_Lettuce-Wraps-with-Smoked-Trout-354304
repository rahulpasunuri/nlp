Easy and really delicious. Perfect for a hot summer night. The only problem was peeling the cucumber and carrot with a peeler which makes the strips too thin and is too time consuming. Will try again with a mandolin or food processor. I will be making this again tonight.

This was an amazing dish. It was simple to make and absolutely delicious. A few thoughts. Two jalapenos are too much. Even one with the seeds gave it a lot of heat. Secondly, we used both iceberg and butter lettuce for wrap which worked well. Served it at a brunch with cold poached salmon with a tarragon mayonnaise, cold shrimp with a spicy cocktail sauce, potato salad etc. What a hit!

Ehhh...That's my feeling. I had fresh tomatoes from our garden, farmer's market carrots and squash, and it still came out just kind of bland. I think the problem is it needs some sort of fatty oomph. And I'm a low cal vegetarian. I'm thinking some fried won ton crisps? Dunno, just didn't work for me or my partner.

I made this for a party and it got a lot of compliments. I would make it again, but I made a few modifications to made it less work.

This recipe was delicious! Very fresh, all the flavors you want out of thai food, but very light. Great for a quick, light summer meal for one or two. I replaced the smoked trout with a filet of snapper, marinated in lime juice and sweet chili sauce, cooked in the oven and cooled before mixing. Definitely strain the liquid twice as the mixture does have a tendency to get too watery.

Dreadful. I followed the recipe and found it surprisingly tasteless and incredibly watery (despite draining as directed). A total disappointment.
