Best bread ever! You don't need vitamin C for the starter; just replace it in the recipe with 2 Tbs of white vinegar (the replacement with lemon juice did not work as well). Do not bake as stated in the recipe but follow the "No-knead-bread" from New York Times, i.e. in a heavy pot in a preheated 450 degrees oven for the first 30 minutes, and then - with the lid off-at 425 for 20 minutes.

This is a good biga. As far as I can see the vitamin C just adds acidity, which would help to self-select the yeast spores which are resistant to the acid. This just speeds up the process of developing a really sour sour-dough culture. You can achieve the same result with vinegar, but clearly want the least flavour possible--I have used rice vinegar.

After reading and trying dozens of "sour" bread recipes from a multitude of cookbooks, I've used this method on my own (I derived it from bits and pieces from the aforementioned library of cookbooks...minus the Vitamin C) for about a year now. It makes for a constant starter that matures beautifully, and once you've made bread from this starter or "proto", bread without it will seem quite bland indeed! Try it...it's well worth the effrort! Thanks Alton!

I haven't made it yet, but why the vitamin C?
