Good-- not great though-- they did fry up nicely, just not quite sweet enough and tasted like they still needed something. The glaze is a necessity for flavor and sweetness but it is strongly coffee flavored (we added in some vanilla bean paste as well) so make sure you use a good quality powder.

My husband got a deep-fryer for Christmas, and this was the first thing we made in it. Amazing. I made the dough the night before and let it rise in the fridge overnight. That worked brilliantly, and the dough was very easy to work with in the morning. The glaze is necessary, in my opinion, as the dough itself is not very sweet. Instead of re-rolling the scraps I just made a lot of extra doughnut holes; those I tossed in cinnamon sugar instead of glazing, and it just wasn't as good as the glazed doughnuts. Nonetheless, these were amazing.

I made these for our family Hanukkah party last night. I filled them with jelly instead of using the glaze. They were yummy, but some didn't cook all the way on the inside.

I'm not rating this recipe b/c I actually baked the doughnuts rather than frying them. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and they were delicious! If you want some yummy yeast donuts without the guilt of frying them, definitely try this recipe. After the dough rose I didn't roll them out, but instead just took small handfuls of dough and shaped them into doughnuts. Then I put them on a greased cookie sheet and brushed them with melted butter. I baked them for about 10 minutes at 375 and they were awesome. I used the coffee glaze in this recipe and thought it was yummy too, though I used actual espresso instead of instant espresso and boiling water. Definitely a keeper!

There's nothing like fresh hot sugared doughnuts. These were wonderful...I found that allowing them to rise in the refrigerator is probably better since the dough is a bit difficult to handle room temp. I also skipped the glaze and cinnamon. I just rolled them in sugar immediately when they were out of the fryer. I will be making this again soon!

A mess! I don't know if it's because I tried to save time in the morning by allowing it to rise in the fridge but the next day I found the dough difficult to work with. As I tried to place the rounds in the oil they completely fell apart and lost their shape. The result tasted ok, although they were more doughnut clumps. The glaze however was awful and I salvaged what I could with a simple powdered sugar/milk glaze.

I used this recipe for basic doughnuts, omitting the cinnamon and using a different glaze. The doughnuts are beautifully soft and perfect, though they don't keep well past the first day (not that they usually last that long anyway). I always gently reroll the scraps and have no problems with the outcome.

I used this recipe for doughnuts and skipped the glaze, working with raspberry and chocolate icing instead. They turned out awesome. You can re-roll the dough once, so long as you're gentle, and the result will have creases from the original cuts. I took that and, with the larger cookie cutter, made cool little bearclaw type things and sprinkled with powdered sugar. They obviously didn't have the look of doughnuts, but they held together through frying just fine and the texture was just the same.

So Good! I did re-roll the scraps despite the warning & made them into twist style doughnuts. They were just as good if not better (shape preference). Will probably just twist them all next time because it's so much easier. Delicious glaze - I did omit the corn syrup. It's very strong and sweet so don't give your doughnuts a full bath until you taste.

Absolutely delicious. We are actually cake donut people, and we loved these. The dough formed a crust during the rise even though I floured the top, so I would recommend oil. Also, use a good instant espresso, because it figures STRONGLY in the glaze. Also, be sure to modulate the oil temperature carefully. Other than that, bon appetit!!
