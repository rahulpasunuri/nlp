It's 2T smoked paprika, not 2t. Much better sandwich as a melt with swiss or provolone. For a quick weeknight meal, substitute pre cooked shredded rotisserie chicken for the turkey cutlets. I've made this many times for football parties with great success.

Is it 2t. of paprika as the ingredients list states or 2 T. paprika that is in the recipe?

This was so delicious. I served it as a melt, using swiss cheese over the turkey and peppers. I didn't use as many peppers and the mayo flavor really shined thru. Depending on the time of year, most grocers carry turkey cutlets prepackaged in the meat case.

http://www.eatturkey.com/consumer/60th/cutlets.html Here's a brief description. I've always considered cutlets to be the tenderloin portion of the breast and I have (perhaps mistakenly?) used the terms interchangeably. Hope this all helps, or ask your local butcher for a definitive answer.

I believe when in reference to any fowl, a cutlet is the smaller more tender (and deep/interior)of the two breast muscles.

I'm so glad they told me that smoked paprika is in the spice aisle of the supermarket. But where in the world would I find this "turkey cutlets"?! Is it a foodstuff? I've checked the hardware store, the mattress place, and my drug dealer. I've been beaten up and thrown out of establishments. Can not give a rating until I'm told who purveys the other exotic ingredients.
