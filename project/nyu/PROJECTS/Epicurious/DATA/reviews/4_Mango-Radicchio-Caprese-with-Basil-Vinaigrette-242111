This was really good. I added endive to the salad as well. Instead of mozzarella I shaved off parts of a firm goat cheese. Will def make it again.

Absolutely delicious. Looks fabulous and tastes just as good. An easy recipe that anybody can make, but few people will have seen before.

Simply fantastic. Sweet, bitter, creamy. Every time I've served it there have been rave reviews. Followed the recipe to a tee but used the standard round radicchio.

Wonderful & very refreshing! Who needs tomatoes??

Absolutely delicious even with romaine (and more kid-friendly). I can see where radicchio would balance flavors, and will try next time. I used a potato peeler to slice the mango and then curled it on the plates and sliced the romaine in long strips, approx. 1x4" and drizzled the vinaigrette w/some on plate for a beautiful presentation.

I made this because it sat right next to the Bacon and Swiss Chard Pasta (delish!) in the May 2008 issue of Bon Appetit. I was so incredibly surprised! It is winter here in California - and I did not miss the summer tomatoes in a traditional caprese one bit. The radicchio balanced the mango and vinaigrette beautifully - don't substitute it. I did chop it up so it wasn't a big ole' leaf.

The radicchio was unnecessary for flavor in my opinion, but it did look pretty. This salad was delicious and everyone at my dinner party loved it. Go heavy on the basil because otherwise it's too sweet and mild. The basil gives it that perfect tang. I can't wait to make this again soon!

Absolutely fresh. I would never have thought to substitute mango for tomato in caprese. I used fresh chopped basil (from my little kitchen plant) just because I love the look of chopped herbs. Will definitely be making this again - simple and elegant. And very easy.

Great twist on the usual caprese salad. I put it over romaine instead of the radicchio and it tasted great. I would double the dressing next time. This was a hit with my whole family.

I made this for a group of executives who had purchased a dinner for 8 from a fundraiser. They were all pretty sophisticated and well travelled. They couldn't stop raving about this course! It was great because everything could be prepped well ahead of time. I am planning on using this dish for another fundraiser for free clinics and hope to win in a cook off format. I changed nothing except used smaller mozzarella balls mostly for presentation.

Great Recipe. Fast and so pretty! Will definitely make this again.

This was a nice twist on the traditional caprese especially for those who aren't fans of tomatoes. I didn't have radicchio but it wasn't important, just substitute another crunchy green.

Made this with belgian endive as a sub for the radicchio because whole foods couldn't get any that week. I also prefer bocconcini. So some flexibility to the recipe. It turned out fine. My guests were blown away with the sweetness of the mango, saltiness of the mozzarella and the bitterness of the greens. Making it again this weekend for a charity dinner using the small leaves of globe basil instead of the larger regular basil. I expect the same reaction as the first time I made it.

We used baby spinach instead of the radicchio and also used smoked mozzarella. The fresh basil was delicious! This is a great mixture of flavors.

This salad is absolutely delicious. The first time I made this I used water-buffalo mozzarella I bought at Costco. If you can find it, use it, because it's a thousand times better.

Great flavor combination. However, I felt it needed greens, so I used a mix of greens that included radicchio; radicchio alone was too bitter for our taste. We will be using this adapted recipe for dinner club!

While searching for something other than pesto to make with my bountiful basil crop, I found this recipe. I used balsamic vinegar and the fresh mixed spring greens you find in the bins near the lettuces. The mix includes radicchio, but I find radicchio too bitter for my taste. I used the fresh mozzarella already rolled in little balls. This was EXCELLENT and healthy and easy and tasty. For me the key to getting this one right was mixing in enough balsamic vinegar and sprinkling salt and pepper over the top. Unlike most salads, this was better the next day because the mozzarella had soaked up all the vinegar and ground basil. It's on my keeper list.

The best caprese salad ever! Nice twist on the classic, great flavors, and beautiful presentation.

Delicious salad! Really great color combination. I omitted the white balsamic vinegar and drizzled with balsamic syrup instead. Will make again soon!

Was hesitant to try this after reading the comments of the reviewer who found it "unappetizing," but glad I did; served this as one of six courses in a menu that features some pretty rich dishes. Guests found it refreshing and a unique and surprising combo of ingredients. It was eaten up all the way around. Nice that all can be done ahead, too: leaves washed and dried, mangos peels and sliced, cheese sliced. Another reviewer was right, and I didn't believe it until seeing it myself: the dressing does not brown. It's still nice and green a couple of days later!

Maybe my ingredients weren't fresh enough but I found this to be terribly unappetizing. I won't bother trying it again.

Wonderful, different and colorful. Easy to prepare but special for a dinner party (and even the kids ate it!) I garnished with some pomegranate seeds for some more crunch and a pop of color. We had some leftover basil viniagrette and I was happily surprised it didn't brown in the fridge overnight -- it would taste great over simple grilled meat or fish so maybe next time I'll make a double batch of the dressing.

Tasty dish and beautiful to look at! Big hit an my Sunday brunch. I don't have a food processor, but the vinaigrette came out great with finely chopping the basil.

My new favorite! I use golden balsamic, because I'm trying to use it up. My aunt used rice wine vinegar and said it was terrific.

Very different flavor profiles that complement each other so well. The bitter radicchio against the sweet mango, the tart vinegar, the creaminess of the mozzarella and the fresh basil work beautifully together in this salad. Made it for family during a Sun. dinner; we could not put our forks down.

A new favorite. The mango and mozzarella blend blend together perfectly. Fresh and fabulous!

Wonderful and so easy! Due to the tomato scare and two guests that don't eat them, this was a perfect solution! One of the caprese afficianados couldn't stop raving about it. It was a wonderful Father's Day barbeque addition.

Great starter - my company really enjoyed it. I'm not a fan of radicchio - I find it very bitter so I ommited it. Will make again.

This was absolutely awesome! I couldn't find radicchio where I was visiting on vacation, but can see how that alone can add beautiful color! It was a hit, even without the radicchio!

An interesting blend of sweet mango and basil with the bitter radicchio, nice change to the regular caprese. I just served with a leftover grilled chicken breast for a light meal. Beautiful on the plate as well, would serve to company any time.

Nice change to everyday salad. I should have made the mango strips thinner. We needed a knife to cut them or risked them flying off the plate.

Loved this salad! A true taste of summer.

We made this last night to go with the "grilled citrus chicken under a brick". Both were fabulous!! The Mango Radicchio Caprese was such a wonderful blending of flavors! I would have never thought to pair basil with mango, but we absolutely loved it! It was a nice change from the typical tomato caprese. We also substituted regular (round) radicchio for the Tardivo radicchio in the picture. It was so colorful, and made a nice presentation. Be sure to use ripe mangoes that are nice and sweet. :) We are saving this one to our recipe box!
