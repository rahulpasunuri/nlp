We enjoy bold flavors and found this dish pretty uninspiring. I wouldn't try it again, but I do think bumping up the amount of lemon might have helped.

Delicious! The recipe is worth the preserved lemons alone. We've found numerous creative uses for them.

From the cooking school issue, which has some GREAT recipes. This one is not great, just good, but in a white-trash, simplistic kind of way. No depth of flavors, just a squirt of hot sauce so only one type of heat. Crab+Pasta+butter = always enjoyable. But short on herbs and the lemon didn't contribute enough character. Still - simplistic and tasty. But you're better off spending your $24 on crab legs in a better recipe.

Quite ordinary and therefore disappointing. Preserved Lemons did nothing for the dish.

This was delicious! The preserved lemon maybe got a bit lost - next time I'd add more. Overall, a real keeper!
