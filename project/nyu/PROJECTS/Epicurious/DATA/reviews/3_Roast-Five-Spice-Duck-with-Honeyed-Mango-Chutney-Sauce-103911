Impressive for guests and smells wonderful in the house (for days) despite ease of preparation. Just plan out the timing carefully so you start early enough. I'm not sure I roasted it right, though. Per the other reviews, I cut the salt for the brine (down to 1.5 C), rinsed the ducks after brining, and refrigerated them dry (for 6-7 hrs). During the first 45 min of roasting, though, it started smoking from the abundant fat drippings, and I worried that it would set off the smoke alarm. I used a baster to remove all the fat from the pan several times. I had inserted a regular meat thermometer before roasting, and it reached 175 after another half hour, so rather than risk ending up with two hunks of charcoal, I cut the heat way back and took the ducks out pretty early. I think I lowered the temp too much and/or took them out too early, though, because despite the beautiful browned skin and internal temp, it seemed a little too rare. I blame myself, not the recipe, but I just wasn't sure what to do since I had covered the ducks with foil and the little bit sticking out was already black. It was not salty at all, though, so I was glad I cut the salt in the brine and rinsed the ducks after brining. I guess next time I would be sure to completely cover all parts of the ducks with foil, continue cooking despite reaching 175, and test periodically until done satisfactorily. Also, half a duck took up an almost comical proportion of the (10" square) plate. (In fact, I laughed upon plating the first one.) Maybe use a round plate or a larger one, or cut the bird in smaller parts. I thought it looked silly with one leg sticking out, as if it were coming up out of the bottom of the plate!

Drying the duck uncovered in the fridge for 10-12 hours makes the skin crispy. Very flavorsome.

I used kosher salt instead of salt and rinsed the duck so the duck was not salty. Brining the duck made it very juicy. The skin was not crispy enough for me, however.

I used ducklings and oven roasted on alder plank at 350 degrees.

The duck was very tender and looked great and smelled even better. However, I agree with the previous post, it was very, very salty. I think I will try it with only one cup of salt next time.

My kitchen smelled wonderful while the duck was in the oven roasting, however...the marinade was way too salty. It overpowered all the other flavors aside from the five spice. I would recommend cutting the amount to 1.5c. I think that this recipe could easily be adapted to a whole chickens also. Didn't make the mango chutney but after shredding the duck meat I rolled it in freshly made scallion pancakes, with plum sauce, and a leaf of raw napa cabbage. Probably won't make it again but am curious how others feel about it. I did make a nice stock from the carcass, so it wasn't a total loss.
