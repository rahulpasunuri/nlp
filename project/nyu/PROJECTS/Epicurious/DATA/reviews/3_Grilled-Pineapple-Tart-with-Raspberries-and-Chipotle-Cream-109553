This is my absolute favorite dessert for summer time. Grilling the pineapple is the perfect compliment to the smoky flavor of the chipotle. This recipe takes sweet/heat to a whole new level!

I thought this was fabulous. I used the recipe in a company cook-off and it won best dessert and rave reviews from everyone who tried it. I added the chipotle very slowly and kept tasting to make sure I had the level of spice I wanted. I will definitely be making this again, especially anytime I want an easy dessert that's a little different and surprising.

Made the crust with Nyaker's ginger snaps, almost doubled the lime zest and added some extra sour cream for the filling, and glazed with apricot jam. We all agreed that this was one of the most incredible desserts we had ever consumed, and it was a party of gourmets who have lived and travelled all around the world. Two chipotles was perfect; the interplay of spiciness from them and the ginger crust against the extra-sweet pineapple (grilling caramelizes the sugars) and the cool, smooth sweetness of the cream was orgasm-inducing.

This dessert was every bit as scrumptious as I imagined it to be. I loved it, my guests all loved it. The pineapple looked so beautiful draped in a ribbony pattern. I definitely would make this again, and actually try some macadamia nuts in the crust, and maybe trying grilled mango! This is a great dessert for people who don't care for sweet desserts. I

My husband, two guests, and I all thought that this was excellent! I used 1/2 of a chipotle since our guests don't like things too spicy. But they loved this tart, and so did we.

The chipotle is what makes this dessert an either-love-or-hate-it-thing. Without the chipolte, this is an easy and reliably delicious tart. I guess I'm not that adventurous, because I have made this dessert twice -- both times without the chipotle -- and gotten rave reviews both times. The first time I made it with peaches because I'd just gotten some at a farmer's market. The second time I made it with the pineapple. I prefer the pineapple but both were good. The second time I made it, I doubled the lime zest and I think it's better that way. Another tip: Anna's Orange Thin Cookies make a great crust -- you can get the cookies at IKEA (they're Swedish) or at Safeway.

I wonder if this recipe has received some negative reviews because it is so new, so different, so exciting (challenging) to the palette? After eating it twice (once as a guest, once as the cook), I am convinced it is one of the most delicious and new foods I have had in years. If you want adventure (and plain old good taste), choose this dessert for your next party. Notes: I decided to forego the raspberries (unneeded) and used peach jam instead of apple.

STOP!!!!!!! Do not make this recipe!!!! This had to be the most disgusting dessert I have ever put in my mouth. I was intruiged by the flavor combination so, I decided to try it. I made it exactly as directed and it was unedible. We had to throw the whole thing out. Definately do not try this if you are entertaining. I am adventurous in my cooking and flavors, but this was just downright awful.

I had to try this intriguing recipe because of the peppers, but the experiment was a huge success. The tart turned out beautifully, exactly like the picture, and had a flavor not too sweet but definitely dessert-worthy with a fiesty little kick.

I was really excited when I saw this recipe -- I love the combination of spicy and sweet. What a disappointment...I ate the pineapple and threw the rest away.

This recipe is a case of trendy gone wrong! The flavors do not complement each oher. When sliced to 1/4-inch the pineapple slices are limp and tend to fall apart. All my gourmet eaters (who enjoy interesting foods) sent it back after 2 bites.

Wonderful! I made this for a barbeque last week. Instead of the apple jelly, I used Nervous Nellie's brand Jalapeno Jelly for the glaze. It was definitely spicy, but I like unusual combinations like this. You could probably halve the amount of chipotle in the cream base and still have a nice flavor. The crowd I served it to was evenly split - they either loved or hated it.

This is one of the best desserts I've had in a long time. I love the combination of hot and sweet. I served it to several friends, some of whom are not big hot food fans, and it was a huge hit. I did, however, double the chipotle cream portion of the recipe. When I make it again, I will also add some flavor and spice to the crust, perhaps some lemon zest and cayenne powder in the butter.

I was hoping this would be a new dessert to use for a large dinner party, but was disappointed. The cream was too spicy for a dessert. The directions didn't mention whether to assemble the crust and cream and then add the pineapple just off the grill or to do it all ahead. I did it all ahead and it did hold up nicely, but the flavors just weren't what I was hoping for.
