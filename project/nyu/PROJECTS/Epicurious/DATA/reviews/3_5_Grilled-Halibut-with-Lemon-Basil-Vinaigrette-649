I marinated as others suggested but by the time I was supposed to bbq I no longer felt like it (prepared this during the winter). I ended up searing it on the stovetop and then poured the vinaigrette over it and roasted it at 400 in the oven for 10 minutes or so. Amazing!

Excellent- I also marinated for 20 minutes and also added some white wine to the marinade- great, light recipe! It allowed the halibut to shine!

I thought this was excellent, and agree with the reviewer who suggested marinating the halibut in the vinaigrette for 20-30 minutes before grilling. Otherwise I didn't change a thing. A great summer meal.

Delicious, quick, easy, and very fresh tasting. I didn't have a lemon, but I had bottled lemon juice and an orange. So I used the bottled juice and zested an orange. The colors were quite pretty! I also used lime basil from my garden, which was terrific with the other citrus flavors.I would definitely make this again. It's company worthy, too.

I made it with a large halibut fillet my husband brought back from an Alaskan fishing trip. I followed some reviewers' suggestions of marinating it with half of the marinade for about 20 minutes prior to grilling. The only substitution I made was using grated lime peel for the lemon peel(and using bottled lemon juice for the fresh). It was simply delicious!!

Very easy, delicious and healthy! I have to admit I am a bit of a novice with fish and so get scared about whether or not it will be edible. I would feel very confident to make this again for myself or if I wanted to impress company. I would add extra capers. For my halibut fillet I ended up baking it in the oven at 375 for about 20 minutes in parchment. Will definitely make again! I did not have fresh basil so I used dried which was perfect. I made steamed broccoli as a side dish but I bet artichoke hearts would be wonderful as well. Loved it!

good flavor, but disagree with other reviewers and the need to double sauce and marinate. Perhaps my fillets were thinner, but marinating over 20 mins overpowers natural flavor of the fish.

This was probably the best fish dish I've ever made. Per other reviewer's suggestions, I doubled the marinade and added a tablespoon of lime juice, chopped cilantro, and one small shallot. I used halibut filets instead of steaks. I put the fish in parchment paper, put the marinade on top, and let them marinate for 30-45 minutes. I baked them in the sealed parchment paper at 375 degrees for 15 or so minutes (I'm not sure of the time, but I checked them at 8 and 15 minutes) took them out and let them sit in their own juices for a few more minutes. Served with grilled asparagus and zuccini and roasted potatoes. Excellent! Thank you for all the suggestions!

Very tasty. We followed other's advice and "marinated" the hali in the sauce for a couple of hours before grilling. We also tripled the sauce, and it went well on the basmati rice, and the chicken breasts we had the next day. We served the fish with the rice and barbequed asparagus - marvelous.

This was so, so, so yummy! I'm not a big fish person, so I try to find interesting ways to add fish to my diet. This really hit the spot. The halibut was flavorful, complex, light, citrus-y and satisfying. My husband made very happy yummy sounds as he ate dinner last night. Thanks to all who reviewed this one (I read them all) and helped create a lovely recipe. I really count on these reviews to steer me in the right direction. For this recipe, I took the advice of several others. I doubled the marinade, mixed it in a blender and added 1t. crushed red pepper flakes. No lemon handy for the peel, so I substituted a few drops of orange extract. I used the dried basil but next time I'll use fresh. I brushed half the marinade onto the filet and let it stand at room temp. about 30 min. I used my George Foreman indoor grill instead of a BBQ. I brushed the remaining marinade onto the cooked fish and served it with Basmati rice, a crisp salad and cold sesame-asparagus spears. LOVED it.

A note to the cook from Texas and anyone else who cares: broiling fish is tantamount to serving shoe leather. Ask any good fish monger. So, yes, it absolutely made a difference when you broiled rather than grilled. I intended to make this on my charcoal grill when an electrical storm moved me inside double quick! I pan seared the fish and the meal was lovely, if a bit different than intended. My husband doesn't like capers, so I used a bit of kosher salt and more lemon zest and we didn't miss the little green buggers at all.

I used salmon and doubled the vinaigrette. Following other's advice, I marinated the fish for 30mins and saved half of the sauce for afterwards. Next time I am going to use more basil and lemon but slightly less garlic and oil. The taste combinations weren't phenomenal, but it had a light, summery taste that was nice.

Rating: 4
I just made this tonight for a summer BBQ. I used halibut fillet with skin, which was helpful for grilling (I put the flesh side down first then flipped it onto the skin side down - made it easier to remove from grill as you can leave the skin behind). I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

Dish can be 4 forks if you: - add 1 tbsp. ancho chili (or any chili) flakes in vinaigrette -make 3 times the amount of vinaigrette -use lots of shallots and very little garlic -marinate the fish for 20 minutes and leave fish out at room temp. for 20 minuites prior to grilling -use ahlf of the vinaigrette as a marinade, half for spooning over fish when served

Very easy to make, very light...would only work with a mild fish like halibut. I'd say it's strictly a summertime recipe because the fresh basil is what made it a bit more substantial. Using the recipe as a beginning, I do think that making it with lime and mango would be tasty also.

I followed the advice of the Montana review and pureed this (with the capers). I made all the sauce but only had 1 large salmon & 1 large halibut steak. It was just the right amount so I would double the recipe if I was making 4 filets. I used all the sauce as a marinade and let it sit for about 30 minutes. I didn't read the recipe carefully enough and leave some as a sauce for afterwards. Surprisingly, the halibut was totally bland. You could barely taste the marinade which was disappointing. The salmon was great - it picked up the flavours better. I might have rated the recipe higher if I had drizzled some sauce on afterwards. I'll give it a second chance. I made this with a bulgar pilaf and broccoli. Nice light meal.

Rating: 2
I used tilapia for this recipe, and followed the advice of others by marinating the fish before putting it under the broiler. I left the garlic almost whole in the marinade and in the oven, and it added a distinct flavor without being overpowering. All in all, this was good. I think I'll experiment with it in the future...maybe try varying the spices?

Nice, but not spectacular. I doubled the sauce, marinated the halibut for awhile and cooked in on the Weber grill. Had never made halibut on the grill; it was soft and good. Served with bulgar pilaf and a combo of white zucchini and red pepper. Extra sauce was nice on the bulgar.

I think that the sauce should be pureed in a blender or some such. The use of capers made it difficult to brush over the fish and the flavors may be more evenly distributed that way. Served it with asparagus and long grain rice - delicious meal!

This vinagrette was really piquant, so I added a dash of honey, some fresh orange juice, and a tad more extra virgin olive oil, and more capers. With those additions,it was okay, even liked it. I marinated the halibut in orange juice, olive oil, and the suggested amount of the vinagrette. With those additions to the recipe, yes I would make it again. I guess I don't like really astringent sauces for fish, and that is what this vinagrette started out to be.

Great taste!! First attempt the fish stuck to the grill even after spraying with PAM. Now I place it on a square vegatable grill basket with a teflon coating and also spray it with PAM. It was a snap to turn and get out. We love capers and lemon, it's deffinately one of our favorites.

After living in Alaska for a couple of years, I thought I'd had Halibut every way but frozen. After a recent return to Alaska for a fishing trip supplied us with 40 pounds of fillets, I started looking for new variations. This version was so good I fixed again the same week for a larger group - Fresh lemon juice is essential as is careful grilling - too cooked too long and it might as well be a tough piece of chicken. Garlic mashed potatoes was a good side.

This receipe has almost the exact same ingredients as Halibut with Caper-Basil Vinaigrette, which was in the Oct. 94 issue of Bon Appetit.
