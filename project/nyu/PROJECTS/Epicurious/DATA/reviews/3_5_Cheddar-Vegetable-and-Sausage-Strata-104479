this was good but not great. I used a leftover kielbasa and felt that a better spicier sausage would have improved the dish.

Rating: 4
I also added some leftover sauteed mushrooms from previous evening dinner. Subbed about 1/4 cup purple onion, finely chopped instead of dried onion; used about 4 nice basil leaves instead of dried. Also fine diced the sausage pieces (quartered a piece of sliced sausage.) Added a dollop of sour cream to top of each piece.

I make this every year for our new year's brunch and it's always a bit hit. I use some roasted garlic chicken sausage instead of the smoked sausage and vidalia onions if I can get them.

This was wonderful. I left the bread/egg batter refridgerated overnight. This turned out wonderful.

This is another dish I've made twice, and may not make again. My particular experience with it wasn't dry; in fact, it was more on the soft/soggy side (I made it with rather fresh homemade bread, so that could have been the culprit). The topping to bread ratio was off, reminding me in both flavor and texture, of an anemic pizza.

Rating: 4
Excellent breakfast dish. My modifications were pretty extensive. I added 2 additional eggs and used about half the cream. Instead of basil I used herbs de provence.Instead of bell pepper, minced onion, cherry tomatoes and smoked sausage I used: 1 whole onion which I carmelized, about 3/4 c. chopped sun dried tomatoes (not oil packed), crumbled and cooked package of spicy turkey sausage, and a couple of jalepenos which I roasted, peeled and chopped. Kept the cheese the same. Huge hit.

This was delicious!! An excellent option for entertaining week-end guests. Can be made ahead- easy prep.A definite keeper.

loved this! made it on a whim because I had a lot of leftover sliced bread from a dinner party the night before. I made a few changes based on the ingredients I had on hand and I would do it the same way next time. 1. I used half cheddar cheese and half Gouda and Parano cheese. 2. I substituted hot italian sausage out of the casing which I browned first. 3. I used Roasted red peppers from a jar and added some zucchini to the vegetables. 4. Finally I only let the bread soak in the custard for an hour and a half but I did it at room temperature. Turned out fantastic.

I've made this recipe for several ski trip getaways - always to rave reviews. A great breakfast before hitting the slopes in Tahoe. I usually use Italian sausage out of the casings, browned before spreading in on top with the other goodies.

Rating: 2
This was okay, but it was dry. I found more bread was needed to fill the casserole, so added more eggs and half & half, but it didn't do the trick. And the kielbasa was ordinary. The tomatoes are a nice touch, though. I might add them to the top of the more traditional make-ahead strata (cubed bread with milk and eggs poured over and crumbled sausage and cheese sprinkled atop) that I like better.

Rating: 3
Thought the seasonings in this dish were EXCELLENT. Pretty much divided the original recipe in half. Subbed feta (3 oz.) for the cheddar cheese, ham for the sausage, and red for the green bell pepper. Also, put 2-1/2 English muffins (split & toasted) at the bottom of an 8-1/2 by 4-1/2 inch glass loaf pan. Could only chill it about 2 hours. It took a bit longer to bake than the original recipe states because of the depth of the egg mixture. DELICIOUS, and it looked just like in the picture. (Did taste a bit like pizza, a GOOD one!!)

I made this exactly as written, except used a mix of red and green bell peppers. I brought it to a Boy Scout leader breakfast and got rave reviews - many people had seconds. Easy to make - I got everything ready and chopped up the night before, so just had to sprinkle on the toppings and pop it in the oven.

Rating: 3
This is a great strata! (I'm not sure why a previous reviewer called it "rubbery." The texture is perfect.) I've increased the eggs to six. And, because I'm more pressed for time in the morning, I've found that an hour of soaking is really all you need. This is extremely popular with our guests. Everyone comments favorably and it totally disappears! Considering vegetarians, I exclude the kielbasa (it's plenty flavorful without it) and sprinkle with whichever fresh herbs I have on hand.

I made this again the other day and I have a suggestion- if you're in a hurry, replace the tomatoes, bell peppers, and the onions in this recipe with one can of Rotelle Diced Tomatoes with Chilis (make sure to drain the liquid). It adds a tiny bit of spiciness while eliminating the chopping. My guests loved it!

Rating: 4
Although I've only made two strata recipes from this site, I find this dish to be MUCH better than the Goat Cheese, Artichoke and Ham Strata recipe. This was delicious. Makes an excellent breakfast/brunch dish. I used thinner slices of bread and baked the dish 20 minutes longer. This ensured that the bread at the bottom wasn't too soggy- which was my main complaint with the other strata dish (no matter how long I cooked it, it was still too soggy). The combination of ingredients in this dish was delicious and colorful. Really an excellent recipe.

Rating: 3
Really pretty tasty. Also easy to make and can be prepared ahead with no problems. I followed the recipe as written, but I think it would lend itself to a lot of good variation, too. This will definitely go into rotation.

I agree with a previous reviewer that the kielbasa is the key. When serving, I topped my strata with sliced avacado and a dallop of guacamole salsa. Very good!

This recipe is FOOLPROOF!!! If you prep everything the night before it makes it incredibly easy. Don't be tempted to make more custard as it makes the final product too gluey. Made this 4-5 times, always to rave reviews!

This rating comes from my husband. I made it for him to take to work and didn't get to taste it. That was a good sign, he said it went quickly! I substituted fresh basil for the dried and used a little more of course; I used red bell pepper which wasn't as pretty, but we much prefer the taste of red; and I used about 1/4 cup of chopped onion instead of 2 tablespoons minced. It was a good recipe for making ahead, and I'm looking forward to trying it myself.

Rating: 4
Raves all around on this one and it makes great leftovers. The cherry tomatoes really make this dish. Due to my procrastination that morning, I eliminated the sausage and bell pepper and baked uncovered for about 30 minutes uncovered @ 400. I also used fresh basil and shallots instead of dried basil and onion. Can't wait to make the full recipe when I wake up a little earlier next time. ;-)

Rating: 2
The amount of custard is just right. It takes time for the bread to soak in the custard uniformly. Any more custard and it will come out soggy. Although the taste was good, I found it to be too heavy.

I hated this recipe. After baking it for 20 extra minutes, it was still soggy and mushy. The eggs, cheese and sausage was all too much.

I made this dish for my family this Christmas morning and it was amazing! we all loved it. I did add some extra kielbasa and used sharp white cheddar cheese and red bell peppers. We even ate it the next day for left overs. It was very easy to prepare and everything could be ready the day before.

Rating: 3
I would add though that the cooking time on this seems real variable. I would certainly make it again but only when guests have time to lounge around and wait potentially longer than expected.

Rating: 4
this is a great easy dish. I cannot stop picking at it! I mixed the egg mixture right in the pyrex pan to avoid cleaning another dish and then soaked the bread. I used a much smaller pan so that made the egg custard go the distance. I cooked it for just over the reccomended amount and it is delicious. the half and half almost acts like the butter (I put a little extra in) and the crunchy pieces on the bottom come out when cooled. I used cooked low fat sausage and organge peper for some more color. Great cold morning breakfast!!

I agree with Philadelphia...not nearly enough custard. I needed 4 more eggs to make the custard work.

This was disappointing. Using the size dish and the 1" slices of bread called for, there was not nearly enough custard. I also thought the base was too bland to go well with kielbasa. There are better strata recipes on this site.

I made this according to the recipe, except I used breakfast sausage that I pre-cooked, and added mushrooms. Didn't like the tomato's at all.

Overall terrific & beautiful in a buffet. Agree with others about accepting risk when making changes, but still enjoy hearing how people modify recipes. That's what cooking is all about. I used a baguette (skinnier), so need lots more slices and was "crustier" but still yummy. Maybe I could increase the custard. Also doubled sausage and used 1/2 yellow bell (for color) and 1/2 poblano(for taste). Yummy. Serves way more than 6.

We really enjoyed this dish, and it was really easy. The smoked sausage was a little off-putting for breakfast, however, so next time I will likely use bacon, ham, or breafast sauasage in its place.

Bravo, Ron and all the others who have had it with the folks who use substitions and then trash the recipe! I write a local food column and have always told my readers that they can substitute at their own peril, remembering that the prefix, "sub", means "below" or "beneath".

i really liked this dish and so did my guests. since the recommended portions were a bit large for my number of guests, i decided to make this in a round ceramic dish and could therefore cut the pieces into nice wedges. i also used challah bread but only used about 4 slices. i ended up buttering the bottoms of the slices. i also added chicken apple sausage, green onion, purple onion and artichoke hearts (a nice contrast to the sweetness of the chicken apple sausage). i would definitely make this again because i assembled everything the night before and then baked the next morning.

Adding my two cents' worth on the low fat/substitions debate. It does bug me a wee bit when people use low-fat substitions and then aren't happy with the results - I figure you get what you deserve if you think there is such a thing as no-fat substitute for half-and-half CREAM - BUT I'm all for substitions and comments on them. Sometimes the substitions suggested are a hell of lot more pratical, or they just happen to be what I too have in fridge.

My sister made this dish for New Years day brunch and it was fantastic. We did all of the prep work the day before. We sliced all of the veggies and kielbasa ahead and stored in ziplock bags. The french bread soaked in the egg mixture over night. All we had to do was spinkle the toppings on and bake. This has become a must have bruch dish with our family.

In reply to the review posted by Ron Newsome, I wanted to let people know my experience with the low-fat products I used with this recipe. Hopefully, people will now know not to use low-fat products with this recipe. Some recipes on this site are good with low-fat products and others are not, so I believe that interested people should have the right to an informed opinion. If you read the site's instructions on rating and reviewing recipes, it allows for substitutions and tips. I believe I gave this recipe a fair rating based on using low-fat products.

Very good recipe. And I agree with Ron Newsome. I too am getting a little tired of the health Nazis who believe that a single gram of fat is going shorten their lives by years (although in their case we could only be so lucky!). The key here is moderation. Obviously, if you eat like this constantly you'll likely suffer ill effects, but surely a periodic pig out fest is ok. Besides, if you constantly worry about counting fat the stress of such a fixation will result in a massive coronary by the age of forty!

This is a message to the Cook from Yardley, PA and others like him/her. It's really unfair when people like you purposely change the recipe and then give it a low rating based on your changes and not on the original. It gives the original recipe a false rating. THE RATING SYSTEM IS USED TO RATE THE ORIGINAL AND NOT YOUR SCREWED UP CONCOCTIONS! If you had tried the given recipe first, then you might or might not would have liked it, but at least you would've given it a fair rating!

I added a minced garlic clove, 1 tsp Tabasco and fresh ground black and Szechwan pepper to the custard. I used roasted sweet red pepper strips and seeded (and dried) Roma tomato strips.

I made this recipe at the last minute, so I sliced the bread very thin (thinking the egg would have less to soak into. It worked o.k., but ideally thicker slices makes the bottom nice and crunchy.

I just have to remember to make it the night before!

I made this Christmas morning for my family, and they just loved it. I was quite thankful it was something I could easily put together the night before, then just add some stuff and pop it in the oven the next morning. I used smoked Italian sausage and Italian seasoning. (My sister in law's kitchen...couldn't find the basil!) I think this would be an easy recipe to halve, and you could have some for yourself the next morning! Oh, and I do think next time I make this, I'll use something other than French bread, such as challah. A winner!

Very flavorful and colorful. I thought the combination of vegetables and sausage worked very well. I used shallots instead of onion and like the idea of sauteeing first. But I would just saute for a brief time - I liked the crunch of the peppers. My husband liked the light texture - not totally "eggy".

Rating: 2
Very easy recipe, however, it lacked in flavor; I would choose small strips of roma tomatoes over the cherry tomatoes. I'ved used a recipe similar to this one and the sausage is put in w/the egg mixture at the beginning & sits over night, which produced more flavor. Green peppers were flavorful on their own + adds color.

Rating: 4
I used 1/2 of a medium onion, minced, and I browned the sausage then sauteed the bell pepper and onion in the drippings. This added even more rich taste to an already flavorful dish. I'm going to surprise my sister with this over the holidays. She's an excellent cook and I know she will be as impressed with this dish as I was!
