I followed the recipe exactly and my only regret is that I didn't have guests that night. Perfection.

I prepared only the lamb. This is a delicious, classic recipe, using simple ingredients on hand in a weekend condo kitchen. Deboning and preparing the lamb shoulder took a bit of time. I used wood skewers soaked in water before grilling. Good enough for company. Saved this to my recipe file. Served with a rice pilaf and green salad which worked well.

The lamb was tasty, but the vegetable combo was nothing special, and the dressing had far too much lemon juice. I used lamb from leg steaks, not the shoulder blade chops, which I find too tedious to cut up. I marinated it at room temperature for about an hour, which worked out very well. Next time I'll grill this with red peppers, sweet onions and tomatoes.
