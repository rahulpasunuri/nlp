This recipe is okay...tasty and very easy to prepare but seemed to be a bit dry. I added lemon zest to the breadcrumb mixture and some additional salt which helped the flavor but it needed more fat. I will try again but first coat the scallops in olive oil and then top with breadcrumbs.

The first time I made this recipe I used about 2/3 of a cup of Panko and no tarragon. It came out great, though I agree with another reviewer that it would be better if the scallops were tossed in the bread crumb mixture prior to baking. The second time I made it I used a full cup of Italian breadcrumbs and it came out awful. Too breadcrumby, to dry, too sandy... So, bottom line, use less breadcrumbs, more spice and Panko if you can find it!!!

I gave this 4 forks because of it's simplicity and great taste. I followed advice of other reviewers by mixing the breadcrumbs, using baguette with crust and adding a bit of white wine to the mix before baking. Served with whole grain pasta and broccoli with butter, lemon zest and juice. A great way to use frozen bay scallops.

I omitted the taragon. It is way too stong for delicate scallops. It was too dry I think because the soft bread crumbs absorbed all the butter. I will try again and sprinkle scallops with about 1/3 cup of dry seasoned bread crumbs or buttery cracker crumbs and pour butter over the scallops before baking. If anyone gets a chance to try this, let me know.

This was very good, but I used sea scallops halved horizontally instead of bay scallops, and used thyme and tarragon instead of parsley and tarragon, and increased the cooking time by about 2 minutes to account for the larger scallops. I also did not remove the crust from the French bread before turning it into crumbs in the food processor, and I can't understand why anyone would???? In any case my husband loved it.

Like a previous reviewer said, this is better if the scallops are tossed with the bread crumbs instead of topped with them. For my second try I used Ritz crackers and unsalted butter instead of french bread. (an old New England style seafood stuffing). But the basic recipe is good and the timing of the scallops is just right.

This was very easy and very nice. I would give it a 2.5 forks. It was very breadcrumby; next time I will add less, bu about a quarter. I also added an extra clove of garlic, doubled the butter, and about a 1/4 of a cup of wine to the bottom of the glass-bottom pan. A great during the week meal.

I used Italian bread crumbs, so it was a little too salty. I'm thinking that this would be better with the scallops just tossed in the bread crumb mixture.

I thought this recipe was excellent. Like some other reviewers, I used Panko breadcrumbs. In trying to make this recipe lower fat I used a fraction of the amount of butter called for. I actually used a lower fat butter spread to brown the breadcrumbs with great success. I grated some lemon zest into the crumb mixture and used minced chives and dill. Used nonstick spray in the pie pan. I will make this again and again. So easy!

We all liked this. Yes it's a little dry, but I rather liked it this way. I thought the kids would at least eat it, and so they did (mostly). Many thanks to the previous reviewer for the breadcrumb freezing suggestion! I never thought of doing this but it's a great idea.

My husband and I both thought it was dry and bland. I think I would add more herbs or lemon to the recipe next time. Took advice to sear the scallops briefly first; would do that again, but perhaps add lemon juice. Used Panko crumbs, maybe should have used homemade breadcrumbs.

We like garlic so much that I took one reviewer's suggestion of using extra garlic. The garlic ended up over-powering the mild flavor of the scallops. Next time, I'll use the recommended 1 clove. You can just put the scallops between layers of a kitchen towel to get excess water out of them.

A guest prepared this dish for a potluck wine-tasting party I attended last weekend, and it was one of the best scallop recipes I have tasted. She added a bit of clam juice to moisten the dish a bit, and served the dish garnished with lemon zest instead of the lemon wedges suggested in the recipe.

drain the scallops first...I thought it was the right amount of garlic, crumbs, and I added some hot paprika to the crumbs. No lemon but I had some lime. Really fresh scallops make the difference...do not crowd in the baking dish. Served with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli with fresh parmesan cheese shaves. YUM!

To the cook from Easton - I haven't made this exact dish - but if you want to reduce the amount of liquid, try searing the scallops for about one minute per side in olive oil ina saute pan before baking, then reduce the baking time in half. Good luck.

I liked this and will make again. My scallops released a lot of liquid, making the topping mushier than I would have liked. Any suggestions out there?

Delicious! The only change I make is to increase the garlic to 2 gigantic cloves. I find French bread lacking in flavor, so I use very good quality crumbs from sourdough or a rosemary peasant loaf we like. (Leftover bread from a dinner gets put through the food processor--sans crusts--then put in zipper bags, labeled and frozen. When you need it for a recipe it's ready).

Really good dish for being so easy and quick to make.

This was good but a little dry. I think with a little adjustment, this could be better. I think it calls for too much breadcrumbs and not enough butter. The next time I make this, I will try it with only 3/4 cup breadcrumbs, and 3-4 Tablespoons butter. I think it would be a great improvement, as this recipe has great potential.

I was going to give this 3 forks, but partner said it was a 4, so I guess 3.5. Very easy and delicious. Only cooked for 7.5 minutes, and that was plenty. Next time I would like to find fresh tarrogon.
