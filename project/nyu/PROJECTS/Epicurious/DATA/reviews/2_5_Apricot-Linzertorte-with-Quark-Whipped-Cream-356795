Wow, I don't have words to describe this taste treat. The contrast between the cream and torte playing in your mouth is delightful. I don't understand why the rating is so low at 1.5 forks. It will take some time I suppose but really now, it is worth it.

This crust is horrible. It has the texture of...Mt. Rushmore, perhaps? There's *crisp* or *crunchy*, and then there's THIS, which appears to be the vehicle for a mouthful of jam. If I wanted that, I could have just taken a spoon out of the drawer and gone to it. I could even finish this, it was so disappointing. :-p

I had the same problem making the crust mentioned above. The baking time is too long. It is frustrating that Bon Appetit can't vet their own recipes to make sure of simple things like oven time. Who has the time to make something twice due to other people's errors? I obviously should have read these comments earlier. I gave up and tossed out the bottom crust and made small cookies with the balance of the dough formed in tiny tartlet pans and added in some apricot jam on top. They worked fine but I monitored the oven time closely. the dough is tasty baked as a cookie but I am happy I didn't have to deal with piping it around the pan in the original creation.

There are two huge errors in the recipe and for that reason, I am only giving two forks. Once corrected, this is a delicious and elegant dessert which is wonderful to serve at a formal dinner party and especially with the "Austrian Menu" of which it's a part in Bon Apetit magazine. The errors are in the baking time (75 minutes in total)..... 35 minutes for the base crust and then another 40 minutes after adding the filling and lattice is way, way too much and results in a dry, hard, and too-dark product. The first time I made this I followed the instructions to the letter and was very disappointed by the dry, hard result. I gave it one more try and reduced significantly each of the separate baking times. So, I did 20 minutes for the base crust and another 25 minutes for the filling and lattice for a total baking time of 45 minutes. This resulted in a very delightful and delicious result. I'm very disappointed in the lack of quality control and proof-reading at Bon Apetit magazine. If they had made this recipe as-written just once in a test kitchen, the baking-time errors would have been obvious. Another tip is to forget about the quark and use 100% whipped cream. The quark lends a sharp, sour taste which is not to everyone's liking. 2 forks as written, 3 forks with baking-time correction.

Overall, it wasn't bad. It's probably not something I would make for guests. The presentation turned out fine; the taste, however, just wasn't spectacular.It was interesting, though, and here's why: the cinnamon, cloves and chocolate combined nicely with the hazelnuts and apricot, creating a good flavor balance in which none of the flavors overpowered another. The chocolate was, in and of itself, undetectable. The challenging part was trying to pipe the "batter" (a better word is "dough") through a pastry bag; even at room temperature, it was too firm to pipe without breakage. Solution: if you have a plastic tip (or just the coupling), microwave the batter/dough for about 10-15 seconds, which helps to maintain the strips for the lattice/cris-cross pattern...

I had a little trouble with this. It may be due to my ingredients. The picture showed puffed, light colored lattice. Once I added the 2 tsp cocoa my dough was somewhat dark. Could it be because my cocoa was dutch process extra dark? Also, my dough was rather dry and not conducive to piping as it somewhat broke/fell apart during this process and did not puff much during baking. I used 10 oz ground hazelnuts from Switzerland and I am wondering if this affected the recipe. Hopefully it tastes okay

This is a great dessert. I made it for Christmas dinner this year(this would also be good for breakfast) Since i don't like Hazelnuts, i used pecans instead. I only had a 9" springform pan, so i suggest using less batter on your bottom layer, as mine came out a little too thick. Piping the lattice pattern made for a great finished product. Dusted with powdered sugar and a dollup of whipped cream (could not find Quark so i used plain yogurt and cream). I will definately make this again, and try blackberry jam instead of apricot.
