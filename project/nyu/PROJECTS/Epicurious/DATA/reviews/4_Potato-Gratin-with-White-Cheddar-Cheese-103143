Such a great dish. Made exactly as written the first time and then used thyme instead of rosemary the second time. Both were equally as good. It is rich and takes a while to make, but is definitely worth it. Not complicated, just need to make sure you allow time for the potatoes to cook completely.

Wow, this was wonderful! Very easy to make, and the rosemary and shallots gave it such a good flavor. I made a half-recipe in an 8 x 8 dish and found that it was ready about 15 minutes before the 1 hour and 45 minutes stated in the recipe. This isn't the kind of dish you eat every day, but highly recommended for a special occasion.

This was absolutely delicious!! I only had a 1/2 cup whipping cream left so I used half & half for the other 2 cups and I couldn't distinguish a difference. Make sure you use FRESH Rosemary. I only had dried and it was definitely missing the fresh rosemary taste. I ended up using about 3 cups of cheese. I served it with the Coffee and Beer steaks from this site. Delicious dinner!

Wow. Creamy, cheesy and insanely rich. Everything I want in au gratin potatoes. This will be my go to recipe. Used irish white cheddar and it was awesome. The cream really is what gives them the great consistancy, so splurge. Its not like you eat them every day, though I could...

Made this for Christmas dinner as written except used 1/2 cup of milk for part of the cream and some Jarlsberg with the cheddar. We were pressed for time so I started them in the microwave for 20 minutes covered with plastic wrap, then finished uncovered in the oven for another 20 minutes or so. Delicious and very rich - made the full recipe for 5 people, we ate less than 1/2 (mmm, leftovers!!)

Only roughly followed the recipe so will not rate it. Layered potato slices with salt, pepper, cheddar cheese and then added milk up to the first layer of potatoes. A little butter. This recipe helped me because I always undercooked the potatoes before. Cooking for one hour covered and 45 minutes uncovered did the trick! Thanks!

Rating: 4
Excellent. I was worried that there was going to be too much liquid, but after standing for 10 minutes, the consistency was great. I used 2 c. heavy cream and 1/2 c. 2% milk. Didn't impact texture at all. Next time I will try even more milk vs. cream. I also added a bit of Parm/Romano mix to the top as the cheese seemed sparse. Everyone loved these. I assembled the night before and took out of fridge one hour before cooking.

I used 2/3c of cream and chicken broth for balance of the liquid. Used Boars Head white cheddar. I used a mandoline and cut very thin. I was pressed for time, so I microwaved for a while and then put into the oven. It seemed to have excessive liquid. I think it was because I sliced the potatoes so thin that I ended up with 3 layers and quite a few unused slices. I should have adjusted accordingly. I just removed some of the liquid and finished with a final sprinkling of cheddar and put it under he broiler. This dish turned out to be very tasty and I'm not even a potato fan. I wanted to try my new mandoline and my family begs for potatoes. I'll make it again for sure.

This dish has become a staple for my family Thanksgiving, in fact we call it my "famous Potoates". I think it's best using super fresh Rosemary and I've had the best luck baking it ahead of time and then heating it back up on the day of. Plus, I made it in several smaller batches instead of one big one, always a hit!

Rating: 4
I made this last night with just a few alterations. I used 1/2 c cream and 2 c chicken broth. Cooked the potatos in this broth mixture for 12 minutes then put in the oven for only 30. It turned out great! It was rich but can't imagine it being any better with all cream! Also went a little quicker starting on the stovetop-it left behind the perfect amount of sauce.

I made this last night and it was a definite winner. The flavors were sublime. I didn't think I would like the rosemary in it but all the flavors really worked together. This is such a great make ahead dish. I assembled it the night before and baked it the next day. It was perfect.

Rating: 3
Very good, guests loved it. To answer some questions, yes, you can eliminate the cream. I added 1 tablespoon corn starch to 2.5 cups 2% milk, as I could not bring myself to use so much additional fat over the cheese. Living in Arizona, the idea of heating up the kitchen for 1 3/4 hours was not appealing either. I put it together and microwaved for 25 minutes, ahead of time and then reheated in the oven for about 45 minutes. Worked well.

I am going to make this later on this week and in reading the reviews I'm wondering.. what about cutting the cream with chicken broth to lighten it up, but keep the flavor?

YUM! I substituted half & half for the heavy cream. Ran out of shallots so used regular onion very finely diced, only about 1/2 to 2/3 cup. Otherwise followed recipe, then topped w/ grated pecorino romano. It came out great and leftovers are even better!

There's alot of fat in this recipe which makes it tasty, but a little too greasy. The shallots are important as I think regular onions would be too much. I'd make it again, but probably use some half and half mixed with the heavy cream.

I made this for Christmas for a very picky family. Turned out to be a big hit! Used onions instead of shallots and dried rosemary instead of fresh.

I have made this recipe since it first came out. My family always request that I bring this over the holidays. Good aged cheddar is the secret. I have done many variations and all of them are a hit. I have replaced the rosemary with dill...equally as good. I usually end up using just a bit more cream than the recipe calls for. Also try adding mixed Italian cheeses sprinkled on top(the asiago, fontina,parmesan blend) yummmmmm

This recipe was just OK to me. I followed everything exactly, down to the pan size and found that it wasn't as spectacular as others raved. I thought it needed more cheese and salt.

I made this last night for Valentine's Day and would definitely make it again. The fresh rosemary flavor was delicious with the shallots. Mine was a bit on the greasy side, so next time I think I'll cut back on the cream. By the next day it had separated a bit, but the flavor was even better. I would agree that presentation is the best right from oven to table, but the flavors are better over time. Adding kosher salt is a must.

Great recipe! A vegetable slicer makes this much easier than slicing potatoes with a knife, plus you get evenly sliced potatoes that cook to perfection when the recipe is followed exactly.

I made this recipe with roasted cornish game hens - my husband and I both loved it! I made it again for guests recently, and they also loved the flavor.

I have now made this recipe 4 times and it has been a winner each time. I would not suggest bringing it to a potluck, however, as the oil from the cheese and the cream separates. It doesn't look nearly as appetizing as when you take it out of the oven and serve it right away. Also, the better the cheese you use, the better the dish will be. The last time I made it, I used a 5 year aged cheddar and it was unbelievable!

I have made this gratin many times, including Thanksgiving the past two years. I have also served it with the honey glazed rack of lamb on this site for the most successful dinner party I've ever thrown. Even when it doesn't come out perfect, it's still delicious. But I agree that you shouldn't use half and half and you shouldn't bake ahead. I've tried both. However, you can get away with assembling the gratin the night before and putting it in the fridge until you are ready to bake it.

This smells great while it's cooking, looks beautiful and tastes great. A warning for those (like me) who are still learning in the kitchen: DO NOT bake ahead and reheat these, as the cream and cheese break down into an oily coating.

This was an absolute hit at the potluck. With so few ingredients you have to make sure you use quality items. don't skimp on the vintage white cheddar, use real cream (if you read the ingredient list a lot of cheaper brands use part cream, skim milk, and corn syrup and carrageenan to thicken.) I don't agree that the shallots should be carmelized first...the dish is in the oven such a long time, and the onions are put on last, so they caramize anyway. I only used 1 tsp of rosemary as I think that is a very strong herb. Sage is a good substitute herb for this dish.

Rating: 4
I've made this Gratin multiple times following the recipe exactly. I've always received rave reviews. It is important to use AGED Sharp Cheddar as it will melt into a more creamy texture than fresh cheddar cheese. Not positive, but the cheese may have been the cause of the curdling.

Rating: 3
I agree, the shallots need to be caramalized beforehand, and you should not use packaged, shredded cheese, which has an anti-caking agent in it, and well, is just absolutely disgusting. Get with the Slow Food Movement people. It isn't that hard. Use good english farmhouse cheddar, or aged USA and I will give it 4 fork, which is high for myself. Everyone asks for this recipe!

I love the taste of onions; however, either 3/4 cup is too much for me or I had some really strong shallots! I made this using the exact recipe and, to me, this would have been bland without the shallots. I prefer the "Scalloped Potatoes with Goat Cheese and Herbes de Provence".

Man, this is a rich dish. I read the recipe wrong and with the time change, only had an hour to prepare it...comedy of errors. I omitted the rosemary because of picky eaters. I hashed the potatoes up in my food processor without peeling and made the recipe as written from there, but baked it at 400 for an hour uncovered.

Yum! I did not quite have all the ingredients in the house, and it was pouring rain outside... so I made a few minor changes. I used sauteed onions and garlic rather than shallots, and sage instead of rosemary. I serevd the dish with lamb and rosemary sausages and baked sunburst squash (the small, roundish, yellow kind that have a taste reminiscent of zucchini)... very tasty! to those people who use light cream in place of whipping cream, be aware that by its nature it can curdle, and it often imparts an odd flavour. Be decadent and cook this recipe the way it was intended! You can always prepare something like a vegan soup or chili the next night!

I had to laugh at the cook from Memphis. THere are some recipes that you can't make lower in fat and have it turn out equally well - this is just one of them, so don't try. When you substitute half and half for heavy cream, you will get curdling. The half and half is processed differently than the heavy cream and that's why it should never curdle. Just enjoy - maybe take a smaller portion if you can resist!

This dish smelled wonderful while baking. The taste was okay---but not memorable. I also found that the cream/half & half mixture (I substituted some to cut down on fat) curdled.

Simple, tasty dish. Even my mother who hates cheese enjoyed this creamy gratin. I halved the recipe and still had more than enough for our family. As others have done, I made more layers than the suggested two and drizzled the cream mixture between each layer. Additionally, I prepared this the night before and then cooked it the next day - turned out fine with no curdling and a nice crusty top.

Absolutely love this dish !!! It has become a family favorite, and I am often asked prior to dinner parties "Are you bringing your potatoes". Instead of shallots, I use leeks - and it's just as good, if not better.

Haven't tried this recipe yet, but a tip, to avoid the mixture curdling,don't rinse the potatoes, the starch seems to solve the problem when using cream!

Like others, I found that 4 lbs. of potatoes didn't fit in the dish. Would cutback to 3 lbs. of potatoes for a 13x9 dish and reduce the liquid. A little too runny.....but delicious.

Super easy with the food processor! However, half the potatoes did not all fit in one layer as suggested. I made about 4 layers of potatoes and put the cheese in between each one. Next time I would use a ladle and drizzle the cream mixture between each layer also because all the shallots ended up on top of the casserole. Also, I baked this halfway through the night before and finished the baking with the foil off the next day before serving.

Looked great but when you dig in it is all curdled. First time making scalloped potatoes and didn't like how it looked once passed the crusty layer. Was delicious and everyone enjoyed it with turkey.

I used the advice of a previous review and added smoked gouda. This was a notable and spectacular addition. I substituted the cream for half and half and it was still extremely rich. ultmately satisfying.

Great potato dish. The key to making this is early preparation (especially for doubling or trippling recipe). I made for Mother's Day and didn't prep anything before, what a last minute rush. Next time around I shredded the cheese, cut the rosemary and shallots, peeled and sliced potatoes and kept in cold ice water before so that just before cooking I assembled everything.

We made this the other night and it was a great success, especially since our guests are all good cooks! We added smoked gouda to the cheddar and it added a nice flavor.

We loved this recipe!!! I added some leftover Easter ham to the middle layer (I reduced the salt) and it was wonderful!!!

I made two au gratins for an Easter feast, this one and one with goat cheese. For this one, I just scrubbed the potatoes well and left the skins on. I used a good, sharp yellow cheddar because I wanted the color, and I understand that the color has nothing to do with the taste. Finally, I added a handful of chopped, sauted pancetta for a little extra taste. Baked half-way, covered, earlier in the day. Refrigerated. Then finished off uncovered just before dinner. I personally liked the goat cheese one better, but there was less of this one left over at the end of the night. Don't worry if it looks a little curdled before removing the foil, all that bakes off and browns up during the second portion of baking. Run under the broiler for a minute or two if you have to.

First time I made it I followed the recipe and found it OK. Second time, I substituted smoked Gouda cheese for the cheddar (also whole milk for the cream)--served it for company and all thought it was the best potato dish they had ever experienced. BTW--I've been subscribing to Bon Apetit for many years and I work though all their recipes. First time I cared to write a review.

I served these potatoes with our Easter feast and everyone thought they were fantastic! This is a great dish to make ahead of time. I assembled the dish the night before and cooked them the next morning. The presentation was beautiful and the aroma was heavenly! I will definitely make this dish again!

Very good! We (my wife helped a lot)stayed pretty much with the recipe. It is rich, but our company was as pleased as we were. The only thing we might try differently next time is using a more aged cheddar. We had 12 month aged white cheddar, it would probably be better to use at least 24 month aged.

This au gratin dish is great. I made it for several gatherings and everyone has loved it. I use an aged white cheddar (2yrs) which gives it a great flavor. This dish is rich, but no one seems to mind, the serving amount is just about right considering the richness. I've served it with roast and leg of lamb, wonderful with both.

AWESOME PLUS!!!! I wanted to eat the few left overs for breaksfast. I used a really good white cheddar & the whipping cream(we only live once..right). It looked beautiful & tasted wonderful. I received RAVES from everyone. Pull up the roast chicken with herb butter, onions & garlic. Life doesn't get much better.

Very rich and delicious, and also presents itself as a "company dish" beautifully. My family of four polished off the entire dish in one sitting, so the only change I might make is to halve the recipe.

My husband really liked this dish, so I gave it three forks even though I wasn't personally overwhelmed. I thought it had great flavor, but it was so ridiculously rich that I just couldn't stomach very much of it. I was also quite disappointed with the presentation, as the cheese clumps and curdles after baking, making the whole dish look rather unappetizing. It's somewhat better after it rests for the ten minutes the recipe calls for, but I would certainly never consider it worthy for entertaining. If I ever made it again (and I doubt I will), I'd try substituting the heavy cream for half and half.

Mmm,Mmm,Mmm!! This was a great tasting dish! I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used dried rosemary and crushed it using a mortar and pestle. The next night we had it for leftovers and it was just as delicious!

This is an excellent dish! I have made it many times with rave reviews from very picky eaters. I made this for Christmas dinner with a rosemary pork roast and it was an excellent compliment. This is a must have in your recipe box.

It did not turn out as I expected- the milk had curdled during the baking process. Make sure you bake it uncovered for the last 45 minutes! Based on the rave reviews of the recipe, I will try this one again.

This dish is wonderful. I served it over the Christmas holiday. I made it a day ahead, by taking it out of the oven after baking it for 1 hr. I finished the dish on Christmas day, and it was fantastic. This is definitely a keeper!

This was absolutely fabulous. I made it for 16 (double recipe)for New Year's Eve. Everyone loved it and all want the recipe. I substituted freshly ground white pepper for the black pepper. (Since we used white cheddar cheese it seemed appropriate.) Very highly recommend.

I've made this dish twice now and each time have had numerous people ask for the recipe. It is definitely a winner!

This was excellent. I served it with a beef tenderloin roast for New Year's Eve. I used milk for part of the whipping cream and added a little extra cheese, but it turned out absolutely delicious. I will definitely make it again.

A wonderful fall recipe. For cheeselovers, add a little extra. A wonderful side dish to steak.

Wonderful recipe. Served these with ham for Christmas. Loved the use of white cheddar and the fresh rosemary is just enough to give it a bit of interest. Will make again and again!

Yep!! This is a winner!! Made it the day before and baked one hour. Put in the fridge and baked it the remaining time the next day. I used dry rosemary, very finely chopped, and Vermont White Cheddar, Sharp. YUUUUUUUUUUM!

I have made this recipe several times and it is out of this world! Excellent flavor and texture. Served it for a dinner party and garnished with sprigs of fresh rosemary. Rave reviews! I have also made this without the rosemary and it was delicious.

Used Swiss Cheese instead of the White Cheddar. Excellent. I often make these in individual dishes and garnish with a sprig of fresh rosemary or parsley (whichever I have around). Beautiful! They also take less time to bake!

This was wonderful. Served it with the Filet Mignon with Merlot sauce. Great combination! I will cut back on the salt next time.

THIS RECIPE IS A "GIVEN". I would definately make this dish again. It is simple and quick to prepare for us busy mothers who like to entertain. The addition of the "sharp white cheddar cheese" makes this recipe. I also made a point of using the "russet potaotes" as recommended. The blending of the shallots, fresh rosemary and cheese really pleases those people who love potatoe dishes with that bit of extra flavor. It has now been added to my computer favourites. Do try it - you shan't be disappointed.

Not the best potato recipe I've ever made but very tasty.
