tasty, but really runny, even though I added less milk. The lemon was a bit overwhelming, so I'll add less next time, But everyone liked it!

I loved it, but it was too thick! Maybe I cooked it too long? Any suggestions?

Following the advice of a reviewer, I reduced the milk to 3 cups. However, I left the sugar the same, so of course I thought the end result was too sweet. Also, used lime strips instead of lemon since that's what I had. It was a tad too much. On the positive side, the strips of zest become candy-like after cooking and can be eaten; very good. This is a fine recipe, I just have to tweak it a tad more. It also needed more cinnamon, I thought. Nor did I get 6 servings out of this, of course, after reducing the milk. More like 4.

Excellent! I have made this using a bit of ground cinnamon when I didn't have a cinnamon stick on hand, but the essence of cinnamon gained by using the stick is far superior. I do use the lightly zested peel of two lemons instead of the strips, just because I fear the bitterness of the white pith, and it turns out wonderfully - with a little delightful fleck of zest here and there. Great recipe!

Great recipe b/c it is not overly sweet! My husband loves this rice pudding. Make sure you stir the rice constantly throughout the cooking process- it can easily burn.

Unintentionally, I completely changed the recipe, but it is delicious, so I thought I would share--I doubled the rice, but used 4 cups of skim milk and 2 cups of vanilla soy milk (what we had), so not quite a full doubling of the liquids. I added just shy of 1/4 cup of packed dark brown sugar, almost 1 Tbsp of ground cinnamon, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. And I used about 2 tsp orange zest (finely ground) rather than lemon. It took about an hour to thicken and is a treat--not to sweet, but very appealing! I think I could make it with all soy for a similar effect for those who cannot tolerate dairy.

Great base recipe. Unfortunately, I read the reviews about it being too thin and added more rice the first time. The pudding thickens up as it cools and I would make it just as written from now on. Have also made it without lemon peel and added split vanilla bean. Fabulous.

Yummy and very easy to make ! We loved it and the kids loved it. I used less milk (3 cups) because we wanted a thicker pudding and it turned out the thickness of a rich yogurt - perfect for us

I doubled this so we could have leftovers. The subtle taste of the lemon and the cinnamon is absolutely divine. It was just perfectly sweet. Next time I will reduce the milk because it was incredibly runny, but oh so good.

when I made this the first time I paniced when I thought it was too thin so I added 3 times the rice in it turned out strong enough to build a house with the. second time I made it I followed the recipe and it turned out perfect.

Delicious. Exactly how I remember my host mom's rice pudding as tasting from when I studied abroad in Spain. I can't wait to make it again!

Mmmmm...this was SO good! Easy, too. I made it with brown rice and it was still good... a little more crunchy but still SO yummy.

Very good and simple rice pudding recipe. I've made it twice, once with lemon zest and once with orange zest. Both were very good.
