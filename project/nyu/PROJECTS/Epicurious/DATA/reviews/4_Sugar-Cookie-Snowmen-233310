Great cookies! Tasted almost as good baked as the dough tasted, which hardly ever happens with sugar cookies...

I have used this recipe 2 years in a row for Christmas and now for Valentine's Day. These cookies taste wonderful! It's also a very easy to roll dough and can hold up to a minute or two of overcooking. Great one to keep on hand.

I've made three batches of these cookies already this season and they are indeed scrumptious. I agree that the baking time should be reduced, as 15 minutes will burn thinner cookies. (I don't usually have room in my fridge to chill cookies after cutting them out, so I skipped that part and popped them right into the oven - 12 minutes did the trick.)

Tasty tasty! But baking for 15 minutes was a little much. 10 minutes is perfect =)

I agree these cookies were easy to make and great for rolling out, but I did not think they tasted that great even with the icing.

I have to say how easy this recipe is and how perfectly crisp the cookies turn out. I think I have made this recipe 40 times. really. and, the attached icing recipe is great for decorating.

These cookies were great! Light and flaky. Easy to roll out and tasty. I divided the dough in 4 parts which made it easier to keep it the right texture for rolling.

I just made these with my daughter and her friends and they were easy to roll out and shape. Nice consistency and taste. I used a different recipe for the icing so I cannot comment on that.
