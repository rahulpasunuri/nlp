I make this every year for Thanksgiving and I've had many requests for the recipe. I thought basic cranberry sauce couldn't get better, but this is perfection!

Hate to be a kill joy here but I have made this two years now, both times finding it disappointing. The jalapeno adds too much of its own distorting flavor - maybe try serranos for the heat - and I am not sure the pineapple adds value ... The recipe begs for something else to give it a rounder flavor, not sure what though.

Beyond fabulous!! I did half water & half orange juice, upped the sugar per taste as my berries were super sour, and added more jalapeno because it had no kick at all initially. But it was a big hit & the leftovers went with every meat we had from pork to turkey. This is the new go-to cran for us!

What a great change for Cranberry Sauce. I do not like cilantro so I never put it in. I make this every Christmas, Thanksgiving and Easter. It has great flavor starting with cranberries and orange; then pineapple and finally jalapenos. I will always make this for special occasions.

This was a big hit with my family, only thing I omitted was the cilantro. It did surprise a few people with the unexpected flavors. Yum!

Thanks for the dicing the jalepeno advice - I did that too and we enjoyed this, even my 81-yo mother who frankly I thought it might be too spicy for. I felt like something was missing though - might try adding onion next time? This was really yummy with the dark meat and I think it would be wonderful with pork.

This is the only cranberry sauce I make. I also finely dice the jalapeno. We have had this with every turkey since 2006.

A big hit! Everyone loved it and it was a prefect complement to the turkey and delish on the sandwiches. I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent - this was the best of the variations of basic cranberry sauce (tropical, spiced, exotic) - a nice "twist" on the traditional that I will definitely be making again this Thanksgiving! I finely diced rather than sliced the chilies for a more subtle flavor and used finely grated lime peel which was more in keeping with the tropical flavors.

My family loved this!! Excellent with turkey/chicken anytime! Jalapenos and cilantro add a unique flavour without the heat! Always asked to make this on holidays - it has become one of our signature dishes!

My family loved this dish. We served it at Thanksgiving and it went fast even though we made a double recipe. Loved that you could really taste the jalapenos without the heat.

I was skeptical when I first saw this recipe, but I'm a believer now! It was wonderfully different. But then, I do like spicy food. This, however, wasn't spicy as much as just more tart. The jalapenos added an extra bite without being hot, and the pineapple and cilantro were good balances to that.

Add this comment to the review from the 2 people from LA & Hartland: the orange zest in the "basic cranberry sauce" made the whole thing taste a little bitter to me...

Didn't love it. The jalapenos gave it too much of a "green" taste-- maybe I'd try using red pepper flakes instead. But as I'm writing this, my friend from wisconsin just walked in and said she liked it, but that she thinks it would be better served in a non-thanksgiving setting-- like turkey tacos or something like that.
