This pork tenderloin dish (like many others) is so simple, yet so delicious. I feel like its something I would pay at least $20-30 in a nice restaurant, but I actually made it!! I am not a huge fan of cabbage, but ate it up in this dish because of the flavors from the sauce. I only marinated the pork for 3 hours because I was short on time, but the flavors still came out great. I will have to try for longer next time, maybe it will be even tastier!

Love the pork and cabbage. I marinated the pork overnight. Great flavor and moist. Don't omit reducing the marinade as the sauce has great flavor. The red cabbage has a nice delicate flavor -- amazing since there's only the bay leaves for seasoning -- i think this is the first time i've ever really tasted bay leaves! I have a sweet & sour red cabbage recipe that I love, but this cabbage recipe difinitely is going to be made again & again.

Loved the flavor of the pork and cabbage together. I marinated the pork overnight. The reduced marinated sauce really adds the flavor to the pork so don't omit making it. I love the flavor of the cabbage -- i think this is the first time I have actually tasted the flavor of bay Leaves! I have a sweet and sour red cabbage recipe that i have been making for years, but I think this recipe is right along side it! Both the pork tenderloin and cabbage are definitely keepers.

Delicious! The whole family loved it. I did marinate it for about 8 hours and the sauteed cabbage and apples was an excellent compliment.

The marinade reduction makes a spectacular sauce. Will try it with other meats such as venison.

Easy, delicious, and healthy! Both the pork and cabbage had great flavor, and the beer added something a little different. I only marinated the pork for about 5 hours and it turned out very flavorful, tender, and juicy. Will definitely be making this again soon.

My guests raved about it. Very simple and quite nice. The cabbage and apples were very good and marinating the pork for 24 hours made the pork very moist.

Cabbage and apples are lovely. Pork was just ho-hum. Far better for simple pork tenderloin are the other recipes on this site which include mustard and maple or fennel rub. I wouldn't bother with this recipe again, but would use the cabbage part to accompany pork chops.

Fantastic! Really easy to prepare and the flavors were wonderful. I cooked the cabbage when I started marinating the pork, so all I had to do was re-heat the cabbage while the pork was cooking that evening. Perfect week-night dish.

very easy recipe but very disappointing.
