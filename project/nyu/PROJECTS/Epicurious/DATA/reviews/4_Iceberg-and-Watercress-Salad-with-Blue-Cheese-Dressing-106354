Nice blue cheese dressing and the combination of lettuce, watercress and celery complemented the rest of the meal nicely.

I actually rated this four forks, but somehow it didn't take.

This dressing is very similar to one my mom used to make, which I use all the time. Instead of chives, I mix in celery salt (which probably replaces the salt in the recipe) and it is great. It can be a dip, or thinned for a dressing. It gets even better after a day or two.

Great Dressing and the chives make it special. Use as dip for celery sticks.

The ideal blue cheese dressing recipe . . .

I loved the combination of the watercress, celery and iceberg lettuce. I think the secret to the dressing is to find a bleu cheese you really love. This is definitely a keeper!

This is my favorite blue cheese dressing! I just made it tonight for my buffalo wings for the Super Bowl. After I spent an hour looking for it this afternoon I decided I better type it into my recipe file in my computor!

Not a bad blue cheese dressing, just not a great blue cheese dressing. There are many better in the world. I won't be making this one again.

I love this dressing. I use this recipe whenever I need blue cheese dressing. I also use Maytag.

Like all recipes, it just a guide, but a decent one. I've made it several different ways, altering all ingredients in some way or another. I usually roast the blue cheese in the oven until it melts, but still has some crumbles. That really enhances the flavor. Just ignore the extremely strong aroma when roasting, however.

I am stunned by the ratings this recipe gets. It is a simple lettuce salad, with a simple bleu cheese dressing which is no better than bottled Marie's. I was pretty embarassed to bring this to a dinner party tonight, because it is so unimpressive

This dressing is fantastic! Will be accompanying wings for a Super Bowl party. Used Maytag blue cheese, skipped the chives, added a little extra buttermilk than the amount of milk called for. The secret is really in the lemon. It sets off the blue cheese so nicely! Looked at the recipe they have to go with their wing recipe -- I'm sure that one can't compare in taste with this one!

This was a very good Bleu Cheese dressing, made a great combo with the spicy fried chciken

This was an easy. I substituted plain yogurt for the mayo and it was good.

I used low fat buttermilk, just a little as I like thick dressing. As well, I didn't add onions, still was simply the best! Seriously, I was really surprised how good it was. I had made it the night before, which gave it time to set. I have to say...better than anything I've had in restaurants.

My boyfriend is the pickiest "meat & potatoes" type eater in the world. I made this dressing & he LOVED it! When I say LOVED it, I mean, he not only put it on his salad (which is hard enough to get him to eat), but he also put it on his hamburger instead of the traditional ketchup & mustard, then proceeded to dip his french fries & grilled veggies in it! He was literally scraping the bowl to finish it up!

I deviated slightly from this recipe by using shallots rather than chives and buttermilk instead of milk. This is definitely a great blue cheese dressing!!

This was quick, easy and just plain terrific. Like others, I found it needed a little thinning and I used a couple tablespoons of buttermilk. I poured it over iceberg wedges and sprinkled with chives. My husband and guests LOVED it.

Finally...a wonderful blue cheese dressing. I served it on iceburg wedges. YUM!

GREAT BLUE CHEESE DRESSING. I HAD TO THIN IT A BIT MORE THAN THE RECIPE CALLED FOR THO'. A KEEPER.

I used Maytag Blue cheese, but cut iceberg lettuce into wedges, topped with thinly sliced red onions and crushed croutons--heaven on earth!

Amazing, simple and extremely easy! I used buttermilk to thin, the only change and only because I happened to have some. Enjoy!

The first time I made this recipe, I used Danish blue cheese, which was heavily veined, which was overpowering. The second time, I used a milder blue cheese (Maytag) and LOVED the result. I also halved the amount of salt. Note: if you use a whisk, the blue cheese clumps in the middle; I find a spoon easier to work with.

Excellent and easy recipe. One of the best blue cheese dressings I've ever had. Mine did need to be thinned, however.

Made this to top salad at a Christmas Day brunch and everyone requested the recipe. I subsituted buttermilk for the sour cream as that is what I had. It had the perfect consistency this way and did not need to be thinned.

Don't change a thing about this recipe. Made this for a Christmas celebration dinner and everybody raved about it. It's unusually good.

Yes, this is great. Classic blue cheese dressing and super-easy salad. Great with grilled foods. We made it with reduced fat mayo and reduced fat sour cream -- delicious. Rich dressing, plan accordingly.

I've made the dressing twice in the last 3 days. Just served it with romaine lettuce, tomatoes & red onion. simply delicious. great on grilled steak also!

This is awonderful summer salad that is so esy it lets you concentrate on the rest of the meal! Don't shred the lettuce, though, or the consistency of the salad will be too heavy. This would also be great with chopped Romaine:-)

Excellent, and very easy to make. I prepared only 1/2 recipe because I had a small amount of blue cheese leftover from another recipe..though I wish I made more because it was so good. I also increased the amount of lemon juice slightly to taste.

So delicious, doesn't get any better than this. I served the spicy chicken on top as well and loved it, and so did my husband. I also added some cherry tomatoes, and used LF sour cream, couldn't notice any difference.

This was the best blue cheese dressed salad! I got fresh live watercress from Safeway and used skim milk to thin the dressing. The celery was a nice touch of crunch. I added fresh tomatoes to my salad and voila - perfecto. I might add a tiny bit of garlic next time to the dressing.

I was looking for a blue cheese recipe for my Atkin's diet. This recipe was unusual in tht it used mayonaise. The results are spectacular and finger licking good. (I licked the spatula, the processor parts and scapoed the bowl clean) Yum!

The dressing was just delicious. I used romaine instead of watercress and also added some tomato. I made the spicy fried chicken and served it on top of the salad. Yum!

I prepared this salad with Easter Dinner. Nothing but compliments!! Delicious combo with the watercress and blue cheese (best dressing ever!)
