This is the best salad ever. I dream of December when pomegranates will be in season so that I can make it again. Be sure to wear an apron. As other cooks have said, toast the walnuts and any salad greens will do.

This is a wonderful salad--full of intense flavors and lovely textures. The dressing is a find--my husband asked for it again the next evening.

This salad makes a marvelous refreshing accompaniment to stews. We enjoyed it following a Persian Khoresh and substituted pistachios for walnuts. Delicious.

A perfect fall/winter salad. Don't bother with the time and mess of juicing the pomegranates yourself- many stores sell unsweetened juice under brand names such as 'POM' or Trader Joe's own. Otherwise, this is quick and easy, especially if you buy already seeded pomegranates (try a middle eastern market, Trader Joe's or some mainstream stores, as well). The recipe is good as is or with crumbled feta added. The slightly salty flavor compliments the nutty/sweet/sour very well.

Great holiday salad got rave reviews on Christmas eve. I streamlined this to make it for 12: Salad I used 1.5 cups chopped walnuts, seeds from 1.5 pom's, big bowl 'o greens. Dressing I mixed 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup red wine vinegar, 1/2 cup pomegranate juice (from 1.5 pomegranates), 2-3 teaspoons sugar. I did not simmer, just mixed ingredients-- I would make same day, not ahead. Layered ingredients in thirds, toss with dressing just before serving. Much easier for a larger number.

Everyone in our house loved this including the 8 year old and seconds were requested around the table. The flavor was excellent and very well matched with the mache.

I've made this 3 times now and have always had very good reviews. I love the sweet-tart combination of the pomegranate and vinegar, and it is a very pretty presentation. The only imrovement I can suggest is to toast the walnuts, but then I alsways prefer the flavor of nuts after toasting. I use mesclun, and even added some (gasp!) iceberg to stretch what I had to feed 8. Mache is just too darned expensive if you're having more than just a few for dinner!

Not that special and really not worth the extra time it takes to prepare.

First, a confession: I only made this because it was included in the "New Year's Dinner for Two" recipe set and it sounded fancy. Wow. Wonderfully complex and rich, a great elegant side for a hearty meal (filets mignon). And to think I didn't even know what mache was!

Really nice dressing can use with any type of salad leaves. Sweet - perhaps can use a little bit more vinegar but really different and has a nice color

This was a wonderful side dish. Very colourful and attractive as well as tasty. The walnuts and pomegranate seeds make a delicious combination.
