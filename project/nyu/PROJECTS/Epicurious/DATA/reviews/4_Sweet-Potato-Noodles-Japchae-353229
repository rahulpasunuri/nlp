I was very excited to find this recipe. I already had the sweet potato noodles from a trip to a Korean market with my Korean stepgrandmother. She made japchae for me while I was visiting but I forgot all about it until I ran across this recipe. Turned out very close to her version. I did take a short cut with spinanch. Instead of blanching it in water I steamed/sauteed the damp leaves in a pan with sesame oil and the garlic and cooked it until most of the moisture was gone. This cooked and seasoned it all in one step. Then I used the same pan to stirfry the veggies. I skipped the beef since I was serving it as a side dish with salt and pepper shrimp (from finecooking.com).

Very yummy. Would probably keep on heat a little longer just to stir the heat through the noodles. Also, though the amount of sugar was nice if I made it again I'd probably halve it.

I used rice noodles because our Whole Foods did not have the sweet potato noodles, and left out the beef. The flavors were absolutely perfect. I was a bit reluctant to use all that sugar at first, but found that it really did balance the flavors without making the dish too sweet. Unless you are serving this as a main dish, it serves more than 5 people easily.
