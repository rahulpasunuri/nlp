This is easy to fix; soak the beans. I did a quick soak (boil for 2 minutes, let rest for 2 hours) then extended cook time to 2 hours. I did not need to add any extra liquid.

I also noticed that I needed to cook the beans for at least a total of three hours. I liked the flavor, but thought it needed to be abit spicier. A dollop of sour cream on top is nice.

The lowest rating for inaccurate instructions. This is the first recipe I've seen that calls for dry beans - AND THE COOK TIME IS A MISTAKE. I cooked this recipe precisely as directed and had to add another four cups of liquid, cover the pot completely, and cook for another three and a half hours for a decent bean texture. The flavor is good but this is a highly flawed recipe for Gourmet standards.

We really enjoy this soup in the winter. Smoked ham hocks are more readily available also in the fall and winter. the soup is delicious and makes great leftovers!

I suggest substituting sherry for the vinegar... And if your palate can handle it, it's so much better made with hot peppers as well! A few crumbled dried peppers, or chopped fresh ones make a world of difference..
