Easy, delicious. Definitely reduce the roasting time to 20 minutes. The dressing portion was too much, so you could make less.

Delicious! I make it with Granny Smith apples and Manchego cheese. The dressing is so so good, that it is a staple in my family now for use with other salads also.

This is pure and simple a taste delight! I did roast the asparagus (20 mins only, per other reviewers) and then chilled the asparagus in the fridge. I did not do the layering, but instead mixed all together. The tartness of the apple, the bite of the cheese, and the mellow roast of the asparagus along with the mild tang of the dressing .... oh my! Really, really yummy. I served this with lemon caper chicken and potato salad and my guests were talking about it two days after!

Beautiful & delicious salad.

Really wonderful flavor. Brought this to a party and everyone loved it. Only 20 mins. on the asparagus, and be sure to toss it halfway through. Used a gala apple and sage derby cheese to great effect. The dressing is superb!

The asparagus will be way over-cooked if roasted according to the recipe. The dressing is very good and the combination of apple, cheese,greens and asparagus is tasty.

Excellent salad! Watch the timing on roasting the asparagus, a few of my stalks got a little crispy. The vinegarette is excellent and I will use for other salads. The presentation is very good. I served family style: dressed the greens, mounded the greens on a small serving platter and arranged the apples, asparagus and cheese. The next time I might go lighter on the cheese because the combination of apples, asparagus, greens and dressing is so flavorful.

Was looking for a recipe to use up asparagus and didn't want to go to the store for extra ingredients. This was delicious and so easy - the dressing is very light but suprisingly unique tasting for only having four ingredients.

This was delicious. I'll use this dressing for other salads too.

Very good. This is just one of the hundreds of salad recipes I rotate throughout the year. The gruyere adds a nice touch.

Served this Christmas Eve and it was a wonderful course just before the standing rib roast. Only difference was that I steamed the asparagus (earlier in the day). This was wonderful and a fine blend of flavors. Will definately do this one again. Also, it was very easy!

I have mad this salad over and over - usually with Granny Smith apples instead. A seared tuna steak sliced over the top makes it a great meal.

Another great option to dress up those greens...not quite as good as Salad Sevillana! Don't cook the asparagus so long.

What a wonderful blend of flavors! There were only two of us, so I halved the recipe, and it still came out delicious. The aspargus does not need to be cooked as long as the recipe calls for. I baked at 375 for 15 minutes, and they came out perfect. I was a little worried that the dressing was too sweet, but once I let it sit for a while, and I blended it into the salad, it was great. I couldn't find gruyere at the store, so I bought a creamy swiss cheese instead at Trader Joe's, and grated curls over the salad which worked out really well. I don't like golden delicious apples, so I used a Fuji instead. Next time, I might try the granny smith though. My boyfriend absolutely loved this salad. Am making for guests this weekend.

i replaced: olive oil with grapeseed oil gruyere with chevre golden delicious with granny smith and left out the pepper and baby greens. It was fantastic. I ate it by itself for dinner. mmm mmm mmm.

Fresh, light and delightful!! I added cranberries for color and left the peel on the apples ( I used granny smith. Perfect fall salad - Yummy

This is the tastiest salad I've ever made. The dressing is superb and complements the apples and roasted asparagus quite well. mmmmm

I love this recipe! I have used grated parmesan cheese, but have never added the apple. I substitute red leaf lettuce as well. Yummy!

Excellent! My husband loved it. I used 4 times the amount of garlic and it was delicious.

Delicious and surprising combination of tastes. I used a good gruyere - not the plastic supermarket stuff. Next time I will try with another kind of apple - the Golden Delicious was a bit too sweet and not crunchy enough. Substituted white vinegar for the rice vinegar since I didn't have any on hand. Added a bit of lemon juice to the dressing since I used less vinegar than stated. My asparagus were really thin, so I only roasted them for about 15 minutes. I tried this out on my husband, but will definitely be serving it to guests.

20 people. Each set of guests has independently called asking for the recipe. The requests speak for themselves. One of the best recipes ever!

This is my second time to make this salad. It is a wonderful recipe and taste delicious. I use Granny Smith apple for tartness. A real crowd pleaser for men and women alike.

Wow!! I splurged on the asparagus (it's not cheap) but it was worth it. We loved every bight and will be sharing the recipe with friends. I used a Granny Smith for tartness and it was perfect.

This was a great salad! I would definitely make it again. I used McIntosh apples in place of golden, but otherwise followed the recipe.

Excellent recipe! I make this often, especially during asparagus season. Braeburn apples go well with this and I blanch my asparagus instead of roast them - this way it is more healthy and the aspargus retains it's crunch.

Rating: 4
Sooo Good! I prefer my apples sliced, but other than than, wouldn't change a thing. Roasting the asperagus is the only way to go. Have made this regularly to serve with pork tenderloin.

Everyone loved this salad, even the kids! I used white vinegar as I forgot to get rice vinegar and it was still wonderful! This has to be the most elegant salad I've ever made. Next, I'll try the original.

I have made this many times, frequently adding crabcakes to make it more of a complete meal. My husband loves it and we almost always have everything in our refrigerator. Roasting asparagus is so easy and tastes so good.

My favorite salad! I prefer to use one tablespoon of honey for a better balance of savory and sweet.

great recipe; one of my guests favorites; add toasted pecans; cut down a little on the olive oil and definitely only roast the asparagus 10-15 min.

I served this with a cheese souffle for lunch. A nice-looking, easy to make salad with a pleasant combination of colours and textures. As others have recommended, roast the asparagus for 15-20 minutes for best results.

I took this to a supper club meeting last night and it drew raves. I used a Braeburn apple; the rosy color of the skin looked pretty. And what a wonderful way to cook asparagus! I cut the cooking time down about five minutes. Definitely a winner!

Not only was the dressing sublime, but the yummy cheese and roasted asparagus really made this a delightful salad. Luckily, there was leftover dressing, which we have been enjoying on other salads. This is a winner--delicious, pretty, and fun.

Terrific! We usually don't bother with salads but this was a special occassion (I even halfed the recipe without any problems). We are already planning an event and this was the first thing on the menu.

This recipe is the perfect way to start a meal when trying to impress. I added a little minced apple in the dressing for a little added effect.

My husband raved about this salad (he's a big salad and vegetable lover) and guests all gobbled it up, so I assume they liked it, and I myself thought it was fancy-restaurant quality...but next time I will watch the asparagus closely because I accidently roasted it too long and it came out kind of shriveled! Still edible though, and it certainly didn't ruin anything--just would have been better unshriveled.

Could I have done something wrong? The unanimous consensus at our table this evening was that the salad was very nice, apart from the asparagus, which didn't complement the other flavors at all. And I'm an asparagus fan from way back. Sorry, but not a winner.

This has become a family favorite. It even got my teenaged son to like (?tolerate) asparagus. It is simple to make and tastes great its best when the asparagus is nice and warm on the greens.

This salad was fabulous. Added walnuts too. Instead of the apple cut into quarters I made apple shavings with the peeler so the cheese slices and apple looked the same. Looked elegant. I will make this over and over again.

This is a wonderful, simple salad! The only thing I did differently was that I added chopped walnuts, but it certainly doesn't NEED them...it's just a matter of personal taste. I served with filet mignon, creamed spinach and pureed butternut squash. YUM!

I have made this recipe for a few dinner parties and receive rave reviews all the time. I also have cut the cooking time for the asparagus by more than half. A variation on the dressing is to use Raspberry Balsamic Vinegar instead of the Rice Wine vinegar. It adds a whole new flavor to the salad.

I made this salad for a special occasion, and in the process thought the asparagus would be ruined. But in fact, the roasting process gave the asparagus and the whole salad a wonderful taste and texture. Loved it! and plan to make it for a dinner party in a couple weeks.

this was a very delicious salad, almost a meal in itself. The only problem was that the asparagus was a little too overcooked for my liking. I'll shorten the roasting time next time I make this. UPDATE: That was my original comment I made back in June, and I made this again the other day and I still love it. I cut the cooking time for the asparagus by almost half and they kept their crunchy texture which was really nice with the crispy apple.
