This is an exceptional cheesecake! I did double the amount of grated lime peel for added flavor.

This was the perfect Easter dessert; I used the vanilla cookie crust from earlier review, but found that half the amount was plenty. (Thanks Ed, it's a keeper!) My only complaint was that it cracked in the middle, so next time (and that will be soon) I'll let it cool a bit before refrigeration. We had a couple pieces left over and forgot about it for 3 days. It tasted even better after 3 days, so this could be made well in advance.

Made this for a party and it was a smash! Kept nicely in fridge for leftovers as well. This is a winner and pretty easy to make.

This was a wonderful cheesecake. I made it with a vanilla wafer crust. The chutney didn't sound good so I didn't make it. However, I did top the cheesecake with a key lime mousse. My husband and kids devoured it!

The key lime juice and zest give this cheesecake an exquisite flavor. The secret to a having a tender crust is to bake the crust only 15 minutes, not 25 minutes. Otherwise, it is too hard to cut and sticks to the pan. Also, members of my gourmet club and I have decided that the cheesecake is better without the tropical dried-fruit chutney. This recipe is one that I will bake again and again for family and friends.

I used regular limes (doubled the zest) and made a regular grahm cracker crust. It was the perfect lime cheesecake!

In my last update, I stated use a 1/2 butter, should be 1/4 cup butter

Now one of my favorites and my guests as well. Not a real big coconut fan so changed the crust, as follows: 1 1/2 cup finely ground nilla wafers, 1 1/2 cup finely ground almonds, 1/4 cup of light brown sugar, 1/2 cup melted butter - mix together with fork until combined - butter bottom of pan and spread crust on bottom and up side of spring form pan - no need to bake, just pour in Key Lime mixture

This cheesecake was excellent! Creamy and the hit of my cookout. The crust stuck to the bottom of my springform pan so the next time I make it, I would spray the bottom of the pan with cooking spray. Otherwise, the recipe worked very well. Outstanding.

Great dessert but I did change a few things: 1) Crust - 1.5 cups ground nilla waffers in food processor, 1.5 cups almonds ground in food processor, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 stick butter - mix together and press on sides and bottom, no need to cook - 2) no cocoanut - just added whipped cream and sliced almonds to top - turned out GREAT!

This was a fabulous cheesecake! Great flavor, more delicate than a key lime pie, and perfect cheesecake texture. This baked up exactly per the recipe, however I did bring it to room temp before refridgerating it. I used an extry teaspoon or so of key lime juice, as limes are not in season so I couldn't add zest or peel. One complaint: the crust pretty much carmelized onto the pan, and was a pain to serve and eat, plus not too attractive in chunks...I'll try another crust next time. Also: we altered the chutney quite a bit, as dried fruit sounded too weird and un-summery: we made the syrup but cooled it and added fresh diced mango and papaya, with a little pineapple juice. The syrup and fruit were drizzled over each plate and really complemented the cheesecake. Delish!

This was very good -- my husband and mother and law both really liked it. The texture of the cheesecake was great. The crust was a bit crunchy, so next time I will cook it for less time. Other than that, this is winner.

Excellent Key lime cheesecake!

This was yummy! Be sure to use actual Key Limes and not regular limes. Didn't make the chutney and used a shortbread cookie crust as husband doesn't like coconut.

This cheesecake was good but not stellar. It was very creamy and had a good texture, but not much depth of flavor. I didn't try the tropical fruit. I used candied lime peel to top the cheesecake instead.

I will definitely make this cheesecake recipe again! It turned out perfectly following the recipe. However, I will not make the chutney again because no one in my family liked it with the cheesecake. It might be good over ice cream but definitely not the cheesecake.
