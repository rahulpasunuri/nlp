This was very tasty, and easy to make! I used a fake chicken broth to make it vegan to accomodate my vegetarian dining companion. Made a double batch, so had leftovers, and on the reheats since I was out of chives I substituted parmesan cheese, which worked pretty well (though the chives were better).

Really nice-and very simple. The coconut milk makes this just a little different-as does the rum.

This has a nice, sweet, rich flavor. It needed quite a lot of thinning with broth. It makes six servings, but only just. We had it with guava-stuffed chicken with caramelized mango, sauteed chayote with garlic and herbs, sweet potato, onion, and apple gratin, and rum raisin ice cream.
