I made this exactly as written, except for using a glass pie dish to bake (its all I had), & found it to be very yummy. I might chop the bacon and onions more finely next time though, and maybe incorporate some fresh herbs.

well it's still in the oven... but I had to double the cornmeal just to begin to get this to thicken. I think the ratios are off.

Very good, however, bacon crisps better in oven or frying pan. Good with other cheeses and herbs as well.

We made this and it was great. Although microwaves are fine, meats are not something to be cooked by nuking.

This was great!!! My husband is a vegetarian so I substituted Morningstar Farms strips for the bacon. While you don't get any of the actual bacon fat you still get the taste. I also used instant polenta instead of cornmeal and whisked 1 cup of it into 3 cups of boiling water. Then I baked all the ingredients together. It tasted just terrific!!!

A delicious side dish. I am glad that I doubled it! I used a combination of white cheddar and parmesan for the cheese requirement.
