My sister and I just got done trying to make this recipe, while following the directions exactly. The directions for the ice cream and compote are fine - though there is definitely too much compote to swirl. Use enough of it and you'll get blueberry ice cream instead. The cookie portion is the problem. As is, the cookies are way too thin once baked and they were impossible to remove from the foil even though we buttered the foil according to the directions given. The cookies were too soft and crumbled when we inverted the top layer to press onto the ice cream layer. As is this recipe just does not work. Others have advised doubling the cookie recipe and others have recommended using parchment paper instead of foil; these might perhaps work better, but the original recipe needs an overhaul and possibly some better directions for the cookies AND getting a pretty swirled ice cream as pictured.

An as advertised recipe. Very good and a nice primer for making tons of variations.

I made this last winter to break in a new ice cream maker. I did the lemon ice cream from scratch using another recipe. Very tasty! Now that I have fresh blueberries, I'm going to do the ice cream part only for a treat. I will probably puree the berries for texture reasons.

I changed the recipe to what I had on hand, so I didn't rate, but it was AWESOME. I turned the blondies into brownies with a few tablespoons of cocoa, used vanilla ice cream, and tossed a bunch of frozen raspberries into the middle as well. Make the brownies in a cookie sheet with parchment- it's relatively simple and they get rave reviews.

This recipe was delicious! I worked perfect for a summer BBQ last year, so I think that I will make it again this year too. The lemon ice cream was delicious and the cookies were really good too. The first time you make it, follow the recipe, as for me it worked as is. It tastes great and is beautiful too!

The cookie part of this sandwich was absolutely delicious, as was the blueberry swirl. I made a double recipe of the batter and spread half in a 15x19 pan lined with parchment. My baking time was about 10 minutes--the edges were a bit crispy, but the main part was tender (as the instructions say). Instead of using vanilla ice cream, I made up my own dairy free ice cream (I have a dairy allergy), and instead of lemon I made orange (like a lovely creamscicle!). I would definately make this again!! Wonderful!

All the components of this recipe are delicious, but I found that I only used about half the ice cream. that problem could be solved easily enough by doubling the cookie part though. For the compote, I cooked fresh strawberries with the blueberries, which was reallyy good. I also used way more lemon for the ice cream, the balance between the sweet berries and the tartness of the lemon is perfect. I'll definitely make this again

I agree with cindylu35...it is way too difficult to keep this dessert looking nice by spreading the blueberries on the ice cream before placing the ice cream on the cookies. I also agree with others that you either need to double the cookie recipe or cut the ice cream and blueberry parts in half. I guess it depends on how many you want to feed. My ice cream was way too hard...it broke into little pieces when I was putting it on my cookie. To do next time: I will either double the cookie recipe or only do half of the blueberry and ice cream recipes depending on how many I am serving. I am going to do the cookies in muffin tins. I am going to soften the ice cream for approx. 15 - 20 minutes before spooning it onto half of the "muffin tin" cookies. THEN I will spoon the blueberries on top of that. After that, place the remaining half of cookies on top of the tins that are full then place in freezer. This doesn't need to freeze long I think. I will also serve with a curl of lemon peel on top and a blueberry.

I followed this recipe as written and loved it! The only substitution I made was to use frozen yogurt in place of ice cream. I didn't double the sandwich portion of the recipe and while the layers were thinner than pictured above, they were appropriately sized. I also covered the ice cream layer with the compote rather than mixing them and the end result closely matched the photograph. Overall, these are a delicious summer treat - the blueberries complement the lemon ice cream and the combination was great. I'll make these again for a BBQ or outdoor party.

I made this in the summer and it turned out perfectly, even though I had serious doubts about the crust. I made the crust in 2 8" tart pans with removable bottoms. I made the cookie crust again during the holidays. Omitted the ice cream and topped the cookie with melted white, dark, and milk chocolate, chopped dried cherries and chopped pistachios! KILLER!

I would give this recipe four forks despite some of the difficulties; the taste is just fantastic. When the recipe says to freeze the sandwiches for at least two hours, it should be at least 5 hours or so. At two hours mine were still very runny. Mine did not turn out as beautiful as the picture; the blueberry became more of the main color than a swirl, which is perhaps why people suggest halving the blueberry compote. I did love the cookie and doubled it as people suggested. My family devoured the final product!

This recipe was really tasty but difficult to keep presentable. Double the cookie mixture for maximum results, especially when preparing for more than 4 or 5 people.

In order for this dessert to come out looking just like the picture shown, there was no way I was going to put the blueberry compote on the ice cream, swirl it on top and THEN move it over to the cookie! The easy way to do the ice cream portion is to freeze it originally in an 8 x 8 pan and then just lift it out and set it on the cookie, add the compote on the ice cream and then top it with the other cookie. Freeze again and cut into squares. I did 9 squares. Just easier. This is a very unique and TIME CONSUMING dessert, but very well worth the time and compliments afterwards.

These ice cream sandwiches are as good as they look. I am in love with this recipe! I followed others advice and doubled the cookie recipe and it turned out perfect. Worth trying!

So I doubled up on the cookie crust recipe, and they turned out so chewy and yummy! I also added lemon rind to the crust (I love lemony stuff...). I think next time I may add some white chocolate chips to the recipe....

So yummy! Added cinnamon to the crust. I served these as a sundae the first night, because it got too late, but they were MUCH better as a sandwich. I made the sanwiches individually, instead of as directed in the intructions. I also used 1/2 the icecream and less blueberry sauce (which I made with mostly blackberries). Husband says he wants this instead of a birthday cake next year!

The cookie turned out perfectly...even though I had serious doubts. I baked mine in 2 8" sq. tart pans with removable bottoms, and they came out perfectly! No foil, no parchment necessary. Compote and assembly was easy!

I have to edit my original review, the reason I had too much ice cream is because I read the recipe wrong and used twice as much as it called for. oops. and the foil was a problem, I would try parchemnt next time. the cookie was perfect and I am thinking of other ice creams to use as fillings..

Rating: 0
Not a rating, just a question...could you serve this as a sundae instead, w/ the cookies on the side or perhaps underneath? Or maybe a different cookie on the side -- maybe a crisp, buttery tuille or shortbread, perhaps?

I made these with my kids and their friends and I have to agree - way to much work. That said - if you have the time, they are delicious. A trick to getting the final bars our of the pan is to turn the pan over and run hot water over the bottom of the pan - the bars slipped right out and looked perfect. I recommend freezing overnight and to avoid soggy cookies - re-freeze the ice cream a bit so it's not too runny when you assemble. Yummy! Am making the blueberries again tonight just to put over ice cream.

If you are playing poker and you want to make sure the other players lay down their cards, giv'em these!! Wow these were a hit. Make sure you have enough for seconds! they are on the make more often list.

I agree with the other posts. There is much more blueberry compote in the dish than the photo indicates. I wonder if parchment paper would work better. The foil stuck to the cookie. While the flavors are fine (the cookie reminds me of butterscotch), the cookies I made were much thinner than pictured and have more ice cream to cookie than indicated in the photo. The compote has many uses, and the lemon blueberry ice cream was a snap to make. I would make this again, but would like to improve the appearance of my dish.

I thought these were very easy to make and extraordinarily delicious. As others have said, you can cut the blueberry sauce in half (or double the rest of the recipe). I used heavy duty non-stick pans and heavily buttered both them and the foil. I had no problem removing the sandwiches. The only thing I would recommend is freezing overnight to ensure really solid before turning out and cutting. I will make these over and over!

I bought Gourmet magazine specifically because the very tempting photo of this dessert on the cover. I am more than happy with my purchase if the only thing I make from this issue is this dessert. The one slight modification I made is that I did not use quite as much blueberry sauce as the recipe called for and I used a little more ice cream. The Cookie crust was very tasty and the sandwiches were devoured the night I made them. I will be making these again!

This is a great recipe. I would definetely use heavy duty foil next time. Also, I will cook the cookie a bit longer. The blueberry compote is excellent. I agree with other writer that it would be wonderful on cheesecake. My first try tasted great however I need to work on the "look". I will make these ice cream sandwiches again. I think bing cherries would also be delicious!

Rating: 3
the flavors were amazing! next time I would either double the cookie part or 1/2 the ice cream part. there seemed to be too much ice cream to eat with you hands like a true ice cream sandwich. I am already thinking of other ice cream flavors to try with this, the cookies were perfect!

I'd give these 4 forks if they weren't so much work. They turned out as promised: good cookie texture, perfect softness of ice cream, and a lovely balance of lemon, vanilla, and blueberry, in harmony with the cookie. But because of the effort involved, I wouldn't make these for company if I were also cooking dinner, nor if I weren't already at ease with baking. Unmolding the bars at the end would have been cause for grief if my 8x8" pan hadn't happened to have a removable bottom. That said, I have only one 8x8" pan and was able to make the other cookie layer in a quarter-sheet pan, sectioned off with heavy-duty foil: easy to handle. Still, the final stages were tricky. I'd recommend heavy-duty foil all around for this recipe. Meanwhile, the blueberry compote was so good in itself that my kids and I had to restrain ourselves from eating it instead of saving it for the rest of the recipe. We plan to make another batch of the compote on its own, for tomorrow's pancakes. We used a mixture of fresh local berries and frozen wild. That part (the compote) was easy and delicious, a 4-fork recipe within a recipe: worth making the bars to discover. I could see serving it on cheesecake or homemade ice cream, at a dinner party.

I thought this was more work than it was worth. The cookies got soggy during the freezing and the blueberry compote was icy and hard to bite into. It was like trying to bite into a popsicle right out of the freezer. The lemon ice cream was tasty, but I liked it more in its fluffy, half-melted form. The textures didn't compliment one another either.

Easy to put together and a real crowd-pleaser. Lots of room to explore other flavors if used as a basic recipe for an ice cream sandwich. The lemon is a refreshing touch.

These are pretty great ice cream bars. The lemony ice cream pairs beautifully with the blueberry compote and buttery cookie. The friends I served them to were totally impressed and ate every bite. I followed the recipe exactly, except the foil thing seemed fussy, and since I was using silicone baking pans, I thought I would skip it. This worked OK, but the top cookie was a bit difficult to remove. Next time I'd use parchment paper, which would be easier to line silicone pans with and provide the handles needed for lifting the cookie out of the pan. I let the whole sandwich freeze for about 3.5 hours before cutting, which was fine, but the bars were still pretty soft and had to be served immediately. They were not nearly as firm as the photo (and there is also a lot more blueberry than pictured, but that was delicious). I served them on plates with forks, and they were devoured in just a few minutes, so the softness was fine. If you planned to serve these without forks, you should plan to freeze them for at least a day.

The filling was very good, although I found I needed less blueberry mixture than called for in the recipe to achieve the swirled look in the photo. Next time I will use half the amount of blueberry mixture. The cookie "sandwich" was disappointing: heavy and squidgy. I will not make this as a sandwich again, although I can see the filling as a stand-alone dessert in a terrine shape: Lemon Blueberry Swirl Terrine.

Very refreshing dessert. The Lemon Ice Cream w/ Blueberries was fabulous. Will definitely make again. The actual sandwich-ing part was a bit tricky.. so be prepared for that.
