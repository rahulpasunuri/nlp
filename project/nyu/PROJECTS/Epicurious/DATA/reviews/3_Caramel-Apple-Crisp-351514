This was yummy! I cut the apples into eighths as quarters was too big. I didn't have allspice, so used ginger instead. I, like others mentioned, like the addition of oats, so used half flour, half oats. This was a great way to use up apples that aren't so fresh anymore.

LOVED this! made it for a dinner party with some hard-core foodies (including a professional pastry chef!) and they all had seconds. took longer than 5 minutes for my butter/sugar to caramelize and took longer in the oven to brown, but the flavors were wonderful. i used idared apples and served with ice cream instead of whipped cream.

This is a very tasty caramel crisp that's easy to make, I've made it twice now. A note about the caramel: it takes me closer to 3 1/2 to 4 minutes (not 5 as stated in recipe)to get the caramel right. It will change color gradually, and then all of a sudden it's quite dark--add the salt and apples right away. Toss them for a good minute to evenly coat and bring the caramel back to a smooth consistency. A great autumn dessert that will last all week. Enjoy!!

It's me again. I forgot to say I add a tsp of vanilla and a pinch of nutmeg as I'm coating the apples.

This is my all-time favorite apple crisp recipe. At first I had a problem with the caramel, it got too hard. Instead of wasting it I put the apples in the pan to just coat them and then discarded the caramel. The flavor was wonderful!Now whenever I make this I make the caramel but use to to coat the apples only, taking care to not let it harden,the extra flavor is superb. Thank You!

Boring. Definitely missed the oats that add the substance to the topping. Just OK, Just boring. There are better recipes.

I enjoyed this despite over-caramelizing the sugar and getting a little bitterness. The topping was good and the apples came out perfect.

This recipe is a bit easier than my normal apple crisp, which I considered to be the best ever tasted, until I made this. I cut the apples into 8ths instead of quarters so they would be fully cooked. Served it warm with Vanilla Bean ice cream. Yummy!

I love the combination of caramel and apples. This recipe caught my eye and I made if for my family. It was a hit! I will definitely make it again. Everyone loved it! So Yummy!

I wish I'd read the reviews first. Like several others have said, the caramel comes out bitter. Not burnt (I know how long to cook it), but bitter and just kind of off. I had large Roma apples and could not believe they really meant them to be in quarters, so I put mine in eighths or so. It makes a shallow pan of a decent crisp, apart from the slight bitterness to the caramel. The crumble crisped up just fine and adequatelty covered the pan. With a sweet whipped cream, it's edible as the sweet compensates for some of that bitter, but I still think there must be better recipes out there. Though I like the idea of caramel with the crisp.

We loved this, but I like the suggestion of oats or nuts to make the topping more of a true crisp. I used 5 Green Apples because I couldn't find the kinds listed (and I bought a sack not realizing I needed one more). The apples were cooked through but not mushy. I had no problem with the caramel - it did taste like there was to much lemon juice after I spooned it in the pan, but it cooked nicely. Great with vanilla frozen yogurt.

Not a lot of pizzazz here, but it is delicious, quick, & easy. Cooks who experienced bitter flavor definitely overcooked their caramel -- I didn't have any trouble with this. Instead of adding the apples to the caramel sauce, I tossed the apples with lemon juice in the pan and poured the caramel over it, tossed again, and then added the topping. I added chopped walnuts to the topping for extra texture, and I added maple syrup and bourbon to the whipped cream. Delicious!

boy, were my tastebuds disappointed! this was "meh". the caramel came off a bit bitter. i spent about 5 minutes going back and forth between my white and brown sugar cannisters trying to decide which to use because my own crisp recipe calls for brown - should've gone for brown, i think. regardless, i'm glad i tried it, but won't be making this one again.

Did not like this recipe. Found that when I added the apples the consistency of the caramel changed. Had to add three more apples. Who likes to stress when they are making a simple crisp? Not me.

We loved it. It was quick and easy to make and it is easy to see that it can be modified to suit different tastes. This will be a regular at our house.

Sounds like some of the other reviewers burnt their caramel or cooked it too long. This is a simple preparation and if the directions are followed, turns out great. For a "crunchier" texture to the crisp, there are a number of ways to go: cook the crisp separately, and add toward the end of cooking the fruit; add more substance to it with nuts or oats; DON'T use a Cuisinart to blend it! Keep it chunky by clumping the flour and butter by hand. It can also be added to the fruit in stages, first one layer, cook for 20 minutes, then another. You can also vary the apples. We loved it!!

I made this for Valentine's day and my husband really enjoyed it. It tastes like apple pie without the crust. It was easy to put together. The lemon juice made the caramel a bit sour, but the caramel was easy enough to work with and tasted fine when it was all done. I will make this again...though I may reduce the lemon juice next time.

The caramel went to hard ball stage when I added the apples, so it was in clumps when I put it in the baking dish. It did soften during baking but I think I would double the caramel. I used all granny smiths which were fine and added 1 cup old-fashioned oats to flour mixture. I find it easiest to use my cuisinart to mix in the butter and flour and just stir in the oats.

Recipe was ok. Caramel flavor not as I expected. Texture of crumb topping was not crispy.

I used 3 gala and 3 granny smith. Do agree that the recipe could use 2 more apples and I will decrease the lemon juice a bit. I doubled the amount of caramel and everyone loved this dessert. It was very easy and I will make it again. I like the idea of the oatmeal so will try that next time.

This is a very good and surprisingly rich dessert. I took the other reviewer's suggestion and added two more apples (I used pippin). I also added some chopped walnuts, rolled oats and ground cloves to the topping, reducing the flour slightly. My caramel had a slightly bitter flavor, but undoubtedly I cooked it at too high a temperature; this will always cause caramel to become bitter. Just take it easy while you are cooking it. I gilded the lily by serving this warm with vanilla ice cream. Would definitely make this again.

This was not a 'crisp' as the title says and the comments stated. The ratio of fat to flour was incorrect for it to be crisp. Yes, oats would help. It was too sweet for me; that is easily fixed and is, of course, a personal taste thing. The apples were mushy. I used Pippins. Would Golden Delicious stay more formed? Perhaps. I won't make it again.

Decent recipe but I agree with Cook from Nashville that the addition of lemon made the caramel bitter.(Mine was not overcooked either.)However, once baked with the apples covered with the topping it mellowed out a bit. I felt there should be more apples and in fact increased the recipe by 2 apples which was still not enough. Brought to a dinner party of 10 and was short by one serving! Two friends shared. Everyone seemed to enjoy it none the less. Would likely make again.

Delicious! My husband says I should have made a double recipe. Made an awesome dessert to bring along to a dinner at a friend's house. I would caution that the caramel doesn't need as long to cook as the recipe recommends - I burnt it the first time and had to start over. I liked the soft texture of the topping - reminded me of a cobbler.

This recipe rocks! Honestly, I don't understand where the 1 fork review comes from -- I followed all the directions and it came out just beautifully. I would say that the topping could maybe use some oatmeal or something to make it more of a texture contrast but really it was amazingly tasty. Will absolutely make again.

I was very disappointed in this. The addition of the lemon juice to the caramel imparted a burnt, bitter taste to the entire dish. (And no, I did not burn the caramel - I make it all the time for other desserts.) Also, the topping was nothing exciting. Maybe it would be better without the lemon juice, but I think I will just stick to my other recipes for apple crisp.
