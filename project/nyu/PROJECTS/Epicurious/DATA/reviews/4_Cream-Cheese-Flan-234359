Made this to rave reviews. I wasn't sure if the people I was making it for would like flan so I chose this recipe because of the cream cheese--it's reminiscent of cheesecake. This is a good choice for introducing flan to an American audience.

I prefer the normal flans. This tasted to me too much of canned milk and was too dense. If you do make this recipe, to make the caramel, just put the sugar directly into a pan you don't care too much about and stir, stir, stir. Forget about adding the water. I used a generous cup of sugar and it still made way too much caramel.

This is so good! It is tons easier to make the caramel by simply broiling 1 cup of white sugar in the baking dish itself. Watch it carefully until it is medium amber in color and completely melted. Even if it gets a tiny bit burnt, it still tastes great and is so easy. Just make the rest of the recipe as listed.

I made this for a weekend lunch with a friend. Absolutely spectacular. I don't generally like flan but wanted to try something different. I took the other reviewer's advice and replaced the water in the custard w/ the remaining evap milk. Amazing creamy delicious texture and flavor. Will definitely be making it again!

This was very similar to the cheese flan that I've had made by my Puerto Rican husband's family, but a little bit lighter. I made it for a dinner party and it was absolutely delicious.

Quick and easy! Some of my caramel hardened probably cooked too long. I served it for Cinco de Mayo everyone loved it. Also didn't use water. I even lightened it up with both lowfat cream cheese and evap milk. I omitted extra yolk still delicious!

My Tia Ruthie made Flan just like this, except with regular milk instead of evaporated milk. I tried the evaporated and it tastes just like she made it. Yum.

Excellent flan recipe. It has replaced my other quick and easy flan recipe! Agree with other reviewers to eliminate water in caramel and eliminate water in flan -- just use whole can of evaporated milk. I made in an oval French white pyrex casserole and came out beautifully.

I want to try this recipe but using individual molds/ramekins -anyone tried doing it this way instead of the loaf pan? If so, how many molds did it make and how long did you cook for?

Wow! Have been looking for a recipe for cheese flan since having it in Puerto Rico some 10 years ago. Made this for our Spanish-themed Oscar party to universal raves. Took earlier suggestions of (1) eliminating water in caramel - it worked fine with just sugar, and (2) eliminating the water in the flan, and instead using the whole can of evaporated milk - might have made it a tad more rich, but that's not a bad thing - just serve very small pieces...

Wonderful texture and great flavor-not too sweet. My guests loved it. Very easy to make. I also omitted the water in the flan and used the whole can of evaporated milk because I didn't have another use for the balance.

Love this recipe. Reminds me of favorite Cuban Miami Restaurants version. I make individual servings instead though. Made it three times and everyone who loves creamier flan loved it. Except for my husband who prefers the lighter more jello-y type (the way his mother makes it) One problem - two out of three times my sugar has crystalized instead of carmelizing. What am I doing wrong? I'll try no water as suggested next time. This last time used 6 whole eggs and omitted the water and added whole can of evaporated milk. What can you do with leftover milk?-yuck.

Wonderful flan---not as sweet at most, more like cheesecake without the tanginess. Great texture, too. I also just caramelized some sugar, no water, and it was delicious. A new staple in our house!

Thank heaven! This recipe was originally published in Bon Appetit in November of 1995 or 1996 and I have since misplaced the magazine. Now I can make and enjoy it again.

As the others have said, this is good and easy. I live in Spain, the home of flan, and served this to my a husband, who is Spanish. He thought it was wonderful, similar to a cheese flan we've had when dining in Ávila, his home. A comment from him....half the caramel sauce is enough. He thought there was too much, and I agree. My flan was swimming, and that's not the way it's done here.

I have made many flans, but this was the best. Very smooth, delicious. Needed to bake a little longer, but, perhaps, my oven.

I thought this flan was easy to prepare and excellent overall. Everyone who tried it was impressed. And it was still great two days later. A definite keeper.

Exellent, quick and easy to prepare. I agree with the previous cook that carmelized version is much better. So...do not disolve sugar in the water. Simply melt the sugar on medium heat until brown and liquid. Follow the instructions for the rest of the recipe.

It was just o.k. I think I much prefer the caramel flans.
