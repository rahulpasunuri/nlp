My husband made this using banana peppers...the long yellow ones. They were WONDERFUL!

The presentation for this dish is wonderful, especially if you use red, orange, yellow and green peppers. I was a little disappointed with the taste. It didn't have much zing. Unlike the other reviewer, I didn't think there were enough olives here at all. I'd probably double them next time. I also added a few tablespoons of bread crumbs to thicken the consistency of the filling. All in all, it was very good, but not amazing.

This turned out really well for me. I cut down the amounts to make enough for 4 persons. The onions were nearly carmelized, and I think next time I will carmelize them before adding the peppers. The sweetness of the onions mingled nicely with the balsamic vinegar and the saltiness of the onions.

Pretty good, I am not a big olive fan so after a few bites to me it was sort of overpowering, you definately couldn't eat a lot of them, but my husband (a big olive fan)loved them.
