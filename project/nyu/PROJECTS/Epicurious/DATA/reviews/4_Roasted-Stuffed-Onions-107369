Really impressive; the red onions are definitely prettier; from the reviews I thought the onions would be a pain to scoop out, but with a melon baller it was no big. Everyone asked for the recipe, including those who don't cook. They just wanted to taste it again...Yay!

This stufing is amazing. I've been using it since 2002 when it was published -- the first time I went through the entire stuffed onion routine. My folks loved them, but to me the presentation wasn't worth the work. But the stuffing alone is a family favourite. I even got complaints last weekend (Cdn Thanksgiving) that I did not make enough for leftovers. I may have to double it for Christmas!

No more ho-hum bird for us. This is now our FAVORITE family recipe for Thanksgiving. The turkey is fabulously tasty with the five spice and plum glaze; the stuffing is deliciously different, and the gravy (when made by our daughter) is simply the best ever! We recommend using good quality stuffing mix (even cornbread works well) for the stuffing as well as high quality dry red wine. We found a not-too- sweet Damson Plum jam at a gourmet store which is perfect. We skip making the stuffed onions because we want all the stuffing for leftovers. Bravo to Gourmet magazine for this wonderful recipe!

This is one of my favorite thanksgiving sides - in fact I think that I may look forward to them more than the turkey! I found that using a melon baller to scope out the onion flesh was the easiest way to go (and you don't have to worry about cutting your finger tips off)!

I also omitted the onion stuffing and made a casserole dish of this. Last year I made it too, and it was too dry, the crusty bread round didn't complement the other flavors. This year I used a Portuguese Sweet Bread (9 inch round) and the result was an incredible salty/sweet combination. Reheated some this morning and it was fantastic since the cashews had softened more (I used them whole). Only other change I made was I used more liquid drizzled over it before baking to make it more moist. I will be making this every year, even my kids love it!

Didn't do the onions. In fact, I didn't even "cook" the stuffing. I had an "I Love Lucy" Thanksgiving where both hinges fell off the door of my beloved old stove and then the handle fell off too as the final insult. I wasn't able to complete any of my side dishes so I started nibbling on the prepped and ready to cook stuffing and it was so delicious that I couldn't stop - that's how good it was. Can't wait to make it again and actually cook it this time! I suspect it'll gain another "fork" at that point!

I didn't bother with the onions - just made enough to fill the bird. My whole family loved the Damson plum-glazed turkey, but thought that this stuffing didn't work well with the mellow Asian flavors. On the plus side, this was definitely the prettiest stuffing I have ever made.

I have made this stuffing twice and absolutely love it. HOWEVER..... I agree with those who say stuffing the onions was WAY too much work. I laughed a bit hysterically when I just now read the review of the person who said she almost cut her fingers off -- me, too! Especially if you're doing 12 or so, you get a bit cavalier. I will never stuff the onions again but plan to always stuff the bird and have a side dish of this delicious stuffing.

Any suggestions for an alternative to the cashews in this recipe? I made it as written last year to great reviews, but am doing it for the other side of the family this time around and there is a nut allergy there.

I used the stuffing Minus the onions with thanksgiving turkey this year (Baked in a separate pan) Delicious, and really simple.

someone else suggested this in an earlier review: "To make the onion-stuffing process easier, simply buy larger onions and cut in half...makes more of a bowl effect and will brown the top of your stuffing nicely." haven't tried it this way, but the original way was really good, and i would hate to see people not do the onions because it's so much work. personally, i didn't have much trouble using a melon baller. but then again, i only did two of them, not ten.

I will definitley say that the stuffing is wonderful! Loved the earthiness and color that the spinach gave and the crunch of the cashews and extra celery..i love lots of celery in my stuffing! But..... the onions are a pain in the you know what! It doesn't matter if you a are a "good" cook or not, they are time consuming. I ended up using a knife and still never got out enough onion "middle", almost cut my fingers off, said lots of "bad" words, and will smell onions on my hands for weeks I think!! I took the extra stuffing in pan baked by itself along with the stuffed onions. Everyone at Easter dinner commented on how wonderful the stuffing was, but the only thing that I heard about the onions were that they tasted good, but did not have enough stuffing in them. They are just not worth it to me and I am not a Betty Crocker cook! But, the stuffing I will use again for sure!

This was excellent... and I'm not normally a fan of stuffing. I made it with the onions and didn't find it difficult at all, though the onion scooping is a bit time consuming and I ended up using a quahaug knife rather than a melon scoop.

My partner and I made the stuffing (without using the onion shells) to complement the Plum Glazed turkey also found on this site. This stuffing was amazing! Don't cheat and try to use chicken broth -- I really think the key to the success of this recipe is the giblet stock. The stuffing kept well and was a big hit with both of our families -- a definite keeper, and well worth the effort. If you're looking for a stuffing to wow your friends and families with, this is DEFINITELY "the one."

Okay, I made this recipe last year with my Damsom Plum Turkey without stuffing the onions. It was a hit last year! This year I made the stuffing with my Duck with Blackberry Sauce, excluding the fact that I had no tukey giblets, I made it with Duck Giblets stock and it was just as wonderful. It was a hit people practically drinking it and me being one of them! Wonderful Stuffing!!!!!

Made this stuffing (without stuffing onions) for Thanksgiving dinner last year, and my family and I loved it. We've tried a lot of different stuffings in our time, from Stove Top to a Goat Cheese and Wild Rice stuffing to the more traditional sausage and cornbread, and this beat them all hands-down. It's savory and hearty, with lots of great texture, and is a perfect complement to mild turkey meat and sweet cranberry sauce/relish. For the flavor and satisfaction without the hassle of gutting the onions, try making JUST this stuffing. (I'm sure doing the onion-part is great; we just didn't bother with it.) It'll end up being a favorite.

ignore the negativity of resonses. They obviously are Betty Crocker Cooks. I made this dish Onions stuffed as well as the turkey stuffing and am repeating it again this year. It was the most fabulous presentation. All my family knows I am a good cook and I don't have to impress anyone but I love a great idea and this recipe is great

To make the onion-stuffing process easier, simply buy larger onions and cut in half...makes more of a bowl effect and will brown the top of your stuffing nicely. I love this presentation and one less huge bowl on the table at thanksgiving is a blessing.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving last year. While it does take a bit of time to prepare it was well worth it. The family ooed and aahed and most importantly it tasted delicious! I was asked by several members for a repeat this holiday season. I think it's become a Thanksgiving tradition! * Making the stuffing a day in advance as suggested helps avoid heavy labor the day of * I found a melon-baller to be ideal in order to scoop out the onion shells * Water chestnuts are a great substitute for cashews to avoid allergies

Couldn't wait to review this recipe! Wow--wwwaaaaaayyyy too much work for the payoff. To get those onions scraped so there were only a couple of layers on the outside took an incredible amount of time!! I cooked for 15 and thought this would be a cute way to present stuffing-- after the pain and suffering I will never, repeat never make this again! (And I'm willing to do a lot for a good meal!) Beware!!!

I made the entire Gourmet Thanksgiving dinner, and loved all of it, but the stuffing was the real star of the show. I would leave out the stuffing of the onions and just serve tons on the side though.

The stuffing is outstanding, and I made both meat (with turkey bacon) and vegetarian versions. However, I'll probably skip the roasted onion bit next time around. I spent a lot of time scooping the middle out of the onions and in the end, I didn't find there was enough additional benefit. The stuffing works brilliantly on its own as a side dish.

This was one of the most delicious stuffings we have had. I usually try something different each Thanksgiving and this is a keeper. Moist and the spinach and cashews add wonderful texture and color.

This recipe is too good to only bring out during the Holidays! I have shared it with all my friends.

These were great--I made the vegetarian version and they were a huge hit with carnivores and vegies both! I will definitely make these again--I think they'd be great with pork, too

I found this to be an excellent recipe with great flavor, which is hard for me to find as I am on a sodium restricted diet, but like all things onion. Due to the fact of the sodium restricted diet I did need to make some substitutions to pull the sodium level down, I used ground sausage instead of bacon and homemade salt-free bread and homemade salt-free stock. These onions are something that can be made at any time, not just with a roast turkey - would be great with either chicken or pork as well -- a truly great side dish, never thought of stuffing an onion.
