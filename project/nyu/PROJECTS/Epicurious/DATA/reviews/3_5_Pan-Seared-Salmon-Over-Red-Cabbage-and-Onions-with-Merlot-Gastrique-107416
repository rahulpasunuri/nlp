Pairing salmon with cabbage is kind of ridiculous. So they took a recipe for pork and tried to adapt it. Really doesn't work very well. As with much here, the interesting thing is the sauce..the salmon itself is less than pedestrian. Sauce can work with chicken and pork of course, from which it was derived. One CAN use a red wine sauce with salmon..tho this recipe isn't it.

Based on the other reviews, I cut the sugar in half. I also reduced the sauce much more than the recipe called for. I think it was about a 1/3 of a cup by the end, but it was delicious! Gastrique is caramelized sugar deglazed with vinegar for a savory sauce.

Not nearly as daunting to make as I first thought and good flavors. I used beef stock instead of broth for a richer sauce.

I substituted a roasted vegetable stock, and added a bit of white pepper. Excellent!

Actually, I would cut the sugar by 1/4 TBSP... :-)

I liked this one alot but also changed it a bit. I served it over pan fried asparagus instead of cabbage and it was quite good. I liked the gastrique but would cut the sugar by about 1/4 cup next time, a little too sweet. I paired this with a top quality, aged pinot noir from Oregon and they complimented each other nicely. Will try again for sure!

Yummy. Substituted Splenda for sugar-- seemed to work just fine. Served it with the red cabbage and onions-- divine. A Gourmand's delight.

Well, it might be healthy- but it's not overly delicious.

Braised cabbage is so often paired with pork, that I was glad to try this recipe just for its differing approach. I used my own recipe for braised cabbage that I finished in the oven as I set about preparing the gastrique (what is the definition of "gastrique" BTW?). The gastrique prep has a few steps but plenty of time to put the dish together while the cabbage cooks. I used an even milder fish--tilapia--that I broiled with good results. A simple side of boiled new potatoes was all this dish needed. It's an excellent chance to show that sometimes red wine goes with white fish!

I am mainly reviewing the gastrique which was delicious with the salmon. I used half the sugar per other reviewers, but next time I will keep the full amount as I like a slightly sweeter sauce when serving Salmon. It was great, easy to make and I will sure to make this again.

Both my young son and husband balk at red cabbage. They loved it. My husband, who does not like balsamic vinegar, enjoyed the sauce. My son, who never likes sauces on his fish, couldn't get enough of it. This is a keeper.

Delicious recipe. Onions and cabbage are an unlikely companion for the salmon. They enhance the flavor of the salmon. Husband loved it and cat attempted to try it. Felt healthy even if it had no greens.

Needed a new way to fix salmon, and this is it! I substituted Syrah for the Merlot as it was the only red wine on hand, and broiled the salmon drizzled with olive oil, salt & pepper. My discrinimating 13 year old loved it as well.

I made this for my folks and my mom doesn't even like fish. Everyone absolutely LOVED it. THe salmon was moist and juicy and the sauce was amazing ! The only thing I want to make sure to change is to add the cornstarch to the water before adding it tot he sauce. I should have known to do that but since the recipe didn;t say that I goofed.

My boyfriend and I are studying in Rome, cooking for ourselves for the first time. This was the first time either of us made salmon and it was one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had. We served it with rice and sauteed brussel sprouts. Delicious!

pinot noir is an excellent match for salmon, and its earthiness should complement the cabbage nicely.

I tested this out the other night, considering it for a dinner party. It's nice, and good for cold weather. Agree with the reviewer who suggested halving the sugar syrup in the merlot gastrique; thought the sweetness drowned out both the cabbage and the wine/beef balance in the sauce. QUESTION: wine pairing, anyone? I just had a glass of the merlot I used in the sauce, but, again, the sweetness of the sauce didn't bring out the best in the wine with the meal. Maybe reducing the sugar will solve the problem, but has anyone found a pairing worth mentioning? Thanks!

I loved the combination of fish and cabbage. The sauteed cabbage and onions as well as the beef broth in the gastrique made it seem hearty yet it is such a healthy dish. I used Chianti instead of Merlot in the gastrique. I just can't stand Merlot but it still turned out very well. I will definately make this again.

I repeat, tricky but delicious. The fish and cabagge a perfect combine. Serve with a stem of thyme poked thru the salmon. I love it.

This dish was sooo good that it caused me to write my first review. I followed the instructions precisely. It was absolutely great!!!! Fabulous combination of sharp and sweet. Also very hearty dish.

Very good, although I would not neccessarily make the cabbage portion of it again. I even used, gasp, a beef bouillon cube! The gastrique made this recipe!!

I must admit, as a not so experienced cook, I was fumbling a bit, trying to juggle 4 dishes at once. I kept tasting the sauce as it cooked, and it seemed off, so I panicked convinced myself I did something wrong. But the work (and panic) was well worth it- the sauce was just gorgeous.

The gastrique is out of this world. I have made this recipe twice with the red cabbage and I have made the gastrique about 4 times with salmon and either rice or mashed potatoes. I find it easier to broil the salmon, just brush it with some good olive oil.

I made this dish for a special occasion and it turned beautifully. Not only did I get lots of compliments It was vey easy to follow and the finshed dish was visually pleasing. The only change I made is that the sauce was so delicious I decided to doubled the sauce.

I made this recipe for my dad's 55th birthday for about 12 people. I was amazed at how well it came out and how easy it was. Everyone raved about this recipe. I made it with baked asparagus and maui onions instead of regualr onions and I made a walnut parmasean risotto that is also on this site, it was absolutly amazing!!!! I would definetly make this again.

This could be one of the best dishes I've ever made! There are quite a few steps to this recipe but once you make it a couple of times you get more efficent at it. I don't care for red cabbage so I omitted it. I will definitely make this again.

I agree this dish does not look appealing when prepared, however, it was not awful - it was okay.

Very good as is, but excellent (in my family/friends' opinion) when "gastrique" is made with 1/2 as much sugar syrup. Of course, cook salmon as you please: a large fillet in 275 degree oven (lightly oiled, covered with thin lemon slices), surrounded by pans of boiling water, for 35 min. gives succulent fish, no overdone thin parts.

I know that I am in the minority here, but I thought that this dish was aweful! First, it is very unappetizing to look at wilted purple cabbage, pink salmon, and then topped with a brown sauce that looked like gravy. And the taste of it pretty much matched how it looked. The flavors did not blend at all! My husband who eats anything, was being nice, but agreed that it was a disposal dish. We then had cereal for dinner! I've been making recipes from this site for several years and this dish was the worst one that I've tried so far. Sorry!

I thought this was outstanding. Unfortunately, my husband and daughter REALLY don't like cabbage, but absolutely loved the salmon and sauce. I myself loved the salmon and suspect 99% of anyone else I served it to would love it as well.

This dish was excellent! I doubled it for a dinner party of 8. I was very skeptical about the cabbage, but it was delicious and very different.I served it with horseradish mashed potatoes.Everyone ate everything on their plate.I cooked the cabbage earlier in the day and cooked it much longer than the 12 minutes in order to get it soft. When it was done I just left it covered in the pot on the counter and then just warmed it up later.I also prepared the Merlot sauce before my guests arrived. Lastly, I didn't pan saute my salmon. Instead, I simply brushed it with a little olive oil and baked it at 400 for about 18 minutes. It was perfect and much easier when your trying to entertain. This recipe is a definite keeper!
