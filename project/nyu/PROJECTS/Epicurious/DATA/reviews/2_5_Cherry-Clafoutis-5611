This dish is gross. I think the ratio of eggs:flour might be off. It tasted like cherries with scrambled eggs.

I was disappointed by this recipe. The batter turned out curdled somehow and the center was mushy. The taste was good but texture was rubbery. I did a little research- the Julia Child recipe (check web) looks like it might be fool-proof and more authentic.

I made this recipe with freshly picked EVANS cherries. They tasted great within the recipe. But the preparation was rubbery and quite a disappointment. I guess I will make pies with the rest of my cherries. Thanks anyways.

This is a nice and simple dish which compliments a more savory egg dish well and is nicely accompanied by champagne

Used toasted hazelnuts in place of almonds, more lemon zest than was called for, and cut the sugar in half. The final result was great when served warm-- a little finishing crunch from the filberts, and the flavor of the cherries shone through.

Rubbery, and not sweet enough.

Was trying to find a cherry clafouti recipe similar to the one served at Feenie's on West Broadway and thought this might be the one. Fresh cherries are a must. The flavour of the dish was lovely however, the texture was too rubbery possibly a result of cooking it too long (even at the recommended time). I was hoping for a cake/custard-like consistancy. The top seemed to be runny when it fact, it was probably already done so do be mindful of checking for doneness and possibly reducing the cooking time.

This was a good clafouti recipe. I found the ingredients and the amounts just perfect, and nearly identical to other clafouti recipe. Just watch out for the fruit juices bubbling over the dish and onto the oven bottom!!

Excellent! Rather easy and extremely delicious, this has become my favorite summer dessert. The texture almost reminded me of a moist bread pudding, and it provides the perfect venue for fresh, sweet cherries. I love it so much I bought a cherry pitter just to have it more often.

Good; typical of the homey bistro dessert clafouti is!

Recipe ingredients seem to be in right amounts except for sugar. Taste was OK, but this clafoutis was not as sweet as some I've had in past. Was not impressed with the overall texture.

I anxiously awaited cherry season to make this recipe, but was disappointed. It was OK, but not special--and my expectations had been high. Second day leftovers were poor--very soggy.
