I had some leftover hearts of palm and was searching for a salad recipe to use them in. This one was just perfect and because I had them, I tossed in some corn and served on baby spinach. The color of the dish was great and it was delicious.

This recipe is decent when fresh, but it does not save well! I think it would be better with half as much onion, though.

Wonderful! Simple, but tasty. I did not have the beans for the palm salad in the ROAST PORK CALYPSO on this site so I used this recipe instead and it was perfect.

Serve the colorful salad over greens to make a colorful presentation. Despite the small amount of oil and vinegar, the salad atop the greens seems to have a usual amount of dressing because of the juiciness of the tomatoes and hearts of palm. A nice change from tossed or Greek salad we usually serve. Easy for a do-ahead dinner.

Served it over butter lettuce and it was very good. Will definitely make it again and the dressing was delicious.

I have made this dish over and over again for years. It's great in the summer when the tomatoes are at their peak. Great with grilled fish or steak and a good crusty bread to soak up the juices. I also add pitted Kalamata olives, marinated artichoke hearts and (since I have an extensive herb garden)vary the herbs from time to time. Try fresh rosemary, oregano or thyme.

I love hearts of palm and was looking for a recipe for them, but they seem to go better in a dish where they stand out more. Good, but not great.

Easy and delicious. None left over w/4 dinner guests. I sprinkled some dried basil to give the fresh an extra punch.
