My husband and I thought that this recipe was very tasty, but needed a dipping sauce...marinara, perhaps?

Quite a lot of work for a bland dish.

Reading a recipe thoroughly greatly increases your chances of "knowing when to batter the eggplant".

In the south, we use biscuit mix, sugar, milk, egg, vanilla in batter. Yeah, they float! Sprinkle with table sugar when ready to eat

You forgot to give the correct instructions on how to make this dish. It doesn't even mention when to coat the eggplant with batter.
