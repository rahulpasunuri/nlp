The taste and color were marvelous and well-received by our guests. We served this rice with grilled salmon and will continue to do so in the future.

I omitted the turmeric and instead of sauteeing the green onions, just stirred them in at the end, along with a cup of thawed frozen green peas. This made the perfect light side dish to a fairly assertive bourbon chicken entree. The leftovers would make great fried rice.

Made it with brown rice and it was very good. But I've been tossing lemongrass into my rice for years, and this wasn't terribly different.

A big success paired with Steamed Snapper w/ ginger, lime and cilantro. I followed the recipe exactly as well although could have skipped the last step, re-heating in the skillet with the extra green onions, without hurting the outcome.

Love it, followed the recipe exactly, and it was great. I served it with pan fried Walleye fish and a green salad with avocado and candied pecans, it was a hit!

Excellent and easy. I followed Olive, NY's suggestions and reduced the oil to 1T / 1t, increased turmeric to 1/2t - delightful. This one goes in the permanent collection.

This has become one of my favorite recipes. Like a previous reviewer, I have lemongrass thriving in my garden, and this is a great way to use it. It's especially wonderful with curries and dishes made with coconut milk.

Liked it very much, but next time will use a bit less oil---1 T for sauteeing onions (standard amount for pilaf)is plenty, & 1 t for green onions at the end. You can vary the color with the amount of turmeric---I put in 1/2 t and got a rich golden rice. Lovely subtle taste.
