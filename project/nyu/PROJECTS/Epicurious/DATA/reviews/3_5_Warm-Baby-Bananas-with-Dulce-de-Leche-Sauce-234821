Soooo good, and so easy! This recipe tastes like it takes a long time to prepare, but actually takes just minutes. I used regular bananas and they worked great. I just cut them in half (across). And I didn't have any of the dulce de leche liqueur, just used a bit of Frangelico. You could probably try different liqueurs with this. Definitely serve with good vanilla ice cream. Yum!

I served this dish this weekend as a simple dessert after the "Grilled Porterhouse Steak w/ Horeseradish Cream." My husband and guests were thrilled. All voted it as a "repeat" recipe. It was really easy to prep the bananas and caramel sauce before dinner, then heat and assemble after removing the main course from the table. I did have to substitute regular bananas for the baby bananas, as it is very difficult to find ripe bananas in the grocery stores here, much less something unique as the small ones.(I feel lucky if I spot a plantain on alternate Wednesdays during the summer) I don't think the regular bananas were were a detractor, and since I had to purchase a rather large bottle of dulce de leche liqueur, which they recommend using within 6 months of opening, I think this will be a regular dessert at our table. Thanks for publishing this yummy, easy to make dessert.
