There's a bit of prep involved, and a pretty long ingredient list, but we loved these and I will make them again for sure!

Sauce only: We only used the dipping sauce. I made only 1/4 of the sauce for our family and made lettuce wraps with leftover chicken stew. It was an easy and delicious way to enhance leftovers.

I made this recipe with tuna instead of chicken for my pesca-vegetarian friends. It's great! I can do without the sauce personally, but my friends liked it. Go with low-sodium soy sauce, and you can probably cut it a little unless you like salty...

We all loved this recipe in our family. I made sure to liberally salt and pepper the chicken. We shall definitely make this recipe again.

Made this dish for friends when it came out in the Bon Appetite Jan issue--the loved it and so did I. It took some time to cut veggies and set up for stir-fry... but was worth the trouble. P.S. not great for leftovers, it gets soggy.

If I could rate this a negative, I would. This is so BLAND, especially for all the work involved. Its like chop suey - bland, bland, bland! This is the first recipe from this site that I have been disappointed in. There are much better lettuce wrap recipes out there (with much less chopping).

I made this for an asian themed dinner party and it was a success. Several people made comments about how good it was. At the last minute I could not find sake so I ommited it. No one could tell that anything was missing. I read the review about the red cabbage bleeding and coloring the entire dish so I soaked the cabbage in water for about 30 min. before cooking and it turned out fine. I also only used red cabbage. I will make this again.

I thought this recipe was great. I used it as an appetizer for a holiday party, and everyone raved about it. I used baby boston leaf lettuce which was easy to roll and just the right size.

the dipping sauce was a bit salty for my taste...

This recipe just didn't have the taste punch for all of the work involved. It was a little watery and very mild. And the romaine leaves were difficult to use. I've made similar recipes using tofu, ground beef, and butter lettuce leaves that were much better.

When this issue of Bon Apetit arrived I couldn't wait to try this recipe and the sausage dumpling recipe. After hours laboring in the kitchen, these recipes were a huge disappointment. The flavors didn't work well together, the red cabbage turned everything pink, and the filling just didn't work well in the romaine.

Don't let the number of servings fool you, it's all relative to the size of the lettuce leaf and how much you put in. Excellent recipe. For a lower fat version omit oil for vegetables and use non-stick spray in a non-stick pan. A definite recipe box keeper
