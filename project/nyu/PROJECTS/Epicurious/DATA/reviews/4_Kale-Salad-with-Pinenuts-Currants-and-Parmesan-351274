Mid-winter farmer's markets are only providing mature curly kale. I followed the recipe with a couple of adjustments to accommodate the less tender kale. One was tear the kale into pieces off the stems. The second was to cook the leaves briefly in simmering water, until they were bright green, and then shock them in cold water. I also let the salad marinate in the dressing for several hours before serving. It was well-received and my husband gave it two thumbs up.

Very tasty for a raw kale salad. Considering the health benefits of kale, I thought this was delicious. Kale is pretty tough and bitter but the sweetness and acidity in the dressing balanced the flavor. I dressed the salad a couple of hours before eating. Could have marinated longer I'm sure. Used dried blueberries, which was a good substitute.

I love the premise for this salad and have modified it in a variety of ways: (1) I don't cut the kale, but tear it by hand; (2) when serving vegans, I use nutritional yeast instead of cheese; (3) I prefer toasted sesame oil instead of olive for a nuttier taste; (4) I add fresh curly parsley (1/8th of recipe); (5) I sometimes add fresh mint leaves, shredded or sliced for a refreshing pop. Thanks for all the previous comments!

This was my fist kale salad and it was surprisingly good. I used bagged chopped Tuscan kale from Trader Joe's and followed the recipe closely except that I used regular balsamic vinegar, fresh pomegranate seeds and toasted walnuts because that's what I had on hand. Will definitely make it again.

This is yummy and so healthy! I've received big thank yous from everyone I share it with! Prefer craisens (no need to soak) and often substitute walnuts/pecans. Definitely better after sitting overnight in the frig.

Surprisingly good! I needed to serve it in a hurry so I microwaved the currants with the white balsamic vinegar. It seemed to work okay.

Like the Cook From Chappaqua's review, I had this salad at the gourmet food shop in that town and fell in love. I was so happy to find a recipe. I buy washed baby kale at my local grocery store and it makes the prep super easy and no softening is needed. I use toasted chopped walnuts and prefer the currants unsoaked; they add a little texture. Yum!

it is also delicious with fresh pomegranate seeds!!!

Nice! I used dried cranberries, but not sure that soaking them in the balsamic made a worthwhile impact. I also used baby kale, but am curious what the result would be with "adult" kale. Will try this again following other suggestions to sub the pine nuts for sliced almonds, and will add more cheese.

This is a keeper and I've had requests for the recipe every time I've served it to guests. I agree with other reviewers that making it a day ahead is a plus. Fantastic and so healthy!

This was delicious! I used sliced almonds instead of pinenuts and dried cranberries instead of currants(personal preferences), but otherwise made it as is. I agree with reviewers who said it gets better after a day or two - the kale softens up and absorbs more flavour. My winter go-to salad.

Delicious salad, used regular balsomaic and raisins which was fine but--salty! I think 1 tsp is too much.

Great recipe! I used regular balsamic because that was what I had and microwaved the currants in the balsamic for 25 seconds to jump start them. I also used very coarsely chopped toasted almonds in place of pine nuts. This was a great dish to make an hour or two ahead and serve at room temp. It was also great the next day.

Definitely a wonderful year round salad recipe for Kale. Especially good if made the day before to let flavors blend and Kale soften. I added 1c diced Red Onion, 1c Golden Raisins instead of Currants and 1 1/2 c of a shredded brick of Stella Parmesan Cheese.

I found some "baby" kale that made this recipe super easy and soft even the day I made it. Husband would not try it until I piled it upon a gluten-free pizza. All gone and wonderful. Will definitely try this all year around.

I wouldn't reserve this for winter- it's pretty good with some spicy dry rub ribs and a whole lot healthier than cole slaw! I made it with regular curly Kale (I've never even seen Tuscan kale) I had no currants so I used raisins and I had no pignoli's so I used pecans and a little chopped fresh rosemary for the piney flavor. It was a hit and it looks very attractive on the plate. A bit on the sweet side, but it complimented the ribs very well. If I can ever get all the ingredients, I'll try it again.

I was a little skeptical about serving this without trying it first for company with friends. I used golden raisins as I did not have currants on hand. I marinated the raisins for about 6 hours in our Robbins Family Farm White Balsamic 18 year old Vinegar. The Recipe was a hit! And the best thing is you can prepare it and let it sit while preparing your dinner. Very delicious!

Yum! Tried this salad first at BP Burger in Aspen CO. I recreated it at home, using this recipe, but with a couple of changes. First, I pulsed the kale in a food processor to turn it into tiny ribbons. I used dried mission figs (also pulsed in the processor) instead of currants. I also think that golden raisins would be delish! Will make this again & again - I'm eating the leftovers right now, and I think this is even better on day 2 (unlike most salads). Would even work with a quality bottled dressing, like cucumber shallot vinagrette.

Simple and delicious. I didn't care for the soaked currants, so I used the remaining currants I hadn't soaked.

The gourmet shop in my town makes this salad which sells out daily before noon! Delish! I didn't have white balsamic so I used 1 tbs regular balsamic, 1 tbs white wine vinegar, and instead of honey I used agave nectar. Also, I didn't have time to marinate the dried currants and used dried cranberries which was just fine. It came out great with no leftovers! I would use a little less salt next time. Can't wait to make it again, so easy!

Wonderful salad. I have made this now about 10 times. The secret is letting the kale soak in the vinegar dressing for several hours to soften up the leaves. Also, do soak the currants overnight. I make it exactly as it says but skip the parmesan.

This recipe was a great inspiration for my new crop of Dinosaur Kale and things I already had in my pantry. I used the juice and zest of one meyer lemon, balsamic vinegar, honey, EVOO, toasted pine nuts, cranberries, and topped it with Parmesan. Delicious!

This is amazing! I made it for Christmas and received rave reviews. I made it a few hours ahead, as I used regular kale and thought that it might need the extra time to "cook": it was even better as leftovers the next day. I did make a few substitutions: I used all balsamic vinegar as I am allergic to rice and therefore avoid rice vinegar; used cranberries in place of currents and pecans in place of pine nuts. I currently have another batch of it marinating right now, but with finely diced ricotta salata. I can't wait to try it! I highly suggest this!

This is a staple in our home now and friends always ask for the recipe. It is extremely versatile in that you can substitute other cheese, nuts and fruit with many different others (I used dried wild blueberries once - great). I also use any vinegar- based vinaigrette since it's the vinegar that "cooks" the kale. Just make sure you've let it sit in the vinaigrette long enough - you can tell by taste. I never use the honey or the rice wine vinegar because it seems to make the salad too sweet. I use any kind of kale except for dinosaur/lacinato. So so healthy and delicious, it's a main meal with roasted fish or meat on top, or even a poached egg with a dollop of aioli.

Excellent salad! Always get requests for the recipe. Packed with nutrition. My diet avoids sugars and dairy so I modify the recipe as such: Use Toasted Sesame Oil instead of Olive; Omit salt, honey, and cheese; Add Nutritional Yeast if in a cheesy mood; I soak the currants in a small vessel with just enough vinegar to cover them. Kale is quite sturdy so I often toss the ingredients before work and have the salad with lunch, several hours later. It's not a problem, as the longer it marinates, the easier to digest but still hardy vs. limp.

Every time I have made this is has been a huge hit and people ask me for the recipe. One tip is that you don't have to soak the currants in a much Balsamic as they say. If you soak them in a really small container, you can use half the amount because they are not spread out along the bottom of a dish. This helps you to discard way less balsamic, if any at all.

I thought this was absolutely awful but didn't give it a rating because perhaps it's "just me," or maybe I don't like kale as much as I thought I did.

I'm not going to rate yet because what I have is a question. When I drain the currants, do I reserve the balsamic they were soaking in and use it in the salad, or do I discard? It doesn't say. I hate to throw away balsamic, but I'm wondering if that perhaps was what made TacomaFoodie's salad too acidic -- did she retain the soaking balsamic? How has everyone else made this?

This salad was delicious. I wasn't sure but trusted the ratings and it was great. I used raisins, balsamic vinegar and seasoned rice vinegar because those were what I had available. I used probably 1.5 times the dressing on a half pound of kale. I do not normally like extra dressing but this seemed to be the perfect amount. Everyone thought it was delicious and I think everyone was surprised at how good it was.

I liked this salad but it was not a universal favorite at my family Xmas party. I used regular balsamic vinegar since that is what I had available. I added alot more pine nuts. I loved the nuttiness of the kale. I also marinated it for over one hour...

I tried this and thought it has potential, but the dressing is very unbalanced, overly acidic and salty. No one else has commented as such, and I usually prefer a strong vinaigrette. Im withholding a rating, and wondering if I did something wrong. The fresh kale was delicious, and it's nice that you can make this so far in advance. Still, 3 T vinegar to 1 T oil sounds overly acidic  and it was. To be fair, I committed the cardinal sin of making substitutions, but I dont think these would matter. I used red kale and golden raisins since its what I had. It was a pretty combination, and the raisins added needed sweetness. They were juicy enough that I didnt soak them in vinegar. My white balsamic is an inexpensive one from Trader Joes; does this need a more refined vinegar? Ill try this again, but use ½ tsp salt, and only rice vinegar, honey and oil in the dressing. Another reviewers recommendation of cashews sounds good, too.

I made this salad to share at the office. It truly deserves the blue ribbon! This salad has a surprising and addictive flavor. My friends raved about it. (I followed the recipe and used tuscan kale, shaved parmesan, white balsamic...the number of TBSPs of white balsamic can be reduced for soaking the currants.)

I really can't get over how fabulous this is. I've made it twice now, and tonight, it received rave reviews from my picky, picky family! I made the whole thing a couple of hours in advance, so the kale would wilt significantly... wanted it to have the texture of cooked kale because the green itself can be so intense and chewy. I probably double the currants and pine nuts, but I don't really measure - those ingredients are just so delicious.

Wonderful!......and an interesting departure from mesclun or spinach. I couldn't find Tuscan kale, but the curly worked beautifully. I used kosher salt and did not find it too salty (though some of the salt may have remained in the bowl). I used regular balsamic and dried tart cherries. I think thin strips and marinating are the keys. Everyone raved!
