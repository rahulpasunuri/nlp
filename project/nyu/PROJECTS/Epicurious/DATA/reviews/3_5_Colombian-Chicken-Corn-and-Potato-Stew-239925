I didn't care for this recipe when I substituted papa criollas y guascas. It was bland even after I added tons of oregano and other spices I thought would complement the flavors. Kept messing with the leftovers and couldn't improve it any.

Maybe it was because I couldn't find guascas, but I thought this soup was nothing special at all. Wouldn't bother again.

This is my favorite soup ever. I have made it over and over and it's always a hit.

Had this in Columbia, must say this recipe is just as good.

This recipe is very similar, if not better than the Ajiaco I have been eating for years at a local Colombian restaurant. I made it the first time with oregano, it was great. I went out of my way to find the guascas and it was well worth it. Used an immersion blender to breakdown some of the papas criollas, and made aji, as recommended by another reviewer. I am thrilled to be able to make this at home. Yipeeee!

Excellent recipe! I'm Colombian and I've been eating ajiaco my whole life, we were craving ajiaco, so we get ready for the task. I just arrived to Chicago and I didn't know where to find substitutes for criollas and guascas (Basically what makes this dish what it is). The substitutes were great! I saute the onions a little bit and use parsley instead of cilantro just because that is the way mom does it... Anyway, pretty authentic

Easy availability of ingredients resulted in swapping the guascas for mexican oregano, fresh corn for frozen, and I used fingerling potatoes. I have never had Colombian food so I can't attest to it's authenticity. It was however declicious. The broth flavorful, smooth and silky. Will be making this one again.

We followed the recipe pretty closely. We added some red pepper flakes and a tad more oregano (couldn't find guascas). It's fairly low-salt, so you might need more. The accoutrement on top really bring out the flavor and the authenticity of the recipe. A keeper. I agree with the reviewer who said it's more chowder than stew. MMMMMMM. Next time we will make homemade tortillas, although the crusty bread was delish.

Delish! My husband is not a big soup lover and he could not get enough of this dish. I split the recipe and used a mix of potatoes, purple, red, yukon gold and found it to be a beautiful contrast of color as well as flavors. Rather than using cream I used a greek cheese style yogurt which added a tangy creaminess...I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe! I made a huge pot for me and my bf to eat throughout this week. I added carrots, cut into 1/2" chunks, for more color and flavor. I was taste-testing it in all the stages of the soup, and found that I liked it better without the sour cream and evaporated milk (which I used in place of heavy cream). The cream makes it taste too heavy. Also, I suggest cutting the boiling potatoes (I used red round) into 1/2" cubes so that you can get a bit of everything on your spoon (and into your mouth) with every bite. I didn't use avocado because the ones I bought, unfortunately, weren't ripe yet.

For those who thought this was bland: ajiaco is typically served with an aji picante on the side. It's a delicious spicy kick made of chopped cilantro, green onion, white vinegar, salt, and tiny (chopped) hot chiles. My family likes it without heat but my Colmbian relatives use lots of aji. Delish!

I would call it a chowder rather than a stew. The guascas give the dish a very distictive flavor, if you use oregano instead the flavor changes completely. I wouldn't use it

Good stuff. I couldn't find criollas, and not for lack of trying, so I used shredded russet potatoes instead, and the mixture did thicken nicely even before adding any crema. Don't be stingy with the capers or the cilantro.

My friends had me over last night and served this for my birthday dinner...I loved it! This stew has delicate flavors that nicely inhanced by the accoutrements without overpowering the dish. Served with crusty whole grain bread, too...mmmmm. I can't wait to make it...perfet for a rainy Sunday.

Just finished this for dinner and I have to say it was exceptional! I made a few minor changes - using 4 cups of broth and 6 cups of water, and adding more capers than called for (almost a half cup). I believe the capers are key - I included some of the brine and mashed a few of the capers up. I also mixed in a bit of cilantro and some lime juice to the crema for an extra kick. My husband is still raving about it!

Stew was better the second day after. Also added grated pecorino, and salt to help out with some flavor.

Just okay - I used the grated Yukon gold method, and I found that the potatoes did not break down sufficiently to produce a silky texture - my end result was a little watery. I did add caper juice to boost the flavor, but I found it created a salty soup that still was not packed with flavor.

not bad. probably will make again, sometime.

This soup is INCREDIBLE (!!!) with the following changes (it was bland initally): 1. To overcome the blandness, pour in some of the juice from the capers. 2. Dice up the capers before adding them to the soup (it disperses the flavor more evenly) 3. Add some hot sauce (not tobasco). I use asian chile sauce. This will now be the soup I deliver to new moms and dads when they're too busy to cook. It's true comfort food and very healthy.

This was fabulous! I've made it twice since the magazine came out and always get rave reviews.

This was good but not great. It would be totally bland without the capers. Not sure what it needs though, as I've never had a stew like this before.

Yum!! Made this yesterday for a gathering with the girls. They are all very health conscious and wanted something healthy that would make use of the fabulous fresh corn available in Ohio right now. This was delicious. I am not sure it would have been quite as exciting if you did not add the avocado, cilantro, crema and especially the CAPERS! Just ate leftovers and had to leave a review. The dog is licking the bowl right now!!
