Although my husband really liked this veggie stock, I personally didn't think it was as good as the Wolfgang Puck organic vegetable stock. It had a strong "roasted" quality, so if I ever made this again, I would probably not roast the veggies. It is probably just a matter of taste!

Excellent vegetable stock! I'll never use that stuff in a box again. The recipe is also very flexible. I didn't have enough shallots, so I threw in a trimmed and cleaned leek. I also had a parsnip in the fridge, I threw that in as well. I didn't have a small can of crushed tomatoes so I used about half a can of whole tomatoes and smashed them up. After the stock was done I put all of the veggies through a food mill to extract as much of their goodness as I could. I then put the stock through a fine mesh stainer. I ended up with a little over 4 cups of stock. Tomorrow I'm making vegetable barley soup; I have some tomatoes from my garden in the freezer. I can't wait!

Holy crap this is good. My friend tried to take the leftovers home and I started shaking for fear. DO NOT TAKE MY VEGGIE GRAVY AWAY FROM ME!!! I made some thick gravy from the stock by puree-ing some of the smooshed roasted veggies and adding it to the stock with some roux. I could (and did) eat it with a spoon. WARNING: this takes all day to make and you'll miss out on life as you make it.

Quick tip: pierce the onion chunks with a few cloves - maybe 3 or 4. It adds another subtle layer of flavor. I also strain the stock through cheesecloth. Of course, you could make consomme by filtering it through a raft of egg whites & crushed shells, but to me that seems like a little too much work for veggie stock.

I have made this several times. I made it first because daughter is a vegetarian, but now because it is so good. I double the amounts, using fresh veg, plus bits i throw in the freezer, plus 'mature' veg if I find at the local produce store. I roast it in two sheet pans. Don't usually use the canned tomatoes, but I do add plum tomatoes to the roasting veg. Really, really good.

I make one just like this (without tomatoes) and add middle eastern spices to it and matzoh balls and it makes chicken soup lovers swoon.

This is a fine recipe; however, I thought it was expensive for the results. I use vegetable broth often for many recipes since my daughter is a vegetarian. I used organic veggies from a local co-op and used fresh tomatoes from my garden rather than canned. As I said, it was a tasty recipe, but I'll stick to my usual method: tossing bits and pieces of leftover veggies in a freezer bag and boiling 'em up when enough is accumulated. I do think I'll roast them and add the wine - that was a nice touch.

Like others, I decided to try this recipe based on previous reviews, and I am glad I did. I just finished making this, thinking I would use it as a base for tomato garbanzo soup, but now that it is finished, I can't stop eating it. This would be an excellent base for soup, or to make quinoa or couscous. EXCELLENT!

Very time consuming, but well worth the trouble! After straining the stock, I yielded 4 cups, so I simmered down to 3 1/2 cups. I made this for the Roasted Vegetable Gravy and it was OUTSTANDING!

Labor intensive, but worth it. Double or quadruple the recipe if it's for turkey so you have enough for leftovers.

I was inspired by the rave reviews to make this recipe, and I'm very glad I did. It seemed like an awful lot of work for only 3 1/2 cups of end result, so I decided to double it...all of the vegetables were a little crowded in the roasting pan, but I just made sure that I roasted them long enough for the liquid to evaporate and the vegetables to get nicely colored, probably around 50-55 minutes. At first when I tasted the end result, I thought it was a bit too tomato-y, as I often do. However, when I used the stock in a recipe (I made quinoa with it tonight and added roasted red peppers and grilled squash), I thought it turned out really well. I'm going to make a vegetarian gravy (from a Cooks Illustrated recipe) with it next. Overall, very recommended.

Wonderful- Made this as a starter when we were entertaining some vegetarian friends and would gladly make it again (devout meat eater). Reminded me of a delicious vegetable consomme I had at Mas Farmhouse in the village. Added a parmesan rind during boiling, served with peas and diced carrots and parsnips I had blanched and a parmesan crouton. Simple pure flavor- highly recommend.

Fabulous stock! Much easier and healthier than traditional stock. I've used it as a base for gravy and for soup. Also, you can puree the vegetables rather than straining, for a thicker version. Lovely stuff.

I made this last year as an alternative for my vegetarian daughters. I'm making it again this year, for everyone. This is a rich, complex, wonderful gravy. It's suitable for turkey, chicken, beef, pork or vegetables. With all it's flavor, it has almost no fat. Who ever would have thought there could be a healthy gravy? I love it! This is an absolute must, and is much easier to make than it first appears. I did some substitutions - i used brown mushrooms and added a little extra parsley, but it's essentially foolproof.

I just made this stock in order to make the roasted vegetable gravy so that my vegetarian son would have gravy for his potatoes and stuffing on Thanksgiving. I don't think I have ever had better stock than this, meat or no meat! What incredible soup it would make! I came out with the amount stated, but I was careful to simmer at a very low simmer so as not to lose any of that precious liquid! I must say I did not even use cremini mushrooms since I only had white button. It did not seem to matter! I will definately make this again!!

Don't usually bother naking stock, but gave this a try - Thanksgiving and all. It is really delicious and easy. But I only finished with 2 cups of stock.
