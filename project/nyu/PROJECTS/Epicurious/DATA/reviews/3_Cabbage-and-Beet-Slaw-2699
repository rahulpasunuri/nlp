Extremely simple. Did not care for the caraway seed, as it was overpowering. May try a small amount of ground cloves next time. I agree with the other reviewer that the color is intense!

This is SO good and SO simple. i just mixed the beets in with the cabbage  it's a fabulous color! I did make a bit more dressing than called for.
