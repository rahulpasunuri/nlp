This is my favorite non-traditional chicken salad! It's equally good wrapped in a tortilla, stuffed in a pita, or piled on a croissant.

This was easy to make and assemble and absolutely delicious. Even the guys liked it!

We really liked this recipe as a no fuss dinner. I even used the precooked Tyson chicken breast and it was still very tasty. It was hard to fit everything in a pita, so we just piled everything on top. Definite keeper.

Curiously bland. Needs more dressing or ??? Maybe more vinaigrette with a little more seasoning for zip. I like the combination of ingredients, just needs a little more flavor.

This one is at the front of my recipes! Everyone loves it and it's so easy to adapt for different tastes (i.e. more bacon, less tomatoes, more cheese, etc.). It has replaced tuna salad as the luncheon choice!

Omitted egg and chicken, used sliced smoked turkey,Layered on french bread - spread one side with homemade mayo, then turkey, romaine, tomato, avocado, bacon, spread top with dijon, s&p. Delicious! Have made 3 or 4 times, always gets raves, even with meat-and-potatoes crowd.

Delicious! The combination of tastes and textures was delightful. I used wheat pitas and thick-sliced Virginia bacon. The dressing had enough zing to liven up the diced chicken, which can sometimes be rather bland. My husband, who is a self-professed "meat and potatoes man", loved these sandwiches. What a great way to use up leftover cooked chicken.

I made this for company on a hot day and it was a huge success. Even those who didn't normally like roquefort loved it and many had seconds. Those who were on a "diet" put the romaine on a plate and piled it high with the chicken salad. I would definitely make it again. It's great for a luncheon and can be put together the day before the event.
