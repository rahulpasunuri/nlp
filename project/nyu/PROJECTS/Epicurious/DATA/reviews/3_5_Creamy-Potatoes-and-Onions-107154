I wanted something besides mashed and found this! WOW...delicious! My husband said he wants the potatoes like this from now on! I have done something similar but never left the water to reduce before. Brilliant! Even good before I added the cream so if you want to make it a little lower in fat...it works. If you aren't careful, it will become soup...but that might not be a bad thing. Loved it!

I liked this a lot. It's nice to have a change from mashed potatoes all the time. It's great with low-fat or non-fat sour cream instead of the creme fraiche. But definatly add salt and pepper to taste or else it can be a little plain. Still, a lovely looking dish!

I thought the dish was good but not great. Mashed potatoes would have been preferred with the steak bordelaise.
