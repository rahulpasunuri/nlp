This came out delicious. I did what the other reviewers suggested and doubled the garlic. I also used a couple anchovies in the first process to cook along with the onions. I also doubled the red pepper flakes, but this proved to be a bit too spicy, so I probably won't do that next time. Overall- a good hearty stew!

Made some changes based on other reviews. Added oregano, 2 extra cloves of garlic, T of anchovy paste and clams. Also, it needed more crushed red pepper, so I doubled the amouont. DELICIOUS and super fast and easy. Served with crusty bread and a salad.

The recipe was a good basic cioppino, but a little blah...next time i will add anchovie paste and some more crushed red pepper...maybe a little extra garlic too...but overall a good, a quick and easy recipe. I served it with toasted baguette for dipping.

OH YEAAAAAA!!!!!! This is great, after looking at the other revues, i added 2oz anchovie fillets which gave a nice fishy saltiness and during saute added 1/4 cup of wine to give it litlle bit of a deglaze. I also added 2 habenero's for heat. OH MY! this is some great stuff!!!!

I am not rating the recipe, just wanted to offer advice on how to make it more flavorful. Besides adding more garlic, sea salt, and spices (marjoram, thyme, oregano, and basil), I'd also add more wine (1-2 cups Sauvignon Blanc). Sauvignon Blanc gives it more flavor than Chardonnay typically. You may also want to take the time to throw shrimp shells in water and boil them. Cook this down and add it when you're adding the clam juice.

We really liked this, but I did add 18 small clams and about 1/2 lb andouille.

Just not that tasty.

This dish was bland, bland, bland. I followed the recipe to the letter. Where did I go wrong?

Yuck. Granted I'm not a huge seafood fan but this dish was a disappointment. I like crabmeat, shrimp, scallops individually, not in this recipe.

Wonderful! I was sick and cranky and wanted something easy and yummy for dinner. I made a few small adjustments: because I got everything at Trader Joe's, I got frozen bay scallops and frozen halibut, and frozen cooked medium shrimp. I thawed everything in cold water and used as normal, except the shrimp which I threw in at the end. Also, they didn't have clam juice, so I used water, salt, and a splash of lime juice. It turned out EXCELLENT. I made it for my family, which includes a 10-year-old, and they gobbled the whole thing up. Great with pugliese or some other good quality bread for dipping. Oh--and don't afraid to use more garlic. I used 4 huge cloves.
