I was looking for a recipe for fresh apricots that was not a sweet baked good. Decided to try this one and LOVED the grilled apricots! I'll be grilling a lot more apricots in the future -- it really brings out the sweet taste. The rest of the recipe was just so-so and I wouldn't bother to make it again.

I LOVE the fresh, summer flavors in this salad. I also felt like it needed some more zip, so I tossed the bulgur in the pesto with some extra lemon juice. I substituted pistachios for half of the nuts, just for fun. I think either goat cheese or feta would push this toward 4stars.

The pesto needed something else to make it work. It was too "earthy" tasting.

I agree with the Philly cook. I think it would not take much to amp this dish up. The feta is a great idea. The apricots were great. I loved the tartness. A great counterpoint. Maybe some good briny sea salt to kick it up????

Overall, this was a good dish. But I felt like there was not enough pesto to adequately flavor the bulgur. To streamline this recipe, I poached the chicken indoors and did not grill the apricots. I sprinkled feta cheese over the top; the salty feta was a great counterpoint to the sweet apricots.

This is what I did and loved it - Cook bulgur in less time than called for but used chicken stock. Tore up a store bought rotisserie chicken and used some dried apricots and dried cherries. Toasted the almonds and chopped them coarsely in processor with the shallots and parsley. Combined all of the above with the juice of a lemon and a good shot of olive oil Garnished with more of the slivered almmonds and parsley. Absolutely wonderful and a keeper.

This is my first one-fork review of a Bon Appetit recipe. They are usually dependable. In this case, the pesto was leaden and pasty. Even with more than the called for amount of lemon, it was murky. The apricots also added very little to the dish, in my opinion. The components are independently heavy and do not complement each other. Skip this one.

great easy salad. i used rotisserie chicken instead of the grilled and it tasted great. mixed the chicken into the salad at the end. added some lemon and used dried apricots that i broiled for about 4 minutes. delicious!

This was great for an easy weeknight dinner. I couldn't find apricots so I used fresh white peaches. They really add a lot, so don't skip that part.
