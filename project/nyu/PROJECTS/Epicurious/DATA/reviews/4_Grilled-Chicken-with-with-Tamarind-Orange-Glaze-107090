This was wonderful. Chicken was very moist and the glaze added a special touch. We served the glaze on the side rather than pouring over chicken and rice ad I'm glad we did or I think the flavor would have been too strong. We also had stir-fried veggies with it. I couldn't find tamarind paste though so used a little plum sauce instead.

Loved this chicken with a sweet sauce. I didn't find tamarind paste so I had to substitute with a tablespoon each: dried apricot, date, prune, lemon juice blended to a paste. It was still very yummy!

great recipe. Added some chili garlic sauce to the glaze and also omitted 3 tbsp butter without any problem.

Is it just me or does it take longer than 25 minutes to reduce 40 oz. of liquid to 3/4 cup?

This is a fabulous recipe. The tamarind-orange glaze has a wonderfully rich flavor and cooked nicely on the grill. We served this with the suggested white rice as well as grilled turnips and sauteed brussel sprouts. Our friends raved about the tamarind-orange glaze.

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either, I thought. I discovered tamarind recently and tried a tamarind marinade for pork as well as a tamarind pie, and this didn't have as good a flavor as either of the others. I think with some tweaking it'd be better, but as is, it's lacking something and not quite good enough to be something I make often. Maybe a higher O.J. to chicken stock ratio or using brown sugar instead of regular sugar or something. The tamarind pork marinade I tried had a more sweet and tart flavor that really stood out and tasted better than this one I thought.

I expected to love this recipe based on the reviews, but it didn't quite come together for me. The only thing I wonder about is the quality of my tamarind paste - that could have been it. I live in a small town so I'm not sure if the paste was good stuff. If you live in a big city where you can get the best quality, I wouldn't discourage you from trying it. The marinade and fresh orange were wonderful.

What a great recipe. I only had the chicken in the marinade for an hour when it was time to get dinner ready. I tasted the chicken before I added the glaze and the flavor was great with that alone. But, the glaze added another dimension. I read more reviews after I grilled and ate the chicken. Next time, I too will use less oil and butter. But thus gets my glowing review.

This is our new summer favorite. I made the recipe exactly as written, except that at the end of reducing the glaze, I added some hot pepper sauce (Tabasco), for a bit of zip. I forgot to add the butter at the end, and it was still delicious. Quoth my hubby, "this is awesome chicken!" I served it with baked potatoes and grilled asparagus - so yummy! I halved the recipe and it still took at least 30 mins. to reduce.

Excellent spin on barbequed chicken. Didn't feel like the 20 mile round trip to the ethnic grocery - researched tamarind subsititues and threw chopped, dried apricots, dates, lime juice and garlic into the simmering glaze (45 min to reduce).

Honestly, I didn't think that the glaze was anything special. I did sub honey for the sugar and maybe that's why it was too sour. Am likely to try again to see if the sugar makes the difference. I didn't experience any problems with my glaze reducing. Those who did might have been the ones that sub'd tamarind juice for the paste concentrate. Available at your local East Indian grocer. 1/2c. of olive oil for 7 chicken breast halves was excessive, and the fresh basil was unrecognizable. On a funny note; the one reason why I did enjoy this recipe was that the olive oil caused major flare ups on the grill, so all that smoke produced a deep intense flavor :) Go figure! Served with stir-fried sesame snap peas.

DELICIOUS! This is one of the best Bon Appetit recipes I've ever made. Very simple as well. I also used only 1/4 cup of olive oil in the marinade, and that was plenty. I also didn't add the last 3 tablespoons of butter to the glaze at the end, and I don't think the glaze missed it at all. In fact it likely would have been too buttery. It also took me much longer than 25 minutes for the glaze to reduce. It was more like an hour, but definitely worth the wait. I served with long grain brown rice, steamed broccoli and a Mirrasou chardonnay. I will definitely make this again.

Very nice. I cut the added half in fat by using just 1/4 olive oil and 3 tablespoons butter. I made up for the missing liquid by adding 1/2 cup orange juice to the marinade. This was enough marinade for 3 skinless bone-in breasts, it would probably be sufficient for 4. The reduction took over an hour, the resulting glaze is wonderful and worth the wait. I served it with rice, grilled pineapple and sesame snow peas.

This is a great glaze. It was almost sweet and sour. I didn't have fresh basil on hand so used dried instead. Need to cook the glaze in a bigger pot next time since our's boiled over three times!

Excellent, easy, quick. I will try using honey next time, a good suggestion, in fact I might try honey and a bit of molasses. I think molasses would mix really well with tamarind. As it was we only used 1/4 cup sugar because oranges are so sweet right now. Also want to try it with a pork tenderloin.

Enjoyed this dish. Found tamarind at our local Indian supply store. Sorry for stupidity, but didn't see where/when it said to add ingredients other than, 'whisk the next five ingredients'. Subst. honey (learned from someone here). Good recipe.

excellent. I used the sauce for cornish hens which I had first brined and they were excellent.

WOW!!! Everyone, quick, go to the store and get the stuff for this dish. It ROCKS!!! The best part about it, is that you can make a bunch of glaze ahead of time and use it at your disposal. I substituted honey for the sugar and added some garlic. Also, I served it with roasted red bell pepper. I can't stop giggling about how YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY YUMMMY it is!!!

Great recipe. Followed it exactly. Marinated chicken overnight. The marinade was great.

One of the most interesting chicken dishes I've tried in a long time, and my guests loved it. The tamarind-orange glaze was light and the tartness was just right. Next time I'll probably reduce the amount of olive oil in the marinade by about 20%--I don't think it will make a difference.

Yum! I used Knorr Tamarind soup base and it worked great, although the reduction took forever - plan on at least 45 minutes. Really good stuff!

Like others, I couldn't find tamarind paste either. I took Jumex Tamarind nectar and reduced it (to almost nothing) and then added the other ingredients. Ended up using cornstarch as a thickener but it really turned out lovely.

Great chicken recipe...tasty and different. I couldn't find tamarind paste for some reason, so I used tamarind chutney instead. Would like to try it again with the paste.

This is a very tasty dish! I wasn't able to find tamarind paste but used tamarind concentrate instead but only 1 1/2 teaspoons. Also, beware, it took alot longer than 25 minutes for the glaze to reduce! This is another 2 tongues up recipe!!
