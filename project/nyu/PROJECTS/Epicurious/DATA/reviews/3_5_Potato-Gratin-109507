I combined this recipe (too basic), with the Potato Gratin with Bacon and Thyme recipe (takes too long because of the extra 40 minutes for cooking the onions). In other words, I added bacon and thyme to this recipe. The result was delightful. Oh--and I used four layers of potatoes instead of three, because I cut them thinner than the recipe called for. The result was a very delicate gratin.

This was so good - made it twice, once for a party and once over the holidays with a prime rib roast and both times it was absolutely delicious and got rave reviews. Will definitely add to my arsenal of regular recipes.

This was a big hit with very discerning guests. I didn't have creme fraiche and added a little bit of gruyere and it was amazing. Very easy to execute and great for company.

A delicious and easy dish that's good for entertaining or an everyday meal. My family loves the dish with Gruyere, which adds a new dimension of flavor.

Loved this. Added some gruyere for cheese flavor, and it was a hit! Simple and very rich and crusty.

This is a fine weekday side dish, but nothing spectacular about it. There is a really good white cheddar potatoes au gratin on this site and you should definitely try instead!
