I loved this glaze so much! We used it for our Easter ham and everyone loved it. A nice light hint of honey and thyme rather than the heavy sticky tasting ones you buy from the store. I would love to try this on a roasted chicken or turkey in the future.

I would make this again in a heartbeat. So easy and just enough "sweet" to compliment the already sweet meat of the ham. Easy, but seems "gourmet". Made this for Easter dinner, using a 12 lb. bone in ham from our local butcher. All of the "pickys" in my family raved, and my husband, who loves ham in any fashion, even the worst ham ever, couldn't stop eating it, long after we got home from supper.

First ham I ever made that I actually liked. A nice subtle mix of a sweet and savory. Wrapping in parchment and tin foil kept the meet incredibly moist.

Actually had two hams for Easter; one with this glaze and a Spiral cut w/sweeter glaze. This Thyme Honey Glaze was the hands down winner. Everyone wanted extra servings of the Thyme glazed ham! Made it exactly as recipe, but did make it the day before to save time. Warmed it up a bit before glazing the ham and it was fine.

This is a very nice recipe. The glaze is not overpowering or cloying but compliments the flavor of the ham. I think the recipe is a little confusing and suggest a minor editing: Rewrite paragraph 4 and insert it as paragraph 2 -- "Boil vinegar in a small pan until reduced to about 1 T. Remove from heat and whisk in honey, Worcestershire and thyme butter. Let honey glaze stand while the ham bakes." I think that clears up the ambiguity concerning the time needed to bake the ham.

I made this ham for Easter and it was very good. I really enjoyed the glaze without processed sugar and honey goes so well with ham. The only change I made was I added some dijon mustard to the mix. It was a nice addition.

This was a great Easter surprise - my husband and I wanted to try something different and this was perfect. The thyme is a wonderful and unexpected pairing with the ham. We highly recommend it!

The Thyme Honey Glazed Ham took center stage at tonight's Easter dinner and left everyone demanding an encore! Loved the simplicity of the recipe and how the flavors intertwined perfectly together. Highly recommend to any cook who has a lot on the menu, with not enough time, and yet wants to make a lasting impression.

Every year I try a different glazed ham recipe for my Spring brunch. This is the best yet. I will not need to try another recipe ever again; this is the keeper.

I don't really like ham, but I loved this! So did everyone else.

This was a great ham recipe. I used a smaller ham and just shortened the cooking time.

Thought the glaze was perfect for what I was thinking for this easter dinner. Not too sweet, a little savory, just right. Too bad the actual ham I picked out was far saltier than this brand has ever been in the past.

Excellent sauce, though no need to cook the ham so long, just enough to heat through. I substituted fresh ground ginger for Worcestershire sauce. I also used a Dutch Oven to save foil & oven mess. Removed ham, and reduced the sauce.

This was wonderful - it really gave the ham depth and richness without overpowering it. I don't like overtly sweet glazes and this was quite subtle. Will definitely be making this again.

To the Gibsonia cook. You are very well read. You certainly know your stuff. You have no idea how much your hints mean to me. Thank you. If, my ham comes out okay, I too will rate it. But, if I didn't do well, I won't :) Kidding, I will rate it too. Hope your Easter is going well. Thanks Gibsonia.

Buffalo Cook - Happy Easter to you and you're welcome! They're also counting the 1 hr. the 12-14 lb. ham is sitting at room temp. before you put it in the oven. If you put a cold piece of meat in a hot oven or grill, the exterior of the meat can dry out before the inside is cook through (most ham's are already cooked but the priciple remains the same). Will actually rate this recipe post Easter!

To the Gibsonia, Pa cook. Thank you so much. In the recipe it stated that Total time was 4 hrs. That is why I wondered. Again, thank you and have a very Happy Easter.

To the Buffalo Cook - I'm going to make this for Easter too - you'll make the glaze while the ham cooks for 1 3/4. (In essence, the glaze will take you a few minutes to make but the idea is to let it rest while the ham cooks.) You don't want to cook the ham for another 1 3/4 hrs or it will be WAY overdone. Hope that helps!

Question: In the middle of the fourth para. it states "Let honey glaze stand until ham has baked 1 3/4 hours". Is this 1-3/4 hours MORE than the first 1-3/4 hours? Can I get an answer ASAP please.

We used this fabulous recipe and adjusted it for a pre-cooked spiral sliced honey ham that came 'preglazed' and was too salty. The wonderful thyme and honey basting glaze, which we used from the start of the cooking, drew off the extra salt and left a wonderful, rich and complex flavor profile. Total cooking time was 90 minutes at 325 for 8.5 pound ham, wrapped tightly until the last 15 minutes. At 75 minutes we opened the wrap, turned the ham over in it's wrap and finished baking to allow the glaze to shine. Took the advice of one revuer and added 1.5 tsp of powdered ginger to the glaze. Untold compliments!

Excellent...my ham yielded a lot of juices so I made a light gravy; thickened with a roux and diluted with a little chicken stock, cider vinegar and a little of the adobo sauce from canned chipotle to cut the sweet and add some pop...gravies and smoked hams usually don't go togther but this worked out great!

Solid ham, and good cooking method. I have to confess, I find it very difficult to compare hams because I never really find any glaze to penetrate enough to make any serious difference (even when I stab the ham to death). That sauce I could taste, was good.

Nicely balanced flavor. Not at all too sweet. Great glaze. Finished the last 45 minutes on the grill with 3/4 c orange juice in the pan. Delicious.

Very easy recipe to make, and really added a nice touch to the ham. I don't tend to like overly syrupy/sweet glazes, but thought this was absolutely spot on flavor wise. I too used a bone-in Smithfield ham, about 9 pounds, so cooking time had to be adjusted.

As a ham main dish goes, this is very good. I would certainly make this glaze again and prefer to the old style glaze with cloves. I used tangelos and they worked fine.

Fantastic recipe, everyone really enjoyed this ham and came back for second helpings and even took leftovers home with them. Added a bit more cooking time with bone in. This is certainly one of my new favourite recipes.

This glaze is exceptional! I was proud to serve the ham for Easter dinner to my guests, and I will definitely make it this way in the future (and spare the expense of a honey baked ham too!) I had a ham half the size called for, but I just turned the oven down to 300 degrees except for the final hour at 350. It was completely moist, even to the outside which had almost no fat. I poured some of the pan juices over the sliced ham on the serving plate. Delicious! One recipe correction: note that you CAN cut into the meat when doing the scoring (not only the fat), just like the picture shows....

This was great, but made even better with addition of 1.5 tsp dried ginger. Used on a Smithfield smoked ham. Everyone raved, even my mother-in-law. I usually use a brown sugar, maple, & mustard glaze, but wanted something different this Easter. Added to recipe box for future!

This was a very excellent recipe. We did use a bone in ham, if you go this route be sure to plan your time accordingly as it takes longer to come to temperature than the time stated in the recipe. Really, really good flavor, made a great Easter dinner.

The parchment paper/foil coving part of the recipe is a bit unclear....thoughts anyone?
