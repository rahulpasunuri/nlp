This has become a classic in my repertoire--perfect for a light supper, brunch buffet, or friends over for lunch. Always gets great reviews.

This is a wonderful summer salad. I have also made it with fresh green beans . It is almost as good, and quite a bit cheaper. A good alternative when you can't get asparagus

Have made many times for friends & family. Great party dish. Always asked for the recipe

Once somebody wrote "flavors were strong and overpowering for the delicate ingredients". I should have listend to this entry! The dressing is absolutely terrible, even if you like mayonnaise :(

I radically modified this pasta salad and the modification got "please give me the recipe" reviews at a potluck. (I'm sure the original is great too--the only reason that I changed it so much was that I had two salmon pasta salad recipes in front of me, so I kinda blended them!) So, here are the changes: 1) used light mayo and sour cream, 2)used fresh dill instead of tarragon, 3) used capers instead of poppy seeds, 4) used fresh English peas instead of asparagus, 5) used farfalle instead of penne. Most importantly, we used grilled wild salmon (leftovers!) instead of smoked. I'm telling you, try it.

This was good, but not great. Brought it to a potluck at work and wound up taking home leftovers (unusual). The dressing needs more zip. THe suggestion of adding capers is a good one...and maybe more lemon juice next time. A ring of tiny grape tomatoes around the top looked nice, too.

Fantastic. I used hot smoked salmon, flaked. Worked like a charm. I had some fromage blanc, which I substituted for the sour cream. Lastly, I reduced the mayonaise by 1/2, and added 1/2 to the sour cream (better balance). I doubled the recipe, but only multiplied the dressing by 1 1/2.

Made this for a light brunch - excellent. Variations: I used farfalle (bow tie) instead of penne which made for a beautiful dish. Instead of smoked salmon, I used a 7 oz piece of fresh salmon which I grilled (without seasoning or oil) for only 4 min. per side to keep it on the rare side. With the salmon still warm, I broke it into small slivers and tossed with a teaspoon of lemon juice and additional fresh tarragon and added about a 1/2 teaspoon of fresh dill (the warmth of the salmon helped infuse the bouquet of the herbs into the salmon.) I also added about a 1 1/2 tablespoons capers (after salad was fully assembled.) I decorated with leftover sprigs of tarragon and a lemon slice. A pretty dish with a light, fresh flavor - a huge hit at my brunch. Served with a beautiful herb salad in a red wine vinaigrette dressing. Lemonade was delish to wash it down with. Try the recipe and enjoy!

I made this recipe to serve as side dish to accompany an Easter brunch of sliced ham, a green salad, a potato salad and other goodies. It was very easy to make -- and was pretty delicious -- presentation looks great too. I'm curious to one day substitute the smoked salmon for grilled chicken -- that might work?

Delicious dressing. We substituted baby peas for the asparagas -- excellent choice! We repeated this recipe with smoked shrimp vs. salmon....also excellent!

This recipe was great--I made it with broiled salmon filet instead of smoked salmon, but all else was as written. It was a big hit with my book club. Even my husband liked it. I doubled it; if you do you don't have to double the dressing.

I make this every year when the asparagus comes in in the spring. We love it! I've substituted dried tarragon, use 1/3 as much, and it still works pretty well.

By far the best pasta salad I've ever made. I used Farfalle(bow tie) for the pasta and changed from tarragon to cilantro. It's actually great right after it's made and everything is super fresh as well as after sveral hours of the flavors blending. The cold water rinse cools it down a lot.

As an Alaskan I am always looking for salmon recipes and went searching for an alternative for my salmon pasta salad. I would combine this with my use of spinach fettucine, red onions and capers.

Have served this twice to 'rave' reviews...any herb will do...used tarragon then cilantro..

This was very nice. The asparagus and smoked salmon were a nice combination. It wasn't the best pasta salad I've ever had or made though. Anybody have any suggestions for other recipes on this site?

Great pasta salad. I used about 1/3 less dressing which was more than enough. Better the next day.

Flavors were strong and overpowering for the delicate ingredients: would try again with basics of asparagus, penne, and salmon, but add a warm olive oil viniagrette with some dill or rosemary. The principle was great, but the dressing was junior.

A fun recipe that can be made again and again using different herbs and pasta shapes. Try sweet basil and sesame seeds!

Absolutely delicious! I omitted the poppy seeds (didn't have any) but added 2 tsp of capers. It was wonderful and easy to make.

My friends loved this. Only change I would make is to use a little less dressing. And yes.... it's just as good the next day A Wanna Be Julia Childs from Battle Creek
