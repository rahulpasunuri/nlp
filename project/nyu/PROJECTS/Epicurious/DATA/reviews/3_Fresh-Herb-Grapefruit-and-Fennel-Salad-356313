We love this. You don't even need any oil. Typically I just use mint (fresh in the garden). Excellent for the summer when everyone is tired of green salads

Very nice, fresh & interesting salad. The citrus & herbs cut the licorice flavor of the fennel. It was a bit bland, so I added honey and black pepper. Also be careful not to overstir, or the grapefruit turns to mush.

This is great and gets better the next day. This is so much better than another green salad.

Served this as part of our Christmas dinner with friends. Made eight salad plates, beautiful presentation by the way, but an extra person showed up so I didn't have one. But the rave reviews from everyone around the table, including my husband (who would have been honest if everyone had been nice) was that the salad was delicious. I am making it again tonight for a different group of friends. This will be the test! But for now, I'm saying it's gr-r-eat.

I really loved it. Nice, light and fresh flavors. I love fennel and grapefruit though so maybe did not need a flavor punch of anything but that.

Looks good, taste bland. Nothing special. If you mix any white, green and red vegetables and add better dressing, you'll have the same effect, but better taste. Un-chopped parsley is harsh.

Maybe reserve some of the grapefruit juice and make a vinaigrette with balsamic vinegar and a drizzle of honey for more sweet if you like. Add a drop or two of sesame oil and canola or peanut oil to add a nuttiness. Yum!

pretty, but despite all the strong-flavored ingredients was actually very bland. Needs a better dressing to tie it all together.

This is a very pretty salad, but despite the strong-flavored ingredients was incredibly bland! Needs more of a dressing to tie it together.
