The directions for the brittle are too sketchy and you can easily ruin it. More detail is required. The pumpkin seed brittle recipe is much better. The recipe needs to give the exact temperature when the syrup is ready and also, if you don't brush the pan with a wet pastry brush the sugar will granulate. The brittle needs much better directions. The ice cream directions are OK, I thought there was too much juice in proportion to the cream, but that's a matter of taste.

I was a little bit skeptical of the flavor until I added the zest at the end. It's not like any orange ice cream I've ever tasted, it's very creamy and tart, so the sesame brittle balances it out really well. Be sure with the sesame brittle to smooth it out really well or you'll get large irregular chunks in it and the salt content will be thrown off. Once the brittle is hardened, cut it up into very small pieces to make the flavor and consistency more desirable. Make it for an end to a heavy, spicy meal.
