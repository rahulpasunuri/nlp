Ever since this recipe appeared in Gourmet years ago I've chosen this as the preferred lobster dip. Better 'n butter and less fatty.

nice recipe and easy to use, not only on lobster but any shellfish. also would be good if served over cellophane noodles.

We love lobster on the grill. Period. This was a great recipe.

I actually made drawn butter with this, as I thought I would miss it. (I'm originally from Boston.) It was perfect without the butter; you don't need it. I think this would also lend itself to a stir fry. Kill the lobsters first, parboil for 2 minutes, cut in serving pieces then cook in a covered wok.

I had to really push to do our Maine lobster this way. Ou New England vistors wanted to just boil and dip in butter. Well we followed this recipe, and used the dipping sauce as part of the grilling process - just once after we parboiled the lobster. I think the key was the grilling time - really 8-9 minutes - of course checking one to make sure there done. The right amout of moisture remained and the rest of the dipping sauce was used to taste. To a person everyone thought the lobster was thebest they ever had and left with the Epicurious recipe. We served this with fresh corn on the cob followed by a nice salad

I used this recipe to learn how to grill lobster. The flavor of grilled lobster will make you never want to eat it boiled again. I didn't make the dipping sauce (although I plan to).

Very easy and very tasty on the lobster, save your heart from all the butter. I plan to use the sauce on shrimp and lobster next. It was outstanding on the lobster and nice to par boil lobsters, I've avoided grilling recipes where you have to cut them up live.

Easy and full of flavor. Use it with any seafood although shrimp, scallops, lobster are the best. Try it with a gewurtztraminer and your guests will be very happy. It's a "flavor monster," as described.

used this on shrimp instead of lobster. Pretty damn good!

Skip the live lobster thing - for easy prep, no mess and less effort you can buy the frozen lobster tails. We like lobster so we do not tend to different sauces - just stick to the pure grill and dip in garlic butter - MMM. However, if you are looking for a tasty difference this sauce will definitely receiver rave reviews - enjoy!

This recipe is very tasty. The sauce is a flavor monster. Goes well on shrimp also.

My only change to this recipe was to reduce the amount fish sauce. The lime juice helps to balance it but not as much as I prefer. I reduced the fish sauce to 1-1/2 tablespoons. I liked this sauce so much I am using with fresh tuna steaks! Bon Appetit!

I made this with grilled steak and got rave reviews! I wasn't able to use fresh lobsters, so instead I purchased lobster tails - it still came out wonderful!

The concept behind this dish was great --grilling the lobster with a basting sauce -- but the flavors of the sauce overpowered the taste of the lobster. I would make it again, but only by changing the sauce ingredients dramatically.
