Excellent and speedy. The pesto is great, though it raised some eyebrows in the making what with the sage 'n' all. But, those same skeptics were putting it on tomatoes, bread slices, anything they could use to scoop it with just a couple hours later. The apples didn't do much, and the mayo isn't needed with the oil in the pesto making the sandwich rich and juicy enough. Will pound chix breasts all the time now, much better than slicing them to get the sandwichable thinness.

Wow, this was pure gustatory ecstasy! I live in an apartment so I cooked the chicken in a pan with olive oil. I can't imagine how amazing it must be of charcoal.

So delicious. Did some quick math (my accuracy could be off, but it was quick! what can I say) - nutritional info on this recipe: 2 TBSP of the pesto = 112.33 cal / 10.5g fat / 2.24g carb / 1.29g fiber / 1g protein Fuji Apple - 154 g apple 80 cal 22g carb 0.5g protein 5g fiber Chicken Breast - boneless and skinless, baked 3 oz 110 cal 1g fat 25g protein Trader Joe's Mini Ciabatta 1/4 loaf 130 cal 28g carb 4g protein 1g fiber Pesto Rationale: " 3/4 cup lightly packed fresh sage leaves (from 2 large bunches) = 12 TBSP = 72 cal 3.6 Fat 12 carb 12 fiber " 3/4 cup pine nuts = 510 cal 45g fat 12g carb 21g protein 3g fiber " 1/4 cup (packed) fresh Italian parsley leaves 5 calories 1g carbs 0.5 g fiber " 2 garlic clove = 9 cal 1.98g carb 4g protein " 3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons olive oil 12 TBSP = 1440 cal 162g fat " 6 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese 1oz = 660 cal 42g fat 54g protein 24 TBSP = 2696 cal / 252.6g fat / 53.86g carb / 31 fiber / 25g protein

This recipe is worth it for the sage pesto, apple, chicken combo. I didn't have pine nuts so I added some pecans and pumpkin seeds. Delicious!

A simply amazing sandwich -- so delicious. The juicy grilled chicken, fresh-sage pesto and thinly-sliced apple complement each other beautifully. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

this was simple and delicious. I really like the sage pesto. I used chicken thighs. I would make it again.

I'm just reviewing the sage pesto. I love making pesto, and had some leftover sage so I gave it a try. It has a surprisingly pesto-y flavor and the sage taste is there but not overpowering. I sub. raw salted pumpkin seeds for pine nuts, and 1 tsp hempseed oil + 1-2 tsp e.v. olive oil for the olive oil called for. It was delicious spread on my egg salad sandwich (with prociutto and romano), and I'm sure it'd be great with poultry, pasta, veggies, etc.

Very good, not excellent. The sage pesto is a little... weird. I made it on french bread baguettes which made the sandwiches big (slightly hard to eat). They were good, I would make them again, my friends liked it, it just wasn't 4 forks.

Great recipe! Made it for Father's Day and was a big hit. My first time making pesto from sage- a wonderfully smooth taste and just the right complement to the chicken and apples. I forgot to buy the parsley and it was still beautiful. Since the chicken is grilled relatively simply- this recipe is great for the pickiest of kids too- plain for them, dressed up for the grownups!

I looooove this recipe. Great summer food..so easy, and the combination of the flavors is incredible. The chicken must be grilled, though, I think...it adds a texture and smoky flavor that compliments the sage perfectly. We used granny smith apples and a nice gouda the last time--very versatile with the choices of cheese. Would even be good with pears.

I grow sage in the garden and didn't have much to use it for except a saltimbocca. This recipe is absolutely fabulous!!!!!!

Just like all the rave reviewers, this won high praise from teens and adults in my house. Used half the oil in the pesto and a rosemary sourdough bread. Warm chicken, cool sweet apples, savory sage pesto - what a great combination. With the pesto made ahead, it a cinch with almost no clean up.

Every Sunday I browse Epicurious for lunch ideas for the upcoming work week based on supermarket sales and what I have on hand. This was last week's find and is a keeper! Made the following adjustments: toasted the pine nuts and doubled the pesto, eyeballing the olive oil until I got the desired consistency, so I think I used less. Used wraps instead of ciabatta for ease of eating at work, and the sandwich was still tasty on Friday even though I made them all on Monday. The olive oil does tend to seep out in storage...grab a napkin before you set to. Husband gives the thumbs up, though I omitted the mayo on his, per request.

Hands down a winner for a quick, different meal from the grill. Will definitely make this again. The fuji apples or closely related variety are a must, they added a perfect texture and a mild flavor- stronger apples would overpower I think.

This was great! I ended up using sliced rotissere chicken breast due to time. Liked the pesto much more on the sandwich than tasted out of the bowl, and the apples really enhanced all of the flavors. Ended up with enough pesto to freeze for next time too!

FABULOUS! The only alterations I made were: I substituted brie for mayonnaise, then put the sandwiches on the pannini grill. I also added salt to the pesto. My husband liked the apple slices really thin but next time, I will make MY apple slices a bit thicker.

To my review on 9/14/05, I wanted to add that the amount of dried apples was approx 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup -- I did it to taste. The pesto was even better the next day. Great recipe!

I agree with previous reviews that this IS a great dish for a weeknight, when you need to prepare something quick and delicious. It's also kind of "comforting" -- the kind of food that just "hits the spot" when your day's been challenging. I prepared it a little differently than suggested: I cooked the chicken in a grill pan. Sinced I served it on smallish, toasted hard rolls brushed with butter, I sliced the chicken on a diagonal, then piled a layer of it over the bread, so that it would fit. Finally, though I bought fresh apples, after I tasted the pesto and thought it was a little sagey, I added torn dried apples, plus about 2-3 tablespoons additional cheese. It was excellent! Since the apple is dried, its flavor is more concentrated than probably would be the fresh, the oil softens it so it's easier to puree, and this method leaves fewer visible signs of apple, which can be detected by those finicky eaters. I'd like to try adding goat cheese to the sandwich or pesto the next time I make this. I think its taste would be just right. A great recipe for autumn!

This was pretty good. I agree with other reviewers in that the pesto itself definitely needed salt. I wasn't crazy about the taste of the pesto but I will say that once it was paired with the sandwhich, it went great. My husband wasn't that crazy about the apple slices on the sandwhich but I thought that it was a tasty touch. (I don't have a mandoline, but maybe had I sliced them thinner, he would've never noticed!) All in all a decent sandwhich that i'd make again. Easy for a weeknight!

This was light, delicious and great for outdoor summer dinner. Served with a cold tomato soup and sauvignon blanc. Perfecto.

Crunchiness of apples with fruity olive oil pesto complements the chicken. Sage adds a different dimension. I made one third the amount of pesto for two sandwiches and had beaucoup leftover. the pesto cries for salt.

This is very good in a "fancy sandwich shop" sort of way, and a great way to use up sage. You may want to add the olive oil a little at a time, this was too much for my taste.

This was an excellent sandwich, even for company. I made it with all apple-based foods for a fall get-together. It was definitely delicious. Made it again a week later for family dinner. Great with an apple pumpkin soup!

I almost never give four forks, but this one's worthy. If you're getting tired of the same old sandwiches for those packed lunches, this is a welcome change. Use good crisp apples; I like a variety called Honeycrisp.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe! Surprisingly, my husband enjoyed the apples in the sandwich as much as I did. What a flavorful combination! I seasoned the chicken with cracked lemon-pepper and used a rosemary and olive oil ciabatta loaf, both of which I grilled on a cast-iron grill pan. I imagine some brie can also be added even though the recipe is perfect as is!
