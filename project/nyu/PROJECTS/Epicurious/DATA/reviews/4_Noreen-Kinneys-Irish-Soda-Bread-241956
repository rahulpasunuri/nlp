OMG this was sooo good and easy to make! And the sunflowers really did turn green! Made this to take to a St Paddys party and everyone raved over it. It makes a good size loaf so you will have extra for breakfast :) Prepared exactly as the recipe states but I can see where there is plenty of room for changes - maybe honey??

This is pretty good. I like the earthy flavor but it is improved with a little sweet or garlic and herb butter. I ended up not having wheat germ like I thought I did and doubled the wheat bran instead. I'm going to freeze half of the bread and take it out for St. Paddy's Day next weekend.

Delicious, appealingly refreshing, with or without the addition of vodka or gin. Best made no more than 2 hours in advance, as the vibrant color begin to go a little dark and becomes less appealing.

I have made this many times. it is delicious. It makes great toast and it freezes well. Awesome!

Forgot to mention that both of the loaves I tried cooked in 30-33min.

I made this twice in the last 24 hours. First time used white/multigrain flour combination and it spread out a bit on baking sheet, more like batter, but the finished bread had good texture, moist with nice golden crisp crust and good flavor. The second time I used all spelt flour and subbed almond milk for the butter milk adding a tsp or two of vinegar. it seemed like a more typical soda bread dough, easier to work with. I baked it in a parchment lined springform pan which worked perfectly. The bread turned out great, nice and moist (as opposed to the usual dry, choky texture of most irish soda breads) and really nice flavor. I do think raisins add alot to this bread. I personally wouldn't make it without raisins. The best soda bread recipe I have come across for sure.

I just made this, and my husband is tearing his way through it. I used double the wheat bran (on accident), pumpkin seeds, curdled milk in place of buttermilk, and some mashed banana in place of the egg. Because we live at altitude (5000 feet) I upped the liquids some, reduced the flours and leavening slightly, and baked it for 30 minutes at 450. The result is a tender, light, nutty loaf with a bare hint of banana. Delicious. Oh, to save a mess I turned the batter directly out onto a sheet of parchment, that I slid onto a baking stone for a crispy crust.

My boyfriend loved this mostly due to the rustic look and texture. I didn't care for it mostly due to the after taste from the soda. It was certainly easy to make!

Ok, everyone and his brother must have their own "Irish Soda Bread" recipe, I had mine. However, I found out that what I was making was "spotted dick"...SOOOO, I tried this one and LOVED it. I found it easy, all you have to do is remember to keep adding flour until it's workable and there you go! I have ALWAYS baked my bread in a round baking bowl, but it broke, so I used a bunt pan...it worked out just great. I wasn't into all the nuts, so I used lots of flax seed. I also used rolled oats, oat brand, flax meal, and, as a nod to my southern roots, some corn meal. I used skim canned milk with about 1/4 cup oatmeal stout mixed in instead of the buttermilk and it worked beautifully! ( I LOVE to experiment!) I made a double batch to give some to my son and family and it was gone in a flash! My didn't last too much longer. This is a real keeper, and very versatile too...

I followed the instructions exactly and took my loaf out of the oven at about 35 minutes. I think it came out kind of dry. It's very tasty but not moist enough. I'm newly living at altitude, though, and I'm not very familiar with how to adjust my baking for this difference. If anyone else knows how to adjust this recipe for altitude, I'd appreciate the tips & would love to try making it again!

GREAT bread, have made multiple times....Ran out of sunflower seeds last night and used chopped pecans....tasted even better. (do not sprinkle pecans on top...they tend to burn faster than sun flower seeds) used oatmeal...not oatbran. Try it toasted with butter. Divine.

Well, I totally did a dumbass thing and used BAKING POWDER instead of BAKING SODA. (Hello! It says SODA bread, duh!) Still turned out ok. The bread was tangy, and very moist, if quite dense. Maybe if I use the correct leavening agent next time, it'll be even better. :)

LOVE this recipe. Hearty but soft. They taste kind of buttery even though there's not that much better in there. Overall really good. I will definitely make this again and have already sent the recipe to lots of people! I decided to make them drop scone/biscuit style instead of one big soda bread - I think it made about 16-18? I baked them for 15-17 minutes.

I really love this soda bread, though I don't expect it to be authentic. I just like its nutty flavor, that it's power packed with good stuff and tastes delicious. I served with soup, but also the next day as toast with jam and the next day with brie and berries! Great idea about baking in the round pan MiamiTeacher! What size do you use?

I went to Ireland last summer and fell in love with the soda bread that was served with nearly every meal. I got the recipe from one of the owners of a B&B where we stayed, but everything was in metric, so...Anyway, this recipe was the closest to the one I was given in Ireland, so I tried it. It is delicious. It may not be exactly what some people had in Ireland, but I found that soda breads did differ slightly from cook to cook and region to region. That said, this is very authentic from my experience. As for the problems with it spreading--I bake mine in round cake pans instead of on baking sheets. That's how I was instructed in the recipe I got in Ireland. The bread rises rather than spreads and the shape is very authentic. This has become a family favorite. I make it all the time.

Tasted nothing like Irish Soda bread as I know it. A huge disappointment.

This bread is delicious and beautiful. I used honey instead of granulated sugar and it turned out great!

The dough was EXTREMELY wet, which I thought it would be when I saw the ratio of liquid to solid. I should have added more flour, but I like to follow a recipe to the letter the first time out. Tastes good-quite rustic.

A great healthy quick bread! Dense but perfect with soup on a cold day. My dough was very very wet after adding the buttermilk and I had to add extra flour because it was sticking to the board and my hands. Will make this again for sure!

Really fantastic. I have made this over and over again. I use Bob's Red Mill Extra Thick Rolled Oats instead of oat bran and I have made with both full fat and lowfat buttermilk. I also reduce sugar to 1 tablespoon. This is a keeper. Wonderful toasted and freezes very well.

I don't think I developed the gluten enough - my loaves (I made 2: one according to the recipe and one with chopped dates and cinnamon) spread out rather than up and were a little drop-biscuity. But despite structural issues, they were delicious! Just what I was looking for.

I got a lot of raves on this bread...even my brother's girlfriend that is a cook at Whole Foods wants the recipe. I will definately make this again.

Only substitutions was soy nuts for sunflower seeds and added the grated peel from one large orange. I mixed in the butter w/food processor, then added the rest of dry ingredients and gave a few pulses to mix. Next time I'd try brown sugar to add some depth. Bread great w/raspberry jam!

I just want to add that, if you cut the amount of dry ingredients by about half, this recipe makes dynamite pancakes, too! (Don't reduce the baking soda, though.)

Oh. My. God. I wish I could give this recipe five or six stars! It is the whole-grainiest-flavored whole-grain bread I have EVER tasted. Fabulous. As usual, I had to chop & channel. I had to substitute pecans for sunflower seeds, oatmeal for oat bran, and some extra whole wheat flour for wheat bran. (Also, xylitol for sugar.) Everything else as written. I am very tempted to make this our standard house bread, except I'm not *quite* sure it's firm enough for sandwiches.

Yes! Sunflower seeds do turn green, and the flour turns yellow!!! I was scared that my flour had gone bad, but I had just purchased it; therefore it had to have been a reaction of the baking soda. Thank you! for writting this article, it saved me from discarding 25 Lbs. of flour, since I was under the impression that it had gone bad. One last comment, Irish Soda bread is very easy to make; it's like a blank pallet you could add anything you like to embelish and enhance it's flavor.

I needed a yeastless bread recipe. Looking at all the ingredients, I thought this would be thick as a brick, but it turned out surprisingly light. Reminiscent of cornbread. The transfer from work surface to baking sheet was tricky, though.

Rating: 4
Just like the breads we had in Ireland except the breads there didn't have sunflower seeds. Very hearty, works well with stews, beans, and just by itself with some Irish butter. I've made numbers times since St. Patrick's Day and have given manyt the recipe. Not the typical "Americanized" Irish soda bread...but a more traditional Irish recipe.

Definitely a little messy, but simple for a first-time maker... it tasted just like I remember from my favorite Irish pub, though!

I didn't have either of the suggested seeds so I used pumpkin and poppy seeds. Only problem was that my husband and I liked it so much we ate half the loaf!

My family raved about this bread & wants to toast it for breakfast and use with sandwiches. I bought the various brans/wheat germ from the bulk dept at the grocery & only had to buy the small amounts I needed for the recipe. Definitely a keeper. Did cook faster than 40 min (mine was done in 35 min.) I also baked it on a stone which helped the bottom crisp nicely.

Maybe it was just my substitutions, but this came out burnt (in 33 minutes at the recommended temp). The ingredients are difficult to find, and the dough is hard to manipulate.

I've eaten soda bread for more than fifty years in Ireland and here. This one may be bread, but it's not Irish Soda Bread. It should be renamed Kinney's Soda Bread. Sunflower seeds??? I don't think so!
