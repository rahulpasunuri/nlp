This was incredibly good! I had fresh plums and frozen raspberries and it was wonderful! Very easy and the whole family raved!

This was a wonderful summer treat. I made it for a garden luncheon. Everyone loved it, but had no idea what it was (a cold bread pudding). I served it with a mascarpone cream cheese/whipped cream which was decadent,but delicious. I plan to make this again this week for another luncheon group.
