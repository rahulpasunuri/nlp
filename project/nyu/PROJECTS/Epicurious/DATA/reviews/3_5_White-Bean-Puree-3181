This is a good high-protein side dish. I added garlic after the other veggies had cooked for about 5 mins and it deepened the flavor, also, a splash or sherry at the very end. Yeah, it doesn't stand on its own but it's nice with any kind of meat that has juices, especially if you want an alternative to potatoes.

One might look at these ingredients and ask, "What could go wrong?" Indeed, preparing this puree creates fine smells in the kitchen. The flavor, however, leaves much to be desired. I tried lemon, olive oil, and paprika. When all else failed, I browned the mixture in a pan, and received still lackluster results. This would be adequate in place of rice, etc., to absorb sauce beneath a protein course. Sadly, it has little merit on its own.

This makes an AWESOME bean dip with pita chips!!! Warm or room temp.

This is good but much better if you cook the beans from scratch. I use my own homemade chicken stock, water, bay leaves and thyme and when they are done I fork mash them for texture. It really is worth the effort.

The combination of flavors makes this a really memorable side- would make this again

This is simply wonderful; it turned out great the first time and every time. My husband and kids loved it! Shared it with my girlfriends and they made it and loved it too! A great alternative to potatoes or pasta for sure. Great with fish or meat - YUM YUM!

This dish went well with lamb and I will make it again and again. All my guests enjoyed it and it was so easy to prepare. It was great having a side dish you could do in advance and then reheat.
