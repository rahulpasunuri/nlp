Wonderful flavor. I've made this twice. Second time was best. Took care to roll as thin as possible and baked until crispy and darker brown in spots. Also, added a bit more chili powder than called for, (perhaps my chili powder is getting to the end of its shelf-life).

Delicious! I substituted Spanish hot smoked paprika for the chili powder, and served with baked goat camembert.

This was fabulous and easy to make. I served it as a snack while Thanksgiving dinner was in the oven with a nice camembert.

I just found this recipe about 3 months ago in an old 1998 mag. and I can´t believe that its still on the web site. I´ve now made it three times it is so great, this time I´m taking it as one of the appitizers to my Margarita group that meets once a month and I can just give them your web site as I´m sure they will want the recipe.

This was the focal peice of my Thanksgiving hors d'oeuvres, served with spicy pumpkin dip. They are so good! Everyone scarfed them up. I would skip the egg wash though. It didn't add anything and it made the dough much more difficult to work with. This would be a fun recipe to play with by adding different seeds or nuts and different herbs or spices. The best thing was that I made them Tuesday evening - 2 days in advance - and they were still delicious!

Served this along with other appetizers as we football games and prepared Thanksgiving dinner. Everybody thought it was a tasty and appropriate Thanksgiving food. People were impressed that I had gone the extra mile to serve a homemade flatbread instead of boxed crackers.

This is a terrific, unusual recipe to serve at a party as an appetizer with caemembert or pate. I serve it every Thanksgiving while guests are arriving. Roll the dough thin before adding the shopped pumpkinseeds and the flatbread will be nice and crisp.

I had the pleasure of tasting this at the Philly cook's nuevo-Spanish meal and brought the recipe home with me. I've made it several times, most recently for a Chilean wine tasting party where it was a huge hit! I will certainly be making it again.

We served this as part of a nuevo spanish meal - I thought there would be lots of leftovers - but they disappeared in a flash and everyone was asking for the recipe! - I used spanish sweet (smoked) paprika - and will be making them again by request!

Tasty and mild. Roll them out as thin as possible to ensure they are crisp.
