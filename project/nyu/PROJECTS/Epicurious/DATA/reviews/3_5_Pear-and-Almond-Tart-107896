I used pre-made pastry dough from a restaurant supplier as I was in a hurry. If I'd made the crust, it would have been a pate sucre. Added Trader Joe's Toasted Sliced Almonds sprinkled on top before baking as we like a crunchy dessert. Pears were from Harry & David since they have the best. This recipe was very good, and I would not change anything else. Also would be good with apples.

Made this fantastic and easy dessert for a party. The dough was easy to prepare using a food processor. I incorporated some of the suggestions in previous reviews and was very pleased with the result. Lined the crust with Ghiradelli 60% cacao chips. In the almond paste mixture, I used 1 tbls. less of (store bought) almond paste and added 2 tbl. of creme fraiche. I topped the filling with 2 layers of anjou pears. The last 10 min. of baking, I topped the tart with 9 raspberries, which added another taste dimension and color to a wonderful dessert.

Nice! Lovely to look at and delicious. Made as recipe indicated with the addition of a thin layer of semisweet chocolate between the crust and almond filling. Good dessert when entertaining. I'll make it again for Thanksgiving with apples...and add a little cinnamon and nutmeg maybe.

I've made this twice--once as written, and once using apples instead of pears and a homemade "walnut paste" instead of the almond. The walnut version, IMO, was much better, probably because it didn't taste so definitely like marzipan. The nut flavor is pretty dominant, however, so if you are looking for a fruit tart, this will not be satisfying.

Ok, by now, I have made this recipe about 4 times, each time with improvements. Add 1/4 of sour cream, dark chocolate, and do two layers of pears.

Made this for christmas yesterday and it went well. I used pear juice instead of apple cidar in the crust, 2 tbsp of creme fraiche in the filling, also added chocolate chunks (dark belgian) between the crust and the filling, brushed the pears with butter and dusted with white sugar. It was good but I found the crust to be a little too salty. Thought I may have used salted butter but rechecked the pack and it said neither unsalted or salted. Either way, next time I will use less salt in the crust. All in all, it was lovely.

Awesome! Not too much almond taste. Weighed the almond paste. Don't know if this was an issue with those that complained re the almond taste. Very mellow. Be sure to ripen the pears as suggested by the recipe. Struggled with placing them in the tart after cutting. Manual dexterity issue.

The true French version of this uses 2 tablespoons of creme fraiche in the filling. This makes the filling a little more custard-like, the texture lighter and the almond less overbearing. Dotting with a few raspberries in the last 10 minutes of cooking adds color and diversity.

After reading reviews I substituted and added to recipe: brown sugar instead of white sugar, 1/2 teas. alm extract, 1/2 teas. rum extract, dash of nutmeg, dash of salt to wet mixture, thinly sliced pears to be able to create more layers, blanched pears in water, van extract, orange zest for a few minutes. Before baking, basted pears w/melted butter and lightly dusted w/white sugar. Baked until filling bubbled around pears and turned a nice golden brown. Had a lot more flavor and balance.

This dish looked beautiful, and all my guests liked it. However, I found the almond overpowered the lovely expensive pears I bought. If you like marzipan, you'll love this because that is all it tastes like!

I found this tart to be too bland even though I used perfectly ripe, lovely, organically-grown pears. It even looks bland: the crust, filling, and peeled pears are all the same color--beige. For all the labor this recipe requires, I'm sure a better recipe could be found.

Made this for a dinner party. Because one of the dinner guests adores coconut, I added a rim of unsweetened coconut around the edge of the pears (although it wasn't necessary tastewise). I served it with a rum flavoured Creme Anglaise and the whole thing was gorgeous. I didn't have the right kind of flan tin, so I used my 11" springform pan, worked just fine.

Fantastic flavor and texture. This tart both looked and tasted great. I used a 9" tart pan and the larger one would have been better - the crust was a bit too thick (still good, though). Will definitely make again - great with a dessert wine, too!

Okay, I used apples because I had some to get rid of. I thought this tart was delicious and will make it again (maybe even with pears). It looked like I bought it from a bakery, too. My only problem was with the crust--it stuck to my pan and was pretty difficult to extract. I don't know if it was because I waited till it was cool or maybe I need to grease it next time (I never have had to grease it before, and I have made many tarts). So be aware of that.

This was a huge hit with my husband and two guests. I made it with home-made almond paste (not store-bought), following the almond paste recipe from the new Joy of Cooking. The only thing I changed in hte JOC almond paste was that I toasted the almonds for 10 minutes at 375 and reduced the amount of almond extract by half (I think almond extract can get to be a bit much). Then I followed the recipe here as directed. I will also try this with apples...probably also good with apricots.

oh, my god was this good! really easy, really pretty, and really delicious! i made it twice over the weekend, once for passover (substituted white flour for sifted matzoh meal), and once for a dinner party (i had leftover dough from the first time i made it, because i had prepared the dough ahead of time with white flour). both times were a comlete success! my favorite flavors, will make this again and again.

We liked this tart very much.The crust dough is a dream to work with. I did make a sub. though. Apple cider only available in gallon, so I used amaretto instead. Worked out fine but next time I might try pear juice and see how that would be. I think the baking time could have been extended a bit. The filling was like a very thick cream (not a bad thing). Also I couldn't fit all 8 pear halves, so I used 7. Be aware...this tart has a very pronounced almond flavor. Good thing I love almond!
