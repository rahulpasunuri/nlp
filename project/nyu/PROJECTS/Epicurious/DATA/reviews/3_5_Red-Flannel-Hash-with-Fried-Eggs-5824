I love this dish and have made it several times before. I've made some modifications though: I had an extra filet mignon left over from last night, so I cut that up and added that in with the onions, and I also cut up some carrots and added that in with the potatoes and beets. Plus, I used light cream instead of milk. I also used 2 eggs per person. Real comfort food on a chilly night. We like to eat it with ketchup on top too, sounds awful, but it sure is good!

I *love* this dish! Who could believe that a can of beets could make my heart go pitter-patter?! This hash is so comforting and satisfying. I like it with 2 eggs. The recipe, though, does not fall into the "30-min main course" category for me. It seems to take me a long time to make, and dirties a lot of pans too. But, oh so worth it!!
