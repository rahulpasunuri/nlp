We loved this soup. The egg and cheese give it a special twist. I also changed some things. I also sauted my vegetables first and used a store bought rotisserie chicken that I shredded and added to the soup. I tempered the eggs and cheese with a little soup broth and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice before adding it to the soup. It reminded me of a soup my little Italian Grandmother used to make years ago. Loved it.

A very different twist to chicken soup that I found to be very delicious. I added corn to the recipe towards the end to add a little variety in vegetation. Anyone who chooses this recipe will be satisfied.

I took the advice from the comments here and used 8 cups broth instead, and I diced the onions, celery and carrots and sauteed them first and then left them in. I, also, added rice vinegar for a little flavor. Plus, depending on yout brand of chicken broth, you may need to add quite a bit of salt. But it ended up super-yummy!! And the left-overs wer great!

I used homemade chicken stock and frozen chicken breasts, and I couldn't find Cream of Wheat, so I used polenta instead for this soup. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. My husband thought it was delicious. I thought it was very good. The polenta didn't really thicken the soup, it just kind of floated around. I think those who found it bland may have started with less than great stock...

this is essentially Straticella, a classic italian soup, however, the classic does not add farina.It is a clear soup w/eggs and parmasan. I have alway loved it!

Considering how simple this was to make, I think it's a keeper. Very kid friendly, without being uninteresting for adults! We did not find it lacking in flavor, but the next time, I will decrease the chicken broth, probably to 8 cups, so it will be thicker and more hearty. Though it seems like a simple egg drop soup, the cheese added a nice complexity.

A great variation on traditional chicken noodle number. The farina (i added extra) gave it a hearty, filling texture and egg gave off hints of chinese hot & sour soup. An excellent dish for the colder months. I'm making one tonight!!!

I found this soup to be light, as an egg-drop soup would be. Next time I will leave celery and onions in to add more flavor as several others did.

We did not care for this soup. It is very light, however, the texture was not enjoyable and the flavor bland. I would not make this again.

My husband really liked this soup, but I found it to be a little bland. The egg strands and cheese made the leftovers texture a little gross. I wont make this recipe again, but if I did, I would add lemon juice or vinegar.

My husband said this is the best chicken soup he has ever tasted. It went together easily. We like dark meat, so I used two whole chicken legs (without skin). I also returned both the carrots and the onions back to the broth for serving. I served it over some leftover noodles and it was excellent.

The soup is incredible. I also used corn meal because it is easy to find. I recommend chopping up the vegetables and cooking them in a little olive oil for a few minutes and leaving them in the soup.

This recipe was easy to do and my family loved it. Perfect for a quiet and relax winter lunch.

My husband loved this soup! He thought it was incredible! I took a couple of short cuts and it still was very tasty! I didn't have any celery, used chicken cutlets, and I used chicken bouillon instead of canned broth. I probably won't make it again just because the eggs in it are similar to egg drop soup, which I'm not a big fan of, but I wholeheartedly recommend it to others who won't mind the egg. It is also really easy to make.

This is an excellent soup! Hearty, yet elegant. The egg threads are what makes the soup extra-special. I sliced the carrots and chopped the celery and onions before cooking and left them in the soup. I used a large red onion and added extra celery. I used yellow corn meal rather than farina for thickening. I added a couple of tablespoonsful of rice wine vinegar the last five minutes of cooking for extra flavor and served the soup with a crusty bread.

Delicious, light and wonderful with hot crusty bread. Using chicken breasts with in the bone is key because chicken cutlets will overcook.

Everyone enjoyed this soup. I used Healthy Valley chicken broth which I think probably added some flavor, and lots of fresh reggiano parmesian. It was getting late in the day so I used boneless chicken, and feel the meat was a bit dry.I would use chicken with the bone in next time. Also, the only way I could slice the cooked onions was with my kitchen scissors. I served the soup over fresh rigatoni pasta with some crusty french bread. My skiers loved it.
