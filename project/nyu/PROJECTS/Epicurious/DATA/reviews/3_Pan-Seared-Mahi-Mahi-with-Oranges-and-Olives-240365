Made recipe exactly as printed and thought it was very bland. There are too many other good Mahi Mahi recipes out there to waste time with this one.

This was a good recipe and I will make again. I tweaked it a little based on others suggestions and I used kalamata olives and only one orange. I didn't finish in the oven, I simply cooked in the skillet a little extra tine. A good array of flavors.

Loved this recipe enough that I registered just to review it. Orange/Olive has just become one of my new favorite flavor combinations. - Did not marinade. - Used mandarin oranges instead of regular oranges. Had haricot vert, baby peas, and lentils on the side.

relatively simple preparation for great flavors. Didn't have olives on-hand and substituted zest and juice of a medium tangerine and a medium lemon

I was SO disappointed with the finished product. Since mahi mahi is a meaty fish, the thin sauce did little to dress it and just pooled on the plate spoiling the other food that it leaked in to. The chunks of orange added a bitter taste. This one is a no go.

Spoiler alert for purists! I come to Epicurious to find recipes that will use up what is in the fridge. I needed to use the mahi mahi or lose it, but didn't have oranges or green olives. So I added kalamatas and some very ripe peaches that I needed to also use. This was incredibly tasty and very quick and easy.

borrrinnnggg. this one was too much prep for so little flavor. 2tsp of orange peel added a bitter element the delicate fish didn't need.

I found this recipe easy to prepare, but lacking in flavor. The orange did not infuse the fish enough. Looks better than it tastes.

this is excellent - I omitted olives and forgot chives and basil. It didn't need any of this - a wonderful dish. Served with brown rice with almonds.

I had high expectations and was really disappointed. Look for something else.

I substituted the Mahi Mahi with domestic Halibut for environmental reasons and it worked well. I also used Kalamata olives instead of green which I think worked better for taste and color presentation. I think the key to making sure it is not too sweet is to use fresh squeezed oranges for the juice, not store bought.

This was literally one of the worst things I have eaten. I made the recipe exactly as written, and it was inedible.

Great combination of flavors and very easy to make. I used Trader Joes frozen mahi mahi, thawed it in advance and it cooked up just perfectly. I'll be making this one again.
