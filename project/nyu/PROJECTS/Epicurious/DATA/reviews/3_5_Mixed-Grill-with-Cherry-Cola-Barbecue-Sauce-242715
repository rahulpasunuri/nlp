We just didn't like the taste of the sauce.

Great. Makes me proud to be a chick who can make ribs with the best of them

I am a HUGE fan of marinades & rubs and what really elevates this common mixture is the use of smoked paprika. I was short on the smoked variety so I supplemented with regular which was fine because the smokiness still came through. I always like to counter with a sweet note in my rubs so I added 1 scant T. of brown sugar to the mix. I blend all of my rubs in a coffee grinder so the larger pieces of herbs break down and incorporate more thoroughly. This recipe was right on about not adding salt because salt will draw out the moisture in the meat. Apply liberally just prior to grilling. Used on pork tenderloin with an Espresso BBQ sauce. At some time would like to try the cherry cola sauce but I don't normally stock soda.

This was AMAZING!!! Got many compliments on this recipe and think the rub is excellent on it's own!

The BBQ sauce is really good. Our sausages were too dry. We basted the chicken with the sauce after it was grilled. The ribs were good but more crispy than fall off the bone juicy/tender.

Fabulous with the cherry cola barbecue sauce. We could have done with just the ribs and chicken.

The baby back ribs were outstanding with the sauce, the chicken with just the dry rub was pretty good. If I make again I will baste the chicken with the sauce for the last few minutes on the grill...
