Tasty and simple, a great side to any white fish. Could be bland as the star of a meal, but an excellent complement.

I found this bland, so I added a bit of low sodium soy and fresh cilantro to give it a bit of flavor. Nice.

It IS a very simple and satisfying dish. Not every dish wants to be brimming with complex flavors. This one brings balance to a meal composed of several other highly flavored dishes for an Asian feast.

This is a recipe my mom taught me when I was little minus the sesame oil and sesame seeds. We stir-fry almost all veggies this way, but instead of a wok, we just use a regular skillet (you really don't need a wok), and we just flavor the veggies with a bit of salt at the end. Instead of salt, you can also use some vegetable or meat bouillon powder, or add a drizzle of oyster sauce. My uncle says that he blanches the vegetables in boiling hot water for about a minute before stir frying veggies in very hot oil. Apparently, this is how restaurants make stir fried veggies, but I always found this method a bit too time consuming unless you are doing potatoes.

This was nice - I added an extra tablespoon of oil, but it ended up being too oily in the end. Cooked on Hi to start and then lowered to 8 to cook the veg. Added two table spoons of soy sauce which I think gave added flavor.

I loved this recipe -- the sesame seeds and sesame oil add great flavor.

Described as "staggeringly simple," we found it stultifyingly boring. Unless you're looking for a bland side to a blockbuster asian main, don't bother.

A great alternative to the same old vegetables. Served this with Sake Sea Bass in Parchment from same Gourmet issue - wonderful and easy to make.

Loved it. Was getting bored with standard veg options - really liked this. Used baby bok choy w/the cabbage. Halved all oils to reduce calories. Sesame oil at end was great....used little more than 1/4 tea so as no to overpower.
