I served these with homemade tomato soup. It was delicious. They would make a great appetizers too. Easy to make and can be done ahead.

This was great, so simple I never would have though of it myself. I got rid of the sugar and the butter though (who needs BUTTER with piles of blue cheese??) and brushed the bread with a little garlic infused olive oil before piling on the cheese and broiling.

Have made this numerous times over the years and love it as do all my guest. Just decided to rate it as I was going through my recipes to plan holiday parties. Make sure not to over sugar, sprinkle very lightly

These were ALMOST extraordinary...something about the sugar threw me. The flavors just don't seem to compliment each other. Probably will not make these again.

First-timer with blue cheese and found this toast recipe easy and delicious to make!! Great winter brekkie.

Loved this easy receipe and I've made it many times now. I got daring and added something crazy before putting the toast in the oven. I had some apricot-pineapple preserves and just put a 'dollop' on each for a sweet flavor to compliment the cheese. It was a big hit even with those not fond of blue cheese.

I am back to say that I can't stop making this. Alter bleu cheese and salty-ness as you wish, with more butter or fresh cream cheese, but note, this stuff can still look pukey green. Cover it up. Hide it. Lie. Other toppings and such are wonderful, but you just need to chop a fresh green herb on top. This is an exceptional recipe, easy and delish! DO IT!

So simple, so quick, and so tasty! I served the toasts on a platter with a dish of caramelized onions in the middle. Guests spooned the onions onto their toasts and then swooned.

This is soooo delicious! I often use these yummy little toasts to much on while other dishes are cooking. Everyone should try these, even if blue cheese isn't your favorite.

This is great and easy. I added scallions and garlic the second time and even topped some with sliced cherry tomatoes....very good. This is a definite keeper.

Loved this recipe! Very easy. I did two batches, one as written and the second with chopped up dried cranberries and chopped walnuts. Served it on a platter with fresh strawberries. They were all quickly devoured.

I made this for a dinner party and it was unbelievable. They were all gone. I garnished it with cherry tomato halves and parsley and it looked fabulous.

Yum! I added a handful of dried cranberries and some chopped pecans, which I realize makes it a slightly different recipe, but it was terrific!

These were okay. If I were to make them again I would use less butter. The recipe seemed very greasy. While these were easy to whip up, once they started cooling off they congealed and lost their "charm".

I love blue cheese, so these blue cheese toasts were a delicious treat for me. They team up perfectly with the bibb lettuce, alvocado, & cranberry salad or with many other salads.

Easy, easy, yummy, yummy. Fantastic with the Bibb Lettuce, Avocado, Cranberry Salad!

I would definetely use "unsalted" butter next time. It was a little salty with regular butter.

These were very tasty alongside the salad mentioned. The salad was nice as it used a nice combination of ingredients. Quick and Easy too!!!

This recipe has been a big hit twice in the last week alone at parties. It's a fairly light appetizer if you slice the bread thin. I added crushed walnut sprinkled on top. Delicious!
