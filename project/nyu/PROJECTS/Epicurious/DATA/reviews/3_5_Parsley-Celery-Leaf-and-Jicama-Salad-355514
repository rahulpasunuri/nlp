I mistakenly bought cilantro instead of the parsley. I and my guests loved it. I didn't have radish sprouts but that sounds like a tasty addition.

1 1/2 tablespoons of sugar to 3 tablespoons of oil? This has GOT to be a mistake. I think all the proportions are just wrong on the dressing. That's way too much acid/oil ratio, which is probably why they put so much sugar in it. Just cut back on the acid and leave out the sugar and this is a great salad.

This is nice and refreshing, perfect alongside heavy dishes; planning to add it to an upcoming party menu that includes mac and cheese and salmon. Didn't add the sugar to the dressing, and, in fact, the jicama was sweet to the point that a full tablespoon plus of sugar in the dressing seems unnecessary. Had arugula on hand, and it was spicy enough in place of the radish sprouts. Don't skip the celery leaves - they add a pretty light green and delicate flavor. Next time, will break up the parsley leaves (de-stem each one) or chop them.
