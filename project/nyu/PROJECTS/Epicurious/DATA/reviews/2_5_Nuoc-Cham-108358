Sorry, folks. Someone left out 2 staples of Vietnamese cuisine - garlic and chilis/chili paste. This was nowhere near authentic.

I have been looking for this recipe for a long time. I made Rachael Ray's Thai Glazed Chicken Lettuce Wraps. It needed a Vietnamese dipping sauce and this was perfect and easy.

Thank you for posting the authentic recipe.

This is a rather bland version of probably the most important dipping sauce in Vietnamese cuisine, and I would urge readers seeking authenticity to try the livelier version from Mai Pham's Southeast Asian cookbook instead. This keeps for a month if refrigerated: 2 crushed cloves garlic, 1 tsp chili paste, 1/4 cup fish sauce, 2/3 cup hot water, 2 tbsp lime juice with pulp (very important to include the pulp), 1/4 cup sugar. Can be garnished with shredded carrots.
