This was delicious and looks impressive. It isn't difficult but it is time consuming. Leave a couple hours to prepare it for guests.

This was so easy and impressive. I made it for Father's Day this year and it was a huge hit. If you want something special but easy, this is it!

i suggest you use a piping bag for the cream cheese. you might add some cinnamon to the cream cheese as well

This is delicious and easy. I served a tart to my neighbors for breakfast and they raved about it. I used low-fat cream cheese, which tastes just as good as "full-fat". I'm not experienced at working with pastry sheets, so my tarts came out more square than the recipe calls for, but they looked and tasted great so don't worry if you can't exactly duplicate the pastry sizes and shapes the recipe has.

This is my paddle tennis team's favorite treat, when we have a match. Everyone asks for the recipe. Purchased puff pastry makes it so easy, I don't always do the maple glaze, if I am pressed for time, and it is still great. Fast and easy, a keeper!

This was easy and tasty. Next time I'll try reducing the maple syrup more to intensify the flavor. I think it would be good with any fruit filling.

Simple and impressive. Next time I will try with cherry or pineapple filling. Mmmm.

This recipe is great and it really works. I am the Executive Chef at a luxury B&B and I do a variation of this, and the guest go crazy for it. I highly recommend it!

Excellent recipe!! Followed this recipe exactly and it was absolutely delicious. I made it for my friend's brunch and everyone loved it. The next time I make it, I will add the zest of a lemon and see how that turns out.

I made these for Mother's Day and they were great. The only thing I would change, is next time I would add some cinnamon to the sugar. They needed a little bit more kick. Other than that, they were easy, looked yummy and everyone enjoyed them.

This is fantastic! I made several breakfast pastries recently for a brunch and this was hands-down the most delicious. It is fairly easy to make and it looked perfect when I was done. I made it just as the recipe instructed and wouln't change a thing. The glaze added great flavor.

This will be a new staple in our house. I had enough apples to make a double recipe, and two of us finished all four tarts in less than a week. Excellent for breakfast with a cup of coffee, or as yummy, light snack in the afternoon. I am thinking of baking two more and taking them to Thanksgiving dinner as a dessert option.

This tart is delicious. I made it for a brunch, thinking that the guests would eat one tart and I'd have the other to take to a party the next day. The brunch guests ended up eating both tarts! I did a couple of things to simplify making the tarts. First, don't bother cutting strips off the bottom pastry. Instead, simply fold up the ends to give you the higher edges you need. Second, use parchment paper under the tarts when you bake them. This makes clean-up much easier. Finally, be careful when you are reducing the maple syrup. Like all sugar, it boils over quickly. I had a huge mess because I wasn't watching carefully.

Easy use of purchased puff pastry. I've made it for a breakfast meeting and it was devoured. It's not even necessary to glaze it, just sprinkle with some sugar before baking. A nice not too sweet treat

I've made this a couple of different ways now. The first time, I made lots of individual tarts - I cut the pastry into squares (about 3" each side) and then spread on some of the cream cheese mixture and then some sliced raw apple and baked those. Rather nice, but much less effort and yummier the second way: I first cooked the apples with some maple syrup, brandy and spices (cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg). Then I spread the cream cheese mixture on one piece of the pastry and topped with lots of the apple mixture and folded the edges up. Then I used a second piece of pastry as a lid. Wash with egg and put holes in it. Cook for 30 min. I skipped the maple syrup glaze (since I had maple syrup in the cooked apples). Easy and very yummy with vanilla icecream.
