This was great, and would have been even better had I remembered the basil! I used a little less butter than called for because it was all I had in the house and still turned out fine. I would make it again.

I found this yesterday browsing for a new dish to make since my husband and youngest daughter do not eat meat. I always browse the reviews before I make anything. This was exceptional! I did only use 1 bottle of clam juice as noted by the reviews and the sauce was perfect. We had very little leftovers. There was so much flavor in the dish that I will definately be making this again.

My husband made it exactly as written except didn't have fresh basil so used dried. We really enjoyed it. It was light, tasty, and flavorful. I will put this in my recipe binder to make again!

I was using up holiday leftovers for this recipe so it was followed exactly but very close. I used some excellent quality cooked jumbo shrimp, subbed finely chopped sweet onion and chicken stock for clam juice. It turned out really good but next time I will use less stock/juice as it just wasn't thick enough even after almost 20 minutes...but the flavor was nice. I also might try another herb as someone else suggested, tarragon sounds nice but we still liked the basil.

forgot to add that I served over squid ink linguine, which was tasty and a beautiful colour contrast!

Delicious! Took me quite a while (45 mins) to prep all the ingredients (peel & butterfly the shrimp, prepare garlic, onions, lemon rind), but once prepped, cooking was fast and easy. Didn't have clam juice, so used 8oz chicken stock, which was plenty. Also added red pepper and fresh lemon juice as recommended by others. Gave it a wonderful zing and really rounded out the flavours! Only thing that didn't work for me was the basil. Will try fresh tarragon instead next time. A definite keeper!

Wonderful and easy! I did make some substitutions--I added extra lemon juice to the shrimp--2-3 Tbs just after cooking. I could not find plain clam juice so I used two cans of minced clams with juice; the exta shellfish was a nice addition. To lighten it up I used 1/2 part heavy cream and 1/2 part evaporated skim milk. Thus it was not quite as rich as the original recipe but was quite delicious and satisfying nonetheless. I will make this again!

I served this for my boyfriend and he loved it. I made some minor alterations though. I added scallops, asparagus,yellow peppers, and black olives. I also agree that one jar of clam juice is plenty. I will definitely make this again!

I prepared this dish following substitutions suggested by other readers: in lieu of listed ingred. I used shallots, fat free half and half and 8 oz. chicken stock (any more liquid and it would have taken a long time to reduce and thicken. I also squeezed lemon juice and a little salt over the prepped shrimp and refrigerated for a few hours before cooking them. I added the crushed red pepper flakes. Seasoned with salt and pepper, and sprinkled with grated parmesan before serving. Lots of changes but 'base' was there, very quick and simple, but most importantly it was DELICIOUS. Will make often.

My five and eleven year old son's loved this as much as their Mom did when I served it to her on Mother's Day. I only used one 8 oz bottle of clam juice and went a bit heavier on the whipping cream. I followed a reviewers rec by added a tiny amount of red pepper flakes and another rec to use farfalle pasta. I pretty much followed the recipe with the addition of a pinch or two of other seasoning. Unfortunately I could not get fresh basil -- I used dried. I'm sure the fresh would have made it even better. An easy and yummy recipe.

This was a pleasant but forgettable meal. I used something between 1 and 2 bottles of clam juice and some red pepper flakes as others have suggested. Still no cigar...

I make this regularly. I keep a jar of clam base handy, so there is no need to buy bottles of clam juice. I sometimes substitute regular onions for the green onions, I also prefer farfalle pasta and add a bit of parmesan at the end. It is always a hit!

I liked this dish, but in the end didn't think it was worth it to purchase ingredients like clam juice and whipping cream, as ultimately the dish did not taste that different than something like shrimp scampi. It was still good, though, and following the suggestions of others I added red pepper flakes (when I added the garlic) and also squeezed some fresh lemon juice and black pepper on at the end right before serving. Next time though I will ty to go for the same effect with ingredients I readily have on hand.

I made this dish for my entire family on Mother's Day. The best part about this dish is that it scales to large groups easily. When adding the clam juice and cream, I also added 1 tbsp of crushed red pepper (about 1/2 tsp for the recipe's porportions), which created a sweet/spiciness to the sauce. I really enjoyed it and got rave reviews from my family. Note: be careful with the salt.

This dish lacked distinctive flavor. The sauce was bland and needed doctoring. Lemon juice and red pepper flakes helped, but we won't be making this dish again.

I have tried to retire this recipe. My friends keep asking for it, so I keep making it. It is simple, fast and tasty.

The results were uninspired - sauce came out with a good consistency and coated the pasta nicely, but was surprisingly flavorless; I added a little red pepper and that was the primary flavor of the dish. There are better pasta and shrimp recipes that I will make in place of using this one again.

We really liked this recipe, and it was easy for a weeknight. I substituted bay scallops for the shrimp, and I only used one bottle of clam juice (the scallops give off a lot of juice). My husband even thought it was good, and he doesn't really like sauces with cream in them. I also cut back on the butter a bit, to about a 1/2 stick, which was more than enough. Even with all the butter and cream, it had a light, fresh taste and was not overly rich. The lemon zest makes it, the proportion was perfect.

This is a "splurge worthy" dish and great for entertaining. I made it for friends and they all told me I was a great cook, without realizing how easy it was for me to make. I was in a hurry for the sauce to thicken, so I added 1 tsp cornstarch disolved in clam juice towards the end. The only change I'd make next time would be to increase the garlic by a couple cloves.

We loved it. It doesn't hurt to include more linguine (or less shrimp). I used Pinot Grigio for the wine.

Made this for informal company, it made the kitchen smell great and was easy enough that I didn't spend the whole night cooking. I agree, one bottle of clam juice is plenty. My husband prefers angel hair to linguni, so I'll try that next time.

I would absolutely make this recipe again--it's quite tasty and the flavors are great together. A few modifications though: two bottles of clam juice is too much--it waters down the sauce and dilutes the flavors (even after you boil down the sauce). One bottle is plenty. I'd add even more lemon zest and garlice. Lastly, I used shallots instead of green onions - a personal preference that worked out well. Hope this is helpful!

The flavors in this dish are very subltle, as they should be for a seafood pasta! Very tasty. I have made this twice now and have used chicken broth and half and half as substitutions. The whole crew at the firehouse loved it. The sauce seemed a little watery at first but as soon as I tossed the pasta in, the extra starch thickened it up nicely. Next time I will try the red pepper flakes suggestion.

I read the reviews and decided to try this recipe. My family loved it. It was quick and easy, and the flavors blended together beautifully. Even my non-seafood loving son loved the pasta with sauce and no shrimp. I did think that the sauce didn't thicken the way it should; next time, I'll use half the clam juice.

I made this for two, so I cut the recipe in half. Also,I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried. And, substituted half and half for the cream, lime zest or the lemon, and added ground red pepper for some pizzaz. It was very very good. I let the sauce really thicken, and it was not soupy or thin at all, like other reviews indicated. Would definitely make it again.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I followed it as written. It took a little longer to reduce the sauce but due use both bottles of the clam jucie. I agree with other reviewers please do not rate a recipe you have not tested.

I thought this recipe was delicious and have had tried a number of other sauces with shrimp that were just OK. The only difference in my preparation was in the amount of clam juice. I discovered halfway through making it that I only had one small bottle which was equivalent to half the suggested amount. I didn't substitute anything for the missing juice and we thought the consistency and flavor were great, not at all thin or bland. Easy and tasty left over. Will definitely make again.

This was easy and a keeper. I made this exactly as the recipe advised, but used half and half instead of cream. Served with salad and french bread, great for a weeknight quickie meal. This would also be great with clams for a linguine and clam sauce too.

This was great. Definitely a keeper. Added hot pepper flakes as a number of folks suggested. For those who thought it bland - If you read the recipe you should have noticed the lack of herbs & spices while cooking -duh! If you want more kick, then kick it up. I cut down on the garlic, but added marjoram and various spices to the shrimp while cooking.Added the pepper flakes to the sauce,but cayenne would work. If you don't like mild tasting recipes,why pick one and then do as is? The recipe police won't come knocking if you take the initiative and spice it up.

Delish -- quick and easy. I didn't have any clam juice so I used chicken stock instead, and I used half and half instead of cream (I didn't have any cream either)...and I substituted the green onions with shallots (didn't have green onions) -- my husband wolfed this dish down! I'm adding this to my cache of day to day recipes. For the record, I didn't think it was very bland at all -- very tasty -- I added lots of lemon zest and pepper and garlic.

I almost didn't make this because only 53% said they would make it again, but it sounded good and the reviews I read were positive, so I tried it. It was great! Very easy and really delicious. My husband loved it and even my 4-year-old said he'd like to have it again.

I guess people from Austin, TX can't cook. I can however, and this recipe turned out great. I did leave out one jar of the clam juice, because it didn't seem like the sauce would cook down in time. I didn't have a lot of leftovers, and there were only 2 skinny eaters. If you are cooking this for a family with more than 2 boys, then you will need to double the recipe. Oh I also used sweet white wine because that's what I had on hand.

Rating: 3
This is an excellent recipe. The sauce was bit more mild than I expected, based on the ingredients, but it is a very pleasing combination of flavors. Next time I'm planning to use about half the specified amount of clam juice, as the sauce was a little thin, and to reduce the cream and clam sauce mixture separately and then add it to the lemon/wine glaze, to perhaps preserve the intensity of the flavor of the glaze.

I'm sorry, I'm gonna screw up the percentages because I haven't made it yet, but I certainly intend to. Before reading the reviews, I thought it would benefit from some red pepper flakes. And what the heck is wrong with cream and clam juice? You probably don't cook with those every day, and if you don't like them, find another recipe!

Made recipe as directed, and thought it was so-so. Sauce was too thin (yes - finished cooking my pasta IN the sacue) and really flat tasting. Couldn't pinpoint really what else it might need. Tons of fresh parmesean before serving seemed to perk it up a bit. We did eat the leftovers, but probably won't make it again.

To the cook from San Diego...to ensure a thicker sauce always cook your pasta even earlier then el dente, 5 minutes, then when you add your liquids stir the pasta and liquid on med low heat until pastsa is cooked and sauce is thickened. Great trick for many sauces and also allows you to reduce saturated fats by using homo or 2% milk instead of thick unhealthy cream. George in Hamilton Canada

This dish was great...and I actually MADE it, instead of just reading it! How can you review something you haven't actually tasted??? The lemon zest added a great flavor. Next time I might cut the recipe in half since there was a lot left over. But it was delicious.

When I got this from the epicurious website, a couple of days ago, no one had reviewed it. I hoped to be the first. The first, apparently, were people who didn't make the recipe, just had opinions. I made it as written, except I cut it in half for two people. It was ample: another serving awaits microwaving. I used packaged frozen shrimp. Wonderful combination of flavors, good texture, easy to prepare and serve.

What did I do wrong? This received such rave reviews that I could not wait to make it. Even though it had great ingredients we all found it very bland. Also the sauce never thickened so it turned out more like soup! I followed the recipe exactly and can't figure out how I messed it up.

I thought this dish was incredible. I hardly ever make the recipes I find on Epicurious (although I'd like to!); with this one I immediately ran to the store after work to get the ingredients. If I had ordered this dish in a fine restaurant, I wouldn't have been disappointed. I thought it had outstanding flavor. My 8 and 5 year old boys loved it, and they're picky. I would definitely make this recipe again. I might add some red pepper to spice it up a bit. I might try low-sodium chicken broth next time to see if there is a flavor difference - but I thought the clam juice made sense and it tasted great. I personally celebrate the judicious use of cream and salt and wine and all that good stuff once in a while. So take my review with a grain of salt (or pepper, if you prefer). I give this dish four forks to balance out all the reviews from people who just read the recipe as opposed to actually trying it.

This is excellent as written. There are forums for those of you who feel compelled to "review without trying" or "review with substantial substitution". Please use them. To do otherwise skews ratings and is a disservice to those of us who value the results of practiced cooks.

The flavor was ok, but the sauce didn't thicken and I only used half the clam juice. I used half the lemon zest plus two teaspoons fresh lemon juice--maybe that was a mistake because it was a bit bland. I was also reluctant to boil the cream -- wouldn't it curdle? Red pepper flakes would add to the flavor.

It seems a shame to ruin otherwise fresh ingredients with bottled, oversalted clam juice. Yuck
