I don't ordinarily rate things 4 forks - but the ease and versatility of this recipe are what pushed me upwards. I liked the end result, though I didn't follow all the directions. I had firm aseptically-packaged tofu (didn't matter after whipping in food chopper) I subbed ponzu for lemon juice, and shallots/chives for scallions, and I left out the carrot. Still good. I have a feeling that any canned seafoood/whipped tofu/acid/green will work n this recipe.

I did not have parsley but did everything else including the soy sauce. I enjoyed in on crackers.

I didn't have carrots, I didn't have parsley, and I didn't have lemon... and this still turned out great. At first I made a mistake and found I was adding worcesteshire sauce, not soy, but after adding the correct soy, plus a splash of sesame oil and mirin I had on-hand, I really really love this.

Very nutritious and good. Tastes like Tuna salad. Doubled the capers and the scallions called for and added the firm tofu and soy sauce as recommended. My husband "hates" tofu, but loved this.

This has become a staple - I eat it at least once a week! I have also served it to company and all five people who have tried it literally licked their plates clean. Here are my changes: I use firm tofu (the only kind I can get in Greece) which I crumble in the food processor. This prevents the grayness that everyone is commenting on. I use plain nonfat yogurt to bind everything together - about a half cup of it. I use water-packed tuna and add a couple of teaspoons of olive oil and a couple of teaspoons of flaxseed oil. The soy sauce suggested by Stephanie I find is a great addition; I use about 1/2 tbs. Finally, tomatoes are a must - either seed them chop them and add them to the mix, or stuff them with the dip. I like using vine-ripened tomatoes with the stem still attached, and I use small ones so that some of the dip won't fit and therefore "spills" out. I hope this helps!

Awesome appetizer because it is tasty, good for you and quick. I made it for a party and it was all gone. I was surprised that the kids ate it, but they came back for more. I do agree it looks dreadful so put it in a colorful bowl and garnish it with tomato wedges.

This recipe really should be avoided. It's good for you and it tastes, uhhm, okay, but it looks dreadful - sort of grey and watery like mushed up catfood. Might be acceptable used as a dressing in a sandwich.

Wonderful! I spiced it up with a little garlic and a smidge of horseradish. Will probably use a little less lemon juice next time, but I will definately be making it again.

Very bland as an appetizer, but OK stuffed in a tomato

This was very, very good. I made it for lunch today for my daughters ages 9 and 21. The younger one sliced a tomato open as you would for a stuffed tomato and then stuffed it with the tuna/tofu mixture. She then sprinkled it with a little soy sauce which really does add to the flavor quite a bit. My older daughter and I had ours on pita bread with tomatoes and bean sprouts also adding a few drops of soy. Very, very healthy and good. The only other small change I made was to use water packed tuna and once drained I added just a very few drops of good olive oil for a bit of flavor and moisture instead of using the oil packed tuna as suggested.
