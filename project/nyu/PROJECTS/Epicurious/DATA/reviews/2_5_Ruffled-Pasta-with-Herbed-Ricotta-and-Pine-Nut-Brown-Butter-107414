As the recipes is written, it is awful. Very bland like other reviewers commented on. However, if you add a lot of different spices (including basil and thyme) and extra salt its not that bad of a way to use up extra ricotta. Altering it i would say its a 2.5 forks.

one word - NASTY. I'd give this negative forks if I could. It was just awful. Can't think of a way to fix it. The texture was terrible and the flavor so bland. Don't make it!

Disappointed. I made this as a side to sauted chicken with peppers, lemon, caper and peppers, and wound up mixing everything together to brighten the pasta.

Ricotta dulled flavors in this quantitiy. Trying again with 4-6 oz. Broowned butter, pine nuts, herbs were a great combo by themselves.

this is simple and fabulous. We made it with fresh papardelle and the ricotta melted into a creamy sauce that coated each noodle. I can't wait to make this with fresh herbs - I didn't have any on hand and used dried, but the flavor was still delicious. I can see this being a great recipe to turn to when I want to make dinner quickly with what I have on hand in the pantry and fridge, substituting nuts or herbs if needed.

This was so good - I didn''t know that you could do that with ricotta. I will definitely make this again. I used fresh thyme b/c it was all I had on hand and it was still fabulous!

I used homemade ricotta from the local Italian Salumeria. It made all the difference. The flavor of the herbs and the ricotta was really creamy and unique. My husband loved it. He even ate all of the leftovers.

This recipe would have been ok if the texture was better. The ricotta cheese makes it all grainy and it sort of feels like you're eating something with curdled milk in it. The brown butter pine nuts were good. I might try this recipe again without the ricotta

This was excellent - served with roast chicken. Don't stint on the fresh herbs. And I did need to add a cup of the pasta cooking liquid to make it adequately "saucy". Nice to have something "different".

This is a simple recipe that leves you wanting more.It dosen't work with the ruffled pasta but it's great with cheese ravioli's.

It was good and very simple. I actually thought the pine nuts were delicious, but it would be easy to burn them if you weren't careful. I also thought it could do with a little less thinning. It wasn't substantial enough for a main course, even though it was so rich. Next time I would serve it as an appetizer or a side dish.

Pretty good. Doesn't blow me away.

This recipe is very rich and satisfying. Also easy to make. I served this with a salad and homemade garlic bread and my husband was quite happy. I always reserve a cup of the pasta cooking liquid to thin out a sauce, but this recipe needed very little. Do not make this if you are watching your weight!

This was one of the worst meals I have ever made. The texture was straight out of a horror movie-very mushy with little rock like pignoli nuts. If I had a dog I am sure that he would find this dish equally as unacceptable. There is nothing gourmet about this recipe!!!!!
