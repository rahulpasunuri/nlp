Delicious. Hand cut all. Steamed and towel dried the spinach before adding to the mix. Duh - raw, watery spinach in burgers? Put patties in the freezer for 30 min. Served on buns with honey wasabi mayo slaw on top. Really, really good.

I made these last night and they were fabulous. I ran out of eggs so mixed a bit of water and oil with some baking powder - worked just as well. I had the same concern re: binding so I chilled the mixture for a couple of hours then bunged it in the freezer for 15 minutes. As another reviewer wrote, make sure the patties cook for 5 minutes on one side without touching them. Careful flipping is necessary and one of mine split but it didnt matter - they were so delicious. I served mine with an Asian slaw with orange and avocado. I will make this again and again.

Fantastic! Fresh and light, quick to put together (I modified a bit and pulsed salmon in food processor). Pickled ginger really added zest so I recommend you don't skip it.

I made the recipe just as listed and I thought it was delish. I could see adding panko breadcrumbs, but really it doesn't need it. Also, you could easily use canned salmon since the other flavors are quite strong. Overall I thought it was a very good recipe and I'll make it again.

This was mediocre. I added chopped garlic, fish sauce and toasted sesame seed oil to try and make it flavorful. I made the original recipe, made a small patty and sauteed it That is when I decided to jazz it up a bit because it was flavorless. I also think the egg white was not the right ingredient, I would use olive oil mayo So I will try again. That's the joy of cooking!

This was easy & delicious. Changes: I used Cuisinart to process salmon, reduced ginger to 1 Tbl. & made a mustard mayo for dipping.

Easy and delicious! These don't seem like they are going to stay together at all; I was convinced we were going to be making salmon burger hash, but as soon as they hit they pan, they really come together. Served with some wasabi mayonnaise and an Asian-style slaw, these were a hit!

I had to use a food processor to get the right consistency. But, inalso didn't use egg. Instead I used 2 tbs of cornmeal and a baking powder/ oil/ water mixture for vegans (look it up). It was so tasty! I added garlic- because that's what I do. I ate them as patties to cut out the bread calories and served with the roasted cauliflower with kalamata sauce recipe (didn't make sauce this time bc the cauliflower is really good on it's own) which adds a mashed potatos-y component without the starches and ready in 25 min! All time fav and received many compliments :)

The flavor was great, but I wouldn't recommend the recipe to a novice cook. I had a hard time getting everything done and total time in the kitchen was about 3 hours! -_-" The result of my labor was well worth it, despite the burgers falling apart in places, and I would DEFINITELY do it again.

These burgers are amazing! They're easy to throw together and are great topped with some wasabi and stir fry sauce. Didn't use breadcrumbs like some of the other reviewers, but I thought the recipe was great without them. Check out my attempt, including lots of photos: http://www.caseycooks.com/2011/02/salmon-burgers-with-spinach-and-ginger.html

woah, this recipe is amazingly tasty. you should let go of the idea that it should be just like a burger--it doesn't come out exactly like beef, but that's because it's salmon. tasty and healthy.

Wow! Easy and delicious! I made these exactly as written, and molded into burgers and put in fridge for a few hours. I cooked them in pam spray and they held together perfectly! Did not use cuisinart. Hand chopped-very very easy and fast.

Excellent flavor combination, these are delicious. I don't recommend using a cuisinart - the spinach being roughly chopped actually helps with the binding of the burgers. Squish them together as best you can with your hands and sear them for about 5 minutes on one side before flipping. The crust that forms will help keep the burger together...

I added breadcrumbs and use the cuisart per other reviewers--AND this was delicious!! Sooo easy and fast! Served with teriyaki bbq sauce, home-baked garlic fries and an asian flavored coleslaw. I don't have any negatives for this recipe at all, and its definitely going into my regular recipe hopper.

My boyfriend and I absolutely love this recipe. I simplify preparation by just throwing all the ingredients (no chopping!) into a food processor and running it for a few seconds. It works beautifully. We serve it on a soft, squishy roll with pickled ginger and extra soy sauce on top. The whole thing has a wonderful texture and complex, slightly Asian flavor. We make this all the time and love it.

I read all of the reviews and decided to make the burgers earlier in the day and leave in the fridge. Despite that, the burgers did not hold together and I was getting pretty ticked off. So I beat 2 eggs and mixed the entire salmon mixture (including the botched burgers that I had tried to saute) with the eggs. I folded everything into a saute pan (like a frittata or tortilla espanola) and browned on one side; put a plate over the top of the saute pan and flipped the frittata, folded back into the pan and browned on the other side. It turned out to be quite delicious and we cut in triangular slices (like a pie). So much for the burgers! If I try again, I will definitely use more egg/bread crumbs because the consistency did not work to make a burger that held together. If I try it again as a frittata, I would add some carmelized onions!

nice, simple recipe, but i had to add a few cloves of minced garlic and 1 1/2 tbs of flour to keep it together. i'd make it again for sure :)

Instead of dicing into 1/4' pieces, I chopped the salmon much finer, used a whole egg and added a few instant potato flakes that I happened to have on hand. While they still didn't hold together completely, it was better than the first time I tried it when they really fell apart. Make sure the spinach is totally dry before adding.

Followed recipe exactly and had no trouble getting patties to stick together; I found no need for extra egg or bread crumbs as previous reviewers suggested. If you're thinking about making these, just make sure you let them cook long enough before flipping carefully. I like these burgers better than ordinary salmon filets and would definitely make them again.

These burgers were fantastic! I halved the recipe and it still turned out great. Like others mentioned, the best way to cook them is to just spoon the fish mixture onto the pan and the burgers will hold together just fine. I didn't have scallions, so substituted cilantro with great results.

My wife described these burgers as "incredible." I made them exactly as written, and had no problems with the burgers holding together. No extra egg or egg white, no food processor, no resting time, no bread crumbs. A few thoughts on what might contribute to their cohesion: (1) being precise about the ratio of ingredients; (2) mixing them thoroughly; (3) making sure the spinach and scallions are dry -- two passes through a salad spinner for the spinach and paper towels for both the spun spinach and the scallions; (4) plop down 1/2 c. of the mixture into the skillet with a measuring scoop, and use the back of the scoop to form the mound into a patty. Oh, I served them on toasted, egg- enriched hamburger buns along with the pickled ginger. Seemed a little dry, so I put some A-1 sauce on mine. Not bad (my wife shudders).

I made these for my roommates and was told they "could be described as a bouquet of flavor". I followed reviewers suggestions and plopped a handful into the pan rather than trying to form patties. They stayed together very well, and looked beautiful atop rice. Definitely a recipe to hold onto.

This was really amazing. I used the suggestions to make rice into "buns" underneath and the soy ginger reduction drizzled ontop--it looked very gourmet. Also chilling the salmon burgers for 20 mins helps them stay together before cooking. Will definitely make again!

Yeah, this tastes great, but you'll need atleast 5 napkins to clean yourself after the burger has fallen apart! Not a good recipe to start on for beginning chef's. It does taste great though, if you don't mind the mess!

I've made this several times. Even those proclaiming a dislike of Salmon love them. Always have added the bread crumbs. Last night I found a hamburger mold/press (never never use it on a real burger!). Worked great. Pressed them into a well formed and held together patty. Served over sushi rice formed to look like a bun. Add some ginger honey soy sauce reduction as a finish. Yum!

Logically if you add a lot of fresh spinach to the raw salmon, the burger will not be able to stick together. So, I added a full egg and some breadcrumbs (not flavored) and served the burgers alongside a spinach salad (or you could do garlic sauteed spinach). The burgers held together beautifully!

I've made tons of recipes off this site, and by far, this was the worst. I was prompted to make it by seeing it in the Gourmet Cookbook. Came to the site to read reviews, and incorporated some of the suggested changes. The "burgers" did not stick together well (we ended up pretty much having salmon and spinach stir fry) and even if they had, the taste was not all that great. Big disappointment!

Not great. Not alot of flavor aside from the spinach and salmon. Patties did not want to form and ended up just "plopping" them in the pan as someone else mentioned. Will stick to my other salmon recipes.

This was DELICIOUS, even though I had some problems getting them to hold together (most of this was my own fault). I divided the recipe in 1/2 to serve 2, and started out by adding 1/6 cup of bread crumbs (as reviewers have suggested), but I used ONE WHOLE egg for my 1/2 recipe. I had to keep adding more and more bread crumbs until the consistency was not so sloppy. Next time I will pitch that extra 1/2 of an egg!!! Served each burger on a Kaiser roll that had a bit of Miracle Whip smeared on each side. Topped the patties with Provolone cheese, tomato, and lettuce. YUM, YUM.

Tastes just like salmon with spinach. Why not just cook the salmon and the spinach separately.

We just loved this. I noted some of the problems others had with the patties falling apart and used my meat grinder to process the salmon. After I had combined all the ingredients I chilled it in the fridge and then scooped out smaller patties with a 1/c cup scoop. They were no problem to turn over and even those in my family who don't usually like salmon were begging for more. The pickled ginger was wonderful with them too!!

This is delicious! I added 2 tsp of cornstarch to help it stick together, and found that even though it didn't make real patties, it did stick together once cooked. I'll add more fresh ginger next time - I just wanted a little more zing to it.

Loved it!!! I doubled the recipe and FOLLOWED the exact recipe. Did not even try to mold them into patties, just took a BIG spoon, scooped from the bowl and plopped (carefully) into frying pan. Cooking made the items adhere together, and then "carefully" turned them over. The recipe was great as is. I also placed half in the refrigerator for about 1 hour before cooking. They seemed to stick together better. Not once did I touch the igredients to form patties - just used a spoon. I think following the recipe made a delicious moist burger! I ate it on top of brown rice... very yummy!!!

I wasn't able to keep the burgers from falling apart, so I mixed some of the spinach, salmon, egg white, and soy sauce in a blender and used the paste to hold the rest of the salmon and spinach together. I also added some garlic to add some spice. My company thought they were delicious! We eat them often and even cold on a bed of baby spinach for lunch!

Ladies and Gentlemen, these salmon burgers are Fantastic! I made them in a little bit of a rush, but the concept is so simple, it wasn't even a problem. If you don't have time to chill them, don't worry, just add some seasoned breadcrumbs-- they hold up great. I have to admit, I'm not a fan of ginger AT ALL, so I put an Italian spin to them and omitted the soy sauce and the ginger, instead substituting plain old salt, rosemary and tarragon; I almost fainted, they smelled so good. Instead of using a food processor, pretend it's beef and just squish the fish and spinach and everything else together with your hands. You'll smell like raw fish for a few hours no matter how many times you wash your hands, but the consistency and presentation that result from this method make it all worth it. Throw these on a sweet bread like Egg Rolls, use the leftover spinach as your side and give in to some fries and you'll have a great meal that you and your special ones will love over and over again.

Ha! I'm still laughing because I used a previous reviewers suggestion of using the food processor to mix the spinach and salmon. I thought it odd that nobody mentioned that these burgers were bright green! Today, I checked the picture and realized that my salmon burgers were quite a bit different. Next time I will skip the food processor and follow the recipe exactly. Even with my error, these were fantastic. I found a tartar recipe from the site that went nicely with them. Definite repeater! By the way, if you're looking for a great St. Patty's day meal, try using the food processer.

This was a yummy recipe. I used 2 egg whites as well and chilled the patties for about 3 hours. They held up well when I cook them. I also, used cooking spray and a little soy sauce rather than butter when I cooked them. This made them a little less fatning.

This was really, really delicious (and pretty). I used 2 egg whites and a processor for 2 or 3 seconds tops. I had no trouble at all working with it. Seemed messy at first (not at all like beef burger patties, so don't expect that), but once it hit the hot pan it held together great. (I did scoop it into four patty-like mounds and chill as instructed for about 2 hours - maybe that helped?) I served with wild rice and a nice Chardonnay. Boyfriend RAVED.

This was excellent. I put the somewhat wet patties in the freezer for 1/2 hour enough to handle easily. I didn't bother with buns, just ate as a patty with tartar on the side. Excellent.

really, really great recipe and easy to make! i used two egg whites, instead of one, or the whole egg like others had recommended. i didnt want the yolk to overpower the subtle flavor of the salmon. i didnt have to use breadcrumbss, either. the patties stayed together fine once on the pan.

I, like others, used the entire egg. I used about 1/4 cup bread crumbs (thought 1/2 might be too much). I rough-cut the salmon, spinach and scallions ... mixed everything in a bowl ... and then ran it all through the grinder. Twice. I tried letting the patties sit in the freezer for about 10 minutes while I cleaned up, then cooked them in about 1/4 cup olive oil and some garlic powder. They held together great, didn't stick, and were fantastic on rolls with provolone cheese, lettuce and tomato!

These can be described as I have been...a beautiful mess. Delicous to eat and gorgeous to look at but stubborn as all get out. Even with the addition of bread crumbs and the whole egg, as others suggested, these were so hard to make as burgers. I did not have a non stick skillet, that may make a difference. All that said, I will make again because the taste is wonderful and that's enough for me.

This recipe is great ---- with a few modifications. I read everyone's comments here, used everyone's comments, and found this worked REALLY WELL: to this recipe add 1/2 cup breadcrumbs and use the whole egg. THEN, after mixing everything together, put in food processor and pulse ONLY for two or three seconds. This cut up the fish finer than I could do with a knife, and thus the patties hung together perfectly. This recipe could be altered or spiced up a bit, but I will definitely use it again . Also, I fried them in peanut oil which added a more interesting flavor...

OUTSTANDING flavor. I used a whole egg instead of just the white. I found if you gently ease the burger into the pan, kind of rolling it out from your palm it went more successfully into the pan. Additionally, if you make sure the salmon has cooked halfway up the burger before turning it you should have no problem. My family does not like eggplant so I served it on homemade potato pancakes.
