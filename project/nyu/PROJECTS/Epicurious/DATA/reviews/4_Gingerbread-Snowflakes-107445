Every Christmas season we make gingerbread cookies with the grandchildren and I've tried a slightly different recipe each time. THIS IS THE ONE! With a few additions, THIS is our gingerbread recipe for all time! YES, double the spices, at least. AND, we turned these into "3 Ginger" gingerbread cookies with the addition of grated fresh ginger and some finely chopped crystalized ginger. Also added 1/2 tsp. of black pepper. We use parchment paper on the cookie sheets and used the left-over dough (after much use of cookie cutters) to make smaller, round "thumb-print" cookies. Final word: The kids LOVE to see how the molasses, etc. FOAMS after the baking soda is added. (OK, one more word... I love making this on the stove and kneading by hand.) This recipe makes me HAPPY!

Who says no to a enthusiastic 6 yr old who wants to make old fashioned gingerbread cookies ? It wasn't going to be me, despite my opinion that gingerbread was more decorative than delicious. Fast forward to the morning after and I am here to say this is these are fantastic!! I was skeptical about the dough as I was adding in the flour. I recommend sifting the flour, but maybe if I'd persevered, the lumps would have dissipated on their own. I think I used closer to 4 C flour in all. All told, this dough is a joy to work with and the cookies are delicious. Gingerbread redemption!!

I'm not sure why there are so many great reviews on here. I thought these were not sweet enough. The dough was easy to work with, though.

I never thought I would be able to make gingerbread cookies - but this recipe turned out to be GREAT! I double up on the spices as per other reviews - and it was a hit. Definitely use a big saucepan since the baking soda will make the mix rise like crazy. I was only able to get 3 dozen gingerbread men cookies. The dough is so easy to work with. Will definitely make more this weekend!

Followed the recipe as is, so easy and the dough was so easy to roll out and cut. I made little gingerbread men. My son came home from school kept sneaking a cookie every time he walked past them. Needless to say he loved them. We'll be lucky to have any to give away.

I made this recipe with the spices as written. Instead of flour I used Pamela's Gluten Free Baking Mix, I did put in half of the baking soda since some is included in the mix. The cookies turned out great and were easy to work with. The dough was such a great consistency that my 3 and 6 year old grandchildren could roll them out! My family members liked the level of spice as in the original recipe.

This is my favorite gingerbread recipe. The flavor is great from cooking the spices with the molasses, and it is a great dark brown color. Someone asked last year if this can be used for gingerbread houses. I have used it for years, for small houses (I dont' make the huge showpieces). Just make sure you have a good thickness (1/4"), and increase the baking time. Happy holiday baking!

I doubled the spiced and I chilled the dough for just a little while and it was very easy to work with. Next time I will roll them a little thinner for crispier cookies but they were very tasty and unlike some others recipes didn't crack or break.

A Christmas miracle: a cut out xmas cookie that mixes easily in one pot, requires no chilling, and cuts and handles without fuss or breakage. Better yet, the cookies taste great! Made as directed, I did add 1/4 tsp cayenne and 1/4 tsp chili pepper for some extra kick. Used a simple powdered sugar and 1/2 & 1/2 icing, with lemon extract, vanilla and tincture of cayenne for a redhot flair. Will make this a standard. WEll received.

I made this with my daughter who can't and won't cook. But this was very simple and easy to make. I doubled the spice as previous reviewers had suggested, you can even add more. I might consider adding 1 T of 5 spice next time. Also, I baked them for 8 minutes and made them extremely thin. They turned out to be perfect crisp cookies. I didn't bother with the icing, though I am sure that would have been nice as well.

Question: I've made these as cookies before and found it pretty easy to work with, especially given my "helpers" are 1, 2 and 4. Does anyone know if I could also use this dough refrigerated overnight and cut into BIG pieces - i.e., for a gingerbread house?

Rating: 3
Since there is an egg allergy in my family, I replaced the egg with 1 Tbsp flax meal + 3 Tbsp water (mix & let sit to gel a bit before using) to great effect. I'd like to enter 3.5 forks, really. I took the many reviewers' advice & doubled the spices: yum! My toddler & I got a big kick out of the boiling molasses mixture turning to foam with the baking soda, and I really appreciated that it was all mixed in a single pot. We'll be using this recipe again soon for Gingerbread Skeletons at Halloween & again at Christmastime. This is a keeper.

Just a note - if your cookies are crisp and only take six minutes, trying rolling out the dough a little less. Roll out to a generous quarter inch.

I made gingerbread people with this recipe, exactly as written (but doubled). The results were excellent and the dough is very easy to work with. I used an egg white, confect. sugar and vanilla royal icing with good results.

Made exactly as the recipe states except ended up baking the cookies for only 6 minutes. Agree that they need more spices! Also, my cookies came out crisp- not soft. Would prefer my cookies to be slightly soft. In all, the cookies were easy to make and turned out very pretty. Will try one more time, make adjustments-- and then maybe search for another recipe.

Very easy to handle dough which got easier to handle as it rested on the counter. Also very tasty cookies despite all the handling to cut and decorate. Will never bother to look for another gingerbread recipe again.

Rating: 4
Delicious. I doubled the spices, but as someone pointed out, my spices were old, so I suspect they were not particularly pungent to begin with. They were not crispy coming out of the oven but did crisp up upon cooling off. I tried to roll the dough as thinly as I could in order to get crispier cookies. And the suggestion to roll them right on the parchment paper you're going to bake on is brilliant! I did not have to move the cookies at all prior to baking, thus had no tears in the dough. Just be sure to leave a little room around each cookie for expansion while baking.

Rating: 4
Gave it 4 stars on the basis of how fast and easy these are to make. They taste good too, but what matters is that my 7 & 9yo were able to make these mostly by themselves with supervision at the stove. They rolled it out like experts and the dough is especially tasty!

LOVE this recipe! I am so tired of making dough, refrigerating dough, taking out to soften to cut cookies, re-refrigerating leftobers between baking... This is a much simpler recipe and it's delicious! My 5 year old just helped me bake a batch of snowflakes. We made a simple powdered sugar icing. Piped it on and then pressed each in coarse sugar or tiny white nonpariels.

These were AWESOME. I made a second batch substituting corn syrup for molasses and adding vanilla and they made great vanilla cookies too.

Fun and easy to make. I did find the dough a bit soft for cutting immediately. It was a pleasure to roll, but I had to refrigerate it for a few minutes (5-10) before I could cut them and have the dough hold its shape from the cutter to the cookie sheet! I halved the recipe, except for the spices, and I was a tad short on ginger. They flavor is nice, but I wish I had had more ginger. I also substituted 1/2 dark corn syrup and 1/2 maple syrup for the molasses since I didn't have any. It worked fine. Since some reviews said the cookies were a bit soft, I did half of the brown sugar as white sugar instead and they came out nice and crisp. Yum!

Rating: 3
this recipe was pretty good- easy to make and work with. i halved the recipe and kept the spices the same- (effectively doubling the spices), and the cookies have a nice kick to them. i do prefer my gingerbread crispy rather than soft, and these cookies were definitely soft. i cooked some batches for 6 minutes and other for 12 minutes, and it seemed to make no difference.

I'd never made gingerbread cookies before I found this recipe, but was pleasantly surprised with how easy they were to make. They turned out absolutely delicious, but I would definitely like to experiment with the recipe a little to see if I can make them even better (change up the spice amounts as other users have suggested). I paired them with a homemade chocolate frosting and the combo is to die for.

Excellent recipe. Flavor is beautiful and they knead easily. I didn't cook so long that they lost their softness so need to handle with care when transferring to the cooling rack. Can't wait to take them to the grandkids for decorating!

This is a fantastic recipe! First time I made gingerbread that did not require refrigeration for 2 hours. Was a little skeptical but it was the easiest gingerbread dough that I ever made. The dough rolled out beautifully and was able to re-rolled several times. This is definietly a recipe that will be made for future holiday's.

Rating: 4
I used several intricate 2-4 inch snowflake cutters and the cookies held their shape very well during baking. Also, I doubled the spices and it was just enough, I could even have added more. Thank you for the suggestion to cut the dough over parchment paper so you don't have to transfer the cookies. The first time I made this recipe I had trouble because the dough is very soft and needs to be rolled out thin. Overall - great taste and beautiful looking! Soft rather than crisp. (if you ice them be prepared - these are rather time-intensive)

Rating: 3
The dough is AWESOMELY easy to work with - my assisants were 2 and 4 and we managed to make something edible. That's saying something!!! I used blackstrap molasses, as that's what I had on hand, so the taste and color of the cookies is much darker/richer, and based on that I didn't double the spices, as some suggest. The cookies came out fragrant and strong-tasting. I agree with earlier posts about the timing - I left mine in for 9 min, and would go down to 8 next year...

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe exactly and these were great. One tip, I only baked for 6- 7 minutes and they were quite crispy, so watch them carefully while baking so they don't overcook.

This is a mild tasting gingerbread cookie. If you are like me and like your gingerbread cookies to be strong flavored and almost burn the back of your throat in spiciness, I highly recommend doubling the amount of spices in this recipe. I REALLY wish I would have, as many other reviewers have suggested it. The texture of the cookie is very nice, however, it's tender and not too overly crispy. I'll make them again, but will definitely add more spices next time.

Best gingerbread recipe ever! I had my 5yr old helping (he threw the butter chunks in- 1,2,3). We rolled and re-rolled the dough many times, and it was so easy to work with! The last scraps became a "snake", which was just as tasty as the cookies. 10 mins tops for perfect cookie texture!

Good recipe. Cookies came out very soft. Next time I'll probably add a bit more cinnamon and ginger and a little less ground clove, but the cookies came out lovely. (Though I used store-bought icing to facilitate the decorating process.)

These are my "go to" gingerbread cookies. They are nice because they are more cakey than crispy, I like to roll them thinner to get a good balance. They are nice amount of spice when doubled for me (I really like to taste the spices though).

Rating: 4
LOOOOOVE this recipe! I knocked a few minutes off the cooking time (so 7-8 min in oven) so that they would be soft. Also, I rolled them on the thicker side, although this can be a little too soft for some big cookies. (A 7 min cooking time yields large gingerbread men so soft that they like to bend in the middle.) Anyway, delicious. My neighbor said they were the best gingerbread cookies she's even eaten.

these are great but I modified as follows: mixed in 1/2C. Whole wheat flour to make them healthier doubled spices including 1T. fresh grated ginger (will add more next time too!) comments: dough is very sticky so use lots of flour for rolling. puff up beautifully when baked. FOR BOYS: we made dinosaur cookies and decorated with green & brown frosting and sprinkles! VERY fun for a boys party!!

I agree fully with other reviewers--the spices need doubling, and the ginger can be tripled if you like ginger (I do). I wonder why the butter has to be cut into pieces and added. I melted the two sticks of butter in bowl, in the microwave, and then poured in very slowly. It seemed easier. Also: it seems really important to let the contents of the saucepan cool a little bit before mixing the egg in; the recipe should say "wait a couple of minutes," so that the egg doesn't cook. One annoying thing: you have to roll the dough out properly the first time and maximize it for cookie cutting, because when you roll it out again, the dough is harder, and crumbly. You can't really roll it out a third time; I had to throw all the scraps out, which could have easily made several more cookies. I don't like wasting! I think the cookies taste good with the adjustments, and I'll probably make them again. But the two-fork rating stands because the adjustments have to be made and because of the wastage of cookie dough.

I have been looking for a good recipe for gingerbread cookies for years and I finally found it! I also doubled the spices and mine were done two minutes sooner than the recipe called for, but these are the best! I also loved that because you mix everything in the one pot, there are fewer dishes to clean up. Super easy. :)

What a great recipe! The dough is soft and completely manageable. The tip about rolling out on parchment, cutting then removing the excess and then move parchment with cookies to baking pan makes doing rolled cut cookies a snap. Kudos on that one. This is a very mild cookie that children would like and you can't say that with most g-breadmen recipes. One could double the spices or leave as is. Sure wish I could find a sugar cookie recipe as good as this one. A definate "keeper".

I like the texture of these cookies very much. But I also agree with previous reviewers: doubling the spices seems crucial.

very easy to work with, very delicoous SOFT cookie. No additional flour means it wasnt crumbly nor tough. However, I had made these to hang on the Christmas tree ! Thought I was smart by cutting little holes before baking with a straw.... no go. They are soft and yummy, but not enough flour for hanging up on the tree. FYI.

So easy and tasty! This was my very first time making gingerbread cookies and they turned out perfect. I was looking for a "milder" version so my 2 yr old would eat them and he came back for seconds. The dough made around 50 3" gingerbread man cookies. I did not have a chance to count them before my son and my husband started munching on them. Great tip on rolling, cutting and baking on the same parchment paper! So much less hassle and no broken arms or legs. Will use this recipe every year. I used the exact amount of spices as recipe asks for and molasses labeled "mild flavor".

This is now our default gingerbread cookie recipe--sorry, Grandma! They dough is so pliant and the spices are exactly right.

This recipe as written is two forks; if you up the spices as previous reviewers have, it becomes four forks. My spices are all fresh and even so, this cookie is way too mild. I tripled the ginger and doubled the allspice, cloves and cinnamon - perfect! I love the method in this recipe, it is easy and you only dirty one pot. It does get tough to stir after the flour addition, but it is worth it!

These cookies are great - I've been follwoing the recipe exactly for 5 years. I double the recipe each year and get enough cookies from my williams-sonoma snowflake cookie cutters (5 different concentric sized snowflakes) to use for multiple events and cookie exchages - I made 200 last night. One revelation (i might be the last person to realise this) - roll the dough out on the parchement you will bake it on and cut the cookies out on there. Take away the excess and slide the parchement onto a pan. Second, the icing takes a long time to pipe, and last year my wrist hurt so much that I ended up dipping the tops of a bunch of the two smallest sizes in a thinner version of the icing & sprinkled it with white sparkly sugar, so some snowflakes were completely white on the tray. They loooked great and that saved a ton of time and sanity to escape piping about 50 of them . . .

This recipe is great and so easy! I followed reviewers' suggestions and doubled all the spices. The dough was easy to work with, and I also rolled it out more than twice. I cut out super-big (handprint-sized) snowflakes, which baked perfectly on parchment paper: crisp outsides and soft insides. They are very fragrant and made my house smell great, but perhaps the molasses is a bit too strong? I might cut back on that just a smidge next time. I doubled the recipe and came out with over 4 dozen super-large cookies.

These are great! They're the *classic* gingerbread cookie. Just the right amount of spices (make sure they're fresh), and not one spoke more loudly than the other.Co-workers who don't normally like gingerbread were begging for more. Their texture is reminiscent of the cookie part of an ice cream sandwich, and even days later in a tin, they're still soft. They're also entertaining to make with kids, as the boiling of the first few ingredients when mixed with the baking soda creates this "molasses marshmallow" looking concoction. The resulting dough feels like a warm kitten in your hands. Everything about this recipe is great. I'll be making this a yearly staple.

Absolutely perfect!! Perfect for making gingerbread men. They are soft but hold their shape, and the flavor is so delicious. Just as many other users, I tripled the ginger and doubled the other spices. I don't know why it says that it takes 2 1/2 hours to make - I went from step 1 to cookies in my mouth in under an hour. :)

Rating: 3
Per other reviews, I doubled the spices and tripled the ginger. The cookies were too strong for my taste - think double the ginger would be plenty. It may be that some of the other reviewers used old spices and that's why they thought so much additional spice was necessary? My spices were brand new and very pungent. Also, I made the icing recipe but without the powdered egg whites (because I couldn't find them) and it turned out fine.

Added 1/8 teaspoon of ancho chili powder which gave the cookies a nice subtle kick! Also added an extra 1/4 cup of honey and omitted the clove, substituted with nutmeg. Doubled spice, tripled the ginger.

I love this recipe and have made it over and over again! The cookies don't last long - once you have a taste you won't stop at one!! I 'improve' the ginger flavour but doubling the listed amount and give it texture by finly chopping in crystallized ginger. These go even faster!

The molasses completely overshadows the spice in this recipe (even after doubling the spice as recommended by others). I'll make this again since its fairly straightforward (and doesn't require a chill step) but will play with spice and molasses levels.

Doubled the spices, tripled the ginger as suggested by others and WOW were they good. I couldn't stop eating them! I actually used a cookie press to make them... the dough didn't work in the press until I used the "bar" shape. I piped them out in long ribbed ribbons and cut them into shorter pieces. The thin ginger snaps were crisp and delicious and looked beautiful. No icing necessary.

BEST gingerbread cookies I have ever eaten. I normally dont even like gingerbread cookies, they are hard and dry and&well&blecch. I only made these because I wanted to make gingerbread men w/my child for Christmas. With the recommended changes of 2x the spices and 3x the ginger, these cookies are OUT OF THIS WORLD. They stay soft which was the main reason I liked them so much, and were so flavorful and yummy. Dont be scared of upping the spices, its what they need and my daughter loved them so its not like it turns them into cookies meant for adults. Theyre great uniced but I must admit, adding some kind of royal icing or glaze (I used a different recipe) definitely sends them over the top. This is the only time in my life I have ever, ever gone back to eat another gingerbread cookie&and another&and another. I couldnt stop eating them. I had to explain to my daughter why all the cookies were gone!

Rating: 3
Yum! I also took the advice of other reviewers: doubled the spices, tripled the ginger and used half honey and half sugar. Sprinkled cookies with raw sugar before baking for nice crunch. My own modifications: I also added about 1 tbsp. very finely diced fresh ginger. And instead of brown sugar, I decided to try a brown sugar/Splenda blend I found at the store. I was very pleased. They turned out really great - nicely spicy, slightly soft with a crispy edge. I will definitely make these cookies again next year. (This was my first time cooking with Splenda, mostly out of curiousity. I was pleasantly surprised.)

These cookies were pretty good. We took the advice of a reviewer to double the spices and triple the ginger. However, we forgot to add extra sugar--BIG MISTAKE. We sprinkled the tops of the cookies with natural sugar crystals which almost made up for it. We also added nutmeg. The cookies were good but were a little dry and not quite sweet enough. However, the whole batch was gone very quickly.

I made this cookies with some of the suggestions and they turned out great. I used half molasses and replaced the other half with honey. i doubled all the spices, except for the ginger - which i tripled. i also added in a 1/4 cup more sugar at the end, but when making again would just add it in in the beginning. they turned out AWESOME. tasty, with good ginger spice and soft. we accidently left some out overnight and while they hardened up a bit, they were still relatively chewy, and softened right up in the microwave. i would definitely make these again. i would say we only got 2 dozen cookies out of the recipe though cause we used bigger cut outs.

I gave this recipe 3 forks only because I made a change. I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the spices and the cookies came out absolutely delicious. The dough was so easy to work with. I iced them with a simple icing of powered sugar, butter, a touch of vanilla, and milk. For all the days that the cookies lasted they just got better and better.

This is my fourth year making these cookies. Everyone loves them, and I do the recipe just as written. I cook so much that my spices are always fresh, which might make a difference for those who aren't getting enough flavor from their spices. The snowflakes are beautiful using the snowflake cutter set from WS. I also make chewy ginger snaps from The Ginger People recipe, and those are a spicier ginger flavor and completely different texture, so all bases are covered!

Beautiful dough, rich and glossy. Easy to work with, rolled thin - a crisp sturdy cookie, rolled thick - a firm chewy cookie. Original recipe is very bland though. Doubled the spices as reviewers recommended, still not spicy enough. Will try adding mace and pepper to my next batch.

These cookies are great!! The comment I received was, "Wow! I normally break my teeth on gingerbread cookies, but these are wonderful!"

Also LOVED that refrigeration was not needed...

Hi, I just wanted to tell everyone this is an excellent gingerbread recipe. When I went to the ABC cake decorating shop I ran into a women from Germany and she told me to replace the brown sugar with honey, so they won't get so hard. I did that and they turned out nice and soft. I cut out German Victorian Santa Clauses and put a Victorian paper santa on them and icing with a hole at the top to hang on the Christmas tree then eat them. Yummy!

This was pretty easy and I made it exactly as written- I did not double the spices as many people have written. Dough is very easy to work with, though I don't think I added enough flour while kneading as my first cut outs were a little hard to get off the counter. I also re-rolled the dough more the once. Very chewy cookies- cut mine thick and cooked 10 minutes. Excellent- my 2 and 4 year olds liked them too!

Wow. I couldn't wait to make these cookies after all the fantastic reviews. I did everything suggested: take off stove as soon as the molasses mix comes to a boil, roll between wax paper, double the spices...I made all sorts of cut outs. Unfortunately I waited until the last pan to actually taste one. I am an experienced baker so I don't know what went wrong except perhaps I shouldn't have doubled the spices, but whatever it was, these were as exciting as eating a raw mushroom--not much flavor.

Excellent cookies -- I doubled the spices (nearly tripling the ginger, which was a little old, but was okay since we increased it) and added just a pinch of cayenne too. SO GOOD! Got lots of compliments on them, and we will definitely make them again. We tried thinner cookies and thicker ones to see what we liked better, but wound up liking them all.

Well, even though I deviated from the recipe by taking the advice of previous reviewers, this still deserves 4 forks for being such an easy and satisfying recipe. I doubled the spices and added a dash of cayenne. ABSOLTELY DELICIOUS and no fiddly, sticky and fickle doughs like other ginger biscuits. From someone who loves their ginger - this is the biscuit to make this Christmas.

This is almost an idiot-proof recipe. I doubled the spices (I think I might need to add just a touch more ginger as well) and also added a teaspoon of vanilla. This is a very forgiving dough and I found I didn't even need to roll it out between waxed paper. I would caution though, if you are baking on a Silpat or other non-stick surface on a regular cookie sheet, I found that the cookies needed about 10 minutes as opposed to 8, but they were soft, chewy, and delicious. I frosted mine with cream cheese frosting and the cookie plate was mobbed.

i gave it 3 instead of 4 only because i did double the spices in the original recipe plus added mace, so i don't think the recipe is perfect as is. however, i would give the technique 4 stars if i could. the dough is very easy to make and a dream to work with. i suspect that some people who are having trouble with the consistency are either not getting the molasses/sugar to a big enough boil or are letting it boil too long. i watched closely, and turned the heat off the second it reached a roiling boil. like others have posted, rolling the dough between wax paper makes the whole process much easier and cleaner. i like soft cookies, so i rolled mine at about 1/4" and baked them for 6 minutes. my first batch got crispy at the 8 minutes others recommended for softer cookies. i would suggest that everyeone, whether you like soft or crispy cookies, bake yours for 5 minutes and then watch them very closely.

I made these yesterday for a cookie decorating party. Although a bit fussy to make, the dough is easy to work with. I followed the advice of others (thanks!) and doubled the spices. I might add a bit of white pepper next time, or even increase the ginger a bit more, but these are pretty good and very forgiving. My decorators ate them right up.

This is the best and easiest gingerbreak cookie I have found. I used 1/3 c. honey and 1/3 c. molasses and doubled the spices as some cooks suggested. I made gingerbread men and used red hots for eyes, mouths and buttons--no frosting. My whole family loves them.

I made this recipe as written, except that I doubled the spices as suggested by some reviewers. The cookies were good, but not great. Then I tripled the spices, added another 1/3 cup molasses, and another teaspoon of baking soda. I baked them for 8 minutes, as suggested by some of the reviews, and the cookies were awesome. I swear, I heard angels singing when I took my first bite. They were chewier, spicier, tastier, but also a bit more likely to break because of the change in texture. All in all, with the changes, a practically perfect gingerbread cookie (which my kids like, too).

The dough is very easy to work with - no broken cookies! Served them unadorned with vanilla ice cream and lemon sorbet. Many compliments. I doubled the ginger - next time I'll probably double all the spices as suggested by other reviewers.

I used this recipe to make both a gingerbread house and cookies. The dough was very easy to work with - not sticky at all. I doubled up on the spices, but I think I'll add even more ginger next time. I also rolled the dough thinner than suggested and substituted shortening for the butter which worked very well for crispy cookies.

This recipe is fantastic--every step was easy enough that my kindergartener was pretty much the chef here! She wanted to make a gingerbread house(which it suited just fine)The dough is so easy to work with, I am going to keep this recipe close at all times.

Fast, easy, and tasty! Not the most amazing cookies I've ever had, but I still find myself reaching for the cookie plate more than I should. Made a simpler icing (powdered sugar, skim milk, vanilla) that still tasted great on the cookies.

Great recipe. Took it to a holiday cookie exchange and everyone raved about it. People asked for the recipe, which makes it a winner in my book. Only thing I changed was I looked at previous people's suggestions and doubled the spices and cut baking time to 8 minutes to make it chewier.

Excellent! Easy! Perfect...even though I didn't have allspice (I used Pumpkin Pie Spice instead). I'd never made gingerbread before and I thought it would be hard, but it was one of the easiest cookies I've ever made. And my 3 year old helped me and loved every minute!

This was a great recipe. The dough was wonderful to work with. Perfect elasticity. It rolled out wonderfully and baked up perfectly. The cookies were delicious and have a wonderful texture. I will make this again. Next time I may add a little more of the spices just to give it an extra zing.

Rating: 3
This recipe lives up to its rave reviews: it is tasty, surprisingly fast and the dough is incredibly easy to work with. Unlike other reviewers, I found there is plenty flavour from the spices. But the recipe benefits from a little extra sugar: I added 3/4 c. sugar instead of the 2/3 c. Last time I made them I was a little short on molasses (had 1/2 c. on hand instead of the 2/3 called for in the recipe) and that didn't seem to affect the recipe negatively. All in all, this one's a definite keeper.

This is the best gingerbread cookie recipe ever. It is easy to make, very easy to work with - no sticking, easy rolling - holds shapes well and tastes great. I began with making Halloween shapes, then went on to experiment with complicated shapes to see how well the dough would hold up. No problem! Even intricate cookie shapes came out beautifully!

This was the best gingerbread "cookie" recipe I've ever tried...I baked my cookies for 8 minutes, came out soft. I doubled the spices...truly delicious. Best of all, dough was very easy to roll and did not stick!! I'm sending this recipe to all my friends!!

Loved these cookies! I do not consider myself a baker but this dough was so easy to work with even I could roll and cut them. The cookies are wonderful. They stayed soft for me after baking which I love. I'm with a previous reviewer who said s/he doesn't add egg whites to his/her icing and the icing always sets up. Everyone loved these cookies.

So simple - in less than 30 minutes (and only one dirty pot) you can have freshly baked gingerbread cookies to decorate. They were very flavorful - used honey a little robust molasses. A keeper.

Rating: 2
Weak on flavor (despite fresh spices) and could use a bit more sugar (and I'm not the type to add extra sugar). However, the dough was quite easy to work with. If you try this recipe, watch your oven closely - mine were done in eight & one-half minutes; nine minutes meant they were burnt.

I made these cookies last year and loved them. Had a hard time finding the recipe again (they don't come up when you just put in "gingerbread cookies" in the recipe search, you must put in "snowflakes" as well. Silly.) and I was bummed. Finally found last year's Gourmet and just finished a batch. I am not a great baker and seek out very user friendly cookies for my kid's teacher's Christmas baskets each year. This dough is incredibly easy to work with and the cookies are tasty and just a little chewy (I roll them out fairly thick). I make large cutouts and have lots of fun decorating. They make a great presentation when wrapped in plastic bags with festive bows and included in a basket of other goodies. Definitely give them a try.

I've made this gingerbread recipe probably a dozen times since it first came out last year, and it it wonderful (as long as you are using really fresh, pungent spices, otherwise it could be bland) and it is practically foolproof. I say practically because the very first time I made it, It was a runny mess until I added extra flour. I never did figure out what went wrong that time, but I gave it another chance and I'm glad I did!! This is my life saver Christmas cookie recipe! Great tasting instant gratification all in one recipe!! From raw ingredients to fully baked cookies in about a 1/2 hour. You just can't beat it!! The icing is excellent as well.

This was a yummy gingerbread recipe. I made two adjustments - I made it with honey and upped the spices. It was good, and I especially loved the royal icing that went with it. I would prefer a chewier-cookie though, I rolled some out thicker, but the consistency was about the same. Good though for decorating.

Rating: 4
This is probably the best gingerbread cookie recpie on the whole site. Swap out the molasses for honey and add some orange zest and cardamom. I can't tell you how much easier this makes the dough to handle or how much better it tastes. I also tweak the seasonsings based on the group who will be eating them. I've also got some diabetic friends and made them some of the same using the Sugar Free Maple syrup from the Diabetic aisle in the supermarket instead. This leads me to think you could also make these using pancake syrup. I'm thinking that a good Butter Pecan flavor might be really tasty as well.

The taste of these cookies was there alright, however the texture wasn't. They were very cake like and didn't go over to well in my house hold. However I did leave the dough overnight in the fridge and I didn't add any icing...I may make the cookies again and not leave them in the fridge over night

I don't know what could have went wrong. I doubled the spices and still found these to be the blandest cookies I've ever tasted. Not at all sweet--still bland even with icing. Also, when I went to roll out the dough (yes, I was using all fresh ingredients) it was impossible to work with. It crumbled so completely that I couldn't form a cookie bigger than a quarter. I plopped it back in the bowl and added another egg. It came out rollable, but still, they tasted like nothing. Completely blah. And dry, even when I cooked them for less than the recommended 10 minutes. This was by far the most disappointing thing I've ever made, which is too bad because I was making them to serve for a party, and now I don't have time to make anything else. And especially disappointing in light of the other rave reviews. If anyone has any ideas, I'd love some advice.

This is the best gingerbread recipe I've found so far. The dough is very easy to work with, the taste is great, and the texture of the cookies is very nice. I will definitely use this recipe again for Christmas gingerbread people.

I found that the dough was runny and tended to stick to the work surface. Butter seems to ooze out of the dough. I decided to chill the dough and simply cut thin rounds to bake. The results were delicious with a dusting of icing sugar! I too increased the spices slightly (though not doubled) but I left out allspice. I am trying to figure what to do if I make this again and it's worth the effort considering how delicious they taste. Although the recipe only requires the pot to be removed from heat, would I actually need to cool the boiled molasses and butter mixture before adding flour? I live in the tropics so the mixture may not have cooled as fast it should and a cooled syrup is generally thicker than a hot one. Any advice would be appreciated.

I do a lot of baking and this is truly the easiest dough to work with. The cookies taste like a true gingerbread cookie. Cook a few minutes less for soft cookies, a few minutes more for crispy cookies. I will definitely make this part of my collection.

I made 200 cookies for a Cub Scout Christmas party, and this is the recipe I used. The dough was so easy to roll out, the best I've ever tried. I found that the batches I made with half butter and half crisco were easier when it came to rerolling and the taste was about the same. Also, I think they aren't quite sweet enough, so I added 2 T. granulated sugar. Once they're decorated with frosting, though, they'll be plenty sweet!

Rating: 3
This is an easy to work with gingerbread recipe and the kids love it! I made these for my daughter's 4th grade class and they were a big hit. The kids loved watching what happened to the mixture when the baking soda was added. The dough is easy to manipulate and doesn't stick to the cookie cutters. We have already made several batches this season and plan to make this part of our holiday tradition.

I substituted honey for the molasses and even converted some folks who told me "I don't normally like gingerbread". Nothing says Christmas like biting the head off a gingerbread man..... I also changed the spices. I used 2x the ginger and added cardamom and mace.

This dough is so easy to work with! It doesn't stick to the cookie cutters (must be the 2 sticks of butter) and rolls out so easily. The taste is wonderful. I love how the dough is ready to use without needing chilling. This will replace my old gingerbread cookie recipe!

I loved this recipe, I made 300-10" Gingerbread men for a fund raiser and the recipe was perfect each time. I did double my spices and loved the results. For the cooks who had problems with this recipe, this is just a thought but did you possibly use self rising instead of all purpose flour? And were your ingredients fresh? I used the old flour from my pantry and my first batch of cookies were less than wonderful. I replaced all of my ingredients with fresh and I had perfect results each time. I did use half butter and half crisco. This is a definate keeper recipe!

This is a great recipe! The cookies taste delicious and I was able to let my two year old help in the making of them. He added the baking soda and the butter and had a great time eating the finished product. I made the mistake, however, of trying to make a house out of this dough-- it's too soft. (I should have known it tasted too good to work as building material!) Does anyone know of a good gingerbread house dough recipe? Thank you!

Boy, did this deliver! As payback to our nextdoor neighbors for doing our driveway (they have a snowplow, we don't), we baked cookies with their kids to give them a few hours of peace & quiet. As previous reviews stated, this dough is fun to make, no chilling or resting required, and VERY forgiving! We halved the recipe, rolled out three times and made LOTS of cookies! Also, we found the cookies to be sweet enough, and very tasty (we used a little more spice than the recipe called for). Would (and will) definitely make this again.

I love the consistency of this dough. I made snowflake cutouts and decorated them with white decorator icing. But I think they look better than they taste, since I like a sweeter or chewier cookie. I'm sticking with the recipe the way it is because it's nice and easy to roll out and gave me no problems working with it (and I need all the help I can get) and the finished product looked so good. Overall, this is a great holiday cookie. Jessie

This recipe at first sounded a little confusing to me, as I've never made gingerbreads by this method. As it turns out, the recipe works great and is easy. My son added the soda, and said "Merry Christmas" as he threw it in. He thinks he can now do magic, and the cookies are VERY rapidly disappearing!

Rating: 4
This is the perfect recipe to make with small children. You don't have to wait for the butter to assume room temperature and you don't have to chill the dough before you roll it out. The dough was incredibly forgiving--kind of like working with playdough. And the end result is very tasty. We will be making this one regularly on dreary, cold winter days!

Although I am an experienced baker, this is the first time making gingerbread cookies. This is an excellent recipe and so easy! I followed the recipe exactly and the dough turned out wonderful. To avoid too crisp cookies, I didn't roll the dough out too thin. Now, if only someone could recommend a sugar cookie recipe that is this easy to work with!

This recipe was great! As many of the reviewers said below (and why I decided on this one of the many gingerbread recipes out there), the dough was easy to handle. This was my first year making gingerbread cookies with cookie cutters, so I wasn't sure quite what to expect, but I found it wasn't too hard to judge the thickness and I could reroll the dough a few times and then just rolled the leftovers into little button cookies. I did up the spices a bit because I wanted a more fragrant cookie, and they were really good. Decorating the cookies made a good project too for visiting guests to keep them busy in the kitchen but not underfoot!

Although I have not tried this recipe, but recipes incredibly similar, I just thought I'd share a tip. For those of you who prefer a softer cookie, by simply substituting half the butter for shortening, it won't turn out super hard. The flavor stays just the same, and you don't lose all the richness from the butter since you leave half of it in. (stays slightly crisp too) I've tested many, many gingerbread recipes and this is one tip I swear by!

OK get mad at me, I'm rating a revised version! I used Blanca's suggestions (1/2 maple syrup, 1/2 brown sugar, 1 tsp each allspice and cloves, and the zest of an orange). How can anyone named Blanca who runs a tea room be wrong? It's wonderful. The dough is incredible to work with; I finally got to use my antique cookie cutters with elaborate imprints! It's like playing with Play-Doh. I've always thought gingerbread should be just slightly crisp at the edges, but generally soft, and these are exactly like that.... just right in 10 minutes. Perhaps the too crisp folks are overbaking-there wasn't much visual change, even in the edges, to watch for. I just timed them. This is now my new gingerbread recipe!

Hmmm, not what I expected at all! As others have stated it was a lovely dough and very easy to work with. However, the finished cookie was a big disappointment - much too hard! I was expecting a crisp yet tender cookie, but these were like very hard ginger snaps. Guess I prefer a softer more chewy cookie, so I won't be making these again. Just scrolled down to read the comments about using a slice of bread to soften the cookies, so will give that a try and report back after Christmas re the results. Update 12/27: Well the bread did slightly soften the cookies, however they are still too hard for my liking although my sons loved them. And, no I did not overbake them!

This rocks!! Sorry, Martha-ite, you lose. These cookies were too easy, too tasty and just too much fun to make.

My auntie had a gingerbread recipe that followed the same premise and it also impressed people to no end.

OH WOW! These were fun to make (different process than any cookies I've ever made before), dough was SO EASY TO WORK WITH, and they are incredibly tasty.

Will make these every Christmas and will find excuses to make them throughout the year. Absolutely wonderful!

The best gingerbread cookies I've ever made! The dough was very easy to work with, and it was great not to have to refrigerate it. I was unable to find powdered egg whites for the icing, so I added a teaspoon of cornstarch to the recipe, and it worked just fine. this recipe will become a holiday classic!

Loved this recipe! We serve this in my Tea Room. I tweaked it a bit and replaced half the molasses with maple syrup and added the zest of a whole orange. Increased the allspice & cloves to a teaspoon. Easy and successful on our first try!! This is now my "heirloom" family recipe.

This is the best gingerbread recipe I have ever come across. It was lots of fun to make them too, like a science experiment with the baking soda (my 3rd grader son really liked this part!) and adding the butter. Dough was easy to work with and very pliable and like others have stated, no chilling time! This is my keeper recipe from now on!

this was a gorgeous cookie dough experience - my favorite ever! the dough was just the right texture to work with, rolled beautifully. And worked really well. Tasty too. Those who had problems... all i can thin is either the molasses mixture didn't cook long enough, or didn't cool enough for the flour to thicken it... because i went letter by letter with the recipe. This was a nice one - i might make a second batch right now! =)

These came out really well - very crisp and tasty. I also had to add extra flour though and had to refrigerate the dough to be able to roll it out properly. It was a lot of work and I was cursing molasses, which can be as messy to work with as chocolate, but the results were worth it.

This was absolutely amazing! My first attempt ever making gingerbread cookies and this was definitely the recipe to follow. The kids loved it as well as my co-workers.

Great dough to work with--though the flavor was a lott milder than gingerbread cookies I'm used to. My cookies were crisp, as well, but I liked them that way--much the way Christmas butter cookies are crisp. For the cook who needed an extra cup of flour--I can't imagine what might have gone wrong, but I used slightly less than the recipe called for, and even that might have been a little more than it needed. Maybe check to be sure that you used baking soda and not baking powder (this would make a *big* difference) and that the molasses mixture came to a full boil before it was added--certainly this is the heart of the dough. (And I think "labor-intensive" is a better description than "time-consuming." Because this dough didn't need to chill, I cut my total prep time in half, even though I spent more of it at the stove.)

To Erin from NJ: I'm not a professional baker but I do bake a lot and have made many breads. Many times I have made doughs that need a lot more flour than is called for in a recipe. I think how much one needs is variable as temperature and humidity can affect the dough. Just add as much as you need so the dough "feels" right.

I don't want to rate this recipe because based on my results, I clearly made a mistake somewhere, and it wouldn't be fair to comment on a recipe ruined by my inept baking skills. That being said, I ended up with a decent cookie, if not an accurate representation of what it was supposed to be. I had to add a WHOLE EXTRA CUP of flour to even get this beyond the batter stage and sort of resemble a dough. Did anyone else have this problem? If not, does anyone else know what I did wrong? Admittedly, I'm not a fabulous baker, but I've read the recipe over and over; I followed it exactly and can't figure out where I went astray?

Tasty and easy, if a little time-consuming. What takes the most time is slowly incorporating the ingredients in the saucepan. But I think this special technique is what makes these cookies so much better than other gingerbreads. Roll the dough pretty thin--they grow upwards a little bit in the oven.

Definetely the easiest gingerbread cookies to make. The dough is wonderful to work with - no chilling, it isn't dry, and it rolls easily. The cookies don't break, yet they have a very nice texture. I thought they weren't quite sweet enough, but with frosting and decorations they're perfect! I made a double batch and finished stirring/kneading in the stand mixer with the dough hook - too easy. Everyone loves them!

Finally, a gingerbread cookie everyone loves!! I've always had trouble with other recipes because the dough was difficult to work with and dried quickly...this one stays very pliable!

I just put away the last of a double batch and am very happy I decided to include these in this years' cookie baskets for teachers and friends. Last year I made sugar cookies and swore I'd never do cut outs again, but the recipe looked so easy I thought I'd give it another shot. My cutters are very large and this dough is perfect because it is so dense and forgiving. It rolled beautifully and the cookies were easy to transfer to the sheets. More importantly, they are delicious. Make sure to sneak a few bites of the raw dough!

I haven't made these yet, but wanted to respond to the post about softening the cookies- put them in an airtight container, and put a slice of bread in with them. i don't know why this works, but it does. Your cookies will soften and the bread will harden- It's magic!
