Wonderful. Try it with a side of Sea Turtle Soup.

WARNING: Not only does long-line fishing for swordfish result in the bycatch deaths of many endangered sea turtles, but the FDA has said that children and women of child-bearing age should not eat swordfish because they contain toxic levels of mercury. For more info, check out www.gotmercury.org.

Excellent! It's great without the sandwich!

The caponata and swordfish are a great combination.I skipped the lemon slices which did not sound appealing and I did not add extra rosemary to the caponata cuz my family isn't big on too much rosemary. An easy, quick and delicious sandwich!
