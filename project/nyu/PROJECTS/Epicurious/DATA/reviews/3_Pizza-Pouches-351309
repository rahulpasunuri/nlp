These were horrible, in my opinion. Would have been much better off using the pizza dough to make a pizza. They were hard to construct, made a mess and just didn't taste all that good. FWIW, all the ingredients I used were from Trader Joe's, so I don't think it was the ingredients. Also, my muffin tins make 6 muffins. Isn't that standard?

I want to try this recipe soon! It sounds like it is very versatile. However, I do have one question... When making ahead of time to freeze, do you freeze them before you bake them or after? Does it matter?

Simple & easily converted to a vegetarian snack/finger food/entertainment dish. I replaced the meatball with Boca crumbles and used my own preferred style of marinara style sauce, using italian herbs and some spices. I had zero leftovers and lots of requests for the recipe! When assembling them in the cupcake molds, don't be afraid to tack on some extra dough to any holes or thin spots that may appear, the dough all cooks and you'll never notice the reinforcement in the finished product. A pouch that leaks sauce and cooks into your pan, however, is an obvious mess you don't want to clean. They're affectionately called "Pizza Muffins" in our circle: "Hey, is your wife going to make those pizza muffins, again?" hahaha.

Hard to assemble and not great

I'm only giving this 3 forks because it isn't quite a "gourmet" meal. :) Overall, I love this recipe. Super easy to make and you can put anything you want inside the "pizza muffins" (as my boyfriend and I like to call them). I've done an assortment of green, red, yellow peppers with onions and chicken sausage; meatballs; pepperoni; plain cheese. All were great. They are also so easy to pack up and take for lunch the next day. I just put mine in a margarine container and stick them in the microwave for a couple of minutes. These hit the spot when it comes to my pizza cravings, and by using low fat and all natural ingredients, they turn out much healthier.

Made with leftover home-made meatballs and sauce. Kids definitely had fun putting them together. I think I would add some spinach or other veg next time. A fun-for-the-kids twist on pizza.

I walked my five year old through this last night and he was thrilled to make dinner, so we will probably do it again in some way. It was about like what you would expect---the sum of its parts. The one real problem with it was the dough:meatball ratio. Maybe the meatballs I used were smaller than what was expected. I think next time maybe we'll roll it up in some other way in order to maximize the number of meatballs that can be used.

These were okay. . .not great. They turned out sort of soggy, are not that healthy, and while I can understand this recipe being in a kid's magazine I don't think it belongs on Epicurious since this is not cooking, it's ASSEMBLING. Background story: my boyfriend's nine-year-old son has expressed an interest in cooking, so once a week it's his responsibility/privilege to pick out a dinner menu and help us prepare it. He loves everything pizza and so was excited about making these, but was a little dismayed when he found out that all of the components are supposed to come from a jar, can, or bag. We used our recipes for pizza dough, sauce, and meatballs and like I said, it was okay.

Trying to figure out if the meatballs are supposed to be frozen or not. Anybody know? Thanks!

So good and so easy. My 4 year old had a ball putting these together with me. I'll definitely be making these again.

I love these pizza pouches! I made them for superbowl and they were so simple and fun to eat!

My husband really liked these. I was able to get 8 pouches instead of the 6 so they weren't so dough. I used beef meatballs, ragu pizza sauce, and a mixed blend of cheeses.

This recipe gets and A+ from me! It was plenty tasty and the kids absolutely LOVED it! I think you easily make and freeze. Clearly it's a meal for kids, but even my husband and I enjoyed it.

This is a recipe I've used for awhile. My kids love this recipe. You can use meatballs, italian sausage or meatballs. A great kid friendly recipe.

This was a terrific recipe! I used pepperoni instead of meatball. Really, you can use whatever filling you want. Very quick and painless. My daughter loved helping me. Overall, a wonderful, yummy meal, perfect for kids.

I have not yet tried this, but was wondering how they would be if made with italian sausage and added a sprinkle of parmesian cheese and sliced mushrooms.

This is a great pizza alternative for kids. I made these for three 9 year old's and they now think I am the best chef ever. Simple, tasty and easy.

These were a lot of fun to make. I changed it up a little and went with mozzarella and a 4 cheese blend, a slice of pepperoni and meat balls from our Italian market. When putting them together I felt the meat balls would be too big so, I cut in half. I will leave it whole if I make them again. Lots of dough on top after it baked so; I would serve with extra sauce.

I have not made this yet, but wonder how this would work to make ahead and freeze. I will try this so I can pull them out of the freezer and bake when I need a really quick meal.
