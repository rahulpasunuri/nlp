This is Naan-sense. It's pizza, delicious pizza that my friends all enjoyed.

I just made the bread, without the salsa and onions. I added a clove of crushed garlic to mine and left it out for longer than two hours...maybe four because I was busy. Delicious...easy...maybe not authentic naan, but great nevertheless!

This is fun to make and I didn't have any disasters, but the bread has a sour aftertaste. The onions are a must and complement it very well. I followed the recipe and used a cast iron skillet to make them. They puffed up with the appropriate brown spots etc. Served as presented with the mango salsa and onions alongside tandoori chicken it's a fine meal for the family, but I'm going to try another naan recipe that includes yeast.

Loved this! Made it for bookclub and I received nice compliments. Next time, I'll probably try roasted garlic on top of the bread instead of onion. Mango salsa went nicely. Oh, and used nonfat plain yogurt -- worked great.

This bread was very good. The carmelized onion is key Be sure to knead for the full 10 min., heat the pan thoroughly (I used iron skillet) and brush pan with not too much oil or naan will be soggy.Also, if making with other food, make the bread ahead - I made at last minute and got rushed.

Made this minus the cheese and onions and it was good. Be sure to roll the dough out relatively thin. Accompanies curries really well.

I would say this is OK, but it is nothing like any naan I've ever had,more comparable to fry bread. Anyway, full disclosure, i'm no expert with dough, so maybe that has something to do with my results...kind of heavy. I liked the taste of the goat cheese though

Easy and fun to make! We omitted the topping with no regrets, although next time we will include it just for variety. Try it with this mango chutney: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/230708

We have made this bread with toppings (minus the salsa) several times now and it has been uniformly easy and delicious. Can't believe we can make this bread with flour, a little baking poweder, and goat cheese!

I made this bread without the goat cheese and without the onions (to accompany curry coconut chicken) - delicious. A keeper.

I love this "naan" - it is much better than the frozen stuff at the grocery store! I have made it with and without the goat cheese, and it always turns out great. I add extra yogurt when I leave out the goat cheese. I even use fat-free yogurt, and it is still great.

this is not a recipe for "naan." Naan is leavened bread made with yeast and baked in an oven. More importantly, a naan is repeatedly rolled out, sprinkled with oil or melted butter, folded over, then rolled out again, etc. to give it flaky, buttery layers. This is a recipe for "chapati" or "roti," another indian flatbread. it is a very good recipe for that. But not for naan. If you are looking for naan then this recipe won't make what you are looking for.

This naan was delicious. Easy to make too. Don't know if we'd go to the trouble of making the mango salsa as the naan was fabulous without it!

Love the naan recipe. Very easy to make ahead, then roll out and cook as needed. With the onions it made a distinctive side dish at dinner. Didn't try the mango salsa.

I'm not going to give a rating right now b/c I only made the naan to go with an Indian dinner. Naan turned out good, for being cooked in a pan. Used sour cream & milk instead of yogurt. No cheese. A tad more salt & baking powder. Recommend making them thinner & then they puff up nicely. Next time may use ghee instead of oil or in the summer cooking on the grill for more like tandori cooked naan.

I have made this dish several times now, with and without the toppings...it goes great with hummus, smoked eggplant, or any other dip. the kids even like it! It seems to be fool-proof.

I made it without the goat cheese or onions. Not only does it go well with Indian dishes, it makes a nice base to top with assorted ingredients for gourmet pizza.

This is very easy and very flexible. Did not find it dry at all. I've made it exactly as it says, and I have also modified with ingredients I had handy. Always turns out.

I made this two nights in a row, very simple & satisfying bread recipe. As previous reviewer, I thought it needed extra moisture & increased the amount of yogurt, made sure I didn't overmix & results were great. Next time we'll try grilling them.

I just made the naan to go with a main dish. I did not have goat cheese or yogurt, so I substituted with feta and light sour cream. I also used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of unbleached flour. The previous time I made the bread it was quite flat, so this time I doubled the baking powder. I also added a little milk to moisten. Instead of oil, I sprayed each side of uncooked bread with PAM. The bread was delicious. I kept it warm in foil and in a 200 degree oven. Have Fun!!!

I didn't make the salsa to go with the naan, but that's because the naan was bland to begin with. It was okay, but I'll look for a better recipe.

I make this without the onions or salsa and serve it instead with another recipe from this site, the Tandoori-spiced Chicken Breasts, and rice. We have papadoms and mango chutney on the side. It is my family's favorite meal - my dad requests it every time I'm home!

This bread was good. I served it (without the onions and extra cheese on top) with an Indian meal. It was easy to make and it tasted just as good reheated as out of the oven.

YUMMMM! I served this as an appetizer and then used the recipe again and made it more like an accompaniment to a curry based meal. Sooooo good!

My husband loved this combo. Albiet, due to in house ingredients available, some changes were made. The yogurt was part sour cream and the cheese was feta. As the mix was a little dry, I added about 1+1/2 Tbl. of milk. The naan was terrific. The 3+1/2 cups of onions cooked down to a small amount and I will use more onions the next time because they were good. On top, some jalapeno monterey jack complimented the last of the feta and the mango salsa was terrific on top. My husband would love to try this with some shrimp on top. We folded the naans in half to eat, rather than cutting them.

Excellent recipe and very easy! I halved it with no problem and used fat free plain yogurt. Next time I will try feta cheese instead of goat cheese for a different flavor.

This would probably be good even w/o the onion-goat cheese topping. The mango salsa is great, but served w/ the naan, all the flavors seem to be competing for attention, not complementing each other.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. A bit time-consuming, but definitely worth it. Great served with vegetables in a store-bought Indian simmer sauce.

Very easy to do - my husband loved the bread so much, he didn't want the rest of the dinner. Served it with the Tomato and Red Onion Chutney which contrasted very well with the Naan flavors.

Absolutely fabulous! I have served this several times and everyone has enjoyed it. The mango salsa goes great with porkchops, too!
