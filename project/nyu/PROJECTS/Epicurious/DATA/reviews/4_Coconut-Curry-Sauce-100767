I thought this was a bit lacking in flavor. Also was a bit heavy with all the cream and coconut milk and I am not one to shy away from heavy sauces generally. That said, my husband loved it and said it was one of the best dishes (paired with the sea bass recipe) I've made in a while!

Fantastic and very, very easy to prepare...your guests will LOVE this sauce. I also add a minced garlic clove during the initial simmering of the ingredients and finish the dish with chopped cilantro.

Followed the recipe as written and poured over rice. Served as suggested with the sake marinated sea bass, though I used halibut. Absolutely wonderful. Served to a small dinner party, and people loved it. Highly recommended.

Spectacular sauce - subtle and delicate. Did not have the problems of other reviews. Added fish sauce, strained, halved the curry paste.

Insanely good!!! I subbed sake for the white wine, and threw in about 1 Tbl of fish sauce, to take the edge off of the sweetness. Was perfect with the sake marinade, but equally amazing with just rice - this is a fabulous curry recipe!

I thought this sauce was really good, and I did not have trouble with it burning. I did reduce the amount of cream to 1/2 cup--could not imagine it needing 2 cups! I added a little more coconut milk (light) and only 1 t. of red curry was perfect for my family. Served w/sake marinated sea bass--delicious!

This isnt the greatest sauce by any means. The initial mixture will burn in the pan unless you simmer v--e--r--y slowly which defeats the purpose of the 6 minute thing. Pass this one and try another.

It's great paired with the Sake Marinated Fish. This curry sauce is very rich, as you've heard, and sweeter and pinker than traditional curry. I had to add 2 tbsp of flour to help thicken it.

Excellent. I omitted the dry white wine. I added scallions and Thai green and red peppers for more heat.

I made this to accompany the Sake-marinated sea bass also, as recommended. Needless to say, with two cups whipping cream and a can of coconut milk, it turned out to be lick-the-plate-clean delicious. However, this is one calorie splurge that's worth it.

Phooey, this recipe is great. I used fresh coconut instead of canned and added a little red Thai chili paste to "kick it up a notch" and it was awesome. Perhaps it just needs to be served with the right dish? Try the Saki Marinated Sea Bass (recommended to be served with this sauce) and you will NOT be disappointed. Cheers!

I was really hoping for something wonderful based on the other review. However, upon tasting this sauce as prepared it was flat compared to curry recipes I've tried before. I was able to save it by adding 2 cloves of crushed garlic, a dash of fish sauce , and some fresh basil leaves. Igot the idea for the other ingredients from my Roy's of Hawaii cookbook. Also, I would decrease the whipping cream and use more coconut milk. This recipe is a good base, I suppose but needs some help.

This is an excellent sauce! Easy to prepare and can be used with chicken, pork or fish. Five stars is an understatement.
