I did like this recipe and is better than others i have found, though I made some modifications. I ended up adding some fresh herbs (rosemary and thyme) to kick up the flavor. I mashed the mashed potato into grated before adding wet.

This recipe was flat and tasteless. I suppose the quality of potato plays a big part and I used fresh russets but alas; no flavor.

About the BUTTERMILK: After mixing the grated grated potato, flour, baking soda and salt into the mashed potatoes, you should very gradually mix in the buttermilk to create a texture like mashed potatoes. Then proceed with recipe as written. My review: This is really good with bacon and eggs on a weekend or Holiday. I especially like to use cob-smoked bacon. My husband loves it when I pamper him, so the extra effort is worth it. P.S. I guess typos can happen to anyone!

Are you supposed to add the milk to the batter as well? The recipe lists it as an ingredient, but it's not mentioned in any of the steps.
