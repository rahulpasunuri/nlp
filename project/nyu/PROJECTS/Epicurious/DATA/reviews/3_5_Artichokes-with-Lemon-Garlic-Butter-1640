My fiance and I LOVE artichokes. We usually dip the leaves and heart in mayo (I thought it was weird before I tried it...so deliecious!) I thought I would try this recipe for something special. I thought the lemon butter was WAY too lemony! I did not like it. I thought it seriously overpowered the artichoke. I went and got some mayo to finish my meal. My fiance liked the lemon butter, but he still preferred the mayo. If I make this recipe again, I will cut the lemon down at least in half.

@ A Cook from California--The more I thought about your statement, the more it made sense. We are incorrectly commenting and rating recipes based on our personal taste. Your comment, "...can be used as a starting point for coming up with your own ideas..." will serve as the basis of how I rate recipes in the future. Thank you!

Too buttery/oily for me. I decided to just steam them with the lemon and then I make a roasted garlic/mayonnaise/vidalia onon mustard sauce to serve with it which I mix the fresh thyme into.

Hello to everyone writing a review on any recipe. In order to cook you need to know what you like and dislike. Add more of what you like and less or none of what you dislike, it's as simple as that. Artichokes are not loved by everyone. This recipe has great tips and can be used as a starting point for coming up with your own ideas on different dips for artichokes. I will vary it every time I make it.

The lemon butter was absolutely delicious - more flavorful than any other accompaniment for steamed artichokes that I've ever had!

The garlic-butter sauce was awesome. The first couple of bites, I thought it was a little too lemony, but I actually liked it a lot. And, I threw a couple of lemon slices in the boiling water used to steam the artichokes, so it was very citrus-y. Delish.

My guests could not stop raving about the seasoned butter. I thought it wasn't the best artichoke recipe I've ever tasted, but it was certainly delicious.

Loved the recipe, very lovely and definatly a keeper. I do not agree with the past comments on to much lemon, the lemon is fabulous...and I would definatly keep using as much garlic, DO NOT CUT DOWN ON GARLIC, EVER! So So Good!!!!!!!!

If you love lemon & garlic, this is a wonderful recipe. Unlike the other reviews, I wouldn't change a thing in the dipping sauce recipe.

I give this two separate ratings: If I were to make this as written, I would not make it again. However, fortunately for me I've made a habit of reading the prior reviews and did not add the lemon juice until AFTER I had mixed everything else together. I had only juiced 1/4 cup of lemon, but ended up using only half of that (whatever that measurement would be), and I considered that still a little lemony for my taste. I give this a rating of at least a 3 if you scale back on the lemon. I'll be making it again tomorrow night with maybe a tablespoon of lemon juice. Mine took only 30 min to get fork tender. It was perfect down to the (and including) the stem.

i added about 3 Tbsp. of fresh finely minced dill, and loved it. Leftover sauce is great for dipping crusty breads, or with fish, or over steamed broccoli or asparagus.

Like some of the other cooks, I trimmed and scraped my artichokes then steamed for about 25 minutes. I also cut way back on the lemon. We love this delicious dip!

The following chef's were right, too much lemon. The lemon was so over-powering I ended up throwing this dish in the garbage, yuck!

Reducing the lemon is right on the mark. I filled the centers with a mix of diced hearts of palm, grated parmesan and this WONDERFUL Artichoke Antipasto I found at Trader Joe's stores--scrumptious!

I also hollowed out the artichoke (removed the inner leaves and scraped down to the heart). They steamed in about 30 minutes this way. I stuffed them with spaghetti squash and gargonzola cheese and then topped them with the sauce. I also greatly reduced the lemon and found the sauce to be quite tasty. My guests were so impressed. The hardest thing about this recipe is finding good looking artichokes.

Followed recipe, but used the juice from one Meyer lemon. This lemon has a sweeter juice and the lemon itself provides a substantial amount of juice for a lemon. Loved all of the garlic.

I agree with the comment below that they are a little lemony as stated. However, cut back on the lemon juice and they are wonderful.

It was EXCELLENT...I cleaned out as much of the choke as possible and it had cooked quicker..and was fork tender it is a DO AGAIN MEAL.

The classic way to eat artichokes. Absolutely delicious, but cut way back on the lemon juice recommended in this recipe. I would suggest adding lemon juice in small quantities till it suites your taste.

This recipe needs to hae alot less lemon juice but was a great dish. I followed one of the other reviews and ended up using 1/4 cup lemon juice and it still needed a bit less.

A little too lemony for my taste.

Just as I was thinking that this recipe was not all that great, my husband said "Wow, these artichokes are really good." Our family gives a mixed review!!!

I steamed my artichokes 35 minutes as suggested and the result was delicious and easy.

Rating: 3
This recipe is a winner. It is very easy to prepare and the dip is delicious. I would recommend cutting the steaming time down to 35-40 minutes to avoid overcooking the artichokes. All in all, a great recipe.
