This dessert has lovely flavors. At 5000ft, I had to cook it for about 10 mins less than indicated to avoid drying it out.

This is one of the BEST dessert recipes ever. I found it in Newsday many years ago and have made it repeatedly for family and friends. They all LOVE it. IT is absolutely delicious and even better, SO very simple to make. Even my mother in India, gets rave reviews when she makes this dessert. It is FABULOUS!!!!
