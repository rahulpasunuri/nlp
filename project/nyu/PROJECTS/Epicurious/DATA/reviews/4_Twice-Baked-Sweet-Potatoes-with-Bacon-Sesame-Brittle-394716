Very good but not as outstanding as I expected. First batch brittle over cooked...needs lite amount of coloration. Brittle not that necessary to the potatoe.

Made this recipe this past spring and am making today for Thanksgiving. Will definitely give a delicious, elegant element to our table; however I'm wondering why the miso? I used it the first time and perhaps my palate is not quite developed because I couldn't taste it. I may omit for today's meal and add the traditional sweet potato fillings, such as cinnamon and nutmeg. I'll keep the ginger as that is an autumn flavor--but if anyone out there can share why miso--perhaps it is to contrast the sweet, since it imparts a salty, savory flavor? Happy Thanksgiving fellow foodies!

OMG this brittle is amazing and I can see myself using it in different applications (garnish for mashed potatoes, salad, pancakes etc). I only gave this recipe 3 forks because I really don't think the brittle goes very well with the miso/ginger flavors. Too many different tastes going on which are not really complimentary. I love the sweet potato with the miso/ginger by itself though. And I would love a plain sweet potato with the brittle.

So far I have only tasted the brittle and it is totally addictive. If I don't stop nibbling there will be none for the finished dish.

Wow! Just Wow! These are excellent...the miso and ginger makes for a lovely combination. I didn't use the egg, didn't feel I needed it. Agree with other reviewers-don't overcook the bacon before going onto the brittle step...used center cut bacon, liked the thicker bits. The brittle, does cook quickly so watch it while cooking..the sugar in mine took a while to melt and then went very fast...not a typlical brittle with a clear syrup to hard crack, but it set to a crisp brittle perfectly...You have to try this!

These were really delicious--I probably added more ginger than called for, didn't really measure it. The brittle goes from not done to done really quickly. I agree with the first reviewer that the potatoes are great without brittle (but the brittle is fun!).

These sweet potatoes were amazing, and would be fabulous even without the brittle. The ginger and the miso paste ( which we found in the refrigerator section, by the tofu) gave added depths of flavor to one of our favorite tubers. Next time we make them, I would change how we made the brittle portion. I failed to note the instructions said to cook the bacon until just starting to crisp, and removed mine when it had fully cooked. Then it became overdone when I prepared the brittle. I would also cook the brittle for less time. The instructions said to cook until the color of milk chocolate, but the picture shows a finished product that is more caramel colored, so it might be better to cook it for a bit less. I am trusting that our next attempt will bring the brittle up to the four stars that the potatoes earned.
