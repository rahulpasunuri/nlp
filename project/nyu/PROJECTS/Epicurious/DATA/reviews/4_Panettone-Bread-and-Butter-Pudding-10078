This was my first bread pudding attempt. I thought it came out a bit soggy after 30 minutes in the oven so would cook five minutes longer next time. I also used rum instead of grappa, and didn't bother sauteeing it as the prunes soaked up the rum and no extra liquid remained (but maybe explains why it was soggy?). I'd tweak it a bit if I made it again, but it's definitely worth experimenting with because the panettone really works beautifully.

I made this recipe slightly adjusted to reduce the amount of lactose. It came out great using a combination of whole lactose free milk and goat's milk. Overall, I found it to be pretty good and easy. This was the first bread pudding I've ever made, but it wasn't the best that I've ever had.

this is a fabulous recipe! I simplified it by just cubing the toasted bread and folding it, as well as grappa-macerated raisins (instead of prunes) into the egg mixture. I also skipped the water bath. it still came out beautifully and deliciously.

I'm not a big fan of bread pudding, but this was fabulous. I used rum too (didn't have grappa), and a nice Easter pannetone with a lot of orange rind in it. It was an amazing Easter dessert, and very easy.

Wonderful recipe. The only change I made was to substitute rum for the grappa. It was delicious! If you like bread pudding - make sure and try this one.

I have made lots of bread puddings and I am quite picky about them. I have to say that this is one of the best recipes I have made! Perfect consistency and flavor.

This was really delicious. I substituted dried cherries for the prunes which, although expensive, was well worth it, and I served it with a homemade chestnut ice cream. This was even better the next day served cold, I couldn't keep my hands off it. A great way to use up that leftover Pannetone. Elegant comfort food at it's best. Be careful when toating the bread, it browns very quickly.
