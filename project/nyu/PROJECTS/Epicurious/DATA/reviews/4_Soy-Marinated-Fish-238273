Keeper. Will make again with fresh ginger (used ground ginger spice), green onion (brown onion was too slow to cook through), and star anise (didn't have any). Can't wait to try it cooled down. Rockfish had smooth texture but held together beautifully. Entire family voted to include it (it shows so much promise) on my menu for upcoming dinner contest with 6 families on large ski vacation together! cool temp will play very well as appetizer or even main. Have one month to perfect.

We had this in Shanghai October of 2010. They call it smoked fish. It is usually carp, which is hard to find in the states. I tried it with cod and it didn't work well. Hake and Pollack are not so easy to find either. I'll try it with tilapia because it is a firm fish like carp and easy to find.

Super easy. Made with hake and served over soba noodles at room temp.

Excellent! Used code,and as other reviewer, it fell apart. Served it for main meal. Very tasty!

I've made this several times. It turned out the best with orange roughy....cod sort of fell apart. I love the flavors. Haven't served it as a cold appetizer yet. Instead I've let it cool down a bit and served over rice for an entree. I love it.
