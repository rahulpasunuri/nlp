Made it. Tasted it. Tried to fix it. Let is sit for several hours. Tasted again. Threw down garbage disposal. Maybe I didn't do it justice. Used a little cayenne as didn't have red pepper flakes and doubled clam juice as no open white wine. Tried "doctoring" with more pepper, lemon juice, more spices, a little mayo. Strange taste would not go away.
