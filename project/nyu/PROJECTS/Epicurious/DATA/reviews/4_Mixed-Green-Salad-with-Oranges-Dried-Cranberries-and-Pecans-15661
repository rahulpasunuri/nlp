I made this salad for a work/holiday potluck. It was perfect! I doubled the recipe and it was the first thing to be devoured. A nice change to all the starchy, rich holiday traditional foods. I made everything the day before, brought all the ingredients separately, and tossed them together in my large wooden salad bowl just before serving.

I definitely used the soaking juice and mixed it in the dressing because I was afraid it wasn't going to be enough. I had left over dressing but I was glad I mixed the extra juice. I also added halved strawberries when I plated the salad and it made it more vibrant in color and it was oh! so delicious.

Easy to do and a great fall salad. I used clementines as suggested by someone else and pecan pieces instead of pecan halves because I like the texture better when paired with baby greens. I also used a Spicy baby greens mix which added some extra punch.

Best salad I've ever made! I did as another reviewer had and used the sweet and spicy pecan recipe from this website. I also added crumbled ricotta salata cheese. I also did as other reviewers and used the soaking liquid. I wlll be repeating this salad often.

Very nice salad. I would use the juice the cranberry's were in next time. Winter is very boring so this is a nice change. Would def. make again.

Thanks to the reviewer from Wisconsin who suggested boiling down the soaking orange juice to the 3 TB needed for the recipe. I think it really helped to make the dressing. I used a recipe from this site for sweet and spicy pecans rather than just the toasted pecans. Great salad which I will make again soon.

This has become a go-to in my winter salad line up. Subtle, refreshing flavors and pretty on the plate. Works well with Mac and Two-Cheeses (also on this site) as a nice winter lunch. Also was the perfect accompaniment to a hearty beef burgundy served for a Sunday dinner party.

I made this salad for guests tonight, and they all loved it. They asked for the recipe and plan to make it themselves. I used Seasoned Rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar because that's what I had onhand. Seasoned Rice vinegar is sweeter, but it didn't detract from the flavor and may have enhanced it.

I really liked this salad for a couple of reasons. It looked beautiful when it was served and it was very refreshing. I've had other salads off of this site that I have enjoyed even more and that is why I only gave it 3 forks. I will make it again, though, and soon!

I thought this was pretty good but not outstanding. If possible I would give it two and one half forks. The dressing was superb. Next time I wouldn't soak the cranberries as long; I think the overall texture of the salad would improve if the cranberries were a bit chewier.

I made this for Christmas and then again tonight. For Christmas, I boiled the orange juice and soaked dried tart cherries instead of cranberries, but the orange juice took the tartness away, so I didn't bother to soak the dried fruit this time and used the cranberries instead of the cherries. It worked better - chewier, tarter. I also borrowed a friend's microplane and that worked great for the zest. I was worried about the zest being overwhelming (I usually hate zest in food - so unpleasantly chewy and bitter), but the dressing was, both times, quite mild and pleasant. I used some chardonnay vinegar I got from a Michigan winery and it was lovely. I bought candied pecans from Trader Joe's so I wouldn't have to bother with toasting pecans (plus I love candied pecans!). The first time I made this salad, I mixed the dressing, orange slices, and the cherries together, but it is hard to dress the salad properly with all the large hunks of stuff getting in the way. So this time I only put the cranberries in, but then realized they might soak up all the liquid and leave me with little dressing (as I hadn't plumped them up with the orange juice soaking step), so I fished them out again. I used a boxed baby greens mix (Newman's) for the salad, then threw on the cranberries, then dressed it, then put on the orange slices and pecans. It looked lovely and tasted very bright and pleasant. If you only have to mess with getting zest and carving out slices of orange, the salad is pretty simple.

This salad is spectacular with a few simple changes. I definately agree with suggestion to reduce orange juice used for soaking cranberries to about 2 or 3 Tbl and add to dressing.

I don't cook often, but was asked to bring a salad for thanksgiving dinner - this was an absolute hit! I went with the suggestion of boiling down the orange juice. We had it after the main course, before dessert. It worked well this way with the light citrus flavour working as a palate cleanser.

Used Champagne vinegar. Used the peel from clementine tangerines and used segments from them. Used the orange juice from the cranberry soaking for the dressing. Kept cranberries separate from the dressing; tossed orange segments with dressing before topping salad; same with the cranberries. Topped with crumbled Gorgonzola cheese.

I have made this salad twice for holiday get-togethers and both times everyone has loved it without exception.

I think this is a great recipe to modify to your own liking. Mom and I weren't big fans of the orange dressing. Thought the orange zest was overwhelming.

It was delicious.

Great salad for a holiday gathering - it went very fast at mine, with raves. I used a total of 1-1/2 cups OJ and definately saved the "soaking juice" for the dressing.

As others noted: keep the cranberries out of the dressing and top them on the salad with the nuts and clementines.

This is a great salad where you can prepare all the ingredients ahead of time and quickly assemble when guests arrive. I used the canned mandarin oranges since good oranges weren't available. The fresh orange juice I bought was a bit on the tart side, so I also added a bit of sugar to the dressing as some suggested and it worked great. Salt and pepper are a must too. It is a light tasting salad recipe that I will use again.

Wow! I loved this prepared just as described! It's a beautiful, savory and delicious salad. A cautionary note: some of my family aren't crazy about fruit, nuts and greens mixed together and they were not as enthusiastic as I am.

To remedy this, I brought the juice just to a boil and added 2 tablespoons of Arrowroot.( corn starch could be used but arrowroot makes a clear glaze type sauce). Also to sweeten to taste I added two droppers of stevia and one pkt of sweet and low. The dressing was more palatable and more to my liking for thickness. Increasing the amount of dried cranberries and using mandarine oranges makes a very attractive dressing. This recipe makes a very pretty salad when the dressing is served over mixed greens.

I made this salad for the first time last Christmas, and it was a huge hit. I've made it several times since then (couldn't wait for another holiday!), and the best variation I've tried so far is one where I "candied" the pecans. I roasted them in the oven with honey and melted butter, then tossed them in granulated sugar. Incredible!

Seems like the perennial Holiday salad. Try adding mild goat cheese for extra flavor and texture.

This is a great salad. I used orange pepper instead of the oranges because I didn't have any. I made it for a fondue party and have been asked to make it again for another event. The dressing is great.

This is an excellent recipe. As suggested in one of the reviews, I added sliced grilled chicken (marinated in the dressing with a little extra pepper) and it was a huge success. The presentation is lovely and all of my guests, including one who confessed to generally hating fruit in salads, raved.

This salad was a big hit. My husband, who isn't even a big "salad person", loved it and has even requested it again. He suggested adding marinated sliced grilled chicken for a main dish...maybe I'll give it a try! I omitted the orange peel...I used mandarin oranges and forgot to get an orange for the peel. I made the dressing the night before and put it together last minute. Very easy and yummy!

I loved this salad and so did every one of my guests on Christmas Eve. Beautiful to look at as well as eat! Wonderful combination of flavors between the oranges, cranberries and pecans. A perfect holiday salad recipe to pass on to friends and to keep in my file.

Excellent salad! The toasted pecans were so flavorful. Everyone loved it for Christmas Dinner. Had to make copies of the recipie! I chopped the cranberries fine because all I could find were quite large and plump.

This was THE BEST salad I have had in a long time. Since it was for a Christmas party, I substituted tangerines and fresh tangerine juice for the oranges and orange juice. It was so good, even the little kids loved it and asked for more!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and then again to take to a Christmas party. Everyone loved it and thought it was beautiful, too. I had several requests for the recipe. I did change the dressing a bit, I added straight orange juice concentrate rather than making the diluted juice. I also sugared my pecans with a little cinnamon. One more thing, I used canned mandarins which worked fine. It was delicious!

I made this for a Holiday Neighborhood Progressive Dinner. The hostess (who made a great beef tenderloin) said this salad was her favorite thing on the table! I cheated and used the bagged baby greens salad--quick and still delicious! Will definitely make for Christmas dinner!

Fantastic! Served it at Thanksgiving and it was loved and applauded by all. I, too, could've used one less orange though.

This was a delicious addition to our Thanksgiving menu. I used clementines, now in season, & easy to peel, and tossed all ingredients in large salad bowl.

This was great last year at Thanksgiving. I changed it a bit by using Sun Dried Cherries instead of Cranberries. Outstanding!!!!
