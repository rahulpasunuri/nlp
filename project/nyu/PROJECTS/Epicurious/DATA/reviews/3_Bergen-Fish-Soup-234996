I disagree with Blandinas. We made this without the fish dumplings (sorry Andreas), but with fresh cod, monkfish, a few shrimp and a few small clams, and it was terrific. And two days later, when we had it again, it was even better!

the soup is too much vinegary and nobody liked it. The Fish Dumplings were impossible to keep together and dissolved in the water. Definitely a NO-NO recipe.
