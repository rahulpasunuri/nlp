Agree that nothing you can do to a cantaloupe beats the taste of the fresh, sweet fruit at its peak of ripeness. But sometimes you get a melon that's not sweet or flavorful, and no one will eat it. This is the recipe you want for those times. The amount of sugar depends on the sweetness of the melon. Lime juice can sub for lemon. Lemon or lime zest can be added, as can fresh ginger, whole clove or stick cinnamon. Use your imagination. Just don't toss out a the fresh cantaloupe!

Not a bad recipe, just nothing to write home about. For my part, eating regular sliced cantaloupe would have been far more satisfying.

Raisins, as grown and dried in this country are far sweeter than the European variety. Used in this dish, they are sufficient sweetening. Omit the sugar and I'll make it again

I haven't prepared the recipe yet, but it sounds delicious, and should be good to drizzle on top of ice-cream or vanilla blancmange. I don't think there is an excess of sugar considering the the fact that the recipe is to be divided between 6-8 portions.
