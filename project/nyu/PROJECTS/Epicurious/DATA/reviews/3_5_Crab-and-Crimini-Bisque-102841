Not good. Too rich, too bland, and the combination of crab and mushroom was just too much.

This as very disappointing. While using half the mushrooms, double the crab and additional garlic, the overall taste was very bland. With some modification, could possibly make a passable mushroom bisque.

seems like a lot of steps, etc.. but most of them don't need much work, so you can do other things whilst liquid evaporating, etc... and wow, delicious! I took didn't seperate the solids, just put in the blender and instead of heavy cream i added about 1/4 cup of 1/2 and 1/2... might try without the cream all together next time and it is full of flavor and with blending the stems, etc i think the creamy texture will already be there.

There are a few steps, but well worth it. I think next time I will put a bound of Crab vs. a half pound. I also used and extra 2 tablespoons when I sautéed the mushroom caps. No other changes needed.

I only made a half batch and it was just enough for two first-course servings. Next time, I'll probably make a double batch 'cause it was so good. I added extra garlic and also used fresh thyme in the soup base. I used cooking sherry from the pantry and didn't feel like it was noticeable. Most importantly, just omit the crab; it's an afterthought anyway and doesn't belong--the mushrooms are the star.

This is one of the best soups in my collection. Perfect for any occasion, especially a special dinner party. Everyone raves about it each time I make it!

I boiled the crab shells in the broth for about 1 hour. This added more crab flavor to the broth. I also used Madeira instead of Sherry, and everyone loved this soup! It turned out amazing.

I usually hate it when people review a recipe and say they loved it but changed it a lot. Well I was drawn to this recipe because I love crab and mushrooms. But after looking at some other crab bisque recipes felt it needed to be tweaked. I followed all the ingredients of the recipe but added a tablespoon of tomatoe paste and instead of straining the mixture and discarding the solid I put the mixture in the blender. I also added some thyme. Also my mushrooms didn't have long stems so I put about 1/2 of the mushrooms in the first soup mixture and only used 4 or 5 for the garnish. I loved the result.

After reading earlier reviews, I chose the mildest white mushrooms and just used half. After adding a bit more sherry and a teaspoon of cognac at the end, we had a fairly tasty mushroom bisque with crab bits. There was no hint of seafood taste. Not surprising in retrospect. Chicken stock plus mushrooms doesn't make crab bisque.

This recipe is fine, however I do think after making it that I would just stick to either just Mushroom bisque or Crab bisque and not combine them....definantly not company quality, it does not "wow" the palate.

Used half shittake and half baby bella mushrooms. The soup is very rich and delicious - only problem, after a bowl of it, most of the guests didn't eat much of the main course. I think that it would be better as a soup main course. We'll definitely have this again.

I really liked this recipe. It was a little time consuming and I could not get crimini mushrooms so I just used Monteray mushrooms. It was like a very rich cream of mushroom soup. I did half the recipe and it made a nice appetizer.

My husband and I loved this! Instead of using fresh crimini mushrooms, I reconstituted .5 oz of porcini mushrooms in 3/4 c. white wine for 20 minutes and then sauted this (drained mushrooms) with the garlic and onion. I eliminated the step of sauting the mushroom caps. It made the whole process go faster. I will defininetly make this again, and for guests!

This was very good, had sudstituted portobello mushrooms and it gave a pleasant flavor to the stock. My family and guests enjoyed this too, there was no leftovers.

I used portabella mushrooms and white wine. Next time I would use less crab - it was too chunky. I would make this receipe again.

I used fresh dungeness crab and home made chicken stock. Lovely soup. I think next time I'll try using shitake or porcini mushrooms and add a little pepper sherry for some zip.

I thought this soup has some potential. It seems to lack the richness I expected. I did to add more cream to it. It was ok, not sure if I would make it again.

Way better than bisque recipes requiring 2 cups of cream. Excellent flavor and texture.

Made this for a dinner party last night, everyone loved it. I added white wine and used fresh crab.

I agree that the mushrooms tend to overpower the bisque and also a little pricey.I was not overly impressed. I will not make this again.

I thought it was ok but not great. Very rich. The crabmeat is also pricey and I just didn't think it was worth it in time and cost.

I've made this bisque 4 times and each time my guest have requested the recipe. It put me in the gourmet catagory. Thank you!

I made this with fresh crab my friends had caught. I couldn't find Crimini mushrooms so used button and it tasted wonderful! I plan on making this again!

We enjoyed this recipe but I cut down on the amount of mushrooms - using 12 ounces instead of 16 ounces and increased the amount of crab - because that is our favorite part. Recipe yield is too small in my opinion for 4 main courses - but would work great as four starter courses or as 1 part of a soup and salad dinner combo.

I found this recipe to be very average. The mushrooms overpowered the crab, and I found it to be a little salty. If I did make it again, I would only serve as a first course.

This recipe is awesome. I agree with the first reviewer though - it doesn't make a whole lot and it's a little pricey. I love crab, BUT I think this recipe would be wonderful without it, too (and a lot less expensive). I used half and half instead of heavy cream which fat-wise doesn't make a huge difference, but it's something, especially since this recipe calls for almost a stick of butter as well. Try this recipe out. It is definitely worth it.

This bisque was so yummy, perfect for a cold winter night! My guests all loved it but the recipe only makes enough for 4 people when served as a first course. I also added extra crab meat since that is the best part!
