All of that waiting pays off in this humble dish. I used organic white grits and I thought that it was the perfect texture in the end. Visit http://joleneeatshere.blogspot.com for pics and details

VERY GOOD! Didn't use the olive oil. Tasted after cooked and it was GREAT! Since I was using it as a base for "Sauteed Swiss Chard w onions" (this site) I added ~1/3 c grated parm and a little extra water. What a combination! Oh, I used grits, which I always use for polenta. Not too sure what the diff is, other than grits are treated with lye??

I have made this dish about 10 times and every time we flip over it. This is the easiest polenta and the best polenta I have ever eaten. I have tried many others and nothing stacks up to this one.

Perfect way of cooking polenta. Added some freshly grated parmigiano and cooked about an hour and a half, adding water so it wouldn't dry out. Easily halved for two people.

Perfect!

I love this recipe, so much better than the roll kind in the grocery store. A little butter and seasoned salt and cheese if you like, are just the finishing touches. We eat it hot first and then spread the rest on a cookie sheet and cool and cut for the next day to brown in butter!

Finally, someone who makes polenta the way it should be done. It really takes 45 mins...not 15! This recipe is basic and perfect. Take it from a Polentona.
