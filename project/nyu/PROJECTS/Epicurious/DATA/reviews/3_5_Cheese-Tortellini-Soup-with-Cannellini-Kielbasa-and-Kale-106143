I've been making this recipes for years. Absolutely love it! I make the recipe just as written with no substitutions. Whenever I make it, people ask for the recipe and it is a family favorite. Just like most soups, it is even more flavorful the following day. Keep in mind that kale and tortellini will be soggy/softer if eaten later.

Rating: 3
Really love this soup recipe. I find it needs more broth than called for and needs to be eaten the first night as the kale will wilt & get soggy when re-heated. I will try next time to cook just enough kale to eat that night and add the rest when re-heated. Great flavor and hearty!

I made it with spinach and turkey kielbasa. I would have given it 4 stars but I found it a little too garlicky and spicy. Maybe it was the turkey kielbasa. I will try it again cutting down the garlic and red pepper.

I've made this soup for a couple of years now and love it. I prefer spicy andouille instead of kielbasa and it definitely adds a nice kick. I've used tortellini and gnocchi as well. I add two cans of beans to make it more of a stew. This is definitely a keeper!

Quick, easy & delicious. I used leftover tortellini (some cheese & some mushroom filled) and it worked perfectly.

Delightful. I omitted the fennel bulb and used more beans and onion instead. I also used spinach tortellini as that was what was on hand. Will make again and again.

This is one of those meals that the whole family loves - especially in the winter when fennel and kale are locally available. We make a veg version with veg stock and veg keibalsa and is delic!

This was very good. Next time will brown the sausage first, will stick to said cooking time (I let it sit a while and all veggies got reallllly soft), and will prob skip the beans - didn't think they added too much. Also I substituted escarole for kale, which was fine, but will try kale next time around. will def be making again, though!

Delicious! A friend made it last week and I loved it. I made it today and made minor changes. I used chicken andouille sausage and added some Spanish hot paprika to add a smokier flavor. Also used more beans than recipe calls for. A perfect winter night's meal!

I've made this soup since it first came out--sub with Chaurice sausage (a local creole product), swiss chard (since husband doesn't like kale ). Use large italian butter beans so he can avoid eating the beans and homemade chix/veg stock or whatever I have on hand.

Delicious. Exchanged fresh spinach for kale and used fresh, cooked kielbasa (yummy brown bits only added to the flavor and visual appeal). Tortellini got lost with all the other ingredients so will leave out to lower calories the next time.

I made this from the magazine when it first came out...loved it then, love it now. This is my go-to soup for everything....sick friends, busy night and it's in the crock pot, pot- luck party, book club lunch with friends. Sadly, for me, I've given it to everyone and they all have the recipe....and I have to search for something else. Great flavor, fun texture. Thanks!

I make a ton of soup and this one frequently gets requested. I don't eat pasta, so I leave that out, and I often use turkey kielbasa. But the way the textures (sausage, kale, beans) and flavors (sausage, red pepper, fennel) come together is fantastic!

Rating: 4
The ultimate comfort soup. My mother always used to make me this in the cold of winter, or the rainy days of fall. Now I make it for my family when ever it gets a bit chilly out. It has a great combination of flavors and textures. I tend to use a little less red pepper, as we're not a huge fan of spicy, but if you don't mind a little bite, use it all.

I entertain for a variety of friends, neighbors and family and "inlaws". I wish I could serve this soup every time I entertain.

If you are undecided as to what to make for guests, don't be, just make this wonderful soup.

This has to be one of our favorite soups! I do not like kale, and I adore this soup. I don't add the tortellini and I use some Hungarian hot paprika paste for kick. I make vats at a time and it freezes beautifully.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it turned out very good. This soup has a rather hearty flavor, for not being that heavy. Aesthetically, it is a beautiful soup to serve. For me, the Thyme flavor was a bit strong, so I will add less next time. I did as another reviewer suggested and only added the tortellini to the portion we were eating(between my husband and I, we ate this three nights.) Didn't need the extra parmesan at the table. Very easy to make.

Oh and if you ask what seasoning? Good grief...Marsala! White Wine! A boullion cube, more garlic, reduce it a little more before you add the kale... Oh, and if you really want to add some more healthy wonderment toss in a small handful of Turmeric! Another wonder drug. A liver detoxifier, a brain enhancer, a cancer preventer AND a lovely color additive with a barely noticeable taste, so why not? This recipe should be made a mandatory prescription for a multitude of ailments :-) Mangiamo!

Here is another tack...I have digestive issues...pretty profound. I cannot process raw, but need certain veg's cooked gently, not to mush. I require dark greens (kale, duh!), I use turkey keilbasa (easy sub), I need beans, but must be soft and hot. Chicken broth is so gentle on my system and the addition of fennel soothes the system, and has had that reputation for centuries! The pasta is filling and makes it a rounded full meal. This recipe is the ultimate IBSD perfect combo food. On every level. It makes me feel better. Easy as that! Oh and to those who did not find the flavor...add more seasoning!

Normally it is not 47 degrees outside in Los Angeles in the winter around Christmas. When it it is it's time to make this soup. Shred some cheese on top of it as a garnish.

Rating: 3
My boyfriend and I have dubbed this "The Christmas Soup," partly because we made it the day after Christmas and partly because we had just seen "The Tale of Desperaux." As far as soups go, it was pretty good, but it didn't knock my socks off. I only used half of the kielbasa (I thought that was enough), and because I knew there would be leftovers, I decided to reserve half of the tortellini and cook them when I warmed up the soup next time, rather then let them sit in the soup in the fridge and get yucky. If I made it again I would probably add another can of cannellini beans.

Tasty!! My mom first made this for me while i was still in college and now that i'm on my own, i make it and freeze some for meals later. I could not find fennel, used red kidney beans and turkey sausage. Never added the grated cheese and still vgood. Very tasty - great for winter months!!

This tastes amazing if you make it without the cheese and tortellini, let it sit in the fridge overnight so that the broth absorbs some of the keilbasa flavor, then reheat the next day, adding the cheese and tortellini. Mmmm

I have made this recipe for a few years, always to rave reviews, I have always used turkey sausage to appease my health conscious husband, Well last week I used kielbasa, and the praise went even higher! It's very important to use a great tasting broth, the best is swanson's low salt chicken broth, sometimes I mix it with the organic chicken broth they're both good, Happy Cooking!

This is fantastic! I used a bit more garlic, crushed red pepper, kielbasa and tortellini than called for in the orginal recipe. I also added a splash of Spicy Pepper Sherry which really gave it a smooth kick. If you do not plan to serve the entire pot of soup, I recommend that you put what you are planning to serve in a smaller pot, and add the uncooked tortellini - that way you never overcook the pasta with continued reheating. Serve with asiago infused garlic bread. A meal all by itself. Had rave reviews from my guests.

I don't particularly like kale so was searching for a way to use a big bag that was given to me by a friend from his garden. This soup is deliciously hearty, the broth turns out rich and golden. Plus it was super easy, started at 5 and served it within the hour. Carrots add nice flavor, color and an extra veg.

I'm not going to rate this recipe because I made so many substitutions: fresh polish sausage, 6 c. chix, 1 c. water, 1/2 c. pinot grigio, spinach and rigatoni. Also, I had parmesan rinds in the freezer that I tossed in. I could easily see adapting this for a vegetarian or low fat diet. Just a great base for a bistro type bean and pasta soup. Yum!

When I first made this recipe four years ago, I loved the ease of preparation as well as the final results. Now, with a husband and toddler, I find myself turning to this delicious soup more often as a quick meal. I follow the recipe exactly and only keep the tortellini on the side (my husband likes low-carb foods) and let people add them as they like. Remember to use low-sodium broth or stock- I made that mistake once! The kale and fennel are really wonderful, and it is the only way my daughter will eat leafy greens. Try this soup- it is wonderful!

This soup had a lot of good ingredients, but the flavors never really came together as anything more than those ingredients in a bowl with some broth. Followed pretty much exactly, but added in some butternut squash. Good, but nothing special.

Quite good. Followed recipe exactly except that I used turkey kielbasa to cut down on fat content. Next time I might reduce amount of kielbasa a bit as flavor was a tad overwhelming. Tasted just as good the next day; I was concerned that tortellini might become soggy but they didn't. Would be a great meal for a houseful of kids.

So good and so easy, it doesn't seem right! Quality ingredients make all the difference. Made it first with all natural turkey kielbasa and it was awesome.

Will definitely stick with the good stuff and keep this one around for a long time!

This is my favorite go-to casual entertaining recipe. This delicious soup, a simple salad and crusty sourdough is an easy, hearty and still elegant in presentation meal.

I made this recipe last night and my husband and I just loved it. I also found it salty, however I did use regular chicken broth but will use low salt broth next time. Just noticed I forgot to add the dried crushed red pepper but certainly did not miss anything in the flavour. This was the first time I have cooked with fennel bulb (known as Anise in this part of Canada)and kale. This recipe is definitely perfect winter comfort food. I will definitely make it again and have shared the soup and recipe with a friend.

This recipe has been a staple since the first time I made. Literally every person I've made it for has asked for the recipe - it's fantastic! I did subsitute spinach for kale and scallions for fennel. I also usually add a little extra red pepper flakes for a kick. I recommend this to anyone.

Wow, so good! I've never had fennel or kale before, so I wasn't sure if I'd like it. But all the flavors blended together perfectly and I'm glad I didn't make any substitutions. The kielbasa is really the predominant flavor so make sure you get a good one.

Rating: 4
Just a few suggestions to those disappointed with this soup. Try browning the kielbasa before adding the onion, fennel and garlic. I also don't usually add the full 10 c of chicken broth either, more like 8. One of our favorites. As someone else mentioned - it is about the only way my 4 yr old eats kale.

Delicious! My only complaint was that it was too salty - but my fault for not using low-salt broth. I made the recipe exactly as written except used 16 oz. of tortellini instead of 8 oz. (since my husband loves tortellini). We've been enjoying the leftovers for two days. Definitely a keeper.

Ok, I changed this up but liked it. No kale or fennel (couldn't find fennel! Darn store) Instead added chinese lettuce at kale stage, a sliced carrot , some broccoli added at same time as the tortellini and a bit of green pepper. Otherwise stuck with recipe though I scaled ingredients to match 8 cups of chicken broth so there wouldn't be so much leftover soup. Quick and tasty!

I love this soup! Made it last Friday night and have been eating leftovers since then. Just had some for lunch at work today and it was fabulous! It's a great winter soup and I plan to make it again and again. I deviated from the recipe a little bit - used shell shaped pasta instead of tortellini and used dried thyme instead of fresh. I also had some leftover wild rice that I stirred into the soup. I actually prefer it with the rice than the pasta (but will add to soup as I serve it) and next time will add more broth. Also, I don't plan to use fennel again since I couldn't really taste it. Kale made the soup though! Will add carrots (and maybe celery) next time. Give this recipe a try!

I've been making this soup (with slight variations) for years now. I've never added fennel (but I'll try that next time), and I use pastini instead of tortellini pasta. Also, I always use Hillshire Farms "hot links" for the meat part. It's real spicy. I agree with others who say the kale is a crucial addition. This soup recipe is a real find!

This is a wonderful soup recipe. I had to use spinach, because there was no kale at my supermarket. I added it at the last minute and it was fine. I will add another can of beans next time, other than that... I look forward to next time! This soup was even good leftover. Tortellinis and spinach were both still good.

With cooler weather finally here in Austin, I've been making lots of stew & soup meals, and this one has been my family's favorite so far this year. I made these changes, which all turned out great: sub'd 1 lb fresh, spicy, turkey, italian sausage from the deli, casings removed, rolled into tiny (milkdud- sized) meatballs, browned in advance and added to pot after veggies are wilted; added 1 tsp of smoked paprika, since sausage wasn't smoked; increased broth to 2 boxes (12 cups), kale to 1 whole bunch, and beans to 2 cans (undrained). This gave us plenty of leftover soup, so I scooped out the pasta & stored it separately (to prevent soggy tortellini), to be added back to each bowl before re-heating & serving. Five days later, we are still loving this soup!

Rating: 3
This soup was very good. I couldn't find Kielbasa so I just used hot pork sausage and this gave it quite a kick.

Rating: 4
A really good recipe, and easy to play with (skim the reviews!). First off, forget that you don't like anise. Fennel doesn't make food taste like licorice (at least, not cooked fennel). I used the whole bulb and the whole bunch of kale because I hate to waste food, and what are you going to do with the rest of it? I used turkey kielbasa, as often suggested, because I refuse to eat pork (if curious, look up HFA.org). One other variation: being almost out of red pepper flakes, I used hot Hungarian paprika. Very nice.

I used bacon instead of sausage, and added quite a bit of parmesan cheese during the cooking process, and it turned out really nicely.

I also always love a dish that can be prepared in one dish!

I followed the recipe the first time and loved it. The second time I used some braising greens from the farmers market that included kale and that added another dimension. Good and easy!

A good, hearty soup that I made with some changes. I substituted chicken basil sausage for the kielbasa and used proscuitto-cheese stuffed borsellini rather than tortellini (they're similar). I would definitely use the entire fennel bulb next time (with a larger chop on both it and the onions) and add at least one more can of cannellini beans. Because I used a less salty/fatty sausage I needed to add salt and pepper also. Otherwise, it's excellent with a rustic loaf of bread and a crisp white wine.

I have made this several times, with a few changes. I dislike fennel, so I omit it, and I substitute a North Woods smoked rosemary chicken sausage for the kielbasa. My kids like it, and I usually make some wheat bread to go with it.

Rating: 4
I'm not usually a big soup fan and my husband isn't crazy about kale, but this looked good so I tried it. We both loved it! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and sauteed the kale along with the onion and fennel bulb so it didn't taste quite as bitter. It's filling enough to be a complete meal with a slice of crusty bread. We'll make it again and again!

Rating: 4
This is peasant food.....at its best. Add a whole chopped fennel bulb and a whole (turkey) keilbasa. Make sure you pile on the asiago cheese as it adds depth to the broth. I used half vegetable broth and half chicken broth. You don't even need to add salt and pepper. It's a keeper. I can't begin to imagine how someone would call this 'hot dog soup'.

This "soup" is a great one dish meal. I will make this again and again. Will double the recipe next time so there is some left over.

A person would really have to LOVE kielbasa to like this soup. The kielbasa flavor really takes over. I agree with a previous review that this tastes like hot dog soup. I would possibly make this soup again using a different kind of sausage.

My family HATED this soup. After all the good reviews, I thought it would be a huge hit. We ended up dumping most of it. I thought the kids would at least pick out the tortellini, but nobody went for it. East to make, which is a plus, but I wouldn't make it again.

I am confused by all of the accolades this dish has recieved. I think it is terribly underwhelming, the broth is just one-dimentional and too spicy, even when you cut the amount of red pepper, and I like spicy foods. It needs an element of sweetness or something more gentle to make it work. I'm busy trying to achieve a balance now. Would not make it again.

This is a wonderful, quick, and delicious weeknight dinner (along with some asiagio cheese bread!). Fresh fennel makes all the difference. I've made this 3 times now, once with spinach. Although it was good, the kale is the way to go! I also used the turkey kielbasa...less greasy. Make this...you won't be disappointed!

This soup had very nice flavor. I did make a mistake that I should warn others not to! I put the kale in my food processor which 1) made a mess, 2)made the soup a unattractive and 3) don't smile at others when you're done eating it for shredded kale doesn't go well in the teeth. I did add shredded carrot which was nice. Make sure to follow the instructions and you will have a nice soup.

This soup is excellent on a cold winter night, and relatively easy and quick. I wouldn't change a thing.

In the past month, I've made this dish twice. Absolutely delicious. I substituted both chorizo and andouille sausage for the kielbasa. And I cooked the tortellini separately and combined it with the rest just before serving. The red pepper flakes give it charge. My three-year old daughter thought it was a bit too spicy (she did eat the tortellini) but my 17-month old thought it was grand (okay, she did pick out some of the kale.)

Wonderful soup! My 4-year-old keeps asking for it. (Best way to get her to eat her greens!) I made the soup up to adding the tortelini, then split it in half- froze half, then added the tortellini when I reheated that half. The kale lost some texture but it worked fine.

Outstanding. I've made it more than once. Definitely brown the kielbasa before adding remaining ingredients. Cooked the tortellini separately and was fortunate to find jalepeno cheese tortellini which added lots of zest. Added beans and cooked tortellini at the same time, then kale for last five minutes.

I made this for my husband who does not eat green or beans, hoping the kielbasa and tortellini would win him over -- and it did! When cooked as instructed it had a very "canned" taste from the beans and stock (I used low salt). But I let it sit on the stove cooling and each bowl that I ladeled out during the day was better and better. I kept the tortellini separate, as suggested. For me: I would add a second can of beans. I really liked the beans -- everything else was great.

This soup was good, easy to make, and it tasted delicious. The left overs were even better than the first night of soup. I'll definitely make it again. I made this recipe to use up some kale in the refrig and threw in some left-over cooked butternut squash, which made a nice addition in both color and flavor.

This soup was delicious! And it was SO easy. The only change I made was to add only half of the fennel because I don't really like the anise flavor. But it still came through- and to my surprise, I acutaly liked the way it blended with all the other flavors. I will definitely make this again when I need a quick, hearty soup recipe.

Great soup but you have to use homemade stock. With a crock pot it's a snap so there's no excuses. Like many others, we were wary of the fennel (don't like the anise flavor) but used it anyway and thought it added a nice crunch and good flavor. More kielbasa next time and go for the good tortellini, ours turned out underdone.

This soup was excellent and came out with the right amount of heat or spiciness I was looking for. I made the tortellini on the side and kept it stored separately in a plastic container until I planned on serving the soup - as to avoid the pasta turning to mush by sitting in the broth over an extended period of time. Highly recommend for a good, satisfying soup.

Rating: 3
Made this last night enjoyed it today for lunch. I defintely did not opt for the low-fat version as I used nice, spicy, chourico. Also, skipped the fennel and instead of tortellni-which I did have on hand-I decided to substitute potatoes. Small dice toward the end. Turned off the heat and the potatoes cooked just right! This recipe is great for the ease of preparation alone!

1st time I made this I didn't have fennel bulb so I substituted some chopped celery and fennel seeds - 2nd time I made w/fennel bulb. Both times it turned out GREAT - doesn't keep well though as pasta gets mushy...if making ahead, cook pasta separately and add at last minute to heat through. I used turkey sausage and Pam instead of oil.

Definitely a comfort food! I opted for more of a Southern style flavor and used Andouille sausage. Excellent!

WONDERFUL!!!! We LOVE this soup! We rarely repeat recipes within six months of each other, because we are somewhat adventurous and easily bored. We did this again, though, after only two weeks, it was such a rich and complex-tasting comfort food!Also with a few minor changes: misted the pan instead of using all the oil, used turkey kielbasa, had no fennel bulb on hand so I used crushed fennel seed, and had no kale so I used spinach). We didn't miss the fat, and the end result was an incredibly satisfying, surprisingly easy soup to nestle up with on a cold day. Huge fans!

What a beautiful soup. It has great ingredients, and is a cinch to make. Maybe that is my problem. If it is too easy, it can't be good, can it? Anyway, I found it mediocre, and probably would not make again. Not quite my cup of soup.

It is fun to read the reviews and see who has good cooking instincts as opposed to those who just read and slavishly follow the recipe. Of course you should brown the sausage first! I am surprised that the test kitchen of Bon Appetit did not catch this, especially since it was the cover recipe.

Rating: 1
Just the ingredients will tell you it is in the super hearty , stick to your ribs category, even beyond New England Clam Chowder. I substituted Smithfield Ham Sausage instead of kielbasa, thinking it would be less fat and less spicy. Unfortunately it was too smoky (the company added extra smoke). Just used the tortellini, (couldn't find the cannellini I knew I had in the cupbord somewhere) which I felt was enough for lunch. The inclusion of kale was great, loved the texture. It seemed better, mellower reheated a few days later. It is definately a hearty soup. My son loved it.

I loved this! As did my health-nut husband.I also used Turkey sausage-a spicy blend and I doubled the kale, beans and garlic. I even sent some to my Dad who was a chef and he thought it was outrageous-especially the next day. Making this a once a week dinner-with a loaf of crusty semolina.

Actually I rate this 3 1/2 forks. I never tried fennel before but when I chopped it up for the recipe, the smell made me think I wouldn't like it so much. I still used it but not quite the amount called for. I was pleasantly surprised! The strong fennel flavor cooked out and mixed with the broth and red pepper for a nice zing! (It was not too hot either - just right.) As for the kale, I was suspicious. But, it cooked way down! Kale is awesome for you too, so I felt really good serving this to my family. I didn't find this soup fatty as others have said. Definitely an excellent soup - and though I used cheese tortellini, I could see how pumpkin would be very nice with this not your run-o-the-mill soup. Serve for special guests too!

Great, easy recipe. I put more kale in mine than it called for. The sausage was good, but not browned enough for me. I suggest sauteeing it a little longer than the recipe calls for. Overall, great, filling, and the best when served in wide, shallow bowls!

My husband, who is neither a soup aficionado nor an eater of leftovers, raved over this soup when I served it to him, and of his own volition, reheated it for dinner again the next night (so much for saving it for my lunch!). The flavors are really nice, it is filling and satisfying, and very easy to prepare. I used turkey kielbasa which I sauteed first on its own. Served with a salad of greens and grapefruit and some fresh bread.

Excellent and easy to make. I come from a family of hunters and was attracted to the soup because I could use venison ring bologna. The soup ended up very salty and was very careful to use low sodium broth. Next time I will use a kielbasa.

Very good and easy to make. I made it with turkey kielbasa and we really enjoyed it. The flavor was incredible; the ingredients really worked well together. Next time, I would cook the kielbasa first for a few minutes before adding the vegetables. I used cheese tortellini, next time I'll use something with more flavor.

Followed the recipe exactly except used Bruce Aidell's Sun-dried Tomato Chicken Sausage which was terrific. One suggestion: if you know all the soup isn't going to get eaten immediately, you might want to try to portion out the tortellini and save it to add when you reheat it. Filled pastas just don't do well siting around in broth!

I have four teenagers...they are my ultimate taste-testers. They all loved this soup, and I was somewhat surprised. When they saw the fennel bulb and kale on the kitchen counter, they all moaned and rolled their eyes. But they are "willing" participants ("Oh yeah? Well, if you don't eat this, have a bowl of cereal!") and they tentatively had a taste, then ended up finishing up every last bit of it. Their suggestions ranged from..."more chunky onions" to "how about some potatoes?" I think both are valid ideas. I might add another can of beans next time, mainly to stretch the amount. I had some very good chicken stock available, which I believe can make or break a soup...so don't skimp on good quality stock. I'm keeping this recipe...very quick, filling, and if it makes four teenagers happy...it's a success!

I made some changes to accomidate the tastes of my family. I used fresh Italian sausage instead of the kielbasa, and since the sausage has fennel seads, I did not use fresh fennel.

Wonderful, quick, delicious soup. I used celery in place of the fennel, and brocolli rabe in place of the kale. Both worked well. You can vary the recipe each time by using different sausages, greens and a variety of tortellini. A real keeper. May even be better as leftovers if you have any.

Used turkey kielbasa, which eliminated the greasiness others complained about.

We made this for a crowd over the weekend and it was a huge hit! I used beef kielbasa and following the advice of other users, cooked it in a separate skillet first. I was glad that I did, as it rendered a suprising amount of fat. I then finished browning it along with the other vegetables in my soup pot. I also supplemented the chicken broth with whatever stock I had in the freezer (probably 2:1, broth to stock). The soup had a wonderful, rich taste and will definitely become a family favorite.

I really enjoyed this soup as well. I'd probably give it 3 1/2 forks, but I'll round up this time. I also used turkey keilbasa which definitely cuts down on the fattiness/heaviness.

Actually, I would give it three and a half forks... This was such a hearty and delicious soup! I made a few changes: I omitted the fennel because I don't like it, used turkey kielbasa (which is not fatty at all, by the way...) and used fresh chicken and herb tortellini. Yum!

Rating: 4
This is a simple yet rewarding soup! Next time I make it, however, I'll be sure to brown the kielbasa on it's own - before the onion/fennel mixture... it needed a little more doneness. And to those critics who feel the soup is too 'fatty' - live a little! It's tough to have a low-fat soup with Kielbasa in its name. Mmmmm... sausage.

Rating: 4
This soup was incredible! It's hard to beleive that anything cooked so quickly could have such deep, rich flavor. I used beef kielbasa (because I prefer the flavor) and ommited the olive oil, figuring the sausage would provide enough fat to saute in (which it did), and I did't think the soup was greasy at all. We've made it twice already, and everyone who's tried it thinks it's one of the best soups they've ever had.

I found the soup to be a little greasy. If I were to make again, I'd brown the kielbasa by itself first, removing from pan and blotting off excess grease. I'd save a little fat to saute the onions, then add the kielbasa back to the pot with the cannellini and kale.

I really enjoyed this soup. Make sure you buy nice tortellini - i.e. tender pasta texture, good filling. I bought mine at a local pasta shop. This made a great apres-ski dinner. I did everything except add the kale and cannelini beans before my guests arrived and then completed the recipe just before dinner. This is a definite keeper just as is.
