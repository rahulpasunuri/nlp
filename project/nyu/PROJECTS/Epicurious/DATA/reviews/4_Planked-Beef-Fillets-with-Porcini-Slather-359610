Add me to the list of people who thought this was terrific...with modifications. I cut the sugar back to 1 tablespoon and the red pepper to 1/4 teaspoon. On my first attempt I added wood chips to the fire but I felt the smoky taste overwhelmed the slather and the cedar plank. My second try was with bone-in pork chops that were too large to fit on the cedar plank. I brined the pork chips in 1/4 cup dark brown sugar, seared them on one side and then moved them off the charcoal, added the slather and baked them until the internal temperature was 145 (about 15 minutes). I didn't use the cedar plank because they were too large to fit. The result was perfection. Very juicy with just the right combination of spices.

This slather is amazing, but the other reviewers are right, it is too sweet and too salty for the amount of porcini. So cut back a bit on those ingredients, and keep the porcini and the planking. So even though this reviewer seems to take exception to most of the recipe, I have given it 4 forks so that it will get a better overall rating, and more people will find out about this way to have a marvelous steak.

this was amazing....i'm not a huge beef fan but went food shopping on a saturday afternoon and looked up epicurious.com for a beef dish and selected this one. it was so easy to make and DELICIOUS...my husband and 10 year old loved it...made side dish of shallot and mixed mushroom saute along with corn and it was perfect....will definately make again and again and again.

I will second what the first reviewer had to say regarding the abundance of pepper and red pepper flakes. I LOVE heat, but the proportions called for here will overwhelm a mild flavored fillet any day. I found the same to be true for the sugar. Half as much would be more than enough. Thankfully I tasted this slather before ruining three perfect fillets. But despite these negative comments, I do feel the recipe is on to something here. It just needs a lighter hand..IMHO. I would wager that with some proper tweaking this could become a 5-Fork recipe.

I gave this a four forks rating because this recipe has great potential....but ya gotta cut back on the pepper - either the course ground or the red pepper flakes, or both. I'm not afraid of spicy hot, but this really distracted from the other, very interesting flavors. The smokiness of "planking" the fillet was very good....the porcini mushrooms added an intricate nuttiness and the sugar added a hint of barbecue sauce. Unfortunately, the pepper really overwhelmed the total picture. I look forward to trying this again with just some simple adjustments.
