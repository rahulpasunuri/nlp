Great flavors together, very easy to put together. I used mussels instead of clams and cut the garlic in half.

guess i prefer heavy-handed, but i added the pesto to the original clam cook (deleted the extra garlic). added the tomatoes later and we all sopped up evry last bit.

Found the dish to be too heavy-handed, not a winning combination of flavors.
