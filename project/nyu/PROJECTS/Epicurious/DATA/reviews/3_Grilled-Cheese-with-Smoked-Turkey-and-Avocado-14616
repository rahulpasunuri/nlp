I thought this was good, but a bit heavier than I'd expected (I think it was all the cheese). I'd make it again, but for dinner, not lunch, next time.

I used smoked Gouda cheese and wheat bread (it was all I had available), and the recipe turned ou magnificent. I recommend trying to use equal portions of the main ingredients (turkey, cheese, and avocado) -- a tasty balance!

I've made this twice -- once when the recipe appeared in Gourmet and again this weekend. It's fabulous, although definitely not for the calorie conscious. I like it better with sourdough than pumpernickel; I also want to accompnay it with a simple tomato and avocado salad that uses up the rest of the avocado. Next time I think I'll also experiment with some different mustards ...

Good lunch fare. Can't wait to try it with sliced Thanksgiving leftover turkey.

This recipe has everything I love....cheese, turkey, dijon mustard and avocado, so it's no surprise that it turned out great. It makes a nice Summer lunch with a tall glass of iced tea. I'm going to make it for my husband...it's definitely a keeper! Oh,....it's easy, too. Took 10 minutes.
