I don't understand why this made one reviewer sick. I have never eaten anything that has made me "vomit for days". I took the advise of the other cooks and spruced it up a bit, that is why I only gave it 3 forks. I'm curious though, did anyone else experience gas from this? That was my main complaint. I'm not used to tofu and am trying to modify my diet to a healthier one. I fixed this for my girlfriend and myself just before going to a movie. At first, I thought it was the popped corn that was giving me gas, but my girlfriend seemed to have the same problem. It started out quiet, but then grew to enormous perportions. I noticed a little sqeak of a fart coming from my girlfriend and then from myself. After a while, we were both bombing each other and those in the theater with full blown elephant roar farts. I suppose that I should buy some beano for the next time, or serve it when I'm going to be in the woods camping...not hunting.

betcha his tofu was bad. anyhow, good cooking is often about modifying ideas to make it personal - i think this recipe is just fine if you tinker with it a bit. using broth, other herbs (i personlly like the flavour of oregano with corn) and whatever else. relax people, the recipe is not meant to offend.

Tofu does not taste like cream. It made this soup too watery. I didn't vomit unlike a previous reviewer, it was too bland.

After reading the ingredients for this recipe I had to wonder- WHERE"S THE REST OF THE INGREDIENTS??????????? I gave it 2 forks because I added a few ingredients- Onions, garlic, peppers, potatoes, mushrooms, and did not use as much water as the recipe called for. I really think it's good and can't imagine how one could get sick from it (unless they forgot to actually COOK the soup-- LOL).

Why didn't I read the reviews before making this recipe? While I think that the one reviewer who got sick was rather melodramatic, I was not impressed with the end result. After simmering the corn and adding the tofu, the soup was watery and bland. I tried simmering the soup to thicken it up and the tofu/corn/water combination separated to a yucky consistency. I wouldn't recommend this recipe, but if you were compelled to make it for some reason, I would follow the suggestons to add onions, garlic or peppers and I would use less liquid!

Though I will not make this recipe because of several cooks' opinions and the rather unlikely combination of ingredients, one wonders that perhaps the eight cocktails that preceeded the one cook's experience with the recipe might have had some affect on the "days of vomiting". I personally have not experienced any discomfort with any of the ingredients independently. :)

Hmmm, we Canadians must be hardier souls, and much easier to please, than those who tried this recipe. Ms Marakesh should see a physician if the simple combination of tofu, water, corn and basil made her vomit for days. Our family really liked it -- in fact, it has become a family regular. Having said that, I rated the recipe a "2" because I enhanced it a bit. I added onions sauteed in a little butter, some red pepper seasoning, and cooked several sprigs of basil along with the broth. After blending the broth/corn/tofu mix, I added a couple of chopped (previously steamed) potatoes. Delicious!

After reading the reviews, I won't make this recipe. I wonder why Marrakesch, Morrocco made it? Hope she/he recovered OK.

Blech! Something about the tofu really did not complement this recipe. Even after dressing it up with roasted chilies and red peppers, this was not an appealing dish. Go for the full-fat cream-intensive versions of a corn chowder.

Boring - boring. As a vegetarian, I realize the benefits of tofu -- but a real chowder benefits only from cream! I tried to spruce up this recipe - but in the end my suggestion is to use a different one!
