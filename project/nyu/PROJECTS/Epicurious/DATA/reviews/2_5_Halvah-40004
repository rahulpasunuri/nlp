The original Persian Halva recipe is: Brown the flour in pan until golden brown. Then add oil to form it into a paste. In a pot make water/sugar syrup (1 cup ea) and add saffron (a pinch), rose water (few drops). When flour is ready, add the syrup mixture and mix until Halva is departing from the side of the pan.

halvah can be made of different ingredients. for example my absolute favourite is made of peanuts, it's far much better than these that are made of sesame seeds.
