This was a great accompaniment to the sweet potato and shrimp cakes. Quick dish, little dish with a big flavor.

Fantastic. I made this for 15 people - easy if you have a Cuisinart. Many of them keep asking for it again! I added it to baby leaf to be served as a large warm salad. Big hit.

I made this last night to accompany pork medallions in mustard-cream sauce (from this site). I thought I had red onions, but didn't.. so, just used yellow onion. It was good! We liked it. I also sliced everything by hand & it didn't take long! I'll definitely make this again.

This was tasty. I couldn't decide if this was a vegetable or a sald - so it served as both. Good deal.

I served this recipe with a pork roast and we enjoyed it a lot. I don't have a food processor, so I cut everything by hand and it was not hard. Just don't forget to stir in the pecans before serving. This step was omitted from directions.
