Can't say enough good things about this - I had some local pastured, mother's-milk veal shanks and decided to make this instead of osso buco. A good decision. My 16-year old granddaughter kept going back for seconds, thirds, and, then, the last serving....I thought I"d made enough for my husband to take for lunch but it didn't get that far. We'll definitely make it again -

This is the best veal shank recipe I've ever tried. I'd looked at it several times before, but somehow I was put off by the addition of beans. But wow, what a wonderful combination of flavors and textures. I improvised at bit, based on prior reviewer suggestions. I didn't have Italian stewed tomatoes, so I used diced tomatoes and added basil, oregano, rosemary, and sage--probably 1 1/2 teaspoons total. I also dredged and browned the veal before adding the wet ingredients. I think the most significant change I made was cutting back the red pepper flakes to only 1/4 teaspoon, because that really changed the heat index of the dish. I'm not a total wimp when it comes to heat, but I can't imagine liking this as much as I did with the full teaspoon. I felt the heat at the back of my mouth with every bite. I used all beef broth and I cut back on the total liquid--reduced by 1/2 cup of wine and 1/2 of broth. And I used red wine. I thought there was plenty of gravy and the flour thickened it just enough. I served over garlic mashed potatoes with an orange and red onion green salad with orange mustard vinaigrette. The light cool green salad was the perfect counterpoint to the heavy rich stew. I just finished a serving of leftovers, and it was even better second time around. It would be a great do ahead dish for company, and I will definitely make it for some friends sometime soon.

Delicious! Didn't want to spend the money on veal so used beef stew meat instead (dredged and browned then braised in 350 oven for 2.5 hours). Followed the recipe, but used a Cotes du Rhone and mixed chicken and beef broth, as recommended. I found the recipe slightly acidic, so make sure to use a good quality balsamic and a wine that isn't tannic. Served with grilled polenta and spinach salad. Basil a great touch.

I am not a stew fan But I would absolutely make this again. My house smelled fantastic and it was delicious! I dont eat veal so I had restaurant pre-cooked pork shanks which was perfect so it didnt need to cook for hrs. I dipped the shanks in a mixture of flour salt and pepper then browned them on all sides to get a little more flavor followed the recipe as is added the shanks when it was time and simmered for 2 hrs&. so good&

This recipie is definitely one that I will add to my list of favorites to be repeated! The flavors of the carmelized balsamic onions paired with the sauce and fresh basil is simply wonderful. I cut the amount of red pepper flakes in half to reduce the heat to our taste and next time would add more white beans. I served it with some sauteed leeks and rainbow chard. Make sure to serve with some crusty bread to soak up the sauce!

My husband and I prepared this dish two days ahead of our dinner party. As with most stews, it only improved with time. We thought the four shanks looked like too little, so we bought six. As wisely suggested, we dredged the veal in seasoned flour and browned it in olive oil. Instead of white wine, we used red, and instead of two cups of chicken stock, we added one of chicken and one of beef stock, also as previously suggested (all very good advice!). When the stew was reheating, we noticed something missing in the flavour and finally came to the realization that it needed a little honey to balance the tartness of the balsamic and the wine...it was perfect! We poured it over crusty baked mashed potatoes and served very garlicky green beans on the side...so glad we made six...now we have leftovers!!

For considerations of cost, I used 2-inch cubed beef chuck instead of veal shanks. I followed the cook from BC's advice to dredge the meat in flour then brown it in olive oil, and to use a combination of chicken and beef stock. This may be a big departure from the original recipe, but the sauce and the onions were lovely and the beans were a surprisingly nice addition. Alas, no leftovers.

One of the all time best Bon Apetitit recipes. Absolutely perfect combination of flavors. My husband and I agree this is our all-time favorite veal recipe. Used 2.5 lbs of veal and doubled the tomatoes. We thought we would eat it twice. Wrong. It's so good we each had two helpings!!

The cook from British Columbia is RIGHT ON! Use red wine, dredge & brown the meat, and do deglaze with mixed stock. Reaaly, really exceptional! You can make in the morning , defat and reheat for dinner. We will make this one over and over!

Just made this again for the 3rd or 4th time, with some modifications that, I think, make it "perfect". Reduce sugar to 2 tsps., use red instead of white wine (improves taste, plus gives carmelized onions a gorgeous color). Dredge shanks in seasoned flour and brown in olive oil in the pan onions have cooked in. Deglaze pan using 1 cup EACH chicken and beef broth instead of 2 cups chicken broth, the canned tomatoes, and 1 cup red wine, then follow recipe. If time permits, cover and cool overnight; at serving time reheat on lowish heat after skimming off fat, and when hot, add beans, cook til they are warmed, then add basil. This time I served it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, steamed green beans, and warm pita bread with tzatziki - simply to die for on a cold winter night!!

Like the other cook from SW Fla, I too have tried the similar recipe found in Cooking Light, and it is awesome! I used beef, instead of veal and loved it.

I haven't made THIS particular recipe, but I got one from the Nov. issue of "COOKING LIGHT", that is magnificent!!!! It's pretty much the same. Use about 1 cup vertically sliced onions, for every 10 oz. veal shank. I dredge my shanks in flour spiced w/ salt & fresh ground pepper, then brown. I then hold them off to the side & cook the onions w/ the wine, thyme, sugar, pepper etc... It gives a nice thickness, and gives good flavor to the onions. I cook the veal for at least 1&1/2 hrs. at a simmer, and add mini penne pasta(uncooked) towards the end- then add the beans to soak up the flavor. The Balsamic vinegar adds a GREAT TASTE!! This is my 2nd time making it, and it's GONE very quickly!!!

I've made this recipe before, but today decided to add a few potatoes, a bay leaf and portabello mushrooms. The house smells wonderful and it tastes superb.

This would have received a better review if it hadn't been so sweet! Next time I will drastically reduce the sugar! My husband loved it but we both agree, it was too sweet!

This recipe is so flavorful that my husband is disappointed if I suggest trying a different Veal Shank recipe for a change. We have made this at least 3 or 4 times over the past few years and never tire of it.
