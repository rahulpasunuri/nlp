Even with the suggested alterations, this marinade is worthless. I had high expectations, but it would have had more flavor if I had just sprinkled Nature's Seasons on it. A complete waste of time.

Simple and easy. Yes, there is an acid ingredient missing! We use basalmic vinegar mixed with the oil. Also just throw a few fresh rosemary sprigs in zip lock bag and mash garlic with the salt. Yummy and easy. We make extra steak to use for next day sandwiches. :)

I added about 1 cup soy sauce as suggested and it was great! My kids and husband loved it. It was even better the next day. I marinated it for about 2 hours and then I broiled it. I haven't tried the recipe without the soy sauce, so I don't know if that would have worked for us. I'm wondering if this recipe does have a mistake in it re: no soy sauce?

This recipe will not work because there is no acid in the marinade (e.g., vinegar, soy sauce, etc.). Flank steak requires an acidic marinade to break down its fibers.

The recipe is missing the 1 cup of soy sauce. Add the soy sauce and it is awesome!

I would highly recommend the "Grilled Flank Steak with Rosemary" Recipe from the Sept '95 Bon Appetit. It is great. This one seems to be missing some key ingredients.

Easy to do. I used food processor to make a finer marinade with the oil/rosemary/garlic. Marinated for four hours. I used salt subsitute as well. Delicious and easy... doesn't get much better than this.

Sadly this recipe was a complete flop. When I grilling it I thought that it was going to turn out alright. It had none of the rosemary or garlic flavours. I really don't think that I would make it again. Usually I pick good recipes from gourmet, there is a much better recipe : Teriyaki Coriander Flank Steak.

We liked this recipe. To bring out the flavor I minced the garlic and rosemary into a paste and then added the olive oil. After marinating the steak for about an hour the flavor of the steak was very well developed.

I'm not sure why some called this recipe flavorless. I used a very rich extra virgin olive oil, and rosemary from my garden (I'm sure that it was more than the recommended amount. MAKE SURE THE GARLIC IS FRESH!!!! If the garlic used isn't fresh then the whole thing is for naught. I copied and gave the recipe to 4 of the party goers.

I agree with the cook from Kenmore, WA. This recipe is flavorless and I let it marinade for almost 24 hours. It might need some salt during the marinating period. I find that using an envelope of McCormack's meat marinade is much tastier. I tried this because I wanted to do something different but it was disappointing.

Delicious and very easy to make. I marinated for half an hour, definitely would marinate overnight next time. Served with blue cheese mashed potatoes, a great combination!

In response to "A Cook from Kenmore, Wa" on 7/9/00, Get off your high-horse. If your recipe is THAT much more superior, than enlighten all of us with your wisdom, and share it. This recipe is simple and good. I can gaurantee you are NO Charlie Trotter.

In response to the cook from Denver, WHAT "soy sauce"? There wasn't a drop of it in the recipe, so you must be confused. Otherwise it was OK, but not special. My own recipe is much better.

Agree with previous comment, rosemary and garlic make great companions. I let this marinade 24 hrsand used round steak not exactly tender but juicy with lots of flavor.

This is a nice, easy recipe. I marinated the steak in a zip-lock bag for about three hours and it the flavor was a little light. Next time I think I'll marinate it overnight for a stronger taste. Otherwise the meat came out tender and juicy. This is a definite keeper.

This recipe is now a standard with me. Excellent for those nights when you want something quick, easy and delicious.

I reduced the soy sauce by 1/4 cup because I don't like salty things and due to the high altitude I had to grill it longer (10 min. for medium rare) Will definitely make again. It was excellent!

This was a simple and delicious dish to make and no one beleived that I ran in from work and threw it together!!! It received rave reviews from the guests! I will definitely make it again.

I marinated for 10 hours and the flavor was still too light for my taste. I also thought there should be more liquid (maybe a full cup of the oil??) for 4 steaks.

Good and amazingly easy. It is nice to have a recipe for which I always have the ingredients on hand.

I didn't have any garlic when I went to make this, but had shallots, so I substituted. It had a different but also good flavor.

I used Angus striploins instead of flank,and fresh rosemary. This recipe left me convinced that rosemary and garlic are beef's best friends. Simple and delicious.

The marinade is very good but let the marinade work for 24 hours. It is very light in flavor otherwise.

Really good flavor and quite easy to prepare. Works with dried rosemary as well.

For something so simple, it was quite tasty. Would definately do again!
