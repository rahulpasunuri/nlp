Easy, fast and tasty, needing simple, at-hand ingredients. It will proabbly become a stand-by recipe in my kitchen.

This is really a 2 1/2 fork recipe - I just don't know how to make it a half. I doubled the garlic and basil, bummed up the oregano. It was tasty and very easy. Served with pasta, which was nice with the tomatoes.

Used chicken instead of veal (so not rating). Didn't do anything for us.

I think this is my first 4-fork rating on epicurious (My Fiancé is across the room insisting on the fourth fork). Very good, quite easy - and had all ingredients on hand. Used dried herbs (shock, horror, I know) - will try fresh next time. Will make again!

I used a 28oz can of chunky crushed tomatoes since that's what was on hand. Wonderful and easy to make for a weeknight dinner. Even my two-year old loved it.

After printing this recipe to make it for the umpteenth time, I felt it was about time I went ahead and shared my enthusiasm for this dish. If I am in the mood for veal, this is the recipe I make. Outstanding!

This was very simple and my family loved it so much that a week later I subsituted chicken cutlets for the veal. Because my husband likes a smoother sauce I poured the tomatoe sauce in the blender, pureed it and returned it to the pan. Then added the chicken back and topped it with grated parmesan and sliced mozzarella. I will add this dish to my routine!

Not great, but not bad. A nice alternative to veal parmesan or marsala. There was way too much tomato flavor, and the veal lacked flavor. I'd recommend seasoning the veal with italian seasoning rather than salt and pepper. Maybe 1 can diced tomatoes and a smaller can of tomato sauce???

I made this last week and loved it so much that I'm making it for comapny tonight. I did think that the recipe overcooked the veal a tad. I'm going to adjust the sautee time slightly.

I, too, deglazed with red wine, and served with angel hair pasta. This is delicious, easy and attractive....and VERY Italiano! This goes in my permanent file!

This recipe is an old staple now. I think it works better with relatively thin pork cutlets. They are juicier than the veal cutlets.

So easy, and really delicious. I also added red wine and extra garlic. This was a hit!

I used fresh yellow tomatoes to make a sauce first. Then substituted the fresh yellow sauce and deglazed with port wine. It's amazing and looked so good.

Excellent! Definitely use fresh basil. Quick and simple but elegant enough for a dinner party. The dried red pepper gives it a little zip making the sauce quite tasty! I will make this again and again!

Loved this recipe!!! It was my first from epicurious. I took a few suggestions from other cooks, such as adding a red wine deglazer and using 1/2 flour and 1/2 Itlian breadcrumbs to coat the veal. I also used just 4 cutlets and did not cut back on the sauce. If I use 8 cutlets next time I would double the sauce. It was also great with angel hair pasta. Being a new cook I love hearing from all the experienced cooks with their opinions and suggestions. It's a great way to learn. I will most assuredly make this dish again.

We absolutely loved this !!!! This was awsome. My son who really doesn't care for veal was looking for more ! I served it with Angel Hair Pasta and a salad and a wonderful red wine ...YUMMMY !!!!!

Only one word necessary, YUM! Took a previous cooks advice and used red wine to deglaze, and threw whole basil leaves in and just let them wilt. Delish!

I cheated and used pork tenderloin instead of veal, but still came up with great results. I took the advice of a previous chef and served a side of capellini. Definitely worth trying.

I rate this recipe a 10. The only thing I change is the garlic. I increase it by 50%. Besides the mess, this meal is great.

Outstanding!!! I used crushed Tomatoes instead of diced only because that is what I had on hand.

Excellent dish and recipe makes enough sauce to add to pasta as a side dish.

A quick and tasty dish that could easily be presented to company. The only thing I changed was to add a generous splash of Merlot to the pan as a deglazer before adding the diced tomatoes and herbs. Also 8 ounces of mozzarella was a little bit more than I needed. It was a huge hit with the family - a definite keeper.
