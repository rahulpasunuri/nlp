I baked these with boneless skinless whole thighs and they turned out great! I used low sodium soy sauce and doubled the marinade. Preheat oven to 400. Add chicken without marinade on a heavy duty foiled lined baking sheet and bake for about 12- 15 minutes. Meanwhile, pour marinade into a sauce pan and boil to an almost thicklike glaze. You'll need to skim the top. Brush glaze on chicken & broil in oven till bubbly. Spread toasted black & white sesame seeds on a platter. Place chicken on top. Top with sesame seeds. Tastes even better the next day.

I really wanted to love this. Tried the crock pot method as others suggested. I think my demise was being in a hurry. I thought doubling the sauce would be a good idea in the crock pot, and I should not have doubled the soy sauce. Salty, salty, salty. I also overdid the cooking time. What I ended up with reminded me more of chicken jerky than what i was expecting. I'll probably try it again, but another cooking method and not doubling the sauce.

outstanding! i used a dozen chicken drummettes and only marinated for about 6 hours, then braised the chicken directly in the marinade (added mushrooms and a splash of water so it wouldn't get too thick) in a covered skillet for about 20 minutes. served over steamed rice with snap peas and bamboo shoots. just spooned the reduced marinade over the rice for a delicious sauce. hubby licked his plate and asked for seconds! would definitely recommend braising for those reviewers who didn't fry, but missed the carmelization.

One of my favorite recipes. It calls for a lot of ingredients but the flavors are incredible. This is also one of my favorite dishes to order when I go to Yank Sing. I make mine with boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I marinate overnight in the refrigerator, then bake in a 9x13 pan at 375.This is much easier than deep frying in foil. The results are moist, tender but not carmelized. This summer I'll try it on the grill.

I too used chicken thighs instead of breast so the meat would be more moist, foiled wrapped about 1-1/2" dia. of meat on a 8" square and baked at 350 for 25 mins. The end results were not as good as my mom's traditional recipe when you cook it in oil- not much carmelization of the juices

Excellent. I took another cook's advice and put all the ingredients in a crock pot the night before and cooked them on low for about 8 hours the next day. I used skinless thighs and they were succulent and well carmelized. I making this again this week as the centerpiece of a Chinese Birthday Party celebration. It's the perfect do ahead dish.

I also baked it in the oven and it was superb. I used chicken breast (cut into 2-inch pieces). I wrapped the chicken and sauce in parchment paper, which I placed in a glass dish. This makes load of sauce. I kept the leftover sauce and made a stir-fry the next day with shrimp.

I have not made this, but am very curious about the texture of the chicken being cooked as this is written. Someone, anyone? Let me know! Thanks

To the cook in Denver- You can find just about anything you need in Denver to make this dish and any other Asian style dish if you head downtown to the Pacific Mercantile on Lawrence. Ask anyone on the staff.

Try this in the crock pot!!! I used 8 boneless/skinless half-breasts, cutting each half-breast into quarters, and used dried cilantro, minced ginger from a jar, as well as minced garlic from a jar... and could only find chinese black bean sauce (no brown bean or other "bean sauce") at Safeway... it worked perfectly!!! Since it's in the crock pot, the breasts come out extremely tender. Dump all ingredients in the night before and put it in the refrigerator overnight. Then turn the crock pot on low in the morning for 8 hours... serve over rice and with steamed broccoli or green beans as an entree... excellent dish!

The first time, the chicken was very undercooked after 20 minutes. Last night, 8 minutes in the deep fryer was perfect.

For those of you who baked/broiled/grilled the chicken, did you still wrap it in foil? Thanks

This was delicious. I just marinated the chicken for 3 hours, and grilled it (didn't wrap it in foil). It was very tasty. will definitely make it again.

I also bake these and they are great. I've made them for a dinner party and for my family. The kids love them. They are a bit time-consuming but well worth it!

to hoboken: i would use 6 breasts, but i really do reccomend thighs, they don't dry out like brests can. i bake these, no oil, they come out perfect, 450 for 10 minutes then 350 for another 10...

I am an inexperienced cook. Maybe someone can help with a couple of questions. Some of the reviewers wrote that they used chicken breast instead of thighs. How much chicken breast did you use? Also, I would like to "lighten" the recipe without sacrificing too much flavor. Do I need to use all that oil?

Great! I remembered a restaurant in L.A. called Little Bali that did these, I like these even better. I think thigh meat is a must, they come out super tender!

I made these for a party I was attending. Instead of chicken thighs, I used chicken breasts and cut them into bite-sized pieces, then marinaded them overnight. Instead of frying them, because of the mess, I baked them at 325 for about 11 minutes. They were delicious! A huge hit! I would definitely make them again

This was wonderful! Made this for a New Years Eve party...what a hit! I thought it was crazy to fry the chicken in the foil, but it worked. Kept the extras warm in the oven and just refilled as needed. I would try baking next time as the frying made a HUGE mess in the kitchen. Oil everywhere, but well worth the clean up.

YUM YUM! I followed the recipe as written, except I cut the thighs into smaller, appetizer size pieces, and broiled instead of fried. A hit on Xmas eve. Next time I'll make with larger pieces and use as an entree.

I made this recipe for a luau I was catering for a friend. There were about 60 people, so I more than quadrupled the amounts. Great make ahead recipe. I marinated the chicken and folded the chicken in foil packets the day before, then fried at the last minute. Everybody loved them. The flavors were wonderful. Great taste combination. Better than any paper wrapped chicken you'll ever get at a Chinese restaurant!

I made this recipe using chicken breasts (cut the breasts in 1/4). I was apprehensive about the foil, so I tried cooking one in the foil and it did come out perfect. However, I decided to broil the rest and they were great. The marinade is super. Can't wait to try them on the grill!

I prepared this dish for my job's Christmas potluck and it was a hit. I received many complements and a few asked for the recipe. I made the dish exactly like the recipe except for cutting the thighs into smaller pieces. I wasn't sure if others left the bone in, but I didn't. I was a little nervous after deep frying because of the grease it retained but I opened each packet individually and drained it (not sure if anyone else had this problem). By the way, I found the bean sauce at a local Chinese specialty store the supermarkets only carried black bean sauce.

One of the great things about this site is the reviews that readers submit. I think it is a boon to read about the alterations people make, and write about what worked and what didn't. When I made this dish, I used many of the suggestions that other readers had made. I used parchment paper instead of foil, and the packets turned out beautifully. I also substituted the Chinese Bean Sauce with Black Bean Sauce [this may be the same thing, I'm not sure]. This was an excellent dish.

Rather than foil, I used parchment paper, and when cooked in the oil, you can see the chicken (the paper becomes translucent). What a huge hit at our gourmet club. I had appetizers, and used this with the Sesame/Shrimp Toast and Asian Spring Rolls... needless to say, nobody wanted to continue on to the entree after these!

The BEST, moistest (such a word?) chicken I have ever had!! I used chicken breasts, cut in half, and since I didn't have fresh cilantro (also known as coriander), I used 1 tsp dried cilantro. This is absolutely marvelous. Definitely for those you like the Oriental flavorings on food. It was really easy to make, and since I had too much to eat, my cat ate it without chewing!! And he never does that!!! I must use the sauce as a stir fry sometime with a little cornstarch added, and maybe some red pepper flakes too!! Try it if you want to make something totally different, and be guaranteed that it tastes great.

Easy and Excellent! I also put these on the grill for about 5 minutes a side. I would only like to use smaller pieces of chicken next time, maybe three to one thigh. I did not leave any of the ingredients out, the sauce was great.

I have made this dish several times. It is also delicious as a stir fry with chicken breast - without deep frying. I serve it with rice and get raves every time.

This dish is fantastic! We aren't big dark meat fans. So, we used four chicken breasts instead of dark meat, and it was great! (We also left out the bean sauce and didn't miss it at all.) We have eaten paper-wrapped chicken at many Chinese restaurants, and this recipe tops them all!

Loved this recipe! I do not eat deep-fried foods, so I used the oven and things carmelized quite nicely. I used wings the 2nd time, and since I had a backache I didn't want to stand and fill individual packets, so I baked them in their marinade, and they were delicious! I'm making them a 3rd time tomorrow, and I will use boneless thighs, which will be easier to cut in half. I agree about the deep frying in aluminum, and since they baked so nicely without it, I'll leave out the "silver wrap".

This recipe is delicious. Highly recomended, many of my friends asked for this recipe!!! Do not leave out any ingredients. Instead of frying I usually grill these or pan cook them. Still keeps the great flavors and is also still very tender!!! I also used ground ginger and the flavor was good. I have also used a sweet'n'low packet instead of the sugar and it was grat too. This is a definate favorite of mine!!!

Excellent recipe. I put the foil packets on the grill instead of deep frying. Very fast and easy to make. Ingredients are easily available. It's my new favorite!

Although it can be a bit time consuming, I have made these tiny packets of joy for a baby shower, a holiday appetizer and a pot-luck bridal shower. Each time they were a big hit! Worth every step, and don't leave anything out.

Haven't tried the recipe yet, but was hoping to do so this coming Superbowl Sunday. I have a question/concern about deep frying in the aluminum foil. I've been reading about toxins connected with plastic wraps, and was concerned that toxins would also be leached(sp?) into the chicken from the foil while deep frying. Please let me know if I shouldn't be concerned. I hope this wasn't too stupid of a question/concern. Thank you!
