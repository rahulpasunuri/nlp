This recipe is a great base. I doubled the recipe (went fine proportion-wise). Took some liberties with the recipe: instead of steaming the zucchini I sauteed it in 2 tlb of olive oil with a whole onion; added 1/4 tsp curry powder in addition to the cumin; added salt, pepper and dill to taste and used chicken broth instead of the recommended ice cubes (just stuck a can in the freezer while cooking and used 1/2). Came out amazing with these adjustments and chills beautifully for company. Yummy!

This soup was simply unappealing. Because of the intense sour flavor from the buttermilk (mostly) and the lemon, i added an extra zucchini and extra cumin and a little serrano pepper. It was probably too much spice, but alas, the sourness had not departed. I had this in my house for a week and no one touched it again after their first spoonful. However, i think the recipe can be salvaged, given the changes a cook from Scarsdale suggested. I think that this soup with either a vegetable broth or cream would be much better than the one written here. There is a slim but veritable chance that i would make the soup again with these changes. On the bright side, this was very simple to make.

I found the combination of flavors to be too tart--too much lemon and buttermilk. I tried reducing the lemon, adding cilantro, and using chicken stock to think it instead of ice. I also added chili (serano and Tapatio sauce). My husband loved it but I could tell that some of my guests were less than thrilled. I would make it again for my husband, but I would engage in more doctoring.

Once modified per the suggestions of A Cook from Scarsdale, NY, this recipe is excellent. I even increased the amount of zucchini and onion (and, along with them, the broth and buttermilk), and loved it.

While this is a cool and refreshing soup, I think it lacked adequate flavor. This is a soup to enjoy more for its texture than its flavor.

I should have tried the variations listed here - the soup was adequate but not stunning. The avocado and zucchini have a lovely smooth taste, but I felt that there should have been one additional flavor to make it more interesting. Is cilantro a candidate? I'd definitely use stock rather than plain water cubes to thin this, too.....

This soup was fantastic! I sauteed a half of a large vidalia onion first, and added the zucchini until it was tender. Also, I used organic vegetable broth in place of ice cubes to thin the soup out, and I used 1/8 teaspoon of cumin and 1/8 teaspoon of curry powderinstead of all cumin. Last, to present the soupd I topped each bowl with a little hot pepper oil and a sprig of dill. It looked gorgeous and tasted outrageous.

This was absolutely terrific and easy to make. I got a special on Florida Avocados and we had the soup twice in one week! I cut back on the cumin the second time though. A piece or two of cold shrimp floated on top makes it even more special. Mind you, I made the soup in October, and a chilled soup like this was still delicious.

I added cucumber to this and it came out even better. Also, substituted chicken broth for the ice. Recipe really lends itself to improvisation.

After reviewing this recipe I found that by adding a little more color to the presentation would be nice. Perhaps some type of cream, like a chipotle cream or a cilantro cream. also maybe substituting chicken stock for ice cubes to inhance flavor. Overall a very smooth soup.

soup was delicious. I added another avocado and used no ice cubes. Made it the day before and the flavors blended wonderfully well. It was a real treat on a blistering hot day.
