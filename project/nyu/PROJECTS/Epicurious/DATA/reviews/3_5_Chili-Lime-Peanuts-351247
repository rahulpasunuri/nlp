Delicious! I added lime zest to increase the lime flavor. I only needed to bake for 20 minutes, stirring once at 10 minutes and again around 17 minutes.

There is no way you can bake these peanuts at 350 degrees F. for 30 minutes and not burn them! My kitchen smells to high heaven!

I made this for the first time last night and my family loved it. It is so tasty and easy. I used raw almonds instead of spanish peanuts and it was still so good.

Yeah, added the extra teaspoon of lime. Can not find the raw Spanish peanuts, used regular raw peanuts. The raw is the hard part.

I thought these peanuts were very good. My DH club meeting here liked them, too. Maybe more lime--

I might've put too much oil in when i roasted the peanuts, and so i tried to rinse them off afterwards to get some of the oil off because they did some out very oily. and then i think they needed a little more lime too....maybe...3 tsp instead. i would try them again to try and get it right, but if its supposed to be anything like my first batch, i wouldn't make them again.
