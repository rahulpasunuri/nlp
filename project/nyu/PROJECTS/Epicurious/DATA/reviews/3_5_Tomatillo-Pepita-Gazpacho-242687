As our guest said last night, this dish is rockin! Every year I have lots of tomatillo volunteers in my garden, so I always have LOTS of tomatillos, and need lots of ideas of what to do with them all. This soup is fabulous and I will make it weekly until the season is over! Ignore the comment about the recipe not being complete - all of the instructions are there - it is just a simple soup with a garnish of green onion, cuke, cilantro, avo and tomatoes. I added a squeeze of lime as well.

Great, but, never says when to add cuc. Doesn't explain much. hummmm how could epicurious accept this.

This recipe is pretty good. I don't have a grill, but toasted the tomatillos and pepper on the stove. It seems to make 4 servings as a main dish.

Poblano peppers are not otherwise known as pasillas. This is a totally different, dried, pep that will change the flavor of your dish. Just a heads up!
