This was delicious! It was a big hot at our dinner party. I made it as a side to go with the Porterhouse Steak and Cherry Tomato sauce recipe. I could not find dried porcini mushrooms so I used the porcini mushroom grinder that you can find in the supermarket isle with other spices. I soaked it in the water, but since it was grounded I did not strain it. It was delicious. Even our guests that didn't think they liked polenta, loved it!

poured polenta into individual ramekin dishes and spooned mushroom sauce on top for my guests. They loved it!! I thought it was very good overall, but couldn't get past a strange aftertaste. It also tasted terrible when we reheated the leftovers the next day. Maybe I didn't wash the mushrooms thoroughly....?

I guess I expected something to tingle my pallet. This was a tasty dish, but I have had other polenta dishes that blow this away. Thus the two fork rating. I did mix the mushrooms into the polenta, versus serving them on top, but I don't think that will dramatically effect the taste.

Very good indeed! Thanks to previous reviewers, I used a combo of shiitake and porcini; also used red wine instead of white. I had a bundle of fresh thyme (from the chicken legs with lemon and thyme recipe from this website...a very happy marriage indeed!) so I threw in a big bunch, a touch of dried rosemary. Couldn't be happier. Leftover polenta cooled in a baking dish, cut and fried the next day and served with remaining exquisite mushroom sauce. Delicioso!

This is really delicious, and fairly easy. I didn't quite have enough dried porcini, so I used .5 oz dried shiitake instead. Also, didn't have madiera, so subbed sherry. I think what really made this good was that I made it ahead of time, reheated it, and then let it sit for 15 minutes. I think the flavors really got a chance to meld. Used the "Buttered Polenta" recipe from this site, which was delicious. It's really the same, instead less butter and no cheese, though I did add some. I also cooked the polenta and hour and a half, which I think made it super good. The mushroom sauce would be GREAT over steaks, chicken, pasta, rice, etc. My guests said they felt like they were transported to Italy.

As a poor college student, I lacked the means to buy more mushrooms so I subbed some canned ones to get the whole amount. It probably wasn't nearly as good as it could have been, but it was still delicious.

The mushroom sauce is what makes this. Without the sauce it's a nice, easy, 3-fork polenta.

Outstanding and very easy! No need to add all the butter. It works just as well with a small amount to finish it. I used peccorino romano and it was perfect the first time.

Outstanding. Fry the leftover polenta in slices the next day, and cover with the sauce and it just gets better.

I used the sauce with the Parmesan Polenta from June 1996. It's firmer and no butter, and soaked up the sauce well. Very good!

Have made this twice in the last week for dinner parties and huge hit each time. Not wanting to crack a bottle of white, I've substituted red wine each time and it seemed fine. This is a very elegant, simple and tasty polenta dish.

Yum--just delicious, a perfect winter meal. I didn't have white wine or Marsala, so used red wine instead, and it tasted almost like beef burgundy. I also cut down on the butter and cheese in the polenta and it was still very creamy. You can strain the mushroom liquid using a coffee filter to get rid of any silt.

The mushroom sauce is delicious! This polenta recipe is way too creamy for my taste so I wisked in more cornmeal and made it much thicker.

Oh my goodness; this recipe is to die for. It is the ultimate comfort food. The only thing I did different was cut down on the butter by 2 Tablespoons (for the polenta) and it wasn't missed! I would follow the advice of the cook from Uganda and rinse the mushrooms next time. I can understand why the dish is so popular at Vinci's restaurant in Chicago AND why the management counts each dish and gives away a free trip to Italy to the ten-thousandth diner who orders it. Thanks for getting the recipe for us Bon Appetit.

Very good, would reduce the water a bit too thicken the polenta as I like it more thick than this recipe produces. But overall, this was a fantastic peasant meal.

did I miss something? Cornmeal mush and mushroom gravy? Being raised on polenta, I should have known better....

Great recipe! The mushroom sauce is to die for! For the polenta, I decreased the water so that I could serve as baked triangles rather than the soft version. I will use this sauce for other dishes as well.

What a wonderful recipe....Everyone at the dinner party loved it. I did forget to put the parmesan cheese in it so I served it on the side. Half of us loved it with the cheese and the other half without it. So I would serve it this way again.

Where is the recipe for the mushroom sauce??? Not too alert this morning- found the recipe for the mhrm sauce!!!!!

Very good! I poured the polenta into ramekins so it would form into small rounds to present on the plate with the main course. It was a big hit. I will definitely make it again. Next time I will try 1/2 parmesean and 1/2 marscapone.

I plan to serve this dish regularly, especially for my vegetarian guests, decorated with fresh rosemary for color. Can make sauce ahead and ingredients can easily be kept on hand. I would recommend to rinse the mushrooms several times, after reserving the first water, until the bottom of the rinse water has absolutely NO SAND. Thank you.
