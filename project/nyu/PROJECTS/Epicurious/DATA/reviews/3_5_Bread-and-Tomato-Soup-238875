Wow, what a great mid-week soup. It came together so quickly with really nice flavour. My only change was a dash of red wine vinegar to pop the flavour.

Delicious! I used wheat bread, cut the oil in half, and sprinkled cheese on top. Very easy and tasty!

Loved it. Everyone else loved it too. Insanely simple, I didn't use stock or water, just showed off some amazing tomatoes. The amount and dryness of the bread directly controls how thick the soup will be. The directions call to remove the garlic. In my case, there was no need, nor would I know how, since a strainer would catch a lot of the soup and bread as well, I think.

Didn't know to reduce the oil and ended up having to add water in addition to the chicken stock. What I learned from this recipe is that for those of us who don't want to combine dairy with meat based soups- this is a smart recipe. The bread achieves thickening the soup and making it creamy without using heavy cream. I ran this soup through the blender at the end and got a great color. Final lesson: maybe 2 tbl spns oil, 4 cups chicken stock, lots of fresh basil, bread already toasted, keep garlic, and run through blender at the end. Very yummy, not oily, and creamy without all the fat!

This was awesome. I used to live in Florence and this dish definately took me back. I've made it before from fresh tomatoes and often it seemed like a lot of work with mediocre results but this recipe really gets the job done. cheap quick and easy. everyone loves this.

My husband and I loved this soup with a few modifications per earlier reviewers. I used 1/3 cup olive oil instead of 1 cup, used chicken broth instead of vegie broth or water, used 12 basil leaves instead of 3-4, and added a twist of freshly ground black pepper to each serving. Delicious, easy, and satisfying...perfect comfort food!

This is a great soup recipe, and tastes exactly like the bread soup my host mother made in Spain (which I have been craving since...). For the reviewers that said it was just bread tomato mush (implying that this is a bad thing), that is the idea. This definitely isn't a creamy tomato soup, it's a BREAD tomato soup, and is supposed to be a different texture. I love the mushy goodness- true comfort food, and a heartier soup than most tomato soups. But maybe not for everyone's tastes. My fiance begs me to make this on a regular basis!

This soup was so easy and delicious. I only used 1/3 cup of the oil and I think next time I'm going to try making it with less bread and see if it still maintains the wonderful thick texture. This recipe is a keeper.

great basic soup for a cold, rainy day! tastes great the second or third day as the flavors have stewed together. per the other reviewers suggestions, i amended the recipe, which is great to use as a starting point. i reduced the olive oil to a half cup, added some tomato paste, a teaspoon of dried basil, and garlic cheese croutons instead of bread. i would definitely recommend using vegetable stock instead of water as the latter will make it too bland.

This was a nice easy soup to make. Mine tasted a bit strong, though I blame myself for overseasoning it. I took other users advice and used half of the recommended oil. I still felt half the oil was too much though. I used most of the bread as crotons and only put some in the soup while cooking as the recipe explains. I think this would be better if there wasn't so much oil or perhaps by baking/toasting the bread instead

Great basic soup. This was a turning point for my boyfriend. He normally does not like soup, but I made this for a dinner party and now he is well on his way to enjoying soup. Very easy. Def no need for a full cup of olive oil--even if the oil is for the bread. ick.

I made this soup for a cold, wet Mothers' Day and it won rave reviews across the generations! There are a few ways I would tweak it: Like other posters, I tripled or quadrupled the basil AND used canned tomatoes with basil. I would definitely reduce the oil, maybe even by half, to prevent the layer that formed across the top. And I ran it through my food processor (will try my immersion blender next time) to lose the strange lumpy consistency. I didn't bother removing the garlic cloves--just blended them right in. With the new, smooth texture, the soup was really delicious and flavorful.

horrible. A disgusting waste of olive oil. It's nothing more than a soggy loaf of bread and carbo loading in a bowl.

Great basic soup. I didn't add the bread in the soup, but opted to make olive oil cheese toasts to accompany the soup. Also doubled the amount of basil. Great "comfort" soup, and hubby loved it as well.

Delicious, but I had to add 3 times as much basil, a little garlic, and black pepper. Goat cheese was a nice topping.

My boyfriend made this for me tonight after I told him I had a craving for tomato soup. He followed the modifications suggested by the last reviewer and it was DELICIOUS. The crunchy bits of bread with the olive oil was SO delicious, an absolutely perfect meal on this cold evening. I'm definitely going to ask him to make this for me all winter.

I like the idea of this recipe, but it needs several modifications or else you'll wind up with a mushy tomato mess. First of all, I doubled the amount of basil that the recipe called for. I also added pepper. Most importantly, don't let the bread dissolve, as the recipe calls for. It will be mushy and have an odd texture. I think it would be better to remove the bread from the pan after it has browned and then add the rest of the soup ingredients. Add the bread a couple of minutes before serving and you'll have a nice tomato soup with tasty croutons on top. It would also be good if you added some cream to the soup. Finally, I grated some parmesan onto the soup before serving.
