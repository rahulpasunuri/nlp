The flavor of this pudding was delicious. The whole family loved it. It was a bit loose but a little more time in the oven should fix that minor problem. It will be part of our Thanksgiving menu from now on.

I am a big fan of Indian pudding. However this version was a little too sweet and a little too "thin" for my taste. I prefer Indian pudding with a more substantial consistency. I will try another recipe on Epicurious next time. (Note that many recipes on this site call for puddings without eggs. I believe that eggs are essential for the authentic product).

My whole family liked this very much. We used French Vanilla Ice Cream to add the nutmeg to. It did take a little longer to bake, but turned out well...was just as good leftover at room temp.

I was surprised at the small amount of cornmeal in the recipe and disappointed in the lack of corn flavor in the pudding. It turned out pretty runny even though I followed the instructions exactly. I would not make this again.

This dish just didn't go over in our home on Thanksgiving. You must really like the flavor of molasses...it was strong. I am cooking in France so there are slight variations in ingredients, but not significantly enough that I would make this again when I'm in the States. Kids did not like it. Ice cream was good, but use it with something else.

My husband loved it, but I thought it took to long to bake. Much longer then the receipe called for.

This is delicious. Kids really like it--I think it's because of the name. Nutmeg ice cream is great...we also used it for apple pie. This recipe is now a Thanksgiving staple.
