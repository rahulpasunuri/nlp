Refreshing and flavorful! I only used watermelon and cubed it for a buffet dinner. It was a hit and such a lovely presentation. They let me take a small portion home with me and I put it in the blender for a delicious afternoon treat. I feel some some inspired summer beverages coming on!

I make this salad every year and it is always wonderful. Lime brings out the best in watermelon.

This was excellent. I cut the fruit up, fruit salad style, and poured the cooled syrup over it. My guests loved it and wished I'd made more. We all thought the watermelon tasted better than the cantaloupe, but they were both delicious. I could easily make just the syrup and drink it!

This is very easy to make. It's a summer staple! Plus it's a help for winter fruit that is not at it's peak. A great idea for picnics.

I made this for a 4th Of July picnic. Although we all loved the taste, we all agreed that the fruit was better without any dressing. I think this would be a great way to serve watermelon/cantaloupe that isn't as sweet as you would like.

I used cucumber moon slices instead of watermelon because that's what I had. This was yum--very refreshing for a cookout with all the encased meats!

I cubed the fruit and added pinapple. I tasted it before and after adding the spearmint, and wow! the spearmint added a new layer of flavor. I took this to a picnic and everone loved it.
