I have to lend a hand to redeem this recipe. The cook screaming in caps from Oklahoma City used ruby port. You need to use tawny. And toasting the walnuts adds a very nice touch. You do have to like bleu or gorgonzola, but if you do it's very nice. I used gorgonzola and served with water crackers, apples and celery and it was a HUGE hit among bleu cheese fans. Easy, elegant, and a little goes a long way.

I made this today, following the recipe and using a high quality Gorgonzola cheese. It's an excellent spread if you like good blue cheeses. It's important to toast the walnuts, and to use tawny port as directed. If you use ruby port, the spread will be an unattractive purple color. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for a 4th of July gathering and many people either loved this or didn't like it at all. You definately do need to love blue cheese to like this recipe. I won't be making this again since I prefer if the majority like the taste and in this case there wasn't a majority.

I DID NOT EVEN PUT THIS OUT ON THE TABLE. I MADE THE MISTAKE OF NOT READING THOUROUGHLY THE REVIEWS. I USED A RUBY PORT AND IT LOOKED HORRIBLE AND WAS NOT AT ALL IMPRESSIVE, I MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BOUGHT A PEPPERAGE FARM CHEESE LOG. A WASTE OF REALLY GOOD BLUE CHEESE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER TO SERVE THE WEDGE OF CHEESE WITH WALNUTS SPRINKLED ON TOP AND PORT DRIZZLED OVER, THE PRESENTATION IS MUCH BETTER THAT WAY.

I made this with stilton when it first appeared in Gourmet, and my family and guests liked it so much, that I made more and gave it as gifts in interesting crocks. You have to like strong-flavored cheese, and it goes best with bland crackers, or stuffed into celery stalks. The cheese has to be a good-quality import. Toast the walnuts first, for a more complex flavor.

Silver Spring Cook - maybe you used too hard of a cheese. I was lucky enough to have a crock of Stilton that a friend brought back from England. The texture was excellent.

to the cook from silver springs, md - did you use tawny port? there's a difference - ruby port will impart the purple color - and it's an entirely different taste. great and easy spread for crackers or bread - easy holiday fare.

I read the rave reviews, but my experience was that it was too hard (it was pretty solid), too strong (it tasted like eating a chunk of blue cheese), and looked unappetizing (the color was sort of purplish gray). Unfortunately, my guests didn't like it at all, so it ended up being tossed. If anyone can tell me how to fix any error I may have made, I'd be happy to try again.

Robust flavor of the blue cheese with the crunchy texture of the walnuts. I used black walnuts, what a complementary taste treat!

We served this at our housewarming last week. It really went over in a big way.

This is a great recipe - very easy to make and yummy if you like blue cheese. I took it to a dinner party and served it with toasted baguette slices and apple and pear slices.

An excellent spread. Fruity and nutty at the same time. Being in Europe, I measured 200 grams of walnuts. I used red port, which gave the dip an amusing purple color. I added almost a full cup of port because it makes the dip taste more interesting. This recipe couldn't be easier!

Very strong flavor, but in a house that loves Gorgonzola cheese it was wonderful. I am making it to take for Christmas at my in-laws.

It had a very full-bodied flavor, that put off some guests. Also, it is not attractive, because it turns greyish from the blue cheese. It made a HUGE quantity. Cut the recipe in half! 35 people at a wine and cheese party didn't even finish the half I put out.
