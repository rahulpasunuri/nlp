This is way too much vinegar for the amount of cabbage. I made another very similar recipe and used only 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, and also included three shredded apples. Also tastes much better the second day.

Not quite right. My gut feeling is that the recipe is missing an ingredient or step.
