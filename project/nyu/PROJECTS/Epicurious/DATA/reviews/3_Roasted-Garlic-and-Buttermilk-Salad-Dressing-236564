As others have stated, it is rather unexceptional. I will, however, try it again. Next time I will add cracked peppercorn, some salt (I make own mayonnaise and is always on the shy side of salted), and definitely some green onions. And more garlic. It's a simple enough base, so I think it's worth tinkering with.

Yes...kind of bland as-is, but if you add 2 tsp of garlic salt and 1 tsp black pepper, along with either some chives or green onions, it's actually pretty tasty. Although I'm basing this on a "just whipped up" assessment, I imagine it will get tastier after the flavors meld together in the fridge for awhile before serving...

I thought this was sort of bland and tasted like it came out of a bottle. The problem with that is that when I make something at home I expect it to taste really great - not like it came from a bottle. I expected a buttermild dressing to have more "zip" and be on the tangy side.

I did not care for this as much as other reviewers. All that cheese seemed to be unnecessary and overpowered the flavor. I might try it without the cheese next time.

This is fantastic. I make it exactly as it's written and we all think it's great, even my 4-year-old.

Very easy, with a nice texture. Seemed just a touch bland, though, with not as much garlic flavor as I'd expected. I'd add some herbs next time, and maybe a bit of crushed raw garlic.

Terrific dressing! I used plain yogurt with a little milk instead of buttermilk, and it seemed to work fine. Definitely one to repeat--my husband called it his new favorite dressing.

We love this recipe! Have substituted chopped scallions for the chive on occassion. A wonderfully fresh flavor!
