This tasted great. It was the favorite up against a pomodoro and as well as a roasted pepper bruschetta. The peas did roll off; next time, I will puree them, then mix back in.

I didn't make this recipe b/c it sounded weird and a couple of reviewers here confirmed its weirdness - but I just wanted to mention not to give up on the concept. There is another "Artichoke Bruschetta" recipe on this website from Bon Appetit Jan. 1999 that is a thousand times better and a quick, wonderful appetizer for company - always a hit with even my rather "non-foodie" friends!

Delicious but ingredient measurements could be changed. Unanimous that the excessive peas (I 1/3'd) was overpowering. I'd add more ham too. The larger in surface area the bread pieces, too, the easier to manage. AND: last but not least, the time involved in preparation is more like 2 hours start to finish.

The peas and mint really take over the recipe and overpower the other ingredients. A big disappointment.

I think the combination of ingredients was just too strange. I didn't use the ham, which may be why it didn't work. If you're looking for another interesting appetizer with artichokes, try the olive and artichoke crostini (Gourmet, March 2003) instead.

Too many peas!! I should have taken another cook's suggestion to puree the peas and spread it on the bread. As is, the peas overpowered the artichokes.

Subtle, but tasty.... the peas are essential, as is the prosciutto or ham. In a line-up of about a dozen appetizers, it was quite the chosen one by some of my guests... not my personal favorite, but might have been more compelling without so much competition!

This was a wonderful switch to the normal tomato and onion bruschetta. I made it as an appetizer for a dinner party with some friends,and it was a big hit! I loved it and I would definitely make it again.

Delicious!! I made this as a first-course for my parents' anniversary dinner and it was a hit. following another reviewer's suggestion, I pureed the peas and used it as a spread before topping with the artichoke mix. I wasn't a fan of peas before- but this dish changed my mind. Grill the bread for an even better flavor.

There were no surprises here. I thought the list of ingredients was strange - but would somehow meld into something amazing. Nope. The flavour combination was interesting but that's all. Not bad, but I would not rave about it.

The fact that this recipe calls for canned artichokes and frozen peas should not deter the purist--feel free to go to the trouble of using fresh if you must, but this recipe is delicious either way. Extremely tasty!

Contrary to other folks, I though the peas were a critical ingredient. They roll off the bread, so I would suggest mashing them or pureeing them into a spread. The artichokes are tangy and the prosciutto is salty, so the sweetness of the peas is important for balance.

This was just great -- even with the peas!

This dish was delicious. I too made a substitution for the peas.I used fresh chopped chard. Spinach would also be nice.Maybe even eggplant. I would definitely make again.

This was a very good and very quick recipe. I removed the peas from the recipe though, YUCK! Also, once you are finished, drizzle extra olive oil over top, YUM!

this was very good. i left out the peas since i am not a big fan. the mint was an interesting counterpoint and complemented the other flavors nicely. easy to prepare!
