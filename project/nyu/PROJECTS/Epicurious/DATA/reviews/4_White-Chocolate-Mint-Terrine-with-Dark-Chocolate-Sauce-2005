Really nice. Tastes super-fancy, not to hard. As is, the textures are a little blah. I made individual mini terrines and added a layer of melted white chocolate, which I then refroze. I also added some crushed chocolate cookies on top. It certainly needed these extra textural dimensions in my opinion, but would certainly make again!

Very nice. My wife likes white chocolate and terrine, so this was perfect for her birthday. I added fresh raspberries to the bottom of the mold. As they were fresh, they came out a bit icy. Frozen raspberries should work better.

I have made this several times with rave reviews each time! This is my husband's favorite dessert.

This is a fabulous dessert! Served it last night for a dinner party. Everyone raved. I'll definitely make it again and again.

This is a wonderful, easy and elegant dessert to serve at a very special dinner party - I did last week and not a bite was left on any plate. So my advice to everyone would be, leave this one alone, do exactly what the recipe says, and enjoy!

I have made this recipe more times than you can imagine. Perfect for delicious taste and supreme for a do-ahead recipe. I have had a bigillion problems with the dark chocolate sauce however. Have tried it three times, and each time have had to throw it away. Without the water, sauce is too thick to paint a plate. Add the water, and you get a gloppy, separated mess. Now make the terrine as written with different chocolate sauce. Anyone else have this problem, cause I'd love to know what I'm doing wrong.

I made this for a recent dinner party, and as the other reviewers stated, it is easy and especially convenient as you can make it up to a week ahead. I would have given it three stars however, without my addition of some individually frozen raspberries that I happened to have in my freezer that I folded in to the mixture prior to freezing. Not only did they add flavour, they were visually appealing and, along with additional fresh raspberries and mint leaves for a garnish, elevated the dish up a notch:)! Everyone loved it, and the sauce was wonderful, too, not too sweet and really balanced out the terrine.

This was a very good dessert. Although, I do have to admit, as I expected, it was not nearly as sophisticated a taste as it sounds. The white chocolate is over-powered by the mint. The lesson in that is don't use expensive chocolate. I used Valrhona, waste of money. That said, it was a very good dessert, the valrhona was much appreciated in the sauce. The whole thing did definitely taste though a bit like a gussied up mint chocolate chip ice cream, which fortunately, I and my guests all quite like.

Refreshing on a hot summer night - the chocolate sauce is the best - our guests nearly licked the plates clean ! Easy to make, great presentation.

This was fantastic! Really easy to prepare even for inexperienced chefs. I'd rate it a 3.7 out of 4. This will definitely find its way into my recipe book!

This was my first terrine and turned out very easy to make. I've tried it a couple of times and both times people enjoyed it and found it refreshing. The dark chocolate sauce is a must to balance out the mint and the white chocolate.

This is a rating for the dark chocolate sauce which I used with another recipe. The sauce is out of this world. Very easy and absolutely delicious.

I have made this dessert several times, both at home and in the retirement home where I used to be chef. It's easy to make and makes a good impression--a small slice makes a very satisfying dessert.
