The idea behind this is a 4, but as written it's about a 2.5 -- I thought there was far too much lime and it overpowered all the other flavors. Next time I will cut the amount of lime in half and serve with lettuce instead of cabbage. I also would add some sesame oil and a touch of ginger and soy

Easy and a great combination of hot/sour/salty thai flavors. If you decide to use Napa cabbage instead of red or white cabbage like I did, don't put the dressing on until the last minute or it will start looking wilty and sad very soon after. Overall though, beautiful fresh green presentation and delicious taste. Made true to recipe aside from the different variety of cabbage.

Delicious! Instead of cabbage we wrapped the steak + toppings in lettuce leaves and ate as lettuce wraps. I also added a little soy sauce and sesame oil to the mixture, which was nice. The beef mixture would also be delicious over rice. I'll definitely be making this again

We liked this -- very light and refreshing dinner. We added a base of Thai noodles under the cabbage to give it a little more oomph. Also topped with bean sprouts. Delicious!

I didn't have time to swing by the asian market to pick up lemon grass, so I substituted lime zest. I also used basil instead of mint. Even with those changes, I thought this was a delicious and fast week night supper.

This was very good and very quick to make! I added some soy to broccoli/ cabbage slaw mix and omitted the shallots and mint to the beef, and added thai basil. Then topped it off with the fresh cilantro and then siracha (hot sauce). It was yummy! I used sliced sirloin, which was heavily s & peppered and added some garlic to the oil. This was very good and took less than 15 minutes to prepare.

I don't know what the complaints are about, this was a great recipe -- authentic taste, excellent flavor. I'd recommend adding peanuts. Works well over cabbage or rice.

This tasted fishy. It was awful. Nothing like what we get in a restaurant. We threw it out.

I made this just as the recipe called for and really liked it--reminded me of what I order at a local restaurant.

For the cook in Seattle who didn't understand Jeff Gehrig's comments. He was responding to the cook in London who said that in authentic Thai cooking the beef is served raw, allowing the acid from the lime juice to cook the meat.

With a couple of modifications: - let grilled beef marinate in the dressing for several hours before pouring over dressed cabbage, - cut back on cabbage to 6 cups - added 1/4 red onion to dressing This turned out to be the hit of the dinner party. Really quite good and tasting very much like the Larb Gai you would find in a Thai restaurant.

Thanks to other reviewers' comments, we used Romaine lettuce and cut the lime juice to 3 tablespoons and the fish sauce to 1 1/2 tablespoons. With those adjustments, it was just right.

I halved the amount of fish sauce and it was still overpowering - should be subtle. Recipe needs to be revamped.

Who cares how authentic it is, if it's good? It was good. The cabbage, however, was too crunchy - next time I would substitute Napa, Romaine, or some other green. And I found it too flavorful. I would halve the fish sauce and lime juice, and add a little sugar. I used sirloin, which was perfect. Some sliced cucumber would be nice, too.

I don't understand Jeff Gehrig's review. The recipe calls for grilled steak, not raw. Maybe he didn't read it. Some Thai salads use cabbage and some other greens.

I've had this slad at least 60 times in Thailand, this recipe isn't close. I've never seen cabbage used, it's missing the sugar (or palm sugar) in the dressing, the usual beef is tenderloin not rib eye and is ALWAYS grilled (usually medium rare, I've never seen it made with raw beef), sliced thinly and served warm on top of the other ingredients. It has always contained tomato as well. Rise powder is probably the easiest condiment to make at home, simply toast a couple of spoonfuls in a frypan until golden, then cruch it coarsley in a mortar and pestle, sprinkle about a dessertful over the salad, for crunch and flavour. There are much better recipes for this (yam neau) out there.

Very nice Thai salad. Quite similar to the spicy beef salads we had when traveling in Thailand. Used Romaine lettuce instead of cabbage, added tomatoes, and lime zest. Could even add more chilies or chili paste for a little more spice. Will definitely make again.

Nothing special, cabbage was too bitter. Did exactly what the recipe said. Won't make this again.

It tastes pretty good but for a more authentic style, the beef needs to be seasoned with some toasted rice powder (sold at some Asian grocery stores). As for people who mention the saltiness or whatever flavor as too extreme, taste the food and make adjustment, your tastebud is different than the recipe writer. I tend to add some sugar in my dressings or sauces, but reduce it in my dessert.

There is a Thai restaurant in Amherst, NH that makes a dish just like this called Plar Nua. This one is even better. I will try White rice next time not a fan of cabbage.

in traditional thai, the beef is supposed to be raw, and the acid in the lime juice cooks the beef. the same principle can be used with fish - tuna works well with this recipe.

Wonderful recipe. However, I used flank steak. Grilled on high heat to a nice sear and then sliced thin for the salad. Bok Choy is an excellent green to use instead of cabbage. Will do this again. Actually, have several times.

I cooked this dish for my bf and we both found it to be too overpowering and salty, so much so that we could not finish eating it. The combination of flavours were lovely but it was just too strong and took away the taste of the steak. Normally I love Thai food but this one gets a thumbs down. :(

This was GREAT! There is a Thai restaurant near me that makes this, and I daresay this recipe was even better! I like things spicy, so I will increase the number of serranos used next time. If you can plan ahead and do a lot of grilling on a weekend and grill the steaks then, you can cut the time on this down to about an hour.

The fish sauce can be a bit salty, but otherwise an excellent dish

Absolutely fantastic-- I'd order this in a restaurant eagerly. It's actually a 3.5 rather than a 3; I have very minor suggestions. I'd increase the mint to maybe 1/2 cup, be more generous with the lemongrass, and mix the cabbage in with the beef and marinade rather than leaving it as a lonely bed by itself. Amazingly, I truly enjoyed the cabbage, a vegetable I usually have to coax myself to eat. Be sure to slice the beef as thinly as possible.

This was really tasty and a great, light summer dish. Lots of chopping though which I found time consuming. Make on a weekend.

I agree with everyone that this is great. I varied this by slicing the beef before cooking, and marinating it in the dressing in a large plastic bag. I then let it marinate for a few hours in the refrigerator. Then I tossed it in the grill pan for a few minutes and then served it warm over the salad. Easy and great!

This was a HUGE hit....I served it as an appetizer and people couldn't stop raving about it. One friend asked for more instead of dessert (and my desserts are famous ;-)). I used extra lemon grass, and savoy cabbage. My bf wants to add that the leftover beef makes fabulous day after steak sandwiches.

This was very tasty, however I couldn't taste the lemongrass at all. I would add more lemongrass next time and less cabbage. I would even substitute a crispy romaine lettuce for the cabbage. I couldn't find any mint, but that didn't seem to matter. Overall, this dish was very good. I would just make a few minor changes.

Fabulous! I used Argentinian tenderloin which I prefer over strip steak for health reasons. I also marinated the cabbage for 1hr instead of 30mins because I needed to make it ahead -it was still crisp and delicious! Very flavorful.

So full of rich, acidic flavor. Delicious. The fish sauce is salty, so just add a dash of salt to each component, and definitely don't add the liquid to the cabbage until right before serving--it'll be limp otherwise

One thing that I found a must for Thai beef salad was the addition of toasted rice powder. This can be done by roasting in a dry hot pan until aroma and color emerge, then put it through a coffee grinder. Add about a 2 tsp to this recipe and you will notice the difference

I forgot to pick up the chili at the store, and wasn't able to find fresh lemongrass. Still, even without the chili and with dried lemongrass, this was a delicious dish. We'll definitely make it again.
