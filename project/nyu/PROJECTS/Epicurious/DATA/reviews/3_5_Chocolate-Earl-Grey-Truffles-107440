I thought these were really fun to make! I made these for a wedding along with earl grey cupcakes with bittersweet lavender ganache. It was perfect!!

I've been meaning to try making truffles, and this seemed like a perfect recipe to try, as I've recently come to love using teas for flavoring in dessert. Of course, I did make changes (some out of necessity, some just because). First, I had to use bagged tea (Twinning's) since I have no loose leaf and no place to get it. I ended up using 6 teabags, and enhancing that citrus flavor by incorporating cardamom seeds (about 4 pods worth). I let it steep for about 10 minutes, then added a splash of rum (Tattoo, for the spice/citrus notes) then put it back on the stove to simmer. Once it was at that point, I strained the mixture over the chocolate (a high-percentage cocao semi sweet). I then ground another teabag's worth of tea as fine as possible and sprinkled it into the chocolate, mixing well. At this point I also added another splash of rum. I set it in the freezer to chill. The last addition I made was grinding green chai and mixing it in with the powdered cocoa used for coating. They are delicious, and it was a pretty convenient (but messy) recipe, since all the ingredients were odds and ends I had on my shelves and in my cupboards!

This recipe is so easy to make. If you can melt things, you can make it. They are elegant and very impressive. I used a lavender earl grey tea and semisweet chocolate, since bittersweet was unavailable, and they came out beautifully. I do not recommend milk chocolate or tea from teabags; loose tea is better. Relax! This can be your go-to, this-will-always-impress people recipe, and it is neither expensive nor super time-consuming, as long as you plan time for the ganache to chill.

Instead of dropping the ganache by spoonfuls onto a tray, try squeezing hershey kiss size balls through a pastry bag with a large plain tip. Then pop them into the freezer for about 30 min. Then dip them in milk chocolate and drop them in the cocoa powder and roll them to coat. The frozen centers will cool the milk chocolate and give them that hard outer coating that won't melt when they come to room temperature. These are equally messy to make, but you won't have a mess when you serve them.

When the chocolate is getting messy on your hands than they are too warm to work...take some ice and hold it until you feel you have cold hands...use the chocolate very cold(make the portions for balls and put them back to fridge, and than start making them into balls)...that is the only way I can go through whole bowl and shape it into balls. I know it's time consuming, but it's worth it :o) Sweet Christmas Giving :oP

I love Earl Grey, and I love these truffles! My only complaint is how messy, messy, messy these are to form into balls.

i have to say that these tasted great. it was a pain in the ... to shape into balls without having them melt and look oddly misshapen. just because of the rolling issue, i probably won't make these again.

I used specialty tea bags instead of loose tea, and they turned out great! The chocolate is so smooth and nice. The truffles are rich but not too sweet, and so easy to make. I'll definitely be making these again.

I've been making truffles for over 20 years and this is my favorite recipe. Just be sure to use a fresh, good quality tea. Tea bags don't cut it. If you are going to pair them with other truffles, champagne truffles, chestnut truffles and Grand Marnier truffles make a nice assortment.

Rating: 4
An excellent flavored truffle with a sophisticated and subtle flavor. The kind and quality of tea make all the difference in the world--high quality, fresh loose tea is key. Bagged tea will likely end up bitter or lacking in flavor. Even buying loose tea at the store may not result in good flavor. If you have a tea shop in town, like I do, they are likely to have the freshest tea you will find.

I didn't have bittersweet chocolate so used a combination of unsweetened and semisweet. This was not a successful substitution.

These truffles tasted great - I used Valrhona dark chocolate (61%). I was afraid they wouldn't end up sweet enough, so I rolled the truffles in a mixture of cocoa powder and powdered sugar. My chief complaint was the coating completely melted into the truffles when they were brought to room temperature. Didn't affect the taste but they were rather unsightly. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to avoid this problem? I want to make this recipe again for a bridal shower I am giving, but I sure don't want them to look like last time! Plus, Valrhona is hard for me to come by, and I only have enough for one more batch!

One of my favorite truffle recipes. I've often added dried lavender to the tea with fantastic results. Sometimes I replace the tea with herbs and a drop or two of citrus oil (tangerine-lavender and rosemary-lemon work well).

Becasue I didn't have any Earl Grey tea, I decided to be "trendy" and use Chai Tea. Even though it was the cheap stuff, it worked beautifully. Since I used extra-bitter chocolate, I used a mixture of powdered sugar and cocoa powder to dust the truffles. Even my boss, who normally doesn't care for sweets, loved these and thought they tasted "professional". Mine were shaped a bit like mutant almonds, but no one complained. I'd like to try them again with other tea infusions.

Love this recipe, although I prefer a stronger Earl Grey flavor. Rishi teas are my favorite to use for cooking (chai also works well!)- BUT if you are having problems with flavor intensity, try using an Earl Grey flavored Rooibos Tea- I find the high quality ones (try Adagio) usually have a better flavor than the regular Earl Greys and you can steep for as long as you'd like without any bitterness at all. Also, a trick for forming the truffles: try using two spoons and 'smooshing' the ganache between them. Then hold the bottom spoon still and form a ball by rolling the top spoon circularly over the lump. Keep a glass of ice water handy to clean the spoons, but make sure to dry them after. (Hope that made sense. I've been making truffles for 5 hours now. Time for bed!) =) Enjoy!

I just made these as holiday gifts. I used Trader Joe's bittersweet chocolate and I think they turned out really well. I had no problem with the rolling into balls and drenching in cocoa part. I definitely made them into smaller than tsp. size balls and got about 35 truffles in the end. I have yet to give them away, but I hope everyone enjoys them! I liked the two that I ate.

I used lipton Earl Grey teabags. 2 for infusion and opened one to leave into the mixture. It turned out very well. The little bits of tea leaves added a unique touch to the truffle. Will try coating them with chocolate coating the next time.

I couldn't taste the tea in these but the creaminess was excellent so I do plan on making these again. I dipped them in chocolate instead of rolling them in cocoa. Mmmm.

These chocolates define to me what a grown-up chocolate should taste like. The bergamot and tea with the chocolate creates a complexity of flavor that is intriguing and delicious. The earl grey causes the truffle to be less sweet than most, which I enjoy, since I don't usually go for sweets, but my sweettooth friend also loved them. To the cook in the previous review, I didn't get a too-soft ganache for this recipe, but I have in others. If you add more chocolate, it usually helps, so I would try that next time if you have the same problem.

I made these with Chai instead of Earl Grey as part of a Christmas gift. They tasted wonderful, but sadly, the ganache was soft and had a tendency to lose shape at room temperature. I cannot figure out for the life of me what I did wrong, as I followed the directions exactly. Maybe next time, I'll add more chocolate to help with stiffness. The recipients said they were wonderfully rich though.

Wonderfully easy to do. I made these with a selection of other candies and chololates for an office dessert contest and everyone was impressed with the results. To keep them from melting while rolling in my hands, I resorted to keeping a large bowl of ice water nearby that I would dunk my hands into between truffles. I really helps when handeling things like this.

Who knew that making rich and delightful truffles could be this easy? This recipes takes so little time to prepare - I made this last Christmas for a work party and I was almost embarassed at how impressed my coworkers were. I may have made them too large, because the recipe did not yeild as many as anticipated. One might want to make a double recipe, they will go fast. Also, I made it with Hersheys cocoa as the Dutch version was not available.

I made this recently for a party and the guests raved over them. Delicious! I didn't experience any bitter aftertaste, but I used a very good earl grey. I also didn't press very hard on the leaves, so maybe that helped reduce any bitterness. Definitely would make this again!

Rating: 3
This was a qualified success; the earl grey flavour was very nice, but there was a definite bitter after taste of chewed tea leaf/tannin. I wonder whether a little more cream and no pressing on the tea leaves would help with this problem - I will give it a go. As chocolates they stood up very well next to the shop bought truffles that one of our guests brought along.

These are really very nice. Earl Grey is my favorite tea and bittersweet chocolate is my cup of tea, so I was very satisfied with this recipe. I rolled the truffles with as little cacao as possible, froze them, and then dipped them in melted 70%chocolate and sprinkled with raw sugar. Very elegant...

I seemed to solve the flavor intensity problem by using a double bergamot earl gray from stash teas. I used three bags. Don't break the bags open as the consistancy of the tea is very fine and would not sieve out well. I steeped the bags in the cream mixture with excellent results. Since Bergamot is the flavor backbone of Earl Gray, I would think a drop or two of bergamot oil might also do the trick.

Overall, this is a really good recipe. I would make a couple of changes next time. In my dark-chocoholism, I went with some very good, very smooth, very dark chocolate (76% cacao solids). I think the truffles turned out a bit too dark, though. In the future, I might mix this chocolate with a 50% cacao chocolate to get something roughly in the 60% range, though next time I think I'll go straight to 50% then see if I need to bump it up a bit. I think the darkness of the chocolate masked some of the flavors of the tea, but you can still sense it there, and it's fabulous. Secondly, I don't care for the cocoa powder on the outside. It's just too bitter on its own. I think I'd either dust the truffles with cocoa powder, rather than roll them in it, or I'd cut the cocoa powder with some powdered sugar. I wish I was un-chocolate-challenged enough to give them a chocolate coating, but alas, I'm stuck with a dusting option. I'll probably play with the tea quantity a bit too-- adding a bit more, and maybe a drop of essential oil of bergamot, which is the distinctive feature of Earl Grey. All in all, I'm very pleased with how simple these were to make, and they are melt-in-your-mouth wonderful. These would be a great simple dessert or unusual item to bring to a potluck party.

I will eat anything chocolate, so I was plenty happy with these, but I agree with those who say they couldn't taste the tea at all. I guess that's just as well, because I wasn't sure how I'd like that flavor combination. I keep seeing Earl Grey truffle recipes in other magazines, too; is it some kind of a weird trend?

Rating: 4
I like the subtlety of the original recipe, but today I wanted to make it a little stronger, so I used three Tazo teabags (cut the bags to make loose tea). They're divine. Also, I made another batch with cardamom instead of Earl Grey - used about 15 green cardamom pods, crushed with mortar and pestle. Again, quite strong - if you want subtle truffles, maybe use less pods. Maybe next time I'll try some fresh mint. Yummy.

I made these tuffles to give as Christmas gifts last night. I thought the tea was too overwhelming. So I made another batch of the chocolate without the tea, and mixed the two together. Still, all I tasted was the tea. I had my husband taste it, because I thought that maybe I was just being wierd. He thought it had a bad aftertaste. I was so dissapointed after reading the wonderful reviews, and buying good chocolate. I dumped it in the sink, and made the ROBERT LINXE'S CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES on this site.

I'm not good with baking and candymaking, and I aced this recipe, no problem! I took the truffles to a holiday party last week as a gift and the host put them out with the rest of the desserts; the truffles were the first to go (and how!). I used tea from the bags and the flavor was just there without overpowering--perfect--but I imagine loose leaves would lend a fresher more sophisticated taste. One caveat--I followed the recipe to a "t" but still only got 20 truffles (and I rolled them fairly small), so you may want to get enough to make a couple batches (separately, of course).

Rating: 2
This was my first try at truffle-making. I too found that the Earl Grey flavor was vanishingly faint (despite a full tablespoon of high-quality leaves from Upton Tea), and then I couldn't get them to roll into nice round balls. I guess I wanted them to look professional, and they just didn't (though I suppose that isn't the recipe's fault!). I used Valrhona, and maybe the chocolate was _too_ good for these purposes-- maybe a milk or white would have allowed the Earl Grey to shine through.

Rating: 3
This was very delicioius, although I did not feel the earl grey flavor despite using freshly bought loose leaves. I found that it easier to roll the truffles between one palm and a surface (e.g., baking sheet dusted with cocoa powder), rather than between both palms. It prevents the chocolate from warming too fast.

Rating: 4
This truffle recipe is one I plan on making every holiday season. The Earl Grey flavor is subtle, but strong enough for you to know it's in there. My friends all said that these are definitely gourmet shop quality. For the cook who had trouble with rolling them, your ingredients may have been too warm (or too cold, depending on your problem). Try them again -these are great!

I ran across this recipe during the holidays and didn't have time to try it. When Valentine's Day came around, a chef friend of mine was looking for lucious, finger-food type treats to serve and I remembered the Earl Grey truffles. I also gave her some fresh Earl Grey tea leaves from a shop in Philadelphia. So I have not made them myself but I did taste them...the creamiest, most lucious truffles I've ever had. Splurge using your finest chocolate for these. Watch out Godiva!!! p.s. to "Cook from La Jolla, CA"...did you remember to strain out the leaves? I can't imagine how they were bitter, but try again;they're worth it.

I made these truffles over the weekend, and while I loved the flavor, I had problems with the texture. They were very difficult to roll into balls. I ended up cutting them into squares. Any suggestions on what went wrong?

I agree with Vanesa's comment, the truffles "melts in your mouth like like an chocaholic's dream" I made over 15 truffles this Valentine's Day and this is so far one of my favorite (top 3). The Earl Grey Tea is subtle and doesn't contradict with the chocolat at all. I would suggest choosing a good quality dark chocolate that is not to bitter nor sweet to bring out the full flavor of Earl Grey. (I used Valrhona's 64% Cocoa Manjari for its aromatic fruit hints. Valrhona's Caraibe is also suggested for its smooth flavor). Also, be sure to use loose tea leaves instead of tea bags, and don't steep them in the heavy cream forover 5 minutes, or they will become bitter and dry. I added the butter after the cream/tea mixture, following the traditional way of making truffles. You may press a spoon against the sieve to juice out the heavy cream trapped around the tea leaves. That is, if you have a sieve with fine holes.

Wonderful! Such a pleasant surprise to have something so simple come out so beautifully. If you love Earl Grey you will really enjoy the subtle flavor it lends to this melt in your mouth chocaholic's dream. Careful not to steep the tea too long. And I did use a single Twinning tea bag with Lindt bittersweet chocolate. Look forward to trying it with other tea flavors like Jasmine and serving it to friends.

Delicious! I didn't have loose tea, but steeped Earl Grey teabags for a few minutes, and it seems to have worked fine. They seemed a little small, so I used a heaping teaspoon instead... I made a second batch with two tablespoons of Chambord instead of Earl Grey - they were both wonderful!

Mmm. I didn't roll them in cocoa powder as I was anxious to test them out. I think I might add more tea leave next time as I wouldn't know there was earl Grey in them had I not made them myself. I made the truffles too big and didn't get 35 as the recipe suggests. But do make sure to carefully strain out the leaves as a few snuck through my sieve and they don't mesh too well with really smooth chocolate.

La Jolla, did you keep the tealeaves in the butter and cream, or strain them out? I am wondering if I should use a teabag (I drink Twinings all the time and am perfectly satisfied with its flavor) and remove it after a few minutes. Any suggestions?

I am a chocolate lover and was excited to try this recipe but was very disapppointed. They were easy to make and look impressive, and I used all the authentic, high quality ingredients, but the tea leaves gave them a very bitter aftertaste. I was hoping to add this to my dessert plate at an upcoming party, but I am now reconsidering.
