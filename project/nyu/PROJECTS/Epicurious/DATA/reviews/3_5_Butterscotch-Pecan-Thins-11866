This recipe becomes and immediate 4- star if you brown the butter first. It takes on a much more authentic butterscotch flavor. I also sprinkled them with course sea salt before baking. You can make the dough into balls and then freeze. take out only as many as you want- fresh baked cookies every time. Yum!

These are delicious, but they are fragile. Wrap them carefully.

Cookies looked great with the pecan halves in the middle. Very professional. Didn't even make a difference that my log wasn't perfectly shaped. Used the food processor method. Dry ingrediants in the process. Scatter in butter chunks. Pulse. Add the wet ingrediants, process until dough forms. Freeze 45 minutes. Then slice and bake. My cookies didn't spread much even though the dough was sticky, rich and hard to work with before freezing. An inch between cookies was more than enough.

In response to the previous reviewer, brown sugar and butter are the ingredients of butterscotch.

I haven't made this yet, but I'm wondering if they are really worth it. Based on the ingredients, I don't see how these cookies have a butterscotch flavor. Can anyone who has made them offer some advice?

I've been making these cookies for years, but with some minor changes. 1) I make them in a food processor, very fast 2) I add chopped pecans to the recipe and omit the halves 3)I keep the rolls in the freezer and they bake up great -- fab for emergencies.

Although they are delicious, they are somewhat tedious to make and you must be very careful not to burn them.
