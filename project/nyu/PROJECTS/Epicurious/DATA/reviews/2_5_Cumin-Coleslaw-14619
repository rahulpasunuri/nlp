We really liked this. It's a slight twist on regular coleslaw; the cumin is really nice and would pair this well with beef. I made it to go with turkey sandwiches and really liked it.

This was awful. No flavor, yuck.

Quick and easy!! a nice and crunchy slaw as compared to some of those other "soggy" messes! Delicious as suggested or with grilled chicken,lamb or pork.

This is a really good variation on this dish - the cumin gives it a more modern, sort of south-of-the-border flavor.
