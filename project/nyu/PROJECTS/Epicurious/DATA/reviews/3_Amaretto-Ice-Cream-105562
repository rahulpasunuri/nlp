I had to tweak the recipe a bit, but it was completely worth it! I like to drink alcohol, but I don't like to taste it in my foods. I bake with amaretto all the time, but I always cook the alcohol out first. I recommend using 3/4 cup amaretto and boiling it in a saucepan until it is reduced to about half and you can no longer smell the alcohol. This also intensifies the flavor. Go ahead and add amaretto, corn syrup, and sugar to the milk and cream mixture and heat all together. I also add 1 tbl. almond extract just to kick up the almond flavor a bit. I use a ladle to slowly whisk and pour a bit of the hot milk mixture into the egg yolks. Two ladles is about all it takes. If you don't do this slowly enough, you'll end up with egg-flavored amaretto ice cream. It also has to very slowly be poured and whisked back in to the milk mixture. Tempering the eggs is the MOST important step in making ice cream. Follow the rest of the directions and it'll come out great! Very creamy and a nice amaretto flavor.

Excellent. Ignore the reviews below that clearly have never made ice cream before. This is a standard "French" style custard base, and therefore the number of eggs is correct. Also, don't use more alcohol than recommended, as alcohol will prevent the mixture from freezing (which is why your vodka doesn't freeze when stored in the freezer!). I thought the flavor was just fine; it shouldn't taste like you've just taken a shot, anyway. Also, if you don't use the toasted almonds, you're going to be really missing out on the flavor. This is yet another recipe where the reviews are basically "I hated it, but I didn't use this, this, or this," which baffles me, as this is chemistry. Of course, if you don't do something as the recipe says, you won't get the same results. But enough soap-boxing...enjoy the ice cream! Life is too short...

Tasted too much like egg and not enough like amaretto. Not sure if we overcooked the custard part causing the egg taste to be too strong but this receipe appears to use more egg yolks than others.

Decent but not enough Amaretto taste. I used 5 tbs but still didn't feel it was enough.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but I found that the main flavour in this was egg. When my husband tried it, he said that it reminded him of French toast. It wasn't horrible, but I have no desire to make it again.

Great flavor. If I had to change anything, I'd switch the ratios to 2 cups milk and 1 cup of cream.

Easy to make, and easier to eat! You definitely have to like Amaretto, however, cause it's strong.

This was really tasty and delicious. I left out the nuts and added an extra bit of Amaretto. Don't be dismayed if it doesn't thicken too well in the ice cream maker... Mine stayed pretty loose despite churning for quite some time. After I put it in the freezer overnight it firmed up very nicely and had a smooth texture.

This wasn't bad, but I wasn't bowled over by it. Everyone thought it was butter pecan ice cream! I followed the recipe exactly as stated, and added a touch more Amaretto. Creamy and nutty, perfect for Amaretto lovers.

Very tasty. Add a little more Amaretto if you want it to be real Amaretto-y.
