We have made this recipe for company on several occasions, and it's always a hit. It's fine to use part-skim ricotta and mozzarella. I've found that 2 large red peppers and slightly less broccoli (about 1 1/4 pounds) is plenty. Otherwise, you risk overfilling the baking dish.

i was looking for something cheesy and gooey and totally satisfying- but not too heavy- for a cold winter night. this totally hit the spot. i followed the other reviews and DID NOT use no-boil noodles. instead i used the fresh lasagna sold in the cheese section but did not cook it prior to lasagna assembly. it turned out perfectly. i also added some basil (prbly about 2T) and maybe 1T of red hot pepper flakes to the sauce...but that's just a personal preference. i used broccolini (b/c that is what they had at the market) but regular broccoli is probably just as good. and of course...i always err on the side of "too much cheese"...as if there IS such a thing. LOL. i would definitely make this again. its a good recipe to keep on hand for potlucks and get togethers with friends.

I really enjoyed this lasagna, which is surprisingly light. I substituted spinach (although I look forward to trying the broccoli) and added mushrooms. I cooked it an hour, because that is what the no-boil lasagna noodle box said, it the noodles were cooked.

This is a GREAT recipe. I usually switch the broccoli out with spinach. We don't go out for Lasagne anymore. It really is that good.

My boyfriend and I made this for his family and it was a huge hit. It's easy to make, but it takes time to chop everything.

This was very good (and the sauce was amazing), but I think that the broccoli was a bit much, and I personally happen to love broccoli. But the texture was a bit lumpy. Next time I would add spinach instead (or go with my old stand-by, the Super Fast Spinach Lasagne).

When I made this before I thought yuck, broccoli lasagne, so used spinach, but this time tried broccoli & loved it. Used about a cup more of the recipe sauce (unmilled & with added sauted diced portabello mushrooms). To previous cook with no-boil lasagne problem: I have used Barilla & Delverde no-boil with great success. Like the traditional too, but this is so much easier & seems less heavy.

No boil lasagna noodles do not work in this recipe. The noodles remained tough and undercooked, ruining the very high quality ingredients I used. I'll try it again boiling the noodles first.

With my additions, this was a real party pleaser for guests with a sophisticated palette! I used spinach, not brocolli -- just barely wilted it. I also sauteed a few chicken breasts in garlic and olive oil and chopped those up and added it in. I used the provided red sauce recipe and added red pepper flakes and a lot of red wine, garlic and mushrooms. I also decreased the parmesan and mozzerella cheeses quite a bit in the lasagna prep... I also added about a cup of fresh chopped basil in with the ricotta cheese, which I did not decrease! This needs about an hour to cook, not 30 minutes... YUM!! Will certainly add to my recipe box.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I added fresh basil to the sauce and I used a lot more sauce than 2 cups. Next time I'd like to try the suggestion for portabello mushrooms which I think would add some kick to it.

Yikes, forgot to add I baked at least 15 minutes longer as I think mine was thicker. Insert a knife in the middle & make sure it is bubbling. Also, I cooled for at least 20 minutes.

Picked this for vegetarian son & we all loved it. Sauted & added 2 large portabellos in 1" dice to the sauce(which I didn't put thru foodmill), doubled the sauce & used 3 lbs fresh spinach. Used jarred roasted red peppers. Used thinly sliced whole milk fresh mozzarella & layered over the riccota mix. Highly recommend the sauce, it is deliciously different with the sun-dried tomatoes!

After a couple of revisions, adding spinach and garlic and on a tight budget used Ragu(yes a travesty) with roasted onions and garlic. Turned out wonderful.

I loved the sauce and if I were making it again I would double it as well. Thought it might be fun to add a little chili pepper to it. I would also use a little more ricotta. My biggest problem was the no-boil noodles - not bad for every day but I wouldn't serve them to guests!

Very good. "Even without meat," my carnivore boyfriend liked it. Like other reviewers, I layered spinach in lieu of the broccoli. I made my own ricotta from April's "Cooking Light" - very easy, and better than store bought. Next time, I will add zucchini and fresh oregano, as other reviewers have done. It also needed an extra 5 mins both with and without the foil.

OK, I had to modify a few things to accommodate a lactose intolerant but this is by far the best vegetarian lasagne I have ever made. The changes I made; used tofu ricotta, roasted the peppers, added a diced zucchini to the broccoli, used an Italian sheep cheese in place of (with a similar texture to) mozzarella and used pecorino instead of parmesan. Also added fresh basil to each layer. A keeper.

We added fresh basil and sauteed mushrooms to the cheese mixture and substituted spinach for brocolli. I would make this again but add garlic and chili flakes for more heat.

I have made spinach lasagne countless times. Using the broccoli was FABULOUS! I may never go back to spinach. I really suggest you try it. I seasoned the broc. w/ salt before I steamed it, left out the red peppers (family doesn't like them) and used part skim everything. Also, made my own sauce and used at least 5-6 cups. 2 cups are not enough to cover every layer when using the no boil pasta.

I used Barilla's "Italian Baking Sauce" rather than making the sauce from scratch, and I used chopped, fresh spinach instead of broccoli. Still, I thought the recipe turned out great, and I've been eating the frozen leftovers for lunch or dinner for the past week. (I'm single, so this is what I do!)

This is just so-so and I won't make it again. To its credit, it's relatively quick and easy where lasagnes are concerned. The red pepper element wasn't my thing and I used spinach in the ricotta mix.

Unbelievably good. I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and made more sauce, and I actually ended up with enough leftover to freeze and use later. I also replaced the broccoli with spinach, and was glad I did. Also, I made it early in the day and reheated it in the oven just before our dinner party-- turned out beautifully.

I served this recipe at a dinner party and everyone seemed to like it. I followed all the suggestions for modifying the sauce (ex: using wine and basil) and lasagne (using spinach and roasted peppers) recipes. Since I was in a hurry, I used canned crushed tomatoes instead of blending the sauce. The texture and consistency were just fine.

With the various suggestions of other reviewers, this is a 4-forker. As others have suggested, use more sauce, season the sauce more (I added oregano, fresh basil and red wine), season the ricotta mixture (I used salt, pepper, fresh basil, and a dash of parmesan), roast vs sautee the peppers and use spinach instead of broccoli. This was the first time I tried the oven ready noodles, and they really worked well. I was expecting them to be hard, but they weren't. Give this a try. Was equally good reheated the next day.

This is the best lasagne that I ever made! My entire family loved it! I used baby spinach instead of the brocolli and roasted red bell peppers instead of red bell peppers. I layered the baby spinach on top of the ricotta mixture. I also heavily seasoned the ricotta mixture with garlic salt like the other reviewer did, salt, pepper, and fresh basil. I added a lot of red pepper flakes to the rich winter sauce and sugar. That really gave the sauce a kick. Also, definately use more sauce than the recipe calls for.

Yum-yum! This is a great dish for all pasta lovers. I followed the advice of others and added the wine and herbs to the sauce. It was a big hit and the no-boil pasta made preparation so easy.

This is the best lasagne I have ever had, and my carnivorous husband has requested several encores. I did change the 'green' to spinach, and I added some basil and oregano, as well as using full amount of sauce recipe. Lasagne is fairly time-consuming, but certainly better than any restaurant or *gasp* frozen lasagne available.

I made this last night and it was a big hit! I look forward to the left-overs. Here is what I varied: For the sauce, I added red wine as well as fresh basil, fresh thyme and crushed red pepper. I subsituted baby spinach and asparagus for the greens - awesome! Found I had to bake the dish for nearly an hour.

This is the best lasagne I have ever encountered! I followed the advice of other reviewers and added wine and fresh herbs to the sauce. I also used Barilla's "No-Boil" Lasagne which has a very homemade taste. All of my dinner guests raved about the lasagne and have asked for the recipe. Thank you, Epicurious!

It was very helpful to read all the suggestions. I used more sauce and also added Italian spices and lots of garlic salt to the ricotta mixture to avoid blandness. I substituted slightly steamed spinach for broccoli, which worked well, and slightly increased the amount of mozzarella and Parmesan. I also baked it slightly longer and broiled the top for a nice brown finish. Very tasty!

I made this for my in-laws last weekend, and it was a huge hit. I added quite a bit of wine, plus some basil and oregano to the sauce. I agree with others that extra sauce is good for this recipe. I would also recommend adding some seasoning to the ricotta-vegetable mixture, as the end result required a lot of salt and pepper at the table. Use a DEEP pan.

I made this for part of our family's Christmas buffet and it was delicious. I used the Rich Winter Tomato Sauce recipe and it was an excellent accompaniment. The sauce was very thick and I think lasagne was meant to have a thick sauce. I also substituted in spinach for the "green". I highly recommend this even though making the sauce takes some time.

First encountered this dish several years ago at a New Years Eve party; it was wonderfully rich and savory, a great taste. Realized I had a copy in the magazine and have made it many times since. As I like it with a little more sauce, I usually double the recipe for Rich Winter Tomato Sauce. It's the sun-dried tomatoes that seem to add to the great flavor. Don't forget to add a little red-wine to the sauce. It's a terrific recipe. Use the sauce for other things as well.

The Rich Winter Tomato Sauce recipe can be doubled and half set aside for another use. I use fresh basil in the ricotta mixture as well as lots of cracked black pepper. I've also done it in individual servings (one sheet wide) it reheats marvellously.
