Like many others experienced, this pudding never set up for me. I cooked it to exactly the right temperature and thickness and chilled it for 6 hours and it was never more than liquid. Even the next day it had not solidified into pudding consistency. Which is a shame because it tasted great. I served it anyway but without the right consistency you don't really get the layered effect. But people ate it, in ffact one of my dinner guests ended up adding it to his coffee and loved it. I also found the crunch to be a little bitter, I think due to the coffee granules. I would leave them out if I ever attempted this again, which I probably won't.

This was incredible! I had reservations and may not have tried it, had it not been for the fact that most of the negative reviews referenced the thin consistency of the pudding. Being an experienced cook with a lot of comfort with cooking desserts, custards, puddings, etc, I decided to try it. It was magnificent. The pudding set up fine (took just a few minutes longer, but not double), and the flavor was amazing and DEFINITELY tasted like Bailey's. The pudding was totally complemented by the crunch and the tang of the currants. LOVED this recipe! Something different and delicious for St Patrick's day or any time.

Amazing. Very different, fun and YUMMY dessert. I didn't read the reviews, or I would have known to cook the crunch a shorter time or lower temperature as it got too brown for my taste. But overall a success!

The custard took 30mins to get to a decent thickness, but it looked nothing like the one pictured. Others liked it but I didn't really find it that delicious.

We are dessert lovers...but found this dessert too rich though it turned out perfect...though my guests ate theirs up no problem. Need to tone down richness.

OUTSTANDING! I made this recipe - using the suggestion of high quality oatmeal cookies instead of the crunch - and although the pudding takes a while to make, this is SCRUMPTIOUS! The pudding is incredibly rich and velvety smooth, and contrasts beautifully with the crunch. A four-star winner!

This recipe was a disappointment. Like other cooks, the pudding took about twice as long as listed to thicken up. With that aside, though, the texture was a little strange and the flavor of the Bailey's was actually overpowered by the tiny amount of nutmeg in the recipe. If Bailey's is the reason you're making this recipe, I would try something else.

This recipe was not hard to make. but I could not get it to firm up at all. I will use the suggestion of serving it over berries with the crunch.

I followed the directions for the crumble and the pudding exactly. The crumble turned out great but the pudding didn't firm up. It's not enough just to cook it to 160 it needs a longer cooking time to firm up. I ended up pouring it over strawberries and topping with the crumble. It was delicious but it wasn't pudding.

Followed recipe faithfully and served this for dessert for a discriminating audience -- got rave reviews! Love do-ahead desserts. FYI, proportions for oatmeal crunch are very generous - I saved about half of it for future uses (great over ice cream). Garnished dessert with a crisp, lacey cookie. A major hit. Would definitely make again.

Made this for a St. Patrick's day desert and it was fabulous. One bit of advice,,the oatmeal crunch baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes was too high a temperature (I stirred the mixture evry 10 minutes). The first time I did the crunch burnt. However, I did repeat the mixture this time baking at about 325 degrees and continued to stir the mixture every 10 minutes. I cooked it for about 20 minutes then it was wonderful. The pudding, crunch, and currents were a super desert and will make this one again.

I made this for St. Patrick's Day (duh)and loved it. The pudding was particularly good. I thought the crunch was a little powdery. Next time I make it I will cut down on the amount of flour and use mainly oats.

Everyone at my dinner party loved this recipe! I have made it a few times and will be making it for New Year's Eve dessert this year. I found the granola burnt and substituted similar flavoured granola the next time.

This was quite excellent, though I left out currants. Simply made to satisfaction with just a regular serving topped with fabulous crumble.

This recipe needs an overhaul. Forget the crunch. Forget the currents. Take one dozen Keebler oatmeal raisin cookies, put them in a plastic bag and bang them up. There's your crunch. Decrease whipped cream to one cup and after you whip the remaining 1/4 cup, squirt in some Reddi-Whip. This lightens it up. Garnish each serving with more Reddi-Whip and voila, you have a winner!

I have made this several times. Once for a crowd of 50. I love it for a St. Patricks day desert. This is a sure keeper.

Very rich. I couldn't get mine to firm up correctly. I added more brown sugar to the crunch to mask the bitterness of the coffee.

I made just the pudding (no crunch) for a St. Patrick's Day party. I added extra Bailey's and it came out great! Several people asked for the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

Too sweet and a little heavy on the "crunch" component.My pudding mixture didn't firm up as I expected. My guests were troopers, though, and most finished their servings.

I agree...this was rich. The pudding is enough on its own without the oatmeal-walnut crunch. It is a somewhat time-consuming recipe. You have to really like pudding to spend the time on this recipe. But this is a unique dessert.

This was a showstopping way to end my St. Patrick's Day menu last year. The Bailey's pudding would even be fabulous on it's own without the work of the crunch. It's a must for this year as well.

Very rich, very good. Make sure you serve to a hungry crowd (not for delicate appetites or after a robust dinner)

I made this recipe at a family reunion. It was the star of the night! A friend of mine who cooks, and is of VERY discriminating tastes snagged my printout of the recipe to take home with him. It was delicious, and decadently rich. I am making it again this very evening!

This just did not work for me. I could not achieve the texture I needed and it was time consuming. Perhaps I mde some fundamental error but as far as I am aware I followed the recipe exactly. The flvour was good but the texture definitely was not !
