I had more oranges than we could eat-so made this and served it over ice-cream...topped the whole thing with toasted sliced almonds which i always keep on hand. A truly lovely dessert. The syrup is thin, but it mixed well with the icecream; reminded me of the old 50-50's icecream and orange sherbert mix from my (long ago) youth.Will be a great summer desert.

Made this to top the ice cream. Don't think the ice cream dessert needed it. It didn't seem to add anything. Perhaps I had too much juice. I was hoping for more of a syrup. Now the ice cream dessert---WELL! That's another rating!

Pasta sauce was cooking for our dear friends when I suddenly realized I had forgotten dessert. I ran to the computer found this. I added some chopped fresh mint and put it over frozen yogurt, I also shaved a bit of chocolate over top. It was excellent, would love to make again.
