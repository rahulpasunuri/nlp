This was a nice meal - the carrot-ginger sauce was a nice surprise, as was the simplicity of the tenderloin seasoning. Not only would make it again, but have made it again. Very nice.

Excellent, easy, fresh tasting, fun to make with your partner, healthy with an exotic feel. One of our favorites. We typically choose this for valentines day, or any evening the kids are gone. Excellent paired with a medium bodied Pac NW Pinot Noir.

Good. Simple. Carrots and ginger are a magical combination.

We make this over and over again. If you don't want the smoke do it on the grill. It will smoke. Flavors are excellent. The children and adults love it.

Had a problem with the method: the coriander seed started to scorch before the pork was done, setting off my smoke detector. I put some water in the pan and covered it, and let it finish cooking that way. The carrot-ginger sauce wasn't terrible, but didn't do much for us.

We like this one, it's tasty and not too hard to make. There is also a spice-crusted pork tenderloin with andouie sausage gravy on this site which we LOVE, but this is good for a change.

I made this over the weekend and served it as an appetizer. Added some extra red pepper to spice it up a bit. Everyone liked it, but no on raved or asked for the recipe. It seemed a bit too much like carrot soup, but I'm planning to try it again as a dinner with some interesting sides.

went down a treat with the family - especially the carrots!

Well, this was interesting. The sauce grew on you. The more of it you ate, the smoother and tastier it became. At times it tasted like a butternut squash, but had a smoother flavor. The tenderloin itself was good, but our coriander seeds may have been old. Probably a recipe we will put away and pull out again sometime, and do it again. Cut recipe quantities by one third, as we are a couple now.

The pork done in coriander seeds was gorgeous but I could've thinned my sauce a bit more as it ended up a bit like soup. Served it with the mustard seed and golden raisin rice. Lovely.

The first time we made this dish, we followed the recipe pretty much to the letter. The next time, I substituted boneless pork chops for the tenderloin, searing them first in a cast iron skillet, then finishing them in the oven. I also thought the puree needed twice the amount of ginger. Served with a potato and apple galette with sage, it was a perfect winter meal.

This recipe was delicious and very easy. I loved the coriander and puts lots of fresh ground pepper. I have made it twice in the last two weeks, and everyone who has tasted in raved about it. I, too, made the jasmine rice timbales as a side dish.

My son has made this dish several times for the family and it is now his signature meal. I don't like cooked carrots but tasted the sauce to be polite and it was excellent! Also had the jasmine rice timbale as suggested and thought it was perfect. Really a good meal. Different and delicious!

The pork was nice, not spectacular, but oh my gawd, the carrot puree!!! That is to die for! I was a little leery of the carrot part, thought that it would be too much like baby food, but no no no!!! It is the best!

I made this on Mother's Day for my mother, best friend, and her mother. The carrot ginger sauce was incredible. I had to finish the tenderloin in the oven, but it came out perfectly. The timbales were very tasty as well, and the sesame oil brought it to the next level. I will definitely make this for a dinner party.

I have made this for guests several times, each with rave reviews. We love the coriander! I think the carrot ginger sauce is labor intensive, but well worth the effort!

I found the coriander alone did not give the meat enough flavor. The presentation was beautiful though and the whole meal was a snap, so I will try it again adding a little sea salt and pepper to the coating.

The carrot/ginger sauce was tasty, but we did not like it as a meat sauce. Since I am frugal (cheap) I used up the sauce by incorporating into a packaged yellow cake mix. I now get requests for my carrot cake with ginger and walnuts.

Although the pork was very tender cooked this way, the corriander was too overpowering. Will try a different recipe next time for pork tenderloin.

I made this for company and it was a hit. The leftovers were great the next day, too. I made the rice timbales, but instead of the recommended vegetable, I sauteed yellow squash and snap peas. It was all very good.
