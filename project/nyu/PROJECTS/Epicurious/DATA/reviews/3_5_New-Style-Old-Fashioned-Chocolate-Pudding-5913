It's pretty funny to read the previous two entries-- one complaining that it's too sweet, one that it's too bitter! There's no accounting for taste... My take; it's standard chocolate cornstarch pudding, which is a good thing. (I tasted what I had in the pot before modifying the recipe) You can make it a great thing by throwing in a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips or about 1/2-1 ounce of very dark chocolate (I used 1/2 oz 85%!) to deepen the flavor and increase the fat content slightly; stir the chocolate in when you take it off the stove. I also added two eggs (stir ca. 1/4 cup hot, thickened pudding into beaten eggs, then stir in the rest of the pudding) because I like a custard mouth feel, but it really isn't essential.

i would not recommend this recipe it is horrible and it is way to sweet and made me and my family feel like puking afterwards!

I made this with 2% milk and, after stirring and stirring for about 10 minutes, I finally cranked up the heat a bit to medium high and it thickened right up. I think next time I make it, I will use a little less than 1/3 cup of cocoa or a tad more sugar because it was a bit bitter. I also used 1 tbsp of Bluebonnet margarine instead of butter since I didn't have any butter and I like a bit more buttery flavor in pudding. This adds more fat and calories but...this is pudding making...not WEIGHT WATCHERS!!! I will make this again...

I used rice milk instead of cow's milk and this worked out beautifully! At first I got scared, because it definitely did not thicken after five minutes. It was closer to ten minutes, perhaps even a bit more than that. However, when it did thicken, the result was delightful!

This pudding was okay, but not creamy or chocolaty like I was craving. It tasted like a diet subsitute for what I really wanted - which is never what you want!

This is my second review of this recipe. The second time worked like a charm with some changes: I doubled the recipe. I cut back on the cornstarch to two tablespoons per recipe {I doubled the recipe so I used a total of 4 tablespoons altogether.} I used a mixture of 1 1/2 c. 2% milk combined with 1/2 c. whipping cream. I omitted the almond extract completely because it masked the flavor of the cocoa. I substituted a total of 3/4 of a tsp. 'Gran Marnier' orange liqueur for the almond extract. It took longer for the doubled mixture to thicken up, about 25 minutes with constant whisking. It was worth all the whisking because the end result was divine!!! I didn't use expensive cacao it was Stop n-Shop brand. At the end of cooking I whisked in a a handful of Ghirardelli 60% cocoa bittersweet morsels{about 1/2c.} The results were heavenly. The texture came out thick and luscious but not too thick, much like the texture of 'Cozy Shack' brand chocolate pudding. Cozy shack is very good, but the taste of this recipe was even better though.The Gran Marnier added a very, very subtle tang. My husband raved about it with my improvements this second time around. We agreed that this would be good enough to serve to guests at a dinner party if a cookie was served on the side of it for some crunch. I love this because it's so delicious, can be made a day ahead, and easily transported. YUM!! P.S. next time I make this I might try using Chambord raspberry liqueur just for fun and for some variety of flavor.

I will be making this again! It was very quick and easy, we had nothing in the house for desert and I was craving something sweet so I made this. The only ingredient I altered slightly was the type of milk. I used a combination of 1 1/2 cups skim milk with 1/2 cup whipping cream. We were out of 2% milk as required by the recipe so I added a little of the fat back to the skim milk I used by mixing it with a little whipping cream. It worked like a dream and resulted in a rich,thick decadent pudding. Very satisfying. It had slight almond flavor due to the almond extract. I liked the almond flavor but next time I may experiment for fun and use some Chambord raspberry liqueur or other type of liquor in place of the almond extract. This is a keeper.

I'd never made homemade pudding before, and I probably won't again, at least with this recipe. The cornstarch gave the whole thing a really gummy, dully texture that wasn't at all creamy or delicate like I had hoped. I did follow the advice of some other users to throw in semi-sweet morsels at the end which I think aided texture but not quite enough to be palatable. I threw half away. Bummer.

My Grand daughter became addicted to choco pudding at Bitter Sweet, here in San Francisco. She loves to cook and bake, sooooooo...this looks like something we will make soon. Pretty easy, small amount of quality ing's and by what writers say, you can make it richer, or lighter, if you want to.

This is a delicious low fat pudding, with a very thick consistency. I may cut back a little with the corn startch the next time I make it. I sprinkled a few semi sweet chocolate chips on top while it was still hot. Great recipe.

Very tasty! I don't think it really needs the almond extract though... to me, it took away from the chocolate flavor.

I made this with soy milk, as it was all I had, and it turned out delicious. I reduced the corn starch to 2 1/2 Tblsp., but might add the full 3 next time. An easy, fairly guilt-free dessert. Served with fresh strawberries.

I love this recipe and have made it many times over the last month as the weather has gotten colder. I use the full 1/3 cup of cocoa and use non-dutch process. I use less than 1/3 cup of sugar, and skim milk, and otherwise do exactly as the recipe says. It's a winner among my friends and family!

I added 1/2 cup more milk 1/4 cup of cocoa and 1/2 cup of splenda and left out the flour we all loved it low fat low calorie if you like it real chocolately you should the 1/3 cup of cocoa

I'm surprised others don't like this! This is our standby chocolate pudding recipe and it barely takes longer than using a box. You definitely have to like cocoa flavor, but if you do, it's a winner. We almost always eat it as soon as we can after cooked, while it is still warm.

Like others said, more like a glob of jello than a creamy pudding. Perhaps leaving out some cornstarch would help, but I am on to other recipes

This pudding comes out too thick, more like jello. Perhaps 3 packed T of cornstarch is a bit much.

Great recipe! I substituted the milk with 2 small containers of unflavored, unsweetened soy milk and added 2 TBLS 1/2 & 1/2 to it and it was delicious!

This pudding really hits the spot. It was a big hit with my 7 year old (and her dad!) I live in Germany where it's easy to find great Dutch-process cocoa, I used Bensdorp. I also decreased the cornstarch to 2 Tbsp and the consistency was fine. This is an easy week-night kid-friendly dessert which I will make often.

I was very surprised at the outstanding texture and flavour of this low cal treat! I substituted one cup of the milk with buttermilk and cut back to 2TB of cornstarch...then once chilled, topped each portion with a wafer thin square of the best dark chocolate I could find...

this pudding is wonderful for lots of reasons: i. it tastes rich and wicked without the calories ii. it's great value in terms of effort - min effort, max taste, iii.you can make it anytime because you more than likely have the ingredients to hand in the pantry, iv. it's economical - so much so that you can afford to buy the best cocoa! the only adjustments would be to reduce both the quantity of sugar and cornstarch - reducing the sugar makes it not as sweet, therefore easier to eat, and reducing the cornstarch makes it much creamier. with those adjustments, this pudding then becomes a firm favourite with the family!

I also decreased the cornstarch to 2 T and the consistency was fine. The pudding had a nice flavor that did satisfy a chocolate craving and a sweet tooth without a lot of fat and calories.

I used 2Tbl. and consistency was just right. I poured some into ice-cube trays, covered in plastic wrap & inserted toothpicks for frozen pops. My daughter & husband loved it.

I've been trying to imitate Jello pudding with gelatin and cocoa and not having any success. This, however, is fabulous. Made it with splenda, because of all the bad things in nutrasweet. Two tbsp of cornstarch is just right. Now I can have my pudding and eat it too.

With 3 tablespoons of cornstarch, this pudding came out like rubber, albeit very tasty rubber!

I was pretty impressed with this pudding. I have never made pudding before but this was soooo easy and yummy. Thanks for the tip of lessening the amount of cornstarch. It was pretty thick with just 2 tbsp. of it. It's a great fix if your craving some chocolate but don't want the fat and calories that go with it.

I took the advise and also reduced the cornstarch by 1/2 TBL.,It was very good with creamy texture (I prefer to eat mine warm),and was easy to make with on hand items. A little bit too sweet,But I will be making this again soon.

This Pudding is awsome, a very nice consitancy and a minimum amount of ingredients. It was quick and easy, but has great taste. I would deffinately make this again.

Great chocolate pudding. Very easy -- I made it with my three year old. A perfect dessert for kids. A keeper for me since there are no egg yolks to temper (yay!) - I've always hated that step (I know, it's a small thing, but so annoying.) The almond extract is a nice touch.

My whole family enjoys this ( three sons and husband).When I'm craving creamy chocolate without the tast of preservatives, I make this. It's so easy and within a half hour ( includes chilling) you are eating it! I double the recipe because it's never enough. I also decrease sugar and cornstarch and it's still great.Made it about five times in two weeks!

I've made this pudding again, and again, and again! Always a hit. I reduced the cornstarch by 1/2 tablespoon, though--it was too solid with all 3 tablespoons. I also reduced the sugar, because it was a little too sweet. A wonderful low-fat dessert, much better than the mix, and no aspartame!

This pudding was too sweet for my tastes. Also, I should have taken the advice to reduce the amount of cornstarch. It was way too thick.

This recipe is LOVED by my whole family. I could make it every day, and they never get tired of it.

I made this pudding with whole milk rather than low-fat and it still tasted anemic. Maybe the addition of one egg yolk would help. For someone who eats lots of low-fat dishes it might not be lacking that custardy taste, but don't expect it to taste like real chocolate pudding.
