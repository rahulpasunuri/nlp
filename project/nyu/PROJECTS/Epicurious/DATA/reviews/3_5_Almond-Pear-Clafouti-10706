PERFECTION. The only change I made, was for my own convenience. I sautéed the pears in a bit of butter and sugar, then flambeed with a shot of brandy. Then set them aside to cool. Then I made the batter stopping short of adding the blur and sugar so I could have everything ready ahead of time to top the pears and pop it in the oven after my roast came out. Timing was perfect. EVERYONE loved the dessert, even the kids and the chocolate lovers.

I enjoyed this recipe vary much...although i did use a 1/2 cup of flour instead of 3/4. This recipe was a hit at my grandfathers birthday and everyone was so inpressed that i could make it. i would definitely make this again for all my freinds and family. :)

I made this recipe today, exactly per instructions. The flavor was outstanding and sophisticated (4 forks), but the texture was cake- like and dense (2 forks). WAY TOO MUCH flour. I questioned the flour amount in the recipe since the batter turned out more like pancake batter than custard batter. Next time I will decrease the flour to 1/3 cup to improve the texture. After all, clafouti is not a cake, but a custard. When substituting cream or half-and-half for milk, be sure to reduce the amount of flour even more since both of these liquids are denser than plain milk. It is always a good idea to initially make the recipe as written, that way you know the error is in the recipe and not in your ingredients. Afterwards you can change the recipe to suit your taste.

I used 1/2 stick of butter and made brown butter while melting it for a nuttier flavor. I substituted the almonds for 1/2 cup of almond meal (available at Trader Joe's) and because I did it in a large rectangular baking dish, it only needed 30-35 min cooking time. So good.

I love this recipe. It's particularly good with fresh homemade whipped cream. I've adjusted the recipe a little and think it's better. Instead of milk I use heavy cream. I also use 1 teaspoon of vanilla and almond extract.

I agree about the over-the-top substitutions.It's one thing to change the fruit, but why substitute cream for milk? Or leave out entirely the baking powder (even if this isn't usually in a clafouti, it's in this one, so leaving it out is going to change things).

I've used a Food and Wine recipe in the past and was looking to duplicate that. As an earlier review suggested, less flour might make it more custardy. When I've made it in the past, the mixture had seemed to separate and form more of a crust on the bottom and custard on the top. I liked this but, it wasn't what I'd call a clafouti.

All in all, this is a pretty good clafouti recipe. I wholeheartedly agree with the cook from California. Please do not complain about a recipe if you are going to change everything about the recipe. In case you didn't know, baking is a science! Don't substitute if you don't know what you're doing and then complain about the result!

It's a bit ridiculous to rate recipes negatively after making several significant substitutions. Does this annoy anyone else? Maybe I'm being petty, but it does throw off the rating, which is heavily considered by most.

OK - I have been wanting to make a clafouti for some time - after checking all the different recipes, I chose this one, for one reason because you all gave it such high reviews. And, I expected a "custard" type product not a "cake" type texture. I am very disappointed to say the least. I too used heavy cream instead of milk - also I did not have self-rising flour (which I assume means it has baking poweder?) I used plain flour and went on with the rest of the recipe - oh, I used peaches which I sliced instead of the pears. Well, I am so disappointed. Like I said it is a cake and a clafouti shoudl have a custard consistency. I checked a lot of recipes on different sites and this one had the greatest amount of flour and that is probably one reason why it came out like cake and not custard. Did any of you feel the same way about the outcome? And, the taste was nothing to brag about either. I will try out other clafouti recipes which are more like custards and have very little flour. Too bad.

I made this dish for some friends visiting from Europe. They were blown away. I baked them in large individual ramekins and they came out beautifully. I served it with a drizzle of heavy cream for extra indulgence and it was perfect!

I made this for Mother's Day for the first time. Now, it seems that everyone wants me to make for every occasion. It is truly awesome when warm served with homemade whipped cream--the best part of the meal.

This recipe is very easy to make and ideal for company. I serve it with a heavy cream sweetened with a bit of sugar and vanilla. It's definitely better served warm. Delicious!

This has been a terrific hit at dinner parties. Toasting the almonds gives added depth, and I really packed in the pears and used a bare minimum of sugar and instead served it with a drizzle of homemade caramel sauce. Wonderful! Be sure to toss the peeled pears in lemon juice to prevent browning and add a bare hint of tartness to offset the sweet.

It tasted great! It was rich in butter and almond flavor and the pear was so tender and sweet. I used whole blanched almonds and used the food processor. I also used whipping cream instead of milk. It smelled very good and everybody loved it!

Loved it! I forgot to add some whipped cream for a topping, but the clafouti was wonderful without it. It doesn't quite taste the same reheated the next day, so better to serve it all in the original sitting. I did not alter the recipe at all. I used "fake" almond extract and did not find that it was too strong. This is definately a keeper. It made the whole house smell good.

This was a wonderful warm dish to cozy up to on a cold Thanksgiving afternoon! Sweet, tender and then the almonds give a little crunchy texture - heaven! Still tasted great as a leftover or cold out of the fridge. I followed the recipe exactly.

Very, very good. I used heavy cream instead of milk, and a total of 4 eggs. I also used unblanched almonds and liked the color, omitted the almond extract, tripled the amount of vanilla, and added 1/4 tsp allspice. I baked them in individual pie pans (which really must be _well_ buttered) for 15 min at the said temperature, and they were great--very soufflee-like and tasty, though not overwhelmingly pear-flavored. Powdered sugar on top is the only adornment they need.
