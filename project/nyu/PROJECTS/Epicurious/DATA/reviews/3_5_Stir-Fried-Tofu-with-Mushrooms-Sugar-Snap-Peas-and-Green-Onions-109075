this is delicious - and so easy! you don't even need to add the water and cornstarch. (i didn't have cornstarch, so tried without that and the water). it tastes great! also subbed broccoli for peas, and used button mushrooms.

Fabulous & Healthy! Both my husband and I LOVED this dish and will now include it among the dishes I make most often. I doubled the sauce and cornstarch and omitted the water because we both like highly flavored food. I also dusted the marinated and drained tofu with cornstarch before browning. That really keeps it from sticking and helps form a nice crust. It was amazingly good!

Great tofu recipe. Didn't require much "fuss" and tastes great! I left out the onions just because my husband does not like them.

Best tofu recipe I've found. I followed others' advice of cooking the tofu for 4 minutes instead of 2, and doubling the sauce. My main improvisation was to add in cooked soba noodles at the end. I also substituted baby bok choy and yellow bell pepper for the vegetables, and tossed in toasted peanuts. BF and I couldn't get enough.

I followed others' advice on this recipe and doubled the amount of the marinade. This turned out delicious! I didn't have sugar snap peas or green onions, so I used red pepper and white onions instead, and it turned out remarkably well. Also, no honey, so I used maple syrup. My husband loved it..had thirds! This is a good recipe that will definitely be made again. I served it over white rice, although it being an Asian dish, I can see it being served over jasmine rice too.

Tofu and mushrooms - neither ingredients I love. Yet, with some tofu to use up, decided to try this recipe. We loved it. Didn't give it a 4 forks, because, for me, these are not great ingredients, but still excellent for a healthy family meal. Added some nuts for crunch. As others wrote, could also use meat, such as chicken, with the same sauce, with or without tofu. Also, as others suggested, need to have substance to tofu. I used extra-firm and dried and pressed out liquid as much as possible.

This was the first tofu meal I've ever made and it was AWESOME. I served it over white rice that I steamed in a cooker with garlic. Made great leftovers too, I'll be making it again.

This is delicious! I have yet to find a stir-fry sauce at home that works as well as this one. My secret to great tofu texture is to drain the tofu then freeze it. You can store it in the freezer as long as needed and then thaw it before cooking. It comes out firm and delicious!

Rating: 4
Really nice. Be sure to cook the tofu longer than directed so that you really carmelize it for deeper flavor. I used pre-cooked greenbeans I had on hand with a handful of cabbage, instea of the sugar snap peas. As others suggested, it helps to add a little more soya sauce or other "brown" asian sauces just before dumping the sauce with the cornstarch. I used 1/2 tsp of black bean sauce, but you could use oyster sauce or more soya, or even a chili paste. I'm saving this one!

Rating: 4
This recipe fit the bill perfectly for ingredients I had just brought home from our Chinese market. I had never seen such exquisite fresh shiitake before, and was searching for a recipe worthy of them. This certainly was the one. My only change was to double the sauce, as others suggested, and to sub some spicy black bean sauce for a portion of the soy. I ate 2/3 of this dish for a sumptuous dinner and had the rest, reheated in the microwave, for next day's lunch. Very authentic flavors.

Rating: 4
I keep returning to this as my staple tofu recipe (without the vegetables). Even when I do not preplan, I fry the tofu for 2 min. each side and then add the dressing and simmer the tofu so it absorbs the flavors, turning the heat down enough that the honey does not carmelize. But it is the best when marinated and breaded!

I always marinate my tofu in the sauce and then bake it while the rice cooks. I then toss it onto the stirfry at the last minute. I also replace the vinegar and honey with mirin. I like the flavour better. Sometimes I use half chicken and half tofu. I always double the sauce and always use way more vegetables.

Rating: 0
Excellent! I recommend getting as much water as possible out of the tofu before marinating. To do this: pat tofu dry, wrap in paper towels, and place it on top of a cloth towel with a heavy plate over it (you can leave it this way for hours,even store in the refrigerator overnight). I agree that the tofu is better when marinated overnight. Next time I will make a fresh batch of the sauce for the stir fry, since the sauce on my veggies was not nearly as flavorful as the marinade -- the tofu seemed to soak up most of the flavor. (I would use a double batch of sauce for the tofu and another double batch for the stir fry, especially if serving over rice.) I used peanut oil because of the high temp, too, and sprinkled corn starch on the tofu before frying which worked great -- thanks to others for the tips!

Love it! This is an excellent marinade for tofu or tempeh. Tried the original version and then modified as follows: used tempeh instead of tofu, replaced peas with napa cabbage, red peppers, asparagus, zucchini, carrots and broccoli, added cooked rice noodles to the veggies. I like my version more than the original recipe.

I followed this to a T and we really liked it. My only advice is that if you, like us, are not planning to eat it with anything 'carby', make twice as much of it because you will be staring at an empty wok with a rumbly tummy if you don't. Maybe needs more red pepper for my taste. As for nutrition info, don't you know what you buy at the grocery store? Read the package. I don't consider it Epicurious' job to tell me what's in my food when I'm the one cooking it!

Very light and tasty dish. You can substitute any "protein" (chicken, shrimp, etc.) for the tofu if you'd like. Definitely double the sauce especially is you are serving this with rice. Makes a nice 4-serving amount...we'll be making this dish over and over again. (BTW, I didn't have any peas, so I substituted red/green peppers and it worked well.)

Rating: 3
I thought this was really tasty and would definitly recommend some of the modifications suggested earlier; namely, doubling the sauce but reducing the soy sauce and increasing the honey as it was too salty for me. The cornstarch trick on the tofu worked great, but I found the crispiness dissapeared after I returned the tofu to the fry pan and added to marinade. Next time I won't bother mixing the tofu with all the veggies and just add it to the plates when serving.

Rating: 3
Delicious! I followed the directions fairly closely...had to mix portabello mushrooms and shiitake to have enough mushrooms for the recipe. I will try dredging the tofu in corn flour next time. Also, will make more marinade. The marinade had a nice kick to it (I may have added a little more red pepper out of habit). Added sesame seeds as well. Served with rice. Even my husband, who doesn't love tofu, gobbled it up!

Rating: 3
I thought this was a really nice dish and the sauce/marinade was great. I omitted the mushrooms as we didn't have any (and bf doesn't like them). Instead used snowpeas, brocoli, red capsicum, carrot and bok choy. I pressed the tofu between paper towel and weighted plates while I was cutting the veges and this short time seemed fine. I also lightly dredged the tofu in cornflour before stirfrying it to get in more crispy as per previous reviews and thought that was a good step. I added fresh rice noodles at the end and my boyfriend (who had been complaining about tofu) and I both really enjoyed it - he had seconds and took the rest to work! Quick, healthy weekday meal.

Rating: 4
I made this dish the first time as the recipe dictated and loved it so much I wanted to make it for my boyfriend. The second time around, I substisuted tofu with 16 oz. stif-fry cut chicken. After seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper, I sauteed it in a few tablespoons of corn oil. I then marinaded the cooked product in 1.5 times the recommended marinade. I used mushrooms and snow peas for veggies. It was better the second time and he went back for seconds!! And yes, more honey, less soy sauce is the way to go on the marinade! Also, garlic press works very well at getting a great flavor from the garlic.

Rating: 3
Yum Yum Yum. I'm always looking for new recipes to use tofu - this one is very good. It's a little time consuming if you follow some of the other rater's tips - coating the tofu in cornstarch before frying does help. Will definitely make again, will use whatever stirfry vegetables I have around...

This recipe is so good that my Dad, who was planning on having hot dogs for dinner when he heard the menu and who, given his druthers, would never eat tofu wants to learn to make it. I made quite a few substitutions for the veggies -- bell peppers of various colors, broccoli, and carrots (I'm allergic to mushrooms and snow peas are hard to find here), but the sauce/marinade is what makes this recipe and it's great. Also, I used extra light olive oil which works great for high heat stir frying and is so much better for you. I added walnuts cooked in soy sauce from another Epicurious stir fry recipe which added great texture. Finally, I followed Hampton's advice and my tofu turned out fabulous!

De-friggin-licious. So glad a (I think way) earlier chef gave the tofu-tip; if you sprinkle your tofu with cornstarch after marinading but before pan-frying they come out amazingly crisp and perfect-- I'm definitely going to try that secret for all my tofu recipes! Oh, and since I'm on a budget I used half shitake and half crimini mushrooms and it still comes out wonderful.

Delicious recipe with the following adjustments. Pressed tofu block to remove excess moisture (between 2 plates with heavy can on top, removed about 1/2 cup of liquid. This makes browning much quicker.) Coated tofu with cornstarch before browning. Also, reduced soy sauce to 2 T and increased honey to 1 1/2 T.

This was very good. I marinated the tofu for two days(it wasn't my original intention, but it turned out great). I added red bell peppers, mostly for color. I used toasted peanut oil in place of vegetable oil, which gave a nice added flavor. I also sprinked cashews on the finished product. I didn't do this, but I thought a sweet spicy drizzling sauce would be nice served at the table, it just seemed to need a little oomph. Overall, it was beautiful and delicious.

Great recipe!. I followed other suggestions and let tofu marinate for several hours. Substituted broccoli and red pepper slices for snap peas which made for a colorful presentation. Definitely a keeper.

This is really a fantastic recipe--not too difficult and extremely tasty. I would suggest letting the marinade soak into the tofu for longer than the recipe calls for, though, and I might add more cornstarch next time as it made a very thin sauce. I also found trimming the peas to be far too time consuming to merit the effort, and those peas that I put in whole were in fact more interesting texturally.

This was excellent! I think my favorite part was the sauce. I used to eat tofu marinated in a sauce very similar from a cafe at work, but didn't know what was in the sauce besides soy. I was very excited when this sauce tasted the same! I can't wait to make it again!

for a variation followed the marinade etc. but i substituted 3/4 lb.cubed chicken breast,6 oz. white mushrooms, 1 red pepper, 1 large zuchinni, 1 red onion sliced. to add some zip i added 1 TBS. hoisin sauce towards the end and garnished with a chiffonade of cilantro. i served this dish with white rice. i highly recommend you try a variation with your favorite meat or seafood, veggies and condiment. also recommended is shrimp with teriyaki sauce, and cashews on this site.

This is a keeper! This miraculous recipe and all the helpful reviews actually had my typically-anti-tofu husband taking seconds and even saying he wouldn't object to my making it again. Being new to "tofu world", but wanting to use it more regularly, as I attempt to radically and aggressively improve our diets, I found most helpful the reviews that suggested squeezing out as much liquid as possible from the tofu before preparing it. I feel this really helped brown the cubes better, although it took much longer than the 2 minutes. I, too, doubled the marinade and I also stir fried along with snow peas( instead of snap peas) a red bell pepper cut into 1" pieces, some fresh broccoli, some parboiled baby carrots, halved lengthwise, and half a bag of fresh baby spinach. When adding the green onions, I also sprinkled on some unsalted cashews. Served it all on brown rice and it was truly a beautiful and incredibly tasty dish, not to mention extremely versatile and healthy.

I really liked this. I used snow peas instead of sugar snap, and I didn't have enough of those or of the mushrooms, so I filled out with some green pepper and zucchini to make the total of 14 ounces of vegetables. Great flavor. Really looked beautiful when finished, especially with the scallion garnish. I served it over brown rice. I think I might try this some time for company but substitute chicken, pork, or shrimp for the tofu. Or I'll definitely try the trick of coating the tofu with cornstarch to get it to brown better. I've also heard that you can bake the tofu first, and that will get rid of some of the moisture, which would also make it brown better. Does anyone know the best way (oven temperature, length of time, type of pan, covered or not covered, etc.) to bake a block - or cubes - of tofu for this purpose?

This was just ok. I made a few changes, added broccoli and plain old mushrooms instead of the snap peas and shitake. I tried the trick of dipping the tofu in cornstarch; didn't work that well for me. oh well, back to the drawing board...hopefully I'll find a more exciting tofu stir fry recipe.

A great meatless weeknight dinner, and definitely a recipe to convert someone who would never consider cooking tofu! It also stands up to a lot of changes - I used neither rice vinegar nor sesame oil; peanut oil for frying; and different vegetables.

The only problem I had was with my tofu crumbling a bit as I fried it...anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with that?

I liked this recipe because it's fairly simple and low-stress to cook. I fried the tofu for 8 minutes to get it brown all around.

Super fast and tasty. I would absolutely add more vegetables next time, just felt it was overpowered by the tofu. I used organic pea shoots instead of snow peas; they were delicious. I would also fry the tofu longer next time, not every piece was "golden brown" after 3 minutes and the golden brown pieces had a crispier, firmer texture...much more palatable than mushy tofu. This is going to become my new favorite fast lunch.

This is the first time I have ever cooked tofu and couldn't believe how easy it was. Great flavor, wonderful receipe.

A terrific last-minute supper, esp if you keep tofu and frozen veggies on hand. Have made this four times now -- biggest change made is to increase vegetables (14 oz frozen sugar snap peas + 8 oz regular sliced mushrooms + 1 small onion + 8 oz frozen red/yellow/green pepper strips) and replace fresh ginger with ginger juice. To my taste, even with more vegetables, marinade proportion is exactly perfect. Will also try with chicken or shrimp ... though the tofu is really good. ++++++++ BTW: I'm with a previous review on providing nutrition information. I really wish the magazine would provide COMPLETE nutrition info and on EVERY recipe.

To the cook in North Carolina--I have worked with tofu plenty in the past, and a great way to get it crispy is as follows: press the tofu to remove most of the liquid (it helps if the tofu is extra firm), cut it into cubes and then simply shake it in a bag with some corn starch. Dust off the extra corn starch and cook the cubed tofu in very hot oil until LIGHTLY browned. The tofu will have a nice crispy texture. I hope this helps

I found this recipe somewhat bland. Next time I'd add more ginger and more garlic. I also added rice, to give it a bit more consistency, which definately was a good decision. Fry the tofu a bit longer so it becomes firmer, and the recipe is ideal . . . Quick, simple, good weeknight meal.

I used string beans (cut into 1-inch pieces) instead of sugar snap peas to save a little bit of money, since fresh shiitakes can be a little pricy.

This was good but I thought the flavor of the tofu was a bit bland and I will marinate overnight next time I make this. I also used peanut oil because of the high heat and probably a bit more than the recipe called for. If you like spicy foods it could also use a bit more heat, try adding additional red pepper flakes. All in all this was a good combination of flavors.

Delicious and easy. Both my husband and I loved it, and good tofu recipes are hard to come by. The only modifications I made were as follows: I drained the tofu in a colander under a heavy can for a few minutes first; used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil because of the high heat, and added strips of red pepper at the same time as the sugar snaps for color. I also had to add a bit more oil after the mushrooms because they absorbed all the oil.
