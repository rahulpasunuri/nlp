I had to add a bit more balsamic vinegar for my taste, but my ratios could have been off as well. I also added some small cubes of hard, french gouda.

This is a fabulous recipe. The dressing is unusual and memorable. I've been serving it for years and ALWAYS receive raves from guests. It doubles easily.
