I used boneless rib eye and marinated it for just under two hours, then cooked it in a cast iron skillet. Otherwise, I followed the rest of the recipe and found each element wonderful. The red onions were first soaked in cold water in the refridgerator for about half a hour, patted dry, then soaked in meyer lemon juice (I have a tree) and salt for an hour. I'll try with a few more vegetables next time.

this tasted very weeknight to me. Not bad, not great. Just fine. the aioli is tasty though. the marinade was ok. served with green chile hash brown. That's always a winner.

Very good. I think the salad would work with cucumbers or other assorted veggies if you don't like mushrooms.

I only did the steak and used Stout dark beer. I marinaded it for 24 hours and it was great, tender and very tasty. I will use this one again.

My husband and I loved this recipe. Very simple and relatively quick. Even great for leftovers, which I doubted because I thought the lettue would wilt.

Great recipe, however the red sherry vinegar in the mushrooms was a bit too strong of a flavor. Sort of over took the dish. I added sliced avocado to the salad which made it even more amazing. Also did not marinate meat for 8 hour but instead let it marinate for 30 and cooked in the marinade on the stove. Truned out very flavorfull and juicy.

I cut this recipe in half for my husband and I. It was so good. I forgot to bring out the aioli sauce from the refrigerator until after we were cleaning up, and it didn't matter. The marinade is wonderful and could be used on many other meats... london broil or flank steak. The salad was great and with the excess liquid, we dipped our steak. The only exception was that I left the red oinions out. I soaked some cut red onion in the lemon juice to get the flavor, but then just poured the lemon juice into the meal and threw out the onions. The shallots provided plenty of "onion" flavor.

Hot diggity, the marinade really transforms this inelegant cut of meat into something quite wonderful. (Admittedly, I did my own thing with the salad, with what I had lurking in the 'fridge). Would definitely make this again.

I prefer to not review things that I did not follow the recipe exactly, however, I made a mistake in cooking this dish that I don't believe interferes with the rating. I ran behind and wound up marinating it about 2 hours short of the recommended time, and I changed the aioli sauce after I made it as written. I assembled the marinade and found that it was fairly strong and had plenty of liquid to cover the meat(next time I will use less garlic). I assembled the chipotle "dressing" at that time and my husband and I both found it too mayonaisey for our liking so I altered it before serving. I made the mushrooms and onions as written, however, my guests and I did not like the onions very much and wound up leaving them out because the onion aroma was a tad strong (I wasn't going to eat it anyway, I don't like raw onions). I served the sliced steak over the mixed greens tossed with the mushrooms and topped with the chipotle aioli. It was SUPER good, everyone cleaned their plates. 2 lbs. of skirt steak was plenty for 5 servings. This would make a nice lunch in the summer for a casual gathering, but it was very satisfying as a winter-night meal, too.

I rarely rate anything 4 forks, but this gets one. Everyone at the table exclaimed over this, even my kids who aren't that keen about meat. Followed the recipe almost exactly. Used low fat mayonaise, which worked well. Did not find raw onions overwhelming at all, after sitting in the lemon juice. Added grape tomatoes to the salad, and used run-of-the-mill muchrooms. I alos thought this was very quick to do, aside from all the marinating, the actual slicing and cooking was very fast. Definitely will make again!

This was rated by my guests as "the best meal (they) ever had." I substituted chipotle mustard rather than using the grain mustard and chipotle peppers...paired with a big red wine and cracklin corn bread as a side.

Although it was time consuming, this recipe was worth it!

Oh boy, this is good! The dressing is delicious on its own as a dip, etc. etc. We made this for a solstice party and all of our friends loved it. Although it is quite a bit of work, all of the components can be made ahead and assembled while you grill the steak. Beer or a nice, big red wine are good to wash this down.

This is just delicious. The combination of flavors and textures works beautifully. I especially enjoyed the chipotle aioli and the red onions. We have just started grilling skirt steak since we discovered mail order from Allen Brothers. It has been extremely flavorful and tender every time.

Going to try this tonight. For the Ann Arbor cook: Did you marinate the flank steak? You really need to in order to soften it up. An overnight marinade of soy sauce and oil ( chili, canola, etc. ) will work wonders.

I haven't tried this recipe. However I recently tried skirt steak for the first time and found it to be extremely dry and chewy. I grilled it medium and cut it across the grain. Any idea what went wrong?

This is a fabulous recipe. I have prepared it several times without any modifications and it has always been a great success. Don't be put off by the raw onions; the salt and lemon juice virtually cook them and they add a delicious, mild flavor and a nice crispness to the salad.

My partner and I loved this salad; we ate it with an inexpensive merlot. I roasted red potatoes and shallots to make the salad more substantial; the aioli complimented these additions as well. I skipped the red onions and lemon, as I can't tolerate raw onions. I also skipped the oil and vinegar at the end of the mushroom saute. For the aioli, I added some reduced fat sour cream to add creaminess, not fat. I may try it with less mayo and more sour cream next time. I plan to serve this to friends in a couple of weeks. Very good.

I also found this a great way to serve skirt steak. It needed the greens to balance everything out. I served tortillas with guacamole and sour cream rolled up on the side. I used dried reconstituted chipotle peppers and the aioli was FABULOUS - I had a ton of aioli left over so spread it on chicken thighs the next night and baked it. YUMMMMM....

I loved the marinade and the chipotle was good, I just felt like the whole salad was more work than it was worth.

I made this for my mom's birthday. The Chipotles were hard to find but it was possible in CT. Pittsburgh, on the other hand where I go to school, was not that easy. I would make it again. the aioli sauce is flavorful, zesty and colorful. The dressing on the salad was excellent.

Great recipe, I made one enchancement that makes it that much better: buy some dried chipotle peppers, soak them in warm water for 1 hour, puree, then add to the rest of the aioli ingredients. Your reward for hunting down the peppers will be paid off tenfold!

I happened to pick up a couple of pounds of skirt steak that had been marked down to half-price to move it off the shelf at the local supermarket. This was perfect for this cut of meat, especially using it in the marinade. I will never understand why they price this cut of meat so expensively. I used it in this recipe and was delighted with the results. I used fresh crimini and shiitaki mushrooms. The mushrooms make this a delicious recipe. I could not find Sherry wine vinegar at the local stores and had to settle with white wine vinegar with a little balsamic added.

This was a suprise. It was quite good. It just seemed like an unlikely combination, but it really worked! Don't make it if you don't like thousand island dressing. My husband is not a big fan of it but he loved it because the Chipotle Pepper gave it a great "Kick"!

This is very good, although the aioli sort of tastes like 1000 Island with spice. We used strip steaks and button mushrooms (trying to use up stuff in the fridge). Assorted mushrooms would be yum! Easy!

Easy, tasty, and fast. Buen provecho and "Ita dakimas!"
