I had difficulty with the caramel sauce. The first time I tried, it crystallized. I had the perseverance to try again, but it did not yield spectacular results. The coffee seemed to lend a slightly bitter taste, even though I'm sure the caramel wasn't burnt. More importantly, the sauce was quite thin, and not like a traditional ice cream topping.
