My family LOVED this recipe. It was so creamy and delicious. I made it as described but added the chicken/mushroom suggestion on top for a bit of protein as suggested by lvalverde. It was so much easier to add all liquid at once and just stir once in a while. I found that it made 10 servings.

Eh--it's really a 2 and a half fork review. And I didn't want to feel that way. I looked forward to making the recipe even after my husband brought me a Jacques Pepin cookbook after work and thought I might enjoy making something from that. This just didn't click, though. The squash took much longer to cook than the recipe said and we both thought it was still a tad underdone. I served the risotto with a chicken paillard--maybe I was in in a need-protein mood, but that seemed to give a needed kick. My husband liked it better than I did, but I'm not sure he'll miss it if I don't make it again.

This was wonderful. I made it exactly as written with two modifications. 1. I cut the recipe in half. 2. I didn't add the cream. It wasn't needed. I was skeptical about using this method to cook risotto, but the end product was the most creamy risotto I've ever made.

It was fabulous and the hit of the dinner party. One dinner guest said it was the best risotto that she ever had. Thank you epicurious.com. btw, I read some of these other reviews and they all mentioned leaving out this or that, or substituting ingredients. If you did not make the published recipe, how can you comment upon it?

This is delicious! I roasted the butternut squash first but put it in as stated in the recipe and it was a very nice texture. I used a little more blue cheese because I love it but otherwise would not change a thing.

Rating: 4
This was a huge dinner party hit. I made it the "traditional" way (adding about a cup of broth at a time and stirring until absorbed, instead of all the broth at once) and found that I only needed about five cups of broth to get beautifully creamy al dente rice. Even the people who don't care for blue cheese loved that addition. Will definitely make again.

This is delicious. I think if you are making it the traditional way (adding the broth gradually) you can easily omit the cream. I served it for dinner with apple slices, everyone loved it and it was really simple to prepare!

I should add that I did not use any blue cheese as I do not much care for it and still thought the recipe was fantastic and very flavorful/complex. Your mileage may vary.

A delicious recipe, though I had some tweaks: I roasted the squash beforehand and then sauteed it on medium high with some sliced mushrooms, then removed the veg from the pan. Added in the onion and garlic, sauteed, added the rice and then the wine (with plenty of butter + olive oil in the pan beforehand) before adding in about 3 cups of the broth. I then allowed it to absorb before adding more, rather than dumping it in all at once. When it was just about finished, I folded in the cooked vegetables and baby spinach before adding the cheese and cream. Delicious, and a big hit--even my squash-hating boyfriend had seconds!

Rating: 4
Very tasty, makes more than you expect and while it can be sufficiently filling as a main course, one may need a to add little protein, as other reviewers have noted. I'm going to make it this weekend as a side to a beef roast. But this is really a favorite of mine and an easy one pot dish.

This was extremely flavorful. We made a few modifications. Since I was cooking for two, and love blue cheese I halved the recipe - but used nearly 1/2 cup of blue cheese. Instead of sprinkling the cheese on top at the end, I melted-it-in before adding the cream & parmesean. Stirred-in the spinach last. We felt it needed protein (as others have suggested). In a separate pan, we sauteed 2 small cubed chicken breasts, with 8oz of sliced baby bella mushrooms - until most of the water evaporated from the mushrooms. To the meat mixture, we then added 4 oz (6 slices) of chopped pancetta. Just before the pancetta was finished, we added 1 large clove of pressed garlic and a bit of black pepper. The meat mixture needs no salt. We served the risotto in a flat, shallow bowl and topped it with a spoon of the meat mixture. Every bite of the risotto was incredibly rich and tasty. This recipe offers an excellent balance of flavors.

Yummm! This risotto is delicious! I used a ready-diced mix of butternut squash and sweet potatoes, frozen spinach (defrosted in the microwave and drained), and Danish blue cheese (a lot more than the recipe called for hehe). I also used a lot more wine and added vegetable broth one cup at a time. Turned out really great!

Rating: 3
This was delicious. I would rate closer to a 3.5. I want to make a few minor changes next time, but the taste and the texture was great. Would have been super simple if I had found chopped butternut squash at the store, but not the end of the world to chop myself. I think pancetta would be a nice addition.

Rating: 3
Thought this was easy and a good winter evening meal. Followed the broth-adding directions in the recipe; the rice could have been a bit more al dente, but overall worked out fine. i substituted sage for the rosemary and used tuscan kale in place of the spinach. The blue cheese is essential, both for flavor and for salt and tang. I will try this again using the more traditional "cup at a time" stock addition method to see if i can get the texture perfect.

Loved this recipe. I made it as is...except used the traditional way of adding the stock a little at a time. The butternut squash was tender and delicious. It's rich and plentiful...I used less cream and would use even less again. It was creamy on it's own!

This was really good. I used my pressure cooker, which means I can quickly have risotto every week (and do!). I used frozen squash, and the chunks mostly disintegrated, but it just added to the creamy texture. I cut the amounts mostly in half and had enough for two for dinner and leftovers for lunch.

Rating: 2
Eh. I was excited to make this because of all the great reviews, but it wasn't really anything special. I did make a few changes - made it the traditional way rather than adding the broth all at once, used sage instead of rosemary, added roasted walnuts, garlic, and a bit of nutmeg, and used fat free half and half at the end, but it was just so dense and heavy and the butternut squash flavor was kind of lost. Used a really creamy gorgonzola that deserved better. I also only used 1 1/2 cups of risotto, thinking it would make enough for dinner for two for two nights but it made a TON - I have a vat leftover in the fridge that I am not super excited to have to eat tonight. It definitely needs a protein, and could use another texture, and something with a bit of brightness to contrast the heaviness and richness of the dish. Overall, would not make this again. There are better butternut squash recipes out there and better risotto recipes out there.

I must emphasize the blue cheese here. soooo good. numerous friends that don't like blue cheese, including my fiance, thought it went perfectly and was delicious (make sure it is a yummy blue cheese). I followed the recipe exactly including the all at once broth technique. However, unlike others, it took much longer to cook. I checked it starting at 15 mins, but ultimately after adding several new 1/2 cups of broth, I think it took over 30 min to cook to nice fully cooked yet firm risotto. made about 12-14 side dish servings.

Just made this tonight... and I had to come on and say how delicious this was! Even my fiance who does not generally like blue cheese loved it and came back for seconds. I made a few changes as I went along. 1) I halfed the recipe (it's just the two of us), and we have a decent amount of leftovers. 2) I omitted the whipping cream, as I thought it would be too heavy, and I doubled the amount of wine in the beginning. 3) I added a clove of garlic when I added the rosemary and squash to get some depth of flavor. I don't know if it made a difference, but the end product was perfect. 4) I made the risotto the traditional way and ended up needing 4 cups (for half of the recipe) of vegetable broth (I'm vegetarian.) Great recipe that we'll definitely make again!!

This had divine flavor. I didn't have spinach on hand, but I would have welcomed the additional flavor and texture. Truly a must with the blue cheese - simply not the same without it.

Great recipe! I found pre-cubed, organic squash, which worked out well. I also followed the directions and added all of the stock at the same time and I thought the result was really good. If you like your risotto al dente, then you'd probably want to use the more traditional method. I thought the flavor was fantastic. I served this with pork chops and will definitely make it again. Note - makes a lot more than 4 servings!

I followed the instructions exactly. I don't think the blue cheese is necessary. This dish is flavorful enough without it.

This was really good. I hate to say it, but I did make a couple of changes. I could not bear putting all of the broth in at once, so I did it the traditional 1/2 cup at a time way. I also eliminated the cream, it was not needed. Everything else combines perfectly and is delicious.

Rating: 3
Loved the flavor combination, but this was incredibly rich. I will definitely leave out the cream next time - I think it's either that or the blue cheese, and I love blue cheese too much to leave it out or cut it down! I too was skeptical and went with the traditional risotto cooking method rather than pouring all the broth in at once. I also added crumbled bacon at the very end, which was just the right addition of salt and crunch to this very rich recipe - a good addition which I will definitely keep!

Rating: 4
You've got to be kidding me with this risotto! YUM! I can only imagine how much the spinach would add to it (or cut a bit of the richness of the blue cheese), as I didn't have any on hand to throw in. I halved the recipe and left out the cream as some reviewers suggested, and I'm not missing it at all. And the cooking method? LOVE IT! So much easier than adding a 1/2 cup at a time and just stirring, stirring, stirring, especially with 2 little ones running around! Too bad they won't eat it. :(

Easily made vegetarian by using veggie broth instead of the chicken. I also halved the recipe... with the exception of the blue cheese. Those of us with a fondness for all cheese blue will want to add more!

This is my new favorite butternut squash risotto recipe. Made it pretty close to the actual recipe - subbed kale for spinach as that is what I had on hand. Only used a splash of cream and would probably leave it out next time. I also added a little pancetta (idea from another recipe on this site). The blue cheese and rosemary were perfect in this.

I've made this twice now in the past two weeks and both times it has been outstanding. First time I used Cashel blue cheese, the second time I tried an Italian Gorganzola, both were wonderful. I follow the directions exactly, however I do half the recipe as it is just me and my wife and half is MORE than enough for two with some leftover. This is a WOW recipe!

this dish is divine! i followed the recipe exactly as written, have made it several times. it is now my most favorite risotto in the whole world. i have substituted no fat half and half for the cream, using whatever i have on hand. the blend of the rice, blue cheese, spinach & butternut squash is simply scrumptuous--i can't stop eating the stuff. it makes a ton, which is great, as the leftovers are just as tasty as the first time around.

Made this dish for a family party - several of us really love squash, spinach and blue cheese so I figured it would be a good recipe to try. I did use the standard risotto method of adding the liquid gradually; I'm just too skeptical to try it any other way. We served the blue cheese on the side (some don't like it at all) and it really does suffer without it. I would have liked to have tried it reheated but my cousin sneaked all the leftovers into a zipper bag and took them home!

I made this on a Sunday afternoon thinking it would be great for lunch during the work week. My dad happened on by and tasted it - he thought it was better than most restaurant risottos and ended up staying for dinner :) I used fresh butternut squash from the farmer's market, rosemary from the garden and some nice aged parmesan. I did however opt out on the blue cheese... I thought it was rich enough without it. Oh, and it serves at least twice as many people as what is indicated.

Rating: 4
This was easy and delicious. It makes A LOT...well, too much for just me and my husband. I made this according to the recipe except I took the advice of other reviews and used half and half instead of whipping cream and it was fine. Go easy on the blue cheese as the flavor is strong and can overpower the dish. I would suggest adding half of what is suggested then add more to taste. I was also concerned about how this would come out since it's not the traditional way to make risotto, but I was shocked that it came out perfect. This makes way more than 4 servings even if you are using it as your main dish. My husband and I ate generous portions for lunch & dinner for days...I thought we'd never finish it, but it was really good so we didn't mind. I will definitely cut the recipe in half next time.

I have made this twice and really enjoyed it with the "tweaks" I made the second time; I roasted the butternut squash with some olive oil, salt and pepper, I used fresh sage instead of rosemary, I used half and half instead of cream, and cooked the risotto in the more traditional fashion. It is very rich and a little blue cheese goes a long way since the other flavors are more subtle, but if you like blue cheese, you will enjoy this dish.

Wow! My husband couldn't stop saying Wow and eating! I also used veggie broth and substituted 4TBS flax seed for 1/2 the butter. I used brown rice, NO whipping cream.

Wow, this risotto turned out amazing! I followed the instructions exactly, skeptical about adding all the liquid at once but it was perfect and I didn't need to add any extra broth as mentioned in the recipe. The key to the dish's success is definitely the blue cheese..it really took the flavor of the entire dish up a notch. I served this for a birthday dinner along with prime rib and it was the hit of the dinner. Everyone wanted to take some home with them! Thanks Epi for another hit!

Made this for our wine group and it was a huge hit. Used a 6oz bag of spinach & would consider garnishing w/grilled asparagus. We served 12 with this recipe and cooked it in a 6 quart le Creuset high sided pot (which contributed to the outstanding outcome). The blue cheese seems like an odd topping but is essential to this dish's success.

I was afraid all of the vegetables would overwhelm the risotto and skimped a bit on the onion. I definitely won't next time! It was a wonderful textural contrast to the squash and spinach. Also, I used the ladle at a time method of adding broth. The whipping cream didnt seem to make any difference in the final product. I wont add it again. The bleu cheese is what made this recipe awesome!

Very good. I substituted kale for the spinach as it was in my CSA share. I also used fresh sage (~1.5Tb) in place of the rosemary. If I were to make again, I would cut the sage to 1Tb. Don't be afraid of the Blue Cheese, there is just a hint of flavor in the final dish.

Rating: 3
I'd give this a 3.5 fork rating if I could. Very delicious. Agree with other reviewers that the blue cheese really does great things to this recipe. I don't understand the bland comments - perhaps their butternut squash was less than entirely flavourful as that has happened to me before. I struck mid-ground with the preparation after reading the reviews: started with 2.5 cups and then added a cup at a time. This was really good and really easy to prepare. Will definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
Good and easy. I'm usually skeptical about risotto, but this one was a snap. As usual, I followed these directions exactly except for one ingredient. I had forgotten the onion (so important, I know), but I kept on going anyway. The flavors were great together, minus the low-salt chicken broth. I had to add sooo much salt to get the flavors to come out of hiding. Once that happened it was delicious.

This worked perfectly as written. The squash wouldn't cook otherwise! Was a great use for butternut squash too. Only thing I'd say to do is increase the blue cheese. It really is what kicks this recipe into high gear. Will definitely make agin!

This was an amazing risotto, and I think it's my new favorite. I made it for Easter dinner, and almost everyone had seconds. I can't believe the person who said it was bland, between the cheeses, spinach and squash I was in heaven. I do think when I make it again I'll use the standard method for risotto (add 1/2 cup liquid at a time) as it was really hard to keep up with it with all the broth added at once, and seemed to take longer.

I'm surprised this recipe has so many fans. I really, really disliked it. I thought it was horribly bland and, in fact, we ended up tossing the entire pot.

The combination of flavors was good, but the method of cooking produced a mushy soupy slop. I'll probably try it again using the classic method of adding a cup of liquid at a time until al dente. Plus, one of the things I love about risotto is that it's creamy without using cream, so I wouldn't (didn't) add cream.

Bland, bland, bland. Despite keeping the squash al dente and doing the rice just right, the whole thing felt heavy and uninteresting in the mouth. The blue cheese (a very nice blue, and a lot of it) just didn't save an otherwise blah dish.

This dish is fantastic! The layers of flavor work beautifully together. I tried it without the blue cheese, then added it, and it really is the perfect finishing touch. I used a sharp, tangy stilton. However, I do have one question - how in the world does this recipe make "4 servings"? This amount easily feeds 8 as a main course or 12 as a side dish. Or am I just a "skimper" on servings? Hard to tell with this one, because everybody wants seconds :)

It held very well, and I had time to put on my make-up BEFORE the guests pulled in the driveway!

This risotto was amazing. The blue cheese really adds a wonderful zip. Made the recipe as directed and had delicious results. Maytag blue cheese adds the best "zippiness" - wouldn't use gorgonzola.

Like others, I had no trouble using the traditional risotto method and leaving out the cream. I think I was too vigorous in packing my spinach, so I ended up using less than 2 cups and it still was very prominent in the dish. The blue cheese adds a nice tanginess. Very good and company-friendly, but it wasn't my favorite use for either butternut squash or arborio rice, so I'm not sure I'll make it again. I did use the suggested salad and wine, and they paired well.

By happy accident, I had all the ingredients on hand, except spinach. But I did have arugula, which worked out fine. The flavor combinations are magical. Adding the broth in typical risotto fashion worked out fine for the squash using a 1/2 inch dice. Excellent!

This is fantastic. I started out adding liquid in small amounts as risotto is usually done, then waiting for liquid to absorb, I read the recipe more carefully and realized the discrepency. I came back and checked the reviews for comments, and when I discovered that my squash might not get cooked, I went ahead and dumped in the water a few cups at a time. Maybe it was because I'd started slowly, or maybe this recipe just works, but I still got the distinctive creamy texture even without the constant adding liquid and stirring. In addition to the blue cheese on top, I added some toasted pine nuts, and the entire combination of flavors and textures was truly divine. This easily makes 8 side dishes. I will definitely make again, and would serve to company.

Rating: 3
I thought this was delicious. Like others, I added the stock a little at a time. The only problem was that the squash was barely cooked by the time the rice was done - maybe if I had added the stock all at once I wouldn't have had this problem. Next time I will pre-cook the squash a bit. I added extra spinach and blue cheese. Yum!

Rating: 2
This dish was good but not as good as some other risottos I have made. I think it would be better without the cream - it just made it too rich. I also added the stock gradually as others had done. Also, the blue cheese is not necessary but is a nice addition if you happen to have it. I'll make it again but with some tweaks.

Rating: 3
A great weeknight one-dish supper! I halved the recipe with no problem. I also made the risotto in the more "traditional" way: adding the stock in increments rather than all at once. This made the risotto creamy enough and so I didn't add the heavy cream at the end. I'll increase the rosemary and make smaller squash cubes next time.

The best things about this recipe were how well it combined with the radicchio, butter lettuce, pear, walnut salad recommended to accompany it and the smiles on the faces of everyone eating.

I made the recipe exactly as written but added a bit more blue cheese at the end. I thought the flavor combo was very good, but the rice ended up a bit mushy.

This risotto was fantastic. I have made it twice and my husband can't get enough of it. He lived in Italy for years and says he has never had a risotto that compares to this one!

Had never made a risotto before so I followed the directions pretty much as they were stated (other than I had to put the solids into the broth rather than the other way around because of pot size and substituted evap. skim milk for the cream). We loved this recipe (added a little more bleu cheese though because we are all fans of it)! Will definitely make again!

This was excellent. I halved the recipe with no problem. Also added fresh, sliced mushrooms and a couple chopped cloves of garlic while sauteing the onions. I also added to hot stock a cup at a time.

It ended up almost overpowering the other flavors. But overall, this was fantastic.

I'm only an occational cook, have never made a risotto before. I followed the recipe exactly, I think, but thought it wasn't very exciting. Peeling the butternut squash was quite a workout!

Made it just as the recipe says; delicious. Who would have thought rosemary, squash, and bleu cheese blended so well?

this was a really unusual risotto- the ingredients seem like they wouldn't work together, but they actually mesh perfectly.

This dish was a BIG hit. I made a double recipe and added a little more onion than the recipe called for and 6 cloves of garlic chopped. I made a salad of butter lettuce,raddichio and toasted walnuts (as suggested in the recipe) and added belgian endive, craisins and a balsamic vinaigrette. It was so good, we just kept wanting to eat more.

A very tasty recipie. There is lots of room for variation. I used a combination of yellow squash and zucchini instead of the butternut squash and used gorgonzola cheese and next time I will be sure to add some mushrooms.

I love this dish. Substituted acorn for butternut squash, and added the broth in the traditional way, a little at a time, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I intend to try dumping the broth in all at once method next time just to see if it really works--as I have always avoided cooking risotto for guests because of the need to stand over the pot.

It's good to have a reportoire of meatless entrees, but this somehow lacked depth of flavor. I think sauteeing the onions to caramelization might have helped. We keep a shaker of chipotle at the table, and both of us reached for it. I also added chopped pecans, and liked the textural variety it gave the dish, that was expecially nice contrasted with the creaminess of the melting blue cheese.

Makes a lot; would be good (and impressive) at a party. I used sage, as I don't like rosemary. It came out great. I put fried sage leaves on top as a decoration.

fairly quick & easy -- used local international award winning Rogue Creamery's blue cheese -- try this recipe -- it's great!

I must agree with Huntingdon Beach. Ingredient substitutions are fine, acorn squash for butternut, adding a little garlic, etc. That is what this site is for, creative cooking and sharing ideas. I enjoy other reviewers suggestions. But when you completely change the ingredients in a dish, adding mushrooms, and omitting the 3 ingredients in the title of the recipe, you are not reviewing that recipe. You are sharing your own creation.

I usually gradually add the liquid while making risotto, but I was trying to do many things at once, so followed the instructions as written. Came out fine! (I didn't add all the liquid) Quite nice, though I might cut the squash smaller another time. The salty cheese was quite important-- would otherwise have been a bit bland.

This was a really tasty risotto. I too made it in the traditional way of adding the liquid gradually. Get everything organised ahead of time and then its a breeze to make at mealtime. Great flavour.

The only variation from the recipe I made was in adding the broth - I added about 2 cups, then continued with 1/2 - 3/4 cup as the liquid was absorbed (it's how I usually make risotto). Great blend of flavors and nothing really too overpowering - would definately make this again (in fact, I'm eating leftovers now!). To make it even easier - many stores have pre-cut squash available (the packages sold at Trader Joes are exactly the right amount!).

Considering that risottos are notoriously time consuming to make, this was easier than expected. I even mixed up the instructions by accidentally adding the broth before the rice and wine, and it still turned out fabulous. I didn't need to cook quite as long as instructed, as the finished dish should be creamy (which this is) but the rice should also be firm. I also didn't need quite as much broth as the recipe quoted. I made 1.5 batches, because I needed it to serve 10 as a side, and though everyone ate heartily, we still consumed only a little more than half. This is nice for something like a potluck dinner when you aren't responsible for the entire meal and can devote extra time to one special dish, and because it doesn't need to be served immediately, it can be transported.

From what I understand about making risotto, I think that one initially adds a moderate amount of liquid to the rice, lets it boil away, and then continues to add liquid a little at a time, stirring until the fluid boils away each time, until the rice is done and the risotto is creamy. I did not dump 7 cups of broth into this to start with, only about 1/3 of that. When I made it as I described above, I had about 20 per-cent of the broth leftover. I would not make this again, as it was too much work for an only mediocre product.

Huntingbeach, CA What's gotten into your frying pan? The cook from Chicago was doing her best and quite frankly I was happy to read her/his thoughts on the dish. So next time keep it to yourself unless it's productive. This was a great recipe-I left out the cheese and the heavy cream and it was still wonderful. I had tons left over so the next day I cut up chunks of Mozzerella and made a risotto ball around it and rolled it in bread crumbs and baked it. Yum !!!

This was such a lovely dish, so warm and filling. I substituted a dry red wine for the white, just because it was open and the result was wonderful! I also did not use the blue cheese, but I think it would only make it better.

This was the best risotto I have ever made. I served it as a side dish with filet mignon and it was fabulous! I loved the flavor combination of the butternut squash with the blue cheese and spinach. I may try to lighten it up with either half and half or milk instead of heavy cream next time. My dinner guests raved over this one, and as others have stated, this recipe easily serves 6-8, especially if served as a side dish instead of a main course.

Now let me see if I have this right...the cook from Chicago eliminated the butternut squash, rosemary and blue cheese, right? How can you possibly rate this recipe without the three signature ingredients?? I'm sure she/he made a delicious mushroom and spinach risotto, but that's NOT what we're talking about here. PLEASE do NOT rate a recipe when you haven't made anything close to the dish as written! I plan to make this dish next weekend and will offer a rating then.

The grocer did not have butternut squash so I purchased acorn and decided against using it. Used 2+ cups of assorted mushrooms, skipped blue cheese and rosemary at the end. My guests raved! Simple to make as long as you have 15-20 minutes to stand by the stove.

This was wonderful. I did it exactly as written and it worked out well. I personally prefered it without the blue cheese. I agree with the previous reviewer that you could easily feed 5-6 people with the recipe. My husband still talks about it, so I will definitely do this one again!

I really wanted this to be four forks, but after all the work, it was really just OK. The combo of ingredients seems perfect..but..and FYI it makes more servings than you'd think.

Wonderful. Very creamy. I may have overcooked the squash a bit, as it was my first time working with risotto, but my husband loved it and we'd definitey have it again. Yum!

This was FABULOUS! I followed the recipe exactly. My only suggestion would be to test the doneness of the rice at about 16 minutes as to not overcook. Also, this could easily serve 6 or 8.

I am not a huge squash fan, but my husband and I loved this and so did our friends! Absolutely wonderful just the way it is written!
