Great! And made a lot of food. I served 5 people (the teenager had 3 servings; I had 2) and there are still 2 servings leftover. The 16 year-old specifically requested Shepherd's Pie and liked this very much. I used beef broth in lieu of water, I added a bunch of tomato paste and Worcestershire and increased garlic a bit. I also thew in some carrots. All-in-all a solid meal.

C'mon- nothing wrong with gravy mix once in a while. I don't see where standing and making your own stock to turn into gravy for something like this is going to make it any better than what it is. GOOD stuff. I add horseradish to the mashed potatoes when I pipe them atop- pretty presentation. I make this alot and never the same way twice.

I forgot to mention that I use 1/2 lamb and 1/2 beef. Lamb is expensive and really oily.

I've made this several times, with just a few changes. I chop the mushrooms up to hide from the kids. I add about 1 tsb of tomato paste and worstechire and a little red wine. I also use frozen peas and carrots for a little more color. Good comfort food.

I LOVE this recipe. I find myself craving it when the weather gets cooler and I want some warm comfort food! I make it with ground lamb only (no beef), red wine in place of the water, fresh thyme and frozen mixed veggies (peas, corn, carrots). I also top the dish with a layer of shredded cheddar cheese. YUM!! Recently I made it for my boyfriend with Celiac using a gluten-free brown gravy mix. Was still delicious!

I love shepherd's pie but have never made it with lamb before, and this was yummy. I apologize to those who dislike reviews based upon recipe changes, but I followed the recommendations of other reviewers. My additions: Fresh rosemary and thyme, worchestershire, diced carrots, more garlic, lots of salt and pepper. My substitutions: Beer (Negra Modelo) and beef stock instead of water. My mistake: Used 2 packs of "healthy" non-fat gravy mix...I haven't tried that type of gravy mix before and didn't realize that it was so blah. The meat mixture with the non-fat gravy mix, even with the herbs and beer, wasn't very interesting. I had 1 pack of Knorr brown gravy mix in the pantry so I cooked that with a whole bottle of beer (LOL - well, it is pub food!) and added that to the meat mixture which resulted in the rich flavor that I was looking for (though it was a bit too soupy with the additional liquid). Next time, I'll skip "healthy" and use 2 packs of Knorr with beer or red wine and broth. This recipe makes a ton of food so next time I might freeze half the meat mixture and make less potato topping. Do try ground lamb in this recipe if you can find it because the flavor is so good.

OMG too wonderful! I modified with veggies I had on hand, added beef broth instead of water, and fresh, homegrown BAY LEAF to enhance it all. This will be a new heirloom recipe in my files! Thanks so much!

I too took everyone's advice and I beleive that this is now "to die for". I use extra lean ground beef rather than ground lamb (not always easy to get even in the big city). Instead of water, use 3/4 cups of beef broth and 3/4 cups of red wine. Now that the bottle's open, oh well, you may just have to finish it with dinner! I added 1 tsp of thyme and 1/2 can (about 3 oz) of tomato sauce and substituted corn for the peas. My teenagers love it and with a nice fresh loaf of French bread and a salad or another side veggie makes a healthy meal.

It was great and had rave reviews from my dinner party. But, I made the following changes based on what other readers said: *Added cooking sherry in place of half of the water *Added liberal amounts of red wine vinegar *Used portabello mushrooms *Used turkey instead of lamb *Added salt, pepper, and thyme *Added shredded English white cheddar cheese to the mashed potatoes *Added extra milk and butter to potatoes

Hey not bad! :-) I'd put this one step below "something to die for". As suggested I substituted wine (Marsala) and portabella mushrooms. Added salt. I'm gonna work this one. Maybe one day I'll turn it into something to truly die for.

Fabulous. I made changes other reviewers suggested according to my cooking style and taste. One of our guests ate seconds, then I saw him eating more out of the container to be sent home for his father. A simple recipe to change according to your preferences.

I have made this several times and it has always been enthusiastically received (no leftovers for me). I followed the advice from other reviews: 1. add tomato paste (I add half a small can); 2. add wine; 3. add salt; 4. use a lean beef/lamb mixture. I always make my own gravy--just a basic roux using the fat from the lamb and beef. I also double the peas in the recipe. Yum!

i rated this 4 forks not because it compares to Christmas prime rib (it does not). but, it's a great comfort meal that's delicious and easy. i followed the other reviewers suggestions and made the following changes: added salt & pepper to everything, a tsp of thyme to the mushrooms and used low sodium beef broth instead of water. i like vegetables, so i added a bag of frozen peas and carrots. it was delicious! i cooked the gravy until it just glazed the ground beef. i was a little worried that the filling would be dry, but it turned out to be the exact right consistency once the potatoes were added. not only did my 3yo twins have seconds, but my husband also agreed it was a great meal for a rainy weekday night. a rarity in my home!

Rating: 4
This is a great version of a classic, and its just as good with ground beef. The secret though is to combine the gravy mix with a dark British beer, rather than water. Makes all the difference. Its also really good with baby portobella mushrooms instead of a regular white button shroom.

Extreme comfort food that left my husband I going back for seconds and enjoying the leftovers the following evening! Made a few changes to the recipe. First, draining the fat from the browned lamb is I think a MUST! I thought the filling to be a tad bland upon first taste, so I kept grinding the pepper and added a little extra Kosher salt. Still thought it needed a little zip and threw in a few dashes of Worcestershire Sauce and that really did the trick! I think the use of the gravy seasoning mix (I used Knorr) is genius! Thickened to a perfect consistency. My husband I agreed that next time some carrots would be a nice addition and actually I think you could probably get away with a frozen carrot pea mixture added at the end. I just topped it with my own homemade buttermilk mashed potatoes. This was a tasty and inexpensive dish to enjoy on a cold dark winter night.

Really good but can be better, I give it 3.5 forks. I used all lean ground beef, 1/2 the qty. of presliced white mushrooms, 2 cups of frozen peas & carrots and I used half red wine, half water for liquid. My two teenagers inhaled this! Next time I'll add some Worchestershire sauce, more herbs and a bit of tomato paste to the meat mixture. I'll also try substituting one package of onion for brown gravy, or add some beef boullion granules to punch up the beef flavor. The potato topping should be stiffer and broiling the dish at the end adds a nice crust and browning.

This has become one of my favorite recipes. True comfort food! I substituted ground turkey for the lamb and used frozen mixed vegetables.

I made a few modifications to this recipe and it was EXCELLENT.... I used one package of peas/diced carrots mix and substituted hamburger for the lamb (you could use 1 pound each also.) My teenage girls were skeptical at first but they really loved it. This isn't your Mom's shepherd's pie with hamburger, corn and instant potatoes from the 70's! Serve with a crusty loaf of bread.

This recipe is now a family favorite! The original recipe needs a bit more flavor, so I used equal parts lean ground beef and lamb, added about 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme to the sauted onions & mushrooms, and salt & pepper to taste. Yummy yummy!

As written the recipe IS very bland, which if you've been to the UK means it's very traditional. I made these changes to make the dish tastier and eliminate the soupiness and, er, "after effects" that other reviewers noted: * I used half water and red wine for the gravy as previously suggested. I used two parts lamb and one part very lean ground round, which didn't affect the flavor but made the dish healthier. I also substituted diced carrots for half of the peas and used baby portobella mushrooms rather than simple white ones. * The recipe calls for no salt (!) and only one addition of pepper. Instead, I added salt and pepper to taste to the mushroom mixture, meat, and mashed potatoes so that everything would be balanced. I also added a dash of crushed red pepper to the meat with the peas and, taking a cue from a local Irish pub that makes a great version of this dish, I added curry powder to taste. I didn't measure but the idea was to have the curry add depth that would be detectable after a bite or two, not to overwhelm the dish. I added maybe 1 1/2 teaspoons. * When you saute the mushrooms, be sure that most of the liquid they give off during cooking has evaporated before proceeding. Also, ground lamb is usually very fatty and gives off a lot of liquid as it cooks. The recipe easily allows you to partly drain the meat after browning, eliminating the soupiness (and the noisy after effects, I suspect). If you still find the finished meat mixture is soupy, just simmer it until most of the liquid is gone. * To make the potato topping crisp and more visually pleasing, broil the dish briefly before serving. Set the rack in the middle of thge oven and keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't burn. (It took about 2 minutes in my oven.)

I agree with the cook from Bel-Air but just dont have the guts to write it, totally unhealthy with the 2 packs of gravy, still not enough flavor and yes, GASTRIC DISTRESS ALL AROUND. I'd need a guinnes or two to attempt it again

I made this recipe using ground beef insead of lamb. I did not add the peas but added some diced steamed carrots and some frozen corn niblets on top of the mixture before the potatoes. For the gravy mix, I used one onion and one wild mushroom. My husband loved this. I will be bring some to work for lunch for sure.

I made this for a casserole club/dinner swap and got great reviews and requests for the recipe. Next time, I will probably add red wine and rosemary. Unlike other reviewers, I thought the extra sauce was a great and I didn't reduce it until it was dry.

My Irish boyfriend loves this recipe, and asks for it about once a week, though he does say that the potatoes should be golden and crispy on top. I did increase the amount of peas to 3 cups and I reduced it much longer. I tried cutting the gravey to one packet, but it was not nearly as good.

Rating: 3
I would rate this as 3.5 forks with the following modifications, which I thought improved the dish: added diced carrots, used 1/2 red wine, 1/2 water for the gravy, added extra pepper and red chile flakes to meat for needed spice, sprinkled grated white cheddar cheese on top of the potatoes before baking, and simmered the meat with gravy until almost all liquid was gone. Many previous reviewers commented that theirs came out too soupy. So, when I made mine, I heeded the advice and made sure meat mixture was not too soupy - this requires simmering for much longer that the recipe calls for. My boyfriend is English and so I relied on him to tell me if this was a true shepherd's pie. It passed his test! "Just like mum used to make it." He did mention that typically the top layer of potatoes is more stiff - so next time I will broil the dish after baking, so as to get a crispier topping. By the way, this was a very easy dish to make and is great to stick in the freezer for future meals!

Absolutely wonderful but was missing something. Maybe worcestershire sauce or some soy. I did only use one gravy packet so that might have been it. I used beef, and half of a cup of newcastle beer in place of some of the water. I also added carrots.

This is an easy and delicious weeknight meal and a different change of pace. Try topping it with "buttery mashed SWEET POTATOES" instead of using white potatoes. You could bake fresh sweet potatoes in the microwave, but I just used a large can of sweet potatoes, well drained. I then heated them in a large bowl in the microwave until they were hot as the butter melts easier and they mash better when they're not cold. I added a Tbsp. of brown sugar and seasoned them with salt and pepper. Proceed as the recipe directs.

A good recipe for someone who doesn't have much prep time. The amount of mushrooms called for, however, is greater than usually used in a meat pie, and I personally think that the mushrooms overwhelm the lamb. Also, unless you are grinding the lamb yourself, you should be aware that you may need to drain off fat--some ground lamb is quite fatty. Lots of people do make this dish with leftover roast lamb or leftover roast beef. (The latter is like the French "hachis parmentier.") Home cooks in Britain add whatever they like by way of vegetables, especially of root vegetales, or no vegetables at all. When made with ground beef instead of lamb the concoction is often called "cottage pie." I suggest that if you use ground beef, you cook the meat until all the liquid it produces is gone--as Lydia Bastianich does when using ground beef. Finally, as a reviewer of the other shepherd's pie recipe on this site says, let's remember that shepherd's pie is a traditional dish, subject to variation, and really quite simple. Using stout as a reviewer or two suggest, by the way, is simply not traditional in England and does not sound like an enhancement to the dish.

This recipe is good, but I would change the gravy to one using butter, flour and organic broth, eliminating the stuff we don't want in those gravy mixes! ;)

This was easy and everyone loved it. If you use ground beef, depending on the fat content, you may need to drain it before adding the gravy mix (I used Lipton's Beefy Onion and it added some needed flavor). Otherwise it will turn out a little too greasy. This is a great recipe to use whatever vegetables you have on hand. I plan on making this ahead of time and freezing it for an easy weeknight dinner. Anyone ever tried the 'ready made' mashed potatoes you can buy in the refrigerated section? I'd love to know your opinion of them. Seems like it'd make this dish even easier.

All I can say is YUMMY! My husband just raved about this dish. He likes the meat and potatoe type meals. I thought is was very good. I used ground beef instead of ground lamb. Next time I am going to use half ground beef and half ground lamb. I might even try Italian sausage in place of the ground lamb. I think parmesan cheese would be good on top of the potatoes. I used mixed vegetables. I have made a similar dish, except the potatoes were on the bottom. It consisted of Italian sausage, cheese, spinach, and various spices.

A couple of changes: Replace 1/2 the water with red wine. Add 2T tomato paste. Can substitute lamb for a ground beef and ground pork combo. Very good but much better the second day.

I know by changing the original recipe is not really "rating" it. I like to use these recipies for inspiration for new ideas to adapt them to our healthy eating lifestyle. I used ground white turkey (the zero fat kind) and browned it with the mushrooms and lots of ground pepper and some mrs dash. Instead of slicing the mushrooms, I put them in the cuisinart and coarsley ground them. This keeps the turkey moist. I added frozen peas, carrots and pearl onions. Instead of gravy mix, which is not healthy, I used some tomato paste, white wine and chicken broth (did not measure) and generous dashes of Jamacian sherry pepper sauce, stired it in and cooked til thick. Instead of mashed potatoes, I used mashed califlower- 2 bags frozen, drained, and mashed with some ff half and half and a large dollop of Benecol. Very tasty, healthy and hearty and easy..without all the fat, salt, and msg. I know its a far cry from the original, but not everyone can eat like that. Hope this helps someone:)

This was really good!! I used Guinness instead of water, but it came out a bit strong, I thought. Next time I'll try using half Guinness half broth. It takes a lot longer than 5 minutes for the lamb to brown, and more than 5 minutes for the sauce to thicken to a perfect thick consistency. Do season with pepper very generously - it makes the dish so much better! I boiled and mashed the potatoes, and used fat-free half-and-half instead of milk or cream. At the end, I broiled the dish till the tips of the potatoes turned golden brown and crunchy. To the cook in Bel Air, CA - they sell really good organic, fat-free gravy mixes at Whole Foods.

Fabulous!! I used Guiness instead of water, but its flavor was a little overpowering. Next time I'll use half Guinness half broth. It takes longer than 5 minutes for the lamb to brown, and quite a while longer than 5 minutes for the sauce to reduce to a perfect thick consistency, but worth the while. Trust them when they say to season with pepper generously - it tastes better with more pepper! I used the boil-and-mash method to make the potatoes, and added fat-free half and half instead of milk or cream. At the end, I broiled the dish till the tips of the potatoes turned golden brown and a bit crunchy. To the cook in Bel Air, CA: gravy isn't all bad - they sell really good organic fat-free gravy mix at Whole Foods.

This gets three forks just for being so darn easy and tasty. I make with ground turkey, add peas, carrots and beer and have even topped with instant mashed potatoes for a very quick weeknight meal made with ingredients that are always on hand. It makes great comfort food when the weather turns cold. I've even taken it to potlucks, not something I'd usually do with something containing instant mashed potatoes.

I would make this dish again if I had leftover ground meat or mashed potatoes. I used tons of pepper to give it some flavour, my only complaint is that with 2 (or even 1) envelope of gravy mix-I know I am not making a very healthy dinner. Gave my whole family the farts.

Made a half recipe in a small glass dish. I omited the parsley, used a pinch of Herbes de Provence, a bit of cayenne pepper, and a dash of salt to spice it up and added diced baby carrots. To save time, I made a pack of instant garlic mashed potatoes to spoon on top. Baked it until the tips of the potatoes were a golden brown. Yum...very delicious.

Being a Weight Watcher, I lightened this one up to the max. I sauteed onion & garlic in a nonstick pan with a small amount of oil, added 4% ground beef and cooked until almost brown. I then added the brown gravy mix and water and peas and continued sauteeing until thick. Meanwhile, I made mashed potatoes using fat free half and half and salt, omitting the butter. I preheated the oven, put the meat mixture on the bottom of a large cooking bowl, topped with the potatoes, sprayed on some butter spray, and heated untl the potatoes began to brown. I thought it was very good, and it certainly didn't taste low fat!

I agree with Astra's comments and suggestions. I added wine to the recipe,used beef instead of lamb. Basically jazzed it up with stuff I can't recall. I added shaved carrots fozen peas and it was v. yummy. Leftovers were great as well. My 16 month old wouldn't touch it. Go figure.

This recipe was easy enough to make. It was good but do not think I would make it for company. Nothing to rave over. If I make it again I would flash the dish under the broiler at the end to make the potatoes more crusty and stiff. I might also add cheese on top and maybe even a flaky crust under it all, but now I've made a new dish altogether.

First of all, my six year old (who hates everything) had two huge helpings, and my two year old held up her plate and said, "MORE FOOD!!" My husband and I thought it was in major need of salt, but overall it was a good comfort food type of meal. I used beef instead of lamb, and I like the carrot idea; I'll do that next time. Also, I much prefer the old-fashioned boil-and -mash potato method. They seem to turn out creamier that way.

This is very good comfort food. I added sliced carrots to the shrooms an onions and pinch of nutmeg, lots of thyme, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes to the ground beef. I added 1/2 cup of red wine and 1 cup of water for the gravy and put in some fresh rosemary and parsley before the baking step. It was very, very good, but I think I'll let the gravy thicken up to almost a dry point before baking next time as it turned out very juicy and the first servings were just mushy potato beef mixtures and there was alot of broth. After sitting in the fridge overnight, it was perfect. Very nice tasting and hubby, who hates caseroles, had three servings.

I thought this was great, just added some steamed chopped carrots. I added an interesting twist to the microwaved potatoes halving the cooked potatoes crosswise and then pushing them through a ricer. The flesh squeezes out and left the skins behind! This is a great way to make mashed potatoes!
