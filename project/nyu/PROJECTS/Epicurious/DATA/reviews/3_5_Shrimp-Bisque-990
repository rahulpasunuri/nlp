I never made a bisque before but is a swanky steakhouse in town that used to serve it so I tried to recreate it. I made some changes on a whim that seemed to work well. I did not used tarragon because of bad reviews and replaced with some thyme. I also added one whole red bellpepper. It was slightly chunky but it didn't bother me. Also when they say to blend in batches they mean it. I made the mistake of having more faith in my blender than I should and it looked like it vomited all over my kitchen when my bisque exploded out of it LOL. To top the bisque I would highly reccomend buying a frozen sheet of pastry puff. cut into little squares and cook. A great and highly fancy substitution for crackers. I also topped with green onion and some paprika. My sister HATES seafood and she had two large bowls. Her only complaint was it was so rich and she was so stuffed she couldn't eat for two days. Every last drop of this bisque was greedily consumed quickly with no leftovers between the three of us! also trying to find a good substitution for the clam juice as it seems rather pricey in my area for my wallet. I am also making this tomorrow, doubling the recipe adding 1 lb of crab and an extra 1/2 lb of shrimp and perhaps some corn. My friends can't wait for their little bisque care packages.

I have made this recipe several times while visiting other people, using their ingredients, which has required a couple of substitutions. For example, I've used Grand Marnier instaed of brandy with great success, and used apple and lemon juice instead of wine -- not as good, but it was not bad!

Lots of small changes made a huge difference. I bought 2lbs of medium sized shrimp (for $5) shelled them and fried the shells in 2 tbsp of butter and some garlic - after turning reddish (and smelling awesome) i added 5 cups water and simmered for 20min to get shrimp stock (instead of clam juice). I barely cooked the shrimps and set aside, cooked the veg and added all ingredients except the cream. After the blending, it was far too chunky so i strained the soup through a fine sieve removing the solids. I then added the cream and garnished with shrimp. Fantastic.

I doubled the batch adding 1 lb crab meat and incorporated the advice such as forget the tarregon, increased shrimp, tomato paste and carrot 50%, replace whipping cream with 1/2 and 1/2, used vege broth with the clam juice 50/50, an served with green onions and the Brandy on top. What i regret is adding the extra brandy to the serving at the end, it has the potential to ruin the flavor. Next time i will serve with a dollop of marscapone or cream freche. Without the Brandy it was great!! 4 forks! Allan from San Diego Dec 2008

I made this recipe exactly as suggested and it was simply delicious! Well worth the short amount of time it took. My husband loved it also. I will make it again for sure! Beverly

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving. Although I liked the flavor it came out too thin.

I took the other reviewers' advice and used thyme instead of tarragon, but I found the bisque to be unpleasantly chunky and thick even after thinning it out. It was like eating Sauce Nantua, which while good is not what I expect from a soup.

The dish was absoluely overwhelmed by tarragon. There was no balance at all. I'd cut it to 1/2 teaspoon dry tarragon next time.

I don't know what I did wrong but this was terrible - I consider myself to be a good cook and the tarragon completely overpowered the dish and added a bad flavor. Maybe one of the ingredients I used had gone bad but it was a terrible waste.

I ran out of tomato paste and used a chopped tomato and a chipolte pepper instead. I loved the added spice. I also used only 8 oz clam juice, and simmered the shrimp shells in 16 oz water for the remaining liqued. Used half and half as the others suggested. Served with french bread for a fantastic dinner for 2 and ample leftovers.

Made this exactly as written, and served at a Christmas party. I think one person actually used both hands and feet to eat it! Another said, "there isn't one restaurant in this area that makes one this good." Outstanding recipe.

Fantastic recipe! I suggest adding 2-3 cloves of garlic, pressed, to the butter when sauteeing the shrimp. Also, I didn't have any clam juice on hand. Instead, I simmered the shrimp tails in the same volume (24 oz) of veggie broth for the entire time I spent preparing and cooking. It made a fine substitute, and didn't have any of the unpleasant "fishy" flavor that I personally dislike in clam juice. If you use the garlic in the first step, you might have to add some of this broth to the vegetables when you sautee them, since garlic likes to absorb liquids.

Wonderful recipe. I combined the best of the suggestions, using half and half, extra tomato paste, NO tarragon, a little extra carrot, broth and shrimp shells for half the clam juice. I chopped the shrimp corsely before putting in the blender, and had no issues. A little cayenne at the end. I thought the bisque was excellent and sampled quite a bit of it as I was making it the evening before. I would make this for any occasion -- simple or elegant.

Made for special occassion dinner. I cut amt. of tarragon as suggested, but it was still mediocre at best. I wouldn't bother.

Rating: 2
this was definitely an easy recipe for a seafood bisque, which normally requires poaching shells, etc. however, the amount of tarragon called for makes the soup completely overpowering - it's nearly all you taste. i'd make the recipe again, but drastically change the called-for seasonings.

This is yummy beyond compare. The simplicity of the recipe is also a big bonus. I left out the tarragon-not a fan. If you want to impress your family and friends- MAKE THIS DISH!!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. It was OK but not outstanding. It is so rich, I think if I ever made it again I would replace the whipping cream with half & half. It barely made enough for the 6 of us.

Served at a dinner party and my guests loved it! I enjoyed it too. I had alot of shrimp shells left over from another shrimp dish I was making for the party so I used them in addition to 1 bottle of the clam juice and 16 oz of chicken broth. I didn't want to waste the shells and I didn't want to buy the 3 bottles of clam juice. I also used half & half vs. full cream. It was super rich and heavenly!

Made it with shrimp stock rather than clam juice-still very good. Only used 8 oz shrimp because that was all I had but we still enjoyed it very much. Next time will use twelve ounces. Did use the blender rather than food processor and felt it gave a better texture.

I tried this one night when friends of ours came to dinner, so I knew I could try something new and not have to worry about the repercussions. But I didn't have anything to worry about. It came out great. In fact, it's so fast and easy, I've made it for dinner during the week, when I keep cooking adventures to a minimum.

This bisque was easy & delicious! Add some crab & clams & Louisiana hot sauce at the end. Perfect!

This bisque was great. I used 1 teaspoon dried Tarragon instead of 2 1/2 teaspoons. I added a little salt & pepper and 1 teaspoon of Emeril's Essence. Just before I pureed everything I added 1/2 cup Holland House Sherry. FABULOUS!!!

We liked the basic recipe but it seemed that the tarragon (I used dried Tarragon) was overwhelming. I think I'll use less Tarragon the next time. I read the earlier reviewer's caution about using a towel with the blender and got bisque all over the counter because I didn't think it was a real important hint. It is!

This recipe was easy and very tasty- I added some seasoned salt to taste and about 1/4 cup of dry sherry. When serving, put a dash of sherry on top along with chopped green onion tops. YUM!

This was a delicious soup...I thinned it a little more using 1/2 & 1/2. Maybe because I completely pureed the shrimp (vs just coarsely chopped). I used salt & cayenne pepper for seasoning and really liked the outcome. Very good. I found it to be easy to make (except a little messy to puree - tip: don't overfill the blender and hold the lid on the blender using a kitchen towel as a buffer between your hand and the cover...what does 'spray' out gets caught in the towel) and it took me just over an hour to prepare, which I thought was fine since 20min of that was simmering.

I doubled the recipe, using 1 lb. shrimp and 1 lb. Phillips brand canned crabmeat. It was fabulous! Saw the demonstration of the bisque last week on TV, so I, too, simmered the shrimp shells in the clam juice, making the broth much richer. I used Cream Sherry rather than the brandy, adding a little extra at the end. I also added one add'l tbls. of tomato paste and cayenne pepper to my taste. Am planning a dinner party just so I can serve this "seafood bisque". And I did not consider it difficult or time-consuming to make.

This dish was delicious, though time consuming.

Although very time consuming I thought it was delicious. I did, however, find that it NEEDED cayenne pepper added...I offered it per bowl rather than all at once to the dish...it made it tastier and more fun. Once everything is pureed I recommend refrigeration over night then reheating and thinning our with an additional two cups milk (I used 1 cup cream and 1 cup whole milk). It made it much easier to enjoy...not so overwhelming. Next time I think I will also double the tomatoe paste. There will be a next time!

Because of the one negative review, I decided to test this recipe prior to using it for a dinner party. Surprise Surprise! it was delicious and so easy. Will use the recipe with absolute confidence that it will be a hit!

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I took some extra time and made the shrimp stock from the shells. It was worth it! I plan to make this for our family Thanksgiving celebration.

I really like this recipe, especially with some cayenne added. I double the recipe and boil the shrimp to make some stock. This way I avoid the cost of three more bottles of clam juice.

Terrible and horrible are two kind words in describing this recipe. It was so bad I had to flush it down the commode. I am very upset and disgusted at the time and money I invested in making what turned out to be garbage!

What a rich and wonderful flavor this bisque had. Instead of 3 bottles of clam juice I used 2, plus one cup of liquid from the boiling of the shrimp shells. For a little zest I added cayenne pepper. I would definitely make this again and again...

This is a great do ahead dish. Just reheat when ready to serve. I tripled the recipe for a large party and it worked out fine. Tip: add more chopped shrimp. This recipe is a keeper!
