Holy guacamole, waaaaay too spicy. The serrano's seeds most definitely should have been omitted, or at least listed as optional. Maybe we get 'em hotter here in Texas, but I'm wishing I'd have tried first w/o the seeds. I, too, added cukes in blended batch, as well as chunks mixed in, but it's not possible to detect any flavors other than the tomato and serrano which both scream, "¡AGUA!" or "¡CERVEZA!"

I made this without tomatillo and added cuke. LOVE. Love love love love love. There are a lot of gazpacho recipes on Epicurious with a lot more ingredients (which I did not have), and I'm so glad that this simple recipe did the trick.

Skipped the sieve. I used one bunch of spring onions instead of white, only half the seeds of the serrano (definitely still plenty hot). Did not add in the reserved tomatoes and onion, so added only half the water, half the oil. Perfectly delicious, although too salty. I used Kosher salt and next time would only use half of that too. A peeled seeded chopped cucumber added at the end would be nice or a bit of lime as someone said.

This recipe kicks booty .... really good. I've made it 4 times since Sept 2009. This time I added 6 oz of feta cheese ... wow, really good

Wow! This was so full of flavor! I would love to make this again but next time I think I'll leave more of the chile seeds out of the mix. The heat made this really interesting... just a tad too spicy for me. I didn't add any salt (because I forgot) but I didn't miss it at all. Husband gave it two thumbs up!

This was a hit. However, I agree that the water can be omitted.

it's a beautiful combination of flavors. I think the only thing I would do differently is add a little pepper. delicious!

This is my new favorite lunch dish. When I made it I did not strain the puree because I didn't want to lose the vegetable skin. I also omitted the water and squeezed a lime over the soup before serving

The recipe is tasty. I mixed everything together with a hand blender to the liquid form I liked. I didn't add any water since the tomatoes have enough on their own. Great for an appetizer or beginning course.

Good flavor, but I would recommend pureeing less of the tomatoes and tomatillos because it came out too liquid. Also, in the photo you can see whole chunks of tomatillo even though the recipe says to puree them all. It's a serious pet peeve of mine when photos are published that clearly use a different method than the written recipe.

We have made this twice this week as we have an abundance of tomatoes in the garden. I like it better without adding water as it keeps it a little chunkier.

Very good gazpacho, very easy to put together not long before dinner. I omitted the seeds from the serrano, because I didn't want the spice to overwhelm the rest of the flavors, and added an extra tablespoon of olive oil. In terms of the water content, if you hit "print" to print the recipe off the website, the page it brings up has the measurement for water -- 1 cup.

This recipe calls for water but doesn't tell you how much. I used 5 cups after researching other gazpacho recipes. I also doubled the garlic because I'm a huge garlic fan, and added chopped and peeled cucumber for more body.
