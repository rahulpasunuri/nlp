to the cook from buenos aires -- you need to look for aluminum-free baking powder -- in North America, at least, there are several different brands. It's the aluminum that you are tasting. http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2008/10/why-you-should-use-aluminum-free/

I've been looking for this recipe because they always turned out well for me. I do mix it up with other dried fruits. As far as refrigerating overnight then baking, I've never tried that and don't know how it affects the chemical reaction. Freezing would probably work. I make my own freezer biscuits by cutting out the raw dough and freezing individually before packaging. They go straight from the freezer to the oven and seem to work as well as those chemical laden ones from the grocery store.

Can anyone tell me if I can make the dough and refrigerate it overnight and bake it in the morning to serve them hot, or does that affect the quality of the dough?

I love a good cream scone and was excited to try these based upon the reviews offered. However, after making them, I realized a pattern in my baking: baked goods that use baking soda as an ingredient have a certain flavor or quality that doesn't appeal to me. Perhaps it is the chemical combination of the baking soda with something else, but after these scones, I've decided to shy away from recipes using baking soda. (The last cake I made with baking soda in it had this same, kind of tinny quality to it.) On another note, don't go too thin on these, and if you do, don't go too brown in the oven.

Great recipe, easy and versatile. For 4th of July breakfast, I substituted dried blueberries and tart cherries and used a star-shaped cookie cutter. Trimmed the excess berries with kitchen sheers before baking. A little lumpy but very cute and enthusiastically received. "They taste like summer."

Wonderful and so easy! I substituted 1 c whole wheat flour and they were delicious. We omitted the currants, used buttermilk instead of cream, and didn't add extra sugar on top. We may eat them all by tomorrow.

I changed a few slight things, and the scones turned out INCREDIBLE. I didn't have currants. I added a ripe mango -- pureed half and added it to the cream mixture, and then cubed the other half and added it instead of the currants. I only put in two tablespoons of sugar because the mango was so sweet. I also put the butter in the freezer, and cut it into the flour, and then massaged the rest in with my fingers. Finally, I put the flour meal mixture back into the freezer for a few minutes before adding the cream mixture and mango pieces. The scones turned out light, flaky, and just sweet enough. They don't need any cream, butter, or jam. Terrific!!!

Just what a scone should be. I was worried that I was overworking the dough because it took a couple of minutes of kneading before it came together at all. But the scones came out perfectly flaky and light - even the ones made out of the scraps that got kneaded together a second time.

Rating: 4
These scones were very easy to make and very delicate in taste and texture, rising nicely and forming a good crust. Not overworking the dough is very important. I substituted Raspberry Jammy Bits from the King Arthur catalog, instead of currants and the outcome was nicely sweet. Served with lemon curd, they were to die for. After making I read other reviews and see someone recommended freezing the butter and grating it into the batter. I used cold butter and an old-fashioned pastry cutter and the scones were flaky, but I would try that person's idea, too, to see if it makes a difference.

This was my first time making scones, and after reading all the reviews I was worried the original recipe would be too bland and dry. So I decided to incorporate the changes other reviewers consistently pointed out. Therefore, I added 2 tbs of cornstarch for moisture, somewhat diminished the amount of baking powder, increased a bit the amount of cream and butter, added lemon peel and lavender, which I love. The result was very nice in terms of flavor, but the consistency was that of a biscuit: crispy outside, moist and airy inside. I liked them and would make them again, but I'll have to make the original recipe, and try other scone recipes to see whether I can achieve the classic scone texture, a bit more dense on the inside.

Turned out fantastically well. To subsitute for the cake flour (as I could not find some at my corner store on quick notice), I measured 2 cups of flour, sifted it, and then added 2 tablespoons of corn starch. The consistency was PERFECT and the scones were just delicious.

Rating: 4
Great texture. Flaky inside, crispy outside. I would have preferred it to be moister, but this was still delicious. I didn't have cake flour so I replaced 1/4 cup of all-purpose with cornstarch to keep it tender. Used this as the base for a savory scone, but just added the ingredients (wet ingredients added to wet ingredients, dry spices to the flour) that I wanted, leaving nothing out (other than the cake flour thing) and the currants. So good.

I love these scones and took to heart what some reviewers said. Lavender and Zest? Delicious. One thing I would add though, is after you cut them out, sort of fluff or juj the edges a bit and this will help them rise.

I would agree that the flavor of these would be very bland if I didn't add a TBSP of lemon zest & fresh lavender. They were inspired by & almost as good as the ones I had at the Doe Bay Resort on Orcas Island during Lavender harvesting season. Since I never had made scones I just needed a good basic recipe which this turned out to be. The texture and consistency were perfect and the the 2 additions I made really added a lot of flavor as well as fragrance. I would definitely give the recipe with my slight adaptation 4 forks.

Rating: 2
Just okay. Maybe my expectations were too high because of all the rave reviews. They taste just like biscuts to me. Pretty bland. The texture was nothing special. They just seemed like hard biscuts to me. And I did not overwork the dough. I kept double checking the recipe to see if I had forgotten anything becacuse they tasted bland and the dough seemed too dry from the very begining. I prefer scones that call for more butter and sour cream.

I make scones every Sunday morning, usually I do the Maple Pecan scones found on this sight, adapting the flavor to taste. I tried this recipe this weekend and because it calls for cakes flour, these scones were airy and beautiful. I omitted the currants and flavored with vanilla bean paste for a strong vanilla scented cream scone. I topped the scones with sanding sugar before baking. They were amazing!!

these scones were magical! i'd never made scones before and they turned out perfect - a little crusty on the outside, moist and flaky on the inside. instead of currants, i used cranberries and grated orange zest as add-ins. also, instead of sprinkling sugar on top, i glazed them after they came out of the oven with a frosting made from approx 1/2 cup icing sugar, 2T plain yogurt, and 1t orange zest. i will be making these again!

My scones turned out somewhat dry -- perhaps I overworked the dough. Next time I make scones I'll try a different recipe.

This recipe is wonderful! I have followed the frozen butter advice and have used regular flour each time. I have adjusted the recipe by cutting the sugar by 1 tbl then used ¼ cup crushed white chocolate chips and cranberries. I have also done pear cardamom and orange cranberry by adjusting just a few of the ingredients. Everyone has said these are the best scones they have ever had. The texture is amazing!

Rating: 2
These were just ok. They didn't really have a lot of flavor, in my opinion. But then, I'm judging them against my favorite scone recipe, the Cranberry-Tangerine Scones from this site. I was looking for something a little simpler that didn't involve zesting and juicing tangerines, and that I could make w/ pantry staples. But this recipe is not really worth making again for me.

Out of the oven, these scones just cannot be beat. The light, creamy flavor is to die for! Maximum success can be achieved by using a food processor to incorporate the butter!

I made this recipe on a whim, even though I am though I was the only one in my house who likes scones. Well, it turns out someone else likes them, because of the half batch I made so far, only two remain! I did use the butter box grater trick, (though next time I will also freeze the grater, I'm sure non novices would know better than I did to this) which worked great! Also, I only had on hand regular unbleached flour and regular non double-acting baking powder, and raisins instead of currants. If they were this delightful with these substitutions, I am sure they would probably be even better following the recipe exactly. I formed them into little meatball size balls, smushed down to 3/4" high, and baked for about 16 minutes. Because I formed them into balls I did not knead them, as I worried messing with the dough twice would make them tough. Making them this size should make 50 to 60 two bite size scones. Delightfully delicious!

These scones are delicious and with a few adjustments, near perfect. British food doyenne Delia says the secret to a perfectly risen scone is to roll them out to no less than 1" in height. This made all the difference! The scones baked up with a crumbly outer crust and soft and flaky inside. I followed the advice to use frozen butter and a box grater which was a great tip, and I added golden raisins. Keep them small, as they do spread and rise a bit.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Perfect scone texture - light and slightly crumbly. I used cranberries (soaked in water to plump them up first) and dropped them onto the sheet in rolled balls of 2" diameter and 1" height. My husband likes these even more than the scones for high tea at the Ritz in London (which also were amazing)!

The cook from NY, NY again...I just wanted to add that it worked really well to mix the dry ingreadients ahead of time and the wet ingredients ahead of time and store the wet in the fridge overnight. In the morning I just grated the butter while the oven preheated and popped them in the oven. The whole thing, including the cooking time was less than half an hour, so these are a great option for breakfast.

I made significant changes, so I'm not rating the recipe, but I'll share my review. I used regular flour which worked fine. I also used dried blueberries instead of currants. They were a little too dry, so I re-hydrated them with some boiling water (which I then drained) before adding them to the recipe. I used regular baking powder and forgot to increase to account for double acting, but they still came out delicious. I used more like 3/4 cup of heavy cream in the recipe since it was a little dry (probably because I let the rehydrated blueberries sit in the cream overnight since I wanted to bake them in the morning). I also used a 1.5 inch round cookies cutter that was not fluted, so mine came out smaller. As a result they were done at around 12-13 minutes and furthermore the recipe produced around 40 mini scones. I followed the tip to freeze and grate the butter, which was fantastic and I'll be doing again in the future. The scones were quite moist and lightly crumbly--I am a big fan of this recipe. I was generous with the sugar on top and as such, don't feel that these scones need any additional sweetening. The blueberries were a nice change from the typical currants. Next time I'll make them with chopped dried apricots (yum!) and serve them with greek yogurt sweetened with just the slightest hint of honey.

These were wonderful scones. I second the pp suggestion to freeze then grate the butter. I will add my own suggestion to it, make the dough then stick it in the fridge overnight to relax the dough and prevent it from getting tough. I made mine with raisins and it turned out great, I will say that you need really good quality ingredients for this to be really good. Get grass fed organic unpasteurized cream & butter if you can find it.

Now that I know how easy it is to make wonderful scones, they will make frequent future appearances in my kitchen! I am not a fan of currants, so I omitted them, but just in general terms of the just-right dough to make a crumbly, melt-in-your-mouth scone, this recipe is IT. I served them at a tea party, in the traditional manner with clotted cream and jam (thanks to Epicurious for that too - search for "Quick Strawberry Jam"), and they were a big hit.

Rating: 4
My goodness, long have I sought a decent scone recipe, and FINALLY with amazing success! Thank you, Epicurious! I made a few changes: sour cream instead of heavy cream; raisins instead of currants soaked in hot water to plump them (which would have been better, but I couldn't find them in the cupboard); and omitted flour, salt and BP in favour of Self-Rising Cake Flour. I eased preparation by pulsing flour and butter in food processor; added pre-mixed wet ingredients all at once with fruit, cutting in just until moist and starting to cling together; then dumped everything onto parchment paper on the pan, and used the parchment to simply push the dough together to make a circle. If you do this, skip the kneading - this type of dough can easily become too stiff. Incredibly flaky and light! I did forget to brush with milk and sprinkle sugar, which was unfortunate - these would have been beyond perfect. I also note that the rise was simply average and not fabulous, as some reviewers noted. I can live without height - these were absolutely divine!

Best scone recipe I've ever tried! These are very creamy and delicious. I took marachino cherry halves and after patting them on a paper towl, put them in the toaster oven on warm for about 10 minutes. This dried them out a bit and added a sweet flavor. YUM!

This recipe was wonderfully easy--particularly with the suggestion by another reviewer to grate the butter. My only complaint, however, is that I found the baking powder taste a little strong. Given how much the scones rose, I might consider decreasing it a bit.

I had leftover currants and heavy cream from Thanksgiving so I made this recipe because I love scones. I followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed -- they were sooo dry and not sweet enough for my taste. So I made them again (still having currants and cream to use up!) but this time with a little less flour and a little more cream and sugar. Still just okay. The flavor was a little better but they were still too crumbly to put butter and jam on without having them fall completely apart. I'll keep looking for a scone recipe that tastes like England.

Made these this morning (well, baked them; assembled last night) and thought they were great: flaky, delicate, not too dry. I used currents but will try cranberries next time. I sprinkled raw sugar over the cream and served them plain for a meeting. I can't see any reason not to make and freeze the dough and pull them out as needed.

First, these are only miniature in the American sense. This is your standard size UK scone. Excellent recipe. If you can get raw milk/cream, make your own clotted cream to serve with the scones; the imported stuff is so heavily pasteurized it tastes plastic.

All previous attempts at making scones have been a disaster, but this recipe turned out gorgeous scones that are so good I can't believe I made them. I left out the currants and intended to slather lots of jam or something on top, but they don't need it. They're amazingly good on their own.

I've been testing scone recipes for about a year, trying to find the perfect one, and this is it. A few notes on preparation: 1) I left out the currants and was generous with the sugar on top. With jam and clotted cream, they'll be the exact right sweetness. 2) To cut down on the handling of the dough, I patted it into a circle, cut it into 8 wedges, and cut each wedge in half. Some of the shapes are a little funny, but they still taste good! 3) Another reviewer's suggestion of freezing the butter and grating it into the flour was pure genius.

As a former Brit I'm something of a scone expert. But I've baked a lot of "hockey pucks" over the years. This recipe is wonderful. Leave out the currants and serve with raspberry jam and thick whipped cream (or Devon cream if you can find it). This is a keeper.

This is the best scone I have ever eaten. We have been making them since Gourmet first published the recipe in 1990. Using cream is the secret ingedient; it makes a very tender crumb. For those of you who thought these gems are tough, try using a lighter touch. The pastry dough is delicate and needs TLC. Easy to make and a real treat. OK to measure the dry ingedients and cut up the butter the night before. Just lay the little butter pieces on top of the flour mixture, cover tightly, and refigerate. In the morning, properly mix in the butter and add the wet ingredients. This is a real time-saver.

I did everything by the book, and thought that these scones were not good at all. Has a bitter aftertaste- too much baking powder, or too little of something else, I guess. Needs to be lighter, creamier, and sweeter (this coming from someone who thinks most scones are TOO sweet.) Anyway, there are much better scone recipes out there, i.e. the raisin scone recipe on this site.

I made these for a brunch for 50 and served with clotted cream and preserves - Wonderful! This has become a staple in my personal chef menu. Fast, easy, delicious. They have staying power, and will be good the next day if you cool then store them in a sealed container and don't overbake them.

I would have rated a 2.5 if it had been possible.... The scones were a bit too dry for our taste with nice with the currants, but would have preferred a tad bit sweeter dough. I made the recipe by forming into a circle and cutting into 8 wedges - don't think that could make any difference as to consistency. These would be good if made with very small cutters and used for a brunch or tea party and eaten in just a couple of bites. Otherwise, some of the other recipes have had a better consistency for making into larger scones.

These were great! When I made them the first time I substituted dried cranberries for the currants - they were not as good. This recipe is not overly sweet and needs the sweetness from the currants. If you like a sweeter scone, be generous with the amount of sugar you spinkle on top before baking. The texture is what is truely grteat about these scones, not too dry and crumbly, not to moist and cakey. And easy and quick to make too. They got rave reviews at the party I served them at.

Quite good, but not the best I've made. I prefer the Orange Currant Scones recipe on this site. These scones were a little denser and more crumbly than I preferred and could have had slightly less of a baking powder taste. They had just the right amount of sugar for being served cold -- not quite enough if being served hot.

This recipe makes delicious *and* beautiful scones! I made three batches of scones with different recipes and conducted a taste test at work - these won almost unanimously. The only comment was that it's a little too crumbly. I saved time by using a food processor to combine the butter into the flour mixture, and shaped the batter on the baking sheet with floured hands rather than rolling and cutting. This means that the dough is handled less, and less flour all over the counter. These were amazingly tasty warm, but were still light and tasty the next day.

Got tons of compliments from the party where I took these scones. Used regular all-purpose flour , and all turned out great.

I found these scones to be much too sweet. Perhaps if eaten without jam they'd be fine, but eaten with butter and jam - it was just too much. The cake flour made for a denser scone than is usually achieved by using all-purpose flour, as called for in most recipes. Although I didn't like the end result, I think that using a mixture of all purpose and cake flour would produce a nicely textured crumb - perhaps 2/3 cup cake flour, the rest all purpose.
