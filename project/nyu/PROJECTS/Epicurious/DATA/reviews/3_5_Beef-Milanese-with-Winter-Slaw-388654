This meal was amazing! And so quick and easy to make! My family loved it! It's a keeper and will definitely make it again. Might add some cilantro to the slaw next time. Can't wait to experiment with it.

My husband loved this dish. I made it exactly to recipe, which was a switch for me, and it turned out great. I was surprised at how well the coleslaw complimented the meat. Will make this again.

Made it with pork following the recipe exactly- turned out great! Don't skimp on the lemon juice.
