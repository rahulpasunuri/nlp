Okay, so maybe I made too many changes to give this a good review, but still. I just did the cake and baked it in a square pan - either 9x9 or 10x10 - and didn't do the syrup or cream. By no fault of the recipe, the pan was too big and my cake was really short, so I'd say if you want to make one cake maybe an 8-inch round would be good. I didn't do the zest and sugar sprinkle, and I beat 1/2 cup rather than 2/3 with the butter and it was still plenty sweet. The yolk mixture was really tough and I had a little trouble mixing it with the whites, but in the end the texture turned out fine. The matzoh taste is definitely there, but not too overpowering, and I'm going to use this as a Passover snack/breakfast cake. This is a four-fork Passover recipe, but it's not much compared to a regular cake.

Tasty! We made one larger cake instead of the smaller cupcakes and cooked it a bit longer until it was set. The lemon basil syrup is excellent! and the whole thins is decadent if you add a dollop of whipped cream :-) You can easily make 1/2 of the syrup and will still have plenty left over. It will be tasty on your next batch of pancakes/french toast or spooned over your oatmeal...

I wasn't impressed for the work involved. i cut the sugar in the syrup in half but the cakes themselves were awfully sweet. barely got any basil flavor -- i'd recommend using a LOT so you can taste it.

This recipe is so easy and so much better than regular passover desserts. I plan on making it all year round, not only on passover!

Delicious and easy! I used regular cake four and my local store ran out of fresh basil so I substituted rosemary with amazing results. The flavor of the syrup was incredible, everyone was licking it off the plates with their fingers!

Great Passover recipe. I'm not typically a fan of Passover deserts, but this one was really good. If someone gave these to me in July, I don't know if I would have known they were made from matzah flour. Followed the directions exactly and they came out great.

These are really tasty and the texture is great! I would add more basil to the syrup. Otherwise, skip the syrup all together and try this as a starting point for a lemon cake topped with berries and whipped cream.

Followed the recipe except for the flour thing and made lovely little cakes. Very tart and refreshing! Here's a picture-- http://ladybakes.blogspot.com/2009/05/le mon-cakes-with-basil-lemon-syrup.html

I probably shouldn't comment on this recipe because I made so many changes. I made it in an 8" springform pan rather than cupcake tins. I didn't include the basil because of the picky eaters in my group. Finally, while the cake was still warm, I pricked the cake all over with a fork and poured quite a bit of the syrup over the cake. The glaze soaked in around the pricked sports. Both the cake and the sauce had the taste of fresh, fresh lemon ... and I guess that's why I loved the recipe so much.

Easy, tasty, different. I'm so used to chocolate dessert for Passover, that this made a nice change at the seder table. I reduced the amount of sugar as reviewers recommendation and it works! Also adjusted the recipe to yield 12 instead of 8 cakes, so worth it. Next time I'll go ahead and bake 24!!

Just made this cake, ate a couple of slices. wow its light, fluffy and great tasting. I used regular flour, did not make sauce, and cooked in a bundt pan. This is absolutely great. Will definitely make many more times.

Made this for my own birthday. I used regular cake flour. I added a lot more basil than called for in the syrup (thanks to previous reviewers) and you could definitely taste it. The lemon zest/sugar topping was superb. Next time I would add more lemon zest to the cake batter. You could easily cut the syrup recipe in half..there's just too much of it!

I made these several times - they are delicious, perfect summer time desert. Living at about 6000 ft above see level I made several high altitude adjustments (without the adjustments the cakes are little too dense but still good) - Add 1 tbsp of flour, increase lemon juice by 2 tbsp., whip in extra egg white. The syrup is the same, of course. I found that the recipe makes a lot of syrup, half would be enough unless you want to drown the cakes in it.

Following another reviewer's advice, I reduced the butter to one stick (total) and reduced the sugar, as well. I made these in advance and froze them. As I ended up not going to the seder due to illness, they remained in the freezer and kept well. I never made the basil-lemon syrup or the whipped cream, but these little cakes (I made 9 instead of 8) were delicate delights. My only quibble is the recipe should be reconfigured so one can use ALL 12 of the muffin tins! I didn't read the yield before starting, so I buttered all tins (and then added water so they wouldn't burn during baking.)

I thought the cake was delicious, although very sweet (recipe calls for a lot of sugar!). Although I would have loved to try the basil-lemon glaze, I made a strawberry rhubarb sauce instead which was delicious and fit with the spring theme. I would make again, but I prefer desserts on the healthier side.

Foe some reason, this recipe will not print out completely and only prints about half of the instructions

This recipe didn't come close to rocking my world, but was good and guests enjoyed it. The syrup didn't have the pronounced/identifiable herbal taste that I expected, but it was good regardless and the lemon cakes were nice. I'll probably make this again one day, but will experiment with other herbs in the syrup.

Very good and a fun combo. The lemon syrup was a little intense at first. But, if you allow it to sit for a couple of hours the flavors will mellow together and it becomes much better.

These turned out great, kind of time intensive, for me anyway, as I am not a very experienced baker. I could not find matzo flour, so I used cake flour. They were delicious, I wasn't overly crazy about the lemon-basil syrup, but everyone else really seemed to enjoy it.

I made these cakes for Passover and thought they were delicious. Some of the less adventurous diners were a little apprehesive about having basil with a dessert, but most loved the cakes.

Wonderful change from the usual sponge cake. I used rosemary instead of basil with excellent results. I also soaked the cakes in the syrup for a few hours before serving.

So I just made this recipe...I called around and couldn't find the matzo cake flour (which is not unusal in my area lol). I used regular cake flour and they turned out so great. I haven't tried them out on my supper club yet but I am sure they will love it tonight. :)

I absolutely loved these little cakes. With the syrup or alone, they are equally as delicious. Highly recommend!!

I'm a little bit of a health freak and am always looking for ways to modify recipes... I ended up using only a little more than half the butter, less sugar, and substituting whole wheat pastry flour for 1/2 cup of the cake flour. They came out excellent- lighter and delicious. I also served them with fresh berries.

As one of the other cooks added-- I made this with all purpose flour since that was all that I had at hand. I too, would like to try this with cake flour. As they were, however, the cakes were delicious. I used far less of the syrup than indicated for each cake, and loved the taste of basil and lemon.

I made these souffle-like cakes as part of a plated dessert I put together for a final project in culinary school...I got rave reviews. I made the lemon-basil syrup that goes along with it, but decided I didn't like it at the last second and went with a blackberry coulis instead, and it paired wonderfully. I will definately be making these again in the future.

I have made these cakes twice since the recipe was fisrt published. I loved how moist and lemoney these cakes are. They puff really well in the oven, just make sure your oven is preheated. I don't bother making the cream or the syrup because the cakes are just good by themselves. One of my favorite Passover desserts.

Excellent flavors - I used one bunch of basil leaves so the flavor was not overpowering, but very subtle. What a wonderful combo! I only had large muffin tins, so the cakes came out a little on the small side. I will definitely make this one again.

Rating: 3
Nice, not too heavy dessert. Next time, I will try to up the basil flavor in the syrup. I am even thinking about trying to add basil to the actual cake. The flavors of lemon and basil go so well together, but the strong lemon flavor of the syrup sort of overwhelmed the basil.

Rating: 3
This was excellent. I thought the cakes could have a touch more lemon. Be careful with the syrup, though. Mine was a little bitter - probably needs less lemon juice.

I loved this recipe! I made it for Passover and it got mixed reviews from the diners (some non-adventurous diners weren't ready for the basil-lemon combo, and some thought the syrup was too intense), but I thought it was fabulous - a unique combination of flavors - and I will definitely make it again, if only for myself!

This is amazing! I've served it twice to savvy food types and they raved. I was looking for a recipe that would use lots of lemons because my Meyer lemon tree has loads of fruit this year. The syrup is a must in my opinion: the dense cake soaks it up and the flavor is out of this world. I did boil it down more than indicated so it wasn't so watery. With the whipped cream on top, it's to die for!

I have neve made anything like this dish before. I served these cakes with salmon steaks served with mustard butter (also found on this site) and they were a great hit. Although there were a few details to pay attention to, the cakes turned out well. They came out of the tins easily. The lemon flavor was comfortably sweet and not overpowering. I have to print a new recipe for myself because I gave mine away to the company.

The cakes were dense but delicious. The basil syrup is a must to impress your guests. I served it with whipped cream but it might also be good with lemon sorbet. Excellent summer treat!

This was absolutely delicious & refreshing, and on top of that, VERY easy to make. I skipped the whipped cream and think it was better off that way--perhaps the whipped cream is a part the recipe for looks? I loved this and will be making it again soon!

These are excellent. I baked some for a party and then baked them again the next day just because. I didn't have matzo flour so used regular all-purpose flour. I'd like to try cake flour. The tops do crumble very easily, so make sure to butter *and* grease the muffin tins so they come out as easily as possible. I didn't really understand why they recommend melting the butter before greasing the tins though.
