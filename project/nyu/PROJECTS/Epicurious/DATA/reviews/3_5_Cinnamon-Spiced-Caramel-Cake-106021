I don't know how this recipe could get anything less than 4 "forks." I would have given it 5 forks if possible. The only changes I made were that I added 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and ginger (would have added cloves, too, but didn't have any on hand). I made this for my daughter's 12th birthday, and everyone loved it... kids and adults! The cakes turned out perfectly, and the caramel sauce was a great addition. The frosting was superb. As other reviewers mentioned, it was even better the second day! I WILL make this again!

Rave reviews from the whole family on this - even the non-cake eating birthday boy! Added 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg, allspice and cloves (all ground) to make it more of a spice cake as he requested, and did not put the orange in the frosting. Previous reviewers commented that the caramel wasn't thick enough, but the recipe says caramel "syrup" not sauce. I found it was absorbed nicely into the cake and everyone commented on how moist it was (even on the first day!). Will definitely make this again. Thought about using 8" pans as suggested but decided there would be more surface for syrup absorbtion with 9". Good decision. No problem with rising, perhaps previous reviewers did not beat the egg mixture long enough or overmixed the flour? Can't wait to eat leftovers tomorrow!!!

The cake is very sweet, and the caramel sauce didn't work. Not going to make this again.

Oh, PS: I was brave and I tried making the caramel stars, and they were a pain! It was really hard to get them out of the cookie cutters- most of them cracked. Sooo not worth it.

This cake was not the best cake ever. I can say that the texture was nice - it was very light and fluffy - and I was also pleased that the frosting held together pretty well (sometimes whipped cream based frostings have no structure.) BUT, as this recipe is called "Cinnamon- Spiced Caramel Cake", I was disapointed that I couldn't really taste either cinnamon or caramel. I found the strongest flavor to be the orange in the frosting. The frosting reminded me of a creamsicle... I don't particularly care for creamsicles, but if you like them, maybe you will like this cake! Maybe I would have enjoyed this cake more if I'd left out the orange, like the previous reviewer.

I have a friend who's nuts about cinnamon, and i made this cake for him on his birthday. I left out the orange peel because he's a little picky, and i forgot that business with the stars, but the cake still turned out as one of the best i've ever tasted. Everyone at the party flipped for it and wanted seconds. The caramel syrup soaked into the layers of cake perfectly and make it moist, and a nice thin layer of that frosting on the top: this cake was the bomb. I can't wait for an excuse to make it again.

This is a great cake and rather simple to put togehter. The frosting is quick and outstanding. The stars turned out great, I had one leak out of the mold because it was sitting on a warped spot on the sheetpan, but I was able to pick up the mold and move it to another spot and fill it again with no problem.

Made this for my husband's birthday, and everyone liked it. I at first thought it was pretty ordinary, but the leftovers improved each day, so by day 3 or so, I thought it was wonderful! Maybe next time I'd let it sit a day before serving it. I made snowflakes instead of stars, and they were really easy and added lots of interest. Next time I'll make little leaves and serve it for a fall dinner.

I made this as a birthday cake and everyone who ate it wants me to make it for their birthday. I usually don't like making cakes, but this one turned out wonderful and was not that tricky to make. I did omit the stars but will try them next time as the caramel was not as hard as I thought.

Basic, pound like cake. Sounded great, but was just ok. The icing is wonderful!!! I will use the icing again.

Made this for a dinner party yesterday and it was very higly acclamined. The recipe was slightly more work that I thought it would be and I omitted the stars. I didn't particularly care for the caramel sauce as I thought it made the recipe too sweet, I may try another caramel sauce recipe next time. I didn't expect the hint of orange when I tasted it but it was a suprising twist.

A very delicious and easy cake to make. Don't be intimidated by the homemade caramel- it is really quite easy. The frosting is especially good and holds up well when piped. I will make this again.

This was a big hit! I make a birthday cake every year for my sister's birthday which is on Christmas Day. Everyone exclaimed it was the best ever. The icing was so easy with great results. I would use the icing on a variety of cakes, like red velvet or devil's food. The caramel sauce did seem dark and overdone but when it is seeped into the cake it works.

This is a delicious cake, no doubt. My only complaint about it is exactly the opposite of what other reviewers are saying. To me the frosting was too sweet, it overpowered the carmel flavor in the cake. I will make this recipe again, but I will adjust the frosting so that it is not quite so sweet.

This was a nice recipe after weeks of chocolate stuff. The icing was incredible and so simple to make. The caramel stars were not easy and maybe not necessary. My caramel syrup for the cake was a little browner than I thought was appropriate, so I thought it was scorched. That led me to use only about 2/3 of the syrup and now I wish I had used it all because the flavor was great and very moist.

This cake was fabulous! High, moist layers, great flavor, very easy to make and assemble. No problem with any aspect of the recipe. My friends raved! Can't wait to make it again.

I thought the caramel sauce should have been in the cake mixture, so next time I am going to experiment and but it in the cake layers instead of making holes and brushing it on. Also thought the layers were flat. Did not look like the picture in the magazine. Frosting was the best part. It got rave reviews, because most folks thought it was a sugar frosting. Nothing like real whip cream on a cake!

I made this cake twice and recieved great reviews each time. The cake layers were a little thin, so I might use an 8 inch pan the next time. The caramel sauce was more like a sugar syrup.

I made this for our Christmas Eve Mexican buffet and received generally positive comments. I loved the frosting but thought the cake was average -- needed less baking and/or more syrup. My husband loved the cake and thought no changes were necessary.

I made this cake for a holiday party at my office, and everyone raved about it. I did have a little trouble with carmelizing the sugar on the first try, but I made the cake again for Christmas day, and seemed to do better the second time (I think the key was to make sure the sugar was completely dissolved before bringing it to a boil). It was very moist, and the icing is delicious. Fantastic!!

I had hoped for this to be my star dessert recipe for Thanksgiving but was disappointed. The cake layers were tasty but very flat and my caramel sauce never caramelized, despite following directions closely. I ended up using jarred caramel instead. Did anyone have better luck with this recipe than me?
