This is our second time with this recipe and it is unbelievably wonderful, especially with the carrot-ginger cake my hubby just made! What a great combo!

I made this to use up some leftover creme fraiche and buttermilk I had in the fridge. I had no lemon juice, so I squeezed in half a grapefruit. I also followed a recent Cook's Illustrated tip and used a bit of corn syrup in place of some of the sugar. It came out great.

I hate to be a naysayer here since everyone else loved this recipe, but I just didn't like the flavor. I have made Creme Fraiche ice cream before and admittedly, this recipe is way easier. But, on the down side, I thought it tasted like Buttermilk ice cream rather than the delicate Creme Fraiche.

Superb. Decadent. Easy. What more could you ask?

A truly easy yet satisfying recipe. Ia lso used superfine suger (to reduce the graininess) and cut the creme fraiche in half (I bough the last tub!) and made up the difference with heavy cream. Still amazing, and perky tart. A winner!

I followed the suggestion to use superfine sugar and some evaporated milk in place of buttermilk (I used a 5 oz can and made up the rest of the 2 cups with the buttermilk). The other change I made was to use juice from naturally-sweet yellow limes instead of lemons. The results were spectacular. It's a very rich yet refreshing dessert. Exceptionally good with fresh strawberries and blueberries.

for smoother ice cream: substitute 1/2 cup evaporated milk for an equal amount of the buttermilk. Also, I would make a custard, but if you're not going to do that, use baker's sugar (castor or super-fine), that will help the texture a lot!

A wonderful blend of creamy and tart. I made this for my mother (a true ice cream junkie) and the look on her face said it all. I would make this again as a light and clear tasting ice cream especially for summer.

It tasted good, but the texture was a bit icy and not smooth. I used an electric ice cream maker, but I think that it would be smoother if a custard was made first. I will probably try making a custard first, next time. Good with strawberries or poached figs.

I like the fact that this ice cream doesn't contain any eggs. There is no fuss nor muss with making a custard first. It is quick and delicious. Very creamy! Just the right amount of tang from the lemon and buttermilk. Lovely with fresh blueberries!
