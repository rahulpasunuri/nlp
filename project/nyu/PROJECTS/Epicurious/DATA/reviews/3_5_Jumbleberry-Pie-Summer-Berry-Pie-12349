I followed everyone's suggestions: upped the cornstarch to 1/2 c + 3 tbsp, used a lattice crust instead of a full double crust, carefully patted the berries dry after washing. I even didn't use a good portion of the filling because it seemed too much for the crust. And still...this was a soupy disaster! It actually started leaking through the lattice crust in the oven! Very, very messy, very much a headache, and even after baking it longer and letting it cool for over two hours, when we cut in it was like a bowl of berry soup. Having said that, it *tasted* delicious, and one of my guests graciously offered that it was like a berry cobbler. So it wasn't a total failure, but this would need a SERIOUS re-work before I'd go anywhere near it again.

Made a second pie (see review immediately below)... used a lattice crust (to let additional steam/moisture escape) and baked for an additional 5 minutes, again doubling the cornstarch. This time... it was a bit too thick! There has to be a happy medium to get just the right consistency!

After reading previous reviews, I doubled the cornstarch, used fresh berries (patted dry after washing), and let it cool several hours before cutting, but still ended up with a VERY soupy pie. However, it tasted great scooped over ice cream... the right proportion of sugar and spice to fruit. So, I plan on trying again... perhaps letting it bake a bit longer to ensure the juices have time to thicken. (I took out at the lower end of the baking time range.)

Fantastic pie with great flavor! I increased cornstarch to 1/2C + 3tbs as suggested making the filling set up perfectly. I also let the pie cool for a 1/2 hr before cutting.

I made this recipe using the tapioca instead of cornstarch (1/3 c) and I made sure that the berries were dry. It was a big hit and I would definitely make it again. I did not make the crust recipe here but another pie crust recipe. The sugar and milk really gives it a great brown top!

Excellent! I made with the modifications on the corn starch as mentioned, 1/2cup + 3 TBS. It was perfect and easy to cut. This is a summertime keeper.

I avoided the juiciness mentioned by reading reviews, but found the taste of this pie just okay. I have made other mixed berry pies which were far more interesting in flavor. And you wouldn't even guess there were blueberries in it. Afraid I give it just a "so-so".

omigosh....I am SOOOOO glad that I returned to this recipe and read the reviews!! I made the pie with fresh black- and boysenberries, but decided to use up some frozen blueberries. I thought maybe that's why I ended up with jumbleberry soup! Obviously, from reading the other reviews, I just needed to dry the berries and increase the cornstarch. Will definetly try it again; the flavor was wonderful....we ate (or should I say, drank!) the entire pie!!

After reading the reviews, I decided to add an extra 3T of corn starch to keep the pie from being watery. I also let the berries dry on paper towels after rinsing. It worked great -- the pie texture was perfect. I had only whole-wheat flour on hand so I used that and everyone commented on how much they liked the modification.

use flour instead of cornstarch for any berry pie, make your favorite pie crust and it's very good. using cornstarch..you'll need to let it stand for 15 minutes or so, to help it thicken the filling.

I picked some berries over a year ago and had frozen them. I didn't know if the berries were still good but decided to use this recipe with them. Because the berries were frozen and after reading the other reviews, I probably more than doubled the cornstarch. The berries were also tart so I doubled the sugar too. I cheated on the crust and used Pillsbury. The pie turned out fine. The top crust looked especially nice with the half&half and sprinkled sugar.

I loved the filling, but after the first time when I found the pastry far too thin, I now make it with my usual buttermilk pastry recipe and it becomes a four fork recipe.

yeah, jumbleberry soup, as one reviewer below called it. others recommended increasing cornstarch to 1/2+ cups. anyone try that? seems like it would turn into jello-mold-in-a-crust. looking for tips from successful berry pie bakers...

I have made this pie at least 50 times. It is a family and friend favorite.

Oh, wow, this pie was so terrific. I baked it for dessert for last year's Independence Day barbecue. Next time I'll add a little more corn starch, though.

Jumbleberry soup! I know the previous reviewers warned you that the filling never thickened up, I still thought I would try it. What a waste of ingredients. The only saving grace is that the filling tasted great over ice cream and the edge of crust (the only part that wasn't mushy) was nice and flaky.

Wanted to use fresh-frozen peaches and strawberries from summertime, so used 4 c. of each and doubled the cornstarch. Next time will try the tapioca. Mmmmmmm.

This is a wonderfully flavorful pie. The melange of berries is truly delightful! Since I live in Hawaii, access to berries during the winter months is somewhat limited. I used a wonderful blueberry, raspberry and marionberry frozen mix from Sam's Club. I increased the cornstarch to 1/2 cup, however, still found the pie to be a bit more watery than what I would have liked. In the future I would definitely increase the cornstarch to even more than 1/2 cup. Especially using frozen berries! I highly recommend this recipe!

One good way to reduce the amount of juice in this pie is to bake the berries in a dish until they release their juice and then drain them. (You can save the juice to serve over ice cream or to flavour other desserts.)

What a great pie! I had to substitute just blueberries and nectarines for the melange of berries. Added a little extra cornstarch, as recommended by others. Recipe calls for a ton of fruit-- my pan was brimming over. Nothin' wrong with that, though!

My second Jumbleberry Pie of the season is in the oven as we speak. It is a wonderful summer pie. I increased the cornstarch and still had a lot of juice in the shell before it went into the oven so try reserving some of the juice before you put on the top crust. Firmed up nicely with the added cornstarch. Enjoy!!

What a terrific summer fruit pie. I was a little short on berries, and made up the difference with about two cups of peeled peaches. I too used tapioca as the thickening agent, and used twice the amount of cinnamon, but no nutmeg. I also used another crust recipe. I was skeptical about using lemon juice in the filling, but it was perfect.

I used strawberries, rasberries and blueberries. I also used a recipe for crust from Joy of Cooking that I love. I increased the cornstarch and the pie came out awesome.

First, I must confess, I took several shortcuts, as I was in a hurry (pre-made crusts, FROZEN berries,and plain jane vanilla icecream)and still it was YUMOLA! A hit and took less than 10 minutes to prepare!(sweet) I used rasberries, blackberris and strawberries. Not being a fan of overly sweet desserts, i was tempted to cut the sugar amt, but at the last minute decided to stick with the recipie and was glad i did. It was not too sweet and balanced the tartness of the rasberries. I did increase the cornstarch amt. as one reader suggessted and didn't have a problem with the excess liguid. Since i used frozen berries, I did have some lack of shape with the berries but it didn't hurt the taste.

Excellent pie, but omit cornstarch; substitute equal amount of quick cooking tapioca mixed with the sugar; blend into the berries and leave for at least 15 minutes before proceeding. This procedure reduces runniness. If you allow pie to cool completely, it is also less runny.

The flavor of this pie cannot be beat. The only problem I have found is that the pie doesn't always firm up properly, turning out as more of a souce in a shell than a nice servable pie. Try a little extra corn starch.

Jumbleberry Pie has become one of our favorite things about summer. It is the perfect way to enjoy the fresh summer berries. The crust is perfect, very light. I have made it many times and everyone asks for more.
