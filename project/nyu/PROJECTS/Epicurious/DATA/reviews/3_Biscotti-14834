This biscotti recipe is delicious, but more of a shortbread biscotti than a traditional one. My logs pretty much retained their shape resulting in a short biscotti, but I was not surprised since you do not melt the butter and you are supposed to cook while the butter is cold. If you want them to spread out I would try melting the butter before mixing it in and then letting the logs get to room temp before baking. I only got a few crumbs while cutting them and I did it straight out of the oven. Make sure you have a super sharp knife and don't move it back and forth too much, use more downward pressure, doing so I avoided most crumbs. I love anise, lemon and almonds so I thought the overall flavor was fantastic. I would make these again, but next time add another egg and decrease the butter so that they are less soft and more of a crisp biscotti.

This is a wonderful recipe. I have made it several times always with great success.

So easy - you do not even need to cream the butter. I used a blend of macadamia, apricot kernels (poor mans almonds from TJs) pine nuts for the almonds and subbed pepitas for the pistachios. Also fennel seed for the anise. Tasty & so very easy!

Everyone I know loves these Biscotti!!! I teach in an inner city school and cook with my students. They love making these by hand, and of course eating them with tea. I have made these many, many times

I would like to send great thanks to the person from Tuscany Hills,Ca. who wrote the hint about using an electric knife to cut the biscotti. It was sent in November 03. I would love to thank her personally, but know this is impossible. It works so well.

This was my first attempt at making biscotti and it was alot easier than I thought it would be. I'm not sure if toasting the almonds is really necessary but you have to be really careful not to burn them. Also, i cut the cookies AFTER they cooled. It was much easier, the cookies tended to fall to pieces if you cut them when they come right out of the oven.

I love the flavor of this biscotti, but I ended up with almost as much crumble as I did cookie. Also, after being in the oven for only 20 min, the almonds gave off a very toasty smell but by then they were a bit overdone. For my first biscotti attempt, I'm not too discouraged.

I loved this recipe. The anise seed gave it a surprise after taste that was delicious. For the best treat, dip the biscotti in a sweet marsala, or vin santo. It will melt in your mouth.

Not a big fan of anise (i know, blasphemy) so I use double the lemon zest and an equal amount of orange zest. Very flavorful and rich.

I didn't have anise on hand so substituted with ouzo (1-1/2 tbls). It gave the biscotti just a hint of anise/licorise flavor - just the way I like them. Living at a high altitude I had to adjust the baking time and recommend the second baking for everyone. I had a few crumble during slicing but I saved the larger crumbs and used them to top ice cream.

Haven't made this recipe. Just searching. Wanted to pass on a neat idea by chef Alton Brown. Use an electric knife to cut the biscotti. Just tried it on another biscotti recipe and it works great!

Loved the combination of Anis and Lemon such a fresh combination, my first batch I tried to make it into logs, but became all one sheet of Biscotti, still I sliced it and seperated and baked it the second time came out delicious but got a zero for presentation. So I repeated a second batch, this time I pulsed the nuts with some sugar in the food processor, and instead of logs I rolled the dough, which taste great, then chilled it and egg washed it. Perfect this time . Jacques Torres is one of my favorite chefs, he is so talented, I knew his recipe must be good.

I had been looking for a biscotti recipe that I had used in the past, when I stumbled upon this one. After reading positive reviews, I decided to attempt to make it. The recipe is simple and easy to follow. Uncertain about the anise, I too, decided to omit. The outcome, disappointing! The recipe did not yield the amount stated. And mine, too, came out small and crumbly. Definitely not the recipe I had tried once before that earned praise.

Loved this recipe. It was easy to make and the results were amazing. The biscotti has great flavor with a hint of orange that grows stronger with time. I tried substituting maple syrup for the honey and the biscotti was equally good.

I added a few drops of White Sambuca instead. Very flavoursome, the flavours gradually come through. I dipped the tops in molten chocolate to get some 'brownie' point with my wife. It worked! If not crisp enough, keep them in the oven on low heat to really dry out.

I, like the tester, omitted the anise seed because I do not like their taste. The result was delicious and lemony. My only caveats: this recipie does NOT yield 5 1/2 dozen substantial biscottis; all mine wound up mini-size. Also, when I sliced the logs into pieces, I found much crumbling. Cut these quickly after they have cooled a little.

A very good recipe. Easy to make and pleases everybody around the house. I modified the basic recipe by adding some chocolate chips. It gives a pretty tasty result.

I found at first that maybe the biscotti were too brown for my liking. However, I found the flavour wonderful. This is an easy recipe and I have been able to easily substitute ingredients. I used cardamom instead of fennel and it gave the recipe a gingery flavour. An easy recipe for first time biscotti bakers.
