Find another recipe because you have to doctor this one up so much that you might as well have been making something else.

Despite all the poor reviews, I ended up really liking this dish...albeit with many of the recommended modifications. I added red bell pepper along with the other veggies, plus more curry paste (about 1.5 Tbsp), more lime juice, and about 1 Tbsp fish sauce. I also cooked down the sauce to concentrate the flavors a bit more before adding back in the veggies. It was absolutely delicious.

This dish does not even deserve one fork. This was one of the worst dishes I have made from this site. Usually, other dishes need a little tweaking--this one was not even worth trying. Very very bland. Tasteless. don't bother. I am usually not very harsh with these reviews but this dish was not salvageable.

This was a weird dish. While I love all the ingredients, it came out strangely bland. I followed the instructions, more or less, but upped the ginger and added a log more lime and peanut butter because another review called it too bland and during my taste tests of the sauce, it never had enough flavor. I ended up with a bland mess. My husband and I ate it the next day and it was not much better. The dish smells great while cooking, but was disappointing in the end.

This is a good recipe, but could use some tweaking - especially if you're not a die-hard ginger fan. What I'd do differently: ~ grate ginger instead of matchstick pieces ~ less curry (i like my foods flavorful but not difficult to eat (read: mild/mild-spicy)). What I actually did differently: ~ used snap peas instead of carrots ~ used regular soy-sauce instead of low-sodium ~ added Vietnamese fried shrimp balls and Chinese scallop balls (both come cooked) ~ didn't use any of the nut and mint garnish. Final verdict: Could use some depth...not sure what was missing, but next time I will experiment with using a Thai fish or shrimp paste.

To add to some of the other reviews, very disappointing. The matchstick veggies were a lot of work. i was excited to eat something that seemed healthy. I made it exactly to recipe. It was very bland and runny despite the spices and mint.

I was very dissapointed with this dish. I put a lot of effort into chopping all the veggies matchstick style and was looking forward to a great end result but I found this very bland and runny. I would not make this again.

I made this recipe but was not satisfied with the results. I had to doctor it so much that the end result didn't even resemble the original. I found this recipe tasteless and unimaginative. However, with a dash of fish sauce, sugar, Kaffir leaves, lemongrass and a splash of peanut sauce you're on your way to yummy noodles.

like others suggested, i added a little fish sauce since it seemed to be lacking something. I don't undertsnd omitting the mint- it was delicious.

I added shrimp and changed the mint to cilantro and left out the peanuts. I have made this with whole wheat flour noodles instead of rice noodles, it is just as good.

Quite good and could be great with some modifications. I agree that it's a touch bland and so I think more coconut milk and fish sauce would both be good additions. Cutting the veggies into matchstick size is a bit time consuming and tedious, but it's appropriate. I used green and red peppers instead of zuchini and felt they worked very well.

I made this dish the other night and my boyfriend and I loved it. I added green pepper, mushrooms instead of the suggested zucinni (yuk). Also, I skipped the nuts and mint. Next time, I'll add a little corn starch to the sauce as I found it a little thin. Otherwise an amazing dish! Just spicy enough. Yum Yum!!!

It was fantastic. This was my first time making this dish. We all enjoyed it very much, including our guests. Try it. You will LOVE it!

After having read the other reviews, I added red curry paste and salt. These can be used to taste. I also added broccoli, which worked out great. With those thoughts in mind, the recipe is fantastic. I'll definately make it again, incorporating other veggies.

Used fresh Chinese lo mein noodles, whole can of coconut milk (14 oz) and a bit less water, added 2 tbsp of fish sauce (nam pla) to the coconut milk sauce, 3 tsp of red curry for a ton of heat. Made for a smooth, very spicy, satisfying dish. Next time, less red curry, a basil garnish, and a tbsp of lime juice to make it more Thai-style.

Rarely does a noodle dish go uneaten at our house. This one did. I'm not even quite sure why, really. The ingredients are all ones we enjoy, but somehow, the end result was lacking.

I thought this was great. I used bok-choy, peppers, and brocolli instead of the suggested veggies; and angel hair pasta instead of somen (what I had). I didn't use nuts or mint (I don't like those). It worked great. I loved the sauce - perfectly flavourfull and spicy.

I found this recipe to be bland. I expected a nice, rich sauce, and was disappointed by the result.

This recipe is great!! I made a few improvisations with what I had in my refirgerator. I used two persian cucumbers instead of zucchini and added it towards the end (it was great). I also used Thai rice noodles and peanut butter instead of peanuts and a whole 14 oz. can of lite coconut milk (but I do love coconut milk). This dish is very flavorful and filling. A week after making it the first time, I made it for my vegetarian brother and he enjoyed it a great deal.

Tasty and worked well even as a "salad", not hot. I used zucchini (see other comments) and it worked great, not mushy and really tasty all together.

We loved this dish -- even my picky 11-year-old daughter. I made a couple of changes based on what I had on hand: hot Indian curry paste instead of Thai (about a teaspoon), green pepper instead of zucchini -- a better match for this dish, or cucumber added late would have been good. I also used peanut butter added to the sauce -- a few tablespoons -- because I didn't have peanuts. It worked fine. I used about a third of the mint -- I might use more next time. I was worried about all that ginger but it was great.

Yum! I used egg noodles and added yellow peppers and chicken. Skipped the zucchini, didn't miss it, and would probably be too "mushy" a texture for my taste in this particular dish. I used a little extra curry paste for added heat.

this dish was ok-I would make it again using 1/2 lite coconut milk and 1/2 regular milk, as it was too coconutty for my taste. Also, I used whole wheat fettucine noodles because it was what I had and it turned out fine. It's a good way to get those extra veggies.
