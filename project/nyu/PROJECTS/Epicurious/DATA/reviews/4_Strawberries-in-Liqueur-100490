A simple and delicious dessert that works great in the summer. I soaked the fruit in grand marnier as suggested. The flavor was not overbearing as I expected, there was just enough. I served it atop shortbread and made lemon whipped cream to throw on top. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/LEMON-WHIPPED-CREAM-234449

Delicious! I use the brandy and serve it with whipped cream and pound cake!

I needed a fast dessert. Prepared lemon or pound cake and these strawberries- delicious. I used peach brandy. Yummy!!!

Try this: instead of the Brandy, substitute Grand Marnier! Yummy

Simple, yet wonderfully tasty. Next time I might try to use a cab or merlot in place of the brandy, as one of the other reviewers suggested.

I used left over red wine. Merlot or cabernet. Freeze it for 30 minutes, then keep in refridgerator until serving. Serve in a balloon wine glass. You'll end up drinking the syrupy wine. Like sangria..

If you love strawberries all on their own the banana liqueur just adds a subtle bit of flavour without taking anything away from the strawberries. I've tried it twice, but next time I might serve them over vanilla ice cream with brandy.
