This is the worst pastry cream recipe that I have ever tried. It was more like a firm paste with no flavor whatsoever except that it was sweet. I rated it with one spoon but in reality it deserves no spoons.

Perfect for a fresh fruit tart! I had to make a flat crust so I needed a very substantial filling - this was IT. Be careful at the end of cooking; it's easy to think it's done when it's not. Keep tasting for raw flour when in doubt. This recipe is SO not hard and uses basic pantry items - it beats the hell out of doctored-up pudding mix ANY day.

Great pastry cream - really fills a birthday cake well. I found it too thick to press it through the seive I had, so I put it through the finest setting on my food mill. The result was a very smooth cream in much shorter time than trying to press it.

Excellent, thick pastry cream with lots of uses. I add 8 oz. of whipped heavy cream to light up the pasty cream a bit as I was filling heart-shaped puff pastry and wanted something just a bit lighter. This recipe is very easy, especially when you follow the excellent instructions. It does, however, make 'tons' as one other reviewer posted. I only made 1/2 the recipe and am now headed into the kitchen to make cream puffs to use up the rest of this delicious pastry cream!

Sorry! This is just too much trouble - I reverted to good old pudding mixed with whipped cream, thickened with a little unflavored gelatin.

Great recipe for those who like to do their own thing. It was good to find a pastry cream recipe that actually holds up in pastries and not one that's more like a pudding. This was thick enough to cut the pastry without it running all over the place. It's easy and tastes great in anything you'd want pastry cream. I cooked it in a double boiler instead of just a pan on the stove top (avoides lumps better). Also I cut the recipe in half, the original recipe made a TON of pastry cream. If it seems bland, well, it's pastry cream; what do you expect? Pastry cream is filler for good pastry. I ve also spiced it up with Grande Marnier and orange zest; other times espresso coffee; still others with chocolate. It's hardly bland if your creative enough.

THE RECIPE PRODUCED A BLAND PASTY RESULT. I AM AN EXECUTIVE CHEF AND FOUND THIS THE WORST .
