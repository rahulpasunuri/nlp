This was a first for me. I read reviews for this recipe and the May 1995 Gourmet recipe for lemon meringue pie. Both were nearly identical in ingredients except for slight variations in quantity, the Gourmet recipe used some milk (as several reviewers suggested) instead of just water for the custard and this recipe called for cream of tarter in the meringue. I stuck more closely to this recipe as the ingredient volume was slightly larger ( I have a 10" pie pan) and the custard preparation was simpler. I did use 50% water and 50% milk for the custard and slightly more lemon than called for. I also made a graham cracker crust. Next time I would pump up the lemon a bit more and maybe go 1/3 milk and two thirds water. I had no trouble getting a thick custard -- you just keep cooking until you do. As for weeping, I am not sure exactly what the other reviewers were referring to. I thought they were referring to the custard. Now I think they may have meant the meringue. My meringue had some very tiny caramel colored drops form on the outside of the meringue after it was refrigerated. This did not affect taste or seem to be a big deal. All in all, it was a fun dessert to make and serve.

I've never made LM Pie before but this was not too hard to do. It had a wonderful flavor and was a big seller at our fundraiser. The only problem was that it was a little watery but I was still able to make decent looking slices. Maybe it wasn't refrigerated long enough or maybe I didn't cool down the filling enough. Next time I'll refrigerate the filling before making the meringue. I used graham cracker crust which got a little soggy on the sides. Next time I will use regular pie crust.

Great pie. I read the other comments and increased the egg yolks to 6 and the cornstarch to 6T. It was nice and thick the way I love it. Thanks.

I'm an experienced baker. I knew to cook the filling a long time, much longer than the recipe calls for, in order to make the filling thick. In fact, my wooden spoon could almost have stood up in the cooked filling. I'd even added an extra yolk and a little extra cornstarch to the filling, because I wanted a pretty, firm pie to serve to guests. I took the filling off the stove and added the lemon juice. This immediately made the filling thin, but it was following the directions, and I thought it would thicken up again after baking, and then refrigeration. It was in my fridge for 6 hours. When I cut into it, I had beautiful meringue over tangy lemon soup. If there is another recipe that actually will make a pie, I'd love to know which one it is.

Good flavour, filling was a touch wobblier than I prefer, would add another tablespoon of cornstarch in the future.

simple and fantastic. A happy household requesting that I make it more often. I used fresh Meyer lemons from my brother in laws tree, thank you!

I don't quite understand the cooks who ended up with runny lemon filling. You need to let it thicken until it is lemon curd consistency and then it's perfect. This recipe makes an impressive and very tasty pie--and it's actually easy to make. Everyone loved it.

This is the best lemon meringue pie recipe ever! Have never had this one turn out bad, it's great every time. After using the recipe for years, I entered it in the county fair and won first place!!!

I had no problem with the filling; however, I must confess that I increased the cornstarch in the filling to 6 TBS. I do suggest one change to make life easier. Don't worry about the butter being room temp. Just add the cold butter (cut in smaller pieces) to the thick, hot filling. Whisk until butter is melted, then whisk in the lemon juice. Also, for my taste, I will reduce the sugar in the meringue. It was much too sweet for me.

I made this pie twice and got great results both times. Was a little worried after reading the reviews, but it set up nice and firm both times just following the recipe. Excellent tangy lemon flavor and a billowy mountain of meringue - couldn't ask for a more impressive pie than this one.

This is the best lemon pie I've ever made. After reading some of the reviews, I was a little skeptical, so I add large tablespoons of cornstarch and it thicken in less than a minute. I was waiting for something bad to happen but it didn't and we finished the pie in one night.

Do not be lured by promises of bake-sale Glory: the recipe is a *LEMON*. I suspect the positive posts are being submitted by the competition. I copy-pasted the introductory spiel on to a better recipe: "Lemon Meringue Bites."

I made this pie before I read the reviews which might have stopped me from making it. I had absolutely wonderful results just following the recipe. I waited until it boiled, and then I think I only cooked it for 1 minute more before I had a very thick lemon curd. The pie turned out to be a beautiful work of art, and know it will taste as good as it looks because I taste as I go. I rate this 4 forks without a doubt.

I tried making this for the first time and made lemon soup, but made a few adjustments which worked GREAT !! When the recipe says thicken...they mean thicken !! The consistancy was of a very thick paste, but took 10 or so minutes. I added 2-3 tablespoons of cake flour, which help keep its shape in addition to 1/2 c of cornstarch. Try this, you will have better success.

I use this recipe every time I have a cookout. I'm a bigger fan of graham cracker crusts than pastry crusts. The filling works well with that crust as well.

I was really excited about making this lemon pie for my family this Memorial Day...even took the advice of previews that said to cook the lemon filling to a paste-like consistency to get it really thick. Well, I did...for a much longer time than 2 minutes. And guess what! The pies didn't set up. They were just like soup. Pretty, but runny. Needless to say, dessert wasn't as I had hoped. I had to make a no-fail blueberry cobbler instead. Oh well, live and learn.

If you are looking for a superior recipe for lemon soup with meringue, this recipe is for you! The recipe (if followed as is) is beyond flawed, and I echo the sentiment of others that it should be removed from the site, or at the least revised. I could not get the curd to set, and was left with a nice meringue to top lemon liquid! Best to follow the advice of others, and either not make the recipe or make necessary adjustments. This recipe is not for beginner bakers, or those who bake for an ego boost! This recipe near crushed my domestic goddess spirit!

We adore this pie, and have it more often than we should. Every time I return to the site to print out a clean copy of the recipe, I read the additional reviews posted. Some folks end up with a runny pie. Here's what I think happens: The recipe says, "Whisk until mixture THICKENS, about 2 minutes." Pay attention to the consistency, not the clock. When they say THICKENS, they mean, THICKENS. When the filling is ready, it is incredibly thick, thicker than you might think it should be - even leaving the bottom of the saucepan as you stir. Almost paste-like. [am I driving this message home?] The lemon juice added later thins it down. The resulting pie is firm and delicious with well-formed lemony slices and mountains of meringue. Oh, and as an afterthought, here's the crust we use when we're feeling ambitious: 2-1/2 cups of flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, (throw this in a food processor) add 2 sticks of chilled butter (process 8-10 seconds), add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of ice water and process 30 seconds. Chill dough. You can read the complete recipe on the MarthaStewart.com website. Hope this is helpful to you. Enjoy.

I made a few modifications and the pie turned out beautifully. Reduce water to 1 1/4 cups. Bring only sugar, cornstarch, salt and water to boil before adding egg yolks and then continue to boil and whisk about 5 minutes until mixture gets very thick. Then stir in lemon juice, butter and lemon zest right before you pour into pie crust.

I have tried many lemon meringue pies, by far this is a great recipe. I use milk instead of water and follow the rest. I beat extra egg whites to make the meringue really high. This pie always gets rave reviews from my guests.

This recipe should be removed from your index for all the reasons listed by prior reviewers--baked as instructed, it simply does not make a satisfactory pie. Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews until after I attempted to make it!!

Have made this many times, to rave reviews. I like to make a very sweet, short crust to put the filling into.

Definitely something missing in this recipe. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of water and a lot more arrowroot just to get it past the consistency of gravy. However, good flavor- just do not follow this recipe religiously; make necessary adjustments before you pour it into the pie shell.

Rigaud, Quebec. Have made this receipe four times. Took the advice of one your responses and used milk instead of water. The filling is not firm but everyone loves the fresh lemon taste. I use 8 to 10 egg whites to give the pie a spectacular look .

I agree with the reviewers who gave this recipe rave reviews. I read all the comments and made the following modifications. I used whole milk instead of water, used 5 tablespoons of arrowroot, and cut the sugar in the filling to 1 cup (I like my lemon pie tart). The filling was just the right consistency. I served it for Thanksgiving and everyone was delighted! (I'm normally not a dessert maker)

I feel compelled to comment after reading the other reviews of this recipe. The first time I made this recipe it knocked everyone's socks off. It's the ONLY lemon meringue pie I now make. The filling is tangy and sweet. The meringue is fluffy and bountiful. My husband and friends can't get enough of it. Confessional: In a pinch, I've resorted to a Pillsbury ready made crust and it's still very good. I don't experience the runny filling...this recipe has lots of cornstarch in it to keep it firm. Maybe the success we Floridians have with this recipe has something to do with climate. Who can say? I can't imagine ever finding a better lemon meringue pie recipe.

Very good BUT try substituting milk (whole, 2%, 1%, whatever) for the water. This gives a creamy filling that is not what is usually seen. (For exact details consult a Joy of Cooking). If using milk I think I would try 5 T cornstarch for a more tender filling. Let it cool well. Also, for nonweepy meringue: beat egg whites and cream of tartar until foamy, sprinkle on the sugar and LET IT SIT FOR 5 MINUTES. Then, beat as usual. This really works!

Hard to get filling to proper consistancy. Meringue is beautiful, BUt the recipie needs work. If you follow the directions, you end up with a runny mess that never sets properly. When you remove the first piece, the filling gushes out from the rest of the pie. Tried a second time, and ended up with a gummy mess by cooking longer. I think the filling is in need of some dairy products as well. This is NOT A RELIABLE recipie.

Have now made this twice - absolutely fantastic!!! Use freshly squeezed lemon juice.

I can't wait to make this delicious pie again. It was easy to make (I used a pre-made butter crust), and everyone at the office just loved it - particularly the creamy filling, which everyone agreed won hands down over the jello-type fillings that you often see. Several people pronounced it 'the BEST lemon meringue pie I've ever had'!
