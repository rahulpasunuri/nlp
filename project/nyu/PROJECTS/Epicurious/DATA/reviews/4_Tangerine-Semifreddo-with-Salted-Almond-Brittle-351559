Delicious recipe, can be simplified with a couple of changes. First of all, this makes far too much brittle, you only need about 1/4 of the recipe. Secondly, it is too much work to make your own almond brittle, next time I will purchase a ready made high quality equivalent at a proper confiserie. Finally, as recommended by previous reviewers, just mix in the brittle pieces in the mixture, then pour in the loaf pan, the layering is really not necessary and too much trouble. The sauce is exceptional, I will double it next time as this is a very large recipe, will easily serve 10 but there is not enough sauce for even 8 servings.

Have made this several times in the past two years, but only now am getting around to writing a review of it. This is a favorite make-ahead-to-impress-the-company dessert.

Amazing dessert for company! It can be made ahead of time though I had it in the freezer by 8 am for a 7 pm dinner without problems. Recommendations-easily serves 20 by cutting each slice in half. Can also get 12 slices from the loaf-the pan does slightly overflow as described which makes a robust slice. Drizzling the sauce is better than trying to pool it--looks much better. The brittle-next time I will spread on 2 sheets (use silpat-very easy clean up) so that the brittle is thinner, then the broken pieces go into the layers better. 3/4 cup between layers leaves a lot left over, next time will divide and use more BUT save back a some large pieces to stick up in freddo for presentation height.

The brittle is amazing, I plan to make it for holiday gifts this year. As for the semifreddo, I made it first following to a "t". I thought it was too orangey/bitter, although my husband liked it. The second time I made it, I cut back on the zest to only 1 T and 2 tsp, and I found the flavor much smoother without the bitterness. Also, the first time we thought the brittle was a distraction and took away from the semifrddo, the 2nd time I chopped it much finer and probably used only 1/2 cup total. Well put by my stepson, "its good, but not one of the best desserts you've made." 4 forks on the brittle though

This was great and worth the time and effort. Made it in shooter glasses with the items layered. It looked fantastic.

Everyone raved about this dessert. The brittle is fabulous and makes tons. Worth the trouble. The semifreddo takes lots of bowls but so nice to have it in the freezer a day ahead of serving. The texture is divine and flavor light. Yum!

Wonderful, light summery dessert. The best part is that there's a LOT of leftover brittle. I also used whole unblanched almonds. The temperatures were misleading for higher altitude cooking (even after making adjustments), but if you just cook the brittle until it's deep amber and the custard until it thickens enough to coat a spoon, everything works out fine.

Wow! This is truly delicous. The semifreddo is subtely flavored and contrasts so nicely with the reduction and brittle. I put it into 32 tiny martini glasses for a stunning presentation. Could not cover it, really, so good thing it was only in the freezer for 2 days, but it was a perfect make-ahead dessert. Don't worry if you can't find blanched almonds - I used natural ones that I toasted and they were delicious as well. This dessert makes an excellent impression.

OH MY!!! This is an amazing dessert! WOW! Absolutely rave reviews from everyone. The brittle is good on it's own,and definitely worth the effort. I added Grand Marnier to the sauce at the end of the cooking, and then because it was a little too sweet some extra tangelo juice. Yes, there are allot of dishes, but it is so worth it!!! I will definitely make this again and again. May try some variations too.

Delicious - a few steps, but easy to make. I used a regular loaf pan and two smaller loaf pans and I had enough for 16 people. I also left one of smaller loaf pans in the freezer for a few weeks and the brittle was still crunchy and the flavour was more concentrated.

I am giving 4 forks for the Almond Brittle that was fantastic! The Semifredo itself, was good as well. I added vanilla bean to mine and it worked great. Not too sweet and very light texture. Will I make it again? The Brittle for sure. But, the Semifredo... with so many choices for great desserts...I doubt.

Perfection. I made this for a New Year's Eve dinner party and like a previous reviewer, there was silence while people were devouring! It received rave reviews and convinced them that I am a gourmet cook . . . which I'm not! Yes, it is very labor intensive but worth every minute and dirty dish. I was assigned the dessert for the dinner party and it traveled very easily to our friends' home and was extremely easy to plate. The recipe made more than would fit in my loaf pan so I ended up with 6 extra muffin sized desserts to enjoy at home, I just had to whip up another sauce. I am actually looking forward to making this again!

Almond brittle is amazing by itself! Loved the texture of the final product. The tangerine/honey reduction is a must. I'm not sure layering the mousse and brittle was necessary. Next time I will simply fold in the brittle pieces and freeze as individual servings in large muffin tins. The tangerines had lots of seeds, so getting segments was virtually impossible, it was more like "bits". Next round I may also try with orange. Overall this was really excellent flavor and texture and if nothing else we'll make the brittle again and again!

I made this as an extra dessert for Thanksgiving and had rave reviews from the family. Although this was the first time I had made any type of brittle, I thought your instructions were easy to follow, even though I think I let the syrup go a tad too long , it still tasted good. A very good flavor combination, almonds, brittle, and the tangarine whipped cream flavor together was wonderful. I loved it.

I made this four our small (4 couples) gourmet group, and there was total silence while it was being comsumed. Fortunately, that was a good thing! The recipe is not difficult but does take a while. The brittle is wonderful, though half as much would have been plenty.

This dessert is well worth the effort and dirty dishes (I used so many bowls, spatulas, whisks etc.). My loaf pans were smaller than the required size so I got two semifreddos. I froze one despite the note that the recipe was best consumed in the first 2 days.

Worth the time and effort. Very light texture, intense orange flavor, brittle is a great contrast.

OMGosh, this dessert wowed my guests last night. My husband thought the Meyer Lemon Semifreddo with Summer Berries was his all-time favorite dessert (on this site), until I made this one. A bit time-consuming, but well worth it. I'd give it more forks if I could!

Absolutely loved this dessert! Nice tangerine flavor throughout. Not too sweet. The layered almond brittle gives this dessert the 4 forks. A bit time consuming but worth it!
