Very quick and easy, an apt choice for my first time making creme Anglaise. Using stick cinnamon as opposed to ground makes a world of difference in the flavor. Take care not to stir it over the heat for too long or it will curdle as mine did. Not the most attractive sight but was delicious with Guinness gingerbread.
