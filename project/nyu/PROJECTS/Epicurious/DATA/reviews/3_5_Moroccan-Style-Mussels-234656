I wanted to love this, especially after reading the reviews, but I thought it was just OK. The leftover "sauce" is nice, and I'm planning to eat it for lunch over couscous today, but the specific combination of mussels and chickpeas is not, in my opinion, all that successful. I love both chickpeas and mussels individually, but don't think either the flavors or the textures go together that well, and the question of how to actually eat the chickpeas is sort of unclear (we were using mussel shells to tweezer out the mussels, so then we had to scoop up the chickpeas using mussel shells as well -- kind of awkward and unsatisfying, but using a full-sized fork to eat mussels also doesn't seem like a great solution). I've definitely had tastier mussel dishes, so won't bother repeating this one.

I love mussels and eat them fairly often. I think this is the best mussel dish I've had. The broth was fantastic. Added a little wine otherwise made as written.

What a treat! With the chickpeas, it made a meal. (Well, we had some good bread & white wine.) This goes into the recipe box for many future meals. I've been eating & cooking mussels for years, and this is the best version I've ever tasted.

really good..I used a little more cayenne pepper than called for which made it nice and spicy. Would think you could also add or substitute sausage or chicken for mussels.

Great flavor combinations and so easy to prepare. Adding the lemon wedges, as others suggest, definitely makes a big difference. Will try with some white wine next time.

Because of this recipe, we watch our seafood provider for mussel sales. Whenever they're a bargain, we make this, and love it. We tried adding a little fresh lemon juice, as the other reviewers have mentioned, and we think it does add a fresh note to the flavor. Great, simple and tasty. We serve it over plain cous cous.

I made it with bay scallops (no mussels at the market today) and it was delicious. Like the previous reviewer, I added lemon. Also, I threw in a bit of spinach at the end for nice color. Served it over cous cous-- lovely and fast.

Loved it! So easy to make! I added a cup of chopped arugula, a third of a cup of white wine, and a few lemon wedges during the simmering process. Then a minute or so before I added the mussels, I threw in a pound of small bay scallops, and the zest of one lemon. The broth from this is fantastic.
