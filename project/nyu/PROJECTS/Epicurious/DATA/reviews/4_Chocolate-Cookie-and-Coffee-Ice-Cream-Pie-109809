Yum Yum. This is SO delicious. I made it with oreos from my neighbor, mint. Mint is so good for the cookie. I would do mint or peanut butter cookie, and that is good. Plain choco is yuck.

This makes an awesome dessert that kids and adults devour. For a lighter version, use lite ice cream and low fat cookies.

I made this over the holidays, and am about to make it again. Despite being constructed from prepared items, not cooked or baked, it is an impressive dessert, and was very well received. Great to do ahead and freeze for future use.
