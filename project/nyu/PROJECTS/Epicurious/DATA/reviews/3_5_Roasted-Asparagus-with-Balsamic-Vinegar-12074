Easiest asparagus recipe ever! Awesome result to effort ratio. I would definitely crank this out as a last second side.

This has become my stand-by recipe for asparagus. It is simple to make, serves well, and is very good. I have made it numerous times and I am satisfied each time I serve this dish.

Delicious and ridiculously easy. I used thin asparagus and it was PERFECT. I find thick stalks stringy.

Super simple and simply delicious. This dish gets rave reviews each time I prepare it. I've found that roasting the asparagus for 10 minutes at 450 works best. A garnish of shaved parmesan is also nice.

Perfect, classic roast vegetable recipe. I admit that I realized I'd run out of balsamic when the asparagus was in the oven, so I skipped it, but it was still delicious with my rib roast and roast potatoes. Also only flipped the stalks once midway through. Delicious.

We made this tonight and it was fantastic. Truthfully, we made the asparagus without a recipe, but it was so good that I searched to see if there was something similar. And here I find the exact recipe! Wouldn't change a thing. We found perfectly fresh asparagus at the market, which made the resulting dish all the better. Easy, tasty, pretty. What more could you want?

I think this will be my standard way to fix asparagus from now on. I didn't measure anything, just sort of drizzled it all over. I used high-grade balsamic. Couldn't stop eating it.

Easy, pretty (used green and white asparagus), and delicious!

Incredibly simple yet elegant. That combination earns this 4 forks. I formed a tray from foil so I could roast over the grill. Used a bit more olive oil than in the recipe and was liberal with the balsamic vinegar.

Simple and delicious! Like a previous reviewer, I reduced the vinegar a bit, and really liked the results.

I was hopeful based on the other reviews, and my love of roasted asparagus and balsamic vinegar - but was disappointed. Grilled or roasted asparagus with olive oil and a little salt and pepper beats this recipe hands down.

This is a great side dish. I reduced the balsamic vinegar which gave a more intense flavor to the asparagus. Very tastey.

It was very good. Easy to make. Added more than 1 tablespoon of vinegar.

I don't really like steamed asparagus, but I loved this! I used some leftover garlic-infused olive oil and it was amazing.

Quite good and very easy for a quick meal. I've served this at a gourmet dinner with steak.

I like asparagus. But usually don't like it enough to make a lot of it. It's not usually a 'go back for seconds' kind of dish. However this dish I went back for seconds. I am a vinegar-a-holic and this was outstanding. It was also nice to only use one cookie sheet instead of my three piece steamer set-up. I disagree with the review that said not to use pencil thin. I used that and it was great. I look forward to using it with big apsparagus as well.

We loved this. My asparagus was quite thick, so I roasted them for 15 minutes. Perfect! :) I didn't bother with the "every 2 minutes" thing, but did flip them 1/2 way through. Update: Tried with pencil thin asparagus. Not a good idea! I prefer thick ones!

My husband and I really enjoy it. Very easy and we will make it again. I recommend to anyone.

Great flavor and sooo easy. The roasting time depends on the size of the asparagus.

Okay I have been converted. Yummy! Although I wasnt sure if the 10 minutes included the time out of the oven when tossing it.

This is good. My wife, Godzilla, says it's her new favorite vegetable.

I thought it was okay, but nothing great. I love my balsamic vinegar, so that wasn't the problem. Just didn't like it on asparagus. I also had to cook it a little longer that the recipe called for, probably since I had to keep opening the oven every 2 minutes. I still prefer my asparagus steamed or sauteed.

This was really good. I put garlic and shallots in there too, but I don't think I left them in long enough...they still had a bite to them. But the asparagus was great!

I have always made asparagus by steaming it but roasting the asparagus and adding the balsamic vinegar seemed to bring out the flavour even more. Simple and delicious. It was a perfect compliment to the salmon wrapped in phyllo that I served it with.

I was very pleased with this recipe. Not only was it absolutely delicious but very easy to make. I added just a little more garlic and it was wonderful. The balsamic vinegar is the icing on the cake

I made this recipe to try out before Thanksgiving and it was just perfect. I added portobello mushrooms with the asparagus about 20 min. into the cooking time and also chopped garlic and tossed them in. It was great and my guest of 8 loved this simple and very easy recipe.

I tried this because I had a truckload of asparagus (maybe I'm exaggerating) and could not steam it so I wanted to roast it. This is so simple and easy I felt guilty...everyone RAVED about it and asked for the recipe. Now I make this all of the time!

Great easy recipe and yummy too! However I would reccomend that when the weather turns warm try roasting them on the grill instead of the oven. Even better!!

Easy and delicious. Served with seafood casserole, italian boule with olive oil. 15 year-old daughter said,"Smells disgusting", but had three helpings. Roasted the asparagus with some brocolli, chopped garlic, shallots - 10 minutes in the oven and it was a fantastic side dish.

Very good. I used less olive oil and a light drizzle of vinegar. The asparagus I used had pretty thick stalks so I roasted for ten minutes; that of course will vary. For a previous reviewer who found the recipe "toxic", quality balsamic is key.

A standard in our house now. Kids and adults love it. I sprinkle crushed, roasted almond on top.

I really liked the light flavor of the balsamic vinegar. I peeled the asparagus beforehand, and added mushrooms to the roasting pan. It was a tasty addition. Also, I roasted them an additional 5-10 minutes until very caramelized. I like asparagus a little on the flimsy side.

Easy to make but I was looking for a more robust flavor and it didn't deliver for me. I'd make it again, but perhaps add more vinegar.

Roasting is the only way to go. I first tried it with the "roasted asparagus and tangerine dressing " recipe from this website and now I'm hooked. I think I liked this recipe even better. I too sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on during the last few minutes of roasting. Very tender and tasty. An excellent and elegant side dish.

A really great, quick way to cook asparagus - and I roasted them on a baking sheet lined with tin foil, so there was no clean up!

This meathod works beautifully with a variety of vegetables - try it with:Green beans/haricot verts, sugar snap peas, baby zuccini, summer squash and is FABULOUS with baby broccoli! My guests always say - "I've never had (BLANK) cooked this way - I make a convert out of every one of them! With our without the Balsamic depending on your main dish.

I always roast asparagus. In addition to sea salt and balsamic vinegar I sometimes add some shaved Parmesan toward the end of cooking time. This adds a nice touch.

I also sprinkled sea salt on the asparagus before cooking it. This was my first time to roast asparagus but it won't be my last. It was quite delicious!

My 7 year old son made this. Our family loved it, including the "not-as-asparagus-fan" . We kept them in the oven a minute or so longer for extra roasted.

I cut the cooking time down to 6 minutes & when I added the vinegar I also tossed with chopped garlic & parsley
