really good mashed potato recipe, don't really need all the butter, i would cut it in half for a healthier option

This was a hit. I used red potatoes and left the skin on. This was absolutely wonderful. Nice and fluffy. There is a slight odd taste that comes with it if you are a regular "normal" mashed potato maker but still a definite hit.

I was timid and used less mustard than suggested. So, while the mustard taste wasn't that strong, I thought the grainy mustard was an attractive addition to the potatoes. My buttermilk seemed to curdle a little when added to the warm butter, but I don't think it was a problem. For guests, I would only make this again if I also made "regular" mashed potatoes separately so folks could resort to the old stand-by if these didn't appeal to them. Maybe my family are a bunch of gluttons, but 4 lbs. of potatoes only yields about 5-6 servings (not 10) in my house.

Tried this recipe because I had russets & usually use thin skinned potatoes for mashing. Already a buttermilk mashed potato convert but never tried mustard. Wonderful tang along with the buttermilk. I am a dinosaur & like to hand mash, then mash in butter, then make a well to heat the buttermilk & then whip with wooden spoon. My mother-in-law made the very best with this method. No electric mixer can do the same in my opinion. All you need are a few strong arms & take turns! For a delicious alternative, try leftover roasted garlic cloves instead of mustard.

I can never find buttermilk in anything smaller than a quart, so it's a challenge to use it all before it goes bad. With this recipe, buttermilk will never languish in my fridge again! Definitely my favorite mashed potatoes.

Made these mashed potatoes to go with Pork Crown Roast with Cider Gravy for Easter Dinner. I've never quite had mashed potatoes quite like this. They were a hit. I would definitely make these again. The mustard adds just the right touch. There are no leftovers.

A great hit with Thanksgiving diners. They liked the slight kick of the mustard (I probably used a bit more than the recipe suggested) in what is usually an obligatory but bland dish. So easy and so good.
