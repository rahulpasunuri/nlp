I had made muhammara as a dip with pita chips and we all loved it, so my fork rating is for the dip/sauce. After I saw this recipe I tried it on grilled chicken breasts. We did like the flavor, but have other chicken recipes we like better, and still like muhammara best as a dip for pita chips. Pomegranate molasses is a must - lemon juice doesn't come close to the flavor

The sauce was WAY too thick to drizzle, but was still very tasty. Next time I make it, I will add it to the chicken during the last 10 minutes of cooking so it's not just some random paste on top of the cooked chicken. I also roasted some (canned) garbanzo beans under the chicken, and they were absolutely amazing with the chicken and the sauce.

This was _AMAZING_. As suggested by other users, I coated the nearly done chicken with lashings of the sauce and then let it spend the last 12 minutes in the oven with the sauce on and it was PERFECT. My boyfriend loved it, and I will certainly be making this one again (although next time, I will use boneless breasts). Four forks!

I found this one when looking for a recipe to use some pomegranate molasses in (most use it in small amounts as this one does). It's definitely a keeper. I substituted panko bread crumbs because they were handy and maybe they made the sauce a bit thick. It was too thick to drizzle even though the flavor was fine. The drumsticks took longer than 35 minutes to get golden as shown in the picture. Next time I'll put part of the sauce in the baking dish near the end of baking and roll the chicken in to coat and then bake a bit longer to glaze. As others suggested the sauce would be great on any cut of chicken and likely on pork as well. Can also see it use as you would any pesto.

The dish was just ok. Nothing special.

The sauce is delicious, but it definitely doesn't go with chicken. Lovely spread on pita, though. I will definitely make it again in that context, but not with meat of any sort. also - I used grenadine molasses and it was a tad too sweet. Added some lemon juice, which perked it up.

I have made this recipe several times for guests and everyone loves it. The sauce is really what makes it though. You could use it on any cut of chicken.

This recipe was okay...It makes a very large amount of strongly flavored sauce. We didn't go through very much of the sauce, and didn't bother to save the rest. I agree that the sauce would probably do better as a dip for pita than as a sauce for meat.

Very tasty sauce, but would never use drumsticks again. I doubled the recipe and used chicken breasts and served over basmati rice. Use only 1 1/2 times the oil if doubling.

i'd give 4 forks for the sauce i'm not much on the drumsticks. i've used the sauce with tosted pita bread for some family functions and everybody loved it.

Delicious sauce: used the leftover on pita bread. I made the recipe as written, thinking all kids like drumsticks. Wrong for my grandchildren. When I make this again I'll use boned chicken thighs, add a brushing of sauce the last five minutes or so, probably cook chicken a little longer so it is truly golden. The cumin rice was perfect.

Sauce is great, sort of a red pepper pesto.

This was delicious and has lasted in our fridge for three weeks, used on many conveyers such as, but not limited to: pasta (instead of pesto), toasted pita, bruschetti, carrots and other veggies. Drumsticks were okay, but the four forks go to this wonderful sauce.

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday and it was a hit. I added a bit more red pepper to the sauce; we thought it was delicious

Delicious and easy! I used fresh lemon juice from one lemon instead of the pomegranate molasses, although I'll have to seek that out in the future. I also used toasted almonds I had leftover from something else instead of the walnuts, and used about twice the amount called for in the recipes, and I cut out the bread crumbs entirely. The sauce consistency came out perfectly. What a wonderful blend of flavors!

This was delicious and easy. I'm giving the sauce to friends as a gift! I added extra garlic, cumin, and cayenne pepper to punch it up a bit. It's great on fish, chicken - anything, including toasted whole wheat pita as a snack or appetizer.

This is an additional note to my earlier review. The left over sauce is wonderful as a dip with pita, lavash or crackers! I will definitely make this again expanding the sauce to be sure there is some remaining to serve to guests (or just enjoy ourselves!

This is the best sauce for lot's of things! I added a fresh habanero to the blend and it's a great sandwich spread on a roll with grilled grouper or grilled chicken and fresh spinach and tomatoes. My husband and I love it!

This is wonderful as written! Because of my pantry supplies, I used pecans instead of walnuts and fig molasses instead of pomegranate. I wondered about such simple seasoning on the chicken while cooking, but it was moist and a perfect canvas for the sauce which is full and complex. The only change I would make is to take the skin off before seasoning and baking. And perhaps using boneless breast and thighs.

I haven't tried it yet but I am going to put the sauce on for the last 5 or 10 minutes that it bakes so that it will have a slight glaze, I will also leave some back so i can pour it over the chicken the last minute for more moistness and flavor.

You can find pomegranate molasses in most middle eastern grocery stores. It's a thick syrup-like concoction with a sweet and sour taste. I add it to braised meat dishes when I want that flavor (works wonders with brisket). A question about this recipe - do you cook the chicken at all with the sauce on it?

quite different and good

Not liking the assorted non-meat pieces parts of wings, I substituted with breast meat in strips, and all came out great with much less the mess. Can anyone tell me where to find pomegranate molasses?

fast...easy...richer flavor than chicken breast Spread heavy duty Aluminun Foil in the bottom of pan and clean up is a cinch

great and the total time on the cooking can be used to do the things that go with the dish
