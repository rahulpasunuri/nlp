We loved this dish, but I believe that my four fork rating resulted from the following mods of the recipe: Skinless, boneless thighs; 6 strips of bacon; More garlic; Baby bellos or other more flavorful shroom; Homemade stock; Homegrown herbs.

It was okay. I overcooked the chicken a little bit because I didn't read ahead and realize that it would simmer for so long. I took the lid off the pot to thicken the sauce off a bit.

This dish was so awesome that my husband went back for seconds. I read the reviews and added a sliced red pepper with the mushrooms. I didn't have white wine, so I added another cup of chicken stock and then reduced the liquid when the chicken was done. I forgot to add the herbs, but I made sure to salt and pepper the chicken well before I browned it. I think the secret is in the type of chicken stock you use. A light yellow stock will not give the depth of flavor that a rich brown stock will.

I thought this recipe was great! It sounded simple enough to try,so I did. I read the reviews and based on thier feedback decided to alter a few things. I added 1 more clove of garlic and a little less wine. I cooked with boneless chicken breasts which I cut into 1/3's each. I also added a touch of dill, as I had no basil..and it was yummy!!! I thought the sauce seemed a little runny, so I also added flour to thicken. It was really, really good. I paired it with whole wheat rice, as to soak up the excess sauce. I thought it was very flavourful! Then again everyone makes their own alternations to personal perfection!!

Nothing offensive about the recipe, but the dish wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped.

It's better using real Chicken stock and add some red and yellow pepper make this dish more color full

Isn't this a great site.. just love all the great recipes. This one was particularly good, my family enjoyed it - I used boneless chicken breasts and about 1/2 the wine.

I made this with a whole chicken, which is a pretty good idea since you can make your own broth out of the livers, neck, etc. and use that in the recipe. We liked it a lot, except we will put carrots and potatoes and other vegetables in it the next time since you end up with a ridiculous amount of liquid and hey, you can only sop up so much of it with French bread. I might make it again, although it's not so incredibly good that I'm sure it's worth the effort.

WE ENJOYED IT AND I USED A SWEET RED SCARLET WINE WITH CHICKEN CUTLETS INSTEAD OF WHOLE CHICKEN. THIS MADE THE DISH READY MUCH SOONER, AND IT WAS VERY GOOD.
