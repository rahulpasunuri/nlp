Love this! Inspired by a visit to the NMAI in Washington DC, I was looking to make something with wild rice, and found this. Wild rice has a special affinity for turkey that chicken just can't measure up to, so I wouldn't bother without turkey and turkey stock. I also omitted the butter & corn, and forgot to put in the cream at the end, so it can be more heart-healthy than written while losing nothing. Use good parsley for garnish; it's worth it. This is definitely going in my regular recipe rotation.

This soup is really quite boring. No matter what I did to try to perk it up, nothing really helped. It was a waste of my home made turkey broth.

I am very impressed! This is by far the best chowder recipe I have encountered! Also a very flexible one as the flavor comes out still amazing with substitutes. I used bacon, red cabbage, red onion, dried shiitake mushroom, chicken broth, and h&h as I didn't have pancetta, carrot, mushroom, turkey stock & whipping cream. Also a nice recipe to use up some leftover veggie. I did add some gravy and stuffing to the chowder. I did all the chopping before going to work so when I get home, just have to throw everything together. Made it last night and we are so looking forward to the leftover!!

Update to review below - the chowder definitely tastes better the next day! I was skpetical about whether the corn belonged in the recipe but I really like it. Chowder was very thick, but thinned out nicely with a little milk during reheating.

I just finished making- subbed bacon and fresh rosemary. Maybe my expectations were too high from all the great reviews! I thought it was good, not great. (but would make again since it's so nice to use up the leftovers) I used quite a bit of leftover stuffing, maybe 2 cups. I chopped it up and most of it seemed to melt into the broth. The bits that were recognizable were soft and yummy. But I think the stuffing made the chowder almost too thick. I wish I hadn't added the rice- I subbed trader joes basmati and wild rice pilaf... Prob bad move on my part. I think it's going to be really thick and gloppy after it sits overnight.

I had nearly everything for this on hand after Thanksgiving. The only changes I made were chicken stock for turkey stock, and brown rice for wild. I only used 8 cups of stock, and I'm glad that's all as it was still pretty liquid. The flavors in this chowder are terrific. Probably the best use of leftover turkey that I've come across so far. Next time, I think I will skip the rice, and use diced potatoes instead.

AMAZING!!!! Our daughter doesn't eat meat, so we subsituted Halloumi for the Pancetta. Just perfect! Can't wait til next year!

I make this every year! Our family loves it. I make 1 turkey a week ahead so when I take thanksgiving to my mother -in -laws I have this to put into her refrigerator with the leftovers.

Excellent recipe! The turkey stock recipe puts this over the top, also making a light roux with the flour. I didn't add cream, rice or corn because I didn't have but 6 cups of stock. Definitely the best turkey soup recipe out there. I did add some white wine to the mushrooms.

Agree with everything WhatAWriter said below -- rare for me! ;) -- except I wouldn't skim off the fat and throw it away. That's great rendered turkey fat! I skim it off chilled broth and sub it in for some of the butter in order to get more of that turkey flavor; plus, waste not want not. Also good with chopped parsnips. This soup is a wonderful use of that beautiful post-Thanksgiving turkey stock; my husband curses me every year when he has to choose between this, and the Turkey Potpie with Cheddar Biscuit Crust (also on this site). Luckily a big turkey gives you plenty of stock for both!

I've made this three times now. This time I used a 24-lb turkey to make the stock. (Be sure to use his recipe for stock; store-bought chicken stock is not going to yield the same flavors.) The difference this time was exceptional in terms of depth of flavors. Whether it was the turkey's size or the fact his stock recipe says to double all aromatics if you use a larger bird, the broth was far richer. My tips: Spices: add two cloves garlic, finely chopped, when you add the shallot. Add 1/4 level tsp. red pepper flakes when you add the rosemary. The red pepper does not add "heat" so much as depth. Wild rice: I double the amount called for, but I do not put the cooked rice into the broth. Instead, I spoon the rice into the soup bowl just before serving and put the broth/vegetables on it, stirring. This keeps the rice from getting soggy for leftovers. Corn: I double the corn. Next time, I'm going to double the carrots in the final soup, too. Aromatics: Next time, the turkey is not likely to be 24 lb., but I'm going to double the aromatics anyway. Gravy/dressing: By all means add these to the soup; they add even more flavor. This last time, I used some left over gravy. Timing: I made the stock one day, then strained it into a clean pot, covered it and put it in the frig. The fat rises to the top and makes an excellent seal. Before reheating the stock, I skimmed all fat/scum off. I think that's an easier way to remove all the fat/scum if you are not going to use the stock right away. In fact, I kept my stock in the frig. this time for three days before using. Also, you can freeze your leftover turkey meat and get it out when it's time to add that to the soup.

This was soooo yummy! I did make just a few changes. Can of corn instead of frozen corn, Fatfree chicken broth instead of turkey stock, ff half and half, green onions instead of shallots. I also thickened the soup with a thickening of the half and half and corn storch because I love thick chowders. Will definately make this again!

I make this soup every time I make a turkey and look forward to it more than the turkey dinner! I have substituted bacon for pancetta in the past but the pancetta is really the best to use. This time I omitted the cream but did use leftover stuffing and gravy as suggested and it turned out the best yet. My picky kids devoured it!

OH... MY....GOSH. I love making soups and this one was absolutely delicious! I don't know why I was so surprised but the flavors are fabulous. I did tweak for cost & convenience reasons: onions for shallots, bacon for pancetta, half-and-half rather than heavy whipping cream and an Uncle Ben's boxed wild rice mix (don't shoot me) in lieu of a traditional wild rice. I did cook day before and cool then reheat. Maybe that is a factor re: great flavor? Also my turkey stock seemed bland so I threw in some chicken bouillion. And I also added leftover stuffing (only about 1 cup at most). There must have been a stray haricot verts leftover because I found a lone one in the pot! I served with corn bread. Whole family had seconds & complimented the dish. Super yum! Would make again in a heartbeat!

This was wonderful on a cold wintry day, and even better the next day. We omitted the cream and added two chipotles in adobo sauce, minced, with about 3 Tbsp. of the adobo sauce for some smoky depth. I used onion and good bacon in place of the shallots and pancetta as did others because I had them on hand.

Outstanding! Especially on a cold, snowy day like we've had so many of here in New England this month. I used chopped onion in place of shallots, and top-quality bacon in place of pancetta. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. I also added leftover gravy and stuffing as recommended. Wow, is this good!

Wow That was the best EvaH!....I made a few subs , Spouse is not a big fan of mushrooms so I added 1 each red & yellow bell peppers, fresh rosemary & 1 onion. I would also double the wild rice.

Savory and rich flavors with a light(er) broth. Fresh rosmary would impart more flavor, otherwise a great recipe as is. Very nice with a Malbec and sourdough country bread.

Wow - I'm making this every year from now on. I made turkey stock out of the carcass, and I had made the Porcini Herb roasted turkey, so those flavors melded well. I added dried chanterelles to the crimini, and poured in the last of the wild mushroom gravy which had some cream in it. I left out the corn and didn't miss it. Serve with a dollop of sour cream - it really adds a nice tang.

Rating: 3
Great chowder! A lot of different things can be used instead of pancetta; bacon (or duck bacon) work beautifully. Don't skimp on the cream. I want to try this with sour cream for an even deeper flavor. Just about any prepared grain will work as well - and I love the stuffing idea! As for stock - anything works, but the lovely brown turkey stock from this site takes the cake.

This was very good, I followed the recipe as written. Next time if I have left over gravy and stuffing I will add that too. It would be a great recipe to have friends over to enjoy it with as it makes quite a bit.

Really great. Added the gravy and the stuffing and used my own homemade stock. Will definitely make again. Lots of flavor - even on the first day. Will make ahead next time for even more flavor!

This recipe was a great base for making an excellent soup. I forwent the mushrooms, used fresh rosemary, some thyme, sage, and a bay leaf. I added some sliced parsnips and subbed chicken stock. I made this for the family I work for, and it was very popular. Just use your palate and season really well. I also think you could throw just about anything in here with good results.

Yum! So good, and a great way to use up some leftover turkey. I halved the recipe as there were just two of us. I did add a little bit of leftover gravy with the cream at the end, and I used a basmati & wild rice with veggie blend from Trader Joe's instead of the wild rice. I think I'd make a turkey just to have leftovers for this soup!

The first time I made this, I followed the two recipes that came in the magazine, first making the stock out of the turkey carcass and then making the soup. As the author suggested, the soup was greatly improved with the addition of my own leftover gravy and stuffing. So, if you are going to make this and do not have those leftovers, plan to add additional seasonings like sage, black pepper and marjoram, or even a concentrated turkey stock base (or chicken) to jazz this up. That's why I gave this only three forks. The resulting soup was a four-forks recipe, but I had to add a bunch of my own stuff and seasonings. See the other reviews for more suggestions. The only fault I had with it was, don't you get weary of having to run to the store for things like pancetta when bacon would do? I don't make this soup often, but if I have the time, I make it happily. Wonderful flavors. And yes, I also use fat-free half and half for cream based soups. It works great. Another trick is to add a tablespoon of lite non-dairy creamer to add extra creaminess. These tricks may seem blasphemous but they eliminate all that cholesterol.

I pulled a quickie on this. Used pre-made rice and there was bacon in my stuffing, so I didn't do the pancetta. Just softened the veggies in 2T butter, added rice and turkey, then flour and finally the stock. Finished with a few tbs. of 1/2 and 1/2. Herbs - fresh sage and tarragon really crank it up.

This is the best "after Thanksgiving" soup ever. I made it exactly to the recipe, and it was fabulous. I agree, though, that using a lower-fat alternative to the heavy cream is a good idea (though I had leftover heavy cream, so it was a good way to use it!). Enjoy.

Wonderful twist on turkey soup. To reduce the fat I only added 1/2 cup of cream but otherwise followed the recipe. I simmered the turkey legs all day so the meat fell off the bone and I have plenty of stock after skimming fat.

I loved this soup. It's very filling and has a wonderful comforting taste. Since I didn't have pancetta I had to resort to bacon and it still worked well. I also used fat free half and half instead of whipping cream as my arteries can just take so much fat!

Made this with leftover turkey that was frozen from Thanksgiving. Both my husband and I thought it was amazing. I also froze some and reheated later and it tasted just as good as the first time. Note - I did use bacon instead of pancetta and added a little sage with the rosemary.

My husband and I started sharing the week night cooking, so he actually made this and it was excellent. He didn't have baby bella's, so he used regular button, he had a few slices of good bacon, so that was used instead of pancetta. Everything else was as written and it was divine!! This will be our leftover turkey soup every year.

I made a bunch of modifications to this recipe to use up what I had in the house and not buy more ingredients. After making the stock from my turkey carcass and a lot of skin (nothing else), I added about a pound of chopped boiled spicy cajun sausage and about 2 garlic cloves minced and boiled the stock for about an hour. This added a tremendous amount of flavor. I then sauteed the mushrooms in about a tablespoon of butter and added the corn to the mixture after about 10 minutes. That along with the chopped turkey, wild rice, and about 1/3 cup half and half then went into the stock. I boiled it for about 20 minutes more and voila. It was very tasty! I would definitely make it again.

This was actually better than my Thanksgiving dinner! (Probably says more about my dinner than than the soup, unfortunately) We loved this soup. Used up all my leftover gravy and turkey stock. Used fresh rosemary and a tiny bit of fresh sage and fresh parsley. Honestly, I don't think the cream added anything to this. I think I liked it better before adding the cream.

While I liked it, husband didn't - said it was bland. However, it might have been better if I'd added gravy or stuffing, which I didn't have on hand. Might try again, adding the extra fat and flavor from the gravy.

This soup is fantastic! I added a little garlic to the vegetables, used a combo of canned chix stock and homemade turkey stock, and did a mix of different mushrooms, otherwise I stayed pretty true to the recipe.

This is an excellent way to use up a lot of Thanksgiving leftovers. It's quite tasty - though that could vary with whatever stuffing and gravy you add. The only downside is that it didn't really thicken up. I even added more roux and it was still runny. Nevertheless, I'll be making this again. Maybe I'll have better results on my second try.

I made this soup the other night for my sick boyfriend and it is AWESOME! I didn't use the gravy or stuffing as it wasn't post holiday and I didn't have it on hand. And I made a few other substitutions - fat free half and half instead of the cream, Jennie O Roasted Turkey Breast (pre cooked from meat cooler), and I reduced the butter to 2 T of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter to lighten the fat content and it was excellent. The rosemary flavor mixed with the other unique combination of flavors was truly divine. I must add that it is crucial to follow the directions and remove each item as you go with a slotted spoon (instead of dumping into bowls), I think the combination of all the ingredients simmering in the same oil really makes the flavor and if you dump the oil in between each step you could miss out. You should def make this soup, it will become a regular winter staple in my home!

Wonderful soup just a little fatty. I used 2T butter this time, won't use any next time. I used dried rosemary ground in my mortar & pestle, all we noticed was the flavor & aroma. Will absolutely make this again!

This was good - though I would not say wow. Hubby liked it and baby boy seemed to think it was ok.

A great way to put leftovers to use. Stuffing and gravy was long gone by the time I made this thus it was omitted and I used regular bacon rather than pancetta since that's what was on hand. It made a really nice hearty chowder. I'll make it again the next time I have turkey dinner leftovers to use.

I made this with all the Thanksgiving leftovers. I didn't use as much broth so the soup thickened nicely with just the flour and I didn't have to use the cream so it was lighter. The stuffing added a great touch. This is my new post Thanksgiving meal to make!

This was a delicious way to use turkey leftovers! I cheated a little and used microwaveable wild rice in a pouch and happened to have a little container of already chopped pancetta (from the turkey recipe in the same issue) and used store-bought turkey stock. Okay, so I cheated a lot. But it was still delicious!

Made with chicken and fresh rosemary (2 tsp) also. Definitely a keeper.

Used homemade turkey stock, fresh rosemary, a wild-rice medley cooked according to package directions (and more of it), more corn, and only one package of the pancetta (couldn't bear to spend almost $10 on that part alone). It was a delicious combo and a great alternative to my usual "after Thanksgiving" turkey soup.

Being that it is pre- thanksgiving, I used Swanson low sodium chicken broth and rotisserie chicken. This soup was very flavorful and enjoyed by all even my kids. (One picked around the mushrooms.) The only change I recommend is to use fresh rosemary. The dried seemed to crunchy. A great fall meal!

I used chicken stock and raw ground turkey, that I formed into little meatballs and cooked in the soup at the end. Very good flavor, especially with the pancetta.
