I had leftover apricots, so I made these, following the recipe exactly, for a New Year's eve party. They looked and tasted very nice. I did find them a little too sweet, but my friends liked them. I thought they were quite easy to make, especially if you use ziplock bags for both the filling and the icing. Mine took a bit longer to cook than the recipe suggests, and didn't spread much, but that could be my oven. It's been temperamental. I'll try making these again.

One of my favorite holiday cookie recipes. Don't be intimidated by the instructions. Not as difficult as the recipe sounds.and well worth the effort.

This is one of the keepers I have made many times. I don't understand the reviews that suggest pre-slicing. One of the best things about this recipe is the ease of baking in a block, then slicing to make multiple cookies. The think to remember is, err on the side of thicker and thinner cookies. If you let them get too wide, they will break in the middle. They look MUCH prettier and more professional if they are smaller anyway, so that's no problem.. Too bad there's not a pic online. I have also made a cranberry variation to serve at the same time.

These were good, but I thought they were too sweet (maybe because I ran out of brown sugar and so used all white.) The icing certainly makes them look lovely, but didn't taste particularly good -- also very, very sweet! The apricot filling was tasty and easy to make, though, and I liked using the leftovers to spread on English muffins. Also, I didn't find the rope method over-complicated; in general, this was easy to make.

These were spectacular, even made in my hot apartment with a wooden spoon and no glaze. I made the apricot puree with fresh apricots--a cup sliced, with only 1/3 cup of water, and it came out wonderfully. So, if you have fresh fruit, have at it!

I made these cookies last week, and they were phenomenal. I did follow many of the others' suggestions. What really saves time is rolling out an 8 x 12 inch rectangle of the dough, and then cutting it into the desired 8 x 1.5 inch strips. I will be making these again for a party, as they turned out to be quite easy to make and really delicious.

sounded simple, cookie broke apart quickly, but thanks to the tips (zip lock bag), it was not a complete loss.

Thanks for all the suggestions of previous reviewers. I thought these cookies were really good, and actually easy to make with the tweeks. My only negative was I thought the apricot filling was a bit intense for the delicate cookie base. Perhaps it was the flavor of the apricots I used, but they seemed a bit strongly flavored. I made the cookie base into a block, 8 x 4, and cut this into 8 strips, then made ridge down the center and used ziplock back to pipe the filling. (As suggested by other reviewer, this was a great idea!) Would definitely make these again, might experiment with other flavors of filling, perhaps fig?

I wish I would have read the reviews before I started making these cookies but after all, it it the holiday season and who has time for these things. I realized after reading the reviews today that I added 3/4 cup of sugar to the apricots and another 1/2 cup to the cookies. Oh well, I had more important issues with these cookies. I cooked the first batch for 18 minutes, not checking like I should have, because I was so busy rolling out the second sheet. They were quite burned and not nice enough to serve to company. The second batch I cooked for about 14 minutes and they are perfect. I went out and bought an oven thermometer today because this is the second cookie recipe from Gourmet that I have had this problem with.

I would happily give 4 forks to the apricot filling, but the cookie was disappointing. I followed instructions, making the ropes with a very sticky dough (frustrating and time consuming). Some of the "logs" broke in the centre, where the trough held the filling, when I cut them. Although I spaced them on the cookie sheet as instructed, they still spread out and tried to meld into one big cookie. I think perhaps an old-fashioned thimble cookie with this filling would be terrific.

wonderful recipe - so pretty and the flavor is excellent.

Delicious and pretty to look at. An epecially nice addition to a cookie assortment. The cookie part itself is pretty ordinary, but the apricot mixture topped with the lemon glaze is lovely. I followed the advice to skip the rope technique and just chill rectangular blocks and then slice and roll them out and put a WIDE groove in by rolling a wooden handle in the middle of the rectangle. Also, piping the apricot mix (in a wide swath) from a plastic bag makes the apricot part easy.

Great cookies for the apricot lover. Question. Can you store the cookies in fridge for over a week and still taste great?

These are beautiful and delicious cookies. This recipe is a great example of why you read a recipe all the way thru before starting. I dumped all the sugar into the apricots to start... oops... do over. The use of plastic wrap for rolling the dough into ropes was too clumsy. I instead used a flour sack towel as my surface and my bare fingers for rolling. It was fast and easy with no sticking. For the apricot puree, it is easiest to pipe it with a ziploc, a pastry bag or an accent decorator. I love these cookies.

I slightly messed this one up in a couple of different ways, and they were still delicious. A bit hit with adults and kids, these were the first cookies to be eaten on a big christmas tray of two dozen different kinds. Things to note: 1) don't accidentally put in all the sugar in the apricot mixture; it makes it too sweet; 2) In one batch I tried the suggestion of mixing in the apricot batter into the dough; I think it makes it too sweet; 3) Forget all the fancy instructions for "ropes," you're just making bar cookies with a groove in them, and it's easy to figure out. 4) Try to pipe on the apricot filling if at all possible (or use a baby spoon) as a teaspoon makes it too easy to over-apply the filling. 5) watch these carefully in the oven! They're best when they're still mostly pale and still tender ("golden" is a bit too over-done) and 6) Just use a very small squirt of lemon juice in the icing, like 1/2 tsp. 7) 2 1/2 dozen cookies isn't really that many. I'd double the recipe next time. In any case, these are yummy. Make them!

Great cookies, but the method given is much more complicated and time consuming than need be. Instead of forming 8 individual ropes, etc., simply form the dough into a block 8" long and 4" wide, wrap in plastic or waxed paper, and chill until firm. Then cut the block lengthwise into 8 1/2" thick slices, use the handle of a wooden spoon or your finger to press a groove down the middle of each slice, and pipe the filing into the grooves. Same results in a fraction of the time.

Apricot cookies are part of Christmas. Just made these & they're now my favorite recipe. The dough is VERY sticky & difficult to work with -- hence all the plastic wrap -- but it's worth it. Next year I'm doubling the recipe.

Awesome Cookie!!! I have been making this recipe for a number of years now. It is now a command-performance, holiday standard cookie for my family. I like to make the frosting with Meyer Lemon juice - it just makes it perfect. As for the thumbprint method, I tried it one time myself and it actually was a LOT more work handling all those little bits of dough than it was just making the bars and cutting them after baking. And the look is not quite as eye-catching, so I strongly recommend making the recipe as written.

Having made these several times, I agree with a previous reviewer: add the apricot paste to the batter instead of on top. Makes for a marvelous and even easier cookie, subtle and buttery. They disappear rapidly at every function and are always specifically requested.

Sounded complicated to make but were actually not bad. The raves were worth it especially from some tough critics. They were gone in a flash.

I skipped the rope and trough deal. Instead I rolled the dough into little balls and made thumbprint wells in them to hold the filling. They turned out fine except I forgot to add the rest of the white sugar to the dough so they didn't taste as sweet as they should have. To compensate, I'll have to put the frosting on them. Still, very good.

Great cookie made as specified, though it is some extra work. Don't bake as long, so they're not so crumbly--15 min max. Make apricot trough wide, not deep. Use piping bag to drizzle icing over entire cookie.

I was a little skeptical of the preparation (ie dough ropes and trough), but thought the end product was very good. Will see what happens when I take them to a potluck this week!

If this dish is too time consuming for you, try adding the apricot paste in with the cookie batter and omitting the frosting. They cut well in a traditonal cookie cutter and the taste is more sublime. Like apricot Trefoils! Try it!

My first attempt to make cookies and they turned out perfectly.Great flavour and cosistency without being too sweet. Have given copies of the recipe to several friends that really liked the product.

My husband loved these, they were not crumbly at all but they flattened a lot in the oven. Substituted apricots for half dates, half apricot. Didn't bother with the frosting just sprinkled with confectioners sugar.

The cookies were very tasty. The combination of apricot and lemony glaze were great. I had some trouble with the preparation--it was difficult & time consuming making the ropes. There was a lot of crumbling when I cut the cookies. Maybe they needed to cool longer.

I made the first batch and thought they were good. Then my husband and his family ate all of them and asked me to make more. I also like the lemon / powdered sugar icing.
