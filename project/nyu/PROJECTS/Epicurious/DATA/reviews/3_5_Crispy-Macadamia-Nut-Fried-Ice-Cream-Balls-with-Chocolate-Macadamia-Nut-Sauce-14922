I used the same amount of topping with only 1 pint of ice cream and it was perfect. I can't imagine the topping mixture can cover and entire quart of ice cream.

The ice cream balls were delicious! But be aware that the preparation is very lengthy. Make sure not to skimp on the time you freeze the ice cream, otherwise the balls won't hold together very well! Overall a delicious treat though!
