Can't get any healthier with all the vegetables, easier if prep work is done in food processor and served with sour cream, very tasty!

Note to self...next time DO NOT substitute red cabbage for the savoy cabbage! [It turned the broth to an ugly blue/lavender color!] Also, make sure the beets aren't chioggia (candy cane striped). Otherwise, a nice hearty soup - I omitted the vinegar.

The intro mentions bacon but there is no bacon in the recipe. No matter, I followed the instructions exactly and the soup was delicious.

I would puree all the soup, use vegetable stock instead of beef/chicken and avoid adding any oil at all since I like it cold. I think te vinegar adds a nice touch of acidity, but if you overdo it add some sugar.

I thought this was gross, but my husband ate two bowls, so I gave it a 1. I think the vinegar is what really hit my gross button. I would definitely not use all three TBS. My Ukranian friend makes borscht that I love. She starts with water, not broth. Then its just beets, potatoes, carrots, cabbage, dill and onions and salt. Serve with sour cream. I think it makes a nice, simple soup that settles the stomach. BUT, my husband thinks her version too bland so I tried this recipe.

Forgot to mention that I later chopped the bacon and added it back to the mix!

As is, this recipe would be rather bland, but with some adjustments, it turned out to be delicious! I increased the amounts of everything that might add some extra flavor to this recipe... and added a few ingredients. I started by sauteeing 1/2 lb bacon until crispy, removing the bacon and sauteeing the veggies in the bacon fat instead of adding oil. I added an extra onion and two extra cloves garlic, an extra leek, loads and loads of fresh cracked pepper, 2-3T of crushed red pepper flakes, and probably doubled the amount of vinegar. Also, at the end, I added about 1/2 c fresh chopped parsley, juice of 1 lemon, and substituted yogurt, using about a full cup stirred right into the pot. It was fabulous. Served it with crusty bread and caviar!

My family loves to make Borscht every fall - this recipe was delicious. The dill was a nice touch. I would make this again, for sure. One variation, I did puree the soup.

I like this recipe, lots of veggies and very tasty. I'm not sure next time I would grate the beets. I made this in the slow-cooker and it worked too.

I left out the celery and used vegetable broth. It was delicious borscht--I am not a huge borscht fan and I really liked it. It wasn't the most beautiful borscht in the world (chunky with lots of indiscriminate pieces of "vegetable") but it was definitely tasty. Not amazing though (is it possible for borscht to be amazing?).
