Great side for an Oktoberfest party and tastes really good with Bratwurst. I made everything as written but when I first poured the vinegar mixture over the onions, I strained out the peppercorns and returned them to the onion concoction in a metal tea ball so they wouldn't accidentally get served along with the onions.

Major yum. I added a bit of allspice because I love it. Very easy, this will be a regular part of my diet.

I keep a batch of these in the fridge for use in sandwiches and salads. They are even tasty on their own.

Mmmmm! I used mine on sandwiches with sliced pork roast and it was a treat. One change I made was using a sugar substitute, which worked fine. I also wrapped the solids in cheesecloth, which made them easy to remove. but I will definitely be making this again. Might chop it up as a relish next time.

This is great!! By itself or adding to another salad (I tried adding it to Coleslaw and it really kicked that up several levels). Very easy and presents great.

I liked the flavors in this recipe very much. I experimented with the ingredients like adding slivers of radish or daikon. I also used it on kirby cucumbers. The only fault with the recipe was there was no instruction about straining the pickling liquid of the whole peppercorns. I ended up removing most of them but still crunching on one wasn't that pleasant
