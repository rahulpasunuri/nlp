This is very good and I've been making it since 1997. :) Over time I have tried many variations and now have a vegetarian daughter. Vegetable broth is just as good, as is substituting almond/coconut milk for the half and half. Alternatively, roasting a peeled russet potato w/ the veggies will also thicken soup slightly. All variations are equally tasty.

I just made it and was very delighted with the taste! I omitted the half and half because of the fat, and used Loblaws Blue Menu chicken broth and it turned out fantastic.

My boyfriend says this is the best soup he's ever tasted. I think the parsnip really makes it. I didn't change a thing.

Good basic recipe. I subbed pumpkin for the squash and omitted the dairy. I pureed the whole soup rather than pureeing the veggies alone. I added 1tsp of salt (used low-salt broth). Oh, and a red onion instead of yellow. Tasty and easy. The parsnips add nice spice/pepper flavor.

This was delicious! Followed other reviewers suggestions and used a bit of curry powder with the onions, and added a splash of white wine vinegar at the end. Also used vegetable broth and subbed coconut milk for the cream to make this totally vegan. Next time will try lite coconut milk to make it vegan and lo-cal! Don't see the point of the low-sodium broth as I ended up salting this a lot to stand up to the sweetness.

Loved this recipe. I always read all the reviews before attempting an epicurious recipe. However, I don't pay attention to the ones that have the word "definately" in them. If these people cook as well as they spell, I'm not interested in their opinion.

This soup was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner. The change I would make next time is change the squash:parsnip ratio. The parsnips are a bit overpowering so I would pair two squashes with 1/2 pound of parsnips. As advised by several reviewers I added a little madras curry, hot sauce and cider vinegar. I did not add half-and-half and I don't think it's at all needed.

How would one adapt this recipe to make it dairy-free?

Rich, delicious, easy to make. I used vegetable instead of chicken broth, added about a tablespoon of Madras curry (less sweet) and otherwise followed the recipe exactly as written. My guests loved it and I'm making it again next week.

This is a very delicious soup. Caution -Recommend using fresh tyhme. Not having fresh thyme on hand I used dried thyme. The thyme used was A'spices brand that they sell in small quantities in those little plastic bags. The end result was that I had these woody tasteless stems floating in the soup that detracted from the appearance and the taste.

I have no food processor (gasp!), so I just pulled out ye olde potato masher instead. The soup has a lovely taste, and is easy to make. I think I might use more parsnip next time.

The soup was very nice and mellow (I also put in about 1/4 cup cream and the rest low-fat milk), perfect for a chilly evening and a winner with the kids. I roasted garlic along with the veggies. Despite lengthy cooking, the parsnips just won't get soft so we ended up with little chunks in the soup, which wasn't a disaster but still a bit disappointing. Will have to work on that part of it next time and yes, there will be a next time!

Really good soup. Thick and creamy....perfect for cold weather. I did not add half and half. As the soup thickens I will probably use low fat milk to thin it. I did put a shallot in and pureed it with the vegs.

I first made this while I was in cooking school to serve in the schools restaurant...it sold out in 1 hour. Since then I have made it many times, and love it SO much. I always toast the seeds of the squash with some salt and pepper and serve as a garnish with creme fraiche. It is a wonderful soup...I also sometimes omit the half and half and add a small splash of apple cider vinegar towards the end...really perks up the flavors...

I made this for Thanksgiving last week, and then we ate the leftovers for dinner the following night (It made more than 6 servings). My dad loves curry, so I added some per another reviewer's suggestion. I also needed some roasted shallots and garlic for another recipe, so I roasted them with the squash and parsnips, and that may have added some flavor. I did have to add more broth than called for to make it soup consistancy. Anyhow, we loved it and I especially liked the unusual combination of flavors. I wouldn't have thought of combining them and they blended very well. As another reviewer commented, you could distinguish the flavors and yet they melded together. This is a very tasty soup, and something a little different from the usual.

I make this regularly in the cool autumn/winter months. I'ts always very thick and rich at the last step, so I haven't put in anything heavier than a bit of skim milk to thin. I've also tossed a few carrots in the oven with the squash and parsnips. I like the curry addition, and add when I remember. I love the parsnip flavor in this soup. (get organic--wonderful, sweet flavor)

This thick and delicious soup is wonderfully easy and *cheap* to make. I recommend making an extra big batch to freeze in serving-sized containers to take for lunches or for last-minute dinners.

Really excellent soup! Delicate & flavorful. You could discern the squash from the parsnips - yet the blend was perfect together. I substited vegetable stock for the chicken stock & added curry powder (as was suggested). Instead of cream I added low fat milk. The results were terrific. Easy to make & a must for any holiday meal or wintertime soup.

This is a really good and simple recipe, however, it definately does improve when you add a little curry powder with the onion. Also if you toast three tablespoons of almond flakes and puree this with the mix its great

This soup is absolutely marvelous! I made it for company and they all asked for the recipe. It has a wonderful, gingery flavor and aroma. Plus, it's easy to make ahead and then reheat for dinner.

I have never been a fan of parsnips, so I left them out and just used more squash. I also added hot sauce to the soup at the end with wonderful results. The soup had a delicious flavor with a hint of sweetness and little bit of a kick. A great soup for winter.

I thought this soup was wonderful. I didn't alter any of the ingredients, but I added the broth to the sauteed onions, dumped the roasted vegetables in, and blended it with an immersion blender. Great flavor -- Very easy.

This was a very nice soup for a cold evening. It was very easy to make - just throw the vegetables in the oven, cool them and puree. I thought that the original recipe needed jazzing up. As a previous commentator suggested, I added curry powder & then I also added some red pepper flakes. Parsnips are very sweet, so you have to like that taste. I would definitely make it again, but I think I would use more onion and again alter the spicing to make it a bit more flavorful.

Excellent! I served this for our gourmet club with great success. The best part is that it can be made a couple of days ahead of time and improve. It has an excellent flavor.

This soup was fantastic!! So simple to make - I wish I had doubled the recipe, we wanted seconds and thirds !! - I didn't use parsnips and it was still GOOD!

You definately must try this if you like parsnips. I have added a touch of curry powder to this recipe its wonderful.
