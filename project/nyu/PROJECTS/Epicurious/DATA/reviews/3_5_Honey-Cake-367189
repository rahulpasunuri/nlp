I made this cake for my Mom's birthday and New Year's Eve. Everyone liked it. However, the recipe does not say at which temperature to bake it at, so I baked it at 350 for 45 minutes. I had to get ready for New Year's Eve, so I left my Mom in charge of watching the cake. She said she tested it when the timer went off, and it came out clean, so she took it out. However, though the inside was moist, I found the outside to be too dry, almost a bit burnt. I think that if I make this cake again, I will put it in at 325 and see if that imporves things. Like other reviewers, I found the chocolate glaze to be a little weird for this cake, so I made a honey glaze with some honey and butter. Still, it was difficult for me to detect the flavour of honey in the cake. My Mom, on the other hand, said that she could taste it. The thing that I love about this cake is that it is dairy-free, as I am lactose intolerant. Also, it is lighter than the usual chocolate fare.

Wow! I'd never made a Honey Cake but my 4 year old was determined to make one. We were not dissappointed. After reading other recipes I made a couple of successful modifications. No sugar, increased honey to 1 1/4 c. Traded cloves for nutmeg and added cardamom. Used lemon zest. Also put a hone/butter glaze. 2 T butter, 1/4 c honey. Boil lightly and pour slowly over cake. "Mommy my tummy really likes it!"

This cake is lovely, but much too sweet. The equal parts sugar and honey simply overpowers the delicate taste of the honey. So to compensate, I cut the sugar in half, and still used the one cup of honey. The chocolate glaze also is much too strong for the delicate honey flavor. Instead, I made a honey glaze with 2 tablespoons of grated orange peel, 1/2 cup honey, and 1/4 teaspoon ginger. I reduced this in a saucepan, and drizzled it on the cooled cake. It was really nice. The cake is also surprisingly lighter, and springier in texture than I thought it would be. Very good.

I made this recipe for Rosh Hashanah and everybody requested the recipe. It was wonderful the same day and improved over time. I forgot to add the orange zest in the mix, so I sprinkled it on top of the finished glaze, which had quite a pretty effect. The glaze was not as pictured; it was exceedingly thick and did not drip over the side properly. Next time I will shorten the cooking time and if that does not work, I may use something else, such as agave syrup, in lieu of the corn syrup.

Made this cake for Rosh Hashanah. Came out very well. I increased the various spices by half a teaspoon and added cardamon and nutmeg (1 tsp each). I also added a finely chopped medium apple.

I have rarely met a cake I didn't like, but this one just wasn't good. Super dry - completely lost the flavor of honey. And the chocolate glaze was completely overpowering. Won't be making this one again.

I bought a bundt pan several years a go and my first few cakes were really dry on the outer edges and I had no desire to make cakes with crusty hard edges. But I thought I'd revive the pan and look a recipe where others commented on a moist cake. This recipe is a winner! I followed the recipe exactly. I am not a frosting fan and I ate the cake plain. It is moist and flavorful. My husband topped his with mango sorbet. Although it is called a honey cake, I will agree with others that it should be called a spice cake. The cake is sweet, but not overly sweet. But for me, the cake reminded me more of a pumpkin spice cake. I really couldn't taste the coffee or orange flavor. I used instant coffee dissolved in hot water. Next time I want more coffee flavor so I will increase the coffee strength, add more zest, and decrease the spice just a bit. Will definitely make this cake again.

Not only I enjoyed eating, I also enjoyed baking this recipe! Learning a new recipe in just a click helps me a lot! Moreover, www.everything-cake.com has many delightful recipes too.

We really enjoyed this cake (made it for New Year's in my family's tradition). This was a great recipe! The cake was very light and had a great texture. It also was browned and chewy on the outside and soft and light on the inside. I disagree with some of the other reviews, I thought this had a nice honey flavor supplemented with warm spice tones. I agree with others that the chocolate glaze seemed wrong so I used a honey glaze instead. Very tasty.

Loved the flavor and consistancy. However due to the consistancy of the batter I ended up adding 1 cup of flour and reducing the oil by 1/4 cup.

A really dull concoction, and the chocolate 'glaze' was an unnecessary distraction. Mine was not as moist as I would expect from a honey cake. Spraying the bundt pan with oil in advance was a good tip.

For many many years I've used my mother's method for honey cake loaves: lining the loaf pans with oiled butcher paper or brown grocery bags. This method is so much easier , and prettier! Thanks. I've made two this week!

I'd give it 3 1/2 forks! Easy and delicious. Lighter (less dense) than a traditional honey cake, but very moist. Adding chocolate just didn't seem right to me, so I sprinkled powdered sugar on the first one I baked. It lacked a little something, so on the next one I used an orange glaze (from the fudgey orange zucchini cake recipe) and it was great.

I made this 2 days early, wrapped in foil and let sit on the counter with every intention of making the chocolate glaze. At the last minute, ran out of time and used caramel sauce instead. It was a massive hit. Would recommend putting the caramel sauce on last minute. Loved the "Crumb" of the cake, would be ok to cut back on some oil and a bit on the coffee.. Will definitely make again.

The key to this cake is letting the chocolate glaze set before serving it and especially if you add the salt! I just served it to a neighbor who loved it. However, when the glaze was gooey and freshly applied, the salt melted and ruined the taste!

I am sorry to say that I made this cake and brought it to a Rosh Hashanah dinner and my hostess (and host) didn't like it! The chocolate glaze is deceptive on this cake which is essentially a spice cake. I think that they thought it was a different sort of cake and were surprised and misled by the chocolate. I would make it again, but put just a sugar glaze on it next time.

I've always hated the heavy, dense honey cakes I was exposed to in my youth. This recipe was a revelation. It's exceptionally light with nice spicy undertones enhanced by the orange zest. I found the glaze to be a nice addition, but it cooled to a matte finish, which was not what I expected.

Everyone at synagoge raved about this delicious cake! I loved the additions of dark chocolate and orange zest. Will make again next year!

A WINNER! Moist, and wonderfully complex flavors. I did make the chocolate glaze and everyone loved it - we poured it over the top of the cake AND drizzled a spoonful over the top of each piece before we served them. I had bought whipping cream but forgot about it - homemade whipped cream would have been the coup de gras if I had any room left at all in my belly next to the brisket. I did make one tiny substitution. I added a 1/4 cup of Irish Whiskey (for the Irish husband) and took away 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. This is going to be our holiday tradition! I'm making it again for our family Rosh Hashanah celebration this weekend!

I agree with a previous reviewer that the chocolate icing (glaze) did not fit this delicious honey cake. Next time I will skip the frosting, or perhaps make an orange flavored one.

I HATE baking...but this is a recipe for people who hate to bake. Super easy,I literally made it as an afterthought while the rest of my Rosh Hoshana dinner was cooking. I took the advice of other reviewers and skipped the chocolate glaze, instead I made an amaretto icing (1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup milk, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 TBS amaretto). OUTSTANDING! We almost finished the entire cake before dinner! This is going into my holiday dinner file for sure.

My kind of cake: easy and flavorful, not too sweet. The only (minor) issue is the glaze was a bit too thick, so next time (tomorrow) I'll add a bit more coconut milk and maybe warm it up a bit less. The salt is a winner.

Just made this cake yesterday, and it was moist and sweat. I didn't use the coconut milk for the chocolate glaze, but I think I would skip that altogether next time - take a look at how it came out: http://wonderlandwithlove.blogspot.com/

this is a lovely cake that I made in a couple of hours before the holiday. I appreciated the fact that I didn't need to get out a mixer to make this--it was easy enough to whisk ingredients. And using the spray on my cake pan helped so much--it came out of the pan clean. I'm thinking that the addition of a little rum or brandy brushed on the outside of cake might be fun--I may try that today. Especially enjoyed the addition of orange zest to the cake, and it remained very moist and not as heavy/dense as some honey cakes tend to be.

Really great honey cake...will tweak it next time...will add a drop more sugar, a drop less orange zest & bake 5 min. less.

The cake was delicious but the glaze did not go with it at all. I would make it again but with powdered sugar or no topping at all.

The cake is good. Its moist and flavorful. The chocolate glaze is very rich and the salt is a wonderful touch. I just wish it tasted a little more like honey and a little less like spice. Obviously, as you are making it, you know this is where it is headed... But I still found myself wondering how it was honeycake instead of spice cake. And although it was good, it was not something my family couldn't get enough of... But the texture was so nice that I am tempted to try to tweak it a bit before giving up on it entirely.

Very good. I made it without the glaze as it is classic at home. The only problem is that spraying oil was not enough and it got stuck to the bundt pan and broke. I still put it together and served it. My grandma, whom I should've copied, butters the pan and then covers with sugar. Much better.

I guess we liked it. Half of the cake is gone, and it's only been out of the oven an hour! It is very light. I think the chocolate glaze almost disguises the honey flavor of the cake. I wonder if a powdered sugar glaze as for a spice cake would not be better.

I'm sorry but I didn't like this cake at all. It did have a honey taste but wasn't at all what I was expecting. Kids didn't care for it either.
