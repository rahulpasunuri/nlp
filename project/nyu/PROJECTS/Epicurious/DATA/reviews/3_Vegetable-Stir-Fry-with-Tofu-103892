Once again, having the reviews was crucial to making this a great meal. I added some chili oil to the olive oil (probably about 1 tsp total, cutting back on the other). Right before I added the liquid at the end I added (per an earlier suggestion) about 2 T peanut butter. And finally, I didn't have white wine so instead I did a mixture of rice wine vinegar, champagne vinegar and water (mostly the latter) with the soy sauce and sesame oil. Oh, also cut back on soy a little based on other reviews. Served it with peanut soba noodles - amazing.

Good ingredients, but overall disappointing. Needed a little pizzazz. Have made other stirfries from this website with much better sauce. This was too bland. Wouldn't make again.

MMMmmm! When I had this for dinner, I thought, "Eh. Not bad at all." But when I had it for lunch the next day?! "MMM! YUM! Oh my!!" It was sooo good the next day, I plan to make this again and again. It's easy, and actually pretty good for health. I recommend this recipe.

I added paprika and cumin to make it less bland. I also added carrot. I will probably make this version again.

I like tofu about once a year, and made this recipe for the second time. I love its simplicity and didn't change a thing.

This was a good, reliable stir-fry recipe. I added a bit of melted peanut butter and hot sauce to the sauce to give it some more flavor (and I've since used that sauce recipe for other stir fries, which works well). I also soaked some bean thread noodles and tossed them in (and used cremini mushrooms, which cost half as much as shiitake). I wouldn't call this a really unusual or overwhelming recipe, but it will probably become a staple dish for me.

I served this to three Chinese and one Korean. The Korean loved it, the Chinese people ate it but weren't hugely complimentary. I liked it and think it's a good "fusion" recipe for Westerners who like low-fat/veg/tofu dishes. I modified the recipe by adding a little bit of sugar and chili oil at the end, and also a little bit of cornstarch in cold water to make the sauce thick so that it coated the veg's better. I agree with another's observation that the recipe calls for too much soy sauce. Even 1/4c tamari was too strong. Also, I used peanut oil for frying, as it adds a slight nutty dimension. No salt or pepper (salt is in the soy sauce).

A delicious and healthy dish! The ginger, sesame oil and sake added interesting subtle flavors. Used tamari sauce instead of soy sauce for a smoother, lighter taste. Added lemon/ginger/tamari/sugar-marinated chicken and julienned carrots to the mix. Served it with Japanese rice. Guests loved it!

Thanks for the advice everyone! After reading the reviews I marinated the tofu and used less expensive mushrooms. I also added some chili paste to give it some kick. This turned out yummy!

This dish is wonderful...I took the advice of one writer and marinated the tofu with soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar and ginger and I think the additional flavors really boosted the dish overall. I made it for the first time and my meat and potatoe In Laws dropped by- they actually loved it and were not just being polite! They said 4 forks for sure! This is no small complement!

Thinking it sounded a bit bland, I added about 4 T. peanut sauce and 1/2 cup peanuts. I used regular mushrooms, not shitake. We thought it was quite good, very healthful, and liked the addition of peanut stuff.

I prepared this as main course for my vegetarian sister and a side dish for the others at my Christmas dinner. It was very good, I dried the tofu a bit then marinated it with soy sauce, ginger, sugar, and sesame oil. I also used 1/2 the sesame oil that the recipe called for, added carrots, but left out the shitake mushrooms.

We made this recipe exactly, down to the very expensive Shitake mushrooms which you could not taste. This was heathful but dull.

Other than the time it took to prepare the vegetables, this recipe was quick and easy. I used peanut and ginger flavored tofu, so it added a lot of flavor. The 'sauce' is very light and refreshing. I substituted whatever vegetables I had available and served over Chinese noodles. Perfect!

First attempt with tofu...will be my last...just no flavor and with the amount of fat it in, I will use chicken next time.....great flavor in the sauce though and the veggies were delicious! I used some leftover fresh spinach and it was great in this dish...next time I will serve over rice...good basic recipe

Liked this overall, would cut down some of the soy sauce and oil next time.

This was my first experience cooking with tofu, and I was very pleased. Next time I make it, though, I'm going to drastically reduce the soy sauce. It totally overpowered the vegetable flavors.

Very good. I served this with fried rice and it was wonderful.

Excellent...I have made this recipe twice. Once without tofu and just vegetables and once I added grilled marinated chicken. Both times I used different vegetable combinations. Fresh ginger root is key!!
