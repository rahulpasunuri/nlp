Delicious contrast between cold pudding and hot cherries. Folding the whipped cream into the pudding in a baking pan is messy; next time, I'll put the pudding in a bowl. Also, 1/2 cup of sugar is plenty for the cherries.

This is amazing, made it for one of my Christmas desserts! Made it with sweet brown rice which takes a long time to cook but it was worth it. Will make this again for sure.

I made this rice pudding for my Danish boyfriend who was visiting Canada for Christmas. It was so delicious and everyone loved it. My boyfriend said it was just like the rice pudding that his mom and aunt make every year. But he did suggest reducing the amount of sugar because it was a little too sweet. If possible use a whole vanilla bean. I couldn't find frozen cherries at this time of year, so I went to a European deli and found some German cherry preserves that I warmed up to serve with the pudding. This recipe is a definate keeper.

I'd had a rice pudding for Christmas Eve dinner at the home of a Danish friend and wanted to make it for guests. This recipe is virtually the same as the one my friend used. People LOVED it. I did not use a vanilla bean; when I took the milk/rice off the stove I stirred in 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract. And I cut the sugar way down. I made cherry sauce from canned pitted cherries, sugar, cornstarch and a little almond extract. Note: cooking milk like this can scorch very easily so keep the heat moderated and stir very frequently.

I just made the cherry sauce from this recipe and put it with the ris a l'amande recipe from denmark.dk because i felt this one had far too much sugar in it - this dessert, as we had it in Copenhagen several times last Christmas, should be rich and vanilla-ey but not overly sweet. The sauce should be sweet but mostly fruity and again I felt there was far too much sugar for the sauce, so I followed the advice given by one of the reviewers here and cut it back to about an 1/8 of a cup of sugar for 1 quantity. It went down fantastically and 1 quantity of the sauce was just enough for 5 enthusiastic diners, so don't be tempted to make a half-batch of sauce because half a kilo seems an awful lot of cherries! That said, it's a brilliant sauce - the lemons are perfect - it doesn't taste lemony, but they just give it a little lift. If you have leftover sauce but all the pudding's gone it would go pretty well over vanilla ice cream too. One of our guests (who doesn't like creamy stuff like rice pudding and custard) put it on her brownie and proclaimed the results excellent :-)

I followed the recipe without any alterations or substitutions. The texture and presentation came out very nice which made it very disappointing that the flavors just didn't seem to go together very well. I really wanted to like it but neither myself nor my spouse cared for it.

This is the best and creamiest rice pudding I've ever made or had. I substituted whole milk w/2% balanced w/cream and consistency appeared to be fine. Definitely use rissoto as opposed to long grain rice to achieve the creamy texture. The delicious flavor combination is a result of the toasted almonds with the cherry and lemon topping so don't substitute or omit any of those ingredients. For a healthier recipe, both the amount of sugar and whipping cream could be reduced but not omitted. Really easy dessert for larger dinner party and can be beautifully presented. YUM!

This recipe is close to the Danish desert we've had a Christmas each year. It's better if you reduce the amount of suger in the milk and rice mixture by half. We add one whole almond and chop the other almonds very large. Then there is a prize for the person who finds the whole almond.

This recipie is a traditional Danish recipie served on Christmas Eve in Denmark which I have enjoyed for many years with my husbands family there. The fun part is that one whole almond (peeled) is put into the pudding at the end before serving and each person scoops their own pudding. Whoever gets the whole almond gets a box of chocolates. Whoever "finds" the almond in their mouth may want to conceal being the "almond finder" because then there is extra laughter when people are going through their second serving just to find the almond "prize" and are trying to guess who has possibly already found it along the way.

I was very surprised to find that I didn't like this dish, but it really was fairly mediocre. I felt that the ingredients were chosen simply as an odd amalgam of rich ones, not as a complete recipe.

This is a great recipe. The rice pudding is rich and v. creamy. Decadent for sure. My boyfriend said it was the best rice pudding he had ever had. Given that he is gluten intolerant and eats a lot of rice that is high praise. I used Carolina box rice (medium grain). I doubled the recipe and it made about 12 cups. I cut out a LOT of sugar and could have cut more. It is not that I am adverse to sugar. I was justly afraid of it being too cloying with all that sugar. I used 14 tablespoons only and no sugar in the whipped cream and it was plenty sugary. The lemon with cherries is positively devine. Some sugar is needed but even when I doubled the cherry sauce, I only added 1/4 cup sugar. It is plenty. A visually lovely dish (even when my boyfriend mushed it all together as he does with all his food). Definitely serve in pretty glass dishes or goblets iwth perhaps a sprig of mint if you really want to be fancy.

Every family in Denmark serves this on Christmas Eve: almonds are chopped (not slivered) and one whole almond is hidden in it. The person who produces the whole almond (don't bite it!) wins the "almond prize" - usually a chocolate covered marzipan log. Re. the sauce: Some families cook it with a cinnamon stick and lemon peel, add brandy or a little red wine, and sometimes use tart cherries instead of sweet. The pudding should not be overly sweet, as the sauce adds the sweet punch to it. In response to some comments: DO NOT USE LONG GRAINED RICE. If you want that style rice pudding, use another recipe. It should have the creamy texture of risotto when cooked, before folding in the whipped cream. Second, DO NOT ADD GELATIN! This should be light and creamy, not firm.

This is a great comfort food. Almonds transform the texture of traditional rice pudding and are an essential from now on. The cherry compote was good, but the rice pudding recipe is the keeper. Simple, works like a charm, no problems at all. Everyone who had it loved it.

I made this recipe because I was in the mood for rice pudding. I decided not to do the part of the recipe where you fold in the whip cream. Nonetheless, it was absolutely delicious, and super easy to make.

I made this in honor of our cruise stopping in the port where this restaurant is located. We are looking forward to seeing this floating restaurant/ship in person. The rice pudding was a big hit! The cherry sauce was a nice accent to this pudding. Will try making this with the sugar substitute Splenda next time.

This was splendid and an easy dish to prepare ahead for my dinner for 50 people. I had a lot left, though, but it was worth eating as leftovers! Impressive and delicious.

Grandma, forgive me, but this recipe has replaced the one you made for us every Christmas. This is a fabulous recipe and perfect for the Holidays!

This is one of my favourite dessert dish, and made it on numerous occassion. I used american long-grain rice instead of short/medium, as long-grain rice doesn't get too 'mushy'. So end result still look like 'rice' pudding instead of porridge. I used black cherries mixture for cake fillings, diluted it with water and add sugar and/or lemon if required. Absolutely fabulous!!!

A wonderful and lovely recipe--made it with Japanese sushi rice and bruleed the pudding before serving. Used canned sour cherries with some syrup, brandy, some sugar and cornstarch to make the sauce. Pudding keeps well in the fridge so make lots!

This recipe was very rich and yummy - due to it's richness, serve in smaller portions. I couldn't find frozen cherries. Therefore, had to use canned. The result was a slightly too sweet cherry sauce. It would have been better without the extra sweetness. All in all, very nice.

While it tasted very very very good, my rice pudding came out soupy. Was this suppose to happen? Did I need to cook the rice longer? I followed the recipe to the letter and still had this issue. Advice is appreciated. All and all it was delicious just need to work on the texture.

Absolutely heaven, the pudding is rich and creamer, with crunchy almond flake through it. The rice pudding itself is hmmm..... *drooling* and the cherry sauce over it just make it soo...... good. Definitely recommended!

I've made this a few times and everyone I've served it to loves it. Elegant in individual footed dessert dishes. Do use a larger pot to prepare the rice. If you don't have a lid for the recommended pan, fold the cooled rice into the whipped cream and use that bowl instead; just as easy. As others have indicated, it's delicious the next day. Even for breakfast when it's just sitting there in the refrigerator irresistibly tempting you...

So good and easy. I used 1% milk with some half and half added. I also added almond extract to the cherry sauce. And sooo good the next day, even without the sauce. Very creamy.

This incredibly delicious desert has been one of our annual Christmas traditions ever since we visited family friends in Denmark 20 years ago. The only difference to this recipe is that I add a packet of unflavored gelatin to the pudding when it comes off the stove (chill overnight) and I use fresh dark cherries cooked with liberal amounts of Chambord and Cherry Kijafa - adds a nice depth. We put one whole, unchopped almond in the bowl and whoever finds it wins a prize! The winner brings next year's gift.

To the reviewer who had diffculty mixing in the whipped cream you didn't specify if you cooled the pudding in the fridge. Do not place the pudding in the fridge but let cool at room temperature.This will make it easier to combine the two. I would not suggest placing the cold whipped cream into the hot or warm pudding as it will deflate and defeat it's purpose. I have had tremendous success with this pudding and would highly recommend it.

I made this recipe for a first-time dinner party of four during the late winter. The only problem I had was, I did not have any vanilla beans. Using vanilla extract, I had to continually adjust the flavor. It was worth it! I doubled the recipe and still there was none left! A really good comfort dessert! A keeper

The cherry sauce is to die for! The pudding is great, and is even better the 2nd day. Tip: the recipe says to cool the rice mixture completely before folding in the cream, but I found that the rice hardened as it cooled and the "folding" was a little tricky. Next time, I won't wait until it is completely cool. Also: the recipe says to use a medium saucepan, but I would use a large one. Towards the end of the 35 minute cooking time, as I was stirring constantly, the rice splattered a little bit in the medium pot, and hot rice/milk really burns the arm! A larger pot should solve the problem.
