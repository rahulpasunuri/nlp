Very disappointing. Basically steamed clams with pasta--the sauce never came together as a sauce--maybe saute shallots, garlic and herbs and reduce wine before adding clams. Might be better using clam juice rather than wine. Would not make again

I made the recipe as described and was unimpressed. Maybe some of the additions listed by other reviewers would be helpful.

This was very tasty and quick to make. We added a little clam juice. Definetely something to make again- quick enough for a weeknight meal.

Easy to make, but I found it a little bland. Next time I will add a lot more garlic. I also didn't feel that 1/3 cup wine was enough liquid to steam open the clams, so I used more.

I subtituted fresh linguine for orecchiette. It came out great despite the little effort involved in preparation. I did however succumb to the urge to add salt to the sauce (even though it wasn't called for) and ended up with an oversalted dish. :(
