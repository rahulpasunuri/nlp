I prepared this recipe, but had to make some substitutions. For the Jalapenos, I used 3 fresh peppers, and I didn't have any red wine vinegar, so I used balsamic vinegar. Oh, and I used 5 cloves of fresh garlic. I love this sauce. I had it on burgers and also on a ham and swiss sandwich. It spices up anything.

Wow! Great as a condiment on burgers, dogs, chicken, sandwiches etc....Just blend and process; easy, garlicky..
