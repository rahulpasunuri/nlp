I felt that this recipe was pretty bland, the vegetables were overcooked and a little mushy. There are many great chicken recipes on this site, but this one won't be in my recipe box.

Very tasty and easy to make. I did not have wine or stock on hand. I used thighs with bones and added a bit of wine vinegar and reserved juice from the tomato cans. Not sure if that helped replace the lost liquid.

Delicious, easy chicken dish. Olive oil works great in place of butter. You can serve with a wedge of lemon. Bon appetit!

This is exactly the kind of dish you want for fast fuss free cooking. I also added lemon zest and garlic to mine I think it did pick up the flavor. I also added more spices. I served it with crispy potatoes for a nice easy meal.

Really easy and delicious- I added lemon and garlic, but it doesn't need it!

Okay, not very exciting. A quick easy meal for a weeknight, but not very special. I added a splash of balsamic vinegar to pep it up a little.

Delicious and easy to make. I added a splash of white wine and a hint of tabasco and it was lip-smacking.

One of the best and easiest I've made. I did add garlic but would be just as good without it.

Great tasting and extremely easy to make. I made it early in the day and warmed it up in the microwave and served it to company. Everyone loved it. I would, however, use a little less red pepper next time. I also added a splash of dry white wine. Will definitely cook it again soon. Thanks once again!
