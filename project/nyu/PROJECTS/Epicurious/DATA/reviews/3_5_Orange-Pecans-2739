So easy & tasty. I've made it a couple years running now, and get requests for it. Next time I'll try it with the cloves or ginger (yum!). A nice little holiday stand-by.

I followed the advice of several people who rated this recipe, and found that toasting the pecans first and adding 1/2 t. ground cloves really does improve them. Also, on the day they are made, the orange flavor does overpower the pecans. The next day they had mellowed and the pecan taste came through just fine. I'd suggest making these at least a day before you want to serve them.

I tried this twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and I found the pecan taste to be drowned out by the sugar and orange. The second time I toasted the pecans first, and they were MUCH better. The pecan taste was much more pronounced.

I added a little too much juice so I had to bake them a few minutes to get them to dry out and harden (I was worried they'd stay gooey if I didn't). But they tasted really great, really addictive. I also added about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, which gave them a kick.

Unique flavor, but good quality pecans on their own are better.

Received great reviews from the guests. It was easy to make. Served with Spiced Holiday Nuts, Orange Marinated Olives, variety of cheeses, and smoked fish. What a nice variety of appetizers.

These were much better after I added 1/2 tsp. of ground cloves and baked them at 325 for about 15 minutes. THen, they were great!

Delicious! Just found the recipe, but have made it for several holiday events. Very easy to make. Don't scrimp on the orange peel!

Super! Made them once for personal consumption, a second time for a party (did'nt last long) and yet again for a Chrisrmas gathering.
