Gave this 4 forks, but that was for my own spin on this dish. Used 3X the lime juice for marinade, rolled it up raw with cilantro, fresh mint leaves, and rice vermicelli, and served cold as a Ceviche Spring Roll. As for the sauce, add a little fish sauce and pepper flakes, and you've essentially made Nuoc Cham sauce. Served cold, it makes a beautiful presentation (if you can get the rice paper rolls to cooperate)and makes a great appetizer or snack food for a party.

Used wonton rolls and stuffed raw salmon (spritzed with lemon) red pepper, scallion and cellophane noodles inside. Next time will probably get creative and try avocado inside. Added wasabi to the dipping sauce. Will definitely make again.

Great taste. As an alternative - I've used 'spring roll PASTRY' or lumpia rather than the dried rice paper or other wrappers (won ton, egg roll or regular spring roll wrapper). They are in the frozen section of Asian markets and come out very thin and crisp. Well stocked markets may carry some of these - but be careful, the ones usually found in the refrigerated section are not the ones you want!

I had a horrible time with the rolls falling when frying. I liked the recipe but next time will try a wonton wrapper instead of rice paper.

Delicious and very easy. I made this for 80 guests and everyone was impressed. I didn't marinate the salmon and it was still wonderful. I also added some fish sauce to the dipping sauce to give it that extra something. Perfect recipe for a party.

I added vermicelli bean thread to the rolls. I have to admit I had never tried frying anything before and definitely should have practiced before serving them at a party. The first round fell apart but the rest came out tasting good if not beautiful.

Really good! I served these with the Super Slaw (made with a mixture of peppers only, no cabbage) and purchased Asian noodle salad for a full meal.

This is such a delicious dish, and it has such fresh, bold flavors. We've had it several times, and it's always a hit. I don't even bother doing the marinade; I just season the fish with salt and pepper and wrap it up with the herbs in the rice paper. The dipping sauce can be made well in advance, and the parcels can also be wrapped ahead of time so that there's only the sauteing to do at serving time.
