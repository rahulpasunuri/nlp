I actually didn't even get the sauce on the chicken as the recipe calls because once the sauce was prepared and I tasted it I couldn't even imagine ruining my chicken like tha. I couldn't taste any spice or sweetness, just very tart, sour, and vinegary. I ended up adding cayenne, honey, brown sugar, and apricot preserves. It cut the tartness but I still wouldn't recommend the recipe even with the additions.

Meat is something I don't eat every day and not even every week, but when I read this BBQ sauce recipe, I hurried to buy chicken for it - three times (the last 3rd of the sauce stayed in the freezer only one week). I put the chicken on the top rack of a preheated 400-425 degree oven (leave preheat on to keep both elements hot while roasting) on a rack over a foil lined baking sheet for about twenty minutes to quick melt the fat into the meat and quick crisp the skin before twice dipping the pieces in the sauce warming on the stove and then returning them to the oven. When the chicken is almost done, turn off the oven and let it sit in there carmelizing the sauce even further and soaking into the meat until you are excessively salivating. What an exceptional, tangy, thick, gooey, toothsome, smoky, spicy, beautifully colored BBQ sauce with the added bonus of using those dried tart cherries languishing in the pantry after the holidays.

Very good but not as stellar as I hoped. Next time I will use two more ancho chilie for more heat--not hot enough (or at all) for my taste with just two. Instead of brown sugar I increased molasses to 4 Tble and used 4 Tble aguave nectar (I'm trying to cut down/avoid refined sugar). Like other reviewers I brined chicken in salt water for 30 min first, used fresh cherries and drumsticks. I also added an extra clove of garlic and cooked on a stove top grill. Turned out very good though my cooking time was closer to 30 minutes and I had to have every fan in the house going to avoid smoke alarm!

This was a fantastic hit for everyone, young and old! It had a little bit of a kick, but not too much at all. I didn't have coriander and clove, so I used cinnamon instead, and it worked beautifully. We couldn't get enough of this sauce!

This was a lovely recipe. I used chicken drumsticks and they turned out very flavorful. I did sub 1 tbsp ancho chili powder for the actual chilies. I also could not find dried sour cherries, so I subbed dried cranberries. This is definitely a keeper recipe!

This was an outstanding sauce recipe. I used it with pork tenderloin to try and replicate a recipe I had at a restaurant in San Antonio. Serve with orzo with geeen chiles and cheese. A big hit.

AWESOME recipe. This sauce has a very earthy flavor, especially when the meat is smoked. The sauce works very well for pork as well, and can be prepared for casual or more formal dining. I first used this recipe for catering events, and it never failed to get raving comments from diners. This is a keeper and terrific for a night when something 'a little different' is in order. YUM.

this bbq sauce is simple and tastes delish. i used frest fruit (cherries, blueberries, plums and peaches) instead of dried (eliminated need for 1/4 c of water). i also used chicken thighs instead of drumettes. i canned the rest to use again.

Superb. My catering co-worker had a party and he asked me to prepare these. For that little something extra I brined the drumettes in 1/2 salt 1/2 brown sugar solution. The guest and I were delighted with the outcome. I like the sauce thick so I boiled it down quite a bit. This is a keeper.

I certainly thought this was good, but not out of this world (although in the recipe's defense I used dried Bing cherries rather than sour cherries). The recipe was not at all difficult and the directions were very accurate. I would not discourage anyone from trying this, since it seemed to please so many other reviewers, but I doubt I'll make it again. I'm really more into thinner, vinegar-based barbecue sauces. I'm wild for sauce from the "Chicken with Sweet and Spicy Barbecue Sauce" from the Epicurious site; consider trying that one!

used the sauce for a bbq with chili-rubbed, butterflied lamb. it was amazing. will definitely make again and again for bbq-ing chicken, lamb, pork ... served with buttermilk slaw recipe on epicurious.com - perfect, mellow compliment to the sweet and spicy dish.

I made it last summer for friends and it was a huge hit. One of my friends had a baby and asked me to prepare for her when she got home from the hospital.

Wow! I made this because of the recommendations and boy am I glad I did! It was a big hit. We used it on grilled chicken breasts. Next time I will add more ancho chilis, I did not detect any hotness which would have made it a little better but it was amazing anyways. Definetly a keeper.

This is a fabulous sauce! Very simple to make (be careful blending hot ingredients!!) I did not however use the sauce on chicken - I used it on a cumin rubbed pork tenderloin. Wow. This one is a definite keeper.

The sauce is fabulous!

The barbecue sauce is a keeper, although it was pretty thick right from the start. We had chicken pieces instead of drummettes and smothered 1 side with the sauce only. Wonderful.

I made these for an all Mexican food theme party. They turned out absolutely wonderfully... guests gobbled them up and even my husband who refuses to eat "barbecue" sauce raved over them. A definite keeper.

This sauce is fabulous! My husband hates chicken legs, and requested I barbecue a breast for him (with skin to keep it moist); The breast slathered in sauce was great! So were the legs. Would definitely make this again.

I made this for Father's Day and it was a big hit. The sauce was excellent and for a chicken wing recipe it was different than the norm - great for company!

Husband thought this was great. Sauce is very versatile, which is good because you will have lots leftover.
