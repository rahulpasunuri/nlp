Would make again, but with modifications. It wasn't quite sweet enough for my husband; although surely that is a personal taste issue. I think it could have been a tad sweeter and maybe used an enhancing flavor like a bit of orange zest. I was all set to have a non-jelled sauce as per the other posters but mine jelled FABULOUSLY and stayed jelled. Actually, it even jelled on my utensils before I washed them. All I can think is: be sure to really reduce the sauce till it is QUITE thick. I reduced it far longer than the 15+25 mins it called for, until it was very thick. It looked gorgeous in a fancy silicon bundt mold. Came out super-easy due to the silicon. Will definitely give this one another try at Christmas.

The recipe is great if you love apples and cranberries. To solve the problem with the mold, I added tapioca to the mix. Also, in serving, you can use chocolate syrup in a squeeze bottle to decorate a white plate. Then place the desert on the chocolate pattern. If chocolate and cherries go to gether, why not cranberries!

It's become a tradition at my Thanksgiving. Only downside is it won't jell. Doesn't matter - it's beoyond compare!

Very nice side dish, loved by all from 2 to 74. I don't have a food mill, but it was easy to just scrape the cooked mixture through a large sieve. It lost one rating point with me because it didn't jell - still tasted good, but I was hoping for a fancier presentation.

This recipe is just lovely as it is, very easy to make and tasty. To make it less formal in presentation omit the food mill and chill stages and just serve the lovely almost preserve-like consistency sauce straight from cooking! Absolutely scrummy in fresh roast turkey sandwiches.
