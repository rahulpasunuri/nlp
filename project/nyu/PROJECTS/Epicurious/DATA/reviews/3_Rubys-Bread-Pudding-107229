This is great with ham on Easter. I did not soak the bread in water and the results are still very moist.

I rediscovered this recipe and I still love it three years later. I realized I mistakenly wrote about cinnamon in my previous review. Sorry, there's no cinnamon on the recipe. What I did add this time is I whipped cream and laced it with ginger sugar. The combination rocks.

This is delightfullly moist pudding. I enjoyed the combination of nutmeg and cinnamon. I added a shot of aged rum whose taste goes really well with the raisins. Since the baguette was not too stale I didn't soak it first, but rather let the mixture rest for 5 minutes, so it was the mixture whioch actually was soaked up by the bread, enhancing the flavors within it.
