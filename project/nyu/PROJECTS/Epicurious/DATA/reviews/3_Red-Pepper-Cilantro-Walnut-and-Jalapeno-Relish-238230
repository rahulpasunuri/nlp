We enjoyed this a lot, although I wouldn't consider it to be a "relish" in light of the consistency. This, together with the za'atar (which I had to make because I couldn't find it premade and didn't have enough time to order it online), was soooo delicious on the seafood, on naan which I subbed for the flatbread because of time constraints, and on some morrocan- spice marinated grilled veggies I also made.

Everyone loved this with the seafood grill dish, and we had enough for leftovers. I used one large can of roasted peppers to save time, coriander and cumin powder (I did toast them still), because I didn't have seeds on hand, and I used jarred jalapeno slices chopped up instead of fresh. End product was delicious, though it was more of a thick sauce, instead of a relish, but it didn't seem to make a difference.
