Very tasty and easy to make. A great hit with my teenage boys. Definitely let it sit and marinate for at least an hour before grilling!

Very good and very easy to make. I made it exactly as instructed with marinade time about an hour and 15 minutes. Next time I would marinate longer (8 hours or even overnight) as there isn't anything in the marinade that will affect meat texture and more marinade time would add more flavor.

The lemongrass doesn't really add anything, and the final product tastes too much like sesame oil.

Chambord Sauce for Kebab: I do kebab a lot. Tawook (chicken) mostly but today I had to make do with beef due to the cost of lamb. I decided the meat needed a Persian treatment with a fruit-based sauce. Meat marinade, honey, red wine, olive oil, coriander, cinnamon, water, salt, sugar, pepper, dried garlic and a pinch of dry mustard. Grill on the hottest fire you can make with onions and peppers. Sauce for plate: 8-10 dried plums boiled in 1 cup water, sugar, salt, garlic, 2 tbsp of chambord depending on taste. Puree after it is cooked up and put another tbsp of chambord in to taste. It should cover the obvious prune taste. Persian recipes might add finely chopped nuts to the sauce. Serve with fragrant rice. If you can do it, cook it in a non-stick pan and cook till it sticks and begins to toast a bit then turn it out on a plate so you can enjoy the fried rice crust with some sauce.

This is a great dish. I am a cook and I make it for my employer fairly often. I also make it for myself. I've never had anything but compliments about it. I usually use bison or elk meat. Yummy!!!

This was a delicious recipe and very easy. The onl thing I did differently was that instead of a mortar and pestle, I ground everything up in a Cuisinart mini-prep. I definitely recommend marinating the meat, as it really soaked in the wonderful flavors of this dish.I would definitely make this again!

This turned out great. The most amount of time is spent prepping the paste.

This was a delicious dish. I followed the recipe exactly, and the flavors were perfect. This is an especially good use for the more lean and beefy tasting sirloin. Prepared at medium well, the meat was still quite tender.

I've made this twice now, first with beef, then lamb kebabs together with boned chicken thighs. It was a hit on both occasions. The only change I made was to replace the lemongrass with the zest of one large lemon, and sprinkled the grilled meat fresh lime juice (please, not the bottled stuff) just before serving. I accompanied this with the cinnamon orzo and roasted zucchini and radishes from the same Gourmet edition. Easy and delicious, people asked for seconds.

This is the third time I've used the grill and the fifth time I've made a menu. This recipe is easy and impressive. My father was floored for his early Father's Day dinner. The prearation involved made them think that I was a more advanced cook than I am. The taste did reflect the prep work involved. I served with coconut jalepeno rice on this website. My Chinese father said it was the best rice he ever tasted.

I found this was a lot of prep work and the flavor was just not there for all of the spices. Perhaps it really needs to be marinated for a lot longer to retain some of the flavor.
