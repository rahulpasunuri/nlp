I do not know where others are going wrong but this cookie is aboslutely perfect jsut the way it is. I ahve made these for the past 5-6 years and evryone loves them. A light, buttery cookie with amazong flavor. It's one of my favorites. Make sure you use butter a not margarine or crisco. Do not overcook them. Watch them and take them out of oven before they even looked finishes as cookies cook for another minute or two on the sheet

These cookies were just right for a quick and simple holiday cookie tray. Personally I sifted the flour and added 2tbls of molasses to enhance the ginger flavor in the cookie.

I agree with a few others. I have enjoyed Scottish Shortbread and by comparison these cookies taste like they have too much flour in them and not enough butter. My husband liked the cookies. I really enjoyed the ginger flavor but I would like to have tasted a buttery shortbread. I'll have to experiment next time....

These were so great. Servied with the Mango Mousse recipe from this site. So easy, and a lot of flavor. Next time I will try adding a touch of cardamom or nutmeg.

Based on prior reviews, I used water as a binder...just eyeballed it. I also found that the ginger was a bit of a binder too. I doubled the amount of crystalized ginger for bang from the ginger. Great recipe!

I served these cookies with a Cognac Pumpkin Creme Brulee and Cranberry Champagne Cosmopolitans for Thanksgiving desert. They were a perfect accompaniment! So good in fact that my sister "the family baker' asked for the recipe to replace her traditional Christmas shortbread cookies. Made them a few days before serving and they were still delicate and of wonderful texture and flavor!

Like some previous reviewers, I too had a hard time forming the dough into logs. I think this recipe just doesn't have enough butter. I have made other shortbread recipes that produce a much better cookie--and easier, too. The candied ginger is a nice change, but is it worth all the trouble? This recipe is good for those who don't mind the effort, loves ginger, and prefers a harder, less buttery type of shortbread.

These cookies are a BIG hit and I'm always asked to make them and to share the recipe. Make sure your ground ginger is fresh and use good quality crystalized ginger (e.g. from Ginger People) try forming the rolls on waxed paper before putting them in the fridge to chill. These are a classic.

Maybe someone else can help me out. I found it very difficult to shape the dough into logs and impossible to cut the logs into cookies. Any tips?

What a disappointment! I made the recipe as stated, following it to a T, and they taste like sweetened flour with a hint of ginger flavor. I've had better tasting shortbread before and will move on from this waste of quality ingredients.

These are absolutely amazing! I've made them twice in the last week because my husband ate the first batch in a day and a half. However, I learned with the second batch, that the longer you let the cookies sit in a tin, the more infused they become with the ginger and the better they taste! So horde them away for a few days before letting your family dig in.

I have made this recipe several times, and I always get asked for the recipe. I usually change recipes, but this one I pretty much follow to a T. Except I use 1/3 c. crystalized ginger instead of 1/4. Its great!!

I was expecting a big ginger punch with the combo of the powdered and the crystallized ginger. No such luck. I even added more crystallized ginger - almost a half cup, and extra lemon zest thinking this would give them an amazing blast. Again, no such luck. They were just ok. I didn't even bother baking the second log.

I am going to have to look for the soft ginger. The crystallized ginger is great BUT if you hit a chunk of it unexpectedly, it packs quite a punch! It was a great cookie, full of flavor.

Superior cookie! Very delicate, sophisticated flavor and good texture. I used the soft diced ginger from The Baker's Catalogue and everything was perfect. Also very simple to make.

These cookies were absolutely delicious! They were the hit of my holiday goodie tray, and as the inventory went down - we started to hoard them for ourselves! I made the recipe as given and found them very good, the level of ginger just right. This recipe is a keeper.

At first I was baffled that I was supposed to roll the dough (all I had was crumbs-- this happens with several shortbread recipes I've tried), but somehow I managed to shape the crumbs into logs. The cookies turned out delicious, especially topped with a piece of crystallized ginger on each before baking. Still, I might increase the ginger in the dough by 1-2 T.

I made these for a neighborhood cookie exchange next week and find them so unremarkable that I'm making different cookies before the big day. No substitutions were used. I added an extra ounce of crystalized ginger; maybe that was a mistake.

Cookies were as great as previous reviewers said that would be! I couldn't find any crystallized ginger, so I substituted with candied peel (lemon and orange).

Very good! The crystalized ginger added a very nice texture and flavor!

Very tasty! I made this recipe for Christmas, and it was a nice change of pace. As previously recommended, purchase the crystalized ginger root at a health store-- it's much cheaper.

We loved these cookies. The ginger is a great taste, in fact I will probably add more candies ginger next time. They were popular at work as well so I've found a new addition to my cookie regulars.

Very yummy! I made mine smaller because shorbread's tend to be heavy. I think I'd add more of the candied ginger root next time too.

Excellent! I served these cookies with a poached pear and green tea ice cream as a dessert for a luncheon with my in-laws, and they were just blown away. Even better, you can make the dough in advance and then just slice & bake when you're ready, so the cookies can be served warm, right out of the oven.

This may turn out to be my all-time favorite cookie recipe! I must have cut my cookies a little thinner than the recipe because I ended up with more than advertised! Also, I had to cut the cooking time by about 5 minutes. I found that buying the ginger at the health food store was MUCH cheaper than in the little bottle in the grocery store.

Great recipe. The crystallized ginger, although a bit difficult to locate in the store, turned out to be a great touch. All of the flavors came through beautifully. I had many compliments on these cookies over the holidays.

This recipe lived up to it's expectations by far. Highly recommended if you like light, delicious shortbread cookies.

An excellent twist to an old favorite. The chopped ginger even looked like bits of English toffee crumbled in. I would suggest cutting the shortbread in thicker slices in order to acheive the more traditional density.

Lovely classy shortbread biscuit. I left out the chrystalized ginger and the biscuits were still great. I also increased the baking time a little. The flavour was subtle and delicate - sure to impress.

This is an awesome shortbread recipe. It has turned out to be one of my husband's all time favorites. It had wonderful flavor, flakey and absolutely perfect with tea. We keep a roll in the refig and slice them up as we need them to serve with tea.
