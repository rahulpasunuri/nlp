I also had all of the ingredients on hand so I made this exactly as the recipe called for. I used large sardines and cleaned them as the author suggested. I didn't know that you were supposed to remove the heads, gill and guts. I used 3 grams of bonito flakes. The stock is a little fishier than the dashi I normally make. It was a good base for my miso soup.

This stock was pretty easy to make, because I already had all of the ingredients. On the advice of the previous reviewer, I added bonito flakes, which I normally like, but I think it made the broth a little fishy for me. I'd make this again, but leave out the bonito....

This stock definately benefits from the bonito flakes. A light, subdued but delicious broth, I recommend it to anyone looking for a flavorful fish stock for a soup. Adding a quarter pound of cod, sliced 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick and simmered for a further 9 minutes makes a delicious little soup. I very much enjoyed this recipe.
