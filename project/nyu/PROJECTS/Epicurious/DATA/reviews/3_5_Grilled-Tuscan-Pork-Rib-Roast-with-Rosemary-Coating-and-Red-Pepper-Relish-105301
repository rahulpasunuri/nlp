add some more garlic and olive oil a few red pepper flakes makes an awesome pasta sauce

I used lemon, parsley, and skipped the garlic. Grilled boneless pork ribs on a Forman grill for 15 minutes and it was great.

The result was great but we had a couple of 'hic-ups'. I bought an 8 rib pork roast (about 4#) and they didn't trim the thick bone off at the end of the rib bones and we couldn't cut through and have nice bone-in slices. This recipe stresses 325º and that didn't begin to get a nice crisp outer crust. When we took the roast off at 180º and after resting it was not anywhere near done and the outside was pale - fancy new high performance weber grill. We think the thermometer was too close to the bones - don't know why else it would have registered 180. But after a 400º confection oven recovery it was on the table about 20 minutes later. Moist, tender and perfectly done. I marinated the roast with the rub overnight and the relish is a must. It is not meant to be a sauce just a nice drizzle for color and flavor. Pass the remainder.

Had BBQ'D Pork loin chops, Go easy on the orange zest, skip anchovies, used calamata olives & artichokes, & a shake of oregano. Now that is a relish. Has more depth & flavor.

Careful on the orange zest. Use black or calamata olives instead of anchovies add some marinated artichokes,and this relish has much more depth!

Outstanding. Made it for our dinner club and it was a huge hit. Doubled the Rosemary coating (had a 7lb. roast) and doubled the relish. Cooked on a gas grill and it was perfect in about 90 minutes. A fair bit of work but well worth it.

seems the orange peel/zest was the issue with the recipe. I loved it! also added toasted pine nuts for another layer of flavors. try it!

Not sure if I qualify for actually having made this recipe, but rather an inspired improvision...Pork chops instead, prepared as suggested on a gas stove-top grill came out quick, tender and excellent; the relish something of a conundrum - having a challenge with the capers ingredient, I made a small batch with capers, as suggested, and another with currants. (Capers are a great stand alone garnish in my taste opinion.) The currants won out big time, with additional coarse ground pepper - fantastic. Roasted both orange and red peppers from the season end of the garden. Don't be hesitant on the orange ZEST - not orange peel - but taste as you go to make sure. Surely the author was intending just the zest.

I love this recipe. I use a center cut pork roast on the rotisserie and double the relish but omit the anchovies. I like anchovies but not in this. The orange peel is a must - don't diminish.

Do not put any orange peel in the relish. Inedible. Threw it away. Only added 1 tsp based on earlier reviews and it was still terrible. I bet it would be delicious without it. Orange peel in pork rub is fine though. Otherwise recipe is fine, used pork tenderloin and cooked in oven. Gave it 1 fork because of relish.

I oven roasted the pork instead of grilling and it was really tasty. Marinated the pork overnight in the fridge and then put in a 350 degree oven until the internal temp rose to 145. I let it sit while I finished dinner. My only complaint might be that there was too much orange in the red pepper "relish". All in all very tasty and the flavors blended quite nicely. Served with wilted greens (also on this website) and a pumpkin risotto.

The pork part of the dish was nice enough, but not special. The relish on the other hand was wonderful. By itself I didn't think it was extrodinary but paired with the pork it brought everything together into a lovely dish. It was a bit of effort but worth it especially after I tasted some of the leftover relish on a biscuit with smoked camembert cheese.

Due to the mad cow scare I prepared this dish for Christmas dinner for my family as an alternative to the prime rib roast that was to be the crowning glory of the meal. Everyone (inlcuding the 2 year old) preferred this dish to the prime rib and they are still raving about the sauce. I too cut down on the orange flavor, cooked it on a gas grill and I marinated it overnight.

Delicious! We did this on our covered GAS grill, checking its temperature often. We pulled it off the grill after just over an hour, and its temperature was just what the recipe directed. We tented it with foil and waited a few minutes to carve it. The bones charred a bit when we first put the roast on the grill (temperature was, I guess, too high), and this seemed to enhance the seared meat's flavor. Great relish, too. Like other reviewers, I too cut back on the amount of orange zest. This is a fantastic recipe! We served it with gemelli in a fresh tomato-herb sauce, baby spinach leaves dressed simply in EVO and kosher salt, homemade olive bread, and lots of red wine. Black Pepper Biscotti and Zabaglione Gelato (both recipes on this site, too) and Vin Santo for dessert. Heaven!

My husband and myself really enjoyed this dish. I did heed to many of the other reviewers advice about adding less orange zest in the relish. It worked perfectly. To lessen the work a bit I substituted already fire roasted pepers in a jar. They worked just as well, in my opinion. To accompany the pork we made the jalapeno and monteray jack cheese grits, asparagus, and chocolate pie for desert.

I love rosemary. Especially with lots of garlic. But this one was not worth the effort. The pepper relish was beautiful, but WAY too much effort for the results. Try the grilled Rosemary Flank with honey and soy instead.

We have never cooked a roast on the grill before. It was excellent, even on a gas grill. So tender and moist. However, did not care for the relish, too much orange taste. The pork did not need the relish.

Wonderful recipe. I cooked a center loin pork roast, instead of a rib roast, and grilled it on a rotisserie over a gas grill. The pork was moist and delicious. Took about 1 hour and 15 minutes (155 on a meat thermometer). I omitted the anchovies as I thought it would make the relish too salty. We really liked the fresh, citrusy flavor.

Great dish. We didn't love the relish (I'm not a big red pepper fan), but the pork was delicious and everyone raved about it. Would definitely make again sans the relish.

Excellent and very flavorful! The addition of the orange gave it a very light "summery" taste. I will probably cut down to 1 teas grated orange rind in the relish, as I felt it overpowered the rest of the flavors - bit, hey if you like that orange taste - go for it!

I made this recipe using boneless center cut pork chops and it was wonderful - easy and very favorful. Served with a potato & green bean salad, my guests told me this was one of the best meals I have served.
