Bland - Bland - Bland, the body of the sauce is nice, but it needs a kick to make it special

This is one of the best bolognese recipes I have made. It gets asked for over and over again. The pancetta really does give it a great flavor.

I studied many recipes as I was having company for dinner... When I read the reviews, I said to myself...come on, to the Nay Sayers, But I have to agree, this is BLAND. I even added extra garlic, wine and Italian seasoning. Thank goodness for the great Asiago cheese I topped it with and the wonderful crusty bread I served as it saved the day.

I read a lot of reviews, and made some adjustments to the recipe. 1st, I roasted a red pepper on the stove, peeled the black off, and threw that in the blender with stewed tomatoes and used that as my tomatoe add for the sauce. Then I used 3 cloves of garlic with the onions, carrots and celery base, towards the end of the cooking so it didn't burn. Used ground sirloin and chuck. Also used cayenne instead of black pepper. Whipping cream instead of whole milk. Basil on top. And fresh fettucine. Everyone loved it, fed 6 well informed Italian foodies, and everyone said it was great. No pancetta for me, but would have only enhanced the flavors...great recipe.

Good, but was definitely better after the addition of some Italian seasoning, garlic, and a 28 oz can of whole tomatoes (partially crushed by hand). I still think I'd like to play with it some more--maybe replace the carrot with red pepper.

This recipe is excellent. Growing up watching Nonna cook I know this is exactly the way old fashioned Italian food is meant to be. Few, high quality ingredients left to simmer over a long period... and always better the next day. I have a tendency not to measure but I did follow the recipe closely except I added lots of fresh garlic as suggested. Would make it again and would make it for company.

I agree with many others that this is a great basic recipe to start off with. I added garlic, a pinch of Italian seasoning, more red wine, and I also cooked it all afternoon before adding the milk, then let it cook down for another 1 1/2-2 hours.

I added two cloves of garlic and a package of baby spinach and it was great. The whole family loved it.

Oops - forgot to note in the below review that I took a large can of whole tomatoes, put them through the food processor, and added that in with the broth.

I used half the amount of vegetables (onions, celery, carrots) and 1 lb. ground beef, the whole tomato paste, can of chicken stock, 1 cup light cream, and spices: oregano, garlic, basil, and spaghetti - everything else the same. I wish I had pancetta but it was too cold to run to the store (I'm in Los Angeles - it's 55 outside but seems very cold) as I'm sure that would bring it up a notch, but it was exceedingly good.

I had a craving and this fit the bill. I didn't worry about exact measures and did add garlic as suggested, as well as herbs. My total cooking time was less than advised but it does need a good amount of stove time for the right consistency and taste. I used some canned tomatoes in place of some broth, and used the whole (small) can of tomato paste. Really satisfying! Probably even better tomorrow.

i gave it three out of four because of the ease in which this sauce comes together, and it's a good base to customize. but agree it needs some 'help'. substituted ground turkey for the veal, added sage, oregano, red pepper and garlic. used white wine instead of red. used the whole 5oz can of paste. stirred some fresh nutmeg into the milk as suggested to fake the 'gaminess'. perfect!

This has become my staple Bolognese sauce. Simply delicious!

I made this and found that I needed to add garlic, about 4-5 cloves, along with where it calls for 1 cup of whole milk, I used 2/3 cup of whipping cream and 1/4 cup of whole milk. I wanted it to have a richer base and it came out good.

I just made this tonight and both my fiance and I thought it was great! I did take some of the suggestion from other reviews and added garlic plus a little of Italian seasoning. Definitely a keeper.

Just finished eating and my husband loved it. I did make one change, however, and that was to substitute one 28 oz. can of San Marzano tomatoes in place of one cup of stock. Also used one cup of light cream because that's what I had at home. Added crushed red pepper flake, one bay leaf and some garlic salt - we like heavy flavor and spice. Will DEFINITELY make again.

I agree with other reviewers that garlic needs to be added to this recipe. I also found that the sauce needs to cook slowly for at least 3 hours before adding the milk, then at least another hour. The longer it cooks the better the sauce is with all the flavors melding beautifully This sauce requires patience, but the result is so worth it!

Rating: 4
this is a very authentic bolognese that my late Italian grandmother would be proud of. patience is the key. of course, i added garlic, doubled the wine & used homemade stock; cooked it slowly for 3.5 hrs before adding milk, another hour after. served it sprinkled with chopped fresh basil from the garden, parmigiano on the side. YUM, this is a fabulous & much easier recipe for the same results than Nonna made by cooking meat on bones for days...

Bolognese was a staple in my house growing up, so much so that different members of my family had different takes on it. My mom tended to be a little more heavy on the cut and quantity of the veg, while my dad was a bit more refined and involved with it. Mine turned out to be a hybrid of the two. Point being this recipe is a perfect starter and is authentic. It'll get you a delicious bolognese. If you want to give it a bit more interest you can fake some gaminess by adding a little chicken liver, use nutmeg and deglaze with madeira (or marsala).

I have lived in Bologna, Italy for many years and this recipe is rather authentic. I suggest trying it with the substitution of pancetta with ground Bologna (yes, the cold cuts) which originated in Bologna. I cook my ragu at least three hours, let it rest overnight in the fridge and cook it another hour the next day. This is not a recipe for people in a hurry ;)

One word - boring! Added much needed garlic then started looking at other recipes to see what else I could add, such as bay leaves, thyme, more tomato paste. I will pay more attention to other reviewers next time.

I sub'd slow cooked beef pot roast instead of veal.Which worked very well and this was an amazing dish. Believe the recipe directions when it stated to simmer for at least 1.5 hours. It truly makes a difference.

Excellent, but to take it up a notch, it needs Finely Chopped Garlic,( which I think the printer must have forgotten to add), and some red pepper flakes. If yours it too "runny" just keep reducing it, you will not ruin the taste, or do not add all of the 3 cups stock liquid, start with 2 cups and add more if too dry. The slow reduction is what makes it so good. For those who complained that it is too bland, the garlic and if you reduce the red wine more then 1 minute will give you more flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly but I, like some of the other reviewers, found this to be a bit bland and lacking something (the amount of liquid was about perfect, however--not too runny or dry). I'll try another bolognese recipe next time.

I've been on a search for years for an awesome bolognese. AND HERE IT IS! Runny? Interesting. I prepared this recipe and only increased the amount of tom paste. As it cooked down, there was not a lot of liquid. The flavor was complex and my sons (both teenagers) LOVED it. I've made it several times and am now making it for a visiting friend. YUMMY!

This is a great recipe. I used only ground beef and added some additional tomato paste and some fresh thyme. I've added it to my recipe box and know I'll make it over and over again.

We just returned from Bologna, and I was looking for a recipe that would resemble what I had there. This is very similar, in that it is not heavy on tomatoes, and the use of milk and ham (pancetta) gives it richness that the typical ground beef and tomatoes American standard doesn't have. The flavor of this recipe is excellent. My one reservation is the overly liquid consistency. I had to simmer it much longer than given in the instructions to bring down the runnyness. Oddly, the author of the recipe seems obsessed with it being too thick. I recommend using about a cup LESS stock than given here. You can always add more. P.S. real bolognese sauce IS thick. There should be no puddle in the plate when you finish. So this is a great recipe -- just be careful about the amount of liquid so you don't have to simmer it forever.

I have tried several ragu bolognese sauces and this is by far the best. I agree that while the recipe takes time relative to planning, it is fairly simple to make. I followed the recipe to the letter and my family agreed it's one of the best dishes we've ever eaten!

Surprised at the mixed reviews. I added a bit more wine and a bit more tomato paste than called for but I found the dish wonderfully complex, rich, and certainly worthy of getting added to my recipe box where it will be made again and again.

Made this as this recipe directed and thought it was rather bland. Perhaps next time cook the meats then then vegetables in the renderings.

Made this for dinner last week and it was delicious. One of the best things to come out of my kitchen EVER and it went up on my cooking blog that night (dinnerdelish.blogspot.com). Very similar in flavor to my favorite Bolognese recipe from a local Italian place. Definitely make this.

I love the simplicity of this recipe...I was skeptical at first but I followed it to a tee and it came out amazing! Rich and delicious! Will definitely make again....yum!

Prep time is very short, which is the only good thing about this recipe...still waiting for the magic! This dish is very bland so added some dried pepper flakes to boost it a little. Won't be making this again.

This turned out great. I do feel the cook time is a little unnecessary. I simmered for 30 min before adding the milk and then simmered for another 20 or so. Turned out the same. I also added some chili flakes.

Very simple to make. The long simmering time is worth it - don't skimp on it. I made it with all ground beef (top sirloin which I chopped in the food processor), bacon and 1% milk and it was fantastic, very well balanced flavors.

This is one of the best Italian recipes Ive made in a very long time. Prep time is minimal compared to the inactive cooking time (2.5 hours). And the long cooking process makes your house smell wondrous. I did not use ground veal, but instead used 1lb of ground sirloin. I used all organic ingredients, and the veal is the only one I switched out. Additionally, you must find fresh pasta, preferably an egg recipe. Im sure it would still be good with a standard dry pasta, but the perfect bite you get from a fresh pasta is, IMO, necessary for this sauce. I will most definately make this sauce again!
