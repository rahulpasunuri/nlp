Amazing buttery, lemony, almond goodness. The only variances I made was using organic whole wheat pastry flour, took out 2 tablespoons of it and replaced it with flax seed meal (because I had it on hand and needed to use it up). They were quite yummy with a martini! Cheers : )

I will definitely make this again. These cookies keep forever in a sealed container, and they are the perfect use for the fine bits that result when I chop almonds for other uses. I love the delicate whiff of lemon flavor contributed by the zest.

This is a wonderful summer cookie! I rolled the dough into smaller balls and pressed them with a cookie press. They are certainly old-fashioned and just the right amount of lemon. The almonds add texture and this buttery thin cookie got rave reviews from my family. I had to hide them! Or make another batch.... lovely with tea. Also a great cookie to serve with blueberries! Yum!

I used almond flour instead of the finely ground almonds & substituted 1/2 cup of the flour for the almond flour also. I also added a splash of almond & vanilla extract. When I took the cookies out of the oven, I glazed them with a lemon juice & powdered sugar mixture. Sooo good! I will def make these again!

Great cookie. I was looking for a cookie to make with my almond butter, and this worked well. Parchment would be a good idea. So would a little lemon icing.

These turned out quite tasty. I added a splash of almond extract and a squeeze of lemon juice. They are a bit boring looking, though. I think if I make them again I'll try to find a lemony glaze or drizzle white chocolate or something.

Tasteless, heavy, just another uninspired butter sugar flour combination

This was a great recipe to find for a lemon almond fan like me. Very nice flavor. not too sweet. I did add 1//2 tea of almond extract. I chopped slivered almonds with a heavy knife, it was fine. I have a tip: Walnut size is too big for 2 ins. apart. maybe, half that size. Next time I will use parchment.

Of all the cookies I baked for Christmas, these were rated NUMBER ONE! My brother-in-law, Charlie, who normally doesn't have a sweet tooth pretty much ate his way through the ones I brought to my brother's, daughter's, and his sister's house. This recipe was easy to prepare and the results are awesome! I wouldn't change a thing. Charlie is coming to brunch on January 2, so I had better get back in the kitchen and make another batch.

Delicious and easy cookie, if you roll them first, they come out perfectly round. Very delicate lemon flavor, good with tea.
