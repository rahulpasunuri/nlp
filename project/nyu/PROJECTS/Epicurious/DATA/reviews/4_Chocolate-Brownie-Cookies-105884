I prefer my cookies with a chewier middle so I used a tablespoon and ended up with 24 cookies which were cooked perfectly in 9-10mins.

I made these cookies last night, and they turned out very good! Great right out of the oven with melting chocolate chips still warm. I liked the meringue texture on top which added a bit of crispness, adding nicely to the soft center. would definitely make these again. Easy recipe for a not so good baker, such as myself.

These were so good, I made these a second time for Christmas, and I just slightly overbaked this batch. This made them a little dry, but everyone was still happy to eat them.

I was expecting more from this recipe. I was hoping for the chewyness of a meringue and the bite of a brownie. I followed the recipe exactly and it only yielded 3 dozen cookies. Each cookie was measured out with a teaspoon. I found the cookie to be dry and just not great all around.

These cookies are super decadent and look so pretty when the powdered sugar coating cracks on top. Next time I'll skip adding in the 1/2 cup of chocolate chips since they're already so rich, I don't think it needs them.

What a delicious recipe! I doubled this recipe and brought these for a charity bake sale at work and was returned an empty tupperwear container and rave reviews! I am pretty accident-prone when it comes to baking and was worried about screwing these up for the bake sale, but they came out perfectly! I almost always burn the bottoms and leave the tops undercooked, but these had great texture. I, unfortunately, don't have a standing mixer so I did have to hold my mixer for 15 minutes. I have already had two other people ask me for the recipe and I will definitely make this again! Yum, yum!

Great cookie! I made exactly as written, using Giradelli Bittersweet (60% cocoa) and Giradelli Unsweetened. I thought they were better the next day but they sweeten up a lot! I would almost conider reducing the sugar if I wasn't nervous about ruining the texture. I beat the batter for about 17 minutes & that was perfect. The dough worked best before I chilled it between batches (the consistency is like thick cake frosting), but all the cookies came out fine. Oh, I used half toasted walnuts & half choc. chips (chopped about in half) & this was perfect. These are so easy & fast!

Not only are these yummmmmmy, they really were easy to make - I started the eggs, sugar and vanilla in my stand mixer, then assembled everything else. I used some espresso chocolate I had in the cupboard, as another reviewer suggested, so I didn't add the espresso, however in the future, I think I'd just use instant espresso dissolved in water, not brew a whole pot! The other change I made that made the recipe easier was to melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave, 30 seconds at a time, stirring each time. Simple! My batter set up in the five minutes it took to clean up a little bit, and if you really do make them a heaping TEASPOON (not the tablespoon you might be tempted to use!), they cook perfectly in the time suggested (at least in my oven, they took 9 minutes). Definitely recommend these little drops!

These are absolutely ridiculous. Definitely for chocoholics. I just ate them straight out of the oven and feel a little sick because I couldn't stop! Yikes.

Rating: 4
Deelicious! Rich chocolate-brownie flavor in a slighty-crunchy-on-the- outside cookie. I have a standing mixer, so did not find these labor- intensive at all. I did not need to refrigerate the batter as other reviewers have suggested; just left it sitting on the counter for five minutes and it puffed up to the right consistency. Can't get chocolate chips here, so I added a little extra chopped chocolate. Be careful not to cook them too long or you'll lose the soft, gooey interior. I can't wait to make these again.

I have been making these for years, and they are always a hit. Instead of mini chocolate chips I use chopped dried bing cherries - they are even chewier and the cherries nicely balance the chocolate (I use all bittersweet). a 1/2 oz. disher makes the perfect size...

Not really worth the effort -- these were a bit on the unchewy side, and really labour-intensive for what they produced.

A little finicky in the prep work- I have a tiny kitchen in NYC and had to use an electric hand beater (not ideal). After a little effort, though cookies turned out soft and delicious. I used espresso-flavored bittersweet chocolate and kahlua instead of the teaspoon of espresso and vanilla with delicious results. Definitely try the espresso-flavored chocolate if you can find it!

Rating: 3
These are good, albeit a bit weird. It was not worthwhile to brew an entire pot of espresso for the amount here, so I used coffee liqueur for that as well as the vanilla. Is it really necessary to preheat the oven before the 15 minutes of egg beating, as well as the possible chilling time to firm up the batter??? I used some dried cherries with the chocolate chips, and thought it was a great cookie, although not much like a brownie. Will make them again.

Just like the blurb says at the beginning, mini brownies a little like a meringue. I can't get semisweet chips here, so chopped some appropriate chocolate to a suitable size.

I'm printing this out to make my third batch of these - very good! I followed recipe exactly except for needed a bit more cooking time, but I think my oven may be off on temps a bit. They get MUCH better after a day or two and freeze nicely.

Followed the recipe exactly and the cookies we big dry lumps. Is more coffee needed that 1/2 tbs?

Having a stand mixer makes this recipe exceptionally easy. I also don't bother with using a double boiler to melt the chocolate, instead I use the microwave and stir often. I never get 5 dozen cookies though. I've substituted Kahlua for the espresso with good results. I brought these into the office and it got rave reviews. I have the Fleming cookbook that this recipe came out of and it's one of the easier ones in the book.

YUMMY! Have made these twice now for icecream sandwiches and they are absolutely devine. Because of the softness of the cookie, the sandwiches can be made ahead of time and they are still soft enough after being pulled out of the freezer. DELICIOUS!

I had been searching for a cookie recipe like the amazing "chocolate radicals" that I purchased at Enrico Biscotti in Pittsburgh, PA. After much searching, THIS IS IT (or really, really close)! Wonderful texture and flavor. The recipe is fairly easy and the results are amazing...make them once and you'll be hooked! If you're in PIT, Enrico is a wonderful bakery in the strip district. Go Steelers!

First made these around the holidays and they were a hit! Also great with dried cherries mixed in. Texture is wonderful on these, just as described.

These cookies are quite delicious. Although not as earth-shattering as other reviews might have you believe, they are very much like brownies when made correctly (e.g., mixed for the full 15 minutes, correct amounts of bittersweet and unsweetened chocolate, batter placed in freezer or fridge for 5 minutes after combining in the chips, etc.) Plus, they really have an EXCELLENT texture--crisp on the outside and chewy in the center. However, they require a little more work than your average cookie. My fiancee and I figured that we'd make them again with the suggested modifications, like adding some dried cherries, nuts, or even some coconut instead of the mini-chocolate chips. We actually halved the recipe to make only about 16 cookies and we used both Ghiradelli 60% bittersweet chocolate and Hershey's unsweetened chocolate. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
These cookies are amazing, the perfect combination of the best attributes of a cookie and the best attributes of a brownie. The only thing I would change for next time is using regular size chocolate chips instead of mini chocolate chips. I found that the mini chips got totally lost in the final product. I think having the actual chocolate chunk contrast in the cookie would be a really nice added bonus.

Rating: 4
This is the best chocolate cookie I've ever made. For my last dinner party where I made many desserts, this was a prime dessert appetizer of sorts. I broke pieces of a Lindt 80% bittersweet chocolate bar instead of the chips and it gave that instant chocolate 'high'. Even among burned out chocoholics. A week after I still had guests describing their experience with this cookie.

1. i've never heard of extra bittersweet chocolate before either, but apparently regular works just fine. 2. i too only have a hand mixer, but based on earlier reviews i melted the chocolate first and let it cool a bit while beating the eggs. the resulting batter was still a bit runny so i put it in the fridge for 5 minutes. 3. i made the cookies slightly larger than a teaspoon, like the recipe says, and got 50 cookies. this is one of the best cookies i've ever made, only got three forks because they do take a while. the small size is a perfect balance for the richness and i was pleasantly surpised by how chewy they were for being so small! very delicious, a keeper!

I just finished making these from the Claudia Fleming cookbook and then searched for it on this website to get others' comments because I only got about 3 dozen cookies from the batch. I see that seems to be the case. I followed the recipe exactly except substituted 1/2 cup of coconut for the chocolate chips. The batter will set up if you beat it well and then let it sit as directed. Having said all that, the cookies are delicious - great texture and taste.

Excellent intensely chocolate flavored cookies that almost melt in your mouth. Not overly sweet.

These were fantastic and easy. I substituted regular chocolate chips for the minis, using what I had on hand. No problems at all with the texture-it was like fairly thick brownie batter (beating the full 15 minutes is the key) and was very firm after chilling. Ate them warm outdoors at a Willie Nelson concert-very yummy.

By far the best chocolate cookie I've ever made. The problem I've had with other chocolate cookies is that the cookie ends up being too dry and not "chocolatety" enough. This recipe solves that problem with the large addition of melted chocolate instead of cocoa powder. Made all the difference -- really does end up like a mini brownie -- crusty and flaky on the outside and moist and gooey on the inside. As suggested by other reviewers -- I refrigerated the dough until it had the consistency of a frosting. This one's a keeper.

Heavenly! I cooled the chocolate mixture before folding it into the eggs, which resulted in a much stiffer batter. They melt in your mouth.

I made the first batch of these exactly as the recipe says and the batter is way to thin for a decent cookie. So, I generously sprayed a non-stick muffin tin, put some chopped walnuts in the bottom and put a heaping tablespoon of batter in each cup. Cooked them a little longer than the regular recipe. Cooled them completly and got the most divine little brownie cookies that were perfect for presentation you could ever imagine. They had crunch, crispy and chewy all wrapped up in a perfectly round little dessert!! ;)

Very nice, used white choc chips (just because I had them at the time) big hit with the 3 girls. Would definitely refrigerate the mixture for better shape.

Texture and consistency of the cookie were amazing - and how easy to make! My only comment would be to drop the batter in 1/2 teaspoons onto the paper rather than teaspoons because with heaping teaspoons you only get about two and a half dozen.

Terrific cookies, and just like the brownies I love with a beautiful shiny crackly brown surface, chewy and chocolatey inside. That said I would like to share that I made them following the directions to the best of my ability, however, with an oven with no temperature setting (a chair with a bottle of water pressed up against the nob is needed to keep the gas on), no measuring cups or spoons, guessing at quantity of chocolate was especially without clue, and mixed my hand. I did refrigerate the batter for almost 5 minutes before baking, just to be on the safe side. They turned out great, a big hit here in Bilbao even without the luxery of a fabulous kitchen. Enjoy!

The only problem with these cookies is keeping them around. I made them to add some chocolate to my holiday cookie selection, but I don't think they are going to make it into any gifts. They are absolutely delicious. And don't taste the dough before you bake them: you might end up eating it all before it gets into the oven!

Wow. These cookies are beautiful to look at with their shiny, crispy outer coat and a joy to eat with a soft, oh-so-chocolatey center.

The perfect answer to that little bite of chocolate after a meal or with a cup of coffee!! I followed the recipe exactly except I melted the butter and chocolates (except chips) in a glass cup in the microwave. Everything worked perfectly and I made them the recommended size and got almost 6 dozen cookies. I highly recommend baking them on a silpat. By the way, they freeze well, too! Great to make ahead for a party.

The cookies were wonderful on my first bake, no modifications. Second time, I inadvertently left out the flour mixture after the folding step... batter spread a bit in the oven, but the cookies were still yummy. I allowed COMPLETE cooling on the baking sheets to avoid excessive crumbling. Accidentally modified recipe is thus great for people with allergies to flour.

Indeed, very soft, chewy, chocolaty cookies. However, I had to experiment with the "batter". I really suggest both adding a bit more flour and putting it in the freezer for a few minutes, otherwise you'll end up with pancakes! Took me a garbage batch to realize this. With the adjustments I would make these cookies again.

Great recipe, very intense and chocolatey. I recommend putting batter in the freezer for ten minutes before baking--smaller, more compact cookies were better. If the batter is warm it tends to spread out and make bigger less meringue like cookies.

These weren't as good as I was led to believe...the one bonus is that because the amount of flour is so small you can easily subsitute rice flour for a gluten free cookie with good results.

This recipe has become a household standard. I found it works as a great "filler" when there are multiple dessert options. The cookies have texture, but they are light enough to keep people coming back for more. One word of caution: the recipe has never made 5 dozen cookies for me. You'll need to double the batch to make 5 dozen.

I decided to try this recipe for a cookie swap party. It was easy to make. The batter was a bit runny but did solidify. I would describe the consistency as similar to thin cake frosting. The yield, however I found to be incorrect,getting about 3 dozen....and that was after I decided to use regular teaspoons instead of heaping ones as suggested. So needed to make a second batch and for some reason the consistency came out a bit thicker, but still yielded about 3 dozen. There also may be some variation in consistency depending on what type of chocolate is used as percentages of cocoa vary among brands (I melted Lindt bittersweet bars in the 3.5 oz size which I was told was 42% cocoa)and used a scale to get the 5 oz. total. After melting 1 1/2 oz. of the unsweetened chocolate I tasted it and decided to substitute the last l/2 oz of unsweetened with semisweet as it was beginning to taste a little bitter to me. The cookie looked a bit plain and small so I sprinkled a touch of confectioner's sugar over tops. They tasted very good and the consistency was brownie-like. My kids liked them too so I wouldn't say it's only an adult cookie! (maybe they wouldn't have if I left in all the unsweetened chocolate as called for). I may try this again and see how a larger size cookie comes out.

Don't know what I did wrong - followed recipe to a T but cookie dough was too runny and they didn't puff or crackle when I baked them. Used parchment paper, waxed paper and spilpat. Stuck to both the waxed paper and spilpat; recommend using parchment paper only. They turned out flat and not very attractive, but they tasted delicious. Would make them again for myself and my husband, but not to take to a party.

Great recipe and surprisingly easy - possibly the best chocolate-chocolate cookie I have ever had. The key is to incorporate as much air into the egg mixture as possible - you must beat them at high for the 15 minutes. Then carefully fold in the choc. and flour mixture - do not over-fold or you will lose all of the air. Mine were done in 8 minutes. Loved them - will defintely make them again and again.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted very yummy. I did a little substituting to make my tastebuds happy. I used TollHouse chocolate chips instead of the chocolate and then used crushed up Score bars in exchange for the mini chocolate chips. They are hard to get off of the pan, but once you get them to your mouth, you won't care how they look!!!

Personally, I thought that these cookies were good but not irresistable, BUT my 9 yr.old son, who regularly eschews sweets (unlike the rest of his family), loved these and has asked for me to bring a batch to his class Valentine's Day bash. That,to me, is enough reason to make them again.

did i do something wrong? they came out with burnt bottoms, so i lowered the fire by 10* and baked them for 6 minutes and they still burnt. and besides that they tasted real bitter. but i followed the directions to the tee, i definately wont' try them again. a dissappointment.

What a total disaster; I tried to double the recipe for a party, and must have gotten my quantities of chocolate mixed up. First, I noticed them running all over the cookie sheet while in the oven. Then, once when they came out, I cooled them on a wire rack, but could not get them off the waxed paper, without breaking them into crumbs. The taste was good, but obviously the presentation was unacceptable for a party.

Rating: 4
These are great, relatively easy cookies, and they are just what I like, rich, chewy, and chocolatey. I made them and baked them in a short amount of time. They should be bigger than the recipe calls for, so they have more of the chewy texture. I used regular dark chocolate and unsweetened and they were just as good, and not too chocolatey. These are my faves!!

Rating: 4
I think these turned out great. I used 1/2 cup of chopped toffee (Skor bars)and 1/4 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips for the 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips. I didn't find the chocolate of the cookie overly sweet so the toffee added that slight sweetness and a bit of crunch to it. Everyone that tasted them loved them. I could see where they may not be the perfect chocolate cookie to make for children except for those with a more sophisticated taste. Perfect for adults! I think that next time I may try making them a bit larger than the teaspoon called for and see how they turn out.

This cookie recipe is great. I recommend making them a bit bigger than one teaspoon so that you really get the brownie texture... Really moist, chewy and definitely a hit with chocoloate lovers. Next time, I will try it with dried cherries...

Maybe this IS a grown up cookie like everyone says, but SO WHAT? THEY'RE DELICIOUS! This was a last minute attempt to use up some high quality leftover chocolate in my kitchen, and boy was it worth it! I've never seen my grandmother eat sweets, but after one bite she was hooked. I think she downed at least 5! Great cookie for those who love dark chocolate! P.S. Don't worry about doing all the steps at once. Take your time! It's not brain surgery ;-)

This is definitely a cookie for grown-up tastes. I wouldn't have liked it as a kid either! However, I do love it now and my guests thought it was a very elegant cookie and I gave out several copies of the recipe. Please, please use the highest quality chocolate you can find.

I love dark bittersweet chocolate, but I agree with the cook who said that she experienced a chocolate overdose. Next time, I would add at least a quarter cup more sugar. Also, I have a hand mixer, and it was quite a juggling act to stir the melting chocolate and butter with my left hand while mixing the eggs, vanilla, etc. with my right. And maybe it's my oven, but the texture was nothing unique in my kitchen. With more sugar, this would be an interesting cookie, but never my signature piece.

I thought I was about to die of a chocolate overdose, and as opposed to others who has reviewed and tasted these cookies, I could NOT eat more than one PER WEEK - they are TOO much... And the test of all test - kids, lots of them, and not one of them liked them... They all tasted the cookies,and I thought they would fly off the table, but they just put them down and left them. I made the 5 dozens, but threw away 4 dozen three days later, when it became obvious that they would NEVER be eaten... Too bad - and I am a diehard chocolate lover. Well, guess my love for chocolate just got put to the test, and failed...

In the many many many years I've made, eaten and tasted different cookies, brownies and chocolates, I have yet to make or eat something better. If I was lost on an island, I'd ask for a box of these and be content! The texture of the outside, and the inside of the cookie is unexplainable. Make these - you won't regret it!
