This was my go to summertime treat recipe last summer. Sooo refreshing! Very easy to make and gorgeous served up in margarita glasses. It has been a repeat request this summer, and I'm guessing it will be in the years to come, too.

The gingered strawberries are wonderful on their own - I wouldn't bother with the granita as we don't care for watermelon.

The ginger adds extra sparkle to this refreshing and fun treat. Next time will make much smaller strawberry pieces for a varied effect.

The was a wonderfull and fresh end to a hot summer BBQ. It was well recieved by everyone and was very easy to prepare! One note- reduce the sugar.
