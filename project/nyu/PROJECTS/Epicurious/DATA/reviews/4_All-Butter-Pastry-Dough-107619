I used arthur mills whole grain pastry flour, and only 4-5 tsps water. Results were much more crumbly than with white all-purpose. It was not elastic enough to roll out.

Fabulous! I made it in a food processor with regular unsalted butter; the pastry was flaky & buttery. And it was so easy to make!

This is my favorite pastry for fruit pies and tarts. It is nicely rich, and has a good texture. I make it with regular butter in a mixer, and it works well every time. I don't like to use hydrogenated fats in my cooking, so I was pleased to find a good butter-only recipe.

I am a pie crust zero and I actually made this. One trick I picked up along the way is to use frozen butter; just chop up into pieces and go with it. This worked very well.

I've made this crust (with the apple calvados tart) twice now: once pressed into a tart pan, and another time as a freeform pie baked on a cookie sheet, with the edges folded over. Both times were great. Don't skip the frissage (sp?) step, where you smear the dough on the cutting board. It really contributes to the flakiness of the crush.

I loved this recipe... I made it quite a while ago... my question is, can you use the dough recipe to make a fruit pie (such as blueberry) Has anyone tried this?

Mmmmm. Delicious! I'm not a great crust-maker, but this came out flaky and beautiful under my apricot-blueberry tart. I used just plain old land-o-lakes butter, and it was great. I divided the dough in half and made a small tart, saving the rest for later.

Very easy to make with a nice buttery taste yet still flaky. Beats all those hydrogenated-oil (shortening) recipes!

This is a great pastry recipe! I recommend trying it with Plugra butter also -- frankly, I was amazed, but there really is a difference. Very tender and flaky. Freezes well. I use much less water when making the dough; I'm not enough of an expert to know if that usually happens when using Plugra butter. As I understand it, Plugra butter has less water and has more milk solids than 'regular' butter does. And the entire 'Apple and Calvados Tart' recipe is outstanding, give it a try. Last time I substituted Amaretto for Calvados and it was delicious, too.

This crust and the tart it goes with are wonderful! One word of caution - the first two times I made it I used the food processor technique, then I made it by hand blending. The difference was quite significant! The hand blending made a much more delicate crust and was well worth the effort (as was the entire tart!)

This is a wonderful pastry dough and very easy to make. Follow the hint and use the richest butter you can find. I used Plugra and everyone raved over the light and flaky crust. Plus you can make it ahead, which makes it perfect for entertaining.
