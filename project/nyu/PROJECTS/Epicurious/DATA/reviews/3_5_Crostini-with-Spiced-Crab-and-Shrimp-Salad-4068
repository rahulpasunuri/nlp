Oh, so easy! The key? The freshest crab & shrimp. We are lucky here in Madison, Wisconsin for we can get the best wild-caught, Gulf of Mexico 'White' Shrimp and 'Blue' Crab, fresh (never frozen!) delivered here, on ice from hyper-refrigerated trucks, overnighted from Galveston, Texas! This occurs several times in early Fall. This is a fail-safe recipe! Instead of cayenne pepper, I use several generous shakes of Tabasco. I also add lots of fresh, finely-ground, Tellicherry black pepper. We use brioche buns, hamburger or good hot dog (or bratwurst) buns, instead of the baguette! Just toast or grill the buns, then a quick spritz of olive oil, a swipe of melted butter or some good mayonnaise, throw some shredded lettuce on it and heap the seafood salad on the top. Better than (or as good as) a fresh lobster roll on the Maine coast in the summertime.

Thanks to the other helpful reviews. I made this for a party tonight and it was a great hit. Sadly, my usual stomping ground was out of fresh crab (hate the canned stuff), so I made this with 1 - 1/3 pound of shrimp. Sauteed some choppped shallots ane garlic and shredded ginger. When reducing the clam juice, add a few splashes of fish sauce, rice wine vinegar, Old Bay seasoning and about 1/2 teaspoon of red curry paste. Mixed this and the chopped shrimp with some mayo, (1/2 the amount of) green onion, Vidalia onion, fresh lemon juice and zest. I served in some phyllo shells as another reviewer suggested and they were great. Probably great on crostini, crackers or in a sandwich as well. Don't be afraid of the heat from the Old Bay and the red curry paste, the sweetness of the shrimp (and crab, I'm sure) plus the citrus from the lemon juice and zest and the mayo all stabilize the heat, so that the impact is subtle, late and lingering... as it should be.

We've made this before (years ago), made it again last night for a wine party. Rave reviews. Definitely cut down on green onion to about 1/2C. We might even try sauteeing them with the shrimp next time. Could probably use just a little less mayo. Added a couple shakes of Old Bay Seasoning. We don't assemble this, we serve the bread or crackers on the side, and serve as a dip so as to keep the bread or crackers crisp. Works out great!

I thought it was good but not great. I have other shrimp salad recipes I like better.

This is an easy, delicious make ahead appetizer that tastes quite elegant (and goes very well with a crisp white). I recommend cutting back substantially on the scallions, and waiting until guests arrive to assemble the crostini so the bread remains crisp. I made 1/3 of the recipe for a smaller crowd and it worked very well.

I didn't have time to do the shrimp part, but even a streamlined version of this dish using leftover crabmeat was a resounding success with my guests. The subtle heat and complex flavors of the dressing perfectly complemented the sweetness of the crab. I agree with other cooks who said the recipe called for way too much scallions and cut them back to a more sensible amount. Also, as others suggested, I served the dip in a bowl, so guests could spread their own little toasts, which were a big hit too.

Served this as an appetizer New Year's Eve. It was a hit! I served it in martini glasses, garnished with sprigs of chives a cracker in the glass and set out extra crackers. Used precooked shrimp, eliminated green onions and used a sprinkling of chopped chives. Plenty of leftovers. The next day we buttered and toasted the sliced hot dog rolls and had crab & shrimp rolls !!! I'll be serving this poolside this summer, sooo easy!!!

I took the advice of cutting down on the green onions and only used half, it was delicious! I threw my husband a birthday party this past weekend and all of our guests loved it! I will definitely make it again. Thanks!

At the advice of other reviewers, I reduced the green onions to 1 cup, increased the shrimp (precooked bay shrimp) to 1 pound and used about 3/4 pound canned crab. I also used the premade, frozen phyllo cups instead of crostini. I used a melon baller to fill the cups. Great reviews from a party of 25 and they were the appetizer first to go. Easily made 60 cups. Simple enough to do again.

The amount of gren onions is wayyyyyyyy too much. I just found this to be so-so.

This recipe was good but could have been better... I found the green onions overpowering (and I love onions!). It just seemed too "green" and had a "grassy" taste to it... (maybe I shouldn't have used the onion tails, but the recipe did not indicate otherwise). Next time I will grate sweet Vidallia onions instead... The seafood itself was great though ~ I used "Croustades" instead of Crostini and the texture was simply fabulous. "Croustades" are a light textured cracker shaped like a little bowl and I found them in the seafood section of my grocery store... YMMM !!!

Everyone will want the recipe to this wonderfully easy and tasty dish. I had to make a few changes because I couldn't find crabmeat at the grocery. I used a pound of cooked, peeled shrimp which I soaked in salt water before chopping up. It was simply terrific - will try with crab next time.

I'm from Gloucester MA, we have been making this type of salad for years. We put it together like a Lobster Roll. No matter what, it's great.

This is really good. I did not use the crostini - I served with toasted crackers. It makes a ton - I would probably make half recipe next time.

This was a delicious lunch salad which I served to guests along with a pasta salad and a fruit salad. I put the crostini on a separate plate and let my guests serve themselves so there was no time for the crostini to become soggy. Everyone loved it. It tastes very fresh and summery.

Excellent appetizer - and great b/c it can be made ahead of time. Definitely COARSLEY chop shrimp - its an extra added bonus to tast the bits of shrimp - rather than having them finely chopped with the crabmeat- Definitely a keeper

I made this recipe for a party at my brothers house. He and his friends were in the kitchen eating these delicious appetizers as fast as I could make them. Everyone loved them so much he asked me to make them again for Christmas.

I made this recipe as a sandwich filling on crusty french bread. I prepared it the day before I served it, and it was lightly spicy and delicious. It would be a good filling to stuff into tomatoes for an elegant lunch.
