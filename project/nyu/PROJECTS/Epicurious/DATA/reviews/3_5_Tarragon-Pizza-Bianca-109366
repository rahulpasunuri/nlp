Tasty! When we do it again, I am sauteing at least the shallots first. Also could do without the fennel. MUST add salt. We also sprinkled on garlic and parmesan

I added thinly sliced roma tomatos and fresh basil. Perhaps the best pizza we've ever eaten. Astonishingly delicious!

I read reviews about people roasting the vegies first and I was considering it. Then I read a recipe for fennel salad that suggested using a mandoline to get the fennel very thinly sliced. Ah-ha I said. That is what I will do for the pizza. Perfect! The vegies where cooked through but still light and fresh. Very yummy pizza. Will make again.

I needed to use up zucchini and fennel- and came across this. I modified it by using whatever was left in the fridge (turnips/greens) and followed the advice of roasting in oven 40 min prior to putting on pizza. I used asiago/parmesan cheese in place of mozz- then basil/feta cheese to top it off. Had whole wheat pizza crust in freezer- perfect taste combo.

This is an amazing recipe with a few simple tweeks. I don't like fennel, so I left that off. I added a little sprinkle of crumbled gorgonzola, with Fresh mozzarella. It makes a big difference. Also Fresh tarragon is an imperative it gives the pizza an unexpected depth that is ohhhh so amazing.

I made this pizza last night with the following changes based on previous reviews: I used a pizza crust from my local grocery store (Wegmans), roasted the fennel, zucchini and shallots for 40 minutes (did not use the yellow squash), used fresh mozzarella which I thinly sliced, deleted the brie and threw a few sun-dried tomatoes on top. DELICIOUS!!

Yummy and easy! I made one large pizza. The flavor is wonderful. Can't wait to eat the left-overs for lunch.

This is a very good spring recipe when tarragon is in season, the fresh spice being much preferred to its dry equivalent. As usual, I made this first by the book (although with a homemade pizza dough), and then a second time with some modification. Concerning the cheeses,I recommend fresh mozzarella (di bufala), which imparts a wonderful flavor. I used a triple-cream brie in both instances, although certainly one could diversify considerably. Regarding the brie, its best to first place it in the fridge to cool as warm brie can be difficult to cut into pieces. Concerning the cooking instructions, this may be due to using a homemade pizza dough, but I highly recommend baking the crust for several minutes (with the thin layer of olive oil)prior to adding the ingredients. I also first roasted the vegetables with olive oil, which I preferred to the original recipe. If one enjoys their vegetables on the crunchy/crisp side, then make no modification from the original. Enjoy!

We really enjoyed the recipe. I don't like fennel so I left it off, also used blue brie (Saga) for additional flavor!

TO THE COOK IN VENICE CA: Note the Title, PIZZA BIANCA.. White Pizza.. SAUCELESS pizza. The pizza wasnt missing depth from the lack of sauce.. it was MENT to be that way.. the lack of depth in my opinion comes from the choice in the cheese

Turns out fennel is pretty inspired as a pizza topping. I used robiola instead of brie and that was delicious. The recipe doesn't mention seasoning but you definitely will need to. I also smeared a teaspoon or 2 of imported tomato paste on the crust, which added some needed depth to the flavor.

Made this with my own pizza dough and feta instead of brie, turned out fine.

For what it's worth, Trader Joe's has a very passable refrigerated pizza dough (both white and whole wheat, although the white is a bit more tender). If you have a bread machine, though, it's hardly worth buying dough.

Although "making your own pizza dough (if done properly, starting the night before to let flavors develop) is a bit of a chore," as a previous reviewer said, making your own pizza dough on the quick is quite easy. I normally make a very simple flour, water, salt and olive oil dough (from the Wms-Sonoma pizza cookbook, but there are plenty of similar recipes). I knead it and use it immediately on a pizza stone, without even letting it rise - the disadvantage to that is that I believe it puffs a bit more than it would if it had risen and been knocked down, but I don't find that a problem so long as I don't load the dough up too heavily. It's definitely better than dough from cans, anyway.

when I am too busy to make pizza dough by myself, I use the no-pocket pita bread from Costco. It gives quite decent result. Of course, it is not as good as home made dough but provides a quick and easy way out.

Making your own pizza dough (if done properly, starting the night before to let flavors develop) is a bit of a chore. If you don't have time to make your own in lieu of the "tubed" dough, you might try buying uncooked pizza dough from a neighborhood pizzareia. Most will sell it to you.

I tried this with Pillsbury pizza dough,as directed, and found the dough was so awful it really impacted my ability to enjoy the rest of the dish. My fault really, I knew the dough would not be good. I found the dough had a distinctly sweet flavor which I did not care for at all. When I looked at the tube wrapper later I found it had a high sugar content. The toppings however, were great and I am looking forward to trying this again with homemade dough. I also think grilling the pizza will add to the flavor, and I am going to try the additions suggested by an earlier reviewer, (artichokes, sundried tomato).

I loved this - the fresh tarragon add a unique taste to vegetable pizza. I also added some fresh sliced baby portabella mushrooms. I would recommend slicing the brie very thin, big chucnks get a little too greasy tasting for me.

This dish is great, but I practiced it later with a few changes. If you substitute fresh basil for the tarragon it's great and I added fresh mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and artichoke hearts (marinated). add some fresh ground black pepper and OMG!!! Fabulous!!
