I wish I read the previous reviews before making. This recipe was very bland though I did add a few extra spices. I love the simple ingredients, which I always have on hand. I will probably try this recipe again, but using a few of the other reviewers suggestions like adding broth and garlic.

I'm making this for the second time this evening. The first time I prepared this, I made some changes, which I'll repeat tonight. First thing, I cooked several slices of bacon, removed them and cut into 1/2 inch pieces, and set aside. I sauteed the onion and thyme along with the carrot in the bacon grease, together with a little olive oil. It's important to cook the onions until they begin to caramelize, this is what gives this dish its sublime flavor. Add the pieces of bacon to the pasta and lentils just before serving. Be sure to use French lentils, preferably LePuy, other lentils will lose their shape and flavor as they cook, and not contribute much to the dish, which will indeed taste rather bland.

I did as many suggested and added bouillon cubes (I doubled the recipe, so I added two) and my family and I found this dish to be delicious. I did add two grated zucchinis. Reminded me of a dish my grandmother made with lentils and pasta. Very flavorful and tasty.

Pretty tasty, it was quick and I always seem to have these ingredients on hand.

This is a very satisfying dish. I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and threw a few red pepper flakes into the cooking water. I also added a chicken bouillion cube. I will make this dish again!

Absolutely delicious. I doubled the recipe for 4 of us, used tiny french blue lentils, a bouillon cube in the water for cooking the lentils, added a chopped turnip and two chopped carrots, and used whole wheat pasta. My 8 year old son cleaned his plate. Scrumptious comfort food.

This was ok. Kind of bland even with Cayenne and garlic. It needs more sauce substance like a bit of a cream sauce mixed in with lentils and carrots.

I love this recipe--very easy, and the thyme gives the lentils a great flavor. I also add some cayenne to give it some kick, and sometimes I'll also throw in a clove of garlic.

Great dish and easy to make. I use whole wheat pasta to pump up the nutritional value.

This was great! I followed the suggestions of others and cooked the lentils in broth, and added some red chilis. I served it with a greek salad and kalamata olives go really well with it. i'd definitely make it again.

A lovely simple meal. I've made it twice now and I agree with cooking the lentils in broth. I made it with whole wheat pasta which went along with the other ingredients quite nicely.

I forgot to buy a fresh carrot, so ended up using sliced canned carrots, but it still turned out OK. My husband is a picky eater, but he gobbled it up. I definitely agree with the "earthy" description -- in a good way.

I would boil the lentils in broth to ad some spice and some red pepper. But overall a great dinner for a hot summer evening. very good and healthy.

For a simple dish this involved many more steps than I would have liked. But the end result was quite delicious, a humble earthy dish. Followed recipe, but added some red pepper flakes to lentil water, and garlic to the onions.

An easy, tasty recipe. I cooked the lentils in chicken stock, added some cherry tomatoes and garlic, and drizzled some flavoured olive oil over the lentils before tossing them with the pasta. I'll definitely make this again.

A tasty, bland background. Next time I'll add garlic. The cayenne pepper was a good idea. Can also imagine adding small pieces of roasted butternut squash. Am adding this to my "light supper" category.

I was hesitant to even try this recipe - I love pasta and lentils separate, but together?? Surprisingly this dish turned out very well. The cayenne I added is essential, a very healthy and balanced meal.

I did a little adding and subtracting with this recipe -- I didn't have the parsley so I left that out -- but I did have and I would suggest adding a spoonful of miso paste to the lentils as they cook -- it adds a richness -- and as a garnish I added some currants and walnuts -- Next time I think I might throw in a little cayenne for heat. All in all, comfort food that I'd make again.

This is one of my girlfriend's absolute favorite things to eat. I like to make it with gemelli or bowties.

This is one of the things I make for myself when my husband is not eating with me. I love it! I have been making it since it first appeared in Gourmet and it is one of my comfort foods.
