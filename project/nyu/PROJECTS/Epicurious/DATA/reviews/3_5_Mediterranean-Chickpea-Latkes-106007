WHY ARE THESE CALLED LATKES!!!??? I'm surprised no one on the editorial staff at BA requested the name of the recipe be changed both out of respect for Jewish cultural traditions and for the sake of accuracy. They're fritters. Moreover, if they're supposed to adhere to Mediterranean tradition, they should be made with chickpea flour, not cooked chickpeas.

This wasn't exactly what I was looking for. A bit too much like a fluffy pancake rather than a rustic latka. I wanted something to showcase pomegranate seeds. But, a litttle plain yogurt with the seeds on these latkas were OK.

I love this recipe,try using a 1oz. ladle when making. Serve warm with a small dollop of creme fraiche topped with smoked salmon as an appetizer.

I didn't like this recipe at all. Was expecting a lot based on the other reviews, but they came out greasy and fell apart easily. Not worth even the minimal effort that is required.

I'm printing several copies of this recipe to give to friends. It was the hands-down hit at our Christmas dinner. Thank you!

I followed New Rochelle's suggestions and had very good results. These were light, fluffy, and delicious right out of the pan - then after sitting on a hot tray for awhile they settled down, firmed up, and became more falafel-ish. I would make again only if I could serve immediately after cooking.

These are delicious. I found that if I cut the olive oil in half and the salt in half, and used 5 instead of 6 T of water that they were better-- firmer, less greasy. You barely need any oil to cook them in a non stick pan. And they are still just great for hanukkah or anytime.

This recipe was a big hit when I served it at a Hannukah dinner. One diner thought it tasted a lot like Indian samosas, and I agree. Did not use pomegranate seeds, did use sour cream to top them. My one problem was knowing how long to cook them. I was afraid to overcook the latkes, since the beans were already cooked, so I ended up under-cooking them the second time I made them.

just simply fantastic little latkes - and a huge hit at my latke party! i served them with pomegranate seeds and the mint-yogurt sauce and they were just so wonderful!

These are delicious and a snap to make! My only complaint is that they are a little too salty. Next time I make them, I'm going to cut down on the salt.
