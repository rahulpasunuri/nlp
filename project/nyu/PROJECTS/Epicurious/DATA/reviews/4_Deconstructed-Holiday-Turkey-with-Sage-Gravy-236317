I have to agree with all the other reviews on here. I made this last night for a huge dinner and everything was just fantastic. I think I'll do all my turkeys this way from here on out.

Outstanding! Brined a boneless turkey breast and followed the brining recipe exactly. One of the best turkeys that I've ever made - crisp skin, moist, tender meat and all with so little effort. And the gravy -- possibly the best I've ever made. Added a few fresh thyme sprigs to the broth, and the flavor was divine.

Used only breast for a small group.The brining is especially important for the breast, which would otherwise turn out dry. I brined it for about 24 hours. The essential brine ingredient is the kosher salt. The other ingredients can be adjusted, or even eliminated, according to availability. (I didn't have celery.)For the gravy, I simply added flour to the pan drippings in the roasting pan, stirred over the heat for a couple of minutes, then added broth, simmered a bit longer, and seasoned. Delicious.

This was the best turkey I have EVER made. (and according to my husband, the best he's ever eaten). I did a whole bird, 20lbs, soaked it all day and overnight. Definately not too salty on the meat and the meat had a fabulous flavor. Nothing overpowers and all enhances the meat itself. In fact, I found it the best slicing turkey I have ever done because the meat was so perfectly moist. I didn't do the gravy but used the juice to make my own. Expect to cut it with some water because there is definately salt there. It was some of the best gravy I've had. I can't wait to try this on a smaller bird or even a chicken just to see how it does. Kudos to Ted Allen. This was awesome!

Delicious. Even despite the fact that I overcooked it--I got a 2 lb breast (there were only two of us to feed) and should have been a little more mindful about monitoring the temp. Oh well, it was still great, and we're still enjoying the leftovers. Equally important was how ridiculously easy it was... this was the least stressful Thanksgiving meal I've prepared, thanks in large part to this turkey prep. I made only half of the brine, and everything fit in a 1-gallon ziplock. Instead of a roasting pan, I used my dutch oven with a bed of celery stalks to raise the turkey off the bottom. Worked beautifully! This is my go-to turkey recipe from here on out.

We hardly even had to chew this it was so tender and juicy! Fabulous recipe! I had to do a timed bake on it so I dropped it to 325 for about 3 hours and I did a whole turkey instead.

Winner-Winner Turkey dinner!!! Our guests raved about the flavor. It was very moist and easy to cook. The mead was perfectly golden and evenly cooked. I can not imagine cooking a whole turkey again.

Thanksgiving was just my husband and I so I used this on recipe on just a bone-in Turkey breast. I over cooked it -admittedly my own fault - but if I had taken it out 15 min sooner it would have been perfectly moist. The brine was easier than I thought and well worth it. Next time I will cut back on the honey and use extra herbs and bay leaves in the brine. The flavor really comes out in the meat.

I made this with three 3 lb turkey breasts, otherwise made it exactly as written and it was fantastic! So juicy and tasty. Fresh herbs are a must. The gravy was super delicious and I will make it again but the sage flavor from the turkey gets lost. Next time I'm going to try putting a sprig of sage in with the simmering chicken broth for a few minutes and remove it before I add in the liquid and see if that makes a difference. So yummy, I can't wait to make it again!

I made this recipe for my adult English as a Second Language class and it was a huge hit! They had never had stuffing/turkey/gravy before and all thought it was fantastic! I did the brine, but only for 1.5 hours, and it was yummy. The innermost meat was not as "seasoned" because I cut down on time, so I can only imagine it would have been all the better if I brined for the full time. This was my first turkey cooking experience and it was flawless and easy!

This gravy was the best damn gravy I have ever eaten. True confession: I ended up eating some by itself, with a spoon. The turkey was a little dry but I blame my oven.

The turkey was delicious. It was very moist and had great flavor. The skin also got reasonably crispy. I would definitely make this recipe again.

We brined for 24 hours; the flavour it imparted was lovely, a perfect complement to the turkey. I will certainly make this again. :-)

Absolutely fabulous recipe for a small group. Incredibly moist turkey breast. I will never cook a whole turkey again.

This is positively the best turkey I've ever tasted. I've made it twice, once at Thanksgiving and once today, following the recipe almost to the letter. I used dried thyme instead of fresh, but ALWAYS fresh sage...so worth it!!! Now I dream of turkey instead of dutifully roasting it once yearly. I brine mine for 24 hours. The skin is irresistibly browned, crispy and flavorful, and even the breast meat is juicy and tender!

Loved this! It came out just as directed. I did not brine due to low salt diet restrictions at my house. The turkey was still moist and gorgeous. This was a great way to do turkey for a smaller group. I will definitely do this again.

I'm usually pretty indifferent about turkey, but this was so moist and delicious. I brined for almost 24 hours, and stuffed some thyme and sage into the cavity before baking. The turkey and the gravy were both wonderful.

I bought a 25 pound fresh bird.....cut it up and brined it for 24 hours. ...all 8 guests agreed it was the best turkey they had ever eaten. I took wing tips, and bones to make a broth. Due to a time situation I had to do the turkey on Wednesday. When it was done I cooled it over night and sliced it the next morning. Used some of the broth to lay a base for the cut slices, then topped with more of the broth and still enough to make the best gravy, ever. I heated the sliced turkey in the broth to just hot! Everyone said it was the best turkey they had ever eaten. I will never do a whole bird again. I had completely cooked the parts in 1 hour and 25 minutes at the recommended temps. The guests raved! The smaller pieces of dark meat were done in about 1 hour and 10 minutes. The meat was moist, tender abd juicy.

I made this last night for my "trial run" Thanksgiving to rave reviews. One guest even mentioned it was the most "perfect" turkey they ever tried. I made a whole 22 pound bird and doubled the brining recipe to accommodate for submerging the massive bird into a food-grade plastic bucket for two days. Absolutely wonderful flavor and the dressing turned out fantastic too, even though before I had a chance to attempt to make it in the turkey pan my "helpful" husband dumped a bunch of water in the original pan. I simply used the drippings (which he poured out before dumping the water into the pan) and whisked in a flour & water mix & boiled to thicken. This is my turkey of choice from here on out!

This was fantastic! I only made it with the turkey breast on the bone and it was quite a bit of meat for a small family gathering. The brine was very nice and fit into a large ziploc bag. I got a crispy skin by drying thoroughly, not adding the additional water called for, just using butter, roasting it in a roasting pan (uncovered) at 425 for 30 minutes, basting every 10 minutes. Then, reduced heat to 350 and covered for about 1 1/2 hours, basting several times. Wonderful!

I made this recipe last Thanksgiving and everyone thought it was the best turkey they had ever eaten! I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make it again this Thanksgiving. The turkey was flavorful and moist - not salty at all. This recipe is a keeper!

I hadn't brined a turkey before and was looking for a good recipe for Christmas. Used a whole turkey but followed the brine recipe. It was fantastic! My Dad said it was the very best turkey he had ever tasted. I agree. You can stick the whole thing in one of those roasting bags with the liquid. Set in a bucket outdoors (if it is winter time and cold enough in your climate - but not too cold, and you can protect it from critters who might enjoy a holiday treat). It works miracles. We usually get a nice organic free range turkey for T- day. This was a de-frosted free turkey from the suppermarket. If your family likes the turkey skin, I understand that brining makes it difficult to get that crispy skin. However, if you really plan ahead, you can defrost, brine, and then let your turkey dry for a day uncovered in the fridge, and roast and get a nice crispy skin. Definitely try it.

this is fantastic. We have made this 3 times now, twice with the brine and a whole turkey, once "deconstructed". Either way it is great. I don't know why but it does not taste salty, and I don't like salty food. It is fantastic with the cornbread stuffing a well.

While I don't believe this recipe is unique, brining your turkey adds so much flavor to an otherwise bland bird. Very good recipe, would make it again.

I only used a turkey breast roast but it was the best turkey I've ever made. It was very tender, juicy and flavorful, I'm sure because of the brining. My first ever attempt at gravy was a huge success as well. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I only made a half breast for a small thanksgiving get together, but it was wonderful, and easy to get right (my first turkey!)

Here is an answer to the sodium question. The first turkey I brined, I thought was too salty, so every time I brine now, I knock back the salt to as much a half of what the recipe calls for, or if I use regular stock (opposed to a low sodium stock) to make the brine, I don't add any salt at all. Kick up your other flavors and it will be great. I know this response comes a few days late, but I hope it helps for the future. All the best!!

Used this brine on an 11-lb. whole turkey - first time I've ever brined so stuck witht he recipe. Marinated ovenight, turning once. Secured turkey to rotisserie and roasted on grill at approximately 350 for about 3 hrs., basting with drippings and butter, and allowing the garlic to roast in the drip pan for the gravy. Succulent bird! Skin became a little dark, but did not affect the flavor at all. Would definitely use this brine, or a variation of it, again.

This is not a review (yet) but rather a question. I am planning on making this turkey for thanksgiving in a few days, and was wondering: does the brining method make the turkey taste very salty? And does it increase the sodium content level to ridiculous amounts? (My mother is trying to watch her sodium intake). I am sort of unclear as to whether this method simply uses the salt to make the turkey really moist or if the salt actually gets "absorbed" into the turkey to make it taste salty. Will return with a review once I've made it.

This turkey was delicious, and so easy. I'm a novice cook. Worse than novice; and this was a low-stress, simple way to make turkey. The breast was good, but the dark meat was fantastic.

This was the best turkey ever. I used the brine but still cooked the turkey whole, I guess just because we always have.... The brine was fabulous! I also barbequed the turkey using smoke chips which gave it an incredible flavour. I can't wait to make it again.

Wow, I have never been so relaxed serving turkey for dinner. It comes out looking great and the brine does make the turkey tasty and moist.

My days of cooking a whole turkey are over! 'Tho I didn't see Ted's version until today, I can certainly vouch for the efficiency and ease of cooking the 'deconstructed' bird. After all, who ever sees the whole bird at table unless its a Norman Rockwell painting. Boning the breast, legs and thighs after brining allows you to make your broth from those brined bones before hand and slicing the parts is a breeze! Makes serving a large crowd [I had 17!!] quick...very quick. I especially liked the 1 1/2 hour time frame. So cudos to Ted et al for making this a great entertaining feast.

I used this recipe to make a roast turkey breast for a small Christmas for just my husband and I this year. I just followed the directions and brined a turkey breast overnight in the fridge then roasted it off the next day. The turkey came out just perfect, it was very moist and had great flavor. My husband loved it (I even got compliments on the turkey leftovers the next day, hehe.) I can't comment on the gravy, since I didn't make that part of it - but I would imagine it would have turned out just fine too, (there were a lot of yummy looking drippings left in the pan following the roasting process.) This is an awesome recipe; it's easy to follow and gives great results! Since the whole brining process was so easy, I'm seriously considering making roast turkey more often now throughout the year - Ted's recipe makes the whole process fun and rewarding :D Highly Recommended!

I used just a turkey breast, brined overnight, and it came out great. I didn't have fresh sage, so used dried. I also didn't have whole peppercorns and allspice, so used ground versions instead. It still came out yummy, not dry at all. I also realized I didn't have chicken broth or stock to make the gravy with, and used water instead. Still came out good. Next time I will use the chicken stock; it will probably be even better. Served with mashed potatoes, sauteed green and wax beans, and whole-berry cranberry sauce. A great meal I'll make again.

This recipe is great!! It was easier than buying a whole turkey. The turkey was so moist and tasty. I got compliments from everyone at the Thanksgiving Day table, including my 23 year old nephew who never comments on anything, and who said more than once that "this is the best turkey I ever ate."

I'll never make a whole turkey again. After brining, both white and brown meats succulent. I too used the convention-roasting feature of my oven, and the turkey cooked more rapidly. Brown skin, moist meat. I served eight and had lots of leftovers. The turkey was on the large side, about 20 lbs. Next time I'll get a 12-15 lb. turkey, have the breast split for easier brining, and use only the thighs and drumsticks that come with the bird. Using the wings in making the broth certainly made it rich, and no one likes to eat wings anyway.

Made this for the first time on Thanksgiving this year. Absolutely delicious, and I will never make another "whole" turkey again. Guests who said they usually only took a piece of turkey to be polite asked for seconds. I brined for about 15 hours. Don't skip this step. help with the two-pan issue, I also used a convection oven, and placed all turkey parts onto racks within the roasting pan. This lowered the cooking time, so I had to keep a close eye on it to make sure it didn't over cook. Crispy skin and juicy delicious meat.

PERFECT! what a great way to make a Thanksgiving turkey! I had the butcher cut up a fresh turkey and added an extra breast. The presentation was beautiful and ready to serve. Brining, (which i had always been afraid of because of the big turkey, etc) was easy and a must for a juicy breast. I will ALWAYS make the turkey this way. I'll admit my guests thought i was a bit crazy but enjoyed it spite of themselves. I made the gravy with the sage gravy recipe from here... also perfect.

INSANELY delicious! I roasted three turkey breasts for a group of 30 guests, omitting the drumsticks, etc. The brining is easy (I used super sized Ziploc bags and set them inside the disposable aluminum roasting pans as they do tend to leak.) This is the most flavorful, moist turkey we have ever had. Even the leftovers make better sandwiches!

This was an extremely simple recipe, and recieved rave reviews. I did not have celery leaves and used cilantro- no problem. I also roasted the turkey with the garlic on top of it, and used the garlic in the sauce. Surprisingly, it was not overpowering. I highly recommend.

This is the first time I brined a turkey, and I will always do it in the future. It really makes the meat moist and takes very little effort. I made 2 turkey breasts and 3 drumsticks. If you make more than one turkey breast increase the amount of roasting time - - - mine took 2 hours total. The drumsticks take much less time than the turkey breasts - - about 1 hour.

This was so tender and juicy. The only modification was that I stuffed the breast with Duxelles. Double the recipe if you are making for more than four or five so that you have leftovers. I will forever brine turkey!

I have never had turkey SO TENDER, so downright juicy as this. This was no dry, turkey!! The brining brought so much flavor - something I had never attempted before. And then I roasted it and voila! Delicious! Plus, my husband, who is our gravy afficianado -- and let's me know it - LOVED the gravy and said it was better than his. AMAZING! And to further prove the worth of this recipe, it was devoured by 6 year old twins and an 8 year old without complaint. Thanks so much, Ted, for sharing this wonderful recipe with us.
