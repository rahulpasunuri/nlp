Very good flavor on the chicken thanks to the combo of yogurt sauce and herbs under the skin. While I am a lover of garlic, the two cloves verged on being overwhelming. Next time, will make the recipe with one large clove. Also, I added some minced fresh rosemary I had on hand from another recipe earlier in the week(Rosemary Lamb Chops from Epicurious- you gotta try this one too!). SO glad I added it! Made it even more "Greek" in flavor profile. Used poached thighs instead of chicken breast (sorry- not a fan). The chicken turned out well, and the poaching in advance also helps keep the chef from serving under cooked grilled chicken. Will make this again.

This recipe was amazing. Simple, yummy. One note: add a lot more lemon, garlic, and oregano than it asks for. I found the sauce pretty bland until i added more of those three items (especially lemon). Other than that, delicious.

I don't like to rate recipes '4' unless they are extraordinary, however, I couldn't bear giving this one just 3. I would say, it is at least 3.5. So simple and delicious. I used fresh oregano instead of dried, and sliced pockets into boneless skinless breasts. The yogurt is fantastic. I served it with lentils and brocoli, both with simply lemon juice, olive oil, salt and lemon pepper. Ate with warmed pita bread. Delicious.

I also skipped the sauce and used the boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I let it marinate about 30 minutes then grilled. Great flavor. Serviced it over spinach (just let spinach wilt with heat from chicken), grape tomatoes, feta cheese, and a homemade oil/vineger dressing. Couscous on the side. We'll see how it all works when I try it cold for lunch today!

took others advice - used boneless/skinless and skipped yogurt sauce. added 1 T fresh rosemary and let chicken marinate with other ingredients about 3 hours - excellent summer meal with greek salad

We really enjoyed this nice, light dish. I used boneless, skinless chicken, but otherwise followed the recipe. SErved with grilled assorted peppers and onions and parmesan polenta. The yogurt sauce was nice too. I will most definitely make this dish again, soon! Sooooo easy too!

This just plain didn't taste good. the yogurt didn't help either. Disappointing recipe.

Love this recipe but skipped the yogurt so that my chicken would come out crispier on the outside, especially if you broil it for the last 4 minutes at 500F. Great flavor and I always use this as a base recipe (minus the yogurt) for all chicken dishes... it works great with making a chicken salad mix.

I love this recipe and followed it exactly. The sauce was great, but not really necessary.

Chicken was rather dry and tasteless. Didn't like the flavor of the yogurt sauce at all! Disappointing recipe.

I would never make this recipe again. Very disappointed. Tasted like a bunch of spices just thrown on top of the chicken. Not a good combination. The sauce was definitely nothing special. I was surprised that it got such a high rating from other reviewers. I will definitely delete this from my recipe box!

Terrific! I modified slightly and used boneless breasts. I rolled the chicken in the herb mixture (so make a little extra for the yogurt) and then sauted in pan on stove. Next time I might serve with some warmed pita as well. Delicious.

I made this with boneless skinless chicken breasts and baked them covered in foil in the oven. Amazing! Tender, moist and full of flavor!

I made this dish for a Greek-themed dinner. It was a huge hit. My only comment is to use fresh oregano instead of dried. I've made it twice and i liked the flavor much better with fresh oregano. I wil definitely be making this again.

here's a twist: made the chicken and the sauce as described (using boneless skinless chicken breasts) but served it up on a bun with some grilled onions and sliced garden tomatoes. lemon-oregano grilled chicken sandwich. good summer meal with corn on the cob.

Made this last night with boneless chicken breasts and grilled it for 15 min. Delicious! I loved the yogurt sauce, but my husband did not care for it. Doesn't matter since the chicken is moist and flavorful without sauce. Definitely a winner.

I've made this recipe again and again - it's one of my top 20. Delicious blend of herbs and flavors. I use extra lemon juice in the yogurt and use skinless/boneless breasts. I marinate chicken in herb mixture w/olive oil and grill to perfection. Serve w/orzo mixed with grilled veggies, feta cheese, and homemade marinated olives. Yum! Guests have always enjoyed.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and marinated them in the yogurt, garlic, extra lemon and even used a good handful of fresh oregano, with a little white wine. Still turned out pretty bland. However, we added peach chutney at the last minute on the grill and let the chicken get glazed and crisp. Yum!!! Somehow, this totally took this dish to a new level. Served this with a lemon basil potato salad and baby romaine with caesar dressing. Great summer meal.

Didn't like this chicken at all. It was bland to say the least, and tasted like a bunch of herbs piled on chicken - yuck! The flavours of the lemon and oregano didn't get into the chicken at all - not at all impressed with this recipe, there are a lot better recipes out there - keep looking!

This was a good, basic recipe, but not something so special that it rises to the top 10 list. I added more lemon juice to the sauce, until the lemon flavor was obvious--probably double the called for amount.

Yum. I too marinated skinless chicken breasts in the paste and oil for a couple of hours and then grilled. I forgot the oregano, but it was still good. The lemon zest is so much better than just lemon juice. This was good with Couscous a la Greque (I grilled the vegetables instead of sauteeing them).

Very flavorful and easy to make. It was great on the grill.

I used 2 tablespoons fresh oregano instead of dried, and omitted the parsley, then rubbed the paste under the breast of a whole roasting chicken. Delicious served with bulgur-couscous pilaf from this site. Will definitely make this again!

A great tasting way to make chicken breast that is so simple that one wouldn't think twice about making it after a long day at work...but dressed up properly, wouldn't think twice about making it for guests. Can't go wrong with something this tasty and simple.

i found this recipe to be utterly delicious! i was scared of the yogurt sauce at first, but found it to be an excellent addition to the chicken...i did add a touch more lemon to the yogurt sauce for personal flavor, and somehow ended up with a enough rub to put under the skins of three big chicken breasts, but it worked out very well....

Very good, but didn't knock my socks off. I doubled the recipe and ran out of fresh parsley and sub'd dried. My guests finished every bit of it though!!

Last night I found out why this recipe received such rave reviews. Wow!! The yogurt sauce really made it. I used boneless/skinless chicken breast and served it with rosemary orzo, roasted peppers and greek salad. Very yummy!

I made this for my saturday nite at the movies day and my boyfriend loved it!!! I used a little cumin and garlic with the orzo pasta and peppers. I plan on making for my first dinner guests at my new apartment!

This is a great recipe! Just the right ratio of lemon to garlic. I first fried some onions and capers and then put the chicken breasts on top of them to cook. My husband LOVED it. Very tasty! I will definitely make this again.

Excellent mix of oregano and lemon flavors. I've eaten in Greek restaurants in Germany, although most of their menus were made with pork, lamb or beef, this would rate right up there with the foods they had to offer--people came from all over Germany to eat in the restaurant we frequented most.

Made this chicken for a Seder dinner. Everyone really enjoyed it and some people asked for the recipe. I followed the preparation suggestion from Sharon Miller.

Served this to guests to rave reviews. Used skinless, boneless breasts. Used the spice mixture and olive oil as a marinade. Served it with orzo with chopped peppers and a greek salad.

I've made this for a crowd of hungry men who raved. You can even make it with boned breasts and treat the herb mixture like a stuffing and roll the breast and seal it with a toothpick prior to broiling. Find the greek orzo salad with peppers, olives and feta, and that's all you need for a great easy summer dinner.
