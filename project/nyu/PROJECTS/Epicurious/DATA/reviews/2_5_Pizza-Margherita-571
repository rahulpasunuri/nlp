OK, remember this recipe was originally published in "30 Minute Main Courses" section. It's not pizza from scratch!! I have found over the years that this is a quick, easy and yes, even delicious pizza! Use this recipe as a base and adjust it to make it your own. If you don't like the idea of canned tomatoes, dice up some fresh plum tonmatoes, add fresh basil, oregano and garlic - that's what I do. I have served this to company and I never fail to get rave reviews on it! Experiment - add olives or artichokes. It's a winner every time.

This "recipe" is an insult to the grand people of Italy! Canned tomatoes! Dried basil (yuk!) Packaged dough! Need I go on........ Call it something else. Better yet, take it off this site. There is nothing so good in the world as the real thing...

Just another fast-food, prepackaged pizza. I make pizza for a living and I am married to a Sicilian. This not anywhere near what an authentic Margherita Pizza resembles. Also when using fresh Mozzarella with a Neopolitan pizza dough the oven should be set at least to 500+ degrees, preferrably close to 700 degrees.

I thought I was the only one being a stickler on the name! Being a former resident of the country that resembles a boot, I was too was surprised that such a large error would be made. Indeed Pizza Margherita is made up of the colors of the flag (tomato, mozzarella and basil only) and named after Queen Margherita herself. It also originated in Naples.

First of all, Pizza Margherita is made to resemble the Italian flag. It should be made with a fresh tomato sauce, mozzerella, bocconcini and fresh basil placed on pizza after cooking it. I just came back from Italy and believe me, every single restaurant makes it this way.

The pizza simply should've been called something else. It is no more a pizza margherita than it is a frozen margarita. It is also not worth wasting good prosciutto on it if dried herbs and "regular" pizza mozarella and "pre-fabbed" dough are being used. Might as well use pepperoni. I did get the idea from this recipe for a prosciutto, fresh oregano, tomato, and fresh mozzarella pizza that was very good. I think oregano works better with prosciutto. Put the meat on after the pizza comes out of the oven.

Found out the hard way that you cannot use fresh moz. cheese. It makes it too watery. I also realized that one tube of pizza dough is not enough. I will make this recipe again but with a few modifications.

I thought it was a very good recipe although I would leave out the prociutto. It made the dish too salty. I think I drank more water afterwards than the amount of pizza I ate!!!

Gotta agree here-- you might as well go get a Chef Boyardee pizza mix as make this recipe. Good pizza margherita is on a homemade neopolitan crust (flour, yeast, water and about 3 hours.) Also, FRESH basil, please-- it must be torn and sprinkled over the pie as it comes out of the oven-- the heat from the pizza will wilt it and release its fragrance. If you can't get fresh basil, use dried oregano. It's a far more acceptable substitute. And no meat.

Fabulously easy and delicious recipe. The simple flavors work well together and the convenience products make this a snap to throw together after work. Your guests won't believe how simple the recipe really is.

Alright, I'm getting out the big guns here - sorry - First of all "la pizza margherita" does not have prosciutto on it. If you add anything else besides mozz. and tomato, it becomes something different. If you desire to add prosciuto to your pizza, it should be done at cooking's end, or not be cooked at all (the heat of the pizza will warm it enough). Prosciutto crudo (raw) is a prized delicacy, and there is no reason to turn it into prosciutto cotto (cooked). May I also suggest the addition of rucola to the prosciutto? Why use pre-prepared dough? - all you need is some UNBLEACHED flour, yeast, water, olive oil, and elbow grease. Bake the pizza on unglazed quarry tiles (about $2 at Lowe's, Home Depot) at 400 degrees (F). Do NOT cut it into squares (this is a PIZZA, not a SFINCIONE)- indiviual pies (plate sized) are preferred. And you forgot to mention the wine -San Giovese, Chianti, Merlot, Cabarnet,Barbera, Barolo....
