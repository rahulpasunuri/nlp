Very good. Used 2.5lbs chicken thighs, 3peppers (could have added another or two to have lots of veggies), substituted Italian Seasoning for oregano, and was generous with the capers. If you like full flavours, this is a good one.

Ick! Try Chicken Breasts with Tomatoes & Capers (on this website) for a much better recipe.
