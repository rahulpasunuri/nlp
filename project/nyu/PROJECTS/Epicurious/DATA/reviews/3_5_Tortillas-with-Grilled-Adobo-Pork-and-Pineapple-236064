Not worth the work; I'd rather just make pulled pork.

Very very tasty. Any recipe that involves grilling a pineapple is off to a good start with me! Like others, I took some shortcuts. Buying tortillas instead of making them was a no-brainer. I did make the tomatillo sauce as specified, and I'm glad I did. It wasn't that hard, and it turned out really well. I cheated on the adobo sauce, though. Just bought a couple cans of peppers in adobo sauce and de-seeded the peppers. Voila.

Loved this recipe! Its complex flavors of spices and the layers of flavors were great. The only two things I skipped were the chive oil and I used store bought tortillas. Although there is a bit of work involved the tomatillo sauce can be done while the meat is marinating in the adobo sauce. I will make this again very soon.

Sure, the tastes were good, but endurance is a major factor in completing this overly complicated recipe. Forget the adobo sauce, it just wasn't worth the effort! After making all the component parts of this meal, the handmade tortillas recipe was over the top. The best parts were the pineapple salsa and the tomatillo sauce; I may borrow these for future reference, and leave the rest behind.

I started this recipe in November of 2006. I still haven't finished.

We did not make the tortillas or tomatillo sauce (the former, we bought at the store; the latter, a friend had given us already from his own recipe), but the pork and adobo were excellent. I have been looking for a recipe like this to make pork and pineapple tacos for a long time, and this definitely hit the spot!
