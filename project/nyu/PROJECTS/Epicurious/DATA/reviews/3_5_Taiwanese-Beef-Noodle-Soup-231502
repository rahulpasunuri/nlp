Ok, I had a Taiwanese buddy introduce this to me in grad school. Been making it EVER since. This is pretty spot on, from what I know (I'm an "honorary asian" white boy). I'll tell you what, I don't differ too much from the recipe. It's spot on from my meager experience. I have a ranch99 around the corner, so I have the luxury of most ingredients, but here's my 2 bits... I don't worry about the mung beans, or mustard greens, although the better 1/2 likes 'em (she's Chinese). I drop the 4 anise to 3 (it's powerful enough) and cook it in a dutch oven a good 3 hours. My buddy says the traditional way is in a clay pot, low and slow for hours. The only other thing he adds (and I do), is four tomatoes (quartered) a 1/2 hour from done. Adds a nice touch. Oh, one other thing. Definitely try this with a good pound of Oxtails. You'll NEVER look back. GREAT RECIPE. It's one of our favs for life!!!

Delicious, satisfying. I used 1/4 cup soy sauce, no wine or sherry, onion instead of scallion, no cilantro (had none), and locally raised short ribs I'd cooked before (simmered a half hour total in this soup). Bucatini was a good substitute for the recommended noodles.

This is nothing like the noodle soups I've had in Taiwan, as some others have mentioned. The main problem is that the soy sauce overpowers everything else. I've found that Chinese recipes adapted by Americans tend to have this issue, and I hope someday that they realize there's more to Chinese cuisine than soy sauce. The flavors are so complex and so varied from Taiwanese to Hong Kong to Szechuan and back that drowning everything in soy sauce is a disservice and a shame. I was worried about the star anise being too strong as others have mentioned, but I couldn't taste it at all over the soy sauce. The next time I make this, I will only use a quarter cup, and light soy sauce as opposed to dark.

Oh, and I would only add 2 anise. The ones sold in the US are usually much bigger.

This recipe is good, but it's not as good or as authentic as it could be without the spice pack. The spice pack, which you can purchase at a Chinese grocery store (tell them that you're making niu rou mian) should have some Sichuan peppercorns and various other spices to give this a bit more of a kick. As is, it's a pretty good soup. But if you're looking for a recipe that matches what it should taste like in your memory, it falls a bit short.

After trying the hot and sour soup on this site I was greatly encouraged to try out another asian soup. This is a dish I grew up with in Taiwan. I have to say- it really hit the comfort food spot and was authentic enough to bring back to mind the memories of eating this wonderfully flavored soup at the Taiwanese noodle stands. My sister had suggested some additional ingredients that do not appear in the ingredient list. When I try a new batch, I'll post more information if it's worth including. Great stuff!!

tasty! i used organic, free range ribs. started it in a pot, then finished in slow cooker. substituted organic dried orange peels since the peels at the asian store were low quality. used sherry instead of rice wine & it wasn't too salty. added a bunch of bok choy. this is best made in advance; then the fat is a cinch to remove. needs a bit more heat, will increase red pepper flakes & add a bit of tabasco next time. might be nice with a bit of lime juice at the end too.

Substituted asian rock sugar for brown sugar, upped the ginger and garlic, and used a spice pack instead of the tangerine peel. Cut down the star anise to two since the spice pack also has it. Used 3/4 C dark soy sauce and increased water to 7 cups. Beef shank is a must! Delicious! Just like my Taiwanese Mom makes.

This recipe was VERY disappointing. Nothing like what I had in Taiwan. Note the following: star anise flavor was too strong and overpowered the whole dish.

Delicious. Ingredient modifications: left out the tangerine peel, used low-sodium soy sauce and chicken broth. I'd recommend tasting as you season so that you get the right amount of saltiness. I would also recommend spinach, baby bok choy, or napa cabbage over bean sprout. Also, there's nothing wrong with eating the tendon ;)

almost as good as my mom's homemade noodle soup. be careful with the star anise it might take you a few times to get the number right. my non-chinese friends didn't appreciate 4 whole stars. otherwise, the recipe was very easy to follow. i'm not much of a cook but this recipe turned out great!

this was a lot of worl for a blah soup. Star anise was a bit overwhelming, other than that, flavorless.

A fantastic recipes. Some tips: 1) Use dark soy sauce. If you are using generic supermarket soy sauce it will likely be too salty. The chinese cooking wine (if you are using that instead of sherry) is also salty. So you can start with 1/2 cup of dark soy sauce for making the soup, and then just add dark soy sauce to taste when the soup is done. 2) If you are going to skim the fat, boil the ribs first for an hour, chill, skim fat, and then add the herbs & spices. This adds significant cooking time (we chill overnight) but much of the flavour in the broth would otherwise be lost if tossed out with the fat. 3) With the exception of the bean sprouts & fresh cilantro, the soup itself freezes very well.

Delicious but too strong. I'm going to add chicken broth when I reheat the leftovers. I used shoyu sauce, which may have made it stronger. I think a cup of soy is way too much no matter what kind of soy sauce you're using.

I like eating this at restaurants a lot, so was really interested to try it at home. To the broth, I added 1/4 teaspoon of szechuan peppercorns. I skipped the bean sprouts, but gave each person two small bok choy and 2 leaves of napa, both quickly wilted in the broth (and the napa chopped up afterwards). I think it needs more red pepper in the meat/broth stage, wasn't hot enough, otherwise was good. Agree it was pretty salty. I used one package of short ribs and one package of end-cut shanks; loved the texture of the meat, and I included all the bits of tendon I could isolate. :-)

I "had a moment" after making this, because it's just like my mother made for me when I was a child. LOVE IT. Yes, it could be less salty.

My mom always made this but didn't use a recipe. Finally I can make it too! I used beef shank instead and cut into thin slices just like my mom's!

I made this dish two nights ago. It is simple to make, but kinda time consuming. Instead of using beef ribs, I used beef shank (which is the cut of meat that is usually served in the noodle soup which is served in my area). I agree with the other reviewers that the soup was way too salty. Because of the reviews I read, I decided to modify the recipe a bit, I used 6 cups of water instead of 5, and also towards the end, instead of chicken broth which would have been saltier, I used also water. The result was a rich broth but still too salty. I think I will have to reduce the dark soy sauce to only half a cup next time and still use the 6 cups of water and water instead of chk broth. The beef was nice and tender and worked well with the fresh noodles I bought. Also like another reviewer, preferred to add spinach instead of bean sprouts. While making the dish, the house smelled great. Also, I cooked the soup and meat ahead of time and let it cool and put in fridge and the fat coagulated, so the next time when I actually ate it, I was able to easily skim off the fat.

Great recipe. As good as what you get in any Chinese restaurant. To make it even better, I would replace the bean sprouts with spinach (spinach is what is normally put in this soup; I've never seen it with bean sprouts), and use fresh noodles instead of dried.

I think this is a great recipe - however, it is very very salty. I've made it several times already and modified it slightly by adding 6 Cups of water instead of 5 and using low sodium soy. I also made it in a pressure cooker and its much faster - easy weeknight dinner.

This was an extremely tasty recipe that took a long time but wasn't particularly labor-intensive. My husband and I ate this for 2 days in a row. I tried it with both low sodium soy sauce and low sodium chicken broth. Overall, it was still too salty.

This is a wonderful soup. The flavors are rich yet not overpowering. A delicious addition to any asian meal, or a stand alone meal in itself. I made a large amount of the broth, then froze meal-sized portions. When I want to make the soup, nearly all is ready. This is a keeper!

Great dish to make on a rainy day. Everyone loved it, but felt it was too salty. I will make it again with low sodium soy.

Really tasty soup. Very close to a soup we love at a local Taiwanese restaurant. Rather time consuming but worth it - a good thing to make on a rainy weekend afternoon. Consider doubling the recipe. Quite salty even with the low sodium chicken broth - probably worth using low sodium soy or tamari.
