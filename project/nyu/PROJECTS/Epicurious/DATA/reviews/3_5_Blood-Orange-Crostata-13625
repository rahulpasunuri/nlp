I couldn't believe how quick and easy this recipe was. I used all blood oranges and it was beautiful! I did'nt make the pastry dough from the link though. I just made a cardamon grahm cracker crust. At first I thought the grappa might be too strong but it mingled right in and was a wonderfull part of the whole rather than being overpowering. I will definatly make this again.

I loved this recipe. It was so elegant--like something you'd find in a pastry shop. Very reminiscent of desserts in Italy. I couldn't find blood oranges, but I felt the ones I used worked fine.

Blood oranges are just too lovely!! I use a different pastry cream recipe--but if you find that your pastry cream is too thick, lighten it up with whipped cream or Italian meringue, the fluffy texture is a great compliment to the juicy citrus. A bit of gelatin added to the pastry cream helps the product to keep its shape at room temperature, once its cut into wedges.

This is a luscious dessert but not really the way it is printed. I would give it 4 forks with better directions. There are many better recipes for pastry cream including Julia Child's. I have never curdled a pastry cream before; this is a first. It added a lot of extra work working the mixture through a strainer. It was also very much too thick. I added more grappa (which is fine with me) and milk. I chose to segment the citrus fruit rather than slice it. Ok, it's more work but you don't have the membranes which I don't care for. The blood oranges are gorgeous, especially when mixed with the yellow oranges. But any combination of citrus would be fine. I added a red grapfruit because I had it. And the recipe would taste just as good good without blood oranges.
