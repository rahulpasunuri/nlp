I make lots of salads for our dinner. This was the worst salad I have made in a long time. This could be a great and interesting salad. If I try it again, I will roast the cauliflower for at least 30 minutes. After 15 minutes they were almost raw. I do like raw cauliflower, but here they sould be cooked al dente. The over-all flavor was very bland. Maybe more mustard and a different herb, possibly cilantro. Watercress only added color.

We make this all the time, though we serve it more as a side dish than a salad. I roast the cauliflower until it is mostly golden and use any combination of greens. It does not keep well. The flavor is best when everything is tossed together shortly after the cauliflower comes out of the oven.

With or without watercress and radichio it tastes great!!! I've done it a lot of times for different guests,and everyone enjoys it and asks me for the recipe.

I was a bit disappointed in this recipe as I didn't think that roasting the cauliflower changed the flavor that dramatically. While the combination of flavors was interesting, I found the salad a bit heavy and not that exciting.

A bit messy and clumsy for a salad though the flavors work well together. Easy to make. The roasted cauliflower and wlanuts end up being heavy when dropped on the radicchio.

This was quite good but you definitely need the walnuts. The cauliflower basically just adds to the nice nutty flavour of the salad. I didn't have watercress, so I just threw in some pre-packaged mixed greens. This is all I had for supper and it was very filling.
