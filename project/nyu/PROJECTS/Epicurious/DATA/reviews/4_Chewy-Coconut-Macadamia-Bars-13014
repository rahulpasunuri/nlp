These are amazing bars and I made them as the recipe was written, however having no fresh lemons I used fresh key limes for the juice. Everyone raved about them and I couldn't stop eating them!!! I will make them for our church events from now on!

Have been making this for years and cannot believe I have never reviewed it. OUTSTANDING!!! Pay no attention to the negative comments. Make exactly as written. I don't rave often, but these are worth raving about.Just went to look for my recipe to make a batch for my grandson in college and spent over an hour looking for the recipe. The card has disappeared. I paniced. Can't live without these. Then I searched all my cookbooks, more panic. Then went to my trusty epicurious. What a relief and thats when I realized that I never reviewed it. Enjoy!

I made these early for Thanksgiving, cut them and froze them. I was dissapointed although the flavor was good, my crust was undercooked and my filling was overcooked. They seemed to crumble and fall apart. I cut them and froze them, but I'm not sure if I'll even serve them bc they look like a mess.

This was a very easy recipe to make and it tasted great. I took them to a tropical-themed party and everyone loved them. I would not change a thing and would make them again. Would make for a good Christmas/Holiday treat as well.

Loved these! The crust tastes like butter cookies and the topping is delicious. I'll chop the nuts a little smaller next time.

I think these are one of the most delicous things I've ever baked. I make them every year now. They can be tricky, they stick and burn easily. After I've cooked the shortbread layer, I oil the sides of the pan above the shortbread before I put the topping on so it doesn't stick. But even the times I've burned it and it's stuck and they fall apart getting them out they're fabulous. Well worth going off your diet for!

I was very happy with how these turned out. So were my coworkers who gobbled them! I did make some changes: realized I didn't have heavy cream, so I used 1 cup of the Coco Lopez instead. (I noticed they got a little runny at room temperature so I kept them chilled. As a result of not using heavy cream? I don't know.) Also, I used Brazil nuts instead of the macademia. They were less expensive, and just as good!

Everyone thought these were really great. I also used Pam and the bars were very easy to cut out of the baking dish. Will be making this again this weekend. Would suggest that, if one is near, you get your macadamia nuts at Trader Joe's. Very reasonably priced, comparatively speaking.

This is a wonderful recipe. Desserts are not my specialty, but I have made this successfully many times. Thanks to the reviewer that suggested the Pam for baking. I will definately be making it again and again.

I reviewed this once before, but wanted to chime in again. I originally made these as a treat for coworkers. They were a huge hit, and since then, I've had one coworker hire me to make them for her for Xmas two years in a row. They are quick and easy to make and taste very nutty and rich. I see some people are having trouble with sticking. I line my pan with foil, then spray with Baker's Pam (cooking spray with flour in it). After bars are completely cool, just lift the foil out, peel down the sides and cut. I haven't had any trouble at all with sticking or crumbling. I don't know why others are having trouble, but all I can say is this recipe has been HUGELY popular for me!

If I were rating this recipe based on my tastes, I would give it 2 forks. I think it is the type of thing that if I took it off a buffet, I would eat it, but would not go back for more. However, I have had a few people at work make a special trip to my office to tell me they were great (even though only about 1/2 of the batch has been eaten). That is why I give this recipe 3 forks. Also, I know one reviewer suggested not buttering the pan. I had a devil of a time getting these out (due to sticking, not crumbling), even though I buttered the pan. The shortbread did not stick, but the coconut mixture sure did!

After reading the reviews I was eager to make these bars, but I thought they were just okay. Nothing special. They were really hard to get out of the pan. They didn't tempt my tastebuds enough for me to give them a second try.

Very rich and delicious! The secret is the cream of coconut. It's a must. It can be found in most grocery stores. It's in a can and typically the brand name of "coco lopez". It's found in the same area where soft drinks and mixers (such as margarita mix) is kept. Unfortunately many grocery clerks don't know what you're talking about if you're to ask. I found this needed less cooking time as stated, particularly for the filling. It can be difficult to cut into bars. It seemed to fall apart on me.

I have not made these yet - but they certainly look yummy - judging from the recipe itself - HOWEVER - I have searched everywhere here in Canada for Coco Lopez Cream of Coconut - even looked in the US - to no avail! Can anyone please tell me where to buy this product!? I also read a recipe once on the 'net on how to make your own - from solid Coconut Cream??? I would love to try this - any help would be greatly appreciated!

This are absolutely my favorite holiday treat! I've made them the last 3 years. They taste is fantastic-the addition of lemon juice gives just the perfect amount of tang over the sweetness... a MUST try!

Very good. Bars come out more nutty tasting than coconutty. Next time I might try adding more coconut cream to get a more creamy, coconut flavor, but they were still very yummy. Everyone liked them! Pretty easy to make, too.

Delicious!! Was a big hit with everyone. Very easy to make. Can't go wrong with coconut & macadamia nuts. Very rich, so if you don't have a sweet tooth, this cookies is not for you.

These are the most sinfully delicious cookies I've ever put in my mouth. I wish I could give this recipe more than four forks! Simple to make, yet heavenly to eat. Do not pass this recipe by.

These bars were fabulous. I had to make some adjustments according to what I had in my pantry. Used canned unsweetened coconut milk, and pecans. Still turned out great. The shortbread is excellent and is very simple to make.

My husband is a former baker and the mere mention of these luscious bars make his eyes light up. Decadent, gooey and rich--delicious for splurging!

I begged for this recipe after tasting these bars at a work BBQ - absolutely delicious! I disagree with the previous cook - definitely worth the fat and calories (but only once in a while!)

Absolutely the yummiest coconut bar I've ever tasted. The hint of lemon really adds a delicious flavor. I made these in November for Christmas and they froze very well until I was ready to serve them.

These are outstanding bars. They are somewhat expensive to make but SO worth it. I made a half batch and baked in an 8x8" pan. The shortbread mixture was more crumbly than I expected, but they were fine in the end.

I made this for a few friends at our barbeque on Labor Day. Everyone loved them. One of the men even asked for the recipe! Patting the dough into the pan must be done with the fingers (very thin) through a piece of plastic wrap. Next time I make these, I will double or triple the amount of lemon juice. They make perfect bite size squares as opposed to bigger bars.

Made this for a party and they were a big hit. I thought they were one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. Outstanding.

My favorite thing about these bars was the subtle lemon flavor. Mine came out a little well done. My oven must have been having a "hot" day. The texture probably would have been better had they not been over-baked. I preferred them chilled. Something about the shortbread getting solidified in the refrigerator. Also, they shipped well. Despite all this, I prefer something cakey with icing and/or chocolate so I wouldn't make them again.

Whenever I want to offer a foolproof dessert I make these bars. Everyone raves. This is the best non-chocolate dessert I've ever tasted!

Rating: 3
These are delicious. They baked beautifully and could be removed from the pan without any difficulty whatsoever. I read one reviewers comments about difficulty in patting the shortbread layer into the pan --suggestion, a piece of plastic wrap placed over the shortbread dough will facilitate patting the dough into place. There is plenty of dough in the recipe for a 9 x 13-inch pan -- honest! I will make these often!

Every year at Easter I have a cousin that is always requesting a coconut dessert while all others are frowning with this request. Well I think I found a hit that pleased the whole crowd. This dessert was the first to disappear and even the non-coconut lovers were fighting for the crumbs. Oh and since the recipe did not use up the entire can of coconut cream I made a batch of Pina Coladas with the balance! Two hits in one!

These are divine. I take them to work and folks have said they're the best things they've eaten in their entire lives. They really are excellent, anything with that much butter should be. I don't grease the pan, there's enough butter already in the recipe to keep them from sticking.

Found a great deal on macadamia nuts (at Sam's), and tried this recipe... It was fantastic! Definately will add to my collection.

Great bar cookie. I drizzled the tops with melted milk chocolate, white chocolate, and caramel ice cream sauce, cut them very small, and they were Awesome...rich, chewy, a hit with everyone. A recipe to keep.

Amazing. I took a batch of these to a beach picnic yesterday & the other guests were groaning with pleasure & snatching handfuls to take home with them. It was very humid the morning I made them & I did have difficulty patting the shortbread layer into the greased pan. It wanted to break up & stick to my fingers until I remembered to flour my fingertips. One other suggestion ... serve these bars (& store them) well chilled. It improves the flavour 100%. Also, they're less sticky to handle when really cold. A winner.

One word...Fabulous!

These are SO good! They're decadent -- there's absolutely nothing in them that's healthy for you -- but they're good for the soul! I left my macadamias whole, which was lovely. Good either at cool room temperature or chilled. A recipe I'll hang onto, for sure.

I baked these cookies around the holidays and gave them to friends; they were a big hit. The only person who gave them a very marginal review wa someone who doesn't particularly like nuts or coconut. People who like coconut will definitely enjoy these. They're also easy to make.
