This cake is absolutely lovely. It comes out beautiful (even before you put on the coconut) and tastes delicious. I thought the cake recipe here was great, and I really like the marshmallow frosting. That was actually how I found this recipe, looking for something with marshmallow frosting. That stuff is very, very tasty glue. If you aren't so great at layers and they usually come out crooked, marshmallow frosting will save you and your beautiful cake.

I made this for my husband's birthday. It was really nice, and worth the effort. The lime-ginger flavor balances is a nice contrast to sweet, so the overall flavor is grown-up and not too sweet. I would make it again.

I made this icing to go with the shoebox recipe and it was perfect.

This review is only for the lime ginger curd. I always use the Shoebox coconut cake recipe and this filling is a great compliment to the coconut flavor. Frost the whole thing with a cream cheese frosting and it is wonderful. A favorite in my family! I would just also add that they recomment 12 limes but it has never taken me more than 8 small limes to yield the required amounts of juice and peel.

I made this for my sister's birthday and the whole family loved it! I too needed only 6 limes for the curd. Definitely use FRESH ginger, the bottled stuff has water and oils added which prevent the curd from setting up well. I used the Shubox cake recipe since that seems to be the call; it is so good it could stand on its own, sans frosting! The marshmallow frosting was fun to make. This cake is a bit fussy, so I made it in 3 days: 1 curd, 2 cakes, 3 frosting/assembly)but def worth the effort!

I baked this for a dinner party and everyone was impressed. I was very proud of how the frosting and lime curd turned out. The lime curd seemed to contrast with the creaminess of the cake, but the frosting was delicious. The cake itself was dense and dry, but I made up a quick sugar syrup and left it in the fridge overnight and it became moist.

Made this cake for my wedding. It was a casual wedding. *wink* My husband's originally from India and I wanted to subtly include some of his culture into our wedding. Used buttercream icing and put toasted coconut on the sides. I arranged strawberries, raspberries, bananas and star fruit on top and brushed with melted apricot jam and piped the edges with more buttercream. People went wanted big slabs rather than the teensy slices you normally get at a wedding.. Will make again (the smaller version) for his birthday next month.

I thought this was a great cake. I made the curd in a heavy bottomed saucepan, not over a double boiler. The frosting took much longer to beat (I used the whisk attachment on my handheld mixer and was unsure if I was supposed to use that or the beaters). I also toasted the coconut. The thing I will do differently next time is make a half recipe of the cake. The four layers are each pretty big and there wasn't enough curd or frosting to balance out that much cake. Otherwise, very delicious, if a little time consuming.

This is basically a review of the ginger-lime curd, as I too used the Shubox coconut cake recipe. Thankfully, I did a test run of this recipe several days before Easter dinner when I planned to serve it. I used a few shortcuts with the curd, including using key lime juice (very tasty) and Trader Joe's bottled ginger. I'm thinking the ginger (which is very wet) caused a problem with the curd. Even after 12 hours of chilling, it ran over the edges of the cake. The taste of the curd was lovely, spring-like and tart, but it won't do for staying in the cake. In all liklihood, I will resort to using a tried and true Better Homes & Gardens lemon curd recipe, and I will simply swap the lemon for lime and forego the ginger.

I have made this cake several times, though only once in its entirety. The cake itself is fantastic - it is now the only white cake that I make. The curd was excellent as well; I have made this both with and without the ginger. I didn't particularly care for the frosting.

Will only try this again because it was devoured, and everyone raved about it. Used the Shubox cake recipe mentioned by other reviewers, and the cake was moist, the curd delicious, and the marshmallow an unexpected twist, but overall the effect was just sweet. Next time, will cut each layer in half to make a four-layer cake, and double the curd for in between, as the sweet-tart contrast of curd and cake is the best thing about this. Assembled the whole cake and froze it for twenty minutes before frosting, and had no trouble with the sticky marshmallow. The marshmallow is tasty, and makes for a beautiful presentation, but gets lost in the shuffle here. Will save this part of the recipe to use on a chocolate cake, or as marshmallow fluff, but will use something with a bit of edge next time, like a cream cheese frosting.

I loved to lime curd (My 1 yr old daughter ate it off the spoon!!!), thought the frosting was fun to make and a great sweet contrast to the curd, and thought the layers themselves were fine. But, for some reason all the layers together just didn't do it for me, alot of work and great ingredients into a so-so cake. Will not try again.

This is a review of the curd only, but it is wonderful! One note - I only needed 6 normal-sized limes for 1/4 cup of zest and a generous 1/2 cup of juice.

Very delicious! Unfortunately, making cake/curd/frosting is incredibly time-consuming, so be prepared to be on your feet for awhile :)

I thought this cake would be much better than it was, but I will make it again, probably using a different recipe for the cake...or maybe I will add vanilla to the cake. I will definitely use the icing recipe over and over and the lime curd was wonderful! For any of you out there from Philadelphia and surrounding area, make this cake without the lime curd and what do you have? A TastyKake Coconut Cremey! My favorite childhood treat!

The cake was tasty, but a I was a bit dissapointed given the amount (and cost!) of ingredients. I LOVED the marshmallow frosting- will make that again to use on a lighter cake.

This is the best cake I have ever made. The recipe made enough batter, curd and frosting to make two 8" round, double layer cakes...one for me and one for a friend! Next, I will try replacing the buttermilk with coconut milk.

Since I already had pre-made lemon curd, I incorporated the lime and ginger into the buttermilk cake: 1tsp grated ginger + 1tsp lime zest. I also halved the recipe (in 2 8" pans), split each cake and spread curd in between the layers. It was wonderful!

I made this cake with some modifications based on other reviews--it turned out great. I did the lime curd exactly as in the recipe. Per other reviewers comments that the cake was not as stellar as hoped for, I used the coconut cake recipe from Shubox Cafe (on this site). Since I did not have an electric hand mixer to make the marshmallow frosting over the stove, I just beat the extra Coco Lopez from the cake recipe into freshly whipped cream which was perfect. Coated with toasted coconut--awesome!

This cake looked and tasted spectactular! I don't give it four forks because the assembly was impossible on this cake. Even after skewering like it was a vampire, the cake layers slid all over the place when I was spreading the sticky marshmallow over it. I think a lighter texture cake would help a lot. In the end, when I brought it to the party it was a huge hit and there were no leftovers.

I made this cake for Easter. I took the advice of other reviewers and added coconut flavoring to the cake mix. I didn't find the cake to be dry at all, rather the opposite...it was very moist. I baked it for 3 minutes less than the recipe stated and it came out perfect. The lime curd was a breeze to make and had a wonderful flavor. My difficulty came in making the marshmallow frosting...it never got to the point where it "stiffened up" sufficiently. It was thick, but once on the cake, began morphing down the sides to pool around the plate. Not a very pretty presentation after 5 hours, but quite tasty. After 24 hours, the lime curd soaked into the layers as another reviewer stated, but since the cake was completely consumed by the next evening, and still tasted great, I guess that wasn't a real problem. :)

I admit I used the Shubox Cafe cake because I made the cake this recipe calls for and found it too dry for what I was looking for. I did use the curd and marshmallow frosting for an art auction. Ten cakes were in the live auction and mine went for $542! It was known as "The Cake" among tables. Simply excellent.

Pretty good. The cake was a nice texture and the frosting very similar to one my mom always makes. Be careful that you don't get lots of fiberous ginger in the curd. Maybe just using the juice would be a better idea.

I made this recipe during the summer 2004 upon seeing the picture in the magazine. The cake is excellent and very moist and has become my base for all 'white' cakes I make now. This was the first time I made curd, and it was very easy, but I added more ginger and lime because I felt it was too subtle. The only problem is that the curd tends to get absorbed by the cake, unlike the picture showing it staying separate. The marshmallow frosting was good, but would have preferred something more coconutty and creamier. But all in all, it was a delicious cake and I would definitely make it again but with different frosting and I would like to add some coconut flavor to the cake base.

I confess, I made the frosting and the lime curd, but I used another coconut cake recipe (the Shubox Cafe cake on epicurious). The whole thing was a super hit. I doubled the marshmallow frosting and refrigerated the unused portion for hot chocolate.

Although it was very time-consuming and caused me a bit of stress, this cake turned out beautifully (thanks to the coconut flakes) and tasty. I made the curd the day before the rest of the cake. Just remember to keep the curd chilled right until you need to spread it (otherwise it will be very runny and pour out over the sides). Also, be sure to level the cakes well so the layers will stack more easily (except the top layer). I used confectioner's sugar for the frosting and it came out nice and smooth although the taste was nothing special. I would make this cake again, next time maybe with just 3 layers. Oh, and I found that the cake was less dry when it was brought to room temperature.

I made this for my mother's birthday and it was a big hit. Delicious and easy to make, just a little time consuming. The curd is very tart but is perfect as a thin layer between the four caks. I used regular sugar and it blended in nicely. I was generous when icing the cake and had plenty left even after generous spoonfuls were "tested". I only grated seven limes for 1/4 cup of peel. I will make the icing again for different cakes.

Great taste. The curd alone was extremely tart but mixed nicely with the cake and frosting. Easy to prepare, just a little time consuming. I loved the frosting!

For a cake that uses nearly a pound of butter and 14 eggs the results were disappointing. The cake was light with a delicate crumb, but also too dry. This might have been helped had the yield on the curd and frosting been more substantial. The curd is actually extremely good. I would make that again, but use it as the filling for a tart or pie. But it got lost in the sheer volume of 4 layers of dry cake. Unlike other posters I had no graininess in the frosting whatsoever. I, too, used superfine sugar, but I combined it with all the other ingredients and let it sit while I prepped the cake layers with the lime curd. My hand mixer has a whisk attachment which I really think helped prevent the gaininess. I had tremendous problems with icing the top. The stickiness of the frosting wanted to pull the top off top layer, and there was barely enough frosting to cover the cake. Coconut can cover a multitude of sins, and in the case of my cake it had to. This cake does not transport well and it was extremely difficult to cut. I am not a novice baker, in fact I've been in the food business for nearly 30 years and am a very good baker. This cake sound better on paper than it turned out to be.

The filling is tasty, but the cake was a bit dry and the frosting was, as has been reported by others here, gritty, in spite of my using superfine sugar and making sure the sugar was completely melted (as others recommended). Also, the flavor of the frosting wasn't anything special. I don't know whether others were using the entire lime peel or they just had really big limes, but based on other comments I used only 10 limes and didn't get a full 1/4 cup of zest.

I made this for my sister's birthday and it was a big hit! It does take a lot of time but well worth it. I only gratted 2 limes and it was nice and tangy. Don't think it would taste very good if I had used all 12 limes in the curd. It was beautiful to look at and delectable to eat!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

Rating: 3
I made the cake just as the recipe says, but without the coconut on the frosting. It still looked beautiful as the frosting has a great texture. I found that I only needed the zest from 4-5 regular limes for the curd. The cake was fine-textured and almost dense, like pound cake. The ginger-lime curd was tart and a little spicy. If I were to change anything, it would be to make extra curd and to serve that with the cake, on a scoop of vanilla ice cream or with a creme anglaise.

In the words of my son's preschool teacher, this cake is "the bomb"! It is very good; the lime curd is divine. Because I work fulltime and have two under 4, I made this cake over the course of three nights. The first night, I made the curd, substituting lime oil for the zest and bottled key lime juice for the fresh juice. This was a huge timesaver. I also measured out the cake ingredients. The second night, I baked the cake. The third night I made the frosting and assembled the cake. I did not use the frosting recipe in this recipe, but rather the vanilla frosting from the Orange and Cardamom Cupcakes recipe from this same issue (June 2004). While this icing was grittier than the marshmallow icing described here by others, it was quicker to make, and a decent substitute. I will make this cake for the adults at my son's birthday party later this month. My kids did not like the lime curd, so they will get cupcakes instead.

This is a very good cake, and was really popular with 2 different groups of foodies. It takes a fair amount of time to make (set aside a few hours), but I rarely bake, so I'm probably a bit slower. I've made it twice now -- it's quite easy but the frosting can be a bit tricky. Would agree that superfine sugar works better for the frosting. Also, make sure you follow the instructions in regards to beating the frosting -- the first time I made it, I lost track of time, and probably didn't beat it for the full 5 minutes, and the texture was lousy. The 2nd time was much better, more taffy/marshmallow like and much easier to spread. 12 normal size limes is too many -- I had way, way too much zest left over.

Very delicious! I made it for a birthday luncheon, and it was a big hit. The tart curd is a wonderful contrast with the sweet frosting. The only little glich I would play with when making it again is possibly using superfine sugar for the frosting, or just making sure (the sugar)is completely melted, as it was a bit "gritty" when done, although it did not seem to bother anyone. Loved it!
