Since I live in an apartment on a high floor, I am prohibited by the Fire Marshall from grilling. Therefore, for this and all such grilling recipes I would appreciate advice on how to adapt to an oven broiler.

Exceptional. It is exactly how good ribs should taste. In the comments, many people commented on preferring the ribs "falling off the bone" or still tender but with a little more "chew." My husband is a BBQ feign, and he is known as the ribmaster in our group of family and friends. He cooks them with a little more chew, but I swear the fall off the bone people love it too! Well, one day he asked me to make the ribs instead. I followed this recipe almost exactly as written, except I am sure I just used regular or smoked paprika. Without knowing it was a BBQ god's (Raichlen) recipe, he was dumbstruck at how good "my" ribs were. I change the recipe once and awhile, sometimes adding powdered wasabi instead of the dry mustard, an extra tsp of red pepper because we like spice, etc. But I try to stay true to the foundation and I always use the mop sauce, occasionally altering the type of mustard if I want to use the last of dijon, stone ground, spicy brown, or honey mustard (I love mustard, but it is not really detectable in this recipe. Mustard is just instant deep flavoring!). Thank you for helping me with "my" ribs!!

Super yummy! Great! Did in oven, then broiler for 5-8 min at 5 in away from heat. Saved the 2nd half to cook slower tomorrow. I was in a rush for dinner tonight. The mustard and cider mop is divine! Will def. make it again, for party occasions.

I have used this for years. I smoke them in a vertical smoker at very low heat for 4-5 hours. I place water and 3 cans of beer in the drip pan. This makes the ribs very moist and tender. FYI: LBJ had a similar recipe smoked over beer - 6 tbsp sugar 6 tbsp salt 3 tbsp pepper 1 tbsp lemon powder 1 tbsp paprika This recipe is fantastic and I have shared it with many people who have raved about it. Some use it for chicken, steak, and hamburgers!

The rub is excellent. I followed other reviewers advice and I actually covered them and slow cooked them in the oven at 250 degrees for 3 hours before finishing them off on the grill. I didn't get a chance to try the mop sauce, however, next time I make them (which will be tomorrow, I will give it a go.

I used 8lbs of spareribs and it needed all of the rub quantity ( I didnt save any for the end). I grilled the ribs on a rib rack for about an hour and then baked them with foil on for another hour at 375 and it could have gone for another 30 mins. (was running out of grill space). They were excellent! They were spicy and meaty and just overall the best ribs ever.

Delicious!!! I made it just as described, but forgot to add the extra rub at the end. Still, the guests absolutely loved it.

Awesome! A little on the spicey side for the kids but they ate it anyway!! Will make this again and again and again!!

These are the ribs that everyone requests. Cook them long and slow 200 degrees for six hours--fall off the bone!

I thought this was a nice and tangy rib recipe. We did end up using the mop sauce more often than suggested and I thought that really enhanced the final result. Give it a go if you have a hankering for ribs.

Great recipe for short ribs. I made these with the mop sauce. The rub was great and the sauce resulted in an unexpected but delicious coating. If I were to make this again I would bake them before smoking them so the meat is cooked more thoroughly.

I was so excited to make these--borrowed a rib rack, placed five whole ribs in 250 bar b cue--for 3 hours. Barely cooked and still chewy. Realized I should have pre-cooked in oven as others have done. Otherwise followed recipe-- Will do again--Served with buttery cornbread and brown beans. Enjoy

This recipe is over the top. Smoked in a smoker, the rib rub , along with the vinegar mustard mop had great flavor (who would have thought vinegar and mustard would work) I did not have dark brown sugar on hand, so I made homemade with sugar and molasses. It worked out great.

Exceptional! I baked mine at 250 for 2 hours and then grilled them for 10-15 minutes with the mopping sauce and they were fabulous! My husband, who hates vinegar, raved! He didn't even know there was vinegar until I told him. So good and a definite keeper!

I've made this recipe many, many times and always get raves. There's not a rib in the house left. The mop sauce sounds weird but it's really good. Give it a try... I slow bake for about 3 hours at 250 - covered the whole time (I think). Then my hubby finishes on the grill for maximum 10 minutes to add the mop sauce. I pour a little more sauce over the serving plate of ribs, but there's always lots of sauce left over. One of our "keeper" recipes! You'll have tender, falling off the bone, tangy, flavorful ribs!

The spice rub was good and flavorful. I added ground coffee and cinnamon to enhance. The mop added some extra flavor, but let's get real...it's mustard and vinegar. I expected far more. Saucey, tangy ribs are so much better.

Rating: 4
The BEST! I let them sit in the rub for 2 days sometimes-it makes them even better. You can do them partly in the oven, partly on the grill, in a smoker, completely in the oven. It doesn't matter. Months later my guests are still talking about them, craving them, wanting the recipe. This is THE rib recipe.

It's a love - not so love thing: Followed to the letter and the mop sauce is terrific. I have to say that while these were tender, I'm more of a saucy ribs fan. I loved the flavor not only from the rub & the sauce, but the hickory smoke was fabulous as well. I'm going to make them again, but I will cover them with foil and oven roast them for a few hours before finishing them off on the grill. They did not fall off the bone and, for me, the bones gotta be left behind when I pull em off the grill!

Grilled beef ribs with the rub exactly as recipe said. But the BBQ was at about 350 and after an hour they were DONE!Sounds like 250 is the better temp. Didn't try the mop, but probably will next time. the outside was crunchy, but the meat was still tender. Could probably give it four forks if I were better at bbq.

added a bit more salt, omitted the mustard, and subbed some delicious New Mexico Red Chili powder for the cayenne (not as hot, for the kids). Used a bit more smoke, and cooked them low (250) and indirect for about 3 hours. Delish! 1st rub I could eat dry (unsauced)

I cooked the ribs in the oven at 250, uncovered for the first 2.5 hours, then covered with foil for the last hour. I finished off by throwing them on the grill for about 10 minutes on each side. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender and the ribs were very juicy! I didn't use the mop. This rub is delicious - I would definitely make this dish again.

I had never made ribs before, and followed the recipe and instructions exactly, except for yuppifying the mop by using balsamic vinegar with a dash of barbecue sauce. (It was good; I don't apologize) Results wer excellent-- nice juicy ribs with just the right amount of heat and plenty of flavor.

Fantastic! Made for 4th of July and everyone loved the ribs. I prepared the ribs with the rub the night before then baked them for 1 hour before grilling. I have a gas grill and used some hickory chips during grilling. I think I should have reduced the heat and slow cooked with to smoke further but we were all hungry. I did baste the mop sauce once each side. Not sure how to use this mop sauce because I had tons left over

Was wonderful!!! Will make again. Everyone raved. I used the mop, but left the salt out of it. I was uncertain about the vinegar and mustard, but it was great.

The rub on these ribs was outstanding. I used real minced garlic because I didn't have garlic powder. Otherwise, I didn't change a thing about the rub. I slow-roasted them in the oven because we live in an apartment and don't have a grill. They were phenomenal. I wanted to eat the remaining rub out of the pan.

This was amazing! We actually did 3 full racks for a small dinner party & these were a huge hit. THey were not falling off the bone tender, but they weren,t dry and they were delicious. This will be my go to rib recipe.

Very good Ribs.

Loved the ribs! The rub really makes this dish. Marinated the ribs overnight and baked the ribs in foil packets at 250F for about 3 hours. Because it takes so long to bake, I usually maximize oven shelf space and regrigerate the rest of the ribs that I'm not planning to serve. Finished ribs off on the grill with "mop" sauce.

best recipe for ribs, although i do smoke them longer than suggested & prefer without the mop sauce--just fantastic! can't get any closer to memphis-style ribs than to go there yourself

These are the best ribs and so easy to make. My husband likes them so much that he makes and prepares them once a week.

These were really good and pretty easy to make. I didn't use the mop. Wasn't too spicy. These weren't the best ribs I've ever had, but they were pretty close.

Made this recipe from BBQ Bible. Delicious. Error on your list of ingredient. Should be 1 1/2 tbsp. each of pepper and brown sugar not 4 1/2 tbsp

Do this with a rack of lamb! Take a rack and cut off the extra fat. For the paprika, use half hot Hungarian and half sweet smoked. Forget the mop and serve a good store bought Gorgonzola salad dressing for anyone who thinks it is too hot and needs something to cool it off. This is dynamite!

These ribs are great! We keep going back to this recipe again and again and we love it every time!

This is a very tasty rub. I skipped the mop sauce, and added some extras as suggested by other reviewers - instant coffee, cinnamon, and cocoa. Nice and spicy! I was a little impatient, so only refrigerated for two hours. preheated oven to 400, dropped to 350 to bake covered for 1h, then uncovered for another 45 m. I also included a pan of water in the oven. I think next time I will (a) marinate longer, and (b) cook a little longer and slower. But I will *definitely* be making this again! it is FAR easier than messing with a sauce, and with less sugar, a lot healthier to boot.

Made these for the family on Fathers Day, and even my 2 boys (5 & 8) gobbled them up. I used my own spice rub (chili peppers, cumin, ground coffee, oregano, cocoa, cinnamon, basil, brown sugar, salt, pepper, and whatever else strikes my fancy!), left them rubbed and in foil overnight, which was key. Then cooked em on indirect heat on the gas grill for the time indicated on the recipe. Perfection!

The first time I made these, they were the best ribs I've ever had. The second time I overcrowded my grill, and they didn't turn out nearly as well. But of course that wasn't the fault of this recipe.

this recipe is just amazing! I fell in love with rubbed ribs when i went to memphis on year with my family a long time ago, and ever since then i just crave them during the summer. if your looking for something to supress your memphis style rib crave, this recipe is just what you need.

I already make my ribs very similar to this recipe and the result is always outstanding. try adding chile powder and using a blend of hickory and mesquite.

Our family with two 13 year old twins did the Memphis barbeque circuit with hands down winner as Central BBQ, but they DO NOT compare to this! Everyone raves; I add a little less brown sugar...only deviation!

Best ribs I ever had was at The Rendezvous, to have found this recipe was heaven since I live in CO. I smoke these on my kettle smoker and they turn out so tender and so finger lickin' good! Family and friend favorite.

Yes, Steve, this is the ultimate Baby Back Rib preparation. If youve never tried it low-n-slow with real wood charcoal and soaked wood chips, prepare your taste buds for a smoky flavorful treat. I encourage people to play with the Rib Rub Recipe. Mine is very similar but includes chili powder and about 1/8 of a teaspoon of cinnamon powder. (I resisted the cinnamon powder for years, but it add a subtle secret flavor.)
