These cloud-like macaroons may be the best dessert I have ever made. Crisp exterior, chewy interior, exactly like they should be. I did not pulse the toasted almonds all the way to give the macaroons a little texture. Used chocolate ganache with a little cinnamon instead of buttercream. Will be returning to this recipe very soon. Good stuff!

Note: after you pipe the batter onto the parchment paper, leave the macarons to rest for a minimum of 30 minutes. Longer is better. This causes the batter to become "stale," creating a thin shell on the top. When the cookie cooks, this shell will prevent the cookie from expanding outward much, which causes the gas to escape at the base of the cookie, creating the "foot" and ensuring a smooth top. I would recommend not using a wet finger to smooth the tops - the part that get's wet takes twice as long to harden.

Perfect French Macarons! Just spent a year in Europe and HAD to replicate them at home. These are perfect! They had a perfect "foot" on the bottom. Smooth crisp shell on the outside and chewy perfection on the inside! I love using a touch of food coloring to get the beautiful colors of France in there too. Just FOLD in your dry ingredients very carefully and just barely, to incorporate... they will be perfect! Baked mine closer to 13 min for a softer center.

These macaroons are amazing! Not only do they have great flavor but, with a few drops of red food coloring, they are cute as can be. They are very impressive and a crowd pleaser. I will make these again and again.

I just made these cookies for the second time, and they are even better than I remember. Elegant and tasty. I dislike piping, so I just spooned the meringue onto the parchment in little round mounds. It works just fine. I had to play with the cooking times to get the cookies to puff properly. I cook with a gas oven. When I left the cookies on the bottom rack for ten minutes, they puffed right up. Then I moved them to the top to let the outsides dry. If the outside is baked long enough, it should not stick to the parchment. If the bottom of the macaroon is gooey, it didn't stay in the oven long enough. The buttercream is twice as much as you need. But between me and my husband, it's never too hard to get rid of the extra!

REALLY tasty, and the exact flavor I was after. I placed mine on a Silpat on the cookie sheet to prevent them from sticking. Interestingly, one sheet all the bottoms still stuck to the Silpat, and the other none of them did. Maybe it was the way they were placed in the oven? I'll try again to see if I can come up with the reason why. Regardless, the flavor is delicious and texture perfect with a crunchy outside and chewy inside.

Pretty, delicate, little bites of sweetness with great flavor. Tint the buttercream a pale color for better visual appeal. The meringue turned out with the perfect combo of crunchy exterior/soft interior. I had no problem removing mine from the parchment. They would be lovely for a bridal or baby shower.

I don't know who thought up this recipe, but they didn't think it through very well. I've cooked the macaroons till near death, and they're still sticking to the parchment and just not coming off the paper. Haven't even gotten to the buttercream yet! My recommendation is to find another flat almond cookie that can have the buttercream mashed between. Buttercream is good, but as prefiously stated, have another to cookie to put it between.
