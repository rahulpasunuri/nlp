I have been making this recipe for years. I got sick of digging out the magazine clipping. So glad to find it here. I must say to the other person who made it that you have to make individual cakes or it does not cook! It needs much more time than is written. I add almost 8 minutes to the time. Also-I find if you use less butter/sugar mixture (1/2 cup only) in the topping it comes out less soggy. The flavors are wonderful, but the recipe did need tweaking. I didn;t give up on it, though, because they are really on to something here... delicious when it's done right.

This cake has a wonderful taste, and the combination with pears is great. It reminds me of the cake my mom made when I was a kid -- albeit with canned pears and a cake mix! However, this was a flop for us. We made it for a dinner party. Rather than use the custard cups, we put it in an 8x8 cake pan. The pan overflowed onto the oven... burned sugar and butter can generate a lot of smoke! Then, we found that although the cake was cooked at the edges, the inside was still batter. And finally, the pears weren't ripe enough. We salvaged what we could. Despite this failure, I'd like to try again, using either the custard cups or a longer baking time.
