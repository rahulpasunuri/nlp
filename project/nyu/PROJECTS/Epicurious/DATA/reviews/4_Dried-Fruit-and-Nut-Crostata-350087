I have made this recipe twice over the Christmas Holiday & it was a great hit. Very easy to make & perfect dessert for this time of the year.

I was expecting this to be more moist, but it wasn't, so the second time I added dried apricots and added 1/3 cup of apricot preserves to the egg mixture and then it was truly delicious!
