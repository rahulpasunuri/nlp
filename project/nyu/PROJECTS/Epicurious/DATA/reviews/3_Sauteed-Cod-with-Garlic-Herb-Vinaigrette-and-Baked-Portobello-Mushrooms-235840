Nice enough, but not amazing. The roasted garlic in the vinaigrette was too subtle. The cod, cooked as directed, was a bit too tough on the exterior. The mushrooms were very nice though. And it was all easy enough to make.

When I bought cod the other day, I had no idea what I was going to do with it. I had also bought some portobella mushrooms and wasn't sure what I would do with them either at tthe time. So, I went looking here and found this wonderful recipe. However, I did not have the all the fresh ingredients to make the vinaigrette, but I did have some shallot butter left over that I'd made for some scallops last week. I used this to saute the fish in and poured a little over the top to finish it off. I also like a more robust crust on my fish so I added some plain bread crumbs to the flour mix and pressed that onto the outside of the fish before cooking it. I cooked the fish in a pan I could put in the oven; so, after lightly browning the outside of the fish I put a lid on the pan and stuck it in the oven with the mushroom for the last 3-5 minutes to finish cooking. It came out perfectly. What a lovely pair these made. I would also suggest that if you have any new potatoes, maybe slice one into 1/8" slices and saute them too until tender. Put the slices inbetween the mushroom and fish before serving. This would also work with mashed potatoes.

This recipe was easy and a crowd pleaser. I used trout instead of cod. I didn't have all of the ingredients for the sauce, so I substituted scallions for the chives and balsamic vinegar for the sherry wine vinegar. A whole head of roasted garlic seemed like too much, so I used half a head. It was still plenty garlicky. It was great!
