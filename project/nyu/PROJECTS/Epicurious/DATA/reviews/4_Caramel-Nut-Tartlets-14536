Ive been making a version of this for the since I first found it in 2001...I use mini muffin tins with liners and press dough into the bottoms. Sometimes I use the pie dough recipe, sometimes store bought but my favorite thing to do is use sugar cookie dough for the bottom. I have not had any complaints yet. A great recipe that I use over and over...We all love it!!

I liked the tart dough, but found the filling to be annoyingly sweet. There are better pecan pie/tart recipes out there.

I thought there were perhaps too many nuts in proportion to the caramel. Otherwise a great recipe.

I used a different pastry shell recipe, but it had essentially the same ingredients. I followed the filling recipe exactly (using the nuts recommended) and it was outstanding! This was one of the most popular dishes (along with the English Toffee Cheesecake...recipe is also here at Epicurious) at my big Dessert Fest 2001.

The creamy filling contrasts nicely with the crunchy toasted nuts, and the crumb of the dough is superb! I used the three nuts recommended and the result was a hit! Like an elegant mini pecan pie.
