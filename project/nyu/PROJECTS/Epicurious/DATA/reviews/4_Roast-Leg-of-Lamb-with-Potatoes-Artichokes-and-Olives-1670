My family loved this simple recipe. The only reason I did not rate four stars is based on the instructions for cooking the artichokes. Either boil them longer or add them to the oven sooner.

This recipe is the key to my father-in-law's heart. I make it every year for Easter and, for good measure, whenever he's cranky or otherwise grouchy at us. Works every time. No joke.

A couple of years ago, I planted a teeny tiny little oregano plant. Today it is a bush and taking over my garden. I love this recipe because it's a fabulous way to use up the armloads of oregano I cut out of my garden in an attempt to let the sun reach the rest of the herbs. Everyone loves it but I'm not sure I'd be willing to purchase that much oregano from the store. Would cost an arm and a leg.

This is without a doubt my family's favorite dinner for Easter. I have been making this since Easter 1996 and have never found a better recipe for lamb. My children even love to help with the prep work on the artichokes because they know that they will be rewarded for the hard work when they sit down to eat!

We make this every year for Easter dinner. After the first year we stopped making the artichokes and just did the potatoes and lamb. Although we love artichokes - it was just too labor intensive for the payoff (for us!) - which is why this a 3 not 4 for me. We love the flavor and the pairing with the Romaine salad w/dill and cucumber - yum!

Made this for Easter. It got rave reviews, especially from my father in law. And I mean rave reviews. In fact, they packed up most of the leftovers and every time he ate them over the next few days he called me up to tell me again how good it was. I was kind of surprised, given how basic the recipe is, and how much oregano is in it, but it's hard to complain when such an easy recipe garners such praise!

This was a wonderful recipe because your entire meal is in one pan so there's not a lot of cooking time involved. For those of you who live in a small little town like us, let me tell you that this recipe does work with canned artichoke hearts and dried oregano. I'm sure fresh ingredients work better, but we were quite pleased with the results.

Oh my gosh! What a recipe! We tried it for the first time this past Easter and everyone raved about it. Family members who don't even like lamb, thought this recipe was terrific. The leftovers are even tastier!! They get better and better through the week after. Great filler for sandwiches in a hearty crusty bread.

I always get raves when I make this dish. One thing I do to make it easier is to substitute frozen artichoke hearts. Even those who do not love lamb love this one!!

The best thing about this recipe is the baked kalamata olives, yum! I wasn't impressed with the marinade and the artichokes were a flavorless pain in the rear. The lamb was nice but I'm sure there are better leg of lamb recipes available on this site.

My only regret in making this dish is now it is requested by my Mother every time she visits.. and now I can't convince her to try anything else. It is exceptionally easy to make and if you like artichokes and lamb don't pass this one up.
