Make your own tapenade it is very easy. Then slice the jimica thinly and cut these into the shapes you desire.

Bleh! I would have given it only 1 fork, but decided on two because of the potential. Nice idea, but the end result was icky. Maybe it was the tapenade I used (olive - from AG Farrari) and maybe my star cookie cutter was too big, but for the amount of work it took (and the amount of jicama that was wasted in the star cutting process) I will never make this again... not even if I find a tapenade I like better.

Decided to use different shaped cookie cutters for the shapes and used the sun-dried tomato tapenade (located on this site). Very easy. Very delicious...and FUN!

My guests loved these. I also made some with roasted red pepper tapenade. I plan to make heart shaped ones for a Valentines Day party. I recommend using more tapenade than called for because the jicama is somewhat bland.

I would make this dish again, but I would not try to cut the jicama into star shapes. It was too much trouble, and it wasted a lot of jicama. However, the flavors of the jicama and the tapenade were wonderful together. Next time, I'll just cut slices of jicama.
