The tarragon mayonaise was quite good - fresh tarragon was terrific. Didn't have self rising flour so to substitute for 1C I added 1 1/2tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt.I used a terrific brown ale since it's all we had. Next time, I would cut back on the salt, since Old Bay has some and use a lighter beer. Also, eyeball the beer to make a nice consistency, since batter was too thick as described. The fish turned out beautifully crisp and tender inside. We accompanied with the oven baked fries with crushed coriander and thyme, which were also delicious.

I opted for wild Coho salmon. It was a wonderful substitution. I completely changed the tarragon mayonnaise by adding lemon zest, fried capers, and a splash of buttermilk. The sauce was a perfect companion to the salmon.

Best Fish and Chips ever. The kids loved it.

The self-rising flour on this batter made the coating look professional. Though, I still have to work on a way to coat the whole fish, including where my fingers drop it into the pan. I also thought the batter was pretty bland. Without the tarragon sauce, I wouldn't have wanted to eat it. I'll make this again, but will throw in some more salt and maybe some cayenne pepper and maybe some tarragon in the batter. I baked my fries for a less oily result.
