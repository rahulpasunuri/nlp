Fantastic recipe! Only made one change out of necessity. I only had enough pears for the bottom (used Anjou), so I grated a Honey Crisp apple I had on hand for the batter. Presents beautifully, is perfectly moist and flavorful.

Excellent recipe. I substituted 1/4 - 1/2 tsp of ground cardamom for the spices, omitted the crystallized ginger, added about 1/2 tsp. anise extract and about 1/3 cup ground almonds. In a 9 inch skillet (vs. 10 recommended) it took only about 35 minutes, so I would watch it carefully--I think that 40 minutes would have been too much. What I liked about this is the coarse, rustic texture of the cake (due to the use of oil and the mixing technique). Served it in a shallow bowl of warm cream. Excellent!

Horribly bland, too sweet. Threw it out.

This is delicious. I use 4 tbs butter and 2/3 cup brown sugar for the caramel. Not quite so sweet. I also substituted apples for the pears and added ground and fresh grated ginger for a delightful apple upside down cake. This is always a favorite and very beautiful presentation!

Phenomenal! I replaced the oil in the cake with 1/2 cup applesauce, and it turned out perfectly, I think the oil would have been too much with the rich caramelized pears. Definitely serve hot, great with vanilla ice cream. One of my new cool weather favorites!

This was amazing! Very big hit and not very difficult to make. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I omitted the ginger, I hate ginger. I also had only 5 small bosc pears (probably about 1.5 lbs rather than the 2.25 lbs called for) and I was still able to decorate the top & have a cup for the cake batter.

Had 4.5 lbs of Forelle pears that became mealy when ripened so I tried this recipe and it was outstanding. The texture of the pears changed to soft and luscious and the cake was absolutely delicious, especially when topped with whipped cream. Will definately make again.

Pretty as a picture and delicious, too! When my husband turned it out for me, his first response was, "You've outdone yourself!" This was a very easy cake to put together, with no mixer needed. I loved the combination of spices in the cake. to Avih: I guess you don't care for spice cake. And for that matter making it with apple slices would be a great idea, too! I couldn't help myself by adding just a touch of cardamom. Pear desserts can be bland, but this one was utterly delicious! The candied ginger gave it a special touch. I baked mine in a stainless steel skillet. I was sure the amount of butter would keep it from sticking and it did. I literally jumped for joy when it easily slid from the pan - I took a picture of it, too! My only thought was why does it have to be baked in a heavy skillet? If you had a cake pan with 2 inch sides it would be much easier to turn out. When I poured the batter over the pears, it barely covered them, but don't worry because as it bakes it will certainly rise up and cover them all completely. I had Bartlett pears on hand and used 3 1/2 for the bottom of the cake and 1 1/2 for the cup of grated pears. Would I make it again? A resounding YES!!

Delicious and easy. I love a cake I can make in my iron skillet.

Very delicious cake and fairly easy to make. My skillet wasn't super deep so the caramel bubbled over a bit, but a cookie sheet underneath did the trick. We didn't have any whipped cream or ice cream on hand so we served it with a dollop of mascarpone. It could definitely handle a sweeter topping however, as the cake itself isn't too sweet. Overall a good recipe, perfect for when you find yourself with a giant bag of pears :)

I omitted the topping since I only had 2 pears and no brown sugar. The cake was a little dry, but good with yogurt for breakfast. Without the topping, the cake is not very sweet, so next time I might add some brown sugar. I probably didn't use enough pears - I just grated 1 small bosc and 1 medium bartlett. The batter seemed wet enough, but perhaps it would have turned out moister had I added a dash of buttermilk. The crystallized ginger adds a nice texture but isn't totally crucial. Last time I made the cake I omitted the crystallized ginger and made the butter-sugar-pear topping, which of course makes a big difference in presentation.

What a delightful and simple cake to put together! I had everything on hand except for crystallized ginger and orange peel. The recipe didn't suffer a bit. I peeled and quartered three pears for caramelizing and grated just one for the batter. I also substituted cardamon for ground ginger. I will make this cake again and again. We love it!

Delicious cake. It felt like alot of work, but I don't bake much, so I might not be a good judge. My boyfriend thought there was too much ginger.

I thought this was OK, nothing special. It's like a spice cake, just using pears, instead of the usual apples.

Rating: 4
Used Bartlett pears this time, and I love this cake, but I don't think the pears on top add much to it (except for looks if it's for a party). Next time, I will just make the cake alone without the topping - it was almost TOO sweet, and the pears can be a little mushy. The pears in the batter are delicious though, and this is so good with all the ginger. Yum!

Rating: 3
Great cake. Someone needs to explain how to mince candied ginger, however. It just gets tuck on your knife. And, actually, this cake tastes best completely cooled than warm, in my opinion, when moist part condenses a little. Great way to use a lot of pears.

I made this recipe with my bumper crop of pears. I used the little ones - I don't even know what kind. The only thing I did not have on hand was the candied ginger. I did use a cast iron pan and had the oven well warmed up at 350. It only took 30 minutes to cook with the center perfectly done. The cake was lovely, yummy and oh so easy. The center was firm and the outside slightly crunchy. A drizzle of a reduced red wine sauce (no ice cream) made a perfect grown-up tea. I will use this again for my Bosc pear harvest!!and try it with my asian pears too!

This was an excellent cake and very pretty. I used plums instead of pears which was a mistake because they added too much liquid but it still tasted great. Everybody loved it!

This cake is excellent -- wonderfully moist and a great blend of spices and fruit. It is also very pretty. The only change I made to the recipe was to add some dried cranberries to the center of the pan (they looked like the colored center of the pear "flower"). Great recipe.

Hello gorgeous! This was a fantastic-looking cake, and a good way to use up quite a few pears (Bartlett). I completely covered the bottom of my cast iron! Used more ground ginger, as I didn't have candied, (not as good) and added nutmeg (no cinnamon--it always overpowers). Think this would also be lovely w/ almond extract instead of vanilla. Citrus peel seems like overkill. A definite keeper--easy, and easy to tinker w/!

This cake was wonderful! It is key to stick to the recipe as far as the skillet size + style goes, though--this cake really needs room to rise as it bakes. The cake batter should be the consistency of a quick bread (banana, etc.)--if it's not, something may be amiss. On its own, the cake batter also makes excellent muffins + cake.

this cake was incredible and got more raves than any dessert this summer -- we didn't have crystallized ginger so used sushi ginger, cooked with a few tbs sugar, then cooled and mixed into wet ingredients. the cake had a delicious bite and my boyfriend had to restrain one friend from eating the whole thing. making again 1 weekend later...

Fantastic dessert that we served with whipped cream. Only adjustment was I cooked the pears in the pan on low for about 5 mins. before adding the cake batter.

Wow... I just made this again for Mother's Day, and once again, rave reviews from the crowd. Every time I make this cake, I am the hit of the party!

This is really very good, and I will make again- however, the Bosc pears I purchased the day of baking were underripe (typical in most markets) and retained their "crunch" even after baking. When I turned the cake over, some pears actually popped out of the cake onto the counter! I think that poaching the pear quarters in simple syrup prior to assembly would soften them enough to allow them to "melt" into the cake. Poaching in Sauternes, port, cran-raspberry juice, etc. might also make an interesting twist on this already delicious cake. Happy New Year!!

I've made this a couple of times and the soft sounds of pleasure emanating unconsciously and uncontrollably from my guests as they ate was high praise indeed.

Rating: 1
This came out goopy and uncooked in the middle- even with an extra 20 minutes in the oven. The comination of the juice that came out of the pears and butter and sugar made a big pile of liquid that the batter was sitting in, preventing the cake from cooking- there wasn't any carmelization happening.

Living in So. Cal., we have a feijoa (aka. pineapple guava) tree in our yard. I have always been challenged to find recipes which use feijoas. The consistency is like pears, so I thought I would try this recipe. What a huge success! I made this cake for a party, using feijoas instead of pears, and it was a huge hit! Absolutely delicious!

Loved this cake, and so did my guests! Very easy to make, looked elegant, and it also tasted great the next morning. I also used a cast-iron pan, which I would definitely do again. My only suggestion is to make sure the candied ginger is minced in to time pieces.

This cake is so moist and delicious. I used D'Anjou pears and substituted a bit of lemon juice for the orange zest. I don't see what the big deal is about the skillet - I melted my butter in the microwave and then did the rest in a regular 10" round cake pan and everything turned out as perfectly as I expected and could have hoped for. This is a real heirloom quality recipe.

This cake was great, especially the day after it was made! I can't understand how it could be described as "tasteless"--the reviewer must have made a mistake in the recipe. I agree with a previous comment--the skillet is all-important. I used a calphalon "every day pan" and it was fantastic. Gone in no time.

made yesterday, really good BUT had a faint taste of too much baking soda??? The batter seem WAY TOO stiff so I threw in 1/2 cup half/half. otherwise made accordingly. Served a lemon custard sauce on top. Son loved it husband said I have made better.....however just went to get piece and it is GONE Will make again and adjust soda. Baked longer then time given too

I've made this 2 or 3 times now. Always great. I use less butter and less brown sugar with the pears; I also use a smidge less sugar in the cake, and more crystallized ginger ('cause I love it). I have used Anjou pears (ripest I could find in the market): two sliced for the design and one shredded into the batter. Turned out great. I have served with both vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, both are great on top of a warm piece of this cake.

I made this one for a dinner party in moments stolen from preparing the other dishes. Everyone was asking for desert, so I unmolded it right at the table. Silence...except for the sound of 4 forks clicking on plates Incredible! The quality of the cake is directly proportional to the quality of the skillet you make it in. Use grandma's old cast iron, and your guests will be amazed.

This was very good. The orange peel and ginger were a nice complement to the pears. I baked in a well seasoned cast iron skillet; came out crisp around the edges and unmolded beautifully. Serve warm with a good ice cream -- Breyer's French Vanilla is my choice.

I made this for my college age son and his friends. It came out of the oven, turned it over and it was gone. They ate it right off the plate before we could cut it into individual pieces. It's got to be good! A great addition to the upcoming Thanksgiving feast.

I made this cake as an alternative to apple and pumpkin pies for Canadian Thanksgiving dinner. It was easy to make, very attractive, and just delicious. It will definitely be a regular feature at holiday dinners - at the request of my family - oh, and with vanilla ice cream.

I made this to take to a dinner party, and so it sat for about 5 hours before I reheated it. Not sure if that contributed to the fact that it was sloppy moist (like pudding) and not at all caramel-ly. Too much cinnamon and not enough crystalized ginger for my liking. It didn't turn out at all like I'd imagined. Very disappointing.

Rating: 3
I made this cake a few hours prior to serving in an effort to spend my last minute time on another dish (this is not recommended in the recipe, as you'll note). The flavors were wonderful but the cake was a little soggy in the middle though I'm certain it baked long enough. I think I let it sit too long before serving -- won't do that again. I'd also cut down on the quantity of candied ginger (2 T. would be enough I think)as I found it a little overpowering. Overall, an easy and delicious fall dessert.

This was a huge hit at a recent birthday party. It's a definite addition to my cake repertoire. However, I wasn't sure my skillet was ovenproof so I increased the sugar, flour and baking soda and baked it in a bundt pan. Next time I will use larger chunks of crystallized ginger (I minced it very finely)and perhaps add a tablesopon of grated ginger.
