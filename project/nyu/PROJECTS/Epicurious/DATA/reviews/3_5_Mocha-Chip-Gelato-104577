Four forks for deliciousness, ease, and healthfulness. It's a variation on David Lebowitz's Fleur de Lait recipe from The Perfect Scoop. I usually double the recipe and use 4 tablespoons of cocoa to 4 tablespoons of coffee, to make a coffee-flavored chocolate ice cream rather than a chocolate-flavored coffee ice cream. Also, I toast the almonds and add them to the ice cream with the chopped chocolate.

I dont know if I can really rate this recipe since I tweaked this recipe quite a bit and made it with agave and stevia but i rated it well because it was a great base for me to go off of. You can see my recipe at : http://revampedrecipes.blogspot.com/2011/07/chocolate-almond-gelato.html so yummy and delicious!!! Was rich, creamy, and didnt get rock hard overnight.

GREAT Gelato!!! True Italian. (NO eggs!) The first three ingredients and the steps that go with them ARE my base for all my gelato recipes now. This is one of my DH's favorite...along with a mango one. YUM.

FABULOUS!!!! Gelato is not made with heavy cream, yolks or any part of that. This is PERFECT! Flavor FANTASTIC! Do as written -- you can't go wrong. WONDERFUL!

I followed the recipe precisely (all except the almonds) and I was pleased with the result. My only tweak next time would be to use less instant coffee - I thought the coffee flavor drowned out the chocolate, and I used fairly good quality chocolate. I didn't taste the cornstarch as others have reported, I really thought this was pretty good for a low-fat ice cream.

Well, I'm torn. For a lower fat alternative, this isn't bad. It's got a funky texture with the cornstarch (I would DEFINITELY recommend cutting back on the amount). Also, kindof a wierd aftertaste because of the cornstarch. I recently got my ice cream maker, so I've only made about 4 ice cream recipes and the others were custard based, which were SOOOO much better. For lower fat though, this isn't bad.

I am right now in the process of chilling my 2nd batch of this delicious recipe. I don't know what Spokane is talking about - I think it's wonderful. I made a double batch, and did 3 tbs cornstarch (1.5 for a single batch) - came out great. I also sub'd splenda (eek!) for the sugar, and it still was great. Before it cooled the mix tasted flat the 1st time I made it, so I doctored it a bit - wish I hadn't. Once cooled it was a bit too much. This time I'm sticking to the pub'd recipe, and as it cools it's tasting better & better. Is fantastic right out of the machine (maybe allow about 15 mins in the freezer before serving to guests), needs a few minutes to sit at room temp after frozen solid in the freezer to bring back to it's best. A great low fat (and can be low- sugar )dessert.

I think eating too much diet food has gotten to your tastebuds -- this recipe totally tastes low-fat. It's icy and one dimensional, more like a sorbet than a gelato. The flavors are okay, and it comes together easily and quickly, but not at all what one would expect for home-made ice cream.

This was raved about by everyone at my dinner party. It was easy to make, tasted very rich -- and the best part is that it was pretty much guilt-free. I tripled the recipe to make enough for everyone. Didn't change a thing - can't understand how people can rate or review a recipe when they've changed most of it. It becomes a different recipe.

Rating: 3
Am going to try and make this again in the future, due to all of the rave reviews, but we made the fatal mistake of pouring it into the ice cream mixer before it was thoroughly cooled, and it came out more like a pudding than an ice cream, which was a bit of a disappointment. The coffee flavor was terrific though, and definitely, definitely double the recipe (unless you want to spend all of that time making 1 scoop!)

Double the recipe! Unlike most low fat ice cream recipes, this one will keep in the freezer. You can also take out the coffee and chocolate to make a vanilla ice cream.

Insanely good. Smooth, creamy, tastes like you bought it. I used full amount of cornstarch, mixed all the chocolate in to melt (no chips), and made do with the milk I had on hand - 1 1/4 cups of skim milk, with 1/2 cup of half and half. This is one of those "can't believe you made it" sensations.

Unlike what is recommended in others' reviews, I used only 1/2 tsp or so of instant espresso granules (already stronger than most instant coffees), and only about 1 1/2 tsp of cocoa powder, and I added a splash of vanilla extract. The reason: my guests thought the original recipe was too strong to be refreshing. My friends now find the altered recipe to be light and refreshing - more like a frozen vanilla latte. And they appreciate that it is reasonably light on calories, too!

A really great dessert. I used our usual 2% milk, and 1.5oz chocolate, adding it all to the mix as I wanted a velvety texture. The calories still come out pretty well, and it was deliciously rich and smooth. I found 2 tbsp cornstarch too much, we got a thin layer of very hard gelato under the paddle. However, the mix took a surprisingly long time to thicken on the hob, so next time I'll use a generous tablespoon. Overall, tastes totally decadent for a very reasonable amount of calories- does it get better!?

Loved it...super easy to prepare, nothing about it tastes low fat. I will be making it a second time this week for company.

As everyone said, this doesn't taste lowfat - and I made it with skim milk, since that was on hand. I threw the almonds in with the chocolate pieces, which everyone seemed to like.

I liked this, but not as much as other reviewers (including my husband, who loved it). It wasn't consistent with "real" gelato, which I was hoping for. However, for a low-fat dessert, I thought it was a winner, so next time I'm in diet mode and need something sweet, I'll make it. One note: this hardened to the right consistency in about 10 minutes (due to cornstarch, I believe), rather than the ususal 20 my ice cream maker needs.

This was fantastic and, as said many times below, no one thought it was low fat. Topped each with some crushed chocolate covered espresso beans instead of the almonds. I used the full amount of cornstarch and had no problem with it being to hard. Next time I'll probably melt all of the chocolate rather than keep some as chips. An excellent base recipe to go crazy with.

I have made this recipe many times and always use soy milk as we don't keep milk at our house. It is still great.

I made this almost precisely as the recipe indicated, except used espresso granules instead of instant coffee. Excellent. No one believes it's low fat.

Delicious! And very rich tasting. I used espresso powder instead of coffee granules and it had a very intense coffee flavor (which I love). Definitely a keeper.

This is an exceptional recipe. It does not have that "no there there" taste that so many low-fat frozen desserts do. I find 1 1/2 T cornstrach to be about right. I prefer to add all the chocolate to the milk mixture and skip the "chips," for a smooth gelato. I have used Mexican chocolate with cinnamon, and the flavor combination was incredible.

I doubled the coffee and used the original cornstarch. No one believed it was low fat!

I had semi-sweet chocolate on hand, so used that instead of bittersweet. The resulting gelato was okay flavor-wise. Consistency was very good: not too hard & not too soft. I will definitely try this again.

I am giving this recipe a 4 fork rating even though it was a major failure for me. I heeded others' advice and only used 1 tablespoon cornstarch. Big mistake. The gelato did not harden for me--it had the consistancy of a not-very-thick milkshake. Excellent flavor though, and I will certainly try this again with 2 tablespoons cornstarch.

I usually don't bother with low-fat recipes because I feel they don't always live up to my expectations. But this was a real winner. I followed the advice below and reduced the cornstarch by half. I also used 2 percent milk since it's what I had on hand. I prepared the mixture a few hours ahead of time and kept it chilled in the refrigerator. Right before cleaning up the dinner dishes I poured the mixture into my ice cream maker. The gelato was done in about fifteen minutes and I served it immediately. That eliminates the hardening problem and leaves you with gelato that's of soft-serve consistency. Delicious!

I added extra chopped chocolate and this tasted great. It was very difficult to scoop (too hard) so I'll try less corn starch next time... and there will be a next time!

Rating: 3
This was a very good gelato. We would suggest that you reduce the corn starch to one-half the amount called for in the recipe - it was much too thick and caused a strain on the ice cream maker. We would also suggest you increase the amount of coffee to 2 times the amount called for in the recipe - the mocha flavor was weak. It was easy and as gelato recipes go - it is a winner.

I thought this was wonderful! Preparation was easy and I just stored the pot w/ the ingredients in the fridge until ready to put into the ice cream freezer. I am always looking for low fat and luscious recipes and this was one of the best. this one's definitely a keeper!

Surprisingly good, low fat or not. I followed this one to the letter, and wasn't disappointed. Chocolate and coffee are my favorite ice cream flavors, and I'll definitely do this again.
