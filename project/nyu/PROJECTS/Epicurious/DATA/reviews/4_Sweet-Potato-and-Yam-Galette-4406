This recipe was easy and delicious. I used all yams because that's what I had. I used a scant 1/2 cup of brown sugar (not packed). I did not have any of the sticky results that others mentioned. In my opinion it would have been too sweet to have used a packed 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Powdered ginger works fine. The lemon zest is key! I did not press the sweet potatoes, they cooked fine and inverted easily. I was not able to cut into wedges but everyone was happy just digging in with a spoon. I will try to compact next time because I think slicing into wedges would make for a nice presentation.

The ginger and lemon do a great job balancing the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes. Like another reviewer, I cut back a bit on the brown sugar and bake in a pyrex casserole rather than a skillet. I often get requests for this dish and it's so easy to make!

Pretty good and easy. I made the most simple version. I used less sugar, margarine, 86'd the flour, didn't do any pressing, and also it didn't need that much time to cook. And only used sweet pots, Yum!

Exellent dish. My family loved it.

This has become a family staple for holiday meals; it's the one veggie dish that my mom knows is required at Christmas dinner. It's also very easy to prepare and hard to screw up. (Even if you overcook it, at worst you'll end up with some crispy caramelized pieces at the edges.)

My family loves this recipe. After a couple of tries it is easy to prepare. For a long time we did not have a large enough iron skillett, so prepared it in a pyrex baking dish and it was fine. Since I like the combination of lime and ginger I use lime instead of lemon. I back off on the brown sugar to cut down on the sweetness, too.

This is a family favorite now. I have been asked to make two or double size it so everyone gets as much as they want.

I have been making this for years and get RAVE reviews every year. The presentation is beautiful. It takes a little more time than other sweet potato recipes, but I always think its worth it.

I made half the receipe to decide if I wanted to make it this Thanksgiving. The brown sugar and butter turned into a caramel sauce that quickly became hard. Has anyone else had this problem? I broke up the caramel and dropped it over the potatoes but it was not evenly distributed. The flavor was great but not even.

This is great and not that hard. I did it once with the two kinds of potatoes. That was pretty, but it's good with just one kind. Now I make it with just sweet potatoes. Made it originally for Thanksgiving. It was such a hit that I have started making it ahead for more ordinary family meals. Still no leftovers! It flips out of the foil easily and is pretty cut up into pie slices. Not sure why others find it a lot of trouble. It takes just a few minutes to hand slice 2-3 potatoes.

Rating: 4
I'm giving it 4 forks, even though I thought it was a bit too sweet. I doubled the recipe, tho, and that might be why -- I think I ended up using twice as much sauce and about 1.5 the amount of potatoes. I used 2 overlapping pieces of foil and it came right out of the pan. I also made it early, compressed it quite a bit, let it sit for about 2 hours, and heated it up in the oven, and then flipped it. My friends LOVED it.

Rating: 0
A real winner! Easy and full of flavors. I added more ginger and a 1/4 C of H2O. Also, the other comments to forgo the 'compacting' are good advice. I alternated the yams with the sweet potatoes for color. Will definitely make again.

My husband and I make this dish for Thanksgiving every year--for the past 10 years! it's a tradition. As someone else said, the mandoline is your friend with this dish--speeds up the slicing process and keeps the slices uniform in size. however, we have yet to figure out how to unmold the galette from the cast iron pan without sticking. I oil the pan *and* the foil, but it always sticks. Someone upstream said they let it sit for an hour before unmolding. Perhaps that's the answer but if anyone has other tips I'd love to hear them.

I make this every year at Thanksgiving and people love it. A note to those considering making it: Make double the brown sugar mixture and add as you see fit. Depending on the size of the yams and potatoes, it can get a little dry so that's why I double the mixture. Also, I add a little cinnamon to liven it up a bit. Overall, it's delicious and people always comment!

this was delicious. did not skin the potatoes and did not use tin foil to line the pan. I used a corningware tart dish and cooked it ahead of time and reheated before serving. I cut the potatoes thinner too. Big hit! Tapping down the potatoes only caused them to get mushy so I didn't do it. Maybe it needs to be done earlier in the cooking or if the potatoes were cut thicker it would not have been an issue.

OMG!!! This was fantastic!Everyone had seconds and raved over this!Layers of flavor.Can't wait to make this again.I used more than just 1T of lemon peel & I minced it all instead of grated it.Only had orange sweet potatoes on hand.I arranged it in a shallow quiche dish & served it right from there-beautiful presentation.It didn't serve as neatly as a pie slice-it didn't stay totally together, but nobody cared!Could be my signature dish of the season!

This was delicious. I have some amazing never stick DEMARLE silicone/glass bakeware that I used to make this yummy dish -- and it turned out perfectly! Brown on the top and bottom -- the caramel evaporated well, but I did spoon out a couple teaspoons of excess melted butter/caramel sauce directly after baking and before the re-heating. I baked in the Demarle Flower Mold and covered not with foil, but with my Silpat. This made a great seal. I used the convection oven at 350 for 40 minutes, pressed down the potatoes, convection baked for another 20 minutes. I let the potatoes set for 2 hours, then re-heated for 20 minutes at 300 before turning out the warm sweet potatoe galette. I made this two days in a row -- both times as an appetizer dish for taking to parties. Healthy, gorgeous, and an inexpensive dish. I have requests for the recipe from both parties!

I wonder if the recipe should be more explicit and specify that the aluminum does not get put back on top after the first hour of baking. I found there was too much liquid which would have cooked off if I hadn't put the foil back on. I doubled the recipe (by using a 4" deep cast iron pan) and struggled a little to get it to release from the pan, but again this was my fault for using two narrow pieces of foil to cover the pan instead of a large piece that would fit properly. Some of the liquid had seeped out and stuck the foil (like glue) to the pan. So, other than a couple of minor fixable problems that I'll definitely take into account next time, this was definitely worth the aggravation. I grated extra lemon peel over the finished galette instead of serving it with the lemon wedges which added a wonderful fragrant touch, just prior to serving. My only complaint was that there were no leftovers!

This was unfortunately not the "wow" recipe I was looking for. Very simple to make, but did not come out looking like a galette, just a pile of potatoes. Flavor was good, but the edges of the potatoes were kind of chewy and tough. I doubt I'll make this again.

This was fabulous. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I used 1 pound each of sweet potatoes and yams but the called for amount of all other ingredients and it was delicious.

Did I do something wrong? I followed the recipe exactly and when I turned the potatoes over onto a platter, they were just a big glob, spreading out all over the platter. They tasted awesome, the ginger and lemon complimented the potatoes nicely. I would like to try this recipe again, based on the rave reviews. Any ideas? Did anyone else have this problem?

The flavour balance of the sauce is perfect. In a pinch, I have used canned sweet potatoes heated with the sauce and (though not as good as fresh cooked yams/sweet potatoes) it is quite good.

Normally I would not give ANY sweet potato recipe four forks. I only make them once a year (Thanksgiving) and the best they can be is delicious, right? This truly is a dish beyond compare. This year I replaced my usual candied sweet potato recipe (from this site) with this recipe. Wow. There were no leftovers. I don't think I'll be able to wait until next Thanksgiving to make this again. I couldn't find two different colored yams so I just used ruby yams.

Rating: 2
Thought this was pretty and had good flavor, but it required more effort than it was worth. Between hauling out the mandoline then layering alternating colored potato slices (as well as making the sugar mixture a second time since I thought I'd made a caramel sauce?) it just didn't have the punch that it should have for the effort. Won't make it again.

I just made this for Thanksgiving. It was delicious and it looks really beautiful and impressive. I made mine in a cast-iron pan--it took less time to cook, it unmolded beautifully (I let it sit for almost an hour) and the bottom was beautifully caramelized. I did not get variations in color, however....the "yams" I bought were actually sweet potatoes, so everything had orange flesh. Yams are a different animal and not usually stocked in commercial markets in US (they are those giant things you see cut up in bodegas).

Loved it! The sauce with the ginger and lemon peel was wonderful - already thinking of using the same combination for a tart or cookies. Didn't unmold as prettily as I had hoped. Next time I would use twice the ginger. Lots of compliments.

This recipe is a must each year for Thanksgiving dinner. I've been making it since 1999 and it's requested over and over again. My brother-in-law who hated yams makes sure I'm making this for dinner each year. It's not overly soggy or sweet and the grated lemon peel and minced ginger really make this dish special. The presentation is also wonderful and sure to impress.

Rating: 3
Substituted the yams for regular baking potatoes which made it beautifully colourful, but still found it a bit sweet. Next time, I would probably omit/cut back the brown sugar because I found that you couldn't really taste the sweet potato. The broiling at the end was a great idea ... made everything nice and crispy! I also baked it at 450 for 45 minutes and it was just fine.

Rating: 3
This recipe was great! It turned out nicely browned/carmelized which I attributed to the fact that the only pan I could find to use was an old cast-iron one. I also wound up cooking it at 450 because I ran out of time, so the higher heat may have been a factor, too. I also did not seal the foil tightly on the top so the liquid cooked away. I then wrapped the entire pan in a towel and took it to a dinner where it wasn't flipped out of the pan and served for another hour. I reheated it for a few minutes in the microwave after putting it on the serving dish. Rave reviews!

I will never need to look for another sweet potato recipe. This will be the standard. Delicious with the lemon squeezed over it. As someone else said, this is the end of the mushy mashed sweet potatoes. What a beautiful presentation. The only drawback was that it was hard to find room in the oven for the pan while the turkey was cooking.

Rating: 3
Excellent flavor! The ginger and lemon peel add a totally new dimension to the taste. Only gave 3 forks because mine was a big mess when I went to unmold it. I think I used fewer potatos than the recipe called for, but used about the same amount of other stuff, so it was a little to soft to hold the shape. So it wasn't as nice a presentation as I had hoped for, but I served in a bowl, and everybody liked them. I had to give out the recipe after dinner. I'm going to try adding the ginger and lemon to my other sweet potato recipes, the flavors really compliment eachother nicely.

This dish is wonderful, in both taste and presentation, just as the recipe is written. But, for those of you seeking a mouth-watering variation, instead of lemon and ginger, I substituted ~3 tbs. chopped fresh sage and 1 chopped shallot and served the galette to my Thanksgiving guests. The reviews were rave.

Everyone LOVED this dish but what seemed to make the biggest impact was the presentation. It is a beautiful gourmet alternative to mushy marshmellow sweet potatoes.

I made this for my husband & I (1/3 the recipe) for dinner last night and we both thought it was great. I can see why it is a great presentation for company. I did the broiler recommendation first while the galette was still in the pan then after I 'flipped' it onto a serving plate I put it under the broiler again. I also reduced the baking time by half and the potatoes were more than done.

I didn't see the comment from other reviewer to run the potatoes under the broiler, but I agree. Made it for Thanksgiving, and it's good, just need to get it more crispy - also probably would 've been better if I used a mandoline to get more consistent slices.

After reading all the great reviews, I decided to try this even though I had my doubts about it. All the time I was making it I keep telling my husband, I didn't think he would like it, but I just wan't to try it. After one bite, all we could say was GREAT. My husband said this was a keeper - what a surprise. I didn't have any problems with flipping it. Liked the idea of the previous reviewer about putting it under the broiler. Might look better. Will try that next time. This receipe only made enough for four servings. Could use less butter and it would be okay.

Rave reviews from the whole family for Thanksgiving dinner! This recipe perfectly solves the problem of how to prepare sweet potatoes when half of the family demands the addition of marshmallows and the other half (the cook included) would rather eat paste than add marshmallows to the naturally perfect yam. This dish is perfectly sweet and wonderfully aromatic (lemon and ginger) without losing the flavor of the potatoes. It unmolded perfectly from the skillet, but I might run it under the broiler for a minute or two to carmelize the glaze on the top - it would be even prettier.

Tried this for the first time for a dinner party. The galette didn't flip out as easily as I'd hoped; in fact, it slid out into a pile the first time. I shoved it all back in the pan and then flipped it sucessfully. I thought it looked like a yam mound, but everyone said it turned out beautifully -- people even photographed it! Tasted very good, though. PERFECT for Thanksgiving. You could cut the butter in half easily for a lighter version.

I and my guests appreciated this very tasty dish. I did not do the compressing and the flip as I was cooking on a wood stove in the woods and it seemed too complicated at the time. But it was absolutely super as the flour gives the yams and the sweet potatos a really rich tasting crunch.
