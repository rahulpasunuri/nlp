I made this last year for my French in-laws. They are not easy to please and it was a total hit. Not too sweet. Great texture and flavors - the spiciness of the ginger and the smooth butteryness of the caramel (I make my own salted-butter caramel) go great together.

I have made this cake a few times every fall since it was published. I tend to sub half the oil for applesauce, but follow it other than that. It always turns out wonderfully, although it usually needs a little longer to cook. I have also successfully made mini bundts using the recipe. It is simple to make, easy to clean up and delicious!

I have made this cake several times and it always comes out perfect. It's very moist and flavorful, and as a bonus it keeps well. I've made it with caramel like the recipe suggests, but for a fun twist I've also served it with rosewater whipped cream and that makes it really special.

I used strong unsulphured molasses (not blackstrap), substituted prune baby food for half the oil, and used strong coffee instead of water -- DELICIOUS! Not too sweet, really nice/light texture and good ginger flavor (make sure your ground ginger is fresh, not old and dusty). Also took another reviewer's suggestion of serving with bourbon-flavored whipped cream, which was divine. This is an easy recipe that's terrific for fall.

Wow! I thought this cake was delicious. The flavors of the ginger and molasses really come through. Think I'll try another reviewer's suggestion of replacing water with coffee next time though.

this cake is very rich; it needs the whipped cream to lighten it up a bit, but, it is so wonderful, so full of the taste of autumn. i make it every year to raves.

Have to agree with Westport--the cake was disappointing, but it did make the kitchen smell great!

A couple of past reviewers wrote that this cake tasted rather bland, so before I made it, I compared it to several other recipes for gingerbread and cake. Other recipes call for 3 to 4 times as much salt as this recipe. I increased the salt to 3/4 teaspoon. It did not taste salty, but brought out the flavor of the spices perfectly. Based on this change, I gave it 3 forks.

This cake is delicious. If you have a dark colored bundt pan make sure you decrease the time or else it over cooks. Use the dark molasses if you want a richer flavor. Use the caramel sauce and fresh whipped cream. The flavors merry extremely well. We would definitely make it again.

This is great! I replaced the water with strong black coffee (as per a previous reviewer) and think this is the way to go. The cake is delicious and moist. I didn't bother with the caramel thought whipped cream was just fine. For those who found it lacking, perhaps you were expecting more of a spice cake, remember this is a molasses cake. Try it again, I think you'll enjoy it!

I hate to be the dissenting vote, but I thought that the cake was okay...certainly not the best I've had - the texture and aroma were excellent. However, I found it more appealing while it was baking in the oven. The kitchen smelled heavenly!!

I thought this cake was very good. It was so tender & moist. I must admit I was disappointed in the amount of "kick" this cake had. I was hoping for a more pronounced flavor of spice. I would like it more if it had a deeper depth of flavor.

Delicious and easy to make. The ginger adds a nice kick to the cake which was moist and rich. I served it with store-bought caramel sauce. I wish I had had some whipped cream!

This was fantastic - moist and flavorful, and an impressive dessert with the whipped cream and caramel. I individually wrapped and froze leftover slices to have at work with mid-morning coffee . . . perfect.

This is my new favorite gingerbread recipe. It was moist and had a wonderful flavor. Substituting 1 cup of black coffee for the boiling water gives it a richer flavor. Delicious served with bourbon whipped cream.

This cake was easy to make and delicious. The cake would have been fine on its own but adding the caramel sauce (I used Mrs. Richardsons' brand) and the whipped cream really made it into a special dessert. The leftover cake was perfect for breakfast the next day.
