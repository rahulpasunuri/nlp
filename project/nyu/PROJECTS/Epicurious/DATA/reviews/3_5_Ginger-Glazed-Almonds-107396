My Thanksgiving potluck crowd demands these each year and I love them too.

I was eager to try this recipe as the other reviewers were so enthusiastic, but was very disappointed. The coating siezed in the pan when I added the nuts - ok, I have no experience making candy so must have done something wrong - leaving me with dry nuts and a few burnt lumps of sugar in the pan. I tried again, this time combining the ingredients in a bowl away from heat, and substituting tamari for the salt to provide enough liquid. The resulting glaze tasted great, but left little taste on the nuts once baked.

I love the flavor of these but next time will make w/out the water as suggested...too soft, or maybe I didn't cook them long enough?

Spectacularly tasty! I made this for a brunch snack and it went over very well. The sesame seeds definitely made them.

I made these for a holiday party and have already made more to enjoy myself! The second time I added more cayenne and salt to give them more kick. Excellent snack!

A great recipe for any nut! I have made this for almonds and walnuts. Great for spicing up salads or alone.

this is an awesome recipe for snacking.... I added approx 1-2 tbsp of sesame seeds while baking...more for presentation, and I loved them. Will definately be making these on a regular basis.

After taking them out of the oven, I dusted them (using a fine-mesh tea strainer) with a little cardamon, which added a needed dimension. Next time I will omit the cayenne because it overwhelmed the ginger flavor (which already adds heat). I also used pistashios, but this recipe would work well with any nut.

Easier and better for you than the recipes that call for deep frying. I make several cups and keep them for weeks in a sealed bag at room temperature. Reheat in an oven for a few minutes and add to salad or ...

Easy and went well with the 2002 holiday feast menu.

These were wonderful! So popular with my family that I am making them on a regular basis. I will try omitting the water on my next batch. I will also branch out and try this with other nuts after reading the previous comments. I am interested to see how the results vary.

I made these for a party using pecans (as another reviewer suggested), so maybe that's the problem. They just weren't very exciting. The Black Pepper Almonds on this website are fantastic - much more interesting flavor.

These were a hit with our guests on New Years Eve. Simple to make and delicious to eat!

Oh my, this is sooo good! You must must must make it. I tripled the recipe with a giant bag of almonds from Costco, did not add the water (thanks to a previous reviewer's recommendation), and added some cracked pepper. Yum. =P I also found that I didn't need to stir at all during the cooking process. Just at the end to keep it from becoming almond brittle.

We love "doctored" nuts but most recipes have a lot of added butter and sugar. In contrast, this feels almost virtuous and would be delicious even without that feeling! They're just lighter, brighter. A great addition to a collection of nuts recipes gathered over the years, the first really different one in quite awhile. Make and enjoy! We did find that frequent stirring was important, did after 10, 15, 20 and 25 minutes. Didn't bother to oil the baking sheet and since there was relatively little syrup, wasn't a problem at all.

Yummy! Nuts are crisp and crunchy, glaze is a good blend of sweet and spicy, and love that ginger! Only had 1 cup of almonds, so added 1 cup pecan halves with great results. Due to the crevices in the pecans the glaze was thicker than on the smooth almonds, so they were much more flavourful. Another keeper for sure!

These are fabulous - simple and elegant with champagne before dinner. I have made a batch both with and without the water and like the results better without.
