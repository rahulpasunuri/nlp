taste was so-so - but cooking it was early impossible. You say to brush the fish with oil and then cook in a very hot pan - well the fish not only sticks to the pan - but there is no oil left to drain - the fish all but crumbled and my pan was left permanently stained. There were chunks of fish stuck to the pan. If you cook this in a non stock pan - then how do you do a reduction ?

John Dory is one of my favorite fishes. When matched with fennel it is truly magnificent. I added some sliced sun-dried tomatoes to the anchovy mixture because i had them on hand- it was delicious.
