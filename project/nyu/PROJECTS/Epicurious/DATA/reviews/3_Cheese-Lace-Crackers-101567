Yes, they did cook out to be greasy...but do you eat cheese? They are cheese. I used the bit of candied ginger and thought it was a great idea. Nice little crackers for a cheese try.

I totally agree with the previous reviewer. They were good in an unhealthy, greasy, crunchy, burnt-cheese kind of way. I felt a little disgusting afterwards. I was looking for more like a homemade "Cheese Nip." This wasn't it.

Ugh! It's like eating crunchy oil. Rarely do I have any problems with recipes from this site. I followed the recipe exactly as written, allowing the dough logs to refrigerate for two hours and spacing the 1/4" thick dough slices two inches apart, but they spread out so much I ended up with a pan full of greasy "lace." I valiantly tried to save them, and was able to cut the mess into squares and lift them onto the rack to cool. I even transferred the cooled "crackers" onto paper towels, hoping that would alleviate the greasy problem, but it didn't really help at all. I have much, much better cheese cracker recipes.

Okay...perhaps I did something wrong. These were just okay. I thought the cheese left too much oil after cooking and they seemed doughy instead of crunchy. Next time I will make sure to slice them thinner...perhaps that will help.

These are yummy! They're like spicy, classy Cheese-Its. Mmm-mm! I served them at a party recently and got rave reviews. I don't have a food processor, so rolled up my sleeves, and mixed everything with my hands. Got a little messy, but they turned out great! Highly recommend them!

I'm so happy I found this again! I had this in a "Best of Gourmet" book from 1986 that I accidently donated to a book sale. Much later I realized I had also given away a great recipe. Can't wait to make them again.

This is a simple, fast, delicious cracker. My enitre family loves them. It is a great appetizer. They do come out greasy, so blot them on paper towels.

I've been making this earlier than 1986! I occasionally add rice krispies and sometimes I add a piece of crystallized ginger on top before baking.I usually eat more of these than the guests. It's also a good hostess gift.
