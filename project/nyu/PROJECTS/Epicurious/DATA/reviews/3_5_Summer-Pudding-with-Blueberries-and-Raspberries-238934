I was short on time so I cubed the bread and just mixed everything together in a baking dish instead of layering. The presentation was more like bread pudding, not elegant like the picture shows, but it seemed a whole lot easier, and there were no issues with dried pieces of bread. Fresh whipped cream also adds a lot.

Heaven. An excellent way to celebrate berry season. From breakfast with yogurt - to late night patio. Make sure to save some excess juice for finishing.

Yummy and so simple! It is true that the sauce didn't make it through all of the bread, but I saved some on the side for that purpose (thanks for the heads up, other reviewers). Next time I'll drizzle the sauce along the sides of the bread bowl before adding the berries. This is definitely becoming a mainstay for hot summers.

I've made similar recipes to this in the past. One I particularly enjoyed used pound cake instead of plain bread, so I tried that and it worked very well, although reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup to offset the sweetness of the pound cake.

I expected this dessert to be wonderful but instead it tasted like a plain jelly sandwich. I suppose if you like jelly sandwiches you'll like this recipe.

This is a great recipe - the only advice I would give is to save some of the juice to pour over once the pudding has been turned out to cover over any white spots.

This is an excellent recipe! It is easy to make, tastes like heaven and offers a beautiful presentation. The only change I would suggest is pouring a little bit of the juices to the bottom of the bowl before lining the bowl with the bread.

This recipe is outstanding. It is very easy to make and offers a beautiful presentation. I used Challah for the white bread and it tasted great. The only change I would recommend is adding a little of the reserved juices to the bottom of the bowl before lining the bowl with the bread.
