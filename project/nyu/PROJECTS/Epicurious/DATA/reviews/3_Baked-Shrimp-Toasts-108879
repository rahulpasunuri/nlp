I made this for a party and it got great reviews from my guests. Great for something that can mostly be prepared ahead aside from the baking. I didn't have any mirin on hand, and used a teaspoon of brown sugar instead, which seemed to work out fine. To cut 32 hors d'oeuvres from one slice is asking a bit much, I think. They would be very small and the mixture does not adhere to itself, so a lot would probably fall off in the process. Instead, I'd recommend distributing the mixture over about 1.5 slices and cutting them to be about 1- by 2-inches.

this is OK, but if you want a killer shimp toast-style appetizer please try "hundred Corner Shrimp Balls" recipe on this site. Easy and AWESOME! You will not be disappointed!

Delicious at our day-after-Christmas hors d'oeuvre party. We served it with French 75's, alongside bruschetta and stuffed mushroom caps . . . the guests loved it, and so did we. The bread is a small challenge, yes, but whatever you end up using, you can't beat the flavors of that shrimp topping combined with the crusty, crunchiness of the baked bread. A real hit!

Loved the shrimp mixture, but the bread was too much for us. As a veteran of the deep-fried shrimp toast school, I have found that the very thin sliced Pepperidge Farm bread works well, so I'll try that next time.

Fabulous.

This was a big hit New Year's Eve. I couldn't find a Pullman loaf, so I just got a loaf of portuguese bread which was quite firm. Maybe that's why it held up the shrimp so well. Also, because I already had a couple of recipes I was serving with cilantro I substituted green onion. It was delicious

Delicious, and very easy to make. It was a big hit with guests, who snapped it up very quickly. But for crying out loud, a 'Pullman' loaf?! Recipe purists will have fun finding a 'Pullman' loaf in their local grocer's bakery aisle, and the clerk stocking the bread had a good laugh at my asking. Rather than search further (undoubtedly providing amusement for bread shelf stockers from the Bay Bridge to the Golden Gate), or buy my own Pullman pan, I opted for a substitute white-style loaf, which works just fine!

Just so so. The shrimp fell off the bread, not easy to eat at a cocktail party. If you decide to make, I would do what the previous review said, grind it up.

It was wonderful, everyone loved it. The edges got kinda bitter because I wanted the shimps to be well done.

Just made this for a cocktail party. The marinade was delicious but even at 1/2" the shrimp just fell off the toast. Re-made it this evening (left over shrimp) and ground it in the food processor with a bit of white bread and then spread and baked--delicious and much easier to eat. Also, there's no need to add the salt. Definitely a tasty party food.

Pullman loaf....hmmm....thin crusted, square cornered, fine-grained, soft white bread - ain't it a Wonder? Now that's sophisticated, not matter what you call it!
