I, too, added more broth. The chicken took longer to cook completely. I also doubled up on the dill and added more veggies. Easy and quick recipe.

First off this soup smells amazing, pairs perfectly with a cold rainy Vancouver day. Used a bigger pot than they suggested so I could fry 2 slices of thick cut hickory bacon on the bottom. Removed bacon and proceeded with recipe. Increased the garlic, added 2 more cups of broth (4 is hardly enough). One problem I encountered was the rice sticking to the chicken when I removed it, leaving bits that ended up being much harder than others, will add rice after next time. Diced the bacon and tossed it back in at the end. Husband seems pleased!
