You don't need to look for another recipe.It is fenomenal. In addition... we brine the bird(from The Good Housekeeping cookbook).For 12 pound turkey, dissolve 2cups kosher salt in 2 gall. cold water.Add the bird and refregerate for 12 hrs.Omit the salt in rub/seasoning during cooking. After the Turkey Brith is cooked, we DO NOT discard the giblets and neck meat, but chop it finely(or puree in a blender) and return in to the hot broth.This adds a surprising richness to the final gravy. And you don't have to tell any of those picky eaters out there:))

This will become our family staple turkey recipe for the future.I've made it twice now with exellent results.The bird is juicy and the gravy is outstanding. I only slightly tweaked 2 things: 1)brined the bird (12-pounder)in 2 cups kosher salt per 2 gallons water for 12 hours, rinced, dried; 2)kept the oven temp. at 325' until done, followed by quick broil.

I made this years ago to rave reviews and then lost the recipe. I am thrilled to finally repeat my favorite Thanksgiving of all time. Both recipes for gravy and turkey are absolutely the BEST!! Thanks!!

My review is primarily for the gravy which was wonderful. As for cooking the turkey: I brined it in a mixture of 1.5 cups of kosher salt, 5 bay leaves, 2 T peppercorns, 2 T whole allspice, 2 cups water. All brought to a boil, simmered 10 minutes, then cooled. I let turkey sit in solution (more water added to cover most of it) for 24 hours. Rinsed, then patted dry. For roasting, I started at 500 for 15 minutes, then 450 for 45 minutes, then the rest of the time at 350. Made the turkey broth as suggested for the gravy, used the Port (used 1/3 cup rather than 1/4) and realized that Madeira would also work well. The gravy was a huge hit. Consistency also good, not too thick, not too thin.

Absolutely awesome. I mixed the herbs with the butter and rubbed it on the bird. The gravy was sentational and easy. Will use this recipe again.

Excellent! The gravy was just perfect even though I fudged the broth and used chicken stock. The gravy is also great with duck.

We only used the port wine gravy recipe. It was lovely. We never had any gravy so velvety soft, with a nice sweetness (from the Port) before.

Excellent; I have made this recipe since 1990. My children love the gravy.

I have made this twice already. The first time, everything came out wonderful. The second time, it was just merely ok. I think that the quality of the turkey is very important to this dish obviously. A quality turkey is necessary for this dish.

I guess some didn't like this recipe.I am wondering what in particular it was about it that they didn't like. I made it last Thanksgiving (Canadian) and it was very well received. Different tastes for different people, I suppose!! I will be making it again this year!!

I've made this a few times. My guests always ask me for the recipe!

I am with the last cook. I made this for xmas dinner and all I can say is that I am glad that I had another type of gravy and a rib roast that guests could have instead. No one touched the gravy, which was supposed to be the best part. I thought it was "fair" but would never make again! I can't believe the reviews that this recipe had.

This is utterly beyond the worst recipe I have ever made! I advise you to pass this recipe to the next unfortunate family who makes it for their Christmas Eve feast! Sorry!

This was the first time I cooked Thanksgiving for my whole family, so I really wanted a tasty turkey. I was so pleased with how everything turned out ---it was so tasty and juicy. I did put 1/2 stick of butter inside the cavity after rubbing the herbs in. The gravy turned out GREAT! I think the broth made all the difference. The rosemary and tarragon made the whole house smell good as an added benefit

I used this recipe for the gravy only and was delighted by the earthy flavor created by the port deglazing process. My guests were quite impressed!!! This recipe is a keeper for the holiday season. I must not fail to mention how easy it was as well. One note, perhaps because of Denver's altitude, I did have to simmer this for about 3 times as long as recommended to acquire the desired thickness and depth.

I experimented this Thanksgiving day with some new recipies just to change things up a bit.This gravy was great!! I put it over my traditional sausage/cornbread dressing. My whole family really enjoyed it. I also seasoned my turkey according to the recipe and used and Turkey oven bag. The turkey was perfect. It was moist, flavorful and golden brown on top. Using the roasting bag cut down on cooking time by 1hr.

Our daughter and her boyfriend visited us for the holiday. They offerred to prepare our dinner. This was the first Thanksgiving meal they planned and made themselves. They selected a brown sugar cured turkey recipe, a cranberry sourdough dressing and this port wine gravy. The meal was fantastic. I thought I would miss my traditional gravy, but not so. Everyone present gave it four forks for flavor and consistency. It was a memory-making wonderful family dinner.

I have to agree with the other reviewers. The gravy is fantastic. We had a number of guests for Thanksgiving and the one thing everyone kept on commenting on was the gravy. I'll be using this one again.

Absolutely delightful. I made it last year and it calls for a repeat performance.

I make the turkey according to a recipe I prefer, but I made the gravy and must agree with the other posters that this is the best gravy I have ever had! One thing I did do though was to strain some of the pan drippings before adding to the roux. It could not have affected the flavor as it was rich and the color was dark. I think it would have been lumpy otherwise.

I made this recipe when it first appeared in the Bon Appetite magazine. The gravy is absolutely wonder. I have misplaced the magazine and I am thrilled to have found the recipe again. Can't wait until Thanksgiving now.

Wow... what a gravy. I have been making roast turkey for Christmas for many years and although they've been great, they don't come close to this! I am not the best gravy maker around so you can imagine my surprise when this gravy turned out spectacularly!!! I didn't change a thing (except put my own stuffing in - breadcrumbs, onions, fresh rosemary, bacon and mushrooms) and my family devoured the turkey in no time at all! This recipe will be a family tradition. Truly delicious and easy to make!

I agree with the earlier reviewer, it was very, very tough finding that 14-16 ounce turkey. So, I just made the gravy (I smoke my turkey to a different recipe, my own) The gravy is fantastic. I received rave reviews from my family when I served this gravy.

yum, yum, and yum. This was pretty easy to make, too.

Even my father the gourmet LOVED this! Said it had the best flavor. I now use this recipe when I smoke turkey too. I will not use any other turkey recipe. DELICIOUS!!!!

I've been using this gravy recipe since it first appeared in the magazine in 1990 and can't imagine using anything else.

It was great! Next time, I'd be careful to somehow sheild the wings from getting too dry while the rest of the bird is cooking.

This is a very tasty and exciting dish to serve to your family or when you are entertaining guests.
