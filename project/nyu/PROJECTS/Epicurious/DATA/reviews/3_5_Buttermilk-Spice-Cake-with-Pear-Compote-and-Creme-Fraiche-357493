I like the taste of this cake, however it is a very particular taste that not all will like. The next time I make it I will separate the eggs and beat the egg whites to fold in because it did not rise very much. I used cardamon instead of star anise.

Even though I have adventurous tastes, this cake just tasted odd to me. From guests' reactions, I was not alone in my negative reaction. Thankfully the pear compote and creme fraiche were there to wash the cake itself down.

This is a superb dessert--easy to make and not too heavy. A refreshing change of pace. I'm not a big anise fan, so I used cardamom instead. Don't skimp on the pepper; it's essential.

I made this for my friend John's birthday as his main request was "something with fruit." And fruitful it was. The compote was simple to make (I added a little splash of Cognac to get it on its feet). The cake itself baked up nice and moist without being too heavy and the lime peel gave it an attractive light green hue. Using vanilla bean instead of extract was a big plus, though I will warn a little anise goes a long way. The spiciness was not over the top so I would say even people not typically wild about spice cake could enjoy it. Also, the overall lightness lent itself to a dollop of creme fraiche and compote.

The cultures in the creme fraiche pair nicely with the spices in the buttermilk cake and the pear compote looks very pretty when presented. This recipe gave me a lovely, unfussy dessert that is also perfect for breakfast/brunch with tea.

Guess I'm the odd one out on this one. I really wanted to like this - I was excited by the lime and buttermilk - but despite adding extra lime zest after tasting the batter, I really couldn't taste the lime. I'm also not crazy about the black pepper flavor - I wanted to give a shot, but that flavor stood out far too much in the finished cake. The creme fraiche and compote were nice though.

This cake was great but for me needs some tweaking. The cake was too flat, so I would either separate the eggs, beat the whites, and fold them in at the end of the batter prep, OR use an 8 inch pan instead of 9. Or do both. Since it's spring and the pears were looking sad, I chose to ditch the pear aspect, and the lime (which I don't get anyway) and change the idea to orange. I added orange zest to the batter, expanded the creme fraiche topping to a creme fraiche frosting with whipped cream, orange zest, and orange juice (just for fragrance,not to make it taste like a creamsicle), and then finally topped the cake with candied orange peel to replace the flavor hit the pear compote would have added. The cake was a hit. I would put it on you to-do list and it's on my re-do list.

It is but once a year I make a cake and this year it was this lovely, lovely Buttermilk Spice Cake with The Lot. Just perfect for late afternoon cake and coffee following Easter lunch... as the seasons change and we have time to chat.

We loved this cake! It has excellent flavor and it's not too sweet. The pear compote was an easy and delicious addition. And creme fraiche is fabulous with just about anything. We're serving this dessert for company on Saturday. And even making home-made creme fraiche!

Both the cake and the pears were extremely bland. I and my guests were definitely underwhelmed by this one -- I was excited about the great combo of spices, but I just couldn't taste them. I'd advise upping the amount of spice by quite a bit -- or, maybe toasting the spices first would have helped bring out the flavor.

Didn't have star anise so substituted the same amount of Chinese 5 Spice. Turned out great. Even picky kids enjoyed the cake. Definitely adding to my recipes.

This cake was easy to make and tasted light, full of flavor, and moist. The pear compote was a beautiful and refreshing accompaniment. We didn't have the vanilla beans, so I subbed in about 1 T of vanilla extract, and the cake was still amazing. Good recipe for holding the cake over till the next day or freezing and thawing for a later date. My entire family loved this, including my two year old.

A great winter dessert. The spice and lime were a terrific combination then pears and creme fraiche; wonderful and complex flavours. Will be adding this to my recipe file.

This recipe turned out just as described and pictured. The spices add a mysterious touch. Will make it again for sure.

This is absolutely a most light and refreshing dessert.It is wonderful to have the mixture of a light cake, fruit and creme fraiche.Follow the recipe to a "T" and don't overmix the cake batter and you will be pleased.

I LOVED this recipe - went in for a small slice and finished half the cake before I even know it. Even though I initially forgot to add the eggwhites and had to peel the rest of the batter off the oranges to re-mix, it came out light with a wonderful flavor and texture. Creme fraiche is perfect touch (make your own to save $).

It looked wonderful but was just ok. Too greasy and really just felt like an overly blond allspice cake. Wasn't fluffy or light and everyone in the house just said "meh". And we are big cake people. I could tweak it to make it better but why bother when there are other better recipes. Not awful but a definite disappointment.

This has been just the right dessert for some recent dinner parties. I love the lightness of the cake and the simple pear compote. Creme fraiche works best with this combination. The combination of spices, especially the ground star anise works perfectly. This recipe moves up to the top of my current favorite dessert recipes.

this cake was wonderful. a nice, light dessert and good flavors. the recipe is easy to halve and is served well with the compote warm. i also used vanilla ice cream bc creme fraiche is so expensive and i don't find myself needing to use it a lot, but i feel the sweetness of the ice cream was a nice touch to a not-so- sweet cake. i would definitely make this again.
