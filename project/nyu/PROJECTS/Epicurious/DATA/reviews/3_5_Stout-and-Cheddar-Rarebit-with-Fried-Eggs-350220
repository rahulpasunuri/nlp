My variations to make it more accurate and more tasty: used brown soda bread mix instead of flour; and used 2 tsps of mustard powder added: 2 tbls prepared mustards (1 tbl ea Mendocino Mustard hot and sweet, and beer & suds); 1-2 tsp crushed green and pink peppercorns, and added a total of almost 1 tablespoon Worcestershire; also added 1/2 tsp pink Himalayan salt. I used a local dry sharp dark yellow cheddar. We just ran out of Kerry Gold and Dubliner white cheddars. I also used a pale ale because I had that on hand. Honestly any beer/cider/broth to your liking will do. I rarely cook with Guinness because I am really fond of drinking it!

Best eggs on Toast you will ever have. Do do the onions... Very easy and adds the right zip. The greens should also be used as stated in the recipe..even if you don't think you would like it ..live a little...gain alot ..lol

This receipe sounded good - how can you go wrong with beer & cheese? - but it just didn't work for me. Followed the receipe exactly as written. Both my husband and I found the color of the sauce to be off putting. We tried it anyway and neither of us cared for it at all. The flavor of the sauce was just off. I think it may have been due to the brown sugar. Did not enjoy this at all.

Decent enough but not great. I was kind of hoping for more of a subtle beer flavor in a fondue-type cheese sauce. Instead I got something that overpowered all of the other ingredients and didn't taste all that great on its own. Might try again with a milder beer (not Guiness).

I am by no means a beginner cook and I wouldn't call this recipe easy ... it was a bit hectic getting the sauce, eggs, toast and greens ready all at the same time without anything getting cold/burnt/wilted. But it came out really good, very gastropub. Made it for two and had black velvets (Guinness floated on hard cider) with the rest of the stout.

Delicious! Made it just for me, complete with hydroponic watercress (only kind available at my supermarket). A truly delightful flavor combination: earthy with a touch of refinement. Substituted an oatmeal stout for the Guinness.

This was FANTASTIC! Made it for dinner last night and my husband and I were congratulating ourselves for the rest of the evening. I also used extra sharp yellow (couldn't find white) and threw in some parmesan as well. We also found that keeping the burner on very low heat while whisking in the cheese smoothed out the sauce nicely.

I couldn't find extra-sharp white cheddar--in fact, I couldn't find any white cheddar, but I was only looking locally. The extra-sharp yellow cheddar worked just fine, and we were very pleased with the result. We decided there was enough to use 2 slices of bread per serving, so in the future we will do that.

Awesome. I'm a big fan of eggs benedict and make a lot of non-traditional variations. Loved this sauce and the onions are fantastic in this. Also, it taught me a new word- rarebit.

Amazing. I was brave and made this for the first time for two couples that came over for breakfast. It turned out perfectly! There was nothing but praise and rave reviews to be had with this meal.

Absolutely delicious - very popular with the 7 year old too. Definite keeper for something quick and easy, and the onions were terrific - the other reviewers were right, dont skip them...

This was great and relatively easy. Used Sam Adams Octoberfest because that is what I had. Added some slices of Smithfield ham. Everyone loved it but all husband thought he would like it better for brunch. Onions were delish-- plan to use the leftover onions on sandwiches over the weekend.

It is still a shame to lose a perfectly good Guinness in a meal but we made up for it and drank to its memory.

I havnt had a chance to make this yet but i will tomorrow and let you know how it was for my poker crew. They eat anything and if they dont die i make it again. This really sounds good but i just wanted to say Guinness with no foam is like a chair with no legs. Just kidding cant wait to try this one.

WOW - the pickled onions are fantastic and incredibly easy to make. And the sauce is awfully foolproof too. This was a HUGE hit and although it was a wonderful dinner, I can see it making an impressive brunch too.

I thought my husband was going to lick the plate-- a huge hit! Perfect fare for a chilly fall evening's supper.

good, easy and fast. like the previous cook i also had to use mixed greens as no watercress was available, but kept the rest the same. really good pickled onions. good recipe - and you get to drink all the leftover Guinness!

I am a grad student (read broke with no free time) and this recipe was perfect - cheap, fast, and yummy. I didn't have stout or watercress or dried mustard, so substituted Harp, regular mustard, and a side salad of mixed greens. The recipe takes well to being reduced (I quartered it), although the cheese sauce was a little too thick. The pickled onions really pulled the whole thing together. I will be making this often!
