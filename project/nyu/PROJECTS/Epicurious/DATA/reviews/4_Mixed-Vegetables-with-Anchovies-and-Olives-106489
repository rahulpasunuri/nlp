try roasting all the veggies instead in a hot, 425 - 450 degree, oven. No need to salt, drain, etc. and only will need a couple TBSPs of oil. Roasting caramelizes the veggies which in turn ups the flavor quotient

This is fantastic! Good at room temperature (perfect for a picnic) and easy and quick to make. The anchovies keep it from being vegetarian, but I think non-meat-eaters will love this.

I didn't change a thing, it was great and will make it again. I will try and freeze a portion to see how well it does.

My picky-eater husband enjoyed this vegetable. I served pork chops with it and it was a hit. I used yellow peppers and added some mushrooms and a small amount of cauliflower. He ate a whole cup of this exciting veggie. I believe it was due to the kalamata olives and the hint of anchovies. I will definitely make this again.

This flavors in this dish blend together wonderfully and I loved it. HOWEVER, after serving it at Easter, I discovered that it has minimal crowd appeal. Most of the women liked it, but none of the men even wanted to try it. Men seem to prefer a one vegetable dish to a mix like this. Its alot of work and for me it wasn't worth it.

A very nice variation of ratatouille, good the first night and even better the second night. I did not char the peppers.

I found this recipe to be very flavorful. The anchovies added a unique flavor that was unexpected and delicious.
