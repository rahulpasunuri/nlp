i really want to like this recipe. i like quinoa. i really like oats. dried fruit. low fat. make it the night before, reheat in microwave, etc. these are all great things. i used dried apricots, dried cranberries, and sliced almonds. took a spoonful. hmmm..ok, not great. i added a scant teaspoon of brown sugar. that was much better. i will make it again because it's so healthy. i'm going to add some crystallized ginger to add a zing.

Followed the over-night recipe - easy-peasy. For me, I agree w/ other reviewers - the 1/4 tsp cardamom was overwhelming, even though I generally like it and doubled the cinnamon. Will stick w/ cinnamon alone in future. Also, the cereal was a bit soupy for my taste, so next time I'll adjust cereal-to-water ratio. Doesn't need any additional sweetener - dried fruit takes care of that. Nice recipe!

Loved it! Followed the recipe except for: (1) ditched the raisins (don't like 'em) and (2) mistakenly doubled the cardamom. Reheats beautifully through out the week. Great mouth feel. And quinoa amps the protein. Mmmm!

I made the recipe exactly as written. I must say I prefer oats alone and quinoa for breakfast does not appeal to me. I've tried acquiring a taste for it as a sweet breakfast food and it isn't sticking. Also, I guess I don't like cooked and plumped goji berries or raisins either! I did not add maple syrup because it was very sweet to me already. I have three servings left and will eat this for the next three days however, because it is nutritious food that will not go to waste.

Great recipe! I took the advice of limiting the cardamon, would not use any at all because of the powerful flavor it has. Agree with doubling the cinnamon, and the dish is sweet enough without requiring maple sugar. Great breakfast alternative!

Do you know they make rolled quinoa? It looks just like a miniature version of oatmeal. I asked our local co-op to get it and they did. I love using it!

Couldnt be easier! Dumped everything into my cheap-o rice cooker and let it go. Warmed overnight, so at low temp, additional water could be absorbed. Sweet on its own, no need for honey or syrup, however I did add 2 tbs of walnut pieces for the omega three high five. Feels great to have my whole grains out of the way at breakfast!

I halved the recipe to make it the first time as I didn't want a whole pot I'd have to throw away if I didn't like it. However next time I'll make the whole recipe. I loved it! I will halve or eliminate the salt next time as I thought it had a bit too much of a salty taste. I will be making this with fresh apple and raisins in the future as well as the original way. Cardamon is very expensive (apprx $35 a pound) but if you go to a store with bulk spices you can buy just the amount you want.

Made exactly XC for no raisins. Did the morning cooking method; cooked for 30min, stirring every 5. For me, it did need a drizzle of maple syrup. Would add less salt next time Good and hearty.

I make this for myself already except for the Cardamon. I have been adding 1/2 tsp turmeric. Sometimes I use fresh fruit and for milk I use kefir. Also I add 1 tbl chia seeds.

I have made this several times using the overnight method and I think it is great. I use double cinnamon, no cardamom as I didn't have any and used different dried fruits. This has come out perfect every time. I also have not needed the maple syrup in the morning as the fruit was sweetener enough for our house. I have also added flax seeds as well. The only time I had an issues was when I ran out of quinoa and used all oats. Then the water amount was too much and I had to cook it again in the morning. This has become a winter staple in our house.

Hubby made this for the whole family for breakfast this morning, using the second method (not overnight). The kids (3 & 6) both asked for seconds and we finished off the rest. Hearty, interesting, & delicious! HOWEVER, we only used the recipe as inspiration. Everybody in our house likes different fruit mixed in, so we did that on an individual basis. And we don't have cardamom so we skipped that. Topped each bowl with sliced almonds, extra cinnamon, and a touch of honey instead of the maple syrup. Will definitely be making again!

This is a perfect breakfast for hot cereal and quinoa lovers, and I have made it several times. The low glycemic index of quinoa makes this combo stick with me longer, adds protein and I do like the taste of quinoa. Consistency is a bit loose as some have commented, but can just be cooked a bit longer or liquid can be reduced. I like adding milk later, so I reduced the water. I really love the sweetness and flavor of cardamom and cinnamon. Used dried cranberries or any other dried fruit as well as the raisins. I also add a big spoonful of ground flaxseed and whatever nuts we have around. No maple syrup needed but it could be a very good addition for kids. Note: I prefer the cooked on the morning of version

Didn't have cardamom, so doubled the cinnamon - thought it had nice flavor. Only used 1/2 teaspoon of salt, but thought it was unnecessary - almost seemed a tad salty (note: I live in a low-sodium household). Added maple syrup to the kids' servings, but also found it unnecessary as I thought the dried craisins & raisins already provided the right hint of sweetness. Had no issues with consistency someone else mentioned - I boiled and then simmered for 20-25 minutes. Reminded me of a Chinese sweet sticky rice dessert - babao fan (8-treasure rice).

Interesting combination. I prepped it using the second method (simmer on the stove without leaving overnight) and used barberries. As an Iranian girl who doesn't cook Iranian food, I have plenty of barberries to spare. I think they are too sour to use alone: my mother didn't like it at all and my husband agreed that the barberries were a bit sour. In the future I think I'll simply use cranberries (I was out this time), or substitute some sweeter fruit such as figs or apricots. I liked the combination of the oats and quinoa as well as nuts and seeds, but I couldn't really taste the spices. The addition of maple syrup helped with the tartness. I found the result too watery when following the instructions so I let it boil a bit more at the end.

Really enjoyed the combination of the steel cut oats and the quinoa and its texture, but I found the spices, particularly the cardamon overpowering. I kept forcing myself to eat it until I reluctantly concluded that I just didn't like it very much.

Hmmmm! Love all the ingredients and couldn't resist trying this recipe. Followed it exactly (adding all the dry ingredients and the water and bringing to a boil the evening before and then leaving it overnight) and ended up with a watery mess. Tried to cook some more the following morning but to no avail. Might try again with less water.

I eat steel-cut oats every morning and I like quinoa in general, but I found the flavor of the quinoa to be a bit sickening at breakfast. It overwhelmed the oats and the spices didn't really help much

Made this for my husband and I for a Sunday morning breakfast. I didn't do the overnight idea, just simmered it on the stove. Added a little whole milk, pecans, and maple syrup when it was done. It was delicious! The spicing is so tasty, it doesn't need very much sweetness. Yum.

Great straight out of the pot. The cardamom is crucial to the recipe. Used dried blueberries, black quinoa and opted for a cinnamon stick instead of ground. The result was reminiscent of chai so future attempts will include fresh grated ginger, vanilla, etc. Presents nicely and doesn't even need the maple syrup.
