FYI: I brined my turkey in a narrow, tall bucket. 3 1/2 quarts of liquid only half covered my 14.25 lb turkey. You may want to consider doubling the recipe for the larger birds.

I thought this brine was excellent! It smelled just like pastrami. I used a frozen Butterball turkey and it turned out perfect. Moist and not salty at all. I also cooked mine in a roaster over and it was really good.

If your turkey is too salty it is probably because you have used a turkey which was already brined. The frozen turkeys sold in the grocery stores (Butterball, etc.) are injected with a brine during processing. Do not try to brine one of thewe turkeys.

While I have not made this particular brining recipe, to the cook who has had brining be too salty: It is imperative to use Kosher salt and to WEIGH the amount if not using the brand indicated. Regular table salt is much finer and the same amount versus kosher or coarse grained will make the brine too salty. I have brined my turkey every year since the Alton Brown article in BA 2003 outlined the process. All my dinner guestes have just raved about how good my turkey is and I keep making them think it is difficult - when it is the easiest part of dinner! Having said all of this: if a person REALLY watches their salt intake, brining just may not be for you - but your guests will more than likely love your turkey!

I've brined a turkey once and it was REALLY salty, how can I avoid that? Also the gravy tasted awful. I use very little salt in cooking so we are not used to salty food. I'd love to try this but am a leary of ruining Thanksgiving.

This is a wonderful way to ensure a tender moist turkey. I don't use the juniper berries ..couldn't find them ..I have used this recipe for years now and it enables you to buy a frozen less expensive recipe. We always get raves..it really is a worthwhile step to take. I dread eating turkey that has not been brined..
