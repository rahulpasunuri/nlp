I made this for my special friend and she LOVED it! She ate two servings and then said she was going to make it the next day.

I made this soup for a picnic for my boyfriend last year and we both really liked it. It was really refreshing and light - perfect for a hot summer's day.

I couldn't disagree more with the review below. I made this for my fiance and his friend, and they LOVED it. So did I, and I'm a big carrot fan. I tried it cold, and then heated it up and had it hot--it was delicious both ways. I'll definitely make this again.

The flavor of this soup was really missing something. Saute, boil, blend, and chill- it is too much work for a mediocre (and that is being fair) soup.
