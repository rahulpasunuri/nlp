This is not a bad bean salad recipe, and maybe the reason mine was bland was because I was lacking heart of palm, olives, and red onion so I made it without these ingredients. However, this is a very healthy and filling dish that could definitely be altered to your taste.

This is now a standard bean salad recipe for me. I often make it at the beginning of the week and then eat it over raw spinach with some cheese sprinkled on top for an easy lunch.

This is a nice solid bean salad. I'm always struggling to find a way to fit more legumes and fresh veggies in my diet and this does the trick. The colors are very attractive as well.
