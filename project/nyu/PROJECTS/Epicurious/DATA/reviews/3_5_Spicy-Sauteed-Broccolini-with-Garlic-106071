Delicious! Steamed the baby broccoli in chef's pan about 5-6 min (high elevation), meanwhile sautéed garlic and red pepper flakes in separate saucepan, adding broth and reducing a bit. Drained broccolini and poured over sauce, sautéing a bit in the pan. Yummo.

This is a simple, delicious and healthy dish. Will make many more times. Very nice.

Very easy vegetable side dish. Loved using the chicken stock, next time will cut some of the oil to reduce some of the fat.

I make this a lot, since long before I saw this recipe. It's a pretty standard Italian approach. BUT be forewarned that broccolini and broccoli rabe (rapini) are not one and the same as the recipe infers.

I served this dish on Christmas Eve to complement duck with braised red cabbage and prunes and wild rice stuffing with dried fruit. It was a simple, tasty vegetable dish that offered a slightly bitter, spicy contrast to the sweetness of the other dishes. Delicious and healthy to boot!

This has got to be one of my favourite low fat ways of preparing broccoli as a simple side dish. How can something with so few ingredients taste so good!? I loved this recipe.

I also used regular broccoli and the result was fine. Very good side dish, but I agree with the other reviewer that this is a weeknight recipe.

I made this with regular broccoli, and it was delicious. Prepared as directed, added just a sprinkle of asiago cheese and covered it to let it melt. Will make again.

I made this with regular broccoli, it's what I had. We liked it, but didn't find it all too special. However, it was quite easy, and very quick for a weeknight meal, so we'll probably have it again.

this was really good. i suspect it would be even better had i used all the ingredients listed. i omitted the pepper flakes because of my children, and in a flash i had used beef broth instead of chicken (i had 3 couses going already, one of which was the main entree...a beef dish... and so there was already an open can of beef broth just calling my name).

A good week day veggie.. Too spicy for my boyfriend (wimp- lol) and a little bland for me. I will probably change it a bit next time!

Pretty easy, pretty good. It would work fine with regular broccoli, at half the price, sliced into long strips.

This is a great side dish - can be served hot or room temp. You can really vary the spiciness of it. And the broccoli just soaks up the flavors.

I have made this time and time again and my family loves it. I can make it ahead and serve it at room temperature. A nice addition, but in no way changing the original rating of 4 forks, is to toast pine nuts and sprinkle over top at the end.

All of my friends and family love this recipe. Its spicey taste combined with the crisp brocolini is a great sensation.

Have made this quite a few times. My kids love it. But only when I make with regular brocolli or broccolini. The broccoli rabe was too bitter for their 3 & 5 year old taste buds!

I tried this recipe last night using regular broccoli. WOW! My husband and I were both wishing for seconds, which is unheard of in our house with broccoli. I can't wait to try this recipe with broccolini. This is a keeper.

I enjoyed this recipe! I left out the chicken stock and just threw in a little water. Serve immediately because it get cold fast.

This is the best broccoli recipe I've ever tasted. It's really easy, too. I don't do it in batches--I just saute all of it together. The spice adds a little kick.

This is a classic, and I make some variation of this (spinach, broccoli, reens) all the time. I have learned that there are two tricks. First, never, ever, cover the pan, pot or whatever in which a bright green veggie is cooking or it may turn into an ugly yellowish gray. Second, put plenty of salt into the olive oil in the pan when you cook the garlic.

To cook on 1-24-02, broccoli rabe is naturally bitter so it wasn't your imagination.

I have been making rabe for years. I saute' lots of garlic in extra virgin olive oil in a deep saute' pan. Add rabe and about 1/2 water, pepper (fresh ground black or red flakes)and a very little salt to the same pan. Rabe is a bitter green so if you do not like a bit of a bite this veggie is not for you.

Great way to add flavor to broccolini , Had lots of zing, I also did not steam separatly , did the whole thing in the same pan. Came out great. easy too

Is it just my broccolini or did anybody else find this dish bitter?

I have made broccoli rabe many times before but tonight I followed tashmowg's suggestions, and this is the best recipe that I have made. Key is saute oil and garlic, then steam broccoli rabe with chicken broth and then remove cover and let cook with great flavors.

It is a very tasty dish and I would love to serve it again

OmyWelikethis!(^ ^).Skip the ice/papertowel step. Drain and add to fry pan that has olive oil, coarse cut garlic and black pepper heated and wala. MMGood. Simple wholesome. OK, take it to the next level. Pour in fork stirred raw eggs and Pow! Top with roasted red pepers and carmelized onions. Family smile time. Thx for publishing this old favorite.

My suggestions: Skip the red pepper flakes and stock. Slice the broccoli rabe stems lengthwise so they're no thicker than 1/4 inch. Simply saute the garlic and rabe in the olive oil until the leaves wilt. No steaming is necessary. Then just prior to serving, turn off the heat and coarsely grate a generous handful of locatelli cheese over the rabe. Add fresh ground pepper to taste. The bite of the cheese is spectacular with the sweetness of the sauteed rabe stems.

You can really shortcut and simplify this recipe using a technique I learned about a few months ago called the steam-saute: Put the oil in a sautepan or skillet that has a tight-fitting lid. Heat and saute garlic and pepper flakes about one minute, as above. Then add RAW broccolini/broccoli (would also be great w/green beans, asparagus, or even cauliflower) with the 2 T. chicken stock and just enough water to thinly cover the bottom of the pan. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer about 3-4 minutes until almost tender. Then take off the lid, increase to high heat and saute until liquid evaporates, another 3-4 minutes. This is how I cook almost all veggies now. I rarely steam them anymore because with this other method you get such a nice infusion of flavors since the vegetables cook with the seasonings the whole time. It's really versatile since you can use whatever seasonings you want. Plus, less stuff to clean up! Anyway, haven't tried this recipe yet so I couldn't rate it, but I plan to soon. Broccoli is great w/red pepper flakes and it reminds me of my favorite pasta dish w/orzo, broccoli, olive oil, red pepper flakes, basil, pine nuts, feta, and parmesan. YUMMY! :-)

This is the only way I like broccoli. I made it for my husband since this is one of his favourite vegetables, had a little piece just to try it, and WOW! I can eat broccoli... definitely good for anyone who hates broccoli because you weree fed the boiled-till-death stuff.

This recipe is really good using green beans also. Instead of mincing the garlic I slice it thinly and I add a few mashed anchovies along with it. I is also a nice touch to throw some fresh chopped mint leaves and fresh grated parm cheese on just before serving. I have also tried this using asspiration (sp?) the broccoli and asparagus hybred.

I have made this recipe for years with broccolini or broccoli (often adding toasted pine nuts, ummmm!). It has been a hit with everyone (and how often can you say that?) and converted two old time broccoli haters. I have to be really careful not to overcook the vegetable or it can taste like limp school lunch broccoli. Be sure and use the peeled stem, too, if using broccoli. It's a bit spicy and nicely crunchy. I firmly believe everyone on this site should freely add their opinions and suggestions, but, Mankato, don't give anything a fork rating unless you have tried it. Go back to the kitchen with broccoli. Thanks, San Dimas, I will try it with asparagus.

Little House on the Prairie made Mankato, MN a popular place. I loved this recipe. I'm a garlic fan so I doubled the amount and I think I might add a pinch more red pepper flakes this time. I'm wondering what it would taste like using green beans or asparagus. I'll have to give it a try and report back.

This is my mother's recipe for broccoli rabe! What makes it delicious is the chicken broth in the last step. Yummy!

We live in the not overly exotic Louisville, however "broccolini" is readily available in the chain grocery stores. It is nothing more than the small shoots that grow from the stump of a broccoli plant after cutting off the first head. We can find it loose in the produce section or prepackaged in plastic bags. On the other hand, you could just as well use ordinary broccoli and cut the florets smaller.

To the cook from Mankato (kool name by the way) . . . we live in a very hip place food wise. Everything grown local organic including our meat. And broccoli rabe is not to be found here either. But I did try this recipe for plain old broccoli, the most perfect vegetable, especially with garlic, don't you think?

Rating: 1
I am rating the recipe without having made it. My problem is that I live in the Midwest. I don't know what broccolini looks like, and if I can substitute Broccoli for it or any other veggie for that matter. We don't all live in "hip" places where just about anything is available. Give us a picture at least.
