Gross! Icky! Ewww! My family ate some of this, but I took 1 bite and gave the rest to the dog. I don't know what went wrong, but this was certainly not worth the effort. There are plenty of other tart recipes out there. Do not waste your time with this one.

Used this recipe as a basis for a tart I made last weekend. Followed pretty closely, substituting frozen puff pastry for the dough, quartered artichoke hearts (unmarinated) for the olives, and my own oven-roasted roma tomatoes for the store-bought sun-dried variety. Baked thirty minutes earlier in the day, set aside, the sprinkled with parmesean cheese and reheated at 450* for ten minutes just before serving as part of a buffet. Great. Attractive and tasty.
