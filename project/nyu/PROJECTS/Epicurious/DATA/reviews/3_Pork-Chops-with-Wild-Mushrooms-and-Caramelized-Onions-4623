i agree that the process seems backwards which causes the flavors to get diluted. grill the chops, then do the mushrooms and onions while chops are baking. also a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar livened up the 2 leftover chops.

This was reasonably good, but somewhat boring... I think a lot more could have been done with the preparation to make a thicker, more reduced gravy. I would not make this again without major modifications to the recipe.

Love this! Used veal chops too.

I followed this recipe as written (even though I was skeptical) and was very disappointed. I think it has a lot of potential, but I question the methods. The first problem is the recipe has the cook saute mushrooms and caramelize the onions before searing and baking the pork, but you don't add them for 25 minutes. Not only do the vegetables cool, but they sweat, which dilutes the flavors and also affects appearance. Why not direct the cook to do the mushrooms and onions while the pork is cooking? It would save time and improve the recipe. But this speaks to a greater problem. A wonderful brandy reduction is made which would be great if poured over the pork right before serving. But instead, the recipe directs the cook to pour the reduction over the pork before baking in the oven. So the flavors and fragrances of the reduction are diluted with the juices of the pork so that the final dish is rather tasteless. If I made this dish again (I probably won't), I'd skip the oven altogether, grilling the pork, caramelizing the onions, and making the reduction, then assembling on the serving platter.

this was really tasty and moist. the chops didn't dry out even though i had to let two of them sit out for 6 minutes while i seared the other two because i was using a small pan. the final broth from the baking dish was amazingly rich. i used it as a base for a soup. served with potato gratin and grilled veg.

This was wonderful and relatively quick. I did make a few substitutions however: instead of brandy I used marsala, I used fresh sage and rosemary, I halfed the oiled and substituted butter for the other half, I used the mushrooms that I had available - nothing special baby portabella, and I reduced the onions in the marsala for extra flavor. I was a crowd pleaser and my family licked their plates!

This was an excellent recipe even though I didn't use wild mushrooms (I used button mushrooms). Other than that, I followed the recipe.

This was a great recipe, I altered it a bit as I always do, using marsala and dried wild mushrooms. Good basic recipe to start you off. The guy who used his Hennessy, what an idiot! What did you think would happen??! Yes, white wine would have been better, but don't give the recipe a bad review because you can't cook! Wow.

This recipe was a hit - although we I made this recipe because I didn't want to go to the store, and I had pork chops and portobellos. I used scotch and sugar instead of brandy as suggested in another review (great addition, by the way). I also baked everything together at the end. I served it with wild mushroom rice pilaf out of the box. Oh, and I cooked everything in bacon grease from this morning's breakfast. I think this was a real helper in adding flavor. I sed dried marjoram and fresh rosemary cuz that's what I got. No sage? i know. I just don't have any. I will make this again, I'm sure.

I am going to make this again just because I want to fine tune the recipe but like it was mentioned before I used fresh herbs (Rosemary & Sage) and for mushrooms I used porcini, hedgehog, shiitake & chantarelle (I work in a produce company and all of these are easy to get for me) the onion caramelized with the granny smith was a good twist and the flavors blend nicely even though somewhat complex, because of this I think this recipe is not for everyone but if you love pork & wild mushrooms this one is a keeper.

Wonderful and very easy. I substituted dried mushrooms that I had soaked in warm water. I used an instant read thermometer as my pork chops weren't really thick and they were fabulously moist.

Delicious! My husband and I loved it! I did alter the recipe on account of the thin chops that I had available. I reduced the onion, sage, and rosemary by roughly half.

Worst chops I have ever made. Followed the recipe, with homemade stock, shitake mushrooms & fresh herbs. Only change was we didn't have Brandy, so used Hennessy Privilege Cognac. I think it was the Cognac that ruined the dish. I do not want to take a chance with the right brandy. There are so many other wonderful ways to make chops. If I was to make this again, I would brown the chops on the barbeque, put salt on the mushrooms and onions. White wine would have been much better than the cognac.

This is a variation on an old recipe. I only had dried porcini and shitake mushrooms, reconstituted those with warm water, and used that broth instead of chicken broth. We loved it! Talk about earthy and rustic. My hubby raved.

this was wonderful dish. and easy to prepare.

Wonderful! ... but time-consuming. We used bouillion cubes instead of broth, and dried wild mushrooms instead of fresh ... and since we had no brandy, we used whiskey with about 1-1/2 tsp of sugar, which worked well. The leftovers were equally as good!

Super easy. Good return for time spent. Big shrooms took on a great flavor! Easy as pie, I glooped it over some simple white rice, and it was perfect.

This is so easy and delicious! The sauce is delectable. I served this with wild rice and put the chops on top of the rice and poured the sauce over it. Would definitely make it again!

Chops were very moist andtender and the sauce was superb. I served it for guest and they loved it. I used fresh herbs instead of dried which I thnk makes a huge difference. I used a side dish of a mixture of zucchini and red skins seasoned with basil and garlic and coated with olive oil. Delicious and complimented the dish. Also served a salad of mixed greens with dried cherries, nuts and gorgonzolia cheese. It all seemed to work perfectly. I don't see how anyone could find this boring. The chops were moist and tender and filled with flavor. However, I did use 1/2 inch chops. When I made it the first time, the chops were not as tender. My home was filled with wonderful aromas. What more could anyone want from pork chops

Eh? I pretty much followed the recipe. I omitted the mushrooms and used more onions (2 largish ones) for two large chops, but kept all sauce proportions the same. I used fresh rosemary, thyme, and some dried sage for the herbs. I combined the onions, sauce, and chops and baked all together, covered, for 30 minutes. There was nothing really wrong with it, but it wasn't really that special. My husband liked it, though. Maybe I just don't care for the thick chops. I might try the apples-onions-calvados method with thinner chops, on the stovetop sometime.

We used portabello mushrooms. This was very nice. We served with rice.

Outstanding!!! An extremely good pork chop dish bursting with flavour! Followed the recipe but sauteed 2 sliced Granny Smith apples with the caramelized onions and used apple brandy in lieu of regular brandy. Also used fresh rosemary and fresh sage which really added to this dish - both still happily growing in my outdoor herb box! Chops were very moist/tender and the sauce was superb over garlic mashed potatoes. Also served maple glazed carrots/parsnips and a lovely salad of delicate butter lettuce/oranges/kiwi with a lemon/honey/poppyseed dressing which all made for a tasty and comforting dinner. I really don't know how any cook could find this dish boring, bland and ordinary! Perhaps not gourmand fare by definition, but excellent nonetheless and would be a great dish for casual, homestyle entertaining - lovely colours/flavours and rich aromas that fill the house! What more could anyone want from pork chops?!

The recipe sounded great, but the family unanimously voted not to make it again. It was edible, but not that enjoyable. Tried the apples with it (based on reviewer input) - 2 thumbs down for the apples and one thumbs up.

With the ingredients, I thought it would be wonderful but did not find that to be the case. Very ordinary. You have too many great pork recipes on here that I would make again before I would try this again. The Pork Chops with sauteed apples and applejack cream sauce was wonderful. Also the one with balsamic vinegar sauce. Great!

I didn't have any mushrooms or brandy, but I did have lots of onions, apples and Calvados. I increased the onions to 2 large, and added 2 pealed, sliced apples when I put the oinions in. The substitution of the Calvados for the regular brandy only enhanced the fresh apples for a wonderful burst of fall flavor. The result was very tasty, my husband raved for days. A definate do-again recipe!

What isn't good with sauted mushrooms and onions? Otherwise it left something to be desired. Liked it, but not terrible impressed.

Used sliced portobello (without stems) and added sliced apple to onions & sauce for last 5 minutes. The apples picked up the carmalizing. Served with sliced tomatoes, lettuce the plate was colourful and tasted great!

I could not find any wild mushrooms at our ONE supermarket so I used a can of wild mushrooms that we had brought back from France. It was OK but it would have been MUCH better with fresh wild mushrooms. I might try it again after a "grocery run" to Denver for some fresh wild mushrooms.
