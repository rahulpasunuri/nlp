AAAAAAmazing! What an incredible dish! Props to its creator. I couldn't possibly put all of that sugar without feeling like I was making a dessert so I cut the white sugar out and it was still slightly too sweet - more like pie than sidedish. Nevertheless, the flavors of dates, chestnuts and apples blended so well together. A true hit indeed. This is now a staple in our holiday dinners.

Well, I modified this quite a bit, so it almost seems unfair for me to review it. I increased the dates to 1 cup and omitted the dried apples, chestnuts, and apple juice. I also cut way back on the sweeteners--I used only the brown sugar, omitting the honey and granulated sugar. Additionally, I added 1 T Calvados, which lent back just a touch of apple flavor, which I would have otherwise left out. Quick and very tasty dessert.

I love this recipe and have made it four times as a side dish- not a dessert. I have had trouble finding chestnuts so I substitute 1/2 cup walnuts and cut the sugar in half. Also- I use half a cup of cream and milk for the rest and it turns out fine. It's great with ham or chicken!

Made this along with most of the menu for brunch last Sunday. I could not, in good conscience, add that much sweetener (white sugar, brown sugar and honey). Added half as much and it was just fine. The texture of the chestnuts is not my favorite.
