I'm a novice cook and this was very easy and absolutely delicious! I will definitely be using this for dinner parties in the future.

These souffles are easy and delicious and I've already made them twice. I like them warm or cold, served with fresh whipped cream. I have served them with the homemade pistachio ice-cream suggested and it was very good, but as another reviewer suggested the ice- cream somewhat overwhelmed the souffle. The texture of the souffle is beautiful and seemed to get lost in the cruncy of the pistachio. I used Valrohna (sp?) semisweet chocolate when making these. Guests swooned. Delish.

Made these with the pistachio ice cream for a dinner party and everyone loved them. I probably could have left them in the oven for another two minutes, but didn't want to chance them being overdone (and it was at someone else's house, so didn't really know the ovens). No one mentioned whether they served them in or out of the cups; I inverted them so they could mush with the ice cream. (Sugaring the cups made it easy to get them out.) All told, easy and delicious. Next time I'll try it with caramel ice cream and sauce.

I'm making this for a Valentine's dinner party and wondered how everyone else managed to serve a warm souffle and ice cream without the ice cream looking like a green puddle? My chef friend said souffles are never served with ice cream . . . but I think this just sounds too good to pass up. I'm just worried about the presentation. Any ideas out there?

Easy,terrific do ahead recipe. Have made it many times now and it turns out a little different each time, but always great. Don't follow a set baking time,check it often and take out of the oven when still wet in the center(13 min?)-a minute longer and it will be a fluffy warm cake. Doesn't matter,your guests will think that's what you intended to serve. I've even improvised by using whatever chocolate I have on hand including cocoa(see the Individual Chocolate souffle recipe also on this site.)Dust with powdered sugar and serve with berries and ice cold creme anglaise or ice cream on the side{not not on the top-makes it too soggy)

This is a great recipe. Perfect for a dinner party because you can make ahead, and it's also amazingly good. I made the Pistachio Ice Cream to go with it - also very good. But next time I think I would serve these with warm caramel sauce.

Made this dessert for the holidays - family loved it. All were asking for copy of recipe. Was told it tasted like it was served at a 4 star restaurant. Loved the fact that it could be made a day ahead.

Wow! This recipie if fail proof! I have made it twice now (the second time accidentally adding the egg whites before the yolks) and the raves have been unbelieveable. Just make sure you purchase the better quality souffle dishes- it is worth it--your friends will think you are a genius.

This is one of the best desserts ever! Just be sure not to overcook it. Take it out of the oven after 14 minutes - after even two minutes too long it will dry out and lose its intense flavor.

I enjoyed the fact that I could make the souffles ahead of time, but was dissapointed because they didn't climb as much as other recipes do. I also recommend sugaring the ramekins before adding the souffle mixture. I think this would help them rise better next time.

Wow! I was trying to match a fallen chocolate cake that my boyfriend loves from a local restaurant (they wouldn't share the recipe!) and this fit the bill perfectly. I made it the night before and put it in four white French Onion Soup bowls, filling them 3/4 of the way full. They were much bigger than the recipe calls for so I cooked them a bit longer. Took them out of the oven while the middle was still a little jiggly and put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. It's not really light like a souffle, I'd say it's more like a molten cake. Everyone went wild. This is a great winter dessert.

The souffle was fantastic. The fact that it can be made in advance is a big plus. While I will definitely make the souffle for dinner parties, I will make a sauce to go with it instead of the ice cream. I thought the souffle overpowered the ice cream.

I had never before made a souffle, but was brave and made this one (with homemade roasted banana ice cream) for a dinner party. The best part was that I made it in the morning and baked it just before serving. Everyone absolutely loved it! Very easy to make.

I made the souffle sans ice cream for my mother's birthday "cake". I let it fall, and 'frosted' it with a chocolate-raspberry ganache and served with raspberry sauce. What a presentation!

While I couldn't believe a souffle could be prepared a day ahead and come out as good as the other reviewers stated - I tried it for a dinner party and it was excellent!! I made it with a raspberry sauce which gave it a little added panache.

I have never made a souffle before and this was a cinch. It was easy to make and absolutely delicious. I made it last night as a "practice" for Thanksgiving -- it will definitely be one of my dessert selections for turkey day. It was decadent without being too heavy. 11/28 UPDATE: BE CAREFUL!!!!!!!!! Made again on Thanksgiving and cooked maybe 2 minutes too long and they turned out dry. AWESOME if you do not overdue them. QUESTION: How do you know when they are done??? The center looked gooey so I cooked a little longer, then they turned out like warm, dry cake.

I made this fantastic souffle for family and friends (All of my Chef Friends asked for the recipe). I love this not only because it tastes great but because I can prep it a day ahead and pop them in the oven when guests sit down for dinner.
