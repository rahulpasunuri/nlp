This dish combines two of my favorite foods! It's an interesting way to use sun-dried tomatoes. It's a "guest-worthy" dish; something that's easy to prepare, yet tastes like a dish on the caliber of something you'd get in a restaurant. (I whip the potatoes.)

Recipe! This is not a recipe. This is simply mashed potatoes with a garnish.
