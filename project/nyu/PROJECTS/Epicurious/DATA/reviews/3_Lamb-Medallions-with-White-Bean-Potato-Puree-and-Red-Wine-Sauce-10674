My husband and I thought this was an excellent entree. The puree is fantastic and the sauce is great. I did not do the boning and tying since it was just the 2 of us. This is definitely a company worthy recipe.

I made this last night and it was excellent. The sauce was tasty, but did not overwhelm the lamb, whose flavor came through beautifully. I used leg slices rather than chops. The puree was delicious, too. My kids even loved this recipe. I'm recommending it to friends, something I only do rarely. Can't imagine why others haven't liked it.

The recipe sounds good... but it's not. If you absolutely must make it, don't dredge the lamb in flour, and only lightly mash the puree.

Mediocre-would double sauce and can use chop with bone in and works fine. A waste of a recipe for a nice loin chop.
