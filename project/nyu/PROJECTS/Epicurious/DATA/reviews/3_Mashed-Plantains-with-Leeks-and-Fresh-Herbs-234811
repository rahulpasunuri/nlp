Be sure to cook the plantains enough so they are easy to mash. I did not use the leeks, I only had scallions and I sauteed them with a bit of cumin.

Chicken broth, included in this recipe, is NOT VEGETARIAN. I would just replace it with vegetable broth.

This IS vegetarian, it IS NOT vegan, I think that is the confusion here.

Sorry, but this is NOT a vegetarian dish.

very yummy way to prepare plantains. the cumin was a nice spicy complement to the sweetness of the plantains. crunchy toasted pecans provided a good textural contrast. being somewhat conscious of calories, i subbed fat free plain yogurt for the sour cream, but i would imagine the creaminess of the sour cream would be wonderful, and i'm curious about how that would turn out. be aware that this is a pretty sweet dish, assuming you use the black-ish plantains that the recipe calls for. if your partial to sweet (as in, if your favorite part of thanksgiving is the sweet potatoes, like me) you'll love this. if sweet is not your thing, keep that in mind, this isn't as savory as mashed potatoes.
