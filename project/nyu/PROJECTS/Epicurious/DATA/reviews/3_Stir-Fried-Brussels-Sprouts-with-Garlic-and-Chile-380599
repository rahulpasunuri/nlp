Just a note that there is a recipe in the March 2013 Bon Appetit that is VERY easy and quite delicious - Brussels Sprouts with beef. I made it for dinner tonight and it is delicious. Be on the lookout for it - not posted on Epicurious yet.

I thought this was "good" but not "delicious" or "exceptional." Recommend that you cut down on the amount of nam pla (fish sauce) because it tasted...well...fishy. I recommend instead "Brussels Sprout Salad with Avocado & Pumpkin Seeds."

Good. Makes too much sauce; the brussel sprouts cook nicely.

The first time I made this, there was way too much sauce. The 2nd time I made it, I cut the recipe in half, except for the sprouts. I used about 2.5-3 cups. It was much better, the amount of sauce just coated the brussels. I also added some shrimp as well. I actually used the same amount of chile, but still needed more heat. The heat from the chile gets lost in the sauce. Next time I will use more chile. Overall, very good. I served it over the coconut rice from this article!

Only gave it 3 forks because it is 100% necessary to modify this recipe or it is WAY too salty. Thank you other reviewers for the sound advice! Summary of revisions (ingredients follwed by steps): 1 TBsp seaseme oil (sub 1/4 C Veggie Oil) , Approx 2 TBsp oyster sauce , 2 tsp fish sauce , 1 tsp soy sauce , 1 tsp sugar , 1 scotch bonnet pepper , 2 tsp ketchup , 2 tsp seasoned rice vinegar , 1/4 cup UNSALTED chicken broth , Handful of matchstick carrots. Mix sauce ingredients ahead of time (oyster sauce through rice vinegar) and allow to meld room temp atleast an hour. Blanch sprouts and fry garlic slices in seaseme oil as instructed. Enough oil should remain to continue to stir fry sprouts on high heat. Add sauce, heat through until sauce is reduced by atleast half. Add chicken broth and boil until reduced by half. Add carrots if desired (if not reduce sauce further to about 1/4 initial volume). Stir in garlic

I made this and used the revisions by by Calicoon. I agree the dish is too salty. I think it works best as a side and I'm not sure I'd make it again. I was underwhelmed.

Mom made this the first time and I loved it! The second time I didn't like it at all...

Super easy to make and customize for spiciness. My sprouts were large and I ended up cooking them a little too long since I was moving them around to incorporate the sauce. I added a little salt at the end and cut back the fish sauce to 2 1/2 tsp. Great side dish. I'm going to try it with asparagus next.

Made this for my boyfriend who wasn't sure he liked Brussels sprouts, and it was a hit! It can get a bit salty if you let the sauce cook down too much though. I think this sauce would work well with a number of veggies, or even tofu. Will definitely make this again!

Unbelievably salty! Cut the oyster sauce in half or leave the soy out altogether. Also much to liquidy, almost a braise in the end. I'd either cut back on the broth or maybe add some corn starch to thicken it. As is, it ended up being salty sprouts sitting in a brown puddle.

I love brussel sprouts. This is a great new way to prepare them that I hadn't thought of. They turned out great!

Super good, but I love love love brussels sprouts. I did add some Chinese broccoli and eggplant because I had them as well--I will definitely make it again. We ate with the grilled shrimp from the same chef and the coconut rice.

Made this to go with a flank steak papaya salad and it was delicious! Rave reviews from all. There was far more liquid than I expected and a 1/2 thai chili was not quite enough heat. I saved the leftover sauce and made another veggie dish with it the next night. Blanching the brussels sprouts was a crucial step -- don't skip it. This will definitely be a new staple recipe in our home.

The recipe was tasty, but FAR too salty, saucy and oily. I cooked this dish a second time, but used half as much oil (2 T), oyster sauce (2 T), fish sauce (2 t), soy sauce (1 t), sugar (1 t+), and broth (1/4 C) and it was MUCH better. I also used a whole jalapeno instead of Thai chili. I made this as a side dish as side for Christmas dinner with a baked ham and baked sweet potatoes. It went REALLY well.
