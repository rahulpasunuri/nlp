I was disapointed with this one. Thought the squash didn't go very well with the other veggies, making it almost too pasty and dry.

Excellent. I can't wait to make this again as a side dish. I had to use what was on hand, but this is an easy dish to improvise: I used 1 red pepper, no green; 2 cloves of garlic; 1 can of corn; no zucchini; no lima beans; and I used fresh basil instead of marjoram. Everything else was as written in the recipe (I actually had 2 crookneck squash on hand!). I did not think it was bland as one of the reviewers noted, but I admit I added a lot of salt and pepper. Enjoy!!

I made this dish the day before,not fully cooking the squash through so when I reheated it in the microwave it wouldn't turn to mush. I also increased the marjoram and madde a carbonara sauce on the side,alsoo the night before. As I was setting out the rest of the days food I poured the carbonara sauce over the veggies and warmed them in the microwave,the smoky bacon and light cream sauce blended very nicely and made for a delicious side to the Foolproof Grilled Chicken and roasted red potatoe salad.

This actually would have been pretty bland (two forks) if I hadn't added a cup of vegetable broth and let the vegetables simmer for a few minutes toward the end. That brought the flavors together nicely. I used twice as much fresh corn as was called for and it seemed perfect. Also added half a green chile with the onions and peppers, which made it nice and spicy. So with those modifications it was very good!
