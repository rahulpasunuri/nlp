This dough IS very sticky. I had better luck separating it into about four, actually creating the logs between my hands in the air (vs rolling on parchment or another surface) and then once on the cookie sheet, patting VERY quickly to flatten a bit. I sure agree: tips from the recipe developer would have been much useful.

They're still cooling, but I have to write that the dough was FAR too sticky and wet to make a log - this recipe needs some refining as to that point. Also, I am really surprised by the nasty tone of some of the comments. I think they're unnecessary.

These biscotti would work for Christmas morning with tea or coffee, but not as a sweet cookie. Two rolls result in large biscotti. I didn't taste the lemon at all. I most likely will not make again.

These simple biscotti style cookies are perfect with a cup of coffee or a glass of milk. The recipe was fairly easy. My only difficulty was forming the logs on the floured surface as the dough was sticky. I ended up forming them directly on the parchment (I used wax paper) lined cookie sheet. This worked well, and the final cookies were wonderfully crisp but not too crumbly. Mine turned out to be about 5 inches long, just like the one's sold for $1.50 at a nearby coffee shop, only of course these tasted better.

to Donna Weinberg: I haven't made these, but the method and ingredients are similar to those of biscotti, so they're probably relatively dry and crunchy. I'll leave it to you to decide if that's what you have in mind for the holidays, and whether or not its worth your time.

Okay, we've determined that the original recipe left out the hazelnuts. Can anyone tell me if the cookies are worth the time and effort to make? I'm looking for good Christmas Cookie recipes!

To the cook from seattle and the cook on 02/05; It happens from time to time on this site when recipes are printed an ingredient is accidently left out, or what to do with an ingredient mentioned is inadvertently omitted. Once it is noticed, the recipe is changed to make sense. This is obviously what happened here. So "hello" no one is blind, but you're both snarky. Shame on you.

are you people blind? in #3: "Then quickly and thoroughly mix in the hazelnuts." it's 1 cup.

Again, where are the hazelnuts? A received a big bag of the nuts from my father-in-law and found this special section, with a cookie recipe to boot...but no nuts in the recipe!
