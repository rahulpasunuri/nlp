Loved this! Super easy too. You don't need to use arborio rice since adding the brie will give a creamy texture anyway :)

Very simple, clean taste. Creamy from the brie, but not over-powering. The toasted almonds add a nice contrast. Would make again. Would pair well with a nicely roasted/grilled white meat

This recipe is incredible! I made a few changes, but the taste combination from the original recipe is the same and it is exceptional! Roast the cauliflower, and add half an onion, and keep the rest exactly the same!

the major flavors in this recipe work well together, however i altered it dramatically as other reviewers remarked on the blandness. some adjustments: I used 1 tbsp dried thyme, 1 tsp dried sage, sauteed with one onion, 2 good chunks shallot, and 3 cloves garlic. I oven roasted the cauliflower while toasting the almonds, mixed in 1 cup of frozen peas when the brie went in, and added lots of S&P at intervals, a sprinkling of cayenne, and a few handfuls of parmesan. It was delicious. Conceptually, a recipe with good bones that needs flavor.

This is a whole lot of cheese, and if your Brie is strong you might want to dial it back. Otherwise, tasty if pale.

This is bland. Agree with other reviewers that parmesan at the end does help; but still not enough flavor...

LOVE THIS! I have never attempted a risotto before this, but am so glad I started with this one! I was always intimidated by them (Not sure why?), but this was so easy... they key is being sure to prep, I guess. My husband helped stir while we caught up on our days... nice. The flavors blended exceptionally! I toasted the almonds according to Gourmet's advice, though I think a few minutes in the oven would have been better, as mine were quite toasty at half the time they suggested. Overall, an instant favorite - my husband must have bragged, b/c I've had requests to make it again by his coworkers.

This was fantastic. I did alter the recipe for my tastes and supplies on hand. Cut cauliflower up small. Sautee it with garlic, onion and sage instead of thyme. Used only a little bit of brie. Needed more stock than what was called for, maybe 1 cup more. Added parmesean at the end. Used toasted pine nuts instead of almonds because that's what I had. Was fantastic! Served it with seared sea scallops.

This was a dud at our dinner club. Perhaps we let it cool too much before serving and that affected it (as it was slightly "clumpy" when serving). But for that much brie and nicely caramelized cauliflower, we were expecting more taste.

I am a vegetarian and I made this with homemade vegetable broth, so I knew I was going to have to add salt. I followed the suggestions in the other reviews: I roasted the cauliflower with double the thyme, I added shallots and garlic and increased the brie and wine. I did use most of the leftover broth to thin the risotto, probably b/c of the extra brie? Finished it off with black pepper. All of my guests LOVED it (as did I). I will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe as is, as did all of my guests! I think the brie is nice because it isn't overwhelming and the dish is still very rich in flavor. I used toffee coated almonds, which I thought was nice little bit of occasional sweetness. I'm going to try this with my easter dinner in the place of potatos this year, perhaps sprinkled with some chives, but otherwise no changes!

I could not stop eating this and I did not change a thing!! I thought it was a great combnation of flavors!

Not bad, with a few modifications, like others have said. I added two rough cut garlic cloves to the broth (in a tea ball so I could remove them later) and Parmesan cheese crated on top for a little more flavor. If I had it to do again, I'd probably use something other than brie for the cheese. it is just so mild it gets kind of lost. I think chevre might work better here.

PS: cd1... the white wine accounted for $7 of the cost, darling. And if you'd ever had Dom Perignon, you'd know it's around $120 a bottle on its own.

Excellent with a few minor modifications - per other reviewers' suggestions, I roasted the cauliflower with the thyme; I think this gave it a much fuller flavor. I also added finely diced onion, the juice of 1/2 lemon to the finished risotto, and put freshly grated parm on the table. Will absolutely make this again!

Really lovely. The cauliflower and toasted almonds give you neat little nuggets of different texture and discrete but complementary flavors. The second time I made this I upped the proportion of brie and cauliflower and added a little grated Parmesan, just to conform more to my personal taste. That's the whole point of cooking for yourself, right?

I would definitely recommend roasting the cauliflower as well. Could almost double the thyme.

Not four forks as published, but minor modifications can elevate this recipe to very good. First, shallots (I used about three large) should be sauteed with about three cloves of minced garlic. Then, at about the time cauliflower is added, I added chanterelle mushrooms. I realize they are expensive, but I think fresh shiitake, dried porcini (after rehydrating) or even oyster mushrooms would add some earthy background flavor to this. Just don't add so much that you drown out the cauliflower flavor. More white wine and salt than is called for is probably necessary, as is a healthy dose of coarsely ground black pepper.

I roasted the cauliflower as many others did, so that it would be more flavorful. It was very creamy and delicious, as well as a nice change of pace, but it was on the bland side, needing a lot of salt. If it were served as a side dish to a flavorful meat, I think it would be fine as is, with salt to taste. But if this is the main course, as it was for me, just served with some sauteed greens, it needs the typical onions and garlic.

I used a cast iron skillet (Le Creuset) with a cover and slowly let the cauliflower caramalize and steam to make it sweeter until it was nice and brown on the bottom. The risotto absorbed all the brie and broth so I added more and then some extra salt. It was bland but on some nights, onions and garlic can be done without in a risotto IMO. I'll make it again soon. Here's a tip for quick risotto when you don't have time to stand at the stove stirring away: Use a pressure cooker as your pot, saute your onions, garlic and rice, add wine, let it get absorbed, then add the full amount of broth, lock the cover and bring to high pressure and reduce temp to low, then start the timer for 7 minutes. Remove from stove, cool under running water and open the lid, stir in additional broth and butter if needed and let sit for about 5 minutes - add cheese - Done!! Now ask me about my Tandoori Chicken and warm chickpea and lamb chourizo salad with tahini and apple balsamic vinegar if you are sick of bland!!

Exceptional. I can spot a good recipe and had to try this despite the previous reviews. This is perfect for an unforgettable occassion/a seasonal indulgence... served with a roasted winter vegetable, and buffalo steak would be amazing New Years.. hmmm

Oh, and yes, I also added about a 1/2 cup of fresh grated parmesan and then some on top for garnish.

I thought this was a really easy/good/creamy risotto. Made as directed except didn't have the almonds. Took a little longer than directions said but I always cook risotto to taste.

Why would someone use Dom Perignon, when this recipe call for white wine and not champagne. A recipe is only a guide line and should be tasted along the way!!!!!!

Made it exactly as written. Good taste though undersalted, but the mouthfeel was odd--I'd hash the cauliflower next time or zap it in a food processor a few times.

I'm interested in how this cost $50.00. Am I missing something?

Followed instructions to the letter. Am quite fond of cheese and cauliflower, but I found this dish to be a bit disappointing and bland. PS. Perhaps xCreoleQueenx might shave a few dollars off the fifty spent on this recipe by not using Dom Perignon for the 1/3 cup of dry white wine.

I made a two changes and this was delicious: I first roasted my cauliflower in the oven sprinkled lightly with olive oil. Secondly, I used my homemade broth with leftover vegetable and herb ends. Of course, parmigiano is essential with any risotto.s Was cheap, tasty, will do it again.

Having had such good luck with the last Gourmet receipe I tried, I was a bit disappointed with this one. It was pretty pricy, about $50 in ingredients, not counting the ones that were already in my pantry (olive oil, thyme, etc.). It required a lot of salt in order not to be bland. I liked it, but not enough to make it again.
