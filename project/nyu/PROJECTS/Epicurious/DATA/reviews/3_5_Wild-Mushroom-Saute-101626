Amazing flavors. I added a little more fresh garlic at the end and served it with toasted peasant bread.

Absolutely delicious and very easy, just time consuming to wash all the mushrooms. You MUST use a variety of mushrooms -- I used baby bellas, cremini, oyster, shitake. Served for a dinner party and will be making again for Christmas dinner. Enjoy!

Very easy, needs some extra seasoning. These mushrooms were great served on top of the Roast Prime Rib with Madeira Sauce and Horseradish Sauce (also from this site) I served for Christmas dinner yesterday. Got rave reviews from some very picky eaters.

It's blah, blah, blah. Maybe it's the mushrooms we used, but this had no great flavor. We won't make it again.

This is a wonderful recipe for mushrooms. Very simple, so nothing overpowers the delicious earthiness. All I had on hand were some creminis leftover from a barbecue, and it was still fantastic. I can't wait to try with other varieties. Other ideas to play with: add some dry white wine at the end, add thyme, or sprinkle with Hungarian paprika. A definite keeper.

Outstanding and easy! I served it with thin slices of toasted baguette on the side so that guests could make their own crostini. Rave reviews for not much work!

Very easy and quick to make. I've made this with 1/2 portabella 1/2 button, and once 1/2 portabella 1/2 oyster. Hard to find a wide selection of mushrooms at the stores I go to. Still delicious, however.

My adult children decide we needed a new traditional dish for the holidays. One being a vegetarian, wanted a mushroom dish. This recipe was very easy and got rave reviews. I did double it out of need for large family dinner. And because the market didn't have a big variety of wild mushrooms, I did use about half button mushrooms. I'll search for enough wild ones next time. It's a keeper and will become a new tradition.

Great, flavorful dish. I inadvertently used 1/2 the the amount of mushrooms called for and all of the parsley and garlic which is a mistake that I will repeat. Also used smoked sea salt (fumee de sel) which is good on pretty much everything. Used as topping for hamburgers -- with green salad -- a very tasty midweek meal.

Fabulous... a great compliment to a nice steak. Just like you'd get in a fancy steakhouse.

This is a wonderful recipe. I used entirely wild mushrooms - none of those commercial white mushrooms or criminis. Prior review says to drain off the liquid - please do no do this as you will lose all the flavors of the mushrooms. Just continue to cook the mushrooms and they will re-absorb all the liquid and the taste will be much better.

This was bland. I had 2 pounds of mushrooms to use up and the reviews had me hopeful. My husband liked it but I was underwhelmed. I won't make it again.

Wow!My family called this a definate repeat. They couldn't get enough. Easy enough that I am planning my party menus around it. Cooked according to recipe but used cilantro, instead of parsley, as another cook suggested. Added a pinch if paresean after cooking. Has anyone added a little bit of baby spinach or basil leaves to the mixture? Almost forgot: my first time cooking "wild mushrooms".

Reuel from Los Gatos - Although you can buy and farm Oysters and shitake's they are still wild mushrooms. I find them all the time growing in the wild. But I will agree with you on Portobello!! This recipe was very good but I added a little basil to it. I used White King Boletes, Oysters and Chanterelles - all fresh from my hunt! One suggestion - mushrooms are full of soo much water and when sautéed you will notice how much of it gets cooked out - pour this into a glass and SAVE it instead of letting it all steam away! It can make a WONDERFUL sauce. I will make this again!

WILD MUSHROOM SAUTE (SAUTE DE CHAMPIGNONS SAUVAGES) I will make this recipe again, BUT, my only complaint, and it is a pet peeve, is that the recipe calls for "wild mushrooms" and then perpetuates the myth that portobello, oyster & shitake are wild. Morel, chanterelle & bolete, yes, wild, spectacular & expensive. Portobello (crimini or brown), oyster and shitake are all FARM raised, domesticated and grown in sterile manure! I love mushrooms. Call a portobello wild? NEVER!!!

I USED CRIMINI AND OYSTER MUSHROOMS. IT WAS EXCELLENT. MAKE RIGHT BEFORE SERVING, AS OIL TENDS TO PENETRATE ON STANDING. A KEEPER.

I love this recipe. Used oyster, crimini, enoki, and shitake mushrooms, and drizzled white truffle oil over them half way through the cooking process, and served over linguine. Delicious

This dish is a great way to celebrate the amazing aray of mushrooms that are available in markets today. I use dried wild mushrooms where fresh are not available or out of season. Soaking them in warm water brings them back to life and you can save the strained liquid used for soaking for use in soups and mushroom risotto. Just be sure to dry the mushroom well on towels before cooking. Use cloth towels as paper can stick to the mushrooms as they dry. I find that it is best to saute the mushrooms over med-high heat using an oil with a high smoking point such as peanut or grapeseed oil, then, in the last few moments of cooking, add whole butter. The difference in taste is amazing! Cheers to the cook who served them in pastry shells! That is one of my favorites!

This dish was absolutely fantastic, and fun to make. I heated it up the next day over rice pilaf, and it made an excellent lunch. A definite make-again

I made for Christmas along with a standing rib roast. A nice side dish that is a little out of the ordinary. Will make again.

Awesome over angelhair pasta! I added 1 inch asparagus pieces (about a cup) and sauteed them couple minutes before adding the fresh morel, garlic, parsley mixture! Also added a little white wine. Nice change of pace from ol reliable of frying morels in butter salt and pepper!

I made puff pastry shells (just the frozen kind) and filled them with the wild mushroom saute. I served this with beef medallions with cognac sauce, asparagus and a nice cabernet sauvignon. Totally tasty!

I took the suggestion of Ben from St. Louis and made this with portobellos (dark gills removed) and thyme. It was great - my husband says four forks! Served it over spelt pasta which wasn't the best combination, next time I'll serve with angel hair pasta or even potatoes. Spring is coming - I look forward to making this with something wilder than portobellos, like morels!

This is very good. It's great simply as a side dish to a hearty fillet of beef and a green salad.

Served w/Fettuccine; think Angel Hair would be better. Also used dried shitake mushrooms; soaked overnight. Delicious.

Very delicious. For those who like variations, try cilantro instead of parsley - superb. Also thyme with portabella, hmmm.

I must have done something wrong, given the reviews of this recipe. Mushrooms release quite a bit of water when cooked. I did not drain them. The dish seemed somewhat bland. Would draining the liquid after cooking produced a better dish?

Delicious,I cut the mushrooms smaller than the recipe asks and used it as a topping on white rice and it was very good.My husband and kids really liked it too.I will make this again.

I served this dish with slices of Italian Pugliese country bread as an appetizer. It was hit at Thanksgiving. It's also delicious with pasta. My husband's making it right now for a holiday party!

In a word, extraordinary! Try to mix the mushrooms - I used chanterelles, oyster, shitake, crimini - for the most interesting and sophisticated flavor. Great for parties; Adds a dollop of elegance.

Great recipe. Very nice with Beef Daube. I have even made this with just crimini mushrooms when all the others were too expensive.

Wonderful side dish for a cold fall evening. I wish I could have found more varieties of mushrooms. I only had crimini, shiitake and oyster. I think more variety would be more interesting.

We celebrated our friend's high level promotion to the CA Dept of Fish and Game so fresh salmon was in order. The mushrooms were a great side dish. I think a half recipe more than adequately serves four people. I will definitely make this dish again.

Really yummy -- and excellent served with wild rice.

A wonderful dish. Its simplicity belies its taste. I made it with plain white mushrooms, shitake and portobellos. I think the portobellos are indispensable to this dish. I used kosher salt in place of sea salt (which I didn't have).
