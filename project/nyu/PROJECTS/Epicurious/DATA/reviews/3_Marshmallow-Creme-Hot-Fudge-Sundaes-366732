I only had 8 oz. of chocolate - 4 semi-sweet, 4 bittersweet - and kept everything else the same - it was excellent. I didn't miss the extra chocolate. The Fluff didn't incorporate well with "folding in" so I whisked it completely in and it was still fine. The chilled leftovers were like chocolate mousse and just as good as the warm version. This was very easy and way better than store bought stuff.

Yummy! Best ever! Used Ghirardelli chocolate and cocoa powder.
