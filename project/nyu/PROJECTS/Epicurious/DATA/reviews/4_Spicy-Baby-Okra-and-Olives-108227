This is excellent. It takes away the slime in the okra and leaves a nice crisp, spicy veggie. I had an abundance of okra in the garden, and no olives, so I made this with just the marinade and okra. It's perfect that way.

As an appetizer to nibble on, this is excellent! Be aware that, since this is basically a pickle, the salty and/or sour taste is *very* strong. I doubled the red pepper amount and in fact could have used more; a spicy kick suits this dish.
