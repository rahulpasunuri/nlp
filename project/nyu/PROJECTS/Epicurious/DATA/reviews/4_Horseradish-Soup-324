I love this recipe with the following adjustments: I usually use about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of horseradish (keeping the rest of the ingredients the same in quantity). If I get a dud batch of horseradish that has flavor but no heat, hot (not sweet) Hungarian paprika is a good fix. I use smoked ham or prosciutto in place of turkey. Grating the horseradish is a bear -- I have switched to grating it with the cheese grater blade in my food processor, and then running this coarsely grated horseradish through the purifier again using the regular chopper for a finer result. If you do this, the recipe is super easy to do.

Tried this soup after tasting a wonderful Horseradish soup at a local restaurant. Unfortunately, this soup is really just potato soup with a *hint* of horseradish-- so that it ends up tasting like there is something slightly wrong with a regular potato soup. If I was to try it again I would use far less potato and more horseradish.

very good. added 1/2 cup of shallots and less butter (3 tablespoons). The soup is not spicy which is surprising considering the fumes from the horseradish.

I added bacon--absolutely incredibly delicious. Very satisfying, and great on a cold night. The hroseradish isn't as spicy as you think it'll be, so you might want to add more.

The first time I had this soup was a few years back with our Bon Appetit Gourmet Group; prepared by one of the other guests. Since then, I've fixed it many times, most recently for our office holiday potluck...got rave reviews! I saute the bread cubes and turkey separately though; bread crispens up better while the turkey browns but doesn't burn. Be aware though that the "potency" of fresh horseradish can vary.

We loved this soup hot! It is truly good and could even use just a little more horseradish. Maybe my fresh piece wasn't fresh enough. Be aware that the smell in the house is strange while cooking the vegetables and white onions work in place of the shallots.

This one of the best soups I've ever made. It's become a holiday tradition to have this as a starter with our prime rib dinner. I add almost 1/2 cup shallots instead of what is called for. Very tasty.

This is really good and unusual. My mother-in-law made it because it reminded her of the horseradish soup her Slovenian grandmother made.

Loved this soup! Served it at a dinner party and it was a big hit. Might add more horseradish next time.
