Terrific cake, really really light. Mind the egg whites to keep moist, lofty peaks, and do not overcook. Narry a crumb left

Made it with almond meal instead of hazelnut. The result was fantastic. Great recipe, Thanks!

This cake was wonderful. I made a few adjustments, however; instead of using hazelnuts, I thought particle board might make a pleasant surprise for the extra-adventurous tastes of my family and I. And since I don't really like chocolate that much, I melted down an entire box of crayola "burnt siena" and just a pinch of dried coconut. And-- Oh my gosh, do I hate doing dishes, so once the cake was done, I just threw everything in the trash!

This is a wonderful cake for Pesach or any other time - when you've got guests with gluten issues, for instance - but what a lot of pots and pans and bowls you need to make it!. Let's see, there's the springform for the cake, the baking pan for the nuts, the heatproof bowl for the chocolate, the pot for the simmering water, the food processor for the nuts, the large bowl for the egg mixture, another bowl for the egg whites. Plus the necessary utensils and measuring cups and spoons. Maybe it's easy in a test kitchen where there's a slavey to wash the dishes, but not in mine. Still, at the first rich delicious taste, one almost forgets the sink full of dirty dishes, not of all which could fit in the dishwasher. I'd have given a four fork rating were it not for the kitchen drudgery.

I have made this dessert over and over, again, and it is always a hit with our guests. We have also made it with splenda for those who need to watch sugar, and it worked as well. My only suggestion is that you have to make sure not to over-bake the cake for a better texture. It dresses up well with powdered sugar and/or whipped cream.

This dessert was well received when I brought it to an Easter dinner during Passover week where guests included those who were lactose intolerant and allergic to gluten. I substituted margarine for butter and served it with non-dairy whipped cream. It was satisfying sweet at the end of the meal, but not too rich. I wonder if I could use a sugar substitute to make it suitable for the diabetic guest among our diverse group!

Made this for a seder last weekend - I used Ghirardelli (or however you spell it) semisweet morsels. I doubled the recipe and put a little more than half in a 10" springform and a little less than half in a 9" cake pan. They both came out great - I dusted one with powdered sugar and put whipped cream on the other - both yummy. I love the texture.

This torte is absolutely fabulous -- so moist and chocolatey yet still light. Also good with fruit and/or a chocolate ganache. I made one for each seder and the were both completely devoured and raved about despite the presence of other desserts. I am definitely making this again next year. I saved time by using 5 oz nut flour (from Trader Joe's) instead of making the ground hazelnuts myself.

I was skeptical after reading the reviews, with many reviewers using this as a Passover dessert. I was happy to find this is a standard chocolate torte, and there's no reason it can't be eaten any night of the week. The texture was great: light and moist. But there were way too many hazelnuts. We ate it with raspberry jam to cut down on the overpowering hazelnut flavor. If I made it again, I'd either use 1/4 cup hazelnuts, or I'd switch to almonds, as suggested by another reviewer. But I'd be tempted to go for a standard flourless chocolate cake recipe over this one, and just add some nuts.

I've made this every year for Passover, since 2006, to rave reviews. Fantastic. It just takes me a little longer to bake it than the recipe states; that may have something to do with my slowly-dying oven.

I made this for Passover dinner. I am allergic to wheat and am always looking for recipes that I can eat and is good enough serve to guests. This is one of them. I used pecans as I don't love hazelnuts. I also had made a mistake and made the first batch of ground nuts, potato starch etc with 2x the sugar. I saved it and patted it in the springform pan as a crust. The cake was moist and delicious, the top crackly, in fact it looked just like the photo. This torte was a rave, my 14 year old grandson 's review "it was moist and yet dry and delicious"

It was dry and dense, not like the description at all.

I cannot understand what I did wrong with my torte - I followed the recipe meticulously. "Moist, light interior" didn't happen at all. In fact, what I ended up with was a dry, crumbly holiday dessert that wasn't sweet enough. Only by drenching it with whipped cream was it barely passable, and even then no one really touched it after the first person announced it was good...if you like chocolate sawdust, that is. I am confounded by all the rave reviews of this recipe. I will never make it again, especially considering the work involved and the expense of gourmet chocolate. Disappointing!

Outstanding recipe!! Used pecans in place of hazelnuts for a decadent dessert. Will definitely make again.

I substituted almonds, corn starch and semisweet chocolate morsels for the listed ingredients and it turned out great. This cake was easier to make than some other flourless confections. It was also a bit lighter on fats and sugars than similar recipes so I felt better about serving it to my guests. They all loved it, and so did I. A few had vanilla ice cream on the side but the consensus was that the cake didn't need it. It was perfect with a good cup of coffee, even two days after baking. This goes in my "family favorites" folder.

Everyone at our seder enjoyed this. One thing I might try next year is to add some instant coffee to give it a bit of a mocha taste. And, it would be great with whipped cream on the side.

Easy to make, a good variation of my mom's version ( that uses walnuts instead). Every one liked it and the cake was gone by the end of the Seder

This torte was delicious. Next time, I will try to find already skinned hazelnuts, because taking the skins off took way too much time. We served it at our seder with strawberries and whipped cream (we're not that observant about mixing meat and dairy).

I also used 70% chocolate but next time will try semi-sweet since it was rich but not too sweet. Such a beautiful texture.

To the person who asked about a substitute for potato starch, if you aren't making this for Passover, and can tolerate corn starch, that is what I would suggest. Potato starch is usually used in place of corn starch for Passover recipes because corn is not kosher for most Jews on Passover.

A reviewer asked what to use as a substitute for potato starch. If you are not observant for Passover, you can certainly use corn starch, water chestnut flour, rice flour or wheat flour as substitute. Potato starch is available just about anywhere right now (Passover season). It stores forever. I'm looking forward to making this next week.

Is there a substitute for potato starch?

This recipe was easy and wonderful. I used 70% chocolate because I had it, and it was great. Served it with Homemade Honey Ice Cream and a drop of pureed Raspberry. Everyone loved it!
