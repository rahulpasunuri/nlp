Very refreshing. I just made the watermelon sorbet and didn't add chocolate or alcohol since I was serving it to children. The kids thought it was great and without the fancy presentation it was very easy to make. We will enjoy this many more times this summer.

Great refreshing flavor. I didn't make the 'chocolate seeds', just used chopped chocolate. I skipped using the rind and served in individual bowls -- with these two steps omitted preparation was quick and easy. For clarification, it's 5 C of puree watermelon. Will definitely make again, both for family and company.

Not bad on its own but this sorbet formed the basis for a DIVINE gin and tonic. Fill a glass with the sorbet, add a shot (or so) of your favorite gin and top with tonic. SO good.

Quick, easy, DELICIOUS! I, too, just chopped up some dark chocolate into chunks and dropped them into the sorbet for the last bit of churning. Seriously. Good.

Excellent summer dessert! It was a big hit at the barbecue. I followed other reviewers' advice and skipped all the fuss with shaping slices and making "seeds". Just scooped the sorbet back into the empty rind and used mini chocolate chips for seeds. Half of a 10 pound watermelon was the perfect amount.

All in all the flavor is very good. I didn't do anything fancy with the rind, I just made the sorbet. I also didn't take the time to make seeds, I just chopped up the chocolate. Creme de cacao worked very well in the place of sambuca. 5 cups of watermelon chunks run through the blender comes out to a manageable amount - my recipe came out to 2 quarts. Now I just need someone to help me eat it!!

DELICIOUS!! I didn't make it as fancy as the recipe calls for, just made the sorbet and used chocolate chips instead of making them myself, serving it in bowls. Brought it to a potluck and they all loved it. Next time I might try putting it in a hollowed out half of a small watermelon, as one of the other reviewers suggested. Don't forget the sambuca- it really tastes great!

Delicious. Easy and everyone raved. Made with mini chocolate chip morsels and didn't do the fancy prep in the rind. Will make again. Ideal for a summer dinner on the deck.

This is the type of sorbet one might have at a fancy restaurant and spend ages trying to figure out what the secret ingredient is -- Sambuca is the perfect touch! It's a lovely, easy, delicious dessert, and can be simple or dressed up for fancy occasions. I had issues with cutting up the watermelon, so the rind was not beautiful, but serving the sorbet in fancy martini glasses (with spare chocolate seeds arranged on the top) impressed everyone nonetheless!

I made a similar version of this recipe using chopped bittersweet chocolate instead of making the "seeds". I cut a sugarbaby melon in half and served the sorbet in the rind without slicing it. Easier & similar effect. I also wish the recipe specified when to puree the watermelon- before or after measuring 5 cups. I started with 5 cups chopped melon & it reduced after pureeing, so I added more. It was too much for my ice cream maker, so I had to make it in shifts.

Although chocolate and watermelon don´t seem like a perfect combination the sorbet is delicious. I also make a diet version without the chocolate, with a little bit of lime and equal. If you don´t have a machine try freezing it conventionally and stir it with a fork. It won´t keep shape but it will taste good.

Don't take the one-fork rating as a "thumbs-down"-- I'd make this again but with some modifications. Although I love anise in all forms, I found the flavor unpleasantly overwhelming (but I was forced to substitute 1/2 T anise extract for the 2 T Sambuca, which I don't have). Please correct me if I should have adjusted the proportions differently. I'm going to omit it next time, to keep the watermelon flavor unadulterated, and reduce the sugar too. I would also strongly advise using seedless watermelon, since picking out the seeds gets messy and annoying. Using mini chocolate chips worked well.

I made this today. I doubled the recipe and used one cup of sugar for whole recipe. It is plenty sweet. I also swirled Bryers Vanila ice cream with it. I tastes it befor putting in frezzer. It is to die for.

What a great summer dessert! I simplified the recipe by using mini chocolate chips for the seeds, and that makes it a snap to prepare. I also set half-slices of rind against the sidewalls of cookie sheets, making them easier to fill with the soft sorbet. I've made the dessert for several dinner parties, and it's always a hit. It's definitely on my "favorites" list!

I made this recipe when I first received the issue of Gourmet, and it is fantastic-one of the most impressive and tasty desserts I have ever made. It comes out looking exactly like real slices of watermelon, and people didn't believe me at first when I told them they were not. It's a LOT of work, however; it's worth it, but be sure to leave yourself time to get it all done.
