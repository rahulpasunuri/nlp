I really enjoyed this recipe. However, I did not add the hot taco sauce. Also, my husband and I thought the skirt steak was REALLY good even before the red peppers and red onion. We ate it with the black beans and cilantro recipe on this site and some white rice w/ cilantro. I will definitely make it again and next time I may forgo the red bell papper and onion (although that was good too, the meat was just more pure in flavor w/out it).

Wonderful marinade. Made at home on the grill.

I did this at home in a grill pan instead of a tailgate, and it was amazing. I did make a few changes... I stuck the onions and peppers on the grill while the steak was resting, and tossed it all together. I also used chile powder instead of cumin, which I didn't have. All in all, an amazing dinner, which I served with corn on the cob with jalapeno-lime butter, also from this site.
