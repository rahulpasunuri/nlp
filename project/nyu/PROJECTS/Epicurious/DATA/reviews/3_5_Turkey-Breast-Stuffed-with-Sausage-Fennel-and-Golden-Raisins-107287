I have made this in the past for family Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners, always to rave reviews. It's easy to make, and the flavours are phenomenal. This has become a standard in my cooking repetoire!

This is messy to make, but worth it! My family loves it cooked just like the recipe says to. I prefer mine served with a side of whole berry cranberry sauce.

We wanted something new this Thanksgiving - and what a treat this was. The meat was moist, flavorful and not what we usually get. We served it with port flavored cranberry sauce and carmelized onions. Divine.

This my 1st time doing a stuffed turkey breast and it turned out beautifully. My guests really loved it. Thanks to all the reviews, I made quite a few changes. I sauteed vidalia onion, fennell, dried cranberries, golden raisins, minced garlic, fennel seed, brown sugar, salt and pepper until fully cooked. Proceeded to add the sausage but only partially cooked it. I used chicken broth and white wine for basting. I cooked at 450 for 20 minutes to brown and then turned down to 400 for 1 hour and 40 minutes. I will most definitely make this again. Thanks everyone to all of your great advice.

The comments I got from this dish were "divine" and "a party in my mouth". I used the reviewer suggestion to add chopped spinach, also threw in a little celery to subsitute for a few green onions. I made a gravy by roasting the breast carcass and deglazing with Madeira, some 2 buck Chuck and chicken broth. Yum! Decreased the fennel to 2 tsp, still had a good fennel flavor.

I've been wanting to make this turkey for the last two years but havn't had the chance. I found a very high quality Italian sausage that had lots of fennel seed in it so I didn't add any extra.Instead of the raisins I used well drained and squeezed spinach and toasted pinenuts for the filling, It came out so juicy and tender and everyone loved the filling.I served it with a port wine gravy that I made from the dark roasted breast carcess,which I made a stock from. Can't wait to eat the leftovers. Try this one you'll like it.

So much easier and just as tasty as a traditional whole turkey and we still had left overs!

The first time i made this, i wasn't able to find a whole turkey breast, so instead of one big roll, i ended up with several small "logs". tasted the same, wonderful. my girlfriends were still impressed. just had to adjust the baking time. the second time around, i used a full (one piece) turkey breast, and wow, what a difference in presentation. has a very dramatic look, and everyone raved. used other comments by substituting raisins with cranberries, added spinach, sage and thyme.

I made this rsausage stuffed tureky breast recipe along side another spinach and mushrooms stuffed turkey breast for a large crowd at Thanksgiving. Both got great reviews from guests. I incorporated a bit of finely shopped fresh fennel into the stuffing in addition to the fennel seeds. It was still quite mild. In fact, I would like to have had a bit more flavor, either spicy or sweet.. but overall it was good.

I made this for my boyfriend for Thanksgiving supper. I followed the recipe except I used rosemary instead of fennel, used basil/garlic sausage instead of the Italian sausage and bought 2 - 1 1/2 pound turkey breasts. They were moist, tender, and looked elegant and delicious! Went excellent with our Zinfandel!

Served 5 adults, 4 kids for Thanksgiving - made three, one was left over- went with pre-packed Butterball breasts- which , when you open the packages, can be several odd sized pieces, making assembly difficult- used chicken sausage- I am sure it would be even better with all the fat flavouring from "real" sausage. Followed the other reviews and basted furiously with as much sotck as the pan would hold, yet fell short on the amount of gravy it yielded. Also added a little chopped fennel bulb. All in all a great, easy dish that looks good on the table

Like the cook from Seattle, I could only get 4lb half turkey breasts, so I put in two lengthwise slits for the stuffing. It is really a lovely way to prepare turkey but you need to watch the temp and basting to get a moist bird.

This was perfect for an easy Thanksgiving dinner. It was delicious and smelled wonderful. However you still have to baste it regularly as you would a whole turkey to make sure it's moist. Have plenty of broth on hand (more than the recipe calls for) and baste every 15-20 minutes. your turkey will be moist and the drippings will help make a delicious base for a pan gravy.

This recipe worked out well for my small Thanksgiving dinner - I made a few variations - I used a 2 lb. breast and after slicing it open and pounding it down, I layered it with thinly sliced prosciutto, spinach and dried cranberries. It rolled up very easily and the final presentation was beautiful. I served it alongside roasted root vegetables, berry sauce, and a green salad. It was all so easy, I had nothing to do once the guests arrived - a great way to entertain!

This was pretty good, but I'm not sure it was worth the trouble. The sausage mixture smelled wonderful, but it was a little dry. I also think "rolling" the breast is a little optimistic--I ended up pounding it down to about an inch, and even then it was too thick to roll around the stuffing. Ended up just cutting it into two pieces (a top and bottom, basically) and tying them together. It maintained a rolled shape when I cut it, fortunatel. It was okay. Leftovers were perhaps better, served with mashed potatoes. Also not sure the onion adds a lot.

This is a great recipe, very easy and can be made up ahead. Plan easy side dishes like roasted butternut squash with apples and walnuts and steamed green beans. Put it in the oven 30 minutes before guests arrive. I've served this three times now and it's always a hit. TIP--I always use more broth than the recipe calls for, white wine would be a good addition. Also, next time I'll try fresh fennel in the stuffing. It doesn't matter if the turkey breast is whole with the skin attached or if it has been cut into two pieces, it gets tied together anyway. This recipe is a keeper!

The moistest turkey breast I've ever made! Did it once, as the recipe is written. Did it again with andouille, scallions and apple. As another cook suggested, I added white wine to the stock. My husband thought it was even better cold the next day.

This was terrible - just some big glop of sausage in the middle of the breast. I was very disappointed.

I took some of the advice and added some twists of my own. I added frozen spinach, chopped apples, and sage. I left out the fennel. I substituted plain sausage for italian sausage, and red onions for green. I also pre-cooked the sausage/onion mixture until the onions softened (about 3-4 minutes). I added the apples and raisins after I took it off the heat. I let the mixture cool before stuffing. Also, because the stuffing was cooked the breast only took about 1:20 to fully cook. Oh - true to form, I ran short of chicken stock so I mixed half white wine/stock for basting. I added some veggies to the bottom of the pan and mashed it all together for a great gravy to serve with it. The end result was an extremely juicy and tasty turkey breast- even the second day! Highly recommended!

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I substituted dryed cranberries and added sage and thyme as well as a little spinach. It tasted great and it was super easy. YUM!

I've made this recipe several times and have always had success with it--including rave reviews from guests! No one at my table had ever had anything quite like it! Like a previous writer, I have had problems with timing; it took more like 2 hours. Also, the first time I made it I accidentally put all the fennel in the sausage (another writer did that, too!)--the directions make this easy to do! But it tastes just as good!

Very tasty and easy to make. I think the recipe may be better with ground fennel in the stuffing instead of the seeds. By mistake I put the entire amount of fennel into the stuffing, but it still tastes great. Had only 1 problem - it took 2 hours (instead of 1 hr 20 min) to get the stuffing to 155 degrees, but the turkey did not dry out, although it was just a little drier than I would have liked it. Anyone else had a problem with timing?

I thought this was a great recipe. It's just the two of us for thanksgiving so I don't need a whole turkey. Served with chestnut cornbread, broccoli casserole and pear gingerbread cake.

Too oniony for my taste, and not very pretty. The stuffing looks kinda like head cheese when you slice it.

Rating: 3
Really pretty and really easy except I bought the turkey breast frozen and so had to debone it myself. That meant some slices were mostly turkey and some were mostly sausage. I thought the fennel might be overpowering but it was just right. I thickend the pan juices for gravy and served with mashed potatoes. Yummy! (I need to practice the deboning to get it smoother)

WONDERFUL MEAL!!! MADE FOUR OF THESE FOR A PARTY, ALONG WITH MY FAVORITE PRIME RIB RECIPE. MADE TWO WITH HOT SAUSAGE AND TWO REGULAR. I HEARD NOTHING BUT RAVES FROM EVERYONE. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT I EVER ENDED UP WITH PRIME RIB LEFTOVERS!!!

This turned out very well. I made two of them for Thanksgiving with friends. Such a hit, one of them had me make one for their Christmas dinner. Making it the night before really helps ease the day-of timing issues.

Sensational thanksgiving. This turkey was beautiful, moist, and EASY -- to prepare, to cook, to serve, and keep as leftovers. It was absolutely perfect. My turkey, the smallest our butcher had, was nearly 8 pounds, and thus took much longer to cook than the recipe. Regular basting and poking with the meat thermometer were key.

EXCELLENT!!!! This is the best turkey recipe I have ever tried! The meat was really juicy and the stuffing was AWESOME! And best of all...SO SIMPLE!

This dish was really delicious. The turkey breast I got was actually a 3 lb. 1/2 turkey breast. Rather that rolling with the stuffing I made 2 lengthwise slices in the breast for stuffing. It worked great. Also I heated the oven to 450 for the first 20 min. to brown the outside before turning down the heat. Turned out perfect
