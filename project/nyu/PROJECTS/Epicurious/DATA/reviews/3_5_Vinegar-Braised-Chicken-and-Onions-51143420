Delicious! I cut the recipe in half since 5 lbs of chicken is a heck of a lot of chicken. The flavor was fantastic though and this will definitely be one of my go-to dishes for entertaining.

Made it last night afrer looking at it for a while on the computer. Turned out great! I used a combo or pearl and Cippolina onions. Vinegar was perfect, not too heavy or tart. Sweetness of the raisin made the perfect balance.

My husband and I love vinegar and thought this was delicious. Made exactly as written except adding some sautéed mushrooms at the end. Tasted even better the next day for lunch.

Very good, we had to use red wine vinegar since we did not have sherry vinegar. Still good.

I made this recipe last night for dinner nd would make it again. Plenty left over for the following day. It made a lot more sauce than I anticipated and would probably do the reduction with the vinegar next time.

While this recipe may require a special affinity for the tangy grab of vinegar, my family thought it was fantastic. I used cipolline onions instead of the pearl variety, and they were just divine. The raisins plumped up and were wonderful nuggets of sweetness (a great contrast to the tart sauce.) The only complaint I have would be in the quasi-peeling of the blanched onions (tedious job, consumed too much of my already limited time). Mine didn't exactly just slip effortlessly out of their skins. Anyway, this job can be avoided if you can find frozen pearl onions at the grocery store (which is what I will do next time). I'm sure they would work as well as fresh ones. For those who feel this recipe is too tart/sour, I would recommend adding a tsp. of brown sugar -- that would probably soften it somewhat. Or, perhaps cooking down the balsamic vinegar and using it as a reduction -- there's plenty of liquid at the end of the process anyway. The reduction would inject a natural sweetness that would also temper the tang somewhat. Anyway, we enjoyed this one thoroughly!

Excellent balance of sweet (balsamic, raisins, onions) and savory (wine vinegar). I had a sizable leftover so I cut up the chicken (bite-size)and used it with the gravy as a sauce for pasta. It worked so well that I may do this with the freshly cooked dish next time I make it.

Won't make this recipe again. It sounded delicious.Did everything as the recipe said. Added 2 additional cloves of garlic and seasoned the chicken with sage as well as S&P. I found the taste bland and as others pointed out too vinegar like. I'm hoping the leftovers will be better tomorrow. Disappointing.

Absolutely excellent! I have a feeling the quality of the meal may depend on the quality of the ingredients...I used excellent red wine vinegar that really makes the difference. Just Costco balsamic. All 3 of my kids, including a 3 year old, said, "Wow, this is delicious! Thank you for making it!" My husband asked me to come save the recipe immediately. The only differences: Lots of roughly cut garlic and I used skinless, boneless thighs (10). Still seared with lots of s&p on them. Delicious and not greasy. Served over rotini noodles to soak up the sauce, and with asparagus. Yummy!

We loved it! Made pretty much as per recipe and it was great. Served it with a simple risotto and pan roasted asparagus. Will definitely make it again.

My husband loved this. I browned the onions and chicken and threw everything in the crock pot on high for 1 hour. Reduced the sauce by half. Delicious!

I thought I was going to love this. I like dishes that are fairly heavy on the vinegar. I thought this one was too heavy. It's definitely good so you if it tickles your fancy it's worth a try. I'm glad I tried it but I don't think I'll be making it again. There's just too many excellent braised chicken combos.

Any suggestions what to serve with this recipe? I am going to make it tomorrow night.

Thought this looked like a scary amount of vinegar for a sauce but it was absolutely delicious. Perhaps the onions and raisins added sweetness as it cooked. I was a bit tight for time and saw that this takes and hour and a quarter in all, but I was easily able to shave off a few minutes at each step. Browned chicken thighs for 8 minutes and simmered entire dish for 30 minutes only. Everything was fully cooked and this dish was a huge hit. Will definitely make again.

Please let us know if this would work in a crock pot!

I halved everything in the recipe except for the chicken. For the chicken, I only used about 1.5 pounds. I also used prosciutto rather than pancetta. I ended up taking the chicken out of the pan when done cooking and leaving the remaining ingredients in so that the sauce could simmer down. It turned out very well!

Which is the better choice for this recipe white or red balsamic vinegar. Thanks

You're the one adding the salt and sugar, lady from Antioch. Doesn't that give you a clue about "nutritional content"?

Rating: 0
is there a reason there are never any nutritional facts on any recipes? I want to know sodium and sugar amounts before I make a recipe. thanks

Question: Has anyone tried this in a slow cooker? Would it work?

This is my kind of recipe - great flavor for not a lot of effort.

How did you know I had chicken legs thawing out and had all these ingredients except pancetta and golden raisins? This is on the menu tonight. I will be browning the chicken in olive oil/butter combo and will just have to do without the pancetta. Instead of golden raisins, regular raisins will suffice. Thank you!

NimifromKenya-- I think some mushrooms, or mushroom broth, or dried mushroom powder would make an interesting substitution, adding some umami flavor without the pork.

Rating: 0
A question...since we don't eat pork, what can we use to enhance the flavor?

Rating: 4
Excellent....but I used three pounds (approx.) chicken and three cups chicken broth.

This recipe was delicious. It was fairly labor intensive, but worth it. I used pearl onions and it came out great. I used a mix of dark and white meat and all came out tender and juicy.

This was truly great - perfect balance of sweet and tart. I made it exactly as written, using homemade chicken stock and cipolline onions, except that I used only legs and thighs.
