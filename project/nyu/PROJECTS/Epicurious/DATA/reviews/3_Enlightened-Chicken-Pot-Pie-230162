Ugh, bland and boring. Flavors never melded into anything surpassing the raw ingredients -- you're just eating a pile of chopped-up vegetables with a gummy, overly sweet topping. Next time I'll stick to a classic recipe that truly satisfies!

This turned out to be a very tasty and satisfying low-fat meal. A caveat, however: did anyone notice that the recipe never told you to combine the constarch/milk/vegs mixture with the potato/onion/broth/thyme mixture? OK, I can hear you saying, just mix them all together, dummy!, but I got the best result when I added the cornstarch/milk/vegs TO the potato/onion/broth/thyme mixture. This is a rather time-consuming recipe, so you might want to divide it into individual servings and freeze them without the topping, which is easy to make and the best part of the meal!

I like this recipe...have been craving chicken pot pie but refuse to serve such a typically high-fat food in my house! Cooked the onion and mushrooms in a dash of olive oil and de-glazed with a little white wine to add flavor. Then added the broth and chicken. I added extra broth and simmered grilled chicken breasts for an hour (or more?) so they ended up shredded rather than diced, which I prefer. I skipped the peppers as I use them enough in other cooking. Did individual pot pies in smaller glass dishes...everyone loved it! The Bisquick is a wonder...will be using the same concept next summer for cobbler topping!

Yech! This is just SOOOO bland, even for a healthy, low-fat recipe. The consistency was thick, gunky and tasteless. It's also far too much work for a basic weeknight meal. The only bright spot was the Bisquick crust: It was so tasty that it was hard to believe it was low-fat. I wouldn't make it again, although I'm still seeking a healthy chicken pot-pie.

This is pretty wholesome stuff. It's thick, warm and relatively healthy. I went with the veggies the recipe suggested and it was very good, but you could subsitute. The bisquick on top was great!

I was uncertain about the Bisquick too, so I used instant crescent rolls instead. Delicious!
