This recipe was a big hit with my dinner guests who practically ate it by the spoonful! The dip has a delicate flavor that beautifully complements raw, fresh vegetables. The pale green color against the vegetables makes a lovely presentation. Based on other reviews, I used the lemon zest as the main lemon flavor note and sharply reduced the amount of lemon juice from 2 tblspns to 1 tspn (I was prepared to add more juice in small increments but didn't need it.) I also added in an additional 2 tblspns of pesto to improve the balance among the flavors. I didn't use salt or pepper at all. I noticed that when the dip is at room temperature the flavors all meld together. When the dip is chilled, the goat cheese predominates.

I added extra lemon and pesto, but it was still overwhelmed by the flavor of the veggies. I just wasn't worth it. It wasn't bad, and it tasted better on crackers. Overall, just not the best choice for crudite dip.

I brought this to a dinner party and it was a hit! It tastes delicious with veggies as well as with crackers. If I make it again I may add a bit less lemon juice and a bit more pesto. I love lemon, but the lemon flavor was a bit much even for me. I still thought it was great though.

This sounds like it should taste so good, but it's actually rather blah.

Made this for a dinner party as an apetizer. It was a huge hit! However, you need to love goat cheese and lemon because these two are strong flavors.

Delicious!

Amazing! Easy to make and always a hit. I usually add extra pesto and lemon juice to give it some extra flavor.

I loove goat cheese, so I may be a little biased, but I loved this recipe. I did, however, cut the amount of lemon juice in half and just added to taste after I blended everything.

I made this for my bookgroup and could have easily doubled it! It was perfect for a warm spring evening served with champagne...of course we talked about the book a little!

Previous reviews prove that different stokes for different folks. I loved this recipe. I think perhaps the quality of the cheese and purchased pesto influence the dip. Since the title of the dip begins with "Lemon" it leads the cook to assume the lemon flavor is dominate, however I can taste the goat cheese and pesto. I don't think I would change a thing.

I completely disagree with the negative reviews of this recipe! I doubled it for a larger group, but only added the lemon suggested for a single recipe and it turned out great!!! It was delicious and everyone at the party loved it too.

This wasn't very good at all. I did not include the lemon juice after reading other reviews that indicated it the lemon was over powering. It was still too lemony with just the lemon zest. I would not recommend this recipe.

I made this for a last minute gathering and the guests LOVED it. What an easy way to make the veggie platter more exciting.

This recipe called for way too much lemon juice, for my aste....and ultimately, the taste of my guests. I tried to fix it by adding more goat cheese and black pepper.....didn't work. If I was to make this next time,I would start with LESS goat cheese, no lemon juice or peel, and then add as I go to get the right taste. With all that I have for left overs, I actually spread on crusty bread to make a panini,and that is ok. Going to end up throwing the rest out. Too darn lemony...

A bit too lemony. Would put a layer of sun dried tomatoes under the pine nuts next time.

We made this for Thanksgiving. It was okay but a bit bland. Definitely falls in the savory and not sweet category -- I felt like the recipe was missing some ingredient that would make the flavors pop. The presentation looked nice (toasted pine nuts, dabs of pesto) but I would definitely look for a better dip recipe for next time.

I made this for a party last month and it was a hit. You do have to love pesto and goat cheese which fortunately we all did.

I would not make this unless you and your party guests LOVE goat cheese enough to marry it. Seriously, this is a lot of goat cheese. I thinned it out with more sour cream and it was still too much. It was the only snack at my recent party that went nearly untouched.

Made it the night before and was not impressed, but by the next day it was delish! Used homemade pesto and more lemon than called for -- maybe a little salt too!

This one didn't work for me. I didn't have quite enough goat cheese, but it was still very thick so I thinned it with a bit of milk. That was a mistake as it was very "loose" the next day when I served it.
