This dish is phenomenal! My suite-mates could not get over how good it smelled, probably bc of the applewood smoked bacon I used. I also ended up using an equivalent amount of pork liver sausage bc the store was out of actual livers (it made the stew amazingly thick) as well as 2 cups of beef broth instead of white wine since I'm not yet legal, but I think it added a lot of flavor. Definitely will make again!

The age of this recipe is a good indication of the number of people who have enjoyed it and thus passed it on. In a nutshell this concoction is deeee licious!

I've made this recipe twice -- once with the liver and once without. While the liver'd version did have a deeper flavor, it also smelled/tasted a tad bit metallic (which I always associate with liver and onions). Adding a bit of a dry sherry for the final 5 minute simmer and serving with a small dollop of sour cream with the chopped dill really smoothed out all the flavors and killed that aftertaste. I'll make this variant again!

I hate liver, but used it anyway and as touted, there is no liver taste. This is good. Served with egg noodles and cucumbers in vinegar. All that I needed was a Sacher Torte and I could have been in Austria.

The 1 cup of wine was not nearly enough for the 3 pounds of chuck to simmer for 2 hours. I kept adding broth and water to keep a gravy-like consistency. Furthermore, the liver flavor (and odor) came thru loud and clear for me. Didn't taste like any authentic goulash I've ever had. Not worth the time and effort.

This dish is outstanding. I've made it 3 times exactly as directed and everyone loved it. Don't be scared to use the liver.

Mom used to make goulash all the time, Austrian version. I liked this recipe very much except I went without the liver.

Great recipe, but I've always used red wine instead of white and only 1 or 2 medium red potatoes. Otherwise, perfect!

I don't care for green pepper either, but I pulsed it in the food processor for a very fine chop. I found that the flavor was fine, it's the chunks I don't like biting into, so the pepper stays after all. I forgot the liver - I was going to use liver sausage, and I can imagine the depth of richness the soup may have gotten from it. I did add beef broth as the soup was too thick (I halved it and had too much meat and potatoes). Really liked the dill flavor, as well as the fact the chuck roast was very tender and flavorful. It freezes well as I have been taking it to work for lunch.

Delicious flavor, the meal was perfect. However, I did not add the potato water as I wanted more of a stew than a soup. It turned out great everyone loved it and no, no one could taste the liver - my family did not even realize it was in there! Will definitely make again.

I made 1 1/2 times the recipe, because I was feeding another family as well as ours. I only used one (very large) green pepper, because I usually don't care for them, but I will use the full amount in the future. I also used the liver sausage (I was lazy, and we've got great sausage makers here in Milwaukee), but will try it with the fresh liver just to see how it is. I used fresh sweet paprika (just brought from Hungary), and felt that it could be increased slightly, but otherwise this is great!

First of all, I didn't think the calf liver bothered the soup at all - after it had cooked for an hour, I blitzed it in the food processor, and it was fine. I did add some sugar to cut the acidity of the broth, and at the very end I added some chopped pickles to the soup and finished with some sour cream. Sorry if I offended the Gourmet gods by doing so, but I thought it tasted great. Thank you for the recipe!

very satisfying soup/meal. however, i made one change that i think improved and simplyfied this recipe: instead of the liver i added a good imported liverwurst from a german deli (you could also add a country style pate). it added some great depth of flavor- hints of thyme and marjoram.

Great recipe! Well worth the time and effort. We don't particularly care for dill but as I used fresh, I sprinkled just enough for a touch of color. Hubby wants it again for Sunday football.
