Nice for a light dinner also. We used pickled piquillo peppers instead of roasted peppers for added spice and flavor. Beautiful presentation.

This was very tasty, and so pretty too! Made the recipe as stated except I followed the advice of an earlier reviewer and added parmesan to the scrambled eggs. Next time I'll try it with a little cream cheese cut into the eggs instead of parmesan just for the creaminess.

A nice, lazy weekend morning dish. Deliciously aromatic while onions and garlic are simmering. Be sure to buy thick, firm Portobellos! And don't overcook the eggs (I added some grated cheese to the eggs just before finishing).Baby, pre-washed spinach is a must. While it all looks pretty, I wouldn't try this dish for more than four, six people at most!

Everybody in my family loves this recipe! I make it pretty often. It's easy to make and is very delicious! I also add some parmesan cheese to it,which makes it more rich.

I made this for a special brunch with friends, and everyone loved it. A nice combination of textures, colors,and tastes. Not much of the recipe can be prepared ahead of time, so it's a bit "putsy" at the last minute.

My family wasn't crazy about this recipe. They all felt there were more creative things to be done with the same ingredients. I will try some variations, though: add cheese, use fresh, medium-hot peppers, etc. Portobellos are always good!
