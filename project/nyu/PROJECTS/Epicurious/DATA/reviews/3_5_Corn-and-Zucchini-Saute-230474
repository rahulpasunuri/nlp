Add a little extra salt and pepper and this dish is simple perfection! Delicious, healthy and easy...what more could you ask for?

I adapted this recipe for a different use than a side dish. I added a can of black beans, some chipoltle powder and a bit of chicken broth and let it simmer. I filled flour tortillas with it, topped it with cheese and rolled into burritos. A great summer meatless meal.

The kids loved it, but personally I would prefer sauteed corn and, separately, grilled zucchini.

OK, so I just used this recipe as inspiration, but what I came up with was so yummy - better than the sum of its parts. This is a perfect way to enjoy the zucchini and corn of summer. I used regular yellow onion instead of scallions and replaced half the olive oil with butter. I added closer to a teaspoon of chopped garlic for only half the recipe, and because I was serving this with an Italian meal, omitted the cumin and replaced the cilantro with chopped fresh basil. I probably added more salt than called for as well - just to taste.

I really didn't find this all that tasty. I used shallots instead of scallions and didn't have any cilantro. No really definitive taste until I added some z'chug (Yemeni spice paste) for flavor.

I'd recommend cooking all this good stuff in small batches so it really sautees vs just steaming. Be generous with the garlic and cumin too.

I made this tonight for my husband and I and we both liked it but were not thrilled with the cilantro. I only put about 3/4 of the amount that the recipe called for. Besides the cilantro, it was very tasty. Next time I will make it without the cilantro

This blows me away everytime I make it - the finished dish is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. I make the full recipe but find that it serves only 2. This, as the star side for a simple chicken cutlet, makes a favorite end of summer meal. I love to eat "in season" but this is one I will sometimes cheat on with frozen corn just to remind me of summer.

Easy and wonderful flavor, love the cumin in this. Used frozen white corn and received many compliments. Quick prep and cook time.

This is great-easy and tasty-summer on a plate-be sure to use lots of cilantro and use 3-4x the garlic.

Extremely easy and tasty side dish that I am adding to my permanent recipe book. Definitely did not grow up a zucchini eater, but if my mom had made it this way, I would have eaten and loved it.

I make this quite a lot. I love the cumin flavoring and it's very easy. I'm making it tomorrow for guests that have a young child. It's a good "kid friendly" vegetable side.

I didn't have any cilantro, so I used a few squirts of lime juice to brighten the flavor. Quick and easy and a great use of summer flavors.

If you have fresh sweet corn, this dish is more than the sum of its parts. We couldn't stop eating it. I added about 1/3 cup of canned chicken broth to keep it moist, and I used epazote instead of cilantro. Delicious!

A Very fresh dish, used fresh sugar corn (cook corn with some sugar in the water). A lovely side dish.

I made this with the squash enchiladas w/ tomatillo sauce from this web site. I tried this first and it was very good -- but after eating some of the enchiladas, it paled in comparison. I used one zucchini and one yellow summer squash - what I had on hand. Worth trying, definitely.

This dish is so fresh, flavorful, and festive. I added chopped red bell pepper for more color. Otherwise followed recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. Quick and easy, perfect sidedish.

This was very tasty and attractive. Added color as one side dish for fish tacos (the other was black beans). Good fresh flavor and so easy. Used frozen corn.

Love the flavor mixture in this dish, easy to make as well. Cumin and cilantro flavors are excellent together. Used frozen corn because I was short on time and it worked fine.

Very nice. Used plenty of garlic. Will certainly do this again.

This receipe is a treat. The cumin and cilantro give even frozen corn a fresh flavor. We also make it without the zuchinni for the non-squash lovers in the house.

Nice flavor. Very easy.

This was really quick & easy. Since my family is not a big fan of cumin & cilantro, I eliminated both and added lots of chopped fresh parsley and basil. Kids loved it.
