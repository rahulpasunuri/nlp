A very European dessert...not too sweet. I also made it with rhubarb from the garden. I peeled the tough strings from it as I always do. Possibly that step took the bit of red out of the rhubarb because I certainly didn't have a "jewel red" top. My mousse and gelatin top were pale green. In fact my sons first thought it was a lemon-lime cake. It was still delicious. I think if I make it again, I'll beat the egg whites in the cake separately to make the cake portion more substantial (and consequently will need bigger pans because as is, it filled the pan to the brim). I would also use a bit more jam in the filling. Finally, I'd throw in some strawberries with the rhubarb for more color. I'd definitely make this one again.

Made this for a special b-day cake with rhubarb fresh from the garden. The mousse and glaze were perfect...rhubarb tangy with just enough sweetness. It took several hours to cook the rhubarb down and then drain the juices, but I made sure to reduce the sauce by half. The mousse was so good I would make this recipe again just for that.

I felt the opposite of another reviewer who thought this didn't have much rhubarb flavor. I was surprised at how delciously rhubarby the mousse and gelatin layers were. I'm sure it depends on how fresh/flavorful your rhubarb is to begin with, but it's kinda tough to taste raw rhubarb and know. Mine was straight out of the garden though, and it made one of the best, prettiest, springtimey desserts ever. I subbed the marscapone for 8 oz of cream cheese; I had everything else on hand and didn't want to run out just for that. I'm sure it's even better with Italian cheese, but I thought it was sublime with generic store brand cream cheese too. I didn't have problems with it setting up either; I think the gelatin amounts are correct. I only have a 9" cake pan and a 9" springform, but I made it work. I was confused at first by the different pan sizes, but ultimately I don't think it matters either way. If you have the two sizes recommended, the mousse surrounds and envelops the cake. If not, you have some cake edges peeking out when you unhinge the springform. The top is so beautiful and it tastes so delicious, no one will be looking at the sides anyway.

This recipe was a big disappointment for me who loves rhubarb. I don't think 3 tsp. of gelatin was enough for the mousse since it didn't firm up . The taste was bland and the cake didn't really enhance the flavour much.

The method for making rhubarb syrup is within the recipe. Third step under "Makie mousse..." "Pour mixture into a large fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl and collect 1 cup syrup and set aside."

It is slightly hidden in the instructions for the mousse......read it carefully and you will see the part where you make the syrup........
