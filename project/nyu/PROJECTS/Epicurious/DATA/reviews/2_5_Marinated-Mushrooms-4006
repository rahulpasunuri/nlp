I too read a few different recipies and ultimately chose this one. I used 1/4 cup olive oil, half of a squeezed lemon, red wine vinegar,just a splash of madera, thyme and rosemary. I used 4 whole cloves of garlic and halved them lengthwise, and added approx 2 tbls minced shallot. I thought these were addicting, so good!

I read a few of the reviews prior to making this dish, so I modified it a bit to add more flavor. Instead of halving the garlic and then removing it after 6 minutes, I minced about 5 cloves of garlic and left it in the pan while cooking the remaining ingredients. I made this for a July 4th barbecue and got rave reviews.

Despite the mixed ratings, I made this recipe. I substitued Madera wine instead of a regular dry white wine because it's what I had on hand. I concur with the previous reviews that the recipe is missing something. They were just okay. Maybe more garlic and oil would help.

I read the other reviews previous to mine, they werent good..I decided to make the recipe anyway. I used champagne instead of white wine, and a very rich red wine vinegar. These mushrooms were fabulous! I was licking the bowl! Asher Benezra

I've never met a marinated mushroom that I didn't like, until now ... bland and boring.

Nothing special. Have made / had much better. Skip this one for something better --

It seemed like something was missing, but the base was good. This recipe has potential - try experimenting.

I thought these were easy to make and were beautiful with orther veggies on a tray w/ dill dip. They disappeared in the first half-hour of the party! Definitely let them marinate overnight.

Tangy, but good. Easy to make, and great for a crowd.

Too much wine flavor

Love it, Love it!! I have made this several times for guests, and they always request it for pot-luck pinics. If this recipe truly seems bland, then you've done something wrong!!
