It was delicious and worth the effort. I would recommend leaving it in the freezer until it is time to serve. For my taste it was slightly too rich but the flavor was great. It looked beautiful too. It is really nice I was able to make it a day in advance.

This is a wonderful dessert that will earn you great compliments from family and guests. It is worth the time and effort required. I made it with hazelnuts and Frangelico, added slightly less sugar than suggested, and I doubled the quantities to serve six generously. I transferred the ramekins from the freezer to the fridge at the start of my main course so that by dessert time the souffles were no longer rock solid. This turned out to be an excellent move because the flavours came through beautifully.

I loved it. My only problem was I found it dificult to triple the recipe for 8-10 people.

Excellent! I made this as dessert at the end of a moving day. My guests were gathered in the kitchen enjoying much deserved apperitifs. I had to (gently but firmly) slam few hands which couldn't resist breaking pieces of the praline while it was cooling. I presented the souffle in a single compote dish. It was a hit! Will certainly make again...

Brilliant but a little time consuming. Portions are way TOO large--our guests (except piggies) left at least half or more. Suggest using 2-3 oz ramekins with 1/2" crown.

AWESOME. I used compote glasses instead of ramekins--much more elegant. When I dropped one of the glasses, I had to fend my guests off; they were prepared to pick the glass out of the dessert to get another helping!

This was a big hit for Valentine's Day. I simplified the recipe by using one Skor bar instead of making the praliner, and it was great!I also used Amaretto.

A very romantic dessert, which definitely changes from the basic chocolate cake! The only drawback is that there is a lot of dishes to wash once the ramekins are in the freezer. I look forward to owning a dishwasher ;-)

This dish was easy to make and i luved the crunchiness of the pralines. Almonds are not my favorite, so i left them out. I also did not substitute on the liquor and used cognac.

Yummy! I used Amaretto in place of the Cognac. And in future I would split a single recipe into 3-4 portions, since it made for a *very* generous 2 portions. (We were both stuffed but finished off every last bit because we couldn't stand the thought that some of it might go to waste!)

Great make-ahead dessert! Make sure you have everything ready before starting to make this (mis en place). Watch the time on the second sugar carmellization - I burnt the first batch after only 3 minutes. Timing was more like 21\2 minutes. Praline directions are perfect. Used Frangelico in place of the Cognac/Brandy. Yummy.
