This soup made for a satisfying, easy, week-night meal. I sauteed the onion in the annatto oil first, then added 3 smashed cloves of garlic and ALL of the potatoes. I stirred to coat the potatoes with the onion and oil mixture then added the cumin, pepper and salt, and 1 heaping tsp. paprika. I then added just 5 cups of water since I would not be cooking the soup as long as the recipe directed. I cooked the soup until the potatoes were tender (about 20 minutes), then smashed the potatoes in the soup pot, leaving about half of them in whole cubes. I then added the milk and cheese. Served with avocado and sour cream. Next time I may add some corn kernels at the end for a little more texture.

I found this dish to be utterly lacking in flavor, even though I used a stronger flavored cheese (aged gruyere). Also, it was decidedly unappetizing in appearence, so I decided to puree the whole thing with my immersion blender. It still lacked flavor, even after adding smoked paprika and more cheese.

I was thrilled to find a recipe from my "home". This glorious soup is straight from Ecuador where I've lived and cooked for the past 30 years. It's called "locro de papas". Particularly in the countryside a green leafy vegetable, such as Swiss chard or "nabo nacional" (a delicious wild green which grows in the potato fields) is added at the end of cooking. We like to float thick slices of avocado on the soup.

A really good potato soup that is different from the rest. Simple to prepare. I didn't actually think it needed the cheese (although I did use it).

Remains in the memory. Wonderful soup, especially with the avocados.

Liked it a lot, but next time will increase the cumin a bit. Queso fresco is worth looking for, but other cheeses are also good in this. Experiment with what's available; even cheddar works well.

Can I find annatto seeds at a standard grocery store or do I have to go to a special market? Really want to try this...and everything else that requires annatto seeds!

Substitutes for Queso Fresco, Rick Bayless suggests using a fresh goat cheese or dry curd cottage cheese and adding salt. You should look for a crumbly goat cheese.

Queso cheese is found in every grocery store in Los Angeles. I'm not sure where QC is, but you can also drain sour cream for an hour and get a thick substitute.

I would like to make this recipe, but I'm not sure I can find the right cheese. Can anyone recommend a reasonable substitute?

The achiote adds an interesting flavor and I will certainly make it again.

A very soothing and filling vegetarian soup. It's nothing out of this world, but it is very comforting. Photos of how mine came out are at http://maiapapaya.wordpress.com/2007/02/04/lifting-a-fog-as-thick-as-pea-soup/ if you're curious

I made this stew a few days after my February Gourmet arrived, it looked that interesting. It did not disappoint. The annatto, cumin, and queso fresco give it a very interesting flavor. We have had twice already, and it isn't even February, yet!
