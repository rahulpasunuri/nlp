Very solid recipe, and really easy. It was a big hit with Mr! I subbed panko for regular bread crumbs, and used thighs instead of drums. Didn't have mustard with horseradish on hand, but a mixture of dijon, whole grain mustard and a big glob of horseradish did the trick. I think next time I'll cook the coated chicken on a rack, though, so it's crispy on all surfaces.

Everyone loved this dish but I rated it a 3 instead of a 4 simply because it was a bit messy. I'm certainly saving into my recipe box.

This is super-easy and really tasty. The mustard adds a really nice surprise flavor. Perfect for a weekday night when you want something good but don't have a lot of time. The legs can roast while you prep everything else and even enjoy a glass of wine.

This recipe is really simple. I used chicken drunmsticks and things, normal butter, and panko crumbs (japanese) I had on hand. I have to say it was simple and tasty, and would make it again for company. The arugula makes it more "gourmet" but the chicken on its own is fine

We thought this was really fantastic! We nixed the arugula bed this time although i do think it would go really well. The mix of flavours was really good; we used fresh wheat breadcrumbs and they tasted great.

Great for company -- great for the family -- even the kids like it!

I'm just about to serve this for the third time. It's a breeze to make and always gets great compliments. Paired with the arugula (so easy!), it looks great when presented, too. The horseradish mustard is definitely key: the taste is subtle with guests asking what the flavors are.

I made this dish with organic, antibiotic-free chicken thighs(tastes so much better than other chicken and doesn't shrink as much when cooked). I also added radicchio for color and extra flavor. It was absolutely delicious..we scarfed it down! I always use organic apple cider vinegar because the commercial kind tastes like turpentine. Bragg Organic apple cider vinegar is found in health food stores and tastes sweet and light, not sharp and acidic like Heinz or America's Choice. Try it in salad dressings, you'll notice a difference! Will definitely make this recipe again..so easy!

This was great! My boyfriend loved it so much, he leftovers the next day for lunch AND dinner. I think using good mustard is the key. I used Stonewall Kitchen's Mustard with Horseradish. Also, make sure you use cider vinegar for the dressing, regular vinegar doesn't have the right flavor. The citrus salad (recommended in the recipe) was a wonderful accompaniament.

This was very tasty and simple to prepare. I made it w/chicken breasts and removed the skin before coating. Delicious.

This was so easy and delicious. I used Empire Kosher chicken pieces and omitted the arugula. The problem with this recipe is that the bits left in the pan are so delicious I couldn't stop eating them!

Have made this twice, once with the arugula salad and once without. Everyone loved it. The leftovers were also delicious cold.

This was great--I made the night before a picnic, and it was delicious served cold. I didn't even bother with the arugula, but everyone raved anyway. I'll definitely make it again!
