Absolutely delicious!!! Changes I made: I added garlic and green peppers with the onions, used fresh tomatoes, no scallions, no dill, kalamata olives instead of black, a package of Trader Joe's baby spinach, added a can of black beans at the very end to make a full protein meal. I also soaked my rice and thought it was going to come out too watery but it turned out excellent!! Served with a fresh french baguette....mmmm!!!!

A friend makes a version of this recipe every year for Easter with lamb. He uses canned diced Italian tomatoes instead of the reduction and garlic instead of dill. I love it and my rice loving children like it very much too.

My friend and I thought this recipe was just so-so. We were expecting a lot from the reviews and we both love all the ingredients in the recipe, but we just didn't feel it was any thing special. It was filling and comforting like risotto, but lacked the usual satisfaction. Sorry!

For me, this recipe is about a two and a half forks. There is another, very similar, recipe on this site called RICE WITH SPINACH AND FETA CHEESE and I prefer that one. It has white wine and chicken broth as its base. More complex taste.

This was great, a few small alterations. I used fresh dill and imported feta and Kalamata olives. I didn't use the sea salt either.It had a fresh crisp taste to it this way.

Good solid dish. Will use more spinach next time and really can skip the tomatoe. EXTRA Dill though...GREAT

Subbed dill seed for the fresh because I didn't want to run to the store. Came out yummy. Looking forward to trying it with fresh dill next time.

I read the reviews, and the raves intrigued me enough to try it. WOW!! What a fresh, layered, and beautiful looking dish. We're already planning the next making of it. I was lazy and used about 1 cup of diced tomatoes instead of a tomato reduction, and it was very fresh tasting. Next time I will try the reduction to compare it. I also served lemon slices alongside the rice, which adds just another layer of that mediterranean flair.

I was skeptical about this recipe when cooking it, but it was absolutely delicious. We had it as a main dish, and it has been added to the regular weekly meal list because it is so quick and easy and good!!!

This is a great sidedish to any grilled meats or as an vegitarian option. I used about a cup of fresh chopped tomatoes instead of the puree. I also recommend using more crumbled feta on top(not just as a garnish) and some Turkish black olives or any flavorful greek one similar to Kalamata.(If you are a feta/olive fan as myself) I was also generous on the olive oil, make sure to use the good virin olive oil for it imparts ALOT of flavor. Definitely give this recipe a try it will surprize your taste buds!

I did this as an accompaniment to the grilled butterflied leg of lamb in the file and it was a wonderful combination. I think this recipe could be simplified with chopped frozen spinach and canned crushed tomatoes, but for sheer authenticity, it was fun to "do it from scratch" One caveat: two pounds fresh spinach is 'way more than needed--adjust downwards, I think one pound would be fine.

I had a little problems with this one, the cooking process. The water wasn't enough for the rice -- so keep a close eye on it. I think I added too much spinach -- it was more of a spinach than rice dish? I also chopped up the feta and black olives and mixed them in. It was really good anyway, even with all my obstacle courses.

This is one of my favorite recipes. The only problem is that it is so good that it is hard to stop eating it.
