I agree with A. Cook - delicious the first day and just as good the next, except that the thyme becomes overwhelming to the point of being unpleasant. Now I make this the day before and add the thyme just before serving to the portion I am serving.

I wish they'd indicated a temperature: mine got kinda brown and crispy even though I had it on medium low.... they definitely were not confit by the end.... more just sauteed.

Delicious the first day, would have been better the second day if the scent of thyme had not become completely overpowering. Next time will split into portions and add thyme as it gets served.

This is very similar to a carmelized onion bruchetta appetizer I make. One thing which really makes it, I would recommend trying, is to top the onion with crumbled gorgonzola, and broil a couple minutes to melt. Ummmmm.

This was delicious but we all agreed that the onions should be dhopped so it would be easier to put them on the toast. We happed to also have a cream cheese spread with chopped sundried tomatoes in itat the same luncheon and we discovered that the spread and the confit were really great together.

Prepared and served in backyard for 4th of July fireworks party. All the guest (even those that don't normally eat onions) raved at the taste. Cook onions outside in wok over gas burner. So easy and good.

Served at a party and was a great hit. Everyone wanted recipe. Make when "stuck" in the kitchen as it requires time for the onions to carmalize. With prep, requires almost an hour.
