I made this for a culinary group dinner and thought it was just o.k. Shucking the fava beans was a lot of work and this recipe just didn't deliver enough "bang for the buck".

Good recipe to make ahead. I used red potatoes because I couldn't find the purple ones - will continue to search. Also, I cooked the potato slices only 3 minutes once the water returned to a boil; they were too soft for our taste when I cooked them longer. Great picture on page 135 of September, 1997, issue of Gourmet, although the picture titles are mixed up!
