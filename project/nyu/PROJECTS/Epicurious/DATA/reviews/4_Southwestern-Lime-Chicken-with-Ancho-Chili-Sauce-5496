This chicken was moist and flavorful and the melted cheese was a nice creamy touch. I followed the recipe exactly as stated and there is only one thing I would do differently next time. Instead of using three dried anchos in the sauce I would use only two. I think this would keep the ancho flavor from completely overpowering the sauce. Three are other good flavors in it as well that need to be allowed to shine through. Other than that, yum!

I have been looking for a flavorful and easy Mexican marinade and this is it! I didn't make the sauce or use cheese, and it was fantastic. Next time I will use fresh ancho chilis in the marinade for added freshness and spice. Amszing recipe!

Accidentally made this sauce when I meant to make another very similar recipe/spice mix for chicken enchiladas. It seemed too sweet for chicken, so instead of tossing it, we froze it till we had a pork tenderloin to BBQ. And OMG was it good! Highly recommend for pork.

We made both the chicken and the sauce and there is a lot of flavor even without marinating overnight. It's a good staple and might make it again but didn't knock our socks off.

This is a great marinade for chicken..i bet it would be good for shrimp as well but i wouldn't leave them in for more than an a few hours to see how the lime affected them. Whoever said it was a flavor bomb...hit the nail on the head. Not too spicy, not too sweet, soy sauce well balanced by the lime. This is a keeper.

Rating: 4
I could just tell by looking at the recipe this was a flavor-bomb chicken for chow hounds! If you're a) overwhelmed by 'lite' soy sauce, b) don't have the time to marinate (the review should be based on the recipe and not your ability to execute it), or c) can't tell if your family will like a dish by reviewing ingredients and instructions then just don't go there.

My family loved this recipe! made it as written, and it was fantastic. Also made the sauce, sooo good! The first night we ate four of the eight breasts after marinading for a few hours. Made the 2nd batch the next night, after marinating 24 hours, not much difference, so don't worry if you don't have overnight to marinate.

Rating: 4
Great low-carb meal (great meal, period!). I usually make this as chicken skewers - slice the breasts into chicken-tender-sized strips, marinate, then thread onto skewers. For dip, I've just heated up the leftover marinade (boiled then simmered to ensure it's cooked through), cooled, and mixed with some mayonnaise. Excellent!!!

Rating: 4
This surpassed our expectations. Only used 2 tbsp of soy sauce in the marinade as I was a little afraid of mixing that much soy sauce into a Mexican recipe, but it worked out and I ended up regretting not putting in the rest as the chicken needed a little more salt. I also added some chipotle powder to add a smoky flavor. Just used the marinade for the chicken, grilled it, and served in tacos. We will try this again over rice!

I made this recipe for 200 people for a wednesday night meal at church. I reserved part of the marinade and added mayo and some ancho chiles to it instead of the ancho chili sauce. then I baked it in the ovens because it was for a large crowd. Rave reviews. One man actually kissed me on the cheek(in front of his wife) and said that was one of best meals he had ever had.

Great chicken recipe! (Didn't try the ancho chile sauce) Even my very picky sister in law raved about it. The only thing I changed was to add about 2T of honey to the marinade. I've made it with fresh and dried herbs and although both are delicious, the fresh herbs really make a difference.

A nice change from the usual grilled chicken. I served it with plain rice and vegetables, and it would have been improved by salsa and sour cream to cut the intense marinade flavor.

My husband and I love this marinade. I make this carb- free. I marinate the chicken overnight, grill it, and serve it over black beans or pinto beans with all the normal fresh mexican toppings. I'm sure a tortilla or rice would be good, but it's great carb- free, also. I also leave out the cheese to save the fat content. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made this recipe many times. My favorite rendition includes using 6 cloves of sliced garlic sauteed in the veg. oil over med-low heat until just starting to turn golden. I then chopped the cooked garlic with the herbs and add followed the recipe as stated. This helped cut the sharpness of the garlic. I like garlic in marinades, but prefer the mellower and sweeter taste of cooked garlic.

Great flavor. I've gotten to where I skip the Ancho Chile sauce, and I triple the marinade so I have enough to make a sauce with. The last time, I sauteed green pepper & onions to serve with the chicken. I also had on hand a jar of onions I had cooked for about 40 mins, 'til they carmelized. I added this to the sauce, along with the other onions & peppers. It was fantastic! If you have the time, marinate the chicken for 24 hrs.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet - it is a staple for my family. Such moist and flavorful chicken. I double the marinade and then boil it for a few mins before serving it with the chicken. I don't use the melted cheese on top, as I typically serve with halved bell peppers that I grill and melt pepperjack cheese in them. The fresh herbs, even with the unusual flavor combinations, are the making of this recipe, along with the fresh lime juice. So good.

Very Very Delicious. Moist chicken with lots of flavor. Made with the recommended sauce, very good, but could eat just the chicken! Served it as halved breasts with the melted cheese on top. Would also be good sliced in a tortilla with the sauce over it. Will definately make again and again. I did marinate overnight. And we did grill it. Gourmet!

This marinade is fabulous -- I marinated for 24 hours, and the chicken was so tender and flavorful! The sauce tasted really good, but came out kind of thin and runny -- next time I'm going to try eliminating the addition of soaking liquid and see if that helps.

Very tasty dish, but the sauce is what really makes the dish. I was a little worried about soy sauce in a southwestern marinade, but it was a nice compliment to the lime juice and the herbs. I used the ancho chiles in the sauce and it was a nice change from chipotle peppers.

This was a tasty, unique way to prepare chicken! I marinated it overnight to allow the maximum blend of flavors. I broiled it, instead of grilled it. I substituted a drained can of Ortega Chilis instead for the Ancho pepper. All the guests raved! Kid friendly, as well.

Actually, we give it 3.5 forks. When my husband says it's one of the best dishes I've made, it's definitely a keeper. The fresh herbs gave it a fresh, unique flavor. Worried that the sauce might be too spicey, I reduced the cayenne pepper to 1/4 teaspoon, but next time I'll use the 1/2 t. called for.

I was suprised at how tasty the chicken was. I only marinated it for about 3 hours, but the chicken still came out with so much flavor. It was raining outside so I wasn't able to bbq, but next time I will. I sauteed the chicken, and next time I will make rice to soak up the juices. I think I might try marinating chicken thighs and legs along with the breasts. It's a definite keeper!

Rating: 3
This was really 3.5 forks. Excellent flavor. I made a few substitutions ont the spices as it seemed strange to have rosemary/oregano in a southwestern dish. I just used a little rosemary and lots of cilantro. I did make the ancho chile sauce, also with a couple of adjustments (1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream; 3 chipoltes instead of ancho chiles) and it was excellent. It was spicy though. I served grilled scallions with the chicken and used the Mexican Bean recipe on this site and it was excellent.

We LOVED this! The only changes we made was to leave out the cayenne (b/c of our 3 year old) and we only marinated for 4 hrs (just pierced ck with fork several times) There was SO much flavor with these. Wow. On another note, we did not like the sauce - it was way too sweet, but I'll review that separately.

With respect to the other positive reviews, I had high expectations for this recipe. However, while I used low-sodium(lite) soy sauce, the soy flavor was overwhelming. I doubt I'll make this again, but if I do, I'll substitute more citrus for the soy. As for the ancho chile sauce, I also subbed chipotles. It was ok...but the sauce wasn't really necessary.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! Only change was to use low salt or lite soy sauce to reduce saltiness. Made with the Ancho Chili Sauce which was also wonderful and served with Black Beans with Garlic, Cumin and Cillantro (awesome with diced tomatoes and green chilis and chipotle peppers added). Will be making this dinner frequently!

This was really excellent! Lots of flavor. I followed the recipe except for using the New Mexico chili as an earlier reviewer suggested.

Be careful with the lime in the marinade. If you marinate it too long, the lime will "cook" the chicken, and the meat gets tough. This is my standard chicken fajita recipe, and all my Texan kids love it!

Loved the marinade and the sauce. Only had dried herbs and ancho powder so had to wing it a bit, but still great.

Very satisfying meal and looking forward to leftovers!

This marinade is outstanding. (Never tried the sauce.) My family is sensitive to spice, so I add less chili and cayenne. Sometimes I'll sub in half of the amount of dried rosemary and oregano to speed up the prep time. It's so, so good. I usually put the chicken into veggie burritos (diced zucchini, squash, onion, black beans and corn sauteed together til tender) with sour cream and salsa. Love it.

Seems like the positive reviews are mainly for the ancho sauce, and maybe not so much for the chicken recipe. Maybe it's because I only marinated the chicken for 2 hours and didn't bother with the ancho sauce on the side, but I thought the chicken recipe in and of itself was pretty weak. I guess that's not an entirely fair review...maybe I'll try again when I've got more time later.

I made this dish along with another dish for a birthday dinner. The entire family (8 other people) gave the chicken AND the sauce 4 forks. I did leave the cheese out though. I personally wouldnt have said it was "out of this world" but it is worth making. And I believe the ancho chili sauce should be made and not left out. I did reduce the marinade down and had that along side if people wanted to add more on their chicken.

I was looking for a new chicken recipe and decided to try this one. It was delicious. I didn't make the chili sauce. Plus, I cheated and used bottled lime juice and dried rosemary and oregano. I marinated it for a few hours rather than overnight. I wasn't sure about the serving suggestion of black beans, rice, lettuce, salsa and tortillas. Sounds great but was the chicken to be cut up and put in the toritllas or was all this to just be served on the same plate? Ended up only servin it with black beans, salad and bread. Very good.

ok--here's my first review--I rely so much on other comments--I thought I ought to contribute-- Basic recipe is great- I also used chipotle and I doubled garlic (as I always do). I added 1 minced jalapeno then processed the marinade. Pieces of breast with ribs were marinated in sealed bag for a day, then grilled. REALLY good. Served with a chopped salad with sweetish-vinegarette and sour cream on the side--both of which I find refreshing when serving spicy stuff.

Wow, great chicken, tender and flavorful even though I only had time to marinate 8 hours. I cut the marinade by 1/4 th and used two breasts and that was just right for 2 servings.

I will try mixing it with sour cream as someone suggested for salad dressing. Will definately make the chicken again and again.......

I used chicken thighs instead. Also, I just boiled down the marinade for a dipping sauce as another user had suggested. Haven't even tried the chili sauce and won't miss it after using the marinade. Next, I'm going to try using pork ribs with this recipe.

Great recipe! We did not find the ancho sauce mayonnaisy, but we did add a little cayenne for extra kick. Started marinating in the morning instead of the night before. Definately a keeper!

man o man is this an awesome and easy to prepare dish....made it twice...and will do so again... in fact real real soon.... taste great with 10 hours or 36 hours of marinating...yum yum... used jalepeno peppers in sauce to substitute ancho and tasted just delicous as well...liked by all...

This recipe was an enormous hit when we entertained friends. Everyone who I gave the recipe to has made it and loved it. I made the recipe as directed, but you really don't need the monterey jack cheese on the chicken -- the marinade and the ancho chili sauce add a lot of flavor. We used the leftover sauce to top veggie burgers and quesadillas too.

I agree with some of the other reviewers: the ancho chili sauce is a waste of time. There's something very off about it...bitter tasting and blah. It can't compliment the depth of flavor of the chicken. The marinade totally makes this dish. I particularly liked the taste of the fresh oregano. I both grilled the chicken and smoked it in my stovetop smoker (go out and get one if you don't have one already!) and preferred it smoked.

The chicken part of this recipe actually deserves only a '2' rating, but since the sauce makes this dish, I'm rating it overall as a '3'. I omitted the cheese and put the chicken onto shish kebabs. The sauce was to die for and made the dish.

We prepared the marinated chicken and ancho chili sauce ahead of time and packed it to take camping. It grilled up wonderfully on the camp fire and earned rave reviews from our friends. We didn't use the cheese, nor did we miss it!

Try this with sliced pork tenderloin, too! This sauce is fantastic and I have used it as indicated in the recipe and over grilled pork tenderloin as well. This is a favorite and I will use it for our next neighborhood dinner which is at my house!

I have made this dish a few times and it always gets rave reviews. I serve it with refried black beans and homemade salsa. Very good, tasty, juicey and tender.

This dish is a favorite with us. The sauce is excellent. However, with if you make the sauce with the chicken, the cheese is a bit too rich, and hard to taste under the sauce. Skip the cheese.

Great chicken recipe. Both the marinade and the sauce are excellent and could be used with other meats. The other reviewers have said it all!

I try alot of chicken dishes and this one is really good! I would not usually serve a chicken dish to guest because I feel it is very ordinary. However this one is different. I cannot wait to serve it at my next party. I think the sauce makes the dish. I do not prefer spicy things, but this one is great! I only used 2 chiles instead of the recommended 3, just to tone down the spice.

My family loves this .. I use chicken tenders marinate them over night and then serve them as a soft taco / wrap .with the ancho chili sauce.... along with slices of avocado and shredded lettuce.

I LOVED this recipe! I also made a very risky substitution (lemon juice for lime) and it still turned out great. Sides of rice and beans went very well, as the recipe recommends. This is a dish I would happily serve for company.

This was delicious, and simple to make. We tried both the ancho chili sauce and the boiled down marinade, as suggested by another reviewer, and both of us preferred the marinade.

Wonderful! My husband and teenage son love this and request it on a weekly basis. The sauce is outstanding and can be used over practically everything!

The marinade for this chicken is amazing. I used it with salmon, and got wonderful results as well. The sauce is really delicious, but masks the flavor of the marinade. The sauce would be better reserved for something else. The perfect sauce for this dish is the marinade itself. Boil it down and serve on the side. Trust me- it's great.

This marinated chicken has become one of my weeknight dinner favorites. I usually skip the ancho chili sauce and serve it with yellow rice or green chili rice and steamed veggies.

I love this recipe. Very authentic southwestern taste. I add a little dark beer to the marinade and then bake the chicken in the marinade. It makes the chicken even more tender. The ancho chili sauce is a wonderful addition. I serve it with the Green Rice and Black bean recipe. My husband loved it.

Delicious! I made it without the cheese, but put some grated jack on the table. The sauce was fabulous!

This was wonderful! Pretty spicy for chili novices like me. I did bake the chicken first and then I finished it on the grill to keep the chicken moist. It was marvelous; I wouldn't change a thing.

This recipe did not agree with my family. I considered it for several months before attempting. The sauce mediocre, the marinade below its rank of prior tasters. Sorry, it sucked.

It was a great hit with very picky eaters. I sliced the chicken up and served with with fajitas shells and shredded cheese instead of melting the cheese over the chicken.

This is a great recipe, but only make it if you like spicy! Just a suggestion, I used chicken tenders instead of using a whole chicken breast, I think its much better that way, I also used chipotles in adoebo sauce, it was great! A great side is the Mango, Jicama, and corn salad.

I made this for dinner last night. Both my husband and I loved it. My husband raved about it and kept saying that it was a great dinner to make when we have friends over for dinner. The chicken was so flavorful and the cheese was just the right compliment to it. Now I know what to make the next time!

Incredible sauce! I used chipotles in adobo for the sauce (with beer for the soaking liquid) since I didn't have anchos and it was amazing. I now mix up a big batch and keep it as a staple. I have used it to make a great chicken salad, and also added sour cream to make a dip.

YUM YUM YUM!!! This was a hit with the entire family. My brother and I especially liked scraping up the cheese off the pan and enjoying the sweet and spicy marinade coated to it! I reccommend having a few lime quarters handy just to give it one more kick!

The marinade was simple and the chicken came out delicious. I made this recipe for a party and everyone loved it. The accompanying sauce (I used chipolte instead of ancho) was also very good. I would definitely use this recipe again

Wonderful cold. Makes a great sandwich wrapped in a flour tortilla. A huge success with guests. Subtle rather than hot. The Ancho Chili Sauce makes a stunning complement to the chicken and was appreciated by all our guests.

You must make the sauce! The chicken marinade is perfect, I used 1/2 the soy sauce because we do not care for much. I made the sauce two ways, one with ancho and then canned jalpenos. To save time the jalapeno was ok but preferred the ancho.

I made this recipe while camping at a folk music festival. Invited guests from other campsites to dine....all wanted the recipe...I didn't have a blender so the ancho peppers were in small pieces but it was outstanding anyway....this will be a regular feature for my guest menus....absolutly wonderful!!!!!
