I entered pasta and black-beans into the search bar and this recipe came up. I'm so glad it did. I used a can of green-enchilada sauce instead of the red. It took 8 minutes to make this meal. Talk about quick and easy. It's different and cam be served with chopped tomatoes, grilled chicken and veggies, and even a splash of ranch dressing is good in it.

I love this recipe. It's a really nice twist on pasta, especially if you're sick of red sauce. I even dreamed about it while I was pregnant. We add fresh celantro as a garnish.

My kids love all food, but we had to throw this dish in the grabage. Save your groceries, try another recipe on the site.

I'd give this 2 forks as written...3 with my changes. I nearly doubled the enchilada sauce and added some sauteed green and yellow pepper, it would have been pretty boring without it! My husband really liked this but agreed without the peppers it would have been pretty plain, and it definitely needed the extra sauce. I'd also use some minced chipotle next time rather than the jalapeno, as written it just wasn't hot enough for me and I think the chipotle would give it a smokier flavor which it needed. Serves 4 easily.

Surprisingly good, I wasnt so sure at first. But it was a nice change from regular tomato sause. My guests went back for seconds, I would probably make again.

This was really good! And quite healthy! I left out the jalepeno, since I was feeding it to my already too-picky 2 year old and he ate all of his! Can't wait to try it experimenting with different enchilada sauces!

This is a tasty week-night meal that is simple to make. Great for lunch the next day too! To make it slightly more substanital for dinner, I tossed in some leftover grilled chicken breats that I cubed and added along with the beans, etc.

We thought this was a super dish! I also used bow-tie pasta which was great. Cumin might be a nice addition to give it a little more zip, but as is was very nice. This recipe was very easy, quick and had my 14 year old son asking for more!

A tip: do not substitute salsa as suggested by other reviewers. Very strange.

I tried this dish and was disappointed in it, especially after reading the reviews. I don't know what I was expecting as Mexican and pasta seemed like an odd pairing (at least to a Texan). I should have followed my instincts and passed on this recipe.

I was expecting this receipe to be similar to the Rigatoni with Southwestern style Ground-Turkey Sauce. But it was just a shadow. For those of you that are interested in something along that line I would encourage you to try that reciepe, you won't be disappointed.

This turned out amazingly good!! I did change some things, I added some homemade salsa, fresh tomatoes, cumin, chili powder, corn kernels and cilantro. But the basic recipe was a wonderful inspiration! And I used pepper jack cheese too! I can't wait to serve it at my party Sunday!!

My husband and I thought this dish was delicious. I would definitely make it again. I left out the hot peppers and used a little hot pepper sauce. I also topped the pasta with chopped fresh tomatoes and onions.

I used salsa instead of enchilada sauce, as recommended by a few reviewers. I also didn't have sour cream handy, so I used a little heavy cream, which worked great in cutting the spicy flavor. All told a very tasty vegetarian dish.

It's spicy! Myhusband loves pasta, but not fusilli, however he really loved it with fusilli. I don't know how different between ENCHILADA and SALSA sauce. So I used mild salsa sauce which worked well. I reduced the mount of sour cream and sprinkled cilantro on the top. Yummy!!

WOW! Spicy. We used La Victoria enchilada sauce and added a pinch of dried cilantro. Woo-hoo, we needed the Pepto last night, but it was well worth it. A real taste treat. I recommend cutting the sour cream in half, so that the flavor of the dish is not washed out. And since I prefer a softer pasta, we used rotelle instead of fusilli. Fusilli, no matter how long it is cooked, always tastes/feels too al dente to me. The sprinkle of Monteray cheese on top is a pleasant touch. It adds a mellow flavor to the spicy sauce. We also topped it with green onions instead of scallions. A very nice texture. We will make this again, and possibly add more to the sauce to round out the flavor. A definite "must try" dish!

After making the sauce to this recipe, I decided that it was not worthy to put on pasta and promptly threw it out. Unless you are using a really good enchalada sauce -- or are able to make a fresh salsa/picante/enchalada sauce in place of the called for 10oz. can, don't bother with this recipe.

This dish got my attention because I wanted Black Beans on Dec 15th. I improvised, though, as is usual by adding to it a bit - I let some olive oil smoke first, then added the onion, some thyme, basil, and oregano, peppers, garlic. After a few minutes of saute, I added about 1/8 c. of tequila and torched it. I'm a big fan of flames in cooking and in women. I also added about 1/2 t. liquid smoke. Scallops could be a nice touch. Salud!

It was OK. Perhaps a better choice of enchilada sauce would have made it better.

Easy to make; was very good as a main dish, but could also be a side dish. Will definately have again.
