This was a big hit and even my super-finicky kids enjoyed them! I made only half of the recipe and added a touch of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.

Really very good but must include vanilla and whatever spice you like (I added pumpkin). I also added a mushed up banana, a tablespoon of rum, and a little bit of chocolate syrup to the batter. Non-stick skillet eliminated the need for butter in the pan (there is plenty in the batter). These are perfect for a busy weeknight dinner.

I made this recipe for a large brunch and everyone was raving about how good the pancakes were. I also added a lot of pumpkin spice to give them winter flavor. I served them with whipped cream and real maple syrup.

Great flavor-though I think the addition of vanilla and cinnamon was important. I'd cook it at a little lower heat, as it seemed to brown too quickly and leave the center a little too "custardy". I would also use less butter than 2 TBS in the pan to start with, as the first batch was swimming in butter. Love the flavor, and very easy to make.

Easy and delicious. I added a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla; next time I'll add more. I was worried that these would be difficult to flip, but the batter is very manageable.

RAVE reviews every time I've made this. They are really, really wonderful. Invest in a good quality maple syrup to really bring these up another notch (as if it were possible). DEFINITELY give 'em a try.

Don't even think about skipping this just because you have to cut up some bread!! These pancakes are delicious - moist, thin, delicate but not unmanageable. My family loves them.

Why bother? They took alot longer than regular pancakes and were like 'gut bombs' in your stomach after only just one. Bread pudding - yes, pancakes,-yes, but together- nah!

Very easy to make, and out of this world taste.

I made this for pancake day. I made them in the morning, then chilled them. I reheated them in the evening then put them in the warming oven until evening. I forgot about them until the following morning. Apart from the top ones that had gone a bit crisp the rest were excellent with a chocolate and Grand Marnier Ganache.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make! We used whole grain bread, which made them firm, but they still maintained a fluffy texture. Normally we use Aunt Jemima's pancake mix, but this recipe is so easy we don't ever intend on going back.

I loved this recipe. It was a wonderful way to use up the "squished" bread we get sometimes from our grocery store packers. The taste was very similar to bread pudding in a smaller sense.

Very good. Softer than regular pancakes, so a little more difficult to make, but a nice change from the norm.

I am a top-dollar caterer and this recipe is one of my clients favorites. The batter can stand for longer than usual and the cakes keep well in a warm oven. Makes it an easy dish for Sunday mornings. These are easy to make and are delicious topped with a hot curried fruit compote, maple syrup or just plain!. I definately recommend this recipe

Delicious! I added 1 tsp. of vanilla to make them a little more "bread pudding-like" -- we loved them!
