This salad is as delicious as it is beautiful.

The combination of arugula, capers, onion, and chives was delicious. I tossed the mixture with a homemade vinaigrette consisting of olive oil, red wine vinegar, and a dollop of sour cream. I used a combination of red beets and golden beets, however I prefer the red beets b/c they were sweeter and had more flavor. The golden beets did not have much flavor and tasted flat.

My food prep class prepared this for the University President and his administration. They liked it so well that the chef for the administration later called for the recipe.

I couldn't find the golden beets, but the red ones worked out just fine. Very easy to prepare ahead of time. I also added goat cheese to the recipe which really made it more luscious! Great for when the weather is hot!

Couldn't find the golden beets but used the red ones. Followed the recipe with the exception of adding a little rice vinegar to the olive oil. Good presentation on a white or clear plate. Easy to do ahead of time and assemble at the last minute. Would definately do again.
