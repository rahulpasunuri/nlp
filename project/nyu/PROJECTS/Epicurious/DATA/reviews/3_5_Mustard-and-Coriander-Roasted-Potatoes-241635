I accidentally did not remove skins, and, I substituted white wine vinegar for champagne vinegar. Everyone who ate them, really enjoyed them. They went well with a simple flank steak. IMHO, the extra steps regarding the vinegar reduced mustard seeds are worth it. Don't know if it made any difference, but, I crushed my own corriander seeds.

This was decent, but not worth making twice. The mustard seeds turned bitter after being cooking in the vinegar. The finished product was pretty, but there are enough wonderful potato recipes out there that there isn't any reason to make this one again. The dish ended up tasting acidic, not necessarily "mustardy."

make the sauce 1 cup of mayo or low fat mayo 5 garlic cloves squeezed through garlic press mix ingridients and regrigerate 5 large potatoes chopped for roasting salt and pepper to taste 1/4 cup finely chopped parsley (use 1/2 tablespoon of dry parsley if you do not have fresh) 2 garlic cloves squeezed through press olive oil to coat potatoes mix all the ingridients and roast at 400 degrees for an hour until golden brown. I live in high altitude and it takes an hour and a half for me. once the potatoes are done take half the sauce and add a little bit of water (please use bottled water if your city has terrible tap water) until the sauce is half of its original consistency, mix it well and pour it all over your potatoes and mix well.

they r good, but nothing special. I threw the recipe out because I only keep I amazing recipes. i will use coriander seeds and dijon mustard on roasted potatoes again, but without the vinegar and mustard seeds, I will come up with the recipe and post it eventually. I make garlic potatoes which are amazing,I will post the recipe.

This is an amazing and easy recipe that will wow your party guests. I have made it 3 times the first time I had no coriander seeds and used caraway seeds the second time I got the coriander seeds and the third time I added a little more mustard. I never used the mustard seeds and think that is why I used more mustard. Every one raved about them every time. Great companion for beef and chicken.

One of my favorite ways to roast potatoes! Used red potatoes and subbed white wine vinegar.

Our guests made quick work of these. I wish I would have made twice as many. They are strong, but very tasty. I will make these again and again.

Loved it, what a wonderful twist on roasting potatoes! As to "way too salty" comments - one can adjust that easily. It is one of favorites for my teenager who doesn't like mustard or potatoes. I'd say that it is cruicial not to overboil them and to have the oil preheated well.

There are much better ways to make potatoes. We thought the mustard overpowered the flavor of the potatoes and there was a bitter aftertaste. We grow our own potatoes so we look for recipes that enhance the natural flavor of the potato rather than cover it up.

Had dry mustard rather than seeds, so I skipped the reduction step and just made a dressing. The potatoes were wonderfully crispy and flavourful. I didn't find them too salty at all. My guests raved about them. Will definitely make again.

Very flavorful! Couldn't find champagne vinegar but white wine vinegar seemed to stand in admirably. Don't over-boil the potatoes! Starting with a hot pan makes them brown beautifully in the oven.

Absolutely delicious - rave reviews from my dinner guests. Will definitely be making these again!

Served these at a small dinner party last night for first time; can't say they looked as nice as in picture since, once the potatoes are boiled, they tend to lose some of the skin when drying them in the saucepan! You have to be extremely gentle when tossing them...also, I would use double the vinegar, seeds, mustart and coriander part as there isn't enough flavor as is.
