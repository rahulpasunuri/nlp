This was good, but not as good as I expected. I love all the ingredients, but agree that the combo of them is somewhat unique and didn't quite come together for me. I cooked the carrots 6-7 minutes like the recipe states, but think this might be better with more crisp carrots. I will probably try it again and only cook the carrots for a few minutes.

Great use of carrots and the green olives work surprisingly well.

I made the salad yesterday and served it today for brunch. A huge success! I had made two minor changes: first, I used frozen carrots (little balls) and cooked them a little less; second, I used black olives for the look. I can't wait to do it again!

Made this tonight . . . a delicious dish (I served as first course). Pay no attention to all who said they grated raw carrots . . . follow the recipe, as it produces the Alsacean taste. Really delicious.

DD from San Francisco This is one of my all time favorite BBQ salads. I make it over and over again. My guests just love the unique combination of flavors. I enjoy using the unpeeled baby carrots and just cutting them in pieces (I leave the skin on). Wonderful!

Really good and different. I also used the shredded carrots, but be sure to get good brined green olives! Did not need the honey.

The combination of ingredients was intriguing on the page but failed to impress in the finished product. The carrot orange part was acceptable though I think it could have used a lot more spice. It may however be time for me to just accept that I love olives both green and black and I love oranges but for me the combo just doesn't jive.

I was intrigued by the ingredients in this salad, but decided to make it in a different way. I grated raw carrots for a slaw instead of sliced cooked carrots. It was terrific and I will definitely make it again.

I don't normally like green olives but made the saled anyway. Fortunately for me, I live near a Whole Foods store which allowed me to taste the the green olives on their olive bar until I found one I liked. I thought the salad was wonderfully different without being too over the top. I will definitely make again.
