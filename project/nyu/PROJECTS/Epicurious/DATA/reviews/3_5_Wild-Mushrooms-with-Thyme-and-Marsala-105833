Let me preface this by saying I love rich food. However, this recipe was way too rich for me - I couldn't eat more than a few bites. Needs something to cut the heaviness - lemon zest, maybe? I don't think I'd make this particular dish again although I think mushrooms & cream are a natural match.

i loved this dish. make it as a side every thanksgiving. make it day before and i also cut down on cost by using some regular mushrooms.

Wonderful make-ahead addition to Thanksgiving - and will be good for other dinners.

A wonderful addition to my Thanksgiving menu. Made it the day before and the flavors were even better! Might try this over a nice roasted chicken breast next time...YUM!

This dish has become a Thanksgiving staple in our family; I look forward to making it every year! Also, if you don't have Marsala, Madeira is a great substitute.

I didn't have enough wild mushrooms, only a package of dried porcinis and about 1/2 a pound of shitakes, so I basically made duxelles from 1 1/2 pounds of regular mushrooms by sauteeing them until very dry in 2TB of butter, then adding them after the wild mushrooms had begun to cook. I used REAL heavy cream (not the usual ultrapasteurized watery grocery store stuff),which I've only been able to find at Trader Joe's in California, and cooked it about twice the amount of time to reduce the cream even further. Fabulous.

I added a splash of red wine at the very end. Other than that, this recipe is perfect!

I served this for Christmas dinner with pepper steak from the Jan 2002 Bon Appetit. It paired very nicely with filet mignon. I agree with other reviewers thatit might be odd with poultry. The sauce was quite flavorful - wouldn't change a thing there. I think I'll serve the two together again for a Valentine party I'm planning. Can't find the pepper steak on this website to write a review. Check your magazines for the recipe. In RSVP section - fabulous flavor. Sear meat over medium-high heat, not high as indicated in recipe. Butter burns at high temperatures

I found this dish went really well with the rest of a traditional Thanksgiving day menu - I followed the other recipes Bon Appetit suggested for a group of 6 and then added some of the regular favorites and everyone really enjoyed all dishes. I will make it again, but would do fewer shallots - the shallots we got were really big and the flavor seemed too overwhelming.

I really enjoyed the creaminess of this dish - as did the rest of my guests at Thanksgiving. I would definately make it again.

This dish was ok...a bit too rich for the Thanksgiving table. It didn't pair well with what I was serving which was traditional herb turkey etc.
