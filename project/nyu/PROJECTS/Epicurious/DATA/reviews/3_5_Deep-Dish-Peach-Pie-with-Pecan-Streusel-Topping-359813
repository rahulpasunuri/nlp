The filling and streusel were great, but I was very disappointed in the pie crust. I found it difficult to work with and the pie ended up with a soggy bottom. There were no leaks, so I blame the recipe and not my pie making skills. I might try again, but with a different crust (or Pillsbury like the rest suggest).

This is a wonderful pie! I have made it twice this summer with fresh organic peaches. The only thing I changed was I used my mother's pastry recipe. This one is a keeper

Pie was delicious and the streusel crust was great. Switched out 1/3 of the amount of flour for cake flour and the pie crust was the best crust I have ever made - light, flaky and delicious. Warning***Do not place your cookie sheet on the floor of the oven! Mine melted into the enamel of my Wolf oven and will now cost me over $1000 to fix, resulting in a very expensive pie! Hey, at least I can laugh about it.

Not sweet enough or good enough flavor to make again.

The BEST peach pie I've ever eaten. Everyone raved. I used a refrigerator pie dough. The crumble topping is what made this dessert. I'll definitely be making it again - and will be using the crumble on my apple pie too. YUMMY!

Made this for the first time last night and everyone loved it! There was no cardamom in my pantry so that was left out. Also, I used my own pie crust recipe just for the simplicity of it. My peaches came fresh from a local farm-I'm sure that helped the taste too. This pie will be a frequent for my family and guests.

It was not sweet enough for us or have a ton of flavor. I wish I had fresher peaches, maybe that was the problem. But we will not be making this one again. Crust was nice though.

Absolutely delish!! Everyone devoured this pie. The topping was amazing. I used quick cooking oats and forgot to buy cardamom, but it still turned out fantastic. Definitely will make again.

Excellent! Used about 2 1/2 lbs of peaches for a smaller pie. Loved the crust - nice & flaky.

Made a variation of this yesterday with frozen home grown peaches from last year. I used the box crust for simplicity and didn't have tapioca so I used a little flour instead. Love the cardamon and the spices, and the streusel topping is to die for.

Like other reviewers, I chose to use Pillsbury's pie crust (red box) instead of making the one listed in this recipe. The pie was incredibly easy to make this way and came out beautifully. My hubby loved it and I thought it was great. I doubled the tapioca amount due to very ripe peaches and the pie sliced nicely. The topping is what makes this pie unique- yum!

Made it in a regular glass pie plate, shortened the cooking time at 350 to 45 min and it came out perfect! I used another pie crust recipe and made the best ever peach pie! We had it for breakfast this morning with yogurt!

Made this on the BBQ and thought it was okay but agree that you could forego the crust and just make a crumble. We have an abundance of good peaches right now but I think another recipe would do them more justice.

Fantastic. I have made this several times already, and it is loved by all. I simplified it by doing away with the crust all together. I don't have to cook it as long and it is both simpler and healthier. I will cont. to make this over and over again.

This recipe is deadly. All the spices make it and the streusel topping is a great finish. It looked like perfection too!

We really liked the pie and I too used the red box crust which was just fine. My husband requested that the next time I eliminate the nuts from the topping because he didn't like it with the delicious peaches we have been getting here in Ohio. It has been a banner year after not having any local peaches last year because of an untimely frost in the spring. I am making it again today :o)

I am not rating the pastry as I had already made my own and then couldn't remember where I had my usual deep dish peach pie recipe. I doubled the recipe for the humongous pie plate I have and it worked perfectly. The sweetness was perfect and the pie looks beautiful and tasted even better. I will make this again before the peaches are all gone for another year.

I agree with last reviewer. Followed recipe exactly and crust is very soft. In the future will use Pillsbury crust as a base and use same filling recipe. I wish the crust was a little crisper as well...any suggestions on this?

Wonderful recipe. However, because the pie pretty much crumbles when you serve it, it ends up looking like cobbler after you plate it. For this reason, I don't think it's worth the trouble to make the crust from scratch. I used a "red box" crust and it worked just fine.

Excellent- wonderful flavor. A keeper!
