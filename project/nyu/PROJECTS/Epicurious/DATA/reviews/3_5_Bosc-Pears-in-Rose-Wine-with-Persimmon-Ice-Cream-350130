The persimmon ice cream especially, with some persimmon syrup left over as a topping was wonderful and fragrant and was new to everyone served.

I didn't had rose but I had some really yummi pears so I decided to substitute the rose with some dry sherry, and it was great!!!!! I am not a really big fan of persimmon and I think that the taste of the pears with the thyme is elaborate enough, so maybe just using plane good vanilla ice cream? Another similar recipe that I once made suggested some coarse grind black pepper too.. So 3 forks only because I think that persimmon is weird.
