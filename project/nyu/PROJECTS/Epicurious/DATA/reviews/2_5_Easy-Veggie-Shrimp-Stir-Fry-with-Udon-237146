Way too much soy sauce and therefore too salty..

This is not really a "healthy" recipe. Fresh vegetables should probably be substituted, half or all the orange juice should be left out and substituted with orange zest for flavor, more vegetables should be used.....anyway. won't make again. And for taste, DON'T cook your shrimp this long! Shrimp will likely be done cooking in three minutes and will just get rubbery if it cooks longer.

I'm always amazed when recipes call for using frozen vegetables, other than peas. Many fresh vegetables are plentiful, inexpensive and take only a few minutes to prepare. Also, since they are low in calories, why only four ounces per serving?

I'm a little surprised by the calorie count for someone trying to lose weight. You could have 2-3 servings per day without any other food and be done... which would leave me pretty hungry.
