I made a homemade seafood chowder and thought I would try to make some Common Crackers to go along with it. I used this recipe and they turned out great. It was very easy and they were very tasty, on their own or with the chowder. My husband though they tasted similar to a biscuit and the were not as crisp as a cracker. I did need to add a bit more cream than the recipe called for and I did have to cook them 3-4 more minutes more than the recipe instructed. I will be putting this recipe in my recipe box for future use again!
