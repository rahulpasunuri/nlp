I made the recipe exactly as written with one exception. I omitted the salt since the pancetta was so salty to start with. It turned out delicious! Highly recommend it for comfort food when you're also trying to cut fat and use more sustainable meat options.

we used grass-fed ground beef, which made for a very moist and succulent pile-o-meat-goodness - unfortunately it falls apart. I used bacon and found it too rich; I'll use less next time. I also substituted Bullseye Barbecue Sauce for the ketchup, because I hate ketchup. I stand by that choice. If I try this recipe again, I will cut it in half.

I have been making this meatloaf for years and it is a client favourite. I use pancetta as it gives a depth of flavour that bacon cannot match. I don't drape it with pancetta, however, as I find it crisps darkly (which tastes great, but doesn't look so good). Once the pan drippings begin to darken and caramelize, I keep adding a bit of water to deglaze throughout cooking to create a wonderful basting liquid. I find the cooking time is about right...perhaps the other reviewer made a flatter meatloaf to account for quicker cooking time. Freezes great, is wonderful for leftovers. True, it does release fat...but I save the drippings to add to a buffalo stew or soup.

Used bacon instead of pancetta, wih very good results. Great flavor, however it only took about half the time to cook. It releasesa a lot of oil in the oven, i recommend removing it from the dish once it has cooled slightly.
