An easy and delicious recipe. A real crowd pleaser. It does need to be left to broil longer than the recipe says, but but only a few minutes more. I add more peppers and olives as well as some red pepper flakes.

Wow, easy and tasty! Made exactly as stated but needed to broil for longer - about 8 min.

Made for a dinner party and it was well received by all. Cheese did not melt (used TJ's Greek feta) but realized in the photo here that it isn't melted. Was spreadable however which was fine.

Super easy and a big hit at the dinner party I took it to...I mixed the herbs (I added rosemary) with everything (except the cheese) and let it marinate for an hour before I dumped it on the feta and broiled. I agree that the cheese needs to be hot and melty for best texture. Yum!

I've been making this for several years and I always get rave reviews. Very good and a great dish to take to a function. I brought it to the office this morning and it caused a minor traffic jam in the kitchen.

made this recipe exactly as described. Took it to a dinner party with 2 other tasty appetizers (smoked trout pate and tsatsiki. This one got the raves, with guests asking for reviews. Very good and VERY easy.

Can't go wrong with this dish. I've used both Greek and French feta, both are wonderful. I add extra peppers and olives -- usually pitted nicoise -- and serve with both pita crisps and baguette. It's always the first thing to go...

This is a tasty & easy appetizer! It's a MUST to use a good Feta, I love this with French Feta, so creamy when baked!

This is wonderful!!! Everyone asks me for the recipe. However, I do use crumbled feta and add more olives and peppers.

Mmm, I used Lemnos full fat feta, and it was creamy. I didn't broil it, but baked it next to my bread while it finished, about ten minutes at 400 degrees.

I liked this as a part of a Greek meal. I did use Greek feta, which makes a difference because it is generally drier than other varieties. Moreover, I roasted my own red pepper. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out spendidly.

This is so easy and delicious - a quick go to recipe for a last minute dinner party.

If you can't find a brand of feta other than Athenos, which was the case at the grocery store I went to, just leave it in the oven longer to make sure it heats thoroughly. I cooked it on low broil and further from the broiler. My experience was that as long as the cheese gets warmed through and through, it will be creamy. The minute it starts to cool, it returns to the drier consistency. Delicious tasting recipe.

This is in response to reviewers complaining about the Feta not being creamy enough. It's not the dish, it's the type of Feta you use. I used a glorious Israeli Goat's Milk Feta from a store called Central Market. The cheese is creamy and rich on it's own, so it was divine in this dish. Mass produced Feta, such as Athenos, won't cut it in a dish that demands high quality ingredients. I hope that this solves ya'lls cheese issue!

I might make this recipe again even though I would rate it a two and a half if I could because the cheese didn't get really creamy and stayed in chunks even though I did what one of the other reviewers suggested and cut it up. I would have liked it to be a bit more melted for ease of spreading and it didn't have the texture I was hoping for. The flavour was good but the cheese just seemed a bit tough.

Excellent appetizer and so easy! As other reviewers suggested, I doubled the amount of red peppers and olives, and added some chopped tomatoes. Served on a crusty bread.

Will double the peppers and olives next time and cube the cheese to make it easier to dip a pita chip without needing a spreader. May try with some different cheeses as well. Very easy and good.

I love it, easy to prepare and fun to eat. I also used "kashkaval" a sheep's milk cheese from the Balkan region. Sabroso!!!

THIS IS A WINNER!!! NOT ONLY DELICIOUS BUT BEAUTIFUL AND SO EASY.

Good AND easy, combination can't be beat. I used a jar of peppers/garlic in olive oil so added no oil. I did think it would melt a little more, may try another cheese for that affect.

This was wonderful. The recipe is so simple that I don't need to save it. (Now I can show off by making it look like I'm improvising, "What this? Oh, just something I threw together.") The next day, I tossed the left-overs into an omelette. (They would be great tossed w/pasta, too.)

It seems like letting the cheese bake a while longer and then broil might be better, because then it might get a little melty, but it probably depends on the feta.

We loved this recipe!!! Had it as an appetizer on Easter brunch with toasted bagette slices and everyone loved it. The cheese was creamy and warm and the combinations with the olives and roasted peppers was out of this world...

I will definitely make this again. The bottled roasted peppers I used weren't salty at all, so they helped counter the saltiness of the cheese and the olives. I served it with unsalted matzoh during Passover and it was yummy. I like the idea of grape or cherry tomatoes added. I am wondering about keeping this recipe on a warming tray for a buffet. Anyone have any input?

A tasty recipe, but a bit salty. A good jumping spot to use with other ingredients.

Simply delicious and easy, too! I used cubed feta, as that was all that was available. Add a green salad, nice crusty bread, and a glass of wine and you've got a wonderful meal.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit. I let it bake a bit longer than they said under the broiler. Served it with pita triangles. I would make this again for sure

I have made this dish many times, but never as an appentizer. I have always used it as a toping for Lemon marinated chicken. I also added chopped cherry tomatoes.

This is very good. I doubled the olives and peppers and added chopped tomato, and used fresh oregano and added fresh basil. Fantastic.

This was great, quick and easy. Had all the ingredients at hand. Wouldn't change a thing. Great for unexpected company.
