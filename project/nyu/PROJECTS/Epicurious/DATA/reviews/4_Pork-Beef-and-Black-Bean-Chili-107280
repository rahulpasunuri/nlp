I was looking for a use for ground pork and ground beef for chili that I had in the freezer and this recipe fit the bill. I did not have any chuck steak, am anxious to try this again with the chuck included. My husband loved it!! I was generous with the chili powder and added extra cayenne pepper as well.

This is now the only chili I make. Hearty, meaty and full of flavor. Just perfect for cold weather. I have served this to people who have told me for years "Oh I don't like chili" and I get back a bowl that's been scraped clean. The chuck steak gives it great body and the ground pork makes it savory and smooth. I've subbed 1 can of black beans for kidney beans and still had excellent results. What a great chili.

This is quite similar to the style in which my family prepares chili. They don't usually use chunked and ground meats, so I liked that addition. The cilantro at the end was key. I had never considered adding it to chili before, and I doubt I'll ever make chili without it in the future. The recipe, as written, is not spicy enough for my taste, we added a jalepeno and a half can of adobe roasted chili peppers and still didn't find it spicy enough. We used a crock pot, and it overflowed, so definitely use a huge pot. I, like other reviewers, also used dried black beans, and if anyone does that in the future, I recommend cooking them before adding them to the chili, it took forever for them to cook with the rest of the stuff (not that you can overcook chili.

This was a pretty tasty chili, and it was relatively easy to make. It really is just chop, cook, and eat. I would say that you could make it spicier than this recipe calls for. I added a whole chopped jalapeno and extra cayenne and chili powder, and I was still saying to my hubby that it could be spicier. I recommend using a stock pot if you've got it, my 8 qt Le Creuset Dutch Oven was at its max as I was making it, but it all held. Be patient (my mistake) when first adding all the chopped (I didn't dice as I like to have chewy chunks in my chili) veggies. You'll be adding them to what appears a nearly liquidless mixture. I wasn't patient and added some broth to loosen it up, but this wasn't necessary as all those veggies begin to release their own liquid pretty quickly. It just meant I needed to reduce it down longer than the time frame. No complaints, but I'll remember for next time. I also used dried beans that I cooked myself as opposed to canned beans. I'm sure canned works fine, but I prefer fewer canned things in my cooking. Also really give a good salt and peppering to all the meat before you start to cook it. It does wonders for the overall taste, but this is a darn good chili.

This is really good. I slightly increased the amount of spice to give it a little more.

This is a great recipe. It netted me a prize in our Thanksgiving chili cookoff. I made a few modifications based on people's comments here. I braised the meat in beer instead of water. I used chipotle chili powder instead of regular, which added a nice smoky heat on the back end. I used canned seasoned tomatoes instead of fresh. I added a can of diced green chilis for a little extra kick. And I used one can of black beans and one can of white beans. I got so many compliments. I will definitely be keeping this recipe around.

Wow....quite possibly one of my new most favorite chili recipes, with the following chnages. Seasoned the meat and used 1 bottle of good Mexican lager to simmer. Added 1 tsp cinnamon. Substituted chipotle chili powder for cayenne. Used queso fresco instead of cheddar - YUM! Even my two little guys loved it!

Rating: 4
Delicious. Made for a party and it was gone in a flash. I think this chili was a perfect mix of sweet and spice, meat and beans and it wasn't too thick or tomatoey. Just perfect all the way around. I used the beans I had on hand so one can black, one can kidney and one can white/great northern. I also added about 1 Tbls of cocoa powder. Fantastic!!

Rating: 4
Hands down the best chili recipe I've made. Ive made it just like it's written, and its good that way. I've followed a lot of the suggestions like adding beef broth, adding black and kidney beans, using dark beer, adding a piece of dark chocolate, adding a cup of coffee.... and it always turns out fantastic. currently, I used those chunks of "stew beef" that are really cheap, quarter them, brown them in a skillet and use that witht he ground beef and pork. I use a mix of black and kidney beans. I add 2 chipotle peppers that come in Adobo sauce. I use either beef broth or an amber beer to deepen the flavor. I use a mix of red and green bell pepper. Enjoy.

This was great! This got rave reviews while we watched the game last night (go Ravens!). Changed a few things: as suggested by other reviewers, I subbed the 2 c. water for 2 c. beef stock. I also used stew meat from the grocers and slow-cooked it for about 3 hours. I think this had a nice effect on the flavor overall and the veggies in particular. Next time, I will cut the beef even smaller so that there are more beef pieces in every bite. I also had a guest who didn't care for beans, so I left the beans out on the side and it was great with or without them. I also used canned diced tomatoes in the interest of time and opted for diced tomatoes with jalepanos - I don't think there would have been enough heat without it! All in all it was a great success - I HIGHLY recommend.

Rating: 4
Very good, very flavourful and hearty recipe. My son, my husband and I all loved the chunks of steak mixed in with the ground beef and pork - nice enhancement to traditional ground-only chili. I made a few minor tweaks - replaced the two cups of water with 2 cups of beef stock to boost the flavour and blanched and peeled the tomatoes before dicing. Also, I didn't have enough cilantro, so I subbed half the quantity with fresh flat leaf parsley. Lastly, combined black AND kidney beans for some additional 'fun'. All in all.. delicious, hearty, stick to your ribs chili... and now a staple in my recipe file.

Rating: 3
Great recipe, with the addition of a couple of seeded jalapenos and teaspoons of BTB beef soup base. Better if cooked longer and I think that - next time - I'll chop the veggies in larger pieces.

Rating: 4
This recipe is not only terrific, it's very forgiving. I intended to halve the recipe, and ended up using 2 cans of beans, 1 1/2 cans diced tomatoes, 1 can of low salt beef broth, 1/2 lb each ground pork and beef, abt 1 lb chuck steak and another 6 oz left over flank steak. I cut the steak up small -- maybe 1/3 to 1/2" cubes -- which ended up being great. LOTS of cilantro. Maybe a little extra cayenne. Anyway, my point is, manhandle this recipe to suit what you have and what you like. It'll be great.

this was great. my only changes were to use a cocoa chili blend seasoning and adding beer with the tomato paste. family loved it

This recipe is truly incredible! I threw out my recipe from Penzey's. I did add an extra 1/2 tsp. of cayenne, because I do like spicy chili (or you can do dried red pepper flakes). The chuck, ground pork, & ground veal I used made this an extremely rewarding dish. My husband said not to change a thing!

Best chili recipes ever. I always struggle to find a chili recipe that I want to make over and over. This one is that recipe. I added more oregano as suggested but also used 1 can of chili bean, 1 can kidney beans and 1 can of black beans instead of all black. Also, I used mostly ground sirlon and some ground pork--no steak. I added 1 green and 1 red pepper instead of all red. Great flavor--loved by all I served it to.

I added only 1 cup of the broth right after I added the veggies, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. This is outstanding chili . . . perfect January Sunday.

I have always loved Chili but had never made it myself. My sister gave me this recipe to try and my family loves it. My second time around, I omitted the steak and used hot Italian sausage rather than plain pork. It gave it a nice kick. Very Yummy. I actually won a chili contest at work with this one. Go for it - you won't be disappointed.

Rating: 4
Amazingly good chili! As others have noted I had to cook it longer than indicated to take more of the 'crunch' out of the veggies. I also heeded many of the reviews and halved the recipe for the two of us and it still made A LOT (which froze beautifully). Making it again tonight with 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork, both not ground. (I found last time that, whilst the recipe 'as is' makes an amazingly good chili, when my mouth encountered the solid beef instead of the ground meat it had a more satisfying 'mouth feel' to it.)

Rating: 3
This is very good and I will make it again. It makes an enormous quantity, so it's a good way to stock the freezer for winter. I made it as written, and then adjusted the seasonings as per some of the other reviews--increased the sugar to 1 Tbsp., doubled the oregano and the salt. I used Rotel tomatoes--3 cans, drained--and the kick was just enough for us. Served with shredded cheese and a dollop of light sour cream which was nice. Next time I will omit the chuck steak cubes and increase the ground pork and ground beef by 1/2 lb. each instead--just not fond of steak chunks in chili. Be sure to let the flavors marry over a several hour period before adjusting seasoning or serving--it makes a big difference as they do develop quite a lot over time. I think I will also hold off on the cilantro and add it at the end, fresh, just before serving each time--that flavor got lost in the cooked dish.

This chili is the best ever. I've made it many times for different groups of people and everyone loves it. It is a wonderful combination of slightly spicy, slighty sweet, meaty and entirely satisfying and comforting. It goes great with polenta!

agree with some of the other reviews - addtl broth isn't necessary & i actually used about 4 Tbsp of corn masa as a thickening agent to reduce the liquid. this is a great recipe as a base - haven't tried exactly as written, but used 1.5 lbs. ground beef, 0.5 lb. hot italian sausage, added ground coriander and onion powder on top of the other spices, added 2 chopped carrots, canned tomatoes instead of fresh, and used a combination of pinto beans, red beans, and black beans. this is delicious, and will definitely be my go-to chili recipe!

This is our go-to red chili. It is saucy, meaty and delicious, not to mention easy to make. The only change we make is a little more spice, either jalepenos or chipotle paste (note: also adds some smoke). Make a large batch and freeze some, it reheats just fine though you might need to add a spot of broth/stock.

Oh my goodness, this chili was delicious. I didn't follow the recipe exactly but I did follow the proportions of spices listed, which were very well-balanced. I also added a bit of ground coriander and some adobo sauce from a can of chipotle chilies in my fridge. I found that when made just with ground beef there wasn't any need to add extra stock, but I will definitely have it on hand for the next time I make this with all three kinds of meat. I'm thrilled to have found a go-to chili recipe that is also pretty flexible.

Cooked this chili with about 3/4 cup more each of the tom's, onions, and bell peppers. Also used cubed tri- tip steaks seasoned with my favorite butcher's rub instead of chuck steak. Added 1 small finely diced serrano chile as well to heat it up. Turned out great and with it I won the Chili Cook-Off at work, to rave reviews.

Rating: 4
I followed this recipe exactly as written except I used only 2 cups of beans (pinto and kidney). My boyfriend and I both thought this chili was amazing. We both really liked the cubed chuck steak and I would recommend NOT leaving it out as some other reviewers have done. I did follow the advice of some and chopped the steak into 1/2" cubes which I would also recommend doing. Every time I make chili I use a new recipe but we both liked this one so much that I will stick with this one. It also made ALOT. At least 12 servings!

Rating: 4
This really is exceptional. I found the recipe and noted some of the reviewer's suggestions on the print out, but my husband made it. He used 2 C. of beer (in place of water, and 1/2 each of dark and regular beer); he used 1 Tbs each of mild chili and chipotle chili powder (pleeeenty spicy that way); skipped the cayenne; used one 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes w/ added puree; used 2 C. of diced onion and 2 green bell peppers. He didn't add the beans, but cooked some separately for people to add if they chose to do so. Next time, after browning the meats we'll remove them then sautee the onion/pepper mix. That'd give more flavor and would minimize the veggie crunchiness (we ended up simmering the chili for a few hours, lid on, for the same effect). This served 6 with enough leftovers for 2, so I wouldn't plan on it serving 10.

This chili was delicious and super easy to throw together. I substituted: a mixture of beef stock and dark stout for the 2 cups of water, and canned diced tomatoes with green chiles for the diced fresh tomatoes. I also used a mix of pinto beans and black beans. Since we like our chili extra extra spicy, I also added several chopped fresh jalapeno peppers, chipotles in adobo, and a small can of diced green chiles. I served with grated cheddar and diced avocado on top to balance the heat.

I have been making either vegetarian chili or turkey chili for several years now. I tried this recipe this week. WOW! This is great chili!

I made this with dry black beans that had been soaked and rinsed for a couple of days (instead of canned). I also substituted 2 3/4 cups soaked, dry red beans for the steak to make it less expensive, and to cut the saturated fat. It turned out great! If you are using dried beans, soak 'em, rinse 'em, and throw them in right after all the veggies. Then add 5 cups broth (instead of 2 like the recipe says) and let it simmer on med/low for an hour or two. Delicious!

We love this chili; it's a great starter base and we make it a few times every winter. However, it's not quite hot enough for my taste.

This chili was fantastic. It makes a generous amount -- my boyfriend and I ate it for over a week! I included an entire head of garlic, and a whole can (~2.6oz) of chipotles in adobo which I then chopped. I ended up using 1.5 lb ground beef (couldn't afford steak), and 1 lb ground pork. I added 1 tbsp of paprika and used brown sugar. To get the right consistency I only needed 1 can of beef broth, because I used extra peppers/onions which added liquid. Next time I'm going to try using dark beer in place of water, but even without it the chipotles really give the chili a smoky kick!

Great chili! A crowd pleaser! Made subs as recommended by these reviews: beer, extra veggies, chilis in adobo, etc. Will make it again!

This is a solid chili: good foundation and solid taste. It's not knock your socks of amazing though, like the Cashew Chicken Chili (with chocolate!) on this site. Red peppers make an interesting add, and of course having black beans instead of kidney beans also makes for an interesting twist. But this dish only fares "good, not great". I'd make it again, but not when hosting the Queen of England (who frankly doesn't like any kind of chili, but I digress).

Yummy! Minor subs still resulted in fabulous chili... Cooked the onion & pepper first, then set aside to be added according to recipe order. Used beef/pork/veal mix, and 1/4 inch cut sirloin. Drained off the fat! Replaced water with dark beer. Added one finely chopped "chipotle in adobo", one tablespoon smoked paprika, and a dash of cinnamon. This chili is not very spicy so add more kick if you want/need it! Even though I don't consider myself a fan of cilantro the end result is totally delicious - I can't wait to try the leftovers!

This is an excellent, pretty basic chili recipe.

Made a few changes and everyone raved, even my husband and he doesn't "like chili". Here's what I did: Beer instead of water, course ground chuck instead of cubes, canned diced tomatoes with juice, added chipotle powder, crushed red pepper, sriracha pepper sauce omitting sugar, and half black-half kidney beans cuz that's what I had on hand. It was spicy but not too hot.Will be making this again the same way soon - it was fabulous.

Maybe I should reserve judgement until this has aged a couple of days. As is, okay not great. 2 TBS of cumin are too much and the cayenne adds heat but not much flavor. May add some ancho chili powder the next time or chipotle. Not sure the diced red pepper adds much either - I got some skin in several bites. Black beans are a nice complement. Made exactly per the recipe, only substitution was good canned diced tomatoes rather than fresh. Will make again but ahead of time to allow flavors to develop.

The only thing I do no matter what the recipe for chili calls for is to add a little bit of masa or cornmeal at the end to both thicken and add that special flair.

My boyfriend is still talking about this delicious chili. I followed the recipe for the most part and found the amount of liquid, etc, to be just about right, although I did take the advice of other reviewers and added way more spices, jalapenos, etc. I also added a couple of squares of unsweetened chocolate, which really gave it great depth of flavor. Next time, I'll use half beer/half stock for extra richness. The blend of meats gives wonderful texture - I might add more steak cubes next time. Definitely better the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th day, and amazing out of the freezer. A keeper!

I made this for Halloween night and my family loved it. We all liked the chuck steak, (I used 2 lbs instead of just one). I also doubled the cumin to 4 Tbsp and 5 Tbsp chili powder and substituted the 2 cups water for one 12 oz bottle of dark beer. The beef broth really adds alot at the end. I cooled it in the fridge overnight to let the flavors really seep. It was fantastic the next day. I served it with Fritos "scoops."

I made this with 3 lbs of ground beef only, as that was what I had on-hand. I'm sure I sacrificed a little flavor as a result. I used some yellow and green bell peppers, which resulted in a super-colorful chili - but tastewise, this recipe is pretty standard.

Awesome chili! Made it for a big crowd, doubled the recipe and it turned out great. I added extra ground beef, after I added all the veggies, as it seemed very veggie-heavy, and I was serving to a meat loving crowd. (I just browned the ground beef separately then added in at the end.) I also added the beef broth before simmering for the 30 minutes, as it was very dry when I added the veggies. Served with cornbread and cheddar cheese and sour cream. A huge hit at my party. Will make again!

Awesome chili. Particularly like the small black beans. Believe me, its a welcome variation from the same old, same old red kidney beans. Plus, I didn't fart as much after I ate them. I made the recipe pretty much as written except I used rib-eye steak instead because I know people at the meat plant and I get it got 2.50/lb. With this chili the cilantro, fresh tomatoes and black beans work really good together. Next time I'm going to use chunked up deer meat instead of the beef. I'll just have to simmer longer before adding the veggies to the mix. Stay tuned, I'll let you know. Fo'Sho' my nizzles

I followed the suggestions of others and used a 12oz beer + 4oz of beef broth. I never used anymore than that, and it was the perfect consistency. I made it on a Friday night for Super Bowl Sunday and found I still had to add more spices before serving. I added way more than the recipe called for on all the seasonings, especially the chili powder and the cayenne pepper. What I got after it sat was a medium kick after you ate it. Next time I plan to use more tomatoes, onions and red peppers so they don't get hidden, more chuck beef so there's a few in every bowl, and I plan to put a whole jalapeno pepper in to season and take it out before I serve. I also served it with cornbread in addition to the shredded cheese. Play around with it, it's a very stable recipe.

This was only an OK dish. The flavors of the 3 meats did not come thru and the spices were so mild. Maybe I just like a more flavorful chili. I would add a jalapeno or 2 and more cumin. This was very hearty, but even my husband was not totally impressed and prefered my chili instead.

Since there are no beans in Texas Chili, nothing can be floating, black beans are the perfect filler, belive me I had to hide them many times at the cookoff's. I love the fact that there are more cooks like me out there, in addition to this great recipe try to make it like Hungarian gulasch. The ultimate trick is to go to your butcher, ask him to mix 60%/40% beef and pork (80/20),add bellpepper,some onion, garlic&spices at the same time and let it sit in your fridge over nite. 2 things will happen, your meat has taken in the flavor, and it won't stick to you iron skillet when you brown it. Now back to the gulasch; once the meat is browned ~ 20 min. over high heat, lower the heat, add your beer soaked onions - 2 inches high on top, add a tps of caraway seeds, marjoram and the rear of the chili seasoning, cover and simmer until onions have almost disolved, add canned tomatoes and finish. and by the way, the rules at the world champion chili cookoff in Texas are cubed meat only enjoy

I made this for Super Bowl. I was a bit apprehensive serving this as I got a little carried away with the beer (1 can). As I had made this the day ahead of time, it mellowed out by serving time. As for the spices....well, some people must really like it "fire hot"...I didn't need to add much more than was stated. I liked the texture of the three meat. Rinse off the beans really well and you won't have the after effects the next day

Wonderful chili recipe. I used all the previous suggestions, including adding beer, more spices and cooking it longer. I had another chili recipe which called for some soy sauce ( I know, sounds weird but it gives it some extra flavor without tasting like soy sauce) so I added this as well. My husband liked it better the second time around after I froze it!

Made for Superbowl yesterday, and was a hit, even w those who aren't big chili fans. I followed previous advice and subst. out the water, and added wine and beef broth. The chili was definitely tasty, however, I did have to spice it up a bit... I added 2-3x the spices and a fresh jalepeno. Still will try for more of a kick next time. Will absolutely make again.

This was a great chili recipe thanks to all the suggestions and I have one of my own if you like some spice - add 1/2 can of chipolte peppers in adobo sauce. Gives it a kick w/ a nice smoky flavor.

This was wonderful! It tasted just the way I imagine chili should taste. Having read the previous comments before cooking, I made a few adjustments to the recipe. I increased the chili powder and the cumin by one and a half times. I changed from generic chili powder to ancho chili powder. I substituted turkey for the pork. And finally, I used 12 oz. ale and 4 oz. beef broth instead of the the 2 cups of water. I served this for a dinner party of 4. Everyone served themselves very large portions and amazingly, they all finished. In addition to the adults, one of the young children ate it with gusto too. I am quite happy the recipe made so much - now I have some to freeze.

This is the best chili recipe I've ever found. I've made it several times and it's always a hit. I use more cumin and chili powder than called for, but that's just my personal preference. For extra-good flavor, make it a day or two in advance - it improves with sitting.

Thanks everyone for your tips. I used many of them and this turned out just spectacular! For starters, I couldn't find ground pork, so I used the mixture of ground pork, veal and beef that you find in the meat section as a meatloaf mix. I followed the suggestion of cutting the sirloin into 1/2 pieces and marinated it for about 1/2 hour in Goya's Mojo marinade - one of my all-time quick favorite marinades at a bargain for $2.00 for a big bottle. I used fresh tomatoes even though they aren't in season. I used one cup of Killian's Red beer in place of one cup of water. Many of you said it was too watery. Don't forget to drain and rinse the black beans before adding. I only used two cans of the beef broth and I added one 3-inch minced Jalapeno pepper. It added just enough kick so that I didn't have to add any additional spices. It did take some time in preparation and next time I will double the recipe and freeze half. After letting this sit in the fridge overnight, my husband took it to his tailgating party. He just called and said that even though two guys were chewing Tums, they all asked if I could make it for the next home game which is in two weeks. (These are tailgaters of 37 years.) Thanks to everyone for making me look like a great cook!

Chili exactly the way I like it; lots of meat, peppers and beans. I have made this several times. The first 2 times I made only 1/3 and used ground turkey. This time I made the whole recipe but used 2.5 lbs ground beef total. The beef is waaaay more flavorful. Also, I started using canned, diced tomatoes to save time, which is just as good, but this adds more liquid so I don't get to add as much broth (I might drain the tomatoes next time so I can add more broth for flavor). Also, like the others I have to double or triple the spices, particularly the cayenne and chili. And I add 2 fresh serrano chilis. Also, I like it with kidney beans. Love this dish, it's going to get me through finals!!!

Excellent chili. I would have given it four forks, but saying it's "a dish beyond compare" seems like hyperbole for anything that I can successfully cook. It's really easy, and I doubt it would matter if you left, say, the initial two pounds of meat browning for too long or something. I didn't mess with the recipe and liked it very much. Like others said, you wind up with a massive pot of the stuff.

Blue ribbon chili. Had won 2 previous chili contests with a different recipe, but saw this one and knew to try it. This recipe won on the first time I made it. Used elk instead of beef, always a trump card!

Like other reviewers, I used 1 cup of red wine instead of water,substituted ground turkey breast and very low fat ground sirloin, as well as dobling the spices and adding corriander. But, what I feel made it was the roasted red peppers and garlic tomato paste. Delicious, especially with some grated sharp cheddar on top.

This is good chili but it is not very hot at all. I am going to add alot more chili powder. Maybe not all chili powders are the same. I like all the chunky vegetables and cilantro. This is a very classic chili recipe. Nothing unusual or out of the ordinary. I guess that was what I was looking for and this is not it.

I made this last night for a Superbowl party. It was incredible!! I made a double batch for leftovers and barely had any left. Instead of chuck roast, I used sirloin, since it is more tender. I used 2 pounds sirloin in place of 1 pound chuck roast. Other than that, I made no adjustments or changes. I made it a day in advance, as recommended on this site. I served it with cornbread, shredded cheddar and sour cream. It was definitely a hit and I will make it again and again!!

This is an excellent recipe for a classic chili. To make it even better though, I would replace the vegetable oil with the same amount of rendered bacon fat and double the amount of chili powder. I would definitely make it again!

Terrific chili recipe!! I had to make a few modifications to the recipe because I cooked it in my crockpot: omitted the water and just used 14 1/2 ounces of beef broth; cut the tomato paste and the beans to 2 cans each and I used a 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes rather than fresh. This pretty much filled my 6 qt. slow cooker! Can't wait to make it again...

This was very good chili, but adding three cans of tomato paste was too much. I had to add about seven cups of water to get the right consistency. I'll cut it back to two cans at most next time. Other than that, awesome chili!

This recipe was good, but not great. I think it could have done without the ground pork. I particularly like the pork tamale potpie recipe on this web site for ground pork, and felt it was a little too much on this dish. I also added more spices, as suggested.

New chili recipes are always welcome in this house! This recipe is actually quite a bit heavier on the meat than our usual - we tend to emphasise the beans and peppers - but it was a hit. Did not use the beef broth as I used canned tomatoes and that added quite a lot of liquid. After reading the reviews I will use it next time, though. Used about four times the amount of chili powder called for - it seemed wimpy, but maybe that was my supermarket chili powder! Added a generous blop (scientific measurement eh?) of a sweet habanero sauce as well, that added just the right amount of heat.

Chili is an artform....well okay, so is all food...but especially chili! This recipe is really very good, but I still couldn't resist applying my own interpretive perspective. Just for fun, use pinto and black beans....either canned and drained, or if using dried, cook them separately WITHOUT salt and on low temperature for about 4-6 hours the night before. Substitute ancho and habenero chilies (ground or fresh), and add a few chopped pickled jalapeno (use chilies to taste...I like mine hot. Use a large tin of italian tomatoes - chopped, not pureed! Throw in a teaspoon of ground coriander. Don't forget the cumin and fresh cilantro.

I am like one of the previous reviewers, in that this has become my new chili recipe. I have made it MANY times since seeing it in the Nov 2002 issue. It freezes very well. I make a big batch, then freeze it in smaller portions. Reheated it is just as delicious as when I made it, and I have received rave reviews from colleagues at work. This is so easy, and the combo of the ground pork, cubed steak, cilantro and red peppers tickles our taste buds. I don't use the beef broth either, as I find the consistency is perfect and it doesn't need it.

This is my new chili recipe. I love the combination of meats and the cube steak gives it a great texture. I omitted the cilantro (don't like it much) and beef broth (didn't need it). I substituted 2 cups of dark beer for the water. Served with Tostitos Scoops chips. Excellent!!

Not as impressed as I'd hoped to be. Smelled delicious cooking, but my husband & I were both disappointed. I even followed the recipe closely(which I don't usually)but will stick with my own recipe from now on. Just didn't stand out from other recipes like other reviewers said.

This makes an excellent chili. I especially liked the black beans instead of the usual kidney beans. I did make some significant changes: I used ground moose instead of beef and I chopped a pork chop and some beef round. I substituted a bottle of dark beer for some of the water. I also used canned tomatoes and omitted the cilantro. It was a great chili.

We've made this a half-dozen times so far and love it. I'm not so sure that I can resort to a "best ever" level of hyperbole, but in truth this recipe gets pretty damn close.

I made this for a SuperBowl party and everyone loved it. This was the only entree that was all eaten by the end of the game and I am talking about a group of very finicky eaters, too. I followed the recipe exactly but perhaps next time, I will reduce the amount of ground meat for more of the cubed steak meat as I enjoyed the texture of the cubed meat. Wonderful recipe!

Yum!! I have been making Half Time Chili also from this site as a regular but this is even better!!

Very tasty indeed. A nice dinner for those winter nights when the snow is blowing outside. I used some pork shoulder as well that I seared before adding to the pot. Also I added a can of green chilies. I used pancetta (Italian bacon)to start the receipe off before adding the other ingrediants. The pancetta was drained and then I added it back to the pot. I will definately make this chili again.

Pretty good chili....I try to experiment with different types. I like the 3 different meats, suggestion cut the beef into smaller cubes..1/2 inch..I also added a bottle of beer in the beginning which resulted in no need for the beef broth. Used dark beer, I will never make chili again without putting in beer. For something different (chicken chili)I highly recommend the "Tax Payers Chili" on this web site
