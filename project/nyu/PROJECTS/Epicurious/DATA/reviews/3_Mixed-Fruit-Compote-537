Simple and excellent for fresh fruit. I used 2 teaspoons real vanilla from Mexico instead of the vanilla bean and increased the lime juice to 2 teaspoons because I used more fruit. The recipe made enough syrup for 6 cups of fruit. Chill syrup and add to freshly cut fruit about 2 hrs. before serving. None of the fruit turned brown, including the bananas. I used nectarines, apples, pears, banana, strawberries and a few dried cranberries. Delicious!

I just love the extra zing that the lime juice gave this syrup. Served this along with the Zucchini, Sun Dried Tomato, and Mozarella tart from this site for a church-lady lunch. Perfect-sweet with the savory.

Simple & easy. I used it for strawberries and mangos and loved it. I only used about 1/4 of the syrup on the fruit.. just kept adding until it tasted right.

I used the Sara Moulton version of this recipe that uses 2 Tbsp. of lemon juice and 1 tsp. of vanilla extract. It was part of my brunch menu today and it was a big hit. I'll triy the lime juice next time.

Too sweet-- the vanilla syrup was delicious, but the recipe made too much for the specified amount of fruit. I only used half of what the recipe made and it was still too sweet.
