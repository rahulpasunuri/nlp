This was a hit at the church potluck on Easter Sunday. The broth you get after draining the root vegetables is really wonderful too.

Yum!Just served this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it! Here are my modifications: used 2-3 med sized Yukon Gold potatoes instead of the 3 pounds called for; added about 3 white turnips (these were very mild). After cooking the vegetables, instead of adding butter, I used about 3 1/2 oz of reduced fat cream cheese (Neaufchatel cheese), and a splash of buttermilk.I know that may seem odd, but I try to find alternatives for butter where it's possible. Will definitely make again - at which time I'll add the bay leaf and dried thyme which somehoe I ocmpletely forgot with all the other things going on. Also forgot about the caramelized onions. Yikes! But point is - the basic mash is delicious and didn't really need a whole lot else.

Really good on a cold winter night

I've made this numerous times and it's always a huge hit. I brought it to a pot luck lunch and the crowd practically licked the pot clean!

Have made this several times now. Even vegetable-phobic young boys have said they like it, and adults request it. More garlic, less butter, more salt, all good. A versatile dish.

For those of you who find this recipe bland, try adding salt to the vegetables when boiling them. It will really punch up the flavor of everything.

4, maybe even 5 forks. Can be made a day before and onion topping made right before it is baked. It is simply delicious and onion topping makes it sensational. Always a hit on Thanksgiving with either beef or turkey. Leftovers, if there are any, reheat beautifully.

This was just okay. A lot of work for "just okay". I followed the recipe exactly. I make a better casserole with rutabaga and apples.

Made this for T-Day. Delicious and easy and can be made in advance and held -- what more could you ask for? Even forgot to add the butter to the mash and it was still yummy!

Don't change a thing. Perfect side for Thanksgiving.

I made this last year and it was delicious. I did not use any parsnips, I just doubled the rutabaga. Even those that had never had rutabaga enjoyed it. I am making it again this year. Easy because you can make it the night before and pop it in the oven just before dinner.

A bit of a mess to make, but very good. Be sure to cut the rutabagas smaller than the potatoes as they take longer to cook.

Easy, very good, quick. I did it a little different. I sauteed the onions in olive oil and added ground thyme as they cooked. It came out very flavorful!

To me, it's not Thanksgiving without mashed potatoes and rutabagas, so I was thrilled to find this casserole recipe 12 years ago. I use an equal amount of rutabagas in place of the parsnips, always make it the day before, and then bake it just before serving. Everyone loves it and it has easily replaced my great grandmother's original recipe as the new family tradition.

I made this dish for potluck and it went over very well. I really liked the carmelized onions, but felt the flavor of the potatoes was somewhat bland. I would probably mix chives into the mix next time.

Made it for a potluck and it was a big hit! As others said, used much less butter and it was still creamy and had a nice buttery flavor. The onions are what made it so unique. Will definately make again!

YES I KNOW THAT LEAVING THE CAPS ON IS CONSIDERED "SCREAMING" IN E-MAIL. THAT IS WHAT I INTENDED! I WILL NEVER MAKE MASHED POTATOES AGAIN. THIS IS THE BOMB!!! I'VE BEEN MAKING MASHED POTATOES SINCE I WAS TWELVE. THAT WAS 33 YEARS AGO. WHERE HAS THIS RECIPE BEEN ALL MY LIFE? Enjoy!

This is a fabulous alternative to plain old mashed potatoes or sugary sweet potatoes. Not difficult to make. I mashed them all together with an old-fashioned hand masher rather than a mixer, so the consistency still had some lumps. Definitely a keeper.

Fantastic. Even my two boys who hate most vegetables, loved this. Went light on the parsnips(1/2 of what was called for) because their taste is a bit harsh. And added a few tablespoons of cream and maybe a 1/4 cup milk. SO good.

i have made a similar dish to this where you also boil some sweet potatoes and carrots. then you put alternating spoonfuls of each mashed mixture (white and orange) into the baking dish and swirl them with a utensil to get a marble-effect. very pretty.

This is so good! I made it several hours before a party, then just heated it up when the entree (roast lamb) was ready. It would be equally good with roast beef. Definitely a keeper!

A definite WOW!! Served it for a Christmas dinner party for 10 and everyone raved. Had left overs and served it for Christmas dinner (2 days later) and my parents raved as well. WONDERFUL flavor. As a previous reviewer said, don't skimp on the butter, yes it's ALOT but the result is amazing. I'm adding this to my make again, and again file!

This is divine! I've made this several times and now my family requests this dish at all our get-togethers. The fact it can be made ahead of time is key for me. I did cut down on the amount of butter when mashing. I just used a bit of the cooking liquid and half the butter instead.

Loved this recipe. We added more garlic and used vegetable broth to accomodate our vegetarian guests and it was a hit!

This is a great make ahead dish for Thanksgiving or anytime. I have made it over and over and love it every time. For those that want to cut the butter -- save the calories elsewhere. I do add additional pressed, raw garlic while mashing as I love garlic potatoes.

Thought this dish came out kind of bland. I halved the recipe and although the onion layer was good, I would choose plain mashed potatoes over this dish. Less work too!

This is tasty. I cut the recipe in half, and for a while thought I had also cut the butter in half, as people suggested, but I mistakenly use the correct amount of butter for half the recipe. Still, I did not find the butter to be overwhelming and think it adds a creamy sweetness. Next time I'll be sure to use half just to cut calories by 300 or so.

Wow. This is incredible. And I even hate rutabagas. As a previous reviewer noted - all that butter just isn't necessary. I sprayed the dish with olive oil, and seriously decreased the butter in the mash and in the onions. It still came out really well.

Comfort Food just reached a whole new level !!! We have vegetarians in our family so I always substitute with vegetable broth. I have been making this since it first appeared in the mag...our family has even nicknamed it "The Bagi" ! This came about when my Mom and Gramma watched me struggle peeling the huge rutabaga for the first time in my life ! My Gramma commented that no recipe could be worth what she was watching ! On the last day of her visit, she asked for the magazine so she could copy down the recipe !! Our whole family feels blessed when we have the chance to enjoy "The Bagi" together !!

I'm surprised none of the previous reviewers commented on the amount of butter in this dish. I used less than half the butter, 1/4c for the onions and about 1/6 c in the vegetables. Next time I'll use less on the onions. It was great and tasted very buttery as it was!

Excellent. This has become a family favorite for Thanksgiving.

This combo is the BEST! Throughout the meal, I heard nothing but "THIS IS DELICIOUS, WHERE DID YOU COME UP WITH THIS RECIPE"! I, without a doubt, will make this over and over again. Very, Very YUMMY!

I made this for Thanksgiving and no one could believe it was "Rutabaga"! I added a turnip for some snap, some extra butter, coriander, chopped onions and a little sugar to the base and instead of carmelized onions, used the boxed french fried onions. It was a smash!

This was a great recipe. I made it on a whim one night. It was so much fun to make. I plan on making it again for a Thanksgiving potluck. I would however add a bit more flavor next time. I think putting layers of Swiss cheese in the casserole would be great. I sprinkled some course ground black pepper on top before baking, that was nice. Try it out.
