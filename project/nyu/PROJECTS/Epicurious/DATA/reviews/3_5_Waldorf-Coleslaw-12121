Followed recipe as written but used Greek yogurt and half Napa cabbage. Delicious. Will make again and again.

Just ok. I followed the recipe exactly, but found the slaw pretty bland.

Didn't have any apples, used "craisins", turned out great.

Very nice. It scales easily down to serve two or four: three cups of cabbage, on celery stalk, one apple, etc. I used hazelnuts because they were what I had, and subbed hazelnut oil for the cooking oil. The yogurt isn't essential; I used all mayo.

Wow!!! absolutely delicious. I also increased the mayo and yogurt to 3/4 cup each and added roquefort (blue cheese) to the dressing and left a bit for garnish as well, an absolute hit.

I made this recipe with a few variations and it's one of my favorites! (as well as my friends') add the juice of one lemon. use 3/4 c each mayo and yogurt. use olive oil instead of canola. and fuji apples work great. makes good leftovers. make it simple with just cabbage and the sauce. it's always good.

I made this with packaged coleslaw mix. The only changes I made otherwise were to omit the walnuts (which I didn't have) and to substitute a different variety of apple (spartan). Served 10 generously (with a small bowl left over). Guests really liked it. I made it a couple of hours ahead of our BBQ, which was convenient.

This recipe is simply delicious, although I thought it was a little more time consuming to make than other reviewers. I made this for two parties and it was a hit at both. I made one addition and that was to add blue cheese to the dressing, the blue cheese goes really well with the apples and in my opinion makes this recipe even better. This is a must try.

Excellent twist on coleslaw. Both my husband and I loved it. A keeper and company worthy. Simple too.

A really nice change from standard coleslaw. Great mix of flavors with plenty of crunch and the yogurt takes the guilt factor down.

I made this for a simple dinner party to serve with vegetarian lasagna. The dressing was fantastic -- everyone wanted the recipe. I only used about 2/3 of the head of cabbage that I bought, and still had enough salad for 12 hearty appetites with a bit leftover.

I used less oil than the recipe required and it tasted fine.

I found this recipe to be very disappointing. I made it the day before serving, as the recipe suggested, and found that the walnuts got soggy and the salad took on uni-color, washed-out look. Even though it feeds a large crowd, if it is not appealing, what's the point?

This makes a very large salad- I used about 2/3rds of the bagged coleslaw and added dried cranberries which added some nice color and taste. Great for a holiday potluck.

I served this cole slaw at a party and everyone wanted the recipe to make it later. I sent people home with little containers of it for snacks. The only drawback is that this recipe makes LOTS of slaw, probably more than your family will need for half a week of servings.
