Great salad - could be a summer meal, but we had it for Thanksgiving. I was worried about the dressing after reading some of the review comments. Ultimately I went with it and it was delicious - the sweetness of the beets and grapefruit eliminate any sharpness. I would imagine if your grapefruit isn't sweet, it would throw the balance off. A satisfying and filling salad without meat, cheese or nuts.

I had gotten both beets and grapefruit in my CSA box and thought I'd try this recipe to use both items. I am really sorry I did. My husband and I took only one bite of this salad and threw the rest out. The bitter of the grapefruit just didn't blend well with the sweetness of the beets.

Someone mentioned a pomegranite salad dressing, and I found one here - you probably could skip the cumin if you like: http://www.kitchencaravan.com/recipe/spiced-pomegranate-dressing

good starting point with the colours... i used pomegranete molassas/lemon/olive oil dressing as it goes well with grapefruit instead and was very pleased with the result!

Although this salad sounded absolutely wonderful, I was not overly impressed. The combination of flavors would have been great if the dressing pulled them all together, but it did not. The flavors ended up competing too much. It does make for an absolutely GORGEOUS-looking salad!

Excellent! We had it for Thanksgiving last year & it was a hit, young and old alike.

This has become my regular party salad recipe, not just holidays, and everyone want the recipe. Sorry to read that someone found it "bitter" but that could only be due to poor-quality oil. Try it on the beets, avocado, etc., instead of on a spoon--it works!

Great combination of flavors, but I also improvised by using a light citrus dressing instead too. Try using golden beets if you can get them because it makes for a nice presentation.

I loved the combo as a salad but the dressing was too acidic - I added some honey to cut the tartness.

3/4 cup of oil? I tried but no matter what type of "fixing" would cause me to drown my salad in this bitter mixture. Nice salad combo but I ended up using a light citrus dessing instead.
