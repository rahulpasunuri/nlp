We found this very tasty -- quite spicy, so those who don't like a lot of heat might want to cut back on the spices. I used 2 cans of pinto beans and halved the water to just 3 cups. It came out perfectly -- not soupy at all.

I cut down the chili powder and used the full amount of Worcestershire sauce, no salt and no extra pepper. It was still spicy enough to make my mouth burn - but it was well worth it. I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. For anyone interested, a portion comes to only 2.5 points for weight watchers.

I've made this recipe 3 times and it's always a hit! I used one can of pinto beans instead of dried, and I didn't add the water. My husband loves this chili, and it comes out perfect everytime.

Great blend of ingrediants beyond the typical chili. My chili was not watery at all - I admit I used canned beans and then did not add the water. The bulghur adds a really great chewy texture to the chili - excellent & different. I like to eat this chili with a little bit of fruilano cheese on top. Definitely will make this again!

We enjoyed this "meatless" chili. The recipe makes quite a large amount. Recommend that smaller households 1/2 the recipe. Additionally I would recommend using canned beans and preparing one day ahead as the chili was fairly soupy when made but after one day of refrigeration the bulgur expanded and resulted in a more "meaty" consistency.

I serve this chili at our Halloween party every year with cornbread and salad. The barley gives the chili a ground meat-type texture, and the kalamata olives add a nice salty flavor. This chili is great for a vegetarian main dish at potlucks if you substitute veggie broth for the chicken broth. I usually also substitute canned pinto beans for dried.

My family and me enjoyed this recipe very much. It's nutritious and economical to make. I also sprinkled a little cheddar cheese on it when I served it.
