LOVED THIS RECIPE. Made it for Christmas dinner this year and it was a big hit. The madeira sauce was excellent. First time ever that I've made Prime Rib instead of Turkey for Christmas. It might become a tradition!

This is to die for!!!! EVERYONE loved it. Only change I did was taking some of the onions that carmelized with the meat and added it to the sauce along with the herbs (then discarded) - WOWZA! This has become a staple at our xmas dinner.

Oh, madeira sauce, where have you been all my life? This dish is ridiculously good, and as easy as any special occasion main course there is. Like start it while you're already on your 3rd glass of wine good. Many thanks to the folks who recommended doubling the butter/flour at the end - it was the only change I made and I'll do it that way every time. We cringed a bit at the price of the roast, but my husband has already begged that I make this dish again for his birthday. Truly outstanding!

Help! I wanted to do this recipe but didn't want to spend the money on prime rib. I asked the butcher what I can use instead and he gave me a bottom round, but now i'm looking online and everywhere is telling me I shouldn't roast it, that it will be too tough. What should I do? I really wanted to do this recipe and I don't want to ruin it!

I have made this every Christmas day for the last 5 years. It is awesome. I highly recommend this delicious preparation. The sauces are amazing with it. I usually serve it with Mashed potatoes made from Yukon Gold Potatoes and butter and milk.

my goodness What a simple smash hit! this could not be easier and fool-proof. I would make this again and only change is less onion, But I love onion.. the meat finished sooner than expected.. I left the onions in for about 20 minutes longer and I added some balsamic vinegar to them.

My husband and I made this for the first time this Christmas for our family. It was absolutely outstanding!!! We eat a lot of beef here in Texas, and this was an amazing recipe that everyone enjoyed. The madeira sauce was out of this world, and of course, you cannot serve prime rib without horseradish sauce. Both delicious! Will make again and again! Don't have to be an expert chef to master this recipe.

First of all I don't eat Prime Rib, I'd love to, but can't get the texture past my head. OK now that I have said that my son was wining about having Prime Rib for Christmas so I made this. He said that if he was on death row this is the last meal he would ask for. Honestly everyone loved the Prime Rib and the Madeira Sauce was deep and dark with rich flavor. I would roast it a little longer to about 128 or 130 degrees because it was a little too rare for some of the guests(husband). They loved the flavor and are so happy there is leftovers(bought a big one). I bought the horseradish sauce works just as good. Guests took home their leftovers. Oh yeah I had turkey.

Made the Madeira sauce last night for Christmas dinner, though I cooked the prime rib in the more traditional way (20 mins at high temp then 325 for a couple of hours). The Madeira sauce was wonderful, a huge hit with my foodie relatives. I can't quite believe I'm saying this, as someone who puts a lot of sauce on things, but it made far too much sauce than needed. We had seven adults taking second and even third helpings of the sauce, dipping every morsel of bread in it, and we still had twice as much as anyone could eat. Next time I will cut it in half. Marvelous!

Served last night at Thanksgiving along with the turkey- It turned out to be a hit! It was delicious and tender. Although I had to modify the cooking temperature for the 7 pound boneless prime ribeye: Roasted 450 for 20 min, then 335 for 40 then 350 for 30 min. I did not have the appropriate thermometer that went lower than 140 so guestimated, but with the temperature modification, it turned out perfect- medium rare. I figured that if it were slightly undercooked, I could have sliced the meat up and baked a little longer rather than overdry the meat. I pierced garlic cloves into the meat before roasting and also covered the roast during the middle segment to prevent overburning and drying it out. Maybe I could add more salt to either the meat or the madeira sauce next time. I think I could have also chopped up herbs such as thyme and/or rosemary to the meat before cooking too. The horseradish sauce was great by reducing the creme fraiche and increasing the strained horseradish. The madeira sauce was good, though maybe more salt next time? I did this earlier in the day which saved me tons of time (glad I did!). I could only give this a 3 since the cooking time was really not accurate so there was too much guess work.

I made a 9 lb roast for Christmas dinner this year, my 1st attempt at a roast other than a pork loin. I bought a Poder digital probe thermometer especially for this recipe. I took the roast out when it hit 125 degrees thinking it would be medium rare. Boy was I waaaay off. The roast continued to cook to 140 degrees while resting, big newbie mistake on my part. Next year I will take the roast out at 110 degrees. The Madiera wine sauce saved the day though. Silky and delicious! I've made this same sauce for pork loin roast and used the leftover sauce to add to my homemade beef stew along with the usual red wine and beef broth. It added an incredible depth of flavor to my stew. The Horseradish sauce was just OK, but admittedly I used Sour Cream since my local market doesn't carry Creme Fraiche. I will try it again but will make sure to have creme fraiche and probably halve the recipe because it makes so much.

I made this for my French husband and our two daughters for Christmas dinner this year. My husband was hoarding the gravy boat because he loved the madeira sauce so much! I cooked all the dishes included in this traditional "English Christmas Dinner" menu. Every member of the family had extra helpings and I will make this meal part of our Christmas tradition from now on. I am so appreciative to Epicurious for helping to make our Christmas meal so special.

Made this for 16 people on New Years Eve. It was perfection. Madeira sauce was silky and rich; I did use a little extra butter and flour as suggested by another commenter to make almost a demi-glace. Horseradish sauce was everyone's favorite. Used creme fraiche, based on other suggestions, and they were right. Much nicer than sour cream for this recipe. The trick was to squeeze-dry the horseradish in some cheesecloth before mixing. No watery sauce as some other reviewers complained of. Thanks to Epicurious and thanks to the many thoughtful and concise commenters who prepared this before me. I learned from all of you, and when you're spending this much on a show-stopper meal, it's worth paying close attention to the details.

I've made this for Christmas Eve for about four years now, and it is always a hit--my mother won't let me make anything else. The preparation couldn't be simpler and the meat comes out very tender and tasty. Don't skip the onions, they make a marvelous accompaniment to the meat. This year I also used the leftover Madeira sauce as a base for the soup I made out of the rib bones.

First, I'll say that this was my first time cooking Prime Rib. The cut was a lot fattier than I had expected and I wasn't sure if I was suppose to serve the fatty parts, which was about 3/4 of the roast. After slicing and plating the meat, be sure to season with salt and pepper. The two sauces are lovely. I doubled the butter and flour in the wine sauce which resulted in a very thick demi glace-like sauce that was great. Toss the onions with some olive oil, salt and pepper or they will brown on the edges and be dry. If I did this again, I would add red potatoes to the onions, and some carrots too for a complete meal.

The beef was easy and perfect! Ok, I changed things.. with the Medeira Sauce... Added about 1lb of sliced mushrooms and 3 green onions cooked in about a tspn of butter then added broth, the wine about 1/2 cup sherry and 1 cup+ tawney port (I thought I had Madeira BUT I when I went to get it OOPPS didn't have any!So, this really turned out to be a Tawney Port sauce). Then Added celery 3 stalks (didn't have fresh parsely) Fresh rosemary 3 sprigs, fresh greek oregano 4 sprigs, big pinch dry thyme. Boiled this down about 30mins and held on stove until beef came out removed herbs/stalks, then added 2 TB flour shaken with about 1/4 cup water to mix and brought to boil again. Make ahead and let herbs "steep" in broth awesome!!!!!

My wife and I don't normally do well in the kitchen together (I do the cooking), she took over on this dish along with the Yorkshire Pudding (Great - don't worry if you do not get enough fat just use drippings), horseradish sauce (not so special),brussel sprouts with shallots and mustard seeds (not a lover of brussel sprouts and I enjoyed), our own Gorganzola mashed potatoes, and the Country Apple Tart with spiced brown butter (crust and all delicious). It was easy for her to work with me and the meal was delicious. I think she wants to "Mutiny" now and take over the kitchen. 125 degree internal and 30 minutes tented = rare to medium rare (temperature climbs during rest so don't worry about the 140 rule).

Perfect roast. Mine was only a 5lber. It took about 1 hr 15 min. I didn't have Madeira so I used a very good dry sherry. The sauce was fabulous. I also used less sour cream for the horseradish sauce so it stayed hot. Lovely. Everything was easy and worth the shopping.

First Prime Rib recipe ever, and this was a winner! I had a number of well done meat eaters so I left the roast in until the thermometer reached 130 (believe me I was nervous I was going to ruin it!) and it still ended up being the perfect range of medium rare on the inside and medium well on the outside. Definitely take the time to reduce down the Madeira Sauce, I went for a good ten minutes longer... and I still would have liked it to be thicker.. if you are looking for an au jus, stay as is, but as a sauce, I would add a bit more of the butter/flour mixture and increase the reducing time.

Although the Prime Rib came out wonderful, as well as the horseradish sauce, I had difficulty with the Maderia Sauce. I must not have reduced it enough, and/or used a lousy bottle of red wine, as the sauce was way too vinagary. Also, in my opinion the sauce was too thin. Personally, I would double up on the flour/butter mixture, to make a creamier sauce. Again, this could be due to my not taking enough time to reduce it, although I certainly did boil it off for over the 28 minutes advised on the recipe. However I quadripled the sauce, as I own a restaurant. Next time, I will allot myself more time for this sauce. Other then that. The Horseradish Sauce was perfect, and the Prime Rib itself was perfect (though I did, turn off the oven to let it stand after it reached 115 degrees). *Leftovers, make awesome sandwiches! Open faced is best. IMO Dee N. A Chef & Restaurant owner in San Diego County

I made this dish for the first Christmas I hosted. I selected it because I figured the quality of the meat could carry the day on its own, even if it turned out I wasn't so good at hosting the holidays. It was very easy, and the taste was excellent! The herbed Yorkshire puddings were a big hit. The horseradish sauce was a bit mild for some, but perfect for me (I like a bit of flavor with no heat). Next time, I will serve full strength horseradish in addition to the sauce. I will definitely make it again - and much sooner than next Christmas.

This will be my annual Christmas recipe. I was a little intimidated -- an expensive cut of meat, a husband telling me not to make it too rare. It turned out perfect!! I did leave it to sit a little longer than 30 minutes, and returned it to the warm oven for a bit while my potatoes finished on the stove. So it was probably a little more done than some would prefer, but for us, perfect. Flawless! The horseradish sauce recipe makes a lot of sauce -- that could be scaled down. Everyone raved!

This Prime Rib is one of the best I've ever had! The onions were so sweet when done, they were like molasses. Fantastic. The Madeira sauce tasted like it was from made by Wolfgang himself! The Yorkshire Puddings were delicious as well, although it only made 12, not 16. Also, the meat was medium rare at 120 degrees, it could even go a little less and it would be perfect. Next time! I definately recommend this recipe.

This meal was delicious. However, it wasnt that much better than simpler, less expensive to make recipes for a rib roast ("prime" is just a brand name). The Madeira sauce was bit sweet and cloying. I felt a simple red wine sauce would have been fine, particularly since Madeira is kind of expensive (i spent about $18 for a 500ml bottle - i'll have to find something else to make with it). The horseradish cream was too thin - an old standby recipe from Joy of Cooking was better. The roast came out perfect according to the directions here: 120 on my probe-type thermometer was pink and juicy with a nice crust. I woudn't make this again. There are better, simpler roast recipes out there.

I gave this recipe to Mom as she wanted one for Xmas Day dinner. She's not one for following instructions closely but I ended up making the Madiera Sauce and followed that to the letter.

My back is still tingling from all the backslaps I got with this one on New Years Eve! Meat thermometer is a must...I took out my 11 pound prime rib when it registered 120 and let it rest, covered, for half an hour. The Madeira and horseradish sauces were incredible. I replaced half the beef stock in the Madeira sauce with prepared demi glace. Started with Butternut Squash soup with apple cider cream, served with mashed potato/celeriac with mascarpone (all recipes from this site). People were practically licking their plates.

I made this dish for a Christmas dinner party and it was an absolute hit! I halved the horseradish sauce as recommended and it still made more than enough (next time I won't even make it). The Madeira sauce was fabulous! One change I did make was I encrusted the roast with the herbs and garlic before roasting and let it set. This gave the meat an amazing flavor which was mirrored by the Madeira wine sauce in a most complementary fashion! Also, I roasted the onions seperately with shallots and garlic.

Perfect! Following readers' advice we used the 110 degrees guage. The Madeira sauce is exquisite. I halved the horseradish sauce and it was more than enough for the ten at our table. Truthfully, I did not think it was any better than simple sour cream with lots of added horseradish. But this prime rib recipe and madeira is four star restaurant good. p.s. I did not use onions but added them to root vegetables.

12/02: Served this for our Christmas dinner. Bought the meat at Costco. Excellent! A keeper. Will do this again and again....very easy. 12/03: UPDATE! Although the Prime Rib was fabulous last year, I decided to try the Herb and Garlic-Crusted Beef Tenderloin with Red and Yellow Pepper Relish (an Epicurious recipe). The Tenderloin was excellent, although I'm not sure it was worth all the $$$. Because everyone raved about the Madeira sauce last year, I decided to make the Red and Yellow Pepper Relish in the recipe AND also this Madeira sauce. The relish was very good but not worthy as an accompaniement to the elegant Tenderloin. Everyone again raved about this sauce. It's definitely a keeper!

I have to go against the grain on this one. I did not like the madeira wine sauce. I felt it was had an unpleasantly sweet taste that was a bit too strong. I liked the horseradish sauce and found it simple and refreshing. The yorkeshire puddings were great and not as much trouble as some have experienced. The star of this dish is the beef, so cook it perfectly. I took it out as recommended at 115 and it was great. I also cooked the twice baked roquefort potatoes and got raves from my guests.

A 5-star meal! Everyone loved it, and the horseradish sauce was an unexptected hit. The madiera sauce was also incredible, and so easy to make that it was hard to decide which to pour on the beef. I completely forgot to buy thyme and rosemary, and still the sauce was superb. If you want to wow your guests, but not break a sweat while in the kitchen, this is the meal to make.

Excellent, satisfying dinner! I haven't made a roast prime rib for about 40 yrs!! So, it was not without some stress when I decided to take the leap again for special guests. I purchased an 8.5 lb extremely good quality beef (Chairman's Choice which is up near Angus). I fed 5 with about 2 portions left over. The morning of the day of my dinner, I discovered my meat thermometers (3 of them) were all of the type that started out at 140 degrees (called temp called rare). It was panic city, big time because I recalled the other reviewers who suggested using a thermometer that can read as low as 115 degrees! I drove madly to JC Penney a couple hours prior to roasting the meat and purchased a Redi-Chek Roast Alert/3 Electronic Timer/Thermometer (19.99). What a neat and life saving (beef saving) gizmo!!! It saved my roast's day! I programmed it to beep me when the meat was at 115. We took it out of the oven at 118, let it rest for 30 min. It was pink and juicy to perfection. I'm guessing the time was around 2 hours. I probably could have trusted 115. The Madeira sauce was very good, the horseradish sauce also a good accompaniment - a little loose in consistency, but guests liked the flavor. Make it a day or two beforehand to let flavors marry. I made garlic mashed potatoes, steamed fresh green beans, had a fresh spring salad mix with a few dried cranberries, mandarin orange slices and chopped walnuts mixed in - passed the gorgonzola to top. It doesn't require much fuss. My stress was uncalled for. The beef takes center stage and the electronic thermometer takes all the guess work away. For goodness sakes --- don't over cook it. Stick with 115 and get it OUT of the oven!! Pour a good red wine and you're in like Flynn!

Interesting slant to a typical English Christmas dinner. Coming from the UK, poultry is a little lighter than Beef before the traditional steamed Christmas pudding, this certainly would make a wonderful dish for New Years Eve dinner or a slant on Thanksgiving as we did. We put the final touches in the Weber barbeque with Hickory wood, and that really sent it to heaven.

I own a catering business, and this recipe is one of my favorites. In reading the reviews I noticed that one cook had trouble locating Madeira in grocery stores. Because of the higher-than-wine alcohol content, Madeira is not generally sold in grocery stores - it's available wherever you find liquors. I made the same mistake!

Just made this for Mother's Day. What a treat. Used a 5lb roast,adjusted the cooking time and it was sensational. Did play a little with the Horseradish Cream. Needed more punch, perhaps the brand of horseradish I used wasn't very potent. Used only creme fraiche...next time will use a combo of creme fraiche and sour cream for a thicker consistency. The Madeira Sauce was perfect, just added a little sauce in the final stage. Great meal!!

When it was close to serving time, I strained the marinade and reduced it by half, as the recipe calls for. Meanwhile, I grilled the tenderloins outside. The horseradish sauce was wonderful, too! I had made it the night before, adding a tbsp of fresh horseradish for an extra zip. I am definitely making this again... tonight!

My husband and I made this dish for a holiday dinner party. It was excellent. The recipe makes an enormous amount of horseradish sauce, but both it and the Madeira gravy went over very well. We received lots of oohs and aahs and it didn't keep either of us in the kitchen for long. I would invest in a digital meat thermometer - we realized too late that our old meat thermometer doesn't register low temperatures such as 115. We also made the Yorkshire puddings and they were a big hit as well.

Fabulous sauce. I made the Roast Prime Rib Au Poivre (this website) which had a great crust and then did the sauce from this recipe. Wonderful combination. My 13 guests raved. I served it with Mashed Potatoes with Celery Root & Mascarpone also on this site. We did the roasting on convection and had to turn off the convection because the 17# roast was getting done too fast. In total it took about 2 1/2 hours. I also made the horseradish sauce which was good but on the runny side. I'm sure there are other horseradish sauce recipe that are better. Next time I'm going to try the onions.

I chopped extra herbs from the yorkshire pudding recipe and added it to lots of minced garlic as a rub for the roast. The remark about the onions is true - too burnt to eat so next time I would add them later. I didn't experience any problems with the Madiera sauce. Most of my guests liked the yorkshire pudding but neither my husband nor I were very impressed. I would definitely make the Madeira sauce again for prime rib or filet mignon - very easy and delicious.

This recipe was so-so. Prime rib roast is fairly easy to make, so roasting it with just onions was simple and delicious. I went to two grocery stores looking for madeira wine, but no luck. I had to settle for burgundy cooking wine, not impressive. I have had madeira before and it does have a distinct taste that is difficult to substitute. I also found that adding the drippings to the wine sauce made it rather oily. The horseradish sauce however, was wonderful and everyone was raving. Fresh chives are a nice touch.

Our Christmas dinner guests raved about this prime rib and the sauces and the yorkshire puddings. I didn't have any "drippings" to add to the Madeira Sauce but it was excellent on it's own. Only change that I think I would make is to wait towards the end of roasting to add the onion because they were too burned to be edible.

This one made me the 'king' this Christmas. If you've never made a Madeira sauce, you *HAVE* to try this tonight. Simply FANTASTIC.

I made this last Christmas and from now on it will be our family's standard X-Mas or special occasion main course. It is the best. I substituted wine/broth for the madeira sauce, as I did not or could not locate the maderia sauce.

I made this dinner for a group of 15 people, men and women. They rated it as the best they had ever had. I will definitely make again.

Wonderful recipe. Made it the day after Thanksgiving 2001 and it turned out perfect!! Very flavorful. The Yorkshire Puddings also added to the flavor of the prime rib. A good side dish that was also in the Dec 2001 of BonAppetit was the mushroom orzo. Went well with this. I'm making it again this year in a few weeks!

Having never purchased or made prime rib before this was a scarry thing for me making it for Christmas Dinner. With help I picked out a good piece of meat and then started to prepare this dish. It came out wonderful. Everyone raved about it. I also made the popovers that were in the book with the recipe. They came out great too. I plan on making it again for this Christmas. Enjoy!!

The Madeira sauce was the big hit at my dinner party. Also would recommend taking the meat out at 110 degrees -- 30 minutes more out of the oven under tin foil creates a perfect med-rare. The horseradish sauce tasted even better the second day. A big winner.

This was my first attempt at Prime Rib. Instead of searing in the oven at 450', I seared the bone-in roast in a cast iron pan on the stove, searing all sides and ends. Then I transferred to a 350' oven (actual thermometer temperature ~ 330'). I place a meat thermometer into the roast before putting into the oven. The oven was set on convection, so I covered the roast with foil during cooking. The meat was registering 140'F within 2 hours, and when cut after resting for 30-40 mins after removal from the oven, the meat was cooked to perfection! I think that it would have been under cooked if removed at 125'F. Anyways, lots and lots of juices inside the meat, but none in the pan! Howver, I really didn't like the gravy, but that could be because I substituted marsala for madeira. Would definately cook the prime rib again.

This was the best prime rib / sauce recipe I ever made. I added portobella mushrooms to the sauce, and my guests loved it and requested the recipe.

UNBELIEVABLE!!! We make a prime rib every year for Christmas dinner, have been all my life. My husband and I love to cook, so this tradition got handed to us since we got married. I could not believe the flavors of this roast. So rich and beautiful. Searing the meat in the oven was the perfect thing to do. The sauces are wonderful, and even I enjoyed the leftovers, which I am never a big fan of. This is a must try and a make-again!!!

I halved this recipe and it was just great. I will leave off the onions the next time. They seemed to just mealt away.

This was spectacular! Even my honey, the world's pickiest eater, adored the madeira sauce. In fact, he asks that we make this dish at least once/month now.

I made the Madeira sauce and served it with beef tenderloin. The sauce was okay, but too sweet for my taste. I wouldn't make this sauce again.

This was the most impressive thing I've ever made! The sauces were great and the meat turned out perfect - it was a big hit at Christmas.

Great recipe. Unique and delicious. The horseradish sauce wasn't great, but no one was interested anyway. The Madeira sauce was brilliant. Make this with your favourite popover or Yorkshire pud. Watch the meat temperature.

DELICIOUS!!! A simple and elegant dish.

We made this recipe inclusive of the horseradish and yorkshire pudding for New Years. It was "THE BEST!" The Madeira sauce was outstanding and the yorkshire pudding was simple to make and very impressive. The horseradish sauce was on the thin side and not potent enough for our taste. I would only add a teaspoon of lemon to the sauce and add more horseradish. Next special occassion, definately make this recipe!!!

I made this for Christmas Eve and it was amazing. The Horseradish sauce was a hit too. The prime rib was perfectly seasoned and the Madeira Sauce was to die for! I especially loved that I could make the majority of the sauce ahead of time and then added the pan juices a few minutes before straining, thickening and serving it. Excellent!

My friend and I made this dinner on New Years Eve for 13 people. Everyone loved it. We made the Smoked Duck (we used smoked turkey) Salad, Prime Rib with Madeira sauce and Horseradish sauce, Herbed Yorkshire Puddings and steamed some green beans. We roasted 2 smaller prime ribs because our friends like the "end cut". They were seasoned one day ahead with garlic pepper and Johnny's seasoning salt, then we followed the recipe. I know we will make the Madeira Sauce and the Horseradish Sauce again and again. We only roasted 4 onions with the prime rib because we thought they were mainly to flavor the sauce. Next time we will roast even more than the 6 the recipe called for. They were so good that people were eating them straight out of the roasting pan. We had almost none left to serve at the table!

I too made the whole dinner (with yorkshire puddings and horseradish sauce) and I can't stress enough how much of a hit it was for our Christmas dinner. The madeira sauce was a success and it went well on top of rice, too! The meat turned out perfect, but I took it out of the oven when it registered 120 degrees, just to be on the safe side. EXCELLENT!!!!!

The sauce is wonderful on other meats. My rating is only for the sauce. I used corn starch to thicken to desired consistency.

The herbs and the sauces are wonderful, but cooking to 125 degrees results in meat that is considerably more like medium well than medium rare. I put the probe of my digital thermometer in the center of the roast and set it for 115. Even so, by the time I got the roast out of the oven after the alarm went off, the temperature had climbed to 118. Out of the oven, the temperature rose still more, to 128, before stabilizing as the meat rested. When it was carved, there were a few pinkish slices in the middle, but the rest was brown. (As I write this, I am trying to figure out what to do with the brown leftovers that are languishing in the refridgerator.) I shudder to think what would have happened had I left it in the oven until it was 125 degrees.

Made the whole English Menu for Christmas, and, although the meat, rolled prime rib roast, was tasty, the real hit was the Madeira sauce, which was a lot like Bordelaise. Tried to make half the horseradish sauce, but, alas, no takers of the 17 people eating. Threw the roasted onions in with the roasted root vegetables, which were gobbled up. The Herbed Yorkshire Puddings were a first for us and we just didn't see how it would or could work, but, lo and behold, it did; and they were well liked. Will probably make it again for one of several reasons. Probably the rib roast for a smaller group; if for no other reason than to couple it with the delicious smoked duck breast salad.

I used a filet of beef for this one. The Madeira sauce was pretty good. I left out the flour and butter and added the drippings after carving the meat. The horseradish sauce was delicious! This was a relatively simple recipe that yielded favorable results.

I modified the recipe a little. I used the herb paste from December 2000- Roast New York Strip Loin with Garlic-Herb Crust which consist of garlic, fresh sage, thyme, olive oil, salt and pepper and rubbed that on the meat the day before and followed the recipe. The meat was wonderful. My guest loved it and the Madeira Sauce was delicious! This is a keeper.

I substituted Chianti for the mixture of Madiera and a dry red, and it was fabulous. I reduced the leftover sauce to a pasty consistency, and spread it like butter on warm french bread. Everyone enjoyed it thoroughly.

This was tasty and relatively simple....I mistakenly substituted port for the madiera and think the result was a bit bland..the horseradish sauce was great.
