Great breading pudding although the second time I made it, I cut the salt in the caramel sauce by half. It was still salty, but not overpowering.

This was a huge hit. Honestly, so quick to put together- the cream of tarter tip was a revelation! Make this, and serve with vanilla ice cream. I am not a great baker, just a good cook, and this came out perfectly.

I don't think I am a dam food chef who make it almost like this.
