Very easy recipe and a big hit. Liked the creamy tartness. Cooked this in a clay double boiler of sorts, ran it through my ice cream maker for about 15 mins in addition to what the recipe called for and then froze it in an ice cream freezer and it worked very well. Will definitely make again.

The recipe is very simple to make and very good, but I agree with everyone else that it is not fruity enough. To make it fruitier I put in 2 bags of the Goya passion fruit pulp and increased the sugar by 1/2 cup to balance the tartness of the pulp.

Great! I wanted a more intense fruit flavor so i added extra nectar and it turned out perfectly. I served it with coconut cupcakes and they were a perfect match.

I love passion fruit, so I expected to love this. It was pretty good, but I wanted a less creamy, more intense fruit flavor. I might try and make passion fruit sorbet instead. For those living in Texas looking for passion fruit puree, I found in the frozen food section of the Fiesta grocery store (I know they have Fiestas in Houston and Dallas)

Loved this, but I love passion fruit, so it was almost a given. A few notes: first, I cut the fat a little by using about a 2/1 cream/milk ratio instead of straight cream; second, the Goya brand frozen puree has more slightly more than called for here, so I just used it all and upped the milk and cream a little. Turned out great--I served with the tuiles listed here.

I didn't have the time to find the passion fruit pulp/puree - so I bought passion fruit juice and reduced 3 cups to the amount needed. It was delicious and my guests raved about it - served it with a scoop of blackberry sorbet & raspberry puree.....yum
