Fantastic summer weeknight dish. Even with a large skillet I had to cook the squash in 2 batches. In addition to the thyme I used Penzey's Mural of Flavors spice mix and finished the veggies with a pat of fresh butter before plating.

We really liked this. It's like what you'd get at a nice restaurant. Could not find spring onions so used scallions which was fine but think the spring onions would have been better since they are bigger. Would definitely make again. I served this with cornbread.

Great flavors and ingredient combinations. Next time I should cut the bubs even smaller, perhaps into eighths, and more thoroughly carmelize them. Perfect timing for the fish, though it was a bit too fishy for the dish. Maybe cod next time?

Four forks are given to the vegetables. Prepared as directed and served with Cedar Plank Grilled Cooper River Salmon. Wonderfully light and fresh. Easy midweek meal but worthy of guests. A must try

This was excellent. Be generous with the thyme -- the combination is delightful. I also added some fresh peas, but it would have been just as nice without.
