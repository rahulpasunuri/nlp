Two words for you: Add thyme. Whole thyme leaves, baked in the parchment, on top of the fish. And of course, use mushroom broth.

This recipe sounded so fabulous, but was disappointing. I skipped the clam juice because it sounded yucky and used water with fresh herbs and shallots instead. The morels didn't have much taste when they were done, and the broth was pretty flavorless too. The fish was good, but it just tasted like itself. If I were doing this again I would soak the mushrooms in mushroom broth and maybe some red wine. Also, I would probably cheat and add some butter at the end! This recipe definitely needs something.

First of all, the clam juice adds entirely the wrong element to the dish. While up to most challenges, sea bass requires subtle flavor introduction, not the lumbering crassness of bottled clam. A fish fumet or even a lighter mushroom stock might be more appropriate. Second, the instructions in the method portion might benefit from a bit more clarity, particularly with regards to reduction; while it may be somewhat esoteric to call for "reduction au sec," to instruct one to "reduce by half/third/etc..." might prove more enlightening for those without fractional-cup gradations in their saucepans. Finally, a distinction (or caveat) might be added between the uses of dehydrated versus fresh morels, and a conversion for those fortunate enough to find the fresh at their grocer.
