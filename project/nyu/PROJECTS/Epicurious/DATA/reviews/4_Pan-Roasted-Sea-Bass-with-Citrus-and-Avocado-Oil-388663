This is a very good fish recipe. Easy to do, the flavor is there and it's healthy!

Warning to iPad users, there are dashes missing. Obviously cooking this for 45 then 35 minutes would involve the fire dept. 4 to 5 then 3 to 5. Haven't made it yet. Sounds yummy.

Citrus is always refreshing!

I made this and we LOVED it. I used Sea Bass and the cooking method was simple and perfect. The fish looked beautiful and tasted fresh and excellent. The citrus and avocado were the perfect fresh accompaniments, tart and creamy. I served asparagus risotto with the fish and that worked well. I'm making this for company this week and plan on serving pea risotto or mushy peas, haven't decided yet.

So Simple, so delicious. I used fresh Cod from Cape Cod. It is now our go-to quick and delicous fish recipe. Trying it with Alaskan Halibut tonight!

I love cooking so much and as I take a peek on this Gourmandia site, I found out that there are more than recipes in there... It offers a lot from broad collection of recipes to cooking skills and napkin folding. Thanks for having this. You must try to take a tour on this site! A package site!

This is super tasty! Quick, simple, lovely, elegant. It was ready in the time it took to cook the fish which makes it a perfect meal for weeknights! Pretty enough to serve to guests without much hassle or time spent in the kitchen.

Made this last night for a quick mid week meal. Easy and flavorful. Would definitely make again.

This recipe was simple and a hit. The grape seed oil was light & complemented the fish nicely (fish monger only had cod, so i used that). I made 8 servings. My trick was using a nonstick pan (instead of a heavy skillet as suggested), searing the one side and then loading all onto a ceramic baking sheet to finish in the oven. They all came out in one piece for the first time in my life. The citrus/avocado accompaniment was easy and delicious.

The use of orange and grapefruit with the creaminess of the avocado was a nice change from lemons. Clean, flavorful, and a nice balance of acid to avocado richness. I didn't use the avocado oil. I don't want to have an entire cabinet dedicated to oils! Too many already. The citrus juices with salt and pepper was yummy. Simple and fast. I'll do this again with other fish as well.
