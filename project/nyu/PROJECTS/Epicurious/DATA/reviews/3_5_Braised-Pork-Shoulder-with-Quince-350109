Great taste! I couldn't find quinces (made this in March), so I subbed dried apricots. The flavor was great, but the apricots turned to mush by the end of cooking. Next time I would add them in the last hour of cooking. I also might try subbing some unripe pears. I used beef broth instead of chicken and my dish did have the dark color like the picture. Served with toasted couscous.

I thought this was excellent. Made it exactly as written, using 100% pure pomegranate juice. Served over polenta with plenty of chopped mint. I thought the pairing of pork & quince was inspired and the flavors deep and complex. I agree with previous reviewers that it doesn't look anything like the picture. Much paler in color.

i love to cook, and have no problem spending a great deal of time on a dish, just like the reviewer before me. but i have to completely agree w everything she said. it was just ok. i made it for a dinner party, and it looked NOTHING like the picture. not worth my time. i will also agree though that it had great potential, and the spice rub is something i will most definitely use again.

I should preface my review by saying that I absolutely love cooking, and I don't mind spending large amounts of time making something special. Unfortunately, this one just did not deliver. The end result was not worth the amount of time it required. Yes, it was good, but simply not worth it. Don't be tempted by the luscious-looking picture in the mag - it won't even come close to resembling that!

I'm not sure there is an appropriate number of forks to give for my experience. This recipe had a lot of potential. Things started off well. The rub was tasty, the pork was very tender and flavorful. Things took a turn south when I took the pork out on the third day to slice and reheat. I was going to use the foil that I had used in the oven and the refrigerator to cover the meat for reheating. To my horror, I noticed that the places where the foil had been in contact with the meat, it had been eaten away! I know you're supposed to be careful with tomatoes and foil, but I didn't think meat with a spice rub was a problem. I wrap my spice rubbed baby back ribs in foil all the time. Could it have been the fruit or pomegranate juice? I'm a little paranoid about serving bad food, so I'm about to throw out the whole roast. The idea of melted bits of foil in my food does not appeal to me. Aside from that, the other very minor negative is that my version did not turn out looking as deep and rich in color as the photograph. It was more of a "pot roast light brown". If anyone can shed some light on my foil issue, I'd appreciate it!

Oh my, this was good. I made this for my own rehearsal dinner as I knew I could do the bulk of the work several days in advance. Came out beautifully to many ohs and ahs. The flavors of the spices with the pomegranate juice and the quince were sublime. One thing I found though was I wasn't left with much sauce before cutting and reheating. I added some home-made chicken stock and just didn't cook it down too much and it came out beautifully. Use real pomegranate juice (there are many kinds out there with mostly grape or apple juice in them- would be too sweet). I served this with the minted saffron rice recipe from this site and Ina Garten's (the barefoot contessa) apple crisp for dessert- heavenly!
