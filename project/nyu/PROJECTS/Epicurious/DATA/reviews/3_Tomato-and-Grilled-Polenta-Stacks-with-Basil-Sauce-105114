This recipe read out very well but the actual result wasn't very satisfactory...the basil sauce was very bitter and overpowering. I tried doctoring it up to save it from the compost...added parmesan but it wasn't enough to take the bite away...ended up adding plain yoghurt to tame it but it is still not very appetizing. I'd look for another sauce.

I used the polenta in a tube and sliced it about 1/2 inch thick. Grilled in a pan with olive oil until crispy. Chopped and Sauted the asparagus with fresh garlic and olive oil until it was partially cooked. Used grape tomatoes sliced. Have used Smoked Fontina as well as Smoked Mozzarella - both were great. I have added sliced avoacado on top of the cooked stacks. When ever I serve this people go crazy for it. I personally think it is the sauce that makes it.

This was delicious. My boyfriend and I served this as our "main" with a soup. I used the pre-made polenta and don't have a grill so just broiled it in the oven. The sauce was great since I have an abundance of basil and it was very quick to make in a Magic Bullet.

this was good, and i enjoyed eating it, but it was so ridiculously complicated for something so small. next time, i will definitely (as was suggested below and i was too foolish to listen) by the slicable polenta rather than make it from scratch, and i will try sauteeing the polenta rather than grilling it. also, i agree with previous reviewers that the amounts are too tiny to count as a real appetizer, and should either be pre-appetizers or the recipe should be increased.

Forgot to add that I just cut the polenta in squares and I used regular mozzarella.

I added savory, marjoram, and black pepper to the polenta. I have made it twice and will definitely be making it again.

Great recipe. I used it for hor's d'oevres without stacking the polenta. I'm always looking for ways to make something easier so I made a bruschetta with diced tomatoes, fresh basil, garlic and lemon juice. I used premade polenta from my deli section and grilled it ahead of time. To serve I spooned bruschetta on each polenta slice, covered with shredded cheese, and heated in the oven. A real crowd pleaser.

This has the potential to be really wonderful with a few alterations: double or triple the recipe and use instant polenta. The portions are so tiny--this was a low-fat recipe and I think the portions were small to keep the numbers low. I was embarassed to serve it to guests--it was more an amuse bouche than an appetizer. Also, the pesto sauce was so scant that I couldn't get it to blend in my food processor. Argh!

My boyfriend loved this dish, I just thought it was so-so. It's fairly easy to make, though, especially if you use pre-made polenta, and the presentation is very nice. Make sure the polenta is grilled enough, though!

just too complicated for me or something. may be it was a bad day in the kitchen with kids.

Tasty, but rediculous steps for what is a very classic, simple dish (basil and tomato on polenta). The stacking was just a silly step and not needed..

My guests loved this and all wanted the recipe. It was really easy, - I used ready-made sundried tomato/garlic polenta. The smoked mozz. is great and you don't need a lot. I didn't do stacks, just layered a polenta round, tomato, cheese and fresh basil leaf. Tip: the basil sauce tastes too strong and bitter on its own. I added oil, but I think even w/out it, it would have tasted good with the polenta - so don't worry.

This recipe was fantastic and very easy! I used the pre-made polenta rather than starting from scratch, which definitely saved time. The smoked mozzerella is a must and the basil sauce can be drizzled around the edge of the plate to create a wonderful colorful presentation.

Very tasty and very nice presentation. Some changes I made and would make in future: I did not stack them and liked this; make sure to get the polenta crispy on the grill and make sure tomatoes are drained--I may slice tomatoes thinner so that the polenta does not get soggy and tomatoes don't overpower the polenta. The smoked mozzarella is a definite and the sauce compliments it all well. I made with salmon but some tasty sausage might be a better accompaniment.
