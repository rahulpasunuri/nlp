This is a wonderful appetizer for a cocktail party. It is a real crowd pleaser - easy and "fun" to eat and delicious.

Quite disappointed with the result. I marinated lamb overnight (maybe that was my mistake?), but that lovely tangy pomegranate flavour didn't come through.

You can't go wrong with this recipe! Make this for lamb haters and they'll be converts. The lamb comes out perfectly every time. I have the butcher cut up a lamb shoulder. I don't change anything, except I have substituted lamb for chicken when lamb seems too heavy--it's still delicious. We make tzatziki, cucumber feta & tomato salad and tabbouleh on the side and love to serve with pita and stuff everything into the pockets.

Terrific flavors. It is easy to make your own pomegranate molasses using fresh pomegranate juice-here's a link to one recipe http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/pomegranate-syrup-or-molasses-recipe/index.html

Wow! So glad I finally found pom- molasses! Asked butcher to de-bone small leg of lamb. At home, I sliced in the thickest part to "open it up"/resemble a flat tri-tip type cut. This provided opportunities for well and rare portions if carefully grilled. Marinated for about 6 hours. Need to watch on grill for flame-ups. Marinate has too much oil to baste (adjust next time by making a small marinate sub- smaple with less oil and reduced with some red wine as a final sauce). Was ready to finish in the oven if it flamed too much, but it cooked exactly like a tri-tip on the grill. Flavors were amazing and grilling eliminated the "fattiness" that my hubbie doesn't like with roasted leg of lamb. Served with roasted red potatoes with rosemary and garlic and honey roasted carrots.

Meat was tasty, recipe was quick (save for the marinating).

The marinade is truly delicious! Instead of making hors d'oeuvre size skewers I made main-dish kebabs, alternating lamb and bell pepper. It's easy and unfussy (especially if you use ground cumin instead of grinding your own), and tastes great. Served with lavash and roasted garbanzo beans with chard and garlic (also from this site) for a Mediterranean style dinner

I've made this dish a couple of times now for parties and it's always been a big hit! Most recently, I made it for my daughter's sweet sixteen and her normally fickle friends lapped it up. Whole Foods carries Pomegranate Molasses, in the aisle by the honey and other syrups.

Personally I detest lamb but I have made this several times and it is always a hit--am making it again tomorrow. Everyone else will love it. It's a sophisticated snap, excellent for a cocktail party.

This dish is phenom!!!! I have cooked lamb one other time in my life and the meat came out so tenderly flavorful. I used cumin powder instead of the seeds. Used 5 cloves instead of 3 but I also had 1.25lbs of lamb too. Definitely must use the pom molasses! My man doesn't even like lamb, said it was the best meal I've ever made. Oh, also made a garbanzo bean mash and agugula lemon salad with the meal.

Please take the time to find or make the pomegranate molassas! It's very simple and makes this dish really spectacular. A recipe can be found on many websites. Doubled the marinade and used a whole boneless leg of lamb that was butterflied to about 1 1/2" thick. Grilled for about 15 min per side to med. and was just amazing. Will definately make again.

the BEST lamb marinade ever. I use it for chops before grilling

Substituted pork tenderloin for the lamb. It was a big hit at the party. Great flavor.

Boring--tastes like sweet oil. Would not make again. (I used the 1/3 honey 1/3 molasses 1/3 orange marmelade mixture, btw.)

This was a good use for the pom molasses I bought for another recipe. I marinaded lamb chops for an hour. The sauce made a nice sugary glaze that browned nicely on the grill. Next time, I'll try marinading longer for more flavor.

Looked all over and couldn't find the pomegranate mollasses. I read the reviews of others who used a variety of alternatives and decided to split the difference. Using what I had in the house, I substituted 1/3 molasses, 1/3 honey and 1/3 orange marmelade. The predominant flavor was of the cumin, which I like. I thought it was tasty, but not extraordinary. Very easy.

That was the best non-homemade (except that I homemade it, but hopefully you get the gist) lamb i've ever had. everyone was thrilled and i've been jonesing for it ever since. I think I'll make it again tomorrow! PLUS: EASY! Mmmmmm...

I grilled lamb steak instead and turned out great. This sause is amazing and well worth the search for pomegranate molasses. We sereved this with the garlic zucchini and lime corne also found on epicurious

Delicious---and easy. I made the lamb cubes slightly different sizes so the larger ones were rarer and the smaller ones were more well done. That way cocktail party guests could have their preference.

This was great - very unusual. Could not find pomegranate molasses, so I used apricot jam and the result was wonderful.

I had a very hard time finding pomegranate molasses so I substituted apricot marmelade. The grill also gave out and I had to do it in the oven (at 450). Still, it was fabulkus!

This was fantastic! It smelled good even before i broiled them. couldn't find pomegranate molasses, so crushed pomegranate seeds into honey and it worked beautifully.

Wonderful! Guests raved. I got some nice boneless leg of lamb from Whole Foods; they even cubed it for me. I didn't think I was a big lamb fan before, but I am now.

Served this on a buffet that also had chicken & beef, but this was the definite hit. Everyone loved it. I am going to serve this as my Easter lamb dish this year.

This lamb comes out so succulent and delicious! I did not have pomegranate molasses, and used maple syrup instead, turned out fabulous, though I would like to try the pomegranate sometime! I served it with a garlic yogurt dipping sauce, and a salad...yummmmm...

This is AWESOME! I made the cocktail party menu that this recipe goes with for girls night. I had some lamb on hand and decided to get some more. I got an additional pound from a local high end market(I even had them cube the meat)- and it was worth it! Great flavor. Everyone loved it- even those who don't like lamb couldn't get enough. I will definately make this again.
