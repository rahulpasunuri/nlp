My husband and I are bread pudding fanatics (had it in lieu of wedding cake on our big day) and this is one of our favorites. The richness of the croissants and vanilla cream is nicely balanced by the tart cherries and bittersweet chocolate. And it is remarkably easy to pull together, and can be prepped well ahead of the meal. Definitely halve the sugar as others have suggested. Probably makes almost 8 servings - we made ours in a Dutch oven and it set in just over half an hour.

OMGosh!! made this for New Years Eve and it was a hit!! i took the suggestion from the reviews to cut the sugar in half and i also doubled this recipe and baked it in a baking dish and then served it into martini glasses with a strawberry on the rim and topped it off with fresh whipped cream. Everyone loved it! Still craving it!! A double recipe served 8 people with about 4 servings left over!! When i do this again i'd add additional chocolate as we serve it with red wime!!

This is a really rich, decadent dessert, in fact a bit too much so for my taste. I halved the sugar and used half and half instead of cream. My guests were impressed. I personally think it was all just a bit too much. I think next time I would leave off the chocolate and pecans or make it as a creme brûlée without the croissant in it.

Less sugar plus a little bit of Gran Marnier. Superb!

I love this and so does my partner but beware it is big so don't serve after a big heavy meal. Or cut it in half and make 2 smaller desserts.

Made it for New Year's Eve-small dinner party-black tie. Everyone was in love with them. I made them ahead too. Unbaked and chilled until after dinner when I baked them. Excellent!!!! but extremely fattening!

I also followed advice from reviews and added less sugar. I have cooked these puddings in various sizes for multiple dinner parties and they are incredible! Easy to make. I even bake them in advance and leave them on counter then reheat when it is time for dessert. They are always a huge hit. Really one of my all-time favorite dessert recipes.

I've just eaten this straight out of the oven--it just smelled wonderful!! I agree with the other reviewers that reducing the sugar by 1/2 is best. I wish the writer of the recipe had specified the size of the "ovenproof bowls". I used small ramekins and ended up with 7 portions, which should have reduced the baking time. Also my 3 croissants must have been huge compared to standard versions. I could have had 8 portions if I hadn't eaten bits of the croissants. I will definitely make this again!!

ROCKED MY WORLD! Wow! So great! I made mine with dried cherries, very good dark chocolate and reduced the sugar as well. I lightly broiled the top for a moment to create the perfect golden, lightly- crisp top on each ramekin. I will mike this multiple times, I'm sure of it!

I followed other reviews' suggestions to cut the sugar and I'm glad I did. Otherwise I followed the recipie word for word.

We made this for a dinner party and couldn't believe how good it was. It's one of those desserts where the payoff is considerably larger than the amount of effort involved. We tripled the recipe and made 14 medium ramekin sized portions. And definitely cut the sugar, it's absolutely delicious with less.

I don't even like bread pudding, but this was AMAZING! I made this for a party in individual tin cups and it was the only dessert not left over!!! I have been thinking about this dessert for days. I do agree with the amount of sugar used. I only used 3/4 of a cup and it was perfect.

Easy to make and very tasty. We'll definitely make this new favorite again.

Great recipe & everyone was impressed. I was surprised that the croissants held up so well.

"That was awesome," said my husband. Really great as others have said, esp. since it is easy but seems to require skill! I also ended up with 5 ramekins worth, and one serving was ENOUGH for us. Leftovers are always welcome! I had a hard time telling when the custard was "set;" it bubbled for a long time and I finally declared it done. I would make this for a dinner party and feel like I was serving something special without toiling. Incredibly unhealthy I guess, but...

Absolutely amazing! I would actually like to give this 5 forks. Very sweet and very easy. I might cut the sugar back a bit next time. Also, this makes way more than two people can eat--I'm actually going to divide among 4 ramekins next time (or cut the recipe in half). We had for Christmas Eve dinner and loved them. There also needs to be another button beside would you make it again--need a YES, YES, YES button.

Turned out great. Was not as quick as the recipe makes it out to be but worth it. Reduced the number of yolks because I didn't have enough eggs (healthier anyways) and next time I will reduce the sugar a bit and increase the cherries.

I didn't love this, but then I'm not a big fan of custard. Everyone else loved it, though. Next time I would only use a cup of sugar - it was so sweet that I had to have a couple of glasses of water afterwards. Also, where I am, canned cherries are cheaper than dried and would probably have the same effect.

Very Nice! Easy, tastey,,impressive for a "quick" dessert. Made more than recipe claimed. Which is a good thing!

This was oooh sooo good!!! I put it in individual ramekins. I could not fit all of it into four 3-inch ramekins and each one made enough for about 2 people so the recipe made more than I expected. The left-overs were delicious heated in the microwave. I can't wait to make it again.

This bread pudding is delicious! I made it in a single larger remekin and served it from there. I expect to make this recipe a lot.
