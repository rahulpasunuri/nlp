I enjoyed these ice pops. I followed the recipe exactly and would change a couple of things for the next round: - I would not strain the raspberry sauce, I don't mind seeds and it was time consuming - I would go ahead and mix the chocolate and raspberry together, waiting for the layers to freeze took much longer than 20-30 minutes and in the end, i liked the flavors mixed. all in all, a delicious experience.

The chocolate mixes with the raspberry the first time. What we ultimately ended up with was a plain chocolate top (inverted), then a raspberry-chocolate mix, and then plain raspberry. The raspberry part was great, but my daughter also liked the plain chocolate - she thought it was like a fudgcicle. Perhaps it should just all be mixed together?
