This was messy and too sweet. Didn't like it at all.But the spiceed nuts were good.

This was a very good and easy entree for a party. They got rave reviews and were simple to make. To make 4 dinner-plate sized trays for a cocktail party, I used the following ingredients: 4 cups blue cheese crumbles 2 cups spicy nuts (I used walnuts) 12 Tbsp honey 12 endives The filling is rich, so a little (about 1 Tbsp) goes a long way in the endive leaf.

Delicious, quick, elegant but not over fussy. I recommend doubling the nuts, and freezing them to have a last minute snack on hand (providing you have a corner store with endive and stilton or gorgonzola as I do : )

Tasty, elegant, and exceptionally easy. Very popular at a cocktail party. We used gorgonzola instead - a good quality cheese is probably important.

This makes a fabulous appetizer! I made about 20 of these and they were gone in no time-my guests loved them. I used a delicious lemon honey from Argentina that was out of this world. I will definately make these again!

Wow! What a breeze to prepare! I used Maytag blue cheese and chopped pecans and everyone loved it. Will make these again for another party this week.

These are easy to prepare and tasty; however, they do get soggy quickly. I would not make them too far ahead or keep the leftovers.

BIG hit at my new year's eve party. Sweet honey, spicy nuts, strong cheese and fresh crisp endive combine to make the perfect tray of appetizers for a cocktail party. I used gorgonzola instead of blue cheese and bought candied walnuts and spicy pecans instead of making my own spiced nuts. These were so yummy and easy.

Easy, elegant and a hit at my wine tasting party! I used Gorganzola cheese, the spiced nuts & honey and also put a couple of dried cranberries on there for some festive color. The plate was clean within no time - should have made more!

I love this recipe. I have made it a couple of time. Often, instead of spiced nuts, I just make sugared nuts (leave out the spice) and they taste yummy. Always get raves.

I used a full cup of the spiced nuts and combined with the cheese before filling the endive leaves. Guests raved!

Great recipe! I took it to a New Year's party, complete with cab ride, and it was a hit! I covered cookie sheets with tinfoil and lined up the endive, adding more as there was more space when the endive were filled with cheese. I used gorgonzola and blue cheese and sprinkled them with parsley at the end for a little more color. They were a hit and numerous people wanted the recipe! Also see my notes on the spiced nut recipe. For more food & fun updates, check out my blog at: www.ChristineHueber.WordPress.com.

This recipe was so easy and delicious. Served them at a New Years Eve party and everyone loved them. I prepared them exactly as suggested and they were perfect.

Used this recipe for New Year's Eve, and everyone loved them. A couple of points though - the endive is belgian endive, specifically, and the recipe only made about 10 pieces at the most. Next time I'll triple the recipe. Very good & so easy.

Perfection! Used for a dinner party and it was great. I served with parmesan stuffed dates and a simple chardonnay--our guests thought it was a wonderful combination!

I altered this a bit and used toasted walnuts, honey, and cayenne pepper over the blue cheese. Delicious! The cayenne gave it the extra kick it needed.

This was just okay, nothing special. The spiced nuts were really good, though. I'll proobably make them alone and serve them in a small bowl for snacking at parties. There are way better stuffed endive recipes out there.

I made this for our New Year's Eve party and they disappeared! It was very easy to prepare. Instead of making the spiced nuts, I used prepared candied pecans, added a dash of cayenne and then chopped them. If you usually like creamier blue cheeses (such as Maytag Blue), I suggest using a blue that is a little sharper for this dish. It goes perfectly with the sweet-salty nuts and honey and the slight bitterness of the endive.

This was SO easy and, yet, so great! Had a few guests who weren't big blue cheese buffs, and even they liked these. I used a New Orleans Style Spicy Peanuts my husband had purchased from the Peanut Shop in Virginia, which made this recipe even easier!

I made this for our New Years Bash and it was a huge hit. For a little different flavor, I also did a variation with chopped pecans instead of the spiced nuts. They disappeared also. One suggestion -- do not add honey until you're ready to serve. It will disappear into the cheese and lose the "wow" factor. Otherwise, an excellent and ** quick ** dish.

This was a huge hit at this year's New Year's Eve party. It was extremely easy and incredibly flavorful. I bought a wonderful gorgonzola dolce. Being that the cheese is the dominant flavor, it pays to pick a gorgonzola that is really tasty.

This was super easy and delicious as well. Every piece was merrily consumed. I made it exactly as called for with the spiced nuts.
