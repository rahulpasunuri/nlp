Easy, elegant. I heeded the advice of other reviewers and blanched the asparagus for just over a minute. I mixed herbed Boursin with 1/8 cup of Dijon. I folded whole slices of prosciutto in half, smeared with the cheese-mustard mixture, and rolled up each slice around two spears of asparagus, leaving both the steam ends and tips exposed. I chilled the asparagus until cold before I rolled it, assembled the night before, then refrigerated overnight in a plastic container with waxed paper between each layer.

So easy and very flavorful. I didn't incorporate the honey mustard, as I thought it as unnecessary. I used herb boursin cheese, and once herb goat cheese. Both were delicious!

I also mixed the cheese with the honey mustard--and these were a big hit at my in-law's 50th wedding anniversary party! I just used a butter knife to smear down the prosciutto and it was fine. I echo the others--watch your asparagus carefully and do not overcook, and also dry each one very well, roll them up and let them set overnight in the fridge on a baking sheet. These were delicious and looked fancy! Thank you!

This was "delish". It also makes a good presentation. Will definitely make again.

I've made this several times and am always pleased. I suggest mixing the honey mustard into the boursin and cutting the asparagus in half. Refrigerate after assembly to firm up cheese again. These will disappear at a party. Be sure not to over-cook the asparagus.

I used dijon mustard instead and made them the night before I planned to serve them. They did taste better the following day. Beautiful presentation and yummy.

This was great recipe - delish and easy. I nixed the honey mustard and made with herbed Boursin instead. The 1/4 pound of proscuitto only went as far as 15 asparagus spears, though, not 30 as the recipe calls for.

I made these for a Christmas party and they quickly disappeared! I cooked the asparagus in 1 can of chicken broth mixed with 1 cup of water. I cooked for 1 ½ minutes and then moved the asparagus to a bowl of ice water. I cooked the asparagus the day before the party and stored in a zip-lock bag in the refrigerator until the afternoon of the party when I rolled them. Like previous posters, I combined the cheese and mustard together before spreading on the Prosciutto. Be careful that your Prosciutto isnt cut too thin or it will tear apart when spreading. Next time I will ask the deli person to put a piece of plastic between each slice. I had some leftover that I didnt get rolled before the party and rolled them for myself the next day. I refrigerated a few of them overnight and actually thought they were better having set rolled and refrigerated overnight, so will do that next time.

To A Cook from Washington, DC try a Grüner Veltliner. I think they all come from Austria. Stands up to the prosciutto and boursin.

great!! I mixed the mustard and cheese beforehand, and brushed it on, as other reviewers suggested. also only cooked the asparagus a little over a minute. once chilled in the fridge, they were really easy to handle. and delicious.

I agree with the other reviewer who said that 2 mins is too long to cook the asparagus - I cooked for 1 1/2 mins and almost wished that I had cooked them for less. I definitely just got messy with it and took the other reviewers' advice to spread on the cheese and mustard separately with my finger - having 2 clean paper towels nearby. 1 paper towel cleaned my work surface after each roll and the other one cleaned my fingers after spreading on the cheese and mustard before rolling - for a nice clean presentation. I was concerned that they were going to be too messy to eat but about 1/2 hour in the fridge after preparation firmed everything up (including the sloppy cheese) and made it all perfect. These went very fast and were eaten up but some seriously finicky and stuffy folks. Thanks for all of the other advice - truly helpful!

These went fast a recent housewarming party. I think that you need to buy more prosciutto to wrap 30 spears.

This was great.

Really good! It's much easier if you just mix the mustard with the Boursin Cheese and dip the asparagus into that mixture. Spreading the mixture onto the proscuitto is messy and difficult

i made these for my friend's baby shower. everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. i did make two changes-i lightly roasted the asparagus and used dijon instead of honey mustard.

Wonderful! Time consuming, but excellent!

-delicious! would definatly make again. -Instead of putting the honey mustard in the wrap, I served the wrapped asparagus on a bed of baby arugula and drizzled the whole dish with a honey mustard vinaigrette (found on another recipie on this site). -Labor intensive, but you can wrap all the asparagus hours before you want to serve them.

Wow! What a rich, luxurious way to eat asparagus. It was a little too rich for me. I'm glad I wrapped two stalks at a time. I found them quick and easy to make--not even all that messy. I will definitely make this again, though I may consider cutting them in appetizer peices to serve. I also can't wait to use the spread on a sandwich someday. That spread is absolutely sinful!

I agree with the previous reviewer. Wrap asparagus spears in proscuitto, then phyllo (leaving tip exposed), sprinkle with parmesan and bake until the phyllo is golden brown. You can serve them whole or cut them (on the diagonal) into bite size pieces...those seemed to go over better than this recipe, and they aren't as messy. Plus, they can be made pretty far in advance (cover with damp paper towels and saran wrap) and baked at the last minute.

This has become a staple! To make assembly easier, I mix the honey mustard and cheese together in one bowl and heat it for about 30 seconds in the microwave making it easier to spread. I apply the honey mustard cheese mixture to the prosciutto with a pastry brush and then wrap. Simple!

I followed the adive of others. I used my finger tyo apply to the cheese, and, in addition, used my finger tip to apply the honey mustard. Just great.

Great recipe! We've made this on a few occasions and got rave reviews from everyone. Next time I may try a different flavored cream spreadable cream cheese just for a change.

Although tasty, the effort in wrapping the asparagus spears was not worth it. It was also too messy as an appetizer. I prefer a slightly different version where you wrap asparagus in prosciuto and phyllo dough with parmesan cheese - then the phyllo dough makes it a cleaner treat for your guests to eat.

Although a little fiddly to make, these are very easy and good. The first time my prosciutto strips tended to want to unravel, but the next time I used more of the cheese and they were fine. These worked great for me at a baby shower (made day before and refrigerated), and they are definitely different from the typical shower stuff.

Very easy, very elegant, very tasty! I mixed the Boursin and honey mustard together beforehand to save time and to make the spreading easier. Because the prosciutto was so thin and delicate, I found it best to spread the mustard-Boursin mixture with my finger. Used less mustard than the 1/4 cup called for, but just enough to give depth and a slight bite.

Out of several appetizers I served, this was by far the easiest and I thought the best out of all of them! I used boursin w/garlic & herbs, but I think it would be great with the honey mustard mix or any other soft cheese spread. I will definitely make again.

A new favorite! Be sure the asparagus is completely cool and patted dry before assembly. I used a bit more prosciutto than the recipe states. Dee-lish.

Have made this recipe several times and always get a request for the recipe. I would recommend buying Gourmet's Parties, the book where I originally found the recipe - there are several great party ideas and recipes in that book!

I made this for a party and everyone loved it! I dropped the room temperature asaragus in boiling water for only 30 seconds until it turned bright green then dropped in into ice-water to stop the cooking process. Cooking asparagus for two minutes makes it too soft.

This was a nice easy appetizer and was very tasty. I liked the combination of the honey mustard and the boursin cheese - the mustard gave it a kick. I left the tips of the asparagus uncovered by the prosciutto and it made a pretty presentation.

Did the same as Michigan... Omitted the honey mustard and used Boursin cheese with garlic and herbs. Delicious....! Rolled two medium asparagus spears together using the spiral recipe method. They were all eaten up in minutes... What a scrumptious hors d'oeuvre...Can make ahead and place in refrigerator....

I've made this numerous times - everyone expects me to bring it. I use Boursin with garlic & herbs and leave the honey mustard out, as it is to over powering.

Taste was very good. Pain to spread cheese on procuitto. I agree with the person that said have meat cut thicker. It will make life easier.

We served this as a side dish with grilled shrimp and seasoned rice with a Napa Valley (Peju) Chardonnay, and it was wonderful!! I will be definitely tempting future dinner party guests with this both as an appetizer and with the main meal.

Excellent. I make it all the time and it is wonderful. You can prep the asparagas several hours before and the whole thing sat for six hours in the fridge before I took it out to be served and it was still fantastic.

Wonderful! I cheated and utilized Alouette cheese spread and it was a huge hit! It was the first plate to empty! Everyone had at least three a piece!

Great and easy. If you want to save time, you can use well-drained canned asparagus.

This hors d'ouevre was fabulous. One tip...don't have the prosciutto sliced too thin. Also, it works well with other flavors of soft, spreadable cheese. This will be one of my staples!
