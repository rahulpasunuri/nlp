I thought this recipe was great though I too reduced the olive oil by about half - personal preference. Paprika was terrific and I think I probably increased the proportion somewhat. I added a handful of fresh herbs - parsley, cilantro and basil - just because my herb garden is abounding. I'm giving it 4 because I think it's probably just as good as written. Also I don't strain it (just add everything to the processor) because I like it a little chunky though I might for a more elegant dinner party. I want my family to expect yummy but not too fancy!

I find this soup to be absolutely delicious. I like sharp gazpachos that have a kick to them, so for me (I used roma tomatoes), the acidity of the sherry vinegar was great, and the smokey paprika divine- I added more paprika. The only thing I don't like too much is the amount of oil. Others like the creaminess but it kills a bit of the kick for me. I will definitely try this again.

This soup is amazing! Even the children could not get enough. I agree that the quality and type of tomatoes used makes a dramatic difference in the flavor. We used Long Tom and San Marzano tomatoes, which resulted in a sweet, not-too-acidic soup. I also used a canned, thin tomato sauce from last summer's garden rather than tomato juice, which likely increased the sweetness. Please don't skip the straining step or the olive oil. The straining gives you a wonderfully smooth soup (no seeds!) and the olive oil, properly emulsified, makes it oh so creamy! (I also agree that a high quality olive oil is necessary - especially a milder one, like that made from ripe, mission olives.)

This was fabulous. I cut the recipe approximately in half, but only had about a tablespoon of vinegar. I also used the juice from a few of the tomatoes to soak the bread. I wonderful way to use up the stockpile of cucumbers and tomatoes I had. I will definitely make again.

This was excellent! The smoked paprika makes a wonderful addition. I didn't have an onion, so used an extra close of garlic and some garlic scapes and it was delicious.

This is my "go to" recipe for Gazpacho. I make it almost weekly in the summer, as it far surpasses other recipes on this site. I absolutely love it! I leave out the bread and add to my bowl as desired, but that is my only modification. Try this, you will not be disappointed!

I use Hungarian half-sharp paprika. This is a great gazpacho and good sherry vinegar is crucial.

I made this without sherry vinegar (substitute: splash of cooking sherry; splash of red wine vinegar). This is great when you have very fresh tomatoes. I had too many from my CSA so I pureed them all in the cuisinart. So easy. I average all the measurements. Didn't use paprika and I never bother to strain gazpacho. Didn't use any olive oil either. For those who want to experiment, add a little bit of watermelon for a lovely non- traditional take.

I made this soup for a luncheon which was served on a very hot day. It was very refreshing and everyone liked it. However, I did not like the orangey look to the soup. I've had this before and it was redder. I think that cutting back on the olive oil will help with the color. I will also add a teaspoon sugar to cut on the acidity next time. Finally I recommend doubling the amount of chopped vegetable mixture which is added at the end as I think it really would add texture to an otherwise liquidy soup.

I took into account some of the suggestions from other reviewers like reducing the olive oil, and watching the amounts of vinegar. Before making this recipe I sampled some gazpacho at our local lunch hangout. It was sweet and tomatoey. Very delicious. I did not find this recipe to be delicious. Part of it was the smoked paprika. I liked the way it smells in the jar...just not in my soup. Thats all I can say. I'm off to find a more tomatoey gazpacho.

I enjoyed this recipe quite a bit but a couple of suggestions. Be careful of the types of tomatoes you choose as it will ultimately affect the acidity. I chose to use Campari tomatoes which I know may seem an impractical choice at first but they are a favorite of mine so I went with it. The flavor was wonderful but it was too acidic even for me. I tried several methods for cutting it back so I could still enjoy the Campari flavor without the acidity. One... drop back a little on the vinegar. I know some might disagree but it is something to try. Second, I added a little sugar to one mixture and this helped a fair bit. Finally... I threw a dollop of sour cream on top and this increased the creaminess of it all and soothed the palate and stomach.

I prefer my gazpacho a little spicier, so will puree some red onion with the tomato mixture next time. I served with a dollop of drained goat's milk yogurt on top--a delicious compliment!

The texture was indeed very interesting. But I must agree with some: too much vinegar. Made an excellent appetizer on a hot summer day. Next time, i'll try with rice vinegar instead.

It's 99 degrees out today, so my sweaty friends and I made this recipe; we went with all the ingredients as listed (minus the paprika) and just chucked everything into the food processor and it tasted great! And there's a lot left over for tomorrow when it hits 100!

I really like the smoked paprika (the recipe wouldn't be at all the same without it). i took liberty by reducing the olive oil and also used some balsamic vinegar instead of sherry vinegar; both worked out really well. I would definitely make this one again!

I wouldn't change one single thing about this recipe. It was so fresh tasting and delightful.By chance I used V8 because that's what I had on hand, and of course I used the wonderful fresh tomatoes from my garden. A terrific summer dish.

This was great. Rave reviews from my dinner guests. I cut the recipe in half and it still made more than enough for the 5 of us.

Not bad, although I wish I had seen these recent reviews before I made.. The sherry vinegar was a bit too strong. Flavor was still good, but serving sizess were decreased accordingly - how much acid can you take? I only added a 3" long section of baguette, which seemed like too little but the result was a nice consistency. I did balance the acidity with a handful of croutons made with the remaining bread cubed and fried in olive oil.

Very nice gazpacho. I used some pretty good oil and most of a 2" wide baguette for texture, color (light red/coral-pink) and flavor. I had learned that gazpachos were, in their most basic forms, just stale bread pureed with oil, vinegar, garlic and salt, plus tomatoes and/or red bell (for red soups) or almonds (for white soups). So that I could control how thick the soup became, I added the bread and tomato juice puree at the end, rather than at the beginning. I wish I had processed the olive oil with the bread, and then added tomato juice to taste. I liked the vinegar, although I didn't use all that was called for. I will definitely make this for guests - perphaps served in martini glasses.

This recipe has a ton of potential. I think some of the ratings are low because the vinegar/olive oil addition should be done according to taste as everyone's idea of how much of those to add differ. I added it exactly as the recipe called for and did not care for the flavor of the soup as much as I did before I added vingar and olive oil. A few other things of note: use high quality olive oil; I think the "2-inch" means the length of the baguette piece rather than the diameter (I used an entire baguette and it really thickened the soup); finally, play with additions--I added celery, parsley, cilantro, serano chiles for heat (didn't have the right paprika)to the pureed part of the soup and it really made the flavors pop. Will definitely make this again but will be more frugal with the addition of vinegar (possibly substitute lemon) and olive oil.

Loved it and so did our guests. Used lots of cherry tomatos from the garden, and added some fresh basil and thyme because I thought the paprika flavor was wonderful, but a bit too strong for me Way too much for one blender load - I used 3 and then combined them in a big bowl. What a great way to use all those tomatos from your garden that you're wondering what to do with! Makes me want to try the rest of Ferraro's menu.

I just returned from my 3rd trip to Spain and I once again fell in love with gazpacho. I came back ready to make my own. This recipe is wonderful. I didn't have the smoked paprika but instead I added ancho chili powder. I was skeptical about the results until I added the last 2 ingredients, the sherry vinegar and olive oil. The color turned a beautiful pink/salmon and the texture became velvety. We shared it with our dinner guest and she and my family loved it. I will definitely be serving this during the warm summer months. I think all our guests will be raving. Must try this!

Really enjoyed this version of gazpacho - the paprika lends a smoky quality that we really liked against the freshness of the tomatoes. I used 5 gargantuan heirlooms instead of 15 regular tomatoes, and used their juice (they were overflowing) on the bread instead of using additional tomato juice. Was a great way to start the meal - a guest who "didn't like gazpacho" was converted! One note - this actually took up 4 blenderfuls to process, so have a really big bowl on hand!
