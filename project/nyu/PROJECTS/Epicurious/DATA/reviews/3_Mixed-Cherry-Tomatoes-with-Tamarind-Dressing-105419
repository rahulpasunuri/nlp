I made this to go with the spice-rubbed flank steak. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with both. The spices in the dressing were odd. My husband thought the whole thing was a waste of good balsamic vinegar.

This was good and different. Next time we make it, we will use a little less cumin seed and a little more tamarind. Unlike the previous reviewer, we have those ingredients on hand.

The taste is interesting, but as my friend who tasted it said, "I wouldn't want to eat very much of it." This dish is easy to make but the taste of fennel is overpowering. Also, tamarind paste and whole cumin seeds are not something that most people keep on hand. This recipe is okay, but there's got to be better tomato salad recipes out there.

It was very easy to make, the honey takes away from the acidity of the vinegar and tomatoes.
