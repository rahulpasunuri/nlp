I had the cake mix in the pantry, it's winter and the weather is cold and snowy and i wanted something to use the cake mix! I followed the suggestions of others, actually eliminated the sugar on the fruit and used fresh pineapple instead of canned and lots of nuts in the crumb mixture and sure enough it still tasted like a cake mix- what do they put in those things? It was apleasant crumble but I won't make it again and won't make another mix receipe. I agree that it wasn't that much easier.

Very good recipe and easy to make. The pineapple added a nice flavor to the blueberries. Add whip cream or vanilla ice cream as the recipe suggests but just as good without it.

I know a version of this, entitled "Dump Cake", which uses cherry pie filling instead of blueberries, and simply "dumps" the cake mix on top with pats of butter (2 sticks). I hoped that this recipe would be an upgrade of that old recipe, but I didn't find these flavors very distinctive, and it was much more complicated to make.

Easy to make and plenty of it. Used pineapple that was in unsweetened juice and it turned out great.

After I tried this recipe for the first time, I had to make it 2 more times for other occasions - it was so easy and good! I've had to give the recipe to at least 3 others.

I made this for a dinner we were having at work. It never made it until dinner. After our 1st break, it was all gone. This recipe is awesome!

I was pretty skeptical about a recipe that uses a cake mix but I decided to try it anyway. I made the following adjustments after reading all the other reviewers: sifted the cake mix to make it lighter; used pineapple in its own juice rather than heavy syrup; cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and used it for the topping only; increased the oats to 2 cups; added 1/8 teaspoon salt to the topping; toasted the pecans. It was delicious served with vanilla ice cream and my family practically inhaled it. I didn't taste the usual "cake mix from a box" flavor at all. A hearty Thank You to all the reviewers for their great suggestions.

I made some modifications to the recipe, and then it was delicious! It has been a huge hit at all my parties. I use 2 cups of oats (instead of 1/2c), only 1/2 cup brown sugar in topping only, only 1 stick of butter and replace rest with 1 cup of applesauce, and 1-10oz pkg of frozen raspberries and 1-10oz pkg frozen blackberries (instead of one of the packages of blueberries). I also use pineapple in light syrup.

Yummmy!! After cutting the sugar WAY DOWN, this recipe was very simple and tasted great. I used fresh pinapple and added no sugar to the fruit. I also used walnuts instead of pecans and halved the sugar on the topping. So good with vanilla ice cream! It was the first time I had purchased a cake mix, ever!

This smelled divine as it baked, but when we tasted it we were a little overwhelmed by the sweetness...so were slightly disappointed. I halved the recipe and made it in individual ceramic dishes, which worked nicely. I would make this again, although next time I would definetely not use pineapple canned in heavy syrup, instead would use pineapple in juice, and white sugar instead of brown.

Of course cake mixes provide short cuts, but in the end they TASTE LIKE CAKE MIXES. We are not keeping tabs on the minutes or hours put into preparing a dish, we're talking about the end results. THE TASTE! Incidentally, this particular recipe using a cake mix is no short cut. Each to his own.

This dish was wonderful. I accidentally solved the sweetness problem. I used 1/4 cup of white sugar in the topping and didn't put any sugar in the blueberry mixture and all my co-workers think that it is the perfect sweetness. Overall, this is a winner with everyone!

I also think this recipe is very delicious! It can be substituted with just about any fruit - and I used canned pineapple with juice, not a heavy syrup. It was just the right sweetness for my family. It makes a large quantity and should be eaten the same day, if possible, because it tends to get a bit mushy after it sits overnight. I will definitely keep this recipe.

Very good recipe. Eating the crumble with vanilla ice cream definitely tones down the sweetness. This recipe is quick and easy. Definitely will make again.

I make weekly desserts for my regular customers and employees and they all loved this one. I will defineately make it again.

Thought this was great. However, I substituted fresh strawberries and rhubarb for the fruit. That may solve the "too sweet" problem many people had.

Yes,it is a bit too sweet,but it is fast,easy,and works well in a pinch when unexpected guests come.I liked it for those reasons.Sometimes there is just not enough time in a day and this recipe is good for those kinds of days.

Since I don't like anything incredibly sweet, I would cut down on the extra sugar by using only 1/4 cup, and use either fresh pineapple or canned without any syrup. I would also add a pinch of salt and maybe some nutmeg. The cake mix has sugar in it to begin with. It doesn't really need any extra.

When I made this, everyone I served it to, loved it. They all wanted the recipe, and could not believe how easy it was to make. In today's time a lot of people are WAY too busy not to have a "cake box" shortcut. London hit the nail on the head when they wrote "it's all about the final product". It was delicious...

Way to sweet,this was a big waste of blueberries, the topping wasnt great either.

I agree with London...I'm not an "out of the box" cake baker, but using a cake mix in recipes such as this one is a great shortcut and tastes wonderful. I love this recipe, but for those who aren't into "sweet" it might not be for you.

Cake mixes often provide wonderful shortcuts to great recipes. It's not always how much time you put in to a recipe that counts, but how much it impresses your guests! This recipe tastes great and can be thrown together in no time at all -- a great one for last minute get togethers!

Are recipes that include use of a cake mix what I will find on this web site from now on? I hope not.

I substituted frozen (unsweetened) raspberries and added more brown sugar to tone down the tartness. Served warm with vanilla ice cream and my coworkers raved about this for days. It is quite rich and comforting.
