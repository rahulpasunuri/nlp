WOW - this is so good. I made it the week before Thanksgiving and even my non-cranberry eating father and husband loved it. Not too tart, not too sweet - just perfect. And the pepper and parsley make you seem like a master chef to your unsuspecting family! Just made and tasted another batch of this for T-day tomorrow. My in-laws are going to love it.

I now field requests for this as a staple in our tradition, it's fantastic! The parsley really does add a lot to it in both taste and in color. Great recipe!

first time for making and tasting cranberry sauce, what a pleasant surprise!!

I make this at least once a year. A few points: with diabetics at the Thanksgiving table, I used a fruit- sweetened marmalade (try different ones to see which you like). I think this made the sweetness subtle rather than overpowering. Fresh o.j. or anything not from concentrate made a world of difference in the bitterness quotient. I love the pepper, but the kids at the table did not, so I pepper my own with fresh ground. The parsley must be fresh, and must be flat-leaf-- otherwise, it will be bitter and bland. The quality of cinnamon stick made a difference, too. I prefer the warmer flavor of Ceylon cinnamon, rather than Mexican. I make it several days ahead and cook it a bit longer for texture and complexity.

Yummy, Yummy, Yummy. I've never been a fan of cranberry sauce, I think it's too bitter. This one will change anyone's mind! It's sweet with a nice hint of citrus. I highly recommend it!!

What an excellent cranberry sauce! One of the best I've ever made. I can't understand the people who say it was too bitter or who added additional sugar. With a good sweet marmelade (I used Knott's Berry Farm brand), it's sweet enough. The parsley and pepper dont's have such a huge impact on this dish that they need to be eliminated. Try the recipe as-is and see for yourself. I made it a day in advance. It was really delicious and I will add it to my recipe box and make it again and again.

Looks, smells, and tastes like Christmas! The parsley makes it beautiful -- like a bowl of holly -- and with the pepper makes the sauce complex and interesting, more than just a fruit jam. Definitely has a bitter taste, which I don't mind; could be the marmalade I used (Zentis Belfrutta). Great on biscuits!

SO GREAT. didn't add as much pepper or parsley as called for, but it still turned out fabulously. two tablespoons of honey sweetened up the bitterness.

VERY GOOD

Blah! Made this as directed and it was awful! The parsley was overpowering. Good thing I made it ahead of time for Thanksgiving. I threw it out and ended up making the Cranberry Sauce with Crystallized Ginger (from this site) instead. MUCH better!

It is so hard to decide which recipe to try, I usually make 2. This one turned out great. I chose it because of the unexpected ingredients. I don't understand the people who make this and say they left out the Parsley and Pepper. You needed a recipe to tell you to make cranberry sauce w/ O.J. and cinnamon? I'm pretty sure that version is printed on the bag. The parsley is subtle, but nice and fresh...will compliment food well. The pepper is a surprise undertone that gives the flavor some complexity. Because I don't enjoy plain ol' sugary cranberry sauces, I really liked it. This one is still plenty sweet, so the spices provide a bit of a relief from that.

Without a doubt the best cranberry sauce I've ever had.

Have made every T-day since 2003, when my mom and I doctored it to include: 1 cup of marmalade (Dundee's), a mixture of fresh orange and lemon juice (2/3 c.), 1/3 c. sugar, 1/4-1/2 c. chopped red onion and the zest of the juiced orange and lemon. We left out the parsley entirely.

Yummy AND easy! This tasted so good, we ran out!!! And with only 5 people eating it. Will make again, and again!

I made this using Orange-Ginger marmalade, and leaving in the pepper and parsley. Make sure the parsley isn't too bitter, and its a great savory addition a traditionally overly sweet dish.

This was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving!! I made it two days before and I think that gave it plenty of time for the flavors to blend together. I opted to leave out the pepper and parsley. It just didn't seem right to me. I also added a little bit of sugar. Several people, including me, who don't normally like cranberry sauce loved it!

I've made this every Thanksgiving since the recipe appeared - everyone loves it! And it couldn't be easier to make. The parsely is a surprisingly nice addition, lending the sauce a subtle undertone in flavor. I highly recommend that you make this 2-3 days ahead, as the taste is at its best after sitting.

I've made it twice since Thanksgiving. Fast and easy to make. No cinnamon stick? Use ground cinnamon.

Used this recipe again this year and it was as good as I remembered from last year. No chopping or grinding---finished in minutes. And such a fresh and tart taste. Usually at our feast the cranberry sause is there "because". This cranberry sauce is a star. I did omit the pepper and parsley--just didn't sound quite right.

Cranberry suace was something I threw out after each Thanksgiving meal - it has to bo on the table but no one eats it! This recipe changed all that - my 1 year old nieces couldn't get enough of it! There were NO LEFTOVERS! This year I am making a double batch!

I loved this recipe! I made it completely as it was called and thought the parsley was fine (of course, make sure you use fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley). Even my MIL who doesn't like cranberry sauce loved this!

Since I don't like cranberries, I'm basing this review on what other people thought. Everyone said they loved it but my husband thought it had way too much parsley, which it does. There was a lot left over, but the canned cranberry sauce wasn't touched, and that doesn't taste any better either. I don't think I would make this again.

Make this a day ahead. It definitely benefits from sitting and chilling overnight. Helps the flavors blend. Had it for thanksgiving and everyone raved....will make again very soon. Did find that it needed a little more sweetness though. Added a bit more orange juice. I was also leery about the parsley, but I added half the amount called for and was pleasantly surprised, it really does compliment the overall flavor. Has to be fresh parsley though. Also used two cinnamon sticks and next time, might even try 3, it adds a very subtle flavor. Definitely a keeper! and sooooo easy.

I read one review before I made this and saw a similar recipe in one of my cookbooks so I added two tablespoons of sugar. My guests really liked it. If I did it over again I would agree to discard the parsley and pepper. It gets in the way of the sauce and detracts from the tartness and flavors of the cranberyy and marmalade. I would definatly make it again/

I also omitted the pepper and parsely. Thought it was quite good. I usually find cranberry sauses cloyingly sweet, but this recipe had a very pleasing tartness enhanced by the cinnamon. I was very quick and easy to prepare. What's not to like!

This was delicious--the right combination of tart and sweet. I omitted the pepper and parsley, though. I don't like cranberry sauce, but this one changed my mind!

Have tested many Cranberry dishes much better. Will not make this one for Thanksgiving.

To Jeanette - As a working baker/chef, I would say yes to the blender, and NO to the last 2 ingredients. After I made this, the Italian parsley-finely chopped- was stuck to my teeth, and the pepper, even though toasted to lessen bitterness, added an unfavorable taste. Personally, I favor sweetness with sweetness; Cranberries and cinnamon need sugar to accentuate themselves, not pepper.

This sounds like the tartness my family would prefer but can anyone tell me if this is something I could put in a blender when it is done to make a kind of sauce?

Rating: 2
Easy, easy dish. Good recipe for individuals who like the "whole" cranberry recipes. Not so good for individuals who prefer a "relish". The sauce tasted great, but did not offer enough to offset or compliment the striking tartness of the cranberries - per my family taste testers. Will not make for Thanksgiving.
