I made this over the weekend for a cookout. I also had trouble getting the whites to 170 (I stopped around 140), as the temp got close to 140, the whites started smelling like cooked eggs, which worried me a little. After mixing everything together, it tasted very good,so I was pleased. The only thing I'd change if I make this again would be to bake the crust before freezing it.

This was incredible. I was so excited to see a recipe for a Tortoni cause we grew up in the Bronx and us kids had them as a treat after dinner at restaurants. But they were in little paper cups and didn't have the cherries... this is a terrific grown up version that I'm proud to serve. As a note, I did not find frozen cherries but used frozen raspberries instead. Everyone loved it but I will be making one with cherries for this weekend. Can't wait!

This turned out amazingly. I used frozen dark cherries and used the whole 16oz bag, which worked out fine. When using the double boiler I whipped everything by hand, as I only have a standing mixer - not a hand held. It required some elbow grease, but it's totally doable. Also, I was taking this to a BBQ, where it sat out for about 40 mins before consumed. It held up, but if you can, keep it cold as long as possible. People loved it, it looked/tasted incredible, and it was not hard to make. I made 5 other desserts for the occasion; this was the first to go. Prepare yourself for the ooohs and aaahs.

I made this for a Fourth of July BBQ, and everyone loved it. However, I was completely unable to find amaretti cookies anywhere in the greater Seattle area, so I used Nilla Wafers instead. I wouldn't say that the recipe was easy, but it looked lovely and tasted great.

Was very good ... light, easy to make in steps then freeze.

I've had this recipe sitting in my recipe box for ages - always wanted to try it. It worked out well, was fun to make, and a nice change from my usual cheesecakes or chocolate desserts. And any dessert you can make the day ahead gets extra points.

Everyone loved this dessert!!! I used frozen, unsweetened Door County, Wisconsin cherries, which are excellent. I didn't pay attention to the fact that the quantity given for the almonds was for two elements of the recipe. I realized this after I'd already ground them, so I decided to make 50% more crust to keep the proportions correct. Instead of vanilla wafers, I used Pepperedge Farm Chessmen, a shortbread cookie. I think this was a good choice. I guess my beater speed was too high because I did not get the eggwhites anywhere near 170 degrees--I was worried about overbeating them. This didn't seem to affect the recipe, and I assumed it was for food safety. I searched the web for other tortoni recipes (was not inspired) as well as my Silver Spoon cookbook (nothing) so for me at this point, this is the definitive tortoni recipe. I might try some variations in the future. This dessert has great presentation because it slices very easily and the cherries are so pretty.

Delicious dessert. I bought amaretti from the local italian bakery and they were heaven. i put extra ones into the filling. Next time I might try making the crust out of graham cracker so that it's more flavorful than the vanilla wafers. also, i wasn't crazy about the toasted almonds in the crust so i'd probably skip those as well. I used frozen cherries since fresh were not in season and they were ok- not great. When I make this again, I'll use something that's available fresh that goes well with almond- i think it would work particularly well with blueberries or raspberries. If you wanted to emulate the tart of a sour cherry, then maybe blackberries.

This was an outstanding recipe. It is light and very nice for summer. It is a bit involved, although it isn't difficult--there are just several steps to get through. But the flavor is wonderful.

I have made this dessert several times and it is really good! Be sure to use tart cherries and follow the directions: the first time I made this I started whipping the eggs before the water was simmering. It still worked, but eggs were whipped before reaching 170. I subbed crumbled macaroons for the amaretti cookies and low fat vanilla wafers for the regular vanilla wafers; tasted great!

Tried this recipe out prior to making it for a Christmas in July Saturday Dinner and Sunday Brunch. It was great! Simplified recipe by using Just Whites (R) pasteurized dried egg white reconstituted according to package instructions and eliminating the separating of the whites and beating over simmering water until 170F. The reconstituted whites had an unusual aroma, which disappeared when incorporated in the recipe. Made the simplified recipe for the two parties and all of the guests were impressed and asked for the recipe.
