My mother's is better and easier -- 6 egg yolks, 6 ozs. pineapple juice, sugar to taste (about 1/3 cp), mix and pour into caramelized mold. Bake at 350 in bain marie. (She is from Colombia so this is as pure as it gets for the purists!)

I have made this twice. It does tend to seperate a bit, but it is wonderful. You have to like pineapple, I call it intense. I am sure flan snobs roll their eyes at the thought of just using juice, but it works for me. A worthwile experiment!

Well, it seems that in using just egg yokes and juice for a flan that the consistency tends to break up - it doesn't gel as well as the traditional flans. The bottom (after flipping it) tends to separate from the custard too. Also, it's my personal preference, but I felt the pineapple taste was a bit too strong... I would have preferred more of a pineapple essence. I would suggest that if you don't often make flan, that you choose the lemon-anise flan (recipe available on Epicurious)... otherwise, if you prepare flan often, this is an interesting experiment.
