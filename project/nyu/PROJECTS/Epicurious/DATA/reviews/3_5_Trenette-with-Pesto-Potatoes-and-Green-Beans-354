This is an awesome recipe! By far my favorite vegetarian dish. Would be great with garbonzo beans added.

A great basic homecooking recipe that I just recommended to my thrifty cooking minded daughter Jessica. I also used the bought pesto ut I am sure its even better with homemade. You can also use other pasta, such as slim penne or linguine, but I wouldn't use spaghertti.I used only one lage baking potatoboiling it for 10 min instead of the recommended 5. Its a great vegetarian dish also and makes great leftovers next day!

This was a great weeknight side dish. I made this along side salmon and asparagus. I used store bought pesto but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Very good!

This is my favorite - I'd saved the 1995 magazine in which it originally appeared, but had lost it -and now it's found. This is awesome - great blend of tastes - starch and veg in same dish. Better the next day even!

My husband and I enjoyed this dish while in Italy on our honeymoon. It's one of my favorites and the reviewers who criticize the potatoes just don't know what they are talking about!

Nice taste but a little too bland. Not sure about using potatoes with pasta, although I did try this in another recipe and it was great.

A nice basic pesto recipe, I've used it for other dishes. The overall combination is very tasty. I've made it using quinoa pasta (higher protein/fiber than regular pasta) and it's a very good combination although not as good for leftovers as with regular pasta.

I've made this several times, both for company and family. Delicious as either a side dish or a main course. Best with thin french green beans.

Loved this dish, but next time will omit the potates. The best basil pesto I've ever made.

A terrific recipe for the family. I used my own pesto recipe and used fresh green beans from our garden. Although my husband liked it much more than I did, I don't think it's special enough for company.

This is an excellent side dish when served with grilled lemon pepper chicken
