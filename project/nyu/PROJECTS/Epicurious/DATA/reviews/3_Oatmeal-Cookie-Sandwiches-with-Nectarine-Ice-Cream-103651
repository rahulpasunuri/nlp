I haven't tried this recipe with the nectarine icecream yet, just the cookie. It was so delicious. I used turbinado sugar for part instead of all sugar for a little extra crunch without losing the chewy!

Individually each component was delicious. The ice cream was just delicious and easy. The cookie recipe is the exact replica of the Quaker Oats oatmeal cookie recipe halved. But the combination of the two was way too sweet. I don't think I'll be making this again...except the ice cream perhaps with peaches next time..

Made half of this recipe last night to make 4 sandwiches. Made a boo-boo and accidentally used 1/2 tsp. of baking soda for my one-half recipe. Added extra cinnamon and vanilla, as suggested by reviewers. Also added 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts. The batter was SO stiff that I wanted to add water, but resisted the urge. Even though I only needed one cookie sheet for the 8 cookies, I did rotate it from the top oven position to the lower one, as the recipe directs. They baked up perfectly in the allotted time. Absolutely divine sandwiches! Perhaps my ice cream/nectarine mixture was not too sweet because my nectarines were not as ripe as they smelled. (The pit areas were weird!!) But, ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS sandwiches. Can't understand anyone giving this recipe a bad rating. Hubby will never buy Klondike bars again. Do try these. They are time consuming, but worth every minute.

no so good. have had better oatmeal cookies and the ice cream was way to sweet to go along w/ the sweetness of the cookie.

I haven't made - read the reviews. The poster from Ontario - you mention only an egg to moisten. You forgot the butter, I think.

Not the worst cookie in the world, but certainly not the best. I won't make these again. I added pecans and choc. chips and they were still on the flavorless side. Need to up the salt, cinnamon and vanilla for starters. To the cook in Ontario, could you have measured something wrong, the batter was definately stiff, but with the butter and sugars whipped so light, I didn't have any problems...just a thought. Lord knows I've measured wrong a time or two! Oh yeah, I think that these would probably be good as the ice cream sandwiches. The cookies have the right texture to hold together, without being too dry. So maybe I'd try them again with the ice cream.

Despite the previous rave reviews, I must say that these cookies were the worst thing I have ever baked. They came out tasteless and spongy. Waaaay to many dry ingredients in this recepe. The only thing moistening it was one egg. I ended up having to add water to the recepe just to stir it into a dough. What a disaster, I ended up throwing out the batter. They bombed worse then any cookie I've ever seen.

I only made the cookies in this recipe, and they were great. Perhaps next time, I will add a little less butter. (I doubled the recipe, so I had two sticks, maybe next time 1 1/2). I made some with raisins, which were okay, but I added walnuts to a second batch...amazing!

This is a great cookie It's not too sweet and compared to other popular cookies like chocolate chip a lot less fat. My one suggestion for improving the flavor is to toast the oatmeal on a cookie sheet for 5-7 minutes at 350. Be sure to let the oatmeal cool before adding it to the dough.My husband said "this is the best cookie I've ever had!"

The cookies are great on their own! I actually doubled the recipe and added 3/4 cup of golden raisins for an added boost. I like making them large. They're more fun that way and they're great to add to my son's lunch bag! They freeze very well too!

These are really tasty...a real summertime treat. Other types of fruit could be substituted for nectarines. Suggest making more cookies and smaller, as they are rather large. Cook cookie a little less, if a softer cookie is desired. It's a good basic recipe lendin itself to creativity.
