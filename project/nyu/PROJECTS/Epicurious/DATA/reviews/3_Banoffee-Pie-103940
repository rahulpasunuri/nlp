It might well be that coffee was originally part of the recipe, but nowadays it's understood that the "offee" is for "toffee". This recipe is from Honolulu? I'll find something more traditional.

I haven't cooked this but I was a little curious when somebody mentioned that Banoffi Pie has nothing to do with coffee. I did a google search and found that the original recipe for Banoffi Pie is credited to Ian Dowding and does indeed include coffe. If you like you can Wiki Banoffi Pie and see the original recipe for yourselves.

A fool proof, super easy, mess free way to cook the sweetened cond. milk is to just put the two cans (labels removed) in the med. sauce pan under 1 inc of water. Bring the water to a low simmer and simmer for up to two hours. You'll get the perfect carmel consistancey with out a dirty pan or having to stir. My family loved this pie! I also added one mashed banana to the filling and put sliced banana on the bottom of the crust before filling.

I'm not quite sure why everyone had a problem getting the condensed milk to go like caramel - did you accidentally use evaporated milk instead? I simmered one can's worth for ten minutes and that was enough to make it like fudge! Also, banoffee pie is nothing at all to do with coffee, so I'm leaving it out of mine. The rum is a nice touch, though - my rum-loving partner especially likes it!

My guests loved this impressive dessert, altho I made quite a few changes to the original recipe. I used 1 can of condensed milk and cooked it long enough so it was sticky like toffee, and not runny at all; I didn't use coffee and used plain whipping cream (in line with the original banana toffee pie), lessened the sugar so it wasn't too sweet; and used digestive biscuits plus butter for the base. Oh, and put it in fridge for couple of hours before serving so it's firm and not blobby when you cut into it.

I have made this recipe at least three times, and everybody enjoys it! It's rich, so serve smaller pieces, but it's good

The key to making banoffee pie is to boil the cans of condensed milk for 3 hours without opening the cans!

My family had a "dessert party" and I searched all my cookbooks and magazine clippings for the perfect recipe. I thought this recipe looked so good in the picture, that I had to try it. Well ... I was extremely dissapointed with the results. For one thing, it was a mess to cut into. It was a big blob of beige cream on the plate, not at all pretty like the picture in the magazine shows. How they got that picture to look like that, I'll never know. One of my daughters (30 years old and a great cook herself!) claimed that she couldn't even eat it, it was so terrible. Mostly everyone who tried it did not like the flavors together. They found that there was too much of an overpowering coffee flavor in the cream, and it was intensely sweet. I would never make this again. It was an expensive flop, and I had the worst dessert at the party.

I made this after my brother returned from Ireland and raved about Banoffee Pie. This recipe is a take-off of the original, which does not include macadamias, rum, or coffee. I also had a problem with the filling setting up. I would definitely cook it longer, until well caramelized. However, it was delicious! The combination of flavors was amazing. My brother agreed it was a great twist on the original.

I have not made this recipe, so I cannot comment on its effectiveness. What I can say, as an ardent Anglophile, is that Banoffee Pie has NOTHING to do with coffee, and EVERYTHING to do with toffee. There is no coffee flavor at all in a proper Banoffee Pie. Just pure, sticky, unadulterated toffee. Yum.

The pie looked beautiful until I cut into it! The filling never congealed and it ran all over the plate. If anyone has had more success getting it to stick together I would love to know. Most guests liked the taste, but it looked like a disaster. I would only make it again if I could solve that problem.

Like the other reviewers I found this dessert to not be worth the hassle. It was way too sweet and difficult to slice. It looked beautiful but it failed the taste test.

My wife enjoyed this; however, the rest of our guests found it nearly inedible. The condensed milk/toffee was much too chewy and sweet. This pie was just plain difficult to eat with little reward for the effort. Perhaps the consumption of this recipe would be better suited as a labor of Sisyphus.

I had this delicious pie at my sisters house over the Thanksgiving holiday. I loved it and I could not wait to give it a try. I really enjoyed the different textures. It will definately be making an appearance at my next dinner party.

It looked great when I finished it, but went somewhat runny and was too sweet. I would cook it even longer than the recipe says. If I ever attempt it again, I might try just one can of milk & fold some cream cheese into it. Also, we thought there was too much coffee in the topping.

I made this pie for a dinner with friends and I must say I to was disappointed with the results.the filling turned out like a big blob of carmel which made it difficult to eat.this dessert was not worth the effort.

This recipe showed great promise but did not come through for me in the end. I was embarrassed because my guests were unable to finish their pieces. They were polite about it, but I could tell that they didn't really like it. That layer of sweetened condensed milk makes this pie taste way too sweet and rich. It's almost like eating a big thick layer of Bit-o-Honey candy (only without the honey, of course). Maybe it's just me, but this pie was not worth the time and effort that went into preparing it.

Ever since having a similar dessert in Stratford-Upon-Avon in 1991, I've been searching for a similar recipe. I didn't use the coffee in the whipped cream. My neighbor's loved this, and I thought it was OK. I might add a layer of chocolate or something next time. It is impressive looking when cut and served.

I made this for a party over the weekend and it was sensational! I cooked the milk for a very long time so that I would be sure it would set. Also, I would add a little vanilla to the custard. I would also add a bit more sugar to the whipped cream - it was a little strong for my taste. This pie had really wonderful flavor though - I will make it again.

My husband thought this was the best thing he'd ever eaten. However, it did not ever "set". We ate every bit anyway, with a spoon.
