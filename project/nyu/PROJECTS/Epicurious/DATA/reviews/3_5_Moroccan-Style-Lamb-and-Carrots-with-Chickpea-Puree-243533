This recipe is simple and amazingly delicious. I used thicker cut chops, so I probably could have cooked them and the carrots for the same amount of time. Also, in lieu of the chickpea puree, I used garlic hummus and added cumin. I would love to try it with black truffles.

Made this for company using loin chops and it was a big hit. I thought the flavors on the meat were subtle and loved the carrots - I threw in some quartered campari tomatoes with the carrots as well, and served with cous cous and the Turkish zucchini pancakes from this site. The garbanzo puree was a nice touch, but I didn't think it added anything in particular to the dish.

I really didn't care for the cinnamon, it really overpowered the lamb, and was rather greasy,The puree was really good though, will probably just grill the chops next time with a little allspice.

Easy and excellent recipe! I, following the advice of others here, cooked the carrots separately, and through in some parnsips as well, which were a really nice complement to the warm spices. Next time I would pan sear the lamb chops for a minute before putting them in the oven to get that nice crust that you sometimes miss through roasting alone. Served with couscous (with lemon, pepper and a little truffle oil) and a Syrah/Zinfandel blend that matched the lamb perfectly.

Awesome dish. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of cooking the carrots and lamb separately. My chops were very think 3/4 to over an inch and the cooking time for them was close to 7 minutes per side (still quite rare). I took the carrots out and broiled the chops. The puree sealed the deal. Served the meal with Israeli couscous and a salad. Will definitely make again and would be a hit with company.

Easy enough for every day but delicious enough for company! I roasted the carrots on a separate cookie sheet and doubled the recipe for 6 people (1 1/2 Lb of lamb would not have been enough for 4 people). I'll definitely make it again and will also try drizzling it with truffle oil.

Very good - quick and easy! Had the chops and carrots ready to go before the oven had a chance to heat up. It was quite greasy. Next time, I will cook chops on brolier pan or grill and carrots in separate dish. Other notes: baby carrots made it even simpler. We wanted more of the chickpea puree (basically hummus), so you may want to increase the quantity.

Really delicious and very easy to make. Maybe I will drizzle with some truffle oil next time for a change. Served with couscous.
