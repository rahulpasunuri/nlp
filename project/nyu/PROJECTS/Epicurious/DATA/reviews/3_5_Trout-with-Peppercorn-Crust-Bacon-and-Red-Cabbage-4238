This is a very easy and elegant fish dish. I've also made it with skinless fish (rock cod) and have added red onion to the cabbage as well. Even our finicky fish eaters love it.

This very simple recipe lets the few highlighted flavors really shine. The cabbage is unexpectedly delectable, and the color of it is just gorgeous. This recipe has become a regular around our house.

I prepared this for a casual, at-home 4th date. The date went very well. Easy to make & very tasty, particularly pleased with the way the cabbage turned out.

Ditch the trout, keep the cabbage! I'll use it for all other white fish dishes!

Very tasty and attractive! My husband thought he didn't like cabbage until I made this dish.

I made this when it first came out in September and have repeated it several times. The bacon gives the trout a nice flavor.
