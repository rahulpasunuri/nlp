My family (age 4, 7 and grown ups) all love this recipe. Delicious, and a great use of the bounty of zucchini from our garden. Aside from swapping the gnocchi for the ziti I always have in the pantry, we follow recipe as is...yum!

One of the best room temp pasta dishes I have ever had! Improved with time spent in fridge. Didn't even have the shrimp and used dried basil! Still delicious! Loved the lemon-y vinaigrette (used extra on salads the next week). Did add a little red pep seeds just cause I love that combo with lemon and parm. So easy for summer and what to do with all of those zucchini in season.

This is one of my favorite "GO TO" dishes; easy, light and delicious as is. Sometimes I use chicken instead of shrimp and sometimes I'll add hot red pepper flakes. The charred zucchini is A MUST as it gives the dish it's unique flavor. love it.

I made this recipe without making the zucchini. I just made the pasta with the sauce and have made it a ton! Everyone loves it. I didn't grill the shrimp either, just threw them in the sauce to heat up. Used already cooked shrimp. Yummy! One of my favorite epi recipes!

Excellent. Did not have zucchini. Used packaged gnocchi from Trader Joe's. Needed only half the vinaigrette

My family - including my 2 yr old - love this recipe. It's a wondeful light meal for a hot summer night.

We made this exactly as the recipe stated last week and found it very boring. While we like all the ingredients, there has to be a better sauce. Unfortunately we felt like the meal was a waste of money and time.

I've made this twice now in 2 weeks, and my family loves it. Garlic is a MUST -- I add 1 or 2 minced cloves to the vinaigrette and 1 minced to the shirmp. Also, I don't bother grilling -- I cut the zucchini into1/2-inch lengthwise slices and brown on both sides in a nonstick skillet. Take the zucchini out of the pan and slice into bite-size pieces, then throw the shrimp into the same pan and saute with a wee bit of olive oil, 1 minced clove of garlic, salt and pepper. The whole dish is done in the time it takes for the pasta to cook, and it's simpler for me to work at the stove than to deal with going out to the grill. My kids love this dish and my son takes the leftovers to school for lunch.

This is a great and simple dish. We cook this on Friday nights when we want a great dish that does not take my preperation.

I like my sauces to be verry flavorful, and was disappointed at how sour the vinaigrette was! I made it according to the recipe and the vinaigrette just didn't help. Does anyone have any suggestions, because I would want to try it again, but the sauce does make me heistant...

It was delicious. We added a dab of cayenne peppar, likely would add tomtoes if doing again for flavor and color. Simple, easy, a great dish for a group to tackle!

My family really loved this dish. It was a big hit, and it wasn't too complicated to prepare.

This dish is good but lacks a little flavor and color. I used summer squash in addition to the zucchini, plus I added broiled scallops and cherry tomatoes. I didn't have enough lemon juice so I used a combination of lemon and lime, which worked out well.

I made this for dinner guests and we all loved it! Such a nice refreshing change from typical sauce. I followed the recipe exactly - no need to change it. But I think this recipe is substitution friendly.

Absolutely incredible. I like others added some capers and garlic to the vinaigrette. Rave reviews from all who tried it. Simple and scrumptious.

I have cooked this dish several times, alone and for guests. Easy, quick, and always a surprise how fabulous it tastes. My guests have referred to it as, "Unbelievable, restaurant quality!!!" I recommend using larger shrimp, 31-40 count. Thanks epicurious!!

I make this a lot. Everyone loves it! I sometimes double the vinaigrette and use half as a marinade for broiled or grilled chicken. I either cube the chicken and add it to the pasta, or serve the chicken cutlets on kaiser rolls. I also broil or grill red or yellow peppers in addition to the zuccini. One other tip: put oil, garlic and the veggies in a plastic bag to coat evenly. A great dish to take to a pot luck lunch or dinner.

I served this dish to friends and we all loved it. It makes a lot of pasta--we were 4 adults and 5 kiddies and there was lots left over.

I first made this for my sister's birthday in June 1995. It was so memorable that I make it every year at this time! This recipe is excellent without any additions. Simple, delicious summer flavors.

This recipe always goes over well with company. It's relatively easy to make and is so delicious as is (no need to add other spices or vegetables). Even if you don't have shrimp, the grilled zucchini alone is fantastic!

We love this recipe so much, that when I misplaced it, I had to look it up online to make it again.

I couldn't find a good calamari salad, so this was a great base. If you try it with calamari, Par boil the rings and/or tenacles for 30- 45 seconds, then put in an icecube bath for a couple of minutes. Make sure to add diced red bells, garlic, and capers. Yummy

We really enjoyed this!!! I added some garlic powder to the shrimp marinade, grilled the zuchinni with a quarted onion and a splash of olive oil on the grill and tossed that in to the pasta and shrimp.

This is one of those dishes that gets better the longer it sits. The leftovers were better than the real thing! I read a lot of the reviews and decided to put in squash, red pepper, red onion and some garlic. Word to the wise...be careful about overpowering the recipie. The basil makes it strong enough. Very tasty though.

Absolutely delicious, easy and beautiful. We had no lemon, so I had to make it with fresh lime juice and red peppers instead of zuccini (grilled them). Really fabulous

Rating: 3
This was a really nice recipe - easy to make and very satisfying. It was completely devoured by my boyfriend. I substituted yellow summer squash from the garden for the zucchini and dijonnaise for the dijon mustard - it turned out creamier this way, and actually very nice. I wouldn't recommend using the parmesean,however, as the flavors are overpowered by the cheese.

Following other suggestions I also added capers and garlic (2 cloves but I love garlic). I also used scallops instead of shrimp - still delicious! Tangy and spicy and so easy!

As others suggested, I added garlic and capers to the vinaigrette. Absolutely delicious. I omitted the shrimp, substitued red pepper for zucchini (it was all I had on hand) and served this as a side dish with some grilled steaks. Gnocchi was very filling, I might try adding some additional grilled vegis and toss with a pasta next time. Will definitely make again!

Excellent! We went exactly by the recipe except we used yellow squash. It matched up beautifully with a good Oregon pinot gris. Great dish for a warm summer night.

This was so terrific! I made it with quinoa also instead of pasta (trying to cut down on carbs) and it was just as wonderful! 1/2 a recipe fed my husband and I for dinner.

I made this last night for a group of my friends, and while many liked it, I found the sauce to be too tangy. On a positive note, this dish was pretty simple to prepare.

I first prepared this dish right after the recipe was published in Gourmet in 1994. I promptly lost the recipe. I've tried to duplicate it on my own over the years with varying degrees of success. Finding it online was like finding an old friend you've been searching for. The viniagrette is perfect; I think the mustard makes it. Gnocchi is the perfect pasta. Absolutely delicious!

Wonderfully light and easy to make recipe. Perfect for a nice warm day. I served it with corkscrew pasta and added capers and a small amount of garlic to the vinaigrette. I will use less pasta next time and more vinaigrette as it was so delicious. Definitely a keeper.

This recipie is fabulous. I am a Personal Chef and my clients rave but this and ask for it again and again. The recipe is good as is, but out of this world with a few additions. Two tomatoes, cut in half and grilled, 1 large red onion, sliced into thick rounds and grilled. Thats it. You MUST use the corkscrew pasta. I do not care for any of the Chunky stye pastas, but after trying this with linguini, the corkscrew is by far the way to go. Fabulous!!!!!!

This was so delicious and so easy.I used some of the new flavoured olive oils. Served this over cheese ravioli.

I made this recipe exactly as shown using penne pasta. In a word, boring. I also think there was not enough of the vinegrette because it was so bland. Would not make this again.

I was not as wild about this as everyone else seems to be I and found myself wishing that I had made a lemon cream sauce instead. I might have added too much lemon juice because the sauce tasted a little tart.

I made this for friends when it first came out in Bon Apetit' and everyone loved it! I added scallops and it's a wonderful leftover summer meal!

This was easy and tasty, but I will decrease the lemon juice by about one tablespoon the next time I make it. I added one orange pepper and used grape tomatoes-it looked very pretty.

Delicious! My boyfriend and I cooked this for a Sunday dinner, and he liked it so much he requested it again a few weeks later. Very light and lemony--make sure to chop the basil very fine or it will clump up.

I DON'T CARE FOR PARMESSAN SO I REPLACED IT WITH SWISS, BUT MY GUEST LIKED BOTH RECIPES

I agree with those who added capers (1 1/2 tsp) and garlic (2 cloves). The red bell pepper (1/2) did add tremendous zing and color. This is a winning plate at any dinner party, whether served hot or cold.

This dish was really good, and it was also delicious served cold the next day. We made it with grilled salmon since we're not great shrimp fans. We also grilled red bell peppers, whose sweetness set off the tanginess of the vinaigrette very nicely. If you don't want to use gnocchi, I think it probably would be good with penne.

Very good! I added capers and a little garlic to the vinaigrette and put some mesquite chips on the grill for a little extra flavor. I also used some yellow squash along with zucchini and substituted farfalle (bowtie) pasta. I garnished with chopped tomatoes and a little basil. One half of the recipe made enough for 4.

Very good - I wasn't sure about how dijon would taste with the basil, but the vinaigrette was wonderful. A great one-dish meal, but was nice enough for company.

This is a favorite of mine. I vary the recipes with different pasta and seafood--scallops, salmon; also the vegetable--artichokes, aspargus, red bell pepper, whatever. Also since I grow an abudance of basil in my garden, I freeze the vinaigrette to thaw and enjoy all year round.
