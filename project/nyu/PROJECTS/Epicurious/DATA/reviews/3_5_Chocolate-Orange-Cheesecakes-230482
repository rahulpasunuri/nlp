I loved the taste of this recipe. I added more orange than it called for and it turned out great. However my crust completely fell apart when I went to eat them. Make sure you crush the cookies small enough and add a little more butter than called for.

Not worth the effort! I was looking for something cute, fast and yummy for a wedding shower and these only hit on cute. Definitely not cheesecakes, crusts were too thick and even though I filled them very high, the ratio of crust to filling was off and I had half a ziplock of filling left overover. Needless to say these won't go into the repeater file!

Being one who always likes to think out of the box and do usual things in an unusual way this recipe is great!?! I made them for a birthday party and substituted a full size cupcake pan instead. They were a bit overwhelming so i diluted the filling with more cream. I have since purchased a mini cupcake pan for my next batch & plan on making the filling full strength. Great for small one bite deserts!?!

Did everything the first review said to do (used oreos, used a bag to pipe), and they looked just like the picture!! I'm a hit at school now.

I made this to bring to a recent tailgate party and it was a huge hit. So easy too. I used Oreo cookies, 9 of them, plus the butter and sugar as called for, and pressed them into buttered mini-muffin tins. Them came out easily when I just flipped the tin and banged on the bottom of the cups. I set the cookie cups aside in a container, and put the cream cheese filling into a sandwich baggie to cool, and then just filled the cups hours later by snipping the corner and piping the filling out. It was delicious. I do agree it's a tad too sweet though, and next time I'd use a hint less sugar and orange peel in the filling and a little more grand Marnier. I added about a half tablespoon.

Cookie base did not turn out and the filling was much too sweet. I ended up going to the bakery as plan B. My sister made them on the same day for a separate event. They didn't use them either.

The only part of this recipe that I liked was that visually they looked great but they certainly were not worth the time at all! This proved to me that anything called a cheesecake should be baked to taste great.

Beautiful and delicious. Except for using chocolate graham crackers, I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great. Next time I may add Grand Marnier or extra zest.

I made these for my supper club. Instead of making them in mini muffin tins, I used full-sized ones. I doubled the chocolate crumb part, and used some mini chocolate cookies that I found at the grocery store and ran through my food processor to make the crumbs. I sprayed the muffin tins really well with PAM. I cooked them a little longer, and after letting them cool for a bit and breaking one, I found that turning the muffin tin over and banging on it a few times with my fist released the cups nicely. I doubled the filling recipe and had plenty. I added orange liqueur, too. I spooned the filling into a gallon-sized ziploc bag and cut one corner to make my own pastry bag. They were the perfect size for dessert, and everyone loved them. Easy to make, too!

I made this recipe for a dinner party and everyone loved them. I have an old pecan tassie pan that is not non-stick, but with a lot butter and using a knife, I was able to get them out of the pan. I used a healthy 1/2 teaspoon of orange rind in the filling and made a double recipe of the crust. Unlike everyone else though, I didn't have enough filling for 24 cups (only about 19). If you use a pastry bag you can fill the cups pretty high, which is why I probably didn't have enough for all of the cups. I'll make this recipe again.

Out of this world flavor. Must use a mini muffin pan -- had no problem at all with collapsing crusts. Really an easy and deceptively fancy dessert. Try it!!

These are the most finicky things I have ever made. The side crusts did not hold up at all which made it difficult to imagine the bottoms holding the filling. So, I gathered up 5 creme caramel dishes (I needed 5 desserts), buzzed the baked cookie crumbs, divided that up amongst the dishes, pattted the crumbs down, distributed the filling between them, topped them with chocolate curls and then with candied orange peel that I had made. The filling tasted delicious, they look lovely and I would likely make them again the way I just described. I will never tackle the recipe again as written. The three forks are for taste - it lost a fork out of my frustration with the recipe.

I am a caterer and make these regularly on dessert trays. Always a crowd pleaser. One of my clients calls them "adult oreos". For the crust, I buy Oreo crumbs, already crushed. I do have extra filling as I usually use a shallow tassie pan. I just double the crusts and have never had an issue with them not releasing from the pan. Simple and elegant.

I'll admit that I'm no Julia Child--so I'm always looking for a simple recipe that looks fancy. These were absolutely delicious! Everyone loved them--they are so cute and bite-sized. You can indulge without going over the top. Just don't leave them out if it's warm because they get a little runny.

I ended up doubling the crust only because I realized that my mini pan had 24 cups rather than the 12 it calls for... which could be a common error? I also grated orange zest on top rather than chocolate and they were absolutely divine! DEE-LISH!!!

To everyone who thought there was too much filling, I'm not sure if you looked at the picture or not. If you fill the crusts up past their sides and about twice as high the amount of filling is perfect.

I doubled the crust portion as there is enough filling for 24 cheesecakes. I added 1/2 tsp. Grand Marniner to the filling. It was difficult getting the shells out of the tassie pans. I ended up turing them upside down and banging the pan to get them out. They were delicious and looked pretty with chocolate curls on top.

Update: Using paper liners in mini muffin pan worked great. Didn't lose any crusts this time. Also, double the crust recipe but keep the filling the same - works out fine. These come together very quickly.

Loved the flavor combination and the size is just right. Even though I put as much filling as possible in each cup, I too had leftover filling. Next time I will double the crust. I am wondering if anyone tried using paper liners in the mini muffin pan - I lost a few crusts taking them out. Was thinking the paper liners may make it easier to get them out of the pan. Wonder how they'd be with gingersnap crust and lemon filling ...

Just to answer the question posed by the cook in France, grahams are actually the American version of the digestives and as for the chocolate just use any good quality chocolate chips or Varlhorna choclate 70% and above if you choose to do it without the biscuits. Oreos are by the way the best cookie ever. It's almost black in color and is sandwiched with a white cream. I hope this helps.

To the cook from Bordeaux, any hard chocolate biscuit will do. You can even use ones that are sandwiched together with chocolate or white filling (that's what an Oreo is). Also, probably any chocolate chips will do (the higher cocoa content the better).

This recipe sounds delicious and just what I need for this week-end, but I'm having trouble with one of the main ingredients. I come from Scotland but live in France and I just don't know what is meant by Nabisco's chocolate wafers, Guittard semi sweet chocolate chips, oreos or chocolage graham crackers. Can anyone suggest something ?

I looked at the reviews about the crust, so I decided to change it. I used a 6 oz. pkg. of Guittard semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 tsp. butter. Melt the chips and butter (stir after 20 seconds in microwave, then keep checking.) I poured a small amount in the (Pam sprayed) cups and used the back of a small spoon to spread up the sides. Refrigerate at least 15 minutes, then gently remove the shells. I used Triple Sec in the filling, which has an orange flavor to it. Fill the shells and pop them back into the fridge. I served these at a catering function. They were gone in no time. Fabulous

The muffin cups did not hold up well and are very small to work with. It needed additional butter to hold the wafer crumbs together. I also had extra filling and just spread it on the plain chocolate wafers and made a sandwich cookie. Much easier!

I also had to double the crust recipe and still had too much filling. I also added grand marnier, which gave it a fabulous taste. I had to add more butter to the crust because I found they did not stick together well. Sure are delicious, great for a cocktail party ending!

This dish is simple to make. I also tried putting lemon zest in it and it tasted great. It's a nice easy dish to make for a party. It even refrigerates well.

Yummy! Everybody loved these! Had to substitute for the chocolate wafers (couldn't find them). Used 6 oreos in place of 12 wafers - cream and all. Turned out very tasty and held together well.

I'll be making these great mini cakes again this weekend for a dinner party. I too ended up with lots of extra filling, so I made an extra batch of crusts and it evened out perfectly. Also, I used chocolate graham crackers for the crusts and they worked great.

I used Chocolate Graham Crackers (about 4 whole ones). I also used about 1/2 a teaspoon orange zest. HUGE HIT! I actually had too much filling... so, I piped it on a piece of tin foil, and froze it... YUMMY little pop in your mouth treats. I need to find a better way to make the crust have a larger whole to fill. Made for a dinner party with 7 people. Had about 7 extra frozen filling "cookies". All was gobbled up!

I substituted a ginger snap cookie crust, and increased the orabge zest to 1/2 tsp. An excellent autumn desert!

I made these for an engagement party and they were gobbled up in no time. Everyone loved them. I did experiment a little by adding 1/3 cup of Grand Marnier to the cheesecake batter, which worked extremely well. One note on preparation: the chocolate crumb cups did not hold up well during the baking, I had to re-form them once I took them out, before they cooled. However, this recipe is definitely a keeper!
