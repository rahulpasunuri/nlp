I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was absolutely fantastic. The sauce is incredible and I'm looking for other things to pour it over to use it up. The goose was tender with a delicious crispy dark brown skin. Served it with Nigella Lawson's roasted potatoes which is, hands down, the best recipe for roasted potatoes there is. It may be worth making this recipe just for the rendered goose fat. Complete heaven.

Made it for Christmas this year. First: goose is expensive! That being said, excellent recipe. Tips: 1) Make sure you strip out as much fat as possible from the cavity and perforate the skin. 2) Seal the rear of the cavity with a large fuji apple (adds wonderfully to the sauce). 3) Repeatedly drain fat and grease from roasting pan.

One word would sum this one up... WOW! This was my first time cooking goose, and it did not fail to impress. My family talked about for 3 days afterward. If you haven't cooked goose before I recommend you watch some of the videos and hints on youtube, (there are some good tips there - things like basting and how to prick the skin so the fat drains, etc) and remember this is not a turkey or a chicken. We followed the recipe with a 12lb bird, and added in a few simple steps, like basting every 20 minutes, (as well as draining some of the fat out of the bottom of the pan so it didn't smoke us out of the kitchen). It fed 8 people a true Christmas feast with enough meat left over for a huge pot of very meaty stock to make stew for the next 2 days!!! Remember to save the fat you drain off, it is amazing to cook with. As for the sauce... I agree with arlondon, it is absurdly delicious... make some good potatoes and use the sauce on them too. It's truly decadent and amazingly easy!

I was disappointed with the result. This was my first goose and it was tuff and leathery. The sauce came out beautifully though. I followed the recipe exactly. I may try the sauce with a different bird next time.

The prunes and chestnuts are such good accompanients to the flavorful meat of the goose. Instead of cooking the goose in the oven as directed, we smoked it and used the neck drippings to make the gravy. Other than that, we did not make any changes to the recipe and it turned out very good for Thanksgiving dinner.

I have made this recipe for 10 years. It always gets raving reviews! I also add portabella mushrooms to it for even more flavor.

this was absurdly delicious. there was a ton of extra sauce, but that was no problem - we had no qualms with pouring it over potatos, bread, our fingers...

This was a perfect Christmas goose! I soaked the goose in brine for 12 hours with grated orange, spices, salt, etc. - can easily be purchased from Williams Sonoma...the brining helped reduce the amount of fat and kept the meat so juicy and tender. I followed the recipe exactly and ended with a dish to remember. The sauce was absolutely amazing - as good as any French restaurant in the city! (The sauce can also be made for filet or a roast if you don't want to go through the hassle of cooking a goose.) I took about 5 tablespoons of the goosefat and made THE WORLD'S BEST roasted potatoes!

This receipe has become our Christmas Eve dinner since 1991 when it first appeared. I've cut back the sauce portions depending on the goose size, but otherwise fabulous!

Excellent, though a 10 lb goose fed 5 and was very expensive. There were no usable pan drippings, so don't bother deglazing the pan. The sauce is still good without them.

Living in Europe, I made this with a 3.5 kilo goose which fed 8 people generously. I cooked the chestnuts in the wine mixture, to their advantage. Yes, I'd make it again.

I have made this our Christmas Goose two years in a row. Everyone loves it.
