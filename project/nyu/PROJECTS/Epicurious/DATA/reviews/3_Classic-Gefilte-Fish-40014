Gefilte fish is Jewish, yes, but regional. My family are Jews from Poland and the gefilte fish broth ALWAYS was seasoned with sugar. These recipes are always very personal and most people have very strong opinions usually conforming to their own family tradition. Fine. I've eaten the fish as prepared by natives of other Jewish populations and just never liked them as much as the Jewish-Polish recipes. I'm only sorry that living now in San Francisco I'm not able to get the lake and river fish you need, as this area is primarily a source for salt-water seafood. Salmon is available here, but you can't make "real" gefilte fish with it. I crave it so!

ugh! feh! NO SUGAR!!! I make gefilte fish every holiday with my daughter and grandson (23). We love doing it and it's a regular event. Without the sugar, the fish is delish. In my family, we only use roe carp (personal choice). Making gefilte fish is not scary. The jarred stuff is icky.

This is a traditional gefilte fish recipe. And, yes, you do add sugar to the broth (not the fish) if you are from Poland! I can remember my Mother counting out the sugar cubes before adding them to the broth and my Father tasting it to make sure it was perfect.

Its a lot of work. I made it for 25 guests. Everyone said it was the best they ever had. Guests had seconds and third helpings. They also went crazy over the horseradish recipe.

Not too shabby! I am a Sephardic foods snob but once in a while I get the urge to explore my mother's shtetl heritage. This gefilte fish was light and fluffy, though a tad oily. I would use more neutral-flavored white fish and less strong-tasting varieties. I have yet to produce carrots that aren't oily, though.

I've never quite understood the romance of gefilte fish, except that it reminds us of the "good" old days in the shtetl. Like the "manischewitz" of old, this is a recipe that's best left to the ages. Go with classic Sephardic dishes, instead.

Made these today, 20.03.99., ready to freeze for Passover. I kept back some of the recipe, and instead of frying, baked the patties in medium hot oven 450 degrees till slightly brown, approx 45 mins. Delicious. Happy Pesach
