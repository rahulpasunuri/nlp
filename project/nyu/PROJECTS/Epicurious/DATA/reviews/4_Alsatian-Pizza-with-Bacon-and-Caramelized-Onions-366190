Wonderful! Used some of the extra dough to make breadsticks (just rolled in some rosemary). Baked in the oven since we couldn't use the grill.

This is just a fantastic recipe! I used just a pich of regular sugar in the onions,and they carmelized perfectly. This one is a keeper.

This recipe is excellent. I could not believe how easy the dough was to make. The first time I made this I ended up bringing it to an impromptu Friday night neighborhood party. I didn't even get a taste but everyone was raving about it. I made it again two nights later so I could try and WOW I loved it. I also made a clam version - garlic, olive oil, clams, fresh oregano, mozz, romano YUM. The dough is the key, thanks this one is a keeper.

This pizza was great! The dough was perfect when rolled out thin. We turned up the edges for a bit of a traditional crust. Caramelized onions are delicious, but don't need sugar. We don't have a grill, and it turns out that you can also use the oven: preheat pizza stones for 10-15 minutes at 550, then put the pizzas in for 8 minutes- perfect!

This was fantastic! With guidance from an Alsatian friend, I smeared some sour cream (would have used creme fraiche had it been available) on the crust before adding the toppings. I also grated the Gruyere cheese for more even coverage. I can't wait to make it again!

I was born & raised in Alsace and I eat these "tartes flambées" - Alsace is French - on a regular basis with an Alsatian Pinot Noir. Please do not add sugar as the onions are naturally sweet (unless you really need more sugar). A great dish served with a green salad.

This is a take off on Flammkuchen served along the French/German boarder. Strangely the traditional flammkuchen crust is much easier. Crust: - 2 Cups flour (Maybe more, if your dough is sticky.) - 2 1/2 Tablespoons olive oil - 2/3 cup water - a pinch (or more) of salt. Combine ingredients for the crust. If its sticky, add flour until it can easily be rolled out, as thinly as possible. Place it on a baking sheet. - no Yeast, no waiting.

i've been smitten with this pizza ever since i discovered the tarte d'alsace in trader joe's frozen pizza section. we prepared the ingredients ahead of time and then grilled the pizzas on whole wheat pita bread while camping. it was DELICIOUS. my only mods were that i added more brown sugar to caramelize the onion and i shredded the gruyere. the fresh thyme really pulled it together. we're planning on making it again this week to use the rest of the onion (1 is more than enough).
