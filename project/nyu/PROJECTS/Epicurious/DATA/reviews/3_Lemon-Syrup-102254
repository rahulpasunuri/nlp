You should really bring this recipe to a boil, cover and then let cool to room temperature.

The lemon syrup is to brush onto the cut top of a cake. When making flat topped cakes, they often swell in the middle. You take a seratted knife and trim it so it's flat. Then brush the syrup over top so it stays moist.
