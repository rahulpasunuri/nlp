Good recipe! try listing 10t as 1/2C plus 2T of butter, easier to measure

My 12 year old son and I made this cake this afternoon - we were looking for something easy and chocolately. Wow! Very rich and not too sweet, like a very sophisticated brownie. We used half bittersweet/half semisweet and made it in a 9" springform. Will definitely make again, maybe next time with all bittersweet. Did take an extra 10-15 minutes to bake.

The timing is a bit tricky - the first two times I did the toothpick test, it was completely runny, the 3rd time there were no crumbs at all - turned out more like a brownie. It still tasted good though, and people asked for the recipe. This is a great, easy chocolate treat!

This is a delicious cake and a very easy recipe. I've made it so often when I run out of time to make a fancier dessert. And it's lovely to look at once you sift powdered sugar over it.

Sorry to see some of the negative reviews as I think this is a really great recipe. The first time I made it, I misread the recipe and didn't separate the eggs (and thus didn't beat the egg whites). It was still delicious. After making the cake per the actual directions, I think it's a really wonderful recipe. I did have to bake it for a little longer than the recipe called for, but have had no other problems. This cake is absolutely delicious when topped with fresh raspberries and just a tiny bit of whipped cream.

I agree with HudsonGal...this cake is good but really need to bake longer

Good and fudgy. Definitely needs to bake longer, though (more like 35-40 minutes).

This cake was easy to make, but should not be attempted by a beginner baker. I split mine into two layers and put strawberries and ganache between layers. I then covered the entire thing with Ganache (see recipe) and made some whipped cream to decorate it. The cake itself is not too pretty to the sight, but tastes like heaven (hence why I covered it in Ganache). Overall, great cake, I would definitely make it again.

This is a wonderful, easy chocolate cake. I worried that it would be too dense, but it was rich and fudgy. I baked this for a birthday cake and finished it with whipped cream and some raspberries on top. It is excellent with a good vanilla ice cream, just make sure it's not too rich

I'm not huge on chocolate cake, but I thought that this was tasty. A dollop of whip cream on top really adds a lot.

This chocolate cake is as rich and chocolaty as any I've made. The dense chocolate flavor and melting texture paired with the fact that it's made with ingredients that I always have on hand make it four forks. It was so fast and easy this cake is instant gratification. I made it just because I was having a chocolate fit but I will definitely be making this at my next dinner party. I think my friends will love it.

Melts in your mouth! In order to get the most health benefits from Chocolate I used 4oz unsweetened chocolate w/ 4oz seminsweet choolate. To compensate I used a slightly heaping 1/2 C Sugar. Then I followed some of the recommendations of others using 2Tbs flour. I used a non-stick springform pan, lined the bottom with wax paper and sprayed w/ Pam flour combination. I also baked it for 35 mins. My husband who NEVER eats desserts, objected when I served him a regular portion of this cake ate EVERY bite. By the way, this cake looks very nice when you invert it from a spring form pan. Simply pipe sweetened or flavored whipped cream around the edges and top with a little bit of store bought caramel sauce. Also the fresh raspberry sauce on this site is to die for with this cake. Made with unsweetened chocolat it is for the serious choco-holic! Go for it!

Yummy, but I had trouble getting the cake out of the pan. I'll try parchment paper next time.

A keeper! I made this for my husband's birthday...We were saying "oh my God!" the whole time we ate this. So so worth attempting a second time (see my earlier review for flour goof). The texture was phenomenal. The flavor was great with raspberries and homemade whipped cream, as recommended. I couldn't really see it without...although I cheated & did 1/2 bittersweet, 1/2 milk chocolate, and then cut some of the sugar...but it was GOOD. I'd do it again that way. And don't buy cheap chocolate!

I can't believe I actually did this...but I added 3.5 CUPS of flour! What was I thinking??? I was kneading it, like a hunk of dough basically, and thinking...this can't be right!!! So, needless to say, after a trip back to Whole Foods for another $10 hunk of bittersweet chocolate, this cake BETTER be worth it...! Still baking at the moment....

I also added sliced strawberries on the top. The berries really add something and also makes it attractive. I had to bake the cake a little longer than the recipe calls for (about 5-6 minutes more) but that may have just been a quirk with my oven.

Easy, fast, fabulous, and elegant. Just the right size. The perfect chocolate cake. I sprinkled with raspberries and served with vanilla ice cream. This one is an essential to the recipe box!!

A superb cake. My husband's a chocoholic and I am always looking for the perfect cake. This one passed muster. It's not too sweet, but very chocolate-y. I served it with whipped cream and strawberries. Yum.

Love this cake. I tried it blending unsweetened chocolate and bittersweet chocolate to make a 70ish cocoa chocolate. It was dark and intense, great for a steak dinner and a glass of cabernet.

Frosted the cake with the chocolate raspberry frosting and added macerated raspberries. It was sooo delicious. I don't bake much, but this was easy and was perfect. Heat leftover slices up and serve with vanilla bean ice cream. We love this cake!!!

Very easy and soooo good! I cut the amount of sugar down to a half a cup, and that was plenty sweet. I also paired it with the mocha frosting taken from the CHOCOLATE LAYER CAKE WITH MOCHA FROSTING AND ALMONDS recipe found on this site. The frosting was amazing! A little vanilla ice cream, and it's a hit. Made it for dessert for my in-laws for mother's day, and it was great.

I made this cake for Christmas and my family loved it. It is easy and delicious. As one reviewer mentioned, it isn't a pretty cake, but to make is more attractive I served it in slices on plates that I drizzled with chocolate syrup and I put fresh berries on top.

Ooh La!La! This is a keeper, easy and delicious. Upon the advice of other reviewers I reduced the flour to 2TBS and increased the baking time to 30 minutes. And yes, it is not a pretty cake, but you can make it elegant in so many ways. I covered the edge with a decorative wired ribbon and arranged a pint of fresh raspberries on top and Voila!...I had a dessert worthy of my best (chocoholic) friend's special birthday.

Super easy and an excellent result. It is dense but somehow light, and a very rich flavor. Don't skimp on the chocolate. Get the best you can find like Lindt or Cailler for the best flavor.

I thought that this turned out pretty good for how quickly it can be put together. I'll keep the recipe handy for those times when a quick dessert is needed.

I made this cake for a family gathering and it was excellent. The cake was very moist so I am glad that I used a 9" springform pan and didn't have to worry about getting the cake out of the pan. I would definitely make this cake again. Also, the cooking time should be increased 5-10 minutes, as others have pointed out.

Delicious. This cake was a hit both times I made it. It got rave reviews from friends and I just loved it.

Great tasting and very easy to make. However, it definitely needs more baking time than the recipe indicates, at least 10-15 minutes longer. I used half bittersweet and half semi-sweet chocolate and it came out rich and delicious. Next time I'm going to make it with all bittersweet chocolate for an even deeper, darker chocolate taste.

Delicious! I had to make this for a project for my French class; and it was quick and easy, and everyone (high school students) loved it! It does need to be baked for an extra 10-15 minutes, and it cracks a bit, but the taste is amazing. I made two, the first one I only put 1 1/2 tbs. of flour in and it was much better than the second one, which followed the recipe. (The first one was more fudge-like and moist!) I used semi-sweet chocolate, but I think the bitter would be better. This was a major success, and now everyone I know wants the recipe. I used a raspberry sauce with lemon juice, and it totally complemented the cake. This was a GREAT, easy, fun cake to make.

Simple recipe - great cake! Had to bake it about 8 minutes longer than recommended in the recipe. The cake falls a bit after baking - but still looks great.

I have made this cake many times and love it as do our guests. I usually need to increase the cooking time though because it never really seems to be cooked all the way through in the time allowed by the recipe. It definately benefits if served with a raspberry puree and whipped cream or cream anglaise.

This is very much like a flourless chocolate cake. It is very thin and dense. Probably great with a fruit sauce or whipped cream. Easy and delicious.

More bitter than sweet and not a pretty cake. I did not even end up serving it after I made it. I had better luck with the Flourless Chocolate Cake from 1999.
