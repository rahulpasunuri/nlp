I thought it was a bit bland so on my second try I first sauteed 1 large shallot in 2 tbls. of olive oil then added the broth and peas with a tsp. of curry powder.

I use a quicker approach, which works great: I throw frozen peas (still frozen) into food processor with water, buttermilk, boullion granules, and mint. Process well and relax before guests arrive. By the time you're ready to eat, the frozen peas will melt and you'll have a perfect cold soup starter-- no stove required.

This is good as an appetizer. I sprinkled some onion and garlic powder in, added half a chicken boullion cube, a bit more broth and a bit more mint. I think it needs the extra flavor. Pureed for a long time and strained. It's subtle, refreshing, great for summer.

This recipe sounded so easy and good...unfortunately, it did not taste very good. I chilled it and tried it twice...I think the mint and the buttermilk just were not good together. It went down the drain!

Fabulous. All my guests loved it. For serving as appetizer, this recipe makes enough for 3-4. I garnished with a dollop of sour cream and a mint sprig -- really beautiful. Make sure you puree for a long time to get best texture.

I strained it and served it (to myself) in a glass with ice cubes. It was really good, and I drank it all immediately. Next time I'll double the recipe and save some for the next day.
