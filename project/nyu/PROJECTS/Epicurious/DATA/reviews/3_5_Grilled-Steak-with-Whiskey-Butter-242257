This was great! The Whiskey Butter is amazing, yet the recipe makes waaaay tooooo much. We had double the amount of steaks and there is still a lot of butter left. I froze it - not sure if you can do that, but I will take it out at some point and attempt to use it.

This whiskey butter is pretty freaking amazing! It can dress up any grilled steak!

I loved this. I have a hard time getting my wife to eat red meat, so when I make it, it must be fabulous. This was. Easy to make, and absolutely delicious. Have no idea how or why someone said this had no flavor. We used nice filet's,and the butter soaked right in and flavored the meat. I wish I could make this every day. I'd recommend marinating the shallots in whiskey for 30 min before proceeding. I can't get the butter to hold its shape-crumbles, but no biggy. Still tastes amazing. Plenty of leftover butter that I put in the freezer, and used next time.

I wouldn't make this again. I found it had no flavour at all (I followed the recipe to a T) and didn't do anything to enhance the steak.

This Whiskey Butter is amazing!! This recipe was followed exactly as written. I'm not one who eats steak a whole lot, mainly because I get tired of it, but WOW, I think this sauce will make me eat more steak! I plan to try it on shrimp. Yum! this is a keeper!!

This is the best Whiskey Butter ever, I made some before we went camping and used it not only on the Steaks but Chicken and Shrimp, It was a big hit. For the Chicken and Shrimp we BBQ as usual than the last 5 min we took them off and tossed them in the butter and threw them back on for a couple min. Very Yummy.

Great recipe and quite simple to prepare. It doesn't say how long to soak the shallots and it doesn't say to drain them either. I soaked for about 15 minutes and drained the shallots before adding to the butter. As it was, I wasn't able to incorpoate all the liquid into the butter anyway. I made half the recipe for 2 of us and it would have been more than enough for 4. The cooking time for the steaks is too long so don't overgrill if you want medium rare.

Eh. I love me some butter and love me some whiskey, but this combination just didn't work. I say make the shallot butter without the whiskey and mix yourself a perfect Manhattan for a pre-steak dinner cocktail.

Very nice touch to make an average steak dinner into something to be remembered. I made this for a family dinner night and sent my Dad home with a complimentary roll, which was very much appreciated. Thanks!

This was sublime! I decreased the butter to 1 stick and therefore, the salt, to 1/4 tsp. Threw the whole thing together in the food processor, first mincing 2 green onions and the parsley along with the whiskey and seasoning ingredients. Then I just pulsed in the softened butter to blend. Easy and delicious! My husband said it was the best steak he had ever had . . . and we eat a lot of steak. We did use Filet Mignon for health reasons. I served alongside Pinto Beans with Chiles (Epicurious, April 2008) and Spinach, Corn and Roasted Pepper Salad with Chipotle Dressing (Epicurious Nov. 2000). A fabulous Southwestern theme steak dinner.

Pretty darned good and makes a good company dish. I made it the first time with ribeyes, but last night we made it with strip steaks. I usually drain the shallots before blending with the butter because I find it's hard blend. Don't fret...you can still taste the wiskey. I used bourbon last night as it was all I had on hand. VERY good recipe and like others said, save the rest of the butter for another steak later on.

Soaking the shallots really brings out the whiskey flavor in the butter. Simple and really delicious.
