I love these burgers. Sometimes t-burgers can be mushy but not these. I have experimented with their bbq sauce and my favorite bottled sauce-- lip lickin' sauce-- and find the bottle version just as good or better. I also have never had trouble with the burgers not staying together...As so many others have noted, the cole slaw is fantastic and yes, it has become my go-to recipe for cole slaw this summer. I'm making it right now. Yum!

The three forks are for the coleslaw, which is very good and simple. The burgers were inedible, the sauce tasted too harsh, and I ending up throwing everything out.

This has got to be the best turkey burger recipe I ever made! It will definitely be added to our dinner rotation. The coleslaw was delicious too. I did follow other reviewers advice by adding an egg (I used only the eggwhite). I also added a little bit more barbecue sauce to the turkey mixture.

Totally yummy burger and slaw! Only addition I made was adding an egg to the meat. I bbq'd some jalapenos and made a taziki for additional burger toppings. Great flavors.

These burgers are fabulous. I have made them several times this month. I cook them on the stove in my LeCreuset cast iron grill pan, about 5.5 to 6 minutes per side, basting as I cook. DON'T OVERCOOK or they will dry out. My husband who loves W sauce, thinks that the amount is a bit much, so I use less. I also add a beaten egg as suggested. Since there are only two of us, I use less turkey than called for - up to l.5 lbs. using the same amount of ingredients and they are still excellent, and making the full amount of sauce. Don't forget to divide the sauce, 1/2 into the raw turkey mixture and the other half for basting.... it is very important to have sauce left for basting - don't ask me how I know!

Recipe is really tasty as is. Definitely double the sauce and use for basting on the grill and as a condiment for the burgers. I served mine on whole wheat buns with sliced avocado and the slaw on top and got a major thumbs up from all.

I have NEVER made a turkey burger before, but it's likely that this is the first and last one I will ever make again and again and again! The end result, after a couple of tweaks, was a moist, juicy, flavorful burger....not to be compared to any prime beef burger I've ever had....but delicious in its own right. I made the full recipes for the barbecue sauce and cole slaw, but halved the burger recipe and still came up with three good size burgers. To the burger recipe I doubled the bread crumbs and added one half of a red jalapeno pepper, minced, one egg white, and 1/3 cup finely diced Monterrey Jack cheese. I definitely would not grill them without basting with some of the barbecue sauce which made them even more flavorful. Served them open-face on one-half of a toasted Ciabatta roll, drizzled with reserved barbecue sauce and mounded the cole slaw atop. Consider me a turkey burger convert!

I made this last night and it was amazing. I cut the burger recipe in half (there was only 2 of us eating) but made the full BBQ sauce and cole slaw recipe and it was perfect. I used leftover marinated onions from the Fish Tacos recipe on here for the slaw and it gave it a really nice kick. My boyfriend said it was his new favorite meal and asked it I would make it once a week!

I love this recipe, but I have learned to half the Worcestershire sauce and to use low sodium soy sauce. I also now triple the barbecue sauce. I also use 1/2 ground beef and half turkey to keep the burgers from being too dry. The cole slaw is fantastic, I have passed this recipe on to so many people!

Made these for Memorial Day and they were a hit. The slaw is tangy and gives a really nice texture to the burgers. The burgers themselves could use a little more jazzing up with an egg, jalapenos, bread crumbs, ect. Whatever you usually like to put I would add. Will definitely make it again.

Great burgers as the recipe stands. I triple the amounts and freeze the patties for a quick/easy weeknight meal. Agree with others that this slaw is an all-around winner, I use it often; but I usually add more mayo/vinegar/sugar/dijon, as the amounts are they seem light.

These were very yummy-grilled them very slowly and when almost done threw a slice of Provolone on top. Had the sauce slathered on the bun and added sliced red spring onions and a couple sprigs of arugula. Slaw was great as well and my hats off to the person who invented pre-shredded cabbage. Very nice light meal

This reminds me of my mother's meatloaf, which i absolutely hated as a kid. Next time I will omit the worcestershire sauce, use barbecue sauce instead of ketchup, use poultry seasoning instead of chili powder, omit the cumin if using poultry seasoning. Consider omitting the soy sauce, especially if poultry seasoning has sodium. Use FRANKS HOT SAUCE, NOT TTBASCO..it beats tabasco by far. Do not increase that onion, keep it small, mix in cilantro and lemon zest.

I'm just reviewing the Cole Slaw. I didn't make the Burgers. But the cole slaw is really delicious. I made it just to spec, except I grated my onion, not sliced and I added some celery salt (which I think is the secret to awesome cole claw). But it's delicious. Not too creamy, but just enough. Tart, but sweet and zippy. I would recommend whenever making slaw to salt and drain the cabbage first, so it gets some of the water out. Otherwise it gets too watery when sitting.

Best turkey burgers I've ever eaten. I crave them sometimes. Relatively simple to make, and if you want to up the yum factor, use Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I also used less onion as others suggested. They do not taste "barbeque" like you think of bottled red BBQ sauce but really, that shouldn't matter, just think of them as "delicious turkey burgers" and you'll be fine. The cole slaw was also EXCELLENT, the first time I have ever liked cole slaw. However 1 small red onion is wayyy overkill. I've tried it with less and less onion each time, and it seems that about 3 tbsp is just right. A yummy combination, the two items go so well together.

Made these a couple of weeks ago. Turkey burgers were flavorful and moist and the coleslaw was a perfect topping. Instead of shredding my own veggies, I bought a bag of broccoli slaw at the grocery store and used the dressing recipe to finish it up. I also served the burgers on rolls, but I would imagine that the pita would be good, too. Excellent, easy recipe!

My husband and I had no idea that turkey burgers could taste like this. I just mixed the sauce into the burger mixture - no basting, etc. Makes it easier and super moist. Served with an avocado slice on a bun. (Loved the homemade recipe from Rose Levy Berenbaum recently printed in the Wash. Post.) I haven't made the cole slaw yet!

This recipe is very good, the burgers come out moist and no one thought it tasted like a health-conscious recipe at all. The coleslaw was also delcious, but be warned that it makes a huge amount, not proportional to the burgers. I would cut it in half or third it. Otherwise, very good and I would make it again.

These turkey burgers were fabulous! Even my husband (who usually turns up his nose at anything made with ground turkey) ate two of these burgers and said he never would have believed it was turkey because it tasted so good! They were so moist and flavorful(not to mention healthy), and I'm making them tonight for the second time. My husband was upset when he saw that there was more ground turkey in the house, but once I told him I was making these burgers, his face lit up! Thanks for a definite keeper!

I've been making this recipe since 2000 and my family still loves it! We divide the sauce, baste with half and apply the other half to buns with the slaw. Added ketchup at this point does not taste very good (at least to us). A little jack at the last minute on the grill is divine.

Rating: 3
The burger recipe was VERY good!! I was really impressed with how moist and silky textured the burgers came out. I added all of the sauce to the burgers with additional bread crumbs and an egg to help bind it. I did not make the coleslaw. I just can't imagine the burger with the mayonnaisey-coleslaw and then the ketchupy sauce drizzled over it all. Did not sound appetizing to me. Anyway, the burgers will be my standard recipe going forward. Next time I'll try adding some red bell peppes to the burgers too. PS - I usually serve these with an assortment of mayos such as sundried tomato-basil mayo and roasted red pepper mayo. DELISH. To make a VERY simple roasted red pepper mayo, just add a few spoonfuls of "Ajvar" to regular mayo. Ajvar is an Eastern European roasted red pepper spread. It's incredible and is available in most European delis. It's worth finding. Happy BBQ'ing!

Yuck. Unlike other turkey burger haters who were converted into turkey burger lovers by this recipe, I remain unimpressed. I followed suggestions to add 3/4 of the sauce and more bread crumbs to the burgers (a good idea, I think), but the Worcestershire sauce flavor was overwhelming. The cole slaw was good -- it's a pretty standard recipe that I have been making for years (try adding a sprinkling of celery seeds and freshly ground black pepper to the dressing). But the combo of the burger, cole slaw and pita just did not come together, in my opinion. Oh well, the dog was well-fed tonight....

I made this last night and we really enjoyed it. I did add all the sauce to 2 1/2 lbs of turkey, adjusted the bread crumbs. I then made another batch of the sauce for the grilling and serving.

Turkey burgers tend to be bland and dry, so I add *all* of the sauce to the meat and firm it up with additional fresh breadcrumbs. The texture becomes smooth and moist (like very finely ground beef) and the burger is more flavorful. I also reduce the amount of sugar in the coleslaw and double or triple the amount of dijon mustard. When we want turkey burgers, this is the recipe I turn to most.

This recipe for cole slaw is the real deal. Like deli cole slaw only better. I followed another reviewer's advice and used a bit less sugar. Thanks, that was helpful. The only concern I had was making sure that the cabbage was not too dry. I ended up filling a huge bowl with shredded cabbage etc and tripling the sauce recipe. Came out just fine.

Review's based on the burgers only. Thought the flavour and smell of the marinade was good. However, the burgers ended up being too mushy - the texture just wasn't all that good. I used frozen organic turkey and about 3/4 of the sauce in the burger mixture. Maybe a coarser grind on the meat and a tad more breadcrumbs? I have to give this another whirl.

Hadn't tried the burgers yet, but the cole slaw was great, especially if allowed to sit a few hours after mixing. Even those who don't normally eat cole slaw took seconds. Wasn't disappointed when I finally made the burgers. Watch closely to avoid overcooking and dryness. Didn't care for the BQ sauce except as an ingredient and for basting. Accompanied instead with raspberry-chipotle sauce. Outstanding.

Very yummy preparation for bland ground turkey! Our whole family loved it! I opted not to try the coleslaw so my rating is based strictly on the turkey burgers using the marinade listed (one sub... toasted dried minced onion flakes for the raw minced onion). I added 3/4 of the marinade to the ground turkey and saved 1/4 to baste. I also alleviated the "delicate turkey burger falling apart" scenario by PAR-FREEZING the finished burgers for @20 minutes and then taking them out to the hot/oiled grill! Worked like a charm! They wre firm enough for a transfer to the grill and they held together beautifully and no sticking while turning! Definitely a keeper at this house!

I made the coleslaw once, and then came back for the burgers too. I've never made turkey burgers and I was afraid of bland taste, dry meat and "stickage". Turned out they were flavorful, moist, and with a hot grill, turning the patties was not problem. These were so good!! The coleslaw on top is delicious, and so easy to make.

I only gave this three forks because I didn't make the coleslaw - so I can't really rate that part. The burgers are fantastic. Very moist and juicy and without the bland taste of regular ground turkey. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 90% of the sauce to the meat, and simply added extra breadcrumbs to make up for it. I also soaked the breadcrumbs in a tablespoon of milk for extra moisture. I stuffed each burger with maybe an ounce of lowfat cheese, but it would be just as good without. Served on organic multigrain rolls with lettuce. Yum!

I'm not a cole slaw fan, but I made and loved the burgers. Even my husband, who is skeptical of non-beef burgers, put away two with great alacrity.

I had GREAT results with this recipe. I added 90% of the sauce to the meat mix and used the rest to baste. The first words out of my husbands mouth were--"Wow these are really good" and he's a very picky eater. I used all-white turkey meat and didn't have a problem.

This is my go-to turkey burger recipe! I've made this countless times and the result is always delicious. As others have said, I simply add all the sauce to the turkey meat and I've never had an issue with the burgers falling apart on the grill.

Definitely try it- even if you think you don't like turkey burgers you may be pleasantly surprised!

I followed the other reviewers and used half the sauce and the burgers turned out okay. However, I made the mistake of using extra lean ground turkey, thinking that the mixed ingrediances would add moisture. Although they did to a certain extent, the burgers were still a bit dry and card-board tasting. However, I blame that on the meat (and not the cook or recipe). I'll try again.

I liked the burgers -- but if you don't have a lot of the ingredients handy -- go for the easier burger recipe "Turkey Burgers with Chipolte-Chili Tartar Sauce". The sauce in that recipe is delish and it pairs well with even plain burgers. I would use fewer breadcrumbs in this recipe, but I would make it again.

This was really great, although I did make some modifications, many of which other reviewers suggested. I agree that the original recipe had too much onions and I used 1/4 cup in the burgers and two green onions in the cole slaw. Also, although I loved the taste of the bbq sauce in and basted on the burgers, I didn't really like it drizzled on the cooked burgers. Therefore, I topped the burgers with El Paso Chile co.'s Chipotle Honey Orange BBQ Sauce, a sweet and spicy concoction that was great. I also used regular hamburger buns instead of pita. With these changes, this was fantastic comfort food!

WOW! I was just looking for a slaw recipe for my home-sick American boyfriend, but after reading all the reviews, I just had to try the burgers too. I used chicken thighs and ground them myself --as turkey is not so common in Sweden-- and I added all the sauce to the meat. Absolutely FABULOUS!!! Best burgers ever, even better than traditional beef-burgers. The coleslaw was good too, although I'd cut back on the onions next time. I'll make this again and again, and thank's everyone for all the useful suggestions!

We anxiously wait for summer to arrive, so we can get out this recipe. Love it and make it more often than beef burgers. I don't make the cole slaw, just whip up my own with red and white cabbage and Marzetti's Lite Cole Slaw dressing. We also use plain hamburger buns as getting the burgers into the pitas didn't work very well. Also, make sure to double the amount of sauce, as it too is delicious. On the side I stir fry some sugar snap peas from the local farmer's market with a little sesame oil and almonds. Summer at it's finest!

I didn't make the cole slaw-just the burgers, which were terrific. After reading other reviews, I used half of the sauce in the burgers and the other half to baste while grilling.

I've made these several times now to rave reviews - I usually take the advice of adding all the sauce to the meat - which makes it very flavorful but the burgers tend to fall apart more, so next time I'll try the 3/8 cup suggestion and see if they hold together better. The coleslaw was just ok though... not necessarily a keeper.

I didn't make the turkey burgers, just looking for a decent slaw. This is good. I used green onions instead of red and added a hint of fresh garlic to the dressing and some chopped fresh cilantro becuase it was there. I never add sugar to slaw. It makes me sad and mindful of family reunions and funerals where everyone tries to make up for a lifetime of everything by making all the salads too sweet. This is a good cole slaw recipe.

Not a big fan of turkey burgers, but I guess if you have to eat them, this is the recipe to use. Agree with the other reviewers, WAY TOO MUCH ONION in both burgers AND slaw.

This a great recipe. I would cut down on the amount of onions added to the turkey. Adding just a 1/4 cup of minced onions would be just fine. The marinade is great for chicken breast and hamburgers too. Eliminate the chili powder if serving this to children - tends to be spicy. The cole slaw recipe is the best I have made and can be made up to 3 days in advance and still taste fresh.

My husband and I loved these burgers. I put all the sauce into the burgers, as others have done, and used extra garlic. The burgers had a wonderful flavor. Even people who don't like turkey burgers (instead of hamburgers) should enjoy this recipe.

My husband and I are so fond of this recipe for turkey burgers that we have been feasting on them about once a week for the past two years. I usually quadruple the recipe so there are always plenty of burgers to pull out of the freezer at the last minute. The sauce really makes the burgers! In a pinch I have substituted purchased BBQ sauce and the burgers are just not the same. I usually end up playing around with the cole slaw recipe (adding more vinegar and mustard), as I'm not a big fan of mayonnaise. I prefer hamburger buns to the pita. I've shared the burger and slaw recipes with so many people I can't keep track. Thanks for providing me with another "hit" from epicurious.com!

This recipe is twice as good as the turkey burger recipe I usually use! I mean, it's REALLY good! I added some smoked gouda, then served them on whole grain buns instead of pita (easier for my kids to manage that way). I broiled them on High for about four minutes a side (about 5" from heat source). The sauce and the slaw are both delicious. A keeper for sure!

This is a very easy recipe and it is very tastey too. I would make this again. It was too cold to grill the burgers last night so I cooked them under the broiler. I can't wait for spring because they will be even better on the grill.

This is a delicious recipe. I too added all the "basting" ingredients into the turkey mixture. Instead of pita, I served the burgers on toasted onion rolls. The slaw is a must!

This is the best turkey burger recipe I've come across. Fortunately, the first time I made it, I didn't read the "Make burgers" part ahead of time, only the "For burgers" and mixed all of the ingredients into the ground turkey - turned out so great that I've made it this way ever since. Also, used package shredded cole slaw mix with a favorite bottled dressing (to save time) and served them on regular hamburger buns (family isn't fond of pita).

This turkey burger is the best.

Ground Turkey has played a big part of my life, for the last 5 years. I really enjoyed the recipe and my family also. It's refreshing to know that are some that have discovered ground turkey and other turkey products.

Loved the sauce, but the flavor did not carry into the burgers, think I will add it all before cooking next time. Recipe made nice, big 1/3 pounders for big buns. A must repeat!

I know, I know. Turkey burgers are boring. We SHOULD eat them, but don't really WANT to eat them. Give this tasty version a try. No more difficult than beef burgers (easy)to prepare, excellent flavor and good for you as long as you go easy on the cole slaw (a must-have for these burgers). Pitas fall apart! Use toated buns or kaiser rolls instead.
