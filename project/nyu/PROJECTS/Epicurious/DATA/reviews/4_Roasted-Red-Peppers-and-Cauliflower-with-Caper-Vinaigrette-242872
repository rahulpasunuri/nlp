This was great! Thanks to those who posted the rest of the recipe, i.e. the red pepper instructions. I also used much less olive oil than called for. My husband and 16-year-old son both loved it. Will definitely make again - good combo of easy, delicious, and healthy.

I read the reviews because I was puzzled about the pepper omission and so glad I did because the recipe really called for way too much oil. I took one of the reviewers recommendations and just tossed my one head of cauliflower and one red pepper in 1 tablespoon of oil. I also cut back on the capers. I thought it was a delicious, easy dish fit for company.

Did anyone bother to proof read this recipe? It doesn't say what temperature to set the oven. The red bell peppers are mentioned nowhere. I'm sure it will taste just fine after I fill in the blanks, but most people expect a recipe that doesn't leave out steps or ingredients.

This dish is great to take to a potluck gathering and has been a hit everytime. However, you do need to roast the red peppers, as noted this was an incomplete receipe. I roast the peppers and cauliflower separately. If you love capers, you will love this.

Even using the reviewer suggestions, this dish was awful!

BE SURE to get the rest of the recipe from the early reviews! This recipe is not complete! Come on Epicurious.. 18 months and you can't make the correction? WAY too much olive oil as written...I took others advice and cut it way back, taking extra time to toss the cauliflower a zillion times to coat it with a miniscule amount. I also cut it back in the "vinaigrette" to a single Tbsp, and used the juices from the red peppers I roasted whole, then peeled and diced. With those changes, it was a very, very nice side dish. It still had all the nutty roasted cauliflower flavor, and the lemon juice freshened the flavors and made them pop, sans drowning in olive oil. It's staying in my arsenal, but with changes.

This just wasn't that good. The capers and the red peppers totally over powered the cauliflower. I also agree with the others that the recipe calls for way too much oil.

Yummy. Cut cauliflower and red pepper and placed single layer in two casserole dishes. Baked at 450 for 15 minutes then broiled until edges of cauliflower were brown. Added lemon/EVOO/Caper per recipe to one casserole and S.A.F.R. Port Salud (semi-soft) cheese to the other and melted that one in the oven for a few minutes. Both dishes were great! Easy way to make two different tastes for the same effort.

Outstanding dish. Very nice presentation of cauliflower and so simple.

Not sure whether I really loved it at room temperature. I think the next time I make it -- and there will most definitely be a next time -- I'll warm it up. Also, 4 of us polished it off as a side dish. I don't see how it could ever be for 12.

Looking @ the recipe I knew it would be too oily and bland for us.I also halved the amount of cauliflower & peppers. So in a large mixing bowl 1 put in 1 tablespoon evoo and 1 tsp. Greek seasoning,1/4 tsp. Italian seasoning. I also washed & sliced a leel which I added to the cauliflower & red peppers. I tossed this in the seasoned oil before placing on baking sheet.

This is a lovely way to serve cauliflower. I cut down on the amount of olive oil and used roasted piquillo peppers from a jar. It made a nice accompaniment to baked sea bass with saffron and tomatoes and a crunchy green salad.

I made this without the capers, and it wasn't anything great at all. Way too much oil added at the end, and not much flavor.

Delicious! I cut the recipe in half and it worked great, with a much more reasonable portion. I served it as a vegetarian main course.

We made this recipe recently to try and expand the veggies our young kids eat. Both kids loved it and asked when we could have it again. Be sure and get the missing intro to the recipe from the other reviews. Enjoy!

This was a great, easy way to get out of the winter steamed vegetable blahs. I made it last week and my husband was skeptical at first but one taste was all it took. He's been after me to make it again ever since.

Easy and delicious and if you're strapped for time, you could always use jarred roasted peppers. Thanks to the previous reviewer who posted the missing part of the recipe!!

Yum! Delish! Roast the bell peppers with the cauliflower together. Try using less oil.

This is a really easy way to use cauliflower and it's very versatile. I've made it probably about 10 times now. Follow the recipe for a more spanish feel, or add some oregano/basil for a greek or italian feel. Use purple cauliflower to combine for major color on the plate with the red peppers.

The following is the beinning of the recipe as presented in the July 2008 issue of Gourmet (which is missing in the receipe as given on this site): "Preheat broiler. Quarter bell peppers lengthwise and discard stems, seeds, and ribs. Broil peppers, skin sides up, on a broiler pan about 2 incehse from heat until skins are blistered, 8 to 12 minutes. (Alternatively, roast whole peppers on their sides on racks of gas burners on high, turning with tongs, until skins are blackened, 5 to 8 minutes.) Transfer to a bowl and let stand, covered, 10 minutes. While peppers stand, preheat oven to 450 degrees with racks in upper and lower thirds. Peel peppers and cut each quarter lengthwise into 2 or 3 strips." Susan

This recipe is missing a few key things! No oven temp is given. There are no directions that say what to do with the red peppers. Are they roasted too? Separately, or with the cauliflower? Whole, or sliced? Seeded?

Excellent and easy. My familiy prefers the cauliflower softer, so I blanched it for five minutes prior putting it in the oven. Have made it twice so far and it turn out great both times.

Very tasty! Used yellow and green instead of red b/c thats what I had on hand. Halved the recipe and worked out great. Used 1/2 a lemon.
