Great meal, and fast. I used an extra anchovy and extra garlic clove. I enjoy less pasta-driven pasta, and found that 3/4lb pasta was just right for this amount of escarole.

This was delicious! I accidentally dumped about 1 teaspoon of dried crushed red pepper so it was a bit on the spicier side but I added 2 extra anchovies and it was perfectly balanced. I think a bit of lemon juice squeezed at the end would be a great addition.

This was really yummy and easy. I added white beans and used walnuts instead of cheese. Simple and delicious. I might add some fresh tomatoes next time.

This was a tasty weeknight supper. I substituted anchovy paste (1/2 tsp. per fillet). It was good with melon and prosciutto as a side dish; the color and sweetness were nice complements.

Good, not great.Would make it again, though. Used chicken broth instead of water to add more flavor. Tried mixing with cannellini beans for healthier option. Drizzle w/a little EVOO before serving.
