These were a hit at a neighborhood potluck and got eaten quickly. I did not soak the tomatoes and olives - just diced them up. I figured the oil from the tomatoes might help hold it all together on top, plus who doesn't love olive oil? I made them in the morning and the toasts re-hydrated a bit by dinner time. Next time, I'll keep them in the oven longer to get crisper. Agree with another reviewer that quality ingredients matter. Buy the best olives and tomatoes you can find.

This recipe was simple to make, visually appealing, AND delicious. (I served this as one of the appetizers on Christmas Eve to rave reviews from all.) The key here is really good ingredients because there is such a wide range of quality available in all of the main items - the sun-dried tomatoes, especially, as well as the kalamata olives, and pesto. (That might account for some reviewers finding the recipe too salty.) For this recipe you'll do better going to a high end specialty food store instead of the grocery store.

this was ok....I would suggest using some puff pastry instead of bread...just cut sheet into squares, brush with egg wash and top with the same toppings. Then just bake according to the box.

Good appetizer, extremely easy to make. Very salty. Many people asked me "what exactly is that?" before eating. Appetizer topping was hard to identify.
