I would say that this is a very good cake. However if you don't have a good amount of time I wouldn't do it and if you are looking for a quick and easy cake then this is not the cake for you. But if you have that time and experience than I would definitely give it a shot.

I made this for Christmas Eve. It was exceptional. I agree with other bakers that the cake was a little lighter than the photo but it tasted fine. We used McConnell's Peppermint Ice Cream and it was just perfect. My cake did start to crack after I put the ice cream in it, but I just rolled it up and put it in the freezer overnight and after putting the meringue on it you never would have known. It also gave me an excuse to buy a kitchen torch at Sur La Table which I have always wanted. It was a complete success in all ways. I would consider making a chocolate genoise from The Cake Bible next time as an experiment to see whether I liked it better, but overall, this was a hit just as is.

In the end, my family said it was delicious - which it was, because of the combination of peppermint ice cream and chocolate sauce. But I could have made brownies with ice cream & chocolate sauce and had the same flavors (and more chocolatey flavor) and saved a lot of work. This should have been all about presentation, but like other reviewers I found the cake (prepped and baked exactly as directed) impossible to roll. It cracked like crazy, the ice cream slid around, and it finally came out as a rolled rectangle. Luckily the meringue layer hid a lot and it looked pretty with garnishes, but I will do a traditional buche de Noel with buttercream filling next time.

After reading the first reviews of this recipe I was a bit skeptical! But I was determined to try it anyway. The cake was okay, pale in color and not a whole lot of flavor. I baked it 2 minutes less as previously suggested. I probably had the ice cream a little too soft so the end result was not quite round.....The overall taste and time it took to make this was definitly not worth it.....Make a Baked Alaska... much easier

The cake was beautiful and my family was very impressed. The chocolate cake was a bit dry, but I probably over baked it. It tasted very good especially with warm chocolate sauce on top! Who doesn't like cake and ice cream?

A terrible recipe. Although the cake has an ok flavor it doesn't roll well and is very hard to manage. There are many other better "Buche" recipes on this site.

I've decided to make this cake so I can do ahead and place in freezer until the 25th. So far, the cake came out light colored as others have stated, but it tastes good. I used turkey hill peppermint chocolate chunk ice cream, and it was just the right amount to fill the cake. I have yet to frost it. we shall see about the next step...Maybe I'll add some extra flavor to the meringue to avoid the blah flavor

It was pretty but it didn't have much taste. The cake does not turn out nearly as dark as the picture indicates and has very little chocolate flavor. I used Haagen-dasz holikday st chocolate and peppermint bark ice cream, which was good. The meringue was pretty but contributed little tast. There are better buche de noel recipes out there!

I have made buche noel before and my family has always loved this holiday treat. I thought I would try the ice cream version for something new. Big mistake! This cake did not come together well at all and tasted blah! too. The first set of ingredients were very stiff and thick and it was near impossible to "fold in the first set of egg whites and so I ended up forcing the mixture together. I was able to fold in the second amount of egg white and thought the cake might be okay but noticed it was a very light color and not chocolate looking at all. I baked the cake according to directions and took it out of the oven at 12 minutes. This was too long! The cake was way over baked and the cooking time should have been closer to 10 minutes. I cooled the cake according to the recipe and as I have done with other buche noel cakes, I have made, I wrapped it in the dusted towel. Warm it rolled well. However, after it cooled and I unrolled it to put in the ice cream it began to crack everywhere. This was probably due to the overcooking but the cake was not spongy enough either. I also needed to have more than 2 pints of ice cream. It was not enough. I went through, rolled it anyway, wrapped it, and froze it cracks and all. The next day I before I bothered to take the time to frost with meringue I cut off an end and tried it. Not good! The cake had the texture and taste of cardboard and had no depth of chocolate. I will be making something else for my dinner party this weekend! As I am the first review, I am curious to know others experience. Cheers!
