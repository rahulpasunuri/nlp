I've been making this for years. I served it to guests last night and everyone wanted the recipe. It's so good and one of the easiest for entertaining, since you can prepare the chicken ahead of time, throw it in the oven when your guests arrive and serve cocktails while it's roasting. Serve it with simple mashed potatoes and a simple spinach salad with lemon vinaigrette. Terrific!

One of my favorites. So fast and easy. The chicken is so moist with a little kick.

If you use breast or thighs it may work better. I use cream of mushroom and jalapenos and it's great! I agree w/ SmartCookie though, this isn't a recipe just common sense.

Edible but nothing to write home about. It doesn't really take a recipe to add lemons and onion to a baked chicken - that's just common sense. I expect recipes to really add something new. Guess the "novel twist" is supposed to be the jalapenos, but I think it comes out better when you use herbs, like rosemary or thyme, instead.

I LOVE this chicken recipe. I've been making it since it first appeared in the magazine. The spice level is perfect -- just a little "zing". Like a previous reviewer, I try to insert the jalapeno slices under as much of the chicken skin as possible. Buy the biggest, fattest bird you can find (my favorite is Rocky organic) and have a feast. The leftovers are fantastic, too.

I love roast chicken. I felt like it would be nice to try a different recipe than normal, so I tried this one. Very nice variation - especially if you like spicy food. I think the instruction are a little odd though. Next time I would make sure that the jalapeno slices are placed evenly around the bird (under its skin) so that all the parts are equally spicy. I also prefer to roast a chicken with the breast down, since that helps it keep it from getting dry.

Delicious. Very moist. The jalapenos add a great zing.

I did the recipe as instructed and roasted it in my set and forget Ronco rotiserrie. Yummy. Nice and moist
