I was disappointed with this recipe. First of all, the puff pastry stuck to the pans even though I followed the directions precisely. Should've lined the pans with parchment. Because the puff pastry was flattened and covered with caramelized sugar, it was very hard to cut (to eat) with just a fork. Also, I felt the orange overwhelmed the taste of the rhubarb and the sauce was runnier than I would've liked.. All in all, only so-so.

This recipe is delicious. Very easy to make. Maybe it was the brand of frozen puff pastry that I bought, but the cooking time for them in the recipe was way off. I burnt the first set of pastries following the time in the recipe. I cooked mine for 5 1/2 minutes.Pressed down and then cooked them for another 5 minutes and they were perfect. We will be serving them again next week to a wine and food group that we belong to.
