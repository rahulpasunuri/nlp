I thought the flavor of this stew was good but I didn't like the texture of the potatoes. I would roast the potatoes separately and add them to the stew when serving.

I've made something like this before and it was amazing. I followed the cooking times on this and even cooked it on a slightly lower flame than directed. It turned into mush. I might give it another shot, but not soon at this cost.

This is a fantastic dish. Flavourful, comforting, a bit unusual with the use of the apples, straight forward to make. Really really good. Two observations - go light on the sage and the pork shoulder is time consuming to cut up and trim.

Tender and flavorful! I was a little short on time so I skipped the first hour of cooking and just added the potatoes then simmered for an hour. The meat was still very tender. To make it thicken I needed to add more flour than the recipe called for. Serve with a hearty sourdough loaf and you have a hearty and delicious meal!

Excellent. Perfect. Delicious.

Great fall stew! It takes a long time to make it, but stews usually take awhile. And most of the time is the stew cooking and you doing nothing with it. It was really good! The apples were soft and added a subtle flavor to the dish. The pork was tender and soaked in the apple flavor. I would suggest making sure you add the Calvados or Applejack as it gives it a boost of flavor. Also, we ate it with bread to dip in the juices, and you could really taste the apple flavor! Yum yum!

Yummie - Next time I would use chopped onions instead of pearl and would use less apple and chop them instead of cube. No one in my family really loved the apple chunks - otherwise very tasty.

Delicious! Thick and hearty just as a stew should be. I'm in love!

Made this for my hubbies Birthday during a blizzard. I used chopped onion in place of pearl onions, but made according to recipe other than that. This was simply amazing! It is sweet with the apples and Calvados, but the savory sage and mustard are a perfect counter balance. I am still dreaming of this stew months after making it, can't wait for the fall to make it again! Yum!

I agree with the person who previously posted that Lairds Applejack{much cheaper} is a great substitution for Calvados {expensive.} Last year I made a pie that called for Calvados, when I went to the liquor store to buy some the man helping me steered me to the Lairds Apple Jack and told me its just as good as Calvados. He then showed me the Calvados and it's price. Nice employee! Good for customers but not his bosses profits!! Also, to the person who wondered why that other reviewer repeated their post so many times, the same thing has happened to me in the past. My computer didn't look like it was working so I hit the submit button several times which unfortunately resulted in numerous unnecessary posts. I will rate and review this recipe after I try it. I couldn't resist putting in my two cents about the Laird and Calvados!

Right so it was good, and I really liked the flavor, but i just can't help but thinking that the receipt may have a couple of fundamental flaws to it. I mean when I see a receipt like this I instantly think of Julie Child's Beef Burguignone. If you are already going to spend 3 hours making it why not take the couple extra steps to really do it right. Most notably I would definitely braise the pearl onions in stock and butter separate from the stew and add them at the very end. I found the onions to have a somewhat apart flavor that really didn't jive with the lovely flavor of the other pieces of juicy meat and potatoes. I also thought the buerre manie was the wrong approach to the thickening of the stew. I think following Mrs. Child's receipt would be the better route or simply cook the stew another 30 minutes to allow the potato to break down a little more and lend its starch to the liquid. And my final comment is that the whole thing made no sense to my taste buds until I took a swig of cider, and i found clarity of purpose. It goes without saying that finding the right Cider is all important, as far too many are just alcoholic apple juice. I like Samuel Smith's Organic Cider.

Time consuming, but sooooo worth it. What a wonderful flavor, even if you play around a little with the vegetable ratios. Best of all, gives you a great excuse to consume a that extra hard cider whilst you cook!

We loved this! I did not find it too sweet at all. Great flavor with a lot of depth and it was something a little different. Will definitely make again.

This was a very time consuming recipe as are all soups and stews. It was definitely worth the effort. My family raved about the flavor. Perhaps those who were disappointed used purchased stock. I used homemade and as always, I believe it makes a huge difference in the depth of flavor. The only other significant changes were to use minced sweet onions instead of pearl,to make a roux of the butter and flour before adding it at the end. Oh and I completely forgot to add the mustard at the end. I plan to do so next time. I did not use pork shoulder. I substituted pork loin roast as we're watching our fat intake.

This was a huge hit with my dinner club. I recommend making it the day before serving, as it reheats well.

A perfect winter stew. I made this on a Saturday afternoon for a Sunday dinner and I highly recommend the extra day to let the flavors meld. I'm crazy about the pork, parsnip, hard cider combination. It's definitely sweeter than, say, a beef burgundy, but that makes it refreshing and interesting.

I felt there was something wrong with this dish. My main complaint would be that it is too sweet--I think the hard cider is overly sweet, and added to that you have the sweetness of apples and parsnips. Also it is quite difficult to avoid the ingredients becoming mushy. I would have left out the potatoes so I could serve the dish over noodles or rice. That would help with the sweetness issue. However, I won't make this again. (I did use real onions and Calvados, but dried sage).

Delicious! I used two yellow onions chopped very rough in place of the pearl onions to save a little $. I also left out the calvados, but it was still awesome. served it to three friends and they all loved it.

Just spent 3+ hours making this, followed exactly except used one large chopped yellow onion instead of pearl onions (I detest) and added w/ shallots/parsnips. I was expecting layers of flavor but all I got was sweet, will try the leftovers tomorrow-maybe better then?

This was a wonderful stew for a cold Saturday night. I followed the recipe exactly - used frozen pearl onions as suggested by others. Love calvados and have it on hand; it was perfect in this stew. It did take 3 hours to make but worth the effort. Added the apples a little later so they didn't cook as long and get too mushy and used a little extra broth to thin a little bit. This one is a keeper.

Really good, and even better as leftovers the next day. Made as recipe dictates (including Calvados, you only need a bit and there are plenty of other recipes to use it in if you're not going to drink it) and it had a great flavor-- not too sweet at all. I did have to add additional broth during the parsnip phase to prevent them from burning, and later during the flour phase because it was thick thick thick.

To t he cook from TriCities, WA--Why did you repeat the same review 6 TIMES!!! Once was enough!!! I am making it this weekend as we are expecting a giant storm AGAIN. I'm sure it will be wonderful. I'm just a little concerned that it will be too sweet as we like our food less sweet than most.

This was definitely a 4 forks recipe. Thanks to all the reviewers who sang its praise. It was absolutely delicious. Agree that it was a lot of work and expensive, but well worth it. We loved the mix of sweet and smokey. I usually hate smoked food, but the flavors blended together beautifully and the smokiness was quite mellow. I did everything the recipe said, except like other reviewers, I used frozen onions. That certainly eased the work load. The sauce might need a bit of thinning (more Calvados? water? broth?)tonight when we dig in for left overs.

Excellent. Made as directed except for one exception: used frozen pearl onions instead of fresh.

I expected to be knocked out by this stew on the basis of the posted reviews. I was definitely not. What really did knock me out was how expensive it was to make! By the time I purchased the pearl onions, parsnips, fresh sage, and imported cider, I had way more invested than I expected. For the price I could have made something really spectacular. This was not it!

This was wonderful! I made it last night, and I'm serving it to guests tonight and hoping that, like most stews, it'll be even better the second night. I followed the recipe exactly, except I had to use dried sage. Really excellent!

Really nice! I stuck to the recipe, even the Calvados ($$ouch$$). As someone else warned, this turned into a 3 hour effort, but it was worth it. I would have only given it 3 1/2 forks if I could as it was a little sweet for my pallette. I'll be more careful about the apple cooking time and chop size next time because they really melted away to nothing very fast. Now its time for some Calvados truffles!!

The meat turned out incredibly tender and delicious. There weren't any parsnips at the grocery store, so I substituted carrots. I also did not add the Calvados. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a tee. The pearl onions were a HUGE let down. Their texture was very slimy and the flavor of them was not that great. The pearl onions were also very awkward to try to eat as everything else I chopped up was bite size. The apples also didn't seem to add much to the dish except a mushy filler. I don't think their flavor contributed much because the hard apple cider is very strong. Finally, the Dijon mustard's sweetness is intensified by the hot stew which I did not like at all. What I wanted was a savory dish and all I tasted was sweetness. I could be wrong about where the sweetness was coming from, but it didn't satiate my palette. Oh, and I spent 3.5 hours making this. If I were to make it again, I would omit the dijon mustard or maybe choose a mustard with no sweetness. I would also, 100% omit the pearl onions.

Wonderful stew. Laird's applejack is a good substitute for Calvados.

No surprise that nearly every reviewer skipped the Calvados. It's hard to find and FAR too expensive to pour into a stew. Will try apple schnapps or similar and report back.

I did use Cognac instead of Calvados, since I didn't have Calvados, but that was the only change. It's a perfect winter stew. The parsnips sort of melt into it, and along with the apple, add a sweetness that's wonderful against the tanginess of the mustard. I wouldn't change a thing!

Made this last night, didnt look at the timing well enough so it was eaten a little later in the night, however incredible tastes. I used some brandy (not calvados) at the front end and then added some irish whiskey at the back end to give it a little punch. Texturally it is a little similar the entire time, I added some grilled peasant bread and a little chopped shallots after the first bowl...
