Great alongside Italian chicken sausage and risotto. I added bread crumbs and goat cheese to the tomatoes before putting them in the oven. Bake time was under 20 minutes.

Really liked the taste - I also added bread crumbs and romano cheese. I found the baking time in the recipe to be far too long - 20 minutes would have been perfect.

Excellent recipe! I followed the other recommendations and added bread crumbs and parmesian cheese. I didn't have fresh basil, so I added dried basil mixed with fresh parsley. Delicious.

I added bread crumbs to the garlic/herb mixture. Drizzled olive oil over and baked. Served it with the Stuffed Zucchini recipe (Little Italy) on this site and it was great. It's a good way to use up lots of garden tomatoes.

A wonderful accompaniment to grilled salmon fillets with creamy horseradish sauce (also on epicurious). Great flavor - make sure you use a quality extra virgin olive oil! I topped the tomatoes with crumbles of feta cheese. A real popular dish with my husband and our friends!

Excellent light dish. I agree with previous cooks about adding pinenuts to the mixture and goat cheese to the top at the end. I also added a few breadcrumbs from pita bread to the mixture give it some extra thinkness. Great, easy recipe.

Simple and totally delicious. I used the last of the summer tomatoes and parsley. I also added a few pinenuts to the mixture based on one of the previous comments.

I used tomatoes from the garden and added a table spoon or so of Feta Cheese to the basil mix. It was really wonderful.

These were a great side dish to a very rich main course that was heavy in dairy. they added an acidic quality to the meal that was a great balance to the creamy/cheesy polenta that they accompanied.

Wonderful!! I also added some parmesean cheese and some pine nuts to the processor. Very easy and great taste. Wonderful with lamb.
