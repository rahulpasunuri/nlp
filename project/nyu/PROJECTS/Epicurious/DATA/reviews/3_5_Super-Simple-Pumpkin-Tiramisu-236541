We were served this dessert at a party, and were immediately smitten. I've certainly had more decadent Tiramisu's ingredient wise, and this is what wowed us regarding this particular incarnation. It was light and rich at the same time! Ended up having seconds, and when I prepared the dessert myself, I created 6 individual "trifles". A keeper of a recipe, for sure.

I really liked this recipe and so did my guests. Some small changes were crisping up the lady fingers before brushing them with Frangelico, accidentally whipping up 2 cups of whipping cream and adding to the mascarpone pumpkin mixture and crushing up ginger snaps and adding in between each layer and on top. It came out of the springform pan beautifully and looked very elegant on the plate. The taste was luscious and light, like a mousse. I didn't find that I needed to add gelatin per some previous reviews--perhaps because I beat the whipping cream to stiff peaks. I did double the spices and found that to be a good thing. I liked it so much I will be making for Thanksgiving!

P.S. Doubled the amount of kahula. Oh, and to the rude, arrogant cook from Irvine...you obviously think you're a stellar cook. Makes a lot of us look like we're beginning cooks.

Yummy! I took this to our gourmet dinner group last night and it was the hit of the evening. Everyone asked for the recipe. It was truly super-simple...think it took all of 20 minutes to assemble. I used kahlua rather than rum, doubled the spices, and used 1 pkg unflavored gelatin, per previous reviews. I used finely chopped pecans to garnish the top (did not candy) as the tiramisu seemed to be sweet enough. I can't wait to make this for Thanksgiving...a real keeper.

I thought this was very interesting with Thanksgiving right around the corner.. I am not into Pumpkin Pie and I thought since I am Italian Tiramisu is right up my alley... THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME!!!!! Pretty much followed everything except I used DiSaronno on my lady fingers and used fresh Nutmeg.... Turned out incredible... Going to make it again and try to freeze it...

I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it! It also looked so beautiful. I changed a couple of things: first i sprinkled the ladyfingers with coffee and added the brandy to the custard instead. Also, instead of using amarettis i used gingersnaps.

This was a delicious recipe. I used the Grand Marnier and heath bars, as suggested by another reviewer, but the pumpkin whip never set up. I think this would have done better as a trifle, maybe put it together when serving rather than trying to set it in the fridge as a stack. The flavor was really good, though, and it was nice and fluffy, so I will probably make again, with a couple tweeks...

I was excited to find this recipe as I was looking for a lighter pumpkin flavored recipe for Thanksgiving. I thought this was nice but not a WOW! kind of dessert that I usually try to serve at gatherings. I subsituted hazelnut liquer for the rum which was nice and subtle and did not overpower the pumpkin flavor. I made 2 cups of whipped cream and added vanilla. I added 1/2 of this to the pumpkin mixture which I mixed first and then layered the pumpkin, whipped cream and lady fingers. I also topped with candied pecans and a crunched up heat bar which gave it a nice flavorful crunch on top. A nice dessert, but I will probably try to find something else for next year.

This was a beautiful presentation and easy to make. It was delicious in spite of me being absent minded and forgetting some ingredients. I somehow forgot the mascarpone cheese then also forgot to paint the second layer of lady fingers with rum. Only when I was putting the final touches on did I realize what happened. I almost tossed it out in frustration but decided that the concoction sure tasted good going in, and was standing up fairly well so I tossed the finished product in the refrigerator and went to bed. To my surprise it looked great and I took it to the office anyway. Everyone raved about it, and it actually served out light and fluffy and more like a mousse. No one knew the difference and assumed it was just that. I am going to make another one, but correct next time.

Made this last night in preparation for tonight's Thanksgiving dinner. I followed the suggestions by other reviewers as follows: added 2 packages gelatin to the mixture, doubled the spices, altered the topping to include crushed Heath candy bars and candied pecans, and lined the springform pan all around with parchment paper. I also exchanged the rum for Kahlua. The results were fantastic: smooth, creamy pumpkin-cream sandwiched between featherlight ladyfinger layers. I received rave reviews for the dessert. The only things I would do differently next time: maybe change the gelatin to one package [the texture was a bit too firm for my liking (too reminiscent of pumpkin pie filling)], and increase the amount of Kahlua because the ladyfingers were not as soaked with flavor as I would have hoped. I will definitely add this to my Holiday dessert list.

FABULOUS - with the following changes: Doubled the spices as suggested by many reviews. Used Grand Marnier instead of rum, brushed on the ladyfingers with a pastry brush. Used 2 Heath Bars mixed with 1/2 cup chopped candied pecans for the topping. ** I ADDED 2 packets of gelatin (first dissolve in 1/4 cup cold water, then dissolve mass in 1/4 cup boiling water), and add to pumpkin/cheese in mixer. I lined the spring form pan with parchment, and the presentation was perfect. Make it the Morning of the day before the party - it needs time for the flavors to meld. It's lighter than traditional pumpkin pie, and I'm adding it to my Thanksgiving traditions!

Imaginative use of pumpkin. And this is a wonderful light creamy cool dessert. Some suggestions - some people may prefer to cook the pumpkin with the spices in the microwave for about 5 mimutes and let cool before mixing the filling. Or to buy the pumpkin pie filling instead of plain pumpkin. Also using powdered sugar instead of granulated and making sure the filling is well beaten together before folding in the whipped cream. Maybe line the sides of the pan with ladyfingers if you like more cake. Lastly, why not use half espresso spiked with rum or extract of your choice, or coffee liquer to soften the hard ladyfingers? ..... Finely crushed ginger cookies is a decent substitute. :-)

WOW...I THOUGHT THIS RECIPE UP IN MY HEAD ...AT LEAST I THOUGHT I DID!...ALMOST IDENTICAL!!!! I WAS CONFLICTED ABOUT CALLING IT TIRAMISU SINCE NO CHOCOLATE AND NO COFFEE! BUT I USE GINGER COOKIES AND FRANGELICO. ON TOP I PUT CHOPPED HAZELNUTS TO GIVE IT CRUNCH AND DEPTH OF FLAVOR. ALSO, A LITTLE VANILLA EXTRACT IN THE PUMPKIN MIX. I DO NOT MIX ALL THE WHIPPED CREAM, ONLY ABOUT A CUP (JUST TO LIGHTEN UP). THEN I LAYER COOKIES SPRINKLED WITH FRANG/PUMPKIN AND THEN WHIP/ 2 LAYERS EACH ENDING WITH CREAM AND CHOPPED NUTS.

The pumpkin puree seemed to have a raw flavor to it. I wonder if I can simmer it with spices before hand to get more of a pumpkin pie flavor out of it. I used bailey's instead of rum, and I made it as a trifle. I covered the top with whipped cream and sprinkled with cinammon. I didn't like it so much myself but our guests said it was good. If I make it again it would be with major changes.

typo...I meant 1/3 cup of liquid, not 2/3 in my review. Sorry!

I read the reviews prior to making this and decided on these changes beforehand: - almost doubled the cheese - doubled the spices - used 2/3 cup liquid brushed onto the cookies made up of orange rind, rum, orange liquer and cinnimmon. Most of the crowd liked it but the consensus was that it needed more spice and more sugar. I would make this again but will use 1 cup of sugar and up the spices again.

I am convinced there's a mistake in this recipe. Make it as is, and it's vile. V-I-L-E. I more than quadrupled the amount of pumpkin pie spice, and when I ran out I threw in some additional cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves for good measure. That elevated it to edible, even good, in a Twinkie kind of way. Bottom line - it still needs work. DO NOT make this for anyone you want to impress. Save it for movie night at home.

I have not made this yet but will do so using the suggestions from reviewers - I had pulled the recipe out of Bon Apetit magazine - that recipe called for 2 tablespoons rum (quite a difference from the 1/4 cup here) SO there is a misprint on one of these!

I made it according to the recipe.The filling was more like a mousse vs a true tiramisu. I would add more marscapone cheese next time, use more lady fingers, and cut back on the rum (especially with children in the house eating this). I would not make this again- it was a disappointment.

Rating: 3
I made this about a year ago and suggested a few changes for next time: less sugar, more ladyfingers, more rum. This year I made again with changes and it was even better. I used 2/3 cup sugar, 1/2 cup rum, and three packages of ladyfingers. Make sure is you use extra ladyfingers, which I highly recommend, that they are layered properly with the filling. I double stacked the ladyfingers, but next time would make three separate layers. It might be beneficial to line the sides of the pan with parchment paper and peel it off before serving. I think this might avoid having such rough looking sides to the cake.

Rating: 3
This is a pretty dessert, and the filling is delicious. Also, you can put it together quickly and leave it in the fridge for a long time, and no baking is involved. I used crushed ginger cookies and candied pecans for the topping. I agree with the reviews - 1/4 cup of rum is very strong, especially if you are serving to young kids! I used 1/8 cup of pear juice and rum extract mixed, and it still tasted strong. I suggest using a pastry brush instead of dipping the lady fingers. Overall, it's a lovely dessert, and it looks like it takes a lot more effort than it does!

Okay I read the reviews and since they seemed split I decided to make this recipe. I didn't love it. I doubled the spices and the mousse filling was really very good (that's why I gave it two forks) but the cookies although almost soaked in Amaretto never really softened to my liking. I didn't love this recipe - easy but not as tasty as I wanted it to be...

This is the second Thanksgiving I'm making it and I had the same problem again. The mascarpone and the pumpkin (from scratch not can) were too grainy. I'll follow an earlier suggestion and blend the two first and then add the whipped cream. I used Bailey's because I didn't have rum and I thought it worked well. Also, it definitely needs a good 24 hours to set and for the fingers to soften up.

Rating: 3
This was so simple and delicious. I did make some alterations to the recipe to accomidate all ages. I used 2 cups of Whipping Cream and 1 cups of Sugar. I doubled the pumpkin pie spice as several others mentioned this. I wanted this to be a dessert that could be enjoyed by everyone so I omitted the rum and replaced it with gingerbread eggnog. Several had mentioned that they used gingersnaps for the cookies sprinkled on top so I thought it would be a good substitute and it certainly was! Everyone loved it and I would definitely make this again! Thanks to everyone that shared their alterations to this recipe as it made for a well received dessert!

This is a great pumpkin pie alternative. Not too sweet, not too heavy. We've done this 3 or 4 times, and I found that if you use the soft lady fingers (like those from Trader Joe's), dump them out on a cookie sheet and let them sit overnight in a dry place and they'll resemble the harder Italian variety by morning. If they aren't hard when you start, the result will be too gooey.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and Christmas... and have requests to do so again this year. Everyone in my family loves it. It may (or may not) help to mention they are are somewhat discerning foodies :) who also do not like overly sweet desserts. In any case, to those who had trouble with it setting up - I'm wondering if they used the authentic italian lady fingers, which are crisp, not soft like those used in trifles. I'm also wondering if those who thought it was too 'boozey' :) did not let it set overnight? The flavors need time to meld. And, to the person who asked about substitutions for alcohol: my sister in law was pregnant last year and I made her a mini version using some spiced apple cider and drop of rum flavoring in place of the rum. She was very happy.

This has become a family favorite in my house. My only recommendations are to crisp the ladyfingers in the oven first and make sure that the pumpkin and cheese mixture is beaten until stiff peaks form. This helps it set better. Enjoy!

I liked this recipe in theory, but unfortunately the rum was way too strong. The filling was great-- very subtle and creamy. I may try making it again, but may use a mixture of milk/cream/cinnamon to dip the lady fingers. But, we had to throw the first attempt out (we don't even like our drinks that strong!)

More of a trifle than a Tiramisu. Where is the "pick me up"? Good, light, and different.

Okay, I had to make a few substitutions. Store was out of lady fingers so used pound cake. Did not have mascarpone so I subbed an 8oz. carton of whipped cream cheese. Took a reviewers advice and used ginger snap crumbs instead of the amaretto cookies, and I used Frangelico instead of rum. The result was very good. My guests loved it, and my husband wants me to make it for Thanksgiving as a "pumpkin" alternative. Oh, and by using the whipped cream cheese instead of the mascarpone, it set up very nicely after about 6 hours in the fridge. I think I'll make it this way again.

I thought this was a nice light dessert. Better than any pumpkin cheesecake I've made (not that I personally have anything against cheesecake). It's also great for a holiday dessert in warm climates. No cooking involved! You need to use quality ingredients to get a quality product. I used Myers dark rum and added enough to cover each ladyfinger. I also thought this tasted better on day 3. Next time I would make it a few days before serving it.

I made this for thanksgiving, not sure if I would make it again or not. If I did i'd make some major changes first. The overall taste wasn't bad, the filling came out fine and was the best part. But there wasn't enough liquid with just the rum to soften up the italian ladyfingers that I bought, so I would most likely add something else to it. maybe get rid of the rum altogether and substitute amaretto or frangelico. Also I couldn't find amaretti cookies anywhere. while it is quick to assemble, make sure you really give it a good 24 hours to set up, otherwise it might be impossible to cut.

I think the reason the reviews are diverse is that people are very split on this, people either love it or hate apparently. I followed the recipe to a tee and guests just loved it, I mean really. Just about everyone asked for the recipe and seemingly couldn't get over how delicious it was. On the other hand me and my husband didn't care for it in the least! Hmm, so is it good or not? I said I would make it again, but really only as a request. It was definitely easy and nobody thought the rum was overpowering.

Rating: 2
No one asked for seconds when I made this, and if I ever made it again I'm make a lot of alterations to the recipe. I doubled the recipe for the filling as many reviewers had suggested and this yielded the perfect amount for a 9" pan. I also used Grand Marnier instead of rum, but guests complained that that dessert still tasted too much of liquor. My suggestion would be to use half the liquor, and 7-8 ounces more pumpkin and less cream, as there wasn't a strong pumpkin flavor. Also, drizzle the ladyfingers with espresso.

Rating: 3
When I first decided to make this recipe, there were only a few reviews; after reading those submitted since then, I would agree that the spices need to be increased for more intense pumpkin flavor, but it sure went over well with my family and guests as written. We made it Thanksgiving morning and it set up almost perfectly by the time we were ready for desert, just needed 30 min in freezer. With a high of 87 and the humidity a bit high here in Honolulu, we really wanted something light for our finale and this was perfect and leftovers held up well for 2 days. I was very impressed and will make again, with a little more rum flavor and perhaps a little more ginger.

Sorry for this double posting, but could not edit original once submittted. Made this For Thanksgiving on 11/23/06 and it was one of three pumpkin-type desserts. Made it mostly as directed but added about double the pumpkin pie spice to boost up the flavor. Also, mixed the mascarpone and the pumpkin together first, then folded into the whipped cream = no lumps. The rum made cakes too "alchoholy" for most of the women in our group. Next time will change to 1/2 Amaretto and 1/2 rum or all Amaretto. (Men particularly liked the rum in the recipe - I guess they are used to drinking alchohol "straight-up".). Will add crushed almond cookies in between layers. (Used Swiss Almond Cookies from Trader Joe's - worked well.) Possibly will add whipped cream topping at end then cookies which gave a good and interesting crunch. I left the Italian cookies whole - did not split them as directed. This gives it a more cake-like consistency. On the whole, was easy to make and was well-received by all. Traveled well. Would be beautiful made as a trifle.

Freezing makes all the difference for perfect slicing, whether it's done in 13x9 for squares or springform for wedges. Used Chinese Five spice for more zip and will add sliced almonds between layers next time. Gingersnaps would give more festive flavor but amaretti give traditional tiramisu taste. Soaking true italian ladyfingers is essential as they need to be moist. If using plain grocery lady fingers, sprinkling with rum works just fine. Lots of potential for thinking outside the tiramisu box!

It's is VERY easy and a lighter end than traditional pumpkin pie. After following the recipe for the first one, I added more Marscapone cheese the second time for a filling more like the traditional tiramisu I'm accustomed to. I also dipped the ladyfingers in the rum very quickly, to ensure all had equal coating and flavor. That method will use more rum, but I think it helps add more dimension to the flavor and makes it a more grown up dessert. With the total ingredients costing less than 9 dollars, there's no reason not to give it a try!

Made this for Thanksgiving dessert and even the non-pumpkin-pie-lovers raved. The only problem I had (and no one but me noticed it) is that the mascarpone left some small lumps in the cream mixture, although I mixed it as long as I dared for fear of the whipped cream breaking. Next time I'd probably whip the mascarpone with the pumpkin before adding it to the the whipped cream.

I made this for my family for Thanksgiving 2006. Everyone loved it. I used Captain Morgans spiced rum. I live in a small town and my grocery does not carry mascarpone cheese; I used whipped cream cheese. I had to by two bags of mixed Italian cookies to obtain the amaretti cookies. Next year I'm going to use ginger snaps; they are readily available. I have made a pumkin cheesecake for many years but now I've switched. I added a little more of the spices as one of the reviewera suggested. Happy Thanksgiving to all.

What an interesting way to use pumpkin. I like the light texture, as pumpkin desserts sometimes can be dense. But don't be fooled, mascarpone and whipped cream are tasty, this is no dieter's dessert..ha! Could use more spice to elevate it to 4 forks for me. Maybe the addition of ground ginger, or orange zest. I think next time I would use Grand Marnier or Cointreau (maybe even fresh squeezed orange juice, for the non-alcoholic version). I used a good rum (Mount Gay), and layered in a glass trifle bowl, skipped the step of unmolding. Easy to make, good, but somewhat-flat-tasting recipe as written. Could use a bit more "oomph".
