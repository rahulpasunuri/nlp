i used a whole head of elephant garlic instead of the 1/2 head regular variety. milder and works well!

This is the most delicious chile I have ever tasted. It works with tortilla chips, or as a sauce over chicken, beef, and fish. The best part is it's totally healthy and there is no fat in it. I made a few changes and it's brilliant: I like it spicy, so I put in 4 Guajillo chiles and 4 anchos, after soaking. I used about 1/8 c Splenda. I roasted all the veg (onion, garlic, tomatoes) in the oven at 450F until carmelized, then combined all the other ingredients together. This salsa is a must at any party, or small gathering as a beautiful and tasty appetizer with chips! Try it!!

When making this I should have taken the other reviewers advise and made a double batch since I was using it with rice. I had to go back to the store and get more ingredients to make more. Although my husband didn't care for the Red Chili Rice and Shrimp recipe (I did) he really like the salsa.

As a fan of all salsas, I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this recipe. Didn't have to use any sugar, as the tomatos were plenty sweet. Do yourself a favor and make this, but be sure to make a double batch if you're making this for the rice -- you WANT to have plenty left over for chips!!

I own this cookbook and I make 3-4 of these salsas on a regular basis. The Mild Red Chile is an excellent, all around salsa. Very garlicky and delicious. I highly recommend this recipe and the cookbook.
