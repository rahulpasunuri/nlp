If you're looking for a creamy, modern take on a traditional side dish, then try this recipe! The goat cheese and basil add a nice pop of flavour.

This a really good recipe, I have made it more than once. The cheese definitely adds to it. I still feel like it needs a little something else- although I didn't have any basil so maybe that was it. Yum!

This tasted good, but I was especially happy because the kids liked it.

Loved the subtle flavors of the goat cheese and the garlic. I did not have fresh basil on hand, but I do not feel as though it took away from the dish at all. Would certainly make again.

These potatoes "rock". The flavor of the goat cheese very subtly influences the potatoes and is just great. I served for Xmas eve with prime rib, but would also do nicely with Turkey, or anything gamey. Leftovers are also good. Consider making, and try using red potatoes with skins on mashed rustic style.

I used the concepts in this recipe rather than all details. I didn't measure ingredients and also made a few changes. Boiled 3 peeled garlic cloves with the potatoes rather than adding garlic at the end. Mashed with goat cheese, a small piece of butter, a splash of hot skim milk, chopped green onion, parsley, and basil. Salt and pepper to taste. Much lower in fat than the published recipe but still absolutely delicious. I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to guests.

I was looking for a recipe to use up an abundance of potatoes from my biweekly organic produce delivery, and stumbled upon this little beauty. I had only half the goat cheese on hand, so I added 1/2 c. sour cream and reduced the half-and-half to 1/2 c. I also used frozen basil cubes from Trader Joe's--those things are so handy in the dead of almost- winter! Yum. This was fast, tasty, & just what the doctor ordered on this nasty weather day.

Super simple; great application for Yukon Potatoes, basil adds excellent touch. I expect this would adapt well to whatever flavor of chevre you have on hand.

This turned out so well today--I will definitely use this again. I used melted butter and a 4 oz package of goat cheese, then added a tablespoon or so of cream to make the texture a little smoother.

Made these for Thanksgiving dinner and they were gone in minutes. I initially thought they were sort of a strange texture but, boy, were they good! Will definitely make these again.

Fabulous! Everyone thought so. I took previous reviewers advice and added 10 cloves of garlic to potatoes and boiled with them. This one's a keeper!

YUM! (Nothing more to say.)

This was great comfort food! I heated the cream, melted the butter in the cream and smashed 2 cloves of garlic and let it steep in the cream (I removed the garlic before adding the liquid to the potatoes). I also used fresh thyme instead of basil since I was serving the potatoes with braised short ribs. I just thought the thyme would go better with the beef. The potatoes were super creamy and delicious. I'm going to make these again for Easter.

Absolutely terrific. What a great blend of flavors! I boiled, then riced the potatoes, then added the remaining ingredients. The goat cheese, typically a little sharp, mellowed with the butter and basil. Yum. I served this with the Steaks with Bourbon Sauce, a great combo.

WONDERFUL. WONDERFUL.

I made this for the 4th of July, to go with bratwurst. It was well received and I will make it again. I agree that it would be perfectly fine (perhaps better) if made a day in advance. I think I might have cut the potatoes too small before I boiled them, because they seemed overcooked at 25 minutes. They were certainly easy to mash, but I thought the final texture was a little grainy, as opposed to totally smooth. Also, despite using salted butter, I did need to add a hefty dash of salt at the end. I usually try to avoid adding salt and let people add their own, but I think a solid dash of salt was important this time. I guess the amount of salt that you add right before serving the potatoes really depends on the saltiness of your butter and goat cheese, so do a taste-test right before it goes to the table and add salt as necessary.

I made these potatoes for a recent dinner party and they were outstanding! Once the potatoes were cooked, drained and returned to the pot to remove any excess water, I passed them through a potato ricer for a very smooth consistency, then stirred in the additional ingredients until well blended. I prepared the potatoes a day ahead and placed them in a covered casserole dish, then reheated them in the microwave (stirring occasionally) right before serving. My friend who has graduated from cooking school loved these potatoes and asked for the recipe.

Everyone loved this potato dish. Made it for Christmas and everyone thought it was delicious and very tasty. I will make it often. You're spoiled after making these mashed potatoes. You don't want to make any others.

Perfect as written; potatoes can be made ahead and reheated and do not need anything added like gravy or more butter. Absolutely delicious!!!

Splendid variation on mashed potatoes. Will serve again and again.

I made these yukon gold potatoes with basil and garlic goat cheese, half and half, butter and fresh basil. They were a big hit with our guests and will be made over and over! They are delicious!

Lovely flavor! I used skim milk in place of half-n-half and it worked fine. I think next time I'll try the cooking cloves of garlic with potatoes suggestion... I served this with my recipe for a spicy Sesame Pork Roast and Mushroom with Spinach Verona, all complimenting each others flavors. Do try these potatoes! KIMBER

Very tasty recipe. We've used feta in lieu of the goat cheese which adds a nice flavor. We serve this often with pork or beef tenderloin, and "Barbequed Turkey with Maple-Mustard Glaze". Our guests love it!

Very creamy & tasty - I substituted Land O Lakes fat free half and half & added some garlic and herb seasoning in addition to the fresh garlic. Also altered measurements since it was just for me and my husband. Would definitely make again for dinner guests.

Great flavor! I additional garlic and goat cheese, and reduced fat butter. The potatoes were creamy enough without the addition of the half and half. I served it with Pan-seared Filet Mignon with Red Bell Pepper, Tomato and Basil sauce from this website and grilled vegetables. Wonderful menu.

These are the best mashies ever! I didn't use any garlic at all. I think it would cancel out the taste of the goat cheese. If I used anything I would use roasted garlic.

I thought this recipe was great--a good change from normal mashed potatoes. Instead of adding the garlic after cooking the potatoes, I boiled the potatoes with 10 cloves of garlic. Then I mashed it all together.

Very good. We too, increased the amount of garlic. Next time I think we will increase the amount of cheese.

This was a great fall recipe. I increased the garlic, and used a 6 oz (standard) package of cheese. My kids and my parents loved it!!

These mashed potatoes are delicious. I have made them several times - and always to rave reviews. I used a mild, excellent quality goat cheese, and just a little less basil.
