I was trying to duplicate a dinner I had recently at the Bonefish Grill so I modified the recipe slightly. I omitted the pine nuts and added parmesan chese. It was delicious. I followed another cooks suggestion and did not pan fry the trout first. I just baked it in the oven.

Delicious and easy with some adjustments to simplify (we make it on week nights now) and reduce calories. Use trout filets, toast nuts in advance, cut with Panko crumbs about 2(nuts):1(Panko), substitute olive oil for butter, go easy on the garlic, skip refrigeration, skip frying and bake about 20 minutes in 400 degree oven.

I think I would dip this in buttermilk and then do the crust.

the nut flavors did not blend well with the garlic. would not reccomend this dish.

Perfect recipe as written. It will become the "standard" trout recipe.

My husband fixed this for lunch today and it was tasty and easy to make. We couldn't find trout so we used catfish fillets that we had on hand. We followed the recipe as stated and it turned out great. We will definitely make it again.

I have another recipe for nut-encrusted fish, but this one beats it. The garlic adds a nice touch and the roasting temperature seems perfect. I took the advice of a previous reviewer & skipped the browning step. The nuts did brown fine in the oven. (I placed the pan in the upper half of the oven to ensure this.) I've tried the recipe with macadamia nuts, but the suggested pecans are better. Yummy & rich!

We made this recipe with Salmon. It was excellent. The nuts have enough oil that the fish is much better when it goes directly into the oven.

O.k., I guess I am the odd-man-out. I found this recipe greasy and heavy tasting. I guess all the nuts with the butter and oil was too much for me! My husband thought it was pretty good, but I didn't even finish mine. Preferred pan fried trout with green onions recipe (lighter).

The crust on top of the trout is very tasty and brings another dimension to the flavor of the fish. The most important thing you can do with this recipe is start with very fresh trout. The family loved it and it was easy to make.

I made this recipe with Fresh Brown Trout (skin-on) boneless filets (not a whole, in-tact trout, as the directions suggest), which I caught myself through the ice! I skipped the pan-frying and it turned out just fine, plus it made a better presentation. Suggest putting salt&pepper on BEFORE the nut mixture. I baked about 20min at 350, and it was very juicy, cooked through, yet not over-done on the edges. Aluminum foil on the baking sheet made very easy cleanup. Next time I will try roasting the nuts, before chopping, to improve flavor. I had the perfect amount of nut mixture for an entire 20" Brown Trout (2 filets). This recipe should work with any mild fish.

This was tasty with some good, fresh trout. I was in a bit of a hurry and made it with all pecans to good effect. I fried then baked the fish, but I agree with the last reviewer in that frying is probably not necessary and will go straight to the oven next time (where the nuts will toast anyway at 400 degrees).

Excellent - easy enough for a week night dinner and good enough for company. I used golden trout which is similar to steelhead trout, but much milder, the trout was filleted, and I toasted the nuts and sesame seeds ahead of time. Next time I do this recipe, I will skip frying the fish and just put it in the oven - it did not seem to help. Perhaps frying is intended to toast the nuts?

Excellent. Made this twice now. I halved the recipe for two. Even so, I had more nut mixture than I needed. No problem. I just used it for the next time.

Couldn't get trout one day - worked great with about 1 lb salmon fillet for 4 servings, baked in microwave with nut crust but without 2 tbs oil: moist, tasty, less mess, lower in fat.

What a wonderful dish! I am by no means a "cook" and I pulled this off! My husband and I are avid fisherman and have experimented with many ways of cooking the trout that we've caught, but we really enjoyed this one. I am not a big fish lover and I finished a whole trout! (20 incher!)We will definitely do this one again. Thank you!

O.K. I improvised a bit. We were camping when I caught a 3-lb cutthroat. Instead of the pine nuts and pecans (which I hadn't packed) I chopped 1/2 cup of mixed nuts (only a few were salted). Royal Mix included almonds, pecans, hazlenuts, brazils and cashews. The result, was a delicious and impressive presentation straight from the lake to the plate! It was so good I'm not sure I would follow the actual recipe even if I did have all the ingredients.
