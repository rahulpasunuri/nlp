I make this up at our mountain home in a giant electric fry pan after snowboarding all day. It is wonderful! My husband, 4 year old son and two teenage sons love it as well. I changed the technique somewhat. Browned the chicken, then sauteed the veggies in the same pan, sauteed the rice as in risotto, added the chicken, hot Italian sausage back into the pan, added the spices, then enough broth to cover the meat and let it simmer. Yum!

The reason the other reviewers didn't like this recipe is because it is nothing like the traditional paella. Paella never features mushrooms or garlic. One never takes items out of the pan, they are added in a certain order.

A friend and I worked together on this for a small dinner party, and we were disappointed by the result. We made virtually no changes to the recipe (chorizo instead of breakfast sausage), and it turned out to be too much (overspilling the pot) and simply quite bland - not bad, but not special. If we did it again, which seems unlikely, I think we would half the recipe and liberally alter it in order to add that missing flavor - maybe more crushed pepper, some white wine, or a variety of other options. I recommend a similar course to anyone else who tries this.

I mis-read the recipe and used 1.5 lbs sausage (sweet Italian). While I might cut back on that a bit next time, it was still a great dish. Solid comfort food, and solidly in my "repeat" file.

Made this intending to serve as part of a tapas party. By the time I was going to cook the paella, my guests were full. But, I'd have to say that it was good when I made it for dinner a couple of days later. Probably not good enough to make it the sole entree at a dinner party but good. And I prepared everything up to the rice-cooking step ahead of time so that I could just throw in the rice and stock and cook without missing my guests. I will say that 6 cups of stock to 2 cups of rice was too much stock. I had to cook longer than suggested and the result was still a bit soupy. I'd start with 4 cups of stock next time.

My family really enjoyed this recipe so I would make it again for a weekday meal. It is not something that I enjoyed enough to make for a dinner party, it was just not that impressive.

My girlfriends and I had a Spanish themed gourmet night and used this recipe. We liberally made changes to the meat/seafood ingredients, and halved the recipe. It was very good with complex flavours. Although the ingredient list can be very long and daunting the prep work is most of the battle. This one will be used repeated by club members for sure. Don't substitute aborio rice or the saffron.

Made this for a dinner party at a friend's house and it was terrific. More folks than expected turned up so I just sent someone out for more chicken and problem solved. The saffron is an important flavour in paella so don't leave it out.

Great recipe, delicious. I use Hillshire Farms Beef Smoked Sausage sliced and browned also one large sweet Spanish Onion, chop and saute in olive oil and add to cooked rice. I am mystified as to why they suggest using aborio rice as it is not authentic. Goya and Viga make a yellow rice that includes a flavor packet, delicious and less expensive then saffron. I find it hard to believe that firld workers could afford saffron anyway.

This is a fabulous recipe and great for a casual dinner party. My guests all went for seconds. I used sweet Italian sausage instead of the breakfast sausage, less chicken, and added shrimp. Next time I will use only chicken legs and thighs.

this was our first epicurious recipe and still the favorite. lots of work but worth it! sometimes we add shrimp, also alternatively use a 1 lb roll of sausage and crumble into chunks. we serve it with the red "sangria" recipe on here which is also out of this world.

Great flavors in this dish; wonderfuly rich and filling. I skip the saffron and almonds, cause I didn't have them on hand the first time I made this, but I doesn't harm it at all. My only caution is that you should use fresh rosemary, or the dish will have an unpleasnt texture and you'll spend the whole time picking the needles out.

A very good paella even my kids will eat it. I add some hot chorizo to it.

A wonderful comfort food. Great for a cold evening. Reheats well, and makes a great leftover for lunch the next day. I did add Vidalia onions and they made a sweet surprise!
