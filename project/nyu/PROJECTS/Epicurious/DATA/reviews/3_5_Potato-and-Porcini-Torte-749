I thought this recipe was so tasty. I sliced the potato with the mandoline and the mushrooms were so flavourful. Will make this again for sure!

i hate to be negative, but i thought this was a waste of perfectly good porcini mushrooms. the taste of rosemary was too strong but in spite of that, the overall flavor was really pretty bland. not even sure what i could do the next time to improve upon it, which is why i said i wouldn't try it again...
