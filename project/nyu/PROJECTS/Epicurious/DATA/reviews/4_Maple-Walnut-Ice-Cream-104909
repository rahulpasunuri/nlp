This is a good easy recipe. The flavour and texture is really nice but overall it was too sweet for us. Next time I'll cut the maple syrup to probably a bit more than 1/2 of what the recipe calls for.

This has excellent flavor and texture. Of note, the grade B maple syrup is a must! I tried it with grade A as well and that just didn't have the same pronounced maple flavor. Also, beware, the syrup reduces at a very high temperature - when you temper your eggs and return them to the heat, it will be done thickening in no time (mine took less than one minute). Do not budge from the stove or you'll have maple scrambled eggs!

This ice cream has a depth that is sublime. Just the right amount of nuts, don't be tempted to add more. Perfect recipe, make it.

I don't even LIKE maple walnut ice cream, and this was FAN TAS TIC. Great directions, froze beautifully and keeps well. Delicious.

This was my year to buy an ice cream maker and learn something new, so now, after 13 different flavors, I feel pretty experienced. I do try and cut both fat as well as sugar level since my hubby is Diabetic. And I have found that most recipes I have gathered use way too much sugar for my taste. Also, I have been tweaking the fats as well with only slightly noticeable results...I mean creamy is the desire....so to me, ULTRA creamy is just overkill. I used 1 c heavy cream, 2 c whole milk, 1/4 t salt, 2 egg YOLKS, the 1/3 c toasted/chopped walnuts, and 1/2 c of Log Cabin sugar free syrup. Also, after all my ice cream experimentation, I found the easiest method....beat the yolks in a quart Pyrex measure. Heat the cream, milk, salt until little bubbles form around edge of pan then temper into the yolks. Return to pan/stove and stir constantly with rubber spatula until it starts to thicken and a finger run across the back of the spatula leaves a line. Pour back into the Pyrex measure, stir in syrup. Then I let chill on couter and then in fridge. Don't want to bother with all that ice bath stuff and you really just want to get rid of the heat. Add the nuts after it's been churned in ice cream maker. Mine came out exceptional....so I would imagine the untweaked version is superlative, tho like I said, way too sweet. Since mine was so good, next time I will try reducing the fat further with a Half & Half and 2% ratio. Thanks for the inspiration Epicurious!

I altered the recipe slightly and it came it out excellent! I used 1 cup of cream (not heavy) and 2 cups of 2% low fat milk with Grade A maple syrup. Unlike other recipes I've tried, this ratio of milk and cream did not make the ice cream taste just like cream or tasteless. The maple syrup does give it more of butter pecan-like ice cream flavor.

Substituted 1 cup cream and whole milk for 2% milk. Turned out great.

Amazing. Just make sure to use Grade B (Amber) maple syrup. I sometimes use pecans instead of walnuts which is lovely as well.

Easy and fun family project. We used what we had in the house, grade A maple syrup, and a combination of light cream and heavy cream. I reduced the syrup for 5 min. guessing on the amount. I used the quick chill method. We took turns cranking our manual frozen cylinder style ice cream maker while playing scrabble. At the end of the game we had a nice desert and learned a few vocab words.

Your custard will turn to scrambled eggs only if you cook the custard at too high a temperature for too long. Don't boil your custard! Salmonella is killed at 145F, and a mixture of eggs and cream is safe to eat at 160F. If the phone rings or the doorbell chimes, ignore them: leave your custard unstirred and you will have scrambled eggs, period. An immersion blender will just make smaller curds of scrambled eggs. At 170F, as recommended in the recipe, the custard will be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Draw a line with a clean finger across the spoon. If the line does not run, and the custard feels smooth and silky, you're ready to chill it. ALWAYS USE AN ICE BATH, and stir the custard often to reduce its temperature quickly.

DON'T DESPAIR WHEN YOUR ICE CREAM "BATTER" GOES TO A SCRAMBLED EGG CONSISTENCY! USE YOU HAND IMMERSION WAND. IT WORKS EVERY TIME. Also, I NEVER wait the three hours before pouring into the ice cream maker...just stir constantly with one metal bowl inside another bigger bowl filled with ice and a little cold water. And yes, this is a good recipie. I fiddled with it and added organic high quality vanilla extract ground cardamom seeds (careful, a few pods go a long way) for a more grown up palate. I also NEVER use heavy cream or half and half. I use GREAT quality non-homogenized milk from the farmer's market. Avoid ultra pasteurized which heats all the life out of your milk. Next time I will reserve some of the reduced maple syrup and swirl it through when it's finished in the ice cream maker.

This is very good, although made with a few changes. First, I found 1 cup of syrup to be a bit too sweet for my taste, so will use 3/4 cup in the future. I used whipping cream in place of heavy cream. It was still very rich-tasting and creamy, but a little less heavy and fattening. If you can find them, try this with black walnuts, which is what I used. It's a very spectacular flavor! I think I'll try this with pecans also. Made only 1 quart for me.

I made this twice with very good results. The second time added ground Cardamom and it definately added a delicious flavor complexity that I felt was missing from the original receipe.

This is one of the best things I've ever tasted. It's very creamy and very maple-y. My only complaint is that it doesn't make enough. The recipe says it make 1-1/2 quarts, but it made about a quart for me. Grade B syrup is not lesser quality than Grade A syrup. It's just different. The recipe calls for it because it has qualities that make it appropriate for making ice cream. I had no trouble finding it. It looks like the people who did not like the recipe used Grade A syrup. I would only use Grade A if Grade B weren't available.

I made this using grade A syrup. Also, I did not reduce the syrup because it was boiling hot today and I didn't feel like standing over a hot stove. For that same reason, I didn't add the toasted walnuts as it would have required using the oven. Lastly, I reversed the proportion of cream to milk (2 cups milk, one cup cream). The ice cream was DELICIOUS with a wonderful maple flavor. I'm sure that it is irresistable with the toasted nuts added. Even with the reduction in cream, it was rich enough. In fact, using more milk than cream might have made the maple flavor more pronounced. Just a guess. Anyhow, I am posting my changes so that you know that you can cheat with this recipe and still end up with some very tasty ice cream.

We made this with grade B syrup we got in Vermont last summer. Wonderful maple taste.

Absolutely delightful! Wonderful maple flavor (we used a good quality syrup, grade A amber) and the toasted walnuts were fantastic. The ice cream was perfect -- definitely one of our best yet. Make sure you use a good quality maple syrup or the maple taste will suffer.

I used grade A pure maple syrup in the exact quantities specified in the recipe and it turned out fantastic! One of the best ice cream recipes I've tried so far. Other than using the Grade A syrup, the only other thing I added was some additional reduced syrup swirled into the ice cream after it churned. Will definitely make again!!

I made this today....doesn't have the full maple flavor that I was expecting...could be because I used Grade A syrup....I should have added some maple sugar..but I forgot I had it until after...anyway I'll make this again.. soon as I get my hands on some grade B syrup...

This tasted more like egg custard ice cream than maple. Despite using the correct syrup, the maple flavor was waaaaay too subtle. I'll be looking for a different recipe to try.

You can get grade B syrup at Trader Joe's or at a great price online at www.saintpierrefarms.com. 1 1/2 quarts makes two bowls of ice cream? You're kidding, right??

Excellent recipe. Grade B Maple Syrup was impossible to find other than special order, even at gourmet groceries. Substituted 1-1/4 cup Grade A, and reduced over heat to approximately 2/3 volume. Worked perfectly!! Cheaper, easier, less running around! Boiling syrup quadruples in volume, so use a large pot. Also, double the batch - the above recipe only makes enough for two good-sized bowls. Very tasty!

I loved this flavorful ice cream. I found Grade B maple syrup at a national health food grocery. In fact I bought it in the bulk area, so I got just what was needed! Now, I have to get more for the next time I make this recipe, which will be soon.
