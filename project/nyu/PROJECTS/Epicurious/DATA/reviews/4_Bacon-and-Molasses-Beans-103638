Used a mix of cannellini, black and red beans. Only had a pig's foot not bacon (bacon would have made even better) and did add maple syrup. YUM!

Delicious and exceptionally easy. I used no-sodium beans, then seasoned to my taste with S&P (I prefer to control salt myself). Followed others' suggestion and added a bit of maple syrup. My family ate it up and my 12yo has been begging me to make it again!

GREAT recipe, and easy. I processed the pepper and the onions in the food processor while the bacon cooked. My store was out of canned beans, so I reconstituted some dried ones without any trouble.

Very very good. I made this recipe, thinking I was just going to make a quick bean dish, not expecting anything amazing, and I got rave reviews. People were convinced that I slaved for hours. Big hit.

DELICIOUS! awesome complex flavors. I doubled the beans and found that doubling the sauce wasn't enough for me (for "saucy" beans) - so tripled/qudrupled the sauce and love it!

AWESOME beans! I always add a bit more ketchup, worcestershire and mustard, but we LOOOOVE these beans! Beats the canned variety any day!

This was pretty good, tasted like baked beans but took half the time. The onions and bell pepper added a bit of crunch to the dish. Next time I'll add a little chili powder.

I have made this recipe several times and have fooled those who swore that they had been baked in a slow oven for hours...the only addition would be about 1/3 cup maple syrup

I would make this dish again for my dad, because he really liked it. These beans are vinegary and pretty flavorful. And they are a good and easy change from "kicked up" canned baked beans.

I kept thinking I follwed the recipe incorrectly as the beans had hardly any flavor. I added a lot more onion and green pepper as well as more molasses, brown sugar, extra mustard, and some chili paste. After these modifications I was satisfied with the result but the recipe, as written, was very bland.

These beans were delicious. HOWEVER! I had to feed 50 people and I used this as a side and so increased the recipe. Still delicious, but it could have easily have been enough for 100. Scale this back, unless you want to eat left over beans for days and days and days and...

This recipe was great and a very easy way to get great baked bean flavor in a short time. I served these alongside barbequed beef short ribs and jalapeno jack corn muffins and everyone loved them.

This side dish was definitely easy to prepare and surprisingly good. I think next time I will cut down the vinagre as it was a little too tangy. I tried adding brown sugar but it still didn't cut the tang. Of course, my husband loves anything with bacon so...they were a hit.

Being a non-pork-eater, I made this recipe without the bacon--just used a couple tbsp of canola oil to saute the vegetables, along with a kind of smoky maple-flavored BBQ sauce, and it was delicious. I didn't miss the bacon one bit.

This was really good. I think the vinegar may have "firmed up" the canned beans which were fine but my husband prefers them a little softer. Next time I plan to skip the vinegar. I made half the recipe for the 2 of us and there was some leftover for a snack the next day.

These are GOOD!

Delicious and so easy. I had never made ANY bean dish before (always used canned baked beans). These are so much better. I used regular bacon (6strips) and doubled the sauce ingredients. Also, left out the green pepper, which noone in my family likes.

Beans don't taste any better than this!

I've made this twice and it's been a hit both times. It's so easy to throw together and great for potlucks. Each time I've added more (garlic, other spices), and they blend well. Definitely makes a lot more than six servings though (unless you consider beans your main course)!

I made these beans for a Father's Day BBQ this weekend and won rave reviews. I made them a day ahead of time and kept them warm in a crock pot for the party and they were great. Really easy to do and smelled great cooking! I'll definately make these again.

As simple as opening a can of beans. I skipped the step of briefly removing the bacon, and simply continued adding remaining ingredients which added much extra flavor. Also used regular molasses which worked fine. The beans remain firm which is so much preferable to canned baked beans which are mushy. Served this with BBQ baby back ribs, cole slaw and biscuits and it was a great side dish.

My husband thought these were the best baked-beans he ever had - better than his (former) favorites he eats almost weekly. I cut the recipie exactly in half for the two of us and the amount was perfect. This makes a batch with a thicker texture; to make a "saucier" recipie, cut all but the sauce ingredients in half.

Great & easy baked bean recipe. As I usually do, I added additional onion, peppers, & garlic - wonderful flavor. It is a recipe for 8 not 6!

Fantastic and quick. I used dark molasses with no problem, and also added about 1/8 tsp of liquid smoke.

Really good.
