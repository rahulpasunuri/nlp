This was a delicious combination of flavors! I carmelized pear slices as well and arranged them on top with the other ingredients. Next time I make it, I will use larger onions and a bit more cheese. Also, living in a high rise apartment, I don't have an outdoor grill. I used the grilling feature in my European multi convection oven. I "grilled" the oil brushed crust until it began to brown. Then removed it, flipped it over, dressed it with the toppings and "grilled" again until done. My guests asked for the recipe and my husband loved it too. Beautiful, elegant and delicious!

I baked this instead of grilling. I bought a crust at the grocery store.I sauteed the onions. Then I put the walnuts onions and cheese on the crust and baked it in the oven on 350 until done. Easy and declicious.

Soooo good! Always comes out amazingly crisp...and when we add some thinly sliced apples, the flavor is even better.

Ok- I made this last night and had to come back to amend my review. my pizza dough is getting so much better, and we tried grilling for the first time. big hit. but this combo of toppings was NOT the way I remembered. I must have had a lot of wine that night. It just didn't work at all... and I wished I had just made a margharita as I couldn't finish some of the slices, which was a waste of otherwise good pizza.

glad i found this again... i had forgotten its name even though i kept talking about how much i liked it. the combination of toppings is superb. unfortunately i biffed the grilling big time and so we had to scrape everything off and have a salad. but now my dough is vastly improved (google jeff varasano's pizza recipe) and so on my next batch i will be making this one again.

This worked great in a conventional oven -- bottom third at 500F for about 10 minutes. Followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't oil the crust. I did add extra pepper to the onion mixture. May try it with pear or apple next time, as one of the other cooks suggested.

we always grill our pizza. The gas grill is much easier as far as temperature control, and flipping the crust, which if you're really adept you can use a pizza peel. I loved this topping combination, and we even thinly sliced some fuji apples that we had on hand.

This was pretty good. I bought a pizza crust and had to bake due to bad weather. Gorganzola and caramelized onions are a great combination. Next time, I will try grilling it.

I used refrigerated pizza dough and had a lot of problems with the dough being too warm and sticky and kind of melting on the grill. any suggestions for this? even with my dough dilemma the pizza (or more like flatbread) still turned out excellent!

I love this combination, everyone thought it was super yummy! I added thinly sliced pears for a little balance.

Very good, used purple onions with a little brown sugar and added some left over chicken.

Made this last night to rave reviews. My coals were a bit too hot. Will probably use the gas grill next time for easier temperature control. Can't wait to try it again.

Total flavor snooze. Maybe my gorgonzola was too "dolce" but it required every manner of tabletop additive-- oregano, smokey salt... it needed something else but I don't think we hit on it. No seconds were had.

Wow! Easy and fast. We didn't have gorgonzola so substituted goat cheese which turned out wonderfully. We're now thinking up new toppings.

The combination of caramelized onion, Gorgonzola, and toasted walnuts was wonderful. I didn't have parsley, but added some sliced Shitake mushrooms which complemented the other toppings very well.
