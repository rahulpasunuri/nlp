A delicious, and flavorful alternative to split pea soup made quickly with simple, stock ingredients! I heated 2T. of olive oil and sauteed the onion, red, and green bell pepper, chopped celery, and minced garlic. Diced leftover Honey Baked Ham joined the sauteed vegetables. The next addition were 1t. of dried thyme, a 1# bag of frozen sweet corn, and 5c. of chicken stock. The ingredients simmered for 10 minutes before I added the diced russet potato. After an additional 10 minutes I stirred in a slurry of 1T. of potato starch, and 2T. water to achieve a chowder-like consistency. Served with garlic bread for a satisfying, light dinner.

Loved the soup. A great way to use up left over Honybake ham from Easter. Thank you everyone for the great tips. I used butter instead of the lard, and vegetable broth instead of water.

Great Soup! This is delicious. I used a ham bone from a Honey Baked Ham, spiral cut. These leave a lot of meat of the bone so there is no need for the ham steaks. I doubled the recipe and did use 3/4 chicken broth instead of water-it is delicious!

I make this soup after every Thanksgiving or Christmas if I have a ham. It's a great soup - and even great for hang overs. I generally follow the recipe except for the lard (use olive oil) although this year I had some left over grease from cooking beef for spaghetti (filter). Don't use more (or too much more) than the 5c of water, even if it seems like you need it or you'll water it down too much. I also did add a little bit of sea salt (not much) when cooking veggies to add a bit more flavor. If you want extra flavor, add a bit of fresh cilantro and a slice of a jalapeno or Serrano pepper after it cooks, similar to a Pho or Asian hot pot soup. I think the soup is flavorful without it but it adds an extra kick. Also, the best ham is the ham off the bone - more flavor. Hope you enjoy.

I had all the ingredients in the house except for the ham, so I substituted 4-5 slices of smoked bacon instead. It did the job of imparting a rich, smokey flavor to the soup. Cut the bacon in small pieces, render the fat and soak or pour off excess if you get more than 1/4 cup. Continue with the recipe, sauteeing the veggies in the bacon fat. I also added an extra potato, 3-1/2 c. chicken stock and made up the balance with water. The end result was a delicious, hearty, and comforting soup.

Yummy. I used 4 T of butter and had to degrease it the next day. Also, I used chix broth as opposed to to h20. Great soup.

This soup was fantastic, although I did not make it per the recipe. I did the following: 1/2 cup butter instead of lard, 2 large white onions, 1 large green pepper, 1 small red pepper, 1 zucchini, 5 clvoes garlic, 2 bags of frozen corn, 5 yukon gold potatoes, 4 cups of chicken stock and a ham bone left from a spiral ham with plenty of ham left on it. Threw in 5 sprigs of rosemary that I fished out at the end. Really good and I didnt need to thicken it.

I made this soup for my wife this evening and only changed two things: unsalted butter instead of lard, and I put two cups of the soup after the boiling period and blended them in a blender. I then added the two cups of blended soup back to the batch. This made for a thicker, opaque soup. We loved this recipe.

We really enjoyed this soup - I didn't use the lard either, just olive oil, then all chicken broth and extra potatoes and ham. After cooking I scooped several ladles full of veges, pureed them, then returned to the pot, which thickened it up nicely.

I added sweet potato and chopped kale with a little garlic as another cook suggested. This is a very hearty soup for a cold winter day - A slice of bread on the side and YUMMM.

I found the soup to be only average. It did not have much flavor. Perhaps adding chicken broth for 1/2 the water would improve it. It was a little better the next day. It had more flavor and I had added some fresh thyme.

I served this with Baguette and butter, very delicious and hearty. I used smoked Ham Shanks, because I couldn't find a ham hock. They had plenty of meat, so I omitted the ham steak. Also, I added extra potatoes. One potato for eight servings is not enough.

This was AWESOME! I used 2 yukon potatoes instead of 1. Everything else I followed exactly as written. I did use lard also. I made the soup early in the day and followed the cool down instructions precisely. After it chilled in the refrigerator it was very easy to skim the fat before rewarming. The smokey flavor from the hamhock was delicious. This is a great, easy soup recipe and can be served year round.
