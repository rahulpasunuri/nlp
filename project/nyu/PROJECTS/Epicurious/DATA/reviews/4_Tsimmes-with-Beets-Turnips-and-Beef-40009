OUTSTANDING! My mother used to make this all the time. She grated a potato and mixed it with flour into a liquid and poured it over the tsimmis so that it formed a large dumpling. Yummmm. I have never been able to duplicate that dumpling mixture.

the best tsimmes I've eaten in over 40 years of eating tsimmes!

I made this using a little under three pounds of brisket and found there were WAY more vegetables than meat. The sauce was tasty as were the meat and vegetables, although I would serve it over mashed potatoes next time (I made a potato kugel for the first time - my family was not crazy about it), beef stew style, cubing the beef and cutting the number of carrots in half. My four and five year old kids liked it, too!

I've made this dish 4 times (including for Rosh Hashanah and Christmas), each time to acclaim. My friends literally beg us to make it again. If you are looking for a great brisket recipe, then look no further.

I purchased boneless shortribs and was intending to braise them when I saw this recipe. I followed the recipe except for reducing the number of carrots to 4 as I only had four very large carrots in the house. The balance was perfect. The meat tender and the flavor of the vegetables complementary. Served it with potato kugel.

Very tasty... However, oven cooking for 1 1/2 hrs. didn't finish dish... Pulled dish out and finished covered on stove for another 3 hours.. Reheated with cover off another 1 hr (to reduce liquid)... Probably long cooking time attributed to cut of meat - didn't know anything about brisket so butcher gave a medium cut piece... Grated vegetables was different but delicious..

I was a little hesitant in preparing this dish because of the lack of spices called for in the recipe. Happy to say we were pleasantly suprised with the outcome. I think it is important to leave a little of the juice from the pan on the dish with the cut brisket to maintain the moist tender meat that this recipe produces when the brisket is cut after cooking. Served this with garlic rapini, mashed potatoes and cole slaw for a great dinner for five on a rather cool evening in Florida. Reminded us of the hardy winter meals we had in Michigan during the late fall and winter months.
