The cream cheese gave the eggs a nice creamy consistancy. Subtle but tasty. I used scallions instead of chives and increased the amount. Turned out perfectly.

Omelette style,this is great. I whisk the chives into the eggs and put the creamcheese as the filling. Just great with a bagel! There was a deli in Allentown PA that got me hooked on their version back in the 80's. Remember, God loves you.

Good, but bland. I'd suggest adding some other type of cheese with cream cheese and some veggies.

I've made this for years, but I have used sauteed onion instead of chives. The blend of cream cheese and onion adds a kick to regular old scrambled eggs.

Kim from Los Altos inspired me to practically run to the kitchen and make this delicious dish with her additions, which happen to be my favorites. Yummy!!

Needed another ingredient to add some pep. Seemed like regular scrambled eggs.

Wonderfully simple, I used the blender suggestion for my B&B today. Everyone practically licked their plates! Next time I might add a bit more chives but it was very tasty!

Made this recipe for eight. Put ingredients in the blender and was delighted with the consistency of the eggs. They were very light and fluffy

It was fast and easy. I just made it for one. With 2 eggs, two scallions, 1tbs butter and 1 tbs cream cheese.

This sounds odd, but the result is creamy, cheesy, scrambled eggs. I like to cut the egg portion in half, add 1 chopped and seeded tomato and cooked and crumbled bacon at the end. I serve on toast triangles. I've also used red onion, with great results!
