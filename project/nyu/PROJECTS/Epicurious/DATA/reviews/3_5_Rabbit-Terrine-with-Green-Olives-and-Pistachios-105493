I had to take a look at the very first review here to see what everyone was commenting about. WOW. Just ... WOW!. :) This is from GOURMET, and nothing in the recipe was hard to find or do. One wonders just where this "professional chef" (A Cook from Wmsbg, VA) actually works. Dennys? Burger King? Didn't have to be demonstrated. I read the instructions and looked at the picture. The results were stellar. Anyone interested in terrines would do well to find a copy o fPates and Terrines published by Hamlyn. It's the best book on the subject, bar none (though out of print now and can be pricey). The really galling thing about that review was the "get real" and the overall tone. This is a terrine from Gourmet magazine. Most of us WANT to try new things and expand our repertoire and understanding and journey of discovery, and while doing so we learn things along the way that can be applied to other things (and move us beyond even needing recipes and into the realm of creating our own). I'm not a "professional chef," just an adventurous cook with a Williams-Sonoma addiction and an appreciation for fine cookware and adventurous dining. What is this "professional chef" even doing here, one wonders. Ignore this person. You'll love this dish, and the ingredients are not difficult to find at all. Perhaps you have to ask the butcher to order the rabbit a couple days in advance in your area. Is that really so hard?

This was pretty easy and really good, but it is NOT a terrine! It is an Aspic. Even though it is made in a terrine, it is a meat molded in a stock flavored gelatin which by definition is an Aspic. Wikipedia's definition for aspic = Aspic is a dish in which ingredients are set into a gelatin made from a meat stock or consommé. So people, if you want a very nice, pretty easy ASPIC, you should make this. If you want a more traditional terrine, without the gelatinous mold, look elsewhere.

I don't know what that chefs problem was. That was one of the easier terrines I have ever made. I wish I had read the recipe through before starting. I would have started a little earlier in the day. It was worth the work and delicious. Next time, and there will be a next time it will be a snap. I live in Bloomington, IN and had no problem with any of the ingredients.

This is a delicious and beautiful dish. It is time consuming to make (although I'm sure it would be faster the 2nd time around) so I would save it for a special occasion. Everyone we served it to loved it. The olives and pistachios work beautifully with the rabbit and the leek-y consomme.

This is an elegant and unusual terrine that should not intimidate. You can find the ingredients almost anywhere, e.g., the rabbit if not at Whole Foods then at Asian markets. It takes a little time but it is beautiful, especially if you can layer the ingredients.

I like this dish and the ingredients work well together. I understand the 'pro chef' being little wary, the cooking instructions are very specific! try this 1. cook rabbit in broth. 2. shred rabbit add to olives and pstachios. 3. clairfy broth as a consomme. 4. add ingredients. 5. set under pressure. 6. served within 1-4 days. perfect!

I'd like to know what kind of professional chef is intimidated by a relatively simple terrine, because I'd like to be certain that I avoid the diner where they work.

I haven't made this recipe, but I was surprised by the professional chef's response. She said that the ingredients would be difficult or impossible to find. I looked over the ingredients out of curiosity, and found that I could get all of them at Whole Foods (a supermarket chain). I even saw a rabbit there last week! Now, I know I'm lucky to live in San Francisco where food items are easier to find, but I've lived most of my life in New Jersey and even there I could have gotten everything easily, with the exception of the rabbit.

I made this dish for the holidays. It had a great presentation. However I received mixed reviews from the taste testers. I liked it, but was not impressed enough to make it again.

No matter what I did, I couldn't get the broth completely clear. Very frustrating. Took hours and hours trying to get it clear. Got it almost clear, but not perfectly. The resulting terrine was good, but not worth all the effort.

I couldn't wait to make this after seeing the photo in the magazine. I have made it twice now and both times have had rave reviews. It actually tastes better after setting for a few days. It was more time consumimg than I thought but well worth the effort for a special occassion. If I can find the ingredients in Indiana, anyone can find them.

I was almost afraid to try this because of adverse reviews(?) by others who, without trying it, guessed that it was too difficult, or that the combination of pistaccios and green olives would clash. It was delicious! My dinner guests raved about this appetizer.

Actually, this combination of ingredients sounds fairly typical to me, if you're in France.

I think the combination of game, green olives, and pistachios sounds a little far-fetched. Honestly, green olives and pistachios together?!?

Get real, I am a professional chef and I would not even try this! It would be interested to see how this could be assembled. Even though I know of terrines and how difficult they are, this recipe would have to be demonstrated. The mixture of ingredients does not sound very appealing and most ingredients would be difficult or impossible to find. Again, lets get real here. I would love to see if anyone really tried this one and will check back in a few days or a week.
