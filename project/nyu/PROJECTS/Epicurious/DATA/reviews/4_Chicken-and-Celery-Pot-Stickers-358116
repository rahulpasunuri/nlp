These are really good. I couldn't find the dark ground chicken so I bought some chicken thighs, took off the skin, cut the meat off of the bones, and then threw that meat into the food processor. It worked out great. Although I used 4 chicken thighs and it made way too much. I could have used only 2 and I would have had about the amount for 20 pot stickers. The taste was fantastic.

Super yummy. We added also 1/2 carrot-grated, 2-3 TB grated yellow zuccini. We shredded the veggies first, then used the blade in the food processor to get them minced small. Put that in a bowl. Then chopped the meat to the right size. Thought about adding cilantro, too, or bok choy. We didn't steam with water. We used 1-2 TB soy sauce in 1 cup water to steam them. They come out salty already. Super good.

Easy, delicious. Followed recipe exactly but with ground chicken breast and turned out great.

I made this recipe just the way it said, and got great comments. I served them as one of my foods for New Years. Would make again.

3.5 stars-4 for simplicity! Everyone enjoyed this dish. I used ground breast meat and also added some cilantro to the sauce.

I made a couple changes, some out of necessity, some for personal taste. I added an extra clove of garlic and quarter cup of cilantro in the beginning. I didn't have low salt soy sauce, so I didn't add more salt. I also only had white meat ground turkey, so I increased the sesame oil to 1/2 tsp. These were super easy! I filled 23 wonton wrappers (next time I'll fill them all a bit more) and had to do 2 batches b/c I could only fit about a dozen in at a time. Everything came together quickly. The dipping sauce was a bit salty...but I'm sure it will be better with the low-salt version. I'll probably add cilantro to the dipping sauce next time. The meat wasn't dried out at all and the overall flavor was fantastic! Once I tried these and realized how great they are, I went ahead and mixed up another batch of filling. I've got it ready to fill and make fresh tomorrow.
