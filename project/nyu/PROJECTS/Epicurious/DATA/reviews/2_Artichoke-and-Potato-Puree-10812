I agree. This was very bland.

living on the East Coast in an urban area, the chances of getting ideal ingredients is an advantage. I added freshly grated Parmesan-Reggiano and upon draining the water from the potatoes added half-n-half until it simmered. The dish came out pretty fair but not excellent.

I thought this side was tasteless and more time consuming than necessary. We served it with the recommended menu from Gourmet. The chicken and salad were great, but the potato...big disappointment!
