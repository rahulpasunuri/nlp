I've made this cake many times for my parents and in-laws and they love it. They are Italian and appreciate the flavors in this cake. They find most North American desserts too sweet. It reminds me of the flavors of fresh cannoli. I recommend this recipe for Europeans or those who prefer less sweet desserts.

This cake takes a lot of time -- and it isn't all that great. The filling in the middle doesn't go very well with the rest of the cake. There are much better cake recipes out there! Don't waste your time with this one!

I made this for Easter and while it was quite tasty and well-received, it also took a lot of time. I used slivered almonds rather than pistachios and it turned out fine.

I made this recipe for Easter and did a little test. I made this cake and placed it next to a 'dump' cake that took only about 20 minutes to assemble. The crowd loved both of them equally. So, while this is a good cake and has a sophisticated taste - it does take quite a bit of time. If you are up for it - then give it a shot. The chocolate in the middle is a nice touch.
