We occasionally do a version of this, but with salmon roe, as to the environmental impact of the over fishing of Sturgeon. amazing dish if done properly.

I have been making this as an annual New Year's Day breakfast for years. Served with a little champagne, it's the perfect way to start off the New Year. Try substituting a pepper-infused vodka, as that really takes the flavor to a whole new level.
