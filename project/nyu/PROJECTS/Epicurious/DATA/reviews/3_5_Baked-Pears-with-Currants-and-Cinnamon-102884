I almost didn't make this recipe because it looked so simple.... but it was a delicious ( and low fat) winter dessert. Go for it! Maybe add some chopped almonds to the currants. And use currants - don;t be tempted to sub raisins: part of the elegance is the visual contrast of the creamy white pears, the amber syrup and the tiny black fruits.

Just delicious! I cut the pears in half and removed seeds, used dried cranberries and made this with splenda and brown sugar blend splenda. Smells yummy while it's baking.

This dish was wonderful!!!! It is easy to prepare, especially if you use the apple corer, and it tastes light yet rich at the same time. I served it as the healhier option at Christmas dinner and it was a big hit. It is also a lovely accompaniment to a simple pound cake.

I have made several baked and poached pear desserts. This was fine but nothing special.

I will have a hard time not considering this dessert every time I see pears in the produce department! It was easy and fabulous! I used raisins instead of currants since I had them on hand, but will probably try the currants next time. An apple corer is not necessary, using a knife will work. This one is a keeper in my recipe file.

This is a definite keeper...7 forks! Made this three times since Oct05 including X-mas. Family and friends loved it! Added extra water to create more syrup and keep it a bit thinner vs sticky. Served with scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. Your guests will think you are a gourmet cook; so easy and can be made ahead of time or morning of party. So easy to put in oven as you sit down to dinner and in one hour this is ready to serve! Very decadent, smells wonderful, guarantee your guests will be asking and wondering what is next for dessert! Perfect for the fall or winter holidays.

I made this recipe last night with bosc pears. Insteach of coring the pears I cut the bottoms off so they would stand upright, and baked them whole. I substituted dried cherries for currents. It was superb!

This was EXCELLENT!!! Very easy, elegant, and delicious! It was the hit of my dinner party, which was almost entirely comprised of very good Epicurious.com recipes. I did make one change, due to not being able to figure out how to core the pears properly (even with a corer!) without leaving any seeds behind. I ended up halving and seeding the pears and laid them inside up on the pan. It also took quite a bit longer than 50 minutes to bake them at 350 in my electric oven. Perhaps that was due to them being halved? (I had thought it would take a shorter time, if anything!). It took about 1 hr 20 min. It was VERY well worth the wait, though. Every single person asked for seconds, and I'm planning on making this recipe again next week already!

I find that cutting the pears in half, then removing the core, makes this much easier to prepare. It looks just fine for a family dinner.

Tastey and delicious! This was a perfect "lite" finisher to a somewhat rich main course. I followed the suggestion to add sour cream-perfect addition. The syrup turned out a little runny so next time I'll use less water with the sugar mixture. Also, I substituted dried cranberries and raisins for the currants (I couldn't find them in my area). I think currants would have added a stronger flavor but the sub.'s worked fine.

Easy and delicious...I halved the recipe and it easily served 4 people.

I first made this in February, and have since lost the magazine. I'm glad to find the recipe on Epicurious. It was simple to make, and reminded me of something more complicated, but comforting, like a pear pie. I cut the recipe in half (made for two people) and the leftover pears were delicious cold the next day.

I agree with the other cook from Chicago... simple and elegant. The smell of this desert cooking was an added bonus during dinner! I served this with french vanilla ice cream and it was very well received.

This made a fabulous dessert after a nice winter lunheon. The addition of formage blanc or sour cream is out of this world!

A delicious and elegant dessert that was simple to make--special enough for company and easy enough for a family dessert. Will definitely make this again.
