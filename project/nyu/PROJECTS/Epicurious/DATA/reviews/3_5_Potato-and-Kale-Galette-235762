I love Kale, and am eager to make this. In Holland Kale is eaten a lot especially with Blutwurst and mashed potatoes. My mother-in-law who was from Holland taugh me a trick to save a lot of labor and time getting the non-tough leaves off of the stems and stalks. Wash the kale thoroughly, then freeze it in a plastic bag. When you need some kale for a recipe just crumple the kale and the frozen green leafs will fall off the stalks. Its so simple you will be amazed.

Instead of flipping this twice (because I thought it would have fallen apart in the process), I initially cooked it on the stovetop as directed, but then baked it for 25-30 minutes at 425.

I liked this and so did my thirteen year old son and husband. However, with the amount of work involved, I think next time I'll just have the sauteed kale and garlic with a side of oven fries.

haven't tried the recipe yet, but have a suggestion on getting the galette out of the pan, try using parchment paper in the bottom of the pan, place the plate over the baking dish and invert. It should come out without any problem.

I love this dish and eat it frequently. I add some Parmesan in each layer.

Need to make sure bottom of pan is covered with the thickest slices or it has a hard time holding its shape. Ours turned to be more of a potato kale scramble, but we added some grated parm on the top, and it was delicious. Would def make this again, but maybe in the oven like a regular casserole.

We have made this several times and find the flavor outstanding with all the garlic - Russet potatoes a must as the high starch content will help keep it together. We find carefully loosening the sides and using an offset spatula to loosen the bottom, then place a flat baking sheet on top of the fry pan and invert galette onto sheet pan - I have one with out a lip so I can then carefully slid the galette back into the fry pan - cast iron works best if you have it and yes don't have the heat too high. Good luck it is well worth the effort!!

I've made this 4 times because it is so delicious but it falls apart and looks terrible. Any suggestions??

This is really good. I made it the first time according to the recipe and am making again tonight with sweet potatoes and collards. A recipe has to be pretty good to get my hubby to eat greens of any sort and he wolfed this down.

This was enjoyed by all for a Christmas dinner, accompanying a roast beef. The cooking temp. for the galette needs to be moderate low, not moderate. I found the bottom of the galette overcooked a little at the moderate temp.

Fantastic - outstanding flavor. I agree with the recommendation to add the proscuitto - made it even more flavorful - if you use this, add less salt. I sliced my potatoes with a knife - it worked well.

I was pretty disappointed in this recipe.Maybe it was something I did, but it seemed kind of dull. Maybe if there was something more holding the potatoes together it would be better?

The flavor was decent, but the presentation was a mess. The potatoes burned within the 12 minutes, but I might chalk some of that up to user error (perhaps I had my heat too high), but I couldn't get it to slide out of the pan without making a total mess. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!

yum! easy enough to prepare. i don't have a mandolin so i had to slice the potatoes by hand which was a bit time consuming. i brought it to a pot luck and was showered with compliments (which i love!) Question- i had some difficulty flipping the galette over without it sliding around a bit and not looking so pretty- suggestions? next time i might crisp some pancetta with the garlic before tossing in the kale.

This was delicious and beautiful! I made it ahead and wasn't sure if it was going to be greasy or the potatoes would lose their crispness when reheated. I was so unsure of this recipe that I made 'backup' potatoes if the recipe didn't work out!The Galette was a the hit of the dinner party. Make sure to slice the potatoes as thin as possible and use lots of garlic with the kale. Everyone raved.

I think this is really a great dish. I think it looks nice for company and goes nice with a spicier meat like an italian sausage or spice rubbed pork. My two and 4 year olds ate it and thought that it was good. Kale is a super food!!! Eat it all you can.

Not as complicated as it looks - turned out very very nice. Needed a use for all the kale in my garden - really liked it as a garlic-y filling. Will definitely make this again.

first it looks really good. I was doubtful that the potatoes would cook without burning, but it totally works. the potatoes are crunchy, and the bitterish garlicky kale complements the potatoes very well. very nice side. I even passed the recipe to my mother!

I used kale the first time, and i didn't like it all that much, i used spinach the second time and it was better but not great

This was easy to make and looked very impressive, and it was delicious. I'll definitely make it again.
