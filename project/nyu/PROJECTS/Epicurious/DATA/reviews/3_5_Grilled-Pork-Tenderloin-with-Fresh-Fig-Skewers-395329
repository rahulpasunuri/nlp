This is a simple and quick recipe ideal for a summer weekday. The fig skewers, honey and goat cheese perfectly set off the unadorned flavor of the tenderloin for a surprisingly elegant and wonderfully Mediterranean dish. We paired with the Warm Escarole Salad with Goat Cheese, Hard-Boiled Eggs and Bacon from Epicurious and it made a great meal.

Loved this recipe, very basic it had the salty (feta) and the sweet figs and honey. Perfect together!
