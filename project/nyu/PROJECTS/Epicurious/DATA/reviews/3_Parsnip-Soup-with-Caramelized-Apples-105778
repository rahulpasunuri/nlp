This soup was way too sweet for me. Fuji apples are very sweet as are carrots. I even tried to offset sweetness with more salt, a bit of curry as well as more lemon juice and full whipped cream. I will try Granny Smith next time and possibly only one.

This was a nice soup! It came out a little thin (my "garnish" sank right to the bottom), so I'd suggest going heavy on the veggies and light on the water. I used Jonagold apples, which were great. I agree with what another commenter said about selection of parsnips--be sure to choose small ones as they will be sweeter. Also be sure to use them as soon as you can after buying--they go off really quickly.

A group of us consider ourselves to be quite the food critics, and we love this soup. I (OK, this probably sounds ridiculous to the hamburger and hotdog crowd) take it camping at least once each summer. The quality of the parsnips and apples matters - use small, sweet parsnips. Stir in some plain yogurt. Or sherry. Of course the flavor is mild, so it makes sense to serve it as a starter to something more challenging.

Very nice creamy recipe. The apples are a perfect combination for this soup. I served it to a group of young adults that were not sure they wanted to try it out but one person bravely tried it and was shocked at how wonderful it was and convinced all the others to try it. Needless to say they licked their bowls and asked for more. Difinately a keeper.

Wonderful combination of flavors! I really like parsnips and, as someone else said, never met one I didn't like. This will be a wonderful addition to Thanksgiving weekend meals. The apples are superb. Very, very tasty.

I served this soup for the Jewish High Holidays as an alternative to chicken soup. Everyone loved it. Instead of Fuji apples I used Granny smith. The tartness offsets the sweetness and richness of the parsnip. I also used an organic vegetable stock and no cream. And still with all the substitutions the soup was a great hit.

Although I like parsnips, this soup was too sweet and had little flavor. The predominant taste was of apples, which I tried to enhance by adding curry flavor and more salt, but unfortunately this didn't improve the soup's flavor.

This soup was rotten! I attempted this recipe as part of my lunch special in the fine dining restaurant where I am working. The texture was like baby food, the taste was of overly boiled parsnips (not deep and caramelly as I had hoped)and the color was a repulsive goldy-green. I know good food and usually epicurious does too, but even my customers said this one is not fit for consumption.

I haven't met a parsnip soup yet that I haven't liked, and this is no exception. The apples complement the parsnips well. Although I prefer a less sweet soup and have other recipes that I prefer, I really enjoyed this.

Several neighbors and I planned a new Thanksgiving menu from the November 2001 issue of Bon Appetit. This soup was one of our selections and we were not disappointed. We now have several new Parsnip lovers! Our group of 6 voted to include this recipe again for 2002.

A good friend brought this soup on a recent weekend visit. After tasting it, I concluded that she must love me a lot! The flavor is heavenly and the caramelized apples are a brilliant touch. I can't wait to make it just for myself.
