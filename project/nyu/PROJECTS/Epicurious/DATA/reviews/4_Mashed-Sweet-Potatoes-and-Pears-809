Made these for a small catering job served with pork short ribs and the guests loved them! Definitely a keeper!

I prepared this for our Thanksgiving potluck at work and for my family at Christmas -- both times, multiple people requested the recipe and my Xmas dinner guests just raved about this dish. However, I did make a few changes the second time I made this. I used Taylor Gold pears because they're juicier and a little more sweet, used a small handful of brown sugar instead of what the recipe called for, and I added a a couple of dashes of pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon. It was yummy and still not too sweet.

I make this dish every year for Thanksgiving (and then some) and it's always a hit. I typically make it a day ahead. Very tasty with enough sweetness. Definitely one of my favorites!

For years, this has been one of our standard Thanksgiving recipes. It's almost like a dessert. I hate having to peel the hot sweet potatoes, and mixing everything can be a pain, but it's worth it.

This was fantastic! I made it for Thanksgiving and loved the combination of pears & sweet potatoes - the pears helped cut the sweetness of the potatoes & provided a nice zing to the taste - also liked the reduced amount of sugar. Very good!

I made this last night and everyone loved it. It was easy to make and easy to make ahead.

So YUMMY! I made these for a dinner party 2 years ago and they were a huge hit. All 14 people asked for the recipe. I'll definitely be making them for Thanksgiving again this year. More sophisticated and not as sticky-sweet as traditional candied yams.

Hey, the Cardamon? It cost a whopping $12.96 for a jar of it. I think the recipe is tasty, but an expensive one. I am now on a hunt to find more recipes to balance out my investment on the cardamon!! Overall I give it a 3 fork rating for taste. But not sure that I would make it again for Christmas dinner. It was not a knock out on looks and presentation.

This is easy to make and delicious. It's not so sweet and coying like the usual sugary marshmallowed yams. I made some changes which I think enhances and updates the recipe. I mashed the potatoes with the skin and cooked the pears less so it remained chunky when mashed. this made the dish looked more substantial and festive. Oh, I replaced the cardamom with fresh rosemary and topped the dish with sprigs of rosemary. Magnificent and highly recommended, especially for the holidays.

I made this for a pot-luck and it was a hit. The pears add just the right amount of sweetness, and the cinnamon/cardamon is a nice touch.

I JUST made these. Serving them tomorrow for the holidays. Tasted the spoon, and WOW, these are good!!!

This has become a Thanksgiving standby. We observe Thanksgiving with our adopted neighbor families and I'm always asked to repeat this recipe. Everyone loves it and thinks it's different.

This is simple and delicious. Served these with Apricot Glazed Pork Loin with Caramelized Onions and Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Lemon Balsamic Vinaigrette. The Cardamom and cinnamon add an nice flare to the sweet potatoes and the pears really lighten up the texture. Definately can prepare 1 to 2 days in advance and re-heat in either microwave or oven.

Loved this dish. The taste and flavor of the pears and cardamon added a unique and wonderful flavor!

This is tasty and incredibly filling. It stands alone as my dinner. I used coconut nectar (which in this case was white grape juice with some coconut cream according to the label), and used 2 tbsp of honey instead of sugar. Next time I'll use maple syrup.

Rating: 3
Last year I tried these for the first time. My pears rotted so I used canned, not sauteed, with the syrup instead of nectar and left out the sugar. The sweet potatoes weren't baked quite long enough so it was hard to get them smooth. Regardless everyone requested them again. This year I made them the right way and they were delicious. I used margarine to keep it vegan for my brother. Next time I'll use a little less sugar and more spices.

This is a fantastic dish, but I did make a few easy changes....I boil sweet potatoes until tender, cool and peel. I also use canned pears...easy and delicious..and quick. I use brown sugar instead of white. Everyone LOVES this dish. Fresh and clean tasting...not too sweet.

I was never a big fan of sweet potatoes, until I discovered this recipe. It's now a requested dish at my family's Thanksgiving Day celebration. When it comes to the Thanksgiving Day meal, I don't mind the extra work. This year I'm making this popular dish for 40 people. I'll have sweet potatoes coming out of my ears! But, I know it's worth it.

This was a lot of work for only ok results. It's news to me that anyone on the planet eats yams with marshmallows, but soft-cooked yams with butter and a nice thin, crispy crust of brown sugar are every bit as nice as these, and about 1/10th the work.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and it was a HIT!!! Especially for those who believe yams are ONLY good with gooey marshmellows on top - they quickly denied ever eating marshmellows after trying this one. The dish was sweet and smooth and my kitchen smelled wonderful when sauteing the pears. Try It!

I made this recipe for our Thanksgiving dinner and everyone was impressed. However, I increased the recipe to serve 12, and had too many leftovers. But they are so good, that it's OK. I think next time, I will add a little more spices, and the pecans as the other reviewer mentioned.

This recipe has been a hit in our house and now a family recipe since we first tried it in 1994! We look forward to it every year.

I have made this recipe every Thanksgiving since it was published, and it always gets rave reviews. I am asked for the recipe by someone every year and then THEY pass it on.

This has been on our Thanksgiving menu every year since 1994. Easy to prepare and a wonderful flavor. Everyone wants the recipe. Much better than the traditional marshmellow goop recipes. I usually do not care for sweet potatoes but this one is a real hit!

Made this for Thanksgiving and everybody loved it, it is a very nice combination of flavors that goes very well with turkey. I added pecans on top to add it some crunch and used about half of the spices called for in the recipe.

I substituted buckwheat honey for the sugar - and cut back on the quantity as buckwheat can be overpowering. It got raves. I like the texture added by the pears.

Made it for Thanksgiving dinner and all wanted the recipe. I like this sweet potato recipe better than the ones dripping with sugar and marshmellows.

I made this for thanksgiving and found it to be an interesting mix of the pear flavor with the sweet potatoes. It was convienient to have it made a day in advance and then to just heat it up.

I have made this sweet potato recipe every year for Thanksgiving since it origionally appeared in Bon Appetit. The mixture of flavors is just heavenly. It's an easy recipe, and can be made early in the day, and just heated through.

This recipe is a little too sweet for me. Then again, I am one of those people that loves sweet potatoes just as they are - or perhaps mixed with a little butter.

This recipe is fabulous! I have never liked sweet potatoes, but my husband begged me to make some. I chose this recipe and now I love them too! And thankfully there were no marshmellows in the recipe!

I first tried this recipe when I had extra pears that were about to go bad. I liked it so much that I have made it many times since. I have on occasion substituted water for the pear nectar and have found that the dish turns out just as well.
