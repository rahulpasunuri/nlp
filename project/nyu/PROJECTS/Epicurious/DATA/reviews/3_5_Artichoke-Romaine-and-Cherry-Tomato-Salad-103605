I love this salad. I do everything as per the recipe except I leave out the oil . I tasted the dressing before adding the 1/2C olive oil and decided that it was perfect the way it was.

Love this dressing! It's a nice twist on a traditional balsamic. I used only about 1 tbsp mayo as the minced artichokes make it fairly creamy and less olive oil because I love balsamic. In general, you should always taste the dressing as you add the olive oil and stop when it tastes good to you.

I doubled the recipe and was glad that I used twice the amount of artichokes called for, as recommended by several here. Used 1/2 c. parmesan and almost one c. shredded feta. LOVED IT and will definitely use this outstanding salad recipe again!!! Am delighted to have so much extra dressing, too!

I regularly make a simpler version of this salad. I simply mix the dressing ingredients, minus the artichokes, in a jar and shake. For the salad, I pour the dressing over artichokes and sliced tomatoes. It's great for an everyday dinner, and the dressing keeps in the jar for future meals.

I noticed that everyone who loved the recipe accidently added both jars instead of dividing them. I use 1 cup packed well drained marinated artichoke hearts in the dressing and I do not top the salad with the artichokes. The creaminess is important, so it doesn't work to reduce mayonaise or oil (I tried). Also, I try to keep the tartness down, so I carefully drained the artichokes, took care not to add extra balsamic. This needs a high quality balsamic that's more sweet than sour. Maille (brand) course grain Dijon mustard worked the best for me. The recipe does make about 2 cups of dressing, but it keeps fine for a few days and we always eat it right up.

Hmmm, don't know what the fuss is all about. It's ok, but I have definitely had better things made out of artichokes. And it makes a ton!! I say cut it down to 1/4 and you'd still have leftover. The taste gets better after it's had a chance to soak in for three days, but the color and texture is still a turn-off.

I tried this recipe twice; first using sugar, second using honey. Use the honey as called for in the recipe. It really mellows and enhances the flavor of the dressing.

the recipe made A LOT of dressing but everyone liked it.

I found this dressing to be fabulous (although the texture and color before tossing with salad is rather unappetizing), but had 3 times as much as needed!! I am glad to have the leftovers, but still. With dinner, it easily serves 10. But it is very delicious. I added about 1/3 cup fresh sliced basil leaves to the romaine mix and it was wonderful. Great summer or winter side.

This is one of our favorite salads. We use the grape tomatoes that have become so easy to find in the stores. The dressing is more than enough and keeps very well in the fridge.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but I found the dressing to be quite bland and tasteless. I love vinegar, so maybe for me to like it, it needed a little more? I have no idea why I didn't like it when everyone else seems to. Oh well. Maybe I'll try it again someday, but I'm hesitant

I've made this salad two times for different dinner guests. Both times I was asked for the recipe. I once made it with grilled chicken and I had so much dressing left over my husband dipped his chicken in it. Definately worth trying.

Easy and delicious! Refreshing dressing that will make enough for more than one salad. Made this at a friend's house last night to happy reviews! Do try... KIMBER

I, like everyone else, thought this was a terrific salad. One thing though, did anyone else have a ton of left over dressing?

Great flavor, simple to prepare, and dressing can be made ahead. I served this to guests and they loved it. It should be noted in the ingredients that the artichoke hearts are DIVIDED. I halved the recipe and ended up putting the whole jar in the dressing - it was still good! I just had to go out and buy another jar for the salad.

We made this for a fancy dinner party that we had. I thought it was very good, but it didn't get the rave reviews that some of our other courses got. I forgot to put the onion on, so maybe that was the problem :) I find that the tips of the artichoke hearts can be tough. I bought a huge jar of them at Costco, and then cut the tips and any other tough parts off of them.

The combination of artichokes, tomato, onion with artichoke in the dressing is very nice.

What a nice change from Ceasar Salad. This is an elegant, yet easy-to-make salad. I would add another jar (or two!)of artichokes to mix throughout the salad rather than just adding them to the top. Having served it in a bowl, rather than individual plates there weren't enough artichokes to share!!! Make sure you do the grated parmesan... it finishes it beautifully.

I halved this recipe and it was very tasty. Did not change anything else on the recipe. The dressing is delicious.

What a luscious dressing! It's addictive! Being a vinegar lover, I appreciate it's bite. But if your not, you might find it a little overwhelming. Add more mayonnaise and less vinegar. Experiment..The dressing gets more mellow and tastes better each passing day so don't be afraid to make this dressing up to 5 days ahead. Tastes great on chicken or as a dip too! My friends raved!

Really liked this salad- used grape tomatoes. Makes a lot of dressing- good for more salad!

I loved this recipe - quick and easy. The dressing is great! I made full recipe of dressing even though just serving two, so I have lots leftover and make fresh salad and toss. I chose to process dressing in blender and used all artichokes in the dressing. Dressing is great for crudites as well. Also, I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry. Will definitely make again!
