I made this recipe for Mario's Osso Bucco recipe. While I wasn't able to purchase chicken scraps, and didn't want to buy 3 chickens to get the scraps, I chose instead to buy a bag of veal bones, and boy was I glad I did!!! It was really fabulous! I did add some concentrated chicken base to the veal stock at the end, and it was just perfect. Takes a fair bit of time, but mostly just to cook down and get a rich flavor. You don't need to stand over it the whole time. I made a double batch, and it did take a few hours, but well worth it!

i used leftover chicken bones that had already been roasted and the stock came out quite rich.

Bland and lacks flavor...would not use in a recipe again, canned is better!

This stock had great depth. I plan to use this again.

This is classic rich italian (chicken) stock. Very good in both dishes I made osso buco and ragu of wild boar. I would add veal bones too as a nice added touch to the osso buco.

I have used this receipe and find if you brown the chicken in the pot in a 400 degree oven for 25-30 min adding mirepoix after with the addition of savory, garlic, tomato paste, thyme, for additional 20-30 min. then add white wine and H2O and finish on stove top til reduced by 1/2 it is much better. Strain and store in ice cube trays in freezer.
