This dish was really nice, exactly as written. Such a terrific way to use the greens that are so prevalent this time of year. Adding a little baked tofu made this a substantial main dish.

i made this with the swiss chard, delicious. i could only find one big bunch of chard at my grocer, so i cut back on the coconut mixture. even better next day leftovers. i had it with a thai spiced salmon and some grilled veggies and a bottle of pinot noir.

I really enjoyed this dish even though I am not sure how you would serve it. I thought that it was going to be a rice dish (no I did not read the quantities before I started to make it) and I think that next time I would reverse the amounts of rice and coconut. It is really flavorful and has a nice kick, I think that it would make a great accompaniment to an Indian dinner
