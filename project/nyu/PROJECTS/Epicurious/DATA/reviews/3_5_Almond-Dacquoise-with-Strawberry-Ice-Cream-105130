This recipe makes a lot of meringues; I made individually-sized ones and had no trouble with sticking. I think the almonds help with that. Very good flavor.

Not only did I also contact Epicurious "help" to tell them about this link, they actually e-mailed me, to say that it was corrected. Unfortunately, it's not! Where's the quality?

I can't believe it! I actually e-mailed Epicurious (you know, "contact us with site/link problems etc")DAYS ago requesting a link fix.... oh well, they must not be reading their mail. Keep on chewing that chicken with your almond dacquoise......interesting dessert. Yikes!

I now feel comfortable submitting my renowned recipe for Warm Brandied Duck Cheesecake with Pickled Beets over Strained Peas. BTW, for those interested in the ice cream recipe, change the end of your address line in your web browser to read recipe_id=105139.

And the funny thing is, people who go to the Drunken Chicken site on purpose are never going to understand the one review that's there!

Because the drunken chicken could squeeze between my meringues, I substituted fresh peach ice cream, set the dacquoise in a puddle of raspberry puree, and topped with fresh raspberries....Fabulous, according to my guests!

I tried the strawberry ice cream link several times and each time I got only the Chinese Drunken Chicken recipe!

The strawberry ice creme link works just fine, and it makes a much better Daquiose., Fresh ingredients rule!

Ha ha!! Loved the comment from the cook from Newton, MA!! I'm going to try this over the weekend - simply buying some strawberry ice cream. I think I'd probably do that, anyway, even if the link worked. Will come back and rate it then.

I'd love to try this if you could supply the recipe for fresh strawberry ice cream.

Damn! I thought that was a strange approach to strawberry ice cream. Relieved to find out that the odd taste wasn't simnply my fault.

Interesting recipe, particularly when the link for "Strawberry Ice Cream" leads to "Drunken Chicken"...
