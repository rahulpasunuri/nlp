This seemed more like a cupcake recipe, so I added a shredded apple to it and just sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top. Yum! Kids loved them. I thought it had ample ginger flavor. I will make again, but will dice the apple since the shredded apple kind of disappeared.

Very light and moist - perfect cupcake texture. My only change was to use oil instead of butter in the cake batter. Made mini's (yielded 40) - 12 minutes was perfect in my oven. People who thought this made too much frosting must be skimpy frosters - I had 4 unfrosted cupcakes left when it ran out. Frosting would be better with more lemon juice but was pretty good as is.

Got great reviews on these cupcakes. My stepdad said he doesn't usually care for cupcakes, but couldn't stop devouring these. Even without the frosting, the cupcakes have a great spice flavor.

These are great! I made minis - baked them 14 minutes, they came out moist and delicious. right amount of spice, lemon cream cheese frosting is a very good compliment.

I enjoyed this recipe even without the frosting. The cake is light and delicate with a fantastic spicy punch. The color was a deep rich chocolatey brown and the cake itself was moist and fluffy. I would definitely make this again and will try the frosting next time.

I loved this recipe, but couldn't give it all 4 stars because I made modifications. I used oil instead of butter, and didn't have molasses, so subbed 1/2 cup brown sugar + 1/2 cup real maple syrup. Also, I brushed ginger syrup on the tops of the cooled cakes. This made them super moist. Yum! Also, used a basic orange buttercream frosting. Will definitely be baking these for the holidays!

It tastes really good, and it's easy to make. I agree that over-beating the cream cheese can make it too runny. Next time I'll keep the blender to a lower speed. But it tastes very good -- made it with the lemon layer cake also on this site.

This was a great recipe. Made a few changes: replaced butter with canola oil. Reduced sugar in the frosting. Cut down just a bit on the molasses. grated the crystallized sugar and ginger together and sprinkled on top. Delicious with tea!

A fabulous recipe. Not difficult or that time consuming to prepare. Contrary to other rviews, my cupcakes were incredibly moist. Although next time I may add a touch less molasses. The icing was amazing as well and complimented the giner nicely. A lot left over though, so I may cut it in half next time. And there will be a next time!

I don't think that the gingerbread was quite sweet enough. If I made it again, I would add more ginger. I followed the recipe exactly and I had a lot of frosting left over. If I made this again, I would also cut the frosting recipe in half.

This recipe, as with many cake recipes, suffers from dryness. To combat that, do what the cake mix makers do, substitute oil for the butter portion. Canola, safflower or plain old vegetable work well. None has the flavor of butter, but with a recipe this heavily spiced, butter would be the last thing one tasted anyway. With the canola oil, these cupcakes turned out quite moist. I would also highly recommend the addition of 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper! It adds a nice little jolt.

Nice little treats especially with the addition of 1/4 cup of toasted, chopped walnuts as well as 3 T. minced crystallised ginger in the batter. Might try a little Ginger Wine for the liquid?

The cupcakes were a bit dry and not very gingery -- I plan on using the frosting with a different gingerbread recipe, next time

I used the gingerbread recipes from the "Joy of Cooking" and it turned out perfect -- moist and very flavorful. I love the combination of lemon cream cheese frosting but this recipe wasn't "lemony" enough for me. I added a lot more zest and juice. It made for a nice piquant frosting. I also cooked in mini-cupcake tins for about 15 minutes. Made for a beautiful presentation.

I liked the lemon frosting but I found the cupcakes to be too dry - and they continued to dry out even more on the second day. The combination of lemon and spice is very good; the cake just needs some help (maybe applesauce in the batter?)

Wonderful, simple recipe-- really a winner! I'm not sure what the poster meant about them being messy; I made them mini-muffins and, with a dollop of the lemon cream-cheese frosting and a few diced pieces of crystallized ginger, they were both beautiful and delicious. A wonderful old-fashioned but sophisticated holiday taste-- and they leave a lovely smell in the kitchen, too!

I'm making these for the second time. Made them for a party, and they didn't go very fast because they're a bit messy. But those that took them home immediately started asking for seconds. The lemon icing complements the gingerbread beautifully.

This recipe was not only lip smacking good it was easy. Thank you and keep up the good work!
