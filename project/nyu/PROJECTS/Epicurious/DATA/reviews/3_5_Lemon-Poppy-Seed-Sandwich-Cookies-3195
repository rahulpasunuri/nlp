These cookies are very nice. I have made them many times. I make sandwiches out of some and others I cut into nice shapes. I have also made into logs and rolled in colorful sugars. They are light-tasting and pretty. The recipe makes a lot so I always freeze some of the dough.

I made the cookies and substituted a lemon-poppy buttercream for the filling. The cookies turned out nice a crisp which kind of made the filling fly all over when biting into them. I ended up putting them in the freezer which softened the texture of the cookie so now they kind of taste like a lemon-poppy-ice cream snack. The cookies themselves reminded me of those really thin Moravian cookies. I'll make the cookies again for a tea but I think the filling (this one or a substitute) is rather unnecessary.

I make these every year as one of the cookies for holiday cookie platters and my family loves them. I use cookie cutters that are shaped like small snow flakes. The dough is fairly easy to work with, using a marble slab dusted with flour. Just keep unused portions in the frig. till you are ready to roll them out. After filling the cookies, they get stored in the freezer until needed. Sometimes, I sneak a frozen one - yum!

Delicious. I too added a little more poppyseeds & lemon rind. I used lemon juice in place of extract because I did not have any on hand. I also used the rectangular log trick, thanks for the great idea! I just made the cookies & they turned out beautifully.

These were okay, but I've made better poppyseed cookies (not lemon-flavored). I was excited about adding lemon to these nice, traditional cookies, but found that even doubling the lemon extract was not sufficient to generate good flavor. Also, the cream cheese filling was somewhat odd with the poppy seeds. Overall, this was something different but not a cookie I'd make again. Orange might be better?...

Great cookies. I've already made them twice this week. Everyone loves them. I added nearly a quarter cup of poppy seeds, which seemed like a good amount. I used Boyajian's lemon oil instead of lemon extract -- probably the same thing but I prefer lemon oil to extract. They had a wonderful lemon flavor. Highly recommended.

Delicious! A big hit everywhere I bring them. Based on other reviews, I add more lemon to the filling and serve them soft the next day. They actually freeze well, too.

These are wonderful! The first time I made them, I didn't even use the filling - the cookies were heavenly on their own. Like another reviewer, I added more poppy seeds. This one's a keeper!!!

Great recipe. I don't bother with using cookie cutters... I just shape the dough into two 15 1/2 inch rectangular logs. Then after refrigerating the logs, I slice them into 1/4 inch slices. Making only 3/4 of the filling still makes enough to put a thin layer of filling between 2 cookies to make delicious sandwich cookies. I have used the bottled lemon peel with great results.

Great cookies - a bit of a pain to make what with chilling the cookies before baking but worth the effort. Every time I've made them people have gone back for more and asked for the recipe.

I did not fill these, as I liked them so much by themselves. Taking the advice of others, I also made two logs of the dough and then sliced. However, I made my logs rectagular, which made a very pretty cookie.

This recipe is definitely a winner. I am in culinary school and had to chose (among many others) a cookie recipe for my final in my advanced baking class. Definitely a winning combination between filling and cookie, My reccomendation would be to put the cream on top of the cookie and top it with a candied lemon rind, because when sandwiched, too much cream=leakage when eaten, and too little cream=disproportionate flavors. By the way, i received an "A" on the "cookie" part of my exam.

These cookies are great - with or without the filling. I've made them a few times and always get asked for the recipe. I find it much easier, though, to divide the dough into two equal parts, shape each piece into a ~1.5-2 inch diameter log, wrap and chill, then just slice 1/8 inch slices from each log...MUCH easier and alot less mess!

This is a great recipe! They turn out so pretty and unique with the poppy seeds. My advice: 1. They taste better the day after brought to room temperature from the frig. 2. I will use more lemon extract in the filling and possibly the cookie also next time. I'm not sure how much, only made these once. 3. I used a smaller cookie cutter but the same shape and they seemed perfect size because these are rich. To respond to someone who had trouble rolling out the dough, yes, the dough gets really hard in the frig but I just kept rolling and eventually I got it into a thin and easy to work with piece. Mine wasn't sticky. I love this site!

They may take a little time, but they are absolutely declicious!

yum. i was kindof overwhelmed by the amt of butter so decreased it by about 1/4 - and then refridgerated the dough. The best part about this recipe is using it as icebox cookies - just slice the chilled dough super thin and pop in toaster oven - they cook in about 2.5 minutes.

This is a fantastic recipe! The cookies are rather easy to make (although it was quite hard to cut out the shapes at first) and look great. They taste really nice. I got really good reviews from all my friends and family

I just made the cookies and skipped the filling and they were amazing as is. To avoid the whole rolling out the dough thing, I made the dough, shaping it into a rectangle and wrapped it in plastic wrap. I froze it for at least a half hour. Then I pulled off chunks of dough to form 1 inch balls. I arranged the balls 1 inch apart on parchment lined baking sheets. I moistened a glass with water and dipped it into sugar and pressed the dough balls to 1/4 inch thickness. The cookies baked for about 15 minutes until they were golden at the edges. Highly recommend this recipe!

These cookies were so easy to make - coming out perfectly the first time. And so delicious. Definitely a keeper.

I feel like such a loser! No one before me said they had any trouble rolling out this dough and I found it impossible to do so. It stuck to EVERYTHING. I finally rolled small balls and flattened them with a fork. Aside from this, the cookies WERE delicious! Ditto for the filling.

I wanted to make a nice assortment of cookies for Christmas, and although I'm not a fan of poppy seeds I have several family members who adore them. I made these cookies tonight & they are sooo good. The only change I made was to add more lemon extract to the filling. I'm so glad I made these cookies!

This was a big hit at my cookie exchange!! I took the advice of the review and iced them the day ahead, I sampled one then for comparison and liked the softer,next-day version best.

Wonderful cookies that I've made twice already and will make again soon. Definitely put cookies together a day ahead, chill, and serve room temp for best results. A 2 1/2 inch diameter cookie cutter made bigger cookies than seemed reasonable, so the second time around I made them about half that size and they were perfect.

I love anything with poppy seeds so maybe I am biased. I agree with Lillian from Chicago I prefer these filled the day before (or even more) when they become really soft and delectable.

Excellent. Like other reviewers, I enjoyed the cookies when softer so I put filling on a few hours in advance.

I made these for the first time as a Birthday Gift. They have now become our household favorites. My only concern is the dough is a little dry and I'm not sure what to add- more butter or a little water. We like them filled or just plain with tea.

Absolutely delicious! I loved the lemon flavor. It was definitely pronounced in the cookie. The cream cheese filling was scrumptous. I filled them a day ahead because I liked them softer instead of crisp. I will be making them again!

These were wonderful. I used heart-shaped cookie cutters and served them at a bridal shower. Although it says to assemble shortly before serving to keep them crisp, I actually thought they were even better soft, after they had been in the fridge for a day.

...MADE THESE WITHOUT THE FILLING. The cookie isn't bad; personally I thought they were tasty, but my cookie-eating family just did'nt go for them. They are my 'barometer'....won't be making these again...too much effort to have them sit on a plate uneaten!

This is the greatest lemon cookie recipe you will ever find! I tried them when I first saw them in the March '97 issue, with rave reveiws from friends. At some point I lost the recipe and couldn't remember the issue. Thanks to epicurious and Bon Appetit for making this site available.
