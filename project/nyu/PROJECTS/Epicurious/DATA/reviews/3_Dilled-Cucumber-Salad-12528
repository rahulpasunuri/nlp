I thought this was OK but nothing spectacular. I used the rice vinegar and added about 2t sugar. Will most likely not make again.

In addition to the receipe, I added about 3 Tbl of white wine vinigar to wake it up a little along w/ some fresh ground pepper and salt to taste. (I did use 2 Tbl of Lemon instead of lime and light sour cream). We could not fill our bowls fast enough, it was so good!

Nah gahah. Any edible cucumber salad must, absolutely must, involve seeding, salting, and draining. (Or else you end up with water.) This is a mistake. Try the others on the site.

this is the first recipe on this site that I found ordinary. So disappointing. Blah.

I added chopped tomatoes to it. I made this for a get together and everyone really liked it.

Very common salad in Germany except use lemon juice, not lime; add sugar as the previous writer said (it should be slightly sweet and I've found it takes between 1-3 teaspoons of sugar), add some thinly sliced Bermuda red onion - to taste, and garnish with sweet Hungarian paprika sprikled over the top. It's a wonderful hot weather side dish.

My husband loves cucumbers so I don't hestitate making new recipes but I did follow the directions and when I tasted the salad before refrigerating, I added at least 1 tsp. sugar and this certainly helped its flavor. We found the recipe very refreshing with grilled salmon.

We have an abundance of cucumbers during the growing season, so I'm always ready to try something new with them. I followed the advise of my two predecessors and substituted 2 T. seasoned rice vinegar for the lime juice, and added some dried minced onion. Quite tasty and refreshing; certainly good enough to do again.

I made this according to the recipe and found it unbelievably bland and boring. I would never have made it again. Then it occurred to me to spice it up with some seasoned rice vinegar, and the flavor just EXPLODED! Now I make it almost every week. I add 2T -- same amount as the lime juice. I've tried a lot of different vinegars, but Sushi Chef's "sushi vinegar" is the prizewinner.

This salad was great! I added minced onions to it, and my guests loved it! I would definitely recommend this one!!
