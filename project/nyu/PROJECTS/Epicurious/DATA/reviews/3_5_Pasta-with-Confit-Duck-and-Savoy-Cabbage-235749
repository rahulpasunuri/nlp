This was really tasty, but needed to be a bit "juicier". Next time I'll add a bit more water or stock. Really nice flavors. I did add shitake mushrooms. Used Tom Colicchio's Duck Confit recipe from this website.

My husband could not stop eating this. We used leftover duck legs and breast from the Crisp Roasted Duck recipe.

We love this recipe. We used about 1/2 the cabbage called for in the recipe. In addition, we added Herbs de Provence with the parsley and garlic with the onion. I don't know how easy it is to get duck confit in the States, but this is a great use of it if available. It really is a comfort food as the original recipe suggests! This will be a staple for us while living abroad.

I had duck fat in my fridge after having made duck confit a week prior so I used that to confit whole chicken legs. Rather then to make cracklings I just increased the oven temp to 375 and crisped the skin after the confit was cooked. I also used regular cabbage & fussili pasta that I already had. I carmelized the onions then added minced garlic. Next came the cabbage, and marsala wine subbed for the dry white. I deglazed with the chicken broth, added pasta, and finished off the heat with butter & parsley. I can appreciate the addition of mushrooms & lemon, but using the marsala wine elevated the flavor to my liking. I served the chicken leg atop the pasta & cabbage mixture rather than shredding. This was like good bistro fare and was a welcome change to roast chicken with a veggie side.

This dish, while tasting good, did not taste as extraordinary as it should with this amount of time and money. It was rather plain and not very interesting to my palate.

what an innovative dish. everyone loved it, even the 12 year old who normally insists on red sauce with his pasta. the campanelle pasta was a nice switch too.

Tasty and luxurious, although not the absolute best thing I've ever eaten. Based on previous reviews, I made the following alterations: added a clove of garlic and a handful of sliced shiitake with the onions; used 8 c. of cabbage but shredded it; used 3/4 lb. of pasta; doubled the butter; and added a squeeze of lemon at the end to lift the flavour. Definitely serve with the cracklings. I found that roasted beets in a balsamic vinaigrette were a perfect accompaniment.

This was amazing. Our first night of cool weather in Miami Beach and I happen to have two duck quarters from roasting a whole duck a few night ago. I followed a few suggestions from the previous reviews. I used mushrooms - dried porcini that I purchased in Italy this summer. I soaked them and mixed them in after the wine reduced. I used the porcini soaking broth instead of chicken broth. Instead of butter, I used porcini oil, drizzled over the dish at the end. Half of the recipe was more than enough for 2 people with a salad as a first course. We opened a Cakebread Cab - Vine Hill Ranch 1997 and enjoyed every last bite and sip of both! The cab was delicious, but not quite a perfect match - a sangiovese would perhaps been a better match. The only thing that I may do differently is the addition of a little more acid in the dish - a tiny bit of balsamic? More white wine? But it needs a little bit of a bright note. Not sure. This is what I'd call a keeper!

I am a transplant to Ireland from Seattle and live in a small town with only one top class restaurant. As such, I spend lots of time trying to create positive culinary experiences for my family. There is a great purveyor of whole duck in Ireland by the name of Silverhills. We often buy their whole duck and make a port/rasberry breast dish, while reserving the carcase for broth and the wings/legs for confit. While looking for a pasta dish that utilizes confit I found this one. I mostly followed the recipe. I used confit (from the reicipe on this site) for the duck and added shitake mushrooms and two small, very ripe vine tomatoes to the saute... Instead of white wine, I used dry sherry. I finished with 2-3 tablespoons of cream to give the dish a silkiness... I used bow tie pasta and left it a bit al dente... We had a 1998 Cakebread Cabernet that we had been saving for just such an occassion... We shipped the kids to a neighbor for the night and giggled with delight at the results. I will make this dish again and again..... Try this!

SOOOOO GOOOOOOD!!! Rich, delicious, and simple. I did find the original recipe a little blah, so I made a few changes: Sauteed 3.5 oz of sliced shitake mushrooms with the onions (I actually had half onion and half shallots), reduced the cabbage to about 3 cups but might increase it a little bit next time because it does cook down, made less pasta (about 3/4 of the box) and sprinkled shredded piave cheese on top (parmesean will work as well). I added about 1/2 tsp of thyme to the pot and sauteed the onions in olive oil instead of the duck fat. That I saved for later to add during the "add everything to the pasta pot" step and halved the butter. I didn't add the cracklings at the end because I forgot. Generously added black pepper before serving and - voila - perfection! Initially I was worried that my husband might not like it but he said this was gourmet restaurant quality.

I thought this was very good. I made some changes including using duck breast (I already had that), I added ginger and garlic to the onions and I also added sauteed mushrooms and sauteed grape tomatoes at the end with the duck. I used savoy cabbage and didn't find it overpowering at all.

What a waste of duck confit! The cabbage overwhelms the duck, and the main flavor is of overcooked cabbage. Bleech.

This was a wonderful dish - simple, hearty, perfect for fall. In Luxembourg, confit de canard is plentiful ad readily available. I followed the recipe with the exception of making "cracklings" from the skin (the recipe has abundant fat already and, although duck fat falls into the "heart healthy" category, it is still caloric and enough is enough). I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic with the onions and some thyme as well as the parlsey. Everyone had seconds.
