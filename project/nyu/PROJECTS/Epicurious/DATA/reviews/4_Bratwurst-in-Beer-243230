,,,the best brat to use, of course, is Johnsonville but make sure you get the uncooked version for this recipe (not precooked)

As other reviewers have noted, the process in this recipe is reversed from what I used to do - now, this is my go to recipe for brats! Grilling the brats first and then putting them in the beer/butter mixture yields moist, buttery brats that are unbeatable. However, I disagree with the instruction to use "cheap" beer. If I'm using high quality meat, why would I specifically look for cheap ingredients to add to them? I found a hearty stout worked well.

I made this for my Super Bowl Party. Unfortunately, I have a foot of snow on my grill, so I ended up making them indoors. I grilled them on the stovetop grill pan, and then finished them under the broiler. They still had that nice crispy outside. I would definitely recommend this recipe!

I don't know about anywhere else, but here in Wisconsin we take our brats very seriously. I have never, NEVER heard of/seen anybody grill their brats first and then dunk them in hot beer. Never. Its just not the way we do it in the land of cheese curds, booyah, brats, beer and the Packers. If you want to cook a brat correctly, not like some crazy driving Illinoiser, you boil the brats in the beer and onion and then grill them to delicious crispiness. None of this dunking business. And no matter what condiments you put out you always have kraut.

This was delicious! 3 1/2 forks...Everyone loved it. I only had one large good quality beer on hand (Canadian) and the onions had lots of liquid to simmer in! Couldn't imagine 4 cans...As some other reviews suggested, we also served sauerkraut as an additional topping. LOVED the combination of the onions, pickles, mustard, and sauerkraut! Very flavourful and unique...A great dish to serve while watching not only football - but hockey as well! :)

Good recipe. If you are multiplying the recipe for a crowd, don't need to up the broth as much (says the woman who made 6x the brats but only 4x the broth and still had too much)

This was really easy and a big hit. I used crusty french bread because they were out of hogies and it was still delish.

These Brats are so good. They are the perfect midwestern brat. I also always serve them with sourkraut, and mustard. My husband (from Detroit) eats ketchup on them!To each their own. They are great just as they are written!

I've been making Beer Brats like this for years. We have them every weekend in October! I usually cook the brats in the beer first, then grill 'em. No offense to my cooking cousins in Wisconsin, but I prefer a nice Heff to PBR. (I use Franziskanner religiously) VERY VERY good recipe, four forks up!

Something to note about this recipe: Bratwurst preparation varies by region in Wisconsin. In western Wisconsin, it's eaten with sauerkraut and mustard on a rye bun with sesame seeds. Also, as indicated by another reviewer, other things, such as barbeque sauce, hot sauce, or other spices can be added to the beer for additional flavoring.

I boil my brats in beer for about 5 minutes and then put them on the grill- it enhances the beer-taste and makes them super juicy.

wicked awesome recipe. the only change I made was to add some Franks Red Hot sauce in the beer. Sweet recipe, thanks.
