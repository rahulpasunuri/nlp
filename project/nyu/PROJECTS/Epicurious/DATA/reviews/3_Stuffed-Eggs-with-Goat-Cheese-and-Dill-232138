This is an interesting twist on deviled eggs. With the goat cheese, they are salty. The dill was a nice twist. It was a good way to use up the goat cheese in my fridge, but I won't be making these again.

Great for picnics and tailgating! I changed the recipe the second time by replacing the dill with tarragon- even better.

... though I should add to my previous review that the tartness of the goat cheese + the coolness of the dill make for an interesting variation on deviled eggs. Perhaps sour cream rather than milk would make for a better collusion substance.

Goat-cheese at room temperature + too much milk + not enough egg yolk = a very runny deviled egg filling. If I try this recipe again (not likely), I'd use a firmer cheese and decrease the milk.

I added a little extra goat cheese (you can never have too much cheese in my opinion!) and it was delicious - but there was a little stuffing left over. I used it the next day with a touch of tomato sauce and a tiny bit more goat cheese to fill an omelette - marvellous!

I'll never think of stuffed eggs as just a picnic food again. I topped each half with a small sprig of dill and served on a vintage cut glass plate. These are elegant and oh so tasty!

I really liked this dish and so did everyone at my bbq. I picked this recipe because of the goat cheese variation. To garnish the eggs, I added a small sliver of Nova Scotia smoked salmon, a sprig of dill, and just a little bit of cracked pepper on top. Delicious!

These were good. Really just a slight variation from regular deviled eggs, replacing goat cheese for the mayo. And as far as I am concerned, goat cheese is always a welcome addition to anything! I added some thyme (no dill in the house) and did sprinkle paprika on the top. I don't think Gourmet mag would mind, tho it might confuse some others! :)

I think that the recipe does not have "deviled" in the title because that brings forth associations with 1950's-style mustard, mayonnaise, and pickle relish stuffed eggs with paprika on top--not exactly the stuff of "Gourmet" magazine. Anyway, I am always looking for variations on the stuffed egg because they are always a hit at parties (in my crystal deviled egg tray!), and this one was very good. I'll make it again.

To the two reviewers going on about "deviled," I don't see "deviled" in the title of the recipe at all. This sounds really great. Will try!

Wonderful combination of ingredients-however, I reduced the mustard to 1/4 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. mayonaise instead. Along with the dill, I added a pinch of fresh ground pepper. Everyone loved it.
