Beets have to be one of the most underrated vegetables in the garden. Had I known how easy this would be, I would have made it years ago. I like the idea of onions - I feel naked cooking without them. Will try that next time. I sauteed the greens with a slice of bacon and a tablespoon of vinegar & sugar. Fabulous. Healthy.

i found this borscht slightly boring. the potatoes and sour cream are ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL; otherwise it is basically boiled sliced beets in water; the eggs are not noticeable to the palate. i would add dill as a garnish, unquestionably. and in the soup, too, i have had borscht many times that way. also would add more lemon juice. i would make it again only if adding some other little ingredients to add sizzle. i added sauteed onions which were delicious but that may be very unorthodox

I first tried the Variation using canned beets, just about 1/4 of a lemon, a pinch of citric acid, a little sugar, & the 1 1/2 C water. I was not at all happy with this -- for me, it's much too much water & had very little flavor. So I added the following to the canned cooked beets: a chopped medium onion (from Molly Goldberg's old cookbook), 2 medium whole fresh peeled beets plus about 2 1/2 to 3 C more water (added in small amounts) & almost 1/4 tspn citric acid. I cooked all this 1 hour, chopped all the hot beets into julienne strips including the canned beets, (easier & safer for my hands than trying to chop the hard raw beets), tasted & reseasoned. I needed no added sugar with the fresh beets. Now the flavor was quite strong & sweet, & I could add a little more water by 1/2 cups. I let the whole mess cook about 30 minutes longer, again tasted & reseasoned, chilled the soup & served with plain yoghurt & a little chopped chive sprinkled on. My aim in beet borscht (or cabbage soup) is a definite bright, sweet-&-sour flavor...a matter of balancing the sweet beets with the citric acid little by little, & not letting it get too watered down. I'd never make the borscht again without that chopped onion which gave it more depth & real flavor, and I prefer the citric acid for my "sour" to the more specific flavor of much lemon. I used to drip in the beaten egg but don't bother with it any more so the soup lasts longer without spoiling.

I made this for my in-laws who absolutely loved it. It's not really my thing, but my father-in-law said it was just like his mother used to make it.

Great soup, easy to make with the right tools (in my case a sharp knife and good whisk). I didn't have the sour salt on hand and wish I had--I think it would have made a difference. Added in some white balsamic vinegar upon eating to get a bit more kick. VERY refreshing on a hot summer's day. For anyone concerned about working with the eggs, just add the hot soup to the eggs very slowly and whisk vigorously so that you don't cook the eggs. It's quite simple if you take it slowly.

I had no idea how hard it could be to grate beets without a food processor. I had beet spray everywhere. I thought this recipe was great for its simplicity, but after I looked at some other recipes with more vinegar and onions, I was wishing for more. The eggs definitely make a big difference in this soup. I also thought the addition of potatoes afterwards was a must (and sour cream of course). I would make this again, but it was a bit of a labor of love for my first borscht experience.

There are many variations of cold beet soup depending on your country of origin. Eastern Europeans do not use eggs in that fashion. Rather, after the beets are cooked and their cooking juice cooked and saved the process begins. My grandmother used to dice cucumbers (get rid of the seeds) scallions, fresh dill and add them to sour cream. Take the mixture and put it in the soup that you are going to consume at the time. Some people add buttermilk. Hard cook eggs to taste are finely chopped and added as are hot boiled potato pieces. That's the way I remember it and that's the way my kids eat it, minus the eggs.

I love this recipe. I have made it twice and the old fashioned technique of the mixing by bowls is very cool. I enjoy cold soups and this one is fantastic!

Closest to what I remember my mother making. I agree with other reviewer...I used 3 T. cider vinegar to start, added another and the taste was very good. Also, the tops of the fresh beets were so fresh and beautiful, I chopped some and added them as well.

use some vinegar instead of the lemon
