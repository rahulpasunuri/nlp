how do you manage to mix the caramel and popcorn so it's spread evenly before the caramel cools and hardens? Half of it was like popcorn brittle and the other half had barely any caramel.

good, but watch out for your dental work! tastes like the popcorn that comes in big tins at Christmas time.

Just made this. I used gas heat. Boiled for 8 minutes. Used exact recipe. Was concerned that there wasn't going to be enough popcorn but it was enough. No candy thermometer. Wasn't too chewy. Perfect. Used peanuts. Husband loved them. Eat with hot drink to wash off the caramel stuck on your teeth. Will use this recipe again!

I have made this countless times, varying the type of nuts, adding chocolate, granola, salt etc. It's so easy and it's perfect! I never use a thermometer, just time it. Trust me.

Well I also have made caramel(s) several times and this did not turn out for me either. I timed the caramel to 8 minutes and pulled it just shy because it was at 290 and looking way too dark. I checked it with two different trusty thermometers. I went ahead and finished the recipe but it is too dark and tastes off. So something somewhere is off... I used medium heat, it called for moderate. Maybe the difference is in how high the heat used. I may try this again but go with 270-280 instead or I will move onto another recipe.

Really easy, and really tasty. I made it just as the recipe called for, and without a thermometer, using the time suggested in the recipe. Would most definitely make this again. A lot of fun for a Memorial Day barbecue.

Made this without a thermometer. It turned out well, but next time I will make sure to stir the popcorn and caramel very well and spread the popcorn out in a thinner layer. I might also make more popcorn or less caramel. I felt like the popcorn had too much caramel on it that made it hard to chew, but it did taste delicious.

I just want to clarify that I put the entire mixture (popcorn, peanuts and caramel) in the oven after deciding that the texture was wrong.

Rating: 0
I didn't rate this because I didn't follow the instructions exactly. I did follow the ingredients exactly, but then based on other reviews I only heated the caramel to 260. The flavor was delicious, but it was far too chewy to work well on popcorn. I spread all of it out on a baking sheet and put it in the oven at 300 for 15 minutes (stirring once) and after that it was perfect! You may want to try this if yours turns out with too much chew and not enough crunch.

My first attempt at caramel and this was easy and so yummy. I made this and fleur de sel toffee for holiday treats for my coworkers and neighbors. I'm really happy with how they turned out. I used a mix of pistachios, cashews and almonds instead of peanuts and it's delish. I think I'm going to make another batch for friends and family, too.

I followed the recipe exactly and this came out perfect. I was surprised by how simple it was. I'll definitely make this again and experiment with different nuts and flavors in the future!

I completely mismatched the proportions (more popcorn, less peanuts, honey instead of corn syrup) - it was still very good, but next time I will skip the peanuts. I felt obliged to warn everyone about them (in case of allergies), and didn't feel they added much to the taste. But it's a delicious recipe, and I was surprised by how fast and easy it was to make! Will definitely be making it again :)

The person who's very experienced at making caramel must not be very experienced. This came out perfectly at the right temperature (of which I had to translate to celcius, so ppfftt one more step and I could still do it). I used pecans which I toasted myself and it was so delicious. I packed them into handball sized portions and now my husband can pack them in his lunches with the fruit cups I make him. Yes.

Yum! I think it's unnecessary to cook it to 300 -- I went to about 260-270 (about 5 minutes, right about at a soft crack on my thermometer, although I didn't test it in water) and it has a nice caramel taste, and snaps apart easily.

Yummy! I made this as directed (cooking caramel closer to 8 minutes) and added some vanilla. Was a little chewy at first but it crisps up as it cools - either way it was great.

My friends can't get enough of this! They beg me to make it and can't stop eating it. Huge hit and really easy. I spread it out on a large teflon coated griddle I have that I first spray with butter flavored food release. Easy cleanup and don't have to waste foil.

Really great recipe! I used toasted pecans instead of peanuts, add some dried cranberries, and after everything is cooled, drizzle with melted bittersweet chocolate. Then break into chunks.

I live above 6700 feet altitude,so I stir all candy when making because of the longer time to reach the 280' for this recipe. I used white sugar, added 11/2 tsp kosher salt, vanilla (good pour) and chocolate chips and heath bar crunch bits....no nuts. Beyond good. Good kid and PMS chow....The white sugar gives a nice blond color to the snack, and a lighter flavor. The added salt gives a nice contrast to the sweet. Nice gift for Valentines Day!

Really, I can't believe this received so many positive reviews. I am very experienced at making caramel and this had a burnt flavor to it that made it really unpleasant to eat. Perhaps it is the brown sugar...I would try it again with white granulated sugar. Also, it is KEY to remove any unpopped kernels before mixing into the caramel....

Rating: 4
Easy and great recipe to make when you're on a budget but want to give something special for friends/family. I added extra fine salt after the kernels were popped; cooked the caramel until 280F; and put pecans/cashews instead of peanuts. I did not spray the foil and the clusters didn't stick.

Yum. Yum. Yum. Easy to make and delish! My five year old helped measure ingredients and I did the rest. The blueberries some poster suggested were awesome! We subbed nuts for roasted/salted pumpkin seeds for one batch and roasted/salted soy nuts for a second. This will be a regular holiday item at our house!

300 degrees is just too long! went up to 280 degrees and it smelled burnt, and tasted a little that way too. Overall the ingredients are good, I would boil the sugar no more than 4 minutes. Also I think added a teaspoon of vanilla would be good too. If you use microwave popcorn, make sure you take out the kernals that are unpopped.

I made 2 batches of this over the weekend. It was really easy to whip up and tasted great! On my second try, I added a bit more salt (1 1/8 tsp) and I used sunflower seeds instead of peanuts. I also used a blend of white sugar and brown sugar because I didn't have enough brown sugar and the caramel came out just fine.

This is a great recipe! Made it for a Halloween party and it was eaten faster by the adults than the kids. I had to stand over the thermometer, though, because it almost burned as it got close to 300 degrees.

I respectfully disagree with the characterization of this recipe by bmassey from San Francisco ("This deserves no forks. The burned taste was overwhelming. The peanuts added nothing. I would rather have Cracker Jacks."). I suspect this description may have resulted from burning the caramel, since, when properly made, this recipe has no burnt taste. The statement that "peanuts added nothing," is likewise puzzling, because the addition of peanuts manifestly adds something -- peanuts. Also, the statement that "I would rather eat Cracker Jack" implies some similarity with that insipid, burnt, saccharine-sweet product. However, the product of this recipe is tastes absolutely nothing like Cracker Jack. This description almost threw me off, so I wanted to warn others of its patent unreliability.

Warning, if you eat too much, it'll make your mouth raw. But it's worth it. I like a chewier caramel, so I've been adding 1/2 the corn syrup it calls for. I've been using dark brown sugar because I had it on hand. I leave out the nuts, and because I don't have a thermometer, I cook it by smell and viscosity. This is delicious. At the very end, I add maybe a tsp of vanilla. I've also experimented with adding liqueurs such as amaretto and grand mariner for additional flavor. I bet whiskey might add an interesting depth of flavor to this fabulous treat.

Fantastic! Used honey instead of corn syrup and it all came out wonderfully. Great taste & candy-like, crisp texture.

Really wonderful. For those curious if using less caramel works well, it does. I used about 10 cups of popped corn, almost a cup of peanuts, and made a half batch of the caramel. It gave the corn a delicate, crisp layer of caramel, and full coverage.

Fantastic! Doubled the recipe and used salted pistachios because I couldn't find peanuts. Made this for a Halloween party and everyone loved it. The leftovers (yes, there were some) got a bit soft after the first day but were still very much edible. Easy recipe (I used no thermometer, just kept the sugar mixture on a very low boil for a few minutes and kept and eye on it). No problem with burning or sticking -- just soaked the stock pot afterward and it cleaned easily. Highly recommended recipe!

I doubled the recipe and made it in a large stock pot. Delightful! Immediately afterwards, I filled the pot with water and baking soda to boil off the caramel. Works like a charm.

These are excellent. I made them with cashews instead of peanuts. Be careful not to burn the caramel - my thermometer didn't read 300 and it started smoking. My mother-in-law became addicted to them.

Just made this and it is delicious! I don't have a candy thermometer so am always worried about making caramel. The key is to bring the sugar, butter, corn syrup to a boil SLOWLY. I kept the temp on med-low, and then boiled for 8mins only. Very tasty!

Made this for an outdoor movie night and everyone loved it. Followed the recipe, but omitted nuts and added a blend of cinnamon, cayenne and Kashmiri curry with the salt and baking soda. It was sweet, salty and spicy--my favorite combination. Also, made this with microwave popcorn and this recipe was perfect for 1 bag.

Good warning about the burn potential; however, it still didn't save me from myself! I added 1 t. vanilla & 2 T. blackstrap molasses to the recipe with the salt, etc. I also successfully used the microwave shortcut. Quick, easy, & delicious!

I have to respectfully disagree with the characterization of this recipe as a "Cracker Jack tasting carmel." (A Cook from Gig Harbor). I suspect this description was intended to distinguish the product from other specific types of caramel corn. However, it should be clarified that the product of this recipe is tastes absolutely nothing like Cracker Jack and doesn't remotely resemble that insipid, burned, overly sweet product in any way. I used this recipe a couple of years ago, and couldn't find it in my file. I vaguely recalled that I'd seen it on Epicurious, so I checked. This was the only recipe on the website, but after I read this review, I thought "this couldn't possibly be the same recipe." However, I later found the recipe, tucked into a Gourmet Magazine, and it was, indeed, the same. Let me assure you again that the end product of this recipe bears no resemblance whatsoever to Cracker Jack. Banish the thought from your mind and try it!

If you are looking for a 'Cracker Jack' tasting carmel corn, then this is the recipe for you. Good, but not what I was looking for. I needed to make 12 gifts in a hurry, and carmel corn is my favorite candy. After 5 double batches of carmel corn, in a variety of ways - I found a recipe that I think taste better. I air popped 1 c. of kernals- popped. Orville Redenbacher brand is the best & the kernals puff up more than the store brand. In a suacepan bring to boil 3c. sugar, 1c. water, 1 1/2 Tb. of Kosher salt, 3 Tb butter. Boil until a carmel color 10- 20 minutes. The temp should be around 260*-300* I am using a propane gas range, which I gauged around med.- low. I don't know what an electric range temperature would be. I had to turn the temp down, so check while cooking, but do not stir. Watch that the carmel doesn't burn. Remove from the heat and add 1 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp vanilla & stir. Pour over the popped corn. I added about a cup of nuts. Spread on a parchment paper or foil. I lightly sprayed with oil, you may want to omit the oil. This recipe is lower in fat, so I figure it's the lesser of two evils. I won't be making the above recipe again. I hope this helps.

I have this same recipe but mine calls for finishing it in the microwave! You cook the syrup on the stove and boil it for only 2 minutes. The popcorn is put into a PAPER grocery bag that is trimmed to fit into your microwave. You pour the syrup over the popcorn and microwave for 1 1/2 minutes on High. Shake the bag and microwave for one more minute. Spread on a baking sheet and that's it! You don't have to cook the syrup to 300 degrees for 10 minutes as the microwave does it for you! I couldn't believe it when I first read this recipe, but believe me it works and it's WONDERFUL!

I am IN LOVE with this recipe! Be careful when you are pouring the popcorn it is VERY HOT!!!!!!!!! I used mixed nuts and it is wonderful! It is even great without nuts! The carmel doesn't have a funky taste and this is such an easy recipe! I am 100% making this one again!

Good Stuff!!! Made this for my trick-or-treaters and put in the decorative Halloween bags. I know they'll love it. I made a second batch for the adults using fancy mixed nuts. I'm going to make this for Christmas gifts...it's that good! Be very careful when stirring the carmel onto the popcorn...mixture is EXTREMELY HOT! Did okay the first batch, but got careless with the second, and have a huge blister on my hand where some of the caramel slopped over. OOOOWWWWWWIE!

This recipe was awesome! I've made it several times now and it always turns out great. Just a little tip about adding the nuts. If you add them to the popcorn before adding the caramel, then most of them will end up at the bottom of the bowl. So, just put them in gradually as you pour the caramel in. Other than that I didn't change a thing!! Thanks for this recipe - love it!

You will see that when you add the baking soda, the caramel mixture gets foamy. I think it allows the caramel to spread evenly and result in a crispier "shell" on the popcorn.

A great family recipe. I prefer less caramel to more nuts / popcorn. The caramel is very sweet and will otherwise overpower popcorn. Be very careful to remove unpopped kernels from the mix.

An experienced cook, but not a candy maker, I decided to try this. The mix reached 300 in exactly 10 minutes. Removed from heat, whisk fell in, and in the time it took to get it out, the caramel thickened and burned. Black goop! I will try again but not right away. Beware of slipping utensils...

if your sugar went grainy, it may mean that you let it boil before all the sugar was disolved. next time try heating it more slowly, and don't stir it with a spoon! swirl the pan around, so you aren't dropping the temperature of the sugar with a cold spoon or sudar crystals. hope that helps
