This is the cookie I send my son on deployment. I make them small enough to pack in a pringles can. He rations them out until his next box. We love this cookie.

Hi again.... I made the cookies but semi- melted the butter and found that with melting the butter it makes a crunchier cookie but then again i think i used the wrong type of butter lol... there good... better when microwaved for warm choclaty taste... soft center crunchy outside.... tell me what u think...

My cousin made them at family reunion one year and they were amazing. I will be making them today and am happy to say that i am very excited!! i will be melting the butter instead of leaving it chunking.... will review again and tell you outcome!!

These are great. My 5yo daughter and I revised the recipe to a "Cowgirl" variety using light brown sugar and replacing 1/2 the chocolate chips w/ butterscotch chips. Make sure oven rack is in middle of the oven!

This is a good cookie--and depending on what you like in a cookie, it could be great. It's very crispy around the edges, and if you bake until it's just barely done, it's still soft in the middle. It's a little on the dry side, but it does have quite a lot of texture from the oats and nuts. If that's what you like, you'll love this. I prefer a cookie with the potential to be a little bit chewy, though. I akso expected a more complex flavor, given the oatmeal and nuts, but if anything, it tastes less buttery than it's simple cousin, the tollhouse cookie. I'm not sure whether I'll use this recipe again.

This is a great cookie. I have made it several ways. One of my favorite is to use crasins and golden raisins instead of chocolate chips. That is a great taste with the toasted walnuts.

Rating: 4
These turned out really good - we had to ration them out so we didn't eat too many. We added 3/4 cup coconut. Next time, we'll use less flour & more oats to improve the texture.

Theese are the best cookies ever! I recomend theese to all who like just a smidgen of coconut. The blend of all the different ingredients is awsome

These had a great flavor but I thought they were a bit on the dry side. No one else must have noticed because I took them to a picnic and they were all gone in a flash.

I have always loved the classic toll house cookies but sometimes you just want to throw everything into the mix... and that is what I did. Followed the recipe except halved the sugar and added half a cup of toasted (with the nuts) coconut which has its own sweetness. Also added half cup of raisins, tsp. of cinnamon and a handful of white chocolate chips that needed using..Even with the extras they hold together well. Because I made them bite size there was no need to grease cookie sheet The best cookies!!!

These were awesome...I added a extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla for some more flavor...next time will try with a little coconut

Is this not the ancestral oatmail chocolate chip cookie recipe of anyone else's grandmother? I called mine looking for the recipe I remember from the Ford administration, and she said they were cowboy cookies, and then rattled off, from 50-year-old notes, taken down from a "girl from work" (this would be a Cleveland tool -and-die shop in the 60s) a recipe almost exactly as described here. With one exception--the craze for cookies the size of dinner plates is a phenomenon of airport coffee shops and prisons. A cookie should be three bites. I sympathize with the toddler mentioned below. These should be small. They are perfect little pieces of old-time love. Also, oatmeal gives them body that the straight- up choco-chip can't touch. This is what a cookie should be. Now will somebody please describe where the cowboys got their walnuts?

Not sure what all the rave reviews are all about. I thought this was a pretty basic and mediocre cookie recipe.

Rating: 4
Quality of ingredients matters (with this recipe and all recipes!)! I use Billington's sugar (REAL brown sugar, not just colored refined white sugar), pure vanilla (not vanilla flavoring), organic eggs, butter, etc. Also I use Penzey's fantastic cinnamon as an added ingredient (www.penzeys.com if you haven't discovered these spices, you need to!) and Ghiradelli 60% chocolate chips. The flavors never fade but I also make them as small, regular cookies and take them out of the oven when they don't look quite done - this is KEY! They are chewy and fantastic and everyone always loves them! Toast your nuts before (350 for about 10 minutes) and this will add additional flavor as well but I don't always use the nuts.

These cookies are delicious. I can't keep my freezer stocked--they are a hit with all my friends and family.

Nothing special, only the bites with the chocolate chips in them were good. Try a different recipe

I've made these twice and think they are fantastic. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine, but followed everything else. Cooking time is more like 15-17 minutes and the yield for me has been 25. They are just GREAT and even days after I made them, they were soft, chewy and delicious.

Very good, but not as outstanding as I had hoped. I'll make them again, but I'll tinker with the recipe to see if I can improve on it.

A great recipe! This is my new go-to recipe for all-butter chocolate chip cookies. I'm a sucker for the look and texture of half-butter/half-shortening cookies but I'm looking for all-butter options to reduce trans fats. These are a perfect solution--the oatmeal gives the cookies a nice, consistent shape and thickness (no thin edges, etc.) without overpowering the classic chocolate chip taste. I skipped the fridge time and baked them right away; they were fantastic.

This is definitely a go-to cookie recipe for me. Everyone loves them and they are so easy to make. One tip: I always have to bake mine 2 minutes more or they come out too soft. I also added some cinnamon to the dough and then divided the dough in half before the addition of the chocolate chips and walnuts. In one half, I added chocolate chips; in the other, I added raisins. They were a great treat for my Saturday running group after a hard workout!

Rating: 3
This is a good, solid cookie. I rolled out 1/8 cup balls instead of 1/4 cup balls and somehow came out with 5 dozen. I wouldn't want them bigger, cause they're very filling what with the oatmeal and all. I did not grease the pans, but used parchment instead because I am lazy. Next time I think I'll double the vanilla- they need something to make them great, instead of just good. Well, they're better than good. Maybe grood?

I just finished eating a fresh baked one of these cookies and they are delicious. I love oatmeal-raisin cookies, but these are a great combination for when I'm craving chocolate chip. I made cookies half the size and baked them for 12 minutes. Definately the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever had, and I've tried quite a few recipes lately.

I made these cookies every two weeks for my husband. Just the two of us, so I froze them with wonderful results. He savored them with his scoop of vanilla ice cream as the crowning touch to his supper. PS, the uncooked batter is the tops.

Rating: 4
This cookie has my family crazy for them. I have played with it and have added trailmix to the recipe in place of the nuts and they turned out great. I have to make a double batch just to have enough. I have discovered that if I make a ball out of the dough and then flatten, the fruit does not burn as easily.

Rating: 4
These cookies are the best! I made them with 1/4 cup dough the first time and the cookies were HUGE! I wanted to make them for a party so I wanted a greater quantity of smaller cookies. Use 1/8 of a cup (2 tbsp) of dough per cookies...smoosh them down like the recipe says..bake at the same temp and flip the pan around at 8 minutes. Bake them for a total of about 12 minutes...or until the edges are light brown. Perfect!

I love this recipe! It is by far my favorite cookie recipe. All of my friends love it. I make it more than Toll House. It is like the ultimate chocolate chip cookie - really hearty. I am actually making some this week for a church fundraiser. I plan to make enough for samples because the cookies will be auctioned off. Yummy!

I omitted the chocolate chips and walnuts as I didn't have them on hand...but the results were still terrific. The result: chewy, toffee-flavored cookies! I also made my cookies smaller, using a tablespoon measure, and baked them slightly less than 10 minutes. The cookies were great and I enjoyed the grainy, chewy texture (even without the chocolate and nuts)!

I love these cookies! My kids love these cookies! Everyone loves these cookies!! I have made these half a dozen times now and will continue to make them again and again. I have also made them substituting 3/4 cup golden raisens and 1/2 cup dried cranberries for the chocolate chips and that tastes great too!! A real keeper!!

I took these to a family last night and already this morning I have had 2 separate phone calls. One from a friend who said they thought she had made them and were ready to kiss her feet, and a call from another friend who called the "the cookie heard round the world"! I made them as written (a tiny bit smaller) and will definitely make them again :)

This is a great base cookie recipe! Not being a particular fan of nuts, I left those out. I then split the batch in 1/2 and added white and semi-sweet chocolate chunks to one 1/2 and rehydrated dried cranberries and white chocolate chunks to the other 1/2. I made the first batch as large as the recipe had indicated and the second ones I scaled down a bit so they would feed more people. The cookies got rave reviews! Several people thought they were from a bakery. Very good recipe that can be easily adapted.

Gosh, so good...gosh, so big! My 3 year said "just too much" and couldn't finish his one....lol. One suggestion...would reduce the flour by one half cup...all of it would not mix in for me.

I made the first batch as directed, and they were very good. On the second batch I followed a couple of suggested variations - added coconut (dessicated) and didn't flatten them nearly so much - and they were BOY HOWDY! The bestest ever! This is our new very favoritest cookie ever, at least in the words of our 3 YO.

Yee-Ha! These cookies are always a favorite! I've made this recipe at least a dozen times and each time I've produced large, chewy, delicious cookies. However, I don't chill my dough and I use macadamia nuts instead of walnuts.

My husband loved these! I really enjoyed these, too, although I usually like a chewier cookie. I only chilled the dough for 1/2 hour. I measured 1/4 cup rounds but didn't flatten them because another cook said his were flat and blah, but boy were they thick and chunky! I would add more chocolate chips (I didn't use walnuts).

A good recipe, not the best. As an experiment, I took my last two and made them slightly smaller than a lacrosse ball (about 1/3 cup of dough), rounded it, and plopped it on the pan. I flattened it only a little (about 1.5/2" thick) and baked in a convection oven for 14 min at 325. BIG FAT COOKIE with a very moist center. That's how I'll do it next time.

I'm always looking for great cookie recipes and when I came across this I made them right away. They were good but not great to my family and I. I didn't add the walnuts and maybe because of that they turned out really chewy. I would make these again, but they are not my favorites. By the way, if any or you have a great cookie recipe please forward. Yes, I already have the chocolate toffee cookie recipe.

These were delicious. My boys (including my husband)loved them. They were crispy around the edges and chewy in the middle. However, I think I may even give a four fork after I try it with toasted nuts! (didn't have any). Also, a bit sweet, I may cut down on the sugar! All and all very YUMMY!

I made these one snowy day, and they were just the thing to go with hot chocolate. I didn't have walnuts on hand, so I used chopped pecans and almonds instead, and they added nice texture. Also, the only chocolate chips I had on hand were milk chocolate, and while the cookies came out well with those, I think semi-sweet chocolate would have been much better. These cookies are HUGE! I think I got 16 out of the batch. I took the rest to the office the next day, and they were gone in seconds. Folks are asking for more!
