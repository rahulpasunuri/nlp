Really good! I added veggie broth and didn't use the rind. This was surprisingly tasty.

A lot of work for a satisfactory soup. In fairness, I let it get a little to thick at the end.

This recipe turned out much better than I expected. I would recommend halving the amount of olive oil that is stirred in just prior to pureeing the soup. I used the full amount and definitely felt like the oily flavor stood out too much. I completely disagree with whomever said that he thought the Parmigiano rind was unnecessary. Especially in a tomato-less soup, you want something rich in glutamates for that meaty, robust flavor. Don't skip it.

Wow! I just had this soup for dinner and it was so, so good! I did a few things differently: my store didn't have cranberry beans (which I thought was really strange!) so I used white northern beans. And I _did_ drain the water when they were done soaking. I've heard this can reduce beans' gasiness, so I figured I'd try it. When it came time to add the soaking liquid back in I used 4 cups of vegetable broth, 1 cup of tomato juice from canned tomatoes that I had leftover from a previous recipe, and 4 cups of water. I figured the water had to have been reduced from cooking the beans by at least a cup. I probably used a bit more water than was supposed to be there because I didn't have the thin the soup at all, even after pureeing. It was a perfect thickness. I would ease up a bit on the salt next time making it (though of course my broth and tomato juice added some salt). I liked it but I generally like a lot of salt, so I think other people might prefer less. I also didn't add the remaining 1/4 cup oil or 2 tbsp oil. I might have if I had an especially flavorful oil on hand but I didn't so I didn't think it worthwhile. This was an amazing soup. I think it's my new winter stand-by, especially for packing for lunch. It covers all the basics and it's so healthy if you leave out some of the oil. Next time I think I'll also grate some parmesan in (in addition to using the rind) to round out the flavor a bit more.

Has anyone made this without using the soaking water? I'm thinking that would have a huge effect on the taste, but I don't like incorporating bean-soaking liquid because gut bacteria just love the sugars that soak out of the bean casing. (One reason that beans have such an odoriferous reputation!) So my temptation would be to dump the soaking liquid and use new water or broth - anyone have thoughts on this?

This was delicious! I did make a few changes - I used christmas lima beans instead of the borlotti because that's what I had on hand in my pantry. I also added a few bay leaves when I began to soak the beans to aid with digestion and add a little extra flavor. Additionally, I added a little more garlic, rosemary and parsley than the recipe called for - and I used less oil than the recipe called for because I didn't feel it needed it and felt all that oil would coat the tongue and mask some of the flavors. The pasta did not appeal to me so I did not add it. I did have some freshly made corn bread which we found went very well with the soup. Finally, I did not add the the rind and didn't feel that I needed it. This soup was a big hit and I will make it again.

I forgot to rate recipe. The recipe is for a simple, plain, nourishing soup.

If you like the flavor of white beans and you like the flavor of a good pasta plain, then you will like this soup. If you find white beans and pasta flavorless or too dull for you, then you won't like the soup. This is again a case of "consider the ingredients before you make the recipe." The cheese rind contributes a good bit of flavor and is, I think, necessary. Be sure to put enough salt into the pasta cooking water, and make sure that you have salted the soup enough before you add the cooked pasta to it. Still, if you don't like plain dishes, this one isn't for you.

This was EXTREMELY delicious. The only reason I do not give it 4 forks is that, because the prior reviewer said it was bland, I used homemade vegetable stock instead of water. Also, I used a pecorino romano rind, and it disintegrated while simmering, so I had nothing to remove before pureeing. So I feel I can't rate the recipe exactly as written. But I really do feel this is a great recipe, and would be great with some decent organic storebought veggie stock, too. I'll be making it again that way, for sure.

This was pretty dissapointing. Not much flavor at all.........needed much more rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper. Maybe stock instead of just water. Would not make it again.
