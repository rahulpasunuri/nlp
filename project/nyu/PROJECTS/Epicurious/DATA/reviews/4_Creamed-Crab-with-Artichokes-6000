I want to try this recipe but am bewildered by the 18 X 28-inch baking dish. My oven is not even that big! Assuming it is a typo, what would the correct pan size? Thank you!

Oh, this is recipe is rich. I made the entire recipe for two people. Fits nicely into two single-serving oval au gratin dishes. I can see why another reviewer had to make twice the amount of sauce. The sauce is rather thick, I would thin it next time with a milk. The amount of salt called for in this recipe could be reduce to one teaspoon. I topped this dish with parmasean and broiled until browned. An amazing dish for company. I would defininately make it again.

I'm sure this recipe' best with the whipping cream but it is delicious and guilt-free with fat-free cream.

I loved this recipe! it was a great hit. I ended up making two sets of rue because as I was coating the layer of crab I realized it wasn't enough to do three layers and I was looking for a creamy consistency. I used artichokes and mushrooms together, and with the two portions of rue, it ended up being a very rich and delicious crab dip dish.

With the price of crab, I only buy one pound a year, so I was looking for a special recipe. I measured everything carefully and made only a half-recipe which I baked in an 8" square pan. I served it with rice but was a bit disappointed that there was not as much liquid as I had expected, judging from a previous comment. I took the hint from someone else of sprinkling with bacon and some Parmesan cheese - excellent idea. I'm not sorry I made it, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations, which were very high.

Holy rich cream dish!!!!!! It was good but EXTREMELY rich. Too much so. I liked it but didn't love it.

This was very rich and delicious. I would suggest putting it in puff pastry shells as the sauce is a little on the runny side or serving it over rice. I will definitely make it again.

This is a rich and delicious recipe. The only adjustment I made was reducing the salt to 1 tsp.

I was raised in the Chesapeake Bay country, and love nothing better than crab. This recipe was excellent. I took this to a party and it was a smashing hit. I only deviated a little. Before baking, I garnished with a few strips of roasted red pepper strips, cooked crumbled bacon and parmesan cheese. if you love crab, you will love this, use real crab, this dish was decadent!!!
