The end result did not justify the amount of time and effort required to make this recipe. I used canned beans instead of dry beans to avoid the overnight soaking, which was fine. Major problem was that there was not enough liquid by the end, so I had to add chicken broth. The soup was not very flavorful... if I ever make this again (which I likely won't), I would reserve some of the prosciutto/garlic/fennel seed broth for the soup rather than using it all for the polenta.

I must say that I used kale instead of escarole because the store didn't have it. Still, I think I am able to tell a good soup recipe from an okay one. This soup needed much more liquid and the flavor wasn't like that of a soup that first has its ingredients sauteed and simmered for longer so the flavors develop. I think a soup needs to be simmered with a bay leaf or a Parmesan rind or a meat bone or bouillion to really taste good. My polenta didn't come out right at all. After whisking in the cornmeal and letting it sit, there was a thick layer of corn at the bottom and an inch of water on top. I stirred and broke up the lumps as best as I could and cooked it for a little longer. I knew it was too thin when I poured it onto the baking sheet. I still baked it but the flavor was not good to me. I don't like the flavor of meat boiled in water. Again, I think if the prosciutto was sauteed a bit before adding the water, it would be better. I think I would stick to my Italian grandma's polenta recipe and then bake it or let it cool on a plate before slicing. I do like the red pepper and fennel seeds in the polenta, though.
