These were great cookies, especially when I changed up the original recipe (taking the advice of other people who had made these and made their own changes). This recipe probably should be edited to include granulated sugar (1/4 cup). I made these for my friend and he loved these, I used a combination of different nuts and dried fruit: peanuts, almonds, macadamia nuts with blueberries and cherries. This is a great recipe idea. I also didn't use the shortening. I am going to make these again soon and I'm going to try refrigerating some of the dough.

Also, I forgot to mention that I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and used all butter instead of the shortening. I found the cookies sweet enough because of the raisins, and also the coconut is sweetened.

These cookies turned out really well. I did not have enough brown sugar, so I used 1/2 granulated and 1/2 honey. Also, instead of chocolate chips, I added pumpkin and sunflower seeds. They were much more "trail mixy" this way and very tasty.

These cookies are great, but I did change it up a bit... I used applesauce instead of the shortening, whole wheat flour, dried blueberries and dark chocolate. Reciepe was easy and can be changed up in 100s of way.. definetly a keeper

I used all butter instead of the butter and shortening and substituted sweetened cranberries for the raisins. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I absolutely love the idea of these cookies, but this recipe is awful. If I am ever brave enough to make these again i will definitely add a lot more flour and much less butter.

We ate these within a few days, but I didn't think they were taht great. I substituted chunky peanut butter for the shortening and used mini Reese's peanut butter chips and had to forgo the raisins. No need to grease the cookie sheets.

This can be a great cookie if you make a few adjustments to the recipe. Otherwise, you may be dissappointed. I omitted the shortening and added 1/4 white sugar, an additional 1/4 cup flour and an additional 1/2 cup oatmeal. I also substituted the peanuts for walnuts and added some dried blueberries. If you make this recipe as directed, you will end up with a very flat and unsubstantial cookie. I think I will also try toasting the coconut and nuts next time. I rated this recipe a two, because while it tastes good and is an excellent idea, it really does need some tweaking.

I love these cookies, but I don't like peanuts or raisins, so I substitute walnuts and dried cherries. Yum! I do add the extra sugar, too.

I didn't love these cookies. They were not sweet enough, and I found the whole peanuts overwhelming. If I made them again, I would definitley add the white sugar, and chop the peanuts.

My favorite oatmeal cookie! Try using mini M&M's instead of chocolate chips.

These are my favorite oatmeal cookies. I use this same recipe which is printed in my Gourmet cookbook. However, that recipe has a 1/4 cup of granulated sugar in addition to the brown sugar. I wonder if it was accidently left out of the ingredient list here as the directions says to cream sugars (plural). It seems to have gotten good reviews this way however, so add the extra sugar if you like.

I thought these were great... if you like your cookies thicker and chewier, refrigerate the dough for 15 minutes or so before baking and then roll into balls and flatten only slightly before baking. Following the recipe instructions yields a thinner, crisper cookie. As I was making them for my daughter with food allergies, I omitted the peanuts, used toasted unsweetened coconut and Scharffen Berger chocolate (9 oz. baking bars which are dairy free and cut nicely into chunks). I also substituted the egg with 1 T. ground flax mixed with warm water with an additional teaspoon of baking soda, which worked out quite nicely.

These cookies are a huge hit and I've passed the recipe on many times! Un-chopped peanuts are key, and any combination of raisins and chocolate chips adding up to their total amount works.

This was a great recipe. I doubled it, used mini M&M's and put the batter in a 10X15X1 pan for bars. I made the recipe as written above and it was a little too sweet for me even then. I may leave out some of the chocolate next time and add some more non-sugary goodies, like more nuts, maybe sunflower seeds? Overall a keeper!

Nothing great here. Flat cookies with uniform, unexciting texture. I didn't have shortening, so I used all butter. Toasting the coconut first could have improved the texture and enhanced the flavor, but I won't bother again with this specific recipe.

My family and coworkers really loved these cookies. They are so awesome right out of the oven!! I made just as written and do not think any additional sugar is warranted at all. In fact, what appeals to me is the low sugar and flour (processed carbs), and the fact that the main ingredient is oats! Yum!! Will do again for sure!

This recipe is missing 1/4 cup sugar from the original,(that's why instructions are confusing)I use dried cranberries instead of raisens,and unsweetened coconut

Great cookies! Replaced the shortening with apple sauce as one viewer recommended and used walnuts instead of peanuts. This recipe doubles well!

Chewy and delicious! There's just enough dough to hold all of the goodies together.

I will not make these again the same way I did. I used maragarine instead of shortening which was disgusting - salty and gross. I will try them again with all butter.

By far the best cookie I have ever tasted. I too was confused by the term "sugars". My only revision was to omit the raisens, and substitute roasted almonds in place of the peanuts. A truly light and elegant treat!

Nice tasty cookie. They are chewy with a great texture. Left out the raisins and added more peanuts instead. Delicious!

I make these every year at Christmas time(in addition to my 'Christmas' cookies). We have family that stays with us and these cookies are a great late night (and breakfast) snack.

These cookies are really great! I was confused by the reference to "sugars" as opposed to just the brown sugar in the instructions. I did only add the brown sugar and the cookies were just sweet enough. I will make these again and experiment with other mix-ins like walnuts and dried fruit. This recipe's a keeper!

I was looking for a low-fat oatmeal cookie recipe and decided to make this one with a few substitutions. I used applesauce instead of veg. shortening and walnuts instead of peanuts, and omitted the coconut. I used 2 tbsp.of mini chocolate chips instead of a whole 6 oz. bag. It's not the original but it made for a great tasting, lighter version. Just the recipe I was looking for! My only complaint is that I only got 18 2" wide cookies (prior to baking) and I didn't even nibble on the dough....I'll have to double it next time.

First class! Crumbly, chewy, and full of goodies. (You do indeed only need 1/2c. brown sugar). I substituted purchased trail mix that included lots of different seeds, nuts, and dried fruit for the peanuts, coconut, and raisins. You can almost convince yourself they're healthy.

These are wonderful cookies! I substituted cashews for the peanuts and used chunk chocolate chips. I also thought it would be good if you substituted M&M's for the chocolate chips to make it even more "Trail-Mix-Like". This recipe will stay with my favorites!

I haven't made it b/c I'm confused--not only do the recipe instructions call for creaming the shortenings with the 'sugars', but 1/2 cup of brown sugar seems like not very much for cookies like this. Is the recipe missing the white sugar? I hope I get an answer in time to make these for my upcoming weekend camping trip....

I made these and then mother immediately made another batch. She added flour to stiffen - her personal choice - not mine.

these are great cookies! i made them for a group of friends and everyone loved them. easy to make, too! i would suggest chopping up the peanuts - the whole peanuts were a bit large.

This cookie recipe is an absolute classic. I would not change a thing about it. Everybody likes it and several have asked for the recipe. It is a very unusual and special cookie.

A bit too sweet for our taste, perhaps it will be better with unsweetened coconut.

This is a great recipe. I lost my 1991 copy of the recipe and was happy to find it on your website.
