Yumma. I used homemade whole wheat bread crumbs and mixed some in the onions as well as on top. What a great side dish. Who doesnt love onions???

Everyone raves when I make this - it's delicious. As the last reviewier, I often add other vegetables. I recently tried it layered with potatoes and gruyere as a gratin - it was the first thing on the table to disappear!

This is delicious! I first made it for Thanksgiving about 6 years ago - now I make it all year - it's fabulous with spring vidalias. I often mix this with a vegetable before baking- It's great with cauliflower- I've also tried it with broccoli, brussel sprouts, red & yellow peppers, - all are good. I add a little broth when I use a vegetable to keep the dish from getting too dry. I stir most of the cheese into the dish and put just a little on top with the breadcrumbs. Everyone raves about this, whether its straight onions or mixed with a veggie. The so-so reviews don't make any sense. Try it.

I've made this recipe three or four times now for holiday meals. It is similar to an old family recipe that I've not been able to duplicate, because everyone who had the recipe passed away before I could write it down. I usually make a smaller portion of it, though.

I though this was an easy dish to prepare. I like to brown my onion mixture a little to get a deeper flavor.Tastes great and I can prep it ahead of time.

I make an acorn squash gratin that has very similar ingredients in it and is much better than this dish. It's hard not to like cheese, butter, and cream, but this didn't blow me away.

Thought I reviewed it last year after TG. It was a delicious, rich addition to menu of many flavors and textures. As is usual for me, I had 6 people for dinner, probably had food enough for ten. I was looking forward to the leftovers, planned on thinning for a nice soup...my son took all the leftovers home with him. If you like onions and scalloped dishes, try this!

I make this dish whenever asked to bring a vegetable dish to a Fall /Winter potluck, and I am always asked for the recipe. It has virtually replaced creamed onions on my Thanksgiving menu, and in a tradition-bound family like mine, that's saying a lot. I add nutmeg to it, though.

Yummy! This is such an unusual dish--my guests loved it. Next time I'll mix the bread crumbs in and sprinkle the cheese on top--I ended up with a layer of dry crumbs that didn't do much for flavor or presentation. Otherwise, this was wonderful. The baking (as opposed to stove-cooking) time really helped me organize the meal. A real find!

Could not believe some gave this poor reviews. Try sauteing the onion mixture longer to a golden color and add some beef stock and boil it off. Also add more cheese than in the recipe and it is good mixing the sharp cheddar with gruyere. Make sure to salt the onions while sauteing.

This was very disappointing. The crumbs overwhelmed the cheddar and the cream was barely felt. For all the tears and the time, it wasn't worth it.

Sounds a whole lot better than it was for the trouble and expense

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It was time intensive to chop all of the onions, leeks and shallots. The end result was just so-so. I served this for Thanksgiving and several people said they liked our family's time-honored creamed pearl onions much better.

I have made prepared this recipe since it first appeared. It has evolved into a gratin of five onions..Spanish & Maui, sliced and sauteed, whole baby red & white, par-boiled, and thinly sliced scallions for a bit more color. It is the ultimate creamed onion alternative.

I make this dish every Thanksgiving to much appreciation, along with maple squash puree (Gourmet Nov. '93 is a classic for me - I'm going to try the chestnut stuffing this year too.) There's alot of chopping, as others have noted, but making it two days ahead is helpful. I always add more than the recommended amount of cream, and I find that it takes longer than the recipe states to saute the vegetables. I've packed it to bring as a guest, with a carton of cream, and packing the grated cheese & bread crumbs separately (mixed together) and my jar of paprika. Uniformly enjoyed!

As mentioned, this dish is a great alternative to the usual creamed onions. The only change I might make next time is to halve the recipe; unless you want plenty of leftovers, half would probably be plenty for a dozen guests.

Very tasty. I agree this dish is a great alternative to the usual holiday creamed onions. The only change I would make is to perhaps add more cheese since the flavor did not come through for me.

Delicious and easy, once you get done cleaning and chopping all those leeks! A great make-ahead dish, and the leftovers (if there are any) are sublime.

This is a wonderful dish - made it for both Thanksgiving and Christmas. Very different and easy (once you get past the chopping) to make. Can't wait to make it again!

I agree with the review that recommends using this dish at Thanksgiving - it's a great alternative to the usual creamed onions. This recipe has three things going for it - taste, ease of preparation, and the ability to prepare most of the dish the day before serving it!
