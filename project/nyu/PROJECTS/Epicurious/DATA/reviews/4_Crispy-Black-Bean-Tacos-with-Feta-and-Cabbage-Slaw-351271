This recipe is very quick less than 30 minutes start to table. It was very filling for no meat. It was difficult to get the tortillas to golden brown I burned one of the four.

Rating: 4
Delicious as written, although I've made it so many times that I know we like it better with much more lime juice. We add the feta (probably more than called for) to the slaw mixture and minced garlic or garlic powder to the beans. Also usually add grilled fish or meat but absolutely amazing as is. I never even measure any more - just dump it all together. Fast, healthy, inexpensive. We eat this at least twice a month.

Making these as tostadas, with prepared shells (quality, authentic ones), simplifies the recipe even more, and avoids the frying oil smell. Really excellent recipe and the final product is definitely greater than the sum of its parts.

Rating: 4
Seriously, these are so good. I looked at this recipe for a couple of years thinking what could be so great about these tacos. I used a can of re-fried black beans and kept pretty mulch else as is. I did use a little more oil in the browning step and let them sit for a few seconds on a paper towel to get the grease off. Amazing result for the effort involved.

This recipe is one of my all-time favorites! It's so easy to make that my husband (who is otherwise a die-hard meat-eater) uses this as his go-to meal when I'm out of town. I've tried a few small variations... regular hot sauce instead of chipotle and broccoli slaw instead of coleslaw, but the original recipe is still the best.

Rating: 3
Quick, easy, healthy and delicious! We left out the feta and didn't miss it, just added some salt to the bean mixture instead. I used a broccoli slaw mixture, which worked out great. Will definitely be adding this one to the regular week night rotation.

Rating: 4
These tacos are incredibly easy and delicious! I had a little bit of a hard time with the oil to taco ratio because I don't have a large enough pan to cook all the tacos at once. Some wound up a little greasy, others didn't cook enough. This was easy enough to fix by adding oil to each batch. Also substituted queso fresco for the feta. YUM!

Omitted the hot sauce and used crushed red pepper in my slaw! Otherwise followed the recipe. So good!

Quick, Cheap, and delicious!!! We loved it and I ate it three nights in a row to use up the remainders. Now one of my standards. I tried some variations with cheddar cheese, without lime, different hot sauces...Sriracha sauce worked fine, but sticking to the recipe is the way to go!

So simple and SO GOOD!!! It didn't sound like much on paper, but boy did my family gobble it up! The only change I made was to use olive oil pan spray and it worked just fine. When I first told my daughters what we were having for dinner I was greeted with moans and complaints, ...."no meat? Yuk!" Well, after one bite they changed their tune to: "Can you make these every time we have tacos from now on?"

This is incredible!! My teenaged daughter and I went nuts over these - healthy, flavorful - we used red cabbage.

Seriously delicious and really easy. I used a green cabbage because I couldn't find cole slaw mix, and I used twice as much cilantro and lime juice as called for. It made 6 tacos which was perfect for two of us, and we made them in 2 batches in a large (12 inch) cast iron skillet using only 1 or 2 tsp oil. I have half a cabbage left so I'm making it again tonight! I didn't love the feta so tonight I'm going to try it with cotija or some other more mild salty cheese.

Rating: 4
This is 4 forks because it is yummy, healthful and quick! Yellow corn tortillas are a must. I used bagged, shredded red cabbage that I pre-salted in a strainer with kosher salt (to remove water) rather than coleslaw (crunchier). Used reduced-fat feta crumbles. Added lime juice and some minced garlic while mashing the beans as per previous reviewer. Shockingly great! But you only get 4-5 tacos so this definitely only 2 servings.

So delicious! I made a simple cole slaw with red cabbage using only the sauce from the "Creamy Cole Slaw" recipe. Served with "Mexican Rice." Everyone loved these, will definitely be making again!

This is really very, very good!I loved it pretty much as written only adding mashed garlic, kosher salt and lime juice to the bean mix. As you can see from the reviews there are many ways to mix it up to your taste .The feta melted into the bean mix and it was creamy, crunchy, spicy and tangy. I'm excited to share this one with company and a couple margaritas!

This is such a great recipe! You really cannot go wrong. Even the meat-lovers enjoy these tacos! Highly recommended.

Rating: 3
Excellent recipe and I think it only took me 15 minutes to make! I made the recipe as direction (with yellow corn taco shells) but substituted monterrey jack for the feta cheese as I don't care for feta. (I did not use olive oil for tortillas or coleslaw since I wanted to cut calories.) I like spicy food, so I used jalapeno black beans and liberally used the chipotle sauce. (Don't skip the chipotle sauce - adds great flavor!) Really enjoyed the flavor and texture that the coleslaw mix added. Very quick, healthy and delicious!

Rating: 3
This was delicious and easy to make! I added a few ingredients to each component for more flavor and texture. In the slaw I added some corn for a little sweetness and avocado, well just because I love avocado. In the black beans I added a little chile powder and some chopped green chiles for a little kick. Topped it all off with some Chipotle Tabasco sauce...yum!

Rating: 4
Loved these tacos. I liked the crunch of the coleslaw and crisp corn tortillas which mask the mushy texture of the beans. I dislike anything mushy and don't eat a lot of beans because of that. I will definitely be making these on a regular basis; healthy, cheap and quick to make. I must have used too small tortillas because I made at least six small tacos. Next time I may skip the feta, not sure if just my taste or the inexpensive brand from Target (they only had one choice). Definitely need to use corn tortillas, would not be the same with flour tortillas. Will use this recipe for chicken/beef tacos also.

For an alternative, I recommend substituting tostada shells, then spreading the beans on that and sticking it in the oven for a couple minutes and adding the cheese and slaw toppings. Excellent for a quick meal.

These taco's are awesome. I make them all the time now because they are so easy and taste so good. I usually whip up more of the coleslaw mix and throw in some avocado's for a side salad. Make more than the recipe calls for because two just don't quite cut it.

This is a great week night recipe. A real no brainer. Very, very tasty.

Rating: 4
I have made these many times, they are so easy to make during the week. I use Trader Joes Refried Black Beans with Jalapeno Peppers so the beans already have a little kick. I dont even fry the tortillas I brown them over the fire on my stove for a healthier alternative. You can eat them as the recipe is written or add any meat, shrimp or fish to add extra protein. Wonderful and easy!

Rating: 1
I was hopeful for this dish given all the rave reviews. It was pretty awful. I followed the recipe and did the goat cheese someone suggested and everything. I will give it one more go (it's cheap and easy) BUT I will add salsa to the bean mixture -- they were dry as a bone). I did like the cabbage though.

Rating: 4
my sister has been talking about this recipe for years and i finally made it and am so glad i did! super easy and tasty, especially as a vegetarian option. i used broccoli slaw (love it!) and trader joe's jalapeno pepper hot sauce (if you have not had this you must buy it immediately -- adds a slight smoky flavor). looking forward to making this again, and again and again!

Rating: 4
Fantastic, easy and just perfect when you want a dose of fresh veggies and a bit of protein. I throw in extra cilantro and chop up some red pepper, serving it over a flat, fried corn tortilla. I also throw the feta right in the salad. Fresh cabbage is my preference as it has so much more flavor than anything from a bag. I make this often and it always seems to hit the spot. One of my favorites...

Rating: 4
Super Tasty!! I made this dish as the recipe specified...with a few tweaks: I used the juice of 1 full lime - almost double what the recipe called for. I added a 1/2 tsp of diced jalapenos to the slaw and topped the tacos with avocado. I also used Chalupa as my hot sauce. Lastly, I used very little oil with the tortillas, just enough to give them a crisp. I will make this again, and again, and again :)

Rating: 4
Fantastic! I added a bit of chopped jalapeno to spice up the slaw and reduced the oil to my taste. I topped it all with some sliced avocado. Will make again, especially for my veggie only eating friends.

Very delicious. I did not have any cilantro on hand for the slaw and only used a head of cabbage instead of a mix . It is soo good and probably better with the cilantro. I added Cholula for my hot sauce!

Rating: 4
I will confess that I used packaged taco shells for this recipe. Didn't matter, they were fantastic!! I also didn't have cabbage, so substituted really crunchy romaine spines and red bell pepper slivers, but I'm sure a slaw would be delicious here as well. The flavors were fresh and lively; lots of contrasts...crunchy shells, creamy spiced beans, tangy yet creamy feta, citrusy slaw, spicy chipotle salsa, cool sour cream (not in the recipe, we just added it). Beats the heck out of supermarket pacakaged tacos...great quick dinner from fridge/pantry staples!

Rating: 4
Just made this and it was wonderful. I didn't do the coleslaw, and I accidentally bought goat cheese instead of feta...it was ah-maz-ing! I'd recommend the goat cheese, it was a really wonderful blend with the beans. This is definitely going to become a weekly staple.

this is wonderful but agree with others that the beans need more bite (garlic, cayenne, salt) and no need to oil the pan. i made as appetizers, slicing the tortillas into quarters. wonderful!

I liked the idea of this recipe but thought that the beans needed more seasoning, so I diced and sautéed half of an onion and half of a bell pepper added cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper and stirred in the beans, heating until warmed through. To cut back on calories and clean up, I sprayed the tortillas with a little vegetable oil spray and put them in the toaster oven to get warm and slightly crispy. This recipe makes about eight tacos.

Rating: 3
It's hard to fill the tacos-- we end up piling the slaw and feta on top and eating with a fork and knife. But the crunchy texture of the slaw makes this stand out from other black bean dishes. Great quick dinner.

I thought this was bland and dry. Added some cut up pink grapefruit which helped

Rating: 3
Dry roast cumin seeds first and then grind with a mortar & pestle. It adds a depth to the seasoning. I also cooked the black beans in a pressure cooker. They have much better taste than the canned ones - takes about 20 minutes or so. For the slaw, I shredded a carrot and some red cabbage and added mayo and more of the roasted, ground cumin, lemon juice and pepper. I kept this separate and added it with the feta after frying the tacos. Use day-old tortillas (I make my own and when they are too fresh, they don't fold or crisp as up as well) and use tongs to squeeze the folded tacos together while crisping them up in the pan. The Mexican rice suggestion is right on. But a little guacamole never hurts.

Yes, yes, a hundred times yes. While I would definitely use the term "tacos" lightly when describing this dish, I could not stop eating them after I made them. This recipe got me over my fear of pre-made coleslaw mix (who knew, it was the mayo that I hated). So deliciou.

Rating: 2
Just finished eating these tacos. The slaw was really good. The crispy tortilla shells were really good. They looked fantastic. The bean mixture was an epic fail. It confirmed my inability to ever convert to vegetarianism. Even with doubling the spices and adding chili powder like some of the reviews suggested the beans were just blah and had an unappetizing texture. While I found them difficult to finish eating, I give it two forks because individually the rest of the components of this dish were good.

This recipe is sinfully good for a non-meat dish. I like to augment it with some diced new potato, onion and garlic. I also increase the cumin to 2 teaspoons and add 1 tsp of ancho chili to add a bit more flavor. We have had this numerous times and keep saying to ourselves, "Why do we need meat again?" I have even made this in larger quantities for the vegetarians in our high school music program and receive nothing but high marks for dish.

Healthy, quick and easy, and my 12 year old son liked it! What more can I ask? I substituted cheddar for feta and didn't use cilantro since I didn't have any and they were still delicious. Great easy vegetarian meal!

These got such great reviews that I am somewhat embarrassed to report that I had a difficult time getting the tacos "crispy" (they never did make it), the black bean mixture is much too stiff to place easily on the tacos in the hot oil, and once cooked, it is a pain to stuff the slaw and cheese into the tacos. Obviously, I made this much more laborious than it needed to be, but I would not choose to make these again.

Had a dinner party and served the menu (minus the mexican rice) that is recommended with this dish. It came out GREAT! Everyone had seconds. The soup is very rich and filling. Tacos: I prepared the slaw mix beforehand and kept it in the fridge. I also made the tacos beforehand and put them in a warm oven. After the soup I took my pan of already made tacos and just stuffed some of the slaw mix into them and served. Easy. Will definitely make this again! Oh, and the hot sauce was the cherry on the sundae.

So easy and so delicious! This was exactly the fast and filling meal I needed after working all day. I used a broccoli slaw mix as I like a little more crunch to my slaw, and added a tablespoon of fresh lime juice to the beans, I think it gave extra punch. Also used queso fresco that I had. This would be great with crunchy taco shells or even big tortilla chips.

To A Cook from Louisville, KY, please dont completely change the recipe and then complain about it. You sound ridiculous. This recipe is DELISH! I use regular old Napa cabbage and I add shrimp. If your kids don't like feta, you can sub Jack cheese and its still just as fantastic.

Dear fellow cooks, I am writing to review this meal so you can get a taste of this meal before you serve it. As a family it was all agreed that this plate deserved a two star rating. Before I go any farther with my review I have to admit that we did not use the correct slaw. We also did not use corn tortillas instead we used flour and corn chips. Thank you for taking your time to read this review.

SUPER YUMMY. My household is beef centric and we don't do much vegetarian cooking, but during a heatwave no one wants to spend time cooking. So, we gave it a shot and the recipe couldn't possibly be easier or more delicious. I made a few changes to adjust for what we had on hand...I used white beans instead of black and switched the feta to pepperjack cheese. They were so good that I was doing the 'happy dance' while eating them. I immediately got a request for this to be added to the dinner rotation. Yeah! My summer cooking just got a little easier.

These tacos are simple, filling, and ridiculously easy to make, and they are surprisingly flavorful. An easy, flexible dish that could be switched up quickly. I might experiment with adding different spices to the bean mix.

Easy and delicious. The cole slaw really makes it. I doubled the cumin and added a dash of chili powder to the beans. My children don't like hot sauce, so we used Pace brand "Pineapple, Mango, Chipotle Salsa," which was delicious. Served with yellow spanish rice on the side. My only complaint is that we were all still hungry after dinner. Next time for my family of 4, I will double the recipe. Delicious. I'll be making this often.

This is easy, tasty, and insanely cheap. I've made it when trying to just save money and when I need a quick dinner, but it's also good enough that I've made it for company. I always like to add some fresh jalapeno to the slaw. The actual directions for cooking are confusing to me, so I just make all the tacos first then put them in the pan, a few minutes per side, til they get crispy.

Rating: 4
I too was skeptical...feta cheese in my taco?! I was so pleasantly surprised! I did add Chipotle Tabasco hot sauce directly to the beans with cumin. The 3 tsp oil seemed a little much for me so I will play with that next time. I made the slaw in the morning so the flavors would develop and that way dinner would come together super fast. Great vegetarian meal!

Rating: 4
This is a fab weeknight meal. Cheap, easy-- what could be better? I made a chipotle sauce with chipotle, a little mayo and some yogurt since I didn't have the hot sauce. Thanks to the previous reviews, I used flour tortillas, doubled the cumin and added some chili powder and added some fresh tomato. While I didn't have any avocado, I would try this too next time. This dish reminds me of the Chicken Fajitas with Crunchy Lime Cabbage and Avocado from this site. If you like this, you should like it too-- if you are a meat eater, of course!

I love foods with a complex taste and these tacos did not disappoint. The cumin gave the beans a beefy taste and the oil and fresh lime provided a light citrus tang which balanced the flavor well. I also added pieces of fresh mango to add to the complexity. This is another recipe I will consider a part of my vegetarian staple. Another plus for me was how fast these can be made!

This was a big hit. Very tasty and easy. I loved the cumin-scented beans. I didn't have bag slaw so just chopped some cabbage. It was fine. I added some sour cream and tomatoes to my taco.

These are tasty and healthy and quick to make. They will be a regular "quick lunch" for me. I did not add rice as other reviewers have, but it would be a good addition, as they are not super filling.

Also, regarding the complete protein comment of other reviewers, if you are using corn tortillas, the corn and beans make a cmplete protein.

As a vegetarian, finding new, flavorful and easy dishes is sometimes difficult...this one is great. I've also tried some variations with cheeses and adding a Spanish style rice.

We added leftover rice to the bean mixture for a complete protein. Also we like spice so we added dried oregano, minced garlic and minced onion. Next time we'll add a minced jalapeno. Have found that without meat, we crave a higher spice/heat ratio. Remember fat=flavor so when you take out lots of fat, you need to up the flavor so your brain doesn't feel cheated. We've also offered the usual toppings for tacos such as sour cream, salsa, chopped scallions,sliced or chopped black olives and shredded Jack cheese (regular or dry).

It is a great recipe to use as a base and expand from there.

Quick and tasty -- but not enough! My husband (who is skinny but a good eater) and I polished off all the tacos - but were left with lots of extra slaw (in the bag). Great option for a casual dinner with friends, so you can double or triple up on the beans, and use up all the tortillas and slaw. I added diced chiles to the beans, was more generous with the cumin, and next time would add a can of corn.

Um yeah. Feta + black beans= Joy. Like another reviewer, Husband and I ate the whole meal in one sitting. I substituted purchased Broccoli Slaw (never knew there was such a thing!) since I don't really like cabbage slaw and have fallen in love with the combination of flavors. I did cook the beans down a bit in some stock before mashing, mostly just to kill time though.

Fantastic quick meal sped up even further if you just buy the taco shells to go with it! I upped the quantity of lime and added some olive oil to the beans as they dry out quickly once they are crushed. The feta is a perfect compliment to the black beans. I added Chalula lime hot sauce and this one is a KEEPER.

The 4th fork is for the easiness. the first time I made these, I forgot the feta. It was in the fridge all ready to go too. Dang. I remembered it with the leftovers though.. very easy, very yummy. It totally adapts well too... You could easily just steam the tortillas and have a great meal without the frying. Mix in lime and/or salsa with the beans, whatever. My recipe for rice: saute a chopped onion and a HEAD (yes, really) of garlic, some of it minced, but most of it whole, it will mellow, trust me. Add a chopped pepper for spice if you are so inclined, the flavor is good and the spice will mellow as well. Dump in about 2 cups of white long grain white rice, and brown it for a couple of minutes (stirring). Then dump in 2-1/2 or 3 cups of chicken broth (maybe a half cup more if you like more moist rice), a can of diced tomatoes in juice, and a smaller (8 oz) can of tomato sauce (not paste). Stir, add a cup or two of frozen corn/carrot/green bean/pea mixture, salt a 1/2 to 1 t. or so, bring to a boil, and then reduce the heat, covered at a simmer for 15 minutes or so. SO good.

Split decision on this one. I thought it was absolutely fantastic - the combination of the slaw, beans, and feta was spot on. My wife, however, was less impressed - she thought the beans were too "dense." I'll definitely make again, but maybe do something more with the beans next time.

Great vegetarian meal. I thought these would be kind of plain, but they were really tasty with good flavor. I made the tacos and brushed the outside with oil, then baked them in the oven at 375' (flipping once) until the outside was crispy. The feta adds a great bite.

Not much flavor. Wouldn't make it again.

I've made this a couple of times and love how easy and tasty it is. The second time, I added about 1/2 teaspoon apple cider vinegar and some dried oregeno to the beans when I mashed them. Much better flavor. The slaw is great, and I've also just shoved some mixed greens in the tacos. Both times, I made 6 tacos, and put the feta in the taco with the beans so it could get a little melty. I did 3 at a time in the pan, and kept the first three warm in the toaster oven. Served with guacamole.

Is this a "recipe" or just nicely seasoned black beans stuffed in a tortilla?

LOVED this recipe! Was so simple to make and healthy! Definitely a keeper in my arsenal. I used whole wheat tortillas and added some cayenne to the beans for a great kick.

I also don't understand all the positive reviews. I thought it was just okay. I added sour cream to the beans as one person suggested but they were still really dry.

I was slightly disappointed with this recipe given all of the rave reviews. While good, I didn't love it. I feel like something was missing, but am not sure what it was. I would give it 2 and 1/2 forks out of 4. I will probably try it again but this time with some substitutions to see if it is more appealing.

The person with non-crisp tacos did not have the pan hot enough. My husband the steak lover, loved these. I will make again. I did add med.salsa into the bean mix and that added flavor.

Easy, cheap and delicious! I substituted queso blanco for the feta (not a feta fan), and it was very nice. Also combined the black beans w/ the slaw mix before cooking. Definitely adding this one into the rotation.

I sub the cole slaw w/fresh chopped spinach and served the slaw on the side. Actually made it Broccoli slaw!

Pretty good! I would have rated it 3.5 forks but it seems like the choices are 3 forks or 4 forks. I made it exactly as the recipe except I substituted cotija cheese (available everywhere in the Los Angeles area) for the feta and it was excellant. Initially I was skeptical that such a simple recipe would be good without chiles and onions but everything combined well and saved time. A winner for me!

Loved it considering the 15 min. total time it took. Loved the crunch of the tortillas and the slaw. We used flour tortillas due to preference. Loved the unique flavor the feta contributed and will definitely make it again (and look forward to eating it) when we're in a time jam.

We were really surprised by this one! We ended up making it twice in the same week because we liked it so much. The chipotle sauce is key!

My family LOVED this recipe. It was better than I expected it to be. I did add some lime juice to the beans. You can definately use a little less oil for frying. So easy! I am a Preschool teacher, and we did this for a cooking project (minus the hot sauce) and the kids could not get enough! I also used some broccoli slaw I got at Trader Joe's and it is yummy. The first time I made it I sauteed shrimp on the side, but found that it really is filling enough by itself.

We loved this dish...we are food snobs. I added sauteed garlic in the place of cilantro. Give it a try and tweek it to your own taste!

What a disappointment. I made these following the recipe exactly, though added avocado at the end as some suggested. The tortillas were oily, the beans were bland, and the slaw was not enough to save it. It was just adequate enough that I went ahead and ate it instead of ordering take out thai. I can't figure out why these get such positive reviews.

What a great recipe! I used only 1 tablespoon of oil to fry all 4 tacos. I think 3 tablespoons may be excessive. I also added avocado, subbed chili powder for the cumin, and used flat leaf parsley in place of the cilantro. The latter two substitutions were simply due to family taste preferences; I am sure that it would be delicious as written. This is fast, easy, fresh and a great source of plant protein. Excellent.

Definitely needed the hot sauce, next time I will add salsa to the bean mixture. The slaw and warming the tacos in the pan are what make this recipe a keeper.

Rating: 4
These were really good, especially for something so quick. My beans were very dry, I should have mixed in a bit of sour cream or something to make them "creamier"and the slaw is best made fresh, as leftover it was quite strong and had lost its crunch. A new go-to recipe from staple items.

These were fantastic! Made exactly as written, except used salsa instead of the hot sauce. The tortillas came out surprisingly crisp.

This is a great, easy weeknight meal; it will become a standby. I felt that the hot sauce was essential, as the tacos were surprisingly bland without it.

So easy to make and so delicious. I made the recipe exactly as writen and was told by my fiance that this should make its way into "the rotation". For those weary that the absence of meat may leave something to be desired, worry no longer. It's a very hearty and filling dish. The warmth and richness of the beans match perfectly with the cool acidic flavor of the cabbage slaw. Both textures combined with the soft, crunch of the taco equals perfection!!!!

This is the most fantastic recipe ... I used already smashed back beans ... mixed them with cumin and then microwaved them to warm them up ... In the meantime, simply place your corn tortilla in a frying pan with oil ... do not turn it over ... immediately place the bean mixture on one half of the tortilla and fold it over ... I did one at a time and ... flip after browned on one side and brown the other side ... I have these little taco holders ... so after finishing one, I placed it in the taco holder on a warming plate and continued making the rest ... they remained warm and crispy ... then when done, placed the cold slaw per recipe, cheese, per recipe, and salsa per recipe ... I served them with one chicken enchilada ... ohmygosh ... how fantastic ... this is a fab recipe ... however, two tacos with one enchilada is really filling ... so the next time, I will omit the enchilada (for me) ... but for the big eaters ... it is perfectly yummy ... GREAT RECIPE ... I will most definitely make these again and again ...

I thought this was also pretty tasty! But I also made some changes....... I added corn to the bean mixture and and threw it in the food processor for a bit, But not till it was completely pureed. I also heated the bean mixture and kept it separate from the slaw. I used spiced Gouda instead of feta, and sour cream with chipotle peppers in it. Then finished it off with some sliced avacados. Very Good!

Everyone should make these. I have made some of the most elaborate, expensive recipes on Epicurious, and these tacos beat almost all of them. Avocado is a fantastic addition.

I really liked these. I would definitely keep the corn tortillas, although I did mix the chipotle with some sour cream instead of the feta.

I absolutely had to make these because I love all these ingredients. However, the actual technique needs some refining. Here's how I'm making it next time. Flour tortillas instead of corn; corn tortillas break apart more easily and arent as flexible as flour. The taste you gain from the corn tortillas isn't worth the aggravation of having to "saute" them until they're flexible enough to fold in the pan. The sauteeing threw a lot of unnecessary smoke into the kitchen and it took forever to make them all. I would heat the beans and cumin mixture separately and leave the cabbage/feta mixture to the side. I might even lose the feta and add sour cream and hot sauce here. Assemble them by warming the flour tortillas briefly and filling with warm beans. Top the beans with your "cold" ingredients, wrap and eat; this is how we normally eat "fajitas" and how I will make these next time.

Very good! I also added some cooked brown rice to the bean and next time I would make more coleslaw. For a side dish I used a pint of grape tomatoes, halved them and added some Salsa Verde (jar)- very yummy. A great way to spice up Winter!

Simply amazing! I made this last night for the first time. This recipe is a quadruple threat -- easy, quick, low-cal and delicious! My husband enjoyed this so much, he asked when we were having it next! The flavors work really well together and I just can't get over how easy it was to make something this tasty and different. It will see many returns on my dinner table.

i was surprised to see that it seems all of the reviews of this were glowingly positive. maybe the other reviewers know something i don't! i felt like it was really bland, and other than the slaw (which was good/nice, but also nothing out of the ordinary) pretty much the only things i liked were things i added that were not in the recipe itself. i made a greek yogurt-garlic-cilantro sauce, as well as some spanish rice with green peppers, olives, and tomato and roasted some sweet potatoes with chipotle. all as side dishes that sort of ended up being mixed in once on people's plates. i also heated the beans in olive oil before serving. all in all, this wasn't a real winner. i would do something along these lines with many similar ingredients again, but think you're better off just using the ingredients as you see fit, rather than adhering to this recipe.

Definitely use a griddle - I could not make these fast enough for my family one at a time. I put the feta on top of the beans before folding in half which helped keep them together. This is one of the easiest, best recipes I've tried on this site. My 8, 7 and 3 year old kids all loved them!

I'm giving this 4 stars because this recipe had great flavors for the very minimal amount of work that went into making them. I followed the recipe except that I just brushed the tortillas with oil then cooked them on my electric griddle, just so I could make more at one time. Will make again.

My husband and I couldn't get enough of these tacos. I made the recipe exactly as it says, except I used prepared baked white corn taco shells (to save on fat) and parsley instead of cilantro (we're not big fans). Next time I might add a teaspoon of sugar to the coleslaw, but these will definitely be on our dnner table regularly regardless. I am also giving the recipe to a vegan friend to make - minus the feta.

These were delicious. The only change I made was adding 1 teaspoon of chili powder after tasting the beans. I bought fresh corn tortillas from the farmers market. I will be making these again and again.

We thought these were great. I really like the Cuban-style black beans from Trader Joes; they have so much more flavor and spice than plain black beans. We also ate them "open-faced" style. I added lime juice and more cumin to the beans. Excellent. My husband ate them readily and he's the biggest carnivore in the world!

My 22 year-old son and I loved this. It was easy, economical, crispy, crunchy and tasty! We used multi-grain flour tortillas and a few dashes of chipotle (smoked jalapeno) sauce, as recommended, at serving.

This made a great lunch. I added a bit more lime juice, increased the cumin by about 50% and put in about another 1/2 green onion because I thought mine looked small. This went over very well with my husband who is incredibly difficult to please when it comes to novel recipes!!! We'll do this one again, which is true of about only 10% of the new recipes I try! (I keep trying.)

I added ground chuck and spicy italian sausage to the mix and the tacos were a big hit. I would eat them plain but we are meat eaters in my family :)
