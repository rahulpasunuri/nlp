Excellent chili recipe. Do be sure and add the suggested accompaniments. They really take this dish from delicious to extraordinary!

Great little dish. Didn't know what to do on a Sunday and decided cooking some chili would alleviate this boredom. I switched a few things up: added half a red bell pepper I had sitting around, and a couple tablespoons brown sugar to slightly sweeten it. Used 2 lb pork shoulder, 1 can kidney bean and 1 can black bean. The next time around I'll probably be trying the 1 tablespoon chili powder with chipotle chilis suggestion.

This is exceptional chili but two major adjustments are strongly recommended: First reduce the amount of chili powder to a scant 1 TABLESPOON; and secondly, add in 2 tablespoons (more if you like) of chopped "chipotle chilis in adobo sauce" to bring up the heat. Doing this gets you the deep, spicy chili flavor you want, without the risk of waaaaaaay over-salting the dish. I also recommend skipping the bacon part, and simply browning the pork in lard. Lard is often used in tex-mex cooking and gives it a great authentic flavor. Lastly, I think most cooks around here would automatically know to de-fat the the chili before adding the beans; it's an absolute must with any pork chili and really *ENHANCES* the dish's flavor. Excess oil coats a person's tastebuds and really diminishes flavor of this kind of dish. The best (and easiest!) method I have found to do this is to carefully fold up a paper towel (or two) and dab the oil away from the surface. You'll be amazed how the oil will stick to the towel and the chili will remain in the pot, making de-fatting any sauce a cinch.

My employer first prepared this chili for a raft guide get together last winter. My employers run white water rafting trips (Rocky Mountain River Tours - raft trips dot com) on the Middle Fork of the Salmon out in Idaho and we had some butterfly cut filet mignon left over from the rivers season, which she substituted for the pork shoulder. Wow. So good. Filet makes for an expensive chile for a raft guide in the off-season so I've stuck with the pork every time I've prepared this. Yea - I've prepared it more than once. Very tasty.

This is, hands down, the best chile ever, but! I didn't read the part about NOT using real chile powder but rather substituting the chile powder type crap you can find in bulk in most supermarkets until after I had made my first batch. After visiting New Mexico last fall and tasting the incredible things they do with chile, it didn't even occur to me to use anything but real chile powder. I used real, New Mexico chile powder and it came out over the top good! If you have a delicate pallette, perhaps the chile powder type substance they sell in bulk, in supermarkets will work for you but if you appreciate chile the way I do, use the real stuff. I can't wait to try this with Passilla, Chamyo, or Hatch powder. It may take me the rest of the year to decide which combination is the best but I'm willing to sacrifice. This recipe, with real New Mexico chile powder is over the top.

I made this recipe for a chili cook off luncheon, and won first place. There were about 16 other contestants. The only thing I do differently is use black beans, because they seem to be easier on my families digestive system.

Rating: 4
I realised late that I didn't have 1/3 cu. chili powder in house, so I substituted some ancho chile powder cut with onion powder in the mix. Also, instead of canned beans, I cooked some Rancho Gordo beans from scratch. Since the chili was to spend a couple of hours on the stove, the beans were ready in plenty of time. I used 1 1/2 cu. dried beans and ended up with just the right amount (Yellow Eyed Woman variety, but any chili-sized bean would work, I think). This batch turned out spicier than I would have liked, but has AMAZING depth of flavor. I will tweak the mix of spices next time, but think this recipe is an absolute winner. Definitely the base on which I will build my best red chili!

Took this to a camping trip with 10 families so doubled the recipe. We all had it for dinner, and then everybody had some again the next morning for breakfast with tortillas and eggs -breakfast burrito-style. Everybody asked for the recipe. Made a few modifications as advised by other reviewers: used beer instead of water, a little brown sugar, a couple of bay leaves. Huge hit.

Perfect for a foggy SF day. Just enough spice. The pepitas (toasted salted pumpkin seeds) & bacon really bring out smokey and earthy flavors of this chili! EXCELLENT!

This is hands-down my family's favorite chili recipe - it has just the right amount of spice and heat! I made slight changes - using left over pulled pork (which cut way down on the total time), subbing beef broth for the water, and using ancho chili powder (no cayenne on hand). It was such a hit, I'm making it this week for family and friends!

Delicious! I will definitely make this again!!

This was a huge hit! I skipped the coffee and added extra water to make up for the lost liquid and the chili still came out superbly. Reduce the chili powder if you'd rather have a less potent taste, although I added a bit more and got rave reviews from a range of people. This is a keeper.

I was sort of disappointed by this recipe. I chose this because all of the reviews say how amazing it is and I just don't agree. By itself the tomato taste is quite strong. With additives- I used avocado sour cream and corn chips- it's pretty good but still nowhere near the best.

Rating: 4
This is a jolt of Umami..so savory its almost too much flavour. Its like someone dumped a whole jar of Marmite (Vegemite/Cenovis) - go Goggle it - into the brew. This was made with Boston Butt as that was all the local supermarket had for a big pork joint. I used a pressure cooker to speed things along. I wouldn't change a thing. Now I know what all the raves were about. It must be that can of beef broth + coffee that makes the taste so intense. A keeper!

This is one of the best chili recipes that I have ever had! It was the big hit on Superbowl Sunday. It gets better after it sits for 2-3 days, and the bacon garnish takes it over the top! I trimmed most of the fat off the shoulder, and the flavor was still very rich, the meat tender. I made it quite spicy, and it was loved by all (sour cream helps tone it down a bit too). This one's a keeper. YUM!

I have made this many times and it's a winner! My husband actually made this for a company wide chili cookoff and won first place! This has complex flavors and is easy to make.

This is fantastic! I made it for New Year's Eve and my family requests it over and over again. The flavors mix well together and it makes a big batch. I add garlic and substitute dark beer for the coffee as others noted. If I could have given it 5 forks I would have.

Wow...this is my new favorite chili recipe. I put it in the slow cooked for 8 hours on low. The meat was so tender and flavors were perfectly melded.

i followed others advice and substituted beer for water and added brown sugar. I don't know if pork shoulder is usually this chewy and fatty or if it was just the piece I happened to get (we would have probably liked it better with a leaner piece of pork). I let it simmer for 3 hours and expected it to be a richer and thicker sauce but it was actually very thin and bland.

To fix what cmj500 noted as "missing" (if I noted the same thing) required some pretty minor modifications. I added a bay leaf or two during simmer for starters. I added a tad more cumin (reducing a bit the chili powder). Then, I took the bone from the pork shoulder and made a broth out of it (skimming off the fat froth). Adding this in 1/4 cups where thinning was called for over the long simmer brought all the soul out in this recipe you could ask for.

Delicious chili. I used a whole pint of Stout beer instead of the coffee and kept the rest the same. Very tasty, could have been a little more spicy, but I guess that depends on the chili powder used.

Fantastic chili. I made this last weekend for family to raves. I followed the recipe along with suggestions from reviewers to add brown sugar and replace water with beer. Pork was very tender after cooking at very low simmer, flavor excellent! My husband begged me to make it again this weekend and not to change a thing. Added chopped green onions and shredded cheddar to other toppings.

What I appreciate about this recipe is that it has a good foundation and accepts modifications really well. I didn't buy groceries to prepare this, so modified with what I had on hand. Beef instead of pork, chorizo instead of bacon, fresh roasted pasillas instead of jalapenos, and hominy instead of beans. I know that seems like we are no longer talking about the same recipe, but the coffee and the seasonings are what make this so good, regardless of how the other ingredients change.

I've been making this since it first came on the site in 2000. Unbeatable every time, with or without variations others have recommended. Yesterday I made it with turkey for the first time - frozen leftover dark meat in big chunks. Fabulous once again! Served with rice, green onions (needs the green), cheese, and sour cream. A distinctive, memorable flavor combination that has come to define chili for me.

Great Chili recipe! Used dark beer instead of coffee, and added 1/4 cup brown sugar. Also, I used the liquid from the canned red beans instead of water to make it thicker. For a low-fat version, omit the bacon at the beginning and use trimmed pork loin rib ends instead of shoulder.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written and it was very good. Had a lot left over, so the following night, I added more broth, 1/2 cup beer, more cayenne, cumin, and more beans. But this time I kept a cover on the pot and braised the pork for about an hour. Believe me, it was even better. I adjusted the sauce, adding salt and a touch of brown sugar, and it was perfect.

My beloved declared this the best chili he's ever tasted. I substituted golden ale for water, but also used the coffee (which to me seems imperative). Wonderfully piquant with a great after-kick, this recipe is one I'll be using often. My one qualm is that the chili was a bit soupy, so next time I'll double the amount of beans.

This was delicious. We did use some of the suggestions from others. First we smoked the pork on the grill just to get some flavor then cut into cubes and browned. We also used beer instead of water and coffee. We also added some chipolte peppers in adobe sauce and about 1/4 C brown sugar. We will definitely make this again.

Okay, I found the recipe yesterday, cooked it after church today and won the our church chili cook-off this evening! (out of about 25 entries!) I used dark beer (Sam Adams Winter Lager) instead of water. Still used the coffee and added some brown sugar. Also, I used pork tenderloin (about $2.50/pound at Sam's, 4 lbs.) Used an extra can of beans (poured the bean juice in while reducing then added the beans close to finish. I would use a whole pound of bacon next time and probably double the drippings for browning the pork. Served with a little bacon sprinkled on top with cilantro, red onions and squeeze of lime.

Easy to make and sure to win the Chili contest! Make it as hot as you like with the fresh peppers. For a mole secret add one square of unsweetened chocolate near the end of cooking.

Rating: 4
This is very close to my recipe, so I tried it again yesterday. Instead of the sugar, which I think is too sweet, I used Abuelita's Hot Chocolate. It comes in rounds divided into wedges, has a touch of cinnamon, and has no milk. I used 2 wedges and the result was not obviously chocolatey, just warm and brown. I also rehydrate 4 ancho chiles and 5-6 casabel chiles in warm water, and blend them smooth with several large garlic cloves. This replaces the chili powder and gives a beautiful rich redness to the chili. It's not too hot, don't be shy with dried chiles. I use equal amounts ground beef and ground pork, easier than chopping meat.

What an award-winning recipe! I entered this is our chili cook-off and won the grand prize! Not bad for a first time chili cook. Thanks to the many tips: added 1/4c brown sugar, 1/2 beer as part of the water requirement, shredded the pork.

Best Chili I've ever had with the following subtitutions/additions... I used ground pork and ground beef (2 lbs. of each), rather than 4 lbs. of 1" cubed pork shoulder. I added 1 cup of Guinness dark beer, plus 1 large green bell pepper (chopped). I also bumped up the garlic, jalapeno's, chili powder and cayenne somewhat to my individual taste and cooked in a Crock Pot for about 10 hours. It's the most flavorful and best tasting chili I've ever had, and is relatively easy to prepare! Enjoy!!!

Made this last night...only my second chili ever attempted. It is unbelievable! So thick and chunky, great flavors. I didn't seed the jalapenos, 'cause I like it spicy, but even then I could use a little more spice. Also substituted beer for the water and coffee, and a spicy minced salami for the bacon. Mmmm! Mmm!

Hands down thew best chili recipe I've tried. My supermarket only has bone-in pork shoulder, so preparing the pork is a pain; but the end result is worth it. This is a good dish for working parents, since you can cook it on a weekend and it keeps well in the fridge. Tastes better after a day or two.

A great great chili recipe. 2nd place in a chili cook off of 20, (and it was a total conspiracy that it lost- one of the three judges didn't like hot food?!?) I cooked the pork shoulder on the grill with some mesquite chips to get some smoky flavor to it. I really liked that a lot and would repeat it. I would not repeat putting the bacon on the BBQ as it was a firey inferno. As pork shoulder comes in big sections, plan on making a big pot of chili. Overall- delicious chili

Brought this to a Xmas party and it was a hit. A few tips - add about 1/2 C of brown sugar, and simmer at the lowest temp. possible. The meat turns out incredibly tender. I offered diced habaneros on the side to satisfy those who like the heat. Also, make it the day before and let it overnight in the fridge. We were concerned it was too watery when it came off the stove but it all came together overnight.

Easy, great tasting crowd pleaser. I've made this recipe twice already this fall and have had rave reviews each time. I substituted beer for most of the water, but careful not to add too much liquid. Don't forget to add the bacon at the end...the crispy bacon really completes this delicious alternative to beef chili.

Rating: 3
I used leftover Boston Butt from a Saturday BBQ. I only had 3lbs, so I added a pound of ground chuck which I browned with the onions and garlic. The recipe tasted fine, but I added alot more spices to suit my heat preference. Also, I don't consider any chili recipe complete if it doesn't include a little dark brown sugar. Just the slighest hint of that rich molasses sweetness helps balance the tomato acids and spicy heat.

Though dealing with trimming a pork shoulder roast is not my idea of a good time, the labor was worth the wonderful results. After the browning of the pork in the bacon grease I used beer to deglaze the pan and substituted this for the water. And call me crazy, but I also added some grated orange rind I had leftover from some baking I had done earlier in the week at the beginning of the 2-hour simmer, and though it didn't add much in the way of distinct flavor, it sure added nicely to the complex aroma of the chili.

I made a batch of this chili this afternoon to preview it in advance for our annual chili cook-off. It is excellent, the blend of flavors is just delightful. I doubled everything except the meat, I added 5 pounds of pork loin and 1 pound of bacon and it was plenty meaty. I goofed and added the bacon with the wet ingredients but it turned out just fine that way.Instead of adding 2 cans of tomatoes with puree, I added 1 and a large (28oz.) can of Rotel tomatoes with chilies. Very, very yummy indeed!

Prepared this last evening...a rainy portland night. Since evaluating a dish after you change it is pointless, I followed the recipe to the letter.

I halved the amount of pork and doubled the amount of chilies. Furthermore, I mixed some lime peel and juice and black pepper into the sour cream as an accompaniment; very, very tasty indeed! I also very much liked the use of bacon at the start of the recipe; this also enhances the flavour of the pork.

This was a really good base for a great chili. I added more beef broth because I like a little more liquid with the meat and beans. I also added grated carrot, black beans and 1 lb. of diced yams. Next time, I'll reduce the amount of meat, and be more generous with the veggies and beans, but that's just a personal preference. The family loved this with the suggested sides.

Somewhere between chile verde and Texax chili - very nice. My only real changes where more coffee and adding the juice from the canned beans.

Maybe next time I'll add a little chocolate, too.l

I made this using uncooked, left-over pork chops, left-over sausage and raw white and black beans in my slow cooker. It was absolutely delicious. After five or six hours, when the beans were soft, the meat was succulently tender. The pork adds a unique flavour to chili.

Very, very good. I ask our butcher to grind the pork fairly coursely, chili grind. I made my own chili powder so I knew what was in it. The coffee does it it a very unique layer.

Great Chili. Everyone liked it. It was a little hot - I think our homemade chili powder was a little heavy on the red pepper. I may leave out the jalapeno next time. I used less pork but ended up adding more beans and tomatoes to tone down the heat. I let it cook about 4-5 hours in a roaster and the meat was very tender. Served it with oyster crackers, shredded cheddar, sour cream and lime wedges. No one squeezed lime juice on their chili, but they got used in the Pepsi! Very good chili.

I first made this chili for family on Halloween (pre-trick or treating) and there were raves and I have made it a few times since. I do love it. And I did make a few modifications. Since I have three young children, I cut back on the spice by adding only one tablespoon of pure chili powder and one jalapeno. It still haad some kick. Less pork meat as the recipe calls for a fair amount. I have skipped the coffee, although other reviewers say it adds a lot. Instead of coffee and water, I add one bottle of good beer (Sierra Nevada Pale Ale). The key for me is adding the cooked beans at the last so it doesn't run into one big pot of mushy chili beans. For toppings, we strayed a little and had the bacon, cheddar cheese, red onions, cilantro, and sour cream with lime juice and lime zest added to add flavor. Delicious. And yes, the meat becomes tender and wonderful after simmering for so long.

A definite keeper! My picky-eater 9-year-old couldn't get enough. I used Penzey's (a local spice purveyor) chili powder, much fresher & tastier than the supermarket versions. My family loves spicy food; but sour cream and grated cheddar cheese garnishes help cut the heat for the more timid. Neuske's bacon - if you can get it - is best. And even coffee-haters can't taste the coffee. I skipped the tortilla chips and served with fresh-baked southern style (aka sweet) corn muffins. Perfect for a snowy Wisconsin weekend.

Searched and searched for a chili recipe with a bit of flair, and this was the one I tried. The addition of the coffee gave it an additional layer. I won an annual chili contest with it. It was the hands-down favorite because it is so textural, and the meat melts in one's mouth.

This dish is wonderful. I have made it several times, for chili and non-chili fans and everyone has asked for THIRDS!! Feeds a crowd well. Am serving it this year at our open-house, & everyone is coming just because of the chili!! would recommend to anyone looking to feed a crowd.

This chili was very flavorful. It was really good, and the meat was nice and tender. I put in three jalepenos and I thought that made it a nice spiciness but not too hot. This went over pretty well with a crowd.

Although pork in a chili sounded strange at first, this was a wonderful dish. One of my dinner guests was sensitive to spicy foods, so I only added half of one jalapeno pepper and no cayenne, but the dish was still full of flavor. Next time I'll add all the spices and see what happens.

I rarely, if ever, eat chili, so I am no expert. My husband, however, says that he is an expert, and this is excellent chili. He gives it four forks, hands down. I spiced it up a bit with deseeded japs (4). I give it three on its own, four with accoutrements (avocado, red onion, cilantro, squeeze of lime).

this is great! the coffee add an unusal depth to this. i added extra beans. i also used pork tenderloin to cut the fat and the cooking time.

We usually leave out the beans, and prefer it that way. Also, definately use all the jalapeno's -- we even add some cayenne, but we are hot food freaks. Avocado, raw onion (red), cilantro and sour cream on the side as garnishes. Also we use a bit less bacon, but that's a matter of taste. As strange as this recipe initially sounds, do try it if you like pork chile. It's truly outstanding.

I've made this twice, both times for large groups. So far the response has been excellent. All comments have been great. Also, it's not a spicy as the name leads you to believe, so use all the jalapenos.
