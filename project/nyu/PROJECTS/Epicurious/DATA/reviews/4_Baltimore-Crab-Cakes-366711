These were so easy and so yummy! Exactly what I was hoping for. I made them just like the recipe with no substitutions, refrigerated for about 1/2 an hour and had no problems with them breaking apart.

Excellent recipe. Did not change or omit any ingredients. I served it on a bed of lettuce with a side of fries for family dinner. Also served for friends, who were very impressed. These crab cakes do not compare to store bought ones. They are 100 times better.

These are by far the best at-home crab cakes I have ever had! I didn't use the jalenpeno or the scallions because I didn't have them on hand and substituted spicy brown mustard (a little less) for the Dijon.

One thing I forgot! I didn't freeze them or refrigerate them at all; I baked them as soon as I rolled them, b/c (again) I didn't have time. However, baking them at the smaller size they came out fine and didn't fall apart.

These were delicious! I made a modification - I didn't include jalapenos b/c I've never had them that way (Baltimore native), but otherwise followed the recipe, and they tasted quite good.___ Separately, I did the following: I made crab balls instead, using my ice cream scoop, which made about 17. I baked them (as another poster suggested) at 375, in a glass pan lightly oiled, for about 20 minutes and then rolled them over and baked another 6 minutes or so. I did this b/c I didn't have time to fry them, but I think they came out great - the panko crisped up and it was moist on the inside.

Wow these are quite good - restaurant quality for sure! I used steamed crab i found at our local food store. I followed someone else suggestion and an extra egg to the crab and let sit in the refrigerator for a bit. I followed everything else but went a little heavier on the old bay and threw in a bit more panko. Next time i may throw in an extra scallion and rev up the spices even more! I shaped into 15 small patties, froze for 25 min and refrigerated for 20 and they did not fall apart! I fried in 1/2 cup olive oil and drained on paper towels and served as an appetizer (with lemon) on Christmas Eve for my Italian family! It was very good and will make again!!!! Yummm!

This is simply the best crab cake recipe. What I have been searching for. I got close on my own but the balance of flavors in this recipe is perfect. It's in my recipe box and the go to crab cake.

This is probably the best crab cake recipe on Epicurious. I used to live in the DC area and had my share of fabulous food at Baltimore's Inner Harbor, and I never encountered jalapenos in Charm City cuisine. So I replaced that ingredient with a bit of more authentic cayenne. I've made these twice and have not had a problem with them sticking together. I halve the recipe and make two four two-ounce crab cakes to serve two for dinner.

Really enjoyed these crab cakes. Easy, quick & very tasty. Not overladen with breading either.

Made these again 2 days ago. They are fantastic. The key to getting them to stick together....2 eggs, about 25 minutes in the freezer, then in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. I bake them at 375 for 25 minutes instead of frying....less messy and slightly more healthy.

Easy and tasteful-no need for any kind of sauce!

I made this for the first time to serve to some foodie friends who were coming over and the reviews were unbelievable. After reading some of the other reviews I made the cakes several hours ahead and refrigerated them. When I flipped them in the pan they remained perfectly intact. I followed the recipe exactly but I served it on a bed of arugula, which they liked as well.

Delicious! This recipe lets the crab stand out and the panko adds nice crisp. I served over mixed greens with a lemon vinaigrette and some garlic aioli.

Unbelievable! I made these on vacation last week with fresh, local NC crab, and they were amazing. Would recommend letting them rest for at least 30 minutes in the fridge, though. I followed the 10-minute suggestion in the recipe, and three of the six fell apart. Great flavor and the panko really makes them light and crispy. My husband and brother-in-law loved them!

I'm a Maryland native and have been having a hankering for crabcakes. This recipe is outstanding. Will use again. Will need to use other reviewers advice about the egg/crab because mine did fall apart despite being in the freezer for 10+minutes. But delicious all the same!

This would be 4 forks if it called for just the 1 tsp of Old Bay! I made these with a tad less crumb than called for, and of course they barely held together, which was fine - I was being conservative. I used canned Ocean's crab and they turned out great except for being a bit overseasoned. I had them over butterlettuce dressed with a bit of white balsamic (which I would skip next time), and then a quick salsa of nectarine, avocado, lime juice and a tad of white balsamic and grapeseed oil. Highly recommend the salsa on top - the sweetness and richness really complemented!

Pretty great, I have to admit---and I'm from DC (where we really don't like to think that B'more has anything on us.) An idea: Rather than refrigerate the pre-cooked cakes for an hour (or more), wrap them tightly in saran wrap and put in the freezer for around 10 minutes. That way you can broil or fry without the cakes breaking apart. Also, a bit of Asian Sirriacchi (spelling, I know...)really brightens and adds subtle heat to this dish.

I was looking for a recipe for fish cakes to use leftover grilled halibut, but they all seemed so bland. So instead I tried this one, adjusting the amount of the ingredients based on the amount of fish that was available. I added the panko last until i had a mixture that would just hold together. It was outstanding! Can't wait to try it with crab :-)

My husband, who is very good in the kitchen, made this recipe. He screwed up the recipe and it still turned out awesome. I can't imagine what it will taste like when the directions are followed. Yummy, yummy in my tummy.

This was super easy and super delicious. My non-cook spouse followed the recipe and made this when I was recovering from knee surgery all by himself.

This was my first ever crab cakes experience & they came out delicious I served it with an avocado & peach salad also from this site and it was a great combo....

These were a hit! I refrigerated them for about 2 hours and had no problem with them falling apart while flipping over medium heat in a regular skillet. The golden color they acquire is mouthwatering. It makes a big difference to have the freshest crabmeat from your fishmonger instead of the prepackaged, undated stuff you find at the grocery store.

I think it's fair to say that most of us native Marylanders have our favorite crab cake recipe. I now have a new one...these are Charm City perfect through and through! I have a gluten allergy, and was able to tweak the recipe without any compromise to the taste or texture. Instead of panko, I used tortilla crumbs (available in specialty stores), but reduced the amount by 1/3 cup. It had all of the crunch I wanted, with excellent binding.

Delicious. Made them as per the recipe though I used more panko crumbs to stretch them a little, they were delicious. Served with an asian cole slaw and a lovely Pinot Gris wine. Will make these many more times.

I hardly ever write a review...but this was exceptional. Made it exactly by the recipe. Really important to hold them over in the fridge for an hour or so. Made them with dungeness crab. Rave reviews.

DELICIOUS and easy to make. I subbed in half a tsp of Sriracha for the jalapeno. Only problem was, most of my cakes fell apart in the pan, even though I'd chilled them for 24 hours in the fridge--will try thinner cakes next time, and maybe adding another egg. But the flavor was to die for--and this is coming from a Baltimore native!

Used good quality canned crab, only 1 tsp of Old Bay, a sprinkle of cayenne instead of jalepeno and scallions(didnt have); froze the cakes for 10 min before frying (didn't add extra egg or panko) and these turned out rockstar good.Only thing they needed was a good squeeze of lemon before serving to cut a little of the richness of the crab.

Rating: 4
Added note: instead of the jalapeno, I used 1/2 tsp Sriracha hot sauce. Perfect.

We enjoyed this recipe on our Christmas Eve buffet. I used my size 60 food scoop to make (large-ish)bitesized patties, froze them for 20 min then transferred to frig to hold. Just before frying I scooted them all together -- they were holding together very well -- and sprinkled panko over the top and pressed it in. Never did panko the bottoms. Fry then bake -- yum!

This was my first time making crab cakes and this recipe makes it seem so easy. Made according to the recipe and loved the flavor. The leftovers were even better the next day.

Look no further! This recipe is easy and fall-over-dead delicious. Even with (relatively) cheap canned crab it's great. I served them with a side sauce of mayo, lemon juice and franks red hot sauce.

This recipe is delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe states. Make sure you refrigerate the crab cakes AT LEAST 10 minutes or they will fall apart.

Agree these rank among the best Crab Cakes I've ever made or ate. In Ohio so had to resort to pasteurized crab and was low on panko so used a combo of regular and panko (slightly less than 3/4 cup due to density of regular crumbs)in the cakes and coated with panko. Also took the advise to add egg to crab and let sit before adding other ingredients. They were still a bit crumbly but not impossible to form or fry. Next time I might add an additional egg to the mayo mixture as suggested by another reviewer! Also used the whole jalapeno-not too spicy at all!!!!

I am from Baltimore and crab cakes are the most favorite and known recipes. However this recipe is THE BEST. You need GOOD crab meat,yes IT IS EXPENSIVE to buy lump crab meat, however crab cakes are not EVERYDAY food. I use parsley as I dont have chives. Also instead of jalapeno, I use Siracha (1/2 tsp). I fry quickly on medium high to brown both sides then put in the 375F oven for 10 mns. They are DELICIOUS!

I've had many Maryland crab cakes at restaurants high and low over the years but this recipe with the subtle jalepenos and panko instead of white bread crumbs is the best I've ever made myself and a complete rival to the best I've had. Annapolis, MD

So delicious and very easy to put together! The only change I made was to use some minced sweet red pepper along with a tiny bit of jalapeño since I was serving it to my kids and didn't want the crab cakes to be too spicy.

i love this recipe! it's easy and flavorful. i also followed the advice to mix the egg and crab together first, and the cakes held together no problem. a keeper.

These were outstanding crab cakes! I made just a few modifications - I took the suggestion of another reviewer and mixed the egg in with the crab prior to mixing the other ingredients. Also, I added an additional egg when I made the mayo mixture. I had no trouble at all with them staying together. I did not have lemon on hand so used fresh limes instead which was great. Fresh crab is definitely what you should use. I made these smaller for a party (a double batch made 40 cakes) and served with a chili sauce, horseradish sauce and a dijon sauce - everyone raved about them, thanks for the great recipe!

These were really great crab cakes! They were moist and flavorful but nice and crunchy on the outside. They were also pretty easy to make and didn't use too much mayo, which I liked! Delicious just with a slice of lemon, this will probably become my go-to recipe for crabcakes.

May I suggest.. Mix egg with crab first, allow to sit briefly 5-10 min. or so, then add other ingredients. Your cakes will then stay together better. wonderful recipe, fresh crab does make a difference.

Stayed together really well and tasted fantastic. To keep them from falling apart I would ensure you chill them for the whole 10 minutes and let them brown up well on one side before you flip.

These were excellent - easy to make, they stayed together well and browned nicely. They tasted close to what I've had in Baltimore or Annapolis. (fresh crabmeat probably makes the difference!)

These were, quite honestly, the best crab cakes I've ever had. Half of them fell apart as I was frying them, but they didn't taste any different. Since it was just a family dinner, it was fine, but I'm still trying to figure out what I could do differently so they don't fall apart when I make them next time. Also, I fried them for a bit longer, so they would be a bit crispier on each side. All in all, a FANTASTIC recipe!!

I was fortunate enough to have Blue Crab from the previous evenings crab cook, I didnt have some the ingredients on hand such as Jalapeno or Old Bay but I think it came out awesome. I think the fresh crab made it that much better!
