Perfect side dish for Fall - could not be easier and the browned butter cuts some of the sweetness of the squash. So good - sprinkle with some sea salt right before serving!

Like some of the other reviewers, I was a little skeptical about this recipe because it looked so simple, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was very tasty! I didn't have rosemary on hand, so I used some nutmeg, salt, and pepper, and it was still very good. I think I might cut down on the butter to try to make it healthier though.

So easy! I prefer to roast the squash in the oven at 400 because I prefer the consistency. Also, I cut down on the butter a little bit. I have also tried with fresh grated nutmeg with good salt in place of rosemary, which is fabulous!

This dish was a hit at Thanksgiving. Everyone raved about it. The browned butter gives it so much flavor. I will definately make this again.

This dish was a hit at Thanksgiving. I agree that it does needs to be steamed longer than the 5 minutes. Definately my new favorite!

I was disappointed with this recipe. The rosemary with the squash was nice but needed something extra. There are so many other good recipes for squash purees I'd make instead.

I made this dish for thanksgiving, and it was delicious. To tell the truth, I ran out of butter, and did not have time to run to the store, so I made it without, and it was still GREAT!

This dish was delicious! I made it for my gourmet group and I almost passed on it because it was so simple. Boy am I glad I didn't. The flavors are unbelievable.

This is a favorite with my family for holidays. One of our 'most requested'. I agree with the last reviewer about the steaming time. You've got to get this nice and soft so that the browned butter permeates the dish. Fabulous!

While I don't think the timing is near correct for the steaming (it took much longer than 5 minutes, and my squash was still too firm), this tastes great. I made the butter with sage, fresh from the garden, and it was wonderful. Served with meatloat, green beans and mashed potatoes. An easy, comfort food dinner with friends.

I've made this with leftover baked squash (rather than steamed) and sage (as well as rosemary) -- wow! Easy, but delicious (has to be the browned butter)

Extremely easy and delicious to eat, the whole family thought it was wonderful.
