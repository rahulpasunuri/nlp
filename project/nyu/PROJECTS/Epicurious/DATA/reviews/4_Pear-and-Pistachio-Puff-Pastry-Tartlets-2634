The pistachio filling and poached pears were delicious. I love puff pastry, but the next time I make it I'll use a different crust. I don't think the puff pastry held up well to the rest, and got soggy despite the fact that I used less glaze than the recipe stated. Regardless, it's delicious and I will make it again with a non-puff crust.

Giving 4 forks for my modified version. The stated recipe would get 3 forks. I made this tart twice: once according to the recipe (except for using pate brisee instead of puff pastry) and then the second time I toasted the pistachios and added lemon zest to the filling. Both of these steps REALLY enhanced the flavor, in my opinion. Plus, toasting the pistachios makes for a more solid frangipane that cuts and presents better. Also, the real vanilla bean is worth it in this recipe too, as vanilla extract won't hold up to simmering.

This was fantastic, even as my first experiment in tartlet baking. I modified the recipe and made my own crust (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/236385) after discovering that Whole Foods wanted $9 for frozen puff pastry. One word of caution: the assembly instructions are a bit unclear so they'll require some advance strategy and improvisation to conquer. But the smell of the pears stewing in the vanilla-infused dessert wine alone was enough to sell me on this dish. For presentation purposes, I'd suggest thinly slicing and fanning the pear once it's drained. Well worth the effort.

I made these tarts smaller as part of a brunch. They were yummy. Made a boo boo and bought cashews instead of pistachios but it still tasted great. Also kind of showy. You can wow people a little with this one.

A friend made this for a dinner party and it was delicious.

I work as a pastry chef for a country club. I served this dish and the customers absolutely raved about this dish. I can't say how it tasted because I never got to try it. I can say however that it was very easy to make and I will definately make it at home so I can try some.
