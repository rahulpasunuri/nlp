If you adhere to the given cooking time, make sure your beef is very fresh. I would add it before the mushrooms and let it cook for a total of 20 minutes.

It didn't look too pretty, but it was good comfort food. My three year old tolerated--almost liked-- it, so we'll definitely be having it again.

So GOOD! Just so happened to have ground beef on hand and was looking for something different to do with it. SO GLAD I FOUND THIS! I can definitely see why it was used for late night fuel at a bar! :o) We added cheddar cheese which I highly recommend and used half the spinach. Delicious! Make sure you use the leanest meat possible because it does get greasy...

While I love spinach and garlic (and like all of the other ingredients in this dish), I didn't care for them combined in this way. This would probably make for a good campfire meal; it reminded me of something my sister calls "slop" (which is basically ground hamburg cooked in a skillet with an assortment of veggies thrown in).

I most heartily agree with Amy! This was a wonderful dish and makes for a excellent earl-riser breakfeast/late night debauch dish (the choice be yours). It goes wonderully with a strong cup of coffee and a bright sun-rise!

I thought this was great! I only eat high protein/low carb so it fit right in my evil plan. I only used one onion and probably less mushrooms than it called for, I didn't measure. My husband loved it too. the history lesson with dinner made it taste that much better...

This was great! AS another reviwer mentioned, not very eggy, but I was pleasantly surprised by that. I substitued ground turkey for the beef, used a Walla Walla sweet onion, and added chopped tomatoes with the eggs. Colorful and tasty! Will definitely make this again, and probably experiment by adding more veggies! I can imagine a red bell pepper would be perfect in this...

This was okay, we did eat it, but not what I expected. Not very "eggy" but lots of beef. Reminded me of a hamburger helper sort of dish.

This was a great brunch dish I served for a picky bunch of breakfast eaters. My husband likes his meat so I thought this would be a perfect hit instead of quiche. It went over great and I will make it again for fathers day.

A simple, fast and yummy supper recipe. Using extra-lean ground beef, no olive oil and egg whites makes it a great high-protein meal.

This is so good! Great with toasted garlic bread. I had made it long ago from Best of Sunset Magazine's cookbook and was glad to be reminded of it again. Not exactly low fat but worth a splurge. Served with Potatoes Anna for a really great Sunday supper.
