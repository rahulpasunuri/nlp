Very tasty and easy to prepare. The flavors were wonderful. Make sure you have a baguette to take care of the flavorful stew sauce.

This recipe is excellent. Even my chili cheese dog, nacho eating boyfriend liked it haha. I couldn't find Thai or Serrano chili's in my small town grocery store, so I just substituted with a bit of jalepeno. I could tell it wasn't a perfect match though. Next time I will use thai chili paste.

Amazing flavor! I finally got to use huge quantities of the porcini mushrooms I brought back from Northern Italy last summer! I served this with a loaf of French bread and asparagus on the side. A bottle of dry white completed the meal.

I made this recipe exactly as described and it turned out very good. It is not an every day dinner, but is better suited when it is cold out and you want a little extra indulgence as it is heavy and satisfying. I served it was Risotto Milanese which was perfect. Also serve a very hearty and rich red wine with it. The recipe would work with chicken or beef if you are really not into veal.

Delicious served over baked polenta, it does need a little more salt than the recipe calls for added at the end.

If anyone was disappointed with this recipe, they should surely try to do it again. The recipe is not complicated and the flavors blend perfectly for a sublime and thouroughly enjoyable second course. This will no doubt be added to my signature dishes!

This was so delicious and very easy. I don't like to eat veal so I substituted beef should. The flavors were so intense and complex. I highly suggest the meal.

a real disappointment. Wish I had made chicken instead.
