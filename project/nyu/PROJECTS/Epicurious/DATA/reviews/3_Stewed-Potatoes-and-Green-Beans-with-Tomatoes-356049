Yuk. Pretty in pot but not much happening taste-wise. Wont make this again. We have an aversion to maters/taters but wanted to give this a try.

This is an awesome dish. We had some friends over and didn't get to save the rest for leftovers, so we just made some more the next night. It's quick and easy and I know we'll be making it again. We didn't add anything extra to soup. The recipe was perfect for us.

This was really tasty! I made it to go with the smothered pork chops but I think it would also be a delicious side dish with seafood as well. Really sad that this was the last issue! Everyone loved it at my house.
