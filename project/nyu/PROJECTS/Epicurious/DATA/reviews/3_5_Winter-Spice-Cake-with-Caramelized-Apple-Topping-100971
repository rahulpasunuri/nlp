At first glance this recipe seemed daunting, but in reality it was quite simple, it just took a lot of bowls pots and pans. Absolutely delicious, very moist, without the caramel it is a perfect brunch coffee cake not overly sweet, with the caramel and some whipped cream it was transformed into a decadent dessert.

I decided to make this recipe after my husband asked me for a ginger apple cake. The name of this cake seemed to fit the bill, so I complied and our whole family was so glad I did! I made it using whole spelt flour (my son is allergic to wheat) and even then, the cake was moist, tender and delicious. Often, recipes count on the toppings/frostings to give a cake its tastiness, but this cake could stand on its own! That said, the apples and caramel topping were the perfect accompaniment. To sum up, I'm putting this one in my recipe book. Delicious and worth every step!

I read several reviews that were disappointed in the apple topping but they had not used Golden Delicious apples. They are essential to success here as they hold their shape when cooked. Otherwise you are risking having apple sauce. Came out lovely for an afternoon tea.

Lovely cake - however it is time consuming. The caramel only took 4mins to become golden and started to burn thereafter. Cake took 1 hour to cook.Great Winter cake.

I gave this 3 forks because although it was very good, I was expecting a little more wow factor with all the preparation time it took. But other than time consuming, the recipe was very exact and good. I never bake and I followed the directions and the cake and caramel sauce came out perfectly. I used splenda to flavor the apples instead of sugar but used sugar in the other parts of the recipe and it all tasted great. I served it with light cool whip and topped it with the caramel sauce and it made for the perfect dessert.

This was very satisfying to eat. I made it for a night that we had company, so I really needed a good dessert. However, it did take a bit of time. I did use storebought caramel, which saved me time and effort, and everyone still raved about it! Definately use parchment paper, and spray it with oil. Use apples that keep their shape and it will look much better. The batter itself was worth licking off the beaters! We really enjoyed it, and after our company left, my husband had to have seconds!

Lots of work and it came out "okay" but I wouldn't make it again. My Granny Smith's came out mushy, caramel was runny and in the end, it tasted like a regular spice cake with gooshy fruit on top. Oh well.

I made this cake for Christmas Eve and it was a huge hit with the family. The warm caramel sauce makes it special, and can be used later over ice cream or in coffee. Use a standing mixer if you can.

This cake is really, really good. But, there is one thing wrong with the recipe - timing. The main problem is the amount of time the caramelization steps are supposed to take. After browning the apples, the pan is still very hot, and it will NOT take 7 minutes to caramelize the butter and sugar. Mine was done in about 2 minutes, and I was able to recognize this because I've made caramel many times before. Also, a non-stick pan is not necessary, but wrapping the springform pan in foil is, unless you like goo all over your oven. And be sure to let the caramel pan cool down before you lick it. :) And this cake tastes great the next day, but it's not as pretty. I actually prepped the apples and sauce, and prepped the dry ingredients and wet ingredients before my dinner guests arrived. Then, right before dinner, I combined everything and popped it in the oven. This way, I was able to serve warm cake to my guests, but I could still socialize with them before dinner.

We really liked to make this cake! It was an amazing show with the carmal sauce and cream. It almost went over the pan, so be careful! I would definatly make this recipe again!

The spice flavors, combined with caramel and apples made for a tasty cake, especially when served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I had absolutely no trouble with the fat separating from the caramel, but I did burn one batch and had to start over. You must not leave it unattended. I had a timer set, but it burned at six minutes. The second time around was quite successful. This cake is best eaten the day it is made. Each slice can be warmed in the microwave oven for a few seconds before serving, so it can be made early on the day for serving, but don't try making it the day before.

Try serving it warm from the oven! You'd (we hope) avoid the the oil/grease problem that separates from the caramel - it ruined the presentation of ours. We would try it again but we'll use the caramel sauce recipe from the Bon Appetit soufflé cooking class instead. The cake itself was moist & lightly crunchy on the edges. Didn't try adding the milk per one cook's suggestion (to bind the grease back into the caramel sauce).

I served this for a sit down dinner party of 8, the presentation was excellant! Yes, this is very time consuming and it doesn't last, must be made on the day that it is being served. Served it with whipping cream with just a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg

This was incredible! I used Granny Smiths because I wanted a more tart apple topping. They don't hold their shape well when cooked so the top wasn't pretty but the flavor was incredible. If you have trouble with the caramel separating when reheating, stir in a little milk. It will pull the sauce back together again. Also, I added a little salt to the caramel sauce.

Read the other reviewer's comments and used purchased caramel from Whole Foods. Came out perfectly and in much less time. Used parchment instead of foil - a good step. Topped with whipped cream - beautiful and yummy.

I seem to be in the minority, but I wouldn't make this again. It was time consuming; however, I really did enjoy the process. I guess I was feeling particularly domestic or something. Nevertheless, the end product just wasn't good enough for me to be willing to do it again.

Really delicious and a beautiful presentation. I did not care for the caramel sauce... it kept separating on me and was quite oily. I would prefer using store bought caramel or melting caramels instead of the homemade. I think that would be more stable. The reheated homemade caramel's texture was not appealing either... That said, it and the cake was delicious. I will definitely make again, but think I will try prepared caramel.

Delicious! I made this for a dinner party we were invited to, and every bit was devoured. Dinner guests fought over the extra caramel sauce. Great with whipped cream.

What a delicious cake! I served it hot with ice-cream and it was wonderful! Yes, it's a little involved but well worth the effort - everyone I make this for requests the recipe (and one of them runs a very successful restaurant!) I was a bit dubious about the ginger but added it as specified in the recipe and it blends fantastically with the other spices! I found that I needed to saute the apples a little longer to get the deep brown colour and the caramel sauce browns very quickly so watch it carefully!!

This cake is truly delicious. I made it for a St. Patrick's day dinner and then for Thanksgiving. Everyone who tried it loved it. A bit work intensive, but more than worth it.

I have made this cake several times, and each time I make it, I am struck anew at how good it is. I really like the texture of the cake. It is also one of my husband's favorites, and he has chosen it for a birthday cake ever since we first tried it (which has only been twice, but still. . .)

This cake was delicious. I will make it again. Using store bought caramel would probably cut prep time by at least half but might not be as good as homemade???????I would even just use the cake recipe if I wasn't a fan of apples.

I absolutely love this recipe... I've made it 5 times now, and it gets better each time. I think it just takes a few tries to get the carmel part just right. Other than that, it is delicious and really a treat to serve to guests.

A little complicated but well worth the results. Made it for a St Patty's day party and got rave reviews

This was delicious! I made it last minute, and it worked without the vinegar. It does take some effort, but it is well worth it!

I expected to like this cake more than I did. The caramel sauce was a bit chewy. (I may have overcooked it, but I followed the times pretty closely.) When I reheated the sauce, it got even chewier and a bit 'greasy' -- the butter seemed to separate from the sugar a bit. The cake was good, but didn't taste as rich as it should have given all the butter and sour cream.

I have made this dish several times and it has been a smash hit each time! The carmel sauce really makes the dessert and I always get rave reviews. It is a little work, but worth it in the end!!

I made this recipe and found it to be good but thought that the apples weren't sweet enough. I was disappointed in the results of reheating the caramel sauce. I may have to try it again since everyone seems to rave about thier results when they made it. I found the Plum Upside Down cake to be much better.

We prepared this cake as one of our desserts for our fine dining restaurant and it was a hit! Sold every piece. A lot of steps to prepare, but it was worth it.

I made this for a dinner group of 10, and it was the hit of the evening. This is the dish people are still talking about. It is worth the effort 100%.

Rave reviews all around. Great served warmed with the warm caramel sauce and good quality vanilla ice cream. I used golden delicious apples and found the suggested timing of the recipe to be very accurate.
