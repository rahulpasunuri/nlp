I really liked the additions made by A Cook from Vancouver, BC.

It's a miserable wet/foggy weekend, so yesterday I made a big pot of clam chowder to warm our spirits. My favourite recipe calls for fish stock and I used this stock recipe as a starting point. To the ingredient list I added 3 cloves garlic, 6-8 stems each fresh parsley and thyme, lemon juice instead of vinegar, increased peppercorns to a scant 1 tbsp. and added 1 cup white wine. Hanging out in a lonely corner of my freezer I found a bag of raw mixed seafood (octopus, squid, shrimp, clams, mussels) and another bag of raw extra-large unpeeled shrimp. I had purchased both sometime during the winter and then forgot about them, so they were well past prime (yes, shame on me!) and destined for the soup pot. Seems you can make a silk purse from a sow's ear because this was the best fish stock I have ever made! It was flavourful to the max and made a scrumptious chowder. So, if you find some fish/seafood hibernating in your freezer.....
