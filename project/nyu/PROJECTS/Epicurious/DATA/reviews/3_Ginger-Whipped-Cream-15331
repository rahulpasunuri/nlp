Delicious whipped cream. I did not fold in the candied ginger but instead only sprinkled it on top. As a result, I may add a touch more ground ginger next time I make this whipped cream.

I made this with the Sour Cream apple pie and it was amazing. I also served it with pumpkin pie and it was even better!

Is it just me or is it just too weird to have chunks in whipped cream? The ground ginger was great, and the candied ginger for garnish was attractive, but I felt compelled to let my guests know what the "chunks" were in the whipped cream.

This is gooo-hoooooood!!! Great on the apple pie, and excellent on gingerbread. I thought it would be too gingery, but instead it's very light, clean and subtle. A keeper!!

Very good with the Sour Cream Apple Pie, but I think this stuff would be good with lots of stuff -- fresh fruit (for dipping), other apple desserts, floating atop hot apple cider, you name it. Quite nice.
