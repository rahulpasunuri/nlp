maybe i did something wrong but this soup came out so bland. i didnt have spinach so i left those out but i cant imagine that made a huge difference ...

This combination of ingredients miraculously adds up to be much more delicious and special than you might think.

Totally wonderful. I substituted chicken broth for the 2 cups water. Wish I'd had fresh dill - dried was OK but not as good, I'm sure. I guess we don't eat a lot - this made four generous servings for us!

While looking for a vegetable soup recipe, I found this gem and WOW. We all loved it. Even my four-yr old asked for another bowl. Added some kale, an extra potato and large shrimp because I had those on hand and used milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2. No need for the extra fat since there is so much flavor. This is going in the "regulars" list for us.

Boy did this soup suprise me! Some family members even went for thirds. . . (I just used the 1% milk we had on hand instead of 1/2 and 1/2, and it turned out great) PS serve with some nice crusty bread

Nice soup. I used milk instead of half and half and didn't have any dill or sherry but it was still good.

This is a very rich, slightly sweet but fantastic dish!
