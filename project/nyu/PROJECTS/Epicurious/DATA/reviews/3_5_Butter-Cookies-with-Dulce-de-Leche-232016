I found the cookies just great, truly lovely, For the purist, though, make the dulce de leche from scratch. Sure, it takes 3 hours plus of stirring, but the result is so extraordinary you'll never buy it prepared again.

I made a few small changes to the recipe and it yielded fabulous alfajores-- just like I get a local taquerias. I didn't have any Pisco, so I substituted a teaspoon of lemon juice and an extra teaspoon of vanilla. Some of the previous review complained about the crumbliness of the cookie. I've tasted many of these cookies from various Latin American eateries, and I'm pretty sure that they are supposed to be crumbly. I think it's a great texture contrast with the smoothness of the dulce de leche. I recommend chilling the dough before rolling it out. I will also double the recipe next time because it did not yield 16 cookies!

Delicious cookies. I had no problem with the dough, tried to use the least amount of extra flour as possible. Also wouldn't go any sweeter with dough as dulce de leche is very sweet. One mistake that I made was to put too much DDL on the cookie because once I made the sandwich, over a few minutes it poured out. Finally, I rolled the sides in finely chopped pecans at the end - came out good.

Too difficult to make.

I thought that these were really good but I too found that they were a bit crumbly. My mom and I both tried them and thought they needed a lot of dulce de leche and maybe some more confectioners sugar...I'll definitely try this again if only to make it a little more perfect. Very easy, though, and hard to mess up!

I've made this recipe quite a few times. I tried it first with the Pisco but didn't like the taste as much and opted for Brandy instead. While it does take time to find the exact texture you want for your cookie I find that if you add too much flour while rolling out the dough it will become crumbly. An easier way to roll out the dough is to chill it some and then roll it out to at least 1/8" thickness. As for the Dulce de Leche you can either make your own or as I have done, purchase it pre-made. Especially if you are going to be using it more than one recipe. Also try the Dulce de Leche Flan it is outstanding!

LOVED THEM!! With some misgivings I used the reviewer's suggestion to make the dulce de leche by cooking the unopened can of milk--worked perfectly (I guess, not having made or even eaten dulce de leche before!) Not overly sweet and subtle but not at all tasteless.

I was disappointed at the dry, crumby texture of the cookies. The end result was a bit of a mess. I love dulce de leche and decided to make these cookies with a soft sugar cookie recipe I had and had much better results.

These were disappointing. The cookie, as others have commented are not very tasty. I tried adding some brandy for flavor, but that didn't do it. Still looking for a great dulce de leche cookie.

Dulce de Leche was tasty but the cookie was, eh. There has to be a better butter cookie recipe. I found they came out grainy.

We just returned from Argentina where we ate our fill of dulce de leche "everything" YUM!!! These cookies are very close to the ones we were eating there. The bakery we visited rolled the sides in small flakes of sweetened coconut. I will make these again.

I understand why others were dissapointed, because they felt there was no flavor. But I thought this was delicious, just the flavor of the powder sugar on the cookies (which I thought were good as well) and the creamy dulche de leche was enough...great for kids and with milk, oh and some strawberries...yum! Very rich, creamy and sweet...how can it be bad!

Had no flavor, except for the filling, cookies were blah, too hard not worth the effort. Slap two vanilla wafer around some dulce de leche and you have an instant no cook winner.

I'm a native from Chile where alfajores are a treat. Your recipe is very close to the one we use at home, except we add a little Pisco to the Dulce de Leche too(or Manjar Blanco, as is known there).This mixture is not only used to paste the 2 cookies together, but we spread it arround the edges of the cookies as well. We take the cookies that may have been broken and mash them to a meal consistency, we roll the edge of the covered cookies on the mashed cookies for appeal. You can buy Dulce de Leche from Nestle,but we prefer to make our own from Sweet Condensed Milk, not evaporated milk,by covering the unopened cans with at least 1 in. of water in a deep pot, setting them on their side. Cooking time: 2 1/2 hrs. in conventional pot or 45 min. in a pressure cooker. If using the coventional method, you must be alert to prevent that water is always covering the cans for even cooking and to avoid the cans from bursting.This method is safe, but not recommended by the milk manufacturers. I have not used the cans with pull top lids.

I'm disappoined in these cookies. They looked cool but were completely tasteless. I bought the Dulce De Leche from a specialty store, it is very creamy but surprisingly little taste. If I try this again I will follow a shortbread receipe instead of the butter cookie as they were bland. I did add some cinnamon sprinkles along with the powerdered sugar for a little more color and taste.
