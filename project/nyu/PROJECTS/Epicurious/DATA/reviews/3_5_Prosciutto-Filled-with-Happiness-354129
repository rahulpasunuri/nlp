The concept may be fine but the whole was much less than the sum of the parts. Awful!

Made these for Christmas Eve two years ago - a big hit. They're delicious and pretty. The only drawback is that, as a previous reviewer mentioned, they're tedious to assemble. I'm making them again am thankful for the common sense suggestion from Stella to combine all the ingredients before spreading on the prosciutto.

This recipe was a BIG hit at work! Everyone loved it! I used chopped dates and it was unbelievable with the gorgonzola and arugula. I coarsely chopped some almonds as well.... Everything combined tastefully :) Assembly wasnt a big deal; I mixed everything and wrapped it all in our work kitchen. I would definitely make this appetizer again.

I have made these several times now for appetizer receptions and they are always a huge hit - very pretty as well. I leave a 1/2 inch at the bottom to fold in over the filling before you roll so nothing falls out.

very good and easy to make, the cheese and the prosciutto stand out, so add more (relativly) currants and arugula

I'm giving it 3 forks since it's sort of tedious to assemble. But mixing all the ingredients together made it easier. It got rave reviews at Thanksgiving. I chopped up some cilantro since I didn't have any arugula, which worked fine. Make sure to ask the deli to slice the prosciutto just a tiny bit thicker instead of buying the pre-sliced/packaged prosciutto.

I have to change this to 4 forks. Everyone loved these on Thanksgiving. I had to give the reciped to a few people. Very, very tasty! And easy to make once you mix the cheese, currants & pine nuts together.

A bit of a mess, so I mixed the cheese, pine nuts & currants together and just put a portion on each slice of arugula. Much easier to assemble that way

This was good--and looked pretty -- was something different than the pedestrian cream cheese based dips and appetizers easily served for Thanksgiving.

Definitely yummy, but it was a little trickier to assemble than expected. Finally hit my stride near the end of them - it's helpful to leave a least a half inch of space at the end, so the proscuitto can stick to itself at the end of the roll - otherwise they don't hold together very well. Guests were happy! Flavor combo is quite good. Am thinking about also trying with thinly sliced smoked salmon.

This looked good in the photo and sounded good. My prosciutto was sliced a bit too thin so I had to use a whole piece, roll all the ingredients into it and use a toothpick to keep it from unrolling. I don't see how 1/2 a piece of prosciutto would work if you want to get a good mix of the flavors. I ened up using 1/2 C toasted pine nuts. I gave it 2 stars because it was very tasty but it was not worth the effort.
