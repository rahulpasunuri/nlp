This is a great recipie, but it IS awfully rich (I know, I know, they warned me in the preamble) but it is worth trying nonetheless. I love the taste that the parma brings to the asparagus. Next time I'll cut down the amount of butter by about 2/3 and add some olive oil instead.

Very good asparagus. I skipped the peeling bit as I was in a crunch for time. I like the crunch of the raw asparagus bits and who can say no to parm reg?

Simple and delicious.

Loved this as did the family. Only thing different I did was add a splash of lemon juice just before I added the parmesan.

I was easily able to make it into a past dish too by tossing in some noodles and a little extra olive oil! Delicious!

Very tasty. I used Ramano cheese and it was too pungant. I would use Parmigano next time.

The best EVER! Even my husband at it. I used danish butter and it added a little extra yum. I didn't bundle them, just boiled loose--it worked perfect.

This was OK, but a lot of fuss, when you can get similar or better results by simply drizzling spears with olive oil, seasoned salt mix (not lawrys) and roasting in the oven. The raw bits were nice, though.

This was REALLY easy to make, and the best asparagus I've ever had! Don't bother bundling. Just drain water when cooked - much easier! We used butter substitute (canola spread) instead of real thing and it was heaven. The raw pieces were surprisingly delicious.

I love asparagus, so this recipe appealed to me. It is simple and makes a great quick-to-prepare side dish. M.C.

I made this with Baby Broccoli instead of asparagus and found it to work well.

Much better recipes available for asparagus. I didn't quite appreciate the crunchy topping!

Quick and easy. I skipped the peeling, olive oil and sprinkling and it was still awesome. Not alot of parmesean needed.

This so easy and very good...adds to just serving plain asparagus! Doesn't need alot of butter, nor parmesan to get the flavors!

Delicious, easy, perfect! What a great twist to the usual "steamed" asparagus with hollandaise. Thank you for the recipe!

I loved this recipe. Very simple, so tasty. I had a bunch of asparagus that was just hanging around looking for a good time. Used that (unpeeled 'cuz I'm lazy) and just a chunk of butter- it's perfect.

As others have stated, I didn't use the olive oil-it seemed like too much grease added to the plentiful butter. I had a problem with the distribution of my parm. cheese - it settled in clumps around the asparagus. The dish was still very tasty and I'll definately make it again.

This is definitely a keeper! A very easy sidedish to make. I skipped the raw pieces at the end but it was still delicious! I served it with Salmon stuffed with dill couscous.

Beautiful and delicious addition to our Easter brunch. I would make it again but cut down significantly on the oil and perhaps add some roasted pinenuts.

I modified the recipe just a little to suit my taste & domestic situation. Two lbs. of asparagus is outrageous since my husband hates veggies; I cooked about 8 spears, just enough for a side dish for myself. Naturally I used much less butter, I didn't bother with the chopped raw asparagus (too much work for a tired working wife like me), & I omitted the olive oil completely. The results were still fantastic, if I do say so myself! I'm making this again tonight! :)

I made a half of recipe and like the other reviewer, did not bother to tie the asparagus, but used cooking tongs to pull them out of the water. I also used just a little olive oil. The results were delicious and the toughest part is to peel the asparagus. Very tasty dish with no leftovers.

It was easier for me to skip tying the spears and to fish them out with a couple of slotted tools or tongs. Less butter/oil was a good idea that the previous reviews suggested. Yummy!

This is a very good recipe when your asparagus is good. I wouldn't get all excitable about the type of salt you use, but using great olive oil and butter do make a noticeable difference. Ditto parmesan. Enjoy, all. I hope it's a keeper for you, too.

This was very tasty - I used the butter very sparingly and it still turned out great. I didn't bother with the oil either.

I would scale-back on the olive oil. The whole dish was a bit greasy, but very delicious. If you lower the amount of olive oil, I think you'll find it is a great way to eat asparagus.

A refreshing change for serving asparagus! It was a hit at a dinner party last weekend and everyone wanted the recipe. I used regular unsalted land o lakes butter and it was still delicious.
