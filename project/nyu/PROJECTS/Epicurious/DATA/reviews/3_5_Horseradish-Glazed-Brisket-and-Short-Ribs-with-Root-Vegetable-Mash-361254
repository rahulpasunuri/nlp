I substituted beets for half of the potatoes, and the mash was exceptional. Apart from adding to the taste, the beets, of course, made the mash really pretty and autumnal. My brisket was kind of on the small side, so maybe it would be a bit better with a larger cut. It was very tender, and the glaze livened it up well.

delicious! i, too, left out the short ribs otherwise i followed the recipe exactly. it was a moist and juicy brisket with a delicious mash (mine was a bit chunky) i would've preferred a silkier texture to the mash to match with the texture of the meat, i'll use a ricer next time instead of a masher. also i will cook the brisket in a crock pot the next time, it was a bit messy boiling in the pot and it was hard for me to maintain a gentle simmer stovetop. i couldn't get enough of that yummy glaze!! everything looked like the pic except for my gravy, but it would be totally worth it to reduce the pan juices to make a thicker gravy for the mash if that happens to you too. this is a keeper for me.

I made this recipe with 4 pounds of ribs and no brisket since that is what I had in my freezer. I will definitely make the meat part of the recipe again with only brisket since my husband didn't like the fattyness of the ribs. I thought the sauce and ribs were delicious. The combination of mustard and brown sugar diminished the heat of the horseradish making a sweet sauce. Also, when I braised the meat I used 1/4 tsp. ground cloves instead of whole and 1/4 tsp. cardamom instead of pods. I used cheese cloth which helped contain the ingredients I wanted to discard. The mash was good, but I was the only one in my family that liked it, so I won't make it again.

I will absolutely make this again. I took short cuts(celery salt instead of celeric, no cheese cloth just ground both cardamom and cloves and left it in and it made a great flavor in the mashed stuff). The sauce and meats were mouth watering and I wished I had made the full amount, even the leftovers were fantastic.

This was a great recipe...I followed it exactly, but only made a 6lb brisket. I boiled it longer than the recipe called for (and probably over-did it because it was falling apart), but it made for an oh-so-tender (however slightly less pretty) meal. Our friends loved it, and were sneaking bites while I was carving! The mustard/horseradish sauce was a hit, next time I would make more. The mash was probably my favorite part...a nice change to mashed potatoes. I felt they were lighter but tastier.

Very good. Last night was an excellent introduction to brisket, and very happy guests; 14 people at 9 pounds of it gone! I made the brisket only, simply to introduce myself to cooking it. The celery root was a very pleasant surprise - it really made the mash into something super tasty! What I would do next time? I would make sure I skimmed the foam off the surface when it first raised to a simmer. I would also make sure I kept it simmering very gently next time.

I made the recipe exactly as written and my husband and I both loved it. We liked the flavor of the brisket better than the short ribs. I would just cook 2 briskets instead of the short ribs if you needed to feed a larger group.

Very good - I made it with just the short ribs, but I wish I had done just the brisket instead. The brisket would make something nicely slice-able with a good surface-to-volume aspect. The short rib meat contracted to little dark wads (delicious wads though) during the final roasting. I added carrot to the braising liquid as well since I had to use some up. Don't waste your effort on the cheesecloth if you don't have it - just strain the liquid as it goes into the pot with the root vegetables.

We loved this. We had the neighbors for dinner all of us enjoyed the flavors I would not bother with the short ribs next time. They really did not amount too much. Could not find the cerley root so just used the rutabbaga and potato. Even the 2 and 6 year olds had 2nds. I doubled the sauce it would be good on lots of things. Definitley will make again.
