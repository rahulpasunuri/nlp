What an easy and quick recipe. Such a nice change of flavor using the Jerusalem artichokes. The lemon thyme dip complemented nicely both the chips and the rest of our meal. thank you!

I've been looking for a reason to keep growing these tenacious sunflower like tubers. For over 20 years I have been trying different recipes. It looks like the simplest turned out to be the best. They won't be everybody's cup of tea, but I'm sold on this easy as pie method. They bring to mind fried scallops! 5 forks.
