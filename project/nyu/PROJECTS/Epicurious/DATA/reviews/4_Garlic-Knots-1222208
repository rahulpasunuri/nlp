Have not made these yet. Seems easy and delish. Could these be made ahead of time and frozen? Then just reheated? Thinking about making them for my son's first communion.

I think that these were great as an appetizer. I halfed the recipe and they came out great made sure not to over cook and hoped the power wouldn't go out while I was cooking cause of Hurricane Sandy. Everyone loved them but I didn't use all the cheese. I didn't have parsley so I just skipped it i needed more olive oil when I tossed them. Definitely will make these again.

These were good but I thought they were a little too thin and crisp. I like a more chubby, chewy garlic knot. I even took them out after 18 minutes. I'm sure I'll do them again, I'll just cut them in fatter, shorter strips and check them after 15 minutes. I might also take the advice of one reviewer below who suggests adding a little bit more flavor by adding oregano to the mix. Still - you can't really mess these up. And it's true that they go like hot cakes. I made them for a dip-off party and even on a table crammed full of yummy things, this might have been the one thing that was almost all gone by the end of the party.

Super easy and fun to eat. I'd planned to make them for a party, but never got around to it. The oiled dough ended up sitting in a covered bowl on my counter for about 36 hours before I came across it. I'd last looked at it the previous day, right before the party, after it had sat out for the 6 hours recommended on the package. At that point, it looked pretty much the same as when I'd taken it out of the freezer, but at 36 hours, it had doubled in size and was giving off a lovely yeasty smell, so I decided to go ahead and make the knots anyway. The recipe works very well and they were yummy, but I have a few suggestions: add some red pepper flakes and dried oregano to your oil for an added kick, make sure your cheese is very finely ground, and don't try to cut 15 strips out of half of the divided dough -- it'll go much faster and you'll probably have more evenly sized knots if you keep dividing each piece in half until you have 16 strips. There's enough dough for that -- and not just because mine doubled in size! It collapsed again when I removed it from the bowl.

I make these a lot to go with pasta or as a substitute for rolls with dinner. But I use my own pizza dough and increase the amount of garlic. A great recipe that never fails.

The hardest part about this recipe is finding the pizza dough (only one store in the DC area seems to carry it, although one can also buy dough at Bertucci's, if you didn't know that already). I made these for a party and they went like hotcakes.

Very simple recipe and delicious outcome! Only thing I would recommend is airing on the lighter side with the garlic, or separating the garlic mixture into two parts and coating the knots once. Do a taste test than add more if needed!

These are terrific! I had time to make homemade pizza dough, but will probably use frozen dough to save time in the future. Make plenty since there won't be any leftovers.

FanTASTIC recipe. Great for kids big or small. I made it for a birthday party, and I'm not sure who liked them more - the kids or the adults! They're a fun way to get your kids cooking too - it's hands on and messy, just they way they like it!

My son gave me this same recipe and I've made them often. He used to work at Ruby's in Pampano Beach, FL where they made these with a few slight improvements and served them as dinner rolls. After forming the knots, tuck the ends under so they bake evenly and brush rolls with garlic/oil mixture. (In the restaurant they mixed a little pizza sauce into the garlic/oil mixture for added flavor and color.) Allow the dough to rise until double in volume. Brush rolls with garlic/oil mixture again prior to baking. The rolls have a great texture and look beautiful. Immediately after baking, brush again with oil/garlic then roll them in the cheese and serve hot. These are easy and delicious. (Obviously you will need to increase the amount of oil/garlic mixture if you make them this way.)

Big hit with the family. The kids can have a blast making the knots. We used a mortar and pestle to make the garlic oil. That's always fun. Will make for company next time.
