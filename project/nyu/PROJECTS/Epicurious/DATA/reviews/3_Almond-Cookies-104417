So incredibly easy to make my 3 year old could do it. I used pre-ground almonds and a very sweet marmelade and they were delicious. I will definitely make them again!

We used decent-grade marmalade and blanched the almonds before using. No problems with the recipe in general - though the batter IS very sticky. Didn't think the cookies stuck to the parchment paper, but I think if you remove them carefully and quickly onto the racks before they cool completely, there is less sticking. We really liked them - something new for our Christmas table! Our guests agreed.

I halved the recipe and got 27 cookies. Also used a little less sugar. They didn't wow me and my husband thought they were just ok. I think the marmalade I used wasn't the best. Will however try again with another marmalade because it really is a simple and quick recipe. And the cookies did stick after baking but just carefully peeled them off the baking paper like another reviewer did; greasing was not necessary.

These are good cookies, and are very simple to make. I used preground almonds (or almond powder), and so increased the amount by about 1/2c to compensate. I also had no almonds to put on top, but they were still good. The almond - orange flavor works very well. I had no problem removing the cookies from the paper.

Thanks to the tips of others I trimmed back the sticky ingredients and used a buttered pan and the cookies came out just as expected, no problems with stickiness!

It's next to impossible to find parchment paper where I live, so I greased and floured the cookie sheet--no problems, the cookies were perfect and I had no problem with sticking--just had to watch them carefully to avoid the flour scorching. The quality of the marmalade you use is key here. The first time I made these, I used a cheaper marmalade, the second time I got a much nicer marmalade made from sour oranges and the cookies were way better.

The cookies were too sweet! The cookies stuck to the parchment paper making it very difficult for them to stay together in removing. Overall there are so many incredible recipes that I wouldn't spend the time nor money to repeat this one! Oh well, keep trying! :)

These are great cookies. I did not find the fact that the cookies stuck to the parchment a problem - I just pulled them off by hand. It was no big deal. And the combination of citrus with the almonds was wonderful. They looked impressive too. And it's an easy recipe to make. My friends absolutley loved them and asked for the recipe. Thanks for another great recipe!

I took the advices from other viewer, put buttered parchment paper and less orange marmalade.It's still time consuming for me because the cookies still stick on the paper.I think Would make it again only for special occation.It's taste good

I liked this dish because it was very easy and quick to make. The cookies are chewy and enjoyable. However, they did stick to the parchament a lot even when i used a lot of grease. Also, I personally thought that the orange zest+marmalade with the almonds clashed.

Excellent, just the type of cookies I like - Chewy!

The cookies stuck to the parchment paper because of all the marmalade. It was also too sweet. I made a second batch, this time with a little less marmalade and also greased the parchment paper before putting the cookies on and this time, the cookies slid off more easily and it was quite tasty.
