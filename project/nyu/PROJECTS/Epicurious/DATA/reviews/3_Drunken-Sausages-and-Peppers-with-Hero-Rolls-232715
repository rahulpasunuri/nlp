I saute a thickly sliced onion with the peppers and serve with mashed potatoes instead of the roll.

Of course adding to the huge issue of on-campus drinking, which is illegal?

This recipe was surprisingly good. I substituted polish for italian sausage because it's what I had on hand. I had a problem with getting most of the liquid to reduce, and the bell pepper was a little overpowering for my tastes. These definitely need some hearty bread to keep the sandwiches together!

I was initially attracted to this recipe as something my just-learning-to-cook college student could do, and it's still a winner in that regard, but we quickly discovered that this is a stand-out recipe on its own merit -- simple, fast, hearty and mouthwateringly good. I've made this many times now with all sorts of sausages -- Italian (sweet and hot), bratwurst,Polish, you name it, and they're all good. I add in a couple of yellow onions, slivered, when I cook the peppers, stir them about until they're golden, then add the sausages and about 3/4 of a bottle of dark beer. After the first iteration I haven't bothered with the oven -- I just tuck the sausages in amongst the peppers/onions, pour beer over it and simmer, turning the sausages occasionally, until the liquid has reduced. Serve with whole grain mustard on hero rolls. What's not to love?

Best part of this was the half bottle of beer that I drank.
