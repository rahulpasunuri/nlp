Good recipe. One reviewer below says that she used cepes because she couldn't find her porcini. Actually she used the muchroom specified: Cepes are porcini; porcini are cepes--cepes is the French name, porcini the Italian name.

I loved it. You have to like broccoli rabe (rapini) in order to like this dish as the bitterness really permeates the risotto. My family was luke warm about it. I used canned chicken broth and I will make it again

So easy to make and so beautiful in taste. Highly recommended!

I made it a 4 forker using dried cepes (mainly because I couldn't find my porcinis) and about 8oz of fresh shiitakes that I sliced and sauteed in olive oil. Added some good grated gruyere and chiffonade of parsley. Finished with butter and grated parmesano reggiano. Pinot grigio was the wine.

Really nice. I added shredded asiago.

This recipe is one of my all time favorites. I make it every year after Thanksgiving, and look forward to it the rest of the year. I admit it's a bit labor intensive, but it's so wonderful & soothing when you're eating it. Very elegant way to use that turkey carcass!
