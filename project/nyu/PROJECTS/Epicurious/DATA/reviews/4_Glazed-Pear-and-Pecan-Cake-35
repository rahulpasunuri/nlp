What a delicious and FORGIVING recipe! I added the sugar to the dry ingredients by mistake and then almost forgot to add the fresh pear entirely so that did not get properly coated and did sink. But all was well in the end and folks loved it. BTW- I added some crystalized ginger and used 2 cups sugar in the batter and 1 cup in the glaze.

I love pears so I had to try this one. It was wonderful :-) I could not find dried pears or pear nectar, so I used dried apples and apple nectar and it turned out great, although I think I might just use a little more fresh pear in lieu of dried fruit next time. The fresh bosc pear chunks in the cake are so pleasant and delicious! I used 1.5 cups sugar in the cake and 1.5 in the sauce. I only ended up using about 1/3 of the sauce, as the cake was sweet enough. I didn't serve warm sauce with it, just poured the third on top. Unique and yummy!

I used two cups of sugar for the cake and one for the glaze, and those proportions seemed perfect. My modifications were to use crystallized ginger and toasted walnuts instead of the dried pear and pecans. And after pouring the half-cup glaze over the hot cake, I let the remaining glaze boil down a bit into a lovely thick pear-caramel sauce and added a splash of vanilla extract, and I served this sauce with the cake. The results were astonishingly good -- I brought this cake to a potluck and everybody delighted in the combination of flavours and just-right gooeyness. I will definitely be baking this again!!

LOVE this cake! I decided to use only 3 cups of sugar (1 1/2 cups in the cake and glaze respectively) and it was just right. Also, I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used apple cider vinegar, since that was what I had. In addition, I didn't have access to dried pear, so I used crystallized ginger. I also used apricot nectar instead of pear and half and half in lieu of whipping cream. Lastly, I poured all the glaze over the warm cake rather than re- warming half as suggested. The cake was moist and delicious. The only thing I'd do differently is to mix only the crystallized ginger & toasted pecans in the 1/4 cup reserved dry ingredients as adding the pears made a soupy mess and I don't feel that it prevented those ingredients from settling to the bottom as intended.

I am a caterer and always looking for interesting desserts to serve at buffet-style dinners. A year ago I started making this cake with huge success. Here are a few alterations that I perform: I've used apple cider vinegar instead of pear. I have not been able to find dried pears. Instead I used dried pineapple. It's amazing! For the glaze, I use about half of the suggested amounts. If I make two cakes at once, I use one glaze recipe. Not having been able to find pear nectar, I use apricot instead. Also, I use more than 1/4 cup of the glaze (all of it, basically) on the cake, and none on the side. This cake is unbelievably moist and flavorful. People rave and carry on when they eat it. I sure hit every time.

There is an error in recipe. I guessed and use 2 cups for each and it all turned out. If you and your fellow consumers are sauce people , 11/2 the sauce, it is yummy! The cake is super easy. I make it with my 4 year old.

This tasted great, but there appears to be an error in the recipe. The recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar, split between the cake and the glaze. The recipe refers to 2 cups sugar for the cake, and the remaining 2 cups for the glaze. I guessed and used 2 cups for the cake and 1 cup sugar for the glaze. Not sure what's correct. I would appreciate you sending me an e-mail with the correct recipe. You may also want to correct the recipe online. thanks! Rosemary

question: the ingredient list calls for 3 cups of sugar and the batter calls for 2 and so does the glaze--which is right?

Delicious!! But I like the combonation of pears and walnuts better, so I used walnuts instead.
