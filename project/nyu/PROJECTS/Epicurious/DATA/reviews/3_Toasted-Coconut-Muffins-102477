These were a big hit in my family! I have been on a quest to recreate the delicious Harpoon Hanna's muffin I had at their restaurant this summer, and with the following changes, I think I have found it! To produce a more Harpoon Hanna's like muffin, use the recipe changes from the review from 1/04/08 (included here as well), and then make the following changes: use1 package sweetened angel flaked coconut (7 oz.), 1 cup of sugar, 1 can of lite coconut milk, ¼ cup salted butter (melted), 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon of coconut extract. I found it took around 20 min to cook entirely, and the batter requires a little extra flour to thicken it to taste. I also omitted the almonds and orange peel. I hope you enjoy my revisions!

Loved these!!! I omitted the almonds and orange as suggested and used 1 1/2 cups coconut (very important to toast to get the flavour) and used a whole can of coconut milk. I also added chocolate chips, as I do in most of my desserts! :)

I used the 1/04/08 revisions increasing the coconut and coconut milk and they were tasty! I also reserved a handful of the coconut to sprinkle on top with sugar in the raw before baking, giving them a great crunchy texture (just be careful not to let the coconut burn).

I read the reviews and then made the following modifications, and the muffins were spectacular: * omitted almonds and orange peel * used a whole 7-oz package of coconut, pan-toasted until golden brown * used an entire can of coconut milk * doubled the vanilla The complaint was that this recipe, as written, doesn't yield a coconutty enough muffin, but this version produced a wonderful coconut flavor.

I didn't add the orange peel as the idea of coconut and orange sounded repulsive to me. Instead, I added a bunchof dark chocolate. YUM!!!

We made these for Thanksgiving as mini-muffins, using unsweetened coconut, and they were a big hit--nice crunchiness and flavor but not too sweet. Be aware that these are not cake-like muffins, but more of a slightly sweet fruit/nut bread.

These are good, but not WOW! They are pretty substantial (I substituted a 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and used macadamia nuts instead of almonds), though--not a fluffy, dessert-y muffin; more like a meal.

My judgement definitely isn't absolute, because i made quite a few substitutions (a banana for one of the eggs, apple sauce for most of the butter, and i had no almonds so left them out) but all the same, i find that the flavour of coconut milk and even coconut itself get lost in a lot of baking. I'm really digging orange zest in baking though, it adds a lot, and the texture i got was great. just not flavourful enough.

Cookies were well received at work. I especially like the buttery, nutty texture to the finished product. Impossible to burn, too, which is a big plus when you're as bad at cooking as I am!

I agree w/the other folks. The flavor is a little flat, perhaps these could be improved by using some coconut extract. The texture was fine though. Not a big hit.

These were good but not great. I was expecting sweeter coconutty flavor. Texture of the coconut and almonds were very good though.

Both of us love coconut and macadamia nuts, so I looked for a muffin recipe with both. I used this and substituted toasted macadamias for the almonds. It was very nice, and I would make it again.

These were some of the best muffins I've tried. They were moist and flavorful, and the almonds and coconut provided a nice bit of crunch. Quite rich! I think I might try the "lite" coconut milk next time. I had 17 muffins from the recipe, and used a more-or-less standard pan.

I added Malted Milk powder for an extra kick. These freeze well and are a snap to make.

This recipe is simple and can stand a lot of variations. Even leaving out the orange peel and almonds and using unsweetened coconut still produced good results but you need to add more sweetner. Substituting 1/2 c whole wheat flour, and 1/2 cup oat bran and egg beaters also works well. Muffins turn out great every time.

These muffins were very disappointing. The recipe sounds a lot better than it bakes. The muffins were dry and tough, and the flavor was very bland. Definitely will not be making these again.

I thought these were just okay. There are better ways to use my leftover coconut milk!

Really, really good muffins! I made mini muffins out of this recipe (baked @ 14 min.) and they came out great. Will use them for upcoming party and freeze until then. Worth a try!

We Love these muffins! I like to make muffins a lot and have a few that I make regularly and this is one of them. One other person mentioned using lime, I have and it is good. I also always use unsweetened coconut and they come out delicious. I will also add chocolate chips for a special treat which makes them taste like dessert!

I overbaked these a little because I overfilled the muffin cups and they took longer to cook all the way through. However, they were still moist and delicious and were thoroughly enjoyed by the people at the breakfast meeting.

Like most of the cooks I didn't stick to the original exactly. I used unsweetened coconut and toasted it just before adding to the recipe. I didn't bother with any orange peel though I may try lime next time I make them. I substituted dried cranberries for the almonds and doubled the vanilla. I thought they were pretty good overall.

i thought the coconut-almond-orange mix of flavors would be awkward but they actually melded together nicely. i had to add some milk to the batter because it was too thick...they're a little bland but i like them.

I don't know what I was expecting -- perhaps something akin to coconut cake -- and so I was a bit disappointed. My co-workers loved them, but for me they were just okay. I didn't toast the coconut because I thought leaving it as is would make it moister, and I used untoasted walnuts. I did sprinkle the tops with coconut, which made for a prettier presentation, and I lowered the oven to 350, as my other cookbooks suggest in other muffin recipes. The orange zest gave it a nice kick, however, which is needed. Perhaps a sweetened can of coconut, such as Cocoa Lopez, would've been better? I may try again with variations.

These were good, but didn't really satisfy my coconut craving. They weren't sweet and coconutty enough for me. I also substituted sour cream and a little applesauce for the butter, which may have been part of the problem.
