Easy and delicious. I don't have a grill so I cooked everything in the oven and it turned out great. I also used pecorino and it turned out great. Definitely making this again.

these were fantastic! I kept the mayo and pesto separate and guests put together their own burger toppings. These are also great if you add a hamburger patty. yum!!

This is a wonderful recipe. We used homemade pesto (made from baby spinach, garlic scapes, and parmesan) but I'm sure that any good pesto would work well. We assembled it all together using a nice multigrain ciabatta loaf and then sliced it into portions, which I would do again. It means you don't have to search out a certain number of portobellos that are all the perfect size. Leftovers the next day were really great as well!

I have to admit I haven't made this yet but it looks great. I just wondered for those who've made it, do you think making a roasted red pepper pesto instead of the pesto mayo and the peppers would be an okay substitution? I don't want to use mayo and I thought I could just combine the two items (pesto and peppers) into one thing.

Really hits the spot

My husband requested I make this again and I did not have all the exact ingredients, so had to improvise a little. Whipped up a quick parsley pesto (parsley, walnuts, parmigiano, olive oil, garlic) and roasted my last green bell pepper under the broiler as a substitute for the red ones the recipe called for. Served a lemon and pine nut rice on the side. This is a simply amazing sandwich, and a definite favorite at our house!

YUM! This was a delish - and easy to make - meal. After raking leaves all day, it was nice to be able to put something together without too much fuss! My husband loved the combination of ingredients, and said the pesto made the burger! I agree.

Excellent mix of flavors, easy to make, quick to prepare and tastes like a sandwich you only get at a gourmet restaurant. We had it with Kettle BBQ all natural chips for the side - a fantastic dinner.

Absolutely delicious. We made these with sliced eggplant as the recipe suggested and the flavor was outstanding. This will be a regular recipe in our household!

The vegetarian in the family for whose sake this was made rated it highly, describing the flavors as 'perfect' together. This party also rated it as 'perhaps even better than my favorite one from Applebees'.

We were big fans of the Portobello Sliders with Pesto, Provolone, and Roasted Peppers, although we opted not to use provolone. We don't eat much dairy. In any case, the pesto mayo is to die for! We also roasted our own red pepper instead of using the jarred variety. Still delicious! We may make this a staple summer dish!

Huge hit! We made these for a dinner party as a vegetarian option. I followed the directions as written and they turned out great. I've been using the leftover pesto mayo on other items because it's so yummy!

Simple and delicious. I "grilled" the portabellas in the oven by blasting them on high heat and then broiling them on the top rack for the last few minutes. It works great for anyone like me who lacks a real grill.

Made these on a whim for an impromptu dinner with friends. Didn't want to mess with the grill so we broiled the mushrooms (scored the tops of them, hear that helps them cook all the way through?). Also forgot to brush them with oil and season with salt and pepper. But they were still amazing! The pesto w/ mayo combo was perfect (Trader Joe's pesto is my fave). Used what we had on hand, forgot the arugula, used fresh mozzarella. This is seriously a fool proof recipe that stands up well to substitutions and improvisations.

Restaurant grade sandwich, absolutely fabulous! Broiled mushrooms-

So good, so easy. These were such a pleasant little find. We used low- fat mayo with the pesto blend and it worked fine. We made some of the burgers to recipe and some topped with thinly sliced red onion, extra sharp cheddar and romaine and both were out of this world. We used a very thin multi- grain bun. I would avoid a large bun, as I think it would take away from the delicious portobello flavour. We will definitely be making these again.

These were sooooooo good. I broiled the mushrooms instead of grilling them and they turned out great. A definite repeater!

Very, very good. We made this twice in one weekend, it was so delicious. We skipped the mayo because my husband doesn't do dressings, and also used sliced fresh red bell peppers (sauteed on the stove) in place of the jarred ones. SO GOOD.

Absolutely delicious and very easy to prepare! I subbed swiss for the provolone, but it would be great with any cheese.

This recipe was delicious! Everyone loved it, and it was super easy to prepare. If you're looking for a lower calorie alternative, you can use an open face roll and put the mushroom gills down (on top of all the other ingredients) and the top of the portobello acts like a bun, I also left out cheese and it still tasted amazing! Even meat lovers didn't miss the beef.

Made this for my vegetarian husband's birthday BBQ. Enjoyed by all. Really, really good.

Really great. Maybe some caramelized onions next time...

Bangin' good and easy. Make sure you use a good roll. I use a ciabatta roll, and people loved it.

We loved this recipe! I didn't have Ciabatta rolls but whole-grain kaiser rolls worked really well. Fantastic combination of flavors, very easy to do. I'm putting this one in the rotation this summer for sure.

Just made this for the first time tonight. So easy, so delicious. I used the ciabatta rolls and it really hit the perfect note. We will definitely enjoy this recipe again and again and...

This was awesome. Both meat and non meat eaters loved it. Quick and yummy!!

Great. Didn't use pesto and didn't miss it. Also, used 2 mushrooms per sandwich. One was too thin even though large. My husband decided to grill himself a burger just in case. While waiting for it to grill, he ate one of my portobello burgers and LOVED IT. I will definitely make again.

Very good and very easy. I used fresh baby spinach instead of arugula (it was what I had on hand) and was very good. Would definitely make for summer company.

Delicious and simple. What more could you want? This was very satisfying for our vegetarian family. I served it with a french potato salad and watermelon chunks. Great for a summer evening.

I made this twice in the past 3 days! Once for a crowd at a Memorial Day bbq, and once for a friend and me. This is easy, quick and delicious! I used English muffins rather than hamburger rolls and also added caramalized onions as an extra topping.

This was wonderful. My whole family enjoyed it, even my picky three year old. We will definitely be making this again. Such a simple recipe that takes the burger to a whole new level.

This was a good and simple meal. I subbed out mozzarella instead of the provolone but otherwise made the recipe as is.
