This recipe is a keeper! Serve it with French Bread for a surprisingly elegant simple dinner with a wonderful balance of tastes. Perfect cold weather meal for a romantic evening. Note: I personally added more water so that the final dish was more of a broth and skipped the tarragon (didn't need it at all).

So simple and absolutely delicious. I"m not always a fan of fish with a tomato sauce but this really works. The market out of flounder so substituted cod and added a splash of red wine to sauce instead of water.

Delicious, easy and nutritious! In a pinch I substituted caraway seed for the fennel seed and it still turned out remarkably tasty. I added a squeeze of tomato paste at the end and served with warm French bread. Definitely a keeper!

wowowowow!! What a perfect January dish when, if you're like me, you're keen to compensate for Christmas over-indulgence. So delicious and so easy. I made it exactly as directed though I did use homemade pasta sauce (from our home grown organic tomatoes) and I suspect that contributed to the intense and interesting flavour. I served it with brown rice and it was a filling complete meal. Will definitely make again

I still cannot get over how easy and delicious this is. I made this to recipe with the exception of adding 2 cloves of garlic and instead using a 1/2 cup water, I used 1/4 water and 1/4 vermouth. It intensified the flavour. I used Rao's marinara sauce and highly recommend it. A good sauce makes a world of difference in a recipe like this. The flavours really complement the flounder. The tarragon on top is the perfect finishing touch. Easy, delicious and healthy! Perfect.

Such an easy recipe to make, and yields so much flavor. My grocer didn't have flounder, so I substituted with cod. I added just a tish more of the red pepper flakes for a bit of extra heat. Everyone loved it! Definitely a keeper!
