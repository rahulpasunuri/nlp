Made this for Valentines dinner for my lady, it was spectacular. Contrary to other reviews, I think the pasta dough was fine. I couldn't find fresh or frozen artichokes so I used canned- was still great! Also, couldn't find any great looking tomatoes at my budget grocery store, so I bought some canned San Marzanos (more than the recipe called for) and I was glad to have the extra sauce!

I used marinated artichoke hearts as I didn't have any frozen. I grilled some chicken and then sliced it and layered it with the ravioli, pouring the sauce on top of all of it. It was delicious, and easy to make. I can't wait to make it again.

Great reccipe! Followed recipe except for using wonton wrappers...folded in a triangle. Make sure you press out all the air which will keep them from breaking open. Fabulous recipe; making again for next dock party!

Only okay... I used the filling for tortellini. The filling was overpowering, too much onion. If I ever made it again, I would use less artichoke and add some breadcrumbs. Maybe I just don't like artichokes. The rest of my family liked it. Took me forever.

This was delicious. However, the directions call for too much water in the dough and I would not recommend using the smallest setting on your pasta machine, it comes out way too thin. I also added minced garlic and diced baby bellas to the filling. Without the mushrooms, I don't think there would have been enough.

Amazing! I followed the pasta recipe exactly and it turned out pefect. (For those concerned with the pasta consistency, if pasta came out too sticky, there was too much water added and just need to add more flour.) I followed other reviewers and added sundried tomatoes to the filling. I also added mushrooms and garlic and cooked them with the onion. To cut down on the fat, I used fat free evaporated milk in place of the heavy cream, and used low fat butter in place of regular butter. It turned out great. Definitely a lot of work, but I enjoy cooking and really enjoyed the proud outcome of the meal. My husband raved over and over how good it was and that it was a keeper. It was a light meal and we didn't feel overstuffed like we usually do with pasta. Next time I may add meat, a nice sausage or a lean bacon. Either way - it was wonderful!!

Delicious. I cut the nutmeg down to 1/2 teaspoon as to not overpower. Also, I used the pasta dough recipe below since it has been successful for me in the past. 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 tsp. salt 3 large eggs 2 Tbs. olive oil Use an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook to combine the flour and salt. Add eggs, one at a time, and continue to mix. Drizzle in one tablespoon of olive oil. Sprinkle flour on a work surface and knead the dough until elastic and smooth. This will take about 10 minutes. Brush the surface with the remaining olive oil and wrap the dough in plastic wrap; let rest for about 30 minutes to allow the gluten to relax.

This was so delicious... I could not stop eating it! I was afraid that the artichokes would be overpowering but it was a nice balance. Next time I make this, I will double the filling. The quantity in the recipe wasn't near enough for the dough. I used a ravioli mold though.

We made this for a dinner party of 6 people and everyone really liked it. I wouldn't say it is a knockout, but really good. A tad more salt would have helped (and I'm not a heavy salter). Loved the nutmeg. We made our own pasta. All in all, it's a fairly labor intensive dish with not as much bang as you might want.

Delicious filling, but I might 1.5x or double the recipe next time. This was a big hit. We all really enjoyed it. That said... this is a pretty awful dough recipe. Far from being too dry, the dough was so sticky I had to add at least another cup of flour, and the shortage of eggs made it extremely fragile and difficult to work with. I got it to work with the help of an extra set of hands, but I vastly prefer the recipe my pasta roller gives: 3.5 cups flour 4 eggs 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon water Twice the eggs, twice the flour, half the water. A much firmer, more pliable dough.

The filling was a little bland so I added some minced garlic and extra salt. Otherwise it was wonderful. I did go through the effort of making my own pasta which was a pain but paid off in the end. I also assembled the pasta a few days ahead of time and froze them. They still turned out perfectly.

Really good! I used extra artichoke and added some sun-dried tomatoes to the filling, and also fired some panchttea in place of the butter in the "sauce".

Excellent recipe. I served it with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Next time I will make more filling as there was not enought for the amount of pasta.

This was pretty easy to put together. I had never used a pasta machine before and found it addicting. I ended up adding sun dried tomatoes to the sauce and pureed it in a blender, the results were great!

This dish was a huge hit! I bought fresh made pasta sheets and was really impressed by how easy they were to handle. The recipe itself was great..only change I made was to add 4 cloves of chopped garlic to the filling. Yum..I doubled the recipe and it fed 6 of us with no leftovers. My kids were asking when I would make it again.

This was an excellent dish for my new pasta machine I got for Christmas. It got rave reviews from my husband, who kept sneaking into the kitchen for more. I used canned artichokes, and added some Italian spice to the tomato topping. Will definitely make again.

overall, OK. was a little disappointed after all of the effort. didn't think the parm-regg stood up to the strong flavor of artichoke. also thought the sauce wasn't as creamy as the photo implied. lastly, thought the tomatoes needed more flavor, but could just be that time of year. will try again with romano, more cream and a can of san marzano tomatoes.

In the dark depths of my cupboard, sits the past machine I was sure I couldn't live without, and which I can't manage to use. Pasta is baking;I can't bake; the end. A wonderful chef's short cut is to use frozen or fresh won ton skins instead. Just fill, moisten the edges with water and seal. Don't tell any one and they will think you are a genius. That said, delicious recipe.

This was fabulous! Served a party of 8 and it was a hit.. Would not change a thing. We ran out of stuffing though, so I used some mushrooms and goat cheese with pesto for the other ravioli.

Rating: 4
Absolutely wonderful. I will definitely make this again. To make it more easily I just bought wonton wrappers to use as ravioli skins rather than making the pasta from scratch. It cut down on the time required to make this recipe by about 2 hours. I finished the entire thing in a little over an hour.

I usually tweak recipes, but I stayed true to the written recipe this time and it was excellent. An all day project for me, but fun and worth it. It was hard to manually roll the pasta really thin, so my ravioli may have been a little thick. It didn't take away from the taste or texture at all. I doubled the recipe so I could serve 6. We ate our fill and had plenty left over. I also had extra filling. So, I put that inside wonton wrappers, folded in half (triangle), sealed shut with beaten egg white, and baked @ 350 until lightly brown. WONDERFUL APPETIZER idea! They were almost better than the pasta version (except the pasta sauce really makes the ravioli nice and rich). I will definitely be making these again - both ways - depending upon my entertaining needs!

I don't usually write reviews, but this recipe is amazing! I made 3x the filling/sauce and 2x the dough recipe to serve 8 people. I even had enough pasta dough left over to make some pasta noodles for another night. I got rave reviews for days! If you like to make pasta/ravioli these are a must!

I made this for the first time last night and it was FABULOUS! I substituted Half and Half for the heavy cream because its what I had in the house and it was still delicious. I will absolutely make this again it was a HUGE hit!

This combination of flavors is divine. I loved it. I am not rating the pasta part of the recipe since I used pasta sheets from a local pasta shop to make the ravioli, but the filling and assembly recipe is wonderful. The quantities are perfect, so everything can be tasted, but no one ingredient dominates. I like the earlier comment of adding sauteed artichoke halves to the casserole, sort of like in the photo, and will try that next time just for more pzazz!

This was a huge hit - I made it for a group of "foodies" and we all loved it. I added baby artichokes (boiled for 10 mins, cooled and then sliced as thinly as possible to still keep their shape) to the layers before baking - that looked very impressive. This was my first time making ravioli - they expand a TON when you cook them so next time I will try to make them smaller.

YUMMY! This was my first time making ravioli and I was a little nervous, but these were delicious!! I used wonton wrappers rather than making my own dough - purely at a time saver - but other than that, I stuck to the recipe exactly. My supermarket didn't have frozen artichoke hearts, so I used canned and it was fine. I will definitely make this again. The recipe invites "tweaking" - I might add some roasted chicken or sundried tomatoes next time. The only thing I disagree with is that this makes 4 portions - my husband and I gobbled up the whole thing. According to the nutrition info on the wonton wrappers, a serving size is 8 wontons, which is exactly what each of us wound up with.

I made the ravioli with store bought won ton wrappers. Not only is it a HUGE timesaver, but the ravioli came out so light. I made the mistake of adding the chopped tomatoes to the left over artichoke mixture and ran it thru the food processor. Corrected the mistake by chopping an additional tomato and used it to top the casserole dish. Excellent. I have had very good luck using won ton or egg roll wrappers when making pierogi, ravioli, canneloni, etc.

mmmmmm!! so good! i make the fresh past that uses cake flour from somewhere else on epicurious. Could have baked for longer (maybe 5-6 min more). Lovely! Light! Delicious!! Fed it to 4 non-vegetarians and we all loved it, didnt miss the meat :) Added crushed red pepper & garlic. Going to make this again this weekend!

Excellent. Recommend cilantro instead of parsley if you like that flavor. Also, I add red pepper to everything. Finally, I used whole wheat flour instead of regular flour, and it made a more appealing color set I think.

Wonderful recipe! The previous person's comment regarding adding a little crushed red pepper to the sauce was perfect. I also used some durham wheat flour in my pasta dough to make it more authentic. I will certainly make it again; however, I think I will leave out the cream. I just did not see the need for it. It would be lovely with merely a light tomato, lemon and parm cheese sauce.

I roasted the tomatoes to concentrate the flavors. This recipe is sublime!

Does anyone make the recipes as they are written? YES,I am probably the only person on this website to do so. I must say that the result was delicious!Seems this kitchen has too many chefs,tee-hee...

We added cracked black pepper for a little more spice, then topped with crushed red pepper. Great tasting dish, with or without our extra spices. This dish gave us the opportunity to get a new pasta maker and it seems like it'd be fun with kids to make the rolled out sheets of ravioli pasta.

Rating: 4
Yum! Great recipe, althought I did use a different recipe for the pasta dough (I prefer to make mine with Duram Wheat Flour and olive oil for a more authentic Italian taste). I also recommend adding an extra tomato or two and a few more artichoke hearts to have a bit more sauce. Will definitely make this again!

This is deeeeelish! I love artichokes (not to mention, pasta, cheese, and cream!), so I immediately wanted to make this recipe. I was too lazy to make the pasta, so I made the ravioli using store-bought wonton wrappers and this worked just fine. The combination of ingredients is really nice. The final product was better than I expected. The next time that I make this--and trust me, I will!--I will chop up one or two more tomatoes and use a little more cream (just a smidgen for more moisture). Hubby gobbled it up, which is always the sign of a good recipe! Enjoy.
