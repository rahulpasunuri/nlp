ditto on the cheese mistake, certainly 1 lb is a ridiculous amt- just add it til it looks tasty. I wanted to add- that this also works well with beet greens. I used a Italian sausage and have done this w/ chard as well as beet greens and they are both a nice and easy way to add greens into your meat/pasta meal. I have to admit, I did saute some onion with the green stems, I was afraid to leave it out :)

I didn't have all of the sausage and it definitely needed all of it. It was a little bland. 1/2 cup of cheese is 8 ounces so maybe they meant 1/2 pound?

loved this pasta. simple, fast, absolutely delicious. i used low-fat turkey kielbasa, but otherwise made the recipe exactly as written. i usually don't like the bitterness of red chard, but cooking it with salt in the fat and oil from the kielbasa made it really wonderful. couldn't stop eating it!

I cut up the Kielbasa into fairly small pieces and sautéed them in a nonstick skillet. They rendered a good amount of fat, so I did not add the olive oil which would have made the dish greasy. Other than that, I followed the recipe closely. I thought it was really good and am giving it 4 forks because it is quick and easy.

Had to adjust this one a bit to work with what was on hand for a quick supper but I was pleased with the results. Used smokies instead of the kielbasa. They weren't very fatty so basically ended up sauteing the smokies, garlic, chard stems and butter for a few minutes. Then added the leaves to wilt and threw in a few capers. Used whole wheat penne and topped with parmesan. Delicious results in a very short amount of time. The red pepper flakes added the perfect amount of subtle heat.

This was delicious and beautiful- pink pasta! I made as directed except that I added one large spring onion at the very beginning and I used gluten free pasta.

Tasty recipe for a simple weeknight dinner. I used a full pound of kielbasa, browning it as one piece (thinking this might help to keep the flavors in the meat) and then cutting it up.

After googling the ingredients I had on hand, I tried this tonight. It was wonderful. Not too rich, but far from boring or too lean either. I used just one link (all I had) of a spicy chicken sausage. For the much-debated cheese, I went with about 1 cup of finely grated parmigiano reggiano. I was cautious with the red pepper flakes, but you could easily do 3/4 t if you wanted this a bit spicy/arrabiata. :) Thought this was an elegant, simple, healthy meal! (Agree, though, that 1 lb of cheese is both too much and too costly... Possibly a typo.)

Delicious! I used a mix of collard, mustard, turnip greens and spinach ribs removed and turkey kielbasa from Trader Joes. Such a quick, easy and flavorful meal.

Very oily meal that was overpowered by the flavor of kielbasa & cheese (which I used half a cup, not 1 lb). It was still quite tasty becuase, let's face it, kielbasa & cheese are delicious together. I added capers & pepper and substituted chili flakes for fresh chopped Serrano chilis. I'd still probably make it again just becuase it's a good easy standby meal with ingredients that are commonly stocked in my fridge.

This is super easy and tasty. Made with Quaker Creek Store, Warwick NY kielbasa.

this makes for an easy, delicious mid-week meal. i used vegetarian (don't knock it 'til you try it) kielbasa which required a bit more oil to compensate for the lack of fat, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. yum!

Loved this. I cut the chard finely and added wine and tomatoes as suggested. This was wonderful and very easy to make. Good parmigiano-reggiano is a must!

I used turkey kielbasa and toasted pine nuts. Other than that, followed the recipe closely. Excellent dish! My family wanted second helpings.

The kielbasa overwhelmed all the other flavors, so you'd better really like the sausage you're putting into this dish. The boyfriend loves sausage, I prefer kale, so we were split on this dish.

Have made this many times -- I've used swiss chard, kale, and collard greens as the greens. The kale and collard greens require a bit more cooking but are very good as well.

I made some quick changes and therefore do not want to rate this recipe, but rather would like to relay my modifications! This was absoutely delicious and I imagine it would have been even if I had not added my own flair. I used Kale instead of swiss chard and thus added 2/3C water and covered during cooking. I also sprinkled with a touch of balsamic and added golden raisins. I finished the dish with toasted pine nuts and fresh lemon juice. Delicious!

We love chard and this is an excellent way to get those greens! Using a high-quality parmesan really seemed to add great richness of flavor.

This is really good. I had never used swiss chard before, and I really like it after this recipe. I recommend adding a little more chili flakes and add some tomato and lemon to give a little more zing.

Cook from Chicago - if you didn't make the recipe, don't review it. Seriously - you didn't make the recipe in question, you made something else. I'm glad that what you made tasted good, but if you're gonna review a recipe it's not helpful if you've made substantial changes and additions. In any case - made the recipe just now and it was great. I'd highly recommend chopping the chard fairly small, as has been suggested. It's a delicious healthy weeknight meal.

Excellent! So fast, easy and satisfying. It took longer for the pasta water to heat than to get the chard part made!

Made this for friends - they loved it! Nice cause there's not a sauce to make. Followed the review that says to cut the chard stems smaller than the recipe suggests.

I wound up making it with some left over marinara sauce. I just added the sauce over the slightly browned kielbasa, let the chard reduce in the sauce, burned off some of the water, and voila. It was quite nice.

In addition to following the suggestions from other reviewers (used broth to de-glaze the pot, increased the amount of red pepper), I also added 4-5 roasted tomatoes that I had on hand.

Excellent recipe, very tasty. I used ingredients from our farmer's market (exceptions are the olive oil, penne and salt) and the results were delicious. My wife suggested I try some toasted pine nuts in addition the next time.

This was really yummy, I look forward to making it again in the winter, could be real comfort food! I just about tripled the red pepper flakes though. Mmmmmm!

I was skeptical, but this was easy and yummy! I added lightly toasted pine nuts before serving.

i made this last night - it was very good....but i tweaked a little. the only things i did different were: i sauteed keilbasa longer until it was starting to brown and stick to pan creating flavorful bits. i deglazed with 1/3 cup of beef broth before putting in stems. i added some chopped tomatoes with rest of items and then poured the rest of the can (small) of broth in with leaves to simmer. made a nice dunking sauce for garlic bread. both my husband and i really liked it. it was easy and pretty healthy (used turkey kielbasa). will definately make again.
