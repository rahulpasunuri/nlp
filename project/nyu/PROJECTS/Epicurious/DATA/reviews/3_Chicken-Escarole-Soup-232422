I had some chicken breasts and a lovely head of escarole and needed to make something fast and easy. This was perfect. Very clean, simple flavor but tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, just adding one shredded carrot for color and nutrition. The chicken was surprisingly tender. Not everything I make has to be a tour de force. I like healthy comfort food and will definitely add this to my rotation.

Made the recipe essentially as is, added an additional quart of broth, pepper and a handful of rice. It is meant to be simple and clean. It is deliscious as is. For the reader who completely changed the recipe, I think you were looking for a sausage and KALE recipe

Ok, had to doctor this one. Grandma always made escarole soup and I wanted it to taste like hers. So I gave this three forks, since i changed it all over the place. First, I sauteed 3 tsp garlic, minced with the onions and about a pound of turkey sausage( cut into bite sized pieces with kitchen scissors) in olive oil until the sausage was done and slightly browned. Then I threw in the broth. I cut the escarole into ribbons and wash it really well in a collander, drain it well too, then drop it in with a can of white northern beans (or cannelinis) and a can of diced tomatoes (fresh work too). Cook it until the escarole wilts. You will look like you are adding TONS of excarole, but believe me it really cooks down to nothing. Top it with parmasan cheese and you have a great one dish meal.
