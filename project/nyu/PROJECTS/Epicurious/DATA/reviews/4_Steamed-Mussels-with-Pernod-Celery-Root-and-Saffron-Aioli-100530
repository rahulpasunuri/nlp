Okay, a couple of technical things that should be changed with this recipe. 1) put the Pernod or other hard liqueur in the pan with the vegetables and burn off the alcohol by lighting it the same way you would any other hard alcohol. Then add the wine. It was very off putting until the alcohol completely cooked off. 2) you must make the aioli. This recipe needs the creaminess as there really as it it not a very complex flavor and the aioli boosted the broth. I ended up adding and changing too many items with this recipe to list. But the two above are essential to a better flavor.

I Made it exactly as directed and the alcohol taste from the pernod was so over whelming it ruined the dish. I removed the mussels and simmered off the alcohol and then it was better. I had really high hopes for this dish, will probably not make it again.

I'd give this 2 and a half forks. It was good but not delicious. I made it exactly as stated and I was disappointed. I don't think it was worth all that effort - the celery root, celery, leek and carrot made a nice sauce base, but just white wine, some pernod, garlic would have infused the mussels the same way. I rarely serve aioli, but in this case, I felt it made the dish better. However ... all the other recipes from this article in the February 1999 issue of Bon Appetit by Janet Fletcher are superb !!!!!

Excellent - a hit on New Year's Eve. Pernod is a wonderful flavour. Made with celery as didn't have celery root - still lovely. You could add some cream if desired for a creamy pernod sauce.

Best mussels I've ever made. I omitted the Pernod and added baby fennel finely chopped. I made my own aioli. When I make it next, I will add less garlic to the aioli as it isn't cooked and should be less prominent in the overall mix. Loved the way just a touch of real saffron tied all the ingredients together.

I didnt completely follow the recipe but it turned out great. First of all, I skipped the aioli part of the recipe all together. And instead of using the Pernod or anise flavored liquor, I subbed it with white wine. I served the mussel on a bed of linguine&and it was fantastic!!! This is definitely going on my favorites list. It was absolutely delicious!

This was really easy and delicious. I made it for a French themed potluck dinner with friends. Do make set aside some saffron aioli and serve it on the side with pomme frites.

Very easy considering the delicious results. A bit of work chopping but eveyone loves this dish.

I always get rave reviews when I make this dish. It is a staple for Christmas Eve dinner now. Even guests who say they don't like mussels enjoy this recipe.

Fantastic! Tasted even better than mussels from good restaurants. I was amazed that with wine and pernod, it did not taste liquory (the problem I had with other recipes sometimes). Just hint of it. Celery roots gives very delicate flavor. I will make it all winter long!

Best mussel dish ever. Tasted very professional. I followed the recipe except wound up omitting the carrot. No loss!

This is one of the best mussel dishes I have ever made or had! Do not, I repeat, do not give up the celery root for fennel. The Pernod will give it all the licorice flavor that it needs. The celery root adds a unique nutty flavor that complements the Pernod. I did not use the low fat mayonnaise; Hellman's was great!

This dish was just wonderful. I, too, substituted fennel for the celery root. At my husband's suggestion, we also gilded the lily a bit by adding melted butter as a dip in addition to the fabulous aioli. Absolutely decadent! My husband and I enjoyed this as one of our ocassional "couple" nights after the kids are in bed. Very romantic/sensuous late-night supper! Served with a crusty baguette. I halved the recipe but later wished I hadn't. Deeelicious!

Made this for New Year's Eve and thought it was most delish.

This dish is truly sublime. I don't understand why the recipe calls for low-fat mayonnaise, but other than that, it's a work of genius.

Absolutely fabulous. I used celery root and fennel and extra garlic. There were five or six mussels left over and were great the next day in a chilled salad. Will definitely make over and over.

I am a big fan of mussels and eat / cook them a few times a month. This is one of the best recipes I've tried. Definitely replace the celery root with fennel, and if you find nice fennel, use the stalks and greens in place of the celery stalks. The aioli is a really excellent accent to the pernod and fennel, but I regretted using mayonnaise out of a jar. If your not eating it in gobs, you just can't beat home made mayonnaise. This recipe is a perfect opportunity to make your own, as well, since the aioli shouldn't be too thick, so if it turns out a bit runny, who cares (just add a little less of the broth from the mussels). To get on a soapbox for a second, I'd wager real eggs and good olive oil are a hell of a lot better for you than some wierd reduced calorie, calcium disodium EDTA filled, hydrogenated vegetable oil crap. Here's to a healthy amount of really good food, not truckloads of synthetic chemically goop. Cheers, ~ol

I made this dish for my father's birthday and everyone loved it! I had to substitute fennel for the celery root, and Ouzo for the Pernod and used a bit more wine and ouzo than called for in the recipe. Serve this with lots of good quality French Bread and a salad, and don't skip the aioli-it is delicious!

My family raved about this recipe. What makes it so terrific is the pernod/wine combination as well as the aioli. Most other ingredients could have substitutes and the recipe would still be excellent.

Head and shoulders above those the better half and I had in Hindustan. Not quite as good as the mussels in Budapest right before the revolution, I dare say.

I didn't have celery root or leeks. I used a small bulb of fennel and onion in place. It was fantastic -fennel accented the Pernod. To cut prep time throw all veggies in food proc. and pluse until you have a fine mixture

This is delicious. My boyfriend and I loved it and think it's almost as good as the ones we had in Belgium. Next time, we are going to try to put in corn to make it sweeter like the ones we had in Monaco. We also skipped the aioli.

This recipe was delicious. The aoli wasn't all that great but could easily be skipped and the mussels could stand on their own merit.

I am not a mussel lover, I have always looked at them as a cheap excuse for clams. However.... This recipe turned out a bistro quality dish that had everyone in this house from 13- 45 asking for more! Use PEI Farm raised mussels for really stunning results....
