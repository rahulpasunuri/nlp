Perfect texture. I didn't give it a 4 because I used my own pie crust recipe, and I added 1/4 t. almond extract and 1/2 t. cinnamon. I also cut the sugar to 1 c. instead of 1 1/4 c. because the raspberries I had were quite sweet.

I didn't have enough raspberries and used exta apricots from my own tree. This was adequate but nothing special-.

my bofriend loved this. It was super easy. Left on some of the peel to keep pie from turning to mush. Added lemon juice to tarten up ripe apricots. My safeway had a rush on rasperries so the first pie used blueberries. The second pie was apricot only. Serve warm and a la mode

Delicious, but TART!! If your apricots are at all under-ripe then add a bit of extra sugar. I'm a lover of all things tart, but this definitely verged on too tart.

The fruit combination intrigued me, and apricot and raspberry pair very well. I did not make exactly as written though. I had 2.5 lbs apricots and 12 oz raspberries, so that's what I used (I just cut the apricots in thinner slices). I did not increase the quantity of sugar, and used about 3/4 cup loosely packed brown sugar, and the rest regular sugar. To add a little zip, I also added one tablespoon of lemon juice, approximately 1/4 tsp lemon zest, and 1 tbsp brandy. I kept the quantity of cornstarch the same, and baked the same amount of time, using the same temperatures. The result was a pie with a good tart/sweet balance, juicy without being runny. Very good.

This is probably the best dessert have ever made. (Granted, I don't cook a whole lot, but still...) I used fresh apricots from my mom's tree, which I think made a difference. I served it at a dinner party with prosecco and everyone raved! I'll definitely make this one again.

Fruit pies are so easy to prepare in general, but this one is especially easy because of the minimal preparation required for the fruit. Apricots are so freestone the pit rattles inside a ripe fruit! If possible, weigh your fruit, as sizes are relative to variety and growing conditions. I used 27 golf-ball-sized apricots, which is hardly the eight called for in the recipe. The raspberry volume is about a pint. I substituted potato starch for the cornstarch because I find it has a lesser chance of asserting it's own starchy flavor. Also, I added about a half teaspoon of almond extract, which is my favorite addition to raspberries. A very light and easy addition to a summertime get-together. I used the pastry dough suggested, which is basic and easy to work with. If you use a refrigerated pie crust, experiment with some of the store brands, which are often better than the national brands in terms of performance, texture and flavor.

Great pie! It was beautiful, delicious and smelled like heaven. The flavor combo was a nice departure from the usual. I'm glad I served it to my guests with vanilla ice cream because it was ever so slightly too tart (my apricots were so-so)...everyone loved it.

This pie is scrumptious!! I changed one tiny thing though. I brushed an egg white on both the bottom crust and the top layer crust before baking. I didn't use a whole egg as it called for becs. I had made the blackberry/peach pie with it saying to use egg whites and since it came out so nice, I used the same method. Also, I bought the Pillsbury dough pie crust and it was excellent.My guests loved every bite!!!!

Delicious and surprising, a new way to enjoy a favorite summer fruit. Not too tart or too sweet, just a great combination. Leaving the skins on was just fine, kept it from getting mushy. I cooked this a little less than the final 45 minutes, knowing that my oven often runs a little hot. Yummy! A new summer favorite.

excellent pie to make during the fleeting fresh apricot season. Yes, you can make it a day ahead and it is still great. A delicious combination of tart and sweet, with a crunchy sugar-sprinkled top crust. My two daughters, 8 & 11 loved this.

unbelievable pie

This was a very easy pie recipe. I used fresh peaches instead of apricots and it tasted great. Even though I used Pillsbury pie crust, the crust brushed w/egg and sugar was excellent. About half way through the baking I moved the pie to the middle rack and it browned very nicely. No leaking either! My family loved it, especially with vanilla bean ice cream. I will make this pie again. I'll try the apricots next time.

Wonderful! Definitely a "make again" recipe as my family would say.

This is a fantastic recipe and a great way to use a fruit (apricot) that tends to get forgotten during this season of so many choices. I've made it 4 times and each time everyone is so excited by the flavors.

An absolutely lovely pie. I left the skin on the apricots and it worked beautifully; they held together just enough that you could tell they were there. At first it seemed like a lot of sugar to sprinkle on top, but it gave the pie a lovely sweetly crisp crust. This one's definitely entering my repertoire!

This pie is colorful with the unexpected combo of apricots and raspberries. Next time I'll use a deeper dish because the filling overflowed and created quite a mess in my oven. Nonetheless, the family gave it rave reviews at our 4th of July BBQ.

A perfect pie! The crust was one of the best I have ever made and I will use it for all my fruit pies this summer. I have never combined these 2 fruits in a pie but they are a great combination. I had to use frozen raspberries as they are not yet in season but they were just as good as fresh.

This was wonderful. Easy to make and a big hit with my guests. I left the skin on the apricots and that worked out fine.

My teenage daughter made this pie with no trouble at all and it turned out great. The combination of the apricots and the raspberries was terrific, neither too sweet nor too tart. She removed the peel from the apricots, which was not mentioned in the recipe, after we decided that leaving them on would probably produce an inferior result.
