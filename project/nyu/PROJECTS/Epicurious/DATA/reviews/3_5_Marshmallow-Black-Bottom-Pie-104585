This is a labor intensive pie. However, It is worth it. I have made this pie 3 times and it has turned out excellent every time. It is key to beat the egg whites until they are sticking to the bottom of a spoon. This insures that the egg whites are well beaten for the addition of the hot syrup. Otherwise the topping will weep as described by the other reviewer.

Better if you skip the marshmallow topping and just top with fresh whip cream!

This is the second time I have made this pie as I forgot how the topping had weeped at my first attempt causing the crust to be soggy around the rim. No other review mentioned this happening so am wondering what caused this to happen?

Was this pie a little extra work? Yes. Was it worth it? Yes. Tastes like a giant Mallowmar. Yum!

This is my family's favorite pie. With the marshmallow topping, it's jaw-dropping. But, we also do it topped with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Or I learned this quick trick from my husband's grandmother. Top the pie with miniature marshmallows, then pop it under the broiler until lightly browned. They melt into a luscious filling.

A *10* star pie. I use this one for private entertaining and catering. It's worth every minute of effort. Suggestion: For recipes that take m0ore effort than usual, use the highest quality ingredients possible. The increase in cost should be no more than 15%, however, the results for effort are exponentially increased. *clinking of glasses*--- Bon Appetit!

This pie was to die for. I took to a function and not one piece was left. This is the perfect chocolate filling very rich. I made it for a 10-inch pie plate so I doubled the filling called for it came out very thick and it was such a hit I will continue to double the filling the next time I make

I have made this pie several times and it is worth the effort. Don't let all the steps intimidate. Sometimes I make the crust & filling day before and then whip up the marshmellow topping the day of the party. Absolutely delicious! Stick to the original recipe and you can't go wrong. I'm still living in the dark ages without a food processor, but an "old fashioned" pastry cutter worked just fine for the crust. (Filling also makes a quick, delicious chocolate pudding when you have the craving. And pay attention when whipping the filling/pudding to avoid lumps. As soon as it gets warm enough, the mixture thickens very quickly. )

Yum! We enjoyed all components of this - the crust was easy to work with & tasty, the chocolate filling was also easy & delicious, & I actually enjoy making homemade marshmallow (I have a stand mixer, though). The sweet marshmallow topping contrasts nicely with the dark, rich chocolate filling, & the flaky crust is a nice complement to both.

this is a great recipe, but the marshmallow is a little to sweet even for the kids. I just skip the whole topping and put fresh whip cream on the top...........yum yum much better

Impressive presentation, it's one of those recipes that turns out exactly as it looks on the picture. It IS very time consuming and messy... beating marshmallow for 12+ minutes is not fun. Cleaning up afterward can be even more of a nightmare. I would make this to absolutely impress someone, but that kind of effort could also be used towards any of the other much simpler recipes. I liked the filling consistency, but if you do not then I suggest checking out either of the other good chocolate pie recipes on epicurious. The only unique thing about this is the marshmallow, you could add that to just about any dessert that requires a sweet fluffy topping so don't feel locked into this recipe. I used a normal wafer crust instead of the pie crust. Pie crusts are so time consuming, and this recipe is already labor-intensive as is. If you do want to make the actual crust, be sure the fats really *are* chilled and cut up small.

pie was ok. the filling was delicious but i felt that the topping was really too heavy and dominant and destroyed the lovely chocolate flavor of the filling. i will not make again.

I love this pie. Made it for a party and the adults and kids all loved it. The crust was great also and did not become soggy the following day.

This is the chocolate pie I've been looking for. I've tried several different recipes, and this is the best so far. The merinque whips and browns perfectly (but don't take your eye off the oven while it's browning), and the chocolate cream filling is delicious -- more chocolate taste than other pies I've tried.

The pie crust was easy and outstanding. I doubled the recipe, so I could do decoratave things to the crust. It was beautiful. As for the pie as a whole, my family and I were disappointed. The work it took to make the filling and topping (I substituted meringue for the marshmallow)the result was less than outstanding. Next time, I will stick with the lemon meringue pie, which is as good as it was cracked up to be.

For the record, I made this without a stand mixer, and it came out great... I did use a graham cracker crust (I don't do pie crust), so I made everything else at 3/4 recipe and it came out great.

The crust and topping portion of this recipe is excellent but I didn't care to much for the filling. I would have preferred more of a chocolate velvet or mousse type texture for the filling.

This recipe was tasty, but maybe next time I would try a meringue top as others recommended. Overall it wasn't difficult to make, but time consuming. When making the marshmallow layer, be sure to add the hot sugar syrup VERY slowly as my whites seemed to coagulate slightly. It was somewhat lumpy initially, but seemed fine when chilled and served. I thought the marshmallow layer was good, but not WOW for the effort. If you don't own a stand mixer, this recipe would prove very difficult, as the top layer requires extensive egg white beating and hands free to make additions. The crust behaved like a dream and was tasty. I'd think this pie would be smore-like with a graham cracker crust. The chocolate layer was the best part, reminiscent of a very rich, sinful pudding. Served the pie at a potluck and was enjoyed by all. Do garnish with the chocolate curls, makes it look tres elegant and impressive!

Thought this was a great chocolate fix! Have done it several times over the last year. I felt that the marshmallow topping was over the top and to rich so now I just top with whip cream - makes the chocolate filling taste even better! Thumbs up on this one!

This did take quite a while to make, but was worth it. Timing is everything when making the marshmallow topping, a stand mixer is essential.

While this pie is a bit labor intensive, it is incredible! My husband took half of the pie to work & it was gone in less than a half hour. My husband came home with raving reviews. I did use semisweet chips instead of chopping to save time.

I haven't made the pie yet. But I will on Saturday because I just bought an 8foot by 4 foot painting of this piece of pie.!!! It's over the top! and it's hanging in our dining room.

OUTSTANDING! It's worth the effort. I will definitely make this again.

I rate this a 4 forks using a meringue topping inplace of the marshmallow topping. I thought the marshmallow topping over powered the deliciou filling.

I made this pie for a dinner party. It looked like the picture on the cover, and tasted wonderful. The recipe is already in my recipe box. A keeper.

This pie was absolutely wonderful. The marshmallow topping turned out high and fluffy just as the picture showed, and the taste was even better. Everyone in my family loved it and I would definitely make it again.

Although involved and rather time consuming, I had no difficulty making this recipe ...It looked and tasted spectacular! All 8 of us enjoyed this pie and consider it a keeper...keeping in mind that it is incredibly rich and you MUST be a real chocolate lover. Since it is so rich it could really serve more than the 8 people as the recipe states.

I'm not sure why the other reviewers had problems with the recipe, but mine turned out wonderful. I've never attempted anything like the topping, but it was thick and delicious. It was time consuming, but it was mostly spent standing over a mixer. My husband's grandmother made a similar pie every year for his birthday, and I've attempted to find this recipe forever. He says this one is even better than he remembers. I can't say enough about this recipe.

I really liked this pie but had a little problem with the marshmallow top in as it did not have the volume shown in the picture

This pie was so much work it took two of us to get it together. The children did not like it and the adults said it was okay (probably realizing how much work my daughter and I put into it). The next day, the left over pie was a pile of mush. We were both very disappointed in everything about this recipe. Was it tested? It is the first recipe we really thought was wrong or out of place in your wonderful magazine.

Although I am not a chocolate fan, the filling in this pie was incredible. I don't mind putting the extra effort into a great dessert, but I don't feel the topping was worth it. I will make this again using a simple meringue topping instead. Or maybe some whipped cream.
