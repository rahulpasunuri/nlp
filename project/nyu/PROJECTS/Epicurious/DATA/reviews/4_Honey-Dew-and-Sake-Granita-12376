Made this for my cookbook club for the theme "anything with alcohol." It was practically effortless to make. The granita was zippy, light and refreshing -- the perfect palate cleanser. I skipped the ginger/plumwine granita and instead dressed the honeydew-sake with thin slices of candied ginger and a mint leaf. It was a hit! This will definitely be part of my summer repertoire from now on.

We ended up drinking them instead! Added some Vokda and soda to the blender to loosen them up. They started off our Asian night party perfect.
