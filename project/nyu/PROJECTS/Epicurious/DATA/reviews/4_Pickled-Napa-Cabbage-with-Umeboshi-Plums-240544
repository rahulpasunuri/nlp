This gets better with time. The first couple of days, it's a little sweet for my taste, but after a week it has good pickle flavor. I might up the umeboshi content a bit next time, as well as add in some shredded shiso leaves.

I made this with bok choi instead of Napa cabbage, and it was absolutely delicious. You need to like the sour, salty taste of umeboshi, but if you're a fan, this recipe is a winner!
