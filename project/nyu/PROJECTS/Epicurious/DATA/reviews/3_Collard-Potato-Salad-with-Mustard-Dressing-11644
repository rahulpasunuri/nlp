I didn't realize until I got home that I didn't get scallions. I used 2 small sauteed yellow onions instead, which were really good. It was a huge hit at the barbeque I took it to, especially among the men. I'd be happy to use frozen collards or kale next time. Agree with others not to skimp on the salt and peper.

pretty good. we ate it as a main course, but it'd be great with fried chicken. i used kale, not that it changes much. i'd be more aggressive on the salt and vinegar...

I made a couple of changes and thought this was fantastic! Used red russian kale instead of collards 'cause that's what we had in the garden. The bitterness of the kale goes nicely with the sweet of the potatoes (oh yeah, I used sweet potatoes). I also added 1 T of honey to sweeten the dressing a bit - I thought it was too tangy as written. Colorful and delicious :-)

Very tasty and easy to make. Nice change from a mayo based salad.

I think there is too much oil in the dressing, but otherwise it's pretty good.

Like another review I read, I received some collards in my co-op, and needed to find a bearable collard recipe. This is more the bearable, my wife possitively enjoyed it. Would certainly make it again.

This was okay, but not great. The only thing I changed was to substitute sauteed white onions for the scallions. If you need a side dish salad, this will do.

This is really delicious -- I wasn't sure what to do with the collard greens I recieved in my co-op order, and this was dead on. I used organic fingerling potatoes. I also would chop the collards before i boiled them next time. It's also good not to make the bacon too crispy. I might also use slab bacon cut into chunks... all in all, this is definitely worth a try.

Easy, intensely flavored, earthy dish. I'm making it again tonight.
