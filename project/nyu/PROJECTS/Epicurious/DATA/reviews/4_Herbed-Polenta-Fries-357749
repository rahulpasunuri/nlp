The polenta doesn't harden for me either. No idea what I'm doing wrong. Not hot enough oven? Keep it in longer?

The polenta doesn't harden for me after my second attempt at making this. What am I doing wrong?

The fries were great - I added a bit more herbs and sea salt right before broiling. I served them as a side dish to duck with candied kumquats from this site. I'd say it the recipe serves 4, not 6 as a side dish. Will be making again!

These are very good. I added a little more herbs and before broiling, a touch of sea salt. Everyone liked it even my hubby who is somewhat picky. I served it as a side it to duck with candied kumquats from this site. Yum! Will be making again!

Every time I serve these polenta fries at a dinner party, it's a BIG HIT! Everyone want the recipe. I add a touch more rosemary than what it calls for.

This is good! I was happy I cut back on the amount of salt in the polenta but should have sprinkled the "fries" with coarse salt after broiling.

These were very fun, and like the previous reviewer, I'd cut back on the salt next time. I made them exactly as the recipe described with the addition of turning over per the suggestion of the first reviewer. In fact, I turned one more time to give the sides a few minutes to brown up. I love herbs, but I thought the amount of herbs here was just a tad much- next time I'll cut back a bit to let more of the corn meal taste come through.

These are simply delicious and the contrast in taste/texture of the crunchy coating with the creamy, cheesey inside is wonderful. I'll be making these all winter! The fresh herbs are essential. These were great paired with a piping hot bowl of roasted tomato soup. I'm imagining these fries paired with a tomato-porcini sauce (see recipe on epicurious) "catsup" and serving as an appetizer....or cutting the fries into cubes and using as croutons on garden salad. Ah, the possibilities are endless! The next go-round I will reduce the salt to 1/2 or 1/3 tsp, as the parmesan adds plenty of saltiness. Also, I'll turn the fries once after 15-20 minutes and give the bottom a quick "fry" for another 5-10 minutes.
