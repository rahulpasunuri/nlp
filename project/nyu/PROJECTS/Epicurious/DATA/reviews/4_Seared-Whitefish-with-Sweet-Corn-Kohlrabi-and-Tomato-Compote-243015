This recipe was great! Not sure what the cobs were supposed to be used for... I almost threw them in the water with the kohlrabi but then got lazy and just composted them. We used tilapia instead of whitefish bc it was $4 frozen at whole foods (?!!) and sauteed the kohlrabi greens for the side. The tomato compote came out perfectly sweet and the kohlrabi balanced the sweetness nicely. We also put some chopped chives on top for extra flavor and used lemon-infused olive oil instead of the grapeseed oil. Will definitely make again!

Like many of the others I was was looking for a use for the beautiful purple kohlrabi in my CSA this week. No whitefish at the market, so substituted Hake with great success. It just seemed to sad to peel away the beautiful purple!!! Also what were the cobs to be reserved for??? Anyway we loved the combo of the compote, veggies and fish, it was worth the 4 pans required to make the meal!!

totally yummy. I had to use cod but otherwise made exactly as written to delicious results. Now I look forward to extra kohlrabi in the csa shipment as I know just what to do with it (and the recipe is quick and easy besides)Make sure you season the fish 'generously' as described. But really, it's all about the tomato compote...

I agree with previous reviewers that this is restaurant quality. I received kohlrabi in my CSA box and had no idea how to serve it. The flavors were phenomenal. I will definitely be making this again.

I was quite excited to try this recipe after reading the reviews. We had some kohlrabi in the garden that was begging to be used and this being tomato season, we had everything we needed (but the fish). I used halibut as suggested in the recipe as an alternative to white fish, otherwise, I changed nothing and followed the recipe exactly. While I found the compote to be tasty, I found the composed dish itself to be rather bland and boring. It was easy to make so props for that, but otherwise, not sure what all the raves were about.

This was a restaurant presentation and quality meal. I made some substitutions - used a salmon fillet, canned plum tomatoes instead of fresh, used frozen corn, and used garlic, garlic scapes, and onions instead of shallots, and cut the recipe in half. It was really tasty and the leftovers were good too.

Delicious, easy and very tasty! This is a recipe that would get rave reviews from company because it seems so 'restauranty'! I used flounder- it was what was fresh at the store today- be sure to salt and pepper liberally at each step- YUM!!
