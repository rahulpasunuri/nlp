I made the soup as written, my only substitution was to serve it with goat milk yoghurt instead of sour cream. I thought it was a little too sweet, I imagine it depends on the watermelon and personal taste. I'd start with less sugar and then adjust. It wasn't too spicy, again the heat of the cayenne you use and personal taste should determine how much you add. Overall, the soup was a hit and friends asked for the recipe. I made it on a Saturday and surprisingly, it was still good the following Thursday.

This soup is a hit everytime I serve it. I recently bought a power juicer that significantly reduces the effort to make this soup. One of my favorite variations is to use yellow-flesh watermelon for the liquid and red chunks for the meat. As other reviewers have noted, take it easy with the cayenne. I recommend cutting the amount to less than half what the recipe calls for unless you really like spicy foods.

This is a great soup. Even my boyfriend who was doubtful really enjoyed it. I wouldn't change a thing! I took some advice and used yogurt instead of creme fraiche and didn't like that substitution. Also, strain out the solids as much as possible - it makes the soup lighter and better for summer.

Good, if not spectacular. I started with a very sweet watermelon, so if I were doing it again I'd skip adding the sugar to the wine (especially since I used a sweet muscat.) As another reviewer mentioned, it's a lovely color.

I served this at a dinner party to friends who have very cultivated palates. Everyone loved it! I followed the recipe exactly (except forgot to add the reserved one cup of puree at the finish). While making it, I was hesitant about adding the cayenne to something that tasted so good already, but the cayenne just heightened the taste of the mint. We served the soup as a first course to a Thai-style meal and it was perfect! A bonus is that it's very low in calories!

This tasted TERRIBLE! I made it ahead and tasted it the next day early. I gave my guests a small espresso cup of this soup between courses so they could give me their opinions. Most thought it was OK but nothing special. I dumped the rest down the drain. Luckily I had time to make a cold avacado soup from this web site and it was delicious.

I made this for a dinner party and all of the soup dishes were returned to the kitchen empty! (Always a good sign). I made a test batch several days before and probably added too much cayenne because it had somewhat of an afterbite...so I dropped the cayenne from the ingredients and it was still wonderful. I used yogurt instead of sour cream. Great!

Would absolutely make this soup again. It was refreshing, the colour was good. Was a hit with my guests.

A really excellent hot weather soup. A fair amount of work but it yields lots of soup. We would suggest adding additional chunks of watermellon at the time of serving.
