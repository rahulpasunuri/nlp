I've made this several times now and it is always a hit. Tonight I made it using a small pork loin instead of chops. Seared off the loin and finished it in the oven at 375. I typically use about half of the recommended onion and at least double the apples. It also usually takes longer than the noted 5 minutes to thicken the sauce (more like 8-10, at least). I sliced up the pork loin, topped with the apple mixture and served with israeli couscous with cranberries and a side of broccoli. Definitely something I will make again and again. Even my 2.5 year old will eat it!

Wonderful, perfect for late fall, when you're pining for something warm and substantial. I, too, used the Berlin method (increased spice amounts, etc.) and have to say it can take even longer than 20 minutes to get really thick chops roasted enough. I served with an herbed stuffing and a green salad, and a nice cold dry Riesling -- awesome! Next time think I will try adding chops back into apple-onion mix for final bit of cooking before serving. Regardless, will definitely make again!

delicious. modified the recipe slightly - used almost double the ingredients in the apple curry in order to make more, almost triple the apples (2.5 large granny smiths), and double the marjoram and thyme. seared the chops and then baked in a covered pan for 20 minutes at 425. sauteed onions until soft and tan, then added apples and garlic and continued to saute until soft - not mushy. set aside and added curry ingredients, cooked until nice and thick, then added apples/onions/garlic back in to rewarm. added a tsp. of cinnamon at the end. I also used phukit green curry powder, a slightly fruity, moderately hot curry powder, which complemented the apples nicely. The chops were extremely juicy and well seasoned and we are already dreaming of other uses for this incredible curry.

I've made this three times and the first time it was incredible-- moist and tasty! The next times it was just ok. I don't know if it was the meat itself or something I missed in preparation... When it turns out well it's fabulous!

My husband made this and I thought it tasted great. The sauce was a little thin so perhaps it didn't reduce enough, and it is not an attractive- looking sauce, but very savory. I ate what was left of the sauce with a spoon after dinner. Yum.

Wow. This one's a keeper! Followed the Berlin method and also added the juices from the broil pan into the curry. Served with asparagus and basmati rice.

I didn't measure much and relied on a few reviews to adjust. I browned the chops and then slow cooked them in the sauce to ramp up the flavor and get the apples soft. YUM!

I really enjoy this recipe and make it often in the fall. I have modified cooking times as needed. enjoyable flavors and the sauce is a great compliment to pork.

Super recipe - my husband said "best pork chops he's ever eaten". I used spicy brown mustardand two apples and it was simply great. I would definitey make it again.

It was pretty tasty, but the effort required made it less likely that I'll make it again. The sauce needs more flavour - I added some extra onion and garlic, but the pork chops turned out very nicely.

Two-and-a-half-forks! Quick meal but lacked the luster I expected with the ingredients involved. I would have to fiddle with the recipie to make it again.

My Irish fiance and I both love pork chops, but found the sauce to be rather bland. In addition, I found the cooking times to be inconsistent with my actual experience. If I had the time and inclination, I might try this again with some of the adjustments recommended in other reviews -- but with so many truly outstanding recipes out there, I doubt I will want to put any more effort into this one that just didn't quite satisfy.

Simple and delicious. Easy to make. Wonderful with oven baked potatoes and green salad. And a glass of good red wine... I would make the sauce in a different way though. Apples, onions and garlic need more cooking, perhaps, on a lower heat.

Excellent combination of flavors. With my improvements, I would give it 4 forks! I increased the herbs to 1 1/2 tsp each. Method also needs improvement. I browned the chops quickly on both sides and finished them by placing them in a oven-proof saute pan and roasted them in the oven for about 20 minutes at 375-400 degrees while I made the sauce. For the sauce I sauteed the onions in the drippings first till they softened and developed color, then added the garlic, sauteeing gently till softened, then added the apples (I used tart, baking style apples that would retain their shape). Cooked the apples till they began to soften. Removed the apple mixture and set aside. Deglazed the pan with the wine, stirred in the broth, cooked until reduced by half. Then stirred in the cream, mustard, curry powder, herbs, fresh ground salt & pepper to taste. Boiled until slightly thickened. Stirred in apple mixture to briefly re-warm. Then serve.

This dish was so delicious, especially the sauce. The only thing that didn't work out was that the apple-onion mixture took longer to cook through and reduce than the recipe said it would. I would, next time, rub more thyme and marjoram into the pork. I served this with the pistachio and raisin pilaf on epicurious.com. A great combo!

This was a delightfully unique way to serve regular old pork chops. As the other reviewer noted, it would be best to carmelize the onions first (which I did not) to give it a richer flavor. I used a regular apple and a granny smith probably would be better. But, I followed the directions exactly and it was still very good. I will make this again. Oh, I did use dried basil instead of marjoram since I did not have that spice on hand.

Simply fantastic!!! The sauce is to die for! After reading the reviews and the cooking method, I made a few changes: used 1.5 Walla Walla onions and carmelized until deep golden brown; then added 2 coarsely diced Granny Smith apples and the garlic and continued to saute to a deep rich brown; deglazed the pan with the wine; added the chicken broth and simmered until reduced by half; stirred in honey dijon, the herbs, curry powder, salt/pepper and the cream and continued to simmer for a few minutes until reduced and nicely thickened. The resulting marmalade-like sauce had a luscious colour. Made the day before so the flavours could marry/deepen, then reheated. This sauce was a real taste treat that beautifully complemented a centre-cut, Frenched, pork rack, slowly cooked on the gas barbecue rotisserie and then sliced into chops. This is a yummy dish that is company worthy, yet so easy to prepare. I think the key to the sauce is to brown the onions/apples thoroughly, rather than following the recipe directions which I feel would result in a very insipid flavour and an anemic colour. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed!

My husband & I agree with the reviewers that thought this dish tasted weird. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't great. I wish I had sauted the onions & garlic THEN added the apples, I think mellowing out the onion flavor would have helped a lot.

Used more curry powder & garlic. Used red instead of white wine. Milk instead of cream. Such a great tasting suce, but recipe didn't provide enough. Served it w/horseradish mashed potatoes.

I made this recipe last night. Even my picky 13 year-old daughter liked it - and she HATES onions. The only alteration I made was using red wine instead of white (had a bottle open - why open a new bottle?) I served it with mashed potatoes and the sauce on the potatoes was delicious. It was reminiscent of the gravy served on the meatloaf at Spago's, which is one of my very favorite dishes. Haven't found that recipe, but this sauce came close. I've been using Epicurous recipes for over a year now, and this is the first recipe that I've felt moved to comment on. Try it, you'll like it!

Wonderful dish. Boyfriend loved it! The sauce was wonderful and very easy to make.

Easy, relatively quick and delicious. FWIW, I subbed half and half for whipping cream and it turned out fine. I served it with cumin glazed carrots (also from this site) plus my own thyme roasted potatoes and I wouldn't hesitate to make it again. Paired with a 99 Chalone Chardonnay, it was a big hit.

Great recipe, had to make a couple changes to accomodate being too lazy/broke to go to the store. Used a full cup white wine (had no chicken broth), milk instead of cream, and regular old yellow mustard with a couple glugs of honey. I am only a baby cook, but I planted an herb garden a few weeks ago so I was able to use fresh herbs in this recipe--which was good, because I didn't have any dried thyme or marjoram. They make a big difference, don't they? I will always have an herb box from now on!

I followed this recipe exactly as outlined. I made this because my husband loves curry. The blend of spices was superb. This is definitely a repeat recipe. So easy to make!

I made this without the white wine and I made the Rice Pilaf with Peas and Pine nuts to go with it. It was good and I would definately make this again.

Delicious and easy to make. My husband doesn't like curry (or so he thinks) and he thought this was a tasty dish. I didn't want to open a can of chicken broth, so I just used a bit more white wine and it still tasted great. Definitely will make this again.

This was an easy crowd pleaser. I added more thyme and margoram to the initial chops, a tad more curry to the sauce, and substituted milk for the whipped cream. The sauce thickened perfectly and the meal tasted divine!!!! I served it with the squash -rings with honey-soy glaze (ba - oct'99).

Very good. Paired well w/ Epicurious' Red Lentil Dal which was out of this world good. I made no adjustments and it was just right. A good, mild curry dish.

As I'm not a big pork chop fan, but I fixed it for my husband - he LOVED it! I used the suggestions from another cook and used applesauce with cinnamon, and put it in the oven in a casserole dish - great taste, easy to prepare - there you have it! I think I will also kick up the honey mustard to 3 tbsp and curry to 2 tsp for even more taste!

Most tasty and easy to make. I enjoyed the cuuried-apple mix. I had some of the sauce leftover and served it over sautéd chicken breast. It was just as good. No suggestions to make. I would certaily serve it again.

Would definitely make this one again. It took a little long to reduce the sauce to a thick consistency, so I added a flour slurry. The flavors were very good together, and am looking forward to making it again.

Good,easy, and relatively quick weeknight recipe. I boiled the sauce down and then pureed it. I served it with the Gourmet 4/99 recipe Apple & Celery Salad and garlic mashed potatoes. I substituted evaporated skim milk for the cream so it was a pretty health meal.

I absolutely loved this recipe. Very tasty, although I did reduce the sauce down to a very thick consistency. I didn't add that much mustard, either. A definate keeper.

Even my son who doesn't like pork loved this recipe. Okay, I admit that I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used 3/4 cup applesauce instead of apples, added salt and pepper, and didn't use the first two spices (because I forgot to pick them up at the store). I put everything together in a covered casserole and baked for one hour at 375. It was DELICIOUS - flavourful and tender. If you like all sorts of flavours mixed together (as in Chinese food compared to Japanese), then you may like this recipe a lot.

I would give this recipe less than one fork. It was a big disappointment. To me there were too many strong flavors competing rather than complimenting each other (curry, garlic AND mustard?)
