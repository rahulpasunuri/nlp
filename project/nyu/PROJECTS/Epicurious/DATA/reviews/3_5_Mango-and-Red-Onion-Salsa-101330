My husband just bought swordfish to grill and I'm printing out my old favorite salsa recipe. I've made it many, many times. It's always delightful.

I have been making a similar recipe for quite some time now (I got it from a friend who made it for dinner one night). The only difference is that I add one or possibly 2 diced avocados--0bviously depending on how many you are serving. I could not tell you exactly how much of the ingredients I use, since I go by taste, but usually for 2 people with some left over: 1 avacado, 1 mango, 1/2 c. of red onion, 1/4 c. cilantro, splash of lime, drizzle of olive oil, dash of cayenne and salt and pepper to taste. This is FABULOUS on pan fried or grilled halibut that has been seasoned with a nice spicy rub- like for fish tacos. (I have also used my George Foreman grill to do the halibut and it has turned our great!) When, and if, there is any left over from my husband and I, it is wonderful to eat with a spoon!

to all of the nay- sayers..... this is definitely my favorite mango salsa recipe -- I get asked for the recipe time and time again, but here is what you must do (aka, tweak the recipe....) First, use 2 LARGE mangoes - make sure they are firm, yet sweet, juicy, and bright orange! Next, I add the juice of 1-2 limes, depending on the size of the limes, usually erring on the side of more juice!!!! next, pile the ginger on baby! a tsp? really.... and according to your taste, add a bit more cayenne (good amount of kick...) And last but not least..... to bind all of these wonderful flavors.... drizzle a bit of olive oil over the entire deal... just a drizzle -- it really does help combine the flavors.... Recently served w/ glazed salmon -- and it was superb! Trust me! Practically my number one requested recipe this time of year.... and I cook a lot! Have fun....

I added a bit more ginger and if I make this again I would not use as much cilantro. I think cilantro is an aquired taste. We found this recipe and made it this evening for my daughters Australia country report presentation she was doing for school. We purchased baguette chips to server the salsa with.

More appropriately named red onion with mango salsa; the red onion was overpowering; I made it as directed, found the onion taste overwhelming, added more mango, still way too much raw onion taste for me. I used a small amount on my salmon, then threw the whole bowl away. My husband did not care for it either. If you like the taste of raw onion, this might work, but for me it was an unfortunate experiment, not to be repeated.

Excellent mangao salsa. Used 2 1/2 cups fresh mango to balance the amount of red onion. Served with fresh tuna skewers. Fish caught by my 14 year old grand daughter.

Great with fish tacos. When on the mainland I use the jarred mango found on the shelf in the produce section, which makes this easy to make.

Quite good. I used Trader Joe's frozen mango chunks instead of fresh mangos. I'm sure that fresh would make this much better but it was still very delicious. I often find raw red onions overpowering but the onions were offset by the sweetness of the mangos.

I've made many mango salsas and this is my absolute favorite! The ginger gives it a wonderful zing. Excellent with grilled fish and chicken.

I made this for a dinner party, served it as a garnish for cold salmon. There wasn't one speck left on the serving dish or on the dinner plates. This is definitely a keeper - easy, too!

When an extremely picky 12 year old asks me to make this again, you know it's a winner!

I don't give many four forks, but this salsa was INCREDIBLE! Tastes exactly like a wonderful salsa we used to get at a little restaurant in Mexico City. Served with fish tacos for casual get together and guests raved. Will be making this again for sure.

EXCELLENT salsa! I left out the onions at my husband's request, and it was still luscious, especially with the Poached Chicken Breasts with Curried Yogurt Sauce recipe. I'll make this again and again.

I love this recipe but prefer it even simpler. I leave out the lime peel, ginger, and cayenne pepper and add in one small diced jalapeno for kick and it makes a wonderful flavor combination. Its great as a salsa or also works sell with roast pork.

I loved this recipe and so did my guests. I wanted to serve it as dip with tortilla chips so I added two plum tomatoes diced and briefly pureed in blender.

Absolutly gorgeus! Serve it with grilled Mahi-Mahi

Not only is this great when served over spicy chicken or pork, but I've also found that it stands well as a dip for spicy taco chips while you are grilling!

We love this salsa! It's great over grilled salmon. We also made some tasty chicken with it--I cut up chicken and cooked it in a pan with a little of the salsa, olive oil, salt and pepper, then served the chicken and more salsa over coconut rice. Then for lunch the next day I put the cold chicken and salsa over mixed greens (tossed with some balsamic vinegarette and goat cheese). It was awesome!

I have made a similar recipe for years that I made up one balmy summer day. It consists of mango, fresh cilantro, minced japaleno, lime zest, and a touch of cracked black pepper. I prefer it without the onion and use this fresh salsa as a compliment with baked chicken breast stuffed with a "pesto" of cilantro, japaleno, and chevre (a goat milk cheese).

I have served this twice with crackers and a store bought shrimp ring, and used the salsa as the dip. It has been a hit both times. It really is different and delicious.

delicious condiment for the low fat boneless chicken breasts. the red onion became too strong overnight. leftovers therefore were not as good. plan to try it with vidalia onion as well.YUM.

WOW! WONDERFUL! Try this salsa with grilled halibut steaks, etc.... It will boost the flavor and presentation of a variety of entrees. My husband loves this, and I will make it again and again. Enjoy!

I serve this with grilled shrimp but it could be served with anything! Add extra cayenne if you like a kick!

I might add a bit more cilantro, but otherwise it is a delicious recipe which can be served with many things, or eaten with a spoon. I'll make it again.

Double this recipe when you make it! It's divine. Good with anything and so summery and delightful. Terrific with those new cool lime-flavored tortilla chips, too.

A spicy cool recipe. It was a refreshing condiment served with sauteed ginger-garlic shrimp. We chose a Jacobs Creek Chardonnay to enjoy with this appetizer
