I was looking for a broccoli salad to make at work. It was the dressing that really appealed to me and I did make that according to the recipe, except for the chives. I added diced red bell pepper, bacon, dried cranberries, some red onion and omitted the romaine. It was a hit

It was good, quite good.. but I expected it to be awesome based on the previous reviews and it fell short. I tossed the dressing with everything except the romaine, adding that just before serving so it wouldn't loose it's crunch. I liked the mixture better without the addition of the lettuce as it turned out. The addition of some roasted pepitas (pumpkin seeds) really added another dimension. Next time I think I'll take the other posters idea and add some crispy prosciutto or bacon, it would go well.

This recipe is simple enough that I made it at my mother's house (where I lack my huge stash of spices and other supplies) trying to use what was on hand. The dressing was truly out of this world. I used milk with a bit of vinegar (add 1 tbsp white vinegar to an empty 1 cup container, fill with whole milk) as a substitute for buttermilk (the vinegar curdles the milk). I had to forego celery salt and used plain salt instead.

This was a quick and easy recipe. The salad came out great and the dressing had a rich garlic taste.

The dressing was out of this world - not too strong. Good for a crowd.

I would make this again, loved the addition of the garlic head, it really makes the dressing. I halved the recipee and used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk.

This was very good. I tasted it before the addition of the garlic and thought that it was very boring, but the roasted garlic really made the dressing. I still felt like it lacked that extra something special to put it over the top into a 4 fork salad.

Eggs-cellent the first time as is! The second time I threw in a couple of sliced hard boiled eggs just 'cause and if you like garlic only use the two heads. If you LOVE garlic three heads is divine!!! I have also tried bacon and/or prosciutto with great results. Great recipe.

Very tasty, and the dressing is easy enough to make. I did cut down on the mayonnaise to lower the fat just a little, and it still tasted great. The roasted garlic does carry it's flavour through nicely.

This recipe has become a staple in our house. The dressing is scrumptious. Since my husband is a vegetable wimp, I have to blanche the broccoli, saute the mushrooms and leave out the onions, but even then it is still great.

Quite good and very pretty. I did not toss the dressing with the salad but served it on the side. It's very good but looks kind of lumpy and unappetizing. Maybe that's why Mr. Rodgers suggests tossing it with the salad.

halved the recipe and subbed 3/4 of the mayo w/ nonfat plain yogurt. threw in more yogurt instead of the buttermilk since i didn't have that. we thought it was great!!! the garlic really thickens up the dressing. yum. I also reduced the celery salt and put in some garlic powder. we liked it a lot & will make it again at some point.

Great salad - takes a little bit of time to roast the garlic -- but the flavor of the dressing is well worth it. Will definitely make again!
