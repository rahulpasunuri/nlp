Loved this dish. Followed recipe as written, Used salt free chicken stock instead of low sodium broth. Great comfort food dish. Will definitely make this again!

I've been making this recipe since 2010 and it never fails to disappoint but next time I will try to add the dates to the broth mixture early as another reviewer suggested. This is DELICIOUS chicken and makes my kitchen smell amazing.

I used skin on/bone in chicken thighs, found out too late I was out of ground cumin and ginger, so I threw in some cumin seeds & grated fresh ginger (then ground some seeds in the spice grinder to add more, because it didn't smell like enough). Oh, and I had no shallots, so I used rough chopped sweet onion with a tad bit of garlic. I can't even imagine how good this would be had I had the proper ingredients! Oh, and I did follow a recommendation to throw the dates in during braising to let them break down into the sauce. It was fabulous! The cinnamon was the kicker for me. Such a subtle, warm taste... Loved it, served with "Moroccan Swiss chard salad" from this website. I'm sitting here eating cold leftovers after everyone else has gone to bed. But, Yay! I made enough for leftovers tomorrow night:)

This was very good, but it had way more steps than were strictly necessary to achieve good flavor. Why keep putting in and taking out the chicken? Why not make it as a stew? You'd get the same flavor profile with a LOT fewer dirty dishes. I used boneless skinless thighs and added carrots so there'd be veggies. Since neither my boyfriend nor I like shallots/onions, I think next time we'll leave them out and add more veggies, since the flavor didn't add much. I increased the cayenne and next time would increase it more and add ground cinnamon and more turmeric. I added the dates mid-way through and they got lovely and soft and almost disintegrated. Served over a quinoa/brown rice blend. Definitely going to make this again, but will not do all the steps of a braise. Just put the chicken in a pot then add the veggies, cook, then add spices and a bit of flour, then deglaze with lemon juice and stock and bring to a boil and then simmer until thick. It's how I make curry.

Made this with tofu, browned in olive oil, with vegetable stock rather than chicken broth, and red onion rather than shallots. Took the suggestion of using apricots and dates. Would have used sweet potatoes and garbanzos as suggested by others, but forgot to pick them up. Served with brown rice. Using tofu took far less time than chicken would have, and was really quite good. Would have given 4 forks but I changed the recipe.

Thank you "Cook from Brooklyn". This was my first go at this recipe, but I think the sweet potato and chickpea additions made this heartier and thicker than the original version would have been. I also only had boneless, skinless thighs on hand I didnt flour dredge but threw in all ingredients after the original shallot saute and popped in the oven in covered pan at 300 for about an hour. Served with jasmine rice

I rated this recipe 3 stars because I found I liked it better w/ a few modifications. First I just put the chicken in the pot with the other ingredients after browning shallots and spices and simmer altogether making it much easier and still very tasty. Secondly I use half the shallots sliced thinly or a red onion if I don't have shallots. I add a lot of carrots in large chunks, a sliced sweet potato and chickpeas. I also cut half of the dates and replace w/ some apricots - both chopped so they melt into the sauce as my kids don't like the chunks of date and apricot. While I made a lot of changes I think it's a great basic recipe to play off of.

We loved it - family of 4 with 2 teens. I replaced dates with dried apricots and prunes - awesome (i don't like dates). I cut the amount of shallots by half - the recipe seemed to ask for A LOT. This worked out well too. Enjoy

I thought this was a nice weeknight meal but I did a few substitutions that cut the cooking time significantly. I used a package of boneless/skinless chicken thighs instead of the cut-up chicken as called for in the recipe. I also didn't have enough shallots on hand, so I diced a purple onion. Once I added the chicken broth and lemon juice, I put the thighs back into my dutch oven to simmer. My son is not able to eat wheat so I made quinoa instead of the couscous. As I pulled out the quinoa from my pantry, I saw my red lentil container. I threw about a 1/2 cup of them into the chicken mixture. As we sat down to eat, I realized that next time I could up the lentils to 1 cup and 1 cup of garbanzo beans and it could replace the couscous/quinoa, which I would add at the same time as I put the thighs back in. I also threw in a handful of golden raisins with the dates. Our family is not a huge fan of cilantro so I was planning to substitute for Italian flat-leaf parsley which I forgot to add. Truthfully, it wasn't missed.

I use Epicurious all the time, but never bothered to write a review before trying this recipe. It deserves each one of those 4 forks! I made this dish exactly as written, using bone-in chicken breast halves and thighs. I served it, as suggested, over couscous. As another reviewer noted, it does take longer than 1 hr 40 minutes to prepare. It took me just over 2 hours, and I therefore wouldn't make it on a week night. But it was worth the effort, and not complicated to prepare. It easily fed four adults and one toddler, with leftovers enough for two adults to eat for dinner the next day.

Just had our leftovers and think the dish improves on the second day. The flavours had melded together so that we enjoyed the dish more than the first time. Even still, I'll be making the changes I'd outlined in my first review.

This was good but the sauce lacked depth. It was thin for me too, as per other reviews, and I followed the recipe to the letter. It took two hours from start to finish. I'm personally unconvinced that it was worth it, but my husband and three year old son really liked it, so I'll try it once more with apricots instead of dates, reduce the amount of lemon juice and substitute the spices with leftover ras el hanout from this recipe http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Individual-Bstillas-Moroccan-Chicken-and-Almond-Pies-12483.

This chicken was surprisingly fantastic even though I didn't have all exact ingredients. Substituted thick onion slices for the shallots and veggie stock instead of chicken broth. Also, substituted parsley for cilantro and added ground coriander. STILL was a fantastic recipe with all the switches. ChefH

this chicken is delicious. I sued 3 quarters (legs+ thighs connected). So good and moist.

I made this recipe last night for the first time, and loved it! I'll definitely do it again. I thought placing the chicken on a bed of whole peeled shallots was an interesting technique.

Rating: 4
This dish is incredible!!! The sauce is the most wonderful part - I thickened mine with cornstarch near the end. I would definitely add more dates (quartered) next time - they are like little honeyed gems in the sauce. I served this over a big heap of couscous with scallions, cinnamon, rehydrated zante currants, lemon juice, and toasted almonds in it, and my whole family raved.

Rating: 4
Amazing. A few people complain that their sauce isn't thickening. With a flour thickened sauce there is a risk of overheating, which causes the sauce to thin out again. Be sure to simmer at as low a temperature as you can, and know that cooking it longer than directed probably will not hurt the flavor, but might cause the sauce to thin out. That said, this doesn't create a very thick sauce at all. If you want something on the thicker side, you may want to double the flour. The flavors are spot on though. I wish I had added more dates, those were all picked out of the chicken.

Rating: 4
Stellar! I've made this twice. Kick the recipe up a notch - double the spices. Plus, I added corriander and smoked paprika. For a more flavorful sauce skip the salt and add a hearty tablespoon of Better than Bullion. It is a hit. Easy to make for a dinner party. The fresh cilantro and almonds on top help you feast with your eyes before you even taste it.

Fixed this for "Dinner & a Movie"(Casablanca.) We were shocked shocked by how good this disk was. A perfect blend of spices and flavors. Fixed a nice couscous with saffron & pine nuts to accompany this. I followed the recipe with all fresh spices. The 6 dinners all loved it. If you don't try this one "You'll regret it, maybe not today,maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life."

I expected this recipe to be less sharp tasting, and thicker. I would suggest starting with less lemon juice, and adding to your taste. Same with the cayenne. (Although I like spice.) The broth didn't seem to stand on it's own as a sauce without adding more flour. That worked quite well.

I've made this dish twice now and both times have been great! I made it first for my fiance and she couldn't stop saying how much she loved it. The mixture of sweet dates with savory chicken was a great pair. I made it again for a dinner party and my friends loved it as well and were impressed. I made it just like the recipe says to and it was easy.

Rating: 4
Really delicious and very easy. I was a little worried while the shallots were cooking, as frankly the aroma wasn't anything exceptional and the sauce was very sour, probably because I used unusually sour lemons. The end result, though, was really scrumptious and I can't wait to make this again. I used three large boneless skinless chicken breast halves with half the shallot sauce recipe plus extra dates, almonds, and cilantro. I probably could have used a little more sauce, given the size of the chicken breasts. Because of the sourness of the sauce, I did not add the final lemon juice and added a few extra dates. I quartered rather than halved the dates, based on recommendations here, and agree that's a better method. I left out the tumeric, since there was none in the store, and used ground cinnamon rather than cinnamon sticks. Incidentally, this would be delicious with any dried fruit, and Claudia Roden has a version in Arabesque in which she uses sauteed fresh pears rather than dates.

This was sooo good. The broth didn't thicken so I added a little cornstarch to thicken it. (Make sure to simmer at least 7 min to cook out the starchy taste.)The complexity of the spices was wonderful. I almost left out the cilantro because I'm not a fan. I'm glad I didn't. It complimented the other spices and really made the dish. Next time I'll add more dates. They burst with honey sweetness when you find them.

Rating: 4
Used 2 red onions and chicken thighs and legs, and this was delectable! Couldn't find my cumin, so used a heaping teaspoon of Garam Masala and 1 less cinnamon stick. You cannot go wrong with this recipe! My dates were a bit dry, so I split them and added them in after the chicken. Savory with a hint of sweetness and a kick of spice - Perfection! Will try some apricots next time.

Rating: 3
Next time, I will chop the dates smaller. While I appreciate the presentation, I think the recipe will benefit from the sweetness being more distributed.

I made this according to the recipe, using only boneless chicken thighs and bone-in legs with skin, substituting about a tablespoon of ground cinnamon for the sticks, doubling the amount of dates because I adore them and adding about a 1/4 of a cup of Turkish apricots I wanted to use up. I ended up just putting the toasted almonds in the stew. My husband swooned at his first bite of this and had seconds. I served it with orzo tossed with cilantro, olive oil, chicken boullion and a dash of cayenne. I will adding this to my repetoire of recipes! This is not to be missed!

Excellent and fragrant. In order to make it easier to peal the shallots, put them in boiling water for 30 seconds, cut the top and bottom off, slit the skin and unwrap.

This recipe is so flavorful! My entire family, including my 4 year old daughter, loved it. I used turkey breast instead and it worked out great. I also served it over quinoa for a healthy alternative. I had roasted sweet potatoes as a side dish... delicious! I'd recommend this recipe to anyone, but make sure you give yourself enough time!

Wow, this really delivered on flavor. Had to improvise a bit, because I had no dates. I used a variety of mixed dried fruit--apricots, plums, apples, peaches, and pears--and added it when I returned the chicken to the pot. Only had a couple chicken breasts, so did half the recipe with two large ones. Served over couscous cooked in chicken broth. The combination of the sweetness of the fruit, Moroccan spiciness, and the touch of citrus was wonderful. Cilantro and almonds were a perfect garnish. Made Moroccan carrots as a side. I will definitely do this one again.

Edible, but not wow. I made it exactly as described. No explosion of taste/flavor; sauce never thickened. For the time involved, it was disappointing.

My best friend summed this up best: you read the expression "explosion of flavor," but this dish brings it to life. The recipe, though involved, was straight forward and simple. All the cooking times were spot-on. Even my 7 year old daughter loved this! The prefect blend of savory and exotic, this is easily a new favourite in our home. The time it takes to cook this is not excessive, but I would say it's not exactly a "quick dinner." Definitely a dish for colder weather, and quite filling when you add the couscous. I would recommend this to anyone. The recipe is perfect and needs no adjustments, substitutions, or modifications. As usual, you can add some heat by upping the cayenne content, but I am not a fan of overly spicy food and this was just right as is. The cilantro and almonds are a MUST, and help finish this dish to perfection. AMAZING!!

Amazing dish! It took a bit longer for me to make it than expected so I wouldn't put it as a "quick dish" but the taste was exceptional. The first time I just made it for a regular family meal. It was so good (and nice looking!) that I looked up the recipe again to make it for a dinner party tonight. My only substitution was to use some yellow onions instead of all of the shallots because I didn't have quite enough shallots. Turned out wonderful!

Made this this weekend and it was delicious. Was a little short on shallots so subbed in a small-med white onion otherwise followed the recipe as close as possible (likely used a little more cumin) and it was delicious! Served with saffron rice and persian bread - very good and a nice change of flavours from ordinary!

A bit of work (peeling the shallots) but definitely worth it! The end result was absolutely tongue-swallowing delicious. My husband and I could not stop eating and soaking up the wonderful sauce with more couscous. I let the dates simmer a bit longer in the sauce to let the flavors blend, and preferred the dark meats (thighs & legs) over the white meat. The sliced almonds and fresh cilantro at the end accented the dish wonderfully. A very worthwhile recipe to make!

I was a little tentative to make this recipe with all the shallots, I thought the flavor might be a little too overwhelming. Therefore, I did wimp out, and used 6 shallots, and one yellow onion. I also used fresh ginger, and ground cinnamon as some other people had done previously. I was thrilled with this dish! I can't imagine it being better than it was, but may try to use only shallots in future. My guests loved this dish and I would definitely make it again!

This makes a tasty and satisfying meal. I used serrano peppers and fresh ginger instead of ground ginger and cayenne because I think it provides more fresh taste and character.

I completely disagree with the first review as well. We tried the recipe last night and it was anything but flavorless and awful. Everyone loved it and (sadly) there weren't any leftovers.Therefore, we are going to make it again tonight! If you like this type of food, you are going to love it. Very easy to prepare (peeling the shallots was probably the most labor-intensive part of the entire dish). This recipe is most definitely a keeper!

I used onions instead of shallots. Mixed stock with onions a bit earlier because of brown bits at base of pan. Used chicken breast and parcooked. Cooked fully when added to pot at end.
