The dressing combined with the ingredients tasted great. I liked the use of fennel and radishes and grapefruit for kick. I did not care for the cheese, however- too mild- so the next day I used goat cheese crumbles and it added a nice creamy, tangy effect that worked with the other strong flavors of the dish.

I followed this salad to the letter and didn't love it. The dressing was bursting with flavor though I found the radish and parsley a bit overbearing. I would probably omit both next time and maybe stick some toasted nuts or something else in the medley instead. It did present really well with the variety of color. My date didn't feel the cheese was necessary, I could go either way with it.

I am always looking for interesting salads. A peppery(arugula), sweet(fennel), tart(grapefruit)salty(parmesan) combination with a burst of "hot" from the radishes. I've made it many times.
