With friends we have made every menu for Thanksgiving for 25+years. This soup ranks with the bottom of the barrel. We dug the parsley root, cleaning took two of us an hour, no flavor for the effort. Never again.

The flavors of this soup are excellent. It is not as heavy as a creamed soup so nice as a first course. I couldn't find parsley root so used celery root instead. The shaved chestnuts add a nice accent flavor and crunchy finish.

Loved the flavor, though it was subtle. And that was after adding a parsnip to the other roots, as well as a dash of balsamic vinegar at the end. I also just crumbled one roasted chestnut onto each bowl of soup.

This is a solid, if basic, pureed root- vegetable soup. The parsley-root flavor is good, but don't kill yourself finding parsley root if turnips, etc are more available. I plan to make it again adding extra butter and extra white pepper. Also, I couldn't find roasted chestnuts so I bought fresh and roasted them myself at home, which was easy.

I wouldn't call this one a crowd-pleaser. There is a delicate flavor to it... but my guests were pretty lukewarm about it. The next evening when I heated it up for leftovers, I added heavy cream, and it was pretty good. Also, make sure you research a good source for the chestnuts. I looked everywhere, and brought home the canned kind from Faugier... a fairly good French brand. They just crumbled into little pieces and I was not able to slice them. I left them out entirely. They were pretty gross looking anyway.
