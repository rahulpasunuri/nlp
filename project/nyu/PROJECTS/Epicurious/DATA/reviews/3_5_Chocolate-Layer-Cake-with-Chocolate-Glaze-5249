I love this recipe! I have to say, I was a little worried when I mixed it up and it was still really soupy. I made these as mini cupcakes, and I still had to add more time to the cooking time to get them fully baked. But the taste and texture are a real keeper.

I absolutely love this recipe! For cupcakes the recipe is fine as is, but for a stackable cake I needed to make it a little sturdier. So with adding a little more flour and sugar I got the perfect batter texture. This recipe has ended my search for the perfect chocolate cake!

Delicious cake! I used a chocolate mousse frosting instead of the filling and glaze and it was a huge hit!

Great recipe. Very easy and works well with molds.

I do agree with all the other reviewers about runny glaze. It was impossible to assemble the first time I made this cake; however, my family loved the taste of the cake so much and requested for it again, I made the glaze with just 3/4 cup of whipping cream the second time and came out perfectly.

The glaze was awesome, and so was the filling. HOWEVER, I thought chill the filling meant put it in the fridge for three or so hours. Nope. It was still not nearly thick enough to stay between the layers. I guess it needed either the freezer or about eight hours in the fridge. Maybe if the filling was made a day ahead and left in fridge overnight? Anyway, after hours of work and waiting it all came oozing out the sides and made it impossible to keep the layers in place.

Oh my gosh this is SO delicious! It is time consuming because of all the refrigeration of ingredients involved, but so worth it (Dahlia Lounge does it again!). The cake is super fudgey without being dense or heavy. I had a decent amount leftover of both the filling and the glaze. The filling came out the sides when the cake layers were stacked. I probably could have refrigerated the glazed cake and then done a second layer of glaze and chilled again, but I ran out of time. I garnished with fresh raspberries around the circumference of the cake. I will definitely make this again, as it can be prepared in advance, but note it does not travel well as it should stay chilled (the the slippery filling makes the cake layers slide during transport!).

The cake was very good. I also used two round 9 inch cake pans. I didn't have buttermilk so I used whole milk which seem to work out fine. The filling was wonderfull....I added a bit of AMARULLA....a South African Bailys..it gave the chocolate a bit of a spark.

I have made this cake twice and both times it was a hit. The first time I found it a little hard to assemble, so the second time I used round cake pans and I thought this was easier. This tastes great after a day or two so don't be afraid to make it ahead.

The cake and filling are good, but I have made it twice and always had trouble with the glaze - too runny. The last time I made it, the glaze destroyed the entire thing. I would make the cake and pudding again, but next time I will choose a different frosting or ganache recipe.

I have been searching for a chocolate cake recipe for a long time. This one is definitely the ultimate chocolate cake recipe for those who don't like the "fudgy" cakes. I used 3-8" round pans instead and made chocolate ganache for the topping and sides. It came out perfect, my whole family loved it, and they're very picky when it comes to desserts.

I have already made this cake twice, bith times a big hit. Does anyone else have the problem of the filling being a little lumpy? Not bad, just a few smal lumps. Nobody noticed in the finished product though. It was yummmmmy!

I'm in South Africa, so ingredients differed a little, but this cake was absolutely wonderful. The recipe worked like a charm even though I had to substitute the thicker golden syrup for the corn syrup (not available here), I used castor sugar (by preference -- much finer) instead of granulated, and local chocolate (which is excellent). The cake was to-die-for delicious, and my sister though it had been professionally baked ...! Everything worked: the cake, the filling, the lovely shiny glaze. A winner.

I had some trouble keeping this upright, the layers did not want to stay put. That is my only complaint, although it looked ugly (my layers slide off) it was very tasty - my father thinks it's the best chocolate cake he's had. Perhaps toothpicks would help? can anyone help with this?

Oh I really don't want to be a jerk here but... The cake tasted marginally better than a boxed chocolate cake and the filling is essentially, well--pudding. Not that this was a *bad* cake or anything, it just didn't meet my *expectations*. I've sampled many Epicurious, Bon Appetite and RSVP chocolate dessert recipes and this is really mediocre in comparison. Perhaps I'm just spoiled, but try the chocolate-cream espresso tort instead. --t

It's a fabulous chocolate cake... soooo good!! The only thing I didn't like that much was having to do the filling one day before, for it to be chilled. But except for that, it was wonderful!!

Super YUM!! Better than the double chocolate cake. Fabulously moist, not too sweet or rich. The milk chocolate center...AMAZING. Best to be patient with the glaze, I didn't wait long enough and it was to runny.

Excellent! One minor point -- I think you'll get better results if the glaze is room temperature or even chilled in the fridge slightly. I found that it was a bit too runny when it was lukewarm.
