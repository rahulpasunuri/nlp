I was not a huge fan. Too much garlic and kind of bland.

Excellent for dinner, and just as good for lunch the next day. I was in a rush, so instead of roasting the poblano I sauteed it with the onion. Also, I put the toasted tortillas in the blender with the corn and milk to puree and it came out perfectly while saving me a step. Big hit with the family as well.

One of the best items I've made from epicurious. Increase poblano by .5 to whole extra. A little extra sugar and salt help elevate the corn flavor, too.
