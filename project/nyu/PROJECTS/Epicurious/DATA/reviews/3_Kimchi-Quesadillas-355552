Now that I've tried the kimchi quesadilla from the actual kogi food truck, I have to write a second review. The quesadillas they make in the truck are very different and way better. First, they are smothered in some kind of sauce, then covered with sesame seeds. The sauce wasn't kochujang or any other super common korean sauce. It was something savory and not spicy. Not too sure the home cook can duplicate that. Second, there was either no cheese or just a tiny bit of cheese, and that was a serious improvement because it allows the unique taste of the kimchi that has been crisped up in butter to come through. So I'm definitely going to cut down the cheese drastically next time.

Super yummy and easy. I made as directed, but cut the butter in half. It was a little too much cheese for me, so I'd reduce those amounts a bit next time. Otherwise great, though.

This recipe sounds weird but I promise it's really, really good. We're all addicted at my house. Cilantro works fine instead of shiso, regular pickled cabbage works fine instead of kimchi, and kochujang is awesome for dipping (if you like spicy). I usually make these in the toaster oven instead of frying them.

I love kimchi and this is seriously addictive. I make enough for one serving, leave out the butter and toast the quesadilla in a dry cast iron skillet. Luckily I have shiso growing in my yard, but this works with cilantro too.
