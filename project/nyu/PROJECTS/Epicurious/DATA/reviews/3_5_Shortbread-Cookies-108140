Oh, I forgot, I baked them at 325 for about 10 minutes when rolled to 1/2 inch. They'll brown lightly so you'll know when they're ready.

Ok Ok, I read the reviews and did some tweaking. Here you go: 1 pound salted butter 1 1/4 c lightly packed brown sugar 4 c ap flour 1/2 tsp salt 1 1/2 tsp vanilla This was a good start for a great recipe. I didn't add frosting or any other sprinkles or anything I just made them for friends with iced tea. They turned out great and I will keep this recipe on file. Short bread is slightly bland, but not when you use salted butter! Try it and enjoy!

a very disappointing recipe. The cookies are very boring, the oven temp given is too low, and the finished product is too pale and dull. Yummy shortbread isn't tricky - try another recipe, don't waste your time on this.

A great, basic recipe. I was looking for a simple shortbread recipe that would do well with the lavender flower buds I was planning on tossing in. This did the trick! I took the advice of creaming the butter and sugar first, then added a splash of vanilla and a handful of lavender buds, mixed in the flour and baked at 300. Yum!

I would definitely make these again. I rolled them into logs and then rolled the logs in coloured sugar for the holidays -- it was delightful!

Not a good recipe if you follow it as written. The baking temp is too low, and the cookies are bland and require a touch of salt, and / or vanilla, and / or lemon zest or something to give them a decent flavor. If you twek this recipe, you can come up with a good basic shortbread, but it does need tweaking.

I made this recipe, refrigerated the dough to keep it firm, then baked it at 300 deg. Awesome. Reminds me of my High School days on the wrestling team. I would Eat a large piece of shortbread and drink water before every practice for a boost of energy. Thanks!

My recipe is almost the same as this one except I use salted butter, and only 1 cup brown sugar. I cream the butter and sugar in the mixer until fluffy, then add the the flour. I bake the cookies at 375 F. for 15 minutes.

Just wanted to say I dont think the other reviewers are being mean...I have seen some REALLY mean comments under other recipes...

Why are all the cooks being so mean about this recipe? Think of how you are making this person feel! Talk about an inferiority complex! If you can't say something nice, then don't say anything at all! I think this is a WONDERFUL recipe!!! Thanks! :)

Good classic shortbread recipe. I definitely agree with the other raters that the oven temp should be increased (I went to 325 degrees) and salt added. I used European-style (higher fat ratio) organic butter and baked them until they were deeply golden (you get a nice caramel/praline taste from the browning of the butter). They came out beautifully!

Very quick and easy with the following modifications: cream the butter (I used salted - glad I did) and sugar. Add the flour. Shape the dough into three logs with the aid of waxed paper. Chill for about an hour. Slice into 1/4 inch slices. Bake at 300 for 15 minutes until just starting to turn golden at the edges.

You should always cream the butter, then beat in the sugar for shortbread. Then you slowly add the flour. Otherwise, the previous reviewer is correct, the sugar would never incorporated. The proper temperature for shortbread is 300 degrees. Also, the cookies should be chilled before baking or they'll spread too much.

Three things: I think the dough would benefit from a bit of salt, and the brown sugar has a hard time incorporating into the dough, and the 275 oven temp, I think, should be more like 325. Nice shortbread otherwise.
