The paprika made a nice addition.

I make my bruschetta something like this. I deseed and cube the tomatoes, add crushed garlic and some olive oil. I toast the bread as is, put the tomatoes mixture on top, add slices of fresh mozzerella on top, and put it back in the oven. Grinding pepper on it at the end is a great contast to the pure whiteness of fresh mozzerellla (the cheese keeps all of the ingredients on the cheese while you eat it), and it tastes good too. I used this in a cooking class I run over here, and they all really liked it

This was wonderful. I sprinkled basil and oregano on the bread before grilling. I used sun dried tomato bread in the recipe, and thought the garlic/tomato rub gave it a distinct flavor--we served it with grilled salmon and a cucumber salad, it was the perfect summer meal!

Great recipe! I fell in love with bruschetta on a trip to Italy -- now I know how to make it at home. This recipe works like a charm. I left out the paprika and thought it was perfect that way....
