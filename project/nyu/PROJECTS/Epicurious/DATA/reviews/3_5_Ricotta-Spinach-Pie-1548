I did what other reviewers suggested - made in muffin tin - no crust. I did reduce the cheese using 3 Cheese Italian Blend and only 5 oz. Also added 2 slices of deli ham chopped up - Excellent!

Too much cheese, too little spinach. Going back to Molly Katzen's Moosewood recipe.

I found this recipe incredibly easy and delicious. I used only the ricotta (fat-free) and the Parmesan cheese and it was still yummy. I discovered an easy way to squeeze the defrosted spinach. Defrost in a wide-lipped bowl (like the soup bowl in a set) in the microwave and then stack another soup bowl on top of the one with the defrosted spinach and clinch them together over the sink so the top bowl basically squeezes out the liquid in the spinach in the bottom bowl. That way you don't waste a lot of paper towels/mess up your dish towel!

What a surprise this was absolutely wonderful. Only change, I added roasted macadamia nuts (I had on hand). It put a needed little crunch into each bite. Thanks.

I made this with some modifications-- I used homemade pie crust, fresh spinach, about 1 tbsp butter + 1 tbsp olive oil, added ~ 1 tbsp chopped fresh dill, and substituted feta for the mozzarella. It was wonderful, but almost like a light quiche instead of the dense pie I was expecting. My boyfriend loooved it. (and he's not a big veggie fan.) We'll be making this a lot!

One of the easiest, better recipes I've made in a while. Followed suggestions and used mostly low-fat and non-fat cheese, no crust, and baked in muffin tins. Definitely reduce baking time in muffin tin. Turned out great. I'd even suggest making these in mini muffin tins and serving as an hors d'oeuvres. Very delicious!

I would make this again. We had lots of spinach from our Community Agricultural Grant Farms delivery so it was deployed and delicious in this recipe. Next time in ramekins or in muffin tins. The crust was not good but the filling was excellent. Yes, maybe with feta instead of the....

Sooooo good, just one wee thing... the next time we make this (and we WILL make it again) we would bake the crust first, then add the cheese mixture and bake it to the finish. The first time we made this, we did not bake the crust first and the result was a very soggy crust... but still very edible. The combination of cheeses was delish, and was also good served cold the next day. But it's much better right out of the oven!!! Another keeper!

Easy, quick. My changes: Used fresh spinach, added sliced almonds. For cheese filling, used nonfat cottage cheese, one egg, asiago and extra sharp cheddar shredded off the block. Topped with slices of beefsteak tomato. Does not need added salt. Baked uncovered at 400 until center no longer runny. Got rave reviews among work colleagues. Very filling.

I didn't rate this with forks because I changed a few things to add flavor, as other reviewers suggested (added 2 cloves garlic, 4 oz gruyere in place of 4 oz mozzarella) but something was still missing. I baked it without a crust in an 8x8 ceramic dish and served it in squares for brunch. It was good but not great.

Okay, I'm going to do that sort of annoying thing and say I didn't make the recipe exactly as stated--but really what I omitted was the crust. It made it a heck of a lot quicker and works quite well in a well-buttered casserole dish. I did also add Kalamata olives and sprinkled pine nuts on top for the last 5 minutes of baking. Tasty.

This was horrible! I'm not by any standards a novice cook and I followed the directions to a "T" and it was disastrous! The top was a lovely brown but the pie itself was pure mush. Maybe add an egg or two and use only half of the ricotta, but this was just horrible. All you can even taste is ricotta.

Yum, first time to review a dish and this one had to be it. I am faced with a husband who likes meat and potatoes & a vegetarian teen. Served this w/rolled stuffed flank steak w/marinara and roasted vegetables. Cut back on cheese, added garlic, sun-dried tomatoes and chopped zucchini to the onions. Also fresh spinach. Rich dish but all had their protein and veggies and 2nds were had by all!

I made a very low cal/low carb, version of this recipe, using no-fat ricotta, part-skim mozzarella, 1/2 cup of parmesan, egg beaters instead of eggs, olive oil spray for sauteeing and no crust. It was absolutely delicious for such a "healthy" recipe! I also used fresh spinach and added chopped sweet red peppers, which made it look very festive for the holidays!

Wonderful, fast weeknight recipe. I made it crustless, and for a family dinner it definitely doesn't need the added richness and calories of a crust, but for company I would make it with a crust. Fast, easy, tasty. I used part skim cheese (because it was just for a weeknight family dinner) and used a little gruyere because of the reviews that said it was bland. I think next time I would just follow the recipe because it didn't need the sharp cheese. Good, simple comfort food for a chilly night.

Lord have mercy! My husband told me to stop making rude noises at the table, it was so good. Used homemade pastry (am repelled by storebought pastry), 1.5 Tbsp olive oil instead of butter, fresh spinach and added about 1/2c pesto. Mmmm.... Talk about dining pleasure. Freezes well, as stated.

I would make this dish again only if adding a lot more flavor to it. As written it is pretty bland, but a good basis for creativity. Taking advice of other reviewers, I added garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, pine nuts and feta, just not enough. can definitely cut down on the mozz. and use a more flavorful cheese. I used a homemade pie crust and served for dinner, but it would also be good for brunch.

I agree that you should modify the cheese medley. I used feta instead of mozzarella, and I added a generous amount of crushed red pepper to the cheese/egg. I also threw in some roasted red bell pepper at the very end. Yum!

OK, I have loved this recipe for years, and never thought to change a thing....My local store was out of regular ricotta (!) but had goats milk ricotta, so I tried it instead. WOW. I only used 8 oz (its pretty strong) and splashed in a little milk to thin it out a bit. It was the best quiche I've ever made. As this ricotta was a bit salty, I recommend using unsalted butter and not adding the extra salt. I made it in an 8" tart pan with a refrigerated crust, which I pre-baked a bit.

Smells and tastes great! I added 2 sauteed cloves of garlic, made it crustless in an 8x8 dish which had been buttered and sprinkled with 1/2 cup bread crumbs. This isn't really a "vegetable" side dish, the spinach quantity is almost incidental to all of the cheeses. Next time I will double the spinach used. It was a hit at our Easter dinner.

This was delicious. I served it as a side dish for a large family dinner. Taking the advice of other reviewers I skipped the pastry and it worked fine crustless. Made it a second time and used a base of about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs on an olive oil sprayed pie pan and this was even better!!

This dish is ideal for brunch. The first time, I chopped, steamed, and drained two bunches of fresh spinach. I usually reduce the excess water by gently blotting the spinach with paper towels. I also added a small bunch of fresh basil. As another cook from Los Angeles suggested, I opt to go crustless, which lends it a lighter quality (plus I've been making too many quiches this season!). My boyfriend thought it perfect, but I found that there was a bit too much cheese - used Italian (buffalo) mozzarella - I would probably either omit the mozzarella altogether next time or reduce it by half. Second time making this I used 1 bunch chard, which I steamed longer than the bunch of spinach, and added a seeded chopped tomato that needed to be eaten. No mozzarella, just the ricotta, parmiggiano reggiano, and the bit of gruyere I had left. For a lighter effect, I separated the egg yolks from the whites, whipped up the whites and fold them in gently at the end. This latter was excellent with a Potato Soup with dill, paprika, and smoked gouda.

The best thing about this dish is that you don't have to use the crust if you don't want the carbs or calories. I've been making this for decades by just pouring the mixture into a greased pie plate. I've also made individual servings in a Texas sized muffin tin.

By far my favorite savoury pie!! I use a store-bought pastry crust and thawed frozen spinach and have access to wonderful ricotta (in Rome). It comes out wonderful every time and keeps really well in the fridge.

We make this often and its perfect every time. My whole family loves this, even our 21 month old! I have yet to make this with spinach, but my family loves it with onions, lots of garlic, fresh sage and basil, and sun dried tomatoes. I have made it with both eggs and eggbeaters and prefer the egg beaters as it the pie is lighter in texture yet just as flavorful. I have also made it with the exact amount of cheese stated in the recipe and with 1/2 of the required mozzarella - both are great.

This was just as I hoped it would taste, excellent. The seasonings were just right, I wouldn't change a thing! I served it with marinated tomatoes, zucchini and onions and it was a great dinner. Certainly not "cholesteral free", but it was worth it.

This dish was a great hit with my guests who asked to take the leftovers home. I did not have mozzarella, but used a 4 cheese combo of asiago, romano, parmesean and mozz, plus the required parmesean and ricotta. It was light and fluffy and all around delightful A good Easter dish, but was asked not to wait till next Easter to make it.

This is a delicious dish that reheats very well. I used Cafe Azul's pastry dough (if you haven't checked that out, it's well worth it), added a couple cloves of garlic, used fresh spinach, and baked in a springform pan. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. It's rich and great for a main dish.

I've made this recipe many times, with many additions at different times. It goes wonderfully with Italian sausage, bacon (cooked and drained first) or cubed ham. Black olives are great touch, and I've actually added some chopped fennel that was in the fridge. Also, I've used whatever cheese was available, even cubed cheddar or crumbled gorgonzola. Sprinkle pine nuts on the top and let them toast in the baking for a nice finishing touch. I'll have to try the tomatoes as one cook suggested, sounds great.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I made it exactly as written (except added 1-2 minced garlic cloves while sauteeing the onions) and didn't find it too salty or too stringy or too bland.

I followed some of the prior reviews - cutteh mozzarella and parmesan by at least half. Kept the eggs to 3. Adding garlic and fresh basil was a good tip.Even with leaving it unattended beyond the 1 hour of baking, it was great and not dry. Friends and family loved it, handed the recipe out immediately. But my kids still figured out it had spinach in it and barely took a bite.

I think I've made this about 15 times. It's very forgiving is you switch around the ingredients a bit-- like I add tomatoes and garlic and use fresh spinach-- or sometimes substitute drained large-curd cottage cheese for the ricotta. It's always good and always a hit.

The first time I made this, I thought the pie was rather bland. Then after reading everyone else's comments, I tried again - this time adding a clove of garlic, a small grated carrot, and 2 chopped green onions. It was a hit! Delicious! (By the way, I had to bake it for 1 hour for it to brown, not the 40 minutes indicated).

I used to make spinach pie very similar to this commercially 20+ years ago. The key was insuring that the spinach was very dry. We also put a layer of spinach & onion on the bottom, brush with egg wash, add cheeses, then another layer of mixture, more cheese and egg. Our version had no crust and it was a restaurant hit. Try shaved carrot in the middle for extra color.

we liked this quite well. due to cholestoral, we used "egg beaters" rather than whole eggs and i cut back on the amount of mozarella to about half of what was called for. we thought the flavor and texture was quite good and will look forward to making this now and again.

I incorporated a number of suggestions made by other cooks: garlic, crumbled bacon, basil, oregano, and garlic. I also used less cheese than originally recommended and used only 2 eggs instead of 3. We both thought it was excellent although I must admit it was very dry. I know I will make it again, but next time I will go with 3 eggs instead of 2. This one's a keeper!

I love this pie! My boyfriend does not like spinach so I used sausage and added some tomatoes as well, another time used ham. I doctored up the ricotta with garlic, and that really added flavor! I'll make this dish again and again trying different things!

Oh, so good! I've tried it both as written, and with a few variations... while it was delicious both ways, I prefer it my way. I added a clove of garlic to the onions, and then some fresh kale to the spinach. Also, basil, oregano, and coarsely ground black pepper to the ricotta/egg mixture. I only used two eggs, and only a sprinkle of mozzarella and parmesan. Don't worry, it's still very rich and cheesy this way; I'm certainly not one to skimp on cheese! :-) Also, previous reviewers were right; it does take closer to an hour to cook thoroughly. Of course, this will depend on your oven, so you should start checking at 45 or 50 minutes.

This was really delicious. I made it in a prepared deep dish pie crust which made preparation much easier.It was very thick and needed to cook 20 minutes longer then the recipe called for.It is very filling and really should be the center of the meal.

This reminds me of the spinach bread we use to buy in the Italian bakeries, brought back memories. I used 2 packages frozen spinach and placed in fry pan, slowly thawed and pressed out water. In another pan sautee large onion diced, then add 1 bulb of fresh garlic minced and sauteed for a few minutes longer, add to large pan of spinach. I then cut up 2 raw baking potatoes (chucks) removed casing from 2 links of Italian sausage (cut into chucks) and added to the spinach/onion and cooked slowly. When the potatoes were tender I removed from heat and let sit until cold. I used 1 container ricotta about 1/2 cup fresh large grated parmesan and 2 eggs, sea salt, fresh ground nutmeg and mixed well and folded in the cold spinach/potatoes/sausage mixture. Placed in deep pie shell and baked in counter top oven 325 for about 50 minutes. (put pan unded pie to catch drippings) Removed pie and placed cover on top until ready to eat. Had some for breakfast, yum. I will make it next week for a party and will use a sheet pan and slice into party serving sizes

I was not too impressed with this recipe, first of all I found the Parmesan Cheese overkilled the rest of the pie, far too much and the mozzarella cheese was a little on the heavy side. I do intend to make this one again, but I will definitely leave out the mozzarella and parmesan cheese and I will substitute 8 oz. of tasty grated cheese instead use 4 eggs instead of three. Oh by the way I used Phyllo Pastry rather than a refrigerated pie crust. This worked really well.

This was very good. I made this for a co-ed baby shower I was throwing for 15+ people and made sure to inform the men that this was a 'pie' and not a 'quiche'. I think I followed this recipe exactly except I used a deep dish frozen pie crust. And, yes, the filling was almost too much for it, but I was still able to get it all in. I served this with a sausage/cheddar pie as well so that I'd have something for the carnivorous as well as the vegetarians.
