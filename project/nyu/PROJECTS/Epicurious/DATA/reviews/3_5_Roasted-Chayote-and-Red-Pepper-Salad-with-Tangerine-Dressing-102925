I took another reviewers idea of serving this salad with spicy fare. Oh my! It was delicious! I didn't have a serano chile, so I used a fresh barely roasted green chile (enough to get the skin off, but still fleshy and flavorful on it's own). I made a big pan of shredded beef and green chile enchiladas smothered in fresh green chile enchilada sauce with sour cream, cheddar cheese and a delicious Mexican cheese mixed, some guacomole, and lots of sliced black olives. I laid two of my corn tortilla enchiladas on the plate and nestled in this salad as a one plate meal. HEAVEN! Just perfect combo. I would use this salad as is, add some fresh shrimp, grilled or steamed and the shell and tails off, along with fresh thick corn tortillas with some salted butter for a wonderful light and refreshing dinner or lunch!

very fresh and clean tasting dressing, a chayote is a fun way to add variety to salad

The dressing is refreshing and good; chayotes with bell peppers sitting on a Bibb lettuce are like three strangers sitting in a waiting room- they have nothing to say to each other. Also, it's much easier to peel whole roasted peppers than quartered ones-believe me!

I really liked this dish, it was easy to make and the salad was good even the next day.

I made this with the Chicken Mole (based on the previous reviewers suggestion...Thank You!) and it is LOVELY. A total change from the usual, simple and elegant. This is worth making, for certain...

No one's made this recipe?? I served this last night along with a chicken mole recipe and it was perfect. This salad is a very refreshing accompaniment to a spicy entree.
