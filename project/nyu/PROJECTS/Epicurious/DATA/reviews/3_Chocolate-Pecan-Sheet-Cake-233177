Absolutely the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten! The frosting is like fudge. We did put the pecans on the frosting instead of in the cake. Fabulous. It disappeared in no time!

I thought this cake tasted like it was from a cake mix and I followed it to the letter. I took it to a party and everyone liked it, although I thought it was much too sweet. Not worth the effort.
