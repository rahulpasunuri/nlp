I used just raspberries and it was great. I did brown the crust for 10 minutes prior to adding the filling and that was a great hint. I used unsweetened raspberry jam and my family really like this. I would serve this again.

I made this tart with white peaches. The crust turned out good, despite being a crumbly dough and getting overworked. I blanched the peaches, peeled, thinly sliced, and arranged in an overlapping, circular pattern. Glazed with apricot jam. Beautiful presentation. This is best eaten right away, as it didn't benefit from a couple hours in the fridge. Crust became a little soggy. Excellent flavor combo of peaches and almond.

Great recipe! I omitted the strawberries and used only the raspberries. Instead of whipped cream or ice cream, I whipped marscapone cream with a tablespoon of heavy cream, 1/4 tsp vanilla, and sugar to taste.

Way too sweet.

I reviewed this recipe previously. The recipe has been improved. See the Gourmet cookbook. The recipe on Epicurious is the old version.

Have made this twice. The frangipane gets brown while the pie crust is a little light. Do not use foil on the frangipane; it sticks. Next time, I will try to partially bake the crust and then fill with frangipane. No matter how you make it, this is delicious!

Very good and easy to make. I made it with raspberries, blueberries and bananas to look like the US flag for the 4th. Coconut for the stars, apricot jam to glaze the bananas.

I've been making this tart since it first appeared on the cover of Gourmet in 1991. I like to use red currant jelly for the glaze. In our household, this serves 2.

I've made this twice now for July 4th with great success (arranging the strawberry slices in a star with blueberries around the edges). I use a pate brisee recipe with only butter and add ground almonds. Blind baking the crust avoided the soggy effect someone mentioned earlier.

This recipe is a classic, and a real winner. We used blueberries, because I'd bought a 2 pound box of fresh, and needed to use them. But the recipe is highly adaptable, so use your imagination....Bon appetite!

Very nice dessert. I took others' suggestion and used frozen puff pastry, which was completely successful. I also used blueberries, bananas, and raspberries arranged as a tricoleur for Bastille Day, which was a visual poem. Even though I forgot to fork-prick the pastry before baking, and the whole thing swelled up and forced the frangipane into the center, I was able to remedy most of this while it was still hot. I used raspberry jam (with balsamic vinegar, as suggested) on the berries, and ginger pear jelly mixed with Amaretto on the bananas. Really easy to make. It was a huge success, and absolutely delicious.

Lovely, light, and luscious. I used individual tart pans-doubled the almond mixture and thinned the strawberry glaze with a little balsamic reduction. Blueberries instead of raspberries created more contrast, more antioxidants and cost less. Time consuming but worth it.

We made this for company and it turned out fantastic even though we used a store-bought crust and just fitted it into the tart pan. Our guests were impressed. We will make again and again!

This turned out great! Followed the directions exactly except I used all strawberries with a strawberry glaze I made. Served with a little bit of whipped cream. Looked beautiful, tasted even better. My daughter thought it was the perfect dessert.

Rather than making rows of berries, I circled them around the rim of the tart pan. Used only one cup of raspberries and less than 2 cups of strawberries. Made it for an elegant dinner party - not a crumb was left! Does anyone know if this is the same recipe as one published in the early 90's that called for peaches rather than berries?

Used strawberries and raspberry preserve. Heated the preserve before brushing gently. Did not use the Amaretto instead used one cup of almonds. Delicious!

This tart is really very good. I used a different pastry recipe (because I never use shortening) and poked it all over with a fork before adding the frangipane. I did need to cover the baking tart with foil. Filling an 11" circle nicely with strawberries is truly a daunting task, but once cut into slices, the presentation is fabulous!

Very light and fresh - and easy! And everyone was impressed by the beauty of this tart.

wonderful, makes you feel and look like a pastry chef. i used all strawberries and cooked for 30 minutes. i originally saw this on "cooking live" on the food network and cross- referenced to here, as it is a gourmet recipe. on the show sara moulten pierced the crust and increased the cooking time to 30-35 minutes, i don't know if you should pierce it or not, but it came out perfect, and i used at her suggestion, a refrigerated pie crust, this took 15 minutes to assemble. what a find!

This was excellent. I made it for Christmas dinner using all raspberries (it is raspberry season here in Australia) and everyone loved it. I think it needs to be made the day you plan on serving it as the crust was a bit soggy the next day, although still tasted good.

served this at a supper for 10 along with another dessert and this was the first to go. everyone loved it.

This recipe was excellent! I not only tried it with strawberries and raspberries but also with blueberries and blackberries as well as peaches and apricots. I even tried it with sliced watermelon and cantaloupe.....I wouldn't suggest you try it... it's not great. I've been making it since I found the recipie in my mother's magazine and my family LOVES it!!!

I have been making this recipe since it was published in 1991. As a time saver, you can use frozen puff pastry. It's a good idea to keep red currant jelly in the pantry to use on all fruits. As the fruits ripen, I have made this with strawberries,raspberries,apricots,peaches, plums, apples, & pineapple/coconut. Excellent!

While it was delicious, the crust seemed a bit underdone. Could this be my oven or have other people experienced this? Also, the directions are backwards. Do the second paragraph first, and don't forget to butter the pan.

This is a beautiful tart, and tastes delicious. Not at all difficult to make. I used all raspberries and it was fabulous.

This tart is easy and quick to make, but still is a great dessert. I must have made around a dozen times. I sometimes substitute the Amaretto for Kirsch and the strawberries for cherries, or Cognac and apricots, and is is still delicious.

A very tasty and easy tart to make. I made it for a Mother's Day reception, and the crowd loved it. Slicing the berries with an egg slicer makes the prep go even faster.

Easy, elegant, beautiful presentation and outstanding flavor combination of almond and fruit. The frangipane filling makes it distinctive and a superior tarte.
