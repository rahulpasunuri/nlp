For anyone who wants a more simple recipe the standard pate a choux ratio is 2:1:1:2. 2 parts liquid 1 part butter 1 part flour 2 parts eggs. Any liquid can be used, water, milk, a combination, fruit juices, stock (for savory applications consider using stock and folding in cheese or herbs to the dough before it is baked) coffee even. The standard baking temperature is 375 to 400. This allows the steam from the eggs to puff the dough and the outside to gain a nice color. Also, when adding the flour to the pot you should cook it until it forms a thin skin on the bottom of the pot. The point of cooking the flour is to help gelatinize some of the starches. The recipe says until it pulls away from the sides, but if you messed up and added too much flour it might do that immediately. A thin skin should coat the bottom of the pan before you transfer the dough to the mixer.

Excellent. Used this for cream puffs and all of them rose beautifully. The only change I would make to the recipe would be to include a little bit of sugar (maybe just a tablespoon)? These would even be really good on their own if a larger amount of sugar was added.

for anyone who is confused on the baking instructions for this recipe it is in logs or balls for 20 min at 350 DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN or it will cause them to fall. check after 20 by breaking one open. If they are still gooey on the inside continue to bake for another 5-7 min

This recipe made perfect cream puffs. I didn't change a thing and it baked up exactly as it says.

I saw this on the Food Network and it was made with milk. I used skim milk instead of water, 1 cup milk, 1 stick butter, 1 cup flour and just four eggs. I didn't have a pastry bag, so I just dropped them on parchment covered baking sheet. They turned out perfectly and were a big hit with my family.

In this instance, Epicurious did NOT goof. This is merely the recipe for the actual DOUGH that may be used for any number of other recipes, i.e. eclairs, cream puffs, profiteroles or gougeres. It was not meant to have the baking instructions. For baking instructions you would need to select a recipe for one of those four. You can then fill with sweet or savory fillings, dip in chocolate, caramel sauce, etc. A very useful and varied recipe that can be used for desserts and hors d'oeuvres.

Firstly, thanks to Todd for informing us where to find the baking directions. Epicurious made an oopsie! I halved the recipe using 3 eggs and yielded 13-3x2 eclairs. After transferring to the stand mixer make sure to run the mixer at medium speed for apprx. 2-3 minutes to release most of the steam and cool down the dough before adding the eggs. Eclairs rose very nicely and had the right amount of crispness. I filled with freshly whipped cream then dipped into chocolate ganache. Served with a side of fresh strawberries.

I made this recipe per the instructions and I must say that it was very raw. I might try it again but this time I may add my own twist and actually bake it.

I haven't made this yet, so I can't rate it. I would just like to comment that it would have been nice for baking instructions to be included in the recipe. I am going to have to look up another cream puff recipe to find the baking temp./times in order to use this recipe.

Dear California 12-14-99, perhaps you should cook it first.

It was okay but just not my favorite kind of dish.
