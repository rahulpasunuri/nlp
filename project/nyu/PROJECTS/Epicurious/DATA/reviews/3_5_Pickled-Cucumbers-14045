Outstanding! Used plain rice vinegar and added some finely sliced red onion. Cut the fresh mint from the garden.

Yum. This is just the recipe I was looking for to go with my IKEA meatballs! It's the perfect cucmber salad recipe. I'll definitely make again.

easy and very flavorful. a word of caution--others suggest using 'flavored' rice vinegar. be sure you know the flavor of what you're adding before you add it. we had a bad experience with flavored rice vinegar ;)

I took the suggestion of the previous reviewer and used "seasoned" rice vinegar and added a small onion which I sliced very thin. I omitted the mint and parsley only because I didn't have any in the house. This is very good. We all liked it.

A nice variation is to substitute rice wine vinegar, onion and sesame seeds. It is a great summer dish.
