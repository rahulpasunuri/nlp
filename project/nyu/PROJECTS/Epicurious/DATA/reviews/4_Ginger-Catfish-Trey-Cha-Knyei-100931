Made this once with the full amount of ginger, and found it too overpowering. Made it again with half the ginger and it was perfect. Second time I also omitted the onion, pepper and scallions and liked it better that way. I would also recommend cutting the catfish into larger pieces, otherwise it disintegrates. I did about 1-inch wide strips.

Very very yummy. I wanted to make it more of a one dish meal so added mushrooms, Chinese Kale, and Pad Thai noodles. I cut the fish in chunks and added it after everything else was almost done. I used about a cup or more of the ginger and was amazed that it was not overwhelming.

Delicious. The caramelized ginger was a revelation. Mine tasted a little bit salty--this may have been because I used regular soy sauce rather than mushroom soy sauce. When I make this again, I am also going to add a little lime juice at the end for a bit of vibrance.

I made this exactly as written and was disappointed. The catfish disintegrated into tiny pieces and the ginger, while pleasant and interesting at first, quickly became way too overpowering. There was just too much of it relative to the other ingredients. I will say that the sauce was delicious - I think I'll try this again using about 1/4 (or less) the amount of ginger and leaving the catfish whole.

Sorry to say this did not live up to expectations. The taste was really "one note," and the catfish fell apart, making an unattractive dish. The browned ginger, however, was fun by itself and I will be playing with it in other recipes.

Excellent dish that even a gourmet non-cook can whip together and enjoy. I now make it routinely, often with catfish nougats (the cheapest fish you can get) and still get compliments from guests. This is easy to make and, unlike many Asian dishes, all the ingredients are readily available in a small town.

I am not sure why my dish ended up tasting so 'raw fishy' in the end. I couldn't get past that to be able to enjoy the dish. I will attempt this next time either with tilapia (as recommended) or tofu (also recommended).

Great recipe. I followed it exactly and it came out great. It was really easy to make, too. I'd probably cut the ginger down to 1.5 cups instead. I also added 3 green Thai chilis (Bird's eye chili) to add some kick to it.

This is one of my family's favorite recipes (my teenagers love it). I add a full red pepper julienned and either a yellow or orange pepper, a can of straw mushrooms, and sometimes baby corn. Also - to save time, I buy catfish nuggets (instead of full fillets). Try it - it is really good!

This is so easy and so delicious! I recommend using he full amount of ginger. The pieces become carmelized and the oil becomes infused. Wonderful! I will make this again and again.

Not only is this easy to make, it's so good! I didn't have the mushroom soy sauce, so I just used the good old fashion stuff. I figured there would be enough bite with the ginger and onion, so I left out the scallions. Instead, I used cilantro and I really can't imagine this recipe without it! I also pureed the ginger instead of slicing it. And I only used about 1/4 CUP of ginger. It was plenty! Served over rice. My 3 year old inhaled it.

We have made this dish many times, and it is delicious. We have found that although the dish is fine with regular soy sauce, the mushroom soy sauce is really falvorful. And we like it best when the ginger is cooked until it's nice and crispy. We've served it to company, and it's been a big hit.

I love this dish. It is incredible. And when I have a cold, I want nothing but this or pho.

This is such an excellent way to prepare catfish. I use the full amount of ginger but just 2 Tbsp sugar plus the soy sauce and fish sauce (but no salt) even when I am making less fish. I leave the filets whole, just set them on top of the cooked ginger and turn with a spatula. Served this last night to my brother-in-law who catches catfish quite a lot and he said it didn't even taste like catfish! I followed other reviewers suggestions about peeling the ginger with the back of a spoon. Makes easy work of an otherwise tedious job.

Excellent dish - I've shared this recipe with so many friends and they all rave about it. I cut the sugar in half and use about a cup and a half of ginger. Perfect!

I really enjoyed the flavors. A little too sweet for me, I would recommend reducing the recipe to 2 tablespoons of sugar instead of 3.5.

Sooo good. I didn't use the red bell pepper or scallions, and instead I added baby corn. The sauce is what makes the recipe so good, so feel free to add whatever vegetables look good to you that day. I made this twice last week!

Unbelievable! The ginger had such a great kick (I happen to like ginger) and it was a hit with my 3 small children as long as they didn't have too much ginger per serving. Contrary to what others have noted, paring ginger with a knife or peeler is not nearly as quick or easy as the tip of a spoon. You have to make this!

I started this dish with a few handicaps. Husband who doesn't like fish, half the ginger called for, and fish sauce of unknown age. No matter. This stuff is absolutely fabulous and easy to prepare. As for skinning ginger--a carrot peeler works really well.

Rating: 3
this is absolutely delicious,but some changes need to be made:: 1. ginger: use all the ginger called for, but peel quickly (hold the ginger upright, scrape downward with the side of a knife) and throw it all in the food processor with some garlic and the chopped onion. saute this mixture all at once, then add the vegetables and finally the fish. my asian mother and grandmother start off almost every recipe this way, frying this mixture. 2. use only one tablespoon of sugar 3. you can cut down the initial oil if you use a non stick pan

Excellent. Made this tonight when Hubby backed down on dinner duty. Fantastic!! Only mod was using 2 tbsp of sugar rather than the full amount. Vegan mom made it as well w/tofu, Braggs instead of Fish sauce, 1 tbsp of brown sugar instead of white and no salt. Beleive it or not is still tasted amazing.

Rating: 4
Very flavorful and easy. I used tilapia fillets and instead of stir frying, I layed the fillets in a single layer and turned over just once. I then removed the fish before cooking the onion. I added the scallions then the sauce to the onions first and then added the fish fillets back to the pan to incorporate the sauce and turned over just once. The fish slices didn't break up. I only used about 1/3 cup ginger because that's all I had and I subsituted 1 tablespoon oyster sauce with 1 tablespoon soy sauce for the mushroom soy sauce. I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 tablespoons and it was just the right amount for me-sweet enough to balance out the fish sauce but not overpowering.

I've already reviewed this giving it four forks. I wanted to add a tip given to me by a friend on how to peel ginger. Use the back of a spoon by pulling at the ginger and the skin peels off so easily! If you were hesitant about making this dish because of the work involved- don't be. I tried this method today and it shaved a huge amount of time off making this delicious meal.

All that ginger really makes this dish. It seems like a lot but just go with it. I've tried it with catfish and tilapia and much prefer the later.

Rating: 4
This was outstanding. I cut the fish into larger strips and had no problem with it breaking apart. I also took the advice of others and removed the fish just before adding the onions so this may also have helped. I threw it back in just before serving. The 2 cups of ginger absolutely made this dish. I will make it again even though it is time consuming!

This was delicious. I did read previous reviewers remarks about the catfish breaking up, thus I didn't stir mine as much, and I didn't seem to have break-up problems. I also cut the fish pieces diagnolly into 1" pieces. I too was surprised by the ginger (I'm not fan), how it really made the dish. And it tasted very authentic Asian (and this is coming from someone who is Asian). It seemed a tad sweet though, next time I will add less sugar.

I agree with the previous poster that the catfish falls apart a bit in this, but it still *tastes* wonderful. You could easily substitute another protein. I added asparagus and mushrooms (cooked before the fish went in) and we thought it was a delightful one pan meal.

Rating: 2
This dish actually deserves better than 2 spoons, but here's why I didn't rate it higher: Catfish doesn't have the consistency to stand up in a stir-fry type dish and if cooked too long will break apart. I would, however, think that a different type of fish or shrimp, would make it better. As previous reviewers said, don't be intimidated by the seemingly large amount of ginger - it really gives the dish an authentic and delicious flavor. A good spring / summertime dish w/ a light sauce.

When my 17 year-old son saw the amount of ginger used in this recipe he moaned out loud about how much he hates ginger. When I served it up and forced him to try a bite, the rest is history. He, my 13 year-old son, and my wife had multiple helpings. I thought I'd made enough for two meals..NOT! This is an EXCELLENT recipe. Everyone is begging me to make it again!

This is absolutely delicious. The only problem was the the fish was cooked perfectly when I followed the receipe, but the veggies were too underdone. i ended up taking out the catfish and cooking the other ingredients for like 10 minutes more. This was magic! All the flavor really came out.

So good. Don't cut down the amount of ginger before you try it first. It does seem like a lot - but it cooks down quite a bit. I added in extra veggies - sugar snap peas, red and yellow pepper, asparagus etc. which added nice color and flavor.

I was tempted to make a lot of changes to the recipe because it seemed too simple to be as good as everyone says. I'm glad I didn't!!!!! I followed it almost exactly (with the exception of adding some shredded cabbage at the end to make it more a one dish meal and not having mushroom soy sauce, just regular) it was so simple and so good. I plan on making this one several times. I will get the mushroom soy sauce next time to see if it make a difference. ***For you fellow low-carbers - I used Splenda in place of sugar and it works great, you cannot tell the difference***

MMMMM - Oh...my....GOODNESS!! that's what one would have heard over & over again had they been in earshot of our dinner table last night. the ginger was divine, i'd never used so much or in this way before. the catfish held up for the most part. i used tricolored baby bell peppers, because i hate green ones, scallions - which were fabulous, and some wide rice noodles. these i soaked for 10 minutes, and then after removing the fish mixture, stir-fried in the wok in all the goodness left behind. i added a little olive oil over them as i stir fried, to loosen them up a bit. i wonder if all that initial oil used for frying makes this a very fatty dish. i used the full 5 tablespoons, but i wonder if it could be accomplished with less? the ginger gives it kick. i actually used a little asian chili-garlic sauce on the side, as i like my food very spicey. the flavors have it all - hot, sour, salty, sweet. delicious. i can't wait for lunch, when i'll heat up the leftovers!

Yum yum yum!!! I did cut back on the oil and the sugar. I also substituted tilapia for the catfish. Don't be afraid of the ginger. This was sooo good (and fast!)

Delicious, and flexible! I used thinly sliced carrots and quartered button mushrooms (instead of red pepper and green onions) since that is what I had. I didn't have mushroom soy sauce, so I used regular. I added some Chinese chili sauce, and when it was almost done, I added some softened rice noodles. Such an amazing flavor! I agree with an earlier comment that the catfish breaks down from too much stirring, but the flavor was still there.

I, nor my two boys are fond of catfish, but since my husband was cooking...It was awesome! Wonderful flavor with no fishy taste at all. My youngest son didn't believe it was fish and asked us to make it again. He's six and if he likes it and will eat it we we will make it again. My husband did not that the cutting up of the garlic was tedious, but definitely worth doing it correctly. A Keeper!

Followed the recipe except for the sugar. I did use a tablespoon, not sure it is needed. The recipe is great for your sinus. I also swapped pimento pepper for red pepper, because that is what I had. Now I need to find more recipes for the large bottle of mushroom soy sauce that I purchased.

This was delicious, and very simple to make. I used a full red pepper and added more soy sauce, but cut the sugar down to almost a third. I did add a Tbsp of chinese red chili sauce. I loved this dish, as did my boyfriend and our surprise dinner guest. I will definitely make this frequently. Seems like an easy recipe to adapt to just about any vegetable or fish. I highly recommend it.

This dish was quite flavorful. We used a whole bulb of ginger, which is key to giving the dish authenticity. It was a tad on the sweet side, so you could cut back some of the sugar. Be careful not to overcook it, otherwise the fish pieces start to fall apart. We really enjoyed this and will most likely cook it again.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe for those who love southeast Asian food. Fish sauce is one of those things that taste very different than it smells, and it adds different flavor when it is used in a dish than when you taste a bit of it on your finger straight from the bottle. I buy my ginger pureed in a jar (I find the flavor to be wonderful and easier than grating it- it also keeps well, but I never use jarred garlic because it tastes awful). Try this recipe using tilapia if it's on sale- I've never had a catfish dish that doesn't also work well with tilapia.

Rating: 2
I liked it, but my husband thought it was just okay. I minced the ginger b/c I just couldn't see eating a slice of it (plus it's much easier to just throw in the queez than to julienne it), maybe that's where I went wrong. I also didn't have mushroom soy sauce so I just used regular. The smell of the fish sauce almost caused me to throw the whole thing out but I kept going and was personally pleased with the results. But since my husband didn't like it, I probably won't make it again.

I am a caterer and cooked this recipe for my family before suggesting it to clients. It is delicious. I added red pepper and asparagus..didn't double the soy mixture (quite flavorful enough as is). I did saute catfish in full amount of ginger, removed it from pan and finished sauteing off the veggies. Added fish back to pan just to reheat and served it all over jasmine rice. What a wonderful addition to my files. Now if only I can get people in Ohio to eat Asian catfish..lol!

Great recipe. I used only 1/2 of the ginger (all I had on hand) and it had lot's of punch. I did remove the fish from the pan before adding the vegetables. Even so, it still was disintegrating somewhat. Next time, I will bake the fish separately and simply serve the remainder of the stir fry over the fish. This dish is very versatile - I think you can add vegetables as you see fit - I added extra red pepper and asparagus as others recommended. I served it to a friend who made it shortly after substituting tofu for fish for a large group. They loved it.

One of the best fishrecipes I ever cooked!! Wonderful taste of ginger and fish. Very easy and fast to prepare. I did not change anything of the recipe, because I think there is a reason for adding the vegetables at last - they should stay crispy. I served it with some basmati-rice. Really a keeper!!

Rating: 4
One of our favorites. Very flexible. I've added asparagus at times, red pepper at others and once added lots of different peppers, sweet and hot. Each time a bit different but always good. I also always add lots of slivered garlic which I sautee with the ginger, near the end of it's time.

I loved this recipe! Very flavorful even without all the ingredients. I had no onion or mushroom soy sauce. I only had 1/2 the amount of ginger called for and it was chopped (had chopped it for a previous recipe), and this was still just wonderful. Used plain ol soy sauce which I had, and some chives from my back yard instead of the scallions. I served this with rice which was perfect....the sauce is a natural with the rice. My 11 year old and her friend loved this. In fact as my daughter was taking her first bite she said "mmmm can you make this again tomorrow?" Very, very easy and quick to make too!

After chopping all the vegetables, I found out that my ginger is bad so I used garlic instead and it came out wonderful. Another thing I did differently is that I mixed the catfish with some cornstarch and cooking wine, stir fried the fish first, set it aside then stir fried the veggies and mixed in the fish at the end. It came out really good. Since the fish has some cornstarch on it, the sauce kinda coats the fish and makes it really tasty. This recipe is a keeper and next time I will use the ginger.

This dish has a little extra preparation time but is well worth it. For the less adventuresome, a little less ginger and regular soy sauce make it a little more tame. Serve over cellophane noodles (no extra cooking required after all that chopping - just soak in hot water) and yum!

yummy and very easy, if you can be zen about the ginger slicin'. its officially on the dinner repertoire. the things i changed: used rock cod and added it after the veggies were sauteed, not so much sugar, added several sliced green chillies with the ginger, and sauteed a little thai chili paste before adding the liquids. i like it spicy :)

This recipe is excellent! It has become one of our favorites and is very easy to put together. I don't much care for catfish so I use any firm, mild fish such as cod or sea bass. I also double the sauce ingredients as I like lots of sauce over rice. The asparagus and julienned red bell peppers were an excellent suggestion. Do use a lot of ginger -- it generates wonderful heat!

Rating: 1
After reading the reviews I was really excited about making this recipe. I love catfish, and thought this recipe kills the flavor of such a mild fish. I would use shimp if I were to make it again - which I'm not. Also, it requires to much work (the ginger) for such a so-so recipe.

Rating: 4
Bravo! This recipe was fabulous!! I used all of the ginger, and threw in more red bell peppers and the asparagus that was suggested. I also added the fish at the end. Do use a little less sugar, though. The end result was superb, with my boyfriend exclaiming, "Catfish never tasted so good!) I served this with a sesame-ginger couscous with sugar snap peas and mushroom slices. I finished with a ginger peach crumble (3 cups fresh peach slices in an 8" square dish with 2 tbsp. brown sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 1 tbsp of lemon juice sprinkled over peaches. Top with 1/2 cup crumbled gingersnaps. Bake for 20 minutes at 450 degrees. Serve with healthy choice Praline Caramel Cluster low-fat ice cream. Very low-fat and complimentary to the meal!)

the elephant walk is one of my favorite restaurants and this dish reflects its cuisine well. although i am a ginger lover, i cut back on the ginger by more than 1/2 -- but the flavor mellowed more than i thought and i would be less timid with it next time. i added some asparagus for extra crunch/color and it was fantastic served over brown basmati rice. a definite repeat. watch out for the disintegrating catfish -- i may try removing it after cooking it and adding it back at the end.

Rating: 3
Delicious and different!!! To "improve" the recipe, I added asparagus (1/4 inch diagonal cut pieces)at the same time as the red pepper. The first time I made it the fish "distinegrated" into bits. The second time I tried it I added the fish *after* most of the veggies and had much better results. Do use lots of ginger!
