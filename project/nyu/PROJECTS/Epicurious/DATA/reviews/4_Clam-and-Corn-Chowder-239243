Omigosh, Yum! I tried this recipe, because corn is in season, and I had five fresh cobs. I changed a few things: because I didn't use bacon, I added/sauteed 1/2 diced onion, 1 minced celery, and a few ounces of shelled lobster. I also added a small amount of cayenne, and a dollop of white wine! My grocery store didn't have fresh clams, so I used several cans of whole clams. I served in heated sourdough bowls, with a small piece of lobster on top! I'm not usually this fancy, but Wow!

This was tasty and easy to make. I did use frozen corn as well as mini new potatoes (that needed dicing but not peeling), which cut the labor a bit. Added about 1/2 tsp. dried thyme leaves, a similar quantity of dried chiles, and some minced parsley at the end. I used 2% milk and creamo (10%) rather than the called for homo milk and heavy cream (had them left over from a brunch) and result was fine. A wonderful Friday night meal with some crusty bread.

This chowder is worth digging your own clams for. Great as written but awesome with a few extra clams.

Great recipe. I only changed it a bit. I added extra piece of bacon and once it was slightly browned added a half of red bell pepper diced small. I did not add the corn (used frozen) with the potato as others had advised. I also only used aprox 3/4 lb potato. Once the clams opened up i added the corn. I did take all the clams out of the shells (didn't take too long). I like my soup a bit thicker so i added some corn starch to white wine and added that. The white wine (sav blanc) added another layer which was really great! I did a a bit of red pepper flakes per other reviews. Soup was yummy! Served with sliced toasted baguette that I broiled with a bit of olive oil.

I have made this three times. I don't make any changes, except I halve it because there are only two of us. Plus, two bottles of clam juice is sorta expensive. (Another reviewer uses fish stock-may be less expensive.) But, this is DELICIOUS! I am going to make it Friday with frozen corn from last summer. :)

This is absolutely delicious. It tastes even better served in carved sour dough bread.

I've probably made this a dozen time since the recipe came out in '07. It's definately a staple during the summer months. I use the frozen clams that they sell at Costco which are very tasty even on their own. I've used fresh and frozen corn and don't really notice a difference between the two. I also a some red pepper flakes to kick it up a notch.

Beachgirl--thanks for the turkey bacon idea! I will definitely try that and never would have thought of it... I don't eat red meat but usually end up feeding a lot of carnivores who would have missed the smokey/meaty element!

This was excellent! Very filling which is good because I had leftovers. I used frozen corn and 2 lbs littleneck clams plus a can of clams. I also used a little more pepper...a little more than 1/2 a tsp. And I used Turkey Bacon which I thought was just as good. I will definately make this again!

Awesome chowder. it's so simple, yet flavorful. Definitely one of my favorite dishes and everyone loves it when I make it.

Time of year and laziness dictated my use of canned clams and frozen corn but it still received rave reviews from both my husband and my three year old.

I really enjoy chowder that is not thick - this recipe is just perfect - I usually up the clams - and depending on the guests - I take the clame out of the shells!

I cheated - used canned clams and frozen corn. But it was still really realy good.

Delicious and easy to make. I've made it twice, substituting fish stock for the clam juice. I also threw in a bay leaf and fresh herbs from the garden. The second time I made it, I used onion, chives, and garlic instead of the scallions. I also used leftover cooked corn on the cob. I imagine you could substitute frozen corn if your in a hurry, but I think the fresh really made a difference. (Sorry if this appears twice. When I hit edit from the preview button, put me in the reviews page and so I don't know if the first entry stuck or got lost in cyberspace.)

This was great - quick, easy and delicious. I didn't use whole clams, but instead used canned so I would be able to have leftovers (which were fantastic). I think the whole clams would be nice for presentation - but the canned worked well too.

This was the first time I had a recipe turn out like the picture. This was delicious and for little effort and ingredients. I halved the recipe for two but kept the clams to a whole pound. I let the potatoes simmer a bit longer before adding the clams as well as tossed in a fresh bay leaf just because. I also had roasted corn from earlier in the week, but I don't think it made a huge difference. Elegant enough to serve to company. Looking forward to the next time I make it again.

Good, but not stellar. I added thyme to cut the blandness of the original and I agree that this is not a quick meal. I've had better chowders from Gourmet.

This was terrific. Although it's category is "quick" wouldn't buy into that. Cutting the corn, washing and chopping scallions and peeling and cubing potatoes, unless one has staff becomes quite time consuming. End result worth the effort. I did however find it needs some heat when served. So a blob of favorite hot sauce won't hurt.

Simple and delicious, I made exactly as written, my whole family loved iit, definite keeper. I removed the shells once the soup was finished, easier to eat that way. Served with crusty bread. Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow.

great, simple, and tasty. i added a little more bacon, and added the corn a little later (i wanted to cook the potatoes more, but just barely cook the corn), and the whole thing turned out fresh and light.

I think this soup is excellent and I will definitely make it again. It was very easy and quick and really has a nice flavor to it. No hard to find ingredients either. I have eaten this as leftovers for the past two night and enjoyed it every time.

Really delicious. Great farmers' market dinner. Nice clean flavors. Made this recipe as written.
