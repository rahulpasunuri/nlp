Thanks for changing and adding the kale!

What am I missing? I'm not seeing kale in the recipe!

Wow, I wasn't expecting just a rub of garlic to pack that much punch! It's fantastic! I just made this and the soup, and my husband just ate all the toasts and a bowl of soup each. My husband isn't a big fan of vegetarian food but he loved this. A vegan version with nutritional yeast subbing for the parmesan would be just as good.

This recipe is delicious and healthy, and it only gets better as it sits. I didn't change the recipe and I thought the spice was perfect. It makes a lot so be prepared for leftovers. I plan to turn the remnants into soup.
