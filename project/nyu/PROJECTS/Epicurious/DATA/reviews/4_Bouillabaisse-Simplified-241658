Fabulous and easy. I made this with what was on sale and available at my local Whole Foods including swordfish, salmon and littleneck clams... I used good quality purchased fish stock and vegetable stock, and quality canned tomatoes and Spanish saffron from penzeys.com. It turned out wonderful with just a pinch of sea salt and a few grinds of pepper at the end. Really didn't need a lot of tweaking... I would definitely make it again. Total keeper.

Great Recipe! I made it for 6 including two bouillabaisse "snobs" and they thought it was fantastic! Most of the recipes called for making stock from fish heads or fish bones - forget that!! I recommend adding a lot more garlic - I used 4 cloves and it could have handled more. The rouille is a must and gave it great flavor and a little 'kick'. I used 1 carton of seafood stock and 1 carton of vegetable stock, but took care to taste and adjust seasoning at the end. Easy and outstanding!

This recipe is a feast for the eyes, nose, and taste buds! I only used cod and prawns, and replaced the seafood stock with vegetable bouillon cubes. I topped it with a hearty bread and homemade rouille (which was also fantastic). My husband was very impressed, and we both enjoyed the dish thoroughly.

very simple and delicious. used canned crab stock from the chinese market -- seafood stock is actually pretty difficult to find in regular supermarkets. came out wonderful anyway.

Very good for my taste.. Might be a little fishy for some. Would recommend using half seafood stock and half chicken stock.. Also added some cajun season for some jazz..

de-li-cious!!! i will make this again & again & again! if your soup comes out bland, it's your own fault. soups are the easiest thing to taste & adjust; not to mention a touch of salt can bring out so much flavor. it also helps to season the seafood before adding it to the soup. you must add more garlic. i did 5 gigantic cloves; i love the stuff. i also double the tomatoes & used diced instead of whole; it just made more sense. a little red pepper gives a nice kick. i cooked soup for 10 min instead of 20 (i didn't have much clam juice), i still made 6 servings and it was full of flavor. can't wait for the left overs tomorrow!!

This recipe came out beautiful to the eye, incredibly aromatic, and was absolutely delicious! I used wild caught Halibut, Scallops, and Jumbo shrimp. I couldn't imagine this dish without the saffron, and yes by all means soak it in the orange juice. The orange I used to grate for zest I also squeezed for the juice. I added about a cup and a half of a nice French Sauvignon Blanc at the beginning for some extra flavor, I highly recommend. Whole Foods has amazing fish stock, just ask at the fish department. Along side I baked parmesan garlic bread on a half loaf of sourdough bread. Was an amazing meal! Enjoy...

I made this recipe last night with tilapia and frozen shrimp. it was super easy to make, and really delicious, even with the frozen seafood! I will definitely make it again!

This is a good starter recipe, but turned out blander than I would've liked. Next time, I'll use much more garlic, fresh basil, and red pepper flakes.

Made this for dinner tonight - an absolute hit!! Had a few changes since fennel was outrageously expensive, but overall an easy recipe that should be repeated multiple times!

I wasn't very impressed. It's easy to make, but it wasn't that great. I made the rouille too and that made it a little more exciting.

delicious, both myself & my husband loved it (even if he is more of a "meat" guy). Made just as written, using 250gm cod, 8 shrimp (16-20 size) and 6 sea scallops...very filling! Compared with other similar recipes on this site, this wouldn't be my favorite...prefer the others that don't include tomatoes (as does my husb). Still, makes a lovely and healthy dinner.

Was concerned about the fennel originally, but it added to the dish. It was a bit bland but perked up nicely with the addition of some spices, including a seafood blend featuring dried lemon peel, green peppercorns, and some additional salt and pepper. Used a generous portion of saffron to positive effect. Will definitely be making this "easy" version of this complex soup again.

Very tasty and easy. Added red pepper flakes for a little kick.
