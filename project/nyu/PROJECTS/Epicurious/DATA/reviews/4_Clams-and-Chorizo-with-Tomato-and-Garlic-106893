This was excellent and easy. We did add more white wine to it to make more broth (essential). The only thing I would do differently is also add some olive oil or butter to the wine. The resulting broth was a little too thin and watery.

SO easy to make, and really fantastic! Good bread is the key...

We added some white wine and water to make this a bit more brothy for the crusty bread. Really tasty.

I added some shrimp, scallops, cut up squid, about 3/4 cup chicken broth, & a splash of whiskey. This was so delicious! I don't think you can go wrong with this simple reciple even if you fiddle around with it. Be careful not to increase amount of chorizo as the strong flavor can overpower. This was so good I could not believe that I had cooked it! Enjoy!

Awesome. Didn't change anything. Made for a dinner party and it was absolutely delicious. Serve with some French bread and you'll be very pleased. Very easy and quick, outstanding flavor.

Yum yum! My husband came home with some chorizo one day. I found this recipe on the site and had him make it(he is not a cook)and it came out perfect! Crusty bread a must!

This dish was RIDICULOUSLY good given how extremely simple it is to make (i was a bit skeptical). I am embarassed to admit, i actually used turkey kulbasa (in place of chorizo) in an attempt to lower the fat and it was still great. I also used mahogany clams - i'm sure any fresh clams would be equally as good.

This dish was quick and delicious. I doubled the chorizo, cut the oil and am looking forward to making it again.

Very good! Serve this quick and easy "stew" with crusty bread for a satisfying and comforting meal. Make sure to use stewed tomatoes that are not seasoned. My family loved this so I'll definitely be making this again!

Very good. I used Italian Style stewed tomatos. Clams are rare around here. We have a lot of Gulf Coast oysters. Very tastey. Wll certainley have this recipe again.
