Delicious! Although I have to say I modified quite a bit. I used 1 cup pastry wheat flour, 1 cup of fresh almond meal (left over from almond milk I'd made), 1/4 cup amaranth flour and 1/4 cup flax seed flour. I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup melted butter. I used an artisan cane sugar syrup that reminded me of a light molasses....I sprinkled dark brown sugar in there too ;) Lastly I chopped fresh ginger finely and added 1/3 cup of chopped candied ginger and golden raisins. This was a fun recipe to play with...turned out delicious!

Excellent! It came out great even though I didn't follow the recipe precisely. I put some oats in the food processor to substitute oat flour for bran flour, didn't cook the prunes and didn't use any ginger juice. I'm sure that the fresh ginger juice would make it even better, but it's still delicious. It was fairly oily, so I'd recommend cutting the oil down some. Definitely recommend this Tea Bread... Thank you Judith:)
