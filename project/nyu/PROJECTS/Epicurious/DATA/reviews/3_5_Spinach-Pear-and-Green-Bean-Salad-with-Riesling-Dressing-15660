I have made this salad before a few years ago and forgot that it was in my recipe folder. Very good salad and the dressing is delicious. I love the crunch of the green beans and the walnuts. I left out the cheese this time - my dinner was heavy and I wanted a lighter salad. I've made it before with goat cheese ( a guest didn't like blue cheese) and it was very good.

I normally don't like anything sweet in my salads but this salad is so perfectly balanced. It's just delicious and fresh!

I really liked this salad - light, flavorful. Adding salt and pepper to the dressing before tossing is key to bringing out the flavor of the dressing. Also, you really need the blue cheese and walnuts to round out the flavor and texture. Will definitely serve this at my next dinner party!

Made this last fall and it was good- the dressing lacked punch I thought. I doubled the recipe and there was far too much dressing leftover. I will tinker with the dressing next time, great materials in the salad!

This is a delicious recipe and a stand-by for dinner parties in our house. It's always a hit with guests with or without the beans. Seasoning the dressing with salt and pepper really brings out the flavor. I could drink it straight!

This was so delicious! I made it as part of a light Christmas Eve dinner with a glazed ham, and it was perfect. I made it again last night, using endive instead of spinach. It was the same batch of dressing, and it tasted even better a couple of days later.

This recipe is fabulous! I used mixed organic greens and a Cabernet Franc icewine since I didn't have any riesling. I tried it out at a dinner party - good thing I made lots because every single person had seconds!

Excellent salad. I added blanched cranberries for both color and a little kick of tartness to balance the sweetness of all that pear.

This salad is amazing! I omitted the green beans for a dinner party and everybody raved about it. It was a runaway hit!

Was really disappointed in this recipe, especially after making a special trip to get the wine. Would not make it again.

Once it's all tossed together, this salad is amazing! Everybody loved it.

What a delicious salad! The dressing is gorgeous -- be sure to use a good riesling, as the flavor will depend hugely on your choice of wine. The pears, blue cheese and walnuts marry beautifully with the spinach and green beans. I followed this recipe precisely (which is something I rarely do) and was delighted by the outcome.

We made this for Christmas Eve dinner - my Dad, who *hates* both green beans and blue cheese raved about it all Christmas Eve and then into Christmas... The green beans, in my honest opinion, are necessary (even though they do kind of get lost in the spinach) - they add texture. We've made this more than once and will be making it again. I agree, by the way, that any kind of pears work - we couldn't get Bartlett, so we used Anjou.

This is my favorite salad. It is such a wonderful winter delight. I love the reisling dressing - the crucial step is having the pureed pears... As for everything else: any kind of pears work, and pecans make for a successful substitution. Also pretty with some dried cranberries tossed in.

This gets a rare 4 stars from me - it was just terrific. I made it exactly according to the recipe and would change nothing. Do use a real riesling. Do use real French roquefort. Do toast the walnuts. And if you can get the fine, thin French "haricot verts" they really make a difference. A perfect supper with some good bread (and the rest of the riesling!)

Altered a bit, to handle my client - sliced and grilled the pears, omitted the beans, used hazelnuts rather than walnuts, topped salad with paper thin slices of good quality Brie. Wonderful!

I made only a few changes in this recipe. I candied the walnuts and since I made it for July 4th, I added stawberries and blue berries to have red, white & blue. I used 1/2 vegetable and 1/2 olive oil. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be delicious.

We rarely have a bottle of Reisling, so I substituted Champagne/Sparkling Wine and added just a touch of powdered sugar for sweetness. I have served it several times and nearly everyone has enjoyed it.

This recipe is fabulous! I am asked to make it each year at Thanksgiving, no matter whom is hosting. I highly recommend it. You can get away without the green beans too. It is great either way.

I used a combo of baby spinach and field greens, omitting the green beans. I felt the dressing needed something too, so I added two tablespoons of honey - it did the trick. I served it to a group and received good reviews.

I was really not impressed with this salad at all. It just didn't seem to have much zing to it, there's nothing special about it. After blending the dressing, it didn't taste like pear or wine, the flavors got lost somewhere. Let me know if you find them.

This is a delicious combination, particularly with the bagged baby spinach which is now readily available. I did think that the dressing was a bit wimpy and needed more lemon juice than the recipe stated. I used a good quality grapeseed oil, which worked beautifully.

I have gotten many requests for this recipe. I substituted a mixture of baby greens and baby spinach for the spinach only called for in the recipe. I also omitted the green beans. When I served this for a large crowd (50), I tossed the bleu cheese and walnuts along with the rest of the ingredients, rather than sprinkling them on each individual serving.

I just made this for the second time forgetting that I had made it last December for guests. It is a good recipe however there are a lot of salad recipes with the greens, blue cheese, and fruit theme. This was not one of the best. I did like the addition of the green bean but they got lost in the spinach.

This was a wonderful salad. I enjoyed it thoroughly, even though I served it after the main course on Thanksgiving when everyone's eyes were starting to glaze over. I was really happy to have some of the dressing left over to enjoy again later. Best way to use a mediocre Reisling you could ask for.

I thought that this was a excellent recipe. However, I thought that the dressing needed a little more zip to it. Next time I make it (which will be tomorrow) I will add more mustard. Anyone have another idea for adding just a bit more flavor?
