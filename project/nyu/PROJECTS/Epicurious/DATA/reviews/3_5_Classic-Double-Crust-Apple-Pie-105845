This pie tasted good, but the timing was way off; I only baked it for about 75 min., and the apples were mushy. At 2 hours it would have been applesauce in a crust. I used half Golden Delicious and half Granny Smiths. I suppose I would make it again, adjusting the time.

quite good. I doubled the cinnamon and lemon, and mine needed only an hour in the oven. a little sweet for me but the bf declared it "his perfect apple pie" - so it's a winner.

My 14yr old son Kevin&I made this pie for the 1st time. Super easy & yummy. We used 4 med size granny smiths & 4 med gala apples. Added 2 extra tablespoons of flour to the filling along with a dash of nutmeg and cloves. Baked for 45 mins at 400 then covered with foil continued baking 15 mins at 350. Happy Thanksgiving!

I didn't read the review before I made this pie. I cooked it for 90 minutes and it was WAY too long. The pie is very mushy. Also, I had a problem with the crust. Next time I will make my favorite spiced apple pie.

My review will not reflect on the crust recipe. I always have problems making pie crusts. As to the filling, it was very tasty, but I would strongly recommend sweating the apples first to remove some of the juices. My filling was ridiculously liquidy. Mix the apple slices with the sugar only and let sit in a collander over a bowl for about an hour. Then mix in all the rest of the filling ingredients. The "sweat" you collected in the bowl you can either reduce to make syrup or discard.

two criticisms: the crust recipe should be using lard, not shortening; the applies should be a combination of Mac's and Granny Smith

Rating: 3
Like many other reviewers, I used a different recipe for the crust (one of my mom's that I still struggle to perfect...) but the filling was wonderful. I used Gala and Granny Smith apples, added a tad more cinnamon, and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar with 1 tablespoon of maple syrup rather than the 3/4 indicated in the recipe. I'm very glad I read the reviews prior to baking however, because 70 minutes was plenty of time. Any more and I would have had applesauce.

This was my first apple pie and it came out very good. I used Macs and Honey Crisps. Did not want to mess with making crusts, so I used the pre-made. Ramped up the spices a bit, and added all spice. I forgot to add the flour to the apples, but they still came out perfectly cooked after 1 hr. and 15 minutes in the oven. The texture was light and moist, very flavorful with the spices. The top crust came out really good too.

Very good. Better than winging it like I normally do. Proportion of sugar, cinnamon etc. accurate. The vanilla, gives it a rich flavor. One hour is plenty in the oven, even though I overstuffed the crust with apples.

??????????? This is the first recipe I've made from epi that failed entirely on me. I put it in the oven before running out to the store and gave instructions to my poor mother to check it in an hour. Four voicemails and one text message later (I left the phone in my car), I have a pie with a burned top that isn't cooked through on the bottom. I'm currently attempting to save it by putting it back in the oven with a tinfoil tent on it. We shall see. So far, the kid's been a complete bomb for me.

Oh, this recipe rocks! Did what everyone said... cooked for 70 min., little extra flour... Generously buttered (no Pam) and floured the dish which excellently rounded out the taste in the crust, every bite.

This is a really good apple pie recipe. I did as reviewers suggested and added 2 extra tablespoons of flour and only cooked it for an hour. I used my own favorite pie crust recipe. I used a combination of Golden Delicious, Grannysmith and a third apple variety. The pie was very good. Lots of tender apples piled high in a flakey crust. Just what you want in an apple pie.

Rating: 4
This was my first attempt at an apple pie and I must say it went over very well. I used the flaky pie crust as others had suggested as well as only baked it for 1 hour and 10 min. I used granny smith's and Macintosh apples and they were perfect! Fork tender, but still a nice light crunch when eaten. I added a bit more flour than called for, and there was still quite a bit of juice. Will Definitely make this pie again!

I used the frozen pastry sheet. The pie turned out good except that the apple is really mushy. I baked for 1 hour and 10 mins as others suggested. I used half granny smith and half gold delicious. I cut one apple into 10 slices. Is this too thin? Is this why the apples became mushy? Some good tips will be much appreciated.

Beware the recommended cooking time! I baked this pie for Thanksgiving dinner for 2 hours as recommended and it tasted like applesauce in a crust - so embarrassing. I've made this pie before, cooking it for less time, and it was excellent.

Followed the advice of others and used the recipe for the flaky crust on the site. My apple pie aficionados raved about this pie the entire Thanksgiving weekend. There were a lot of pouty lips when I served up the last pieces of this. My apples were very juicy & I used 2 lbs ea Golden & Granny--I added a 2 tblspns more flour at the end. The pie was 4" tall & looked fab with turbinado instead of regular sugar sprinkled on top.

Excellent basic apple pie. I used half Granny Smith, half Goldens. Cut the sugar back a little, to a scant 2/3 measure (I like it less sweet than some), and added some nutmeg with the cinnamon to the fruit. I also used 2 TB of flour in the fruit, and had no trouble with extra liquid. Based on the recommendation of several, I used the flaky pie crust recipe (BA, 2000) elsewhere on this site--great crust. Biggest thing--this pie took me about 70 minutes, not 2 hours, at 5300 feet altitude. The texture of the fruit was perfect at that point, IMO--still see distinct slices, but fully cooked and succulent. I brushed the crust with egg/milk to make it shiny, instead of just milk, but that is just an aesthetic preference.

To preface, I'm a fairly experienced pie maker. I gave this recipe 3 stars because my husband has sworn to finish the whole pie by himself in one night, he likes it so much, whereas I couldn't stand how cloyingly sweet it was. The flavor potential was there, but I would cut the sugar in half next time (and use more tart apples) and add more lemon juice. Also, I cooked the pie almost the full two hours and let it cool for one hour, and I ended up with crusty apple soup. Would add 1/4 cup flour to filling next time as well. Don't know about this recipe's crust, as I used the flaky pie crust recipe from this site (best crust I've ever made, by the way).

I haven't made an apple pie in about 20 years, but made this recipe with great success! I used Pillsbury crusts (cheating, but everyone loved it nonetheless). The filling was divine. I used brown sugar instead of white, and on a whim I added 1/4 tsp almond extract which gave it a sort of apple pastry flavor - very subtle but very special. I only baked it for 1 hour and that was perfect. I'll be making this pie often! (Next time I'll try making the crust.)

Rating: 0
This is the worst crust recipe, I've ever worked with. It is simultaneously sticky and brittle. The pie is in the oven so the word is still out on the taste. I consider myself a pretty accomplished baker and have in the past used only crisco for the crust. I intend to go back to that method in future.

Great classic recipe. I used McIntosh & Gala, added a tablespoon extra flour to the apples, baked for one hour. Also used the flaky crust recipe from this site (Bon Appetit 6/2000) based on previous reviews. Delicious!

I made this pie yesterday. I followed the filling recipe exactly, but used the flaky crust recipe from this website (the one with the apple cider vinegar). I used half granny smith apples, half golden delicious apples. I didn't put the sugar/cinnamon on top of the crust either. I followed the advice of others and baked it for an hour, which was perfect. The apples were tender yet still held their shape. Not mushy at all. Everyone LOVED this pie. The filling was perfect - not too sweet, not too tart. The flaky crust recipe paired with this filling will become my go-to apple pie recipe. I can't wait to make it again for Thanksgiving.

Made this last night for Father's Day and it came out so well. It was my first pie ever so I was a bit nervous, but I was so pleased with the finished product. Because of the mixed reviews about the crust, I didn't dare try it (use one from an old issue of FOOD magazine). There was a lot of juice though. Not sure if it's because I didn't let the pie cool long enough before diving in, or because I didn't add enough flour. If someone can respond that'd be great. Still a fantastic recipe and I will be making it again but just add more flour. Oh, I used granny smith apples and added a pinch of nutmeg. To echo other comments, one hour in the oven is just right!

Rating: 4
Very good recipe. Huge hit at Christmas. It really does make an oversized pie - easily serves 10. I used all Granny Smith apples as my gang all likes more tart than sweet. A friend who is a pastry chef once told me that Granny Smiths are one of the best for pies, I had always used Spys previously - still do when in season as they are a classic Ontario apple available in the fall, early winter in Canada. The only change I made was to cut back a little on the sugar and to use an egg white wash on the bottom of the pie crust to ensure it didn't get soggy. Served with some good extra old cheddar - perfect.

This was an amazing apple pie recipe!! The filling is just perfect--used half Golden Delicious and half Granny Smith apples, added in 2 tbsp lemon juice instead of just one, and also added in some nutmeg...Also, as others have mentioned the cooking time is too long, baked mine for an hour at 350, then at 375 for the last 10 min., and it was perfect. Also, make sure and put either a cookie sheet under the pie or line oven to catch the juices that will spill from pie! The crust was too crumbly and powdery so I will probably use another, but I did notice that the longer it was out of fridge the harder it was to work with, so I would definitely chill it more than an hour or overnight to make it easier to roll out...The filling was perfect though, not too sweet, not soupy at all!

Excellent recipe with great crumbly crust. Modified it slightly by using 2 1/2 sticks of butter instead of shortening + butter, adding 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, 1 tablespoon cointreau liqueur, and grating guyere cheese onto the crust for a little sophisticated punch.

I've made this pie several times and it is the best apple pie I have made, everyone raved about!

I have made many an apple pie from more than a few different recipes trying to find the perfect flavor but I have to say this is the best.

I made a few changes to the recipe -- mixed 1/2 cup light brown sugar with 1/4 granulated sugar. I also used 2 tsp of lemon juic. I didn't spray my pan as suggested and the crust stuck to the bottom from the sugary juices. I'll spray next time!

I baked the pie as the recipe called for but the time I cut short by 30 minutes and it was overcooked. For my taste I would add more sugar or use sweeter apples rather than a combination of sweet and tart. The baking time was WAY TOO long. Even an hour and a half was too long. Maybe just one hour. My elevation here is 6300 feet, would that make the difference?

Also, I reduced the cinnamon, added nutmeg, and used 2 large jonagold apples and 3/4 of a large braeburn. My sister said that the filling was a bit wet, but I thought it was lovelly! I baked for one hour only and the apples were perfectly tender. ItThe pie was a hit!

I made a double of this recipe tonight; I have high hopes for the quality of the pies [they're still in the oven!] but I figured I would mention that THEY OOZE! They leak a sugary juice, and it took maybe half an hour for me to realize [or should I say, for lots of smoke to start pouring out of the oven..] so my boyfriend and I just spent 10 minutes scraping the charred carmelized sugar off the bottom of the oven. Here's a tip: put tin foil on the bottom of your oven before you preheat it. We couldn't do that because obviously the oven was too hot, so we placed two small cookie sheets on the rack below the pies; it will probably take longer for them to bake, however, I'm happy that my whole oven [and my bake sale pies!] are not up in flames at this very moment. :) One other thing: the crust was ridiculous to work with, and I felt like it wasn't quite enough to make the full top crusts.

I made this dish last night actually, after apple picking earlier in the week. I have to say i made another apple pie from the recipe on the pie crust box and it was very good, but this one just had something extra and i liked the fact that there was flour in the mix with the apples to thicken it up. The last recipe didn't have that. I really liked this and i especially loved the tip about brushing the milk on the top and adding the sugar and cinnamon, very good !

The crust was the best part of this recipe. Nice and flaky. In many of the reviews there were comments on bake time, and mushy consistency of apples.

Wonderful! I only used Granny Smith apples however because I was concerned that using sweeter apples would turn the filling into mush. I only baked it exactly one hour--any more time would have been way too long. The crust was a little difficult to work with (crumbly) but after seeing it baked and TASTING it --WOW!! Really worth the frustration--extremely flaky and not soggy. I did however add 2 tbsp of sugar to the dough. I also added a sprinkle of nutmeg to the filling. It wasn't soupy at all like some apple pies tend to be. Terrific pie!

I cut my apples thick so they wouldnt turn to mush. It worked, but I only baked it about 1 hr an30 min. If I had cooked them longer, they would have been applesauce. But, my crust just never cooked. This is my second try at this one, I quit. There are many more apple pie recipes to try.

I'd give this 4 forks with my inclusions, three otherwise simply because I like my pies with these changes: I macerated some raisins and dried cranberries in some golden rum (1 tbsp?) until plump, added more cinnamon and some chopped toasted walnuts, and varied the apples (grannies, cameo, macs) in the filling. I also added 2 tbsp sugar to the pie pastry. This was a superb pie!

Given the previous rave reviews, I must have done something terribly wrong here, but I have to say this pie was a big disappointment. I decided to try this pie crust rather than use my tried-and-true recipe (from Bon Appetite, the Apple & Dried Cranberry Pie available on this site) and this was a mess. I couldn't get the right balance between flour and water so it crumbled to pieces. The final result was tender and flaky but tasteless - maybe I just prefer all butter crusts. Also, the tart apples overpowered the sweet, though, again, this might just be a taste issue. Either way, I don't think I'll be giving this one another shot.

I didn't have shortening so I used all butter. I also used whatever apples I had at home which was mostly golden delicious, a few red delicious, and one or 2 granny smith. This came out so well. It was the first pie I have ever made and it was very very good. One thing that I did that was key was when I rolled out the dough I put it between large sheets of plastic wrap with a little flour sprinkled on them. It was super easy to roll it out this way, and also easy to put in and take out of the refridgerator. I would make this again and again. It was wonderful.

Although I didn't make this recipe, here's a great tip I learned at cooking school for pie crusts: Roll out the chilled pie crust (don't skimp on the resting time either) between two large pieces of plastic wrap. This way, you don't have to add a lot of flour to the dough as you roll it out (which toughens it) and it is much easier to transfer to the pie pan. It also makes it much easier to roll out as you can turn the pie crust 90 degrees to ensure an even crust.

I thought that 2 hour cooking time must be a typo. I cooked mine 1 1/2 hours and that was more than enough. I got rave reviews on this recipe. Two winning points - the crust was fabulous and flakey and was not soaked with apple juice. Letting the apples with the sugar, etc sit and draining the accumulated drippings before putting them in the pieshell was inspired. Great taste, great crust - fabulous.

I used my own pie crust recipe, so I cannot comment on that portion of the recipe, but I agree with the other assessments -- don't bake the pie two hours because the apples will turn to mush. Surely the two-hour bake time has to be a typo. I baked it 1 1/2 hours and the apples were still too soft. I suggest using a skewer to test for apple tenderness after about 50 minutes and then check every ten minutes. As for the flavor, overall it is very good. I made some warm cinnamon sauce to top the pie.
