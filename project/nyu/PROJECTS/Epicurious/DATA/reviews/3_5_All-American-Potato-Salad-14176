I love this potato salad as it is so classic and reminisant of my Mother's delicious yet simple version. I've grown very fond of "French-style" olive oil-anchovy-capers-oil-cured olive potato salad too, especially with crisp green beans folded into the final dish. Serve this at room temperature with cold grilled chicken, and hot off the grill corn on the cob, and you'll have heaven on a plate.

If the previous reviewer left out most of the ingredients, how can they say it's "awesome"? This is a go-to base tater salad recipe, but ya gotta stick with the "base", then tweak it!

Loved this recipe! Did make a few changes though - almost 1c of mayo, no sweet onion (kids pick it out) so I used about 2 tsp onion powder and omitted the celery (another thing kids pick out). Also used pickle juice instead of the vinegar and added 1/2 tsp of dill. Turned out awesome!

I love this recipe. Instead of vinegar I toss pickle juice with the warm potatoes. I also chop some pickles to add to the salad. Tasty!

Very good basic mayonnaise recipe. Feel free to substitute a different vinegar and/or onion according to your taste. Just don't forget to adjust the amount of mayo to at least 1/2 cup.

BTW the original recipe also has suggested additions: dill pickle, fresh chives, poppy seeds, crab meat, or corn. I especially like it with the chives and corn. So good.

1/8 cup mayo didn't make sense and I know how good these old Gourmet recipes are. I have the issue and looked it up. THE CORRECT MAYO IS 3/4 CUP. It is misprinted at 1/8 cup. The rest is correct.

I didn't care for this. The recipe seemed kind of dry, not enough moisture for the amount of potatoes that were called for.

great recipe. i tweaked it a bit also by adding about a cup of mayo, used sweet red onions, white wine vinegar instead of cider (it's what i had in the pantry), and added parsley and cilantro.

a lot of tweaking necessary to make this passable. just served it for the 4th of July, and I have a lot of leftovers. Try the roasted garlic potato salad from Dean&Deluca...much, much tastier!

This is a good recipe with some tweaking. I used red potatoes (no need to peel the skins), upped the mayo amount to 1/2 cup and reduced it to 2 eggs. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it came out perfect. I can't imagine only using 1/8 cup of mayo. It seems like it would be too pastey. With the adjustments I made, this was a fabulous potato salad, and definitely a keeper. I will be making this again!

I loved this recipe but didn't have vinegar, so I combined mayonnaise and miracle whip together with the mustard and it was FABULOUS!!

Just the recipe I was looking for. Really good. I used reg. mustard instead of dijon and used a bit more mayonnaise too.

Yum! I'm throwing out all my old potato salad recipes. (used nearly one cup of mayo)

Loved this potato salad, and I'm not usually a potato salad fan. Instead of apple cider vinegar, I used white wine vinegar because that's what I had and it was delicious. I also minced the onion instead of chopping it because I'm not a huge fan of raw onions, and mincing it seemed to combine the flavors better. I'll be making this potato salad for all our bbqs.

I made this for my picky boyfriend who requested potato salad on his birthday. I needed an all-American salad and this fit the bill. I added more mayo and would recommed not doubling the apple cidar vinegar as it was too overwhelming. I also added parsley for color.

I love this recipe! After I made this for my in-laws, we finally reconcile our differences. To make this recipe a truly "All-American" potato salad, I put tiny American flags attached onto little toothpicks in the salad before I served it. Had some left over sparklers from the 4th and placed a few of them in the patato salad next to the flags. Then I lit them just before I brought it to the table. Finally, we held hands and sang, "America The Beautiful". I get teary eyed just thinking about it. Thank you, Epicurious.

If you like deviled egs, you'll love this recipe. The dressing is essentially chopped up deviled eggs. Like several other reviewers, my potatoes were dry. I upped the cider vinegar to 6T and combined with 6T chicken broth and poured over the warm potatoes. This not only solved the dry problem, but also provided enough moisture so I did not need to increase the amount of dressing.

All I have to say is - my grandma and grandpa loved this salad - as did the other 50 people at the party. I found guests standing with the refrigerator door open, eating the leftovers out of the tupperware with a fork! I doubled the dressing and used baby Yukon gold potatoes, but otherwise kept everything the same. Great Potato Salad!

I've made much better potato salads. This was bland and honestly a waste of good ingredients. Followed the suggestions by other reviewers to add more mayo and mustard and it was too much. Couldn't taste the egg. I wouldn't make it again.

I loved this potato salad.I also used miracle whip(all I had) & it turned out just fine(I think if I had used mayo it might have been to eggy)The only change I would make is use less cider vinegar...Overall It was really good & all the guest at my bbq enjoyed it very much.This will replace all other potato salad recipes I have.It's a keeper.

Really good! I changed it alot due to ingredients in my fridge. baslamic viniger, 1/2 cup mayo, country style dijon, carrots, zucchini, no celery. If I'm using new potatoes I never peel them give the salad more flavor and texture.

This recipe is outstanding but with changes. Definitely needs a LOT more mayo, I used Miracle Whip Light with great results. Recipe does not need vinegar, tasted prior to coating the potatoes and was excellent with just the Dijon mustard. Used Grey Poupon. Like the idea of mashing yolks separately with the mustard, dressing, salt and pepper, makes a very creamy sauce for the potatoes. I mixed the sauce in a bowl, covered and refridgerated separately from the cooked potatoes combined with chopped egg whites and veggies & did not coat the potatoes with it until I was ready to bring it to the occassion. First time making potato salad and everyone loved!

Just made this for the first time, and I thought it turned out great. I used red wine vinegar (all I had) and substituted 1 of the tblp. of dijon mustard with yellow mustard. I also used closer to a 1/2 cup mayo and added about 1/4 cup whole milk to make the consistency a little better for mixing with potatoes. Definitely will make again!

Rating: 4
The best traditional (American) potato salad ever. I've been thinking about making it again ever since my first bite. I added some buttermilk to the mixture, which gave it a nice edge and seemed to increase the volume or the flow of the sauce enough so that there was no problem with coating the potatoes.

As written, this would get 2 forks (although my husband loved it--it is "taters" after all!). Needs more mayo, less onion/celery and fewer eggs; also, dijon gives it an edge I didn't especially like. I've made a varation that I like much better: use deli mustard (Gulden's), about 1/2 C. mayo, about 1/3 C. onion, 2 celery ribs, 4 eggs (all the yolks and half the whites), 3 pounds potatoes, and add some finely chopped parsley. Season with paprika and a little celery seed as well as salt & pepper.

This is just like the potato salad I remember from home but better! I used American rather than Dijon mustard because I didn't have the latter and used 1/2 cup mayo as recommended. Also I don't like celery so I nixed that. Still excellent and it will be fun to introduce my British friends to real potato salad. The stuff you get here is disgusting.

This is the definitive "All-American" potato salad. It is the old-fashioned sort that your mom used to make when you were a child. It was delicious.

Was looking for a standard type potato salad that included more than just mayo and onions. This was a delicious aadition to our Easter buffet! I used red potatoes and upped the mayo to 1/2 cup as recommended by others. Was very well received by the crowd. Will definitely make again!

Because there's only the two of us, I used one pound of potatoes and two eggs, adjusted everything else accordingly, and it was smashing. I've also made this for potlucks with great success. I would recommend reducing the eggs to three - it's just enough for flavor without overwhelming the potatoes.

Tastes more like devilled eggs than potato salad, but not as good.

Very good, but a little too much onion for my taste. I did, however, up the mayo to a 1/2 cup. (Good Call.) Overall the recipe was alot better than most.

I love this potato salad! It reminded me of the one my grandmother used to make. Must have been the tang from the vinegar. I also increased the amount of mayonnaise to about 3/4 cup, but used low-fat mayonnaise to lessen the guilt. It was still scrumptious and received rave reviews from my family. I will definitely make it again!

I made this for a group of people and everyone raved. I also used more dressing, the quantity given is just not enough.

This recipe was good, but I agree with the other cook that 1/8 c. of mayo is not enough. I took the suggestion and upped it to 1/2c, and it still could have used more. This was my first time making potato salad, next time I will add more mayo & mustard.

Rating: 3
This salad is delicious. I was skeptical about the cider vinegar, I thought it would be too tangy. But it's not at all. Also, the 1/8 cup mayo was skimpy, so I upped it to almost a half. Even then, the dressing just coated the spuds. I will definitely make this salad again.

similar to the recipe i make, i suggest leaving out the vinegar and substituting a similar amount of sweet relish.

This was the first potato salad I've made (as I'm not a huge potato fan!) and it was excellent. I did add a little extra mayo too. Love the 'egginess' the eggs add. Yes, a keeper!

This was a very tasty recipe especially for those who love a simple potato salad. I used red skinned potatoes and left some of the skins in the salad. Also substituted green onions for the sweet onions and added fresh chives from the garden. Definately start by doubling the mayo and mustard if desired, and add more as you go along to suit your tastes. I probably tripled the amount of mayo. I also think that adding some crispy, crumbled bacon for garnish would be tasty.
