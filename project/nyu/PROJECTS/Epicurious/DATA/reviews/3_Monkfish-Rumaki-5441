This dish really lacked something! Not sure what it was, but I was really not satisfied with it. THe Radicchio and bacon complimented each other nicely, but overall the dish wasn't really anything special. Monkfish deserves better!

I must have done something REALLY wrong, it was just disgusting, WAY too vinegary or something. We threw it away and ordered pizza. Just awful. Wonder where I went wrong?

EASY TO MAKE. REALLY ENJOYED THE DIFFERENT FLAVORS, THEY COMPLIMENTED EACH OTHER WELL. BROUGHT SOME TO MY FRIENDS AT WORK AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS VERY GOOD, ALSO.
