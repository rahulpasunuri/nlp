Also known as "Melt-in-your-mouth Shortbread". You can mix all ingredients together, drop by cookie scoop or teaspoon, yields 2 dozen. Dough is fool proof, wonderful to make and work with. Good anytime!

It's funny that these are called Swedish cookies, when vanilla extract is totally unavailable here, and people look at you like you're insane if you ask for unsalted butter...

The proper proportions would be: 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 cup less 2 TB. AP unsifted flour 1/8 tsp salt 2 TB cornstarch

I also doubled the butter and the cookies came out great! I would suggest chilling the dough for 20 min before rolling it out and then re-chilling before cutting. It makes handling MUCH easier.

We made this recipe and it was like most people described it, just crumbs and powder. Then we added another 1/2 stick of butter and it was a lot better, but I wouldn't make this again. I'd rather find a recipe that works the first time around.

I make a family recipe of shortbread every year. I wanted to see the difference in this recipe. I think the problem some of the cooks had was they did not work the dough long enough. You need to keep kneeding the dough until it no longer falls apart.

I didn't have any problems making the dough, but when I moved the cookies from cookie tray to cooling rack they completely crumbled, I am left with a big pile of crumbs :( If somebody knows the cause of this please help - the crumbs taste delicious! I used a good brand of all ingredients, (other cookies turned out great with same butter, flour etc.), could it be my oven or over mixing?

Very light, very rich, very good, and very simple. I like to sprinkle them with more powdered sugar while they're still warm, or spread them with melted chocolate - any variety.

I disagree with everyone, I made the cookies last year and they turned out great, better then I expected. Maby it's your ingredents, try better quality ones.

I wouldn't even give this recipe 1/2 a fork. I followed the directions to the "T" and when I was done I did not have dough, I had a powdery mess. There is no liquid at all that's added to this mixture other than the vanilla. I tried to press it together somewhat and carefully laid each cookie on the cookie sheet. It just crumbled. This does not make 30 to 40 cookies. You're lucky to get 2 dozen. Did I do something wrong? Please tell me and perhaps I might be tempted to try again. WHAT A MESS!

I agree with the Vacaville cook. The cookies were much too dry. I kept re-reading the recipe to see if I had added the correct amounts! The taste was fine, but I would have like them just a tad sweeter. PS- later I made BROILED PEACHES WITH COOKIE-CRUMB TOPPING - soaking the peaches in spiced rum and sugar (similar recipes found on this site) and used the shortbread for the cookies. It was nummy!

Cookies were very dry. Seemed like they needed more sugar. I added sifted powdered sugar on top and that helped.

A really lovely, light shortbread....almost as good as my granny used to make!!! I'll definitely make this one again, this time with a few friends over for a coffee morning.
