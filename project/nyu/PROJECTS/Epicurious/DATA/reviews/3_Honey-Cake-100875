I made this cake for Rosh Hashana. Had a big nostalgia factor for my family, esp. my mom who loved it. It did seem to dry out quickly when unwrapped - leftovers kept in a Ziplock were moist all week.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, ane the cake turned out dry and bland. I would definitely recommend looking for another recipe. Don't waste your time on this one.

it has very good flavor, but the cake is very dry.... i made a honey syrup (similar to bakalava syrup) and poured it over the hot cake and sprinkled sesame seeds on top- the cake was so moist and absolutly to die for-

I'm back for my second go-round with this good recipe. I made it a year ago for a solstice party, and was asked to bring this cake again this year. As I recall, I made 3 changes: 1) I made the cake in large muffin tins, for easier party serving, 2) I added perhaps 1/2 cup of homemade unsweetened apple cider for additional moistness, and 3) I reduced the sugar by 1/4 c, which these days I do in all recipes as it seems to me recipes call for more sugar than necessary.

This was so easy to make and turned out very well. I just made a couple of minor adjustments--used nutmeg instead of cloves and used all coffee instead of coffee and water. I'll definitely make this again.

This cake was good, but not fabulous. It was lighter and had a drier texture than most honey cakes I've had, I expected something more dense and moist. But the flavor was very good. There were so many desserts on the holiday table, and this one was not the most popular. However, it's a tasty spice cake recipe.

I made this recipe for Rosh Hashanah, and found it a bit dry. The baking time seems a bit high to me -- I pulled it out about 10 minutes early. After it cooled, I cut it and drizzed honey on it to make it more moist. I would say it was fine, but not spectacular.

This was easy to make and great tasting! Has anyone tried adding almonds to it? I think the addition of nuts would boost the rating to 4 forks.

Well, this cake was the surprise hit of the holiday dinner. I am no longer an avowed hater of honey cake! This was lighter and more cake-y than most honey cakes I have tried. I used the fleur de lis bundt pan from Williams Sonoma and it looked just beautiful. This recipe will be a standard for Rosh hashanah for years to come.

Made this for my Jewish inlaws for an after-Passover treat. My mother in law couldn't wait until then, and had some today. She proclaimed it "delicious"; this from a woman who had her own bakery in New York City. I was flattered and she was thrilled. I'll DEFINITELY add this to my "keeper file".

This cake is easy, delicious and inexpensive. It's almost too sweet for us; next time I might use slightly less sugar or use a dark honey (the lighter ones are sweeter) and add some nuts.

I was expecting something totally different-- more honey, less spices. It was not nearly sweet enough for me, and had to make a simple icing of powdered sugar and butter.

This cake was very easy, and was popular with my friends and family. It was moist, and seemed to keep well. I would have liked it to have more of a honey flavor than the spice-cake flavor it has, but everyone else thought it was perfect. We will definitely make it again.
