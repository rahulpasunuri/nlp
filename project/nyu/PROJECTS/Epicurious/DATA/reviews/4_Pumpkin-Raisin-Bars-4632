I reduced the baking soda and powder by half and eliminated 1 egg to turn this recipe into a bar (otherwise it's cake). Delicious!

This recipe is fantastic and super easy. The title is misleading since it is really a sheet cake, rather than a bar. I have made this cake with the exact recipe, as well as substituted GF flour, used half melted butter/half oil when I didn't have enough oil, and cut the sugar by 1/2 cup. It always comes out wonderfully. I haven't made the frosting but usually dust with sugar or make a quick maple glaze. This is my go to fall recipe when I have to make something last minute!

Wow! So easy and quite a yield--just the thing for a classroom treat. Very moist, very spicy, very pumpkin-y. Definitely a keeper! I used 4 T of Trader Joe's pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices listed but otherwise followed the recipe as written, except for topping. I spread the batter in a 12.5x17.5 sheet pan and the result was perfect for 1"x3" bar cookies. They are plenty sweet so I decided to simply dust them with powdered sugar mixed with a little more of the pumpkin pie spice. Pretty and yummy!!!

super easy to make! Turned out a bit dry for my taste, but everyone else enjoyed it. I kept the raisins and I like the moisture it gives it, added some pecans and used agave nectar bc I was out of sugar.

I have a similar recipe but it's in storage due to a recent international move. I've been using that recipe for over 20 years! My niece requested them as her birthday falls on October 31 so I searched the net to find a recipe like mine and this is the closest I've come. I've made some changes to the original recipe I used. I use the light raisins instead of the dark raisins. I think they have a better flavor. I also add a cup of chopped walnuts to the bars and I put 3 or 4 tablespoons of pure maple syrup in the cream cheese frosting. After I frost the bars, I sprinkle chopped walnuts on the cream cheese. Scrumptious and they are always a favorite at church potlucks!!

Really moist and flavorful bar/cake. I did, however, make a few relatively minor changes...I used oat flour (instead of AP), 3/4 cup of dark brown sugar (instead of 2 cups white), 1/2 cup applesauce + 1/4 cup olive oil (instead of the 3/4 cup oil) and fat free cream cheese in the frosting. I know, it sounds like a lot of changes..but really pretty standard, healthier substitutions. Even with the decrease in sugar it's still pretty sweet. The pumpkin and spice ratio lend well to using whole grain flours (whole wheat, spelt, oat, etc.) without noticing the difference. The frosting was yummy, even with the FF cream cheese. Overall a very versatile and adaptable recipe for those of us who like to fool around with the originals. Oh, I also left out the raisins. I gave it 3 forks, only b/c I changed it up and the original recipe had 2 cups of sugar, (not including the other cup in the frosting)..overkill, anyone?!. With changes I rate it at 4 forks:)

Very good cakey bar. I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup for the bars and omitted the butter in frosting. They were delicious. I don't think the quantity of frosting was quite adequate though. I will increase that by 1/2 next time.

really good moist, cake. not firm enough to be called a bar. baked this in a 13x9 for almost 30 minutes, cut sugar in half and added a short pour of maple syrup. replaced the veg oil with 2/3 c butter. nice crumb, velvety texture.

I used brown rice flour instead of all purpose (I needed a gluten-free dessert), omitted the raisins (yuck!), used less sugar that called for, and added some vanilla & heavy cream to the icing. They are fabulous (even without the icing, but the icing makes them amazing), and they are disappearing quickly!!! Good thing I doubled the recipe!

Simple, quick, and a bit hit with the family. Used half spelt and half white flour. Halved the sugar and used brown instead. Still very sweet; may try only 1/2 cup of sugar the next time. Also substituted cinnamon applesauce for half the oil. Didn't miss it a bit -- super moist and cakey. Added 1 tsp. almond extract to the icing. It came out great.

Made this for a church dinner - used applesauce instead of the oil and walnuts instead of raisins. Big Hit! Next time I think I will use 1 cup white sugar 1 cup brown. Super easy to make a received lots of compliments

A hit! Made these for Christmas and they were a big success. Like the others, I substituted applesauce for 1/2 the oil, cut down the sugar by 1/2 cup and used equal parts brown/white, and added ginger and toasted pecans. Did not make the frosting (although it sounds great) but used some leftover streusel topping on top. Wounderful!

Very moist and delicious. I omitted the raisins because I'm not a raisin lover, used a combination of brown and white sugar, and added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the frosting. I also reduced the amount of oil to 2/3 C. Yum!

Omitted sugar, substituted maple syrup (1/2 cup) and increased flour by 2 T. Used freshly baked pumpkin, skipped the raisins, and used half organic whole-wheat pastry flour, half organic white. Increased spices and added ginger per other suggestions. For a frosting, I made an almost sugar-free dulce de leche using 2 T butter, 12 T organic sweetened condensed milk and 3/4 cup maple sugar cooked for 5 minutes. Yum!

I made this for a church dinner. I took another reviewer's advice to use brown sugar, I used 1 cup in place of the 2 cups of sugar. I also used Trader Joe's Pumpkin spice, 1 1/2 Tablespoons in place of the cinnamon/nutmeg/clov es. Also omitted the raisins as other reviewers did, and added some vanilla to the frosting. This is a wonderful quick and yummy recipe! It had just the right amount of sweetness, I plan to save this to my recipe file for future use...

I used 2 cups of my own frozen pumpkin (raw), held the raisins - tastes great, freezes well. My husbands been bugging me to make them again soon...

I love this recipe. I prepare it exactly as written except that I omit the raisins. I took it the last two years to our Halloween block party, and it was gobbled up each time by both kids and adults. I also made these pumpkin bars when I served lunch at the Ronald McDonald House here last year, and the staff asked me if they could post the recipe on their bulletin board because so many families had asked about it. The cake is light and moist in addition to being flavorful, and the frosting is delicious. A great combination for a wonderful fall treat!

Moist, spicy and delicious! Got raves reviews from my husband (and he's not overly fond of pumpkin!)and my parents. Only change made was adding 1/2 teaspoon of ginger and baking the bars in a 13x9-inch pan (mine were done in 24 minutes). A wonderful alternative to gingerbread!

These were okay, but not as good as other pumpkin breads I've made...maybe increase the spices and add some ground ginger. However, the cream cheese icing was nice (used 2/3 amt of sugar) and added some tartness to contrast the cake. I used raisins, but might omit them and use walnuts were I to make this again.

I omitted the raisins and did a drizzle glaze (powdered sugar/vanilla/milk) instead of the cream cheese frosting (husband doesn't like cream cheese) - it was a nice, quick & easy dessert - I will certainly be making it again.

Wow. All of the reviews are right, these are SO easy and really really good. I changed it slightly, following the advice of a few other reviewers: Used 1 cup of dark brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar, used chocolate chips instead of raisins, and omitted the butter from the frosting (it didn't need it). Fantastic, and super easy.

This got rave reviews from everyone... It is irresistible...Do not omit the raisins...I cut down the amount of sugar in the frosting...This recipe could be made at least 2 days in advance, if necessary...This is one of my favorite pumpkin recipes....This is very easy to prepare and the results are outstanding..

As written it is good but very sweet. Some changes I've made were to cut the 2c sugar to 1c packed brown sugar--and instead of the frosting I used a struesel topping. The bars freeze well and are a great lunchbox treat.

These were delicious and easy to make. I made them without raisins. I cut them into little squares, and they flew off the plate in no time. We all agreed they were a bit too sweet, however. The frosting is so sweet you don't need nearly so much sweetness in the bars themselves. Next time I will try cutting the sugar in half.

very easy to make and very tasty-perfect throw together holiday dessert...cut into squares and serve in little paper baking cups for professional looking dessert finish...frosting is plenty rich without the butter-it just makes it greasy

I'm pregnant and addicted to anything pumpkin right now. These bars did the trick although, I felt like I was the only one devouring them. A few of my guests commented on their yumminess yet I think I was the biggest fan. I followed the recipe exactly and it made a great pumpkin fix!

Very fast, very easy. My friends and our children thought it was delicious! I added chocolate chips instead of the raisins. I also halved the cloves and replaced the other half with ginger. Yummy! I'll be taking this to a church social on Saturday.

Great recipe! Very flavorful, easy and big enough for sharing. I used whole wheat flour for half the flour and it came out great. I took it out of the oven too early because the toothpick looked clean - better to check it by touching it to see if it springs back. I served mine with cream cheese frosting. Yum!

Excellent recipe, makes a good big size pan for sharing with neighbours and family. I added a bit of ginger, about half teaspoon, to the cake and added a teaspoon of vanilla to the icing. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Extremely quick and easy to make.

Made these last night - delicious. I made a few changes to suit my taste, tried 1/2 c oil and only 1 1/2 c. sugar. Turned out wonderful, moist and nicely spiced. Took half to work and they couldn't stop eating them! Also many requests for the recipe!

So easy! So Delicious! I doubled the recipe, added raisins to only half, brought to a picnic, sent some to work with my husband, they really disappeared. Will make many more times. When I was a kid we used to make these, but the family lost the recipe. We are thrilled to have it back again.

After the first bite, my husband said "This is a keeper". He doesn't often say that, so it is. Since he also has kitchen duty most of the time, he also appreciated the fact that it's a one-bowl recipe. ;-) I too left out the raisins but did make the frosting. I'll probably try it without the frosting, kick up the spices, substitute apple sauce for the vegetable oil and add some chopped candied crystallized ginger in place of the raisins, as I'm a ginger freak. Definitely one to add to your favourites box, both for flavour and ease. I always have all the ingredients on hand, so that makes for a great last-minute treat. Yum!

This is a terrific recipe and couldn't be more simple. To reduce the fat I substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil, and instead of frosting the bars I sprinkled on powdered sugar with a touch of cinnamon & nutmeg. I love raisins and used golden instead of regular.

I made this without the frosting and served it with ice cream instead. It was delicious. I had also added some 5-spice powder in place of some of the cinnamon and about 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. This is a very good, moist snack cake and would pack well in school lunches.

Simple to make, but you'll never be accused of making a simple-tasting dessert. I make this recipe several times during the holidays every year. As other chefs have suggested, I too omit the raisins---I think that they clutter up an already perfect dessert. Perfect with milk.

What a great and EASY recipe. Guests at our Halloween party loved it. It is so moist and flavorful, and the fact that you can make it a day ahead is a bonus. Suspect it would also be good with chopped nuts instead of raisins.

I've been making for 28 years a similar recipe that people love: 4 eggs; 1 c.veg. oil; 2 c. sugar; 1 c. pumpkin; 2 c. flour; 1 tsp baking powder; 1 tsp. baking soda; 1/2 tsp. salt; 2 tsp. cinnamon; 1 cup pecans. Combine all ingredients. Bake 350 in a greased, floured 15" jelly roll pan, 20-25 minutes. Frosting: 3 oz. cream cheese; 6 Tblsp. butter; 3/4 lb. powdered sugar; 1 tsp. vanilla; a very little milk for spreadability. Spread on warm cake. Chill before cutting into bars.
