I have made every year for Easter day picnic since 1999. Delicious!

These are very tasty and easy. I cubed the ham and added it along with chopped green onions into the batter. I set them on the table and when I turned to see how many were left, they were all gone. I agree that the tops may appear to be dry because of some excess flour, but I lightly brushed them with some melted butter. Flour disappeared and the flavor skyrocketed!! It's all good!!

These scones are AMAZING! i made them today for an easter brunch with friends, and they absolutely loved them! I did some variations with another recipe I found at the wholefoods website - no change to the scone recipe, but instead of the mustard butter i made a Mango chutney. Still used the Black Forest ham.... Geez, superb!

Fabulous! I make these every Easter for brunch and also for picnics. I disagree that they have to be served straight out of the oven. If you are lucky enough to be able to get thinly sliced, imported ham, they are the best!

i tweaked it a bit - using half and half for milk and heavy cream, (because that's what i had in the frig) and i diced the ham and put it in the batter. for breakfast or brunch, split scone and fill with scrambled eggs. everyone loved it.

This is a great recipe! It's nice to have a savoury scone as an alternative to a sweet breakfast. I wasn't going to make them into sandwiches, so I increased the amount of cheese and grated it very finely. The resulting flavour was delicious and the consistency perfect. My only complaint was aesthetic. I was tempted to bake them until they turned a darker colour, because they didnt seem to be done. The final scones really had a pale, slightly flour-y exterior. When I make these again I will brush the tops with cream or milk to improve the appearance.

These scones have been an Easter staple since the recipe was first published. My unadventurous extended family actually asks for them each year. Easy and quick to make with great flavor. I serve them with a standard spiral ham. I skip the mustard butter and just serve a honey mustard.

I made these this weekend (as a scone novice) for my toddler's birthday party, and everyone loved them, even my picky father-in-law, who ate 5 leftover ones yesterday while I was out of the house. I thought the honey mustard butter was just right, also. I wonder if adding a little dried dill to the scones would be any good...

These were great, really light and tasty. I agree however with another reviewer--serve them fresh from the oven rather than waiting.

I made this for my French mother-in-law and she didn't believe that I had cooked the scones myself! She thought I had purchased them from a French boulangerie! Hee hee! Excellent recipe.

The scones were nice and light. I brought these to a family memebers home for Easter and do not think I would serve them again unless I could pull them out of the oven and serve, definitely better warm!

These were great and easy to make. I made with leftover Easter ham. These would make a very nice brunch buffet. I'd definitely make again. The scones by themselves would make a great side to a ham-and-eggs breakfast.

These were terrific - I used store bought honey mustard since they were for lunch and not brunch, but the scones came out terrific! I will try them again with the honey mustard butter soon, but its a great recipe if just for the scones. I will make them again.

Made these for Easter brunch and got lots of compliments, especially about the honey-mustard butter. They're so easy to make - - less than an hour from start to finish (including clean up!). Try them, you won't be disappointed.

This was a tremendous hit at our holiday party. We served the biscuits and the ham warm with the honey butter mustard slightly melted. Two things: I made the biscuits about 5 days before the party and then froze the biscuits on cookie sheets and when they were frozen put them in bags. I then baked them right before eating. I neeed more liquid.

These are great for a brunch. The honey-mustard butter makes it.

I made these scones for a big Easter brunch at my house this year. I increased the recipe by half for a larger crowd. They were quite easy to make. The scones were delicious and everyone raved about them. I put the honey mustard butter and ham on the side and gave my guests the option to make their own ham-wiches or eat them alone. Either way they were a huge hit! I'll make these over and over!

I made these for a brunch...added extra cheddar to the dough, and on top of the scones while baking. One of my guests asked me where I got them - thinking I had visited the bakery! I served them with a ham and egg dish, so we ate them with the honey butter only, no ham. They were very yummy! Normally, for me, the top of the scone is best, since it has the glaze or topping. But the bottom of these were great because the cheese in the dough gets crispy from the pan. Mmmmmmmm.

Excellent Christmas morning breakfast.

I made these for an office brunch this morning. I thought they were great, and everyone thought they looked really cute. I followed the recipe exactly and found the dough very nice and easy to work with. Instead of bothering with cutting the scones in half, I just cut them a little smaller and used 2 scones per sandwich. The honey-mustard butter really makes this recipe.

These scones were a little dry, but were good with the ham & honey mustard.

This recipe was great! They made perfect little sandwiches, and my favorite part was using the rest the next morning. They pair perfectly with scrambled eggs and bacon. Amazing.

I served these for Easter Brunch with the vegetable frittata and some cold poached salmon. I thought these were delicious and looked great on a platter. Will definitely make them again since they just disappeared!

My guests ate the scones and liked the spread, but I didn't see much difference in the scones compared to regular baking powder biscuits and they didn't rise as high for me. The dough seemed to stiff, but the finished product was not leaden.

Outstanding. Crispy and tender biscuits. Great with ham and honey-mustard butter for brunch.
