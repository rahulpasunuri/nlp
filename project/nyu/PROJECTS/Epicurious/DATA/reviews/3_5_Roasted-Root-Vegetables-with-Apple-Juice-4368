Best way I've found to roast (sometimes boring) winter root vegetables! Used Martinelli's sparkling apple cider instead of apple juice because that's what I had in the fridge. Same with the vegetables -- used turnips, carrots, yams and Brussels sprouts. Flavorful and made good leftovers too!

to janiceschwab- I'm sure you could just use all apple juice, but virtually all alcohol will be cooked off in the reduction and the roasting. Enjoy the veg!

have not tried this yet but will soon. for those who avoid alcohol as much as possiable, any ideas on what to substitute for the white wine? Would this work without it?

Have tried this recipe before and it sometimes worked well. For those who marinate first - did you use just apple juice, before reduction - or did you reduce and then marinate?

I added a bit of oregano to the veggies but otherwise made as is. The juice and wine reduced to a glaze without the vegetables getting mushy. They were (except the yams) were still crunchy. I used carrots, parsnips, sweet potates and turnips. You could use any roots. Great make ahead type of recipe for a dinner party.

I really should give this 2 forks for the recipe as is. However, I think with some additional herbs or spices this recipe is defintiely a 3-4 forks. Just pick your favorite spice or herbs and you'll be happy!

Loved it! Not one morsel left in the serving dish. I thought it needed a little something, so I added about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar after roasting and stirred until melted. Also, a great make-ahead dish and reheat in the microwave. I will definitely make again!

very tasty addition to roast port, mashed potatoes and gravy. The kids (who hate root veg) loved the sweet taste the apple juice gave the veggies.

Serves more like 12 than 8, ESPECIALLY at Thanksgiving (20?)!! Needed some extra seasoning - I like Tuscon's idea of marinating it and adding allspice. I made it a day ahead and cooked til vegetables were still crisp - that way when it was reheated, they were done to perfection.

Not a big root-vegetable fan; I thought the wine and apple juice would make them palatable. Just barely. I made two trays for my Thanksgiving dinner and my guests barely put a dent in one of them.

Easy and delicious, a new classic! I used only the turnips, parsnips and rutabagas-sweet potatoes otherwise employed for Thanksgiving-and marinated overnight with allspice added. Roast past tender to caramelized and even non root vegetable fans will be enthused!

We made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it! It was even better the next day for hash browns! Made more than expected. Lots of leftovers. Would probably cut recipe in half next time.

Would anyone like to comment on how this fits time/space wise, while also cooking for thanksgiving? I have only one oven! Do you just cook these along with your turkey? Thanks

We made this dish a couple of Thanksgivings ago and we're about to serve it again for this Thanksgiving. We substituted a few potatoes for the rutabagas.

Too dry and too many veggies competing for attention with the juice and wine... alot going on there when it could be more simple with 3 vegetables. And I didn't marinade beforehand and maybe I should have.

An added hit to my Christmas dinner. It was relatively easy to make... just a bunch of chopping and peeling. I marinated the vegetables in the juice for 24 hours on another reviewers recommendation. I also added butter towards the end of baking as some of the vegetables were drying out. This really helped!

This was a wonderful addition to Thanksgiving dinner. My local market was out of parsnips, but it didn't affect the recipe at all. Like a previous reviewer, I left the veggies in the apple juice mixture overnight before roasting....PERFECTION!!

I have used this recipe every thanksgiving since it first appeared. I am no longer allowed not to use it, it's that popular. It's great with an even greater variety of vegatables. Use beets, but cook seperately, and add at end

We enjoyed very much. We used one of the previous comments tip on adding Allspice and that was a nice touch. Next time we might add an onion and allow the dish to carmelize a little longer.

I loved this dish. I did, however, soak the vegetables overnight in the apple juice mixture and then roasted it in a casserole dish. Delish!!

It was bland until I added Allspice. Very decorative. I draped it over a Crown Roast for Christmas dinner.
