This was delicious and easy. To sneak some vegetables into the meal, mix in fresh spinach leaves to wilt when removing from the heat.

Great and surprisingly easy risotto dish. It is even better, in the summertime, when paired with pears and some almonds. Definitely make sure to have adequate basil supplies, because the flavor is not as spectacular without 2.5 cups. I substituted sage with other fresh things in my garden - recommend trying different herbs. Will probably make this again next week!

This is a great-tasting risotto (although I omitted the sage), and I will definitely make it again. However, I would suggest reducing the initial cooking time of the rice, i.e., the step just prior to adding the wine, to just 1-2 minutes instead of 10 minutes. It will take longer overall, because it will take longer to absorb each liquid addition, but I believe it will help the risotto to remain al dente instead of becoming mushy.

We skipped the sage and added fresh tomato from the farmer's market-- delicious! We also didn't need as much stock as they said to use; probably closer to 4 1/2 cups instead of 5 1/2.

We just made a half portion of this--had no sage, but added a handful of pignolis to the basil and another handful of toasted whole pignolis to the finished dish: absolutely delicious!

Great simple summer side dish! Used fresh basil from the backyard and a wonderfully crisp pinot grigio for the wine. I did add some sliced toasted almonds for crunch; Paired well with the el dente rice.

this dish was great and relatively simple to make. just go easy on the amount of sage you pack in the measuring cup, as its flavor is much stronger than the basil's and can overpower the overall flavor of this dish if you add too much.

I found the sage in this recipe too overpowering; it dominated over the basil. I was dubious about combining sage and basil in the first place. Why not just leave it at basil?

This was an excellent main dish. We picked the fresh herbs right from our garden -- their taste was not overwhelming at all. It was simple to prepare and perfectly creamy. A great hit!

This was a very good recipe. The basil was not overpowering, although I would expect any dish with 2 1/2 cups of basil to have a strong basil flavour. If you like pesto, you'll like this. I was out of wine, so I subbed some noilly prat. It was ok, though it left a sweet taste that I wasn't expecting. I also added some cream at the end since I had some in the fridge which needed to be used up. Worth the time and effort.

Wow! We loved it. Normally basil dishes are too timid with the basil. This dish had plenty of basil flavor and was very easy to make. I didn't have to tweak the recipe at all.

Terrific risotto with great flavor. We didn't find the basil to be overpowering at all. On the contrary - the blend of flavors was just right. Will definitely keep this one in our repertoire.

This was outstanding. Even made it with basmati rice. Needed less than half the chicken broth called for and used a fume blanc for wine. Also added 1/4 cup of fresh rosemary because it was there.

Part of my problem with this recipe is that I overcooked it. In my hurried rush to prepare, I didn't read ahead that you might have broth left over. So, I ended up stirring it all, and of course by that time it was way overcooked. Aside from that, it calls for WAY too much basil and sage. It was way overpowering. My boyfriend (who loves food and eats just about everything) said it, "Tasted like it had too much greens."

This was one of the better risottos I have ever made...Very simple, but flavorfull. I served this this with a moat of the warm cherry tomato salad from this website, also with some sprinkled toasted pinenuts and mozzerela cubes. The flaovors went together nicely. I will absolutly make this again.

Excelent!!... I added fresh garlic to the parmesan-basil mixture and the result was a delicious "rissoto al pesto"... the fresh tomato salad on the side it's a perfect match for the strong flavor.

An excellent dish. I made this as one of 3 risoto's as a second course at a feast for a large group of friends and it proved to be one of the most popular dishes that night. Easy to make and wonderful. The recipe works very well, no changes to ingredients or process needed.

I was amazed that this recipe has so much flavor, but then again, I should have known by the amount of basil that is in it. It is a simple but impressive recipe. I loved the pretty green! I will definitely make this again!

I thought this dish was great. The next time I make it, I want to add fresh chopped tomatoes. I think it will add flavor.

This was AMAZING!! Very easy to prepare for a risotto. Definitely use all of the basil. I also added some feta along with the parmesan which I thought was a nice touch. A hit with the whole family!!! Will definitely make it again soon :)

I have made this recipe several times and I found a few additions that made a good recipe even better. I added one med. carrot very finely diced at the beginning and about 1/4 c finely diced roasted red pepper toward the end. The color and taste contrast was great! Have also added fresh asparagus when on hand = great twist, and a little garlic never hurts! USE ALL OF THE BASIL!!

This recipe is completely delicious! We combined it with a warm salad of peas, corn and carrots and the taste was great. It is worth repeating many times.

Really a very good rice dish. I only used 1/2 an onion and it was very good!

Very good. I used all of the basil the recipe calls for and liked it. Easy to make. Would definitely make it again

Delicious! I followed the advice from others and cut down to about a half cup of chopped basil. I will use more next time, but it was very good nonetheless. I also used medium grain rice instead of arborio because it's what I had on hand. Lots of praises!

A great dish. I used half the amount of herb mixture and thought it was still super.

Loved by all 3 generations it served ! We had bunches of fresh organic basil (1st of the year) which we chopped by hand. Our family would cut back on the onions and chick. broth to let the basil flavor come forth even more.

This was very good. It was very basilie and had a good texutre. You can substitute orzo for aborro rice if you don't have it. You can also substitute vegetable broth for the chicken stock if you are a vegetarian as we are. It was delicious.

Based on earlier comments, cut the basil and sage to about 1/3 of the recipe. At that quantity, they did not overwhelm. 1/2 would probably be OK. If you haven't made Risotto before, consult a good Italian cookbook for technique.

Good, but not fabulous. The herbs (especially the sage, surprisingly!) tended to overpower the other flavors. It was a little too much like sitting down to an entire bowl of pesto. I'll definitely cut back on both basil and sage the next time I make this.

Delicious. I chopped the basil and sage by hand, presumably coarser than a food processor would have, and the green flecks looked very nice.

I made this dish for some friends and we loved it. It was simple to prepare and nice to employ seasonal offerings, i.e., basil, sage and vidalia onions. I substituted peccorino cheese for parmesan to accommodate a friend's cow's-milk allergy, and the recipe was just as delicious.

Although I love basil, I found the basil to be too overpowering in this recipe. I think that using a half or even a quarter of the basil and sage called for in the recipe is much better. Asparagus is also a nice addition to this recipe.
