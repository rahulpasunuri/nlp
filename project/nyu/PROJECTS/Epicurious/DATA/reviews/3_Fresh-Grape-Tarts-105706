The tart was good out of the oven - I would probably add some cinnamon or spice next time. I would also definetly reduce the amount of flour - my grape mixture was a little pasty. When I was pouring the grapes onto the pastry shell, some liquid leaked onto the parchment paper and I had a hard time separating the bottom of the crust from the paper. Also didn't bother cutting off the edges to make a circle - just folded the corners in with added to the appearance in my opinion.

I tackled the entire French Provence buffet (where this recipe was included) for a birthday party. After that much work, the dessert was a breeze. It was one of the hits of the entire celebration!

Only half of the grapes (after making the puree) are to be sliced. It made sense re-reading the recipe after I saw the photograph. I agree that it really should be eated warm. I tried using a regular short crust (because it was in my freezer) and it didn't work out very well - the bottom of the crust did not get cooked enough. I'll try it again with the puff pastry and hope it will turn out better.

Pretty decent recipe, has a European, not so terribly sweet flare. Didn't have any red grapes so I just used green ones. If you want the same look as the picture don't slice all the grapes. I think this is best served warm out of the oven, doesn't look or taste quite as appealing when cold or after sitting for a while.

this recipe makes two tarts - the 11 cups of grapes are for the two tarts.

I am curious where the other 4 3/4 cup of grapes went. The recipe calls for 11 cups, you puree 1 1/5 cups, and cut 4 3/4 cups in half. That leaves an extra 4 3/4 cups unaccounted for.

Sounds delicious, but... cut 4 3/4 cups grapes in half lengthwise?! LOL! I would need some convincing before committing to that.
