Great recipe, versatile and it is a monthly staple for us in the winter. I switch it up sometimes by adding butternut squash & swiss chard, always mushrooms, and sometimes with only tomatoes & zucchini. I never add more than 1 cup of broth, and a little thyme and or oregano for added flavor. Always add a splash of red wine vinegar at the end & a sprinkle of asiago cheese on each plate adds a definite punch of flavor.

I share many of the other reviewer's sentiments. This recipe is just ok, and lacking in a bit of flavor. I think 3 vs 4 cups of broth would be better, as it felt a bit too liquid.

I thought this was just ok. It was easy to make but I didn't think the beans were as tender as I would have liked them to have been. Also, I only used 3 cups of vegetable broth. The ragout just wasn't as saucey as I would have liked. I think next time I would use one (or half) of the beans and smash them up to make the sauce thicker.

Fairly simple to prepare and well loved by all.

This was very good, although I took other reviewers advice and doctored it up a bit. Used all the soffritto, added about 2 tablespoons tomato paste and a couple of anchovy fillets that I had in the fridge (we call it "bacon of the sea"). Pushed the soffritto aside and fried the anchovy fillets until they fell apart, then mixed them in when I added the broth (2 cups veggie, 1/2 cup white wine). Added dried basil, red pepper flakes, a parm rind and oregano at the end of the soffritto cooking time. I also threw in frozen chopped spinach for color and flavor. Added a little lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil at serving. Tomorrow it will probably be dry as there wasn't much liquid left in the pan when I was done, so I'll try pureeing it with some fresh garlic and extra oil and make a dip. Yes, I changed it up quite a bit, but overall a keeper.

I think there's a bit too much liquid in it. I wouldn't put more than 3 cups in it total. It's also a little light on spice. I would add a bit more garlic to the soffrito. I also added a parmesan rind in after the broth was added and started simmering. A stronger stock would do well, too. Not beef or lamb, but perhaps a reduced, rich vegetable stock or a dark chicken stock or a duck stock. I agree with other reviewers that a touch of smoked meat would do nicely. I would use bacon fat with olive oil to start the soffrito. Or, I would add a prosciuttto end with the parmesan rind during stewing. Otherwise, tasty recipe.

We reduced the liquid component to 3 cups and used equal parts white wine & veggie broth b/c I'm not a huge fan of veggie broth. It was pretty yummy. Will definitely be making again. If you really wanted to mix things up a bit and didn't care about the vegetarian aspect of this recipe, I would bet that adding some ground sausage to this recipe would really make it sing.

Delicious! As other reviewers I increased the amount of soffrito and reduced the stock to start and only added more as needed. I made a huge batch of soffrito and froze it in small containers. With this out of the way, the dish can be made in minutes.

This recipe was really disappointing since I was excited to try it based on its rating. I followed it exactly as written and my "okay" rating reflects this. It was quite bland and had far too much liquid. Perhaps the tweaking others suggested would make an improvement but there are far too many other recipes I would rather try than make this one again. Even my husband thought it was blah.

As many have said here, the dish is tasty but the recipe needs tweaking. After pulsing the onions/pepper, drain the mixture as the onions will have released a lot of their juices. As someone else noted, using more than a cup of soffritto for the bean dish only improves the flavor. Finally, I would add only 2 cups broth initially, and later add a little more if it thickens. No more than 3 cups total needed; 4 is unlikely to thicken.

Delicious rustic recipe. The flavors in this were wonderfully complex for the simplicity of the recipe. Like a few others stated, I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was perfect. Make sure to use a large heavy skillet so there's plenty of surface area for the broth to properly evaporate and thicken.

First recipe I've tried on Epicurious and it turned out great! Wife and kids loved it.

Excellent recipe. Used this as a first course for my Italian dinner party of 13 people. It was an awesome presentation, especially after the fresh parsley & olive oil garnish right before serving. Everyone loved it. Would make it again for sure -- next time as a main course with a beautiful green salad!

Tasty, hearty, vegetarian, comfort food. Also a great way to use up slightly old/stale bread.

This was amazing! I made a fresh loaf of rustic white bread and used that in place of the ciabatta. This was a hit at my last minute dinner party and I will make it again!

Excellent! I probably would not have gravitated towards this recipe, but it got such great reviews I figured why not. I did make a few changes. I used only 2.5 cups broth/.5 cups white wine and a bit more soffrito. I also added a bit of lemon juice and basil at the end.

Super easy and a nice light meal for summer. I reduced the stock by half but would add a little more next time. As one reviewer noted, the beans absorb the liquid over time.

Great, just couldn't get the sauce to thicken up like it stated. But it was very good, light, not heavy. Be sure to brown the bread a little too and try to keep the crust crispy. Great leftover too!

I didn't have much hope for this recipe so I couldn't believe how delicious it is! I didn't know beans on toast could taste so good. I didn't change a thing and it turned out great.

This is excellent. Followed the recipe closely. Making the soffrito is a time investment but totally worth it on the day in the future when you take one of your two jars of leftover soffrito out of the freezer for a super quick dinner. The 3 to 4 cups of broth worked for us, perhaps because we did indeed put the ragout over the toasted bread unlike other reviewers. (Personal preference, but we did not find this soggy with a semi-whole wheat, crusty loaf, or with a white baguette). Also, if you make this ahead and the beans rest in the broth, they soak up some broth. Certainly the leftovers the next day are more sauce like. But if you use fewer beans or don't plan to soak your bread, start with less broth to be on the safe side -- easy to add, harder to remove!

This is very good but needs modifications. 4 cups broth is way too much unless you want soup, not ragout. I only used 1 3/4 cup. I also used more tomato paste and a 12oz. box of cherry heirloom tomatoes from Trader Joes. Plus I decided to add Italian sausage also from Trader Joes.It would still be tasty without the sausage but the spices in the meat gave the dish alittle more kick which I liked.

This was very good, homey, and fulfilling. I wouldn't suggest using all the soffrito at once as it may make the dish too oniony. I am pretty excited about having another soffrito ready to go the next time I want to whip up this dish. Used 3 cups of homemade turkey broth and simmered til slightly thick which was more than the suggested 4 minutes. Didn't have enough to add 1 last cup - it was a little thick, but SO hearty. Didn't miss the soupiness.

This was delicious. I didn't read the reviews but it worked out because I only had about 2 1/2 cups of broth which was just right and I only used 1 can of white beans which was enough. I put it on top of toasted Perreca's bread which is a very crusty Italian bread from a bakery in upstate NY. I am pretty sure is known elsewhere. My family loved it. My teenaged daughter is a vegetarian and I am always looking for good veg recipes. This was a very good one. Only complaint I have is that I chose to make it in 90 degree weather but I will definitely make this again in the fall.

This ragout was really good, but only after I made several of the changes that other reviewers on this site recommended. I reduced the amount of broth to 3 cups and it was more than enough. Instead of putting the bread at the bottom, I floated it on top, like a french onion soup, so that it would be less soggy. I also simmered the stew for a bit longer than the recipe suggested, and the resulting broth was adequately thick. I used grape tomatoes and sourdough bread, and it worked beautifully. Overall, it was good and I will make it again, but nothing that really made my tastebuds dance.

This recipe was amazing. I kind of followed the directions- here are my additions/changes. I made the whole recipe without taking 1/2 cup out and saving etc. I simply continued adding the ingredients. I only used 2 cups of broth, adding gradually when needed. I added 2 extra firm blocks of tofu, cubed and 1 package of Trader Joe's Italian sausage (vegan). I crisped both the tofu and sausage up before adding. This made for a very satisfying meal!!

LOVED this! I used chicken broth instead of water and only used 3 cups, which was sufficient. 4 cups would've ruined it. Also I cooked a couple slices of diced bacon first and made the soffrito in a few teaspoons of the drippings along with the olive oil. This was just fantastic though, I can't wait to make it again. We had it as an entree, but this could've easliy been portioned out as an appetizer too. Make sure you get some really good bread. I used a rustic olive bread, it was perfect!

This is basically an Italian version of French Onion Soup!! It is TO DIE FOR delicious. I topped my thick bread with mozzarella, but cooked the rest per the recipe. This was a hit with my picky-eating children, as well as my husband.

If you want you can use just plain little navy beans, seasoned with a ham hock if you desire and cook till just tender and then follow the recipe. This may be a way to use part of the beef broth.

I should have read the previous reviews before making this. 4 cups broth was entirely too much unless you want a soup. I only added 3 cups and it was still too much. Flavor was excellent. I used chicken broth and added twice as much of the soffritto that was called for.

This is a good change of pace for a vegetarian entree. I only added about 2 cups of broth. 4 cups with such a short simmer time would be too brothy. I may improvise some variations by adding more herbs (thyme, rosemary) and/or something for texture (sun dried tomato? mushroom?). It is good on its own but also versatile as a base for other dishes. I pureed some of the leftovers to make a dip for crostini. I may use the rest for a minestrone like soup.

I may be completely confused as to what constitutes a ragout, but I thought the recipe as is was too watery. I stopped at 3C of broth, used the ragout over a bed of quinoa, and topped with basil chiffonade.

Rating: 3
The first night I put the ragout over the toast but I didn't like the texture as the bread started getting soggy. For leftovers the next night, I served in bowls and just dipped the toast and I liked it better b/c the toast stayed toasty!

My husband just became a vegetarian and this was a nice weekday satisfying meal. He loved it. Made it as written...used grape tomatoes.
