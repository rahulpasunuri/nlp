While I think this recipe is a great starting point, it definitely needs work. Biggest problem is the curry paste to liquid ratio. I ended up adding 4tbs red curry paste and it still wasn't enough. Most thai curry recipes that mimic restaurant medium to hot spice levels use a ratio of 1 tbs curry paste to 1 cup liquid, and that is exactly what I would recommend here. I ran out of paste at 4 tbs and supplemented with a few tsp of sriracha per bowl. The construction method is solid though, and can have any variety of vegetables added in place of beans and eggplants. I went with red peppers, onions, carrots and green beans this time and it was great. Added a bit of rice per bowl to give it some more heft. I also used trimmed chicken thighs in place of breasts and pan fried them a touch longer to account for their longer cook time. I'd definitely make this again, but more for the method than the recipe itself. Lime juice at the end is another necessity.

Forgot to mention: I also added a few reconstituted dried shiitake mushrooms and they added depth to the flavors. Yum!

So easy! I took many of the reviewers' suggestions to heart to make this yummy soup. My version: I used low-fat coconut milk (keeping the coconut milk:broth ratio), about double the red curry paste (Thai Kitchen brand), two small bok choy, one large eggplant, rice noodles, half a lemongrass stalk, the juice of a whole lime, cilantro instead of basil, and tossed in extra spicy chili sauce at the end. Next time, I will add the bok choy later in the cooking, but I loved how the eggplant was so flavorful. Reheats well, too!

There are lots of potential variations on this easy recipe and a lot can be done to customize it to your taste. I added bamboo shoots and onions in the first step with the chicken. Then instead of 3 cups broth and 3 cups coconut milk I did 2 cups broth and 4 cups milk since I like a really creamy curry. At the end I also added some grated lime peel for a little extra tang and a half a teaspoon of brown sugar for a hint of sweetness. I think I also used more red curry paste since I like the heat. My husband and I agreed it was better than the local Thai place!

One word..... AWESOME !!!

Whoever said this is a great base for experimentation is right. This time I followed the recipe with the exception of adding 2 stalks of lemongrass, and it was fabulous. However, I can really see it being great with any veggies on hand, prawns, and whatever else is rolling around the kitchen. And it's so easy to make, too!

I made this soup without the eggplant. I added more chicken, mushrooms, and red pepper. It does need something to add a little of the sour effect. I'm not sure if fresh lime juice would do it or not. Otherwise, it was delicious!

Great recipe. I thickened it with a cornstarch slurry because my husband prefers thicker soups. I also substituted in veggies I had on hand (red peppers, mushrooms, and green onions). I added the juice of 1 lime at the end, but wish I had stopped at half of a lime. Also, I didn't have the fish sauce, so I improvised and boiled the shells/tails of a dozen shrimp with the chicken stock. Seemed delish like that, (sometimes the fish sauce turns me off) so I think I'll stick with this method. And I added cilantro instead of basil and a few tbs of brown sugar. Bottom line--the dish is versatile and really good.

I could NOT get this to taste like anything. I kept adding curry paste, fish sauce, thai basil, brown sugar, and eventually garlic, but something was definately missing. It could be my fault; I used tofu and mung bean noodles instead of chicken and I know they have less flavor, but I think there were just some ingredients missing - like lemongrass and maybe something else. I'm not going to even bother trying again.

i've made hundreds of delicious epicurious recipes, and without doubt, this is one of the best ever. use real thai red curry paste and a LOT more than it says  i used about 3 tbs, but also more coconut milk and more broth. add a little lime at the end and maybe some bean thread or rice noodles and you have a fabulous complete meal!

I like it spicey so I added an extra 1/2 tbsp of red curry paste + a good pinch of crushed chillies. Also changed out the corn oil for olive oil and a bit of butter,the eggplant and green beans for 1 onion and 10 mushrooms.I cut the coconut milk to 1 can,and used 4 cups of chicken broth. Then added 1/2 cup of Basmati Rice. Oh ya ...I used tarragon instead of Basil. MMMM this was tastey. A definite keeper!

Mmmm, I'm eating this soup right now and its delicious. I made the following alterations which worked out really well: I used 2 cans coconut instead of 3. I didn't use any eggplant or greenbeans. Instead I used one green bell pepper and one white onion(sliced into thin strips), a can of bamboo shoots (you can find these in the Asian food section of most grocery stores)and one package of sliced mushrooms. I also added sliced green onion and 2 diced serrano chilies . I added the juice from 3 limes and a little sugar and lots of pepper to increase the flavor. When the soup was done I added a couple of handfuls of cilantro to the pot. I'm going to continue making this soup the exact same way, its delicious!!

I've been making this for several years now. Every time I make it, I have to tweak it due to the red curry having different degrees of hotness. I use straw mushrooms in place of green beans and cilantro in place of basil. I use a massive amount of lime juice because I like the citrus bite to it countering the heat. I also increase the coconut milk to chicken stock ratio--1 can coconut milk to 2 c. chick stock. I use a whole bunch fresh cilantro too.

Very ordinary. There are better Thai curry and curry-inspired soup recipes out there.

Rating: 4
I forgot to add that the spiciness of this dish really depends upon the brand of red curry paste you use. I used the Thai Kitchen brand, and it was very very spicy -- so much so that I added about 2 tablespoons of sugar to calm it down, and even then it still had a good punch to it.

I was trying to duplicate my husband's favorite Thai string bean curry from our local take-out place, and, with a few modifications, this fit the bill perfectly. To make a thicker curry, rather than a soup, I used 2 cups of each liquid and added a corn flour slurry at the end to thicken it up. I omitted the eggplant, and used about a 1/2 pound of green beans. I added 2 kaffir lime leaves instead of the basil, and the outcome was fantastic. My husband loved it. The next day he poured the leftovers over some rice noodles and that was great as well. This is definitely a keeper!

This is a great base to do whatever you choose! I took the basic recipe and made a few modifications - by far the best Thai red curry dish I've made to date. I cut the coconut milk, and broth in half to 1.5 cups of each (makes it heartier) For veggies I used about 5 large mushrooms sliced, 1 large japanese eggplant, and 1 onion sliced. I followed all the same instructions, adding about 2 extra tsps of fish oil, 1 tbsp of brown sugar, and the juice of one lime. I also had some dry kaffirlime that I had kicking around that I threw in- but that wouldn't be needed to taste great. I also like to throw the basil in about 5-6 minutes into the simmer time - I find it adds a lot of flavor to the dish. It's a fabulous dish, and a must try!

At what point does it no longer count as being the same recipe? I started with this recipe, but like everyone else, I made many substitutions and additions. I used coconut oil instead of corn oil, cilantro instead of basil, potatos and mushrooms instead of eggplant, and I added lime juice and brown sugar. . . but the rest was pretty much the same. :) I guess the idea is if you sautee chicken in red curry paste, then add broth, coconut milk and a bunch of veggies and thai seasonings, it is going to taste pretty darn good.

Rating: 4
Great recipe - quick and easy. Like everyone, I added lime juice, a little brown sugar, lemongrass (2 stalks) and changed out the vegetables. For ease, I used frozen red, yellow and green pepper strips from Trader Joe's and baby corn and bamboo shoots. Wonderful!

I'm a college student who lives in a dorm, and I don't have access to a lot of cooking supplies. I decided that after almost a month of eating in the Cafeteria to go invest in pots and make some food. This was a perfect idea, because I was able to make a good amount for under $20 (yeah Chinatown!), and it's such a flexible recipe that you can do almost anything you want with it. We added an onion, and extra chicken. My tip would be to let it sit for a while, because it becomes more flavorful the longer you let it sit around.

I made this soup to use fresh eggplant from my garden. I also changed the recipe a little, based on other's comments. I omitted the green beans, added extra chopped basil, and added cilantro, brown sugar, lime juice, lemongrass and galangal. Nice additions and a very tasty soup!

I've had some red curry paste that has been burning a hole in my pantry. Finally, I found this recipe which seemed perfect for a novice thai cook. I used shitake mushrooms, red pepper, cilantro, brown sugar and lime juice as suggested. My husband loved the results...but I put way too much red curry paste in it making it too spicy to enjoy. Will make it again, not so much curry paste!

This recipe was a lifesaver. I was making chicken coconut soup from memory, trying to copy soups I've had at local Thai restaurants. Something was missing. It turned out to be basil. What I already had in the pot was almost identical to the recipe except I used 2 10oz packages of frozen thai vegetables (green beans, onions, bean sprouts and carrots) dried mushrooms and I had already added lime juice. After reading the recipe I added another can of coconut milk. I also added 1 cup of uncooked basmatti rice to make it more filling

After all the rave reviews, I am very disappointed with this recipe. Can other cooks please tell me what brand of coconut milk they're using? I used unsweeted; half regular and half lite. The coconut flavour overpowered the soup. I think the recipe has potential but next time I'd rather eat it at a restaurant.

Rating: 3
Very simple and tasty. I ran short of coconut milk and filled in with chicken broth. I also didn't have any japanese eggplant, but I had lots of green beans. Next time I'll plan ahead and make it as written. My husband raved.

My husband and I loved this dish with rice on the side. I used green beans, shitake mushrooms and red pepper. I also added some brown sugar (about 2 spoonfuls) which gave it just a little bit of sweet to go with the spicy. I will definitely make this again!

Some changes I made, only had 1 of lite coconut milk, I used that and halved the chicken broth. Also, Used salmon instead, pan-seared salmon seperately, spritzed with lime juice cubed and added to curry after eggplants had cooked for about 5 mins. Can't wait to experiment with other veggies.

I have made this many times and I love it. I went to an Asian market and got some lime leaf and galangal which only makes it better. The lime juice is a must, I think. I sometimes also serve it over rice, to make it more of a meal.

UMMMMM YUM UMMMMM Wow this soup is great especially after reading the other reviewers and adding lime juice and cilantro I also added lemongrass and snow peas (at the end for crunch) and next time will add bean sprouts too Really Really good next time might up the curry paste a notch or throw in a chili pepper or two

I love this soup..it's turned into an old standby. I did change the recipe a bit though....I add prawns and clams towards the end and omit the chicken entirely. I also add lime leaves, cane sugar, and use hericot verts in exchange for the green beans. I serve it over jasmine rice. Delicious!

My friends and I ate this soup often while stationed in Seoul, Korea at Thai Orchid in Itaewon. Now back in the States, I wanted to try to make it. This recipe is a great starting point. I found the best mix was 1 can coconut milk to 2 c. chicken broth. I make my own with boullion cubes to cut down cost of dish. Used shitake mushrooms in place of green beans and eggplant, and a little bit of white onion. Used whole bunch of fresh cilantro in place of basil. The lime is a definite must, used two whole limes. It was just like I remember, only soup in Seoul had something a little crunchy in it that I can't place. This is definitely a great recipe and really easy to make. I'm going to try it over rice as well.

Yummy and easy. Go ahead and either add or substitute some fresh, peeled shrimp at the end. If you do, simmer the chicken broth with the shells first for some great flavor.

Great way to use Thankgiving reruns. In order to duplicate dish we had at restaurant, substituted cooked pumpkin for eggplant, turkey for chicken and used only 2 cups of stock and 1 can of cocanut milk for thicker, more intense sauce. Served with jasmine rice. YUM

To Shylo: you can't find the answer to your question because you're spelling "pad thai" improperly. The search won't work if you don't spell things exactly right. Punch in "pad thai" spelled that way, and you'll come up with two recipes. By the way, pad thai is a noodle dish-- and a good one.

FANTASTIC! So easy and incredibly authentic. I used it as an "I-don't-have-anything-in-the-cupboards" alternative, so instead of green beans, I used 1/2 red and 1/2 green pepper left in my fridge. I used fresh cilantro instead of the basil. I cut the recipe 'in half' (used 1 can broth, 1 can coconut milk for simplicity's sake) which wasn't directly proportional to exactly 1/2 of the curry paste I added, so it was really spicy but thankfully cleared up my cold! :) It was PLENTY for two of us. We spooned the soup over a bed of rice and devoured it!!!! ...and I hope the last reviewer figured out how to find 'paad thai'... because this definitely would be a great compliment for a full-fledged Thai meal!

After reading these reviews I am definitely going to make this soup! Someone suggested serving this with spring rolls and phad thai. My question is, "What is phad thai?" I am unable to find the answer either under 'recipe search' or the dictionary. Thanks, Shylo

I lived in Thailand for a year and a half and am very critical of most "Thai" recipes, but I have to say this one rocks! It is very similar to the Thai Tom Ka Gai. I would recommend adding babu corn and bamboo shoots, and perhaps bypass the green beans unless they are lush and fresh. I made this for a cooking class I taught and got mugged for the leftovers afterward.

My cooking track record tends to stay steady at 1-1 (one success per one failure.) This was a failure, through no fault of the recipe, I suspect. I used low-fat coconut milk and ended up using a little too much fish sauce, so the soup was kind of thin and fishy. Agh. I'll try it again and follow the recipe more closely. Note to self: Mastery before Improvisation.

Incredible soup! I'm stingy w/ my forks too. I've made this soup on numerous occasions, and I just cannot get enough of it. I make it "as is" and don't believe it needs adjusting (except for maybe a tad bit more curry paste to fire it up a bit). Try it, you'll love it!

Great Soup! I've had 3 bowls already tonight and I just might go back for 4ths. I also added fresh corn and shitake mushrooms to the mix and subsituted cilantro for the basil. A squeeze of lime just before eating was yummy. This recipe was suprisingly easy!

How to wreck this recipe: Using canned green beans instead of fresh was a bad idea unless you really like tuna noodle casserole type comfort food. Halving the liquids and adding rice made it mucky. What really worked well was the Thai fresh basil.

So easy, so lip-smacking good. We just finished a bowl each and found it ard to believe. We used a little lime at last minute, as suggested, and Thai basil, not Italian, living in walking distance of Whole Foods Supermarket and Reading Terminal Market in Center City Philly. A little pad thai and perhaps two or three dumplings or spring rolls and you are set to entertain. I added a slight amount of salt and fresh ground pepper to my bowl and it improved it even more.
