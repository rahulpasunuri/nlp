Doubled the ginger, halved the white sugar. Results were excellent. Like a cookie in ice cream form.

After reading the thoughts of other reviewers, made this without the 2 tbs. of regular sugar (to avoid it being overly sweet), and doubled the ginger. These adjustments seemed to work, as the finished product was just sweet enough, and the ginger was subtle but present. Used a vanilla bean, and scraped the seeds into the custard as it cooked on the stove. Also used half dark brown and half light brown sugar, to produce a cream-colored ice cream (instead of brown, as it appears in the photo). Overall, though, the ice cream lacked any kind of aftertaste, and tasted like egg nog (not that that's such a bad thing). If I'm going to bother making a vanilla ice cream, it's got to have more of a lingering, creamy aftertaste to warrant the effort.

Although the ginger doesn't come through, the flavor and texture are excellent; and not too sweet. I used half-and-half instead of the milk and cream and got great results. I will definately make this again.

Wow. Great ice cream. Goes really well with the caramelized pineapple recipe associated with it. Also great by itself, or with toasted coconut.

This was very creamy and tasty. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to double the recipe.

This was a very disappointing recipe. The ice cream is too sweet, and you can't taste the ginger at all. I used a vanilla bean in addition to the vanilla extract, and there STILL wasn't enough flavor. Texture is fine, just bland.
