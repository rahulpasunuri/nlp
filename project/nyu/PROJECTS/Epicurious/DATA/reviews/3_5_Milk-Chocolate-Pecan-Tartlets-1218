I didn't have the right size tart pans, I have 12cm (about 5") pans so I had to change the recipe a bit to account for that. I added more cream to the chocolate mixture. I also didn't have pecans and used almonds instead. I even used ground almond flour in the crust. I have to say that with these changes, the tarts were pretty good. The crusts were excellent. They were very sweet so using a low-sugar brand of preserves helps. I think if I were to make them again, I'd buy the correct size tart pans. These would be really good if they were very small and served with other types of little tarts on a dessert tray.

This is fantastic! The flavours combine beautifully and the toasted pecans give the crust a delicious depth. Be sure to use European choclate, even though its more expensive: when melted, it has a different consistency than our North American choc. I used ED Smith's "no Sugar Added Apricot Spread" for the preserves (very flavourful, not jammy.)I made this dessert for my Mum's birthday and it was a hit all round, even with those who weren't sweet-tooths.

Wonderful and easy dessert or treat. I did have to substitute almonds for the pecans (thought I had pecans in the freezer, but didn't). The tarts are pretty and really, really yummy!
