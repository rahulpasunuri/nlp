I was questioning the recipe on the part where you throw in a bunch of veggies, including mushrooms, which sweats a lot, after the braising process, but I followed the recipe anyway. My hunch was correct. I threw all the initial veggies for braising in the food processor (I added a fennel bulb and more garlic), and browned the pulp after the meat before braising, and it perfumed the entire house! The meat was delicious upon braising, but after cooking the additional vegetables, all of the essential flavors were watered down. I do like the fact that the veggies were still "meaty" when the dish was served, but to preserve the flavor, I would perhaps brown the veggies first and let them sweat a bit before adding to the braise. Also, I like the bacon fat idea, but I couldn't quite taste or smell it by the end, so I'm thinking about cutting up the browned bacon into bits and throwing them in at the end with some fresh chopped parsley for a big finishing touch.

Yummm! And tasted even better the next day and day after. I used Osso bucco since that was the only meat I had in the freezer. And I only had about 1 pound, so I roughly half the recipe. I didn't have red wine, I used white wine instead. Still Yummy. My husband and my son loved it. We loved the sauce, so the next day I added the sauce to the left-over meat and veggies, thickened it using the left-over flour from meat coating. tasty! Will definitely make it again. Next time will use red wine.

Yum! Made exactly as written with three minor exceptions: only had 3.6 lbs of tails, used a Pinot Noir as the wine and used jarred minced garlic instead. Served with garlic couscous--perfect!

Nice recipe, with a few tweaks. Oxtails are so fatty it helps to braise them first, then cool, refrigerate and remove layer of fat. No need to add butter paste to thicken, as it's rich enough as is; a bit of flour to thicken is sufficient. Use whatever compatible veggies you have on hand, such as a parsnip or two, celery, etc. Pinch of cayenne and dash of Worcestershire sauce add depth.

This was wonderful. I tossed in the the cooked bacon but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. A keeper for sure.

I'd like to give this 3.5 forks. Made this very close to the exact recipe, but subbed a roast I had in the freezer that I needed to use. I've made oxtails before and love them, I can only imagine how tasty they would be in this recipe. I'd bump up the nutmeg next time (maybe mine is a little old and not as strong as it should have been.) I added fingerling potatoes with the carrot chunks, and some chunks of celery and peas for more color just before I added the flour paste.

Made this recipe tonight and it was a big hit. I did braise it in the oven instead of on the stove, for less burning on the bottom of the pot, and slightly less tending, and that worked out very well. I used beef that I found in the store and it was extremely economical for the bigger sitdown dinner. I had to increase the recipe a little. Flavor was fantastic and someone even noticed the distinctive subtle nutmeg. Excellent winter dish.

I'll admitt that I often passed by oxtails in the meat counter and viewed them with a bit of disdain. It does afterall seem to be a rather lowly cut of meat. But I always wanted to try it. This was a thrilling opportunity that I just couldn't pass on. And Ms. Anderson delivered to us a deliciously devine braise worthy of great praise. "And nutmeg?" I asked, "yes nutmeg." It added an under note to the dish that updated the classic preparation. Now if I could just find those oxtails on sale (I thought $6.50/lb. was a bit steep for a tail), I'll be making this dish time and again.

Great dish to make on a snowy day. We followed the recipe exactly with the exception the we quartered the mushrooms to give more texture. Our shallots were on the large size therefore required a longer cooking time. Make sure the oxtails are meaty and are on the medium to large size. The meat was so tender and the sauce just wonderful. Agree that letting the stew overnight would help with the grease removal. Served with perfect mashed potatoes. A comfort meal

I just finished preparing this dish, and it came out very well. I used only 1 cup of beaujolais (instead of 1.5 cups) and added one cup of water in which I dissolved a pot-au-feu bouillon cube, although I probably should not have added the additional liquid as there was plenty of sauce. I was apprehensive about the nutmeg but it married well with the other ingredients. Removing all the grease from the finished dish was difficult, and it will probably be easier to let the stew get cold and skim the solidified fat from the top. I'm sure the oxtails will improve overnight.
