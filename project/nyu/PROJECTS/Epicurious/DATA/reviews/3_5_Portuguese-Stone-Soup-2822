This is an excellent soup, my new favorite! Like the other reviews suggested, I sauteed the onions with cumin & then added the chorizo to cook with them. I used the baby new potatoes and just added a few more since the store didn't have turnips. I let it cook for the full 2 hours. Will make again, soon.

I thought this was an excellent weeknight meal. I largely followed the recipe except bulking up the vegetables since my family prefers "stew" to "soup." It was a good use of CSA vegetables - and, for a child suspicious of turnips, it was helpful that she couldn't discern between the turnips and the potatoes.

Also, no need to cook it for two hours! One is enough.

Super easy and delicious. Easy substitutions if you don't have the exact ingredients. I used andouille for linguica, northern beans for kidney beans and parsnips for turnips.

Portuguese Stone Soup should be made only with Linguica. It's available in most supermarkets. Other sausages are not authentic.

I thought this was great. I have been looking for recipes to use up the leftovers from our CSA box, and this is it! I bought regular chorizo since the store didn't have anything else. I also cooked it along with the garlic and onions before putting it in the soup. It was great! My husband ate it, and even had seconds. We will definitely make this again! We served it with a tasty, crusty baguette!

I did not think this was that great. It was a rather bland soup in my opinion, and I did add the curry powder.

I've been cooking this recipe for 3 years now, and can honestly say that it has never failed to impress my guests I always saute the chorizo & add cumin to "lift" the flavor. One of the best, if not the best recipes on this site. Martin, Calgary Canada

Definitely add cumin and paprika. We made it with half water and half chicken broth and it was fine. This ia a hearty, REALLY tastey soup. Also, I can like that you can just throw everything in and let it simmer.

I got snowed in today, and this was the perfect soup for comfort. I had to substitute a couple of ingredients--kohlrabi for the turnips, half smoked sausage and half chorizo, great northern beans instead of kidney beans, regular cabbage instead of savoy. I doubled the garlic, added a pinch of red pepper flakes and some cumin and sweet paprika; and, just because it was there, a fennel bulb. The result was a very flavorful and hearty soup that will likely be even better tomorrow. It's very warming and filling--completely satisfying for a snow day!

Highly recommended. I use cannelloni (sp?) beans instead....half whole and half mashed to thicken the soup. I omit the turnips. Tastes best 24-48 hours later.

I loved this soup! A great cool weather recipe - it's a meal in a bowl!

This soup was very good, hearty and perfect for a cold autumn night. We used homemade veggie broth, sauteed the sausage, onions, garlic and leeks before adding them to the soup and added 1/2 tsp. cumin as others recommended. I've never had linguica before and wasn't too sure about it's flavor, so might try chorizo next time. Served with a crusty bread.

I first made this in 2003 as a Christmas dinner starter for my son who at the time didn't like creamy soups. He loved it both for it's excellent flavor and the fact that it reminded us of the "Stone Soup" play was in in kindergarten (the same general story as told by the reviewer from Portugal). It almost made the menu four years later, but he's matured a little and now eats creamy soups as well, so only had to make one soup!! It's great winter fare-just needs a little more than 8 cups of broth.

Excellent soup! The only things I did different were leave out the turnips and used a combination of pasta/potatoes. I also cooked the onions, garlic, and leeks first in olive oil adding the sausage then cabbage and next the rest of the ingredients. Absolutely delicious the next day:)

Please add some pork ribs, beef stock and remove the turnips. Start the soup by frying the chopped onion and garlic in olive oil, then add the chopped meats until sealed. Then add the vegetables, the stock and the seasoning.Simmer for 2- 3 hrs. This is the real portuguese "stone" soup. By the way, this soup has its origin in an ancient story: a pilgrim knocked at a farmer's door and asked for food but the farmer said no; the pilgrim then asked the farmer just for some water and a pot so that he could make some soup with the stone he had in his pouch; the farmer provided the water..but was curious about what kind of a soup resulted from water and a stone; then the pilgrim asked the farmer for 1 potato, just to add flavour, and the farmer gave him 1 potato.. and remained curious; then the pilgrim asked the farmer for 1 small carrot, just to add some colour; and like this... the pilgrim obtained all the ingredients; by now, the soup smelled fantastic; when finished, the pilgrim offered the farmer some soup, which was obviously delicious with so many ingredients; the pilgrim thanked the farmer, removed the stone from the pot, ... and started a new journey.

i'm from that province and the introduction is wrong about the beans look like stone.The soup is called stone soup because is cooked with a real stone.

Perfect soup for the first cool autumn night in Sonoma County! I think the quality of the sausage probably makes all the difference in this soup -- I used Niman Ranch chorizo. Also, I sauteed the sausage with onions and leeks first to render (and thus remove) excess fat. Then I added everything else (but I skipped the turnips). I also added 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin and a bit of sweet paprika. End result was delightfully spicy, thanks to the flavorful chorizo.

Oops, I forgot to state that I added: 1 teaspoon of freshly ground cumin and a pinch of hot pepper flakes or powder. Cumin is an important addition and made it as we remembered it.

Fab! Reminded me of the stone soup I had in Portugal. The friends who travelled with me on that trip also loved the soup for the same reason. Will definitely make this again.

This soup is so tasty! I made it with linguica and wouldn't change a thing.

I was really disappointed in this soup. I felt it was very flat, didn't have much flavor at all, even though I seasoned it with plenty of salt and pepper. It did redeem itself the next day, however. It tasted much better, but I don't think I will make it again.

I give this recipe four stars because it is so easy to make but with delicious results. You can substitute veggies and beans that you have on hand which is great. I definately agree with the comment other cooks made that the chorizo/sausgae that you pick is important as it really flavors the soup. A perfect meal on a rainy day or a cool evening.

I made this soup over a year ago, and I still think about it, I had to find the recipe again for dinner tonight, SO GOOD!

This recipe was DELICIOUS! I didn't have a turnip so I left it out but this soup didn't miss it. The broth was rich and flavorful and the rest of the soup was so good for you too!! I used turkey kilbasa and cooked it the full two hours. This will become a regular meal at our house. Excellent comfort food. YUM!!

This is good even if you can only find chorizo or andouille, but linguica makes it truly excellent. And good bread is a must, whether it's crusty for dipping, or just soft on the side. YUM.

So much depends upon the kind of sausage used in this recipe. Chorizo is best.

Rating: 3
Very close to a version made by dear Portugese friends. Like other commentator, they (and I) used pasta instead of potatoes, and mixed linguica and chorizo. Also, when serving, offer a splash of vinegar or olive oil steeped with garlic. Serve with warm portugese bread and butter... mmmmmmmmm...

I made this yesterday and all I can say is WOW. I used hot and spicy Linguica which gave it just a little kick. I can't wait to have it for dinner tonight. I suspect it will be even better the 2nd day. Great recipe!

Lots of chopping but worth the effort if you're looking for a flavorful soup perfect for a snowy night. Used turkey kielbasa, regular cabbage, and no turnips - the addition of some pasta might be nice too.

I haven't tried this particular recipe yet, but am glad I found it. I lived in Hawaii many years ago and loved the local rendition of Portuguese Bean Soup. Unfortunately, I lost my recipe, and have been longing to make some. If my memory serves me, in Hawaii we used ham hocks to season the broth and often pasta in place of pototoes. Any Island folks out there who would help me out? Thanks! Aloha!

I was looking for a good hearty cabbage/vegetable soup recipe and found it. I also managed to find linguica and it was great, but I used a 12 oz package sliced thin and that was plenty for me. I used a 19 ounce can of kidney beans; the smaller can may not be enough. The soup was a hit at the office soup party.

We love this and it is so easy. Even better as leftovers. I have substituted regular cabbage for the savoy and it didn't seem to hurt it any.

We LOVE this recipe in my house. The only changes I ever make are to use a larger can of beans and I usually try to use the whole head of cabbage, so as not to waste... One of the greatest things about it is how the flavors mature after the first serving. I freeze half, and it comes out of the freezer even better than it went in. Serve with crusty bread toasted and scraped with fresh garlic -- Awesome!

We served this soup for a progressive dinner over the holidays. It was perfect! Everyone eats appetizers and then dessert and the dinner needed to be light. Several of us had never eaten turnips and were surprised. A few didn't eat spicy foods and even with Mexican chorizo it appealed to everyone. It was easy and delicious.

I liked the soup (and I especially liked that it used winter vegetables), but I think the recipe is actually 2 1/2 forks (I'm rounding up). I just felt that it needed...something. It was just a little bit boring for my tastes even after seasoning with salt and pepper. I used linguica (available in my very Brazilian neighborhood), so it was probably as "authentic" as can be. (Not that that really matters -- if it tastes good...who cares?)

Fantastic! I got Spanish Chorizo and increased the garlic. I also used dried Kidney beans soaked the night before and boiled to fairly soft.

We were stunned by this soup. The flavors meld so well, and turnips have never tasted so good. Just kidding, I really like turnips, actually, but these taste different, and they are almost falling apart-- different from how I have had them before. We loved it. I didn't have time to get Spanish chorizo, nor could I get Portugese Chorico, but I did get Mexican chicken chorizo at Whole Foods, and it was great. Actually, the chicken chorizo rounds out the flavor of the chicken broth. Here in Texas, quality Mexican chorizo abounds, and I think the flavor is just divine in the soup. I also doubled the garlic and added crushed red pepper. Definitely a do-again recip

Made this for a playoff football game gathering at our house. Everyone really liked it & wanted the receipe.

While this soup may be tasty, the traditional version does not use premade chicken stock or broth- the only substitute that would keep the flavor of the linguiça sausage would be a Spanish chorizo, if the Portuguese chouriço was unavailable. Substituting a different ethnic ingredient changes the recipe. Once you add pepperoncini, feta cheese, keilbasa sausage or other ethnic substitutions you can no longer call the soup Portuguese. The flavor is different. Eastern and western European flavors differ. Only as a last resort substitute and then call it an adaptation or Portuguese-like -please don't call it authentic. By the way, most countries have their own versions of Stone Soup

I have had this soup at Napi's Restaurant on Cape Cod. This recipe is very similar except Napi also adds tomatoes and would never add anything other than a good high quality linguica which is Portuguese garlic sausage. He also used kale (which I have heard called green cabbage in Europe) instead of napa. As my employee meal, I would have this soup with bread, pepperoncinis, dried tomatoes in oil and feta cheese at least twice a week.

My family and I thought this was an excellent soup. I used the suggestion of a half cup of white wine and found that the cook who suggested that was right on the mark. It did balance the flavors. My husband took some of the soup to work and his coworkers tried it and demanded the recipe. They all have made it since and agree that it is delicious. We'll be making it again very soon.

This turned out better than I expected. I used canned chicken broth and kielbasa, but thought it initially tasted too "chickeny" and greasy. I added about a half cup of white wine and it seemed to balance the flavors.

Easy to make, appeals to the eye and eats great. No leftovers! Never knew that I liked turnips. At least not the way my mom used to serve them. A wonderful thing to be able to do, adding a vegetable to my "tastes good" list. A must try it for those that enjoy a hearty soup that warms both the tummy and the face with smiles. Doesn't need any alterations, yet suggests so many other possibities for the creative cook.
