This is one of my favorite "adult" cookie recipes. Using supermarket cocoa yields a bland, dusty nugget. However, a premium cocoa, such as Valhrona, adds much more flavor and richness, taking it to another level. Inserting a small chunk of chocolate in the center of each ball goes even further. My only criticism it that they're not nearly as good after the first day.

very good. it definitely is basically a brownie cookie, but in our house we like that quite a bit. don't really taste the rum, but that is ok too. easy and quick to make as well.

So boring! These are just like very basic brownies. Maybe more rum would have helped, but they are nothing special at all. Good thing I made chocolte-orange biscotti as a backup!

This was excellent as a Christmas cookie. Very, very chocolate-y, kind of like a brownie but better. I won' t hesitate to make them again this December.

kind of like a soft crumbly brownie, with a wonderful buttery taste. dark and chocolatey and not too sweet. they're not my favorite kind of cookie, but everyone else loved them. i think that adding some finely chopped pecans or walnuts would improve the texture.
