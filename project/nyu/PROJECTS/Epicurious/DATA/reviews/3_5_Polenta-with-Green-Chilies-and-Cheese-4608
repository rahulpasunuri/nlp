Yum! Made a great vegetarian meal. We used skim milk, fat free half and half and pepper jack. Will make again. Husband is in food coma :)

I brought this to a company potluck and everyone loved it. I am a bit confused though, why the recipe calls for cornmeal and not polenta - 2 completely different ingredients. I think next time I'll use polenta since it didn't set very well. After all, that's what the recipe is called and refers to in the preparation!

I made this last minute for a mexican themed dinner... I did not have cornmeal so I used prepared (packaged) polenta, creamed it with half & half and other ingredients. I omitted the cream when layering. It was a big hit and everyone loved it even if they weren't big polenta fans!

We made it with rice cheese instead of dairy cheese (dairy-intolerant guests), and water instead of milk. it was great, everybody loved it!

This was fantastic. I served it as a side with a chicken dish and it was the star of the dinner. I used diced chilies and all (fat free) milk - no water. I'm not really sure that the cream is necessary.

A terrific polenta recipe. Great because you can prepare it ahead of time and put it in the oven with great results. Everyone raved about it.

Kids and adults have loved this casserole. I made it a day ahead to take to a family reunion. Served it with picante sauce on the side and tortilla chips.

Outstanding dish.Everyone loved it, even my husband who does not like polenta. Try it for breakfast, reheated in microwave. Half and Half instead of cream works fine.

yum! didn't have a 8" x 8" pan, used a 9" glass pie plate & it was fine. I'm anxious to try different variations; caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, mozz cheese. Very good, looking forward to leftovers tonight!

For a little punch, I used Pepper Jack. The end result was a bit runny, so next time I'll thicken the polenta more &/or cook it for longer. Not a beautiful presentation, but good comfort food.

This is the *best* recipe I've ever found on Epicurious!! I (and all who taste it) adore it. I cringe to mess with perfection, but I toss in a handful of currants on top of all the other delicious components...

Very flavorful--the ultimate comfort food on a cold, dark, rainy evening, at the end of the day. I used my own hand-picked, home-roasted chiles, which may have intensified the flavor. Very easy to make.

This is a keeper. Quick, easy and oh, so tasty. Instead of making the polenta, I used a tube of Sun Dried Tomato Polenta I had on hand. I cut it up and added 1/4 cup water and microwaved it to soften. I used a fork to get an even consistency and added dribbles of water as I worked it to get it to the consistency I wanted. I added the Parmesan cheese to the polenta as per the recipe. From this point I followed the recipe. In New Mexico we have access to outstanding frozen green chile which is far superior to the canned varieties. One local source I know of that ships out of state is www.buenofoods.com. The portions were perfect for a main dish served with a large tossed salad.

I make this dish often for get togethers. It always gets rave reviews. For a lighter version, I substitute the whole milk with skim and use a light version of the Monterey Jack cheese. You could probably substitute the cream with half and half, but I haven't tried this yet. Although the lower fat version is not as good as the full fat, it's still delicious.

This is a great side dish. I'm not a vegetarian but crave this dish. I've served it along side a grilled steak and have had rave reviews. I backed off a little on the cilantro, but other than that this is yummy!

Though not bad, I didn't think this was anything to get excited about.
