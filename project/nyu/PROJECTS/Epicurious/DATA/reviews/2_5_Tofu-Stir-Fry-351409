This was a really amazing dish! The flavors appealed even to my two little boys... I actually did not have any bell peppers, chestnuts or baby corn, but I substituted with broccoli, cauliflower, carrots. The tofu was delicious cooked this way because it had this really nice crispiness to it which is great when you eat something like tofu. I also used soba noodles. Yum!

I thought this was great, but I had to add chicken because by the time the tofu was done and set aside it was immediatley gobbled up. I think the chicken inhanced the recipe though. Also I didn't add the orange zest, the corn or the chestnuts because I got lazy at the end but I think they would be a great addition.

The white miso paste left white little bits all over the food.

This recipe is rather simple and I have done similar things with tofu myself. It is one of those, "preference type things where you can play around with it and come up with something to each persons liking.

Not bad for a tofu recipe. Obviously the two previous reviewers have not made the recipe at all. I don't understand the hatred that they spewed forth.This is a dish that can easily be added to based on your preferences for spiceness, herbs, etc.

I will give making tofu this way a try, but otherwise this looks pretty uninspired. It's this kind of dish that scares people away from tofu and other veggie dishes.

If you want to pep up the flavor try adding a few drops of hot pepper oil

BORING!!! There are so many better ways to cook with tofu. And why was this one chosen for recipe of the day? Please have better consumer testing BEFORE listing recipes!

I had high hopes for this recipe but it was just okay and it took me awhile to chop everything. The tofu actually tastes great though, I might just fry it up like that instead of a chicken cutlet type dish..
