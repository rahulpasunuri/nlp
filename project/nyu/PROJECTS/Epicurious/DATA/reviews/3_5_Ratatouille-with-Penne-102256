This is the first recipe for roasted ratatouille that I have seen. Why have I never roasted the vegetables before? Once I saw it, it seemed obvious. The taste is noticeably better, right out of the pot. My old recipe needed a day for the flavors to develop. This is my new go-to ratatouille recipe.

I'll keep this recipe - very good. I cut back and used 1 of each vegetable (only 3 of us eating) and added green beans, zucchini instead of yellow squash, added carrots. I also used a large can of tomatoes with/ juice and added a splash of chardonnay wine! I kept my pasta separate but next time I would add as the recipe suggests to let the flavor absorb into pasta. Definitely a keeper recipe!

Excellent recipe, but taste and texture of yellow squash do not ring true. Zucchini is much more traditional. Mom was raised in southern France, so call me prejudiced.

Outstanding flavor and texture. Best ratatouille recipe I have ever seen

I was never a big fan of ratatouille before, but that was because I hadn't made this version! You do need to keep an eye on the vegetables to make sure they don't overcook, but roasting them really concentrates and brings out the flavour! I found there wasn't enough "sauce" to seve it over pasta, but over cheesy polenta, it was delicious!!

Easy and delicious. Mostly hands off after cutting the vegetables.

Wonderful ratatouille recipe! I too had fresh organic garden eggplants and peppers, I think they are key to the success of this recipe. I used fresh tomatoes but no squash, as I didn't have any. I also did not use basil (the thyme and parsley were absolutely perfect here). Huge hit with the kids as well. Will definitely make again and for many years to come.

Roasting brings out the essence of all of these vegetables. I cut the eggplant down to one and roasted the tomatoes and garlic directly in the pan with the rest of the vegetables, adding just a small amount of tomato paste to thicken. Will probably skip the pasta altogether and make sandwiches either with Parmesan shavings, provolone or feta/goat cheese.

this recipe is really good with some motzarella and parmesean on top and sprinkle with some parsley.

THE best Ratatouille recipe I've made. I too, used Muir Glen canned tomatoes, added the juices and then 2 T. tomato paste to thicken it. I also added more thyme and served it with a very good israeli feta from Trader Joes (the best feta ever) on top. My 9 year old said it was his new favorite. Be still my heart!

This was by far the best Ratatouille recipe I've ever made. I was fortunate to have garden fresh organic eggplant and peppers to use, and they were so wonderfully flavorful. Didn't have any squash, but we didn't miss it. I used a large can of Muir Glen organic stewed tomatoes instead of fresh, used all 7 cloves of garlic, and dried thyme and basil. Also threw in a few capers. Served with penne and freshly grated Parmigiano Reggianio. My husband raved. Will never use another Ratatouille recipe again! Fantastic.

Great ratatouille -- over pasta or on its own. I've never understood the need to peel tomatoes in a rustic dish though so I saved the time and didn't bother.

Love this recipe, though sometimes I substitute eggplant with roasted red peppers for color. The order is important in order to get each vegetable to retain its own flavor. Nice summer dish. It's also not a crime to drop the thyme.

this recipe is fantastic! i modified it quite a lot though ... i made it for someone who can't have salt but it survived very well. as well as eliminating the salt, i cut the oil by more than half (i drizzled enough to coat when tossed by no more). i only used one eggplant, added zucchini and spinach. i used the canned tomatoes as well (no salt added) and just added them in as well as the herbs and garlic (4 cloves rather than seven, pounded and left largely whole rather than minced) for the final 25 minutes in the oven. the vegetables are so flavourful and shouldn't be overpowered by garlic. i made the penne for him, but i enjoyed it with just a bit of fresh bread. i will definitely make this again!

This recipe was a huge hit with the 9-11 year old cooking classes I teach. No problems getting them to eat their veggies.

Roasting the vegetables makes this recipe easy, quick, and so much more flavorful than sauteeing on the stove. Using canned tomatoes made the recipe a breeze, and it didn't take nearly the hour and a half it suggests. Served with a hot crusty baguette (without the pasta) this is a fresh, light, delicious way to serve spring vegetables. Will definitely make this again!!!

This is an excellent ratatouille recipe. I served it just after making it, straight up, and also reheated after 3 days. Both times it was great. The vegetables were cooked but not soggy; the crunch of the peppers and the "meatiness" of the eggplant meshed well with the softer squash and the tomatos. It didn't need pasta at all, though I'm sure it would be good that way too. Look out for indigestion if you are not used to eating healthy, there's a lot of fiber in here and it's a bit on the acidic side. Next time I'll add mushrooms and maybe parsnips.

I like the idea of roasting the vegetables, but agree with one writer that the cubes should be bigger (or the roasting time shorter). The dish needs a good amount of salt. For the writer who said that cilantro is flat-leafed parsley, it's not.

I followed the advice of several reviewers and added pepper flakes, oregano, basil, artichoke hearts and 1/3 c red wine to the tomatoes. I also cut the eggplant to only one. It was wonderful.

This was my very first taste of ratatouille and I loved it. The serving size was too large for me so I eyed it and used 2/3 an eggplant, 1/2 yellow squash, 1/2 pepper, canned tomatoes, 4 cloves of garlic (garlic lover here) and red wine. Good for 2-3 people. I will make this again!

This was a very tasty way to celebrate summer vegetables. I used only one eggplant, one whole can of plum tomatoes and 2 zucchini instead of yellow squash. I added 1/4 C. red wine to the tomato mixture and 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes and dried basil instead of fresh. It had a lot of flavor and just the right amount of moisture.

I agree with another reviewer who thought there was too much pasta. I started to mix in the pasta and ended up leaving a lot out because I didn't want it to become too bland. It was a tasty recipe.

So delicious and flavorful. I made with whole wheat penne and felt virtuous eating it, and I also discovered that the leftovers taste good cold.

This turned out well with a few modifications...for a little more zest I added artichoke hearts to the tomatoes while cooking (one can water-packed, drained, chopped). I didn't have fresh thyme, so I raided the spice rack and added oregano and Italian seasoning to the tomato mixture as well. The flavors melded well and the ratatouille turned out rich and flavorful. Use a high quality olive oil - the recipe calls for enough of it to notice the taste!

Instead of plum tomatoes, I used a can of tomatoes and simmered them, in their juice, with a 1/4 c red wine. This added a nice robust taste to the roasted veg. Overall, very pleased with this recipe and I'd make it again.

Just so-so, didn't love it. Way too much time for mediocre results. It would make more sense to use canned chopped tomates with jalepenos, that would give it some kick and save wasted peeling time. I would not make this recipe again.

I LOVED this recipe. It does look a little mushy, but has great flavor. I used acorn squash instead of yellow (what a bear to peel!--not again). Next time I would add more tomatoes or canned with sauce as it seemed a little drier than I would like, but taste was great. Lends itself to substitution and use of whatever veggies you have handy.

dazed and confused with the amount of summer veggies i had on hand.....really loved this recipe; modified it to what was in the frig, grilled them all outside ..loved the tips about balsmaic and adding some red pepper flakes. Served over jasmine rice. This is a keeper.

Instead of roasting the vegetables, I brushed them with olive oil & Balsamic vinegar, then grilled them outside. Also, simmered some chopped tomatoes, garlic, wine,fresh basil & the parsley in a pot, then added the chopped grilled vegetable. It was wonderful. Didn't even need the pasta.

I made this for a dinner party (without the penne) and they loved it. I used herbes de provence indtead of the thyme (and served it with scalloped potatoes with goat cheese and herbes de provence). I loved it and would make it again, if I were to add the penne I think I would use many more tomatoes.

Way too much pasta called for in this recipe. One pound would have been plenty. Someone also mentioned that flat leaf parsley was cilantro--Nope. Flat leaf parsley is Italian parsley. Cilantro would give it a very different taste, perhaps an improvement.

This is the best ratatouille recipe I've ever tried. Roasting the veggies makes the difference and is well worth the effort. The cilantro (flat leaf parsley)added at the end adds an exotic touch. I used zucchini instead of yellow squash and used one red, one yellow and 2 green peppers. Both times I've made it guests have raved and taken the recipe home with them. It's an especially good recipe when entertaining vegetarians.

This could be done with a lot less fuss, and quicker, on the stove. Not worth having the oven at 450 for an hour. I didn't think roasting the vegs made a difference to the taste.

It was a little bit more work than I anticpated, but the results were worth it. I used a smaller eggplant and added some peeled cubed butternut squash. Next time I would completely omit the eggplant and use more butternut squash. I also added some tomato paste from the tube as well.

This is fabulous! I made this ratatouille for a luncheon party as an accompaniment. I doubled the recipe, adding 3 lb of squash (both yellow and green) and also added green bell pepper along with the red. I also added about 2T. of Balsamic Vinegar to the sauce which added zip. This is a wonderful make ahead dish. I cooked both the ratatouille and the pasta, refrigerated them separatly, then combined right before serving. I heated in the microwave, and served accompanied with lots of freshly grated cheese. Everyone loved this and wanted the recipe!

What a wonderful recipe for your Vegan/Vegetarian friends. For Vegans, simply omit the cheese. This is fairly simple - even my son can make it. Absolutely essential to use fresh herbs - it makes a difference in the flavor, but you could use dried if it is not possible, of course. It is a bit forgiving if you leave the vegetables in the oven with the heat turned off if you are late with the pasta! I am adding this to my "favorites"!

This sounded great and the flavor wasn't bad but I was disappointed in the consistency. If I were to make it again, considering the roasting time, I would make larger cubes when cutting up the vegies. I was also concerned about the amount of salt called for. I used very little. It wasn't bad just not as good as expected.
