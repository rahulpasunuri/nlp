First of all, web editor, please fix the misspelling in the title. It's bulgur, not bulgar. Like most reviewers, I didn't bother trying to duplicate the "sandwich" effect with the two portabella caps. It just seemed silly. Rather, I made the recipe pretty much as written and mounded the salad on one grilled portabella cap. Very nice, and I do think the grilled mushroom added a nice note. I didn't bother peeling the mushroom (heavens!) but did remove the gills. All in all, a bit of an effort, but the final result was delicious and I will probably make it again.

Delicious, healthy and easy to make! Like other reviewers I didn't bother to make a 'sandwich'. Instead I marintated then grilled the portabellas and sliced those up with the other veggies. I didn't have pine suts so I substituted walnuts. This was fun for my husband and I to make together - he grilled and I did everything else. It was also quite filling. It will definitely be a regular summer dish in our house. I'm thrilled to have found a great dish with bulgar.

I made this with Israeli cous cous and it was a big hit. I also cut up the mushrooms. Another great Grimes recipe!

Loved, loved, loved the bulgur wheat salad (the avocado is an amazing touch). I used walnuts because pine nuts are hard to find (and expensive!) this summer. I also made the portobello but was not thrilled with it. The salad is the hero here and I will make it in the future as a stand-alone recipe. The only drawback for the recipe is that it's a bit time consuming. Good news is that it's as good (or better) the second or third day.

I made the vinaigrette on its own and served it over salmon and couscous! I find the vinaigrette a great way to dress up any meat. I will def. try this with grilled veggies as well.

This was a big mess and a lot of work. It's not that hard to make grilled veggies and bulgur taste good, so while it was tasty in the end, the presentation (the only novel part of the recipe) was such a disappointment.

Very Yummy. I did as others suggested and just cut the portabella's up and served as a side dish. Everyone loved it!

Great veggie alternative. Agree with the cook from Brooklyn-the mushrooms don't add much but they make the dish look cool.

I ended up making this "deconstructed" where I grilled the portabellos, onions, zucchini, etc and chopped them to make a big salad. I used quinoa instead of the bulgur and it worked out great. The vinagrette was tasty and added a nice balance in flavor. We served this with a simple salad and grilled chicken. Great dinner.

Very tasty; fun to make, except next time what I'll do is grill the mushrooms and chop them, then add to the salad. Great on it's own or it would be great with grilled salmon or chicken. Make sure to drain the bulgar really well; I didn't and the salad turned out a bit soggy. Here's a picture of my version: http://www.flickr.com/photos/14527316 @N04/3652071803/

This was quite tasty, although I did change the presentation in an effort to save time. I placed the arugula on a plate, topped it with plain bulgar, added the grilled vegetables on top of that, and finished with the tomato vinaigrette, toasted nuts, and chopped avocado. The tomato sauce was exceptional, even though I used lemon juice intead of vinegar and forgot to add the parsley. Everyone raved and I would definitely make it again.

Use large portabello mushrooms therefore only one atop some salad and the bulgar mounded on top. Don't skip the pine nuts - they add a great flavour. The leftover bulgar salad will be even better the next day. This is a great make-ahead dish. We served with grilled shrimp.

Made this as written for dinner tonight and it was great. Happily we are only two, and the delicious bulgar salad is going to make GREAT leftovers!

My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this recipe. It was quick and easy to follow (although I needed to boil my bulgur for a good 10-12 minutes before it softened). I also didn't peel or scoop out the gills of the portabellas and they turned out great. I also didn't add the arugula, pine nuts or avocado simply because I didn't have them on hand. The bulgur gave the salad a warm, nutty flavor, while the vinaigrette and the vegetables added a tangy sweetness! I plan on making it again and again.

The portobello mushroom buns really didn't add anything to this dish. However, the bulgar salad with the tomato vinaigrette would make a nice side dish on its own.
