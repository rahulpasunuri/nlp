This recipe is amazing! I wouldn't recommend adding more sugar like some other people, it's not supposed to be a super sweet dessert. It tastes especially good made with crumbs from a fresh baguette.

I think it's a really good winter recipe. If you love the taste of apple and cinnamon like me do not serve it with yogurt!

I heard "Apple Brown Betty" referred to on a recent rerun of a Will and Grace episode. Decided to look it up on here, and made the recipe this evening. Wow! I used a day old baguette for the bread crumbs and granny smith apples. Made the kitchen smell wonderful. Tasted even better. Not too sugary sweet...nice apple and cinnamon taste and nice crispy texture on top. To those who have panned this recipe, if you want a sweet apple desert, bake an apple pie. Will be making this again very soon!

I totally agree with the cook from Sacramento! This recipe was a waste of good apples and bread! DO NOT make this dish!

I am so sorry I didn't read the reviews before I make this dish. Brown Bettys have been one of my favorite desserts for 50 years, and this one is so bad that my family opted to eat the ice cream (substituted for the frozen yoghurt) instead of the Brown Betty. It is not nearly sweet enough, so it is necessary to provide a large scoop of ice cream or yoghurt with the serving. The coarse bread crumbs on top are crisp all right - brown and dry is a better description. I would not bother to make this recipe again.

The other reviews here seem to be unhappy with this dish not for what it is but for what it is not. True, it's not really a standout, but it is a perfect recipe for classic comfort food and a very nice change from too sugary desserts. Success with this particular recipe probably relies on what kind of bread crumbs you use. My advice: get the freshest baguette or French bread loaf you can find.

this recipe was really pretty bland, and could have used another apple or so. The frozen yogurt helped a little, but any bite that was not in direct contact with the yogurt was uninspiring.

I used salted butter since I didn't have unsalted - big mistake. But even if I'd made it with unsalted butter, I don't think I would've liked this desert too much. It was basically apple mush with an indifferent topping. Apple crisp is much better, in my opinion.
