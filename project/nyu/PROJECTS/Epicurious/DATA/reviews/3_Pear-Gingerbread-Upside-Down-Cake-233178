This was a hit at my dinner party. I reduced the ginger preserves to 1/2 cup as suggested and baked it in a bundt cake pan to make it look more elegant. Had to leave it in the oven about 10 minutes longer. Otherwise, followed the rest of the recipe.

Very good and very easy! For those of you who might not want a lot of the ginger flavor, I would try using a little less of the ginger preserves. Otherwise, this was really good!

I used blackstrap molasses instead of the light molasses called for. I also added a dollop of vanilla whipped cream and a sprinkle of ginger as a garnish. It was a hit.

The overall taste was of the ginger preserves. (I used the brand they suggested) And the batter just barely covered the diced pears so there was more fruit than cake in the end. It was simple though, and I would try it again without the preserves, it was just too strong that way and not really dessert like. Shrug.
