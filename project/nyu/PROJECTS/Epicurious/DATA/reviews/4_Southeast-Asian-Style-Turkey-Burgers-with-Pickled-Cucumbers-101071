Really exceptional! I used a few ideas from the comments, but on the whole no major alterations. I doubleed the garlic and added some fish sauce to the meat misture, along with an egg white. I didn't have sriracha, so I used red chili paste in both the burger mix and in the aoili red cabbage slaw I used as an added topping. The herb level was spot on, and you cannot leave any of them out, as they define SE Asian cuisine. Fortunately I have both Thai basil and mint growing in my garden and had some leftover cilantro, which was the reason I tried this particular recipe. I toasted some potato buns and piled slaw on the bottom, topped with a burger and then the pickled cukes. Totally moist and delish. The best turkey burger I've tried from this site.

The first time I made these, I followed the recipe exactly except cilantro, which I hate,so I left it out. Then as time went by, and I've made it alot now, I started to add a little more hot sauce and lime. I also add a couple drops of fish sauce to round it out and I truly believe it makes them taste "meatier". Of course store baught crumbs are a must. I would say even if you aren't a mint person, it adds so much with the basil and other flavors. Definitely refrigerate the patties for a few hours so they'll hold together and because of that, don't salt them til just before the grill because it toughens the meat. For the pickles, I get a one-ounce cup of sushi ginger from the grocery store sushi counter. They're already made up and are about a buck. Don't leave it out because it's part of what makes these burgers so unique.

Made these burgers last night for a BBQ dinner party. Excellent. I used dark meat turkey blended with white meat. Also I used sriracha in place of tabasco and then made a sriracha aioli (just mayo blended with sriracha) to top the burgers along with the pickled cucumbers. Yummy.

These burgers are so fresh and tasty. The pickled cucumber are a fantastic topping. We enjoy them often.

I've made this before, but this time did it with ground white chicken meat, and it was *still* not dried out, which is extremely hard to do with chicken burgers. There's some magic in this recipe--I think the lime juice--that tenderizes the lean meat or something. So healthy and great.

Best use of ground turkey! If you follow the recipe as stated, meaning not "improvising" or leaving out an ingredient or two because you didn't want to buy it-- you will be rewarded with a recipe that you'll use for the rest of your life. Minor exception: the original recipe made by Sara Moulton, relied on siracha (rooster) sauce instead of tobasco. This recipe has never failed to impress whether we're grilling for friends or cooking it up as an easy weekend dinner. After making this 12+ times, I've found that I can leave out the bread crumbs IF I grill it on a griddle or pan-- instead of the bbq. If you leave it alone on each side, it will hold. If you attempt to flip it too early, that's when it crumbles (again, this is without the bread crumbs). I would highly recommend this for people who enjoy herbs like cilantro and mint... or those who like Asian flavors but are looking to get away from cooking red meat or pork.

I thought these were really good (my husband would have given 4 forks). The flavor was surprisingly good, given the ingredient list. I liked the cucumbers for crunch, but I actually thought the burgers stand alone, taste-wise. FYI, the original article in which this recipe appeared featured many great turkey dishes, including a meatloaf and "turkey in jade," both really outstanding.

I contributed this recipe as the red meat alternative for a barbeque where the hostess was serving New York strips. The word went around that these burgers were terrific and there wasn't one left over. However, there was steak! This is the moistest and most flavorful burger imaginable. The secret is the fresh bread crumbs,which I made from ciabatta, and fresh herbs. The adults loved them and they also weren't too exotic for the kids to enjoy. This recipe is a winner!

This Turkey Burger was boommb!!! I did alter it a bit. I used 3 garlic cloves instead of 1. A heaping tsp of rice flour, instead of bread-crumbs, to avoid heaviness. I thought just the cilantro and basil was enough. I S & P'd it a tad bit (a nice pinch of both). I also used 2 Tbsp of mango chutney as well. And I, too, used 1 1/2 tsp of chili garlic sauce. Don't have a grill, so I cooked them in a cast iron skillet in the oven at about 450, they were absolutely lovely. Now, I used Onion Rolls, buttered, and lightly toasted them, spreading an organic Apple-cinnamon sauce on both sides. I also like the pickled cucumber and ginger mixture. The only thing I did differently, was I used fresh ginger, so I had to slice it myself. I warmed the rice vinegar, adding raw sugar, which doesn't dissolves easily, and the finally the thinly sliced/stripped ginger and pouring it over the cucumbers, chilling it all morning long. Awesome recipe. I made a purple cabbage cole slaw. I will add that recipe on here soon. And also served it with organic Pico de Gallo tortilla chips. Nice mix of sweet and tangy on a nice summer afternoon. My lil honey, whose Bosnian, thought it was excellent. She tries and likes my cooking, which is a trip for me, because she is also very picky about what she eats. She wasn't sure about the pickled-cucumbers/apple sauce mixture, ON A BURGER, of all things :-) but absolutely loved it. Thanx for the recipe. ~ciao, people.

I make this all the time in the summer. I usually add an egg to keep it all together. It tends to fall apart a little, especially if your grill isn't hot enough to create a good sear. The flavor is so wonderful. My mouth waters thinking of this recipe.

Not as interesting as it might seem from the ingredient list. The marinated cucumbers are essential to pull it together. I also opted to make a pesto with left over mint, basil, and cilantro. I added pine nuts, olive oil, a little rice vinegar and a bit of sugar. Probably some spicy peppers would be great, but I needed it to be kid friendly. This helped tremendously... maybe a 3 with that. But I can only give it a two written as is. It got mixed reviews from our dinner table, but I cook dinner for a tough crowd.

Looking for something new to do with ground turkey & found this. What a yummy surprise! I used panko crumbs and garlic chili sauce instead of tabasco and reduced the sugar in the cucumbers since seasoned rice vinegar is already quite sweet. A definite keeper!

These burgers are scrumptious. Added some freshly grated ginger to burger mixture and served with the cucumbers and wasabi mayonnaise. Yum

I prepared this recipe as written except I didn't add the ginger. The flavor was very good but the burgers fell apart on my grill. Next time I'll put the burger patties in the refrigerator to cool before putting them on the grill to see whether that helps them stay together. If that fails I'll try adding egg. In any event, the flavor is worth making these burgers.

great recipe. made the burgers twice in two weeks, once on the barbecue grill and once on the foreman grill. both times, the burgers turned out great. great flavor. used a food processor for the herbs. the pickled cucumbers made a great topping.

This was fab-u. My husband inadvertently picked up parsley instead of cilantro so I halved the mint called for. Also used an egg white as suggested and asian red chili/garlic sauce. A real keeper - the cucumbers really bring it all together.

Pickled ginger is the ginger served with Sushi. It is usually pink, but can also be white and can be found in the Asian aisle of any grocery store... or sushi bar.

Amazing! We live in Manhattan, so we had to use a grill pan rather than a grill. These were tender and had an amazing flavor. For those who are slighly more into the spice, we added some Frank's to the mix. They were terrific, and the cucumbers are a must-have for the top.

LOVE these! I've made this recipe many times and it's one of my favorite ways to eat a burger. I've brought these to bbqs and served them to guests & have yet to hear anything but recipe requests and rave reviews (except from previous reviewer). I often make them without the mint (add extra basil and cilantro it its place), and use bread crumbs in lieu of the bread (easier). I also add a small chopped onion to the mix. Next time I'm thinking of adding some fish sauce. Highly recommended, broiled or grilled-- especially if you are a fan of Southeast Asian food and fresh herbs.

My husband and mother promised to be good if I promised to NEVER make these again - which I quickly agreed to. Three out of three of us vote the same - UGH. After reading all the raves I was highly optomistic - boy was I wrong! Now, a sudden severe thunderstorm kept us from grilling the burgers so I broiled them instead, maybe that was the key. I don't know...regardless, I followed the recipe exactly and needless-to-say, only mounds of catsup piled on helped my husband choke it down. I just ate silently in disappointment....give me a good old beef burger any time.

I was very excited to try this recipe, but when it came time to cook the patties they completely fell apart on the grill. I put them back in the bowl and added an egg for "glue", and still fell apart. Very disappointing. The recipe evolved into a meatloaf instead, but it lost its appeal.

Very good burgers! A few questions, if anyone could answer that would be great: what is pickled ginger, and how do I keep the turkey burgers from falling apart on my Foreman?

I eliminated the cilantro, popped them in the George Foreman grill for eight or nine minutes and they were absolutely delicious. Juicy and flavorful!

I make turkey burgers all the time and this recipe was delicious. Turkey burgers can be very dry but these were moist. I grilled them on my gas barbecue with mesquite wood which really added to the flavor and the aroma.

We loved these - easy to make with LOTS of flavor. A couple of changes we made... (1)For the cucumber salad, we used fresh ground ginger and let the salad realy soak in the fridge for a couple hours. (2) For the burgers, we added almost a whole finely chopped red chili - it gave it more zest for the brave at heart (rather than adding more tabasco)

These are the best turkey burgers I have ever had. They are refreshing and tasty. The pickled cucumbers make a perfect side dish, and also go well with asian-style fish dishes.

This is one of our favorite recipes! I am making it for 20 people tomorrow. It is a refreshing change from the usual barbecue fare. I had to find it on the internet because I couldn't find the magazine I have saved. This will be at least the fourth time I have made it but the first time for a crowd.

These turkey burgers have a great flavor and are very moist. Other turkey burgers we have fixed were dry. We'll definitely make these again! Our friends enjoyed them also.
