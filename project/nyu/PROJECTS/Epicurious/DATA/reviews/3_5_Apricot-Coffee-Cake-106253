This cake had good flavor and was nice and light but I was disappointed that the apricots sunk down into the batter and couldn't be seen. Maybe my pan was too deep? I used 1 can of apricots and they did cover the cake provided I spaced them out a bit. I would have liked more fruit.

Yum--very puffy and eggy which I love in a breakfast cake. I did use extra-large eggs as that was what I had on hand. The lemon makes it pop. I also used 4 fresh Long Island apricots instead of canned-very seasonal and delicious. Don 't omit the conf. sugar dusting.

I have made this a few times with some variations and I like that it's so easy. I made it once with strawberries and it tasted good although it was a little sweet. I also tried a small dollup of vanilla yogurt under each apricot and it added a nice dimension to the finished cake.

This recipe was very quick to put together and everyone was asking for seconds! I used fresh apricots from my yard, and then sprinkled some sugar on top. The combination of sweet cake with the tart apricots is the best part. I used 18 apricots for an 11x13 baking pan.

This cake is OK, tasty but nothing special. I would use 2 cans of apricots as the contents of one can did not cover the surface, as I had expected. When the cake cooked, the apricots got partially submerged, so the final product looked like a lot of fried eggs looking at you!

I followed the instructions exactly but used canned sliced peaches instead of apricots. Very easy to make and everyone enjoyed it. Not spectacular but good.
