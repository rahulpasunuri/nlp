Fabulous base recipe. I switched up as follows: changed to 1cup diced pecans, used coconut oil, used 1/6th tsp. Cinnamon; then changed out some maple syrup (real) for about 1/3rd of the Honey (if you have a metric measuring cup, 20mls of maple syrup and 40mls of Clover Honey). I changed the vanilla to 5 teaspoons from 4, and I recommend good quality vanilla, like Cook's. The only other change I made was I found it had better results cooked at 275°F rather than 300°F. I stirred it twice, at 10 minutes and then 20. I recommend removing it at between 28- 30 minutes. This makes a fabulous, rich, chewy AND crunchy ganola. It's good with milk, without milk, and on yogurt, etc. I make this 2x a week in the winter and less in the summer (due to our reluctance to use the oven in the summer when it's 115°F outside), but I recommend this HIGHLY. If you use dried fruit, obviously, add after the granola has cooked but before it completely cools/dries. Don't store until completely cooled. Stores nicely for up to two weeks, but it never lasts that long here!

This is my go to granola recipie base. I use whole almonds instead of sliced and add pumpkin seeds.

Excellent recipe. It was my first time making granola, but it won't be my last. Followed the advice of other reviewers and used coconut oil instead of vegetable, subbed coconut for almonds (due to allergies), upped salt to 3/4 tsp, and omitted the white sugar. Also added wheat germ and a few coarsely chopped pecans. I like the added salt because I am a huge fan of the salty-sweet flavor combo. The whole family loves it, and it wasn't as messy to make as I thought it would be. Also INCREDIBLY easy!

I love this recipe and so does my family. I use all organic ingredients and substitute the almonds(due to nut allergies in the family) with coconut. I also have used Agave syrup to sweeten instead of the white sugar. We add: dried cranberries, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, chocolate chips and goji berries... Yum and healthy Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Using coconut oil replacing the vegetable oil yields wonderful results. Butter could also be substituted but I prefer the coconut oil.

Rating: 0
This is the best granola there is. It's delicious and has just the right amount of crunch. The generous bit of vanilla really makes it amazingI substitute coconut oil for the vegetable oil for it's health benefits and extra flavor. I use half the amount of brown sugar, reduce the white sugar to 1 1/2 T (it's still perfectly sweet) and add flaxseed meal to the oats. I sometimes substitute pecans for the almonds. Both are great. Yum.

Rating: 3
I made the recipe exactly as written. This to me tastes better when eaten with 'milk' on it, especially whole milk, than it tastes eaten out of hand. I think it needs to have some raisins, so next time I make this I will add some raisins during the last 10 minutes of baking so that the raisins don't burn. It is more 'affordable' than the expensive overpriced stuff you can find in the store, no additives or preservatives either!

Great starting recipe for granola. Based on other reviews and my own preferences, I made several changes. I used hazelnuts instead of almonds, upped the salt to 3/4 t of KOSHER salt, upped cinnamon to 1/2 t, added 1/4 c. of sesame seeds and added about 1/8 cup of ground flax seeds. I used coconut oil instead of veg, used corn syrup instead of honey (that's all that I had on hand), didn't add the 2 T of sugar, and upped the vanilla extract to 1 T + 2 t. (Several reviewers have mentioned upping the vanilla from 4 t to 1 T, but there are 3 t to 1 T so that's actually decreasing it.) After baking, I added about 1 c. chopped dried cranberries. I kept half to snack on and froze the other half for a surprise treat some other time.

Great recipe! I substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil and added freshly ground nutmeg, pecans and dried cherries. I've made the basic recipe too, and I'd have to say my variation really added some great flavor; especially the nutmeg! Other reviewers have suggested adding more salt... I did, and I didn't like that at all, but eliminating the two extra tbls of white sugar was a good suggestion.

Halved the brown sugar, omitted the white sugar and doubled the salt per recommendations of other reviewers. I liked the amount of sweetness, but will not double the salt next time -that made it too salty for me !!!

Followed the OK reviewer below, upping the (kosher) salt to 3/4 tsp, cinnamon to 1/4 tsp, and vanilla to 1 Tbsp. I cut the white sugar by 1 Tbsp. The increased salt, and the bigger crystals (kosher instead of regular) made this really pop. Added 1 cup dried cranberries, used a variety of nuts. As per another reviewer, I baked 30 min, stirring every ten, then patted down flat and baked for an additional 5 minutes. I let it sit in the pan while it cools and then it breaks into terrific, big clumps. Really great base recipe - will use this as my go-to for granola from now on.

I cannot stop eating this granola!!!! I made it on a whim this afternoon because I had all of the ingredients (thinking it should be renamed pantry granola). We had planned to go out for dinner but everyone started eating the granola and then we had to try it with milk and yogurt. Needless to say we never made it out to dinner. This will be a staple in our house now. Can't wait to add other ingredients next time. So adaptable. I used 3/4 t. of kosher salt (thought this was perfect!), 1/4 t. cinnamon, 1 T. vanilla, and ditched the extra 2T. sugar. DELISH!

Rating: 4
This is my go-to granola. I skip the extra 2T of sugar, and up the cinnamon. I warm the honey, but don't heat everything in the sauce pan, just streamlined it for ease. Delish, and takes additions very well, raisins, cranberries, other nuts....

Storebought granola simply doesn't compare to what you make yourself. No contest. This recipe is perfect. We used hazlenuts and added craisens or and quick oats was what I had so we used em and everything came out just perfectly. Ours came out nice and clumpy. I stired every 10 minutes until we got to 30 minutes, then I patted everything down in the pan, cooked another 8 minutes, pulled from the oven and left undisturbed until totally cool. So good. We've eaten 1/4 of the pan already. OOPS!

I made this last night while waiting for dinner. Very Simple mixing the dry ingredients together. I used 3/4 tsp of cinnamon (still couldn't taste a noticeable difference). I would increase the amount of salt as the user suggested below me (I will also take their suggestion and try adding Sesame seeds in next time!). I "tossed" the mix 3 times, once every 10 minutes and it created a nice warm brown color. I left it in the over for a total of maybe 35-37 minutes. Not too soft, not too crispy, just perfect. Will become a staple in my kitchen!

Better than store-bought! First time I followed recipe as is! Delicious! Second time, I added 1/4 cup raw sesame sseds, 1/4 cup unsweetened coconut, up the salt to 1/2 tsp., Up the cinnamon to 1 tsp. and used sunflower oil instead of vegetable oil. This is such an awesome granola to eat with So Delicious Coconut Milk, or to eat with yogurt...or even by itself.

This is my go-to granola recipe and everyone loves it. You can change up the dry ingredients to whatever you like but the oil, sugar, honey, vanilla combo is great. I usually add pecans, flax, pumpkin seeds, and unsweetened coconut. When it's done baking but still warm I add dried cranberries and sometimes dates. I bake on parchment and avoid the nonstick spray.

Fantastic Granola. Made a few modifications; butter instead of Veg oil; increased cinnamon to 1/2 tsp (will try 1 tsp next time); added different nuts for some variation. Once it was cooling, I added dried cranberries. I also left it in the over for 35 minutes - there was a larger amount than the recipe planned.

This granola is truly amazing! I don't know why I ever purchased granola from a store... We've stopped buying cereal in a box now, and I just make this once a week. It is great because it gives you freedom to experiment, which makes this recipe well-suited to being eaten on a regular basis. This week, I'm adding flax seed, soy nuts, dried cranberries and raisins.

This is the best granola I have ever tried. I vary what kinds of dried fruit I put in it -- sometimes cranberries, sometimes dries apricots. I also cut down on the white sugar just a bit. I can't keep this stuff in the house -- we use ot for breakfast as well as for topping ice cream or yogurt.

Great as is but may to a little sweet for some. I make bars by baking it in a 13 x 9 tart pan with removal sides. Before bakingI press the mixture into the pan using a mini rolling pin - then when slightly cool I cut it into bars. I of course do not stir it as it bakes - but let it bake like a batch of brownies. My grandkids and coworkers love it. I have made this many, many times!

Our ONLY granola recipe for two years, and incredibly popular with all the teens who wander into our kitchen. Like other reviewers, I omit the white sugar, reduce the brown sugar, and substitute maple syrup for the honey. I also ramp up the vanilla flavor by scraping the seeds of one vanilla bean into the warmed oil/syrup mixture. Whisk well to remove any clumping of seeds. I still use all the called- for vanilla extract.

Like the rest of you, I altered the recipe a bit by adding ground flax seed and ground cashews. I ground them both, separately, in a magic bullet blender, and I only intended to coarsely chop the nuts, but was being lazy, and it turned to powder. (I did leave a few larger pieces.) It was wonderful! I'll do the same thing again next time.

A great recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and omitted the white sugar and substituted maple syrup for honey. It's definitely sweet enough but the maple taste is perhaps a bit strong -- will try honey the next time. I used a mixture of almonds, walnuts and pecans and added some shredded coconut, plus some dried dates and apricots. If you want it to clump, stick with the original recipe and don't reduce the amount of oil!

I have made this many times now. Over time I have discovered some great tweaks: add 1 c. chopped pecans, reduce brown sugar to 5 T, increase cinnamon to 1/2 t, reduce oil to 1/4 c, omit granulated sugar. I know some people hate when cooks rewrite the recipes and review them but this one is way better like this. Just the right balance of crunch and sweetness.

I love this granola and make it several times a week! After making it so frequently, thought I'd pass on a few tips for folks if they're interested. I cut down on the amount of oil and it doesn't seem to matter. I've also used all honey and brown sugar with good effect. Finally, for those who have trouble getting the granola to clump: as soon as the granola is finished baking (still warm and slightly moist, pack it up into a tight bar by wrapping it in foil and throw it in the freezer. By pushing the granola into itself, it will solidify as a bar that can then be broken apart when cool. Works wonderfully! Enjoy.

I put it in pint- and quart-sized Mason jars (with covered and beribboned lids) as Christmas gifts for my sons' teachers, as peace offerings, in new-mom care packages -- you name it, everyone raves. Even my boys, who eat almost nothing, devour this! Tips? Line the baking sheet with parchment paper for ease of cleanup. For those who don't need it in this quantity, it freezes well. To get clumps, you need only let it cool completely, undisturbed on the parchment, on a cooling rack, then break it into whatever size pieces you prefer.

This granola is a winner. We serve it at our bed and breafkast, and guests love it! It's simple to make - you can double the recipe easily, vary the ingredients, and it's basically no-fail. If I want largerclumps, I just add a little extra oil and let the mixture cool completely before handling.

I make this for my family at least twice a month. If we are out for any length of time, the put in a request for it! I have used pecans or walnuts, but I do like almonds best. I have added dried cranberries,apples, or cherries. I have also substituted corn syrup for honey when I have been out. It is hard to screw up! I did leave out the vanilla once by accident, I wouldn't recommend making that mistake, It was not as good without it. GOOD STUFF!!!

This is a delish granola. I didn't add any white sugar, and i decreased the brown sugar just a bit. I added a little extra honey, and it was just the right amount of sweet (my boyfriend is a sugar fanatic and he agrees). I also chopped up dried apricots and added them in after baking. The only problem was this recipe burns VERY easily. Definitely needs to be stirred every three to four minutes, and I only baked it for 14 mins!!! I added a bit of nutmeg for extra spice, which made it very delish. I don't think it tastes that vanilla-y, but it's tasty all the same.

Good base, I added a tablespoon of maple syrup to the liquid ingredients and raisins at the end of baking. Also substituted walnuts for the almonds as I had none in the house. The vanilla flavor really comes through in this recipe. I only made half, as there are only 2 people in my household and we don't eat this in quantity - it's mostly to top yogurt in the morning.

To the cook from Boston who wondered about clumps. I haven't made this recipe, but I followed Cook's Illustrated recipe that gave the following instructions for clumpy granola: For clumpy granola, right after you remove the mixture from the oven, press it into a three-quarter-inch layer with even edges, then press a single layer of paper towels onto the granola. When the granola is cool, remove the towels. Remove the cereal in sections and place in an airtight container. When ready to use, crumble granola to desired chunkiness.

The taste of this recipe is perfect. I halved the recipe, used maple syrup instead of honey, and stirred in raisins after baking. It tastes just like oatmeal cookies.

I was looking for a granola recipe I could use to top yogurt with while dieting and this turned out great! I followed the advice of other reviewers and left out the white sugar and added allspice. I also substituted apple juice (reduced by half - like concentrate) for all of the oil except a tablespoon, and the result was a chewy & chunky yet very LOW FAT granola. I plan on playing with this recipe some more, adding other spices, nuts & fruits to vary it, but it's good just as it is.

Great basic granola recipe. I have to agree with previous reviewers that it is a little too sweet. I've made it twice. Once as written and once reducing the sugar. My husband, who is not a granola lover, thought the original recipe was better than the revised with less sugar - I think it was because it tastes a little more like oatmeal cookies.

Yummy! This granola was great on it's own, with milk and with yogurt! And, it was so easy to make. I also added raisins about halfway through the baking process. Make sure to taste toward the end, because after 25 minutes it was ready. Any longer and it would have had a burnt taste.

This was perfect over fruit and yogurt for breakfast. I find commercial granola too sweet, so I cut out both sugars and kept the honey. I replaced half the oil with water and used only 2 cups oats but added 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes and 1/2 cup wheat germ.

I'm another first-time granola maker and this recipe was super easy and quite good. I had a few little mishaps that affected the final product, but I can tell that it's a good recipe and I'll make it again. (I used canola oil. Don't - it adds a slight oil flavor that you don't want. I think I also overbaked the granola slightly). Even with these imperfections, the granola made a nice topping to vanilla ice cream and sauteed apples. I added golden raisins to mine, and expect to try other interesting variations next time.

Like other reviewers I was hesitant to make this as it seemed so simple. But it's so wonderful, my husband (who only casually likes granola) ate it all in 2 days! The beauty of this recipe is that it is great "as is" or you can add what you like. I added raisens (1 cup) AFTER it finished baking so they wouldn't be hard. I also doubled the cinnamon (we like cinnamon) and added sunflower seeds (without the shells). I even had it for breakfast with milk--YUM. I will make this at Christmas for gifts, probably with dried cranberries for a twist.

I tried this recipe for the first time even though I've made granola before with various ingredients. I agree with one post that if you bake the raisins in, they will be hard like pieces of candy. Add them later and it'll be better. I used the almonds and pecans and it was real yummy. I also let my sugar, oil and honey come up foamy and swirled it a bit to be sure all the solids dissolved before I added the vanilla. It bubbled a bit like caramel, but the end product turned out nicely. I'd do this one again.

I am a veteran granola maker and I loved this recipe- nice and simple. I did think it was a little too sweet, though. Next time I'll leave out some of the sugar.

I've made tons of granola recipes from this site, but this is the only one I've rated as 4 forks! Quite a surprise to me. Since all the others had more "stuff" (and I like "stuff"), I figured this plain recipe would be boring. But instead, it tasted perfect! (Am I supposed to simmer the wet mixture until it's foamy and bubbly? Then again, there wasn't really any intermediate stage in between...)

Very good, I would make this again. I added pecans with the almonds which were great.

Excellent! Have made it twice and it turns out great. I always add my own things like coconut flakes, wheat germ, barley flakes, or soy nuts; chopped almonds instead of sliced. That is what is best about granola. You can add whatever you've got in the pantry. Sometime I will try this with maple syrup instead of honey.

This receipe is addictive. I've made it several times; given samples to a lot of friends and they all loved it!

This granola is delicious and easy to make. The first time I made it I just tossed everything together in a bowl and spread it onto a cookie sheet to bake (it was too early in the morning for reading recipes correctly I guess)and it turned out just fine. I've also made it for gifts by putting it into lid-lock jars.

Easy basic recipe for yummy granola. I used 1 tsp cinnamon and still I think there could have been more. Maybe a bit of ginger, too. I added raisins after it was baked. I couldn't be bothered with stirring while it was baking so I just let it sit. Came out just fine.
