This was ok, but not great. Don't think I would make this again.

Brought this to a pot luck style party & it was the first dish to disappear. My friends also told me to save the recipe. One thing though, I took the advice of a previous reviewer & cut the sesame oil in half & was perfect.

This dish looked a lot better than it tested. It was just bland and not the least bit tasty.

The first time I made this, I misread the marinade instructions and included the soy sauce and sesame oil in the marinade. The results were great! This also works well as a stir fry -- saute the marinated shrimp, add the snow peas for a minute or two, and serve over rice. The chinese five-spice powder adds a lot of depth of flavor without having a gloppy sauce.

I was very unhappy with this dish. To me, the shrimp were very blah. To call them "spicy shrimp" seems to be a mistake. I followed the recipe exactly and marinated them 4 hours. Maybe overnight would help and also add more spices. Bottom line though, I won't be making them again.

For a really fabulous presentation, steal an idea from MS Entertaining. Cut the bottom off of a medium cabbage, so that it sits flat. Stick the toothpicked shrimp onto the cabbage. I call it a globe-o-shrimp, but it looks great and is a hit at parties.

This dish was easy to make and made a nice presentation. However, they were a bit more oily than I would have expected. Next time I may use the sesame oil more sparingly.

I have made this a couple of times most recently Sunday night for a dinner party of 8. Both times it was a success. I ended up marinating the shrimp overnight and think that the shrimp without the snow peas would be a good appetizer. I like sesame oil but it seemed to overpower the shrimp a little. The recipe does make a nice presentation.

The shrimp were OK, but wrapping them in the snow peas was not worth the effort. If I make them again, I would not bother with the snow peas, but I have a feeling they add to making this dish "special".

I liked this recipe. To love it I would spice it up more. I doubled the recipe and the marinade needed more zing. Adjust the marinade for seasoning before you add the shrimp. I would love to make this again with some sort of Asian dipping sauce. Any ideas?

They were delicious and looked great but it seemed like so much work! Barely any cooking time...but peeling those shrimp and then trying to stab the finished product with a toothpick after dousing them with sesame oil was a feat.

A terrific recipe! We made these for a Murder Mystery Dinner and they were a big hit! One could never make too many of these.

Made this with several other appetizers for a dinner party. No one even tried the other appetizers until these were gone. They were so beautiful and tasty. Will definitly make again.

Great appetizer! Best to use large shrimp & full size peas. I find it's best to eat within a couple hours of assembly.

I made this recipe a few weeks ago and my guests LOVED it ! I added a little extra sesame oil to the snow peas because it has such a great taste! I also used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil for the marinating and cooking of the shrimp. The ONLY problem with the recipe is that once the shrimp is cooked, their shape is more round. You cannot wrap the snow pea "head-to-toe" so I just wrapped it around sort of sideways and secured it.I will definitely make these again !

A wonderful combination of flavors. Just don't make the mistake I made -- I used jumbo shrimp instead of large and could barely fit the snowpeas around them. Other than that, this was delicious!

One of the absolutely best recipes I've made for parties!

I loved making this recipe, and my company loved it even more. The best part was that it can be totally assembled and refrigerated hours before serving!

Served at a cocktail party and it was the first to go. Living in South Carolina, I was able to use large fresh shrimp which was a bonus.
