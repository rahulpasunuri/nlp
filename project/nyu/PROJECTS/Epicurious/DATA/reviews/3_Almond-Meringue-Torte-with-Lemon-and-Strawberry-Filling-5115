I have made this several times and do not think it is as difficult as it's been made out to be. I have modified the recipe somewhat, using cinnamon in the meringues, and using other berries along with the strawberries. For those who think it is too sweet, I make 3 meringues and use the buttercream sparingly (I don't put it on the sides). It's always been a big hit.

After reading the other reviews on how hard this recipe was, I hesitated making this, but since I always look for desserts that MAY be able to be made sugar free, I thought I'd try it anyway. I substitued Splenda for the sugar, and it worked beautifully! Sugar free recipes, that are lower in carbs and taste good are very hard to find for the diabetics in the family. (For special occassions, the fat is OK in our family) This one was easy (I was suprised) and was able to substitue great! Fantastic presenation also!

This just isn't worth the trouble. I thought that with these ingredients this had to be good - it wasn't. Too sweet, the outcome is just not worth the time spent doing this.

Everyone who ate this cake loved it. For the amount of work involved I did not feel it was worth it. At least everyone at the dinner party really enjoyed it!
