These are RAZOR clams. Do they even have them on the East coast? In WA, we dig razors whenever they open the beaches. This is our favorite fried razor clam recipe. Cutting them into strips makes them easier to eat as they can be pretty chewy. The curry is perfect - just a hint. We didn't care for the aioli, which was odd as we love all the ingredients. Tarter sauce is great with these.

Clam STRIPS?? Yuck! Clams strips are generally nothing more than large sea clams cut up into strips, hence the name "strips". If you want to taste real fried clams use the whole fresh ones with the bellies. These clams are generally quite small but are the best. A couple squirts of fresh lemon and some really good tartar sauce. YUM! Yes, I proudly admit to being a New England seafood and shellfish snob even though we no longer live there.
