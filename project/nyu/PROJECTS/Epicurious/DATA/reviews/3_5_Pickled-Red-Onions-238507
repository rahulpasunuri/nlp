I let these "stew" for two days as others had recommended, and I took them out of the fridge today and kept tasting and tasting with the hope that I would like them, but I don't. I love pickled anything, but the oregano was too much, and I thought that the white vinegar left a funky flavor. Darn! This recipe does make a pile of onions, and so this is a lot to waste. I might try again and adjust the ingredients.

I've been making these for about two months now. Like some others have said, they need to stand a while before using; I find they need several days or a week. Also, any hot pepper works, and the amount can (should) be adjusted to taste. I add the tiniest amount of sugar, as well. I keep making new batches and adding to the old jar. I have to admit that I eat these straight from the jar, as well as with just about any dish you can think of! If you need them right away, try bringing everything to the boil on the stove, and then cooling and storing. That is usually the method for "quick" pickles.

I use this as a salsa, I cut the chile in small pieces and add a bit of olive oil, it is great with any kind of tacos or quesadillas

These are absolutely delicious! 1 onion is plenty for a garnish. And I too found that the onions were better pickled after 2 days. Once done, they aren't spicy or onion-y at all - I was amazed! They added a great extra flavor to my chicken verde enchilada recipe!

Great recipe! Simple & quick- yet it takes at least two days to pickle, so make it ahead of time. Once the onions soften and the flavors meld, it is a heavenly condiment.

These were good, but make a ton! Good with the stacked enchilada recipe (but not essential). I used the "sauce" and onions on top of a spinach and tomato salad drizzled with olive oil and it was very good. Will still halve the recipe next time and that will still probably be too much.

The oregano is a bit much for me. Perhaps a little less of the spice and let the vinegar and lime do it's magic.

Also an excellent garnish for a simple lettuce & avocado salad.

Excellent. I used a few sliced serrano chilies instead of a habanero and it turned out sufficiently spicy. Great as part of a relish tray.

These are great. They are perfect with the layered chicken/tomatillo recipe and everything else that I have added them to. I have made these once with two large jalepenos sliced when I did not have anymore habs. That was great as well. The oregeno really stands out it this too. Try these on a toasted roast beef and cheddar sandwich...it is heavenly!

I loved the pickled onions. It was the best part of the stacked enchiladas recipe. We also had the left overs with tacos delicious!
