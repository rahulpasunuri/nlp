Way too oniony. Ruined the taste of the red white and green lasagne. Yuck.

This is a GREAT recipe! It has become a fall/ winter staple for us. Quick, delicious, and beats everything in a jar.

We didn't puree the sauce and it still worked fine. We saved time and dishes, plus we liked the chunky texture.

I used 1 cup dried tomatoes ( I have a lot in my freezer!) steeped in 1 1/2 cups beef stock and then processed it before adding to the rest of the sauce that way I was able to skip the food mill. Also, used 28 oz can diced San Marizano tomatoes as that's what I had on hand. Proceeded to use it for all'Amatriciana sauce with guanciale and crushed red pepper. Got rave reviews!! The dried tomatoes add an intense tomato flavor. Easy to put together and a welcome dish on a cold, rainy night. Will make again without hesitation.

Used with Red, White & Green Lasagne & very happy. Doubled the recipe, but had only 1 can tomatoes so used 16oz tomato sauce + some water. Left un-food milled & rustic. Added 2 large sauted portabello mushrooms (1/2 inch dice). Used some extra virgin olive oil to finish. Wonderful sauce. The sun-dried tomatoes lighten it, not acidic at all.

Liked this sauce a lot. Might try and use it as a base for an arrabiata sauce.

Needs quite a bit of salt. I used sundried tomatoes packed in oil, because I couldn't track down the other. I added fresh basil and pureed with my hand blender. Next time, I would add more garlic and more fresh basil. Mine did not work out to 3.5 cups - I would say I had 2.5 cups at the most.

This sauce is great. Ronni, wow, you did a lot with it! Sounds great. My variation is doubling the recipe, and adding eight plum tomatoes. I also add oregano and fresh basil. Umm, what the heck is a food mill? I don't even know what that is, so I ran the whole thing through my food processor. It's a great recipe.

Fantastic. Worth every second spent with the food mill, the flavor of this sauce makes you forget entirely your tomatoes came from cans. I used this sauce in lasagne, and I was disappointed to see there were absolutely no leftovers. I also added wine, and was glad I did.

Don't alter this recipe--it's ideal as is! A food mill is a must, however; you'll have a mess on your hands if you try to use a colander or wire-mesh strainer.

This was very easy to make. I sauteed everything in a cast iron skillet (nearly overflowed with addition of canned tomatoes) then tossed it into a plain ol' blender. The only things I added to this sauce were more garlic (yum) and basil and oregano. Used in red, white and green lasagne and guests _loved_ it.

Fantastic sauce! The sun-dried tomatoes really make the sauce unique. I followed the suggestions to add wine, sugar and herbs and was very pleased with the results.

It was very helpful reading all the other suggestions. I added red wine, italian spices and crushed red pepper to the recipe, and pureed in my blender. I also made a day ahead of the lasagne so the flavors could ripen. Very tomatoey, but my partner loved it and I caught him eating it plain over pasta. Doubled the recipe so I could freeze leftovers for fast, easy lasagne assembly next time!

The sundried tomatoes adds a wonderful punch to the sauce. Use a hand blender to puree the sauce directly in the pot it was simmered in. Very easy and the consistency is perfect for lasagne.

I made this sauce for the red and green lasagne and I wanted to add some thoughts. The sauce needs to be pureed after it is slowly simmered. I used a super blender because I do not have a food mill and cannot imagine straining such a thick sauce. In addition, I added red wine and a little bit of brown sugar and Worceshire sauce to give the sauce more kick, as well as fresh basil. This sauce is nice and thick but it was more work than one would think because I did not read the recipe to the end where it tells you to put the sauce through a food mill or sieve. I definitely recommend the blender - much faster.

Don't even attempt to make this sauce if you don't have a food mill! Trying to strain the sauce through a sieve is very slow and messy.
