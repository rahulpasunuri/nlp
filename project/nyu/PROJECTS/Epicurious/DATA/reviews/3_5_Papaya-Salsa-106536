I completely improvised - orange instead of pineapple and a sweet pepper, fresh mint. and I happened to get a great papaya. It was a nice foil for the spicy jerk chicken. Tiny limes to go with...

wonderful fresh tasting salsa. Loved the hint of putting the onion in lime juice first, really made the salsa much much better.

Delicious with jerk chicken!! I used mango and added red bell pepper and cucumber, and cilantro too. If you don't want an overwhelming onion/garlic flavor, simply macerate (soak) them in the lime juice for 20+ minutes before adding the other ingredients. The acid in the lime mellows them dramatically so that all flavors are balanced. This recipe is a template, but you can mess with it a lot according to taste.

I also substituted cantalope. Papaya is hard to come by at my local supermarkets. Easy and good.

Yum. Made this to serve alongside jerk chicken, as recommended. Didn't have papaya so I substituted cantaloupe. I should have doubled the recipe - it was gone in a flash! Very versatile recipe you can enjoy as is or build upon.

Great with salty chips! Serve in small amounts due to garlic.

Fantastic! I'd always been afraid that a fruit salsa would be too sweet for my liking, but this was great! I also added 1/2 a small red onion, 2 mangoes, cilantro and even some avocado (I can't help it! I'm from California!) and it was great! I just hope we don't eat it all before the jerk chicken is grilled!

Excellent. I used mango instead of papaya. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I used it w/ the Jerk Chicken Gourment May 2002. Yummy!

I like this with chives not scallions and semi-sundried tomatoes, chopped, as oppose to garlic which is a bit crude for papays

I substituted red onion for the scallions, added a lot more garlic, substituted apricots for the pineapple, added ponzu and cilantro. It was fabulous.

Made these changes: substituted mango for papaya, omitted the pineapple, added red onion, cilantro and sliced the garlic. I realize that this is essentially another recipe but I enjoyed it very much and it complimented the jerk chicken recipe nicely. Plus this was really easy to make!

Made an excellent accompaniment to Jerk Chicken; but don't think I'd be crazy about it on its own. For me the flavors didn't balance very well; it was sickly-sweet, tangy, and garlicy all at the same time. However my papaya was just slightly over-ripe and that is probably the main culprit. Read about how to choose a papaya if you're new to the fruit. I would try it again, but consider some of the other recommendations, like working in a mango. Also it came out a bit soupy, which another reviewer correctly attributed to the pineapple... definitely recommend draining it after dicing.

Very good. My husband loved it and he's never been a papaya fan.

Really Great!!! Not groundbreaking, but refreshing and super with grilled jerk chicken & curried rice.

Wonderful accompaniment to the Grilled Jerk Chicken. I added mangos as well since they looked so good in the store. YUM!

I made this as an accompaniment to the Grilled Jerk Chicken. What a wonderful combination of flavors -- and what a great accompaniment! Loved it!

Went fantastic with the Jerk Chicken...

Incredible. Don't change a thing, but do try it with the accompanying Jerk Chicken recipe.

This was great with the Jerk Chicken. I tried this recipe last summer and it was good, but this time was MUCH better! I think it always takes at least once of making something to know what to change next time. This time around I used the yellow Asian mangos (4), used half a purple onion finely diced, and added about 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro. It was out of sight with the Jerk Chicken I made and roasted sweet potato. I definitely recommend these modifications. Would go well with any grilled meat or fish if spicy in nature. The mango and cilantro have a nice cooling effect. Enjoy!

Went well with the grilled jerk chicken. Wouldn't make it as an accompanient to anything else.

ok, I did some major revamping with this recipe because I wasn't thrilled with the papaya in itself. LOL As a note to most people trying this.....eat a piece of the papaya before you slice it all up, because if its nasty, you will know ahead of time (I sliced it all up never having papaya before, and after tasting it, YUCK! Overripe or something! In the trash the diced 3lb-er went LOL) Anyway, substituted 2 mango for the papaya, and added a few slivers of red onion as well as a little bit of mint. Very nice exotic flavor, I'm sure it will be wonderful with the jerk chicken I am about to cook.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! It is very rare that I sit down with a spoon and a bowlful of something healthy (now something unhealthy ... that's a different story!) but that's how I feel about this salsa. It's one of my favorite recipes from this website. To me, the proportions of the different flavors are just perfect; there's a lot going on in your mouth when you taste it. To keep it from being overly garlicky, instead of the minced garlic I've taken a large garlic clove, cut it in half, and just let the two big pieces sit in the salsa for a couple of hours before serving, then remove. That gives it just enough garlic flavor. Do yourself a favor and try this -- and even if you don't want to sit down and eat it by the bowlful, it's fabulous with the jerk chicken, which is also wonderful.

Lovely salsa and a great complement for the Jerk Chicken. I did revise a little: used only 1 papaya, and added 1 large diced peach and fresh minced cilantro. Also, I have found it works best to allow the diced pineapple to drain thoroughly before mixing into the other ingredients - add it last. Because pineapple is very juicy, if you don't drain it first, the salsa becomes quite watery which is rather unpleasant. There are other fruit salsa recipes I like better, however this one was a nice change.

Just so-so, but with potential . Maybe I got an overripe papaya, but salsa was just too much bubble-gummy papaya-y. The other flavors were good, but I would change the proportions & I think the idea about adding mango would help.

So good! Each flavor was balanced, and each shone through. Tasted very complex. Really a must with the accompanying jerk chicken recipe.

This was way too garlicky. I would omit the garlic altogether. It didn't seem to go with the papaya.

This was amazing and went wonderfully with the jerk chicken! The only change we made was instead of 2 papaya's we used 1 papaya and 1 mango..... yummy!!!!! A keeper of a recipe!
