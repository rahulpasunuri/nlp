I use this as my base to make Salty Caramel ice cream, a local gourmet ice cream shoppe (Jeni's) specialty. I add about 2t of salt, and then usually sprinkle in a little more to taste. When I follow the directions exactly and caramelize all the sugar to dark amber, it's TOO STRONG. The first time I made it people were like WHOA after each bite. This last time I let it go a light amber, and it's a bit more mellow and not as in your face, but still delish. I think I will continue to make it slightly more mellow, although the good side of the intense version is you can't eat very much.

Ditto on everyone, but I don't understand why the need to cut down on the eggs? You're only going to reduce your yield. I had a lot of hungry people to feed, so I wasn't about to skimp on the ice cream! It is delicious, and I took the title to heart and just went full bore right to the point of smoking before I added the other ingredients. And it was so nice and creamy when it turned out. I love making ice cream, and this is the reason why! Also, I think this is a great accompaniment to Elsie's Apple Strudel; a strong exclamation point on the soft-spoken apple pastry.

This is not only the best ice cream I've ever made, but might be one of the best things I've ever tasted! So delicious! I only used four egg yolks and that was fine. I was a little worried when I added the milk and the burnt sugar hardened into one big clump, but stirred and it all melted. Did I say it is DELICIOUS?!?!

This was delicious. I followed the suggestions and used only 5 egg yolks. I forgot I needed to chill it for 4 hours, so I chilled it in ice bath, which worked well. I added some toasted pecans and chocolate chips. The pecans were excellent, but when the chips got cold their taste and texture really diminished.

Very delicious and excellent consistency. I reduced eggs to 4 - which was plenty. The caramel became a hard ball when I added the milk but melted eventually as I stirred it. Definitely strain before adding to the ice cream machine. Served with flourless chocolate cake and crushed peanuts - superb!

I tasted the mixture after adding the eggs and found that it wasn't sweet enough. Kept stirring in more (un-burnt) sugar and tasting until I ended up adding a whole cup's worth! My ice cream also didn't freeze like normal ice cream - it had a sticky texture which makes it hard to scoop. Maybe it's because there's 50% cream, 50% milk? Regardless, I like its unusual taste!

Eureka! This is as near as i ever hoped to get to the caramel ice cream at Bertillon in Paris. I took a chance and added a few tiny fragments of really good fudge during the freezing process and it worked well. I listened to the other reviewers and left out two of the eggs and let the caramel go quite dark. I just cooled it to room temperature in an ice bath and stuck it in the freezer. As far as i could tell, it didn't suffer from not going into the ice cream machine. One thing: it did leave a bit of an oily/waxy residue on the tongue - i wonder if that's natural with a sugar and cream-rish dessert or whether i did something wrong?

Rich and yummy with 5 yolks. Served it with warm tarte tatin.

A great and easy caramel ice cream recipe. I had some trouble getting it to really solidify, but even putting it in the freezer before the ideal consistency, it was really great as a final product.

I made this yesterday, and it didn't really turn out. But I think the problem was that the custard hadn't chilled enough. I found the recipe really easy and everything worked perfectly. But when I put it into the ice cream machine, it just wouldn't set. I stuck it in the freezer anyway and got something more like gelato, and it was DELICIOUS! Can't wait to try it again. Maybe give the bowl with the custard an ice bath before chilling in the fridge, or increase the time to 6 or even 8 hours. But a VERY nice flavor.

Since I ate at Osteria Via Stato in Chicago a year ago I have been trying to duplicate the Burnt Caramel Gelato I had there. I was so happy to see this recipe from Gale Gand knowing it HAD to be THE recipe from the restaurant since it is owned by her and her husband.I made it and it is. THE BEST caramel ice cream!

This is the best ice cream recipe I have ever made- and I could imagine it could be even better with a few additions. Make sure to make the caramel quite dark or else you wont get as pronounced a flavor. Also, there are endless additions which could be added to improve it- perhaps a simple nut brittle broken into shards (heat sugar in a pan until a caramel, stir in nuts, spread on baking sheet until hard, break) or plain walnuts, pecans, or almonds, lightly toasted. I reduced the eggs by two because I hate that eggy taste of most homemade ice creams (I somehow manage to make them all taste more like breakfast than dessert). It worked out fine with them omitted.

Did anyone make the candied bacon recipe that is supposed to garnish the ice cream?

This ice cream is really amazingly good, but it's pretty fussy. I answered a phone call while cooking my caramel (big mistake) and it burnt in a matter of seconds. On to batch #2. You really don't need 6 egg yolks - this ice cream is plenty rich with 5 yolks, and I think you could even dial it back to 4 without noticing. I make enough ice cream that I have more egg whites than I know what to do with so I try and cut down when I can. I accidentally let the custard boil after adding my yolks (I have an 8 month old at home who's very distracting) and it curdled slightly. This was actually fine as long as you run it through a sieve before freezing, so no worries there. All in all, a pretty fussy recipe but *fabulous* tasting.

Fantastic! I substituted vanilla extract for the bean (didn't have any around) and it was great. I added 1 tsp extract to the egg yolks before pouring in the cooled liquid. Served with apple pie which was a great combo, but this ice cream is perfect on it's own.

If you like caramel ice cream you will love this one (even if you substitute the vanilla bean with good extract). And don't get nervous when you add the milk and you don't just have caramel bits but one large chunk. It will dissolve.
