unfortunately, and as i suspected when i first read this recipe, the batter doesn't allow for the proper cooking of the drumstick (which is what batter is designed to do, protect the meat or fish inside) and it was very difficult(nigh impossible)to get the chicken the correct doneness or texture--beer battered fish is one thing, chicken?, quite another--finally, not a great recipe--maybe deep-frying the drums first and then re-doing them with batter would work--i don't know

I think both rattings above me missed the directions given and used chicken legs (drumsticks). It is my understanding that the writer's recip called for wings, unjointed, and moving the meat from the small in to the lower end by scrapping it woen with a knife. leaving the clean bone on one end forming a drumstick.

As suggested by the person underneat me, i used tiny wings instead of drumsticks....in doing so the batter tasted so strong and formed such a thick coating on the tiny wings that it tasted like stale poison. Stick with the drumsticks.

Let me start by saying that I thought adding all those different spices for a deep fried drumstick was kinda pointless- and I was right. Unless you are deepfrying in the cleanest oil going (and most of us with deep-fryers like to keep the added taste in their oil), your battered sticks will taste simply like breaded chicken. I could've got the same effect with a basic flour batter. The thought of beer being invloved sounded sweet, but I couldn't tell the difference. I'd try again with some puny wings instead of drumsitcks to try to reduce the cook time and the resulting crispiness of the batter. As always, fried meat always sounds better than it tastes after the fact.

Very good texture on the batter. Eat with hot sauce.
