the fish itself was absolutely delicious! i agree with others that the potatoes didnt add much but everything else was to die for!

This was quite tasty. The potatoes were a little bland, though, even when thrown in with the vegetables. I might put in a clove or two of garlic with the aromatics next time. I really enjoyed the marinade on the fish.

It's getting cold in Ohio so I put the sword fish and vegetables under the broiler instead. It was delicious. I loved the rosemary. It made me feel a bit of the fall plus I got to use up the last of the zucchini and tomatoes from my garden.

This dish was pretty good, but let's not get carried away -- it's not a 4-forker. I would probably give it 2.5 if I could, but I can't, so I won't. :( The marinade is serviceable, but it's far from inspired. Ditto for the veggies. Sure, everyone likes cherry tomatoes with their swordfish, but this is nothing unusual, and there are no surprises. Okay in a pinch -- or if you're feeling just plain lazy.

This is the first new receipe, in a very long time, that I have made for my husband that he said he loved and I truly belived him. We already have plans to try this again with different fish.

Made this for a friend and she begged for the recipe. She then made it with mahi-mahi and her boyfriend loved it. Definitely a keeper. I used fresh regular tomatoes and added some green pepper too (just cause I had them) and it turned out wonderful. Definitely a good way to use up those summer garden veggies. Looks fancy, but very easy.

When I got to the store - the halibut looked much fresher than the swordfish - so I substituted. Also, I made it in the broiler and doubled the sauce recipe because I didn't use oil and I was worried it would be a bit dry. It was delicious! I make fish dishes three times a week and this will be a regular addition for sure.

This dish was pretty good overall, but not what I'd call a 4 fork rating. The swordfish was very good, though, and I will make that part of it again. I used regular Dijon mustard, I think it would be even better with the country-style. The vegetables were pretty good, but my family was not crazy about them, so I probably won't make them again, but it was nice for a change.

This is a wonderful recipe for guests. Everything can be prepared hours ahead, and when the guests are there, it just takes about 10 to 15 minutes to grill the fish and fry the vegetables. It looks colorful and appealing because of the cherry tomatoes. If there's a no-fish-eater present (like my husband), the vegetables are delicious also with a pork chop or a chicken breast.

I've been making this for years. It is wonderful! If i'm in too big of a hurry I just skip the veggies and do the fish. Everyone in the family loves it.

I made this last night and it was like a dish from a fine restaurant. It was so tasty and had presentation value.
