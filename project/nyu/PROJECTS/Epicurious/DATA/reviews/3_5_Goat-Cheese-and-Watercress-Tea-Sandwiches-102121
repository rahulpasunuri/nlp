I hosted a ladies' tea and made these sandwiches along with 5 other types. I wasn't very impressed. I made them about an hour before the guests arrived - perhaps not enough time for the flavors to blend. I didn't think the nuts adhered as well as I would have liked, despite a fine chop and a generous amount of softened butter. The biggest hit at my party was my own combo of Laughing Cow French Onion Wedge Cheese, Smoked Turkey, and Oroweat Oatnut bread as well as the mint cucumber found on this site.

Opted for whole wheat and was disappointed that it overwhelmed the other flavors. I'm pretty sure that the thickness of my bread (thin-ish but commercially sliced) was a problem. Made a grilled cheese sandwich with leftovers (unhealthy but not bad).

These were such a big hit at my party that by the time I went to get one for myself, they were gone! Luckily I'd tried them when I was cooking. I used the cinnamon raisin bread, and candied instead of toasted pecans.

Very blend and boring.

Brought this to a dinner party as an app and it was gone in 10 minutes. I thought it was pretty good, kinda fun, but everyone else went nuts.

I made this recipe but added the nuts to the cheese mixture to save time. Used cinnamon raisin bread. People really loved this, but I thought it was just okay. I tried some of the mixture on wheat crackers and liked it a lot better on those, so I might make it as a spread for crackers again.

This recipe is great - and also gave me the idea to combine it with one of my all-time favourite epicurious recipes - the Fig Walnut & Goat Cheese tapanade - its WONDERFUL.

This was a big hit for a baby shower. I used cinnamon bread and added the chopped pecans to the cheese mixture. They were delicious and disappeared fast.

Used the cinnamon raisin bread rather than whole wheat, and the flavors worked so well together! Easy to make, and the guests loved them.

Made these for a ladies tea and they were a hit! The only thing I changed was I cut the goat cheese to half the amount and substituted cream cheese. (for personal preference only)They were beautiful, easy to make and delicious!

Delicious!!!!! Only changed one thing, I added some chopped pitted dates to the cheese mixture.

For a recent bridal shower I made these sandwiches, the chicken salad tea sandwiches with smoked almonds, and the smoked salmon with wasabi cream cheese sandwiches. They were all a hit, but the chicken salad was the most popular. I did however love the flavor and texture contrasts of the goat cheese, the raisins, and the pecans. These are far less labor-intensive than the chicken salad. Loved it!

Excellent! The cheese filling may be used as a spread for crackers. I was surprised at how good the watercress tasted within the sandwich.

These sandwiches were a huge hit at my sister's wedding shower. I prepared the filling the day before, trying to minimize day-of preparations. I also roasted the nuts myself which brought out the sweetness of the pecan to this delicious sandwich. I look forward to making these again.

Very, very good! I was uneasy about the combination at first but the contrasts in flavor make for a delicious sandwich. I used cinnamon raisin bread and "Almond Accents" honey-roasted almonds which made the sandwich a bit sweeter. It was the favorite of the guest of honor at a baby shower.

I tried this for a party. It was not nearly as popular as (Smoked turkey with arugula mayo sandwiches also at this website). I thought the cinnamon in the bread tasted weird, almost bitter, with the goat cheese. Maybe the bread I used was too sweet and not dense enough but I didn't think it was worth the effort.

Just made these sandwiches along with other tea sandwiches for a baby shower. I had to make the sandwiches the morning of the shower, and knew I would be short on time. So instead of rolling the sides of the sandwiches in nuts, I used raisin walnut bread with the crusts cut off. Less work, and you still get the raisin-nut-goat cheese combination. They were delicious and the favorite of the mother-to-be!

This was a HUGE hit at my daughter's bridal shower tea! I used cinnamon raisin bread, which was a lovely contrast to the goat cheese. The sandwiches looked lovely and tasted divine.

The bread is such an important part of this recipe. I was cutting the bread next to an open window and it started to dry out. A wet paper towel placed over the sandwiches came to the rescue!. Another tip, is getting the butter REALLY soft and rolling the edges rather than spreading them with a knife before rolling them in the nuts. I found this to be a lot faster!

Made these for a bridal shower with several other tea sandwiches listed on this site. These were the overall favorite.

These were a huge hit...A great combination of flavors and textures. The sweetness of the raisins, paired with the saltiness of the goat cheese, and the crunchy nuttiness of the pecans made for an interesting and delicious sandwich indeed. I didn't have difficulty adhering the pecans...Just butter generously, and chop the nuts finely.

I made these for a bridal shower along with Smoked Turkey & Arugula tea sandwiches and Cucumber Mint Tea Sandwiches. These weren't snatched up as fast as the others, but people did like them once they tried them. The pecans were hard to put on, they didn't stick as well as I hoped. Otherwise this recipe was great, easy to prepare and very tasty.

These were so easy, yet so good! These were part of a spread that we put together for a baby shower and someone asked me if I had considered becoming a caterer!!!
