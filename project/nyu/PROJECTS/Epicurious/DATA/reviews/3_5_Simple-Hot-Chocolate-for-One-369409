Don't use chocolate chips. There's some sort of non-melting chemical in them that makes them stay chunky and greasy tasting. I added cinnamon. I've done this with a Hershey's milk chocolate bar and it was good!

Perfect for a writing afternoon. Used unsweetened soy milk, bittersweet chips, and the rest. Terribly rich and delicious!
