Gee, this is my 1st review after using Epi for years. Anyway, this was a terrifically easy dinner for 2 on weeknight. Per another suggestion I used mandoline to slice eggplant. Big difference from what my dull knives produce. Upped garlic, lemon, etc. and did add parmesean to sauce. Presentation was beautiful. Surprised myself!

Our family loved this recipe, even the middle school aged kids. I used a little more garlic and lemon in the sauce and as someone noted some basil. You can tweak any sauce but the basic recipe was great and had broad appeal.

as one reviewer noted, best to heat pan and a tablespoon of olive oil in oven first. for eggplant, sliced 1/8 inch thick, spread slices on a cutting board and added s/p, olive oil, grated parmesan, cayenne pepper. layered slices like fish scales as someone suggested, placed over fish filets, broiled in preheated pan. for sauce, added to blender garlic chives, Thai basil, cayenne pepper, butter pat. gave way more taste, was rather bland without extras. made what would have been a somewhat bland dish into a really good dish.

It tasted fine, but didn't knock my socks off. The husband wasn't impressed either. I had to remove the eggplant from the oven well before the fish was done or else they would have disintegrated. The sauce could have used more kick.

This recipe turns out really elegant. I do recommend doubling the citrus and mint called for in the recipe. I also used oranges (instead of lemons) and added about a tablespoon of the zest to the sauce when pureeing it. Finally, instead of doing long slices of the eggplant, I used a mandoline to slice small circles and arranged them like scales on the fish (I saw this Iron Chef America once with potatoes) and it looked just beautiful! Really bright tasting and worth the work...

This turned out light and restaurant quality. I made it with orange roughy instead and added a dab of butter on the fish and in the sauce. I roasted the red pepper the night before, peeled the skin, and then added more garlic and lemon juice than the recipe called for. The sauce was amazing. I broiled the japanese eggplant beside the fish instead of on top, so the fish would get nicely browned on top. The dish turned out great and I will definitely make it again. Even my ten year old son liked the sauce.

This was light and restaurant quality. I used orange roughy from trader joes and added a dab of butter on each fillet in the broiler and also used a little butter in the pan for the sauce. I used only one red bell pepper, more garlic and more lemon juice than the recipe called for. I quartered the japanese eggplant and laid them beside the fillets. I rounded out the plate with roasted red potatoes. The fish dish and the sauce were superb.

I used broiled red bell peppers for the sauce and cayenne pepper instead of black pepper. Sole fillets will make a chic dinner for two.

Turned out so so. I liked the fish and the eggplants enough but the sauce was rather bland. I also had problem with the eggplants starting to char before the fish got cooked thru, had to turn them so they did not burn. Next time, I may roast it at a lower temp and use a spicy tomato sauce.

I didn't find this recipe interesting at all. It sounded good at first but was quite blah. Also, it said to broil for 10 min with the eggplant on top..well the eggplant was cooked before the fish. It wasn't the worst recipe but certainly wouldn't make it again.

Excellent dish. I made two changes.. 1 I added a hot pepper to the pan with the bell peppers 2 I let the dish warm up a few minutes in the preheated oven prior to turning it to broil
