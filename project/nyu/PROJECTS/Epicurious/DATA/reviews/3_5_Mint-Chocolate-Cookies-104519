Easy and delicious! I added a small amount of black cocoa powder from King Arthur's to give them a wonderful dark chocolate color, almost like Oreos.

I made these with one change. I only had Dutch cocoa so omitted the baking soda and increased the baking powder to 1 tablespoon. I followed vinorosso's advice and baked them for 9 minutes. They came out perfectly, and I thought the balance of mint to chocolate was spot on!

The batter for this is soooo yummy! I love this recipe! In my opinion chocolate and mint go hand in hand so this is a great recipe for me! I ommited 1/2 cup flour and added some white chocolate chips( im not a huge fan of them but sometimes their nice)they were great. I added all the flour it called for and it was perfect! I only put in 3/4 the butter it called for and 3 tbs of vegetable oil. They were wonderful!

This is my favorite Christmas cookie. I bake the cookies for 9 minutes exactly, rotating trays mid-way. They will not look done, but they'll firm up as they cool, and stay chewy for days. Buy an oven thermometer to make sure your oven is always set at the proper temperature.

DELICIOUS!! I took the advice of others and cut the flour to 1 1/2 cups and increased the peppermint extract to 1 tsp. I also only baked them for about 8 minutes. They were perfect. I will make these again soon!

These cookies are delicious and easy to make. I decreased the flour to 1 1/2 cups and increased the peppermint extract to almost 2 tsp (although I may add more extract the next time I make them) as others suggested. I also added a few mint chocolate chips to the top of each cookie before baking. These are one of my favorite cookies ever.

Fantastic cookies and great flavor. I kept the flour as called for and surprise, I did not have any problems with the dough being sticky or the cookies spreading too much. It needs the 2 cups. I did increase the extract to 2 tsp. I did not find it too minty at all. I think it is just the right level of mint for the cocoa. I completely agree with the reviewer who said there is a fine line between perfect and overdone. One batch I took out when I thought they were ready and they turned hard. The second batch I took out according to the recipe (and I thought too early, as they were still soft and poofy) and they remained soft even after cooling. Never fear, the hard ones were used in ice cream sandwiches with homemade coconut ice cream. Delish!

i gave three forks only because i don't like chocolate! but everyone i gave these to loved them - without my own enraptured tastebuds i don't want to give out the very special fourth fork :-) alterations: i cut the flour down to 1.5 cups and doubled the mint extract as suggested by other reviewers. i also cut the sugar to 1.25 cups (1.75 just seemed like waaaay too much, and my sweet-toothed loved ones were still enamored). also, i added milk chocolate chips, though next time i would use white chocolate instead. the dusting of icing sugar on the top is a nice touch... i think thin, hard icing would be lovely as well.

Very easy to make and the end result was better than expected, with two caveats: a. use peppermint oil (as one of the other reviewers had suggested -- makes for a more intense flavor) and b. after the cookies cool, place in a sealed container overnight before eating(the flavors meld together strongly for that amazing chocolate/mint combination). Didn't do the powdered sugar, but it'd be nice if I made these for company. My only issue (as someone else had mentioned) was that the dough was a bit sticky in texture. I recommend using a small ice cream scoop, then a dampened fork to slightly flatten the cookies before baking. Otherwise, no need to further alter the recipe (although I may try the suggestion about making these into ice cream sandwiches with mint chocolate chip ice cream, or even a good vanilla ice cream...yum!)

Like the majority here, I lowered the flour to 1.5 cups. I used pastry flour (nb: I'm Canadian). I used 10 good jiggers essential orange oil instead of peppermint and also added 1/2 tsp vanilla (can you have cookies without vanilla?). I made big cookies - ~22 and they were perfect after 9 minutes. Flattened out considerably upon leaving the oven, but were moist and rich and delicious! My best advice on these cookies is that there is a very fine line between perfect perfect perfect and overcooked.

Once you make some changes this is a great recipe. The flour should be lowered by one fouth. Also a cup of mini chocolate chips are a must, I used milk chocolate bt I think semi sweet would be best. Many reviewers commented that the amount of extract was too little. I thought it should be upped by about a fourth of a teaspoon, I think the cookies should have a mint undertone not be too minty. Also a nice drizzle of icing makes them a really pretty cookie. They have a nice texture, crunchy but not tough. This would be a four star recipe except that I had to make modifications.

Quick, simple, easy and yummy. Cooked a little faster than the recipe said, but I'd make them again.

i had to add 2 tsp. peppermint extract to get a nice mint flavor. it was also a very sticky dough. i think an even better recipe is the chocolate- espresso cookie on this website with the added peppermint. i used 12 oz of semi-sweet chocolate chips as well with the espresso recipe and they were the bomb!

These are our new favorite cookies. When they were done, I did dip them in melted chocolate to which I added a drop or two of peppermint oil. I also kept the peppermint extract in the cookie dough. I love the texture of these cookies, ours came out somewhere between chewy and crisp. I only had Hershey's dark cocoa powder on hand so that is what I used. Also the chocolate I melted was special melting chocolate from a cake decorating store. While they were cooling we put them in the fridge and they came out glossy. Tasted better than the girl scouts. Sorry girlscouts, we'll only be ordering peanut butter patties next year!

These cookies turned out to be pretty ordinary . .. Actually, I don't know what I was expecting with mint chocolate cookies. Perhaps they would have been better if I could cut them into shapes for Christmas, but they spread too much on the cookie sheet, so I was forced to do the traditional drop cookies. Even though I doubled the mint extract, I could barely taste the mint. They tasted more like plain old chocolate cookies. A bit of a let down.

Made these three times for three different groups this season, and they were devoured each time. Increased peppermint extract to 1 1/2 tsp, reduced flour to 1 1/2 cups (made less dense), and added 1 c. dark chocolate chips (I used Ghirardelli 60& cacao chips). Dropped by tablespoon onto baking sheets (aluminum foil worked just as well as parchment paper) and put one mint choc. Hershey's kiss on top of each. Reduced baking time to 8-9 mins. A holiday staple for me now!

These are so yummy, I'm scared about them not making it to Thanksgiving dinner! I took all of the advice given - - decreased the flour and doubled the mint. Still made for a thick 'n hard-to-stir batter, but the cookies turned out fab. I used that new Hershey Special Dark cocoa and wow.. talk about chocolately- minty goodness! Also added semisweet morsels somewhat by accident - - I thought I'd grabbed the dark chocolate bag, but they were still a delicious touch! These are a keeper!

Never having met a cookie that I didn't like, I have to say these were good, but nothing special- even after doubling the mint and decreasing the flour, as others had suggested.

I have made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out a little crumbly. The second time I reduced the baking time to 9.5 minutes and added chunks of bittersweet chocolate. They turned out out fudgy and chewy and we LOVED them...

These cookies were very good. The peppermint extract gave them a nice touch. They were nice and soft in the middle, which is how I like my cookies. After I added the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to the mixture, it was getting difficult to mix, so I had to use my hands, so it was a little messy. But, overall, these cookies were a hit.

I read previous reviews and made the following modifications: - Precisely doubled the peppermint extract - Only used 1.5 cups of flour - Made cookies larger and barely flattened at all before baking - Baked for only 8-9 minutes - Added ghirardelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate chips (i didnt measure the amount i added, just stirred them in until i felt it was enough) After these changes, the cookies came out beautifully: soft, slightly chewy, firm edges, not burnt at all, and with rich chocolatyness and clean peppermint flavor. Everyone from my 1 year-old baby sister to my anti-mint grandmother LOVED them. FANTASTIC RECIPE!!! [with the neccessary modifications, of course!]

I followed Los Angeles's suggestions with two exceptions 1) I kept the flour at 2 cups and added it gradually 2) after 7 minutes in the oven, I sprinkled mashed sugar canes on the tops of each cookie and then put them back in the oven for 2 more minutes. The candy slightly melted which gave them a great holiday look. And they are SOOO tasty, too!

This is my favorite cookie recipe! I have tried several different chocolate chips in the recipe and have found dark chocolate chunks to be the best. I have also made the recipe with orange extract instead of mint. Delicious!

P.S. I also chilled the dough for 30 minutes prior to rolling them into balls.

The first time a made these cookies I followed the recipe exactly as written. This time I took other reviewers advice and the cookies were so much better! I did the following 1) reduced the amount of flour to 1.5 cups; 2) increased the peppermint extract to 2 1/2 tsp; 3) added a bag of bitter sweet chocolate chips into the dough. I like bitter sweet over the semi or milk choclate - I think if you used semi or milk it would have been way to sweet. But I like dark chocolate more than milk chocolate; and 4) rolled the top of the cookie dough in sugar prior to baking. I also did a time test baking separate batches at 11 minutes, 10 minutes and 9 minutes. I like a chewier cookie - so 9 minutes was the winner!

I made these for St. Patricks day. I chilled the dough then rolled it out to cut into shamrock shapes. Maybe I didn't have the best peppermint extract but, I had to triple the amount to get a prominent peppermint flavour. This is a definate keeper. Next time, I'm going to roll the dough around a Junior Mint - surprise in the middle!

I always get rave reviews whenever I make these cookies. I actually add 3 (high quality) milk chocolate chips to the top of each cookie before I put them in the oven. GREAT RECIPE. great with vanilla bean ice cream too!

Cutting down on the cocoa and adding real chocolate sounds like the only thing that would make these delicious. I forgot that my chocolate craving isn't satisfied by cocoa powder!

Excellent, excellent!! This cookies was simple to make and delicious. I added extra peppermint to get more of a minty flavor and cut down the cooking time to get a soft, chewy cookie (nine minutes in the oven and one minute on the baking sheet when they came out). I also cut back the cocoa to 3/4 cup and added chocolate chips. They are an absolute favorite now!

Rating: 3
I was blissfully ignorant upon first tasting this cookie... I thought it was really good, until I started reading all these reviews and found out how wrong I was! I made these from the original recipe that I'd ripped out of the magazine, and followed it exactly. The first one from the oven was wonderful, but once cooled they're a little crunchier than I'd prefer, so next time I'll try to incorporate some of the ideas here. This was a great project for my 3 & 5 year olds, though - easy tasks that could be separated between them.

THey are delicious, and I will make them again. I have an electric oven and recommend that they only be in 11 minutes. VERY EASY and good

Excellent cookie! Word of caution, don't go overboard on the peppermint! I put in 2.5x the amount suggested in the recipe, since others said it needed more. 2.5x is a little overpowering- next time I will precisely double the mint. Also, I put in the recipe flour amount and mine were a great consistency- just add slowly- not all at once! I also added white chocolate chips which were a nice contrast in color and texture.

I doubled the mint extract and decreased the baking time to 9 minutes. The cookies turned out much more flavorful and moist. I will definitely make these again.

Very delicious, soft and chewy cookies with just the right anount of mint. I flattened the cookies with a glass bottom dipped in granulated sugar. I also made the cookies slightly larger than recommended and filled 2 cookies with mint chocolate chip ice cream for mint chocolate ice cream sandwiches. Very yummy!

These cookies were good but not great. I used mint extract (a blend of spearmint and peppermint) and found that the flavor was too mild. I did as another reviewer suggested and added 1 cup of chocolate chips and cut the bake time to 11 minutes which helped keep the cookie moist.

These cookies are so dry and need added moisture and more peppermint extract than the recipe calls for. Not the best recipe.

Yummy cookies! I used only 1.5 cups of flour. I used peppermint oil instead of extract to give it a stronger flavor. I also drizzled a generous amount of semi-sweet chocolate on top. They taste much more like Thin Mints than the other recipe. I will defnitely make these again. They were a big hit.

I have never baked before, but these cookies were so easy to make, and very tasty! I added the 1 cup of chocolate chips as suggested, and used peppermint oil instead of extract, which made the peppermint taste a little stronger, but not too strong. i also made the cookies slightly larger (did not flatten too much) and baked for 2 extra minutes, which made the cookies come out crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. Perfect!

2 cups of flour and one cup of cocoa! I should have known they were going to be dry. Next time I make this recipe, I will take out one cup of flour and add chcoclate chips. The cookies looked beautiful and tasted good, but a little to dry for my taste.

These cookies were TERRIFIC- the perfect combination of mint and chocolate! And they're so soft! They were a hit at a cookie exchange party and at work. They taste even better with a cup of chocolate chips and a dash more peppermint extract! Easy to make too- My only criticism is that the dough is VERY sticky and difficult to work with...I had to flour my hands to keep the dough from caking on them. Also, I used waxed paper instead of parchment paper and the cookies came out nice and puffy- not flat... just shorten the baking time to 10 or 11 minutes so the paper doesn't burn. I will definitely make these again!!!

I doubled the mint extract and made much larger cookies but followed the recipe otherwise, and they turned out great. I plan on adding bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips next time to make them super rich. Powdered sugar on top makes for a great presentation. Make sure you don't overcook them so they retain their moisture!

I was looking for a moist, slightly chewy cookie, and these came out too flat, crispy, and dry. I added some chocolate chips (semi-sweet) to part of the batch and this helped somewhat, but not enough for me to want to make them again. Aside from the texture issues, the taste was wonderful--I love chocolate and mint combinations and this was a perfect blend of the two flavors.

If you don't care for cookies that are flat, thin and spread out, then you won't care for these. I thought these were not worth the effort. Guess I should have known with real butter they would spread on the cookie sheet. And they did. To many other recipes that are better.

These cookies turned out extremely well, and they taste delicious! There is just the right combination of chocolate and peppermint.

Wow, these cookies are excellent. Very easy to make and a huge reward for not much effort. They are very rich and just minty enough. Everyone has loved them. The powdered sugar finishes it off beautifully and makes them look very festive.
