There was one change I did make, come to think of it. I used vegetable broth in place of water.

Excellent tasty recipe with the garlic yogurt sauce! Made the recipe just as set forth, except I took another reviewer's advice and roasted the stuffed tomatoes in a 400 degree oven for about 20 minutes. YUMMMMMM! I have to say the garlic yogurt sauce is a MUST, It goes so well with the stuffed tomatoes. The combo makes an excellent meal... I'm making it again this week!

Made so many substitutions, but it turned out wonderful. Time consuming, but tasty with complex flavors. I substituted beef broth for the water, walnuts (chopped fine) for the pine nuts, quinoa for the bulgur, golden raisins for the currants, and fresh thyme for the dill. Also added a pinch of cumin at the end. It needs the yogurt sauce to be complete.

There are other, similar recipes with the same amount of effort but a higher reward.

Have made this many times. Totally delicious and very healthy. However instead of tomato I use red and yellow peppers which I half and roast before stuffing. The Yogurt sauce is an absolute must.

Very nice, hearty, tasty and healthy. I make them without the dill and lentils.

Unbelievably delicious. I'm planning on making this over and over. The mix of flavors was complex and sophisticated. The sauce really does make the dish just that much better. I substituted kale for the swiss chard, but next time will use either swiss chard or spinach... the kale was just a bit too tough. Excellent dish.

These are very good. In my opinion, the yogurt sauce is a must and really tops off the dish. I also agree with other reviewers and next time I will roast the tomatoes first. I think it would add even more flavor.

I burned my lentils as well the first try, so the second time, i just put a bunch of water and drained them afterward. Used raisins instead of currants, and thawed frozen spinach for the chard. my only issue was that there was not enough bulgur. i think i'll double it next time, and maybe reduce the spinach instead. and i will dry roast the pinenuts because the oil didn't seem necessary. roasting the tomatoes is an interesting idea. they were good raw, but i think roasted would be very tasty. very yummy vegan dish. oh yeah, and the yogurt sauce was excellent. would make a good salad dressing as well, but i think i'll puree the garlic and salt next time - i couldn't mash it up enough. still good though.

Very nice recipe for all the summer tomatoes! I used spinach. Skipped dill (dill? with this recipe? no thanks). Needed a little something...not sure what - -herbs I suppose, esp. as I skipped dill (happily). I topped with a light shred of pecorino cheese. My husband thought it odd not to roast the tomatoes once filled so he did so with a few and claims they were better tasting than the raw tomato shells.

Wonderful presentation blended with wonderful flavor. Delicious mix of sweet and savory. A great way to use fresh summer produce. The combination of textures with the chewy bulgar, the leafy greens (I used chard) and the crunchy nuts was just excellent! Healthy, fun and yummy. I used raisins instead of currants - worked great! Next time I'd dry roast the pine nuts in a pan or oven. When I cooked the lentils, the water ran out before they got tender and ended up burning. I had to do them over with more water. Skipped the yogurt sauce, but I'll try it next time. The filling is so good I'd make it on its own as a side dish.

like everyone here, i think this dish is wonderful. instead of currants, i used dried cranberries, which worked very nicely. i'd like to find a decent substitute for the pine nuts since they were so expensive--sesame? sliced almonds?--but even then, i would try to use pine nuts. also think about putting broth in with the spinach and bulgur--it adds another dimension of richness.

Fabulous! Interesting mix of flavors and easy to make. Followed the recipe to a tea, except at the end we baked them in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes. Delicious and I received many compliments from our gourmet group. However, it would be much more economical to make in the summer when tomatoes are in season. We used the leftover tomato insides for chili the next day.

Loved this dish! We didn't have bulgar, so I used couscous instead and it still turned out wonderfully (with perhaps a slightly lighter taste!). An excellent side or main dish depending on how big the tomatoes are and how much you stuff them!

This is absolutely delicious. It is so nice to find a healthy recipe that tastes this good! I didn't have any pine nuts, so omitted them. Substituted chopped "mission figlets" for the currants. Great tangy and sweet flavors. I served it with the eggplant. Yum!

Excellent recipe! I made this as the starch and vegetable accompaniment for a Sea Bass recipe. It was just for my husband and I so a lot of work and ingredients for 2 stuffed tomatoes. It can be made ahead and served at room temperature - definitely company worthy and more worth the effort. I think the stuffing as called for for 6 tomatoes is probably enough for 8.

This is a really good, hearty dish. We had it as a main course, but it would make an excellent accompaniment. I replaced the currants with raisins, but I otherwise stuck to the resipe and really enjoyed it. The yogurt sauce definitely helps bind the flavors.
