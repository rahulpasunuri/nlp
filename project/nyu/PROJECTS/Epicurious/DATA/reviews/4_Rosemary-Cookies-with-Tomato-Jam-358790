At first I liked these, but the more I ate of them, the weirder they tasted. They're a great novelty and people liked them, but I won't be making them again.

These are my favorite cookies. I have never made them with the tomato jam, to keep it easy. They are classy cookies and taste good even with coffee or tea--not too sweet and the rosemary is perfect. I imagine you could substitute lavender. Highly recommended.

This has become my new go-to for cookies. I use the dough recipe but don't bother with the tomato jam/sandwich thing. Just simple cookies. I used a christmas tree cookie cutter this year which was nice with the rosemary (Christmas Tree cookies).

The tomato jam is SWEET even though I cut the sugar back. It is tasty and different but I think there are better tomato jam recipes out there. The cookies are very easy and sophisticated. I reduced the sugar to 9 TBS and made them into thumbprints instead of sandwiches and they turned out beautifully.

Delightful and unexpected. Delicate yellowish cookie with a rustic flavor from the cornmeal. Made it by the book. Cut the cookies quickly once out of the fridge (keep 'em thin). The cookies themselves - minus the jam - would be lovely on their own, particularly as a semi-savory tea cookie. Awesome.

Without question, these cookies were the hit of the cookie swap. I doubled the ingredients for the dough and it came together easily (which isn't always the case when doubling recipes). The dough alone makes a great-tasting cookie, if you don't want to make the jam or go through the time-consuming assembly of a sandwich cookie. I'm sure it would work well as a cut-out cookie, too. I also didn't bake the cookies as long as the instructions say to because the first batch started to brown and I preferred to have them retain their lovely cookie color and have a softer bite. The tomato jam recipe does not state how long you should expect to stand & stir the jam. Mine took over an hour, probably because of the volume. I tripled the tomato jam recipe so I'd have some leftover for breakfast breads and crackers for the rest of the week. This cookie is a keeper.

This recipe was phenomenal! I have had so many requests for it, and I loved the light cookie with the sweet jam. I did have to puree my jam a little bit as it didn't get completely soft, but it ended up absolutely delicious.

These are great. Eat them with the jam, any jam, or something savory. They're easy, tasty, and practical.

Wow- fantastic! So interesting. The cookies are very much a shortbread type of cookie, and the texture is great with the polenta. I actually made them with semolina instead of polenta one day when I was short, and I think it still had a great texture. Very mild, the rosemary was much better than I expected. These flew off the plate to 2 year olds and grandparents alike! Next time you have to bring a cocktail treat - wow everyone with your sophisticated palate! With the ease of preperation, and long storage times, you can be ready on a minutes notice!

Loved these cookies. Unique and not too sweet. The polenta adds a nice crunch. I made them for a cocktail buffet and people were delighted and curious. These cookies would make a great addition to a cheese course. And the tomato jam is so simple and delicious.
