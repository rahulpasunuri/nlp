I've been making this for YEARS!!!! Use chicken stock and reduce the water and increased the lemon and garlic. I love the delicate flavor and would NEVER consider it bland.

I have been making this for YEARS!! A bit long in the preparation but worth the effort made as is.

Actually forgot to get the brussels sprouts, since I had all the other ingredients. It was o.k. - I ended up serving it with baked fish - nice but not great.

Thanks to everyone for their reviews. I will probably be chastised by the militant who believe you can only review a recipe followed exactly, but I used this as a starting point. I left out the cabbage and leeks (didn't have any). I rendered bacon, removed, drained some of the fat and added olive oil and then sauteed garlic, shallots, and anchovies adding 1/4 sprouts (will chop finer next time), added white wine after sprouts began to brown and covered, then added pasta and a little of the water. Topped with parsley. Fairly easy and pretty good. I think lemon might help, didn't have any, not sure about the thyme, may help. I rated 3 stars because I think this dish has huge potential. I love the sprouts with the bacon and pasta.

I loved this! I halved the recipe and added chopped pancetta. I didn't think it had too much liquid, as some reviews said. I simmered uncovered for about 10 minutes, and covered for 5. Reheats well!

So, I got adventurous and tried this. I wished I would've read the reviews first. Seemed like alot of work for the outcome, not so great. I followed the recipe and it has way too much liquid. oh well....

This dish doesn't know if it should be a soup or a pasta. I served it with fresh bacon pieces, which definitely helped. If I was going to make it again, I would make it more like a soup, with less noodles, and I'd add cooked pork or bacon to it.

followed the recipe as altered by previous posts. It's good but I probably won't make this again. There are much better recipes for brussel sprouts. I would suggest making sure not to add too much lemon juice as I did and it cooked straight into the brussel sprouts, making them taste a little acidic. I also needed to put a LOT of cheese on top!

I got in a tizzy and did not let the wine cook into the vegetables (added water too soon); I also neglected to add additional oil and butter; used summer savory instead of thyme; and I only used 3 cups of water and none of the pasta water (don't know what the point of that is): Despite these little boo-boos, my vegetarian husband liked this dish. I found it a bit bland but may try it again. I'm sure the cheese would have helped too.

Surprisingly delicious. I added chile flakes and some leftover fresh mozzarella but it would have been really tasty without either.

I reversed the order of cooking with great results. Cut Brussels Sprouts into quarters and braised in olive oil until a bit golden. Removed from skillet and cooked other ingredients as indicated (except cabbage - I used Napa cabbage). I also used 50/50 chicken stock and water. Added back Brussels Sprouts and cabbage and finished up. Used only as much pasta water as necessary - don't need as much as called for.

Not awful, but not good either. I was pretty disappointed. Won't make this one again.

I followed this recipe to the letter until 2 minutes before dinner. Then I tossed in the remainder of an open can of anchovies, with the oil, and some chopped up turkey bacon, which saved this dish from terminal blandness. I second the suggestions to substantially reduce the water and also suggest making one day ahead and saving the linguine to add the next day. A sit in the frig does wonders for this dish.

Couple of small changes and this is an incredibly tasty recipe. Another reviewer recommended changing 4 cups of water to 2 cups water and 2 cups chicken stock, I agree. The recipe suggests taking 2 cups of water from the pasta. Not needed. Additionaly the recipe call for covering the pan while reducing the liquid and cooking the vegetables. Don't do this as you are not going to reduce liquids by covering the pan. The recipe results with these changes were wonderul and we will make this again and again and again.

I wasn't impressed by this dish - even with a few fixes suggested by others. It's not bad, just not great (and not really worth my time). I'm glad I tried it, but we won't be making it again.

Surprisingly tasty for very simple ingredients. I made (almost) as written, but used 1 1/2 cups water with 1/2 cup chicken broth for the first addition of liquid. Also, an onion because I didn't have a leek. The sauce/broth becomes really velvety in texture, and delicious--I suppose that's the butter.

This was surprisingly tasty. I followed the recipe word for word except I did not add as much water as it called for, probably used only 1 1/2 cups. I agree that by adding pancetta or sausage this meal could be brought up a notch. We added grated romano cheese on top and thought it went well with the dish also.

Very subtle flavor, bordering on bland. Tastier the next day as the pasta absorbed more of the broth, but then the noodles were much softer than one would ideally like. Simple, fresh, and light.

Delicious! Didn't make any changes and it turned out great. I thought the amount of liquid made for a nice broth. Kept adjusting the salt until it brought out the other flavors just right. A surprisingly nice weeknight dish.

I did this recipe pretty much as written and it was surprisingly wonderful. Rich, sweet, flavours balanced with the acid from the wine and lemon juice. I added browned chorizo sausage meat, which I think was an improvement. Bacon would also work well. Didn't need so much water reserved.

Surprisingly wonderful. I used less than the 2 cups of water but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I fried some chorizo sausage meat and added it - I felt it went well. Bacon would also work well.
