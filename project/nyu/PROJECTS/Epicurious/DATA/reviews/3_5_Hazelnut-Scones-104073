Made this for Thanksgiving dinner, substituting Frangelico for vanilla as suggested by another cook. Had to add a bit of flour during kneading phase as the dough was very sticky. Nevertheless, the scones turned out perfect. Drew absolute raves! Delicious!

This was just great! I made this for a "try-out" on my parents, and my Dad asked me for the recipe! He made it for the church congregation coffee hour and it dissipeared within minutes! Needless to say, he did make several batches in the industrial ovens. Yum!!

I used toasted walnuts and 1 t. mex.vanilla. I also forgot to reserve 1 1/2 T. of wet ingred. so dough really sticky, but I worked with it anyway, without adding extra flour. Nice suprise very moist fluffy scones!

I made this exactly as written and I think it's a great scone recipe. Easy and quick to make, excellent nosh for breakfast with a nice cup of coffee. I, too, think it will be a great "starter" recipe for experimentation. Maybe next time I'll do pecans with some orange zest, or walnuts and extra vanilla. Yum!

These just were not all that I expected. I think that it is probably a good 'starter' recipe (to which you can add what you like), but as written it is neither incredibly flavorful nor a stand-out in the scone category. If I wanted to improve on it, I'd add lemon zest and perhaps some dried, chopped fruit, as another reviewer suggested. I think we'll stick with our favorite, the Chocolate Chip Scones (also from this site).

I used 2% instead of whole milk and chocolate chips for hazelnuts, and it was still great. Used some scones for apricot-raspberry shortcake offered on this site; it was excellent!

The only substitution I made was to use Frangelico for the vanilla. These were fantastic.

The scones were great, I used heavy cream instead of the milk and sour cream. I also found that baking the scones for only 15 minutes was best.

I used only 4 T butter, substituted yogurt for sour cream, and soy milk for whole milk. They came out delicious!

This was very easy to make as I had leftover toasted hazelnuts in the fridge...I made it as I cleaned up from dinner. These are good and very eat-able. My husband ate three within an hour of taking them out of the oven. I suggested using Frangelico instead of vanilla, but he said don't change a thing. My 2.5 year old loved them, too.

Light & delicious

One of the best scone recipes I've made. I used the Cuisinart to mix the butter and flour (as you do for tart dough), and used heavy cream instead of milk. Superb!

We had no hazelnuts so we substituted about 1/3 cup of raisins and 1/3 cup chopped dried apples & apricots. We also had no sour cream, so we substituted (forgive us!) some liquified dry milk in a thick solution. We also doubled the vanilla and made our own glaze of confectioners sugar and egg white. The scones came out delicious, light and fluffy, fruit was slightly chewy (perfect, in other words), with a little extra 'bite' from the vanilla.

This is a great basic scone recipe because it allows for experimentation.I replaced the hazelnuts with raisins because they were all I had in the house, and the scones still turned out great.

I made these to take on a "wreath making" adventure. They were delicious and very tender. I was generous with the hazelnuts which are grown near here.

Delicious scones, got many compliments after making them. I used 2% instead of whole and I think it can out great. For a nuttier taste, I used more hazlenuts which were very coarsely chopped. For a tasty snack, serve with honey.
