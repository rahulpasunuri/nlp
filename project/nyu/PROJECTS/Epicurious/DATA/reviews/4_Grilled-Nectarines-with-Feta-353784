I did this recipe but like others used goat cheese. I also added a balsamic reduction and served it as a dessert with Sauterne. The flavors were incredible! I served it after the Grilled Gazpacho Salad with Shrimp. What a great ending to a summer grill fest!

This adds a fantastic sweetness to any grill night!

We decided to do 2 halves as the recipe called for, and 2 halves with goat cheese, which I thought sounded much better. The feta was surprisingly good - really nice contrast, as noted below, b/w the sweetness of the fruit and the saltiness of the feta. But the goat cheese was truly delicious, and felt more like a dessert. We also had trouble halving the nectarines - our second try we just sliced 2 big slices instead of trying to twist and separate from the pit. We'll definitely make again!

Yum! I ended up quartering some of the nectarines because they were very ripe. The saltiness of the feta with the sweet, smokey flavor of the nectarines was nice. Could serve as a summer dessert.

Great side with grilled fish...really recommend oiling grill first...if they stick at all, you lose the grill marks. I think they would be great with goat cheese as alternative. Brenda from Vancouver, BC
