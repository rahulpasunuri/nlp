Awful. Not the traditional chicken and dumplings I was hoping for. Didn't like a single thing about this recipe. The dumplings are always my favorite part, these were not even close to what simple Biquick has to offer.

Turned out great! I used half dill and added yellow and green beans and carrots.

I really liked this! I ended up omitting the dill completely because I thought I had it and then didn't. And I didn't have mushrooms either. I added spinach and peas at the end.

I made this last week and thought it was great. If you are comparing it to the more traditional, heavy chicken and dumplings...then yes, you might be disappointed...but this was a great weeknight dinner. I used more garlic than it said to, and instead of chopping it used a garlic press to get max extraction. I will make it again!

sorry to say I wasnt impressed with this recipe...I followed it to the letter but the chicken and dumplings werent as moist as Id hoped. I did enjoy the taste of the dumplings though and was happy that I decided to only use 1 tsp of dill instead of the suggested 2 tsp, that def would have been too overpowering.

The amount of dill in the dumplings was excessive and overpowered the rest of the soup. Other than dill, the dish was lacking in flavor. I've made several different chicken & dumplings recipes, and this was my least favorite. The recipe is quite easy, so I'm disappointed it didn't taste better!

Quick and easy; perfect for a weeknight dinner. Will add more vegetables next time.
