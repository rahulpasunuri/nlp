Very good for a cold night. I cut back on the butter and it came out great.

If you love garlic this is the soup for you. Savory, delicious, creamy, rich and wonderful this recipe will not only delight your taste buds it will clear your sinuses. I was looking for a soup that included garlic because of it's antibacterial properties and found this one ideal because it also included cayenne pepper which is wonderful for sore throats and coughs (only to name 2 of its numerous benefits. This is natures medicine at it's best. I will be modifying this recipe to make garlic gravy as I'm always looking for alternatives to meat based gravies for my vegetarian daughters.

Excellent! A little on the buttery side, but perfectly garlicky and spicy and extremely quick.

I made this last night and served it as an amuse bouche in beautiful hand-etched grappa glasses from Italy, it was a delicious way to start a dinner party! Next time I make this, I will add less flour to make it more of a clear liquid soup.

I love garlic and have made this soup several times. Easy to make and very satisfying. Cayenne gives it a kick but you can control how much kick by how much cayenne is added. A terrific recipe for the garlic lover.
