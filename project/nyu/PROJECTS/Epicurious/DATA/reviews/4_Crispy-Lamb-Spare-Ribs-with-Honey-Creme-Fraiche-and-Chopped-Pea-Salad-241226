Many people assume that if you are using a frozen ingredient, it should be thawed first. Perhaps it would have been clearer to have simply said, "keep frozen" or "do not thaw."

it is pretty clear to me that unthawed means frozen.

Although I disregarded most of the recipe because I used a butterflied leg marinated w/rosemary, mint and garlic, the creme friache is a homerune and the key. Make at least 2 hours ahead. Served minted peas, so I at the very last minute chose not to go with the vinegar based pea "salad". I charred/seared the meat on the grill and finished it in the oven. Not sure a full half cup of honey is needed and make sure you do the toasted thing with the spices.

Sorry but I had to have some fun with this. "2 cups frozen peas (from one 10-ounce package), unthawed" Now if I have something frozen and I thaw it that means that I raise the temperature of the frozen item. So if I "unthaw" something does that mean that do the opposite of raising its temperature? So what do you think? Should I take the peas from their frozen 5 below to say 20-25 below?
