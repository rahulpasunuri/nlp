I always get great compliments on this recipe. The key to making the custard a success is to use large and not extra large eggs.

Rating: 4
Sigh - heavenly For a fun twist make your own ladyfinger batter and spread it over the bottom and sides of a prepared deep springform pan plus one flat layer pan. Bake sponge, then layer with custard (chuck an extra egg yolk or two in to thicken it and use less water in the coffee liquid) chill thoroughly (at LEAST 5 hours) and un-mould just before serving, top generously with chocolate curls for a free standing tiramisu. Guaranteed to impress!

If there were a "no fork" rating, this recipe would get it. The custard didn't set, 5 tablespoons of brandy was too "boozy". It made no sense to make a hot sugar syrup then add chilled cream to it, not to mention I had tons of coffee liquid left over. The taste over alll was okay, but the method and measurments were way off.

I made this for my supperclub and it was a big hit! I found it too sweet on my trial run, so reduced the 1 cup sugar in the espresso mixture to a generous 1/2 cup and liked it much better. Garnished cut squares and plate with bittersweet chocolate curls.

This recipe was a big hit despite several goofs on my part. I forgot the brandy and realized this after I put it together, so I drizzled kahlua over the top before I put the cocoa mixture on. Not the same...I know. Also, upon the suggestion of another reviewer, I only used 1 lb. marscapone and wish I would have used the FULL amount - custard was a touch skimpy. I soaked the first layer of ladyfingers (crisp Alessi brand) a touch too long (about 8 seconds) and the top layer not long enough (about 4 seconds). It turned out fine b/c the texture was great once it was put together, but next time I would go w/ around 6 seconds. Also, I just cooked the custard until it was thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and hold a line, then I simply pushed through a sieve over the bowl of marscapone and beat together w/ a hand mixer. Worked great. Topped w/ white and dark chocolate curls and garnsihed w/ mint. Beautiful! Oh...one more thing...agree that the cocoa topping could be cut in half. BUT - unlike other reviewers - I found that I used ALL of the espresso mixture.

This a solid 4 forks! I used kahlua instead of brandy and served in my trifel bowl, picket fence style. It took a few more lady fingers this way. I used up a whole 17.1 oz package. I was a little nervous about the custard but it turned out great. This has a real wow factor especially in the trifel bowl. Its almost too pretty to eat. One review said to use cream cheese instead of the marscapone but honestly whats the point, go make a cheese cake if you want cream cheese.

I know this is sacrilege, but I made this without espresso or coffee of any kind (I loathe it). I substituted an equal amount of unsweeted Dutch cocoa powder instead, and no one had any idea the coffee flavor was missing. Seven people at my dinner party said it was the best tiramisu they'd ever had!

I am a novice at the art of making desserts. It was my first attempt at making Tiramisu. I made this for my husband on Valentine's and he absolutely loved it. I used Kahlua as suggested by one of the reviewers (we are coffee lovers) and made notes from everyone's review. It was a hit. I knew I was eating one of the best tiramisu and I had actually made it :) Thanks a LOT to all for giving great pointers.

This is my second review of this recipe - second time turned out even better (my first time it was a bit sloppy as I had left the custard for a while before adding the mascarpone)!! For those finding mascarpone too expensive - make your own! Really easy and so cheap (just use regular cream!). There is a recipe for Homemade Mascarpone under "Member Recipes" on this site that I've used with success. Once again my guests raved about how impressive the tiramisu was and asked for the recipe. Some visited the next day to eat the leftovers!

I chose this tiramisu recipe because i'm pregnant and unlike other recipes, in this one, the eggs are "cooked". And this is the BEST tiramisu i've ever made and had, even thought i made a few changes:put more brandy(6-7 tbs),less mascarpone (1 pound)and all the sugar in the custard, and used real expresso coffee, no whipping cream,no sugar, but 2-3 tbs Bailey's in the dipping sauce to have a stronger coffee side, in contrast with the sweeter custard. Yum!!!!! You have to try it if you're a tiralisu fan!!

Ooops! Forgot two tips: ++++ If using real espresso, dissolve sugar in HOT espresso BEFORE cooling it, else you'd have to reheat the espresso just to dissolve the sugar and THEN cool it again. ++++ To chill the espresso quickly, put some ice & water in a heavy 6-qt pot to chill it then dump out the ice+water, and put in the hot espresso. Alternatively, if you're not in a hurry, put the pot in the freezer to chill it.

I made this for a poker night this past weekend. Here are my observations: ++++ I used a metal bowl. I was paranoid about salmonella so I wanted to steam the eggs for a bit longer than the recommended 10 minutes, but I also don't want the mixture to get too hot and cook the eggs too far. Using a metal bowl, it's easier to control the temperature since it reacts quicker to heat changes. I pulled it off the saucepan when the mixture gets too hot. (BTW, it only took about five minutes for the cold egg mixture to reach 160'.) ++++ The issues with curdling makes me wonder if people use enough water that it touches the bowl? The bowl should only be heated by the steam from the water, not the water itself. Also, you need to whisk the mixture CONSTANTLY; leaving it for as little as ten seconds would cook the eggs enough to make it curdle. ++++ I used *REAL* expresso (ooh! aah!). I believe that since there is so much espresso in the recipe, more than just adding a little flavor and enough to be a major ingredient, real espresso would make a BIG difference. I used to use Medaglia D'Oro instant espresso when a recipe calls for espresso, but no longer do, since it does not even come close to The Real Thing. ++++ This tiramisu is less cake-like because of the custard. I would definitely make it in a trifle bowl the next time, or cut down on the espresso and/or the custard. ++++ Next time, I'd try using all cream cheese instead of 1 lbs mascarpone and 8 ozs cream cheese as this time: mascarpone is expensive, and there is enough other strong textures and flavors that real mascarpone would probably not add a lot in flavor or texture.

This is a fantastic recipe! The two substitutions I had to make were using the fresh (soft) lady fingers as I can't get the dry ones here in SD. I found they worked just fine, the texture and consistency was more like a bread pudding but it still tasted great! Also, can't get marscapone so I used cream cheese instead. My brother, a chef, said its the best tiramisu he's ever had!

Made this for a graduation party, and it got very good reviews. Unlike a previous reviewer, I found I did need the full amount of soaking liquid. I used strong coffee instead of espresso powder and water, and less sugar than it called for, to taste. However, I agree that not quite all the cocoa/sugar dusting mixture is needed. I used 1 pound mascarpone and 8 ounces neufchatel to lower the cost just a little. I didn't have a thermometer, but found that in ten minutes my custard had thickened nicely, so I took it off the heat. I used a ceramic bowl for heating it over the water, and whisked constantly for the ten minutes, and didn't have any problems with lumping.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! A few tips: definitely use a pyrex type bowl rather than metal for the custard; only half of the coffee mixture is necessary, ditto the cocoa topping. Re soggy ladyfingers -- I suspect some cooks are using the "fresh" type (found in bakery section of grocery store) -- be sure to use the dry ones, found in the cookie section.

What a fantastic recipe! I've made it twice. I made it once in a 9x13 pan and just this weekend I made it in two 9-inch pie plates for two separate occasions. Taking a cue from Emily Luchetti, I added the brandy to the eggs and sugar when bringing the eggs up to temperature. This is an assertive, yet elegant dessert.

Absolutely 4 forks, maybe even 5. I used Kahlua and 2/3 mascarpone cheese and 1/3 light cream cheese. Recipe easy to follow. Custard cooked in 7 minutes, whisking constantly. I liked the fact that the eggs used in the recipe were cooked and not raw, as some tiramisu recipes are. I made this for a dinner party at an authentic Italian couple's home and they thought it was fantastic. This was the ultimate compliment. They were born and raised in Italy, in fact they are so Italian, they make their own prosciutto. We tasted some they made that was over 3 years old. It sounds like a lot of work but what a great taste! I am going to try the tiramisu again at Christmas but will leave out the alcohol and make it only with coffee and expresso. I will report back again how this works.

Spectacular - the best recipe I've ever made for Tiramisu - I used Marsala instead of Brandy - basically like a Zablione - it was de-licous. No problem with the custard.

Rating: 3
Have made it twice and my office loves it. I changed the type of brandy that I used from the first time and it made a big difference in how it tasted, a smooth tasting more expensive brand is best. I noticed a strong front end taste of alcohol the first time I made it with a less expensive brandy. I also added chocolate sauce to the layering and it adds to it. On the custard, I did notice that it should get to an almost clumpy stage before adding the cheese. I used a hand mixer when combining the custard and cheese, which made it smoother/creamier. I'm still tweaking it and hope to have it perfected soon, not that it was bad to begin with.

I top with freshly whipped cream, shaved bittersweet chocolate, and fresh strawberries. Great make-ahead dessert!

Made the custard a couple of hours ahead of adding the mascarpone ... not sure if this contributed to the reason mine was a bit sloppy. Custard bit was easy (keep scraping the sides, as the egg cooks there first and will get lumps if you don't keep at it). I added 9 tblspn brandy ... yum! Only needed a 1/4 of the coffee dipping mix. Got lots of compliments and I'm sorry I left the leftovers at a friend's, as I'd love to have had it for a 2nd day!! Definitely nicer than tiramisu I've had in restuarants (even good italian ones!)!

I have made this twice. Once for my neighbors over Christmas, and again for the heck of it. The first time I made it, I had the "too runny" problem and a little gelatain saved the day. The second time it came out perfect without the gelatain. The main difference was in the custard preparation. The first time I made it, I whisked constantly until my digital thermometer read 160. What I failed to realize was that I had hit a hot spot, and I was overly concerned with my custard curdling, so I stopped the heating process and went for the ice bowl. Guys, don't worry about the curdle. If you keep your steam at a reasonable heat, and you ensure you whisk the eggs CONSTANTLY, they will not. My hot spots on my digital thermometer ranged up to 170, and the eggs never curdled. I kept the eggs over the heat until they thickened and I think that is what made the custard come out. I'm glad I took that risk. Also, I did not top my tiramisu with the reccomended topping. I instead, melted some semi-sweet pieces, baker's chocolate, and Dove ice-cream topping together. Then I added a little cream so it wouldn't harden when refrigerated and a few tablespoons of freshly ground espresso. I drizzled the chocolate over the first layer and the top as well. Try it, you will love it! It makes for a georgeous presentation, as well.

I thought this was a fairly easy recipe although I was a bit nervouse as I was making it. My marscapone cheese was runny so the "folding in" didn't make sense to me and I haven't cooked with marscapone previously. It turned out great! I took it to an Italian theme dinner and it was a hit. I will definately make it again! I followed the recipe as is.

Although I tried to be super careful using low heat, I had trouble with the custard curdling as others did. I ended up straining it before adding to the marscapone. I agree with another reviewer that the amount of coffee mixture needed for the lady fingers and the amount of the cocoa mixture to sprinkle on top should be cut way back. Most everyone loved the dessert, but thought I should have soaked the lady fingers a bit more.

I made this for a party after Thanksgiving but haven't had the chance to give my review. This was wonderful! I did put a bit more brandy in the custard which was perfect and had no problem with soggy cookies for the dessert.

This tiramisu is truly awesome--better than any I've had in restaurants!! I agree that the brandy could be increased and that it's even better the second day. One more thing--if you try and get the custard to 160 degrees, it will curdle. I think that's a mistake in the recipe. I remedied the problem by bringing the water to a simmer and then turning off the heat Also I did not keep it over the heat for a full 10 min., probably only 7 or 8. If you see any hint of curdling, take it off right away--it is done!

This is an excellent recipe. I was a little nervous after reading other posts about the sogginess of the lady fingers, but I purchased a good quailty cookie from an Italian deli (as well as imported mascarpone chese), put the cookies in the syrup & rolled them over once. The texture was perfect. I served it to a group of tiramisu aficionados & all agreed it was the best they have tasted.

This is an aboslute favorite of ours. Definitely 5 forks! I've had tiramisu many places, but this one is just the best. Two things I've found in making it...1) Use a glass bowl instead of a metal one to keep the yolks from forming the "little glops" the Seattle cook talked about; and 2) I use rum instead of brandy. The rum and chocolate flavors are beautiful together.

I have made this great dessert previously from my copy of Bon Appetit. Lost (or gave away) the magazine, and now, in desperation, turned to the internet. This dessert is great to take to big family style special dinners...and I am making it for Easter dinner. It is easy, fail-proof, and always popular with everyone. It is so good that no one even questions the caloric content! If you had 5 forks, I would give it that!

This was delicious. I used crispy ladyfingers (Savioardi) and soaked each 4-5 secs. and they came out just right, not too soggy, not too dry. I made a half recipe but with a full 5 tbsp Kahlua. I accidentally used 3/4 c. mascarpone instead of 3/4 lb., and it still came out delicious. Though I've had Tiramisu lots of times, I couldn't remember what the consistency of the custard is supposed to be like; while ours might have been considered a little runny (about like yoghurt) I think the full amount of mascarpone would have been way too cheesy for my taste.

Rating: 1
I found the recipe extremely frustrating. I guess I am the only one who had trouble with the eggs curdling...obviously too high heat as my printout cut off the "simmering". The second time I whisked and whisked and whisked the eggs with the sugar and it took more than 30 min. for the egg mixture to reach 160 degrees and even then the mixture wasnt custardy but eggy. I just can't bear to try it again so I am turning to another recipe...

Halving the recipe makes a perfect 8 inch square. The first time I made it, I forgot to half the brandy. Second time i made it I did half the brandy. I preferred the first one. Also substiuted chocolate sprinkles and blobs of whipped creem for the topping. This made it a little richer and not so sweet.

I never thought making tiramisu would be this easy. I omitted the brandy since there were children at the party, but followed the directions otherwise.

Many people asked me for the recipe. Definitely a keeper.

Yummy! Was definitely better on day two. Really enjoyed the custard although didn't have a thermometer and had to rely on time (10 min) and it's consistency.

I have made this recipe numerous times and every time its a hit. I use Kahlua instead of brandy, and also buy the soft ladyfingers instead of the crisp ones. This allows them to soak up more of the espresso mixture. Personally, I havent had a better tira misu...even in a restaurant!

This was fabulous and went over great at a Tuscan themed party. I used really crisp ladyfingers and made it the day ahead and the texture was exactly was I wanted. Moist but not soggy. The only tough part was trying to get the eggs to 160 without cooking them. I had a little bit of curd in the custard after I removed it from the heat so I just strained it before I put it in the marscapone.

I think the custard portion of this taste was really delicious. The toss up with everyone seems to be how long to dip the ladyfingers for. I did mine for about 5 seconds and it was not long enough and made it a bit dry inside. I think it all depends on what type of ladyfingers you buy. My question is when I whisk the custard to reach 160 degree, it took me at least 30 min in low heat. Does everyone use higher heat & is that okay?

This recipe is delicious and fairly easy to make. I made it for a birthday party, and everyone loved it. I would definitely make it again. If you make it, soak the lady fingers for 2 seconds only-not 5 seconds like the recipe says. 5 seconds is too long, and the cookies will be too soggy. Also, the recipe says to fold the custard into the mascarpone mixture. I had to whip the custard into the mascarpone mixture. The texture wasn't right when simply folding. This dessert is delicious and a definite standout.

This was a wonderful recipe the texture and flavors were perfect.You need to pay special attention when making the custart to keep the tempature at 160 if not the custard looses it creamy texture. I would definately make this recipe again. Mascarpone cheese is expensive so you want the recipe to be perfect.

I like the basic recipe, but found it very sweet. I did use the spray bottle technique, and found that worked great for not over sopping the ladyfingers. I used Kalua instead of espresso and sugar. I whipped the cream to hard peaks and folded it into the egg/mascarpone mix. That seemed to work best for me.

This was one of the best recipies I've made for Tiramisu. It was easy and fast aside from being so delicious. My guests said it was one of my better ones. I found that making it ina metal tray as opposed to glass or corning ware made a HUGE difference. I put it in the freezer for 20-30 minutes and then the fridge. It was ready much faster and set perfectly!!

After two tries, I finally got the custard just right. When dousing the lady fingers, I rolled them over and over to the count of "one thousand one (one roll), one thousand and two (second roll), up to 5 rolls and 5 seconds. That seemed to solve the oversaturated problem people were having. My husband said it was the best dessert I've made, and in 20 years of dinner parties and dessets, that was certainly a compliment. Too bad mascarpone cheese costs sooooo much!

I get raves for this one using Pepperidge Farm Milano cookies instead of ladyfingers. They also solve the soaking problem; good cohesion. I brew some strong espresso and sweeten it with Kahlua, soak the cookies well, and use good anejo rum in the custard -- but then, Italian food ain't for sissies.

I messed up on the ladyfingers, BIGTIME!! This is an excellent recipe but the instuctions on the ladyfingers are a little vague (sp?). Mostly the problem with this recipe is human error not the ingrediants because everything else was a wonderful combination & lacy-smooth delight! I asked for some advice & basically you should brush the ladyfingers with the coffee rather than dipping & very little rum to taste or it will overwhelm. Remembering that ladyfingers have a very soft & elegant taste, you must be careful as to how strong the coffee & how much liquor taste you want. All other advice on using the gelatin & whisking in a double broiler was excellent advice!! Thank you & goodluck to the rest!!!

Unfortunately, my tirmaisu turned out so soggy that its texture was VERY unpleasant. Apparently I had the lady fingers dipped too long (about 6 seconds after reading the previous review). Another problem was that the mascarpone didn't mix well with the brandy custard. It looked and felt very crumbly. It may be better to let the cheese reach the room temperature before trying to fold in the custard.

I made this as my contribution to a neighborhood dinner party - one day in advance thankfully. PROBELM: the CRISP lady fingers did not absorb enough of the espresso liqour in "5 seconds" so never got fully saturated = dry tiramisu. I made the dish for 8 for the party, and made a small dish for 4 in another which I tried, that's when I made the discovery. The flavor was wonderful but any tips on brand and type of lady finger work, or did I need to dip longer? I used Bellino Savoiardi.

This Tiramisu was fabulous. The custard was the perfect texture of spun satin but very light with just a kick from the brandy. The preparation was suprisingly easy, and unlike other tiramisus this one does not spread out as you serve. I will be making this one again and again.
