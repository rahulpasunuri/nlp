I made this for my husband and i so didn't bother cutting out the middle of the bread. That would be a nice touch for company. Basically a simple recipe with a nice flavor. The sour cream really does change the outcome from normal. I increased the eggs to 2/pp and used light multigrain so served the scrambled eggs over 2 pieces of toast.

Are you kidding me?! This is hardly of Epicurious "recipe of the day" status if a 10-year-old creates this sort of thing on a regular basis without divine guidance. Hard to do anything but "like, not love," basic breakfast borsch.

Almost tried this without the sour cream but remembered what Chef kept telling us in culinary school - "Always make a new recipe exactly the way it is written the first time, then make changes if needed". That being said, it turns out the sour cream was really good with the eggs.
