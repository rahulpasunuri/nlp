Very tasty this, and I only used tinned lump meat and Hellman's. Almost made my own mayo, but then I saw the jar in the fridge and went for easy. Fresh meat would yield a less liquid crab/sauce, and a better presentation.

On finding this recipe reprinted in a local newspaper I thought I would check Epicurious to see if there were any comments. I was concerned to see the ambivalent (to say the least) response to this one but since I had already bought the ingredients I thought I would go ahead with caution and adjust seasoning if necessary. Things went from bad to worse when I discovered that I only had Fat Free mayo in the fridge (Ok for sandwiches but thats all). Maybe it was fate, but I whipped up a batch of homemade (using the "Joy of Cooking" main recipe) and it apparently made all the difference. The recipe was delicious! The crab perfectly accompanied by the bread (I used Challah). I recommend this recipe to you but stipulate that you should use only the best ingredients, that is, fresh crab and homemade mayo (try it, its really not that hard!)

The key to this recipe is to have fresh ,sweet crabmeat, preferably from the Chesapeake Bay, but it must not be frozen or canned. Don't bother making this without it. It will be tasteless and a tuna melt would be nicer!

The recipe sounded incredibly good when I read it but the taste was so disappointing that I scraped the crab meat from bread and saved for making crab cakes.

The second time, we placed baby romaine on top of the toast, thinly sliced tomato on the crab, then sprinkled parrmesan before broiling. Magnifico.

Very good, but many difficult to prepare it.

I don't think that a glorified tuna melt does justice to lump crabmeat. However, the flavor was nice.

It's only 4:00 a.m., but just from reading the description I want to make it now . . . . as the recipe reads, it soulds easy to follow. With quality ingredients and gentle care in preparation, I can hardly wait to try it.
