I made this tonight for a small group and everyone loved it. I used half the amount of bread and definitely wouldn't want any more. The Chamomile cream is incredibly delicious. I made that a day ahead and took the advice to set up the ramekins ahead of time.

Fantastic. I've made this for a restaurant as well as private customers and it's a great hit. I agree that it can be too bready so I reduce the amount of bread in the custard by half and it turns out very well. I do set the expectation that it's more bread pudding than charlotte. I also make my own brioche - over the top but I have it so I use it.

The flavors were great, but the dessert was too bready & not as custardy as I expected. Careful with the creme--cook just a minute too long and you end up with curdy chamomile pudding.

I made this two or three time so far. Each time it has been described as amazing! I recommend cutting the bread and lining the ramekins first .This allows a more leisurely pace for the rest of the steps. Make sure the pears are juicy, if not add a little water. I am not that experienced, and it takes me about three hours to make. It's worth every minute

A delicate dessert, not overly sweet or heavy. Great ending to a heavy meal.

I made this for some friends with whom I cook with, and we were all very pleased with the outcome. It's a bit cumbersome, but very well worth it. It's a good idea to prepare it a day ahead and then simply reheat the ramkins just before youserve it.

I attended a cooking class with Chef Payard and when he made it, it tasted amazing. This recipe is adapted to make it availble to home cooks. Chef Payard used a bunch of fresh chamomile and gourmet half and half. Overall,this recipe will WOW your guests.
