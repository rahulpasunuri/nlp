I made this tonight. I took the breast out of the skillet when my thermometer registered 135. The breast was very, very well done and tough. Was your temp right or my thermometer wrong?

I've made this twice now. Both times I've ended up with skin more blackened than I had intended. The sauce made with the drippings was fine nonetheless, not tasting burnt. The sauce really is great and makes the recipe.

The marinade was terrific and recipe worked out well except skin started to burn in saute pan, so I stuck breasts in oven for a bit to finish cooking. Yum!

oh wow. this is fabulous. Served it to a demanding crowd and everyone raved. Now I am fighting with my son over the leftovers (it is even better today). Used escarole instead of chicory - should have used 2 heads. Still delicious.

A great recipe to adapt for summer by grilling the duck breasts. I had escarole on hand, and used it in place of chicory.

I used a half leftover duck in this recipe for two. I sliced breast and other meat and heated in a toaster oven. Braised the chicory, deglazed the pan with the marinade and poured over duck on chicory bed. It was delicious.
