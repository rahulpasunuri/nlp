we loved this - bright, clean late summer flavors! i halved the recipe for the two of us with success and leftovers for lunch too. i didn't find it time-consuming considering normal meal prep time. and then the torte does it's own thing in the fridge. would be a great dish for a party as it can be prepared up to 2 days before. save all the lovely juices that accumulate due to the weighting! i'm going to add mine to stock for soup today.

beautiful. slightly time-consuming but I had lots of peppers from the garden to use. added the goatcheese [per A Cook] which gave it a needed oomph. people thought it looked impressive, which is more than half the battle. everyone has seen roasted/sauteed veges.

was also quite excited to try this. mine looked almost as good as the photo, but didn't manage enough layers. the flavors not as good as anticipated. used the leftovers - and plenty of them - for a soup.

spectacular dish; take the time to let it sit, weighted, in the fridge. Try some goat cheese along with the parmesian. Best when the squash is sweet.

Man. Was very excited about this one, mostly for the photography, but it turned out to be less than the sum of its parts. Nobody had seconds, and I don't know about the leftovers...I will probably chop them up for quesadillas or pasta salad. Don't expect this to be any more than a pile of room temp veggies.

This was good but time consuming to make. Followed the recipe exactly in terms of weighing veges and thickness of slices and couldn't come up with enough layers. Still, it was lovely and impressive for my dinner party. Tasted good enough too. Not great or interesting though.
