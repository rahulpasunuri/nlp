My husband made this a couple of days ago. It all went well until we put the roasted duck under the broiler. Because the duck is very dark from the marinade, it was very difficult to tell if you were crisping the skin, or burning it. I watched it like a hawk but after about 3 minutes under the broiler some of the skin burned. Use an instant read thermometer to determine when the duck is done-- again the color of the marinaded duck makes it difficult to tell. My husband made the sauce but wasn't happy about using a marinade that raw poultry had been in for about 4 hours. After making, he tasted and threw it away. The duck itself was good, it you didn't get any of the burnt skin!The flavour of the marinade was very nice. Next time, no broiler, and no sauce.

This recipe was a hit! I made this for Christmas Dinner. I made a 6.6 lb duck. It marinaded for two nights in my fridge. I cooked mine at 450 for 30 minutes just for roasting and then lowered the temp to 375 and cooked for 1 hr and 15 minutes more. No more no less. It was perfectly cooked. And no I didn't toss the remaining marinade. I used the portion recommended for basting and the rest for the gravy. Delish! My family and guests loved it!!

The marinate here is good, although quite salty once condensed, if I make it again I would probably half the amount of soy sauce or use a low sodium soy sauce. Notes on the cooking of the duck - I used a 5 lb duck - so I followed more the cooking advice of "A Cook from Washington DC"- which came out fairly well - but a little overcooked. Two things I would change, 1. There is no need to tent the duck (I did, and the skin did not crisp as I like) - the meat is so fatty, it won't dry out. 2. Perhaps this is because I used a 5 lb. duck instead of a 6 lb. which he used, but the cooking time suggested by "A Cook from Washington DC" was too long by about an hour. Although my duck came out ok, because it is such a fatty animal, It was way more done than I like. A 5 lb. duck probably needs a total of 3 to 3.5 hours to cook - 10 min at 500 to give it some brown color, 2.5-3 hrs. at 300 (until it reaches 150 degrees) and 15-20 min at 400 to finish, crisp, and bring it to 160 degrees. It will also cook a little more when you take it out to rest, so be careful with the temperature, err on the side of undercooking if you like a nice medium duck. Oh, one other note. I left the duck in the marinate overnight and it was delicious!

I have a tough time rating this, because I used a larger duck (6 pounds) and as a result was completely off script. I think the marinade probably is really good although I couldn't tell because I didn't understand what the recipe was saying to do with the remaining marinade. At one point, it says "pour 3/4 cup marinade through a sieve into a 1-quart saucepan and discard remainder". So do you really discard the remainder? If so, what are you doing later on when you are adding marinade -- surely not taking from the pan, which is now filled with fat? Perhaps I was a little thick, and whole duck is always tough to do (I am told) but I think I'm going to stick with those really easy breasts from the local store...

This was an excellent recipe. My husband raved all thru dinner. I did marinade the duck for 3 hours in the refridgerator. The only real change I made was to add 1tsp of sambal to the marinade as I did not have sichuan peppercorns. Since Sambal is spicy hot, I deleted the red pepper flakes. I also had a 3.5 lb duck so I roasted it for 1 hour. It turned out fantastic. I will definitely make this recipe again as it was wonderful.

I followed the recipe entirely - so easy - my first whole duck and it came out absolutely delicious, I wouldn't change one single thing about the recipe!

Nice marinade, but I suggest a different cooking style, using a 6 lb. Pekin duck: ï»¿Pre-heat oven to 500 deg., and put marinated duck on roaster rack in 9 x 13 inch glass dish (or roaster pan). Baste duck once as you put it in the oven. After cooking for 10 minutes at 500, reduce heat to 300 degrees. After 1 hour, tent duck with foil. Continue roasting at 300 degrees for 3.5 more hours, removing foil and raising temperature to 400 degrees for last 15 minutes. Guests will demand more!
