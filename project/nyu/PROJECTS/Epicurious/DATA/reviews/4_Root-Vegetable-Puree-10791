This is a dear friend's family's absolute top recipe for Thanksgiving, and they are big fans of Thanksgiving!

I have made this recipe several times as a base for Red Snapper with Soy Glaze on Sauteed Vegetables...substituting for the sweet potatoes of the original recipe. The root vegetables in this combination are magical. A travel writer friend has called it the best fish dish they have tasted in Florida!
