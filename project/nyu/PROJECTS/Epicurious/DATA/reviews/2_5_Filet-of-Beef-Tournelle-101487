I can certainly imagine that the potato would fall apart using the ingredients and methods listed in the recipe; rather, I would use egg whites (yolks don't coagulate, and thus have no structural integrity) and would pan sear them, rather than deep fry.

This is delicous and my my whole family agrees. I used mashed potatoes instead of making my own special potatoe cakes because I was running short on time. All I did was make the mashed potatoes a little bit drier than usual, so they would hold their shape. I then breaded them etc. They were delicious, and the meat and sauce were so flavorful and absolutly loved by my dinner guests.

The potato part of this recipe was terrible. A lot of work to rice the potatoes and though I chilled the resulting cakes, they fell apart during the cooking process and were a MESS!!! The sauce was also very tasteless and I felt I wasted $60 worth of truffle on this. The only good part was the excellent meat I used and the great Burgundy wine I served. Deep six this recipe!!
