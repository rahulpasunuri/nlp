Yuck. This recipe was a total fail. Like other reviewers, my caramel was so bitter the dish was inedible and went straight into the garbage. I'm not sure why as I watched it very closely, though it seemed to turn brown instantly. Even if the caramel had worked, the tart was very thin and flat. I'd much rather try a layered dessert or a pie.

This is very easy to make and absolutely delicious, I made it in a cast iron skillet all the way and was beautiful!

I used a regular cake pan. I buttered it once and then put it into the frig to harden then I buttered it again and it worked wonderful! I used nectarines instead of peaches. It worked fine. The boiling of the sugar solution takes time, so boil the hell out of it. But take it off the burner early as it continues to cook off the heat too! This received many positive comments.

Use brown sugar instead of regular sugar to make a lovely, delectable caramel that does not at all turn bitter. This recipe is also great with pears as well. It's a simple recipe that turns out looking professional. The resulting tarte makes an impressive potluck offering and an excellent dessert for impromptu dinner parties.

So easy and delicous... It's become a cottage favourite. Caramel becomes bitter if burned, just watch carefully !

This is the worst dessert I ever tried - the previous reviewer was right - sort of bitter -

I usually have no problem making caramel, but this tasted so bitter that it ruined the recipe. I do not know how that is possible - you'd think "bitter caramel" to be an oxymoron. dunno if I overcooked it or if it was the lemon juice. I thought perhaps it was just bitter until cooked with the peaches, but I did so, and the peach/caramel mixture was so bad I threw it out.
