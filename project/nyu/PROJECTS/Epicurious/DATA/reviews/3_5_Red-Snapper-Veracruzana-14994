I made the sauce earlier, so the favors could blend Then reheated it before spreading in on the bottom of a baking dish, placing snapper fillets on top and putting in a 350 oven for a few minutes to cook. Great do ahead dish, enjoyed by all!

This was tasty, easy and healthy. I have made it with both snapper and tilapia, both were good. This would probably be nice with any white fish. It's a good weeknight dish.

I am vegetarian, but made this for my family. They loved it. I have little nephews and they loved it too.

I made this with 2 - 14oz cans diced tomatoes, sea bass, double the fresh oregano, and half green & half kalamata olives, and served it over quinoa. Very tasty, but you do need to let this cool and sit for a while so the flavors blend well. I just covered the sauce, left it in the pot, marinated the bass in the lime juice, and then went to the gym for my workout. When I returned, I started the quinoa, pushed the sauce aside, put the bass in the pan then spooned it over the fish. Simmered it on med- low with the lid on for 10 minutes, and voila! Dinner! Yum. Even the "I only eat fish because it's good for me" person liked it. Will definitely make this again. Keep the jalapeno seeds in if you want it spicy, otherwise it's probably a waste of time worrying about fresh jalapeno.. you might as well use dried chile flakes.

This was a big disappointment. The recipe looked good on paper (although with the tiny print of the new "improved" site, it's hard to tell.) In any case, despite all the tasty-sounding ingredients, the sauce tasted flat. I tried to rescue it with some salt, but failed to make it worth eating.

After reading the reviews about whether there was enough sauce to cook the fish, we added about 1/4-cup chicken broth to the sauce before cooking the snapper. We also used a little more cinnamon than the recipe called for and used a whole jalepeno. Served this with green salad and a rice pilaf made w/ brown rice, mushrooms, celery, garlic, and onions -- very quick and easy and felt quite elegant for the minimal amount of work and time involved. Our whole family loved the recipe, and we will make it again, and again, and again . . .

I've been to Veracruz, Mexico, and tasted this dish, so I was excited to make this recipe, but this fell far short of the real thing. Made it twice, quadrupled the amount of serrano peppers, and substituted black olives instead of green. Still not right.

Tasty combination of flavors; the sauces could be used well with chicken I believe. Will make again sometime.

Interesting how just that touch of cinnamon makes all the difference in the recipe. I did notice a few similiar recipes on site without the cinnamon. The one ingredient substitution that I did make was to use pickled serrano peppers. Glad that I only used 1.5 because the spiciness was right on and I'm no whimp. The tomatoes that I used apparently weren't juicy enough but I remedied that by covering the pan after adding the fish therefore creating more liquid. I don't feel that it diluted the sauce at all. We don't care for leftover fish but I imagine that the reason why it states to refrigerate the sauce is to allow time for the flavors to marry. Good idea to make the sauce the day before if possible. I would consider serving this for a casual dinner party. It certainly presented nicely with a side of rice pilaf flavored with a fresh basil pesto made from my garden.

This was a great recipe, and so easy to make for guests! I made it exactly as written, except that I only used 1/2 jalepeno. The dish could have used more heat, but in this case it was fine since my guests don't care for very spicy foods. It was very well received, and I will definitely be making this again!

Not a bad recipe. The next time I make this dish I will use black olives.

The overwelming tastes of this dish are different. It is still a very nice recipe, but not exellent.

Served this at the restaurant I work in, lovely taste and nice spice, customers enjoyed it!

I used tilapia and the sauce was wonderful. I used tomato sauce rather than tomatoes per another reviewer's suggestion. My daughter and I would like it over potatoes, but the really big eaters prefer rice. Next time, I'll make some potatoes, too.

Yummy Dish. We used 1/2 the fish and doubled the spices. The recommendation for potatoes was right on. The new red potatoes was just the trick.

This isn't something I would make for a dinner party but as an easy, healthy, inexpensive dish for an ordinary Wednesday, it's fab. I like it because, while I'm sure it's optimized with fresh ingredients, it can also be made with canned chiles and olives, dried herbs and frozen fish. Lovely served over rice and with fresh fruit slices.

OK, I used Halibut, and Thai bird peppers (unseeded) . I served over a small, fluffy mound of yukons whipped with garlic, butter and parmesean. Easy, fast and tasty, it also filled the house with an amazing smell. This is a mighty fine recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Normally I find fish recipes boring but this one was very good. The pepper added some interest as well as the capers and olives.With the cinnamon chimng in with an interesting note. I' do this again.

Tasty, easy and healthy all in one. There was no red snapper at the market so substituted tilapia with great results. ?? refrig. the sauce. I just marinated the fish in the lime juice before I started the sauce, made the sauce in a large skillet, pushed the sauce aside so I could put the fish underneath. One pan to wash! I used Spanish olives stuffed with hot peppers to kick the heat level up a bit and will add a few more next time we make this dish.

Okay, here I am substituting ingredients again. I had canned chipotle peppers, so I used one of those, with a little of the sauce to give the sauce an extra kick. So many of you seemed to think something else was needed. I also just let the sauce cool a little and did not refrigerate. I placed the sauce over the chiceken, covered with a lid and turned the burner off while I fixed a salad and emptied the dishwasher. Ummmmmmmmmmm good! This is a keeper. Quick and easy.

Excellent. I would make this again in a heartbeat. I did not have fresh jalepeno peppers, so I used puree jalepeno and lots of it.

One of my husband's favorites. We eat a lot of fish and this sauce works with many varieties. I used habaneros for more kick and tomato sauce for richness.

Delicious. Just thought I would mention the following. At least 30 years ago, I was visiting a friend in Pennsylvania. She made a few wonderful dishes and then showed me a Spiral Edition of Marian Fox Burros and Lois Levines Cookbook. The Elegant but Easy Cookbook. I purchased the pocketbook edition in 1968 published by Collier-Macmillan. It has been a "bible" of cooking in this home. Wish I could find a new copy as this one is faded, torn, stained etc! If anyone has it...try their Orange-Nut Cake with Orange Sauce.....yummy!

This is indeed an elegant and easy recipe. I used cod and my wife who doesn't like fish thought it was very good !

An excellent dish with a nice mix of flavors. I used halibut steaks instead of red snapper, and it came out just fine. The sauce seems adaptable to many types of fish. I agree with Mike below that it could stand a little more kick - I'll double the jalapenos next time or maybe use a hotter chile.

Very tasty and easy! I used sea bass and olives stuffed with garlic & jalapenos.

Terrific dish! Nice blend of flavors, and it was super easy to prepare. However, I must have used a weak jalapeno as my dish lacked any trace of heat. Next time I'll use two! Enjoy

this is a simple to prepare, and very flavorful dish, that was thoroughly enjoyed by my dinner guests. even a beginner can handle this one!
