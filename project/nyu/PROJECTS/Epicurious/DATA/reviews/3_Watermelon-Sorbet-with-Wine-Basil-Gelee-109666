I did not make the gelee, but the watermelon sorbet itself was easy and delicious. Great way to use the other half of the huge watermelon I got at the farm stand.

So not worth it. First, the texture was more of an icy granita than a sorbet, second, unless you have a super sweet watermelon, its not sweet enough, and third, the gelee, though interesting, was not worth the trouble, at all.

I am making my second batch of the sorbet, since the one I made yesterday is all gone already. I used lime instead of lemon and left out the zest. It is delicious and so easy!

I am making this sorbet for the second time right now. Haven't tried it yet with the gelee. I added more lemon zest (1 tablespoon) but otherwise didn't change the recipe. Delicious and refreshing.

Excellent combination of tastes. Gelee is wonderful and watermelon sorbet has subtle, refreshing taste. Ideal palate cleanser.

When it gets up to a 111 degrees. That is a perfect time for a sorbet

The consistency was very granular and hard - not an nice smooth sorbet. I think the pumped watery watermelon made for a bland sorbet - need to wait for local concentrated watermelons. Will look for other recipes for easy sorbets. As a quickie to go with the so-so watermelon - I pureed 2 cans of lychee fruit, 3 Tbsp lime juice and a few Tbs chopped candied ginger. Processed in ice cream maker. Much bigger hit than the watermelon.
