Delicious. I used cranberry-rasberry juice instead of cherry cider (easier to find at the grocery store). Served over plain nonfat yogurt it is a very light and refreshing dessert or a fancy breakfast accompaniment!

I really liked this cherry compote. It was really great. I used it to top a cheesecake. The two were just divine together. I used the frozen cherries, instead of the fresh. I also used cherry juice instead of cherry cider or that berry juice.

I didn't have enough fresh cherries, so I also used frozen blackberries and raspberries. I also didn't have vanilla bean or lemons, so I added about two tablespoons vanilla extract and one tablespoon lemon extract. The result was divine. I served it warm over warm cornbread, with a scoop of Haagen Dazs lemon sorbet. Superb!
