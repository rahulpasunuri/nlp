Very good overall. I've made Rajas con crema before but not over filet mignon. I really liked the combination. I served with rice and beans, but, it didn't really go with that. I substituted cilantro for the epazote, but, you should always use epazote if you can find it.

We loved this. I blended it before serving since my family doesn't like "chunks" in their sauces and it was fantastic! I served it over chicken.

One of my favorite recipes from the Mexico issue. I make it whenever I can get my hands on fresh poblanos. For the sauce, I have added some Mexican oregano and a little garlic.

Fantastic sauce...I used jalepenos, roasted, of course and the sauce was perfect! Just enough heat.

Fantastic new way to eat steak, mexican style. The spiciness definitely didn't detract from the flavor of the meat. This recipe was absolutely great. Wonderful for a summer dinner, especially with a mexican-themed flair. We would definitely recommend it and wouldn't change a thing...

This recipe was good...not great. The sauce was lacking spice/kick. I added a some cumin. That helped a little. Overall, I probably wouldn't make this one again.

Awesome! used larger steaks and sliced them to make steak and rajas tacos with homemade corn tortillas. Great dish! GO RAJAS!
