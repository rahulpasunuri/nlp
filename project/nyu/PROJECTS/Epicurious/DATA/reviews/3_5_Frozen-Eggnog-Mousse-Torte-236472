I made this in the 90s when it was originally in Bon Appetit. It is an extremely delicious dessert, and it has a definite WOW appeal in presentation. The only problem I had, was the chocolate disks and lace were very hard, and the mousse was very soft, and so when I tried to cut it, the chocolate wouldn't cut and the mousse "smushed" out the sides. I would make it again in a heartbeat, but not use the chocolate. Perhaps served in a parfait dish, or used in a trifle.
