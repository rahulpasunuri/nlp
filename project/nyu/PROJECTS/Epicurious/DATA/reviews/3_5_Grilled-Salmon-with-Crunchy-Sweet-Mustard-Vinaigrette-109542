I have made this countless times and it is always a hit with my family.....delicious!

I made the vinaigrette as described in the recipe, with only a slight reduction in olive oil, and like the other reviewers I found it to be a fantastic sauce for the grilled salmon. I loved the crunchiness of the shallot and can't imagine it working with raw garlic instead, but maybe that's worth trying. Served the fish with small red and white potatoes that had been par-boiled, quartered, and then grilled in a grill basket after being tossed with olive oil, salt/pepper, granulated garlic, and a sprinkling of oregano. I made a double batch of vinaigrette and tossed some raw broccoli and slivered almonds with a few tablespoons of it to make a delish cold salad.

I loved the vinaigrette it complimented the grilled salmon very well, did not overpower it! I served this with a light cucumber scallion salad and roasted sweet potatoes. Delish fresh and easy, sure to repeat this one during the grilling months.

This was amazing, even my fussy children ate it! So easy and so good. I will absolutely make again.

I have never used this on salmon, but I use it on salads all the time and can't get enough of it.

After reading some reviews (thanks), I decided to leave the olive oil for last, adding just enough to create the consistency right. It was wonderful! Definitely making it again. Save me the time of doing s marinade. I can make the vinaigrette while the salmon is on the grill.

A friend made this at a party a while ago and I was taken by the vinaigrette. Finally made it myself for a pot luck and it was a hit...even the kids ate it. I modified the recipe by smoking the salmon (245 F for 40 minutes with cherry wood chips in a smoker). I also doubled the amount of the vinaigrette but cut the olive oil in half. Good king salmon has plenty of oil...the fish was plenty moist. A very easy dish to make!

Loved this! In fact, everyone did. The only tweaks I would make to it would be to add a bit more mustard and vinegar - it didn't have enough "bite" to me, however, I will also be using the vinaigrette as a salad dressing in the future as well. Yummy! Will most definitely make again!

This was amazing and easy.

I thought this was just ok. I use almost the same vinaigrette recipe for my salads, so it just tasted like I put that on my fish. It is super fast, so that was good. I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

Solid recipe ... my wife went ga-ga for the vinaigrette! You can use it on anything and it's delicious. Substituted garlic per other's recco as didn't have shallots and still generated raves.

The sauce was pretty good.. we even used it on our salad and cous cous.. not extraordinary, but flavorful. I'll make it again, but it's not a "company dish".

I cooked this tonight and was very pleased with the results. I made the vinaigrette as instructed except for substituting garlic for the shallot. The dressing is punchy but very tasty and matched the salmon well (I'd imagine it might overwhelm a milder fish). I made a sort of salad with fresh corn, tomato, and basil cooked in olive oil, and served it with kale and rice. Made for a very nice summer meal, and given the ease of the recipe, I'll definitely make it again.

Took other reviewers advice and substituted fresh lemon juice for the vinegar and garlic for the shallot, (what I had on hand), and it was still delicious. My new favorite way to cook salmon. The vinaigrette was good on salad, too.

My husband and I cook this once a week. You can use salmon steaks or fillets. I leave out the vinegar and use a chopped clove of garlic instead of shallots. We usually do string beans and mashed red potatoes on the side. Delicious and sooo easy.

Was looking for something quick to do the other night with a piece of grilled salmon... this was perfect. Substituted white portion of ramps for shallots, but all else the same. Did use some of the vinaigrette on a salad as well. (Just plain spring greens.) YUM! Thinking about mixing up some more vinaigrette tonight as a condiment to a cooled steamed artichoke appetizer.

Delicious! Everyone enjoyed it, even my 3 children ranging in ages from 3-7! I didn't have shallots, so I added garlic. Didn't add as much oil. Put the vinaigrette over the fish (used Arctic Char instead of salmon) and then grilled. Served with an arugula salad with avocado, grapefruit, cucumbers, and some of the juice from the grapefruit. Also threw some potatoes on the grill as well! Yumm!

I did a variation on this recipe and it was fabulous. Instead of the vinegar I used the juice of a lemon, and included some of the pulp. I used the mustard, lemon juice, and honey as a glaze for baking. I broiled the salmon for a couple of minutes before serving to brown. Granted, this is not the recipe but I'll b making it again, and again.

I haven't had salmon before this recipe because I am not a fish eater, but I am trying to learn to eat it. This was excellent. I will make this again definitely.

Wonderful. Quick and very easy. In the vinaigrette I used green onions instead of shallots, added chopped garlic and put in an extra tablespoon of honey. It was very good.

Poker Guys really ate this up. It was easy enough and it presented great. Every one asked for the recipe, a first!!

I make this exactly as directed but I make extra dressing which I toss on a salad made of butter lettuce, bean sprouts, mandarin orange slices, avocado and toasted slivered almonds. I place the salmon on top of the salad and it is a hit every time. The sweet and crunch of the salad ingredients goes well with the sweet crunch of the vinaigrette. I make this about twice a month and have served it many times to guests. It's one of my favorite recipes. Oh yes, I have pan fried the salmon and it comes out just fine.

This was excellent. I didn't have any shallots, and I baked the salmon for 20 minutes at 400 degrees (grilling not really an option as it was 20 degrees outside). Put it over greens, olives, red onions and croutons. Delicious!!

Oh boy...this is a fabulous vinaigrette! My husband and I normally aren't salmon lovers but try to fit it into our diet for health reasons. This will remain in my repertoire. I made extra vinaigrette and served the salmon over mixed greens. Yum!

I also turned this into a salmon salad. I unfortunately don't have a grill so I broiled the salmon 5 to 6 inches from the heat until just cooked through, 12-15 minutes. I also basted with some of the mustard vinaigrette before cooking to keep the fish moist. Turned out great and easy for a weeknight!

I may be the only dissenter but I have several other grilled salmon recipes that are far better than this one. I found the vinaigrette too sweet and somewhat bland. I followed the recipe exactly, used Maille Old Style Whole Grain Dijon Mustard, etc. My guests have had my other salmon recipes and we all agreed that we wouldn't make this again.

Salmon is wonderful served fresh off the grill over salad of baby greens with slices of avocado, red grapefruit (Del Monte Fruit Naturals), and grape tomatoes. Drizzle vinaigrette over all. For less crunch, I used Maille Old Style Whole Grain Dijon Mustard in the vinaigrette.

I turned this into a salmon salad, using all these great ingredients. I agree with other reviewers. This vinaigrette is great. I used in on spinach, and plated salmon on top. I reserved some of the vinaigrette to drizzle over salmon. It was the best!

A fine variation for grilled salmon. I used sockeye and a new mustard, Grey Poupon Harvest Coarse Ground. The left over vinaigrette is an excellent salad dressing.

Rating: 4
Fabulous - even my 10yr old who previously tasted and disliked salmon loved it!! I made the vinaigrette ahead, and warmed it prior to serving, I used a scant amount of the warm vinaigrette tossed with spring mix lettuce, and then set the grilled salmon on the greens topped with remaining and added a sprinkle of toasted whole mustard seeds (just cracked in a pestle. I toast seeds in a dry iron skillet until a few start popping like popcord.

Of course its the vinaigrette that makes the salmon here... and what an awesome vinaigrette! I used orange blossom honey and coarse mustard. Make extra vinaigrette and use it on your garden salads... on night 2 my husband is still saying "Wow, this is great!"

Very easy to make and tasty as well. Followed the directions exactly and was very nice on Copper River Salmon (did not overpower the salmon).

This was a great sauce. We put a bit on the Salmon near the end of grilling, like others sugested. Then we served it for a sauce for the fish, & dressing for butter lettuce salad & dipping for deep fried artichokes.

This was truly delicious, but could have halved the sauce. Nevertheless, we were able to use it as a salad dressing later in the week. Leftover salmon made a terrific salmon salad too.

Rating: 3
Can we give 3 1/2 forks? This is very very good, following the recipe exactly, but I can not call it a dish beyond compare. The sauce enhances a great piece of salmon. I will make this again ... and I'd serve it to company on a week night when I don't have a lot of time to fuss.

Loved the crunchy mustard sauce - tasty, interesting change from my standard smooth Dijon/dill sauce. PS Texas Ranger: Excellent spoof on the so-called reviewers who critique a recipe after indicating they changed most of it! Grilling the canned tuna after omitting almost all the other ingredients - nice touch.

Rating: 3
Thought this was very good. Love mustard and wanted a change from the straight Dijon sauce I usually make. Do try to use mustard with big seeds - the pop adds nice texture. Otherwise, I can imagine it would be more pedestrian. To Texas Ranger: How did you manage to grill the canned tuna?

Rating: 4
So, basically you only used the suggestions of olive oil, salt and shallots? You didn't even make this recipe! No wonder it was "Blah"!

Rating: 1
I used tuna instead of salmon (from the can--Chunky White) and dispensed with the honey. I don't like mustard, so I didn't use it, and pepper is so overrated. The white wine vinegar seemed silly, so I omitted it. What a blahhh recipe.

Rating: 4
Took the suggestion to apply some of the dressing before grilling, then we passed the remainder around to drizzle over the cooked fish as wanted- absolutely fantastic! The salmon took on the flavor as it cooked without becoming overwhelmed. Very easy to prepare, followed directions as written. This is the first recipe I have given 4 forks, I cannot wait to make this again!

Great dish, easy to make. My one addition is to apply the sauce before grilling, allowing the honey to carmelize and lending a really nice texture to the salmon. We did this in a broiler and it worked great.

Very nice flavor. I substituted balsamic vinegar since we were all out of white wine vinegar. Flavor was still well matched with my atlantic salmon. I also used by mini cuisinart instead of wisking -- consistancy was a little thicker than wisking and therefore didn't run all over the plate.

We served this dish for a BBQ on the weekend to rave reviews. This is an easy recipe that translates well to chicken. The vinaigrette is perfect with the spinach on it's own. We will definitely make this again.

I used this recipe with some great wild salmon and we loved it! It has fabulous flavors. Contrary to another reviewer the mustard is a wonderful component of the vinaigrette. I also used sweet onion instead of shallot.

I realize I am no Bobby Flay, but, after trying this recipe, I can think of many more complimentary flavors to salmon than mustard (yes, even the expensive french kind). Martha Steward (can we still talk about her?) has a similar, although butter-based (instead of olive oil-based) sauce (without honey) with tarragon for veal chops, which is a knock out. Maybe I'm just not looking for my salmon to be reminiscent of a hot dog (LOL!)
