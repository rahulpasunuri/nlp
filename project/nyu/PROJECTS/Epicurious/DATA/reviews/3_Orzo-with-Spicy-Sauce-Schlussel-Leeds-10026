I make this all the time to go with grilled tuna or lacquered salmon. I make my own "pimento" by roasting red peppers and cutting them into strips and/or I add peeled cucumber matchsticks. I always add lots of cilantro andomit the jalapenos (family preference).

This was disappointing. All the ingredients sound great, but together it just wasn't that exciting. Frankly, it was a waste of fresh jalapenos. I think maybe if you bump up the sesame oil and peanut butter a little it might help.

Great recipe! I'm a personal chef and use this for my clients all the time. I leave out the sesame seeds and added shredded chicken poached in a ginger-scallion-broth and some shredded carrots, and it gets rave reviews.
