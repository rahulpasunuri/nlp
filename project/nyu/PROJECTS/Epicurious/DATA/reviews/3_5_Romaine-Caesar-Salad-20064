Whenever I make this caesar salad, someone usually asks for the recipe. I double the garlic and use fish sauce instead of anchovies and blend in moulinex. It has a lot of zip and flavor - highly recommend this recipe.

My guests enjoyed this salad. I actually reduced the anchovy to half what the recipe calls for. Still thought the dressing was a bit strong. I did my own croutons. Cubed fresh french bread and toasted them in olive oil over medium high heat until browned- lightly salted. I will use the dressing recipe again.

I prepared this for a friend and he told everyone about it and I have had 3 people ask me for the recipe. Of course...I took all of the credit!

I have been using this recipe for many years. When ever the family gets together I am aked to make it. I have a special wooden salad bowl just for that salad.When we moved I lost the recipe. Iwas so pleased to find it in your file.
