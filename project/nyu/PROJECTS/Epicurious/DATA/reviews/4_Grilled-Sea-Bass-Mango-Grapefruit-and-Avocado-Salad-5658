Fantastic! We made the fish rub and put it on Tilapia because it is much cheaper. I had never grilled fish before. Tilapia takes 3 minutes a side also. This dish feels light and healthy. I did add a pinch of salt to the entire dish.

Colorful & Tasty! Instead of fish I used shrimp, marinaded overnight then grilled. Presented on a bed of baby spinach, the grapefruit,avo, mango mounded in the center w/the grilled shrimp on both sides, all drizzled w/the dressing. A hit at our Cinco de Mayo potluck.

Wow! Sea Bass is EXPENSIVE! I bought one fillet which we shared for a (very) light dinner. Next time I may try a less expensive fish but now I'm spoiled; the sea bass was excellent. All in all a very tasty, easy to prepare meal. We had an Albarino (Morgadio)with it...quite good!

I'm only reviewing as the fish marinade. I went in an opposite direction on the salad as i was trying to make my husband like grapefruit and he doesn't... but the fish was phenomenal... i did leave out the alspice & chile powder by accident.. so i really didn't make the recipe, but what came out was fabulous.....i can only imagine the chili powder and allspice would have taken in another wonderful direction.. served it with a dry spanish wine.... lovely..i'll apologize to the other cooks as i hate it when you review a recipe and really don't follow it....very spanish.. can't wait to make it for company.

I just made the salad to take to a dinner party. It was a huge hit. I added some lime juice for punch and only had candied ginger on hand which was a perfect sub for fresh in the dressing. The hostess wanted some red onion so in it went. We used arugula for the greens. Yum!!!

Perfect healthy meal! I used sustainable tilapia instead of sea bass and it was delicious!

FANTASTIC. So beautiful too. Used baby spinach and sushi grade tuna. Would love to serve this at a party, but coordinating perfectly ripe mangoes, this morning's fish and a two-week-old dinner invitation could prove insurmountable. Husband and I lucked out.... WOW!

Excellent! I used baby spinich instead of mixed greens - good suggestion. Everything plays really well off of one another. The sea bass rub is excellent for the charcoal grill. Served with grilled pineapple for dessert - found the recipe on here. This will knock the socks off your guests - but sea bass certainly comes at a price.

Fabulous!

Visually stunning salad brimming with clean/bright flavours and an excellent composition of colour/texture. Served on a bed of baby spinach rather than mixed lettuce - was a harmonious pairing worthy of the other ingredients. Next time will try butter/Bibb lettuce as another reviewer suggested. Sea bass is becoming so hard to find, think this salad would also be delicious with seared ahi tuna. A blue ribbon recipe in every way!

This was wonderful and just right as written! It was a lovely presentation and was easy to make most of it ahead of time. I served it with Curried Peanut Soup (on this site) and crusty bread. We all thought it went well together.

Every one at the table, including myself, agreed this was a very delicious dish. We also agreed that the baby greens were not quite right. A few suggested either Bibb or Boston lettuce instead. When I make this again, I'll try different greens.

THE Best! The combination of sweet (mango) and sour ( grapefriut), and soft (avocado) and firm (sea bass) is wondeful. Great for a one dish main course for dinner parties...with bread of course!

THIS IS A GREAT DISH. I SUBSTITUED NECTARINES FOR THE MANGO THE SECOND TIME I MADE IT BECAUSE THE MANGO WAS TOO HARD TO SLICE NICELY. IT WAS WAY BETTER WITH NECTARINES ANYWAY. MUCH MORE FLAVOR. I ALSO LEFT OUT THE AVOCADO - TOO MANY CALORIES.

I made this dish without ever tasting sea bass before and after eating in some of the finest restaurants I have yet to find any combination nearly as good. This is a must try.

Looked great on the cover of the magazine but fell flat. There are a lot better recipes out there for both sea bass and salads

This one is a keeper! Prepared this for a dinner party, and everyone enjoyed the mix of flavors and, of course, the wonderful sea bass.

This didn't turn out so well for me -- maybe because the sea bass wasn't fresh enough. I served it to friends and they weren't so into it.

This dish was incredible! My husbands only complaint was the serving size of the fish was too small. He couldn't get enough and neither could I. We will definitely enjoy this again.

We found this to be an excellent salad. The flavor of the fish was offset very well by the fruit; a really tasty blending of flavors. One modification to the recipe: Used white wine vinegar and lime juice rather than Sherry wine vinegar.

I made this a long time ago and remember it being fabulous! We were worried about it being too "grapefruity," but it wasn't at all. We bought pink grapefruit segments in a jar(refridgerated section in produce) to save time. We used the juice in the jar instead of regular grapefruit juice, and it worked well.

This is a wonderful light summer salad meal. Be sure to order the sea bass from your fish market ahead. I was ready to substitute grilled tuna, but didn't have to as my fish market came through at the last minute.

The fish marinade is scrumptious! The whole salad has such flavor and everything works!
