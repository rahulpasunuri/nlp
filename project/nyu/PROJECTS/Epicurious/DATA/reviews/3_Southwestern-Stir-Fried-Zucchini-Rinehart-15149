This is a nice way to use excess zucchini from the garden. The poblanos and red pepper add subtle sweetness and spice, especially if you leave in a few seeds from the poblanos. I substituted ground cumin, but think this would be better with cumin seed.

Tasty! I overcooked it slightly the first time I made it, which is very easy to do with zucchini, so watch out.

Quite flavorful and zippy. Don't overcook and let the zuch get too mushy.

Using the previous suggestion of more poblano chilles really kicked this dish up a notch...however, for those who don't like it hot, I suggest following the original recipe. Good recipe to have in the summer zucchini file.

This was a wonderfully tasty dish. Next time I will add at least two more poblano chilies - we love the taste of that pepper. Try it - you won't be dissappointed
