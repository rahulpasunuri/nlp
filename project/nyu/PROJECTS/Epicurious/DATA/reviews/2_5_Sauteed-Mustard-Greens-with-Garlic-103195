Good basic method.

I don't really like mustard greens but this was pretty good. Like others, I subbed chicken broth for the water. They still tasted like mustard greens but they weren't half bad, which is actually a ringing endorsement.

I love bitter greens, but did not like mustard greens when I ate them in the past. This recipe was pretty tasty, though, and changed my outlook on mustard greens. I had a huge mess of em in the garden from a salad mix that I allowed to get overgrown. I left on some of the smaller stems, tore the greens into large pieces. I did a 30 second blanch on them to reduce the bitterness, followed by an ice bath. Next time I think I might blanch for a little longer, considering they were still pretty bitter and even a bit tongue numbing. I then followed the recipe but also sauteed one cut up slice of pancetta with the garlic and eyed the olive oil, using less than 1/4 cup. I did not add water to the sautee pan, since there was enough water clinging to the greens from the blanch and ice bath. Added a good dose of crushed red pepper to the sautee as well. Next time, I think I will leave out the pancetta, it didn't really bring anything exciting to the party, and maybe add a bit of sugar to balance out the bitterness, as per hubby's suggestion. So I guess I altered this recipe a good deal to get it where I wanted it but ultimately I like this recipe because I like the mashed garlic paste and olive oil preparation for this veggie.

My first time eating mustard greens and in a word, yuck. I followed this recipe to the letter but the end result was so bitter, I had to spit it out. My husband didn't touch the stuff, and we normally love cooked greens.

Love it, picked fresh out of the garden minutes before it goes into the pot. I used a little chicken stock instead of water & added a couple pats of butter at finish.

Maybe I just got a good bunch of mustard greens, but I liked this, and I made it strictly according to the recipe. I didn't find it bitter.

I've been trying this recipe with variations and it seems to be that some mustard greens are just a LOT more bitter than others. The best I've gotten it is add a handful of chopped shallots to the garlic, add butter to the oil, chop the greens instead of just cutting them in half, adding 1/2 cup of white wine and letting it simmer off, and then adding about a cup of heavy cream and letting it cook down. Different recipe, I guess :)

I found they turned out more bitter than Collard greens - I like Collard greens when they're not _too_ bitter. Never had broccoli rabe before. I tried sauteeing the garlic in 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil in a non-stick pot, added the mustard greens (only had one bunch) and 3 tablespoons chicken broth (no water except that I didn't really dry the mustard greens off after washing). Maybe I cooked them too long...or too short? they were just beginning to turn dark green. If I could find a way to make them less bitter I'd try it again.

I am not a green eater, but moving to the south I've decided to venture into the culture. You have to like a taste like broccoli rabe to like this recipe but my husband and I both loved it. I did substitute chicken broth for the water and we finished the whole pan in one sitting. Will make again!

First time tasting mustard greens. They were extremely bitter tasting. Will not be trying these again.

YUK!!! I have never panned a recipe before but here goes. This was awful. Maybe it would be better if you cut down--way down--on the olive oil. The greens were just green and greasy. Not to my taste at all. Definitely try some fresh lemon if you try this at all.

Good recipe that I will make again with more garlic and a little fresh lemon added to the pan.

My first taste ever of mustard greens and the dish was delicious. The taste is similar to rabe which I love. Husband liked it, too.
