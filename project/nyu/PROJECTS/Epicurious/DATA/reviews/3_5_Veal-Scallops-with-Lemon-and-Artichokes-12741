Really easy to make with delicious results!

This is a minimalist recipe. I added 1/4 c pinenuts, 1/4 cup sundried tomatoes, 2 cloves of garlic, and reduced stock and added 1/4 c vermouth. I doubled the sauce. Next time I think I will use olives instead of the tomatoes and I will reduce the lemon juice slightly and add lemon zest. The sauce does need to be thickened with either flour or corn starch. An Alsatian Pinot Blanc goes well with it.

I added some caper's and slivered almonds....put in a little less lemon based on other reviews. Definitely a keeper...easy, quick and tasty!!

Not sure what I did wrong, but the sauce was much too lemon-y, and the cream curdled when I added it to the sauce.

Quick, easy, and delicious! I too used the input from the Atlanta cook adding in sun dried tomatoes, a little heavy cream and toasted pine nuts. Simple ingredients and can easily be pulled together in 30 minutes. A keeper.

Great Easy recipe. I took the advise of the last person and I was great. All I added was some fresh mushrooms. The touch of cream and toasted pine nuts where the secret.

Loved the basics of this dish. I did add a few ingredients that I think really made it special. First you absolutely need to double the artichokes(I used canned - not marinated). I also added toasted pine nuts and sun dried tomato strips(in oil) to the pan when the scallops were taken out. Did not strain but really reduced the liquid. Put in a pinch of cream at the end.

This dish was a big hit at my house. I used boneless chicken breasts instead and added a little bit of flour to the broth to thicken it up a bit. It was very tasty.

I've made this twice and have had great success both times. The second time, though, I substituted pork for the veal. It was equally delicious and one-third the cost.

Good basic recipe. I added a clove of crushed garlic to the butter/oil before frying the veal; some zest tot he lemon juice; some small capers and a few black olives with the artichokes. Served with steamed baby leaks.

Thickened the sauce as suggested with flour & cream. Really needs the marinade from the artichokes. Subtle and lovely

I made this dish for my boyfriend for Valentine's day this year and we both loved it. Followed the advice of the other reviewers and added a little cream and cornstarch to the sauce at the end to thicken it and give it a more creamy consisitency. So easy to make and so good....you should really try preparing this dish if you haven't yet!

Great dish - I have made this a few times. I agree that you have to add a little more flour to thinken up the sauce.

Terrific recipe. Found the ingredients and proportions worked great. To thicken the sauce a little, I cheated and added about a tablespoon of a one to one mixture of flour and butter. Delicious!

Was not what I expected from the reviews. No one liked it very much. I won't be making this again.

This has become a new veal favorite. We also added the capers and cream, and doubled the artichokes. In addition, we did not rinse the artichokes so it gave the sauce a little extra zing. Angel hair pasta w/ the sauce was a perfect side dish.

Great! Easy to make and delicious! As I am on a lo-carb diet, I substituted the wheat flour for soy flour -- no difference in taste. I also chose to use a jar of "Hot" (spicy) artichokes and a few capers. A restaraunt quality dinner that I will definitely make again.

We thought this was a decent recipe for veal. Like the other cook, I added some heavy cream to thicken up the sauce. I also made extra sauce and used to serve over light eggless noodles. I would defintely make again

This was good. I also added a little half&half. Reduced till thick. Also added the capers as others suggested.I did not strain. I just look out scallops, put in warm oven and finshed sauce.

Probably the best veal dish I've ever experienced. I added capers and cream to the sauce, along with a little chopped Italian parsley. Fabulous! Our dinner guests participated in the preparation and loved the entire experience.

I made this dish for Valentines Day romantic dinner, it was not only delicious but really easy and quick. A big pay off for minimum work. I added cream to the sauce as on reviewer had suggested, makeing the sauce smooth and added more volume. Great Recipe!!

The sauce that can be made with this dish is a real keeper! I added cream to thicken the sauce and capers then served over angel hair pasta. Magnifique!! I love to cook with sauces and this is an excellent one.

I can't even count how many times I've made this dish. I don't use marinated artichokes but canned. If I have capers, I throw them in at the end. And I usually serve with capelinni mixed with fresh spinach. This dish also works great with chicken!!!

This is excellent! We made a full recipe of the artichoke "sauce" for only 2 servings and thoroughly enjoyed it.

This was delicious! The only problem we had was that the sauce never thickened. Next time we'll add less chicken broth. The taste of the artichokes with the veal was wonderful!

This recipe didn't have nearly enough sauce. It seemed to have mostly evaporated. The sauce (what little there was), did have a nice zing.

Each bite is best with a bit of artichoke, so I'd add more (maybe double?). Otherwise, it was a good dish!

I found the lemon and marinated artichokes competed with each other in flavor. The lemon also added too much tartness.

This is a fabulous, easy to prepare recipe. Try to add some of the oil in the marinated artichoke hearts to the sauce for even greater zing.
