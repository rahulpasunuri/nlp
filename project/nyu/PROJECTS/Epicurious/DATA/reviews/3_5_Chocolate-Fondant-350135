After looking at several recipes this one stood out as quick and easy. I made it for the first time for a small dinner party of four, and it turned out perfectly. Like a previous poster suggested, I had all ingredients prepped and just threw them in the oven while guests chatted after dinner. A perfect fondant: "lava cake", oozing in the center, drawing oohs and aaahs as it should. I served them with vanilla whipped cream I had made earlier and sliced strawberries tossed with a bit of fine sugar. The tart strawberries do go well with the rich chocolate. It tastes marvelous even cooked to solid though, which is a "mistake" I made making it again the next day. That day I served it with Cherry Garcia. :)

This recipe yields a very dense and rich fondant. Similar to the previous poster from San Francisco, I substituted Tia Maria with Kahlúa.The next time I make this, I'd prefer to pair it with something sour (perhaps a quenelle of mango sorbet and some fresh berries) to balance off the rich chocolate texture.

I prepped these ahead and placed them in the refrigerator, on a tray covered with wrap. Right as we sat down to dinner, I slipped them into the oven. They did have to bake longer, since they were so cold, probably about 4 - 5 minutes longer than the recipe calls for (I wasted one because I turned it out after 12 minutes and it was uncooked and runny). I used Kahlua as I didn't have Tia Maria. Served with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. All my guests loved it. Will make again.

I disagree with the previous poster. It's not necessary to make every dish ahead. It would be simple to have the ingredients prepped and measured. This serves 4 and as part of such an intimate dinner party would be easy to excuse oneself for 10 minutes or have the guests in the kitchen enjoying wine or an after dinner drink while having something fresh and wonderful prepared for them.

In his article he preaches to prep ahead. So how does this keep your dinner party simple with prep ahead dishes? I've used similar recipes and possibly you could freeze it and bake it off, or maybe it can hold in the fridge and be prepped that am, but Ramsay leaves us in the dark. Too bad. Use the chocolate whiskey souffle recipe on this site instead. You can freeze them up to a week ahead and put them in the oven when you sit down to dinner. Now that's stress-free.
