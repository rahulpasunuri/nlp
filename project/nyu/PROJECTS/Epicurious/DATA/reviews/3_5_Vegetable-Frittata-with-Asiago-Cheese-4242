Comes together quickly and makes for a nice light breakfast or brunch. I might add mushrooms next time as I thought it was a little lacking in umami. I did not separate any eggs, just used 6 whole. Great base recipe to make as is or substitute different vegetables as you please.

I am an alter-er. I tried this once as-written and it was simple and tasty. This morning, though, I wanted to make it again but (1) had no Asiago Cheese and (2) had no fresh basil. I used crumbled feta sprinkled on top and, instead of fresh herbs I added dried basil and a little oregano into the egg mix. Tremendous! Nice to have such a simple recipe that can work so many ways.

Yum! Made this for my husband, who loved it. We left out the spinach (it didn't look so hot this morning) but upped the other veggies to make up for it. Will definitely make this again.

Tasty frittata. Next time might add sauteed mushrooms. Agiago cheese on top gave it a wonderful flavor and it was pretty to look at too. I was afraid that the ratio of 3 whole eggs plus six eggs whites would lessen the taste but it was fine the way it was.

Turned out great! Def. will make this again. I did change a few things around....yellow pepper instead of red, parm. instead of asiago, and I added a chopped portobello mushroom. Actually ended up being pretty easy to make too!

Great combination of flavors and the fresh chopped basil & tomato on top is perfect. I made this for Thanksgiving day brunch with sides of roasted red potatoes and fresh strawberries. It's yummy and also great leftover. Next time I will chop all the veges the night before.

tripled the recipe... prob would have been better if it wasnt overcooked. made it for a brunch, and most was gone. also i sauteed the veggies, then spread on a greased (w/ olive oil) 13x9 glass baking tray. puffed nicely. baked at 375... when egg had firmed (edges will firm first...wait till center starts to firm) sprinkled asiago cheese atop.

This was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as written and was thrilled with how it came out, particularly as a function of how much time it took to prepare. Made it for a brunch and everyone wanted seconds!

I made this for weekend brunch. I used half-and-half like someone else suggested, and a bit of hot sauce. It was a hit with my veggie-loving friends.

Fantastic for ease of preparation and taste. I sub carrots for zucchini and let the tomatoes bake into the cheese and it is a keeper.

This was my first time making a frittata and it was much easier than I expected. I sort of combined this recipe and the "Summer Vegetable Frittata" recipe on this site, which meant adding a bit of proscuitto, more zucchini (3 medium) and chopped leeks. The key was following another poster's suggestion to use carmelized onions - that really gave it a lot of flavor. The fresh tomato and basil at the end was great too. Overall a very good recipe that I will make again.

Pretty tasty, and very easy, which ranks it high in my book. I was left, however, feeling like it was lacking something. Some kind of seasoning, perhaps? Or maybe I'm just not used to eating low-fat foods and am missing the egg yolk. I noticed other cooks mentioning that they had problems with the wateriness of the tomatos ontop at the end; I used halved cherry tomatos and didn't have a problem at all- plus it looked really cute.

An excellent dish, which we will make time and again. Used 8 whole and 4 egg whites to fill our 12" skillet, and upped everything else accordingly. Also added sliced mushrooms. Can't wait to try it again. Next time I'll add more asiago into the egg mixture itself, as well as more on top. Also will make the tomato and basil into a bit more of a salsa and serve with fresh croissants.

This was very good and very easy - made for mother's day. I used 7 eggs with some half and half (to make it fluffier) instead of all of those egg whites... I covered the plastic handle of my non-stick skillet with alluminum foil and just put that in the oven, which worked great. Fantastic!

I followed this recipe by ingredient, but was using a 12" cast iron skillet as a previous rater used and increased the eggs accordingly. I personally wasn't put off by the "crusty" egg on the bottom - it was thin and actually, tasty. It did take a little longer under the broiler, as pervious people have stated, but the end product was delicious. Pared it for dinner with a light, green salad, & a nice chardonnay, and it was perfect. The only thing I changed was giving the tomato & basil a quick "broil" to warm them up. Would definitely make it again. Reheated the left-overs next day for lunch in the micro - still very good the next day. A keeper!!!

This is the first frittata I ever made (granted it was a few years back) but even back then my meat lover huband loved it!

Yummy! I did just as the recipe called for, but next time I would add a little water to the eggs - to make them a little lighter and to avoid over-cooking. My husband liked the light flavor of the dish - however, I will add some extra seasoning next time. Also, let the asiago cheese get really brown and crispy under the broiler - so good!

This was delicious! It took a little longer under the broiler (5 or 6 min total instead of 2) to finish. Very filling and nutritious.

Delicious! I made it for a brunch and it was a huge hit with both the vegetarians and meat eaters in the group.

I made this following the recipe (mostly - carmelized the onions, added mushrooms, used green onion instead of basil) and I like it; but I don't like that soggy crust-like layer that forms on the bottom of egg dishes. So I tried again a couple nights later and tested it two ways: one using canned flaky rolls for a crust, and the other using sliced pre-cooked potatoes for a crust. Both were great! I would highly recommend trying these variations. Again, I varied the vegetables - I started by sauteeing a slice of diced bacon, then used sauteed shallots, mushrooms, zuchini, and spinach - delicious.

I loved the cool tomatoes on top with fresh basil. I added some feta and chives too. The fresh taste makes it a recipe I'll repeat. And it's quick!

This recipe is SO modifiable! Just keep the egg ratio 2 white : 1 whole. The rest is easy. I followed the basic recipe but used carmelized onion, bacon, sage, and an extra cup of asiago. Before broiling I put on a layer of parmesan and decorated with a few slices of tomato and sage leafs. Cooking times and process of the recipe made this dish resulted in multi-compliments.

Very easy to make and excellent results. Our pan was bigger than the one called (12 inch cast iron), so we upped the number of eggs to 6 whole and 3 whites and it still came out wonderfully. A big hit at brunch.

I originally thought this recipe to be a bit bland, however, when I drizzled a good balsamic vinegar over it before serving it was wonderful! I even ate it cold the next day.

I used whole eggs so a couple less total, but otherwise made as is. I really liked the asiago and fresh basil. Next time I'll slice tomato, drizzle with a little olive oil, and broil along with the cheese. This was easy, tasty, and hearty. Definitely will make again.

I had no idea that Martha Stewart's twin lived in Pittsford, NY. Anyway, we really liked this dish and will absolutely make it again. Very flavorful and hearty.

The red onion, red bell pepper, zucchini, & spinach not only added a mixture of varying flavors but also added eye appeal. I think what made this dish come alive and added sparkle to it was the addition of the toppings of chopped tomatoes and basil.

Delicious! Made this for dinner tonight with a green salad...love the blend of flavors and the lightness of the dish due to the egg whites...will make this again!

The Frittata has been a favorite in my family for Sunday brunches . I have found - just as with an American omelette -that the frittata ( the Italian word for omelette ) is less likely to be broken on being slid out of the oven-suitable pan if the various presauteed vegetables and the cheese slices and grated cheese are placed on the surface of the partially cooked egg just before being placed under the preheated broiler . About two to four minutes under the broiler will complete the cooking of the egg and the melting of the cheese . Finally , with spatulas , carefully separate the frittata from the pan and slide it onto a large serving platter - I like one with a Mediterranean decorative motif - for cutting into appropriate slices . Salt may be added as desired by each guest .Vary the vegetables , herbs , and cheeses as desired in preparing your frittata .Buon appetito !

Very tasty, relatively healthy, and quite simple. I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 12 in. cast iron skillet. I served the frittata along with asparagus and Amy's chicken breakfast sausage for an impromptu brunch this morning. I look forward to eating the leftover frittata for breakfast tomorrow.

I made this frittata in my only non-stick pan, which is 8 inches, so it took a long time to set, but it still came out well. My frittata was a bit watery, which was probably because I decided to add the tomatoes in with the other vegetables. It was still delicious and I would definitely make it again, but without the tomatoes. This recipe also lends itself to a multitude of variations.

This is a very good and easy dish to make. I substituted 1 c. frozen chopped onion instead of cutting one myself. That saves some time!

My brunch guests and I loved this recipe. I served it for four people, and there was plenty for second helpings ... which no one refused. I added extra asiago cheese, as recommended by other reviewers. I don't have a 10" non-stick, oven-safe skillet, so I sautéed the veggies in a larger pan (as suggested by the Tampa cook), and then transferred the veggie mixture to my guaranteed-to-stick 10", oven-safe Wolfgang Puck skillet, which I'd coated generously with cooking spray and heated on a back burner while the veggies were being sautéed. I poured the eggs over the veggie mixture and let the bottom set on the stove before putting it under the broiler. When it was time to plate the frittata, I just gave the pan a little shake, and the frittata came loose beautifully (thank heaven!).

Rating: 3
Taste-wise and visually, this dish was great, even though I couldn't find Asiago cheese and added dried basil to the eggs instead of using fresh basil at the end. As for the preparation, though, I've never made frittata before and had trouble getting this one to cook through. It took forever, the top wouldn't cook, and it all broke apart. Was it because I replaced the 6 egg whites with 4 whole eggs? Also, the onion and bell pepper needed far less than 8 mins. And how many people have a nonstick pan that can go under a broiler? Next time, I will combine the eggs and veggies in a baking pan and cook the dish in an oven.

I've never had a frittata before so I was a bit intimidated because I thought I'd cook the eggs wrong. However, the recipe was really easy and the results were wonderful! I added a little more cheese at the end to give it a little more flavor and I loved it. I will definatley make this again.

I agree with the NJ reviewer that this was a little bland but three forks because the veggies were tasty. I made an 8 inch cast iron skillet's worth of fritatta for two people. I used half a red onion, half a red pepper, a tiny zucchini, some rainbow chard instead of spinach (if you've never used rainbow chard, be on the lookout for it -- it's beautiful! orange and red and green and yellow...), and 4 whole eggs. I added dried thyme to the eggs instead of basil at the end, because I didn't have any. I found myself wishing there were more asiago. I also omitted the salt (as I often do in other dishes, including frittatas), and I missed it. I make fritattas often, and I've always wanted tomato with my fritatta, but I've have trouble with watery-ness if I actually put tomato in the fritatta; I thought this was a creative and visually appealing solution, and I will definitely add chopped tomato to the tops of my fritattas from now on. When I make this again, I will add a little milk to the eggs to thin them out a little because otherwise I find that they set too quickly otherwise. I served this with organic blue potatoes sauteed with crushed garlic cloves and rosemary, which complemented the dish really well. I'd make this again, if only because of the wonderful, exciting array of colorful veggies in this dish.

Loved it!!!! No ingredient changes, but one suggestion: try preparing through the wilting of the spinach in a larger pan (which is alot easier to stir in the larger pan) and then transfer to the 10" pan and add the eggs. I let the Asagio get a little browned and crispy and what a hit! Can't wait to make this again! KIMBER

A good, light summer meal that certainly gets in your daily quota of vegetables. I gave it 3 forks even though I found it a little bland because I liked the flavor of all the veggies. Definitely worth making again ... I'll try adding some cayenne pepper to the eggs and as one reviewer did, maybe some green chiles.

I made this last night for my "meat-loving" husband and he really enjoyed it. I even made it with egg-substitute and you can't tell because it's so jammed packed with delicious vegetables. I substituted a mixture of ortega chiles and jalapenos for the red peppers for a little zing. This is great for a light dinner or brunch. Will definitly make again!!

Delicious, easy to prepare. Makes a great Sunday brunch with grilled foccacia and fruit. I had leftovers and heated them at work; tasted just about as good as the first day.
