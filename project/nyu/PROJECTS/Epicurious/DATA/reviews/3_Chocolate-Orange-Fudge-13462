I must have made an error making this recipe because the fudge is only 1/4 inch thick. Any suggestions?

Definitely a grainy fudge. I had problems finding the candied orange peel, so I just added 1 tsp of orange extract instead. It still worked, as many people complimented.

Great Christmas fudge! Even my friends who aren't great fudge lovers really liked this fudge. The candied citrus makes a unique taste...I did use more than specified.
