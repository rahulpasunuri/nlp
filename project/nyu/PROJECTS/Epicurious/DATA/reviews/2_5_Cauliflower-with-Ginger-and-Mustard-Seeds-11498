The volatility of the hot oil, exploding mustard seeds and added spices was a distraction. And after all of that the flavors were not very interesting. I would not make this again.

I have made this many times and it is always a hit. It is flavorful and so easy! I do double the ingredients for the sauce, though

I really did not like this at all. I won't make it again.

Bland. I also don't like the flavor of the mustard seeds after they are cooked. They have a fishy flavor. If you make this, definitely use the cilantro. It was the only flavor I liked.

For the ease with which this dish is put together it is well worth fourth forks for the results. The flavors mixed nicely. Lemon and coriander are a must!

Be careful with the temperature while cooking the mustards seeds, as mustard easily loses flavour when temperature's too high. I added lime juice instead of lemon because I think it has a bit more fragrance. I also used some ground coriander as I don't like fresh. Very good combined with a beef curry.

This is more like a 2 1/2 forker. We liked the subtle flavor (had to use yellow mustard seeds as I couldn't find black... hey, I'm stuck in Nebraska!) and it didn't clash with the curry dish I fixed along with it.

If you are not familiar with the method for cooking the mustard seeds, please don't repeat my mistake! Be careful of the temperature you are cooking at, and think twice about stirring while they are popping...I ended up with mustard seeds and oil all over my kitchen and the ginger burnt up when I added it....all in all the dish was pretty bland, though my husband and 6 year old enjoyed it.

cauliflower sauteed with indian spices is one of my favorite veggies from childhood. :-) for those who combined it with the cauliflower/coriander/cumin recipe -- to make the whole process a little easier, you can also add the cumin + coriander from that recipe into the oil along with the ginger + turmeric. this way you skip the added step of putting the dish in the oven (plus, one less dish to clean!). also, i would reduce the amount of water used for steaming, and allow the final cooking to happen dry so that the cauliflower browns/caramelizes a bit.

Taking the advice of the Cook from Boston 04/25/99 I combined this and ROASTED CAULIFLOWER WITH CORIANDER AND CUMIN SEEDS. It was spicier and quite tasty

My personal favorite cauliflower recipe, even those who don't care for cauliflower, love. I use fennel seeds, garlic, tumeric, and salt. It's from one of my favorite Indian cookbooks. Sautee the garlic in gee until it just begins to brown slightly, toss in about 1/4 t. fennel seeds per serving, match amount of tumeric, salt lightly, and steam without adding any water, over med heat, covered, until steam escapes lid, (about 4-6 minutes. The cauliflower must be in bite size pieces.)

If this dish is made following the recipe, it falls short. However, if the spices are altered slightly, it becomes much better. Try adding garam masala, cumin, a litte red pepper, and some coriander. This will greatly improve the taste.

Looking for a an Indian-style roasted cauliflower dish, I combined this recipe with ROASTED CAULIFLOWER WITH CORIANDER AND CUMIN SEEDS. I used this recipe as the "prep" step before starting the 2nd recipe. My dinner partner said: "thumbs up, it's a keeper." Combining the 2 gives the extra spice oomph lacking in each.

This had a bright, refreshing taste, without the muddy or bitter taste of some Indian vegetable dishes. It did seem to need more complexity. With a little adjustment, it could be a great dish. I'd like to know what others think.

I will try again changing some spice, maybe more gimger and less the other ones, and I will send you the result
