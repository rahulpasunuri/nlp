I soaked the crabs for about 15 minutes in the milk. The crabs were extremely mushy inside. Nice and crispy outside! Like biting into a chocolate truffle with a liquid filling. Not sure what is up with this. Have sauteed crabs many times without soaking and thought that 'bulking' them up would be a good thing but the texture was not good. I like them to still be flehsy inside but crisp on the outside.

A completely successful preparation for one of nature's greatest gifts: soft shelled crabs in season. I added some smoked paprika to the flour which added just that little pinch of heat and smokiness. Otherwise, ambrosial.

To the milk I add 2 tbsp dried tarragon. It gives the crabs a unique flavor without overpowering the flavor of the crab itself. It is a subtle flavor but I must admit that I am very fond of tarragon in a lot of dishes.

This was fantastic! the only mods I made were using low fat butter milk with a few dashes of Tabasco and a few dashes of cayenne in the flour mixture. They were great by themselves and honestly didn't need the Remoulade sauce

Purchased ours in Calvert Co., MD. Keep it simple by adding some Tabasco to the soaking milk.

This is a wonderful dish, and very easy to make. I did add 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the butter and sauteed 1 minute before adding crabs. I also used a TBSP of creole seasoning mixed into the flour. An excellent side dish is shredded cabbage (cole slaw) from a bag. Toss with Ken's light Asian sesame with ginger and soy.

I have made this recipe for years without changing a thing, and we all love it, including my children. This recipe is now a yearly tradition for us.

We've sauteed soft- shelled crabs many times, but had never soaked them in milk first - loved the crispy outcome! We also add Worchestershire sauce just before serving - delicious!

Add Old Bay Seasoning to the dredging flour and it's more of a Maryland classic!

Recipe was improved by the addition of 6 cloves of garlic, chopped. Added to oil and butter and sauteed a minute before introducing crabs. This addition brought it up to 4 forks for us.
