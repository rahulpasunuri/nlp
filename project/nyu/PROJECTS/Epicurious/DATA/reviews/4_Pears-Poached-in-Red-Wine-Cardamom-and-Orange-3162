I peel and core the pears from the bottom end leaving stems intact. Cook and refrigerate in sauce. Next day I stuff them with mixture of bleu cheese, cream cheese, walnuts & dried cranberries.serve as salad over greens. Make vinaigrette from poaching liquid. Fabulous.

Heeded others' advice & decreased sugar to scant 2 cups. No orange on hand so used rind & juice from one Satsuma. Totally wowed dinner party of 8 devoted foodies. We wanted to lick our plates.

I made candied orange peel first and used the leftover simple sugar with orange oils in place of the sugar, orange peel & water in this recipe and I would do this again. I made it a day ahead and it was great - not mushy or overcooked.

Everything about this was perfect for me. The amount of sugar was just right considering it is of course a dessert... I like it sweet :)

Rating: 2
This was good, but a serious heads-up about the sugar content. Recipes for pears poached in red wine are never difficult or obscure so no surprise that this looks and tastes good. The amount of sugar is this recipe is a real turn-off though! I was prepared for it being too sweet for my liking as is, so I reduced the amount of sugar and then added the little lemon juice I had at hand. Even that was insufficient! In desperation I ended up adding some apple cider vinegar just to cut the overpowering sugariness. Be very careful and aware of what your limits are. 2 and a quarter cups sugar per bottle of wine (plus 2 cups of water and a bit of juice) is just too much.

Fabulous! My daughter talked about it for days. Easy except you have to start a day ahead. The wine reduction is unbelievable. I served this for dessert on Christmas with a small scoop of softened vanilla ice cream and pizzelle cookies. Rave reviews from all!

Divine! My pears were a bit hard, so I cooked them much longer in the liquid which left them to caramelize while the liquid cooked down into a sticky, unctuous syrup. This is a "must make" recipe. I served the pear half on a pool of heavy cream with Reisling sorbet and a ginger-oat cookie. I also served it filled with creme fraiche. Both ways tasted fantastic.

Amazing! Added 1/4 vanilla bean and used cardamom pods (strained it before serving). Used 2c sugar and reduced it to a heavenly think syrup.

Rating: 4
Great dessert! Added ½ a vanilla bean, 4 cloves and a star anise to syrup, really great. Several people said they were too full for dessert until they got a load of this, then suddenly they had room! Will certainly prepare again

Just wanted to add my 4 forks rating to a wonderful recipe. Beautiful presentation, incredable taste, reasonably healthy and loved by friends.

I am not a cook and use this site as cooking lessons. For someone who's most complex dessert to date was chocolate chip cookies off the Nestle chocolate chip bag, this was really easy. I followed the reciepe exactly (inluding buying the $12 bottle of Cardamon, now I have to make this again!!) I did take the suggestions from other reviews and boiled the sauce down much longer. I served it over vanilla ice cream. It turned our great and a little more grown up than chocolate chip cookies and a tall glass of milk for our guests!

Guests loved this one. Next time I wouldn't use the 2 Buck Chuck wine (a little bitter). We halved some Comice pears and poached them along with whole d'Anjous, and the Comice were much better. I used crumbled ginger snaps on top, and they were great.

Rating: 4
This recipe impresses my guests everytime. I spice it up just a little by adding some fresh ginger. I also serve it with homemade ginger icecream. Last time I used the slow cooker and let the syrup reduce over night. What a delight!! Rich in flavor and syrupy. It is a stable in my recipe box.

Rating: 3
Only change I made was to cut sugar to a scant 2 cups, and adding a squirt of honey. Next time I will half the pears before serving. While the full pear presents well, it's a little awkward to eat.

Rating: 3
We halved and cored the pears but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Served with vanilla gelato - delicious!

Rating: 4
What a great recipe. Great combination of flavors. Love it.

Rating: 4
I've made this a few times now and it is always a hit! I use 3-buck Chuck, doubling the wine called for so that I have more syrup to coat the pears during and after cooking. I've served this with vanilla ice cream with a great reception, but the pears taste even better paired with a cheese-based ice cream (parmesan or goat cheese) or whipped mascarpone.

Rating: 3
I used a fruity, peppery red Zin for the poaching liquid and it was perfect. I agree that the sauce is the key and I will save it to use as a glaze on grilled chicken, etc. as well as using on desserts. Presentation is beautiful.I used way less sugar than called for. Will definitely make this again!

Rating: 4
Yummy! A total crowd-pleaser. I used an inexpensive Cabernet("2-buck Chuck" from Trader Joe's, which worked great). I used Bosc pears. I dizzled only a little bit of the sauce upon serving & put the rest of the sauce in a "gravy boat," so that guests could add more according to taste (it's super sweet). It got devoured by everyone (adults and kids alike).

Rating: 4
I had some leftover white wine and port from my other recipes, so I added those in, reducing the red wine accordingly, and it was great. Definitely save the extra liquid - my Thanksgiving guests were fighting over who would get some to take home!

Rating: 2
I found this sickeningly sweet. I would make it again but only add just a bit of sugar. The sweetness killed all of the other tastes. Otherwise, I think it was an easy recipe for making poached pears.

Delicious. I used 2.5 cups wine, 3/4 cups sugar, 1/2 cup water, more cardamom, more cinnamon and kept the rest the same. Fantastic.

This dish was a hit at my husband's birthday dinner. The whole family was enthralled with the sauce and almond biscotti crumbs gave the dish the perfect texture and crunch. Be sure to use fresh pressed orange juice and don't be shy about doubling up on cinnamon sticks or freshly ground cardamom seeds.

Rating: 3
These were terrific. It took quite a while to boil the sauce down to a syrup, but I like it thick. Served it with homemade vanilla ice cream and Maida Haetter's ginger and almond biscotti. Yum.

Rating: 4
As others have suggested, I cut the syrup in half and used pear halves instead of whole pears. Makes a lovely, light dessert with the almond biscotti I made...and all done a day ahead. One mistake I made...do not store the poached pears in the syrup. Store separately or the pears get a little ragged looking.

Rating: 4
This is a fabulous dish; it was very simple, and absolutely delicious. The pears were even better the next day, and the sauce was great warmed up, then poured on ice cream.

Rating: 4
My husband is not especially fond of fruit desserts, yet he and my guests loved this simple dish. It is one of those dishes tht is greater than the sum of its ingredients. Even after the pears are gone, the juice is fabulous over ice cream.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! Everyone loved this dish including a very picky five-year old! We are using the leftover syrup over ice cream and love it that way too!

Rating: 4
Yum yum and so easy. If there is any left over sauce it is great on ice cream alone!

Rating: 4
A wonderful way to serve pears, especially if you have a number of ripe ones that need to be used. Also a great way to use red wine that's no longer quite good enough to drink. This was a last minute decision, and with no ice cream in the house, I placed a small scoop of goat cheese in each dish, and drizzled both pears and cheese with the syrup. It was outstanding.

Rating: 3
Made this for dessert on a beautiful spring night. Served it with low fat frozen yogurt rather than ice cream and sprinkled it with fresh blackberries, along with the orange peel and a sprig of pineapple mint. I agree with some other reviewers about it being a bit sweet but some fresh lemon juice helped cut down on that, as well as the blackberries. Also, as other reviewers suggested, I halved the pears before poaching - a full pear is too much for one... Lastly, I didn't have cardamom so I skipped it and I still think it turned out perfect!

Rating: 4
I made 24 of these for a brunch to accompany crab quiche and champagne.I served them cold and everyone wanted the recipe. The taste is outstanding. While there is more liquid than needed for four pears, just increase the pears. They keep for several days in the frig and make a wondeful snack with goat cheese rolled in toasted pecans. This recipe is truly fabulous.

I've made this recipe numerous times and it's always a hit. You can never have too much sauce -- I've used the leftover sauce on ice cream and even on pork chops.

Rating: 4
These are appealing to the palate as well as the eyes! Did not use the cardamom and it was still a great dish! The sauce is excellent although I prefer a bit less sugar as it intensifies as it reduces.

Rating: 3
This was really a three and a half star rating. The flavors are incredible and it makes for a very lovely and different dessert. I served it with french vanilla ice cream. All of my guests requested a copy of this recipe which says a lot.I reduced the sauce to three cups but there was still far too much left over. Has any one tried making half the amount of the sauce?

Rating: 3
Delicious and beautiful. We made the recipe as written except that we halved the pears for poaching and added some lemon juice at the end to balance the sweetness. We served the pears (half per person) with vanilla ice cream that melted beautifully into the deep red sauce, and sprigs of lemon thyme, which sparked the flavors in a nice way.

Rating: 4
I made this for a Thanksgiving dessert and it was a great light addition. I topped it with whipped cream mixed with a little sugar and cinnamon, which turned out to be a perfect accompaniment. I left out the cardamom and orange peel (because I didn't have either) and it was delicious. In fact, I'm making it again for a Christmas dinner party tonight!

Rating: 4
This is INCREDIBLE. I've already made it twice. I did have two little problems with it, though (both of which I corrected the second time): poached pears are usually served cold, and I think they're better that way. And more importantly, there is twice as much sauce as needed here; there is really nothing wrong with using a smaller saucepan and half of everything (except pears). The results are the same, and I just don't see anyone using all that leftover sauce for ten or twenty ice-cream sundaes...

Rating: 4
I made this recipe for my bridge group and not one bite was left...I also served bite sized pieces of pears in the left over sauce to a group of people at a wine tasting and everyone loved it. Definitely will make it again...couldn't find the cardamom so had to omit it.

Made this recipe when it first came out in magazine. It has taken me years to hunt it down, findit again. Can't wait to make it this weekend!

Very very yummy. Served it for desert after a red wine marinated (grilled) sirloin on a cold spring night. Sliced them before before serving as one person suggested and it was beautiful. An absolute hit at the "girls night out" dinner party....it was almost as good as the gossip.

Used Bosc pears of which one was a little harder. Cooked the harder one for twice as long and they came out great. For the red wine I used Bogle 2000 Petite Sirah ($8), and served with Bogle 1999 Port.

Rating: 4
Superb and simple! Sliced pear in half before poaching and served 1/2 pear to each guest. That was plenty. Substituted ground cinnamon for stick and used mace instead of cardamom (hey, you work with what's on hand!) Did not have any difficulty cutting pear with spoon, but may slice pear vertically, up to the stem, and then fan slightly for an even prettier appearance next time. And there will be a next time!

Wonderful! I often make poached pears and this recipe is one of the best. I served it with marscapone as one reviewer suggested and it was delicious!

This was wonderful! We have made it twice, and once substituted the ice cream with a dab of mascarpone-it was the better combo I think! This is perfect for a cold winter night!

One of the very best desserts. A big hit, esp. with bottle of LBV port. Concur with opinion that syrup worth saving and having with ice cream. Before serving, probably try cutting pears into bite-sized chunks to avoid using knives while eating the dessert.

Rating: 4
A very delicious and special dessert that is fairly easy to prepare. Recipe says it serves 4, but I got 10-12 servings. (Most people will only want half a pear.) Makes using an entire of bottle of wine much more economical. A truly wonderful sauce. A great winter dessert. Add mint sprigs for more color.

This recipe was both visually stunning and absolutely delicious! I served it with 2 desert wines, both Muscat based. A Bonny Doon Desert Muscat and of course a Beaumes de Venise Muscat. When lieing on your death bed and knowing you have experienced this combination you know you have lived your life well!
