I made it on white Peru beans and loved it. Great flavours and texture. labour minimal.

Don't leave out the Ouzo or the dill (and I am not even a big fan of dill), they totally make the recipe. Also, I added extra crushed red pepper because we like it spicy.

Pretty good. I really like the flavor combinations. The lima beans I used were still overly toothy when I was done, but I think this was due to the beans not being very fresh or an execution error (although I can't think of what that would be). Subbed Pernod for the ouzo, and used chives because the market was out of dill. I realized once I started pouring in the Pernod, however, that I should have used fennel fronds to complement the anise flavor from the booze. Maybe next time.

Yum! I used one red onion and 6 cloves of garlic. Didn't want to buy ouzo, so I added about a half of teaspoon of fennel seeds to the onion and garlic. I used dried large lima beans. The family didn't want octopus, so we ate them over brown rice with crusty bread and cucumbers on the side. We added a little shaved parmesan on top. Really tasty!
