In an answer to- Skim? Tried to sub skim milk and evaporated skim & lemon juice to avoid a trip to the store, looking at a Food Network recipe as well. Something went wrong - slight beige tone from the evaporated milk, drier that I would have liked. Will try again as recommended by epicurious.

This recipe turned out fine, but the flavor in this other recipe for 'rich ricotta' (http://goo.gl/VZztE) was much bolder and more satisfying. If you're just going to make one, I recommend starting with the rich ricotta.

Has anyone tried this with skim milk?

A wonderful recipe. I appreciated the specific instructions for temperature and curdling. The reviewers are right about not squeezing out too much liquid. This turned out great, I did not salt it very heavily--wonderful, fresh flavor.

I registered with this site just so I could review this recipe. It is delicious and so easy! I decided to try it after reading the label on the only two brands of ricotta available at my local groceries--there are all kinds of fillers and unpronouncable things in there. This is tastier, healthier, and a little bit cheaper than buying premade. I've kept the whey and will try using it to make oatmeal or cream of wheat. Any other ideas on what to do with it would be welcome.

Excellent ricotta. easier and quicker than other recipes. Don't drain much, it does get too firm. Michigan cook

This was so easy to make, I don't even own a thermometer and it still worked. It's so good, light and will be something I make frequently.

Easy to make and a big hit with my Easter dinner guests. I made this to go with the rhubarb crostini. Don't be too agressive with squeezing out the liquid; it does become dry.
