Super supper! I can't believe that I didn't leave a review after I first made this, sometime over a year ago. I then followed the recipe pretty much to the letter, but this time I made half a recipe for the fillings, and didn't bother with processing the sausage, just to save on washing up. If you don't already know, it's worth refrigerating or even freezing the dough after it's been rolled and shaped. For an extra flaky and crispy crust, a flash freeze after assembly helps too. You only need the crust to get cold, so don't leave it too long.

I feel confident in writing a review now as I have done this pie two ways. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and my husband and I really enjoyed the results. I make pie crust all the time, and didn't really have a problem working with the dough (although I did have to use 9 tbsp cold water instead of 6). The sage in the crust was really amazing (and cheese is always good). The second time I made it was for Christmas dinner; I wanted to make a vegetarian main dish for my sister, so instead of using pork I used mushrooms. Everything else was exactly the same. I am a little heavy handed with the spices, but I was the first time as well. I used three pounds of mushrooms (mix of baby bellas and buttons) and chopped them finely. I had to saute them in batches until the water was mostly evaporated (this was time consuming) and I skipped the step with the food processor because I figured that would turn them into paste. Mixed them with the breadcrumbs in a large bowl, and then put them in just like the pork, layered the apples on top, and baked the same amount of time. It was a hit, even with the meat-eaters at the table!

One of the most popular things I've made this year. I loved the crust in particular, and my husband was a big fan of the pork-and-apple combination. I did double the spices, as per other reviewers, and added a little extra sage to the crust.

Wonderful recipe! I changed it up a bit and used the apples to make a chutney instead of including them with the pork, but the basic pie itself, along with the crust, was delicious. Would definitely make this again.

I would have given minus forks to this one. I don't know where I went wrong, but the results were inedible. I followed the recipe to t, but after a few bites, the whole pie went in the trash. Thank God i didn't make for company. the dough was the hardest i ever worked with, and the filling simply didn't go together IMO.

Wow! I just finished making this recipe into little hand pies. Flavor is amazing and the crust is a really exceptional savory pastry crust. Think I used a bit of extra cheese in it (never hurt anyone...) but left the filling as written. Ratio of crust to filling was off a bit, at least for hand pies, but I'll just make another half batch of dough to finish it off and freeze them :) Definitely will be making this again!

Amazing. Will make again.

This was delicious. I have a "more-is- more" philosophy so I doubled the spices. I did double the sage in the crust added a touch more cheese, and doubled the spices in the pork meat. I did the crust as the recipe described (top and bottom) and I also put the filling in the food processor. I liked the consistency with the food processor and it went very well with the apples. I processed it so that some pieces were heartier. The double crust was beautiful and overall what made this dish 4 forks was that it did look impressive.

An excellent recipe and lovely combination of flavors. The crust is really nice. I made the crust as described, but only 1/2. I split that up into six balls and made individual hand held pies. I made 1/2 the filling, using leeks instead of an onion, with the same amt of spices the recipe called for (so they were doubled) and added 1/2 tsp of red chili flakes, and some garlic powder. I also didn't use a food processor for the meat (agree that sandy meat wouldn't have an appetizing texture) and used a potato masher to break the meat down to the right size texture. I have just enough filling and apples left over for a dang quesadilla tomorrow. Am headed to a Super Bowl party and know these are going to be a hit! They look great, and taste even better. Thanks Epicurious, for coming through again.

Made half the filling. Didn't bother putting the meat filling in the food processor either. If I was to make this recipe again, I would double the proportion of spices for more flavour. Also used Gala apples as they were what I could get my hands on - worked just fine. The crust is outstanding! Will make again for sure.

I am not rating this dish this time because I had to make changes. I did make the filling but didn't make the pastry from scratch--I used a purchased pie bottom and used leftover puff pastry for the top but I did add cheddar and sage to the puff pastry so it gave the same combination of flavors. My partner was somewhat dubious at first but after one bite loved it and how the flavors worked together--said it was the best pie he had ever had and ate a second piece--high praise indeed

After spending a month in England on a business trip, and not finding meat pie all that appetizing, I was wary about trying this recipe. I was intrigued by the pork and apple combo though. SInce I am a working Mom with a 2-yr old I don't have the time to make crust, so went with a store-bought crust then combined the sage and cheddar and split half under the crust and half on top. This was suprisingly good, and my husband who usually likes everything grossly salted even liked it. Very much a comfort food recipe and definitely a keeper.

Oh, i used all the pork and little more then half the apples, they would have never have fit my deep dish 10"pan

This is delicious, I have far from perfected the art of pie crust making but this came out very well, a little hard to work with but came out well. I used half lard with the butter this could have had something to do with it. I added some chipotle chile powder to the pork as i thought it was a little bland and used more bread crumbs(home made sourdough) to absorb the juices from the pork. Can't wait for lunch tomorrow.

Having read reviews about a lot of filling and not wanting to make 2 pies, I used 1 lb. of ground pork and the called-for amount of spices and apples - delicious! Added chili paste and mustard to pork and brown sugar last, as suggested. Agree too that the extra crust made great bread sticks.

wonderful, tasty and perfect for Fall. Followed the recipe exactly, using Granny Smith and Braeburn apples. As another reviewer noted, makes WAY too much filling for a standard, or even deep dish pie pan. It's enough for 2 pies, so either double your pie crust or half the filling. This takes a lot longer to make than the recipe suggess (unless of course someone else has already prepared your apples, cheese and onion!). And read the entire recipe to see that "rest time" after it comes out of the oven. We were too hungry to wait so we just cut into it - no problem. The crust is particularly good.

I've just made this for the second time (first time exactly as per recipe,) this time using Bramley (cooking) apples from the garden. I didn't cook them first as I thought they would break down too much. It was AWESOME! The Bramley apples made a delicious pie into a spectacular one. The texture and slight tartness of the apples was perfect. I just sliced them over the meat and dotted with butter before putting on the top crust. Definitely will make again with Bramleys.

Wonderful. I did not put the pork in the food processor; the description of "coarse sand" seemed very unappetizing. Otherwise, made according to the recipe. I did, however, cook the apples & the pork the night before. Brought them up to room temperature while crust was in the refrigerator.

To cut calories (and I don't have much luck with pie-crust) I used a puff pastry top. I followed the instructions for the filling and then used the puff pastry directions. It was delicious!

This makes a really impressive presentation and would be great for a buffet. There is a LOT of filling, way to much for a pie dish, so I put it in a 10" springform pan and that worked out great. I adjusted the recipe's technique a bit, making the dough in my food processor and cooking the apples in the oven, on two cookie sheets covered in non-stick foil. I had a feeling that they would otherwise make a sticky mess in the pan. That was probably true, as their sugars melted a bit and did their best to stick to the foil. Another thing I did differently was wait until the meat was cooked before I added the brown sugar. My reasoning was the same; cooking the brown sugar would have made a needless mess in the pan. Lastly, although this turned out great, the dough was one of the hardest I've ever worked with, and I make lots of pies. It tore like crazy, and I wound up having to piece it a lot. Even so, it didn't leak and came out looking (and tasting) fabulous.

If you have any dough left over cut it into sticks and bake it....perfect cheese breadsticks!

Delicious crust! I found the pork filling a bit bland so I added chili paste, molasses and mustard powder to the second pie. I also added grated lemon zest to the apples to give them some pep. A big hit with the guys!
