The swiss cheese is not really great with the mustard, cheddar would be better. They aren't as crispy as I expected. Just ok.

Crackers were a bit greasy in the end, I don't know if the fact that I used cheddar had anything to do with that. Either way I really liked the way that the strong flavors of the cheddar and mustard played off each other.

Although we are mustard lovers, these were just a little too heavy on the mustard side for my boyfriend and I. If I were to make it again, I would probably use about half of each mustard ingredient. Mustard aside, the swiss cheese cracker mixture is really good and I would like to experiment more with it.
