I really like this soup. I have only eaten it cold or room temperature, but I think it would also be good warm. I'd also like to try making it with the addition of cannelinni beans; I think that would add a nice texture and density that isn't otherwise there.

I made this for my aunt when she was sick and a few other people in my family and they loved it! None of us really like cold soup but we tried it and didn't like it that much so we warmed it up and it was D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S. I would recommend this if you have a sick friend or family member or if your just bored on a snowy day. (Warm of course) :)

Delicious! The goat cheese makes this special. Very pretty for our picnic!

I have made this twice--it's a great late-summer soup when tomatoes are abundant and tasty. I find it a little strong on the vinegar and would cut back a little, and like other reviewers strongly recommend making ahead (more than two hours) to let the flavors blend. I also find that roasting your own peppers rather than using store-bought yields better control of the flavors in the soup, and recommend using double the garlic and basil indicated in the recipe.

Excellent. I served to our guests, not being a real fan of cold soup. I am now a fan of THIS cold soup and my guests loved it too. This is great when you have a garden full of tomatoes and want to have a cold refreshing first course.

Wow! Even my non-raving husband raved! I used a dash of smoky hot chipotle hot sauce - YUM!!!

i bought all the ingredients without reading that it was a cold soup. i decided to make it and heated it anyway and it still tasted good. it was a bit too tart for me to eat on its own, but it makes a nice side dish to a grilled cheese.

We've served this four times over the last six weeks because we have tomatoes from the garden. I added avocados and used chevre cheese (which is all I had at the time) -- both wonderful additions. Makes great leftovers for the following days, so I double the recipe.

Quick, easy and tasty. I let it chill overnight so the flavors would be more robust. Great dinner for those hot summer nights when you just can't face turning on the oven.

This is the perfect soup to make when the farmer's market has gorgeous, plump tomatoes and peppers. Loved the goat cheese and used a bit more than a garnish!

I'm not usually one for cold soups but this was super easy to make and tasted fantastic! I added more garlic and only put in a tsp. of horseradish since I'm not that crazy about very spicy food and it still turned out great! I will always keep this recipe handy for summer.This soup is very refreshing.

Made this with tomatoes from the Green City Market I bought this morning. Used Trader Joe's low sodium Graden Patch juice and it was absolutely delish! A real summer keeper!

I've made this soup several times this summer and it's always everyone's favorite course. I add more garlic than the recipe calls for, but that's always true for me.

I also used vegetable juice (low salt) because it was what I had on hand. Excellent flavor and really easy to make, it was a great use for some of my summer tomato bounty.

Just made this for a gourmet dinner party. Only change I made was I used V8 juice instead of Tomatoe juice. I put it in the blender for a quick pulse just so it was a little smoother in texture before chilling. Very nice flavors.

I made this as a first course and everyone loved it. The only change was that I added some chopped onion and I broke up the goat cheese and sprinkled over the top. Everyone said they loved the tomato and goat cheese combination. Very easy and quick.

Really easy and flavorful! I was concerned that the horseradish taste would be overpowering, so I added some basil and parsley before putting it in the fridge, but after chilling, the flavours blended nicely. This would probably work better for a soup course or as a side dish, since the spices are so strong that a little goes a long way.

I normally roll right past gazpacho-esque recipes. However, it was hot out and I was looking for something quick and refreshing to prepare for dinner. I made this recipe exactly as directed, and it was indeed refreshing, and also delicious.
