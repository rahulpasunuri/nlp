This is good and not too difficult to make. I really like the dressing, but I did cut the salt in half based on comments from other reviewers. Half is plenty. I think I will toss the goat cheese and pecans with the dressing next time.

I really enjoyed this salad; I made it for Thanksgiving dinner. It seemed like everyone liked it, but no one commented on it much like in the other ratings. The only thing I might change about it is to make the dressing a tad more sweet. Perhaps it was the type of olive oil I used, but it tasted too oily to me. Other than that, delicious and recommended! :)

I never would have thought such a simple recipe would be so tasty! I had to substitute fairly heavily based on what was in my cupboard (whole-grain mustard instead of dijon, blue cheese instead of goat cheese, and almond brittle instead of nuts) and it was still absolutely delicious - it even upstaged the cheese-stuffed pumpkin I made for the main course, and everyone asked for seconds as well as the recipe.

Lord have mercy, this was good salad! I took a reviewer's advice and made the Sweet and Spicy Candied Pecans to go in the salad. It was so easy and so delicious and impressive! Best. Salad. Ever.

I made this for my family Thanksgiving last year, and because it was such a hit, reluctantly repeated it this year. (I hate to serve the same thing twice to the same crowd) I'm glad I did! Everyone (including all the kids) remembered it from last year and said how happy they were to see it again! Not a spec left on the salad plates! I do add a dash or two of balsamic to the dressing and put it all in a blender adding the thyme at the very end for only a pulse or two.

I enjoy this salad immensely and make it frequently. The last time I made it, I substituted Balsamic Vinegar for the Red Wine Vinegar. It gave it a nicer less tart flavor. Also, instead of buying candied pecans, I made the Sweet and Spicy Candied Pecans recipe from this site. Easy and Delish!

This was delicious the first time, but then I made a few changes..somebody always does!:-) First I mix a combination of glazed pecans or walnuts, dried cranberries and a chopped/diced Comice Pear. Sprinkle with what I have found to be lite and delicious..Ken's Lite Walnut & Raspberry Viniagrette! Then I add my baby greens (I always use the Organic Baby Greens in a container; yummy and seem to last longer than bagged.) Add a bit more dressing, toss and top with Danish Bleu Cheese! I eat it about 4 times/week for dinner!! It's GREAT and healthy! Especially when I'm in the mood to glaze my own pecans or walnuts with honey. YUMMY

This salad is unreal. I was a bit curious about all the flavors blending but, man, DO THEY! Used feta cheese. The dressing I pour on everything from my everday salad to my turkey burgers. Great stuff.

This was an easy, quick and flavorful salad. The flavors meld together wonderfully. I used green onions instead of red onion, only because it is a personal preferrence. It was colorful and made a great presentation. This will be going into my keeper file.

I have made this salad countless times and it never fails to impress! I omit the onion (personal preference), and use fresh rosemary instead of thyme.

Beautiful winter salad. I added some beets and they worked nicely. I didn't use the full amount of dressing - it would have been swimming in it if I had! Maybe decrease the oil to 1/2 cup.

Great salad that offers so many flavours and textures. I would lighten up on the vinegar, I found it to be a bit too strong but that is a personal preference. I used plain nuts and they were just as good - and lower in sugar :)

I made this salad for two separate occasions this weekend and got raves both times. I used regular pecans, not glazed, and only made half the amount of dressing. It is so easy and so good. Even the kids at these dinners loved the salad!

I love this salad, but my family does not (alas). The first time I followed the recipe exactly (except I used 1/2 cup of olive oil instead of the recommended 3/4) and it seemed too sweet with the full amount of cranberries and glazed walnuts. Next time, I will double the amount of greens, using 2 bags of baby mixed greens, and 2 bags of baby spinach.

Can something be rated 5+ forks? This is the new standard go-to salad at my house. We probably eat it at least twice a week on average. I buy the Emerald Brand glazed walnuts and sometimes just use a plain old purchased vidalia onion dressing. Pretty enough to serve to guests and easy enough to whip up after a long day at work. Love it!

I have made this salad about six times, and with each try I have added another ingredient, or amended it in some way. Nothing drastic, perhaps roasted cashews instead of pecans, or added rosemary to the dressing instead of thyme, or changed the vinegar to a white instead of red. Each time I am met with "Is there any more salad left?" Guests LOVE it and everyone asks for the recipe. This is a WINNER! So delicious and adaptable.

Excellent for Thanksgiving dinner. You may not want to use all the dressing, we used half and it was more than enough.

Happy Thanksgiving 2005. Combined this recipe with Goat Chesse Salad with Pancetta, Dried Cherry and Port Dressing. I simmered the cranberries in port, used bacon and followed the recipe for sweet and spicy candied pecans for the nuts. Outstanding results, enjoyed by all.

I made this salad for our company Thanksgiving luncheon and it was outragiously gorgeous and delicious! I went back to get more and there was nothing left! I used Maytag blue Cheese instead of the goat cheese, honey roasted pecans and extra dried cranberries. The fresh thyme makes this salad spectacular. I tossed the dressing in just a few minutes before serving. I will keep this in my favorite recipe file. Simple to make yet tastes complicated because of the unique combination of flavor contrasts and textures. If you're looking for a simple, quick and elegant salad, this is it!

As far as salads go, and I make a lot of them, this was great! It was very simple and the flavours all worked together very well. I candied the pecans in the oven with maple syrup and brown sugar, 375 degrees for about 8 mins and it added just the right touch of sweetness.

This is a terrific recipe!! I've made this salad for several family occasions, potlucks, etc. and I get many requests to make it again for the next shindig or requests for the recipe itself. Some people may not like the red onions, but that's a personal preference ... I personally think the recipe is perfect as-is.

This is one of my favorite salads. I also add sliced pears or sliced apples. I normally use spinach instead of the mixed greens. Dried blueberries are also fantastic (in addition to or instead of the cranberries).

Mercy Maude! This is one of the best salads I've ever eaten, and I am particular about my salads. People literally rolled their eyes with pleasure, and fought to get the last few leaves. The only change I made - based on earlier reviews - was to cut the onion substantially. A truly outstandng "keeper."

I rarely give four forks, and it seems silly to do so for a salad, but truly it was so delicious and such a hit! I didn't use all the dressing, since I prefer my salad underdressed. I also used dried cherries instead of cranberries (it was what I had on hand) and glazed walnuts instead of pecans. I can't wait to make it again!

Ive made this dish a few times first time I tried it I followed the recipie verbatim. Then after that I felt comfortable enough to add little extras like grape tomatoes, diced pears, and I found feta cheese in place of goat easier to work with for bigger parties.I also accidently used fresh sage instead of fresh thyme came out just as good. A wonderful recipie.

This is a great recipe. The candied nuts and cranberries add a nice texture and sweetness to the salad. Just don't add the dressing too early if you're going to toss the salad and dressing together. The mixed greens wilt quickly and the whole salad will get mushy. I recommend that you serve the dressing on the side or wait until the last possible moment to mix the dressing into the salad. The goat cheese can also get mushy if it gets tossed around too much so add that last.

I had this at a friend's and had to have the recipe. I made it two weeks later for some out of town company and everyone of them asked for the recipe. I didn't have time to make the sugared nuts and couldn't find any in the store so used Poppy Cock "Just Nuts" and they all loved it! This will become a regular at my house with grilled chicken sliced on top for a meal!

I made this salad for Thanksgiving, and I received such an outstanding reaction that I am making it again for my husband's birthday, next weekend. I also used the candied pecan recipe that was suggested, which was fun and easy. My grocery store is always out of thyme, but the dressing tasted fine without it. There are already such a great mix of flavors in the salad.

This salad had a great balance of flavors and great presentation with the red from the dried cranberries, green from lettuce, and white from the goat cheese. Makes a great holiday salad. I've made it several times for guests and everyone asks for the recipe. The dressing recipe makes more dressing than what is needed, so be careful not to add the entire amount of dressing.

I liked this combo of ingredients and my dinner guests enjoyed it as well. Have to say that I substituted the goat cheese with Stilton, but otherwise followed the recipe. The dijon dressing was not a misfit at all, infact it really balanced the sweetness of the candied pecans and dried cranberries. This salad is a great accent to any fall menu.

This salad seemed to be all over the place and nowhere all at the same time. The intense sweetness of the cranberries (ick), the candied crunchiness of the pecans (used the candied walnuts recipe on this site); the smooth texture of the cheese and the incredible disappearing dijon in the dressing -- it didn't really come together at all. There are lots better salad recipes on this site than this one.

Oh, my God, this was good! I used the candied pecans from the SPINACH SALAD WITH MANGO AND CANDIED PECANS recipe (also on this site).

Salad was delicious--made it twice in one week! We had to substitute honey roasted peanuts and dried thyme the first time and preferred it over the honey roasted pecans that we used the second time. Apply the dressing just prior to serving, because the greens wilt quickly. We only got eight servings out of the recipe.
