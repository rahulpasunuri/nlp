Made this for a party Saturday night, so I actually made it several days ahead and let it mellow. I used veggie broth instead of beef, since I've got a vegan in the crowd. It may have made it a little lighter, but following another reviewer's comments, I added horseradish for zip. Everyone loved it, perhaps because my croutons were from brioche bread. Mixed gruyere with the parmesan. Sadly, no leftovers.

Great onion soup recipe. I omitted the sugar as the carmelized onions are sweet enough. Used Tiger Beer and also added a T of horseradish. Delish!!

Yummy and keeps for a while in the fridge. I encrusted french bread with parmesean cheese, which added a nice touch to crutons. I also used Guinness.

Just like the cook from Wash, DC, I used Guinness Stout. I will definately make this soup again. As for the croutons, I used sourdough which I sauteed in equal 1 Tbsp of butter & 1 Tbsp. olive oil, then I toasted them in the toaster oven. Before serving the soup, I covered the bowls with some Gruyere and placed in the broiler for a few minutes. Served piping hot with the croutons and freshly grated parm/romano... this soup was soooooo good! not too sweet like French Onion soup.

Delicious! Got rave reviews from the family - some said it was better than what you get at a fancy restaurant! I used my own homemade croutons and yes, Old Milwaukee! To top it off I heaped on the Mozzarella and Havarti - yummy!

I used Guinness draught - even though the recipe did not call for dark beer. The onions and garlic were sweet enough that I thought additional sugar was unnecessary. Lastly, I added Gruyere cheese to the parmesan for a more traditional onion soup. The results came out fantastic!

I found this soup to be pretty good, but not amazing. Perhaps I did not add enough sugar to it (only 1 tablespoon), but it ended up tasting bitter and I used a pale ale (Magic Hat - Fat Angel). Also, I substituted 3-4 shallots for a couple of the onions. With parmesan cheese and croutons, it was pretty tasty, but I was not crazy about it. Maybe I will be truer to the recipe next time...

Not bad. I made this last night and had it for lunch...it's great after a night in the fridge when the flavors had chance to sit with each other. I used 8 onions instead of 10 and a light pilsner beer (Iron City from good old Pittsburgh). I'd suggest cutting the sugar to taste and using a full bodied beer like a lager. I did not make the croutons.

Eassy to make and fun to eat, specially the next day. Add a pound of thinly sliced scallions too, and substitute sourdough for the rye for a delightful repast. Pour Samuel Smiths Pale Ale or Anchor Steam for the perfect accompaniment. Buen provecho!
