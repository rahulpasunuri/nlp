Really good texture, and really easy to make. I needed around 2 cups of cream, and maybe next time will add a little more sugar. Using a juice glass to cut the dough, I got around 2 dozen nice size biscuits.

I really liked this recipe. Super easy and biscuits were very tasty. Just like the other reviewer, I needed much more cream. I also did not roll mine out (was in a hurry) and just formed them into uniform balls with my hands. While not super perfect looking, I will still serve them to company.

This is an excellent biscuit recipe! I had to cobble together ingredients because I didn't have any cream on hand. I used 1/2 c. yogurt, 1/2 c. 2% milk, 1/2 c. buttermilk. The result was a flaky biscuit with a crisp bottom that worked perfectly with the beef stew I made.

Easy to make and great tasting biscuits, but I found that the recipe needed a lot more than 1 1/2 cups of cream. I used a 2.5" cutter, and got many more than 12 biscuits.
