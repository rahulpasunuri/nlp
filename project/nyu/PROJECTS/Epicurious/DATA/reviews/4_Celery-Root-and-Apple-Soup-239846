One of the best soups I've had a in a long time! I made this vegetarian by substituting Imagine's No-Chicken broth for the chicken broth and omitting the panchetta-- and it was still really really tasty. It reminded me of butternut squash soup, but with a lighter, fresher taste.

I make this recipe OFTEN. I use vegetable stock, oil instead of butter and omit the pancetta due to my dietary choices, and it gets rave reviews from guests. Sometimes I use pears instead of apples. The chive oil drizzle is the key ingredient, especially when omitting the others. If you like to cook seasonally it is great in the fall. I often freeze for winter consumption.

I thought this was delicious! I used scallions instead of chives and the oil turned out great. I also threw in a potato. Great combination when you have all of the elements.

Definite keeper! The wife loved it. I used regular bacon, and instead of chives I used "onion weed" from my yard. Worked great! The recipe doesn't make that much...if you're cooking for more than three people you might want to double it.

surprising and tasty! We could very much taste the apple and the celery and together it creates a zingy fresh taste that was completely unexpected! I guess I may by celery again

So good! Just be sure to taste for salt as you are blending.

I've made this 3 times and every time, I receive rave reviews. I use low sodium vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and have never been disappointed. When you serve, be sure to put chive oil and pancetta on the top- they are really key as they offset some of the sweetness of the apples and add some necessary saltiness.

I have made this recipe so many times, now. sometimes i freeze it to have in the winter. i don't use the bacon and replace butter with oil to make it vegan. the chive oil is essential. enjoy!

Admittedly, I did not follow the recipe exactly (I don't eat ham), but I will not be making it again. In fact, I dread the idea of cooking with celery root again! Maybe because celery root isn't in prime season now, but I found it impossible to cut all the woody parts off and to peel the celery root down. It was extremely difficult to cut up, but I thought I'd gotten it down to the useable bits. Wrong. After pureeing and serving, in every single spoonful, I had to pick out splinters of celery root woody bits. I couldn't even make it through a small bowl, I had to discard it and throw all of the soup away (there's no way I would serve what my soup turned out like to anyone). :( Probably more my own "user error" than a bad recipe, of course, but I won't be making this again and wanted to warn other "novices" out there that this soup is difficult.

The soup on its own was ok but the chive oil drizzled on top really gave it a nice flavor especially when combined with the bacon (I did not have panzetta.) When I ran out of bacon, sprinkling with salt was a good substitute. Frankly, the soup was better the second day. I only had one concern and I did not see anyone else mention this - when I pureed the chives, salt and grapeseed oil, the chive solids sort of congealed and separated from the oil and could not be mixed back in - Is that supposed to happen? I just drizzled the clear portion of the chive oil on top of the soup and it looked and tasted fine, especially the second day after the oil took on more of the chive flavor. It seemed fine but in reading the recipe, I had expected more of an oil with a pesto consistency but it was not like that.

Very delicious! Don't forget the chive oil and pancetta! I added a handful of sage leaves to the broth before you puree :)

The BEST soup ever. Also inexpensive to make. It's amazing that this rather unfamiliar and ugly looking root vegetable can make a soup that is so delicious. Don't think twice, make it for all your friends and family. They will LOVE it. Don't skip chive oil and pancetta!

I made this today and can't wait to serve it to guests tonight. I used 2 cups of apple cider and 2 cups of chicken stock; also 1 cup of fennel.It really is delicious. It is so nice to have a healthy soup on these cold winter nights.

Want to taste this as the exceptional, 4-fork soup it's been reviewed as? Make it as it's been written! :) My husband and I just made this together on a blustery fall Sunday afternoon in Portland, and it was divine. The pancetta, chive oil, and hearty vegetables combine together for what I keep calling "Thanksgiving stuffing in a bowl." We made no alterations to the recipe, served it with a baguette and some dry white wine, and are still swooning. **Pay attention when the recipe says "or more" on the amount of chicken broth. Even with just 4 cups of broth, the soup will just be heartier.

Very unusual ingredients and a great surprise as a result! This was my first time eating celeriac and I am very happy with it!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was very well received. I used pears instead of apples, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Yummo!

This was delicious! The only thing I changed was, I added a parsnip and an extra apple. It was wonderful and I definitely recommend the pancetta and the chive oil. The drizzled chive oil on top of the soup made for an excellent presentation. Made it with sundried tomato buns (from this site)!

I didn't use the pancetta, but instead used wild boar bacon & crown butter sauteed for the fat. Used a mix of stocks I had in the freezer. No chive oil (used fig vincotto I had it) & added piment d'espelette-All the flavors came through clearly, had excellent balance.

Unfortunately I didn't have chives or pancetta, so I wasn't able to add them to the soup. I cut an entire celery root along with about 4 parsnips, 1 very large apple, and half a very large red onion. These were cooked as directed before adding the 4 cups of chicken broth. Instead of pureeing the soup, I left it chunky and it was delicious.

This was really good, especially with the chive oil and extra pancetta. I'll make this again.

Oddly good soup. I made exactly as instructed. Definately make the chive oil and use the pancetta. Next time I'll make double the pancetta. A great dish to make ahead.

SO GOOD! and easy to make. It's good without the chive oil and pancetta, but I strongly recommend including them because it just makes the soup taste that much better and it looks nice with the garnish on top.

On its own, this recipe is rather bland. With a little doctoring, though, it was delicious and got rave reviews. I added about 3/4 c of buttermilk, blended some of the chives and grapeseed oil into the soup and added a few generous shakes of cayenne pepper.

I used olive oil instead of butter, shallots instead of onions, veg broth and skipped the decor. Peeling and chopping apart, this is very easy to prepare and it's edible but I won't make it again.

I'd never eaten celery root before, but it was recently available at our new food co-op, so I purchased it and went to epicurious.com to find ways to use it. What a great introduction to a new food! The soup was great! I had to substitute bacon for the pancetta and since I didn't have chives in my garden this time of year, I used the green tops of scallions. It turned out wonderfully.

This was a most interesting mélange of flavors. It was delicious and I will surely make it again. Don't omit the pancetta or the chive oil, they all belong together.

In my family I have become known for the tasty and unusual soups I prepare, so after careful consideration and research I decided to give this recipe a try for Christmas this year. I made a double batch---one for a Christmas Eve dinner party and the other for a Christmas dinner party. At the first party the folks decided that this soup had gone to the top of their favorites list. At the second party, several of the folks confessed that they had been skeptical when they had heard that the soup was going to taste like celery, but even the most finicky of eaters proclaimed that it was REALLY good. Everyone liked the festive way that it looked with the GREEN chive oil and RED-looking, confetti- like pancetta and prosciutto floating on top (I purchased 4 oz of pancetta and 4 oz of prosciutto in a small dice). I'm sure the soup would be just fine with just pancetta in the amount specified; however, I would highly recommend adding a bit more because many of the folks commented on how they enjoyed the crunchy texture with the creamy soup. Also, I made the chive grapeseed oil ahead and refrigerated it and there was no problem. ENJOY!!!

I am responding to my friend, Deborah's review. I have made this soup for three dinner parties to rave reviews. I made a slight change and added a little buttermilk for tang as well as Tabasco for "zip". It is a great winter soup.

My friend Pam, the kitchen wizard, made this for Thanksgiving. All loved it, including two teenage boys. Highest kudos to her and this fab soup. It will be a staple in my kitchen. Deborah

Fabulous! I made a double batch and had my girlfriend and her three kids over (ages 12, 14 and 17) three days later and even the finicky 12 year old liked it. The pancetta is a must as the salty crunchiness is a great with the creamy smoothness of the celery root/apple puree. The chive oil is also a great compliment and also add the visual 'oomph!'. Easy to make and keeps for days

I found this exceptional. I've made it twice -- once with celery root and pancetta, and once in a location without, so I substituted plain, old celery and bacon. It comes out with the same flavor, but the texture is a little grainy with the celery. The flavor of the soup is fantastic, and the chive oil and pancetta compliment it perfectly.

I served this to my family today. It got rave reviews. The crunchy pancetta is a perfect foil for the smooth, slightly sweet soup. Next time, I may use regular bacon.

I make a version of this with just celery root, apples and onions and it is quick and delicious and LOW CALORIE, but feels very hearty. So, I will try this jazzed up version cuz I love chives and pancetta, but if you want simple, hearty, quick and low cal - go for it.

A Cook from Frisco, TX on 09/08/07 This soup is fantastic. The flavor work so well together and it is soooo easy to prepare. I used a submersible blender rather than the food processor and that made it even easier. The celery and apple has to cook longer than it says. Do NOT leave out the pancetta.
