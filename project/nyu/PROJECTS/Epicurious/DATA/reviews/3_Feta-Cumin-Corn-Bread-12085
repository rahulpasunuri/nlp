This turned out dry, without much flavor from the cumin, feta, or scallion. Not worthwhile.

I've made this cornbread repeatedly since 1993, usually as part of the summertime menu in the original article: also with "eggplant spread" (fantastic with this cornbread), plus the "white bean-vegetable salad", but made with canned cannellini beans. Very southern European and wonderful. My old xeroxed copy in my cooking binder is falling to bits and splashed with this and that, so well-loved. I also make the cornbread from The Greens Cookbook, but I serve that one with black bean chili or with black-eyed peas and greens, if that helps you see where this one fits in the line-up: good for accompanying Greek/European dishes, rather than the more usual southern USA menu.

Yum! This bread is full flavored. If you like the earthy, rustic cumin flavor, you will like this bread!! I used freshly ground cumin and substituted Pepper Jack for the Feta Cheese. That added some nice specks of red color as well as flavor. I will make this again to serve with spicy grilled meats and veggies. This bread could overpower a mildly flavored main course!

This became a staple while I was in law school and I'm so happy to find the recipe again. I love the mix of flavors which compliment each other, and I love the contrasting texture of the scallion and crumbled feta in the corn bread. It's easy and packs a flavor punch for entertaining that makes it less boring than your run- of-the-mill cornbread.

This is an awesome recipe. Since 1993 I have being doing it for my formal dinners and my guests really love it. I always serve it with grilled shrimps.

I really liked the sound of this cornbread, but the results were a little dissappointing. The cumin flavour wasn't very pronounced and the feta just didn't seem to work very well with the other flavours.

Not your average cornbread! Delicious. This is quite rich and could be a lunch itself. I used to make this alot and it was a pleasant surprise to find the recipe again. I believe a creamier Feta (maybe French?) worked better.
