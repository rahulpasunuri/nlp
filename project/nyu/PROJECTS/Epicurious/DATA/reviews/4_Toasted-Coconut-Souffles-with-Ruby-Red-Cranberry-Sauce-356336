This was my first time making souffles. They turned out well and tasted good (not too sweet). I added Cointreau to the sauce and also left the cranberries in (didn't strain) so there was more of a fruit compote sauce. I didn't have any coconut extract so I used the juice from a real coconut. There is also no "wet" sweetened coconut available here, only tiny dry shavings so I added extra coconut juice to compensate. Overall, this recipe makes a great visual impression but for taste would rather try something different next time.

A perfect light dessert! This recipe is fantastic exactly as written. I favor lighter, less sweet desserts, and so I'm always happy to find something that fits in this category while still being delicious. I'd happily serve this any time of year, especially if the meal was on the heavy side...like with steak or red meat. These would offer some sweetness without everyone feeling like they were about to die, ha. The coconut flavor was subtle, which we all liked, but some might want to amp up the extract. Otherwise, this is a great soufflé to have in one's repertoire.

I added a tiny sprinkle of sea salt on top and it made all the difference.

This was just delicious! It's soft and sweet and airy and just perfect. I did change a few things: realized halfway through that I was out of sugar, so I used brown sugar, and since cranberries aren't in season right now, I used raspberries. A definite repeat!

I served these desserts Christmas Eve and was happy with the result, though I think the recipe still needs some tweaking. I ended up baking the souffles about 4 minutes longer, and they were still a little runny in the middle. I also only got 6 servings instead of 8, but maybe this was because my eggs were smaller or something? All in all, a great do-ahead-but-fancy dessert. And a fun, light treat for the holidays.

My first time making souffle and it worked and it tasted fenomenal. My father in law broke his no sugar diet for this dessert...what more can I say?
