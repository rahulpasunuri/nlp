This was great. I'd advise using the kari leaves if at all possible  they impart a subtly nutty but piquant flavor that deepens the dish. (You can get them fresh at Patel Brothers in Jackson Heights, N.Y.  and probably at other Patel Brothers stores around the country  and I would imagine that Kalustyan's in Manhattan has them, too.) Overall, I made few modifications, but for the fact of using 1 1/4 pounds of medium shrimp (which were all I had) while keeping all the other measurements the same; using vindaloo curry powder for the curry called for (vindaloo was all I had) and adding slightly more coconut milk to compensate for the extra heat (it did not come out too hot); serving it over a bed of fresh spinach instead of watercress (which often looks worse for the wear at the market); and forgetting to add the lemon until after I had devoured it all. I am adding this to my short list of go-to shrimp recipes, alongside Vietnamese bún noodle salads, shrimp pozole and shrimp and grits.

Warning The flavor really depends on what type of curry you have. Different curries really change the flavor.

Good, but I didn't love it like I thought I might. Couldn't find curry leaves, even at Whole Foods - not sure how much of an impact that had. I'd give it 2 stars, but dinner guests wolfed it all down, so maybe it's just me.

We love this recipe. I often substitute spinach for the watercress. Best thing about this a yummy, healthy dinner's on the table in under 30 min.

My go-to curry recipe for use with whatever protein I have... usually chicken, which is cheaper.

Very good. Used 2 pounds of shrimp, tripled the spices, and used a full can of coconut milk. Kari leaves aren't in season, so omitted those. Served with basmati rice, and the Vietnamese style broccolini. Quite easy, for very flavorful results!

Good. I used 2 full bags of TJ's shrimp and like other reviewers made more sauce. I didn't use the kari leaves or watercress but instead served it with baby Bok Choy, TJ's harvest grains blend, and Naan bread, which was a good recommendation by another reviewer for soaking up the sauce! This is an easy weeknight recipe that I'll make again.

This was fine for a recipe that takes 5 minutes or so to put together. It would be too much to ask for it to have any of the complexity of the real thing.

An instant favorite, beloved by picky kids and Indian food aficionados alike. If you can't find the kari or the watercress -- make it anyway, it's still good! And so quick -- a great weeknight meal.

Unusual flavors tempt the tastebuds! I tripled the sauce, served the dish over brown rice, alongside garlic naan from Trader Joe's. We were in carb heaven, and our home smelled dreamy. Didn't have kari leaves and skipped watercress, per others' reviews.

Add me to the ppl that tripled and doubled ingredients & made more of a curry than a salad ("Chat"). Substitutions & Omissions: no curry powder, no kari leaves, no tomato paste, no lemon, no watercress. And it still came out awesome ! I just want to inspire anyone out there who like me, just wanted to make it from what they already had. I used 2 tomatoes instead of the paste, which I put into the blender with the coconut milk first to make a frothy cream. Also add shrimps much later, they easily overcook and I made that mistake (still was delicious), it was a no fail! HIghly recommended.

This was delicious. We couldn't find the kari leaves, but it was still excellent. I'll make this again when and if I find the kari leaves. (Actually, I'll make it again regardless.) As other readers have suggested, we doubled everything (except the shrimp) to make it saucier. We served it over basmati rice and had some naan to sop up the sauce. We also made Indian Spiced Cauliflower and Potatoes (from this site). Wonderful meal. I can't wait to make it again.

Scanning the recipe quickly, I misread "kari" leaves for kaffir (lime) leaves. The results were delicious .. though decidedly thai. I would strongly recommend this error but am now looking forward to trying the recipe again with the specified ingredients.

I tripled the spices and the paste and coconut milk. In my "practice" dish I used 1/4 C of half and half and a 1/4 C of water but did not include it in the "party" dish. Either way it is really wonderful. What a hit! I will make this again and again. Served at a New Year's party and got MANY compliments! Serve with rice if you make it saucy.

Very good, although wasn't keen on the watercress. Would definitely serve this with company

Please don't be upset at this cook for revising but A.) I used chicken instead B.) Took several downstream reviewers' advice and doubled coconut milk and tomato paste, tripled spices and added the onion and a few patio tomatoes I had on hand which added some interest and texture. Needless to say Nashville's finest Indian Restaurant will be losing our frequent visits because it and the Baked INdian Rice on this site met the standards of that place and we had enough leftover to have for another dinner! As one cook earlier said, "this is perhaps the best recipe I've ever prepared" or some such. I'm inclined to agree and I, too, cook and try new things often!

Like other cooks I tripled the spices, doubled the coconut milk and tomato paste. I also sauteed some onions and tomatoes for sweetness, texture and flavor before searing the shrimp. I also added some tamarind chutney for more depth. My husband thought it was so much better than Indian takeout.

What a great recipe! I usually do not alter recipes but this time I decided to make it at the last minute and I had to make it work for me with the ingredients I had on hand. I did use the curry powder, the garam masala, the curry leaves, the garlic and the oil... but thats when I made substitutions. I substituted fat free half and half mixed with coconut extract (no! dont faint!), a few chopped canned tomatoes left over from an Italian dish and the rest of the recipe went as written. WOW....it was simply fantastic. Served over rice and I cant wait to try it again.

It was easy to get the Kari leaves, but I suspect this would still be a great recipe without it. Very easy and tasty. I don't like watercress, so my serving was just with rice, but others seemed to enjoy the watercress.

This is one terrific recipe. I subtracted the curry leaves, and added hot pepper flakes, cinnamon, cashews, brown sugar, some half and half, and doubled the sauce and spices. I served it over rice as a main dish. It got rave reviews. This will be a dish I make over and over again.

This was drier than I expected it to be--I thought it would be more shrimp in coconut/curry sauce, but it's actually coconut/curry-flavored shrimp. The result however is extremely flavorful - really spicy and good. (If you've ever had dry-rubbed barbecue, it's kind of like that. Instead of flavor in the sauce, it's rubbed onto the meat itself--less juicy, more spicy.) It's truly the kari leaves that make the dish--they don't taste like curry so much, it's a different, really interesting flavor. It's worth a trip to an Indian market to find them, if possible. If I can find kari leaves again, I'd definitely make this again.

Fantastic! This was one of the best shrimp dishes I've ever made. Couldn't find the curry leaves so I don't know how that would've changed it. Doubled the sauce and used hot madras curry. It was hot enough for me just like that. Served it with Indian-Spiced Cauliflower also on this website (but skipped the potatoes and didn't miss them). My husband has been raving about this dinner all week.

Like the reviewer below, I tripled the curries and doubled the garlic. I used a great Garam Masala from Penzey's and a generic yellow curry. I doubled the coconut milk and tomato paste and added a little water to thin the sauce before adding it to the shrimp. The dish was plenty saucy and spicy this way, and would have been great over rice! This is possibly the best dish I have ever made.. and I cook a lot. It's certainly the best Indian dish I've ever made. Julie Sahini generally has great recipes, but this one takes the cake.

Enjoyed this recipe very much with roasted cauliflower and carrots. Didn't have the kari leaves but will look for them on my next trip to the Indian market. Used 2# of shrimp and tripled the spices and ingredients for the sauce. Used a madras style curry powder that I had bought at an upscale food market. It was very fragrant and flavorful, but for next time I would like it to be spicier. The lemon juice added at the end dramatically changed the taste and IMO was key. Had some fresh cilantro from my garden and although I didn't add it to the entire dish, I did eat a leaf along with my second bite and didn't think that it melded well with the other flavors.

Rating: 4
Quick, easy and delicious! This dish is listed as an appetizer in Julie Sahni's book, but it really seems more like a main dish, in which case you can forget the watercress. Even though it doesn't have a lot of sauce, it goes well with rice, and any vegetable that doesn't have strong spices - green beans or peas or roasted cauliflower would all work well.

Its good. I do not know what to serve it with. Not saucy enough for rice. And I am not sure what else to eat it with. Any suggestions?

This dish was extremely delicious. My husband and my son both loved the dish a lot. I am undoubtedly going to make this dish again even though I modified the recipe by putting 1/2 a bunch of cilantro leaves which added more flavor to this exquisite dish. I also added some clove and pepper powder for more taste. Make sure you add freshly chopped curry leaves.

Didn't have kari leaves, but it was delicious anyway. It would be best to have the tomato paste and coconut milk mixed before you start cooking the shrimp to avoid overcooking.

I made this last night for the second time and loved it just as much. I didn't have the kari leaves, so I don't know how much this would change the recipe. I also served it over rice instead of watercress.

I haven't made it yet, as I don't know what type of "curry powder" to look for. I'm Indian and we don't really use "curry powder". The "curry leaves" on the other hand add an excellent flavor to any Indian meal when found fresh, available at most any Indian grocery store.

Absolutely incredible! Could not find curry leaves, but will continue to hunt for them for next time. This is possibly the best shrimp dish I've ever had.

to the cook from ithaca -- yes, kari leaves = curry leaves. one wonders why that wasn't correctly translated in the recipe! and as for why not parsley or chives... those simply aren't flavors found in indian cooking. both plants are native to europe.

My husband and I gave up trying to find kari leaves and made this recipe without it, giving it half again as much curry powder and garam masala. Also, we used lime juice rather than lemon (we just happened to have it) and mesclun with a good sprinkling of shredded sorrel rather than watercress, and it was stupendously delicious. We both thought this was one of the tastiest recipes ever. Perhaps kari leaves are *curry* leaves? We'll try that next, out of curiosity, but this couldn't be any yummier. Added on 4/6/01: Well I got my hands on some fresh kari/curry leaves (at the Atlanta Farmers' Market) and we tried the recipe as written, though with the spices still increased. It's still delicious but actually little changed, except for the visual appeal of bits of green. The herb's flavor is mild indeed. Don't despair if you can't get it. Why not parsley or chives for a touch of green?

wow! really delicious. Turn on your kitchen fan, b/c it's steamy and smoky, but fantastic!
