The sauce is actually kind of sweet...I was not expecting it and it was awesome.

Had good flavor... Boyfriend picked out the wrong type of steak, so was really fatty... However, the taste was great and had a different presentation (over bread, as opposed to served with potato, etc.). Will try again.

Very pleasant. Surprisingly sweet, although that may have been because I used Kasseri cheese (it's what I had). I sprinkled salt, pepper, and oregano on the meat prior to grilling, also. Had some trouble with the sauce breaking, but it was still quite tasty.

Being from the Central Coast, just north of Sydney, Australia it was difficult to get the exact ingredients for this recipe. However with imagination and a little adjusting , I made this dish. It was very tasty and my husband liked it too.
