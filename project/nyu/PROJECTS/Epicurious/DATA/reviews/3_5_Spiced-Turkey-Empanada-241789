This was quick and easy. I had some left over whole roasted chicken so I picked the it cleaned and used it instead of turkey. Definitely drain the liquid from the stuffing before assembling. I topped it with light sour cream and fresh quac and had salad with Mexican dressing!

To make it look more like an empanada than a calzone, divide dough in 8ths instead of 4ths. Also, drain the tomato juice from the filling before stuffing the dough, and crimp the edges with a fork before baking. I agree with other reviewers about the need to double (triple?) the spices and add onions, garlic and cheese.

This was a yummy, quick weeknight dinner. I used whole wheat pizza dough and my empanada's were not pretty, but my husband said they were delicious and something different.

This was great! But I thought it was too salty using canned tomatoes, so when I made it again I used a pound of fresh plum/Roma tomatoes and that made it.

Great recipe! I added onion, jalapeno, and bell pepper to the filling, and left out the olives. I used whole wheat biscuits which, once rolled out fully, worked beautifully! Served it with sour cream and guacamole for a wonderful dinner!

This was easy, super quick, and delicious! Listened to the reviewers and seasoned to taste vs going by the recipe. Added onion and green pepper and about a tbs of chipotle sauce...and a handful of chopped cilantro, little bit of cheese....used trader joe's fresh pizza dough as well.

I made the filling one night, and assembled them the next. Very easy and quite tasty! Thanks for the introduction to Trader Joe's fresh pizza dough! I tried the garlic herb and it was great for this recipe. Thanks all!

I enjoyed this dish. My mom and sister LOVED it! I added green peppers and onions and many more olives. In fact, I'll probably add even more olives the next time I make it. It needed more spices, but adding to taste was not a problem. I also folded the meat in pilsbury cresent rolls, which was a mistake. Next time, I'll have to find a different type of dough. Still, it was yummy!

this is actually 4 forks with the addition of a small amount of cheese as other cooks suggested. easy to make and the pizza dough was fun to work with. i'm going to sprinkle cheese on the outside as well next time to enhance an already golden brown crust. they may not be low fat anymore but we loved these!will definitely make again!

I loved this recipe. I used the garlic herb pizza dough and jalapeno stuffed green olives from Trader Joe's. I made a double batch and had a wonderful lunch the next day also.

Great dish. I added corn, doubled the spices and used a quarter cup of cheese in each empanada. Forgot the pizza dough so rolled out refrigerated biscuit dough, which worked just fine. Will definitely make again. Great recipe to play with.

I was looking for a different way to use ground turkey and this recipe sounded like something my family would enjoy. I admit I am a huge Trader Joe's fan and so used TJ's fresh pizza dough, browned the turkey and added chili powder and cumin and cooled it off. Added TJ's fresh salsa and a few handfuls of frozen roasted corn. I also added Mexican 4 cheese blend to the mix and served it with guacamole. I made an extra for my toddler using only the cheese. Big hit all around.

I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty these were. The pizza dough was difficult for me to work with though. I also sauteed 1 small onion prior to cooking the turkey. I used diced tomatoes with green chilis which gave it a bit of a kick. Also added cheese for the boyfriend.

I had a little trouble with the dough and the spices, so a few of these kind of fell apart, but I would definitely make them again with more spices and cheese.

We really enjoyed this recipe. It was easy to make and tasty - we went a little easy on the spices so our toddler could eat it. Next time we would add a little sharp cheese.

Great dish! I used the black olives but I am thinking next time I will used a mixture of green and black. A little spicy and each one is a full serving. I'm sure the leftovers we have for lunch tomorrow will be nice and spicy. Will definitely make again!

This recipe turned out great. It was really easy to make even for someone like me who has never handled pizza dough. In the future I'll probably mix some cheese into the filling.
