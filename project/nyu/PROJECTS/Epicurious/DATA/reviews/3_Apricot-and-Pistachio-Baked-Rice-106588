I really didn't like this recipe very much, it had a somewhat sour taste. i omitted the nuts altogether since i didn't have them on hand and used raisins and dried cranberries for the dried fruit. Overall, it wasn't really worth it and I don't think I'll make it again.

I agree with Allison - this was tasty but more complicated than the results merited. Also, the nuts get chewy after baking, so I'll sprinkle them on top next time.

I loved this recipe. I did not find the rice salty as some of the other reviewers did. I did not have any pistachios so I used pine nuts, browned in a bit of ghee. Butter would work also. I used dried apricots.

This was fine. Good even, but rice that takes some time, requires a recipe, and needs 2 pots and 2 heat sources should be more than just rice + fruit. If I make this again, I will add some seasonings such as cinnamon, cardamom, or even cook with chicken broth. It was VERY pretty, and looked lovely on the plate next to epicurious' "Spiced Moroccan chicken with onions and prunes" so that was good. And it did taste good, but it tasted like rice and fruit mixed together instead of a dish in and of itself that creates its own distinct flavor after the ingredients cook. P.S. Lenore: Trader Jos has shelled roasted but not salted pistachios that are inexpensive and work great in recipes.

Thanks to other reviewers, I cut down on the salt and was comfortable using dried apricots since no fresh ones in my market. I took dish to a potluck dinner and baked it there, which worked fairly well. Guests were very complimentary about it but no one went back for 4 helpings, as happened at another reviewer's. Next time I'll try to find shelled pistachios since I doubled the recipe and it seemed to take forever to shell those nuts!

pistachios should be toasted first and that salt must be a misprint!

Made this for a dinner party and had one guest go back for at least 4 helpings. So I'd say it was a success. Although my pistachios lost their cruchiness as well so next time I'll try adding them closer to the end.

This is a nice way to make rice - I've never baked it before. I used brown basmati rice which meant I needed to keep adding water during the baking process so it wasn't crunchy - my own fault. As a result, the pistachios lost their crunchiness. I think next time I'll add them at the end. I also used dried apricots instead of fresh. Overall a very pleasing dish.

I've made this twice and everyone loved this dish. It's simple and looks much nicer than white rice. The first time it was too salty so I halved (1 T) the salt the next time and found it was still too salty. Next time I'm going to use only 2 teaspoons salt and see how that is.

Liked this one alot but my rice turned out a little underdone when following directions. Does anyone know what temperature to bake at? I just picked standard 350 but maybe that's too high? I really enjoyed the sweet and saltiness from the fruit and boiling the rice in salted water.

This was a very different recipe. I made it for a dinner party and everyone enjoyed it and so did I.

Used the dried cherries and found this unusual, for me, method of cooking a rice dish to be a treat. Highly recommend.

The whole family loved this rice. I didn't use the 2 tablespoons salt (I'm not familiar with this method of cooking rice) and just added salt to taste at the end. Very colorful, use lots of pistachios and fruit.
