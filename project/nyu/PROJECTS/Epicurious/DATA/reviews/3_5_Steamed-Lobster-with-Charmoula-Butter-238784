We have a cooking competition each summer amongst our children. A couple of years ago, our then 9 year old made this, and it was great. He won the summer competition with this as his finale. We have since used the sauce with shrimp too.

This is the best butter I've had with lobster and I don't like the butter. I am making it again this weekend! Yummm

This recipe is absolutely fabulous. A tad time consuming... can't really be preparing anything else at the same time. But, all in all, well worth it. A definite keeper!

A simple, delicious butter that did not overpower the lobster

Charmoula seems to be the current fad. With boiled lobster simple is best........plain melted butter.

I made this tonight using frozen Maine lobster meat. I drained the meat and heated it through in the butter sauce. I also used Hot Hungarian Paprika instead of Hot Smoked Spanish Paprika since that's all I had. I am a huge lobster person, we ate whole lobsters all the time growing up and the flavors in the butter really kick it up a notch, sweet and spicy but mellow. Out of this world and so easy when you use the frozen lobster meat.
