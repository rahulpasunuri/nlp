This is incredibly easy but has the gourmet taste of something you've been slaving over for hours. Will make frequently!

Cannot say enough good things about this dish...tasty, easy, delicious, my husband and I LOVE it and it was part of our main course for our Valentine's Dinner. This is a no fail recipe.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish very much. Delicious! VERY easy and quick to prepare. I halved the recipe, watched the fish closely (did not take as long as our fillets were a bit smaller), and the sauce reduced perfectly. Used our home grown leeks! I served with brown rice made with sauteed yellow onion and homemade vegetable broth, and a salad. We will definitely be having this dish again.

I made this for my husband last night and he said it was the best fish that I've made for him yet. I followed the advice of other reviews and reduced the sugar to 1 tsp. The rest of the recipe, I followed exactly. My fillets were about 4 oz each, so I reduced the cooking time at little.

Great recipe! I almost feel guilty at how little I had to do for such a wonderful dish!

I made this last night and substituted 1/2 & 1/2 for cream and white cooking wine for vermouth--followed the rest of the recipe as written. Obviously I did something wrong because the end product looked awful and unappetizing. Even though my husband said it was good, I will definitely not be making it again. It was a disappointment to me and would love to know what I did wrong.

We didn't enjoy this much at all. The sauce was more like a curtled paste and it was far too sweet for our liking. Maybe I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly.

Fabulous and quick. My husband and my children loved it. Definitely a new staple. The leeks were so good I could eat that for dinner!

Tilapia was on sale so I use it in place of the orange roughy. The sauce is outstanding. Other reviewers are correct in that the sauce is great on scallops or other types of fish. I can just eat the sauce by the spoonful! Simple enough for everyday and perfect for a dinner party.

I liked this dish. I used white wine instead of vermouth as suggested and thought it was fine (although I'm curious how it would taste with vermouth). I had some of the sauce left over so the next day I used it with scallops. I think I liked this even better!

Very delicious! A definite keeper! The combination of the fish, leeks, thyme, cream and vermouth create a very tasty treat. Trader Joe's (for those fortunate enough to have one close by)sells a frozen version of orange roughy called "White Ruffy," and it was perfect for this dish. I'm sure tilapia would be delicious, as well.

I would add a package of baby spinach right before you add the fish; very delicious. I substituted light cream and white wine for whipping cream and vermouth and it was still delicious. Very easy to prepare and it brought the house down.

Yum! Gotta admit it didn't look that appetizing...but DAMN! It was good! Served it over sauted spinach as another had suggested and it was a hit!At the last minute I realized I was out of vermouth so used a very inexpensive white wine and still LOVED it! Are you sure it's not heathly? Seemed like it to me :)

Made this dish tonight. It was pretty delicious. The most important was that it was quick and easy to cook and that the ingredients are widely available. It was my first time using "vermouth" in a recipe. I read that different vermouth brands are infused differntly and that it all yields different tastes (can't wait to try another brand later on to see if it gives a different subtle taste). I liked the flavors and it was great served over rice. (did not have any crusty bread at home to sop up the sauce). I found it a bit rich, will cut down a bit on the whipping cream next time and maybe use a little less butter.

Very easy to prepare. however I found it a little sweet, I would cut the sugar down to 1 teaspoon or none at all.

An amazing dish for such a short list of ingredients! This is a must have for any recipe box!

This is a wonderful, tasty, easy to prepare dish my family loves. In fact we eat it about once a week and they never get tired of it. Served with a side salad and glass of wine it is a real treat.

I made this with mahi since roughy isn't available around here. Very delicious, very easy, simple cleanup.

Have made this numerous times with other types of fish. Love it!!!!!! And it's easy since it uses only one pan!!!!

Used mahi mahi and added a little fish stock and wine with the whipping cream. Also included carrots with the leeks. served with crusty bread to sop up the delicious sauce and it was a big hit. definitely a keeper.

I really enjoyed this light and delicious dish. I used Rosemary instead of Thyme (1/4 tsp). Very delicate. Make sure you have a good crusty bread with it to soak up the sauce.

Excellent compliment to the mild flavor of Orange Roughy. I did not have the whipping cream, so I improvised with Sweetened Whipped Cream. Good mistake that added a new dimension to the flavor. Definately will make again. Orvieto White Wine is excellent with this entree.

This is a recipe that even if you think you're a pretty good cook will make others think you are a GREAT one. I used all of the leeks and sauce for 2 large pieces of fish. I would keep that proportion if using more roughy...

Rating: 4
Quicky, easy, impressive, and very tasty. I served it up with rice pilaf and a Spanish white that complemented the fish and cream perfectly. The only complaint was that the orange roughy cost too much. The next time I'll use tilapia or sole.

GREAT dish! I made a few substitutions. I used evaporated milk instead of the cream, 1 tbsp butter and PAM, scallions instead of leeks, and white wine instead of vermouth. I thickened the sauce at the end with a little cornstarch slurry - DELICIOUS, and less fat too!

I had to make alot of substitutions, but it still came out great. I used flounder instead of orange roughy and, although the fillets did fall apart when I tried to get them out of the pan, they were delicious. I also used white wine instead of vermouth and left out the cream. It tasted rich and buttery nevertheless.

Quick, and easy as a mid-week meal yet suitable to serve for dinner guest. What more to say? Great flavors. Served with an herb and butter rice pilaf, and steamed baby carrots with a honey and ginger glaze. Perfect with a glass of Chardonnay.

I made the recipe because I happened to have all the ingredients. I served it on top of spinach as someone suggested and it was marvelous. We will have this again and again.

Delicious right from the beginning (tried it before the fish was even put in!) Was out of vermouth and chives, but happy enough with white wine (and frozen fish, no less). No other fish recipes of the same complexity and active time come close to this.

Very good recipe though fattening! I made no substitutions other than I used fresh thyme instead of dried.

This was very good, even substituting onion for the leeks and using frozen orange roughy! I will try this again with fresh fish - orange roughy or other white fillets.

Forgot to buy leeks used onions instead.I was out of vermouth used dry chablis.This is a keeper.

Even my "I'm not a fish eater" husband loved this! I served it on a bed of sauteed spinach (olive oil, shallot, balsamic vinegar, spinach). Good enough for company, will definately make it again.

Excellent - easy, fast and REALLY tasty! Definitely serve it with polenta or rice -- something that can absorb the yummy sauce. (And yes, I used 1/4 cup of vermouth also - must be the right measurement!)

This dish was perfect. Fast and delicious. The cream sauce was a perfect match with the fish. Even my two year old liked it! You will not be dissapointed.

Very tasty & fast & easy to make. The recipe seemed to omit the quantity of vermouth only stating 1/4 ??? A quarter what? Cup?, ounce? I used 1/4 Cup and that worked out just fine. I will make this again.....yummmm.

The taste is out of this world! This recipe is fast and easy and very impressive. Try it!
