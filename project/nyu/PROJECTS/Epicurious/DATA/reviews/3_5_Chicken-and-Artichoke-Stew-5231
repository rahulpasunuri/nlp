I also used chicken thighs browned in the oil because I think that chicken breast get too tough and thighs are more flavorful

I remember making a recipe very similar to this over 50 years ago. I used a green bell pepper and some mushrooms although I don't remember the proportionns. I also used frozen artichokes and instead of 1 cup of white wine, I used a 1/2 cup plus 1/2 cup checken broth. I also cheated and used canned tomatoes. Hope this helps.I would make thia again with my alterations

This was excellent. I did add a few items that woke up the flavor like calamata olives (pitted), capers and some red pepper flakes. Everybody loved it!

i thought this was good, but i spruced it up some due to the complaints of boringness. used boneless chicken thighs and added chicken/artichoke sausage, used red wine instead of white (all i had) and added capers and red pepper flakes. it's a good base recipe that allows you to be a little creative.

I substituted leeks, marinated artichokes, boneless chicken breast and canned stewed tomatoes. I used the oil from the artichokes to saute the leeks and chicken. Added thyme and a bay leaf. Lovely flavour. Served with couscous as another reviewer suggested.

Easy and tasty. From reviewers' tips and what was in my kitchen, I made these substitutions... used TJ's frozen artichokes 12 oz. bag, 14 oz can toms, and skinless boneless breast already in the fridge. My husband was impressed and my one year old couldn't get enough of it.

Loved it. I did the cheater's recipe with the canned artichoke and tomatoes and rotisserie chicken. I also made a flour butter mix at the end to cream up the sauce. Even my mac and cheese 2 and 4 year olds ate it. Also added the thyme and rosemary.

I made a quick version of this using supermarket rotisserie chicken, canned artichoke hearts, and tomatoes from my garden. I added a generous pinch of dried thyme. I cooked it about 15 minutes and served it over couscous. It took 30 minutes flat (including prep)and tasted great. My husband really enjoyed it too.

I did like this dish, but after preparing it 'to the recipe,' I worried it might be a bit bland so I put in a tablespoon of capers for some tang, and some rosemary for a little more depth. It ended up delicious and though I intended to serve it with rice...ended up with great garlic bread which just made it all the better.

My whole family loved it. I had read some of the reviews prior to making it, so I added a little italian seasoning to the mixture and used canned diced tomatoes. Rather than serving with rice, I spooned the mixture over rosamarina. Excellent.

enjoyed the recipe though wouldn't call it a stew--more like coq au vin with artichokes and tomatoes (which were nice additions). a nice meal if you have the time to trim the artichokes.

Simple with a few changes. I used cut up boneless skinless chicken breast, forozen artichoke hearts (cooked a bit in the microwave), as suggested - fresh basil and oregano. I served over broth cooked rice.

I love this recipe, and I've passed it on to three other friends who also have had fantastic results. The wine is critical, chose a wine you like to drink. I've also replaced one yellow onion with shallots, the 6 medium artichokes with 10 baby artichokes and to speed up the process, a 14oz can of stewed tomatoes instead of the two fresh.

I altered this recipe A LOT--it looked as though it would be very bland, so I added shallots, leeks and some chopped chorizo to the onions. I used three tomatoes instead of two, and it still wasn't enough. I put in dried basil, some red pepper flake, and lots of salt and pepper before simmering. Then I took the chicken out and took the meat off the bone. I added rice to the broth and cooked it right in there before adding the chicken back to the pot. Also, I used baby artichokes instead of regular-sized ones. Even so, it was still a bit bland. It needs something else. When I ate leftovers, I put in some lemon and shredded Parmesan, which improved it. Next time, I think I might replace half the chicken with some good-quality sausage, or put more chorizo in.

Non descript flavor. Leftovers were not eaten the next day by easy to please husband. It wasn't bad but not worth the effort. There are much better things to do with an organic chicken and fresh artichokes.

The original recipe was non-descript. I add a bay leaf and 1 tsp. of oregano to the simmering process. My other half, who isn't wild about artichokes said he would like me to make it again.
