Good, not great, with hot-smoked salmon and low fat cream cheese. Somewhat bland. If I do it again I will use more salmon, less (or no) cream cheese, and maybe dill.

This is a very easy, quick-to-prepare and tasty recipe. I have made it twice. The second time I omitted the smoked salmon and substituted sour cream for the cream cheese. It was just as good.

Im actually eating the finished product now and it's good...this is my first time using smoked salmon in a recipe ever...and I like it...I did make changes however...I didnt have green onions so I used leeks..and I added a little gruyere to the mozzerella..I also added some fresh dill...this is would make a lovley brunch dish..along with some fresh melon
