My grandfather taught me to make Gumbo, and this recipe is close to what we use, except we add a LOT more shrimp. Four times as much. Only add them at the end (15-20 minutes) to avoid overcooking. Also: You cannot place enough emphasis on cooking the roux slowly and very, very dark. It cooks faster as it darkens, and needs constant stirring. The darker it is, the more flavor the dish has. I cook it until I have a hard time telling it from the old black cast iron pot my grandfather gave me. Coarse chop the vegetables. They will provide more texture and a more distinct flavor when they are more 'chunky'. We add a significant amount of Garlic. Some basil, thyme and oregano will add extra depth. I always add 2 tsp of Cayenne Pepper as well.

This was incredibly bland. Cooked and stirred the roux for more than 15 minutes. It was nut brown, but still lightened considerably with other ingredients. I felt like I could taste flour in the end dish - and not much else. Added tomato and cajin spices found on another recipe the next day and it was better - but not really gumbo.

I've never followed a recipe on Epicurious with as unimpressive results as this one. I've made gumbo before, both with and without a recipe and have mostly found them to be very good and authentic (I've been to NOLA several times). Not ruling out my error in execution, however, other than having to use precooked chicken Andouille (2 Whole Foods near me didn't have fresh Andouille on hand), I followed these instructions to the letter. I was patient with the rue cook time, working it for 40 minutes on "low" setting but still didn't get a brown enough result. Moved the setting up to "2" and it got pretty dark within the ensuing 10 minutes. I've used butter before with better results. I believe that several instructions or lack thereof on this recipe could be the cause of my undesirable results: 1) I don't think that the veggies should be minced. Whisked with the rue, the pre-stick texture became pasty. It would have been better to keep them chopped and let them break down via heat. 2) Perhaps due to the Andouille I used, there was a depth of flavor lacking, so I compensated by adding Paul Prudomme's Creole seasonings and when that didn't achieve ideal results, adding a can of diced tomatoes helped a lot. 3) The quantity of okra was too high. I used fresh and it still gave the gumbo a slimy consistency. 4) The quantity of salt was too low relative to the volume of other ingredients. In general, if making a gumbo, I'd advise searching for a more reliable recipe.

Awesome! I doubled the recipe. Must be patient with the roux take about 30 mins. I added sliced jalepenos and chicken. Delicious!!

This gumbo was outstanding--to the point that I have thrown away all my other recipes for gumbo! It was so good that I have posted it on my recipe blog where I include only those recipes that I rate as "frantastic!" Don't wait for Mardi Gras to make it! http://www.fransfavs.com/2012/01/shrimp-and-andouille-gumbo/

I make gumbo often and like to try new recipes. This was nice, except for the fact that there was way too much roux and not enough veggies. I did not have the oily mess, either. Roux is a bit oily, until it begins to brown, but once it becomes the rich nutty brown or red it will lose that oiliness. Will make this again with a few changes, maybe a bit of garlic

I didnt get any of the oily mess that people described, so it is hard to imagine what they did if you followed the recipe. I didnt do the orka and doubled the sausage. Put the shrimp in at the end and it was outstanding! I cooked my roux for 20 minutes and could have gotten it darker if I went longer, but I was satisfied and it tasted great! Definitely would make it again

This has to be the one, take your time with the roux, I took an hour. Makes all the difference, so simple and yet so flavorful!

Made this with gluten-free flour (King Arthur,) as my father an brother are both celiacs, and it turned out well. The roux does not darken as much as it would with wheat flour, but it thickens the same way and still tastes good. Also added a diced up chicken breast, diced jalapeno, and omitted the okra (because I couldn't find any fresh). Will definitely make this again, because it is a really good basic recipe that allows for experimenting with ingredients.

Ignore everyone below who suggests using frozen okra. it is truly horrible tasting and slimy. Cook the roux for 25-30 minutes and use a whisk, not a wooden spoon (to avoid splashing). increase the andouille by about 1/2. put in the shrimp very near the end to avoid overcooking.

Does anyone know of a non-wheat flour that can be used in a roux? I'm gluten-free, but dying to try this recipe.

Great intro Gumbo recipe. You won't go far wrong by starting here. You've got the Cajun Napalm (the roux) and the Holy Trinity (celery, green pepper, onion.) True, you usually won't find file AND okra in the same gumbo; they're both used for thickening. But I like them both, and added them. Read up on roux in wikipedia. The lighter it is, the more it thickens; the darker it is, the more flavor. I got mine to brick red, and the next time am aiming for ebony. If you can't get fresh okra, use 2/3 of a bag of 10 oz frozen; you can use the remaining okra for the Lentil Soup with Andouille Sausage recipe, also on Epicurious.

I merged this recipe with another one. I added 2 cut chicken breasts, a can of diced tomatoes some extra chicken broth and water. I didnt have okra so I used frozen cut green beans. It going to be even better tomorrow!

I used half corn oil and half butter. I added white pepper, cayenne, fresh oregano, fresh thyme, salt, cumin and black pepper. Wonderful. The trick was using the cast iron pan and being patient with the roux. I had homemade chicken stock on hand. Fabulous. Having said that, I'm not from Louisiana so I don't know how it's supposed to taste. I just know my family loved it.

With this one, the key is to toast the flour in the oven, stirring frequently till light brown and NEVER stop stirring the roux. I doubled the andouille and shrimp and also added half pound of crab meat. Also added some oysters I bought from a Dude at the pier. Careful with that okra Eugene and.... never add seafood till right before the finish! I also added 5 jalapenos and 3 long cayennes, seeded and chopped and a couple of tbls. of cayenne powder cuz I like it hot. SWEET!!!

With all respect to the CIA, I suggest using a whisk to stir the roux. Cajun cooks, including myself, have found out thru the years that hot roux on skin can cause extreme pain. Spoons and spatulas make the roux splash, increasing the risk of nasty grease burns.

Its been a long time since I've made a recipe that was a real bust, but this is it. There was a nasty oil slick on top, so that had to be skimmed off. Very floury taste even though I cooked the roux for 20 minutes to a very dark brown. Except for the andouille, it was a very bland recipe. Will try Food Network! Wish I could have given it ZERO forks.

I forgot to add I used frozen sliced organic okra from Whole Foods market and there was no slime!

My family and I really, really enjoyed this recipe with some needed modifications in my opinion. I got a lot of compliments and this has been added to my repertoire. I used the following modifications: * 3/4 C flour for the roux, makes it thicker, and you must cook the roux much longer than called for. You want it to turn a dark brown, not a caramel color. * double the holy trinity to 1 cup each (onion, bell pepper and celery) *12 oz andouille instead of 8oz, which is where the spice came from for me, and also was spicier the next day. If you want even more kick, add cayenne pepper to taste. *added 3 or 4 cubed chicken thighs browned. * I opted to add 28 oz caned diced tomatoes (garlic and onion seasoned), which I know some frown upon, but IMO was a tasty addition. * THIS IS IMPORTANT: peel the raw shrimp and add the shells and tails to a metal strainer and set it into the top of the gumbo for about 15 min or so. This gives you depth of flavor that was sorely lacking without. (I'm sure you can use a cheesecloth or some other method to strain out the shells, but I had a strainer, so..) Add the raw shrimp in the last 5 min. or so, so it doesn't get overcooked. * (optional) Sprinkle with Gumbo file'. ENJOY!

Just OK. Way too runny! I like my gumbo thick and this was more like a soup. The flavor was on the bland side too. I made mine with shrimp, chicken, and andouille. I also added 3 jalapeno and 3 serrano peppers for some heat. If I were to do it again, I'd think about adding a good creole seasoning to kick up the flavor. I'd also increase the flour by 50% or so to address the thickness.

If i had followed the flour measurement this would have been to runny, i probably added close to an additional 1/4 cup of floor to actually get it somewhat thick. Like others i added the shrimp right before the pot was pulled off the stove. Overall it was pretty decent

This was good Gumbo. Poker guys agree we have had waaaaay better but this one was filling and flavorful.

The roux did take quite a bit of time, but WOW was it well worth it. I used frozen chopped okra, as fresh wasn't available locally and it was totally fine. I also added the shrimp for the just the last five minutes, and it worked out great! My husband and I couldn't get enough of it - enjoyed it the first night with rice and the leftovers with orzo - both excellent accompaniments!

This recipe was terrible! My husband made it and followed the recipe exactly - way too much okra! All in all a big, slimy waste. The only good thing was the Andouille sausage from a local company. We've destroyed this recipe and hope it rests in peace!

This was great except for the roux part. I doubled the recipe, so had 1 cup canola oil and 1 cup flour. I cooked it for 30 minutes and was still able to whisk it since it was still liquidy. The color was a deep dark brown and the aroma was definitely nutty. I proceeded with the recipe, but had an oil slick in the end and scooped as much as possible off the top. The flavor was still wonderful, hence the 3 stars.

Best dang gumbo! We used twice the amount of andouille (we like andouille). Fifteen minutes is too long to cook shrimp (we don't like rubber shrimp) so don't do it. We added the shrimp at the last minute then into the bowls it all went. Garnishing the finished stew with the gumbo file is the best.

Hello, everyone. Some of the tricks that I find work for me when making a roux are: always use a cast-iron skillet AND different oils will give you different results. I find that corn oil works well with a half flour/half oil ratio, but I find that I have to add more flour when I used canola oil and still the roux was on the thin side.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe pretty closely (I don't always measure...). Make the roux a little darker than you think you need to, and go easy on the okra...if the gumbo sits, it will turn a bit green, and slimy. It was very yummy, but I am glad that I was only serving it to family, as the color was very unappatizing.

If you add tomatoes (a no-no in Louisiana) it becomes Texas Gumbo. I use 1/3 cup flour to 1/3 cup canola oil over medium fire stirring constantly and get a decent roux 99% of the time.

This was really tasty, and quite easy -- just time consuming. The roux took twice as long to turn a dark brown. I added a can of diced tomatoes, without the juice, which accompanied the okra quite nicely. I also threw in five cloves of minced garlic with the celery, onions and peppers. I'd also suggest putting in the shrimp at the very end, because it only take few minutes to cook them.

The gumbo is fantastic, and very easy to make in one hour. I made 1/2 recipe, and the roux seemed too thin, as was the finished gumbo. It seemed like it could have used another rounded tablespoon of flour. But, I used peanut oil, and I do not have previous gumbo knowledge to really know what I was doing. Regardless, it came out a very good and eclectic dish. Highly recommended.
