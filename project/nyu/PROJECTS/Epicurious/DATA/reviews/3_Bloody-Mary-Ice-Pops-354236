I guess I used too much vodka, but even if I didn't, Vodka doesn't freeze so how does this recipe work?

I've done these (without the vodka, one was for a child) in fun shaped ice cube trays as a garnish for bloody caesars (Canuck thing, Clamato instead of tomato juice), and they were a hit. Half the recipe easily filled three ice cube trays, and a glass leftover for the cook (this time with the vodka, of course). Bonus marks if you can find those silly swizzle sticks to freeze into them.

WOW! This looks phenomenal, I'm going downstairs to make this right now. I hate horseradish and will substitute my special Jamaican seasonings. I use Absolut Pepar Yummy.
