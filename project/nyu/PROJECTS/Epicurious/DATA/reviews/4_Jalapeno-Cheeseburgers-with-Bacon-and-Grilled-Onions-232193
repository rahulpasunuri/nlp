This is by far the most delicious burger I have made. The glaze makes the meat moist and slightly sweet, and goes perfectly with the tang and spice from the ranch sauce. I made this with my dad a few weeks ago and we have talked about them since. I used a traditional hamburger bun and toasted it in a bit of butter... yum. Added some sharp cheddar cheese and lettuce to the burger as well. Do not omit the glaze... it makes the burger special.

This is the best burger I´ve ever had!!! I mixed one egg and some bread crumbs into the meat as I think it is easier to make big flat patties that way. I also excluded the jalapeño in the meat. Instead I added more to the dressing. This was because our kids don´t like spicy food at all. They also loved the burgers...without dressing that is.

This was my very first burger from scratch. I really liked it but my husband didn't due to meat being tough. Well, apparently I over mixed the ground beef (lesson learned). Over mixing aside, I really liked the spicy ranch sauce, even used leftovers over scrambled eggs. The coffee glazed really added a different dimension to the burger. I made one with and without the coffee glaze and I really enjoyed the one with coffee glaze more than the plain one. I will try to make this recipe again and not over mix beef.

This is just a darn good burger. The sauce and the glaze give it a little something special and elevate it to 'dinner party worthy.' I swapped smoked gouda with bacon for the cheddar, and left off the actual bacon. The cheese really put it over the top. Oven fries (which are also good dipped in the extra sauce) and spicy slaw make perfect accompaniments. Fantastic!

I will definitely be making this again! I used Creole seasoning instead of cayenne pepper and pepper jack cheese. It's not too spicy - the flavors work together beautifully.

We are living in Australia and decided to make a unique burger for our Ausi friends. They were a bit hesitant, but all loved the burger. The glaze added a really nice sweetness, while the ranch cooled down all the spice. Definitely showed the aussis how to BBQ, will do it again!

It may be just a burger but boy, what a burger. A lot more work than throwing a burger on the grill but sauce and glaze could definitely be made a day ahead ... in fact the sauce was even better the 2nd day. Followed the advice of others and halved the sauce. I also caramelized onions and drizzled some of the glaze in them while cooking ... puts it over the top. I will just slice the cheese next time. I think the grating is an extra step and it's hard to keep it from dropping all over the grill when putting it on the burgers. And make sure you toast your buns well because the burger is really juicy and with the sauce and carmelized onions, the buns can get soggy as you eat your burger. We were still talking about these burgers two days later.

Dish was a huge hit when I made it at home. The sauce was a little runny so I suggest adding less sour cream. Overall a great dish! I did not use the glaze because others said it didn't make a difference. Loved it.

Awesome burger if chipotle in adobo is substituted everywhere for fresh jalapenos. I tried it both ways, and the chipotle really gives it a more intense flavor. Also added a little adobo sauce to the dressing and meat mixture for more flavor. Topped with pepper jack, caramelized onions, avocado and turkey bacon. Also have used ground bison instead of beef, just as good and a little healthier. Don't really need the glaze, but makes it more moist.

Made these for our 4th of July BBQ. When I first tasted the ranch sauce I thought it tasted too tangy and was nervous about serving it. However, paired with the burger it was wonderful. One guest said it was the best buger he had ever had! I added mashed avocado with jalapeno (2 avocado + 1 minced jalapeno without seeds) which put it over the top. Everyone was joking that they were so good they inhaled them in three second flat!

Spectacular burger. I've been asked to "bring the burgers" when attending friends BBQ's. I have made with and without the glaze. It certainly is good and can make the burger exceptional - but most guests can live without, especially when counting calories! Still a great burger without the hassle of the glaze.

This is one of the best burgers i've ever had. There is such a great contrast of flavor that you can taste 5 different things at one time. First theres jalapeno and then there's lime and then it goes off into a blast of flavors and spice. What i like most about this burger is the spicy ranch sauce. It can be used for the buger and the salad. It also has spice, sour, and fresh flavors in it that give it a good kick. Make the bacon first then keep it under a heating lamp. Lastly, when you're puting on the glaze, you'll have a lot. Feel free to smack it on because the more the better.

Eh...not bad but not the best burger recipe on this site. The sauce was too runny to taste the flavors, the glaze was great on its own but couldn't taste the flavor once glazed on the burger..and the burger could have used more heat and less onion. I will modify it and try again..

This is easy and tasty. I was cooking for ten people and I used an equal amount of ground turkey and ground beef for the burgers. I stuffed the burgers with mango and ginger cheese. The burgers with the mango and ginger cheese sent the burgers over the top with the guests. The spicy sauce was made a few days in advance and also served as dipping sauce for chips and veggies. Wonderful, everyone loved it and I will make it again.

This recipe is fantastic! My husband and I both love most things spicy, and this fit the bill. Albeit messy, it's tasty, flavorful, and just plain delicious. We omitted the bacon and grilled onions just for simplicity, although I can see they'd be good with the whole package. It was also pouring rain when we made these, so I cooked them in a pan on the stove rather than on the grill, and they still came out great. I just brushed them with the glaze in the pan.

I made these tonight for my boyfriend and he said they were the best burgers he has ever had. Don't leave off the glaze-it adds a little sweet to balance the spice. It had just the right amount of heat. I grilled some onions and then forgot to put them on the sandwich-honestly, they don't need any extra fixings. I think instead of going out for a burger from now on I'm going to be obligated to make these.

I reviewed this recipe earlier, but recently I tested out a few substitutions for us busy working mom types. OK, skip the cayenne in the burgers AND the sauce. It is fine without. BUT I put a chopped chipotle in the sauce and in the burgers. I froze what was left from the can on a small plate and then bagged it for next time (what a waste otherwise) and *gasp* I used precooked bacon in the jar from the store. Bacon flavor not as intense, but still worked just fine. I also used the cilantro that comes in a tube (another HUGE gasp) and squeezed a lemon, as that was all I had, into the sauce and it was great. You can cut the sauce down to about 1/4 and still have plenty left. Then I cooked them on the stove top. I absolutely LOVE these burgers.

Rating: 0
I thought these burgers were terrific! Without a doubt they were the best burgers I have ever made, and they were better than a lot of the burgers I have ordered at restaurants. I followed the directions pretty closely, with the exception of: a) I used a little less lime juice than called for, b) I topped them with caramelized onions instead of grilled onions, and c) I made them on the stove top because we don't have a grill. These did take more work than your average burger, but they were well worth it.

DH and I love this recipe. We thought the sauce tasted fine but prefer plain mayo as the sauce overpowers the the flavors in the meat. However, the glaze is very tasty. We made these burgers for a family gathering minus the sauce. Everyone raved about them and had to have the recipe. I don't believe it is time consuming as I threw it together quickly and refrigerated until time to cook.

I thought this came out fabulous. I didn't have an onion so I used onion powder, and not having real hardwood charcoal I added a bit of smoke flavored powder right into the burgers. I skipped the glaze (because I am lazy), and used chipotles in place of jalepenos as someone suggested. I only had one lime and I think the flavor of it really enhanced the sauce.The only thing I would do different is cut down on the cayenne in the burgers, I wouldn't touch it in the sauce, but that is just my taste. My son thought they were fine and weren't too hot. Someone mentioned this being time consuming but I had it ready and on the grill in less than 15 minutes. I cooked the bacon while I mixed up the burgers and while the grill heated I put together the sauce.

I won't be making regular hamburgers ever again. I halved the recipe and could have halved the recipe for the spicy ranch sauce again. You really only need a few tablespoons for each burger. I agreed with one of the other cooks and left out the lime juice entirely. I know that the coffee in the glaze sounds odd, but you CAN NOT leave it out! It adds to the smokey grilled flavor and the glaze makes the burgers really moist.

Excellent burger recipe! I made the recipe exactly as written. The only thing I would change would be to cut the amount of the lime juice in the ranch dressing to one or two Tbls. The lime flavor was just a bit much. This is now one of our favorite burger recipes.

Very Very good! Easy to make - would definitely make again - no more plain burgers after this! I halved the meat but left the other ingredients as is - should have halved the salt though! The glaze is really good and is a must. The ranch sauce recipe should be halved - there is way too much to go around. We melted White American cheese instead of cheddar and served with tomato slices and avocado. Don't forget the bacon. Yum yum....

Rating: 3
I make these all the time, without the glaze, and they are a hit. I use the same amount of all the ingredients but I only use a pound of meat, the flavors really come through that way. I do bind them with one egg to keep them from falling apart on the grill (which they used to do before I added the egg). Nice and simple.

The burgers are great and the coffe glaze is essential. To me the sauce kind of gets lost, so next time I make them I probably won't go to the trouble to make it. I slice the onions very thin and caramalize them before adding to the beef mixture. It adds another dimension of flavor. I may try adding some chipotle next time just to add some more kick. I make the whole recipe, even tho there are only 2 of us. I just store the extra with my Foodsaver and freeze so we can have these on a whim! Dee-lish!

This was definitely a delicious burger. I couldn't really give it all four forks cause it is just a burger. But it's a burger that I'll definitely be adding to my repitoir. I only made/will make two changes. First, I doubled the jalapeno (both in the sauce and the meat) because me and my wife both like a little heat. Also, I thought there was a little too much onion in the meat. Because of that I had some minor issues with keeping the burgers in one piece. That very well may be due to my average chopping skills, but next time I'll be halving the amount of onion.

WOW! We cooked these in a grill pan and they were still the best burgers we've ever had. There are only two of us, so I halved the recipe, and we ate the same thing two nights in a row (happily!).

It IS a burger so I cannot rate it 4 forks, but what a burger! Would be very comfortable offering this to anyone and wouldn't feel that it was too simple a fare-but it is simple to make...the sharper the cheddar the better.

I've subscribed to Bon Appetit for 15 years and this is my first 4 fork rating for a burger! This is the best burger ever. The glaze is what makes these so fantastic. Use the sharp white cheddar, any other cheese will not be able to stand up to all the flavors in the burger, glaze and sauce. We grilled Vidalia onions to serve with the burgers and found terrific foccacia rolls at a local bakery. Yum! This will be our new burger recipe.

I enjoyed the combination of flavors very much! As others have noted, this recipe makes much more sauce & glaze than you'll use. I would cut the amount of lime juice in the sauce next time -- but the glaze was perfect as is. Like others, I thought the jalapenos added just the right amount of heat. Those persons who like smoke coming out of their ears can probably just add the seeds! This burgers can be messy eating, so I would recommend: 1) Serving them only when neatness is not an issue; 2) Cutting the burger in half before plowing in. Oh yes . . . make sure you use vine-ripe tomatoes!

My husband and I enjoyed this burger a lot. I skipped the glaze because of the butter content, but just glazed it with ketchup and worcestershire sauce. we substituted low fat sour cream and fat free mayo for the spread. i also grilled some onions on the side and topped it off to the burger. next time i think i will try grilled mushrooms and incorporate some shredded cheese inside the burger as suggested by my husband. i cooked the burger on the george foreman grill to take out the fat.

I have to preface this by saying that I am not a huge fan of turkey bugers, or ground turkey in general, but I wanted to make this recipe tonight, and we had eaten red meat way too many nights in a row, so I figured with all of the other flavors going on that this might work with turkey. I made the recipe exactly as it is written except for turkey instead of beef....it was really excellent, though a little more time consuming that I had thought it would be. I served it with avacado, carmelized red onions, and tomato. I froze the extra bugers for another time, and will find something to make for dinner tomorrow that will use that excellent sauce. I will definitely make this again, and will keep the sauce in mind for many other mexican style dishes.

To A cook from Charlotte: Who are you to tell someone to step away from a recipe because they make healthier dietary choices by not using full fat ingredients?

Keep your ignorant opinion to yourself.

I made these burgers this evening with a few substitutions. Used low-fat mayo, fat-free sour cream, ground sirloin, turkey bacon, and reduced-fat cheddar cheese.

Good change of pace from regular burgers. Being a bit shy of fresh jalapenos' hotness, I substituted green chiles and just added dashes of ground chipotle pepper powder to taste (easier to control the heat and adds a nice smoky taste). Next time we'll skip the glaze - it is an unnecessary step when you have so many flavors going on. Don't, however, skip the grilled onions!

I thought these were some of the most delicious burgers I have ever made or eaten. The spiciness was very prevalent but not overwhelming. I used applewood smoked bacon, and pepperjack cheese. I agree that the cheese didn't add much flavor, but I enjoyed the textural element. I thoght the glaze was an absolutely FANTASTIC addition to these burgers, and I look forward to trying it with other grilled meats... the coffee added a rich and unexpected earthiness. As with all grilled foods, using real hardwood charcoal is a must. If you're using briquettes (or worse) a gas grill, you're cheating yourself.

Rating: 3

Fixed this for Father's Day and it was a hit. We are always looking to lower fat content so I did use low fat sour cream and mayo in the sauce and turkey bacon instead of regular.
