I thought this was one of the best red pepper soups I've made (and I have tried quite a few different ones)... I roasted and peeled 4 large peppers myself rather than using jarred peppers. I used 1/4 cup of fresh orange juice, some extra orange zest in the soup, plus a 1/2 tsp of sweet/hot paprika as mentioned by another reviewer. I ended up using the full 2 cups of broth (veggie broth in this case), and it had a wonderful smooth consistency - not too watery at all. For the orange cream, I used sour cream instead of heavy cream, just because I already had some open. Loved this soup, and would definitely repeat exactly like I made it tonight.

GREAT soup. I used less orange juice than called for, and also less stock. Perfect consistency. I also made my own cream topping by mixing greek yogurt, sour cream, and orange rind. Awesome.

This was very good for a quick, simple recipe. I added red pepper flakes for some heat and stirred in a bit of cream at the end, omitting the orange peel.

I've been making this soup for a couple of years now and we just love it. It's absolutely simple to make (use an immersion blender instead of messing with the blender) and a great change from the typical tomato soup on a cold winter evening. Obviously, since there aren't many ingredients, use the best quality stuff you can find: fresh not reconstituted OJ, top-quality chicken broth or stock, excellent roasted red peppers...we usually skip the whipping cream and orange peel topping because we just don't have the time, but a dallop of sour cream is nice if you have it on hand. I like to use white pepper since it disapears into the soup. Also the basil is a pretty, fragrant touch -- especially at a holiday meal. I served this at a Christmas Eve dinner and it got raves.

Used fresh roasted pepers instead, and a litle less orange juice. Great chilled or luke warm too. I recommend this as a starter to the bombay sliders on this site.

Excellent. I used only 1/4 cup orange juice and tasted as I added to find the right blend. I also added a dash of smoked paprika. It mellowed the sweetness. Otherwise a great soup on a cold winter night and so easy to make.

My fiancee and I made this soup for a dinner and was one of the best we've made. It's a nice change from the normal soups made for dinner parties

I don't know if I totally botched it or what, but this soup was a complete disaster. The recipe calls for WAY too much orange juice, and is totally bland. I served it at a book club where the members usually eat anything, but after one spoonful the entire pot went right down the garbage disposal. Steer clear, or augment the recipe heavily!

The soup has a delightfully fresh taste. I didn't use as much orange juice as called for. As I was adding I was tasting and thought more would be too orangy. It is a very simple soup to make.

A very pleasent soup with the cream but a bit bland by default. I ended up adding a lot more salt in to improve the taste. Also, I'd recommend staying away from fire roasted peppers as the burnt aspects tend to discolor the taste slightly.

Very disappointed. It was bland and watery even though I used less broth. I have a much better red pepper soup from another source.

I found this dish easy to make, and surprisingly very good. The orange Juice adds an odd sweetness to the spiciness of the peppers, and the onions. It really does work. It is a very good 'late night' dinner when you are running crazy and before you know it it's like 8PM. It's light and very delicious.

I just had a dinner party,and served this soup-my guests gave it rave reviews!They said it was comparable to a 5 star restaurant!I used "Better than Boullion" rather than low salt broth.I will definately make it again!!!!

I made this as written, with the addition of a healthy sprinkle of ground chipotle chile, enough to add a slight kick and a great smoky flavor that complements the peppers and orange beautifully.

this soup was refreshing and different. The orange cream topping added alot to the taste. I almost didn't include that, but I'm very glad I did.

This soup is dead easy to make in minutes, especially if you buy a jar of roasted red peppers. The orange juice adds a touch of sweetness to the soup. The orange zest is a great final touch.

If you like red peppers, you will love this soup! It's not something you see very often in restaurants, so it's a real treat for a week-night meal. Lovely roasted red pepper flavor. The cream adds a nice cool touch.

Made this beautiful soup for guests and it looked super, tasted...fair. The cream swirl was sort of a gastronomical flop in my view, as it did not really take on the flavor of the orange peel. And I roasted my own peppers whole, per a roasted red pepper recipe on this site, and the black parts on the skin made the juice a little bitter, also made seeding a challenge. In future, if I were to make this again, I'd quarter and seed the peppers before roasting and not use olive oil. The look of the soup set the tone for a terrific meal, but the taste was a little disappointing.

It was easy, quick, and delicious. Because of a low chloestrol/diabetic diet, I substituted splenda for sugar and used Minute Maid Heart Wise orange juice. I also sprinkled with ground flax seeds. Everyone enjoyed with a salad.

Follow the recipe and it will turn out just like the picture and taste just fine. Change things and it won't. It's that simple.

pbonefirst from Millerton, ny is it too late? I wouldn't use the juice. Next time don't add olive oil when you roast the peppers. I roasted some for this recipe (sorry haven't had time to try soup yet) I cut peppers into quarters, flatten them as much as possible put them on a foil lined baking sheet and broil. Let cool, remove skins and voila! If you have extra....after peeling they make a fabulous side dish drizzle with olive oil, salt and fresh cracked pepper add some parm. shavings or pine nuts for pizazz!

I'm halfway through making this...I roasted my own fresh red peppers, and as a result, the juice has a fair bit of olive oil in it and looks quite dark and carmelized in color. Should I drain the peppers and not use the juice? I don't want the soup to be brown. Is it worth the tradeoff not to use the juice?

Fresh flavor, very light in texture but too acidic, even after adding more sugar, so much so that everyone ate their soup soaked up in bread rather than with spoons. Added honey to try to counter the acidity. We did not keep the leftover.

It was probably the picture of the soup that pursuaded me to prepare it. I'm very happy that I did. The flavors complemented each other beautifuly. The soup was delicious. The jar of red pepper that I had on my shelf was from Trader Joe's and the lable boasted that the peppers were Fire Raosted. It certainly didn't hurt the recipe!

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I plan to tonight. So I was thinking, maybe I can substitute an orange juice reduction for the sugar. Does anyone think this might ruin the recipe? If not, how much of the reduction should I use? I'm thinking an equal substitution would be about right...

I roasted and peeled my own peppers and substituted tangelo for orange peel. I also sieved the soup after it was pureed. I think this was one of the best soups I've ever made.

I made this last night as an appetizer for Valentine's Day dinner. I thought it turned out great. I made the soup the night before and it reheated well. Definitely some nice, simple flavor combinations - but I agree with the previous writer that you would not want to sit down to a huge portion of this. It's a great intro. I added quite a bit of fresh black pepper to balance the sweetness - very good!

Followed the recipie to the letter & thought it turned out well. This is absolutely an appetizer soup, not a main course soup. The flavor is different and unusual until you take a few spoonfuls then the orange flavor with the red pepper seems to make sense. Very light. The basil and cream with the orange peel makes it special but it would taste all right with a sprinkle of parmesan also. I put the cream in a small bowl with the peel and whisked for about 50 seconds by hand. This is plenty to make the cream stay on top of the soup and then to be swirled. I can see this as a starter to a Carribean meal or a light Mexican meal. It didn't need further thining in my mind.
