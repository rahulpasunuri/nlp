Wow, this was amazing even if very simple. Admittedly, I had an advantage in that I used a just-picked crop of mandarins from my own trees. The flavor and consistency are exquisite. If I try this for company, I might try serving with the orange oatmenal cookies on this website.

Who'd have thought that 2 ingredients could make such a delicious dessert? I made a fruit salad with lots of diced fruit tossed with a gingered simple syrup, and put a scoop of this sorbet in the middle. It was a delicious, light end to a heavy meal.

Simple and delicious! I used Florida Honey Tangerines and they were so sweet on their own I almost decided against any sugar. I ended up using 1/4 cup of Splenda. Next time I will eliminiate altogether if tangerines are extra sweet. Try this one - you'll be pleased.

Delicious, but too sweet for me. Next time, I'll try only 1/2 cup of sugar. (If you don't have superfine sugar, just put the sugar through a blender or food processor for a little while).

This recipe is healthier and tastier than any other tangerine sorbet recipe I have seen. I needed to use about 18 large tangerines to get this amount of juice. The sorbet is simply wonderful and is already my favorite cold dessert. I will make this in the future, not only for my husband, but for guests and other friends.

So refreshing and delicoius, especially after a heavy meal! I serve the sorbet in the hollowed out tangerine rinds for a simple and beautiful presentation. Passing the scooped out tangerine through a food mill easily extracts the juice.

Delicious !!! Easy to make, and a lot of raves. I just added 2 whisked egg whites at the middle of the freezing process. It helps give a soft touch for the sorbet.
