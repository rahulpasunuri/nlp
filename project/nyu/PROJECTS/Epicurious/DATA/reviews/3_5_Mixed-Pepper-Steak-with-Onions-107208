Delicious! i made the following changes: used double the cornstarch mixture. Also marinated the sliced flank steak in a mixture of 1/2 cup soy sauce, two sliced garlic cloves, 2 tablespoons sherry, 1 tablespoon sugar, 2 teaspoons ground ginger and 1 teaspoon of dried pepper flakes.

After reading all the reviews the only changes that I made were to double the sauce and use beef broth instead of water. A good stir fry with adequate flavor! Served with rice as suggest, quick and easy.

This recipe was great. I did make a few adjustments. When I combined the steak with the peppers I added alot more soy sauce. When I seasoned the steak at the beginning I used seasoning salt black pepper garlic powder and onion powder. I also made two of the cornstarch mixtures as one was not enough. and I also used two tablespoons of chicken bouillion flavor came out great tasted just like take out my bf loved it

This recipe is why I love Epicurious. I typed in steak, pepper and onion and this is what came out. The flavor was very good and super easy. Everyone ate it which is a big plus with my family. I threw in some pea pods at the end 'cause I love them.

I used flour instead of corn starch, and added a tablespoon of oyster sauce, and it tasted much better than I expected. I also used McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of salt and pepper for added flavor. Good, quick dinner recipe, and my family loves it.

Added depth by substituting Chicago steak seasoning for the salt and pepper plus a light dusting of white pepper. Then sprinkled worchestershire over the steak and onion/pepper mixture. For some added spice add some sriracha chili sauce to the soy sauce, cornstarch mix. Hearty and yummy!

Great dish! I added about a tablespoon of ground pepper (we love pepper in this house), used two large green peppers and one red, and cut the garlic in half and replaced the missing half with fresh ginger. Very, very good.

Delicious! This had a very good taste to it. I took some others' suggestions, and doubled the sauce, added red pepper flakes (about 1/4 tsp), 1/2 tsp powdered ginger, and 1 tbsp sugar. I also substituted beef broth for plain water (what I really did is, add the amount of water suggested, and add beef bouillon), and marinated the beef in all that for a few hours. Thanks for the suggestions, other reviewers!

Easy and taste great! I made this recipe as a quick meal for dinner. I didn't add or take away a thing. My family loved it and it will be one of our future favorites.

I also doubled the sauce, added red pepper flakes and marinated the beef cubes and it came out beautifully. It was easy and fast to make which is always a plus.

This is more for me the next time than a general review. First, I doubled the sauce and added 1 tsp fresh ginger to the veg as recommended below. I like mushrooms with my pepp steak, so I added 8 oz sliced mushrooms to the veg after they cooked for 2 minutes. I added salt to the pan after another 3-4 minutes. It was very good. Next time, I won't add the liquid before covering and will check the peppers after 2 minutes. Then, I'll add the doubled sauce and bring to a boil. Once I obtain the desired sauce consistency, I'll return the beef(chicken, fish, pork) to warm.

I didnt have a good experience with this dish. I tripled the sauce like one reviewer suggested and it was too much and too thin. There wasn't much tasted, and even the meat didnt cook well. I'm normally a good cook and make stif-fry type meals often. I will not be making this dish again.

This dish was easy to prepare, delicious and colorful ! I took the advice & added red pepper flakes and freshly minced ginger while sauteing the peppers & onions & also used beef broth rather than water. I added an extra onion & a few more garlic cloves. Next time, I will triple the sauce ingredients to get a little more gravy. Also, I used a "rump roast" as I wasn't in the mood to "roast" it today, lol ! It was great! Enjoy !

I made this dish and added the suggested ginger and red pepper flakes. In addition I substituted beef broth for the water. If you don't make any of the suggested substitutions use the beef broth as the flavor will be richer than just water. I also doubled the sauce. My son loved it an it is a quick dinner.

I make this once a week!! I can rattle of the recipe by heart--my husband's favorite!

I took the advice of others who made it and doubled the sauce, added lemon juice to the sauce, plus some finely minced ginger, and crushed red pepper flakes for spice. I also marinated the steak for a few hours in Teriaki and it came out so tender. My husband raved about this one...I'll definately be making this a lot in the future!

I make this recipe with onions and I add one tbl of sugar to the sauce. Also try doubling the sauce

I've been making this for a dozen or so years, but I omit thickening with corn starch. Instead, I use a can of Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup, add sliced fresh mushrooms, and stir in 1/2 tsp. of Chinese Five Spice. Serve over basmati rice. Add soy sauce to taste. Fixed this way, the recipe deserves a "4".

Very great dish i hope to use it again sometime.

I took this recipe as a jumping off point for a stirfry. I added carrots to the veggies and then added a little dried chillis to the sauce and while it was boiling I added 2 tbsp of orange juice and a tbsp of lemon juice just to zest it up a little. It worked out great.

Quick and easy to prepare - but it just wasn't very good. Not spicy enough, tasted like something was missing.

This recipe lacked flavor. The bell peppers were delicious, but the steak tasted very bland, even after generously seasoning with salt and pepper. I will not make this recipe again.

More soy sauce!!!! I thought It could've used more flavor. As I was cooking this dish, it looked so pretty with all the different colored peppers, but when I tasted it, I was disappointed. Add more pepper too!

This turned out AMAZING for a quick & easy soy sauce style stirfry. Substituted Venison backstrap for the sirloin, sliced baby portabella's for a green pepper(used 1 yellow, orange, and red), and used much less oil than called for..probably 1.5 tbs total. served with yummy jasmine rice... had Cal De Sol's Big House Red with it, which went well.
