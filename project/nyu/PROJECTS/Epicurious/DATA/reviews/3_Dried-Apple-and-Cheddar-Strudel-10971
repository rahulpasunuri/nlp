I made this without the cheddar, with margarine instead of butter (to be dairy-free), and with dried cranberries. It was pretty good. Despite the recipe's instructions, I liked it better after 4 days (it makes a huge loaf that will last you), and although it was better warm, it was quite good at room temperature.

Delicious. Especially nice to cap off a brunch.
