Lovely recipe. I didn't have any currant jelly on hand so I used cranberry juice(!) - it really added the fruity sweet/tartness it needed. At the end, my sauce had thickened quite nicely from the 3+ hours of cooking so I didn't need to do the final step of thickening and reducing it - really wasn't necessary. A+!

Hm - read reviews and decided to subtitute my short ribs for the chuck in Pot Roast with Winter Root Vegetables on this site. OMG, four forks - more work but cooked in half the time. FANTASTIC!

I give it 3 out of 4 because I altered the recipe somewhat. First, after the wine cools I marinate the ribs 1 day. Then proceed with browning. Instead of cooking on the stove, I prefer using the oven, or better yet, a slow-cooker. I omitted the zucchini because I'm not a fan. Added mushrooms and veal demi glace to the store-bought stock I used (really worth the price- adds a lot of depth). Overall I love this recipe. Simple, hearty and delicious. For those who's gravy turns out lumpy, after you mix the butter and flour, add add some of the hot stock mixture to it, stir until the mixture thins. Then add to the gravy. This will eliminate the lumps. Also important to use good quality meat and skim the sauce. Short ribs are fatty by nature and let's face it, fat equals flavor.

Really did not impress me. My husband loves short ribs but these had no special flavor....kind of dull. It was not the 'fatty' issue, we had good quality beef. Needed a kick, maybe a bit of mustard. I would try another recipe before I made this one again.

Wow~ This was perfect for me to impress a date. He loved the food and flavors. It's so easy to make, however it tastes like someone would have worked hours to prepare!!!

Being lazy, I cooked the zucchini from the beginning. They were a little mushy but held up well enough. This is absolutely delicious. Also, I used plum preserves instead of the other jelly. I can't wait to see what it tastes like in another day or two.

Used Costco's boneless short ribs and trimmed the fat before starting. Cooked it one day, cooled it down and removed the fat before reheating it the next day. Easy to make, tasty to eat. A winner with my family. Served with goat cheese,leek mashed potatoes once, farfalle another time

This sounded like a great combination of ingredients, but as others have commented, way too much fat! And we went to the best butcher in town. Very greasy cut of meat. Next time, I'll try using another cut, but definitely wouldn't use short ribs again.

Absolute perfection.

Very good success with the recipe. Suggestions: didn't use zucchini (felt it would be too mushy/watery), instead I quartered 5 small beets and roasted them in the oven with a few shallots and some of the juice. Just before the carrots were done, I combined them with the beets finished them in the oven. Secondly, I opted for mashed potatoes with 4 sauted shallots stirred in. I too decided to add some wild mushrooms to the onion/garlic saute step. Oh, and to make the gravy fool-proof... add a half cup of cold water to two table spoons of flour or corn starch (not the reverse) blend well, then add mixture to sauce over medium heat. Fantastic, and make sure you don't forget red wine!

Wonderful recipe but I too had problems with the gravy.

This was also my first short rib experience. The meat was good, but too fatty, so trim it carefully. I also had some problems when I added the flour, so I had to strain the sauce. I would recommend using more garlic.

I had never cooked short ribs before and was dissapointed with the amount of meat we had. (I halved the recipe.) Three of the four short ribs I purchased was nothing but fat. The short that had meat on it was tender and delicious. The pan sauce had a good intense flavor. My husband thought the carrots had a great flavor too. I made my beef broth from bouillon cubes, which saved a lot of time. I will probably make this again, but I will try to pick out leaner pieces of meat.

This recipe was delicious. I did, however, have a problem with the gravy at the end. The flour paste lumped up immediately and I couldn't get the sauce to thicken.

First of all I halved the recipe, except for the garlic. I made my own beef stock which is a major part of this recipe. The second major part are the short ribs. I purchased a little over two pounds of prime beef short ribs from our local specialty meat market, Morton's, in Sarasota. Two very important items are missing from this recipe. One I was fortunate to add and the second I will remember for next time, which is a loaf of crusty white bread for the sopping up of the wonderful sauce. The item I added was a half of pound of fresh shitake mushrooms. This recipe is wonderful and one that will be memorable for all who inbide.
