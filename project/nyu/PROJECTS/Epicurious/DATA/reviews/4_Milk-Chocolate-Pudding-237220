I added two additional tablespoons of sugar -- a good tip if you want a softer chocolate taste. The creamy mouthfeel of the pudding is very comforting on a brisk, autumn day.

Simple, easy, and delicious recipe. I substituted organic 2% milk instead of whole milk. I also substituted five ounces of semi sweet chocolate chips instead of chocolate bar. Would definitely make it again.

Found this recipe looking for something quick and homey that I could put together quickly. This hits the mark. I used good quality dark chocolate instead of milk and added a 1/2 teaspoon of instant espresso powder for depth of flavor. Fantastically deep dark chocolate flavor. If you thought that boxed instant pudding was good...try this. You'll be converted. I'm going to serve tonight with whipped cream and add a swirl of homemade caramel sauce.

Easy to make and definitely will again. As many have said it seems to be pretty flexible re: the milk/cream ratio. I used all whole milk and it's delicious. I used semi-sweet chips and found that perfect. For me using milk chocolate would be too sweet in this.

Nice, thick pudding, very chocolately taste. Very easy. Loved it with the whipped cream. Used semisweet chocolate chips, no chopping, melted just fine. Have all necessary items ready at hand, as one reviewer noted, you need it ASAP.

Very Good. I was inspired to try making pudding from scratch after ordering it at a local farm to table restaurant in the area. It was really neat watching it thicken as it boiled. Tastes great.

Made this with evaporated goats milk and dark/bittersweet chocolate. OMG! Love pudding and this is the best!

This pudding is so good and very easy to make. I have already made it several times.

This was exactly what I needed to fix that Chocolate craving. I omitted the Heavy Cream and increased the whole milk. I only did this because it didnt have the cream. I also preheated the milk in the microwave and then slowly added it to the dry incredients. No lumps. I also did not wait for it to cool. I enjoyed the pudding as soon as I pulled it off the fire. YUM

I didn't think the pudding was that great. I did use lo-fat milk but the rest was according to the recipe. I also found it too sweet. Maybe omitting the sugar would help.

What a delicious and easy pudding! I doubled the recipe for a large group and even substituted skim milk for half of the milk called for (and light cream for half of the cream instead of heavy cream) and it was delicious. It took all of 15 minutes to make and was a huge hit at the party. I used a mix of milk chocolate and dark chocolate pieces as I prefer the dark chocolate flavor. A key to making this delicious, I think, is good quality chocolate.

Wow! Delicious and so easy! I have never made pudding from scratch before, but after trying this recipe, I definitely will again. I didn't use whipped cream to accompany this pudding. You don't really need it, the pudding speaks for itself. YUM!

very easy and very good. I used 1 1/2 cups skim milk + 1/2 cup fat-free half and half. Also added some Kahlua. Did not have milk chocolate so used semi-sweet chocolate instead.

This was delicious, easy and fun to make. It does set very thick but a few quick stirs with a fork before serving loosens it up perfectly. Serving it with a small amount of whipped cream to be stirred in as you eat it also does wonders for the texture. I substituted half an ounce of bittersweet chocolate for that amount of milk chocolate since I liked the idea of milk chocolate pudding but am still more a dark chocolate person, and the result was just right to my taste. Oh, and I am all for portion control but no way does this make 6 servings in our household; it's much closer to 4.

i have made this pudding on many occasions and loved it. a skin develops on the finished pudding within 15 seconds, so constantly stir and have the saran wrap (i like saran wrap better than waxed paper for covering) ready to use asap. the pudding is also great warm.

This was utterly fantastic! I ended up using 1 cup of whole milk and .5 cup skim since I ran out and the only chocolate I had on hand which was Ghiradelli's 60% discs. It was amazingly delicious and I'm eager to make it again with the milk chocolate. I'm also planning to make it without the cocoa and with butterscotch chips. The recipe came together very quickly and easily. I didn't have problems with lumps as I used a roux whisk and made sure not to scrape the sides of the pan when I scraped the pudding into the ramekins I used. I felt like the recipe made 4 nice sized dessert portions; any more guests and I'd double the recipe.

This pudding is definitely quick and easy to make. The taste is also delicious. I'm giving the recipe 2 forks because I didn't love the consistency when I chilled it. It was too thick and gelatinous for my taste. I was hoping for a more pudding-like consistency.

Great Recipe! I made two batches...the first came out clumpy! When they say whisk they mean WHISK!

Although this tasted good, it came out so thick it was difficult to eat more than a couple of bites.

SOOOOOOOOOO easy and SOOOOOOOO quick. I made it with Camino organic 70% dark chocolate, and added about 2 tablespoons of cane sugar. Very tasty with some wipped cream.

I didn't have cocoa powder in the house and used a combination of Callebaut milk chocolate (a fair amount more than the recipe calls for), and semi sweet chocolate. It came out super yummy. Like a creamy chocolate bar. I did strain it when it came off the stove as I had some tiny lumps. After straining it was perfectly smooth.

It was really easy to make and pretty tasty. next time i would like to make it smoother.

This pudding was lovely - easy to make, nice texture, chocolate-y enough to satisfy the maniacs in my house. I just didn't think it was terribly interesting. It lacked zip.

Delicious, easy and fast! I used one 100g bar of Lindt milk chocolate and added 2 triangles of a large Toblerone bar for a little texture. Both the children and adults loved it. It is as good if not better than a chocolate mousse and much easier to make.

Like others, I used only milk (2%) and semi-sweet chips. The adults loved it. The kids found said "too much chocolate and not enough suger." Which makes it perfect in my book!

I loved it, but next time I will sift in the cornstarch, sugar, cocoa. I had lumps in my pudding.

delicious! i too used only milk (whole) and no cream and it turned out great. also used a mix of dark and milk chocolate and ground cinnamon and cayenne for a kick. i'm going to try it with soy milk for the lactose intolerant folks!

Great recipe and very easy. I used whole milk instead of cream and didn't miss it a bit. Also used high-quality dutch process chocolate and added a pinch of cinnamon and a 1/4 tsp of chipotle chile pepper at the end--it was terrific.

Very simple to make and delicious. I substituted Splenda for sugar and low carb milk for the milk. I used 4 tablespoons cocoa powder and left out the milk chocolate. Excellent results.

I gave this four forks because I used some Redstone's dark chocolate with chipotle that we didn't care for to eat directly but I used it for this recipe and it gave the pudding just a little punch and it became a dark chocolate instead of milk. I used Valrhonna cocoa powder as well.

i am queen of "use what i have on hand" improvisation when it comes to recipes. i used 1 1/2 c. skim, because i never buy anything else. i also added 2 t of Kahlua (more would be fine though), just for an added flavor. i think that rum, kahlua, or any of the godiva liquors would be delicious. i gave it 4 forks because its so easy and the flavor is very good.

Never make the box kind again! Super Easy to make and super yummy! I used semisweet chips - what i had and still great!

I needed something last minute I could bring to play group & this was perfect. (And Hershey's chocolate bars work in a pinch.) The kids loved it and all the mom's took the recipe home with them.

Even my kids could tell this was better than Jello pudding and I made it with bittersweet baking chocolate and extra milk instead of the cream -- there really is nothing like homemade...

This was just fine chocolate pudding, but to me it didn't taste so much better than a box mix. Maybe I didn't use good quality chocolate? (I used Scharffenberger milk chocolate). This had a fine flavor and texture and was not too sweet, but was nothing special. On the plus side, this was very quick to make!

Rating: 4
Amazing! This is so easy to make, and you don't have to use whole milk entirely - I've added some 1% and it comes out great. It's not too sweet and I like that there are no eggs and in the recipe. Most chocolate bars I've seen come in a 3.5 oz size; if you just use that amount of chocolate the recipe still comes out great.

I could not find whole milk, so used the skim I had at home - 1 cup skim and 1 cup cream to make up the difference. Used Callebaut milk chocolate. Easy to make, very smooth. Not too sweet, mild chocolate taste.
