OK, good, but not great. Couldn't even give it a delicious. I made it to recipe and unfortunately my husband was underwhelmed. Perhaps some tweaking could help....which then would require another try. we'll see.

Followed the recipe except I used about 2 teaspoons of garlic instead of a Tablespoon. It was not good. I had to force my self to take more that one bite. My husband could not finish either. It was lacking the clean refreshing flavors I love in Thai Cuisine. Pretty aweful.

I made this for Easter dinner as something different (a stretch from my normal carrot soup variations). It was a huge hit. Everyone asked for the recipe! Straining it was key, but I loved it cold and, the next day, warmed up (just to see what it was like). Will absolutely do again and again. My new summer must-go-to recipe!

Wow, rarely have I disagreed so strongly with a well reviewed recipe. I used very sweet baby watermelon and maybe that's where the problem was but I found this not only not good but nauseating.

Rating: 4
Okay, this is ridiculous. Ridiculously good and memorable. Fresh crab and lemongrass were not available, so subbed grilled shrimp (simply cooked, with olive oil, salt and pepper) and jarred sliced kaffir lime leaves; both worked beautifully. Can't imagine this hot; just seems unappetizing. Also, so you know, the consistency is thin, just like watermelon juice. Have learned from serving cold soups at dinner parties (LOVE cold soups) that some people just don't "get" cold soup, period, no matter how delicious. Will follow the advice of other reviewers and serve this cold, in Asian soup spoons, as an app.

Great recipe. Made it as written. Served it as part of a Thai menu, starting with Mango Shrimp Summer rolls, then this soup, then the main course was the Grilled Salmon with Thai Curry Sauce, all from this site. I served it cold and it was so refeshing. Awesome kick and great tang when you serve with limes on the side for squirting. Will definately make again.

Not sure what the Cook from Tampa's problem was--I've fixed this soup a number of times--for a wide range of palates--from teens to SERIOUS foodies from major metros--I've yet to have anything less than a "Wow" and calls for seconds.

This was really tasty..... medium level of difficulty in execution. Big taste. I did use a combination of muskmelon and cantaloupe instead of watermelon, used canned crab(I admit it)....otherwise followed the recipe mostly. I know this is a recipe site, but I like to thoroughly familiarize myself with the recipe, and then when I get to cooking, I don't really look at it anymore. Let your taste guide you on the seasonings, etc. Served this cold in tasting portions for a party and everybody ate it up fast! Make it spicy! Great stuff

Who would have guessed? This was an unusual recipe, so I was a little skeptical, but it was delicious. I used lemongrass from a jar, served it hot, and neglected to strain it. It was delicious, but I wish I had strained it - the texture of the aromatics was a little unpleasant. I will try it cold tomorrow. I may also splash in a little sesame oil - that sounds like a good addition.

Outrageously good. As when I first tasted this at a friend's house, none of my diners could guess the main ingredient. A bit labor-intensive, but well worth it. The first time I made it (with serrano chile) it was a bit bland. The next time, I substituted some crushed, dried chipotle chile and it gave it a nice smoky kick. This is a winner!

I've made this many times and always had good reviews and clean bowls. It's best if your guests like spicy foods, and I must confess I only serve it when I know my guests like thai food. The aromatics are essential as is the quality of the crab.

Delicious, I seved it with the crab but think that would be just as good without. I also drizzled some Ginger-Cilantro Raita (yogurt sauce) on top and it looked and tasted amazing! Got great reviews.

Delicious!!! This was the biggest hit of the year! Be careful, after one night in the freezer, the soup becomes much spicier! Will make again and again. Definitely serve cold with lots of the crab mix on top or with the soup poured around it. I don't like cilantro and this was delicious!

Delicious and refreshing soup. I didn't add the crab and served in daikiri glasses. Almost everybody loved it.

Heating this soup would be incredibly disrespectful to such fresh and nutritious ingredients. It is sooo hot here right now (and Thai flavours are perfect in hot or cold weather) that, when I tasted the cool soup, I decided to really chill it and serve as a sorbet - sensational! I didn't change a thing. Usually I would serve something like this with prawns (shrimp) but used excellent blue swimmer crab meat which matches the delicate watermelon component perfectly. Served portions on prechilled asian spoons and just kept dishing them up. The look on each face as they tasted each mouthful! Even impressed myself with this one.

This soup was fantastic. I added toasted sesame oil to the crab and a green onion. I cut back on the cilantro. Agree that extra lime juice in the soup is needed, and I added some to the crab as well. We ate it cold. Instant favorite.

I loved this recipe but I made a few changes. I added a lot more lime juice and more chilies. I also added lemon juice and zest to the crabmeat mixture. I really thought it was excellent and it got raved reviews.

This was almost cloyingly sweet. Out of a dinner party of eight, one person loved it, a few others thought it was pretty good, a couple thought it okay, and one person didn't care for it (although she loved the crab, which was very good quality).

I'm considering serving this at a cocktail party in chilled shot glasses, but I'm concerned the crab may sink to the bottom, making it difficult to drink. Any ideas?

This is my second time making it, with mango and watermelon the first time, and just watermelon this time. While I like it very much, I feel that it needs to be more acidic. I used two whole limes, a whole lemon, and a small splash of vinegar, but I think it still wants more *something*. I will probably add some diced grape tomatoes with the crab, a little extra lime, and maybe another splash of vinegar. It's good, as written, but with a little more oomph, it could be phenomenal. Next time, I will use mango again, with the watermelon, maybe six limes, and two lemons. A drizzle of sesame oil this time gave it a more full bodied flavor though.

I made a couple modifications to this recipe, based on what I had on hand. While I was prepping other ingredients, my son ate almost ALL of my watermelon, so I used two large mangos, plus enough watermelon to make five cups. The color and consistency were beautiful. After everything was blended, I had a nice fluffy mousse, so I did not bother with the sieve at all. I doubled up on the garlic, ginger, lemon grass, and shallot, and used the absolute SMALLEST serrano I could find (smaller than my pinkie), and discarded the seeds. I really don't care for hot foods, so I was worried that the chile would ruin the dish, but since I used such a small one, it lent good flavor, and once I chilled the soup, it was not overpowering at all, though definitely an overt presence. I used shrimp (steamed) instead of crab, maybe a pound to a pound and a half, but in the future, would like to use more. Maybe next time I'd try mixed seafood. I used two whole limes over all this time, but would use more next time. Also, I don't normally use salt in anything, but found the salt was necessary to pick up the sweetness in this, since the mangos I used were very tart. Even though I made so many changes, I loved the results every step of the way, and would even just make the base soup without crab or shrimp for a vegetarian variation. I think this would taste great over sesame marinated tofu, or shredded raw veggies instead of the crab or shrimp. Even my six year old son enjoyed this, and though I had hoped to share this with my neighbors, they will have to wait until the next time I make it, because it's disappearing WAY too fast! I feel like this would be a tough recipe to mess up, since it's so simple to vary the flavors and amounts according to personal taste. I would highly recommend it to the greenest beginning cook and experienced chef alike.

I've made this several times -- always great! This time I didn't have watermelon, so I used mostly cantaloupe and a bit of yellow watermelon. The cantaloupe was a worthy subsitution - I'll definitely use it in the future. Tasted great, and the cantaloupe added some body. Plus the color was gorgeous -- a rich orange/yellow. Also, when I have extra melon I just double or triple the batch. The soup freezes well (without the crab, of course). This is a truly wonderful dish. Yum!!!

I think this soup is delightful. It's a lot of fun at dinner parties because it's so inventive. Be forewarned though -- I find that 5 cups of watermelon is about 1/2 of a tiny 4lb pure heart watermelon.

High marks for originality! I accidentally bought imitation crab (I swear it didn't say imitation anywhere on the package) so that part wasn't so good, but the soup was great. I'm going to serve it in mini portions as a pre-appetizer (the way they do in fancy restaurants (there must be a proper name for these, but I don't know it)).

I'm going to put this as politely as possible: This was completely inedible! I followed the recipe meticulously, and I expected for the end result to be fabulous, because I love Thai food, I love watermelon, I love crabment, and I love cold soup.I don't know how to describe it, but the flavors just did not go together. I tasted the watermelon very vividly, and I tasted the rest of the soup very vividly. The flavors just didn't mix.Very rarely have I ever made a dish that I had to throw out, but this was one of those occasions. Next time, I'll eat the watermelon the way I really like it: cold, salted, and on the rind.

WOW!! It's absolutely fantastic. Incredible. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I made a few minor changes for mine: -Add 1/2 of a very ripe mango to the watermelon puree stage. -Substitute 1/2 galangal and 1/2 ginger for all ginger at the sautee stage. Also, add two keffir leaves, sliced up, to the sautee. -Use two cherry peppers instead one one serrano pepper. The color will be better! -Add a little extra fresh lime juice. -Add a handful of fresh mint when you put it in to chill, then strain it out before serving. -Chill at least 4 hours. -Add one big fat scallion, very thinly sliced, to the crab mixture.

This is probably the best soup I've ever had! I served 1/2 hot and 1/2 cold, and the cold was the winner by a landslide. The only adjustments I made were to add 1T more lime juice and the zest of 1/2 a lime. Absolutely fabulous and refreshing with a little kick!!

This was fabulous! Made it on the last night of the horrible heat wave we got from Hurricane Rita. I didn't strain it at the end because everything was so well pulverized by my blender and I added some fish sauce at the end, but other than that followed the instructions exactly. Very simple to make and totally divine! Had leftover soup, but no more crab, so I added some tofu for lunch the next day. Yum!

I was looking for a cold soup to go with my Asian menu, and couldn't find any other cold soup recipes. Up to the point of serving, I was sceptical. The guests loved it! Very unusual and refreshing. I put the garlic, ginger, shallots and chilli in a food processor, and added a couple of kaffir lime leaves to the spice mixture, and served it with prawns instead of crab. If you are looking for an unforgettable soup that is easy to prepare, this is it!

I initially had reservations about this soup, but I made it anyway for a last minute dinner party because, serendipitously, I had all the ingredients on hand (except fresh lemon grass -- I used powdered and it did fine. Not my first choice but okay in a pinch). Based on another review, I used the whole serrano and I was careful not to use more watermelon than the recipe called for. I found it to be a very easy recipe and no more time consuming (minus the crab peeling time) than any other pureed soup I've made. Anyway, it was a huge hit with my foodie friends, none of whom were able to guess the watermelon. This will definitely make it into my summer menu rotation.

Very good, and different, soup. But could use more heat (used half a serrano) to cut the sweetness of the watermelon. The crab mixture is great in it too, in fact I really thing it would be too much watermolon taste without it! Definetly good cold, didnt try it warm, but I think that it wouldnt be quite as tasty

My dinner guests RAVED! One guest said it was the best soup he had ever had. I served it chilled, and the only substitutions I made were to use canola oil as suggested by a previous reviewer, and to use lime basil instead of cilantro, which was not available at my supermarket. Even though I had an incident with the blender(I tried to process too much soup at one time), I would make this soup again based on how happy my guests were! Try this if you are looking for something different, delicious and beautiful to look at!

I agree that this is a very tasty soup especially on a hot summer day. Didn't fool any of my dinner guests when it came to guessing the base ingredient. No one ranted and raved about the soup, though it could have been my choice of dinner guests, but no one left any in their bowls either. Go figure.

This is a wonderful recipe. I prefer it cold to warm. I made two changes. (1) I think olive oil is a really wierd choice for this asian influenced recipe so I recommend a more neutral oil (I used canola), peanut would in my opinion be too strong flavored for the delicate watermelon flavor. (2) Because it is Thai inspired, I added the quintesential (along with lemongrass) Thai spice: Galangal. I added about 1 Tbs. finely chopped along with the other aromatics and it was wonderful. You can get Galangal (if you don't have a Thai market) from templeofthai.com.
