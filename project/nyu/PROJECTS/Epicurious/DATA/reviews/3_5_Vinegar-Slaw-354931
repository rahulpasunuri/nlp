A tasty slaw that holds some of its crunch even the next day. The fennel is a nice alternative to cabbage. One note on preparation: I cut the fennel bulb in half down the center so I could use my mandolin and I'd recommend cutting the onions into half moon slices so they combine more easily with the carrots and fennel.

This slaw works is delicious in combo with the smoked chicken/hoe cakes. Otherwise, I don't think I would serve it - but I will admit to having a preference for creamy slaw.
