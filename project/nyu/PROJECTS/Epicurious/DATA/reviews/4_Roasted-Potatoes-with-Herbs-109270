Great, simple go-to recipe. I used dried herbs (in smaller quantities) tossed in with the oil and it worked fine. I would use less salt next time though, as I found it too much. Perhaps start with half when tossing, and then adjust to taste after cooking is finished.

This was my first time boiling potatoes before roasting and they came out pretty good. I used yukon gold and purple. I think I had boiled them for too long, so I decided to only roast them for 35 minutes. I tossed with oil, salt and pepper before roasting and then sprinkled with parsley before serving. They were pretty perfectly cooked and semi-crisp.

I made these as a side for brunch. Everyone liked them. I used dried herbs instead of fresh, and added them with the oil. It was fine. Will make again!

These are so easy and so versatile. The yukon golds are key -- they are so creamy and don't dry out and get mealy like other potatoes. I did boil them for a few minutes and then roasted. I think it did help to keep them from drying out while roasting. I roasted them for 40 mins at 400 and then 15 at 450 and left them sitting in the turned off oven while I poached some eggs and made a green salad. They are crispy and delicious. Don't be afraid of the crispy bits! The crunch shallot bits were lovely. I added the fresh herbs and some dried Herbes de Provence and I cubed the potatoes instead of cutting them in wedges. And kosher salt sprinkled all over the top made them killer for our "breakfast for dinner" weeknight meal.

I used yukon gold potatoes, boiled them first and roasted for 35 plus 15 minutes. The potatoes were delicious but overcooked. I wonder if the cooking time has to be varied according to the freshness of the potaoes or to the type of pan being used. Also, my shallots and garlic were much overdone. Next time I will add them half way thru the roasting.

For color variation I used combo of reds, yukons,and purple potatoes. Doubled recipe and subbed fresh rosemary for thyme. Great recipe!

Realized that I forgot to specify... I added the parsley and thyme with everything else... tossed all together and then put in the oven. I also cooked them a bit longer stovetop before putting them in the oven. They turned out perfectly beautiful! Just made again the same way and had the same results.

These potatoes are AWE-SOME! I made these last night with seared filet mignon with satueed mushrooms and caprese salad. Delish! I skipped the thyme though, just used the parsley after they came out of the oven. The shallots and the outside of the potates get crispy, so good! Definitely making these again and again!

My family loved these. Definitely use the gold potatoes - they tasted creamy on the inside. Add the herbs at the end as suggested by the other reviewers. Will definitely make again. The shallots add great flavor.

So quick and easy, and so flavorful. Yukon Golds are naturally sweet and tender, so wonderful paired with shallots and roasted. I used parsley but no thyme since I'm not a fan of it, and these were simple and delicious.

This recipe rates the best because it's simple, looks elegant and is delicious. Be sure to not add the parsley and thyme until the last step. I've used green onions and they work well too. I highly recommend these scrumptious potatoes.

Excellent, though they should have had longer in the oven, more like an hour. Terrific, basic, combination of flavors.

These are delicious. They are easy to make. We served them at a recent dinner party with beef and they were a hit! I used a bit less salt though.

This recipe is wonderful- the crispiness you get without frying is great, and the potatoes are very tender inside. Perfect side dish for meat or chicken!

I liked this recipe a lot, and I agree with other people that the parboiling makes a big difference. I usually cover the potatoes for the first 20 or so minutes of baking so that they steam a little bit and cook better, but I think I'll do this from now on. I'm thinking that I might also throw a few garlic cloves in there next time.

I love this recipe. I make it all the time. The only change I make is that I add about 2 large cloves of fresh garlic, because everything's better with garlic!

Was without fresh herbs , but a sprinkling of Herbes de Provence was very good. Let warm in the oven waiting for the lamb to grill, and think it would be a little better if served earlier.

A yummy potato dish. I didn't have thyme so I used fresh rosemary instead which I loved.

WOW! This has to be the best roasted potatoe recipe I have ever used. It took mind potatoes a bit longer than 55 minutes but well worth the wait. I would highly suggest this recipe to even a novice cook. SIMPLE!!!!!

Love, love, love this recipe: this is my standard potato recipe to serve with salmon to steak to almost anything. With regards to the problem of the finished potatoes being dry: I usually mix the potatoes in with the olive oil after I put them on their baking sheet, and they come out beautifully.

Hmmm...I followed this one verbatim...and I just feel like it was a swing and a miss. The herbs got bitter even though I didn't roast as long as written, and the 'tatoes were a bit dry. Just not the flavor I was looking for.

The fresh herbs and course ground salt really make these better than your average roasted potatoes. I also used flat-leaf parsley, and added a bit fresh garlic. I do recommend making them ahead (except the roasting part) so the seasoning and oil can really soak in. Also, I highly doubt I used as much salt as called for and they were plenty salty -- I'd use less up front and then add more as needed at the end. I ate the leftovers for breakfast this morning, and mmmmm.

I love this recipe. I've used several different kinds of potatoes for it and every time it turned out wonderfully. I usually cut the pieces of potato pretty small, and reduce the roasting time. I also add crushed garlic, since everything is better with garlic!

I had high expectations of this dish after reading the reviews. I followed the recipe exactly as written and was not impressed. They were OK, but nothing special. They never got really crispy, just semi-crisp. I know it isn't my oven so I am not sure what the deal was. There are many better recipes out there.

Parboiling the potatoes is completely unnecessary. Use Yukon Gold potatoes, no subtitute for these. Roasting time can be drastically shortened. I had crisp tender potatoes in about 35 mins. or so. Fresh herbs are an absolute must. I used fresh rosemary because I like that better than thyme. I will try fresh sage next time. These potatoes will be served a lot in my house.

I make this dish often, two to three times a week. I use "new" potatoes and cut them in half. It is very delicious. I do believe boiling first makes a significant difference, as it allows for the interior of the potato to cook before roasting, which in turn helps develop a nice, crusty exterior. I then roast at 450 degrees for 25 minutes. The result: a creamy interior and a crunchy skin. I do suggest, however, adding the potatoes to the pot before bringing to a boil, and then simmering for 6-8 minutes (do not boil), before roasting.

I made this recipe skipping the boiling part and roasting the whole time with the potato wedges flat on the roasting pan and then rotating the potatoes to the other side when I added the herbs. Make sure your pan is well oiled. ABSOLUTELY Delicious! I used fresh tarragon, parsley and a little rosemary and kosher salt. A real keeper.

This was very easy and delicious. I skipped the boiling part and roasted the potatoes longer. That seemed to work out fine. This is a good and easy substitute for mashed potatoes.

This was an easy recipe that I partially made the night before and used rosemary instead of thyme. The rosemary was beautiful as well. It allowed me less time in the kitchen on Easter, and was a hit with the guests. I also was able to have it with breakfast as leftovers!

Even though I used dried thyme instead of fresh herbs, these were some of the best potatoes ever! After boiling the potatoes, I refrigerated them overnight with the shallots, olive oil, salt and pepper. Somehow it seemed to infuse the potatoes with flavor. Yum. A definite keeper.

The Yukon Golds, shallots, kosher salt, pepper, and olive oil make this recipe. Herbs are sort of redundant (to this palate at least).

These potatoes were really very good, even though I forgot to add the herbs. I am remaking them, with the herbs to check the difference, I am also going to try a more even shape than wedges, as I did not care for the fact that part of each potato piece was more/less done than others.

Awesome! I somehow did not end up with shallots after my trip to the grocery store, so I improvised with about a dozen garlic cloves cut in half. Very, very good. Boiling the potatoes beforehand gives them a different (better) texture; I would not omit this step.

This was great and very easy. Boiling the potatoes first does make a difference, I think. I agree with the poster below about the salt. I love salt, but found these a tad too salty. I would cut down on the salt. In terms of the herbs, I just threw on some herbs de provence before flipping them, and it was great.

Wow. We did boil the potatoes first, as the recipe calls for, and these were just unreal. I already thought I had a never-to-be-beaten roasted potato recipe. but this trumped that easily. I didn't do the herbs at the end, to be honest just forgot, but they didn't seem to be missing anything. I served them with flank steak with a soy-chile glaze and spinach sauteed with garlic & chili pepper flakes. Yum. HIGHLY recommended.

These are the BEST potatoes. If you skip the boiling part you end up with yummy roasted potatoes but the boiling does something that makes these the crispiest, yummiest ever. The 1 cup of shallots seems weird till you see what happens when they cook. You end up with shallot cracklings! I wish there was a good picture here. I love salt and they were just a touch too salty but otherwise perfect. These go well with anything including breakfast. Mmmmmm

This was an excellent side dish for our rib eye steaks, I broiled the steaks in the oven and fixed broccoli with garlic and pecrino romano cheese. I shortened the baking time for the potatoes for the shallots were burning, next time I will skip the boiling of the potatoes

The previous cook is right; there is no need to boil the potatoes before roasting. I do, however, agree with the given cooking time, esp. if you like your potatoes a little on the crispy side. Equally delicious with any type of potato. A little butter never hurts, either. Make sure you stir them around a couple of times. Can also be cooked on the grill, using a higher edged aluminum pan (cheap, disposable type). Good, easy, and crowd pleasing.

I made the menu items: Mediterranean Chicken, Spinach and Roasted Red Pepper Gratin, and this for dinner for my husband and I. What a great dinner and definitely company worthy. I don't think it is necessary to boil the potatoes first since you're roasting them. Also, the roasting time is way too long for potato wedges.
