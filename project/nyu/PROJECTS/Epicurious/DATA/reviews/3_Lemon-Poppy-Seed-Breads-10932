This is my go-to holiday gift bread. There are two keys to the success of this bread - poking holes and using all the syrup, and wrapping them tightly afterwards. I always double the recipe, and bake it for minimal amount of time. I freeze them, too, individually wrapped and then in sealed bags. Gets raves all the time! I don't understand the "too dry" reviews!

I've made this for special occasions since the recipe first appeared. So glad to see it on-line, since my pencilled copy is so old! The trick is to poke lots of holes in the breads and saturate them with the lemon syrup, which makes them quite moist and tart. It's better than any lemon poppy seed confection I've ever bought and always gets rave reviews.

I put the batter all in one loaf pan instead of 4 individual loaf pans because I didn't have small loaf pans and I didn't want small loaves anyway. As a result, I didn't use all of the syrup. The bread was a bit dry -- perhaps because I didn't use all of the syrup. My guests though put cream cheese and butter on it and seemed to be pleased with it.

I agree with the other reviewers that this recipe makes a rather dry bread.I did add additional milk as suggested, but also think it might have too much flour in it( compared to other bread recipes). It tastes only slightly lemony, so I probably won't make it again.

I was inspired to seek out this recipe after I had delicious lemon, poppy, almond muffins at my office. In trying to recreate the flavor of these muffins I replaced the vanilla extract in this recipe with almond extract, which worked out wonderfully. I didn't care for the lemon syrup and will omit it next time. I may have to fiddle with the butter or milk quantities to keep it from being too dry w/o syrup, I shall see. I also replaced half the butter with unsweetened applesauce (low fat baking trick) and it was still very delicious.

I really liked this. It was dense, which I enjoy, but not dry in my opinion. I think actually poking the holes in the bread and pouring the glaze into it as described in the recipe contributes a lot of moistness. I almost skipped the poking and just drizzled the glaze over the bread- I'm glad I didn't. Note: I used about double the poppy seeds (love them), a tad more vanilla, and confectioners rather than granulated sugar in the glaze.

I would have to agree w/the others that said this recipe was sort of dry. I too added more milk & have decided to try doubling the milk next time I make it. Definitely a keeper! Have a great day & an even better tomorrow!

Very good -- split recipe into two regular loaf pans and reduce time by about 5 minutes for full sized loaves

It is pretty dry. I added additional milk and it still came out dryer then I like.

I have been making this recipe every holiday season since it first appeared in Gourmet. It is absolutely one our favorites (especially my kid brother). It is well worth the effort.

This bread has a nice flavor, however, mine came out a bit dry. I'll try it again with more milk and see if a I get a moister bread, and decrease the baking time a bit.

Every holiday I search for new bread recipes to send as gifts to my friends on the east coast. I was so excited to find this one and made some trial loaves to take to work for my co-workers who absolutely loved them. I did have to add a bit more milk than what was called for because the batter was so thick!

This is a wonderful recipe! I usually make the topping a little sweeter by adding more sugar and less lemon juice.

One of the best breads I have ever made. Great for holiday giving.
