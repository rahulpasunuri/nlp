This is a great way to eat scallops! I have to admit - I didn't go all the way with making ham stock, but substituted bacon. I sautéed the cabbage and kale in about a TBSP of the bacon grease, then added the cooked bacon back to the greens after simmering in some chicken stock and white wine. I just used plain Quaker Grits, not instant or quick cooking. The combination of the creamy grits, bacon- seasoned greens and tender sweet scallops was absolute heaven. I didn't give it 4 forks because I altered the recipe. Next time I make I'll make the ham stock and revisit the rating.
