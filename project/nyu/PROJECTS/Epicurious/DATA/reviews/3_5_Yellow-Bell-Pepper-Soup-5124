Hi my name is Diana and I tried this recipe for my cooking club. I think the problem below with needing to strain the soup is solved with a really good quality blender. I used my VitaMix on high speed and ran it a long time until I could not see any more bits of browned pepper skin. It turned out very smooth. Also I made one pot of red pepper soup and one pot of yellow pepper soup as others have suggested. I added 1-3 T dry Sherry to each and a bit of salt and pepper, and was amazed at the improvement. My yellow pepper soup was much less flavorful than my red pepper soup, so I "brightened" the yellow up very successfully with some fresh squeezed lemon juice. I am making this soup in early April, with grocery store peppers, so maybe when peppers are more seasonal and from local producers they would yield deeper flavors (and be less expensive.) As it was, the results were very rewarding and tasty. The "swirling" looked pretty cool too, though I will need to practice some more to get an artful presentation. This is a delightful soup, very simple ingredients and subtle pleasing taste.

Am I the only one who had to strain this soup? The pepper skins rolled up into thin bits that were not pleasant in the mouth. Delicious soup though - used only yellow peppers (store bought).

Forgot to mention, have made this recipe many times, I only garnish with a slight cream swirl (when I don't use half red peppers and half yellow peppers to swirl) but add no cream and find it way more flavourful, and fat free. Love this recipe.

This soup was absolutely horrible and a waste of my garden-grown yellow bell peppers. It's the after taste that I couldn't handle. I tried everything to counteract the bitter aftertaste, and nothing helped.

I was "testing" this for a possible T-giving soup. It was good - I took other reviewers advice and did the red and yellow pepper combo for a great presentation. I found the end result a tiny bit bland and found that a little salt and some thyme did the trick. I also like the idea of adding sherry instead of sugar. My peppers were very large and maybe not as flavorful?

This recipe was very good and quick and easy to make. Based on people's suggestions to use red peppers, I made half the recipe with red peppers and half with yellow peppers. I then served it with a yellow pepper base and then swirled in the red pepper soup. Sprinkled with the parsley, it makes a great presentation for a party.

Wow, I served it as part of a seven course dinner, it was amazing. Truly was elegant and flavourful. Incredibly easy to make, the peppers take a bit of time to chop. I used less half and half and drizzled a tablespoon of cream over it as garnish with parsley on top. Tasty!!!!!!!

This soup is very interesting. I used yellow and orange peppers. Be careful not to burn the peppers (as I did in my new gas oven) or there will be black flecks floating in the soup. I also added a little more sugar to cut down on the bitterness. My partner said the soup was "Different." I would definetly make this again.

This is one of the most delicious soups I have ever had the pleasure to meet. I used yellow and orange peppers, and found it to be an 'extra easy' recipe. I sub'ed sherry for the sugar. Froze it solid, threw it in the picnic cooler, and we ate it happily at camp 2 days later. Roughing it at it's best ! (p.s. homemade chicken broth makes it extra special.)

Delicious! Made using red bell peppers with fantastic results! Served to guests (4 total) and had only one bowl leftover. Definitely a keeper!

Works wonderfully with red bell peppers! Excellent dish, though quite time consuming so plan ahead.

This soup is best made the day before serving. It is a fabulous and an elegant addition to light flavored dishes. Additional sugar may be added if the soup is a little bitter for your taste. Of course, you must also use fresh ground pepper. It also freezes well for later use.
