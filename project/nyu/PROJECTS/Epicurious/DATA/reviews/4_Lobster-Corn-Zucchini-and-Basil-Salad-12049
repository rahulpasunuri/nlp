We've had a few sales on lobster in our area lately, so I've been experimenting with a bunch of different lobster recipes. I like this one because the lobster really is the star. If you decide to pare down the recipe, make sure you really cut back on the veggies & mayo. Otherwise the lobster won't be the main attraction.
