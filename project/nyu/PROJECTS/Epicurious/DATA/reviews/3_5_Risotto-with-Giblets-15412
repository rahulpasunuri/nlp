What can I say? This is a catastrophe. Making a risotto with a soffritto of carrot, etc. sounded intriguing, but it adds a sweet vegetable element that doesn't go at all with the meaty gizzards. And a cup of wine? after an hour's cooking, I could still taste the tang. The method is also nutty - luckily I've made dozens of risottos...but really. Last, and certainly least - that's not the correct Italian spelling. It's rigaglie.

Okay, I am pretty confused by this recipe as written. What happens to the sauteed vegetable/wine/broth mixture after you remove the giblets with a slotted spoon? And does the tomato get added without being cooked at all? I feel like there must be a step or two left out.

Used this recipe for some friends that were visiting and they raved. However being trained old fashion I made the rice in the broth w/the giblets, if served when ready rice is not gummy or starchy, but creamy. Using sweet rice is also something I tired and it worked well.

I rave about this risotto. The sauce was perfect. It would also be delicous with pasta. A great choice for this year's Passover in Italy. I used Chianti and left out the tomatoes. Rich and lovely. Just wonderful.

In response to the kosher question: It is the fat that surrounds the organs and liver that isn't kosher, not the organs themselves- once the fat is removed, it is kosher to eat. Please refer to http://www.jewfaq.org/kashrut.htm, and scroll down to "Forbidden Fats and Nerves" for more details.

In the intro to these recipes, it is said that they are all kosher, but I thought that giblets - and in particular, livers - are explicitly NOT kosher... ??

I've made this recipe a few times, with slight variations due to what ingredients I had on hand. This is the best way I know to use those cheap gizzards! Truly delicious!

We loved this, after slight modification. I used just gizzards and hearts, not livers, and adapted accordingly. Good earthy flavors, so I'm thinking of next time including some wild mushrooms for even more earthiness, making it a perfect match-up with a good Pinot Noir.
