These were a hugh hit w/ my friend's children! I wrapped them each in small holiday cello gift bags & tied w/ holiday ribbon. They are easy to make and so delicicous & everyone loved them! Williams-Sonoma's Chocolat-Filled Peppermint Snaps work great for the candy crunch too!

I made these in the summer when strawberries were in season so I substituted strawberry ice cream for the peppermint ice cream in the recipe. I was short on time so I crushed fresh strawberries and mixed them into a pint of Hagen Daz strawberry ice cream along with a little sour cream and these were really wonderful.

It was slightly messy and did not look as good as the picture, but was still pretty good. Don't be afraid to crush the candy finely, I was a little impatient on that part and some larger chunks of the candy slipped in and were slightly harder to chew.

I made a few changes to these and they were still delicious. I had some great peppermint ice cream from a local place so I used that. Also, I couldn't find the chocolate wafers the recipe called for so I used some thin sugar cookie wafers instead and it was still delicious. It was a little difficult to have the ice cream at a scoopable temperature while making the sandwiches quickly enough before the ice cream melted. that made them messier to put together and wrap but they still tasted great.
