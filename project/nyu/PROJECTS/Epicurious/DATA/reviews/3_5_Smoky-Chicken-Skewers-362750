I turned this in to a marinade by adding a little more olive oil, a teaspoon of garlic and about a tablespoon of white wine vinegar. It sat for about 4 hours and I left the tenders whole then put them on the grill. Both my husband and I would do this again.

Nice flavor combinations. Next time will probably marinate in sauce a few hours before cooking and THEN continue to baste.
