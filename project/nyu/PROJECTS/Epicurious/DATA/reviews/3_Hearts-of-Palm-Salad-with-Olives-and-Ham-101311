I made this for some non-meat eating friends so I skipped the ham. I used sliced green olives, and added some chopped onions and chopped red pepper, and I used a very fruity extra virgin olive oil. It came out delicious and everyone asked about it. I've already made this twice and will definitely make it again and again. It's a keeper.

I did not follow this precisely but got a good idea of what it is, and it's quite good. One garlic clove was quite sufficient, thank you. I added a chopped tomato and half the olives, and served this lovely mixture over baby greens. I do think the greens would have benefitted from being lightly dressed themselves.

An excellent quick and easy salad, with an exotic overtone. The dressing and olives stimulates the palate while the hearts of palm and ham provide the body to this exciting dish.

I added a julienned red pepper and a scallion and it turned out wonderful!

I think the acid to oil balance may be a little off for the dish. Six tablespoons of oil is too much. Use virgin olive oil or it may taste a little heavy. It is quick and easy.
