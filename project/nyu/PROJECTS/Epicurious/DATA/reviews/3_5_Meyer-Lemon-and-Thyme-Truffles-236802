I was hesitant about not straining so I chopped the thyme very finely and it was perfect. Bring cream to boil with zest and thyme. Used zest of two lemons and it was to die for.

I made these last year and they were incredible. I will be making them again this week and heartily recommend them. This makes a very special gift.

Really nice - I used ground thyme, slightly less than called for because I figured it would permeate more than chopped, but it was still pretty thyme-y. Couldn't taste the lemon very much. But very pleasant truffles - a very sophisticated flavour.

These are really wonderful. I followed the first reviewer's advice: brought the thyme and lemon almost to boil a couple of times, and used less cream. A generous 1 c. was PLENTY. I ground the thyme very fine to avoid chewy bits. Also added a bit more Meyer lemon juice and tons of zest. Then froze truffles and covered them in lukewarm white chocolate, and garnished with lemon peel. They are fabulous, just perfect. The flavors come out at separate times, meaning you can really savor the truffle.

I have a hard time following recipes because I like to try and add things that sound good. I love citrus sweets, but thought of this as lending itself better to a white chocolate ganache. And I also wanted to add sourcream for flavor. You can't really cut the cream as you need to steep the thyme in it, which I finely chopped, so I added extra thyme and lemon zest (which I also added at the end because wanted it to retain it's freshness) along with maybe 3/4 more chocolate to keep it the correct consistancy. I also added some fleur de sal at the very end to the ganche and tried not to stirr it too much, to pop the flavor and add another surprise.

I made four kinds of truffles for the holidays this year, and these got the most votes. I made the truffle centers according to the recipe and after tasting decided it need more flavor, so I doubled the lemon and also added some limoncello liqueur. I wasn't sure whether the thyme should be strained out but the recipe didn't say to, so I left it in. It leaves you with little chunks of thyme leaves in your mouth after chewing the truffles, which is a little weird but the flavor is good.

I enjoy trying new and unique recipes, so this one caught my eye. The recipe was perfect in terms of consistency - the truffles formed well and the cacao nibs looked beautiful. Unfortunately, the nibs along with the 70% chocolate made for a much more bitter truffle than I prefer. I thoroughly enjoy artisan chocolates and until now, the darker the better, but these were not for me. Hopefully you all have better luck!

SO delicious! The flavors are very nicely layered. The lemon is so sweet and mild, it imparts the perfect lemon flavor without any of the tartness. According to my husbamd, "It was like eating a bowl of sunshine!" Once you get through the lemon flavor, the thyme gently starts to come through. So good! I made a few adjustments: Used a generous 1 c. of cream (it held up much better than 1 1/4 c.). Brought the thyme and the lemon zest almost to a boil three times (per the Robert Linxe recipe on this site), letting it steep for a few minutes between each heating. Also didn't bother to melt the chocolate beforehand. I just added the hot (not lukewarm) cream to all the chopped chocolate. Texture was fantastic, and the truffles set up quite nicely. Make this - you'll love it!
