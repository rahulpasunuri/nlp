I made this cake for my father's birthday and it was a HIT!!! The outcome was an elegant cake, with perfect texture and absolutely delicious!!!

I made this recipe once and it was amazing-- light, perfect cake texture, delicious, and elegant. I've tried to make it 2-3 times since then, and every time it's come out dense, heavy, and overly wet. I can't figure out what I've been doing differently and wrong, but I think that accounts for the difference in opinion here between some thinking it's wonderful and others thinking it's more like bread pudding. If anyone has ideas on how to guarantee the lighter texture, I'd love to hear them!

I made this cake in 2 tiers for a fall wedding reception. It is substantial sitting on a fork. I decorated it with ribbon,sugared persimmons, and pecans in the shell--easy for a novice like me. Guests were impressed and all plates were empty!

LOVED this cake! It was moist & delicious. Had it with a cup of homemade chai & it made my night! However I made a number of substitutions. Doubled the spices, like others suggested. Added nutmeg & grated fresh ginger (no all spice on hand, & sliced almonds. Then I used canned pumpkin and applesauce (roughly 1.5 cups of each) instead of the two apples. When I made the frosting, I did not use cream cheese & substituted apple juice for 80% of the milk (milk for the rest) for more of a glaze.

I agree completely with the cook from Frederick, MD. This cake was fine, but not worth the effort. The texture was heavy and dense, but not in a pleasant way. Moist yes, but almost like the cake wasn't cooked enough. Leaden. I wish the recipe included a more precise apple measurement since liquid makes such a big difference in a cake recipe. Less apple might improve the texture of the cake. Also, I found the cake bland. It tasted of apples, but not much else. I would double the salt, add more spices and probably add some more sugar as well. The icing was the best part, it had the creaminess of a buttercream with the tang of cream cheese and the perfect sweetness. I'll probably make the icing again, b/c it's the best ratio of butter to cream cheese I've found. But I'm not going to bother with the cake again. It was a waste of time, effort and ingredients.

yummy cake. easy to make. not time consuming. only changes I made was that I used dried cranberries instead of currants and substituted 2 pears for two of the apples in the applesauce. I would not serve it as a birthday or special occasion cake. while it is delicious it is a bit homely

I also used pears as I had extras on hand. I also made it in advance and froze the cake. I needed more icing that the recipe called for. All told, it was a huge hit. I thought the walnuts were only fair -- not worth the effort. The cake itself is moist and tasty. Definitely will try with apples.

Well received by guests, and a great way to use up some of the apples (Cortland, Baldwin, Cox's Orange Pippin) my sons amassed at a pick-your-own orchard. I followed the recipe almost exactly. The cooked apples came to 2 cups, which seemed to be a good amount. I cut back on butter by a few tablespoons, put in a little extra of each of the spices, and added in a handful of dried cranberries as well as the currents and walnuts. The cake *is* dense. I wouldn't call it "elegant" as someone else did. Seems more of a cake I'd cook for family, not for a special event. I am not a big fan of cream cheese frosting and would eat the cake alone, personally. The boys liked the frosting though. Another thing, I thought the sugared walnuts were a snap to make, and my eaters also liked them.

Moist, delicious, fresh, and attractive. Big hit with the ladies book club. I reduced the sugar (in cake & icing) as it was a little too sweet the 1st time I made it. Substituted raisins for the currents. It doesn't rise very high but still looks and tastes great. I'll not candy the walnuts on top next time, just use plain roasted walnuts instead. I tend to like a natural flavor, not an overly sweet flavor. Served it with cool whip ,a stemmed cherry, and a Fall colored leaf for a very nice presentation. It's not as complicated to make as it looks. Worth the effort!

Moist and flavorful, instructions look daunting but was actually very easy to make. This is a substantial cake, very filling. Everyone at work told me this was their favorite cake I have brought in to date!

I made this cake for a co-worker's birthday and everyone who tried it raved about it. I used 4 apples as the recipe states and then I added two pears as well (since they are currently in season). I doubled the frosting recipe as someone suggested and I had plenty to spare. The cake was moist and delicious. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Fabulous! I made this with pears instead since we had a bumper crop of them this year. The cake turned out wonderfully moist and flavorful.

The people I served this to said they really liked it, but I was underwhelmed. The texture was more like a fruitcake and the flavors were too subtle -- definitely needs more spices. The icing, which was delicious, barely covered the cake -- I'd double it next time. Finally, the candied walnuts were time-consuming and not worth it -- I'd either buy them or just use toasted walnuts the next time. But, there won't be a next time because it just wasn't that good.

Really like this cake. Adapted a bit by reducing butter to 1/2 cup, increasing the amount of the spices (twice the stated amount) and adding 2 tsp. ground ginger. Also reduced sugar a bit and instead of all white, substituted 1/4 brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. This turned into a great and very flavorful cake that keeps well and freezes well. I just baked it in a bundt form and never iced it. Really doesn't need icing, but would make it extra special.

We LOVE this cake. It's a keeper. I used 4 Granny Smith apples - couldn't find the Jonagold. Decreased the sugar to 1 cup - we don't like overly sweet treats. The reduction in sugar didn't cause any problems and I will always make that modification in the future when making this recipe. The frosting is the best ever. It is very rich - but not wildly "sweet" which is good. I did not make the cinnamon sugar walnuts.

I took this cake to my hiking group's potluck lunch. Everyone raved about it. I used golden delicious apples from my tree, just stirring them with a fork after cooking them. I substituted raisins for the currants and baked it in a rose-shaped bundt pan. I had to cook it a little longer. It is the best cream cheese frosting I have made. The presentation was very nice. I will be making it again.

I loved this cake so much!! It's absolutely delicious and looks amazing with the walnuts on top. It is a great fall recipe and it everyone loves it.

A good, dense cake - beware - the frosting is VERY rich. I made this in a 9X13 pan to save time and it worked out great. I would agree that you'd need 1.5 times the frosting called for here if you are doing a 2-layer cake. The amount here was perfect for one 9X13 cake.

This cake is excellent. The texture is dense and moist rather than soft and light. Every person who tried it demanded the recipe.

As far as spice cakes with cream cheese frosting go, I would stick with a good carrot cake recipe. The applesauce was an extra step that only created a dense texture and didn't contribute to the flavor. Also, I think you need 1.5 times the amount of icing.

Time consuming, but a great cake!

The cake looks like it would be lovely all by itself. As written, with icing and candied nuts, this recipe has a whopping 958 calories and 61 grams of fat. With double icing as reviewers recommend, it's got 1220 calories and 82 grams of fat!! Of course it's good!

Nice presentation.

The cake was fabulous. It was moist, tasty and with the walnuts and currants just the right consistency. It impressed my mother who is an excellent baker and harsh critic.

I have made this cake twice--first with the apples asked for and the second time with Cortlands. The first outing was better, but both were really excellent. I solved the frosting quantity problem by using three cups of powdered sugar, creating a frosting more like the usual carrot cake icing. I agree that the sugared walnuts are not beautiful, but breaking them up AFTER they are baked makes them look more natural and adding a pinch of salt to the egg white added flavor. A very nice ending for a soup and salad supper. A cook in Verona, Wisconsin

This is a great fall recipe. I used four apples that were on the small side (2 granny smith and 2 braeburn) so I added a scoop of store-bought apple sauce and the cake came out very moist but not too mushy. It was a hit with my guests!

My guests loved the cake but I would like to try and lighten it up. It was very dense and moist, more like a fruit cake. I will try it one more time with 1 less apple, also double the icing recipe, it is very good but not enough for the cake. The sugared walnuts are just ok, if you can buy them its worth it to save the time and trouble for a little garnish.

I only had Macintosh apples on hand, and they break down during cooking way too much for this recipe. I like the taste, but the texture was way too wet. I'll try it one more time with the right apples. Also, there wasn't nearly enough frosting to cover. I'd double it.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. he loves spice cakes. I agree with others that the icing was FABULOUS. My cake turned out heavy--but with good flavor. It was the consistency of bread pudding (which is a hit for my husband) but disappointing for me. I wish I would have used fewer apples. The recipe did not give a weight or other measure for the apples and I thought mine were likely too big. I like the nuts and currants.

This was a very moist, pretty cake and the icing was excellent. Next time I make it, I will increase the spices.

I felt this to be a elegant cake that could be made for many different occassions. A birthday or for thanksgiving or a fall party. I enjoyed making this cake. My whole family loved it even my picky 4 yr old. I am sure you could use many different apples with this cake even add a bit of pumpkin for more of the fall flavor. The icing was so simple to make and very yummy. The roasted walnust with cinnamon sugar on it was yummy. Those in themselves make a great snack.

cake was heavy, dry, and tasteless. needs to be lightened up. garnish of walnuts was so so. Great recipe when read, not good in making. How can I lighten the cake and add some moistness to it?

A very flavourful cake, approved by all at a recent family birthday. Be sure to use currants as listed (as opposed to raisins which are often found in apple spice cakes) for a nice change of flavour and texture. From a cook's standpoint, the next time I make this cake I will just toast the nuts used for the garnish ( I substituted pecans for the walnuts). The egg white spice coating did not add to the flavour or appearance of the garnish.
