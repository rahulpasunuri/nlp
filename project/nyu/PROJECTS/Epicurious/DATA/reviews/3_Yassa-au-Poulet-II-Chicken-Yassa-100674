Really wonderful dish, Use the habenero for great flavor! I simplified the cooking process though, I browned the chicken pieces and then added all the rest of the ingredients in a covered cast iron cassorole dish, baked at 375 for 1.5 hours.

Hey genius from California - palm oil is not mentioned in the recipe so you might want to learn how to read more carefully. This is an OK recipe - not great. There is another one on this website that tastes much better.

This is a delicious chicken dish.My friends and family often ask me to make it for our get-together visits.

I added 1 roasted and chopped fresh pimento to the recipe and added it to the yassa along with the pimento-olives. The extra pimento was a great addition, adding a real boost to an already great recipe.

this is really a unique tasting dish. didn't think I'd like it but I did. I added about a tsp minced habanero, depends on your taste/tolerance!

Chicken Yassa is never made with Palm Oil. Furthermore, it is highly recommened that the chicken marinades at least 24 hours. There should have been a list of subsitutions for the ingredients because alot of people do not use habanero etc . Generally, Chicken Yassa is accompanied by vegetables as a side dish not added to the chicken stew itself.

Delicious! As a relative novice in the kitchen, I found this dish simple to make and surprisingly robust in flavor.

A delicious variation of the Poulet Yassa we used to eat at African restaurants in Brazzaville, Congo. The pimiento-olives are a nice touch.
