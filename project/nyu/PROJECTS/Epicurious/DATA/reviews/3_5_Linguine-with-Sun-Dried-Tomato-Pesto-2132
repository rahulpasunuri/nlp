Great recipe, BUT. For a lighter pesto, use packaged dried tomatoes soaked in hot water for several hours. Drain, reserving liquid then proceed as directed. After adding oil, use reserved liquid as required to get to desired consistency. And, I prefer pesto made in a blender rather than a food processor - you can get a finer texture. A teaspoon or two of wine vinegar is a nice addition. Finally, if the final result seems bitter, add a scant teaspoon of sugar.

Used less olive oil than called for and thinned it less. Very good!

I made this with oven-dried tomatoes from the recipe "slow-roasted tomatoes" which is also on here. Delicious!

Simple and excellent recipe! I add more garlic(elephant) and I use mix of parmasean and romano. I make this all the time with my extra basil and it's nice because It keeps for 2 weeks.

I think I missed something here...wasn't impressed. Added grilled shrimp but thought it was lacky something.

This was an amazing summer meal! We loved it with thinly sliced grilled chicken on top. My basil is going crazy right now so I added twice as much as was called for, also omitted the nuts because I didn't have them onhand. Didn't miss them. Can't wait to make it again!

I have made this recipe numerous times and I never tire of it. The flavors are superb.

This makes a great spread on crostini. Definitely can decrease the oil - - add just enough to make a smooth spread. Fresh basil is a must.

I make this all the time and have adapted it to a sun-dried tomato pesto spread. I use less than 1/4 of olive oil and no water. It can be served at room temperature or chilled. It is great spread on crackers or a slice of toasted good quality bread.

We used smoked sun-dried tomatoes and some salt to the pesto mix. We also roasted the garlic to make it a more mellow flavor. We agreed with the other cooks' comments to reduce the amount of olive oil -we used between 1/4 to 1/2 cup. We recommend adding scallops. The scallops with the flavor of smoked sun-dried tomatoes was great. Excellent!

I thought that it was somewhat bland. Maybe I hadn't used enough salt or the wrong type of sun-dried tomatoes but I wasn't very impressed.

The second time I made this I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup. I would reduce it even more next time. It's a delicious and very easy recipe, and the pesto seems to stay indefinitely in the refrigerator.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I've made it twice - once with shrimp and scallops and once with sauteed mushrooms and chopped procciuto ham. Both times I got RAVE reviews!! Thanks!

Good, but too much fat. You can make it with a lot less oil, and use some pasta water to thin it so that it mixes with the pasta.

This is delicious! Since we discovered this recipe, it is frequently made at our house. We buy Roma tomatoes, slice them in half, and bake on a cookie sheet 8-10 hours @ 200' , then store in olive oil in refrigerator until ready to use (up to one month).

This was easy and delicious. I served the pesto with mini pita breads, cut into quarters. It was a big hit at my dinner party. Also wonderful on the pasta. I added shrimp to it one night and that was wonderful too.

Yum! I have been looking for this recipe...my favorite deli makes a sandwich of this style pesto, turkey, harvarti, lettuce and tomato on french bread...now I can make it at home. I could eat this stuff by the tablespoon!

I made this sauce for Valentine's Day and put it on heart shaped pasta. I really liked this recipe, as it was fast to put together. I put the water on to boil, then put together the sauce before the water boiled. However, I used almonds instead of pine nuts, and didn't really care for it. Also, I didn't have enough garlic, and more would have been better. But I will still make this again.

I loved it and so did my husband. I used the leftover pesto as spread on bread and it was delicious. Had to give the recipe to my stepmother.

Excellent and easy! I didn't use quite a much oil

This is also FABULOUS (and colorful) as a layered appetizer: one layer of this pesto, one layer of green basil pesto, and one layer of softened cream cheese. Serve with bread or crackers.

This is one of the best pesto recipes I've used. It also makes a great appetizer as part of a bruschetta -- rub toasted french/italian bread slices with some garlic; add some goat cheese; top with sun dried tomatoe pesto. It is the first appetizer to go at a party!

This was a great and easy dish. Next time I will serve it with grilled chicken. I topped the pasta with extra Romano cheese for more flavor.I also didn't use quite as much olive oil as the recipe says.

Absolutly wonderful! I make this with grilled chicken strips and my family loves it! A easy yet flavorful dish and one of my favorites!

This is a staple in our household. Everyone loves it. If you do not have it prepared in advance, it is easy to pull together while the pasta is cooking. Enjoy!!!!
