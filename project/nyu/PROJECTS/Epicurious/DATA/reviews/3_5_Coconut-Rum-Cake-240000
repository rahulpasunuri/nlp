I need help with the coconut rum cake. There is no coconut in the cake batter? Are all the slivers placed on the top?

This is for coconut lovers!!! I had a request to make something with coconut for a birthday cake and this was it. We all loved it and it was relatively easy to make.

So my version was not nearly as pretty as the picture. My coconut slices were, ummmmmm, interesting looking. However, this cake was so delicious! I made this and a key lime pie for a dinner party and this was the clear winner!

Yummy! For some reason my cake overflowed the pan even though it was the right size but it was still fine. This cake is super sweet, moist and delicious! The coconut was kind of a pain to get the meat out of but was SO worth it once it was all put together. Our guests loved it!

This was one of the best cakes I have ever made. Labor intensive, but fun and worth it. I couldn't find cream of coconut and made my own concoction by pureeing the remainder of the roast coconut with a can of coconut milk. I then warmed that on the stove with about 1/2 can sweetened condensed milk. Turned out great! I think I ended up putting more the 3/4 cup of that mix on the cake, didn't measure. My cream version did have lots of coconut bits in it and therefore the appearance wasn't as smooth but it was delicious and beautiful. Everyone loved it! Such a hit.

Delicious and moist cake. I added a little bit of shereded coconut to the batter and it tasted completely coconutty and it balanced very well with the rum. One of the most easy and fast cakes to make. I will do this one again and again.

My guests loved it! They scrape the serving plate clean by the end of the night. I used a Guatemalan dark run (rich with vanilla notes) and was very liberal brushing the sweet coconut milk on the cake. It came out flavorful and moist.

I used Mount Gay rum. It wcrks great. I added rum to the cake and coconut to the cake mix. I doubled the iceing and I skipped the real coconut bit. I used packaged sweetened coconut for the cake mix and on the iceing. Everyone loved it. I'm making it again this weekend for a party.

The icing was perfect and balanced well with the cake. The cake wasn't overbearingly sweet, the only complaint is that the cake was a little dense and heavy. Overall, it was delicious.

This cake was EXCELLENT! I thought it was going to be very sweet and rich. It was light fluffy and moist. If you like coconut, you'll love this cake! Also, if you don't have a whole coconut on hand, toasted shredded coconut workks great too.

I have not made this recipe, yet. However, I have a suggestion that Alton Brown gave to de-meat a coconut. Cook's Note: To open a coconut: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the coconut onto a folded towel set down in a large bowl. Find the 3 eyes on 1 end of the coconut and using a nail or screwdriver and hammer or meat mallet, hammer holes into 2 of the eyes. Turn the coconut upside down over a container and drain the water from the coconut. Store the water in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. Place the coconut onto a 1/2 sheet pan and bake in the oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven. The coconut should have cracked in several places. Using an oyster knife or other dull blade, separate the hard shell from the brown husk. Using a serrated vegetable peeler, peel the brown husk from the coconut meat. Rinse the coconut meat under cool water and pat dry. Break the meat into 2 to 3-inch pieces. With the grater disk attached to a food processor, grate the coconut. I will be using this technique and will comment further, later. Hopefully this will help others.

I made this cake with four eggs only and added cream of coconut to the batter. My husband doesn't particularly like coconut and he loved it.

Rating: 2
This cake is OK--very dense and rich, not too sweet. But it's not particularly interesting, flavor or texture-wise. It doesn't taste all that coconutty. The "glaze" didn't set up for me--it remained runny and sticky, and it retained the cloying, tinny flavor of the ultra-sweet Coco Lopez.

Delicious! I made this for a barbecue, and one guest who claims not to like coconut loved this cake! It is so easy to make- I omitted the process of shaving and toasting coconut for the topping. Instead, I toasted unsweetened coconut ribbons. I also brushed the hot cake with cream of coconut as soon as I took it out of the oven, instead of waiting for it to cool. Served it with fresh blackberries, which provided a lovely contrast in color and flavor.

The first time I made this it was good, but not rummy enough for my taste. The second time I added a liberal splash of rum to the cream of coconut before I brushed it on the cake, which worked out really well. The coconut shavings were difficult,the first time as well, but I noticed some pre-toasted coconut shavings (long pieces as described, not baking coconut) at our high end grocery store, which saved a whole lot of headache.

After so many negative reviews, I was pretty nervous. I made the cake as directed, with only a few minor adjustments. Used cake flour instead of all-purpose, and added a tbsp of the cream of coconut and of run into the cake batter. The cake came out BEAUTIFULLY. I made double the icing, and will make this again as cupcakes to use it up. YUM!

Beware that this cake RISES when you put it in the oven. I have made it several times, and I just seem never to learn... At present I am watching it overflow in the oven with 20 mins remaining baking time, and anticipating all the gunk I'm going to have to scrape off the bottom of my oven! It will be worth it though--people always love this!

In honor of a holiday characterized by palm trees rather than snowflakes, my surrogate family and I christened Christmas dinner 'tropical,' and set about collecting recipes -- of which this cake was to be the coup de grace. Too late I discovered that the minor matter of adding coconut milk to the batter was missing from the instructions. Our milk was unsweetened, our rum cheap, and our thimble of vanilla insufficient. After two hours of preparation, expectations were high, blood sugar low, and festivity on the wane. Under hammer and chisel, the coconut flew off our three-story deck. The cake appeared to have collapsed on itself, and the icing was runny. Yet it turned out irresistibly delicious, and here's how: - start with a hot rum toddy - broil that accursed coconut - add a tbsp vanilla to batter - make a third more icing & add confectioner's sugar - MORE RUM - but not Captain Morgan from the gas station. Voila!

As a European baker, I found this cake absolutely delicious. Not too sweet, mosit, not too heavy and without the artificial aftertaste that so many American cakes have. This cake replaced many of my previous recipes for a yellow cake, including Martha's Steward. It is the best!

I hated to give it one fork. My daughter wanted to bake me a cake for my birthday. I had seen this recipe, and thought it looked like it would be a great cake. She had baked Paula Deen's coconut cake for her father's birthday. I thought this would surely top it. WRONG! It was grainy and eggy. She and I both could not finish our slices. I should have read all the reviews first. This recipe and the cake are both headed for the trash.

Any tips for making this cake into a wedding cake from anyone out there? Thanks!

Actually, I hesitated quite a lot before making this cake. Reading the reviews kind of scared me to death (okay so what, the recipe doesn't work?? at all??? shall I sweat blood and tears on making those coconut ribons??? could this pretty cake be no good at all??) At the end - in gourmet we trust! - I decided to do it exactly by the book (and ventually get terribely angry with the magasine... :-))). Well, must say, I really don't understand what all this fuss was about: the cake was decent, I soaked it overnight, the ribbons were really easy to make - I had no choise, they don't sell anything similar in italy - and I've just kept adding sugar to the icing untill it looked good. The result was very nice, goodlooking, tasty and satisfiing. What more could one want??!!

I loved this cake. I made it last night for guests. I took the advice of others reviewing this recipe and added a few things. What I would NEVER do again is use a fresh coconut for the ribbons on top. What a royal pain in the youknowwhat! Too much work for too little. I did not get to Whole Foods to see if they had coconut ribbons in stock but would go that route rather than make my own. Try the cake. It was a huge hit and was delicious!!! Even my 5 year old age a piece!

This cake was soo good! I read the reviews first and thankfully took them into consideration. I added 3/4 cup cream of coconut, 3/4 cup milk, 2 tbs dark rum, extra tsp vanilla, and 1/2 cup of shredded coconut to the batter. I made this into cupcakes baking for 20 min. Also poked holes in the top before brushing on additonal cream of coconut. I got lots of compliments and will definetly make again!

I read all the reviews before trying this cake and I'm glad I did. I added 1/2 cup of coconut to the batter and a tablespoon of rum and cream of coconut. I also added 1 tablespoon of rum to the cream of coconut rum glaze and poked the cake with a fork before brushing the glaze on. It turned out great. My tips: For those that are having trouble Coco Lopez brand cream of coconut head straight to your local liquor store, it is a staple for pinacoloda. Before finding it there I did found the Goya and La Cena brands at a local ethnic supermarket but unlike Coco Lopez the first ingredient was not coconut so I see why this brand is suggested. Also for those that struggled with the adjustable blade slicer don't even think about it I just used a vegetable peeler and I got the same gorgeous coconut slivers without the risk of losing valuable appendages. I also baked my coconut slivers on parchment paper to alleviate too much browning and easy removal from the baking sheet. Also for those without a Whole Foods near them try an Asian supermarket for the young coconut. In the future to add some more moisture I will add a little half and half to the batter. Some reviewers also added coconut rum and coconut extract which I think will be a welcome addition. I will also add the glaze as soon as transfer the cake from the pan.

I followed the recipe and it turned out well. However, I did implement some suggestions I read in earlier reviews. To enhance the coconut taste, I added one tablespoon of Rum and ½ cup of coconut to the batter. I also added one tablespoon of rum to the cream of coconut mixture. It turned out great!!! I always use different friends and associates as testers and they all loved. There were a few who suggested I use more Rum next time and depending on your taste for Rum, I would agree. A total of two tablespoons in the batter and cream of coconut wouldnt have hurt at all. I plan to do that next time. Im sure the shaved coconut would have given the cake a nice presentation, but it didnt serve my purpose, so I didnt use it. If I was serving it at a party I would have used it though. My only personal gripe is the cake wasnt as moist as I would have liked. It wasnt dry at all, but just not as moist. Any suggestions, tips from other reviewers would be great!

This recipe is great!!! The recipe is missing no ingredients as suggested by other users...simply follow the recipe and I promise you will get a delicious moist coconut cake....I made coconut rum cupcakes using this recipe...I added Parrot Bay Coconut Rum to the cream of coconut mix and brushed on the mix to the cupcakes when they came out of the oven. I then let the cupcakes cool and placed them in an air tight container until the next day and decorated them.....I made these for a babyshower and everyone was raving about them....better yet no one paid attention to the cake!!!

It's obvious just from 1st reading of the recipe that something's missing. flour - eggs -sugar...uh huh? First, where's the liquid? and why would you pitch the liquid from the coconut? I added rum, coconut liquid, half&half to make up another 1/2 cup of liquid, plus added toasted coconut. Nice and moist, baked it a little lower and longer. Very rummy & coconutty

i would make this again but include some of the suggested changes- coconut in the batter, run in the soak.

The overnite soaking is the trick--do not skimp on the soak! I never did find the coco lopez or any sweetened coconut cream, for that matter, so I just got some coconut milk and added confectioner's sugar to taste. I thought the amount of rum the recipe called for was woefully inadequate so I liberally increased th rum I added to the cake batter and the icing. The coconut toasting and shaving was a bit of an ordeal, but now that I know how to do it it'll go easier next time. That being said, I'm not sure I'd make this again. I found it rather bland and the texture was not the creamy one I'd imagined it would've had. It was definitely soaked so I don't know what I could've done differently. Luckily, I did add rum caramelized bananas as a topping and IMO, this added the needed pizazz. Everyone, including the b-day boy, seemed to love this cake...I'm the only one who didn't go crazy over it. Not bad and it really does look nice, but not the yummiest cake I've ever had.

After reading the suggestions from previous reviewers, I added 1T of coconut rum and 1t of coconut extract to the batter. I only drizzled about half the icing over the cake. I used all the butter, but I think you could get away with just using one stick.

As written it seems the cake would be disappointing but with some small adjustments I think it is worth making again. I added ¾ cup of finely grated fresh coconut to the batter and I stirred in 3T of dark rum to the ¾ c of cream of coconut that is brushed into the warm cake. That made the cream of coconut thin enough to soak into the cake; it tasted fabulous and took care of the no rum or coconut in the cake issue. : o I would plan on making and glazing the cake the day before serving to allow the glaze to harden before adding the icing. I did poke the top of the cake with a bamboo skewer to help it soak in. When making the icing I ended up not adding the heavy cream it seemed to me it would have been too thin and it was perfect without it. The cake did settle quite a bit in the center while cooling even though it was fully baked. If you turn it upside down on the plate it does help some. I dont know if baking it longer would be a help with that but I might give it a try. I made it in a long narrow loaf pan and at the last minute decided to cut up the large coconut into smaller pieces to make cutting and serving easier. Though not as dramatic it was still a nice presentation.

I made this for work and everyone complimented me but I am not too sure they meant it. The icing was fantastic but I found the cake a bit bland and the coconut cream did not soak in like I thought it would. I think hulagal's tip of piercing with a fork would have worked well. I also gave up shaving my own coconut after slicing my finger pretty good and went and bought coconut at Whole Foods and toasted it myself. I will keep the icing recipe though!

I and all of my guests were disappointed in this cake. I too am a very experienced baker and the cake came out heavy, and grainy, similar to cornbread but not dry. Perhaps my flour was the problem. If you warm the cream of coconut before you glaze the cake with it, it will soak up much easier, in addition to poking the cake with a fork. I added flaked coconut to the cake batter as I wanted more coconut flavor. Huge disappointment and I won't make again. Since I am in Hawaii and have coconut palms and lots of coconuts, using the fresh coconut was not a problem for me.

I made the recipe last week and found it pretty easy to follow. However, I couldn't get the sweetened cream of coonut to soak in (and I let it soak overnight). I used cream of coconut normally used in Pina Coladas. Should I have used a different kind? Thanks for the Whole Foods tip on coconut. That was the more laborious step.

I thought this was just okay... granted, my cream of coconut was a bit old and may have tasted a bit "off." I would suggest using more coconut cream than the recipe calls for, and being very careful not to overcook the cake.

This was excellent! I made it for a dessert party on my birthday for which I made eight different cakes (most from this site) and this one was many people's--and my own--favorite. To the question about soaking overnight: I made the cake portion the night before I served and thought it was important to soak in the cream of coconut while the cake was still warm. I will not change anything the next time I make this--and it's so easy! I thought the rum flavor was pronounced so be sure to use good-quality rum in the icing. Whole Foods sells shavings of coconut which was helpful so that I didn't have to wrestle with a whole coconut and a machete right before my cocktail party for 30 people:)

This recipe only gets a fork because of the pretty prsentation. Other than that, I found it to be bland and tough. It was quite a disapointment after all the work that went in to the presentation. I work for Williams-Sonoma and am an experienced baker - we sell mixes that better tasting than this cake. Next time I want the "wow" factor with this presentation, I will make my Tres Leches cake.

I really don't understand some of these cooks here saying there's no coconut in the recipe. It has 3/4 C. of sweetened cream of coconut in the batter, plus coconut plus rum in the icing. MOIST, EXCELLENT, if made just as the recipe says. Don't know what some of you are doing to this recipe but it was awesome, perfect just as written! Follow the directions!

Try using the Frozen Young coconut so that you don't have to crack open a coconut. Drain then spread in tray and sprinkle the sugar then bake it. Taste better than the shaved coconut in the shell. It has also softer texture.

Zero forks for this one. The cake was crumbly, coarse, and dense at the same time. Beautiful color from all the eggs. The middle did not cook and it fell into a deep depression (as did I when I saw the condition of the cake!). We roasted our own coconut, but it did not have good flavor. The whole thing was a dud and the mess created to make it had the kitchen looking like a bomb went off in there.

Has anybody followed the cook's note to soak in cream of coconut overnight? I wonder if that would help the problem Milwaukee had. Not to mention, I love Tres Leches and that aspect is appealing to me, but I don't want to go overboard.

What a horrible disappointment. After all the rave reviews I was expecting something really great. What I got was a rough, coarse cake that tastes more like cornbread than like coconut or rum. (Perhaps this should not have been a surprise given that it doesn't have any rum or coconut in it!) Pouring sugar over it makes it moderately more palatable, but I don't even think I'll save the leftovers. This recipe is nothing like the moist, rich, buttery rum cake that I was envisioning. Terrible.

I loved this cake. I agree with having a light hand with the glazing, mine also blanketed instead of dripped over the sides. Do not skip the coconut. It is absolutely not the same, and it's actually quite fun to crack it. A tip: the recipe says discard the water, but I sweetened it with a bit of powdered sugar, and drank it chilled. Superb!

Great cake! Lovely coconut flavor. Like the previous reviewer said, if the coconut is too hard to work on, it needs longer roasting. No way shredded could be a substitute!!!

Very tasty cake and the presentation looks good. The coconut is a little difficult to work with as instructed in the recipe. Try roasting it in the oven longer so the shell cracks.

I made this exacly as writen and found it to be very tasty. The recipe did not specify what size cake pan to use, so I used a 9 inch pan. Next time I will use an 8 inch, as I found that the cake came out thinner than the photo. I also recommend holding back a bit when pouring on the icing, mine blanketed the cake entirely and did not look as pretty as the picture. I know others used flaked coconut from a bag...try not to do this. Real coconut has a much more subtle taste and it really is not hard at all to crack open the coconut.

This cake was extremely simple to make (with the exception of the toasted coconut). I gave up with the hammer and screwdriver and toasted store- bought sweetened coconut instead. I also used coconut flavored rum - it was perfect.
