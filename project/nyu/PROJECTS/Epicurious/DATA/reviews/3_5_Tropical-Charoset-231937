I adore this recipe. I have made it for the past 4 Passovers and it's such a unique and fun addition to my family's traditional food. I enjoy the leftovers all week long as a spread on matzoh. It's just great.

P.S. I really love Sephardi Charoset. It's delish

This is OK. I made it as printed, but the next time (if there is a next time), I will omit the pears, dates, and add dried peaches. The bananas don't help much. In spite of what one reviewer said, it needs all of the cinnamon. One other thing I did was cut the sweetness with lemon juice (2 lemons). I'll also mix in almond pieces before serving.

My favorite charoset ever!

This is good but I used cinnamon instead of canela. Next time, I'll try using canela because two tablespoons of cinnamon is too much.

Wow, this was really, really delish! I made it last year, froze some, had some a month later, and will make it again tomorrow for passover! Super Easy, I put it all in a blender.

I made this recipe for seder this week, and it was exceptionally delicious. I made a few substitutions based on availability in my home (this was an afterthought, second charoset) -- apple for pear, cinammon for canela, and cream sherry plus pomogranate molasses for the Manischewitz. I'm planning to make it again this week, since the leftovers disappeared immediately.

This was fabulous. Everybody at the seder kept asking for it to be passed so they could have more! We will use this recipe every year.

This recipe sounds delicious but I can't eat dates, and was wondering whether it might be possible to substitute raisins or dried plums or ??? Any thoughts?

Made this last Pesach and the first thing my niece asked for this year was this charoset. Everyone at the seder loved it.

I made the Mexican Charoset, and it was huge hit! It was delicous. I actually halved the recipie, and it still yeileded a huge amount of charroset. The texture was delicous, and the blend of flavors was delightful.
