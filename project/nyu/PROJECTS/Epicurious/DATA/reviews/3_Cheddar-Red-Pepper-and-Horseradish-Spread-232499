This recipe was pretty good, not fabulous. I added more red pepper to add a little more flavor

I have made this a couple of times, most recently for Derby Day in place of the traditional Pimiento Cheese Spread. I doubled the recipe and between a dozen people, it was gone in no time. I gave out the recipe to several people too. The horseradish really makes the spread.

Easy to make and great flavor. Maybe next time I will add more horseradish. I used it as a spread with crackers.

A great spread that holds up in all weather.I added crushed hot red pepper flakes to give it some kick.

I should have read the reviews befoe just making it from the magazine. I didn't like it but I don't like pimento cheese either. That is a really good description.

Easy, and I loved it. We took on a vacation road trip for snacks with crackers and it keeps well. I'd say you could keep on hand for at least a week and likely longer.

Really yummy! Loved the addition of the horseradish. I cut the red pepper in a farely large dice because I like the texture with the creamy spread.

Pimento Cheese! Fabulous on a sandwich, on crackers, cheese straws, everything!

Great flavor combination. Served it today as a spread on assorted crackers as part of an appetizer buffet. I combined the ingredients in a food processor pulsing in the chopped red pepper last so it would remain chopped and not become pureed. I wish there was some left to try as a spread on beef sandwiches...
