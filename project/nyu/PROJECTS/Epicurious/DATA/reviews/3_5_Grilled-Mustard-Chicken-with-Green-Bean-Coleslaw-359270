The flavor of the chicken and slaw was very good. The fact that this was so easy to put together put it in the "exceptional" category. We don't have a grill so I browned the chicken in a skillet with butter before baking it to finish. Great quick weeknight meal!

I thought this was yummy. I accidentally put balsamic vinegar in with the mustard dressing for the chicken, which ended up giving it a bit more flavour. the cabbage coleslaw was really crunchy and tasty, i also made it with little roasted potatoes but this wasn't necessary as the chicken and cabbage filled me up nicely! will definately make again.

Only made the GB Slaw--was just OK, nothing special. Used baby bok choy & red onion. Maybe would be better w/fresh green beans, but really, just didn't impress me.

Really? Four people liked this? I followed the recipe exactly. Not only did the chicken look unappetizing it was boring taste-wise. The slaw was just OK. My husband and I both voted "Not a Keeper".

This recipe creates a clean, light and very satisfying meal with a blend of really interesting flavors. I will make this one again--the slaw is just wonderful.

This came together easily and tasted great. The mustard chicken is very basic, but tasty. The slaw is wonderful. I used vidalia onions because my Whole Foods didn't have other sweet onions; they worked just fine. I liked that this felt like two recipes in one, and for so little work. A great summer meal.

Made the slaw to accompany the porchetta-style pork roast recently featured; used Napa cabbage and scallions. Heavenly! A perfect slaw for summer, light and tangy. This one's a keeper.

This recipe is excellent! Tangy, refreshing and truly restaurant-grade...and trust me...I've been to the best restaurants in the world, and this recipe is in my top 15! One change (more of an addition, really): I used extra terragon. I love fresh herbs and used about 3 tablespoons of it for extra zest & flavor. Thank you for this great recipe. I intend to add it to my regular cooking repertoire!
