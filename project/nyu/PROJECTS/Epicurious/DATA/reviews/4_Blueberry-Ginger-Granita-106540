An easy, elegant dessert for a summer night. The ginger adds such a pleasant kick and gives the granita a wonderful finish.

This was wonderful. We served it to friends who also raved about it. I might try lemon vs the lime, and more of it as I found it a bit to sweet. Add red wine for the water and freezing in popsicle molds would be good as well!

Excellent. Used as a 'palate cleanser' after dinner & before a cake dessert. Served it in sherry glasses. Superb!

Nice, light summer treat. Great for desert dwellers, and easy to make.

Outstanding recipe and VERY easy! Terrific lo-cal healthful contribution to summer parties. I love the recipe exactly as is but will experiment with a bit less ginger in the future.

This is simply outstanding. We were looking for a light very flavorful dessert, and this was perfect! Used a bag of Trader Joes frozen blueberries, and added only a 1/2c. of water and did the other 1/4c. in the lime juice, love the layer of citrus on the ginger and berries. Must try!

I made this recently for a dinner party and it was a great success. Because one couple is on a low-carb diet, I substituted Splenda. I topped with a healthy dollop of whipping cream whipped with sour cream. Delicious! A very easy, elegant dessert. The touch of ginger is what takes it over the top.

Wow! This is so easy and tasty! My husband just loved it, as he tries to eat lower carb, but, I LOVE to make dessert! A big change from my usual rich, chocolate something, but I really enjoyed it and will do again. Ginger makes it!

Simple and simply delicious. Served to several of my gourmet friends and their guests last night who gave it four forks. This is a must try recipe. The blueberries and ginger combination is just so much better than the typical orange granita. I'm making more today for my daughter and her family.

Really nice. I think the recipe would also make a funky popsicle for the end of a summer dinner party.
