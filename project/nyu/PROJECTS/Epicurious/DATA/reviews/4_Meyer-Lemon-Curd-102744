Ohmygoodness...seriously delicious. I made this as a filling for shortbread sandwich cookies, but I could just eat it straight from the bowl. Followed directions, except I didn't strain it after cooking.

Great taste. Though I find it easier to leave out the butter until the end. I remove the eggs and sugar and juice from the heat after it thickens and whisk in the butter (cut up into pieces). The flavor is outstanding

Made one key change and absolutely LOVE this. I used honey we harvested from our bees. Substituted same quantity of honey as you called for in sugar. Used our early spring harvest that is light and has a hint of orange flower to the taste. It turned out Devine and so nice to combine both our home grown lemons and honey. Thanks so much!

very good and easy. have made this multiple times and it is much better with meyer lemons than with regular lemons. everyone clamors for more.

Terrific. I found that it takes about 5 minutes to thicken from after the butter melts. I used salted butter as that's what I had: no problem, especially as I intend to use this with sliced, toasted baguette as part of a special breakfast. More like 7 lemons to make a pound, but my tree produces small ones.

This curd is good and simple but I still prefer Ina Garten's lemon curd recipe--it seems to be richer and more flavorful and is just as easy.

I have made several lemon curds and find this one to be pleasantly nonabrasive. I had to halve the recipe and found it to be easy and very quick to make. A simple joy when meyer lemons are in season.

Delicious and so easy! The only reason I didn't give it 4 forks is because I have had curd that tasted even better. This was my first time doing Meyer lemon curd, though, so it may be that I prefer non-Meyer lemons.

Yummy recipe! Talk about licking the spoon, the bowl, and everything in sight! I used my homegrown meyer lemons. Bonus, I have leftover lemon rind, and juice to freeze for later! I did have trouble getting the temp up to 160, though I whisked for something like 15-20 minutes. I too don't have a double boiler, but managed fine with a pot of water, and a metal bowl. Absolutely do again!

I don't have a double boiler so I cooked it over low heat directly on the stove top, texure still turned out okay. I skimped on the sugar (I always do) but shouldn't have, it is not too sweet at all. The flavor of the Meyers comes through really well. Super easy to make.

Really fantastic! Light and creamy, this makes a great dessert or, smeared on a piece of toast, a decadent breakfast. Personally, I could eat it with a spoon. I'd never used Meyer lemons before, but I certainly will again. This comes out not too cloyingly sweet, and perfectly tart. I suspect jars of this will be in my Christmas baskets this year@

Delicious and easy to make. Follow the suggestion of " A cook form Sacramento" and I have to agree that blending everything is by far the easiest and no fail method. I have given friends jars of this lemon curd and all have raved about the taste. Do try to use Meyer Lemon if you can get your hands on some, as it's sweeter juice makes the curd!!!

This is the best lemon curd I have ever tasted. It is so easy to make, I will never buy another "gourmet" brand again.

UPDATE: I made a quadruple recipe with about a pound of slightly sour oranges and two large Meyer lemons. Together they produced 8 tsp rind and 16 fl oz juice. Had to cook a little longer -- it took about 8 min for the four sticks (!) of butter to melt and another 15 or so, stirring, to get the curd to a thick enough consistency. (I like it coating the back of a wooden spoon nicely.) The temp went a bit above 160 (175 or so) and I was worried about curdling, but I turned off the heat and stopped the clock about halfway through and then gradually reheated until I had the desired consistency. Amazingly delicious and I doubt even this much -- about 60 oz -- will last the month or so curd apparently keeps fresh!

Oh boy, this is the real thing. Easy to make and flexible with a blend of lemons too. I've made it several times and when I ran out of Meyer lemons added a Eureka and just a dash more sugar and it was great -- not overly sweet.

Holy cats that's good! And so pleased I didn't have to find something to do with 8 egg whites like with the "standard" method.

Doubled the recipe with fresh from the tree, Meyer Lemons, very ripe and heavy with juice. When I squeezed them they literally fell apart in my hands... The cook time did take longer for curd to come to 160 degrees, but well worth the whisking. I used the sieve method which was perfect for catching tiny bits of shell and undissolved lemon zest. YUM! Next time I try to make this recipe, I may throw the entire lemon in the food processor to cut the prep time.

I halved this recipe because I only needed a small amount and I did not put it through a sieve. It is magnificent!

This is a great recipe! Fast & easy. I made the recipe the way that the Sacramento person did: in my Vitamix blender. Although I did not get that beautiful rich, yellow color, it came out very good. When you mix it in the Vitamix you get a lot of air and the color stays a very pale yellow. I didn't add the zest, so the taste was perfect and not too sour and not too sweet. Just right. I'll make it again and give to my neighbors for a treat.

This was delicious and incredibly easy. I put the curd in a pre-made graham cracker crust and topped it with whole strawberries and mint sprigs. A huge hit!

I have a very prolific meyer lemon tree and I hate that the fruit just falls off to rot in the sun. This recipe is amazingly simple and wow- what a perfect flavor. For those who have said it's too tart - make sure your lemons are ripe enough. I used the fruit that was super dark yellow not the lighter yellow and the flavor is perfect. I'm going to make jars of it this weekend to give as "Happy Spring" gifts next week

I made this recipe with blueberry scones for a brunch and there wasn't anything left at the end of the meal. Everyone loved it!

This is unbelievably good. Way easy, too, if you use a thermometer and a double boiler arrangement. I always double the recipe and get three half-pint jars. This is super delicious on oatmeal scones. Perfect sweet/tart balance. We're lucky to have Meyer lemons for a long season in northern California; I make this and the lemon/vanilla bean marmalade from this site for gifts.

Great! Tart and creamy. Didn't follow the cooking directions - combined the juice, eggs and sugar in a blender and thoroughly blended the mixture. Melted the butter and with the blender going added the butter in a slow and steady stream until thoroughly blended. Cooked the mixture over medium low heat - constantly stirring the mixture. Took the mixture off the heat when the spoon began to leave a trail that didn't disappear immediately. The curd turned out perfectly! YUM!

Excellent curd. I doubled the recipe and it was sublime. I was a little skeptical about the whole eggs instead of all yolk or yolk combo, but it worked very well. Lovely, almost floral, quality with the Meyer lemon.

Very, very nice! The Meyer lemons have such a lovely, distinct, flavor. This curd is smooth as silk! And eeeeezy to make...what a plus!

YUMMMM!!! This took me quite a bit longer than five minutes to cook fully, but it's no big deal. I used home-grown Meyer lemons and found the sweet/tartness to be perfect.

My first attempt at making curd...fab!!! My 7yr old suggested I use the key limes from our tree instead of the Meyer lemons....tastes great on everything from biscuits to a spoon!

I first tried this recipe a year ago and luckily, I didn't read the reviews or I might not have made it. This is absolutely delicious, just as written, WITH Meyer lemons and the 1/2 cup of sugar. The secret is to bring the mixture to temperature slowly, it must take at least 5 minutes to reach 160, or you risk a tinny taste.

I used home-grown Meyer Lemons and found this to be very tart. Did anyone else have this problem?

This isn't quite the same as an English recipe that I had tried, but it's very good! I used regular lemons instead of Meyer, and the only improvement that I could suggest is using a tiny bit less sugar than the reccommended 3/4 cups.
