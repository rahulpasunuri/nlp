Made as written. Delicious. Comes together quickly and makes a large quantity. Rave reviews from family and guests. To save time used pre-packaged shredded cabbage (coleslaw mix) along with matchstick carrots. Have made several times. Don't over drain the tofu - some moisture is needed in the topping.

After several attempts, I think I have finally reached perfection for this recipe. Used the entire 12 oz block of tofu in the topping because I had no use for leftovers. Doubled the garlic and used basil out of a tube. Shredded carrots in food processor. Substituted Bragg liquid aminos for soy sauce and doubled. Added 1T of Sriracha to vegetables (I will increase next time). Used veg broth instead of water, reduced quantity slightly. Filling, healthy, tasty. Next time, I will try smoked paprika. The olive oil is a predominant flavor in this dish, so use a good one.

I made this last night and it turned out really well. I had been dreading the chopping, so I chopped the carrots and cabbage the day before, covered it up and put it in the fridge without washing. This made the process go so much faster, as everything else is easier to cut up. I also ended up having a 50:50 topping to vegetable ration and mixed some cheddar cheese in, as I ran out of parmesan. I think having more topping made it taste less bland and added more texture to the dish, though it wasn't as crunchy as I was hoping. I'll definitely make this again, maybe adding chopped nuts to the topping to make it crunchier.

I would not make this again...cutting all the veggies took FOREVER and it had very little flavor. I following the other reviewers' suggestions and thought it was only so-so. My boyfriend gave it a 5/10 - first time in a year he disliked something I made. Steer clear of this recipe if you don't want to waste your time just to be disappointed.

I loved this and will definitely make it again. I used cauliflower instead of cabbage (personal preference) and omitted the oil in the topping (to save calories) and it was delicious. The veggies are soft but that was okay with me. I froze leftovers for my lunch and it was fine re-warmed.

This meal is perfect as a mid-winter comfort food. I sliced the carrots, the onion, two leeks and added six whole garlic cloves, mixed it all with olive oil, sea salt & the dried spice's then roasted at 400 deg. for 1/2 hr. While roasting I sautéed the cabbage with 3 tbls. of a nice vinegar adding water as needed, tossed in the kale and continued until soft. I mixed everything together in a casserole dish, topped it with the bread crumb mixture adding more course sea salt (minus the spices now) and baked. It turned out delicious! I did serve it with a small piece of poached salmon my wife likes a little meat&Delicious.

First let me say I liked the taste and look of this recipe and now the big BUT it was a lot of chop-chop. The one thing I added was 8 oz of mushrooms sliced which sauted in the olive oil before the onions. I thought it added more of a meaty taste. Next time, if I do, I'll not only add the mushrooms but add one can of white beans, again, for more of a meaty taste. All that being said, it tasted good but I'm 70 years old with limited chop-chop energy.

This is an extremely healthy dish, but the flavor and texture aren't perfected. The choice and cooking method makes all of the veggies soft. I'd cut back on the onions and add in broccoli, cauliflower, and/or snap peas to add crunch to it. The topping is a little funk, probably owing to tofu. I'm not sure what the solution is there, but be warned. Finally, you really need to broil this at the end for 2-3 minutes to get the color you want.

This is a great dish. Did not include the tofu and added extra seasonings. Also, I cooked the Kale first and a little longer than the cabbage. Delicious.

Yummy! This dish far exceeded my expectations. Well-seasoned bread crumbs were an essential part of the recipe(we did ours homemade with whole wheat bread, which turned out great just drying out some ripped up day-old bread in the oven for about 10 minutes). I kept the salt down a little bit, as you don't need much in the face of so many herbs (my boyfriend added a whole medley of dried herbs-- I don't think you can overdo that on this one). In the future I'll add even more carrots, and maybe some root vegetables, too-- the bread crumb/tofu topping and the cabbage form the basis for a very versatile recipe!

Rating: 2
This wasn't half bad--I wouldn't say its as great as everyone is raving--but it's tasty none-the-less. The crust was pretty killer. I didn't have kale on hand so I used swiss chard. I also hate oregano so I left that out, added garlic to the veggies as well. Next time I too would pre-cook the veggies less, and probably add a few more in there!

This meal meets my criteria for a fall staple: cozy, inexpensive, and healthy. Because the vegetables emitted so much liquid, I will eliminate the water next time. As suggested by other reviewers, I made the following adjustments for greater flavor dimension: For Vegetables - Substitute good quality teriyaki for soy sauce, Reduce salt to 1/4 teaspoon, Reduce stove top cooking time to 5-7 minutes to avoid mushy vegetables, Add a squirt of fresh lemon juice before transferring veggies to the oven. For Topping - Increase tofu to 8 oz, Substitute 1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika and 3/4 teaspoon regular paprika.

absolutely delicious. i substituted collard greens for the kale, and added the extra soy as suggested by other reviews. next time i will cut back on the amount of bread crumbs. i think it would be better with just enough to coat the tofu crumbles.

Really delicious and simple. The only change I made was to substitute nutritional yeast for the cheese to make it vegan...lovely and comforting and filling!

Followed the recipe verbatim except for adding additional soy sauce since so many earlier reviewers recommended it. This dish tastes far better than it sounds - normally "Kale and Cabbage Casserole" is not be my idea of a good time, but I gave this a try because of the favorable reviews and the healthful ingredients. I was not disappointed - it is quite tasty and has a pleasant mix of textures. If you factor in the smugness enjoyed from preparing such a nutrition-packed meal, it rates a full 4 forks.

oh, and i also added quinoa to make it a complete meal.

I added some garlic to the vegetables and upped the garlic for the topping (I love garlic, can you tell?) and also substituted nutritional yeast for the parmesan to make it vegan, and put some gluten free crackers in the food processor in place of the breadcrumbs to make it gluten free... also upped the soy sauce. sounds like a lot of substitutes, but it came out great!

I substituted red cabbage for green (prettier), added an extra tablespoon of soy sauce, and increased the salt in the topping to 1/2 teaspoon -- then fed it to someone who claims to not like onions, cabbage, kale, or tofu. She went back for seconds. Great for breakfast the next morning with a poached egg on top.

This dish was much more delicious than I was expecting! Extremely flavorful, satisfying, even for us a house of carnivores. Good as a side OR a main dish. We love it!

This came out very good. I wasn't sure what to make of the other reviews, as some said "bland" while others liked it. I made a few changes, so mine is very tasty: added a small handful of chopped sundried tomato, a tablespoon of capers, a tablespoon of dijon mustard and a dash of hot pepper to the veggie mixture; used veggie broth; added some crumbled goat cheese under the topping; added a handful of pecans to the topping mixture. I had no issues with flavor!

Surprisingly delicious! Used veggie broth instead of the water for the steamed veggies and panko for the topping. This was a great way to clean out the fridge with the leftovers from a few weeks of CSA boxes. Will be making this one again for sure.

I made this by mistake -- I was meaning to make another tofu casserole from this site but ended up getting the ingredients for this one, so we had it for dinner a couple of nights ago. We found it VERY good -- I'd really rate it 2-1/2 forks if my computer would let me. I used half red cabbage, and added some sliced mushrooms and fennel. A very nice dish.

This was surprisingly good. I used veggies from our CSA box (my guess is it wouldn't be as delicious if not made with fresh, organic veggies, since the veg flavor is the main thing), did the OJ in the steaming liquid, and did thyme instead of basil (out of the latter). It was even suitable for my 9-mo-old, who LOVED it.

The baked root vegetables were fabulous. I did something wrong with the topping, but the tofu seems to be a good way to get a crumb topping with out all the butter.

Had no tofu but decided to try it with ricotta and it turned out amazing! Also used spinach instead of kale and it was delicious. I would recommend doubling the soy/tamari sauce. Fantastic recipe!

Great side for a flavorful fish or a nice steak! You would never know there was tofu in the topping because it gets mixed in with the other ingredients. I added the egg and put it under the broiler for a few minutes at the end.

While my boyfriend normally likes meatless dishes, this one got a big thumbs-down. He thought it needed more flavor, some spiciness. I liked it alot, but next time would add mushrooms to heft it up a bit, and i would add cayenne or some other heat to the topping. Might be best for a side dish at a holiday meal.

This delicious, and substantive enough to be a main dish for five or six. I added some yellow sweet potato cut into matchsticks, which worked well.

This dish is phenomenal for how healthy it is. I used tamari instead of regular soy sauce and added 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms. I didn't measure the tamari, so I probably ended up using more than the recipe called for. At the last minute I realized that I was out of bread crumbs. I ended up crushing 2 1/2 cups of herb stuffing mix in the blender and using it in its place. I omitted the salt in the topping, but still added the spices. It was unbelievably good. And so good for you. This will definitely become part of my rotating menu.

If you shred the cabbage and the kale in your food processor it makes serving it a cinch. Made as stated but added mushrooms. Turned out excellent for being so healthy. I can imagine adding some summer squash and/or broccoli in the future. Perhaps topping it with some motzerella as well (extra cheese is always good).

I made this dish for Thanksgiving potluck yesterday. My boyfriend and I are vegetarian and most of the meal choices at my aunt's house are carnivorous, so I wanted to be sure we had a filling veggie dish to pass. It was my first time making it and it was flavorful and filling. I'm actually emailing it to my relatives as we speak! My boyfriend and father have both requested I make it again soon!

Tofu as a casserole topping, who knew? I had a block a tofu, carrots, potatoes and a handful of spinach and decided to take a chance on this recipe. It was really very flavorful, the tofu completely transformed into a tender, tasty topping. I'm not someone who has much patience for recipes that are nutritious without being delicious, but this manages both. I've found it works well with any vegetables I happen to have around. The result is a homey, comforting dish that reheats well.

Have made this repeatedly. It is not amazing, but is easy, really quite tasty, and fairly filling. Beware though, do not substitute spinach for kale. It cooks differently and ends up tasting flat and disgusting.

This was sooo good! I changed the veggies based on what I had in the house- I used carrots, celery, broccoli, onions and garlic (and added a little tomato sauce to the juices as someone else suggested), but made the tofu sauce just as the recipe said and it was amazingly good! Thinking about adding some walnuts to it next time. A definite keeper!

Wonderful, versatile dish! I added garlic and mushrooms to the veggies, which worked well, and did not augment the recipe otherwise. It's a recipe you can play with, which is great. Next time I may add some white wine to steam the veggies, and use less olive oil in the topping.

This recipe is good, not great. It's a bit bland and dry. Don't scrimp on the salt. Disagree about not adding all the oil. I'd make sure to add more carrots and spinach/kale than cabbage -they soak up way more of the soy sauce flavour. I'd also perhaps add an egg to the topping to make it stick together better. The dish looked great in the pan, but it became a mess when trying to put onto the plate. Also, make sure to cut cabbage in tiny pieces - makes it hard serve otherwise.

I made this dish with some hesitation. Despite my repeated attempts, I'm not a huge fan of tofu, but I know how healthy it is, so I made this casserole. I couldn't get enough of it! It was almost embarassing how much I loved this dish. The rest of my family enjoyed it, but I think it was really MY favorite. I think you could cut back a bit on the butter without losing the great flavor.

Sure makes the kale go down easily! It's the first time we've enjoyed eating the very healthful dark leafy green. Next time I'll cut the cabbage strips shorter for less messy serving with a spoon. I suggest adding garlic to vegetables and additional to topping. I sauteed the veggies in a blend of 1/2 orange juice and 1/2 water. Also, I used 1-1/2 Tbs.oil for saute, and 1/4 cup of safflower oil in topping. Cheddar cheese works well too! Absolutely must use size skillet given;it's very full! To avoid spilling over, I added some of the cabbage after veggies had shrunk a bit.

This was quite tasty, easy, and very healthy. Even my husband (who turns his nose up at tofu) went back for seconds. Next time I would use crispy-toasted bread crumbs for more crunch.

I can't believe it, I cooked with Kale! This dish was surprisingly delicious. It makes a wonderful vegetarian dish. I shortened my prep time by buying a bag of matchstick carrots, and they were fine. I also used Italian flavored breadcrumbs, which made a great topping. Do not use a smaller pan than the 12-14 inch pan suggested, there's an amazing lot of ingredients that need to get sweated down.

Made this last night with a few "enhancements" and it was delicious. Instead of the water and soy sauce, I added a can of petite diced tomatoes with their juices. I also added garlic and fresh sliced mushrooms to the veggies. I was still concerned it might be a bit bland and so I spiced it up with some additional herbs and spices. I pretty much followed the crumb topping recipe, which complemented the veggies well. Very satisfying without being heavy. And good for you too!!
