This was a huge hit. I substituted plain Panko for the matzo. Left over sauce was fabulous the next day as a spread on turkey sandwiches.

I will be making these for the Seder for the 3rd year in a row. The only difference is that I only use salmon - didn't use whitefish the first year and then just never opted to make the change. The sauce is fabulous! The first year I made these, I also made the horseradish encrusted prime rib from Bon Appetit. The non-dairy sauce complemented the rib too - my guests couldn't get enough!

A very inspirational recipe. Perfect for a light spring/summer dinner. I used shark which was on sale at my local market, and instead of matzoh meal I used ground up cooked rice which I had at hand. The result was very delicious. For the sauce I used home made mayo, adding the horseradish bit by bit to adjust hotness. My end result was pretty different from if you followed the recipe word by word, but that's the joy of cooking--createing your own dish.

My expectations were pretty high but even so I found these utterly tasteless. Only the two year old at the table ate them (and he added a lot of salt). I make a lot of fishcakes for my son (usually with salmon, cod, sweet potato and ginger) and these were really bland. Followed recipe exactly but asked guests to add their own horseradish to sauce (our horseradish is off the charts hot...)

I made these for our Passover seder this year as an appetizer and they were gone as soon as I put them out. I followed the recipe word for word, except I made my own mayonnaise and horseradish to use in the sauce. Delicious and easy!

super delicious and i've never had gefiltefish. a few things: i used cod and salmon (fairway doesn't have whitefish, even though they sell whitefish salad in the deli - weird). i thought it was too salty, so i would half the salt next time. i also thought the sauce was a bit too mayonnaisey. the other thing is that i don't like frying for so long, so i just made 7 big ones, and gave each person one cake. everyone loved it. crisp dry white wine, yum!

I made this recipe for a dinner party of 16. First of all, for the sauce- be sure to follow the instruction to add only a little horseradish at a time. I added it all at once and ended up with a much too spicy sauce! As for the cakes, I tried them with Tilapia and found the taste to be too fishy. I also ended up with very chewy cakes versus crispy cakes. Perhaps I didn't fry with enough oil? Any tips?

Amazing, luscious--a great alternative to regular gefilte fish, which I've made from scratch for the last 25 years. I used flounder instead of whitefish, which wasn't available (despite my trip to Fairway). For the sauce, which was amazing, I made the mayo from scratch using a very fruity, robust extra virgin olive oil. The olive oil flavor was so strong that I mixed the homemade mayonnaise half and half with Hellman's. Also, I did things scarily in advance: I bought the fish on Sunday, cooked the fish cakes on Wednesday morning, and warmed them (on a pizza stone) and served them on Thursday. They were still yummy on Friday! Probably this would not have worked if the fish had been less fresh when I bought it. Anyway, this recipe is highly recommended.

Really delicious. I can't stand the texture of jarred gefilte fish, so this was a wonderful improvement. The gal next to me at the fish counter was making the same recipe! Hope she enjoyed it as much as we did.

This was the first Passover we didn't have gefilte fish and made these instead and everyone loved them...including the non-fish lovers! We used Tilapia instead of White Fish and it was fantastic.

Made this instead of gefilte fish this year! A BIG hit, even with sworn non-fish eaters. I too used flounder.

Delicious and minimally complicated.

This is delicious. I can not get whitefish so I used flounder. A great substitute for traditional gefilta fish.

Made this last evening for our "Bon Appetit" cooking group. This was excellent, very easy to make and much could be made the day before. A real hit ! I would make it again.
