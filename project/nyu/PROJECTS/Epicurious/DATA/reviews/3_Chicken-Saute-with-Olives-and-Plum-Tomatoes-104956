Instead of chicken breasts I used chicken thighs which I thought would balance better with the strong taste of the olives. I heeded other cooks' advice and added one cup of tomato sauce and a half cup of red wine. I also added fresh rosemary and reconstituted porcini mushrooms. Served with farfalle. A big hit!

I heeded the warnings of previous revies and I I used 1 1/2 cans of diced tomatoes and 1/4 cup of red wine to make it saucier. I also added extra Kalamatas and some of the Kalamata juice (we're HUGE fans of Kalamata olives). I served over pasta tossed with olive oil and grated Parmesan cheese. Yummy!

This recipe smelled fantastic but was very bland. The only kick it had was from the salt and garlic I added. Not worth making.

Excellent - and so easy. I used canned tomatoes with a little bit of the juice. I used dried Marjoram, and only about 1 tbl. Served with pasta lightly tossed with pesto. Even the toddlers loved it. I think it would freeze well too.

I made this dish the first time when my olive hating husband was out of town. The kids liked it so much I risked making it again when the olive hater was home. I cut the olives in half instead of chopping coarsely. He loved it and asked me to add it to the keeper list. I did use canned diced tomatoes without the juice, and that gave it a nice sauce. I also used fresh basil, hot pepper flakes, and extra garlic.

This wasn't nearly as tasty as I expected it to be, but I'll probably give it another try and use some of the suggestions, such as adding red wine, basil and extra Kalamata olives. I'm not sure what's missing, but something...maybe it needs some crushed red pepper and/or artichoke hearts.

This was wonderful! I added a can of sliced tomatoes with the Roma tomatoes as my pan wasn't as juicy as I like it and it was being serving this dish over angel hair pasta so I wanted lots of sauce. We love garlic so I doubled that. I also added sliced mushrooms (had them left over and wanted to use them up) with the yellow bell pepper and it was great! I cubed the chicken for ease of serving with the angel hair and it cooks much faster than when the chicken breast is whole - also a good time saver if you're chicken is partially frozen. When the dish was finished, I added the cooked angel hair directly into the sauce. Adding the pasta directly to the sauce really helps to absorb the sauce into the pasta and keeps it from sticking together. Since my chicken was cubed, I didn't have pan-crowding problems as I think would have happened if you try to do this with the whole chicken breasts. With cubed chicken and a full package of angel hair it makes a ton of food and we had leftovers for the next day! This will be added to our rotation!!

Lovely..it's a keeper for us. Son walked in with some friends who said "What are you cooking? It smells delicious." It WAS! I added 1/4 cup of red wine after adding the plum tomatoes because the pan was dry; I guess my tomatoes weren't very juicy. We loved this; Kalamata olives rule! I may try fresh basil next time, though we really enjoyed the marjoram.

Delicious, easy, and inexpensive to make. I agree with another rater, adding basil definitely gives this recipe some oomph! Definitely according to suggestion of pasta tossed with parmesan cheese

This recipe is better than a two but not quite a three. I used basil as suggested by another cook and I liked it. It is visually interesting, easy to prepare and even the kids ate it with only a little persuasion. I will cook it again

Excellent and easy to prepare. I added a red bell pepper as well- for the non-tomato person in my house! Delicious and a chance to use marjoram, a spice I don't use very often.

This rates four forks for combo of ease and taste. My husband and I eat VERY low-fat as often as we can, so a dish like this is PACKED with flavor in our books! I could see where someone might review this as bland, if they're used to getting all their flavor from salt and fat. This is a big-time weeknight keeper. BTW, I used fresh basil and it was out of this world.

Easy to assemble and timing was not an issue and I am always in favor of flexibility. Overall delicious -- plus low fat makes it quite desireable. I had no fresh majoram at hand, dried chopped sufficed just fine.

The recipe was what I wanted. Thank you. Timing was not an issue and therefore I wanted the flavors to merge with the chicken. I let the chicken simmer for an additional half hour. Since I was out of Marjoram, I switched the flavor a little and used curry and italian seasoning. Not very fancy, but it met the need.

Good standard dish. Definitely make it again.

My husband really liked this dish, I'd give it two and a half forks if you had half forks. It's easy, not loaded with fat and tastes good.

Very tasty, and will work with substitutions like red pepper too. I agree with a previous review: if you're liberal with olives, garlic, and spices you can't go wrong.

Keeper! If you're generous with garlic and real Kalamatas, there is NO way this can be flavorless. Fast, easy and light.

My husband and I really liked this. I added a little white wine to the sauce and thought it worked well.

This was terrible! My husband was polite enough not to comment. He just kept reaching for the salt. It was awful-- zero flavor. :-(

Thought this was very good and very easy. Be careful not to cook the sauce down too much. Parmesan over the noodles is a must.

Even my picky nine year old son loved this.
