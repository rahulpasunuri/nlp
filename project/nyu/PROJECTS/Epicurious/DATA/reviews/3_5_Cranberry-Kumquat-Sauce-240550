I also found removing the seeds to be time consuming and tedious. It may be easier before they are cooked in the syrup. I also think it needs more sugar. Next time I will use 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water.

Delicious sauce. Third time I've made it. Previously, I followed the recipe to the letter. This time, I sent the deseeded kumquats through the food processor until they were the same consistency as the cooked berries. Good call. I also added 3 tablespoons of XO Cognac after the berries were cooked and the kumquats added. Then heated for a few minutes. The XO compliments the flavors perfectly and made the sauce richer. Next year I'll back the Cognac down to 2 tbsp and increase the sugar slightly. - Steve

Lovely, colorful sauce with strong, simple flavors: tart cranberries & sweet citrus kumquats. I added a bit more sugar (1/4-1/3 cup more) as I used "raw" sugar. I also doubled the amt of salt called for to 1/2 teaspoon, and I'd encourage you to salt to taste after the sauce has cooled!

This is the VERY BEST cranberry sauce I ever tasted! I joined elicurious.com just to let y'all know. Thank you for posting this recipe. Worth the work. If you like a nice tart but complex sauce, this is exceptionally delicious. I made an extra batch just to eat plain.

Wonderful cranberry sauce with a strong citrus flavor. The repetitive boiling of the kumquats completely gets rid of the bitterness. Removing the seeds is a long, messy affair, particularly because this sauce is so good that I've made it in large batches as gifts, but worth the time. My husband loves kumquats and eats this with a spoon, but even my Northern family members enjoyed kumquats prepared like this. I did not add any extra sugar, and found it to be as sweet as I would want it.

Delicious. Every Thanksgiving I have tried a new recipe for cranberry sauce trying to find a favorite. The quest has ended with this recipe. Perfect balance of a citrus bite with the cranberry. I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar to suit my family's taste. Will become a Thanksgiving staple.

Fantastic cranberry sauce recipe. Having made this a couple years now for Thanksgiving and finding it very well received, this has become THE Thanksgiving cranberry sauce in my family. The citrus flavor of the kumquats is fresh, a great spin on the classic sauce. Sauce is almost like a cranberry citrus marmalade with 2 cups of kumquats; tastes great with just 1 cup kumquats too.
