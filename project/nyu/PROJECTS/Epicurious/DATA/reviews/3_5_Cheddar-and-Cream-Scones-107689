These scones were great using all ingredients and quantities shown with the recipe. I believe the secret is to use very cold butter, mix to the described cornmeal texture and not to overmix once liquid ingredients are added. I served them today for Sunday breakfast with scrambled eggs, and gravy with sausages. It was a complete success. Would be doing them frequently

This was very quick and easy to make and only one bowl to wash. What I loved was the yummy fragrance that filled the kitchen while it was baking. Even my dogs were there hovering around the oven-well they probably thought it was their homemade cheese biscuits! I added a bit of chipotle powder for a kick. I will definitely make again as these were delicious for the little effort.

PLEASE do not make this recipe as written. Add something... more cheese, herbs, or read what other reviewers have added. As written, this recipe is terribly bland (even with extra sharp cheese) and I will be searching for another cheese scone recipe.

very nice crust, used less sugar and added mustard and some green onion. next time will add little bit bacon.

I bake these for our coffee shop in Mapleton,Oregon. I add finely chopped garden herbs and roasted garlic--everyone loves them!

I've found you've got to nearly double the cheese AND it must be the extra-sharp. (I used the Tillamook special aged cheddar in the black wrapper). When warm, the cheese is still soft and it adds to the great texture of these scones. These were great for a hearty breakfast!

I found these scones too rich and yet completely bland. They were very quick and easy to make, but I would not make them again.

Easy to make, moist and delicious. Crave a bit more cheesy flavor though, used extra sharp white cheddar, so maybe just needs a little bit more.

I added four finely chopped Jalapeño peppers and used more cheddar. I also had to increase the cooking time, but they ended up being great. Made them for a brunch party and everybody loved them. This is a good simple recipe that begs for a dash of improvisation.

Very easy and very good. The scones were moist, light and very tasty. I couldn't find extra sharp cheese so I used regular white cheddar. It was a little bland. Next time I will look harder and maybe use a little extra cheese.

I didn't think this recipe was that great - maybe I did something wrong. I think that anything with a stick of butter, a cup of cheese and 3/4 c. of whipping cream will taste good - but nothing made them unique. If I were to make it again - I would cut the scones into larger pieces.

I love these scones! I doubled the sugar and added 1/4 cup of crumbled bacon, and that made them even better!
