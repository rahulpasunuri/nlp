This tart takes time and lots of dirty dishes, needs to be eaten soon after assembly, but it is my "wow" dessert. I have been asked to make this for a group of serious cooks, slightly offending some of the other experienced bakers. I am going to try another tart crust as this one is a bit hard. I would still give it 10 forks as previously mentioned.

For the sake of costs, I nixed the fruit and went with the simple filling. The fruit filling was very sweet, even with the addition of tart raspberries. If the crust had more lemon zest, it would better contrast the sweetness of the filling. If I were to make this again, I would definitely add at least a tablespoon more of zest. It also is a lot of work to consume. The crust is hard and crumbly and the filling is rather sticky, making it a difficult treat to eat while chatting. Despite the guests' exclamations of delight, no one went for seconds.

Very time consuming to make, this was far from a stunning dessert. The boysenberry filling was not as good as the classical filling, we felt it detracted from the fruit. Commercial strawberries invariably look wonderful and have little taste. Would only make this with home grown ripe berries.

Thank you to the reviewer who said this should get 10 forks. This recipe takes time and a makes a lot of dirty dishes, but because of the 10 fork comment, I made it and am thrilled to have such a delicious and light dessert to delight my guests. I like raspberries for the cream, I found the boysenberries to be too sweet with the lemon crust. I could not fit the amount of fruit called for on top of the tart, suggest buying less. The tart would be good with almost any seasonal fruit. I find peach to be the one essential flavor to keep the berry flavor from being too intense and lacking contrast. I layer the peaches on top of the "cream" so every bite has the combination of flavors. This is not a last minute project. I always make the cream and crust the day before, as noted in recipe. I don't think this keeps well so I make it for group large enough to eat it shortly after making. Fabulous.

This recipe goes beyond just 4 forks. It is absolute heaven, and really easy. I used blackberries instead of boysenberries and all went well, showing that this recipe is so versatile with what's in season, on sale, or in the fridge. Phenomenal tart!

I made this for a dinner party and got rave reviews. The only trouble I had with the recipe was that I tried refrigerating the crust dough overnight (the recipe suggests you can do this) and since I used real butter it became rock hard. It was difficult to get it back to the right consistency. It cracked when baked, and it needed way less than 20 min. of baking uncovered.

Beautiful colors! I used strawberries, blackberries and nectarines for the topping. Very tasty as well.

This has become my signature dish. I make the filling without a fruit, and it becomes a simple creamy, lemony, spread. The best fruit tart I have ever had others can't even come close1

Made this for a dinner party last night... it was the best reveiwed dessert I've ever taken anywhere. Used raspberries in the cream and mango instead of peaches. It was beautiful, delicious, and easy to make.

My fruit tart came out beautifuly. The only advice I would give is to not but the fruit on the night before because the juice from the fruit made mine slightly runny after leaving it on over night. It still tasted really great and to my suprise the crust stayed perfectly crisp even with the fruit juice makeing it slightly runny. I also used mixed frozen berrys (rasberrys, blackberrys, blueberrys) instead of boysenberrys for the cream. I would defantly make this again!

Usually I am in total agreement with the majority. This time, and it may be a fluke, nothing worked in this recipe! The crust separated while baking like parched ground and the berry cream went from thick and inviting the day it was made, to runny and icky the next day when serving it at work.(not a good place to serve an embarrassing mess, trust me) I'm not courageous enough to try this one again.

An excellent tart. Lovely presentation, and delicioius as well. I used 6 individual tart pans - it's lovely to place a complete tart in front of each guest- the presentation doesn't suffer because there's no messy cutting and serving. Tomorrow when I make this for an upscale potluck dinner party, (yes it's definitely one you'll want to make again) I'll be making bite sized mini-tarts because the hostess asked for finger food. The crust was less tender than I expected but the up side is that it holds up well when it comes out of the mold. Don't panic if you can't find boysenberries - my substituted frozen blackberries were perfect. Definitely melt and use extra currant jelly. I believe I tripled it. And rather than using a brush, just gently spoon it on.

this recipe was amazing! I used raspberries instead of boysenberries in the cream... fantastic. i recommend brushing the crust with melted chocolate before adding the cream.. the crust stays wonderfully crisp even a few days later! definitely a keeper.

This was absolutely beautiful and tasted fantastic as well. It was a bit of work, though, and I would definitely recommend starting the crust and filling the day before. I found that giving everything time to cool and set was well worth the effort.

All I can say is HOLY GOD. This was the most amazingly refreshing summer fruit desert I've ever had. "Rapturous moans" with every bite does not tell the half of it. I used blackberries for the "cream" in that I could not find boysenberries. I was so tentative about the lemon juice for the crust, the current jelly glaze. ALL WASTED ANXIETY. Make this! Your family will love you for it. I wish there was a 10 fork rating . . . Maplegirl

I made the filling with blueberries. It is a lot of work, but it was so worth it. If it wasn't so much work I would make it to have all the time.

Made with raspberries instead of boysenberries and topped with white peaches, blueberries, strawberries and blackberries. I made the dough and filling the day before to give myself plenty of time. It came out perfectly and was a hit with everyone!

The filling is a lot of work but yields an incomparably rich and delicious cream that sends people into raptures. I used raspberries instead of boysenberries in the filling.
