My grandmother also made candied orange peel at Christmas time. A lovely taste. However, I took a shortcut and used marmalade. I put 1/4 cup through the miniprep and added it to the wet ingredients. It was my sister's homemade tangelo marmalade, and the bread was great. This recipe produced a loaf with a lovely fine crumb and it cracked open along the top to make a great presentation.

After making this bread twice, came up with an easier way to make the zest. Instead of peeling the orange and then scraping the pith (which is a very tedious pain in the -you-know-what), simply use a sharp vegetable peeler and gently peel the zest. There will be much less, if any pith remaining.

YUM. I'm eating some of this bread right now, fresh from the oven. It's really delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. Only addition was some of the orange syrup left over from making the candied zest. Which, for the record- pretty involved. I can't say I'd make candied oranges any time again soon. The hardest part was cutting them up finely at the end to put in the bread - when they dry out they become tough. However, I imagine you could use an electric food chopper for this step. Can't wait to toast a slice of this for breakfast. It is sweet enough that I will serve it a la mode when some friends come for dinner later in the week. cheers!

This is the first time I came across Orange Bread and gave it a try based on the good comments, however, was really disappointed. Not sure if Orange Bread should taste like this, as I have not tried one before, but sure do not like this one.

Wonderful bread. It is well worth the extra time to make the candied orange peel. It actually took a couple of days to dry - however, I made this in the middle of a rainy Northwest winter. Keeps well. Will make this again and again.

I loved this recipe! This is just like the bread my mom used to make (a recipe from her grandmother). I used a candied orange peel recipe from my grandmother.
