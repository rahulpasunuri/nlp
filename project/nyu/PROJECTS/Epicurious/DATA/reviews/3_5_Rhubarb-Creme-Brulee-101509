This was absolutely fantastic. It decimated my poor little rhubarb plant in the yard but it was so worth it. I can't imagine not roasting the rhubarb like other reviewers recommended though. Roasting it made it almost creamy in consistency plus roasting changes the flavor a bit. I made it as directed and wouldn't change a thing.

My husband is a real creme brulee aficionado, and this one is his favorite. I agree with other reviewers that baking the rhubarb is a pain and unnecessary. Other than that, it's perfect and a wonderful finishing touch to a "happy spring" dinner party.

Don't bother baking the rhubarb; just cook the rhubarb on the stove top. Added less sugar to the rhubarb which gave a nice contrast to the custard. Will add more ginger to the custard in the future. Will also increase chilling time and baking time to ensure custard sets more firmly in the future. But I'll definitely make this again!

Rhubarb is one of my favorites. Baking the rhubarb is questionable but the results were wonderful. Definitely to be repeated, especially for rhubarb lovers.

Very concentrated rhubarb flavor. The tartness of the rhubarb cuts down on the richness of the custard, making it distinct. I don't like ginger so I put very little of it in the custard. A really nice creme brulee overall.

This one was a hit! I made a few modifications, though. I used a teaspoon of vanilla instead of gingerroot; why try to improve on perfection? One more thing - cooking the rhubarb in the oven leaves you with a disgusting paste-like substance. Cut the stalks into small pieces, add 1/8 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water, and cook on the stovetop for 15 minutes.

The rhubarb was a nice counterpoint to the creme. The turbinado sugar was not quite as nice as brown sugar would have been.

I served the Brulee to guests who all thought it was delicious, including me. I removed the ginger after it heated to simmer. It was smooth, creamy and very tasty. I will make this again.

I made this because I had some rhubarb and wanted to use it in something interesting and different. I much prefer the creme brulee recipe listed elsewhere in epicurious that contains a vanilla bean. It's the one with fresh ginger...I did it without the ginger, and it was the best creme brulee I've ever made! This one with rhubarb pales by comparison.
