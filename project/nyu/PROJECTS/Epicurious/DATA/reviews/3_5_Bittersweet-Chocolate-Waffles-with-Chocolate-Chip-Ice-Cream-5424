Now for a dissenting opinion...I didn't think they were worth the effort. I had to add a lot of extra flour (and also cocoa powder so as to not dilute the chocolate flavor) to make the batter thick enough to work with. I let the batter sit for 10 minutes, which helped as well. I served the waffles with a mixed berry compote. They were good, but not good enough to make again.

Excellent special occassion breakfast or brunch addition. I have made these without the ice cream serving a warm berry compote alongside, and have omitted the alcohol because I just did not have anything appropriate on hand and have had excellent results. I did have to thicken the batter a little, it was too thin for my waffle iron.

I made this for a dinner party last night. Everone thought it was fabulous. I used an inexpensive cherry brandy. (kirsch was too pricey)Also, I used Edie's Dreamery Ice-cream Cherry Chip ba da Bing. I made the Bittersweet Cocolate Sauce from Epicurious .com.....wonderful!

A friend made this for supper club. Wonderful! She used mint icecream and skipped the compote and we loved it. Easy!!

We found these waffles to be so wonderful that we didn't even wait for the ice cream. We did have to substitute amaretto liquer for the kirsh, however. As die-hard chocoholics, you can't go wrong with this one. We added it to our family treasury. Aimee and David
