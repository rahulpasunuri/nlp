OK. So this recipe was incredible, and even better the day after. I made some changes, as follows: " 6 tablespoons soy sauce " 4 tablespoons dry Sherry " 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar " ½ cup red wine " 4 skinless boneless chicken breast halves, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-wide strips " 4 tablespoons olive oil " 3 large garlic cloves, chopped " 2 tablespoons grated, fresh ginger " 2 cups broccoli florets " 1 red hot pepper, thinly sliced " 1 and ½ cups mixed mushrooms " 3 green onion, thinly slice " Large pinch of dried crushed red pepper (mandatory) " " Hot cooked BASMATI rice

This was very good and filling, but nothing over the top amazing. Quick, easy, and yummy. I omitted the garlic (because i'm allergic), and it was still good. I'm sure the garlic adds depth to the dish. I doubled the sauce as well.

Definitely use the crushed red pepper, about double what is called for. Very good, not just your usual stir fry.

This was a great easy recipe to make for myself (with left overs). I swapped the ginger for rosemary & the sherry for red wine. I added more red pepper flakes & a small shallot. The sauce was a bit too much. So next time I would probably cut the sauce in half. Overall it was very good for a quick healthy meal.

Very yummy. I sliced the chicken paper-thin (starting with frozen chicken allows for this) and stirred in a little pureed lemongrass and rice wine vinegar. We served it with some chopped cilantro and peanuts to garnish, but it didn't need either!

This was good, but nothing spectacular. Seems like an easy jumping off recipe for what you have handy, ingredients-wise. I was happy to eat this, but would not make for company or for my date. Fast, healthy, and light flavors are a plus though.

This is a really good basic stir fry. The only thing I thought it DEFINITELY lacked was an acid. I squeezed a little lime over it at the end. But you could also add some sort of vinegar if you don't have that on hand.

I had chicken breast and broccoli in the fridge and found this recipe for a quick dinner. It was easy to make and it tasted surprisingly good, much better than using those ready chinese seasoning packets that sell at supermarkets. I used red onions, I didn't add bell peppers, and substituted dry Sherry for Jack Daniels (what I had handy). It turned out pretty good.

Rating: 4
This is a really good recipe...even better if you use your common sense when cooking it...I used 1 cup of red wine in addition to the sherry...I used one chicken breast and skipped the bell pepper ('cuz I didn't have any, will use it next time) & I really boiled it down (more than 3 minutes) to make the cornstarch give the sauce the necessary consistency. Oh! I also cut the breast into bite sized pieces...Excellent - but don't feel afraid to go off on your own direction...I ended up with a dish better than any restaurant meal I've ever had...

This has become a weekly staple on the menu at our house. Having a 6& 8 year old can make dinner a challenge sometimes. This meal is quick and easy. It also gets our kids to eat their veggies. Great rendition of a classic American Chinese food dish and the kids love it!

Rating: 3
A nice weeknight recipe! I was cooking for two, so halved the chicken and veggies and (because I like lots of sauce) made 2/3 of the sauce. We had no leftovers. We thought it was a little heavy on chicken, so next time I will up the proportion of veggies and add more ginger -- because we REALLY like ginger! Oh, and I used an extra- large, rather than large, pinch of red pepper flakes to give it extra zing. I would not reduce the proportion of soy sauce as some have suggested because I think it would be rather lacking in depth of flavor. The amount of cornstarch called for seemed to work just right.

Rating: 3
Simple and delicious weeknight meal. Made as is, but served over brown rice. I think the leftovers will re-heat nicely for brown bag lunches, too.

Rating: 2
I found this while searching Chicken and broccoli. I didnt' feel like a trip to the store. I didn't have a red pepper but added a sliced carrot instead. I doubled the sauce, but not the soy as I detest overly salty food. I thought while it is a relatively healthy dish, it was low on flavor and on the bland side. I skipped the red pepper flakes due to husband's tolerance and added extra garlic. I served it over brown rice and it made a decent meal, but nothing to sing about. It wasa weeknight meal and better than a trip to the store! I will keep it and make it again and be sure to add at least the suggested hoisin sauce.

Rating: 2
Not sure what the fuss is about this recipe - it's a good, easy, relatively cheap weeknight dinner. It's not going to win top chef, but made as specified, it's fresh and the flavors are bright. I've experimented with other veggies, adding hoisin, but the original is an easy staple.

Rating: 3
I tripled the amount of sauce - but did not quite triple the amount of soy sauce as others recommended. However, 3 tbs of cornstarch was too much. Ended up adding about another 2/3 cup of water. I soaked and then mixed in cellophane (bean vermicelli) noodles at the end instead of making rice. That's why I needed all the sauce. I topped it with green onion and cilantro. Was very tasty.

Rating: 2
I thought this was pretty good. I used half a red and half a green pepper, substituted wine vinegar for sherry. I only had 3 (marinated) chicken breasts, so I added a handful of carrots. I thought the dish had too much chicken for my tastes. I'd double the sauce next time I make it, and up the ginger/garlic/pepper. I look forward to having this for lunch tomorrow!

Rating: 3
Good flavor, easy weeknight meal. Chopped and readied the other ingredients while the (brown basmati) rice was cooking. Doubled the broth/soy sauce/cornstarch mixture, and replaced sherry with a bit of white wine viegar and a little extra broth. Added extra garlic, red pepper and ginger as I really enjoy strong flavors, and my boyfriend commented on how spicy it was (in a good way!). You could probably easily add some water chestnuts, chopped carrots, or almost any vegetable to this simple stir-fry.

I'd give this 2.5 forks. An easy replica of what you'd get in a Chinese restaurant. The flavors all came together.

Rating: 0
Very nice recipe for a quick and easy dinner. I did make a few adjustments to use ingredients I had on hand: no chicken broth or sherry handy so I just used water. I also changed the sequence of the stir fry ingredients, cooking chicken, red pepper flakes and garlic first, onion second, green pepper third (out of red) and broccoli last, grinding black pepper in at each addition. When the stir fry was almost finished cooking I added the sauce and let the corn starch cook in. For the last step I stirred in 1/3 cup of hoisin sauce and 1/4 cup of cashews. It a quick and easy last minute dinner - great flavor - no leftovers!

Rating: 3
This dish is very good, but also very basic. It was exactly what I was looking for, but I would probably not serve it to company. I agree with the other reviewers who say to decrease the soy sauce if you are increasing the overall proportion of sauce. I used the same amount of sauce and broccoli but decreased the chicken and other vegetables by half, and it was still a bit on the salty side with 2T soy sauce.

Rating: 3
My husband and I really liked this stir-fry, although we did modify it some... We don't like too much sauce, but the amount called for in the recipe seemed scant so I doubled it and was happy I did. Instead of pepper and onion (picky husband!) I added red and green cabbage, and topped the dish with cilantro. The sauce had just the right amount of salty-sweet flavor.

Rating: 2
A pretty decent stir fry but not overly special. I like mine a little saucier and a little sweeter so i added a good splash of teriyaki sauce and a couple tablespoons of hoisin and doubled the ginger to the sauce. I'd make it again, but only with modifications.

very easy and tasty. i substituted the sherry with red wine vinegar. i also added sriracha to the sauce.

I have made this quite a few times now. I always toss with hokien noodles at the end, and add some sweet soy sauce (ketsup manis). My kids love it. My husband and I prefer it with quite a bit of chili too, and some fresh corriander on top is a great addition.

Rating: 4
I left out the bell pepper and crushed red pepper, and added carrots, scallions and mushrooms, and I substituted arrowroot for the cornstarch. Based on the reviews, I tripled the chicken broth and garlic, and just about doubled the soy sauce, sherry, and ginger. Next time I'll stick to the 3 Tbsp of soy sauce and 2 Tbsp of sherry, because they were both much too intense. Overall though, it was an excellent flavor, and I would definitely make it again.

Rating: 0
Thirsty! Wow - too too salty. I doubled the sauce recipe and now I wish I kept the soy at 3T (instead of the doubled to 6T) - it was overboard. I did like the ginger/garlic taste and the consistency was great, but I would not salt the chicken beforehand (I would put the black pepper).

Rating: 4
This was a great classic stir-fry - quick, easy and fresh-tasting; the flavors of the chicken and the broccoli weren't covered by the sauce. I thought that there was enough sauce, but then again, I used two chicken breasts rather than four, plus probably three cups of broccoli and two cups of mushrooms - the starch made it thick enough to coat everything nicely. I definitely plan to use this format for various stir frys. For this one, I worked with what I had on hand: dry vermouth rather than dry sherry, one teaspoon of powedered ginger rather than fresh, red bell pepper was omitted, substituted one teaspoon of onion flakes for the fresh onions and I added the dried crushed red pepper and it was a great weeknight meal.

Rating: 2
This was okay, but nothing special. I doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested but it was still pretty bland and uninspiring. Will try out some of the other stir fry recipes before making this one again.

I followed the suggestions of others and doubled sauce (chicken stock, soy, garlic and ginger). I didn't have any sherry so skipped it, but added some ketsup Manis (sweet soy sauce). At the end I tossed everything with hokien noodles and it was delicious. 3 out of 4 kids, and my husband, all liked it.

Rating: 3
Based on other reviews, I doubled the sauce and found that to be the perfect amount. I thought the sauce complimented the chicken and veggies well, but I did make the broth using a high quality, low sodium chicken base, so that might be why I found it so flavorful. Next time, I think I'll skip putting the salt and pepper on the chicken before cooking, as I don't think it's necessary. Over all, this was a good meal with little effort.

I made this dish for my boyfriend and we both ate it all up! Some changes: I made 4x the amout of sauce, used 1/2 to marinate the chicken and the rest for the sauce. I also added ginger, garlic and chili sauce to the sauce recipe. I didn't stick to the amounts listed here, instead went by taste. Otherwise, probably would be bland. I used regular chicken stock (not low salt) and low-sodium soy sauce.

This was very good. I followed what the rest did with doubling the garlic, fresh ginger, broth, soy sauce. what I did different is that I marinated the chicken overnight minus the corn starch.

I liked what Moonpennies did with the chicken so I added a bit more. I marinated the chicken with 4 tsp. garlic, 4 tsp. ginger, 2 tbsp. soy sauce, 1 Tbsp. hoisen sauce, 1 tsp. cornstarch, 2 Tbsp. sherry, 1 tbsp. sesame oil, 1 tsp. mirin, 1 tsp. rice vinegar and 1 Tbsp. crunchy peaunt butter. I marinated the chicken for an hour and a half at room temperature and then continued with the recipe. We had it for dinner and then again for lunch the next day. Very good and I would make this again someday, but there are just too many new recipes to try, since we cook something different at least 5 nights a week. Bon Apetite.

This was my first attempt at stir-fry and it was very easy and very delicious. I didn't have sherry so I used orange juice, doubled the sauce and garlic and used green instead of red peppers. It seems like a very good basic stir-fry that can be easily adapted to your tastes.

Sauce amount was skimpy, perhaps double or triple would improve overall consistency. Flavor combo. fantastic!

I also found this very dull. I used chili garlic sauce, because it was open in the frig, instead of plain garlic. I pored in the recipe's sauce, and couldn't even tell it was there. I probably tripled the sauce contents by the time I was done. Microwaved broccoli, to cut down on frying, used green pepper instead of red, since the red costs a fortune in the grocery store at this time of year. With a lot of dressing up, this makes an OK quick supper.

Rating: 2
This wasn't bad, it just wasn't great either. A good basis for your all-around stir-fry. After looking at other reviews, I upped the garlic and ginger, added 1 T of hoisin sauce, and 1 t - 1 1/2 t of chili-garlic sauce which made it borderline too spicy. Even then it was still somewhat bland, so I can only imagine the original recipe. I'll probably cook this again anyway, since it's so easy, and since you can essentially throw it together with whatever vegetables/meat you have on hand.

Rating: 2
I agree with my neighbor from Boston, below. The sauce isn't so flavorful (although the following day it is much better). I think that part of the problem is that the sauce itself needs some of the garlic and ginger. I've tried this a few times now - tonight I substituted tempeh for chicken breast - it has a wonderful nutty flavor and texture! I concur with other reviewers that the ginger and garlic content needs to be doubled.

Our family of five really liked this with the changes we made. Definitely double the garlic and ginger. Mix the broth, soy sauce, and sherry and add the chicken to marinate for 30 minutes.

Add broccoli and chicken back in along with leftover marinade to which cornstarch has been added.

Excellent, quick, very flavorful stir-fry. The first time I made it as written but have been experimenting since. I use the sauce as is (though I double the quantity) and vary the vegetable according to mood.
