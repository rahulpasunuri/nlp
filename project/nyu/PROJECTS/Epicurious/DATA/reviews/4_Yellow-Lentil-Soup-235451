Followed the recipe exactly as written and it was absolutely delicious! Rather time-consuming, though - next time I'll make a double batch.

Very good. I agree that you should only blend a portion of the soup, because it's too thick and muddy if you blend all of the soup. I squeezed some lemon in the soup right before serving and it was really fabulous!

An instant classic. I had to make a second pot the very next day. I used cilantro instead of parsley which added a lovely burst of flavor. This soup is on the shortlist in my house and will be in yours too.

Followed the recipe exactly, except nearly doubled amount of cumin. Used 100% of broth from cooking lentils and veggies. Delicious and healthy! Most definitely accompany with a good multigrain bread or the pita points.

I pureed about 1/3 of the lentil/veggie mixture -- provided a nice, creamy base for the rest of lentils and veggies in the final product, and avoided the unpleasant sludgy issues some others have raised. Agreed that more cumin is a good idea. I also added minced garlic to the onions, and a small can of tomato paste. Lastly, I added 2 teaspoons of ground chipolte pepper -- added a really nice smoky flavor but not much heat. Finally, I think this recipe would be better with vegetable broth rather than beef broth -- it makes the final product vegetarian-friendly and would likely lighten the overall flavor, which can be pretty heavy with the beef broth.

There's no way to mess up this recipe. I used Brown lentils (cook 10 nim longer), substituted swirl rye bread, vegetable oil, and vegetable bouillon cubes. Just awesome, and I am a new vegetarian (2 weeks) after 60 years. Be sure to puree the vegies!

Great flavor! My husband loves it and says it's even better than the soup at Sunnin in LA. Instead, i used vegetable broth and it still turned out well.

Wow! Amazing flavour and quite simple to make. I did add more cumin but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. This is definitely a keeper. Yum : )

I would recommend NOT pureeing the solids. It ended up looking like sludge or worse, but still tasted very good. Next time I will definitely leave that step out.

Very yummy! If you want to kick it up a notch add a minced garlic clove to the onions right before they are ready. Once you smell the garlic make sure you add the soup so it won't over cook the garlic. I added much more cumin to the soup.

I'm sure my adaptions make it anything but an Egyptian soup, but I had to use what was on hand. No tomatoes, used some tomatillos instead. I used some fingerlings from the garden, we don't have any carrots right now. I added lots of cumin, tumeric, pepper, and a dash of cinnamon after browning everything in the oil. I added "better than chicken" broth and it's been simmering for about an hour. I don't plan on putting it in the blender. It's delicious, I can't wait to eat it tomorrow for lunch over rice. I'm toying with the idea of throwing some apple in towards the end.

Tasty and easy!

I ate tons of this soup when I lived in Cairo. Instead of using the pita as a thickener I sometimes cook potatoes with the lentils. Always delicious and great for winter.

Easy, healthful, and delcious. Simplify the preparation by first sauteeing the onion in the soup pot. Sizzle the cumin briefy in the oil to intensify its flavor. Then toss the other ingredients into the same pot, add the liquid, and simmer until done. Simplify further by using an immersion blender at the end--although I think this step is unnecessary. Chicken stock works just as well as beef broth, if not better.
