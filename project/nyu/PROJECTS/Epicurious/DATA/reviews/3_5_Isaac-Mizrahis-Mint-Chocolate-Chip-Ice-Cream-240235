I made this for a 4th of July cookout with friends. I was really excited to make mint chocolate chip ice cream, but the fresh mint made the ice cream taste more like mojito-chocolate chip ice cream... i was disappointed that after all the time spent making the ice cream, chilling it, and freezing it left me with an undesired flavor :(. I wish I had read the review from the person saying he/she added peppermint extract.

Disgusting, actually. Tasted like chewing gum with chocolate chips. Plus, all the eggs made the texture even "gummy". Most mint you can purchase in a grocery store/supermarket is spearmint. Do not make this.

I made this ice cream for Christmas. It was easy and delicious. The mint alone does leave the base tasting like a frozen mojito and not like the mint ice cream we all know and love, so I added three tsps of peppermint extract to the base after churned and it enhanced the flavor so it was more like the customary mint. Even the kids loved it!

This ice cream is fantastic, very minty, very creamy and just plain yummy! Followed recipe to a T except did not add food coloring because I don't think mint ice cream needs to be green. De-lish.

Its a great recipe for a very rich flavor. I left the mint in over night (chilling process) instead of removing them directly after heating them. I strained them out just before putting the custard into the ice cream machine. It made a spectacular mint flavor that you just cannot get from the store bought kind. I also offered some chopped pistachio nuts as a side, as well as cherry chipotle chocolate sauce. Have fun with it!

fantastic! loved the flavor and the texture. I only used 3 egg yolks and it was fine. first made it a few weeks ago, and now that my mint has grown back am making it again!

My batch was more good than delicious, but since I mixed it up, I thought a delicious rating was more fair. I loved the mint flavour, and found that straining the leaves out after cooking time was fine (not necessary to continue steeping while in the fridge). I used up milk chocolate chips that I had on hand, and felt this was a big mistake - dark chocolate would have been much better. Also, I used soy, which I usually do for the milk part of my ice creams, but feel that in this recipe, I would use the 2% milk, and maybe even increase the percentage of cream to milk.

Tried making a dairy free version using almond milk and soy creamer. I chopped the mint which helped infuse the flavor. Also, it took much longer for the custard to cook so that helped the mint infuse into the mixture. Per reviews of other mint ice cream recipes on this site, I melted the chocolate and drizzled it into the finished frozen ice cream in the machine while it was still turning. I can't say it was an absolute success as the warm chocolate melted the ice cream a bit but it got gobbled up just the same. If anyone has any tips on adding the chocolate this way, I would love to hear how they (successfully) accomplish this.

This ice cream was better than I expected. The mint flavor really came through- I'm not sure I even used 2 cups of mint either. I did end up adding just a few drops of peppermint extract, but only because I had it on hand. I really like the mixture of dark and milk chocolate. I'm not sure if it was because I didn't leave it in my machine long enough, but after being in the freezer overnight, the ice cream isn't as creamy as I would hope.

My four year-old daughter and I just made this ice cream and it is so good! I love the fresh mint taste and the consistency is really nice too. This was fairly easy to make and I will definitely be making it again.

Excelent texture and flavor to the ice cream. I enjoyed the recipe so much that I made a Chocolate Orange chip variation, which also worked nicely. Left out the mint leaves, added a few drops of orange essence, then used a Terry's Chocolate Orange (chopped) to mix in instead of the specified chocolate. You can often buy Tery's chocolate oranges at Trader Joes.

Excellent recipe. I read some comments saying that using spearmint comes out weird but mine was a big hit with customers who like mint chocolate chip, and I used spearmint. I sold it at a festival along with about 12 other flavors and this was the first to sell out. After the fesitval I received an order for more from someone who hadn't eaten any but had heard about it. It was the most popular by far. However I did make some changes - I used a Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate candy bar and a regular Hershey's Milk Chocolate candy bar for the 2 types of chocolate called for. I did this because that's what I had on hand. Dark chocolate is the best kind of chocolate to use for chocolate chips! Also I let the sieve full of mint leaves sit submerged in the custard after I strained it (the whole time it was cooling), to make it mintier. I think next time I will wait to strain it until it's completely cooled, leaving the mint leaves in the custard while it's cooling. Don't hesitate to make this ice cream! It was awesome.

This is delicious. The little mint plant I put in my garden 2 years ago is now as big as a small auto! This was a perfect way to use a bunch of it. As it turns out, the mint in my garden was the spearmint variety which made this ice cream extra special and extremely fragrant. I used 2 cups of tightly packed mint leaves and it gave it a really minty flavor.

I just made this recipe for the first time and it was out of this world. My kids gave it "600 thumbs up."

Made this for a family dinner. Everyone liked it, but I can't really say that it knocked our sox off. Perhaps I didn't execute well - it just wasnt' as minty as I'd hoped.

Served this last night to friends, who loved it. Have to admit I wasn't paying enough attention to the recipe and cooked the milk and cream together, which meant the mint spent a fair amount of time cooking. All in all, it made the taste pretty strong, but also colored the milk enough that I didn't need food coloring -- there was a slight green tinge to the base. (Not that I was going to use food coloring.) It was very refreshing and creamy.

Except for the fact that I omitted the food coloring, I followed the recipe exactly and the results were fan.tas.tic. I didn't think it was too rich, and I used eggs from my chickens, so the yolks are really flavorful.

This is my favorite flavor of ice cream and unfortunately they don't seem to have it anywhere here in Switzerland. Such a tragedy! We tried this recipe to satisfy my cravings and oh my god it is fantastic! Adjustments: lowered egg yolks to 4 and skipped the food coloring. We also made it without using an ice cream maker and stirred it periodically while it froze to break up ice crystals as they formed and tossing the chocolate in as it thickened up. I can only imagine it would be even better using the proper equipment. Milanoduo is right, this IS good enough to cure cancer and bring on world peace. Yum!

This is seriously good! I made it with 1% milk and a mixture of peppermint, spearmint and chocolate mint from my garden. It will be in regular rotation from now on! Thank you Isaac!!

I make this at least once a month, to the detriment of other ice cream flavors, but so be it. Isaac's MCC rules the school. Guaranteed to cure cancer, make yr teeth whiter, blow away those blues, and bring everlasting peace to this little ol' planet called Earth. I generally make it with one less yolk and with part-skim milk, which makes it just a touch lighter. Stop reading already and get to it--it's that good!

The highlight of the dinner party! Ialtered slightly - 1.5 cups heavy cream + 1.5 cups 2% milk, 4 egg yolks, a little more than 1/2 cup of sugar and a whole storebought bunch of mint. "So fresh", "I'll never be able to eat mint chocolate chip ice cream from the grocery store again" were the reviews. Wish I had doubled the recipe!

This is a really good recipe with a true delicate minty creaminess.. one recommendation - in the step with the milk/sugar/mint after it simmers pull it off the heat and let the mint 'steep' for about 20-30 minutes - I think it enhances the flavor - also really press down when sieving the mixture to extract all the mint juices.

it's much better if you steep the mint leaves in the milk for an hour. and, for the record, i like it better with spearmint.

Mint chip is my favorite flavor ice cream and I liked this very much. Two things: it took MUCH longer to thicken the custard than the recipe says. I upped my burner to med. low and it will took probably 2-3 times as long to get it to coat the back of a spoon. Secondly, and this is not the fault of the recipe, I wish there was a way to better feature the chocolate. Frozen chocolate, imo, just doesn't taste as good as room temp. Anyway, this was very good and I loved the "real" mint flavor that came from using leaves and not flavoring.

This is a great ice cream recipe. The consistency is excellent. IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure that you use peppermint and not spearmint. Most grocery stores sell spearmint and call it simply "mint". Spearmint ice cream has a very unusual flavor!!!

I have not made this recipe but it is very similar to one already on the Epicurious website called "Fresh Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream" which is one of my top ten ice cream recipes. The differences are less cream, more egg yolks and chocolate and the addition of quite unnecessary food coloring. This recipe leaves the mint leaves whole instead of chopping, and in my own notes for the epicurious version I've instructed not to chop the mint too finely. Now I'm going to try not chopping them at all and see how that works out.
