I"m curious...it says that the jelly keeps in the fridge for 2 months. Even though I didn't process in a canner only one of my lids didn't seal. Would it be shelf stable?

Produced a very liquid jellie- we processed with additional sugar, lemon juice & liquid pectin- I would omit the gelatin next time and use the liquid pectin from the beginning. We placed a sprig of rosemary in each jar for decoration- looks very pretty

This is excellent used as a glaze on grilled salmon!Would probably also work on BBq chicken or game hens -perhaps pork as well.I would use liquid pectin next time, as the gelatin turns cloudy after awhile.

This recipe was very easy to make and the results were very good. The rosemary flavor is very pronounced, especially because the pink color does not lead to savoury expectations.
