I had never cooked a goose before tonight. Saw one back in December on sale (frozen & free range) and bought it. I pricked it with a skewer and poured boiling water over it and set it in the frig. Mine was close to 9 lb. and cooked in the 2 hours. The skin was crisp and the inside moist. It's a keeper and will definitely do it again. I am not a turkey fan.

The seasonings used in this recipe were excellent, and I will use this recipe again to make a chicken or turkey. This year was my first time to cook a goose, and I was surprised to find out that goose tastes exactly like turkey. Please note that as other reviewers have indicated, the goose should be pricked all over through the skin with a skewer to let the fat drain. I also followed the UK's food service agency's cooking instructions and cooked the bird at 450 for the first hour, and then 325 until it was done. This helps render the bird and avoids ending up with a greasy mess.

Perfect Christmas Goose, had a 9 1/2 lb bird, followed directions, was done in 2 hours, had cut the skin and fat, basted every 30 minutes, easy, no effort and the awnser the question " is a heirloom goose different" oh yes it is. Had a freerange organic goose, a tad pricey at $ 4.95 per pound, but the taste worth every penny, thank you for sustaining my reputation as a excellent cook.

My husband & I decided to try something different for Thanksgiving 3 years ago & zeroed in on this Goose recipe. Had 15 people for the dinner, and everybody loved it! So much so that this year we're repeating this recipe, by popular demand.

Oy. The recipe sounds great, but there's some important info about preparing a goose that's missing (no wonder the only reviewer was less than impressed!). Kids, goose meat is fairly lean, but it comes encased in a lot of goosefat. What you have to do to get the benefit of the good lean tasty goosemeat is (a) first, prick holes in the skin of the goose with a skewer or similar implement (being careful not to put holes in the meat), (b) scald the goose quickly in boiling water and then (c) let it chill and dry in the fridge to let the skin tighten and dry a bit before roasting. IF you do this, the goosefat will render off and you will be left with a very tasty bird.

I made this for Christmas dinner. I found I didn't like goose meat, it was far too rich. But my main problem was that my 8-lb goose took much longer than 2 hrs just to brown. It took 4 hrs. before my goose had any color. Needless to say, dinner was a little less-than-jolly.
