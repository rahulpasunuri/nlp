I made this recipe with country ribs to cut down the cost. I season them extremely well before breading. I really loved them! And what makes it better is that they were easy to make. I served them with applesauce for dipping.

this is a pretty expensive dish to make. anybody knows the best piece to fry hard is a nice fatty piece of rump. marinate it for an hour with lots of salt--the most important spice is the salt which maintains the moisture while you fry these chunks long and crispy

Reading all the reviews made me want to give this recipe a try, with my own special twist of course. I'll check back once I've tried it, Thanks everyone!

Yeah, the section regarding how to coat the ribs with the "panko" seem to be missing...

My mother-in-law makes a delicious version of this recipe, only she uses Country Style ribs instead of baby back so that there are no bones... ABSOLUTELY SINFULLY DELIGHTFULLY MOUTH WATERING!!!

I have Chicken Fried blood running in my veins and Without being mean i must say,I made these ribs for my poker buddies and the opinion was they just were a bit bland and then my family said the same. So i made them again with my hot sauce in the dredge mixed with the egg then added some BBQ rub to the flour and whoop there it was the missing flavor. I will do these again just with my add ins. This recipe is a good one, but can be made waaay waaaay better.
