I'm surprised this recipe doesn't have a higher rating, as it's delicious! I use a total of 6 T butter rather than the 18 T that's in the recipe: 2 T to cook the panko- coated veal, adding olive oil instead of any additional butter, and only 4 T butter in the sauce. I also use fat-free half and half in place of whipping cream.

When you're ok with a calorie splurge, this is a little winner and would be a great dish for a dinner party. It's so easy to prepare, and the sauce is over the top delicious. How could it not be with all that butter! I think basil or tarragon would also be good as the primary herb. I love using Panko for breading--it results in such a light crunchy texture. I wouldn't eat this often, but I will definitely eat it again.

I love epicurious, and have made many recipes over the years from this website. This recipe was the biggest disappointment I've had in all of those years. I'm a veal lover and a big fan of panko. This recipe was very disappointing, especially in light of the other reviews. Bottom line, not worth the trouble or cost. The globby butter sauce was absorbed into the veal (which was already sauteed in butter). Edible, but I'd never make it again.

Sauce is profoundly lemony - in future I'll halve the lemon juice. Good in all other respects; would be wonderful on fish. Do make the sauce ahead, as directed - I was having a mad time trying to keep whisking, add butter 2T at a time, and keep on top of the veg and cutlets at the same time.

This was faulous! I used less butter in the sauce than called for and FF half and half and the sauce was so good. All the flavors melded together nicely. I thought it the amount of thyme would make it too strong but no one flavor stood out.

Really not the best prep for veal - the lemon was too strong - really overpowering. That said, I didn't use the full amount of butter, so maybe with more fat the lemon would have not been so prominent. I did add some extra chicken stock at the end to try to balance but I think it was too late. Won't be making it again.

One of my favorite veal recipes! I've been making this since it first appeared and found I don't alter a thing! Just make sure your ingredients are resh. You cna't go wrong with this.

Incredible flavors. I used only a few tablespoons of butter for the sauce and the flavor is so delicious, it is not necessary to load on all the extra fat and calories.

Great dish! I cut the butter in half, and the sauce was still VERY buttery. Am going to cut it down by half again (1/4 total butter) next time I make the dish. Served with peas, string beans, or even mashed potatoes is great!

AWESOME!This is my husbands favorite meal. We don't eat it that often because of the amount of butter but when we do we eat every last drop! I always bread the cutlets atleast 2 hours before making because the bread crumbs stay on much better when cooled in the fridge.

I am giving this recipe 4 forks because it really is great the way it is written. However, since I have made this several times I have made some changes. I used thin pork cutlets instead of the veal and it was almost just as wonderful. I have also cut the butter completely in half which does not take away from the flavor of the sauce at all! It really is just a bunch of fat that no one really needs. Wonderful, versitle recipe. I served with goat cheese potatoes and sauteed green beans. Incredibly rich meal!

My husband and child raved. It was very, very good though I found the sauce a bit too lemony. Next time I will cut back the fresh lemon juice to a scant tablespoon. Otherwise, absolutely delicious.

I am an idiot and accidentally went to a store that didn't sell veal. I got pork cutlets instead, but it was quite good. My son even ate it, (I told him it was chicken). I served it with a nice plain pilaf and sauteed zucchini and squash. It's a definite for a quick little dinner party.

Yummy, love the texture of the panko on the veal and the lemon/thyme taste of the sauce! I cut the butter back alot (8 tblsps in the sauce, cooked the veal in olive oild), but still felt a little guilty about the butter afterward.

Excellent and so easy to prepare. Great dish for special occasions or week-night meal.

Ickmay.... it was yummy! I'm encouraging all my friends to eat veal! Take your social activism somewhere else and leave cooks/chefs to do their thing!!!

Prepared per recipe. My sauce separated while waiting for the veal to cook. Next time I would prepare and cook veal (or chicken) from start to finish and hold. Then I would prepare the sauce from start to finish and immediately drizzle over veal. I halved the entire recipe; if you need only half the meat, do not halve the sauce. Yum.

OK people just stop it with the the political social rallys! This is a recipe form, read a recipe form! If your conscious tells you to not eat veal, froglegs , chicken what ever than don't ! But leave it out of here. I don't have a issue with someone saying I altered the recipe for whatever reason,but" Ickmay" from Wisconsin has gone too far. Find another form Ickmay the internet is full of them. Leave the cooks alone!

In response to the cook from Wisconsin regarding the use of veal: I haven't tried this recipe, though it sounds delicious. I also have issues with eating and using veal - but have so many wonderful veal recipes. Now I know I can buy veal from Whole Foods, where I KNOW the animals have not been mistreated or fed diets, growth hormones, or additives dangerous to their health or ours. The veal at Whole Foods is, I believe, grass fed as oposed to milk fed - so it is not as pale - but it's heathier! - and the animals are not restricted or mistreated.

It's really disheartening to read reviews by people who are so enthusiastic about a recipe using veal. Do you know how much a living being has suffered to produce those veal cutlets?

I made this dish last night for my parents 56 wedding anniversary and my family. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed it however, I would cook the veal at a medium temperature instead of medium high. The veal cooked too fast and was a dark brown instead of a golden brown. Additionally, I would prepare the sauce, set aside and add the whipping cream when I reheat the sauce. It had separated and was not eye appealing. All in all, I will definitely prepare again with all ingredients. I served it with the Potatoes Gratin with Gruyere which is also listed in Bon Appetit, and steam broccoli. YUM

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I'm sure it'll be great. Just a note to improve the veal cutlet though from Austria - the home of Wiener Schnitzel. Tradition here is to flour - egg - breadcrumb the veal just before frying. This prevents the breading from becomming soggy. Also, very important, is the amount of oil for frying. This my scare some of you off, but how often does one make a schnitzel. The secret to a perfectly crisp and bubbly breaded veal cutlet is to FLOAT it in boiling oil. Melt Crisco or corn oil mixed with a stick of butter to 3inches deep. This will make a crispier schnitzel. Grüße aus Tirol!

I altered this recipe quite a bit--I used thinkly sliced boneless pork chops, dried thyme, butter substitute and evaporated milk and I didn't have any lemon juice--and it was marvelous. I served it with baked sweet potatoes with ginger-butter and my picky family ate every bit.

The sauce was amazing and was a perfect addition to the veal! Plus it was surprisingly affordable (for veal)as I just bought 2 cutlets to use - no pounding necessary.

As a single person who loves to cook, I am always looking for recipes that can be made for one. This one worked beautifully. I quartered the ingredients for the sauce and used the recommended butter for the veal cooking. The lemon in the sauce melds well with the butter and the herbs. I used thyme and chives frozen from last summer's garden. However it is easier to combine the sauce ingredients, without the butter, and cook down before preparing the veal. This way the sauce needs only to be fortified before it is served.

Tasty. Panko crumbs are light and preferred. This would be an elegant dish for company. With crisply steamed asparagus, it's a winner.

Excellent! The butter makes for a very rich dish, but I wouldn't substitute a thing... it is with thyme BUTTER sauce after all. (Start with an empty dishwasher as you will dirty a number of dishes.) I served with the ROASTED YAMS WITH CREME FRAICHE AND CHIVES, as suggested by Bon Apetit... a great complementary side dish. Better than any veal dish I've eaten out. This recipe is a keeper.

I always rate arecipe based on taste and this dish was excellent; however, it is not a weeknight meal if you are in a hurry--too many pans considering side dishes needed to be prepared. I served the veal with a creamy parmesan orzo and roasted aspargus. I also cut back on the amount of butter used and it still had a buttery taste. Even my daughter who is not a big fan of veal thought that I should make it again.

This was simple and very very tasty! I can't wait to get my hands on some veal cutlets again to make it. They are very hard to get up here. For the people who are worried about "all that butter", you have to remember that you are not consumming all 18 Tbsp.'s of butter, it is being divided. Each persons portion ends up being maybe 1 Tablespoon unless you are drenching the cutlets in the butter sauce. Hence the word "drizzle".

Great and easy. Kids loved it too! I will absolutely make this one again.

Outstanding! And so decadent with all the butter! I made the yams with creme fraiche and PLAIN broccoli on the side. The vegetables helped balance all the butter, but it was sooooo delicious. My husband swooned and that was a first!

I would certainly make this recipe again, as a matter of fact my husband requested that I keep it, but with my alterations, thus the 3 fork review (it tastes 4 fork to us, though!). @18 Tbls. of butter for 4 peaople? I just couldn't, so during the frying step I cut the butter back by subbing in half olive oil for half the butter called for. I also cut back the butter called for in the sauce step to 8 Tbls. I didn't reduce the sauce to a glaze as suggested as I wanted enough sauce to coat all the cutlets. I wanted that delicious buttery-subtle lemony-thyme sauce on each and every bite! So I had more than enough to pour over all the veal slices instead of 'drizzling' per the recipe. I also needed more panko crumbs than the 2 cups called for but they do make all the difference after grabbing for plain dried bread crumbs for the final cutlet that I needed to coat. Those store bought crumbs simply brought a bland/stale flavor to the cutlet, while the panko just accented that delicious sauce! Four thumbs up in this house!
