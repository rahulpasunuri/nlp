Here's what I did to punch up the flavor: added a couple of strips of bacon, chopped, with the shallot. Sure, it's not as healthful, but it was awesome!

I like unusual recipes and this one surely qualifies. I used chicken breasts sliced lengthwise, and the dish made an interesting visual presentation. My guests thought it was tasty, I loved it. Next time I will increase the amount of veggies. It is also a conversation starter. Who knew there were so many tales about Brussels Sprouts and how to grow them!

This was good, but nothing stands out. Turkey cutlets are a little bland (add cayenne, paprika or other spices to the flour mixture to kick it up.) Brussel sprouts and cranberry mixture was also just OK. We all gobbled it, but we didn't have any raves. Recipe gets a B-for taste, a C for texture, a B- for ease of preparation, an A- for inexpensiveness, and a B for presentation. Overall score is a B-.

Picked up Brussel Sprouts at the Farmers Market and made the dish as written - yum, very good and very easy to put together along with the citrus mashed sweet potatoes and apple pie.

Delicious, Quick and Easy. I made this with rubbed sage because I didn't have any fresh. I increased the chicken stock for a little more gravy and also threw in a pinch of crushed red pepper for a little extra bite. When I make this again, I may wait until the end to add the brussels sprouts as I overcooked mine slightly this time. I loved this recipe.

I liked the brussels sprouts, which are delicious with the butter and cranberries, and my fiance like the turkey and cranberry combination. I am not a meat-lover, but the turkey paired well with the brussels sprouts.

Some reviewers are tripping, this recipe is the joint! I have made this many times and it always comes out great. Don't overcook the turkey! It doesn't take long. Also, make a good pan sauce/gravy after in the same pan...start with a roux, add broth, etc. Delicious.

Made this tonight for dinner as written except I used pounded turkey tenderloins instead of cutlets. The brussels sprouts were delicious but we found the turkey to be very bland. I might make the veggies again but will not do the turkey with it.

Didn't find turkey cutlets, so I used chicken breast. The chicken is really good and tender. As for the rest, I wasn't too crazy about the cranberries, it was sort of weird with the brussels sprouts. I will definitely make the chicken again this way but serve with some other side vegetable.

I am a vegetarian so I skipped the turkey...for some reason the brussels sprouts and cranberries caught my eye. I made this dish for a family dinner, and everyone LOVED it. The following week we had a pot luck at work and I made it again. On the way to work I started to doubt my choice of brussels sprouts...what was I thinking? Really Brussels Sprouts! I thought my coworkers would think I was a freak. No one was more surprised than me, when it turned out to be the hit of the evening.

Easy to make, super easy clean-up with one skillet, and fairly tasty. Had to make with chicken since couldn't find turkey cutlets, but turkey would be better.

Loved this! Followed recipe as directed and it was very tasty. Turkey was very moist and tender.

I thought this recipe was very pretty but quite boring. I had to use chicken since everywhere seemed to stop selling turkey cutlets. I wish there was more of a sauce. The chicken was dry but lacked flavor. This was easy and okay but did not thrill my family.

Excellent! Made this as a quick meal for my family and I turned out great. Easy to make and everyone loved it. Made exactly as written except substituted dried rubbed sage for the fresh (couldn't find any). Used about 1 tsp.

A perfect quick skillet recipe. Very tasty and a good way to present brussels sprouts to skeptics.

Great healthy flavorful meal. I substituted dried cherries for the cranberries. Worked great as cherries are sweeter than cranberries! The last tablespoon of butter at the end is not really necessary, add a little more olive oil if it's dry. I used dried sage from Penzey's -- also a perfectly fine substitute.
