This one is a keeper as I've made it twice in as many weeks. Simple, delicious, and an ideal use for the abundant summer squash still being produced in the garden. (I skipped the croutons, scallions, and cubed zucchini the first time around though). As other reviewers have suggested I reduced the amount of stock used for cooking to 3-4 cups, adding liquid as needed at the end to bring the processed soup to a desirable consistency. I also used not quite twice the amount of fresh rosemary. Added seasonings this time were a dash of cayenne, and a hint of nutmeg to accompany the salt and pepper.

Best soup ever! I made it to my parents and to my cousins...they are asking me for the recipe!

This was delicious! I thought the rosemary might be overpowering, but it really works. I added a bit more garlic and, like previous reviewers, added some cream just before blending. I also threw in a few carrots that needed to be used up. I didn't bother with the garnish, except to grate some parmesan over the top. Delicious and healthy way to use up zucchini (as opposed to the mountains of zucchini loaf that I usually make). Great for lunches and hopefully for freezing!

As I've planted WAY TOO MUCH zucchini, I was searching for ways to use it and I tell ya, this was a huge hit. I read the reviews prior to making it and took a few hints and added a few more cloves of garlic and a big splash of heavy cream just before serving. I garnished it with buttery toasted croutons and I sauteed the one zuch for the garnish with a little more garlic--I love garlic! It was memorable.

I doubled the recipe and made this as the 1st course for a dinner party for 10. Use only olive oil, no butter. Doubled the amount of rosemary. Served it warm with green tomato cheddar cheese muffins and a dry white wine. It was a big hit. I am make it again this hot weekend and am planning to serve it cold...

Great soup, even without the rosemary (don't like it), oil (forgot it) or blending (don't have a blender). I used a sweet potato which added nice color.

To make this more Weight Watchers friendly I only used 1 tablespoon of oil and no butter. I also only used 4 cups of stock, 4 cloves of garlic and 4 teaspoons of rosemary. It was really yummy and good both hot and cold. I'll definitely make it again and again.

Very good recipe. Mild, subtle, yet good; perfect texture, neither too thick or thin; a perfect light summer soup. My only change was to use veggie broth; all proportions remained as stated. The only complaint was "not enough". I will double it next time & try leeks instead of onions as another reviewer suggested.

This is a really simple recipe and makes excellent use of an abundant zucchini crop! I added some curry and lime and it really gave it an extra zing.

A quick and healthy use for our abundance of zukes. I made it exactly as is, consistency was perfect. Maybe it's watery if it hasn't simmered in an open pan. It was good as is, I think a few pieces of crisp crumbled bacon and a little parmesan blended in would be great, but there goes the healthy benefit. Could definitely taste and appreciate the fresh rosemary.

This was so delicious! In the Pacific NW, summer doesn't always mean lovely weather, and so this hit the spot perfectly as comfort food for a chilly day, but with fresh vegetables from the summer garden. I took cues from previous reviewers and only used 4 cups of chicken stock and stirred in a touch of cream at the end. The texture was creamy, velvety, just right.

Rating: 4
i make this soup vegan using nondairy margarine (Earth Balance is the best) and vegetable broth. Sometimes i use dried rosemary when i don't have fresh on hand, and it still comes out delicious. i tend to up the quantity of rosemary to make it a little kickier- about twice as much. it's one of those rare soups that, to me, tastes great as soon as it's done- where most seem to need to sit for a day or two to reach their potential.

Rating: 3
This was a great recipe - easy to make, doesn't take long and very customizable. I agree with the other reviewers that you should go easy on the Chicken stock - you can always add more. The garlic and rosemary are musts (I added more rosemary because I liked the flavor). You really can put anything in this soup as long as you have those ingredients and the potatoes to make it creamy.

The zucchini I used may have been too moist, as I ended up with little more than green tinted water and had to add more zuc and potato to make it edible.

I love this soup. I did take some advice from some of the other reviews. For example: I added three roasted parsnips, ginger and adjusted the amount of stock to five cups. I put some lemon in it and won't do it again next time. Rosemary and lemon are nice on meat but not with zucchini. I like how this soup became creamy, I am very happy with it. I follow The Eat Right 4 Your Type Diet for B blood type and I was happy that everything fell in line with it. YUMYUMYUM!

Loved this soup! Scraped the sides of the pot with my fingers to get those extra tastes. The zucchini and crouton topping was nice texturally but not entirely necessary- the puree alone is absolutely delicious. (I agree with other reviewers that 6 cups broth is too much- I pureed in some silken tofu and roasted parsnip to get it properly creamy)

I made this with vegetable broth for my vegetarian daughter and it came out bland - needs the richness of the chicken broth. Swirled in a bit of cream (less than 1 Tbs) but next time possibly a chipotle pepper or some other smokey flavor.

A wonderful creamy soup, without cream or milk products. I did modify it though. I cut the chicken broth to 32 oz. (one carton) and added, just before serving, a poached and shredded, or torn, chicken breast. I poach my chicken in water with 1/4 c. white wine or vermouth and fresh ground pepper. When I added the chicken breast, I also added the thin sliced, quartered zucchini and the sliced scallions. I warmed the soup before serving, and passed grated romano cheese. P.S. I used home grown zucchini,& scallions.

I keep using this recipe and my kids and I are experimenting with the ingredients. This is a very subtle soup, but it is very creamy without the guilt of cream. The last batch I made we called the "everything but the kitchen sink" soup, because I threw in every vegetable I had that was fresh and was going to go bad (leeks, zucchini,yellow squash, a couple carrots, potatoes, onions, and cauliflower). The soup was fantastic and I topped it off with bacon bits. The kids are still begging me to make it again and I have to say I am loving the fact that they are BEGGING for more veggies!

I thought this soup was pretty bland. I couldn't taste the rosemary, which is strange since rosemary tends to be a bit overpowering. I might try it again using more than the recipe directs but there are just so many other zucchini soup recipes out there that might be more interesting.

I've never used the word "luxurious" to describe a food but I just can't get that elite adjective out of my head when thinking about this soup! The texture is so creamy despite the fact that there isn't an ounce of cream or whole milk (or anything else fattening for that matter, save a tad bit of butter and vegetable oil). I will make this soup again and again and again. And did I mention it was simple to make?!

This was a very quick and easy recipe to make and is perfect for the extra zucchini from the garden. I followed the recipe, but swirled a bit of cream at the very end and topped it off with bacon bits and Parmesan cheese. The kids loved it! My 3 year old asked for seconds, then licked the plate!

Lovely soup! I am swimming in zucchini and was looking for a new way to use it. I love the texture of creamy soups, but try to avoid massive amounts of cream. The texture of this soup is light but creamy. The rosemary leaves a pleasant aftertaste and it leaves you feeling content, but not heavy. I'll make it again for sure!

What a delicious soup! I followed other reviews and used 4 sliced zucchini and only 4 cups of chicken broth, and next time I might cut down the butter and oil by about half. The immersion blender pureed it well. Shaved Parmesan made it perfect, and I can't wait to serve this at a dinner party.

A surprisingly light and subtly flavored soup. I used sweet potato instead of regular potato. Uses up a huge amount of zucchini--a good reason it's going into my zucchini recipe rotation.

Rating: 4
I found this recipe years ago when I grew my first bumper crop of zucchini, and now it's one of the main things I look forward to when I'm planting my garden in the spring. I actually follow the recipe very loosely, depending on how much zucchini I have and how many potatoes, etc., and sometimes I substitute sweet potatoes for some of the russets, or use yukon golds. It's pretty much impossible to mess this up as long as you don't forget the rosemary. And the other thing is that pouring in the cream at the end is absolutely essential for that amazing taste. It doesn't take a lot, but just a teaspoon in each soup bowl adds a whole different level of delicious to this soup.

Rating: 4
Delish! I followed most of the recipe (used veggie stock), but subbed cauliflower for potato and added a 1/3 cup of plain Greek-style yogurt at the end. Because I was concerned about the final thickness, I left some of the broth out of the final blend. Topped it with sharp cheddar and another dollop of yogurt. My extremely picky husband LOVED the soup.

I'm on the South Beach Diet, so I used cauliflower instead of two potatoes (eyeballing to get two potatoes' worth of florets).

I also used summer squash for the puree and zucchini for the garnish. Voila!

Luscious! I used yellow squash, so the color was a lovely golden (some other reviewers weren't too happy with the green). I added half a green pepper and a few small potatoes. A very creamy consistency. The rosemanry gives it an irresistible flavor. I also took another's suggestion to add the juice of a lemon. I think that might be essential. No need for the croutons.

Great soup! I made the soup as written and wouldn't change a thing. I used a giant zucchini from the garden so it might have been more than 3 med. zucchini but the thickness of the soup was perfect. I just added a few croutons and fresh sniped chives at the end and devoured it. Great recipe for using up all the zucchini in your garden.

I have made this quite a few times and it has been a hit every time. I've been asked for the recipe on every occasion. It's a great way to use up those extra garden zucchinis. Moreover, I have always used zucchinis that I have left on the vine too long and would otherwise go to waste. I've used some really huge zucchinis with no ill effects to the soup (using an amount roughly equivalent to 3 medium ones, of course). I always use fresh rosemary from the garden, sometimes add an extra potato to thicken it up, and occasionally add a mild to medium hot pepper with the onions (Hungarian hot wax). It gets pureed with everything else and adds a subtle jolt of heat which I love. The recipe doesn't need it, but I enjoy this variation. Also, I find the soup doesn't really need the extra cubed zucchini (not pureed) added at the end. I find the recipe quick and easy, too. What's not to love!

Thanks to Epicurious, I always have a wonderful soup to serve at holidays or family gatherings. I tried this one because it was from the Eastern Shore - beautiful place. I made this last year when zucchini and rosemary were abundant and then tried it again for Mother's Day to rave reviews. I didn't garnish it with extra zucchini, but threw it in the pot instead - so no problem with thickness. Homemade croutons or a bit of sour cream are good on top though. This is very light and not rich at all.

Quick and easy. I used dried rosemary since I didn't have fresh and didn't bother with any of the garnishes since it was just for me. It was quite flavorful alone. I agree with the the previous poster, pureeing was key. I used extra potato based on previous reviews and was pleased with the consistency.

This stuff rules. I've made it several times, it's always a crowd-pleaser, and I've never had a problem with thickness. To the cook from Temecula: not pureeing it is sort of like not cooking it - YOU LEFT THE ZUCCHINI CUBED!?!!11! Gee, I wonder why it didn't work. To the cook from Castro Valley: an average zucchini is probably 8 inches long, so yours were a bit on the small side. Remove the spamtrap to email me.

The cook from Boston must have had very small zucchini. This soup is very delicate and tasty. My question is; what is a medium size zucchini? Mine were about 5 to 6 inches long, and I added an extra one. It still needed some thickening. The rosemary tweaked the flavor just right!

This is yummy! A great way to use up surplus zucchini from the garden. I only used 1 tablespoon butter and no oil. I also used Maggi Chicken Boullion cubes for the broth (2 g of fat in one, I used 2 1/2 cubes) -- It's a really good boullion that gave this soup a wonderful flavor. Also, I'm not crazy about putting hot soup in a blender, so I used my hand-held immersion blender, which does the pureeing trick just as well. Definitely try this!

I made this for lunch because I had potatoes and zucchini I needed to use. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Not too rich, easy and quick to prepare, and utilizing ingredients most cooks have on hand, this soup should be a favorite of those who try it. I added it to my favorites.

Per comments of other reviewers, I used two potatoes instead of one. I also added a stalk of celery with the onion and during the pureeing stage, I added a dollop of sour cream I had no other use for. The family thought it was delicious and I also thought it made a very elegant presentation for such a homey soup. Will make for company someday.

I made a few adjustments, I doubled the recipe and increased the potato to (4)four and shredded them, subsituted olive oil, and used one large 2 lb zucchini, shredded.

This is an easy, nice little soup. It is a bit thinner than I usually prefer (perhaps because I used a HUGE zucchini and it gave off more liquid) but that is easily remedied by cooking it down some more. The rosemary, onions and broth give it a lovely flavor. I didn't change the recipe this time but I think you could easily add a bit of cream, or a dollop of sour cream, or even a sprinkling of cheese to gussy it up a bit. Also, I don't much care for boiled zucchini (the garnish) so I sauteed mine in a bit of butter instead. White pepper added a nice flavor as well.

Really good soup -- tasted even better than I thought it would. The rosemary really picks up the taste and makes the soup sparkle. I used my hand-held blender to puree the soup, and that worked fine; the soup was just right -- not too smooth, not too chunky. The taste was just lovely, and I suspect it would taste just as good a day or two after being made (which would be handy when company's coming for dinner). The croutons, green onions and blanched zucchini added at the last minute really make the soup pretty.
