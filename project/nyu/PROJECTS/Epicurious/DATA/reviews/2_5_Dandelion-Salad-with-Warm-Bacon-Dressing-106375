Both my Pennsylvania Dutch grandmothers made this, but they added a bit of sugar to the dressing, making it sweet and sour.

I used this recipe with one little tweek. I was making this as super for myself and my grandma. She wears dentures so when making the bacon dressing I let the dandelion greens wilt in it to make them softer and I served it over toast. It was a wonderful dinner for the season.

As someone who lives in Germany, I say that this IS a German salad. In fact, I have a bunch of Löwenzahn (dandelion greens) in my fridge right now, I was looking for something new to do with them. This salad is almost exactly what my (german) mother-in-law makes, except she adds mustard and maggi to her dressing, and hard-boiled egg to the salad. Whoever says 'dandelion greens aren't german' has never been to Germany. Rant aside, this salad is delicious (also with mâche, which has a longer season) and is often found on the menu in our apartment.... guten Appetit!

I couldn't resist. To the cook from Beverly Hills, the person from PA is saying that although bacon dressing is Germanic, dandelion greens are not. She obviously knows what PA Dutch is. She's not the stupid one here. Oh, and I thought this recipe was very good for the amount of effort required. I made it less salty by using pancetta instead of bacon.

I don't understand why there is an argument going on as to where this recipe or the ingredients originated. To the author that started the argument who is aparently from PA, how do you NOT know that Pennsylvania Dutch IS German! Duh! You are from PA? I am trying this dressing tonight on spinach. Yum.

good base to adapt... had seen dandelion so saved recipe but had to substitute curly endive, then couldn't get shallots so saute'd cooking onion... and had some rye bread so cut off the crusts and fried it in the bacon fat. Made a perfect dinner for one tossed in a bowl with a glass of merlot.

Wow! This was SO salty! The dressing is good, but don't put the 1/4 t of salt it calls for. Served with spinach salad

Dandelions are not just african and middle-eastern. They are sometimes found in Dutch recipes.. after all, dandelions grow in more regions than just warm mediterannean climates!

While the use of bacon dressing is of Germanic origin, including potato salad; dandelion greens have been used for centurys in the Mediterranean,Africa and in the south eastern USA,certainly not a Pennsylvania Dutch contribution! It is essential you use the most tender leaves and not just from anywhere because of pesticides etc. that might contaminate the leaves. We like this as a base on which we place a nicely grilled strip steak.

i couldn't believe it when i saw this recipe here! it's a traditional pennsylvania dutch dish that we make every easter. if can be very bitter if the dandelion is not young. we have to get the dandelion from the farmer's market or our yard...i can't imagine where you would be able to buy it in other parts of the country.
