Meh. I made this for New Year's Eve. My husband and I thought it was fine/good, but nothing extraordinary. Perhaps we are just way too much of chocoholics - we would have liked more chocolate flavor -but it definitely benefited from some vanilla ice cream. I will say that it was very easy to make and a convenient size for the two of us!

For a souffle virgin, it was an easy and successful dessert. My husband liked it, my tummy liked it. What more is there to say?

Fabulous. I made these for Christmas eve dinner with a little liqueur and set them aside to cook after the meal. We loved the texture, and a dollop whipped cream really set off the flavors. This will most certainly become a part of our dessert rotation.

This is embarassing to say, but I actually made this recipe and forgot to add the chocolate! My boyfriend teases me about it to this day, but honestly, even with just the cocoa powder, they tasted great. Unfortunately, they sunk in the middle after I took them out of the oven (not sure how to tell when they're fully cooked inside), but the texture and fluffiness remained. I made creme anglaise with rum as an accompaniment; strawberries would have been a nice addition too. Overall, this is the perfect dessert to follow a rich or heavy meal - I look forward to trying them again... with the chocolate next time.

I made this recipe last night for a New Year's Eve dinner party and received rave reviews from everyone including my husband who is not a chocolate lover. The souffles melted in our mouths and had a wonderful chocolate taste. I followed the recommendation of the chef from Chatham, NJ and made the chocolate pastry cream earlier in the day. All I had to do at the last minute was whip the egg whites, fold into the chocolate, and then pop the souffles in the oven. I will definitely make this again!

This was my first time making a souffle, and this recipe turned out great. Wonderfully fluffy rise, great creamy, airy texure, rich chocolate flavor, and was fairly easy to make. Would definitely make again -- will be effortless to make after a little more practice.

I especially like this, because it uses ingredients I always have on hand, and serves just two. Used pyrex custard cups, and it worked fine.

This was the first time I'd ever made souffles, and they turned out beautiful and delicious. It's a wonderful light dessert, with simple ingredients that are always on hand. Next time I might serve them with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream and a few raspberries.

I always thought souffles were hard but this did not seem bad at all. I have made for my husband 3 times and every time they came out perfect. I have actually made this into a bridal shower gift. I give the bride the recipe and then provide all the utensils to cook it. Everyone loves it.

This recipe is excellent! I did change it a little by adding a 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and I used 1 oz bittersweet chocolate instead of the unsweetened. Dusted with powdered sugar and served it with vanilla bean whipped cream and some berries on the side. This is one of the best chocolate souffles I've ever had!

With this recipe I made 3 souffles. Although these were very quick and simple to make, there wasn't much to them. I found myself wanting another right away. And although they are good, I thought they were a little plain. I think if I had served them with a creme anglaise sauce, that would have made them feel more substantial. I'll definitely make them again, however I'll double the recipe to make larger souffles and I'll serve them with a sauce to give them more pep.

This was a delicious recipe!! They were very easy to make and came out perfect. I agree with the cook from Ridgewood, NJ that there was more than enough batter to fill 3 ramekins.

This recipe is relatively easy and absolutely delicious. Fresh raspberries are a natural complement. (Oh, and for anyone that has not worked with unsweetened chocolate before, do NOT sample it in the raw. I don't know what I was thinking, but I won't do that again.)

I always thought souffles were hard to make, but this was very easy and delicious. I did not find unsweetened chocolate so I used a couple of Dove dark chocolate squares instead. I also added a drop of Grand Marnier and 1/4 tsp. orange rind, which is a great addition if you like the combination of orange and chocolate flavor. Next time I'll try raspberry.

This recipe apparently brings out the romantic in many of us (New Year's Eve, Valentine's Day). At our house, it followed cauliflower cheese soup, baked wild salmon, and stir-fried zucchini with ginger to usher in 2004, though well before midnight. I whisked in the egg yolk while the chocolate cream was still hot, to be sure of killing any salmonella or other bacteria, and added 1 T. Kirsch (almost any liqueur could be substituted: peppermint, Tia Maria, Cointreau, etc.; next time I'll use 2 T.). I folded another 1 T. of kirsch into freshly whipped cream, sweetened with confectioner's sugar, which I served separately, dusted with cocoa, in a small glass dish. My partner greatly enjoyed adding a dollop with every other bite. Responding to the cook from NYC (7/03/01) who asked whether the shape/size of the baking dish was important: After I had amply filled 2 standard white 3/4-cup ramekins (1 1/2 inches high and 3 1/4 inches across), lots of batter remained, so I buttered and sugared a third ramekin. With the same size dishes, this recipe would serve 3, but it was even better for serving 2, because we split the third one, a special treat after polishing off the first two.

I make this for a group of us on New Year's Eve and everyone loves it. It is fairly easy to make and you can prepare it ahead of time. An excellent ending to a delicious meal.

These individual souffles are very easy and delicious. I have made these more than half a dozen times and they always turn out beautifully. I serve them with a simple raspberry sauce. (Just puree thawed, frozen berries, strain through a fine sieve, then sweeten to taste with powdered sugar.) As for the cook from Boerne, TX, the problem you had with the overly wet souffle comes from cooking them in a water bath. The ramekins should simply be placed in the pan dry, without any water. Try it again; this recipe is worth it.

I tripled this recipe to try out on willing family members, but I wasn't thrilled with the result. Everyone else seemed to like it but I thought it was too mushy in the center, even after 5 extra minutes (I was afraid to go much longer). I baked it with the ramekins in a water bath. I must have done something wrong for it to be so wet. It did have a good chocolate flavor, though, and was not too sweet.

These are fabulous- very easy and come out with a fluffy top and mushy center. I poured them into ramekins and froze them for a few days, then put them right into the oven and they came out perfect.

I made these souffles this evening and my boyfriend and I both loved them. I had never made souffles before, but it was fun and not difficult. I just realized also that I completely forgot the unsweetened chocolate but didn't notice. Also, I baked them about two minutes less than the time suggested and they had a lovely, pudding center. I will definitely make them again for guests.

I had chocolate souffle for the first time last year and had to find a recipe to make at home. This one is the easiest I've found so far and it's come out great every time.

Wonderful and Foolproof! I'm always looking for easy dessert recipes being a novice cook and this can't be beat! I thought I had ruined it because the mixture looked clumpy to me, but it turned out fine. I would leave it for a few minutes longer than stated, but otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

Fabulous souffles; and easy! Can't wait to make them again. A real hit at our New Year's Eve dinner party. All guests participated in the making :) We also made a raspberry coulis to pour on top right out of the oven. Yummy.

After living in New York, NY and tasting the best souffle ever, I fell in love and have been searching for a recipe just like it ever since. I found it!! This is so wonderful. Thank You.

Outstanding! I've made this several times, and my guests always love it. I've always made this in ramekins or custard dishes, because I can't conceive how this would turn out in gratin dishes. It's an easy, delicious dish -- believe me, I've done my best to screw it up...

No review, just a question: does the shape/size of the baking dish matter for the souffles? Can I bake them in deeper custard cups instead of the shallow gratin dishes?

This dish is spectacular. I have made this several times over the past 3 years for my wife, and now whenever she needs a little pick me up, she just puts the ramikins on the counter. 20 minutes later Chocolate delight. :)

Not a review of this recipe, but a comment. I learned from a friend about 20 years ago that any souffle can be prepared right up to the point of popping it in the oven. Instead, it goes foil wrapped into the freezer. Take it out and unwrap it about twenty minutes before you plan to start cooking it, then cook it for not quite twice as long as directed. I've done this scads of times and never had it fail. Madeleine Kamman says a corningware dish can be removed directly from the freezer to the oven. I haven't had the nerve.

I made this for Valentine's Day and it was wonderful! I added 2T butter, because I wasn't reading carefully. I also threw in the second egg yolk, because I hate to throw away anything. I baked the whole souffle in a 500-ml (maybe 2c) baking dish for about 25 minutes instead of making individual souffles. It was wonderful-- not too sweet and a great chocolate hit. Also, the top and sides were crispy and the interior was soft and satiny. I agree with the reviewers who said to get the best cocoa and chocolate. I served it with whipped cream.

very easy and always fantastic. I've made this many times for company, and even when people can't finish dinner they wolf it down. I prepare everything ahead up to adding the eggs. then I let the mix sit while we eat, and after dinner I quickly finish the recipe and bake while people are talking and having coffee. Beating the egg whites takes some time, but don't do it ahead! I cook in a water bath. Make sure to bake it all the way, I found I had to add a minute to the bake time, and always serve immediately. I sprinkle with razberries and shaved white chocolate.

This is a wonderful, easy and impressive dessert! My dinner guest was loving me and I was loving myself. I tried refrigerating this overnight and baking it the next day -- don't try it. The texture really comes out best if prepared and baked right away, but is still great done in advance per JM's (reviewer from Chatham, NJ)instructions.

Perfect souffles! I used a hot water bath to bake them and added creme anglaise sauce. This is described well in the recipe for "Grand Marnier Souffles with Creme Anglaise" from Gourmet 1997. The creme anglaise was delicious and was fabulous with the chocolate. I tripled the amounts without a problem.

I have made this souffle many times over the past several years for both special occasions and mid-week desserts. If I am serving it for a special dinner,I make the pastry cream in advance and beat the egg whites just before I fold them into the pastry cream and, then bake the souffles immediately. This allows me to serve an elaborate and elegant dessert, yet minimizes kitchen time while I still enjoy the company of my guests!
