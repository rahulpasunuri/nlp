This recipe is fantastic - but I find it is much easier to control the consistency, etc. if you use dark chocolate (not unsweetened), just a smidge of corn syrup (trying to stay away from HFCS) AND if you double it. That seems to be the key: doubling. Who doesn't want extra hot fudge anyway :-)

Made it twice. Too much effort to try to get the consistency right when there are so many other good hot fudge recipes around.

I followed the recipe exactly but I thought it tasted slightly bitter (almost like when chocolate burns) but I did not even cook it as long as the recipe said. It was good but not as rich and creamy as I am used to, and you can really taste the brown sugar to the point where it did not taste like hot fudge. I will give it another try next time with part regular sugar and part brown sugar.

WOW! Definitely a keeper. I made this twice this weekend, once for friends and served over vanilla ice cream with toasted almonds and bananas. I put more cream in to get it to the consistency I liked. It has a slight carmely undertone. Will definitely make again (and again and again and again).

This recipe really is fantastic! I have tried several hot fudge sauce recipes and this is by far the best one! Very rich and chocolatey. I prefer to let it cool off quite a bit before putting it on ice cream so that it can thicken up. I used about 1/2 cup cream the second time so that it wasn't as runny when hot. YUMMMMMY! It is sooooooooo good on a piping hot, fudgey brownie with french vanilla ice cream and whipped cream!

I nearly died when i tried this hot fudge, it is exactly like the lush sauce served at Greg's ice cream in Toronto.
