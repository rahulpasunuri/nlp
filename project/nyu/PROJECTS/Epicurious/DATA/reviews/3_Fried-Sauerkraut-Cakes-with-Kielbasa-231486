These made a great quick dinner. I added some grated apple and they were delicious. Browned them well in a non-stick pan with just a little oil & butter. Yummy.

You need to get the cakes really brown for them to taste good. But it makes a mess of the pan

We thought these were too greasy, and a waste of nice homemade kraut.

Loved it - used some left over mashed potatoes instead of raw and was quite pleased with the results...everyone scarfed it right down...

This is a great pantry recipe! Wonderfully easy & delicious. I don't understand the point of putting the the dough into the 1/4 mold & then flatten -- do it by hand; also, kielbasa, even reduced fat versions, don't need to be sauteed in much oil.

Great recipe for South Beach Diet, even Phase 1 if you use turkey sausage or kielbasa. Agree with others, cook meat and "cakes" in separate pans and serve immediately. No need to put in oven. Used refrigerated sauerkraut in glass jar and a full 1/4 cup measure for each cake. Cut in amounts in half to serve two.

The sauerkraut cakes in this recipe have become a go-to contorno with a variety of main dishes in my kitchen. They are easy to make and they look great on the plate. I have made them both with and without rinsing. Rinsing does nothing to enhance the flavour or texture so, like previous reviewers, I wouldn't bother (do get the sauerkraut as dry as you can though). I also agree that they are best served straight from the pan (after patting them with kitchen towel).

Yummy if you DON'T RINSE THE SAUERKRAUT. Also, these are best served hot from the pan. The directions say to let them warm in the oven while you cook the Kielbasa. I say heat the Kielbasa in a separate pan, so things are done all at once. I served this with the Red Cabbage with Bacon and Caraway recipe on this site and hot mustard to accent the Kielbasa. Very good combination.

This had been in my recipe file for a whole year before I got around to making it. Yum, next time I'll skip the sauerkraut rinsing, and I may ad some bavarian spices for a little more interest. Served with chicken apple, and pork, fig and marsala sausage. It's a keeper.

I really loved this recipe. It's extremely simple and just a great change of pace. Not a huge fan of kielbasa but I buy it more just to make these!!

Yuck - and I happen to love sauerkraut.

I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and replaced 1/2 the sauerkraut with potatoes. I wonder if you could chop the kielbasa finely and add to mix to make appetizer sized cakes?

Very interesting. The second time I made this I used 1 1/2 cup of kraut and 1 1/2 cups of grated un-peeled russet potatoes. Bingo! Almost had to wrestle my wife to get my share

Very, very easy. Very good. Different enough to spice up your weekday dinners without being a huge hassle. This is definitely the new side dish to kielbasa.

We all loved the sauerkraut cake! We eat them with grilled porkchops (with applesauce) too.

Both my husband and I had the same initial reaction upon tasting these: "Weird...but good!" Like others, I did not rinse the kraut and I'm glad. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of Penzey's Bavarian Seasoning. These are fun and different and I'll make them again. Oddly, they made the house smell like the State Fair!

These are delicious - surprisingly delicate, crips, and light. You could make the cakes smaller and use them as an appetizer base.

Well, I didn't rinse the saurkraut, just drained it well and patted it dry. We thought these were great, the browning of the patties sweetens the 'kraut,so there's a nice balance of sweet and 'sauer'. Mine were not greasy at all, and oh happy surprise, did not spatter while frying as I expected. Anyway, we really liked these with our kielbasa, and would definitely make again.

I really liked these sauerkraut cakes as a side dish with dinner, without the kielbasa. Hubby turned up his nose, though, as he unfairly compared them to our favorite potato latkes. I used a pound bag of Boar's Head sauerkraut and drained but did not rinse. Thinking that these would work nicely in a nouveau rendition of a Reuben - two of these piled with hot corned beef and Russian dressing in the middle. Really not too different in concept from the original recipe with kielbasa.

this was great but I used turkey kielbasa and no-one knew the difference I got a lot of complements

If it's a choice between having potato pancakes and these, I would choose these. But if it is a choice between sauerkraut cakes and just plain sauerkraut, I would go for the sauerkraut any day--more flavor, juicier, not so heavy or greasy.

Outstanding, for comparision I made regular potato pancakes and everyone preferred the sauerkraut cakes.

We enjoyed these , but when I make them again I will not rinse the sauerkraut. I felt it removed too much of the flavor. I would also add a bit less flour

These were great--but only if piping hot.
