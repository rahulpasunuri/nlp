This a great change for a cold potato salad, everyone loved it. I didn't have enough fresh Arugla in the garden so I had to add some fresh Basil

The cook from San Francisco is right! Balsamic vinegar (I used white) and a bit of basil make this dish much better!

This was a little bland until I made the following substitutions: added a little basil & balsamic vinegar, omitted the butter (which will congeal if you serve the salad chilled), and added some lightly steamed green beans for texture. After that, it got rave reviews!
