Always my go to pie crust recipe, I've been using it for 4 years running.

Having tried many pie doughs, this is the last I'll use. It's become my default - I committed it to memory last year, I just needed to dust it off for the new year.

This is a great pie dough recipe. My wife doesn't like really sweet pie dough and this is perfect. I substituted all butter for the shortening, and it turned out great.
