This recipe wasn't for me. The flavors weren't complementary to the apples I used (Cortland), and, although there wasn't anything wrong with the recipe, there wasn't anything right about it, either. 1 hour was too long for Cortlands (easily solved), but there needed to be a little more pizazz overall.

I agree with hemmybubb. I prepared it for dinner guests and we were not impressed by this one.

I really enjoyed this and it was super easy to make. However, I did substitute a bit with what I had. I used Ricotta cheese instead of whipping cream, grapefruit zest instead of lemon and Marcona almonds instead of regular almonds. I also didn't have apple juice so I just used plain, old water. I thought the flavor was great and the Ricotta gave the filling a nice texture that really complimented the apple. I bet it would taste even better with Mascarpone, but I used what I had.

This did not work well for me. I think you need to remove the skin and cook for a shorter time. I dumped mine out rather than serve it to my family after I'd tasted a serving.

Also try to use cookie crumbs or pie crust crumb instead of almonds. It's great!!!!!

This was okay if you want something different, but it won't impress your guests. We all thought better with the yogurt on top.

Need to cook apples just a little longer. Wonderful blend of flavors.
