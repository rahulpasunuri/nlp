Great recipe! The scones come out flakey and moist and you can get creative, adding ingredients to change it up. Today I added almond and vanilla extracts, and chocolate chips and almond slivers. Like another reviewer, I used regular and whole wheat flours.

This is a delicious, tender scone with just the right amount of sweetness and a hit of tartness from the dried cherries. I mixed the dry ingredients and butter in the food processor, then chilled the flour-butter mixture until ready to put together with the egg and cream. I kneaded the dough very lightly to help bring it together, and then rolled out with a rolling pin to 1 inch thickness. We all loved these.

So good! I got sick of making eggs for breakfast and thought a scone with a cup of coffee would be quicker. These are the perfect size, sweet but not to sweet, and I like the huge dried cherries. I didn't use cake flour (couldn't find it), and ended up using part whole wheat, part regular flour instead, but the taste was still great.

I think this is a classic scone recipe I my American mind. It is not too cakey or too dense and not sugary tasting at all (which I like) and definitely not biscuit-like. The dough is delicate but it is NOT difficult to work with if you are not a perfectionist about shape. I padded the dough down and then cut it into shape with a knife into triangles and added in a little more padding when needed to solidify more. Half of the batch I put cream and sugar on and the other half I did not. I liked the plains ones w/o the topping better. They are more crumbly and I like that aspect in a scone. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a bit of lemon zest (one lemon it could have used a little more). Or maybe a tab of extract in it (vanilla or almond) to make it more complex. Defiantly one of the better scone recipes out there I have made. And very quick! Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Dried-Cherry-Scones-243270#ixzz0i6PR885t

This was good but not great. I measured correctly, but think it had too much of a baking soda tase. Also, I would recommend either vanilla or another extract like orange.

These are very good. Warning: do not take shortcuts with the mixing process. I tried to just cut in the butter with a pastry cutter, and the dough did not come together properly, requiring a lot of handling and some water before I could cut it. I think you have to blend the butter with your fingertips like it says because the heat of your fingers will soften the butter and make everything stick together.

These were some of the best scones ever. A little trick I will share...process all dry ingredients w/ butter in food processor the night before then store in a ziploc. The next am just mix and bake.

This recipe makes exceptional scones, with a fine texture and flavor. I cut the butter into the dry ingredients using the food processor. I then transferred the flour-butter mixture to a large bowl, added the dried cherries and then worked the wet ingredients in. The dough is quite tender and a little difficult to manage. However, in the end, beautiful scones. Serve as the English do, with a cup of tea.

Although this recipe yields really good scones, I find other recipes to be a lot easier and just as tasty (for ex., Joy of Cooking's cream scone recipe).

Delish! I used whole grain organic pastry flour and they were still very tender and tasty!

These are undoubtedly the best scones I have ever had. I used a bottle of clotted cream that I had bought at a specialty store and they were fantastic!
