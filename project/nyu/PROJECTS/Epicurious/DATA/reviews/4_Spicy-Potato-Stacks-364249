Just made a half batch of these today to try for an upcoming party and they are delicious! Just the right amount of heat mixes with the sweetness of the yams...these will become a favorite in my house!

Cook from southfield, there are a lot of people who observe Passover for eight days, four of which are heavy-duty holiday days involving eight festive meals in total. Plenty of opportunity for fussing. :)

I am making these the morning of our Passover Sdeder and after they are cooked going to stack them in my (silver foil) paper lined cupcake pan with the rosemary skewer. Will reheat them while the soup is served! Great presentation! Happy Passover..

Who in the world has the time to roast and stack these potatoes at the last minute when you are participating in a seder and serving one of the most involved meals? Totally impractical and stupid to even suggest this!
