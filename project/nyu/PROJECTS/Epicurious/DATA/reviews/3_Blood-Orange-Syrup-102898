I made this recipe as written, and it was okay. Mind you, I love love LOVE blood oranges. Still, for whatever reason, I found this a bit bitter. Before cooling, I added a tiny pinch of dried ginger powder and just a dash of vanilla extract (all I had in my pantry) and that spiced things up really nicely. Serving it over vanilla frozen yogurt. Yum!

I made the sugar syrup (with the addition of some black peppercorns, which I later removed) and added some finely spiced blood oranges. Wow!

I was disapointed, I boiled this sauce for about 35-40 min and even when it cooled it was too runny. Next time I will try making a simple syrup and adding orange juice at the end next time.

easy to make; very versatel in use. I added a few drops of almond extract which enhanced the citrus flavor.
