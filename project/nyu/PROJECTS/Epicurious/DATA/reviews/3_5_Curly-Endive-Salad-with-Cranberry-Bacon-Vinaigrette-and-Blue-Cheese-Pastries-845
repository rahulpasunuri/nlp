Does anyone ever proofread these recipes? How can you have blue cheese recipes without any mention of when to add the blue cheese?! Yeesh...

I have made this salad several times now with rave reviews every time!!! It is now my favorite salad.

We had this at one of our dinner group's meals and is was a huge success. We did the pastries for the dinner but they were a fussy, cute addition that isn't necesarry. I have subsequently made the vinaigrette numerous times and made the salad with mixed greens. It is very attractive for the holidays.

This vinaigrette is one of my family's favorites for holiday dinners. We're not too crazy about curly endive, so I substitute mixed greens. Also, I did find the pastries too much work, so I just skip them. One other alternative I've added is spiced pecans as a topper instead of the pastries.

Really good with the Pork Tenderloin and Cranberry-Port Sauce.

This is a refreshing approach on salad presentation. Although I must confess, I cheated: I use puff pastry tarts (from the frozen food section). I also keep on hand bags of fresh cranberries in the freezer. I highly recommend this recipe.
