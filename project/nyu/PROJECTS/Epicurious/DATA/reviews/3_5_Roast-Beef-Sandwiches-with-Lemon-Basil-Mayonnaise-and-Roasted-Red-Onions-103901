My husband just said mmmm, mmmm, mmmm each bite he took. I added garlic to the lemon basil aioli as others did, and did the onions in a fry pan and stirred lots as I didn't have time for the oven method today! And, we only had regular old white bread, toasted.

Pretty good. However, the mayo was too sweet so I made horseradish sauce the second time around. Great recipe for the onions.

Made this for a picnic and just wasn't "Wowed". Given the reviews, I thought I'd be eating something fabulous. I had better sandwiches at the corner deli. Time to move on.

These were amazing! I could think of a million uses for that lemon basil mayo - it was so good I was eating it right out of the bowl by the spoonful! Made everything as-is, but added a little minced garlic to the mayo. Couldn't find ciabatta rolls, so I used ciabatta loaves instead.

These were great!!! I did add some crushed garlic to the mayo cause I had tasted it and thought it was missing something. My boyfriend said it was the best sandwich he ever had, even including restaurants in town(and we have some good ones).

Amazing sandwich! I have made these several times. Not only are they incredible fresh... we ate them the next day leftover and they were even better!

I liked the elements of this sandwich...but not the sandwich itself. I toasted the ciabatta and created an open-faced sandwich. Delicious texture/ weight/ crunch. Made the onions the night before and warmed them in the microwave before assembling the sandwich. Easy and delicious! The lemon-basil mayonnaise was also very good. Next time I would blend half of the basil with the mayo and stir in the rest. (Would blend flavors more thoroughly and still retain texture.) But, for me, the ingredients didn't combine well. Too many strong flavors competing for attention. And not worth torturing a defenseless cow... or paying premium price for one that's been treated well.

Great taste ! I made it the first time with the red onions.did not have any the second time and made it with cooking onions - it was just as good.Used leftovers on rice crackers...was nice to have the crunch as well. My vegetarian daughters had theirs with sliced tomatoes instead of the beef and really liked it.

I caramelized sliced shallots instead of the red onion with balsamic and used light mayo and it was fantastic. Seriously "oh-my-goodness" good. I served it for an informal lunch and everyone raved. I'll happily make it again!

These sandwiches were great! Don't leave out any of the ingredients - they all work so well together. The onions were delicious!

A huge hit! THe hardest part was finding ciabatta rolls (I live in L.A so thank god for LaBrea Bakery - call ahead), Did the onions in the onion because I''m lazy. Made the spread half mayo/sour cream. The spread was so good I used the leftovers to serve with the mini crab cakes (this site) I served the same evening. 6 of the LBB rolls cut in half serves 12! Will make again.

I made for a fundraiser, everyone loved them. I used small toasted baguette slices for the event.

Excellent! I made this for my friends, and they all love it. Instead of baking the onions, I just sauteed them, much fast this way and it turned out good too.

This was a big hit after bingo. Everyone enjoyed this sandwich.

Oh my...so good... I admit I was very hungry, tired and lazy when I got home from work, so I just used leftover roast beef, fried up the red onions in a pan and deglazed with the balsamic and then stuck it in a sandwich with mayo, basil leaves and lettuce. But what a great combination - and of course, what always makes a sandwich go from good to great, is the freshest, loveliest bread. I will absolutely be looking for an excuse to make this for a picnic this summer.

I almost gave this sandwich 3 forks except there are others on Epicurious that we have enjoyed so much more--Tandoori Chicken Sandwich & there's a roast beef with blue cheese, watercress & marinated onions that is to die for.

I've made this dish many times now and it always receives rave reviews from my frends. I ususally serve these after we have been to the pub on a Friday night and everyone adores them! Sure to make you very popular!

Very very good. Try it with roasted Chicken Breast instead of the beef sometime, it's positively orgasmic.

One of the best sandwiches i've ever had. I did it again for a meeting of my university mates, almost 20 years after we graduated. Great reviews.

My husband thought it was so-so, as did I, however our guest loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe called for. I served it with a salad with marinated tomatos and cucumbers. Which made for a lovely presentation. I just thought it "needed something". So, I am going to make it again and try adding a Chipolte pepper to the dressing, or~perhaps horseradish. We do tend to go for something with a "zip". So, that may be the lacking ingredient to make this roast beef sandwich stand out from the others. :-)

I agree with the last reviewer - this is missing something, something to awaken the flavors a bit more. Ditto on the onions - cut them larger or cut the roasting time.

Rating: 2
This recipe has great potential, but lacks, in the words of Emeril, "Bam". I suggest adding fresh basil and green onion to the mayonnaise mixture, and use a sour dough or rye bread. Also, cut the red onion larger--it will shrink. The best part is the roast beef, so high quality is important.

Great recipe. Usually we simply slather pesto sauce or warm marinara with shaved parmesan on a roast beef sandwich but this was way more interesting. The onions, I think, make much of the difference, as does rare roast beef. We prefer bold flavors so, I would not skimp on either the shredded basil or lemon peel. Perhaps, as another writer said, a few other fresh herbs would help. Very good for a picnic, lunch or simple dinner.

Fabulous sandwich that was even better the day after the sandwich was actually assembled. The prep work was minimal, and the assembly was quick. Our guests raved about the combination of flavors and many asked for the recipe. This will definitly be a sandwich we make again and again.

This was a wonderful summer dinner with a fresh garden salad. The only change I would make is to add more herbs to the mayonnaise. I've never used italian flat bread but now that I've discovered it I will use it for lots of different sanwiches. It really makes the sandwich.

The onions are out of this world. In my opinion, you can skip the bread, meat, and mayo and just make a meal of them. The mayo is quite fantastic too, and I'm not a big fan of mayo. I generally see no reason that roast beef is a must. I think substituting the roast beef with a favorite meat will probably work just fine too. I'm not a big fan of roast beef on sandwiches and even these onions and mayo didn't change that. Nevertheless, it's a great recipe to liven up the somewhat boring 'sandwich'.

Wow! What an awesome sandwich!! Just made it today for a luncheon. Everyone loved the combination of flavors. Only comment was on the Ciabatta. A bit crusty and chewy for some (though it could have just been our bakery). Wouldn't change a thing. Can't wait to make some more with the leftovers...

Try it with roasted shallots.

Terrific, easy recipe. The ciabatta bread is essential. I sliced the onions extra thin for quicker roasting time. Our two guests raved. I appreciated the left over ingredients for another great sandwich the next day.

This is a GREAT Recipe! Don't substitute anything for the Arugula! It's an important part of the combined flavors! Have tried it on several good fresh breads, including dense multi-grain slices. Such a wonderful recipe to do ahead, take to work, just warm the roasted onions, and assemble in seconds! A big HIT!

I made these for a graduation party this past weekend and they go rave reviews. The lemon-basil mayonnaise and roasted onions set this sandwich apart from all others at the party. I will be making these often.

Along with other "make before-hand" items, we served this at a graduation party. Using long baguettes cut in half length-wise, we made the sandwiches assembly-line style, putting toothpicks in along the length as we went. Without cutting individual slices, we returned the baguettes into the bag they came in and refrigerated. Prior to serving, we cut the bread into individual sandwiches. They were great! The onions - fantastic!
