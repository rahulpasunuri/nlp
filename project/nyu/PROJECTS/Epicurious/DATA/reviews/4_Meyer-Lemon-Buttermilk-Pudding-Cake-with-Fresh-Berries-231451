I made this exactly as written (well, OK, I used all four egg whites, and I added the zest of two Meyer lemons.) It's a wonderful, simply elegant dessert. I couldn't wait for it to completely chill, sampled it warm and it's fabulous. Won't add additional cream when serving it, will use a drizzle of blueberry sauce. 45 minutes was perfect in my oven.

Delicious and pretty. Wonderful because you can make it well ahead of an event or party. Fresh, sweat and tart!

I like this. I liked making it. I liked eating it. It's pretty, it comes out luscious and looks like tremendous effort. I always include grated rind because I like tart things and believe most of the flavor is in the rind. Very much appreciate reviewers suggestions to 1) use that leftover egg white, 2) an oval porcelain dish instead of 8x8 glass--which I don't even own and 3) mostly Meyer lemons and one regular lemon. Now that I have a blender, think it will be even easier to make.

I made this recipe in 6 ramekins (bake 35 min., cooled to room temperature, and turned out onto dessert plates. Topped with blueberry sauce, it is a striking and delicious winter dessert.

This was our New Years Day dessert.... not impressed. I found a sac of Meyer lemons @ our grocer & was excited to try them never having had them before. There was a pudding-cake recipe on the bag but I used this one. First I, like another reviewer, had problems as well trying to get those whites to the airy heights they should have...no, I did not drip a yolk, used room temp whites as well as an immaculately clean bowl/beaters.....my whites looked more like marshmallow fluff. Wonder if that's why so many people used 4 whites perhaps???? However, after repeating the process a second time with the same results, I just forged ahead hoping it wouldn't be a problem...and it wasn't. It turned out perfectly puddingy on the bottom with a light, fluffy cake top. We poured the cream around the base - not needed and didn't highlight the experience at all. The blackberries however, sprinkled around the base did give the wow factor. The somewhat tartness of the berries with the sweetness of the pudding/cake was a nice pop of flavor. Still, in the end, we both thought the recipe was more sweet than lemony. I didn't follow others advice with the regular lemons, and zest, yadda, yadda, yadda because I wanted to make this recipe. Still I'm glad I had the opportunity to try a new fruit. Next time, we'll stick with homemade lemon sorbet, tarte au citron, or lemon meringue pie when we want that lemon zing.

This is by far one of the best desserts we've ever made in our home. We, however pour the whipping cream around the base of our dessert rather than whipping it. When the cream hits the top layer and absorbs it it's a little taste of heaven...

I made this last night and baked it in a 7 X 11 dish because that's what I had on hand. I also added the 4th egg white because what am I going to do with one leftover egg white? And I made a strawberry-rhubarb compote to go with (the grocery had two sticks of rhubarb left so I cooked those with a little water, lemon juice, and sugar until tender, then stirred in some sliced strawberries at the end). Then we were too full after dinner for dessert so this morning I served this lemon pudding cake with the compote for breakfast in bed - I cleared out 2/3 of the pan just for us. My husband totally loved it and it reninded me of the pudding cakes my mom used to make. I will make this again.

I made this for the first time last night, and it will definitely be one of my go-to dinner party desserts from now on. It's easy, and, especially for Americans, who aren't used to English-style "pudding," very unique. I used an oval porcelain baker instead of a glass pan, and I increased the egg whites to four, like other reviews had suggested. I used Meyers, and the flavor is phenomenal. It tastes like a lemon cheesecake, only so much lighter. I did, however, feel that pouring the cream on top was guilding the lily, so I dont think I will do that again. I used macerated strawberries instead of raspberries. I think these can be made individually; just watch until the tops begin to brown, and enjoy.

My meyer lemons were about to turn and I had homemade cultured buttermilk in my fridge, so I searched for a recipe. I made this for a dinner party last night. My husband doesn't prefer lemon desserts, so I used the opportunity of having company over to make this. I found that when I added the sugar to the egg whites, they didn't whip up the way they should. I think the ratio of sugar to whites is a little bit off. I didn't have time to try again and it still tasted great. It turned out really soupy, maybe I could have baked it longer, but it was still delicious. Since it's too early for fresh berries, I used frozen mixed berries to make an easy berry coulis (simmer berries, water, and sugar, blend, strain, refrigerate). Everyone was raving at the party, including my husband! Then almost half the people admitted that they usually don't like lemon, but assured me that this was great. I believed them because there wasn't any left! My only complaint was that the presentation was really soupy, but I will use the ramekin idea next time.

I was a little afraid of this recipe since it involved whipping egg whites and a water bath but it turned out to be both easy and delicious! It's perfect for a dinner party because it looks impressive but is made ahead of time. And even though it's not really "light" it's a refreshing note at the end of a big meal. The berries are a must.

Rating: 4
I hadn't had pudding cake in decades, so made this for a potluck on a snowy day. Absolutely delicious, although it had to bake much longer than the recipe states, probably due to having to mess with the &*&@@# water bath. Because this is in a rather low baking dish, it's more difficult to manage than using a water bath for a cheesecake in a springform pan; there is much more danger of water sloshing into the cake. I used regular lemons, and served it with blueberries and blackberries and cream whipped with limoncello.

Rating: 4
Very good, with great lemon flavor. Made according to recipe, and like others also had to bake this about 15 minutes longer than stated. Perhaps the water bath wasn't hot enough, or was too deep? Anyway, freezing meyer lemon juice now so that I can make this again in the summer. Would be a great hot weather dessert.

Health lovers: Wonderful and I made it to my health specifications and love it! I changed the sugar to 2/3 cup agave syrup. I had to use 3 duck eggs vs. the 4 chicken eggs because of my chicken egg allergy. It worked great and I cooked it for only 40 minutes. Tastes like Lemon Meringue Pie in a cake. Awesome!

I followed the recommendations of others before me, and my husband exclaimed that this was the best dessert I've ever made. It is pretty good, but honestly wouldn't give it that moniker. Even so, dressed up with some fresh raspberries, this is a relatively sophisticated looking dessert, with easy prep, making it in the running the next time we have dinner guests....

I bake at least 4 times a week and this is one of the BEST desserts I have made-it is light but yet filling and was a big hit with everyone. I cooked the cake a bit longer so there was less pudding but still had some. I topped with strawberries and whipped cream but would also use blackberries or blueberries. Awesome!

I don't quite understand the idea that Meyer lemons somehow aren't lemony enough for this recipe... I made it with them and it was extremely lemony. Maybe there is a lot of variation among Meyers. I used the 4th egg white as suggested by several other reviewers. I found it only needed 40 mins in the oven to be properly browned. I served it with berries and creme fraiche.

Definitely keep the cream and berries - it ups the wow factor. This will become my go-to dessert.

To the cook from Graham NC - egg whites whip best at room temperature - cream whips best when it's cold

Rating: 4
The flavor in this cake was excellent and very refreshing after a heavy pasta meal. I too used standard lemons rather than meyer, and I thought the tanginess was one of the best features of the cake. My only criticism is that I would recommend powdered sugar rather than granulated for the egg whites; I tried it with organic cane crystals and my whites promptly deflated and I had to start that step over. I'd also recommend chilling the mixing bowl prior to doing the egg whites step. I added zest as recommended by other reviewers, and think that kicked up the flavor nicely. We got 6 serving out of it (with berries). Very, very yummy!

made with regular lemons and skipped the cream. it was delicious, and would surely be even better with the meyer lemons. i have also had this dish at a restaurant, and was in fact trying to duplicate it when i found this recipe. at the restaurant, they cook it just to the point that there is no "pudding" left at the bottom. There is still a big difference in texture between top and bottom, but it would all be classified as "cake." that version is delicious, too!

This is a perfect springtime dessert - creamy and light with seasonal berries. I served it with strawberries, blueberries, and rasberries. The cake is very light and it's kind of hard to tell when it's done, but I took it out after the specified baking time, and it tastes wonderful chilled. I definitely think it's best when combined with both cream and berries.

This was beyond fabulous! I originally picked this recipe out for a dinner party, but couldn't find Meyers. Since I'm fully aware of the pleasures of the Meyer, I wasn't willing to risk this recipe on Eurekas. I finally found some Meyers last week at a farmers market, and man-oh-man am I glad I held out for them. I used the juice and most of the flesh of one lemon (to equal the proper amount) and the zest of 2. The only other changes I made were to use evaporated cane juice instead of refined sugar, and I skipped the cream altogether (I just didn't think it needed it). I topped the chilled cake with some fresh strawberries and it was all I could do not to dive headfirst into the pan. Yum doesn't even cover it. For a dinner party, I would definitely have to make this in ramekins, or none of the guests would get any. I am hyper-sensitive to "sweet" and DH is to "sour", and we were both thrilled with this cake; it has a fabulous balance of sweet and tart with a wonderful lemony flavor. I will definitely be making this again and again.

I have made this twice in the last week, once as a test and once for a dinner party. Meyer lemons are good, but you lose out on the citrus burst in the pudding. If you like Lemon, go for normal (e.g. eureka) lemons, not Meyer. The recipe works well for ramekins and in a big dish. I think it IS possible to "overcook" though, especially with the ramekins. If you cook it too long (e.g. to make sure the top gets brown), you can lose some of the pudding-y goodness at the bottom. It still "works", but perhaps not quite up to potential. Overall, this is a recipe to make again and again.

Rating: 4
Just made this in ramekins and it turned out superb. I ate it warm and plain, no berries or cream. The "cake" was light as air and the "pudding" was creamy and intensely citrus-flavored. I used lemonquat juice instead of meyer lemon juice and added some of the rind too. (Lemonquats are a cross between lemons and kumquats. You can eat lemonquat rind raw, just like a kumquat's rind. As far as I know this fruit is not easily available commercially. Meyer lemons are big, juicy lemons found in backyards throughout Southern California.) I felt it was a waste to throw away the extra egg white, so I included it. (The recipe calls for 4 yolks but only 3 whites.) My mom made a very similar dessert for weeknight suppers. Her version includes a little more flour. If you want a denser, slightly cheese-cakey dessert, up the flour by 3-4 tablespoons. There's no need to do the water bath in that case.

As usual, I made this one time by the book, and then made additional attempts with some modification. Its straightforward and very good. Two comments 1.) I doubled the amount of lemon zest the second time and the cake was better received 2.) I fully endorse Meyer lemons, but I've found one can approximate the flavor by adding just a touch of fresh orange (or better, tangerine) juice and zest. Unless you're a purist -- or a hint of extra, darker color bothers you -- this works fine here. Enjoy.

I made this for Easter on Sunday and it was really nice. Light, but very flavorful. I am making it again on Friday. The meyer lemons give a very nice flavor - you could almost use more lemon juice and less sugar. I served it with raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and strawberries.

I made this for guests last weekend - friends from "the big city" had brought me some Meyer lemons from Whole Foods as they are nowhere to be found in the very rural area in which I live. I found this to be easy to make and we all loved the delicate lemon flavor. I used fresh blueberries, blackberries and strawberries and just poured liquid heavy cream over it. It was light enough to fit into the spaces not filled by a fairly substantial corned beef and cabbage meal! I squeezed the remaining lemons and froze the juice in an ice tray so that I will be able to make this agin when the lemons aren't in season.

Definitely let it be golden brown on top-- take it out too early and it's hard to tell (it's supposed to be gooey inside) but it really matters.

I was expecting this to be better. I made it exactly according to the recipe--not enough lemon flavor for me, and the middle was soupy, not pudding-like. Maybe it needed more time in the oven. The leftovers were still soupy after a day in the fridge. I did use Meyer Lemons from Whole Foods.

I thought that the buttermilk would make the lemon better, but I only got a sort of sour tang that wasn't pleasant. Not a whole lot of lemon flavor, either.

Just made this for the second time. I've been using the lemon pudding cake recipe in the old Betty Crocker book for years. This one is a little richer and I think even easier. I've made it in individual ramekins (I got six servings that way) and baked for about 30 minutes, for just a little nicer presentation. Today I made a double recipe and baked it in a 9" x 13" glass cake pan, and baked it a little longer. The first time, I made it exactly as written. The second time I added the zest of two lemons, and might even increase the zest a bit more. But I like it REALLY lemony. It was gobbled up in no time both ways. Oh, and to 2 previous posters: yes, it will shrink as it cools, I think the texture actually improves a bit. And to Colonia, NJ: you do understand that it isn't supposed to set up like a regular cake? The bottom stays soft, more like pudding.

Forty+ years ago, this was one of my Mom's favorites when "supper was a little skimpy". She kept a section in her recipe box for similar recipes: quick, easy, inexpensive, on-hand ingredients. Her version is somewhat lighter (I can recite the ingredients because we made it only two nights ago) -- 2T butter, 1/2c sugar, 1/4c flour, 3 eggs, 1c milk, the juice and zest from a lemon. On a cold night (or a hot one, for that matter), in her words, "this is divine". Enjoy ...
