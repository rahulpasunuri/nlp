I prepared this for friends and family with a couple of modifications and it was a huge hit. I briefly microwaved the okra (2 min on high) while the scallions were frying, to which I had added the ginger. I then tossed the okra into the pan and quick fried them with a touch of coarse cornmeal and some kosher salt.

not a bad recipe for something quick and it is a good use of okra. next time i am going to steam them and then broil/grill them to get a bit of texture.

Admission: I LOVE okra and probably would love any recipe involving it. Usually I bread and fry it southern style, or parboil and rinse it, serve it with ponzu and katsuobushi japanese style. But I was looking for something different and quick and tried this. I microwaved the okra for about 3 minutes instead of hassling with the steamer --which I think reduces sliminess. Not that I mind sliminess, I rather love it. Also, added a good dose of salt and pepper. I'm eating it right now and recommend to any fellow okra lovers.

I'm not rating this recipe because I had to add a lot to it to make it taste good. I've never cooked, or even eaten okra before, but I picked some up at my local market and was looking for a preparation that didn't involve deep frying it or anything like that. This recipe was good as a BASE recipe, but come on, not even salt or pepper? I added that salt and pepper, as well as lemon zest, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, togarashi (a japanese chili seasoning) and extra scallions. I halved the recipe so I steamed the okra for about 6 minutes, and yeah it was a bit slimy, but it didn't bother me. I did rinse the okra a bit before I mixed it with everything else. Again, a good base recipe, but needs seasoning!!

Delicate and delicious. I really tasted the okra, which sometimes doesn't happen with other recipes because all the other ingredients cover it up. Was afraid that the raw ginger wouldn't work, but it was very refreshing.

For a lover of okra I can see how this would be a good dish... for someone who is new to okra, this just didn't work out for me. The subtle flavors of scallions and ginger were fabulous, but the slimy texture of the okra left me - I'm sorry I have to describe it this way - feeling like I had a mouth full of pleasantly-flavored snot. Not a winner for me, but if you're into slimy foods, this recipe is for you!

This was horrible, and I love okra. The okra was way over-cooked even though I took it out early. The flavors were very uni-dimensional and did not meld. The ginger was way too aversive in big chunks. Needed some heat and who knows what else. Try something else.

This is going in my permanent collection, and will be repeated when okra is in season as it is right now. Even my husband, a confirmed okra-hater, loved this dish! I used okra from our local farmers market--the freshest available.

a very nice, simple preparation for okra, its main advantage being that it is not fried. i'm not a big raw ginger person, but I still loved this!

I love okra but have only had some version that involves frying, bacon and cornmeal. While that is certainly tasty, this recipe adds a new uncomplicated "real" taste for this wonderful veggie.
