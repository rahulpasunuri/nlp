Very disappointing - this recipe was just too bland. I even doubled the dressing and added gr onions and red pepper - but still the flavours just seem to disappear. I won't make this again.

I liked this recipe. It was simple and tasty but not fabulous. I thought the cumin and lemon flavors were nice. I also added some chopped up red pepper for some added color. It's a good, inexpensive and simple side dish to serve.

This recipe needs a more alluring title as the current prosaic one doesn't do it justice. Very delicious, very simple. All the flavors play so well off each other- the cumin, the lemon, the cilantro. Served as a fresh note to a bbq dinner with friends. Will make again.

This rice is so fresh tasting and simple to prepare. It was a hit with our whole dining group. I will use a bit less oil and garlic and a bit more cumin when I make it again tonight. It is a great light tasting side when you have richer dishes to pair with it. We liked it best at room temperature.

This was a very simple recipe. It was more tasty the next day. Great do ahead dish. I added chopped roma tomatoes for color and little more depth. I served it with the Peruvian Style Beef Kebabs recipe on this site. Refreshing and works great with more complex entrees.

I served this at a dinner party and my guests raved. One guest had a third helping after dessert. This is easy, light, do ahead and yummy! I served it cold. It would be perfect for boating, picnics, or those of us who live in warm climates. Everyone has asked me for the recipe.

I was running out of time when i saw this recipe and i have to say i was dubious at first, however the fact that it was easy to make, i decided to give it ago. I changed nothing and i was pleasantly suprised.I served it with some chicken kebabs and asian coleslaw, all my friends enjoyed it including me and i dont even like cilantro!!
