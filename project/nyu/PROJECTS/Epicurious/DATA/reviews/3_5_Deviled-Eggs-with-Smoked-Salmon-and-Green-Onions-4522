I give this 4 forks when made with good-quality mayo instead of the potato/oil mixture. Be generous with the salmon and all the seasonings. I've made these eggs many times for family gatherings - especially Easter - and they always disappear in less than 5 minutes. This year I've made a double batch so that we don't have to fight over the last one...

HAd some left over salmon . Did not have all the ingrediants so substituted. Omitted the potato and olive oil and lemon juice . Used cream cheeese and dry mustard . Added capers and a small amount of fresh dill. Very rich . Served with marble rye and pumpernickel bread .

First time making Deviled eggs, and yummy but a bit dry. I skipped the potato & would add a bit of mayo for that smoothness I like in the filling. Otherwise, great with quality smoked salmon. Disappeared at my party.

This is okay, but not knock your socks off. The crowd to whom I served them didn't really notice them being different from your everyday deviled eggs, which is a shame considering the price of smoked salmon. I think the flavor of the salmon is key; mine was really mild.

didn't have whole grain dijon so just used regular dijon. other than not having the right mustard i would have made this as is. it is delicious without adding anything extra and especially if you are looking for a change from regular mayo/deviled eggs.

This was very good. I impressed my southern family with a twist on a family favorite. I used all yolks, omitted the potatoe and added mayo for moistness.

Add the mayo, it won't be the same old eggs. I chop the salmon and mix with yolk-mayo mixture and use capers. Made twice before - both times a big hit. They do only last about 5 minutes. Leftovers make good dip or sandwich spread.

This was such a great change to an old standard "entertaining dish". I didn't add the potato and I placed a small amount of the smoked salmon on the top of each one.

I would make this again but might try deleting the potato and substituting mayo or creme fraiche for a creamy filling, even low-fat sour cream or yogurt might be interesting. The recipe makes twice as much filling as you'll need - I put the leftovers in a bowl and served as a spread with rye toasts. As is, the filling is quite dry but the flavors are good.

I agree with other reviewers that there is too much potato in this recipe and that mayo or even sour cream would make a nice addition.

I made these last night for my Bunko group and they are fabulous! Lots of flavor and not too overpowering of the smoked salmon. I did 1 1/2 times the recipe for 10 eggs and it made WAY too much filling - probably 3/4 cup or more. I suggest using a 5-6 ounce potato but definitely use the potato. When I mashed the ingredients together they were a little dry so I added a touch more oil and lemon juice to moisten. No mayo! then it's just another standard deviled egg recipe Great finger food for a cocktail party and the presentation is great too.

No potatoes, add mayo, garnish with capers. Excellent way to use up leftover smoked salmon.

I made these for a tailgate (mostly men) and they liked them...but without the mayo, it wasn't quite good enough! If I do make it again, I would not forget the mayo!

When my sister asked me to bring boring deviled eggs to a family get together. I thought, I'll show her, I'll bring deviled eggs no one will like. Now I have to make the deviled eggs for every family function and I'm forever giving out the recipe or telling people where to find it on Epicurious. They are scrumptious.

Didn't have dijon, so used golden brown mustard, added a little white wine and mayo. What a hit! After you fill eggs with mixture try "rolling" them in the salmon and then green onions. It was a great Christmas appetizer.

I took these deviled eggs for a dish to pass. I also did not use potatoes, and added Mayo. They were very good and went quickly.

I made this for a Superbowl party. I added a little mayo to make it creamier. They were eaten in no time.

Quick, easy. I used egg yolks only and sprinkled the finished product with minced fresh dill as well as the green onions. Doubled the recipe and took to a Happy Hour party. They lasted about 5 minutes!
