These are fantastic. A serious improvement upon the cookies mom used to buy us when we were children. I wouldn't change them a bit.

Yummy and refreshing. Took hints from previous reviews: added 1/6 Tsp lemon extract to the filling and increased the lemon juice and zest in the cookies and filling. Also spread a thin layer of raspberry jam between the two cookies. Perfect combination of flavors. These were a delight!

These were good cookies. I added the lemon extract to bump up the lemon. The cookies alone did not have a very intense lemon flavor.

I have the original recipe from last year when they were called "Lemon Sandwich Cookies" which calls for 2 C of flour. I made these tonight. As others have said, I prefer a more pronounced lemon flavor. I will see if they get more lemony as the days go by. I need these for a dinner party Saturday night. I will add the T of lemon juice next time if they don't get lemony on their own. I also burned my first batch. I knew 15 minutes was crazy, so I set it for 9 minutes and they burned. I love the cookie. I think it has a wonderful flavor and crisp texture. If I can't get the cream right with this recipe, I will experiment with other creams. These cookies are too good to let go just because of the cream.

I saw this recipe in June '09 issue of Gourmet. The amount of flour is 2 cups and the dough is rolled out to 1/8-inch thickness for a crisper cookie.

I used a 1.5 in. cutter and baked for 6 min. and they came out the perfect sized bite of cookie. I overbaked my first batch baking in 9 min. DON'T OVERBAKE these cookies, they really need to be soft. Also, I took another reviewers tip and refrigerated the dough for awhile then rolled the dough between sheets of wax paper and let it finish getting firm in the fridge before cutting. It was great to have ready to cut sheets of dough waiting for me and made the process really quick. I too think the lemon flavor could be more pronounced and actually had to had 1/2 a tsp. of lemon extract to the frosting which helped.

I'm a chemist so I like to think I have a pretty good handle on measuring. But, somehow this cookie dough ended up being the most sticky, gooey mess I've ever tried to roll. I ultimately deemed it completely unrollable, despite having chilled small rounds of it in the fridge overnight. I had to just mold some of the cookies by hand, and put the rest between sheets of wax paper, rolled it and froze it before making more. I ended up just making huge cookies out of some of it. Anyway, the cookies themselves have a hint of lemon flavor...but I didn't find them extraordinarily different from a standard sugar cookie. The buttercream filling was delicious, but it definitely does kill the joy of eating cookies when you know just how much butter you are eating in every bite.

I was very surprised by the soft, almost cakey texture of the cookies. The subtle lemon flavor of the cookies themselves goes increadibly well with the sweetness of the lemon cream filling. I would suggest rolling out the dough, not on a floured surface as the recipe calls for, but between parchment paper to keep the dough from getting too tough and overworked. These have become my staple summer cookies.

I thought these cookies were good, but not great. Unlike some other reviewers, I did not think the cookies had a "bright lemon flavor"; I thought it was muted. I have to say I agree with McKenna123 - I prefer a more pronounced lemon flavor. After tasting the filling, I did increase the amount of zest in it (added about another 1/2 tablespoon of zest and also some lemon juice). What would really be good is to try using lemon curd as a filling - I think I will fill the rest of the cookies with that. If I make this recipe in the future, I will increase the zest and the lemon juice reduction, as well.

These are ridiculously sinful, addictive and delicious! I tried as is with great results. For Easter I am considering trying to make orange or lime cookies as well...wish me luck!

I made these earlier this week and they received rave reviews. I agree with other reviewers that the consistency of the lemon filling is a little thick. But it's so delicious! Rather than thin it out, I actually made a second batch and used all of it for the 36 cookies I got out of the recipe (maybe I have just have a big sweet tooth because I could not get enough of the filling). I am making them again today!

Warning: these cookies may cause addiction!! They are the best lemon cookies!! Some hints: add the 1 T. lemon juice to the the filling; roll between parchment paper; make sure you refrigerate as recommended and do not roll these too thin.

I wish there had been a photo of these cookies, so I'd know how they were supposed to look. I rolled my dough thinner than the recipe called for (and pricked them with fork, for looks), baking them at 350° for 11 minutes. Since they were thinner, I ended up with a gazillion cookies! Unfortunately, I only had enough confectioner's sugar to make a half batch of filling, so I ran out. The cookies were very tasty, and had lots of lemon flavor, but they were a lot of work. But I have to say, that lemon reduction smelled wonderful! Since I had so many cookies, I added a thin swipe of raspberry preserves on several 'tops', which were very pretty. The raspberry added another layer of flavor to the lemon. I have leftover unfilled cookies, and I'm toying with make a lime filling, and adding a layer of blackberry preserves. Or maybe orange filling, with orange marmalade.

Delish. I've made these twice-- both times were a smashing success. Rolled the dough slighter thinner then suggested and baked for 7-8 minutes til they were just delicately golden on the edges. One note about the yummy filling-- first time I made it with salted butter but forgot to decrease/omit the additional butter. Omitted the extra salt from the filling on the 2nd round and they were perfect.

these are awesome! bright, lemon flavor and fun to make. i microwaved the filling for 15 seconds to soften it enough to spread after refrigeration. i followed the recipe and (for once) got the exact yield specified. the only modification i made was to decrease the oven temp to 350 degrees. (there are few cookies that need to be baked at a temp higher than this.) definitely make this cookie! as many of you know, dough & filling can be refrigerated for several days before use. made 2 batches for use this week - yummy!

This is a great cookie, full of lemon flavor. My mods were to use a slightly smaller cookie cutter (less than 2") and I still got 36 cookies out of this recipe instead of the 24, though I did re-chill and re-roll the leftover bits from the first cuts I made. If I make these again, I will probably roll the dough a little thinner than what it recommends. It gives a pretty thick cookie. I also rolled the dough out onto waxed paper BEFORE chilling so that I could simply cut the dough without handling it too much, knowing that it might crack when rolled if it was too cold. I had great results; the cookies maintained their shape while baking due to less handling by me. I agree with other users that the 2 cups of packed powdered sugar for the filling is a lot. Not only is it super sweet, but it makes it difficult to spread. I'd cut back on the amount, adding only until you get it the consistency you want. I use a microplane for zesting but could not get the peel as finely as I would have liked for the filling. Maybe next time I will chop it after zesting as well?

Highly recommend these cookies. My friend is a lemon-anything fanatic and she ate quite a few of these. They went fast at a party we took them too. My children helped and we used christmas themed cookie cutters. Had quite a lot of lemon cream filling, leftover, even after putting generous amounts between two cookies. Great cookies!

These were fantastic - REALLY lovely and I brought them to work, gave them to friends and will be serving them at a party! I got more like 50 cookies, not 24, and I used 2 inch cookie cutters. However, I would recommend using at least 1/2 less powdered sugar in making the filling - 2 cups is ENTIRELY too much. Mine tasted plenty sweet and I used about 3/4 cups.

I made these as written but used slightly larger cookies. The cream takes a while to get to room temperature, especially if it has been in the fridge for a while. I needed 3 hours for this to happen, so plan ahead. Overall the cookies were very good and my guests liked them very much, but personally I prefer a stronger lemon taste.

I made these as written, except that I made them smaller (and cooked them less time) because I wanted to include them on platters of Christmas cookies. Very good. I did not need any extra liquid in the filling as noted by previous reviewer. Maybe it's an altitude thing. Delicious, and I will definitely make again.

Very good but time consuming. I think they taste better with thinner cookies: some of mine were thicker than others.

These cookies are delicious. They were a big hit with everyone with whom I shared. I will definitely be making them again.

These are fabulous cookies for lemon lovers. I made them exactly as written.The only change I would make next time is to use a 1 1/2" cutter to make smaller 2-3 bite cookies. I did also try a variation substituting red grapefruit zest and juice and those were great as well. I found though that the grapefruit cookies required slightly less baking time.

I made these for a party, and they were sensational. People loved them! The only changes I made: I used salted butter and reduced the salt by half. I had to add some lemon juice to the butter cream filling to get it to be creamy, but that enhanced the flavor. Also, when I made the boiled lemon essence for the dough, I ended up with about 3 tbs. plus. I ended up adding it all in to the dough to lighten it because it became so thick. But again, this made the flavor a little richer. I baked all the dough bits from in between the rounds, and they are great by themselves.

You may have to add 2-3 Tbs. of some type of liquid (water, milk, whipping cream, etc.) to make the filling come together. I did.
