Well, I made this two nights ago and was just ok... and I just realized I forgot the sour cream! So I'll hold off on the fork rating for being an idiot. (Sans sour cream, I'd say a 2.) Having said that, there was too much liquid - next time I'll half the stock and reduce it down for a lot longer before adding to the crock pot. I also threw 2 chopped garlic cloves in with the onions and paprika. I'll definitely try it again and see. I love the idea of slow cooking during the week but it's challenging to find recipes that have a lot of flavor. This one is as good as most.

For those who say this dish was lacking in flavor, perhaps they should consider it is a Hungarian dish. Many eastern European cuisines are not necessarily loaded with bold flavors. It met our expectations, and the only change we made was to add 3 cloves of minced garlic. And definitely needed more sauce, so in went more broth.

I have made this several times and just love it! Easy and delicious - what could be better. However, I don't use a slow cooker. Just pop in the oven for about 1.5 hours and it's lovely.

Disclaimer, I have never eaten or made paprikash before, but this was not what I expected and I wasn't crazy about it. I halved the recipe and made alterations based on ingredients I had in the house, substituting chicken breasts for thighs and Greek yogurt for sour cream. However, the end result tasted to me like a spicier version of French onion soup...the onion far outweighed any other flavor for me, and it wasn't very creamy. It wasn't awful but I wouldn't bother making it again.

This recipe is alright, though I suspect it might need a cook's individual touch to be really good. I sauteed the onions first, then added the garlic (3 cloves, minced) to the onions along with the paprika, and sauteed for 2 more minutes. I used a mixture of regular and smoked paprika. I used 2lbs of bone-in skin-on chicken thighs, but did not decrease the amount of stock. After 5.5 hrs in the slow cooker, I moved the chicken to a bowl of hot egg noodles, and transferred the liquid to the stovetop to reduce and adjust seasoning. I added a little extra smoked paprika and some Vegeta (Croatian vegetable seasoning). I think I doubled the sour cream but I imagine any cook would just want to adjust to their liking. Then poured the thickened sauce over the chicken. So, my boyfriend and I really liked this, but I can understand how it may need a little help. I've made paprikashes before, though never in a slow cooker, and when I am in the mood for a dinner that isn't very involved, I would probably make again.

This was good, & will make again. Going to look thru comments to see if I can crank it up a notch. Used 1T paprika, 1t smoked paprika, 1/4t red pepper flakes; perfect. Onions didn't get soft enough. Definitely serve with butter noodles, green veg.

I used bonless, skinless chicken thighs and tripled the amount of garlic. And miss out the dill. Worked great! Plus I didn't cook this in a slow cooker. It sort of reminded me of beef stroganoff, hense I missed the mushrooms and peppers.

It wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. But the other 3 in my house loved it...go figure!

Prepared this dish with bone-in Chicken Breasts, but otherwise left the recipe unchanged. The final flavor is excellent, but as others have commented, the sauce is thin. Serving with Spaetzle, Egg Noodles or some other starch to absorb some of the liquid seems required  and delicious. Next time I will dust the chicken in flour first, increase the amount of reduction when I deglaze the pan and strain, then defat the sauce before adding the sour cream.

This recipe is very yummy, but I hate to drag out the slow cooker if I have to cook on the stove top anyway. Kind of defeats the purpose of a slow cooker. That said, I don't think it would be the same without first browning the chicken.So, while a good slow-cooker meal, not for busy weeknights. I serve it over noodles. My whole family loves it.

I made for my 3 boys, I used all skinless chicken breasts, dredged in flour S&P. I had leftover grilled sausages so I cut those up and sauteed in olive oil. I I thickened with flour and served with rice. My 3 boys cleaned their plates. Makes a good week night dinner and was super easy.

My family loved this recipe...even my teenaged daughter who's a fairly picky eater. I strongly urge you to find the hot paprika that this recipe calls for. I think it makes a big difference. I also rounded out the flavor of the sauce at the end by adding a little bit of a chicken bouillion cube (to taste).

Wonderful recipe! I added another tbsp of butter to the the broth when simmering. I also used cayenne pepper in place of hot paprika per another reviewer's suggestion. Sweet with a little kick - will be recommending this to everyone!

I used the recipe more as a base for creating my own dish, don't have a slow cooker so I browned the chicken (breast & legs) and cooked it in the oven @ 350 for 30 min. I put the onions in the bottom of a casserole dish with the browned chicken on top. Sprinkled Hot Paprika (at least double what the recipe called for) and S&P on the chicken. Instead of stock, I used a boullion cube (brought back from Hungary - so not sure whats in it -Eroleves) and 1/2 C boiling water, added this to the pan I browned chicken in with about 1 Tbsp of paprika paste (unprocessed minced hot paprika). Poured this over chicken and put in the oven. It was great, a little spicy and very flavorful.

I made this recipe because I was recently given a slow cooker and have trouble finding recipes that actually sound appealing. This one was delicious. It could be much spicier if you like spicy food, I agree with the reviewers who recommend adding more spice. The fresh chopped dill takes it from good to great.

This recipe is disgusting and does not represent any Chirke Paprikas recipe I have seen in my Hungarian Cookbook. Furthermore when you add sour cream to any hot dish, without preparing it, it will curdle. Try the following: cook your meat on the stove top in a large skillet, then add your onions, (8) cloves of garlic, and hungarian paprika. When the meat is finished cooking remove it from the skillet and add 2 cups of water to the skillet. In a separate mixing bowl combine 1 cup of sour cream at room temperature, 1/2cup of milk, and 3 tablespoons of flour. Bring the contents of the skillet to a boil and then add the sour cream mixture. Lower the temperature and whisk until it reaches the desired thickness. Return your meat to the skillet and you are finished. Obviously add the spices of your choice. My favorite for this dish is 1 tbls. of Tony Chacheres creole seasoning.

very enjoyable. Added Indian spices to it (butterchicken, but I can see tandorri working too), in addition to the paprika, and added 8 minced garlic cloves to it. Served with brown rice

it was very enjoyable served with brown rice. I did add a healthy dash of Indian spices (a butter chicken mix) to the onions and doubled the onions and added 8 minced garlic cloves to it. Instead of dill I used cilantro

I thought this was great, and I used grocery store paprika. My modifications were: I skinned the legs, used a little more olive oil to compensate, doubled the garlic, used 1 1/2 Tsp of paprika and 1/4 tsp each cayenne and chili powder in lieu of the hot paprika. The biggest difference, and I think what made the dish, was I probably used at least a CUP of Breakstone's Reduced Fat sour cream. Then to make it more kid-friendly, I strained out the onions and de- boned the chicken before adding the sour cream. I served it over noodles for the kids, and I enjoyed it by itself - a great and EASY addition to a low carb diet!

I have to say this is the most disappointing dish I've ever made from this site. The chicken was ugly, the sauce was thin and lumpy (even after adding sour cream), and the whole thing tasted... totally bland and unremarkable. You could just as easily boiled a chicken to death, sprinkled on some paprika, poured the boiling water over it all and gotten the same result. I'm a good cook and can usually rescue a dish in distress, but not this one. My boyfriend agreed never to speak of this disaster. I gave it one fork because you can't give anything lower. The chicken was tender, but that was the highlight of the dish. Everything else was a waste of ingredients.

We live in Montana and eat game birds on a regular basis. I've used this recipe with pheasant, and for the first time didn't get tough, dried-out birds. I cook it according to the recipe, but before finishing with sour cream and dill, I take the pheasant out, take it off the bone, and cut it into small pieces. We serve it over pasta or rice. Raves every time.

I used a saucepan and chicken breast instead. I dusted the chicken w/flour b/f browning and I used one onion & one yellow pepper. In place of the chicken broth I put in a can of chopped tomatoes. I served it w/parsley noodles and it was very good.

As with everyone, I didn't stay true to the recipe. I added sliced mushrooms, some chili powder and doubled the sweet paprika. I also use bone in thighs, drumstick and breasts for variety. Finally I doubled the chicken stock because there wasn't enough liquid in the slow cooker. It cam out great and I loved it but it isn't really the same recipe. I served with dumplings because I didn't have time for Speatzal which is the tradition

Rating: 4
Our family just loved this, we are big on flavor and this delivered. I used chicken breasts, as it was what I had on hand, I can only imagine how much better it will be next time with the bone in chicken. I watch "Big Daddy's House" on Food Network. He swears by "smoked paprika". So I had some in the pantry and used that since I did not have the spicy paprika. It was perfect, such depth of flavor. The sour cream mixed in at the end did not really thicken the sauce, but we still enjoyed spooning it over the chicken. A keeper for sure!!

Great recipe for the busy cooks out there. My husband, who hates sour cream, raves about this dish and actually looks forward to taking the leftovers for lunch! We live in southern NM, so instead of the two different paprikas, I use sweet for the teaspoon and hot red chile powder for the tablespoon. It's great!

Rating: 2
Nice for a simple recipe and something a but different. I doubled the hot paprika and added 2 red bell peppers in place of one onion. Also doubled the garlic as others have suggested. I think the sauce benefits from a bit of reduction and defatting before adding the sour cream. I ended up with a nice thick sauce with those modifications.

Rating: 4
A delicious, super-simple meal that was a big hit in my household. I used bone-in chicken breast cut into pieces, and upped the amount of sour cream. Without the extra sour cream I found the paprika flavor too strong -- but I did use some powerful paprika brought back from Hungary, so perhaps this is why. I plan to put this recipe on heavy rotation for the winter!

Chicken paprikash is usually served over spaetzle or sometimes rice. If you don't have a spaetzle maker, I suggest getting one. It works so well and the spaetzle are uniform in size and tender. Rice is great also, but we prefer spaetzle.

For you purists out there, how is Chicken Paprikash usually served? Is the chicken taken off the bone or left on? Do you serve it over noodles? Rice? I'm cooking this now in my slow cooker and my house smells wonderful.

This could be so much better. Why chicken legs and not thighs? And why only ONE clove of garlic? Paprikash also ALWAYS has sliced green and red peppers in it. Where are they here? Keep searching for a decent recipe.

I used bone-in breasts and slow cooked it for 5 hours. Next time, I'll cut the time to 4 hours as the chicken was falling off the bone. Sauce was good, but I agree with others that it needs a little something extra. Adding the dill really improved the dish and gave it more taste.

I used this recipe as a reference guide, and it was good for that. I did not use the slow cooker, instead I cooked the chicken thighs in a deep pan. I tend to use extra spice than specified in most recipes, so I did that here. I only had sweet paprika, but added some chili powder for a bit of heat. I served this dish over spaetzel, which compliments the sauce, onions, and chicken perfectly. You must add the sour cream to make this taste creamy and authentic.

To the reviewer below: paprikás is defined by sour cream. Without sour cream, paprikash becomes pörkölt. Also, paprikash does not have "meat balls" of any sort. Two main types of paprikash exist in Hungary: chicken and veal. The former is made with whole legs and thighs, the latter with cubed veal. Both are stewed in their own juices and sour cream is required to finish the dish.

Rating: 1
This is a fair imitation. Real paprikash has little beef meatballs and there is no sour cream. You don't slow cooker it. If you use much more paprika (not hot) and use a whole chicken or 2 depending on your crowd. It doesn't need sour cream. This recipe doesn't have nearly enough paprika or garlic. My grandma made the best Hungarian paprikash ever!

Rating: 2
This was a decent dish but I think it needed just a little bit more oomph. Next time I make it I will use more spices, and probably will substitute 1/2 the chicken stock with dry white wine, just to give the dish a little more zing and to thicken the sauce some more. This dish is even better the next day after it has had a chance to marry the flavors in your fridge.

Rating: 2
I used boneless skinless thighs to avoid all the grease from the skin. I really enjoyed the flavor of the sauce, but next time I will use a mixture of white and dark meat. Using all dark meat was too rich for my taste. Excellent sauce, though. Served with egg noodles and parsley.

Sorry folks, but this was TERRIBLE! I spent $16 on "gourmet" paprika and the chicken ended up mushy and bitter. I am washing off the sauce and making a chicken salad so not to waste any more $$. I usually love the things on this site; this was not one of them! :-(

I have made a very similar recipe for years. I just pop everything into the slow cooker in the AM before work and add the sour cream when I get home and make rice to accompany it. I use about 3 Tblsp of Hungarian Paprika and 2 cloves garlic chopped. I will often add some corn starch to thicken the sauce. I never bother browning the chicken and use whatever I have on hand (thighs, breasts, frozen, thawed). I use a can of chicken broth as well as a can of chopped tomatoes along with some oregano. VERY easy and a real crowd pleaser. Everyone loves it!

Great flavor, butter-tender meat. My only complaint is that the sauce was a bit thin - maybe I'll add a bit less broth next time to reduce it or use that thickening trick in a previous post.

We found this recipe delicious although I forgot to stir in sour cream. I used skinless chicken legs to save calories and found that in that case the chicken cooks faster. Next time I will cook it for 4 1/2 hours.

I lived in Hungary for 5 years, and this recipe is pretty decent. Cooking method is a little different, but the ingredient list is more-or-less traditional. There are two keys to making such a simple dish great. 1) High quality paprika. I use Pride of Szeged, and only the sweet variety. Most Hungarians I know make their paprikash from sweet paprika. Some do as this recipe, blend half and half. Anyhow, only Hungarian or Spanish paprika will do. Not red pepper flakes, not cayenne pepper, not McCormick's. If your paprika doesn't smell like the essence of red peppers, find a better brand. 2) Good quality chicken and leave the skins on! I make a skinless version of this with breasts sometimes, but it's not the same recipe. The fat and the skin is where a lot of the "chickenness" of this dish comes from. (I don't even use broth when I make paprikash the traditional way). It's not a dish for the health conscious. Also, fry your onions in lard, if you're not squeamish about that sort of thing. The only thing I would change is to use lard or a neutral oil for the olive oil and maybe add a little (1 tsp) more paprika. Otherwise, fine recipe.

Rating: 3
The only thing I changed was to use 3 lbs of chicken thighs (instead of legs), and skinned and deboned them. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I don't know what everyone is complaining about with the sauce being thin! It was nonexistent! I will make this again, but with the following changes: I will increase both kinds of paprika (mine is direct from Hungary, and it was not enough), I will also increase the onions and broth considerably, and then use more sour cream at the end to compensate (the sour cream is the thickener!). It's a good, quick weeknight dinner though.

Rating: 3
This was a very easy recipe and is great for a Sunday night family dinner. I used skinless thighs, and pulled the chicken out when it was done to debone it. I agree with a previous review that the sauce is thin, so I made a little roux on the stove, added the sauce and boiled it for 5 minutes to thicken and reduce.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious, and so easy. I didn't have hot paprika, so substituted red pepper flakes, as others suggested. I also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and fat free sour cream. Chicken was very tender. Served it with fresh asparagus oven roasted in olive oil and sea salt. This is a definite winner.

I replaced the sour cream with a fat free version, used Hungarian Paprika and a sprinkling of crushed red pepper. I also used boneless, skinless thighs. I served it over whole grain brown rice. My family put it on the list of recipies to do again, so it's a winner. And so very simple.

i did not rate this recipe, as i made some changes to the original. i do not care for chicken on the bone in braises (just don't like the flabby skin), so i used boneless skinless thighs. i skipped the rubbing with garlic step and just added 2 cloves of chopped garlic. i increased the sour cream to 1/2 cup. when the chicken was finished, i removed it from the sauce and shredded it. before returning the chicken to the sauce, i pureed to with an immersion blender. the pureed onion mixture was a nice way to give the sauce some body without having to use flour or cornstarch. oh, and i cooked it on high for 2 1/2 hours. it turned out well with the changes. very quick to assemble.

I thought this was great! It was a nice simple recipie so I had my doubts. I used frozed chicken tenderloins because that's what I had on hand and it came out moist and delicious and the sauce was great. Unfortunately I'm cutting carbs so I was yearning for some rice to soak up the yummy sauce.

I cooked the recipe as directed and the chicken was falling off the bone tender but it needed some extra flavor. Also, I used a brand new container of Hot Paprika and it was hoter than I expected. I will make it again using some of the other recommendations.

My family really enjoyed this recipe and we will make it again. I did modify a few things. I didn't have any hot paprika, so I put in 2 TBSP of sweet paprika and 1/4 tsp of hot chile flakes. I also added 1/2 a green pepper diced to the onions. After browning the chicken, I poured off all but 1 TBSP of the fat, then added one cup of chicken broth, 1 TBSPP of tomato paste and reduced it to 1/2 cup. 1/2 hour before serving I stirred in 1/2 cup of low fat sour cream, and 1 TBSP of cornstarch blended with 1/4 c. of water. I served it over broad egg noodles with the dill and additional sour cream on the side.

I really liked this recipe. I used more paprika then what it called for and also used garlic butter instead of regular butter when I fried the chicken legs. The flavor was very good and the sauce came out this very rich red color which made a beautiful presentation (I served this on a bed of egg noodles, the sauce was awesome with the noodles). My husband requested this again on Sunday, so I guess this recipe is a keeper!

Rating: 2
Dish has potential, but the flavor was weak; needs to be more "chickeny." Next time I'll try adding 1-2 tsp. boullion crystals to the chicken broth. The sauce needs thickening, so will remove chicken next time and add a mix of 2 T. flour stirred into 1/4 c. cold water, then cook that for about 10 minutes (on high), then add the sour cream before returning the chicken to the sauce. Tip: Stir a few T. of the bubbling sauce into the sour cream first, before adding, to prevent curdling. Lastly, I cooked the meal on high for 2 1/2 to 3 hours instead of 5-6 on low. Chicken was very tender!
