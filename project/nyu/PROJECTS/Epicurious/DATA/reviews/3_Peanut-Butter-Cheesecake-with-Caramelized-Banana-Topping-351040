This is a wonderful cheesecake. I think you could use as much peanut butter as you want, depending on how much you like it. One cup is a good medium. The bananas are a great combination, although I used a different recipe for the sauce, a banana rum sauce! You can find this recipe on gourmet.com on the banana upside-down cake (a must-try to believe!)

Decent, but not as earth-shattering as some other BA cheesecakes I've made. Do NOT put it back in the fridge once the bananas are on (at least prior to initial serving)--I did, and the butter-heavy caramel set up a little bit. Still tasted fine, but didn't look as good.

I served mine with a side of grape jelly, and it was like the best pb&j that I ever had.

Made this for an office lunch and it was a hit. The combination of carmelized bananas and peanut butter was liked by all. I used Trader Joe's all natural creamy peanut butter, which I think has a very good, strong peanut flavor. I think some natural peant butters can taste rancid or "off" and that would adversely affect the flavor of this cheesecake.

Disappointing. Some liked the carmalized banana topping, some liked the peanut butter cheesecake. Few liked it together. Overall, it was quite underwhelming. It wasn't a lot of work, however, so I'd recommend giving it a try but it might be one you make with family or friends before serving to guests.
