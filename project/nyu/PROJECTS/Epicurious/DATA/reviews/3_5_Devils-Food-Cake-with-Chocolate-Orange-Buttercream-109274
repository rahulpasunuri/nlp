I was given this recipe several years ago from my sister-in-law and it is by far the most incredible chocolate cake you will ever eat. Delicious! Have make this many times and a signature favorite that has been passed on to my fellow baker friends.

This review is for the buttercream frosting only; I used it with Devil's Food Cupcakes. This is absolutely the best! I made it with semi-sweet chocolate and Triple Sec; the Triple Sec really brings out the orange flavoring. I used Ghiradelli chocolate

I made this cake for mothers' day and it was wonderful. I thought the orange tinge in the frosting was a little odd though, so I would reduce the orange zest. My family thought it tasted good that way but I didn't like it. Maybe it is just an opinion of mine. I would also leave out the lavender like most of the reviews say. And it also turned out more like a cake instead of a brownie when I added 1/4 teaspoon more of baking soda in the cake. It is a little time consuming so I wouldn't make it if you were running short on time. But it turned out okay. I would definently only add 2 cups of powdered sugar in the frosting. With 4 cups it is way too sweet. Thanks for the reviews!! It turned out to be a pretty good cake!

I made this for a family birthday party and it was a huge hit with children and adults. I found the cake a bit dry but thought that was probably b/c I used square pans so the baking time was longer. I cut powdered sugar back to 3c (but still found it too sweet) and enhanced the orange flavour by making the cocoa mixture using orange juice instead of water.

Too dry.

I made the cake with both the lavender and the orange liqueur, and it was wonderful. I forgot it asked for whole milk and whole yogurt, and I had bought the low fat kinds, but I threw in a couple tablespoons of butter and it all worked out. I also added an extra 1/4 tsp baking powder, and it rose quite nicely and more like a cake than a brownie. It wasn't a very dark chocolate though, more like German chocolate cake than Devil's food. Maybe next time I'll add even more chocolate and cocoa. And use less sugar in the frosting.

This cake turned out quite nicely, despite a few modifications I made. I didn't add the lavender and I made it in a smaller, deeper dish. The recipe said to cook about 30 mins, but mine took closer to an hour. Fortunately, it remained quite moist and extremely dense, which is generally what you want for a devil's food cake. For the frosting, I cut the amount of powdered sugar in half, which really helps bring out the dark chocolate and orange flavour. It was still nice and sweet, but not overly so. It also whips up very nicely, although I did have to heat it up a little after being in the fridge overnight. Using a double-boiler for this worked really well. Overall, a really nice chocolate cake.

This review is for the frosting only. A snap to make, really tasty, great fluffy frosting consistency (I can't even call it a buttercream) and keeps beautifully. I used a lot less sugar and will skip the salt entirely next time.

Made this for my son's birthday. Should have listened to another reviewer that suggested the cake was nothing like the picture, more like a brownie with icing. I would leave out the lavender as well. It added a very "strange" accent, just didn't fit well.

Rating: 3
After reading the reviews, I made this cake with a few tweaks. I used one stick of butter and 1/2 cup vegetable oil (to make it a bit less dense). I also used about a 1/4 cup of white sugar as I ran out of brown sugar. No lavender, either. This cake was really fantastic. It's dense, but it was moist and I had several foodie friends tell me it was terrific! For the icing, you really don't need the orange liquer (tho I still added Triple Sec), as the orange zest works fine. Also, 4 cups of confectioner's sugar is WAY off! I didn't even use quite 3/4 of a cup and it came out AMAZING! I made a two layer cake and had just enough icing...I piled the middle layer pretty hefty with it.

This cake took some time to make, but so worth it! It was a huge hit. I didn't use the lavender.

I'm not rating this recipe because it was good but completely not what I expected. The cake was extremely dense (could have been a brownie) but tasted fine, good even. But I was making this for a birthday cake and two very thin layers just didn't seem right, so ended up making a different cake recipe. Buttercream was great though!

Holy cow is this frosting HEAVENLY! I only made the frosting as I used the "Moist Yellow Cake" recipe for a birthday cake present to myself this weekend. I didn't add the orange to it, but next time I'll try it. It didn't fit with the filling I was using this time. This frosting whips up beautifully soft and fluffy. So light, so easy to spread, so creamy, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I had leftovers after frosting my cake (really should have put a thicker layer on, in hindsight), and just stood in the kitchen with a spoon. I'll be in the gym this afternoon paying for it, but man was it worth it! SOOOOOO GOOOOOD! My chief complaint with buttercreams is that they're usually too "buttery" tasting, but this one wasn't at all. It was creamy without tasting of butter specifically. I cannot say enough good things for this frosting. Talk about simple to make too. Much easier than dealing with syrups and beating egg whites and such that other buttercreams entail. I absolutely recommend this recipe. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Don't be fooled by the picture... the chocolate layers won't be huge and fluffy. But it doesn't matter. Follow the directions exactly (well, I took the cake out of the oven 1 minute early, but that's it) and you will create a beautiful cake with a wonderfully unique taste combination. I can't wait to make this again.

I made this cake for Easter dinner and it was delicious. The lavendar was a great addition and I loved the orange flavor in the frosting. I left out the Grand Marnier since the orange peel gave it enough orange flavor. It was dense and a little dry as others mentioned. I made a few adjustments (reduced baking powder, increased milk and increased oven temp) for high altitude since I live at 7500 feet. I'll have to keep trying different adjustments as this cake has great flavor!

Rating: 4
I am just rating the frosting as I had already made a devils food cake using another recipe and just needed a good frosting recipe. I didn't use the orange zest/Grand Marnier because it didn't fit with the cake I had made, instead I mixed in a tbsp of Kahlua. This had an almost mousse-like consistency and got rave reviews. Will use this again and again.

I was looking for a chocolate buttercream frosting to go with a yellow cake recipe that I had and this one really was easy to make and delicious. My husband who loves the chocolate-orange combination was so excited about licking the bowl of this one. I didn't rate this recipe because I didn't make the cake, just the frosting. I also didn't quite use the full 4 cups and just stopped at about 3 1/2 which was sweet enough for me - the texture was still very good.

Rating: 3
This ended up being fabulous! I wasn't able to grab any lavender, but definitly will next time. Only problem was that the cake and icing got very very hard when I put it in the fridge. I felt that I should keep it cold, due to all of the dairy in the icing, but had to "thaw it out" befor eserving.

Rating: 0
Absolutely to die for! The cake was a little thick and brownie like, and the frosting was smooth and creamy. The flavors went together so nicely and neither the cake nor frosting was too sweet. My guests loved it! The Kosher salt in the frosting was detectable but made it outstanding! This is my new cake "go to" recipe!

As the cook from Los Angeles mentioned, my cakes were flat and like a brownie, too, but still good -- very rich. Everyone loved it! I would make it again, but I would like to figure out a way to make the cakes lighter and taller.

This is an absolutely amazing chocolate cake. It is very moist and the lavender provides a very subtle but unique flavor. The cake retained its moist flavor even after sitting in the refrigerator overnight. I am typically not a cake person, I typically prefer just the icing, but this recipe is an exception. Definitely will be the staple recipe when a chocolate cake is desired.

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever had! It was deliciously lush but not too sweet. I left out the lavender and orange because my husband did not want them. The cake was dense--almost like a brownie, and the icing was good enough to eat by itself. I think I'll be asked to make this again and again!

I got rave reviews for this cake. I was worried that my teenage friends wouldn't appreciate the changes in flavor, but the subtlety was perfect, just enough orange and just enough lavender to make it special but not over-powering

This is the cake that changed my mind about chocolate cakes. I thought they were all dry and flavorless. This is superb. The cake can turn out a tad on the dry side, but the frosting more than makes up for it. The kosher salt is unusual but gives the frosting a delicious flavor. I haven't tried the lavender or orange, but it's still great without them. My family makes this cake for almost every birthday!

PPS....A post consumption review: I retract my previous statement regarding the kosher salt. The kosher salt provided a terrific contrast that my husband noticed and liked. While I found it initially surprising, once I got over my surprise, I understood the effect that the recipe originator was conveying--and I embrace it. The balance of chocolate and orange is wonderful.

Rating: 4
An update--I would NOT use the kosher salt again...It is too coarse. Perhaps just a bit of fine sea salt. This was the PERFECT amount of frosting to fill the cake and frost it.

I did not make the cake but was looking for a no-cook buttercream frosting with no raw egg (the 'other' recipe I was using called for an egg yolk!). This is a beautiful frosting. I did not find it too sweet in the least. I wonder if the 'sickenlingly sweet' remark came from a combination of not very good bittersweet chocolate. I used the last of my Valrhona bittersweet chocolate on this frosting! Buttercream is quite firm--so room temp is important. My favorite chocolate cake, though, is the Cuban Opera Cake (found at this site). It is the single most wonderful cake I've ever had (it is the dessert where people eat and don't talk!). But...it is a two day production. But having said all that, THIS frosting fit the bill for today! I'll split the layers on the cake to use the additional frosting.

I've made this cake (sans lavender, I must confess) probably a dozen times now. It's always moist, rich, but not overwhelmingly so, and a huge hit. I'm not certain what folks who end up with a dry cake are doing, but I've never had it happen. I'm about to make it into cupcakes for my daughter's 3rd birthday. And yes, there is an absurd amount of frosting.

Rating: 3
Lavender provided just a hint of a floral nose, which contrasted nicely with the orange and chocolate. Cake was denser than I expected. I had to use 1 cup extra powdered sugar to thicken the icing enough to hold when spread, but was still very creamy. I added 1/2 cup orange marmalade to icing to spread in between layers. Decorated with dried orange slices from Trader Joes soaked in Grand Marnier and used a gold transer sheet to wrap a beautiful thin layer of Green and Black's Mayan gold dark chocolate around sides.

I made this as cupcakes, and they were heavenly. The lavender is subtle but definitely present, and the frosting is perfect: soft, fluffy, flavorful, rich. Wow!

Mine wasn't dense or dry. Well, it was dense, but in a good way. I doubled the recipe and made 4-9" layers. That allowed me to create a triple layer birthday cake. I only made one recipe worth of frosting. That frosting coated the 3 layers plus the 4th that we devoured in the afternoon before the birthday party. Food-wise, it was definitely the biggest hit of the party.

This is the most delicious cake I've made thus far. I made it last year and forgot to rate it...I'm making it again tonight and am looking forward to sinking my teeth into it tomorrow! There was a quite a bit of left over frosting...but I'd rather have too much and not use it than to not have enough. I've also had requests to make this cake for an upcoming bridal shower. It's a labor of love...takes a bit of time to make, but well worth it!

i just made this cake and i will say that it was good, but the cake lacked a moistness that i was looking for. The frosting on the other hand was excellent. I do suggest putting frosting in refrigerator to thicken it up. Overall very good, especially wtih a scoop of ice cream

I made this cake to bring to a special coffee hour at church, and I received a lot of compliments. I followed the recipe to the letter, including the lavender, which I crushed as finely as possible with a mortar and pestle. I even used the kosher salt for the batter, and I think that may have been a problem. It didn't fit through the sifter, and later, I was convinced I could taste pockets of saltiness in the cake. I was duly warned by a previous reviewer, and used regular salt for the frosting, which was fine. I used all the sugar to thicken the frosting, and it was very sweet, but many people like sweet, including me. I used expensive Maison du Chocolat bittersweet chocolate, which was probably overkill since it is mixed with other flavors anyway, and orange oil instead of zest, so it had a powerful orange taste, which I liked. Yes, it's not a fluffy cake, but it isn't meant to be, and all in all, it is quite delicious and easy to make. I have a whole container of extra frosting in the fridge. Time to make cupcakes!

I made the Fudgy Chocolate b-day cake (on this site) with 1 cup sour cream vs. 1/4 c, and made the Orange Buttercream frosting, and achieved outstanding results and reviews. I am making again tonight by special request. I agree that I had leftover frosting, a first for me.

I made this cake without the lavender, since I was feeding people with extremely conservative palates, and everyone loved it. I have one quibble: why does the frosting recipe specify kosher salt? The coarse grains didn't completely dissolve. I think the low rating is due to keencarlene accidentally printing the same review repeatedly.

Rating: 2
I had high hopes for this recipe based on past reviews. Unfortunately, a slice of this cake has a lot in common with a lead brick...heavy, dense and hard to swallow. The flavor of the frosting is wonderful, but that becomes hard as a rock also. I would recommend letting the cake sit at room temperature longer than two hours, especially if it's been in the refrigerator over night. Serve with lots of milk!

I made this cake in a lamb mold for Easter dinner. It came out well and wasn't too difficult for a non-baker, but I didn't think it was over the top--perhaps in a more traditional cake shape. I used almost all the powdered sugar called for for the frosting. Very rich.

Rating: 4
This is one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever tasted. Everyone said it is highly professional and like those served in the best hotels. I recommend serving it warm which makes it really exceptional. Lavander makes it exraordinary and very unique. Still without lavander it is an excellent chocolate cake. Crucial in the buttercream is the amount of chocolate and butter used. If either is increased it becomes hard or excessively "butter-like" respectively. Also I never use more than one cup of powdered sugar. I really think 4 cups is a printing mistake in this great recipe. FABULOUS !!

I didn't rate because I only made the frosting, but WOW was it good. I used it with the OLD-FASHIONED CHOCOLATE CAKE recipe found elsewhere on this site to rave reviews. NOTE: Before frosting the cake, stick the buttercream in the fridge for a few minutes. It was a little bit loose but much easier to work with after chilling a bit.

I printed off this recipe some time ago and never got around to making it until recently. It's easy and delicious. I didn't have 9 inch cake pans (moved recenlty and can't find a thing!) but I did have my 9 x 13. It worked well. I didn't find that there was too much frosting, maybe about 1/2 cup left over. Not sure that the lavender made any difference in the flavor, but used it anyway.

Rating: 4
Never made either devil's food cake or buttercream frosting before, and these were both relatively easy and came out beautifully. Cake was moist and not too heavy. As mentioned, the recipe provides an insane amount of frosting - can easily be halved. I garnished with candied orange peels, which gave a beautiful contrasting color and are also easy to make.

This cake is dense, rich, smooth, flavorful, wonderful. A little too much cake for our small family, but worth the work and the ingredients. I substituted black pepper for the lavendar, which worked wonderfully with the orange, and halved the icing and still had more than enough. I also used dark chocolate powder, so the cake and frosting were nearly black! I will save the recipe for super-special occasions.

This cake is fantastic! I made it for my sister's wedding and everyone ate it up. I got so many compliments on it. The lavender has a very subtle after taste. It tastes just like it smells and blends very nicely with the chocolate. I used a white chocolate cream cheese frosting with some Grand Marnier instead of the orange buttercream and it turned out wonderful. This cake is now one of my favorites. I will definately make it again.

This cake is one of the best I have tasted! If you follow directions, which are very easy to follow, it comes out perfect. The only thing I changed was: instead of using the liqueur, I used orange extract, which was more convenient. Using 1 1/2 tsp. of orange extract and 1 1/2 tsp. of water was perfect. The frosting turned out like a chocolate orange troffle. Yum! There was plenty of frosting left, without being skimpy on the cake, to frost a whole batch of sugar cookies.

A note on lavander: I found it in the bulk herbs section of my local organic grocery. 2 teaspoons wasn't enough to grind fine in my coffee grinder/erstwhile spice mill - and I wanted it to be subtle, not bite-down-on-blossoms agressive, so I added 1/4 cup of the sugar and blasted it, which resulted in a lovely fine powder.

This is an extraordinary cake by a pastry chef extraordinaire. A critical ingredient is the dried lavender available at upscale food stores. I made this cake for a birthday celebration, and I have been asked to bake it for several more occasions. Directions always must be followed to the letter for best results.

This cake is fantastic! I had a large crowd coming so I ended up increasing the cake recipe by a half for 3 layers instead of 2. Since so many reviews said the recipe made alot of frosting, I only increased the frosting recipe by a quarter. I used sour cream since I had no yoghurt. Everyone thought the cake was absolutely sensational. If you eat it right out of the fridge the frosting consistency is just like a chocolate orange truffle. The cake however, does have a better texture at room temperature, but everyone thought it tasted great either way. Those individuals who had a bad experience with this cake must have taken a seriously wrong turn somewhere with the recipe because it is extremely accurate, easy to follow, and makes one heck of a cake!

I did use the lavender blossoms, but I'm not sure that I liked them. I think next time I would either reduce the amount by half or leave them out entirely. Did anyone else have a problem with baking the layers? After 30 minutes they were done around the edges and still molten in the middle. So I ended up with a cake with hard edges. I also left the butter for the frosting out for too long (it really was at room temp) and it made the frosting way too soft. I had to refrigerate it to use it and even then it was hard to deal with. But, the final result tasted pretty darn good. I think it's worth another try.

Rating: 3
I followed the cake recipe, with the exception of the wet ingredients, using a combo of buttermilk and creme fraiche and ended up with two quite flat layers. The flavor is exceptional, too bad that it went wrong somewhere along the way. It may have to do something with the combo of the cocoa (droste) and the baking powder. I'd normally be more inclined to add some baking soda as well, anyways-- I think I'll try it again in the near future with a different brand of baking powder.

Rating: 4
Firstly, I make only the cake. Omitting the lavender, I add an additional 2 oz of melted chocolate (6 oz total) which I recommend for an extra coco kick if you are planning on frosting it with a vanilla buttercream like I do. I have baked a lot of cakes looking for a recipe like this one. It is the perfect fine crumb, delicately flavored, chocolate cake...ideal for a buttercream or coconut pecan frosting (this recipe makes an insane German Chocolate Cake). Secondly, if you want a great, super fudgy, moist crumb chocolate cake try the recipe for the double chocolate layer cake from the Engine Co in LA...delicious. I bake both of these cakes frequently, very different but both very, very yummy. Email me if you have questions. Happy baking!

Made this cake for dessert for a Canadian mid-winter Saturday Night dinner after skiing and chores! The adult children and assorted dogs,cats & friends really enjoyed--had slow-cooker chili,cornbread, coleslaw then this as the grand finale. Terrific texture of cake and the frosting was to die for--the recipe does make too much icing, but just froze the left-overs. Used sour cream as had no yogurt and did not put in lavendar blossoms as a little too far out for my gang! A definite keeper!

Rating: 3
I'd give the cake 3 forks- it was tasty, but too dense. I substituted lavendar honey for the flowers and couldn't taste it at all. The frosting rocked (definite 4 forks), and makes a ton (I cut the recipe by 1/3, and it was plenty). I used a tad extra orange zest and grand marnier, and I thought it was awesome. It is not too sweet, and don't skimp on the middle layer- it really adds to the cake. I also put a bit of marmalade in between the layers, along w/ a sprinkle of grand marnier.

Rating: 2
I thought the cakes was extremely dense, which was not to my taste. However, the buttercream was light and had just the right amount of orange flavor. If I could rate them separately I'd give the buttercream 4 forks and the cake 2 forks. Also, neither I or any of my guests could taste the lavender in the cake. The chocolate and orange flavors overwhelmed it so I wouldnt bother adding it if I were to make this again.

I made this for my mom's birthday. I told them there was a "secret ingredient" in the cake - one person actually guessed lavender! It is very subtle, but fun to make guests guess. Since then, I made it for a bridal luncheon and a brunch, and it's been a huge hit. I'm not sure if I like the cake or the icing better!

Rating: 2
Definitely on the dry side, but brushing the layers liberally with Frangelico helped. I would have used Grand Marnier, except I ran out. I didn't make the buttercream; it looked unnecessarily complicated. I put chocolate mousse between the layers and on top and just left the sides plain. I decorated the top with marbled chocolate shards. One benefit of a drier cake is that it was easy to tort.

Rating: 4
This was a great cake that wasn't too difficult to make. I would like to find some lavendar blossoms to see if there's any noticable difference in the flavor of the cake. The buttercream recipe is a great one and it would be easy to substitute different extracts for flavor variations.

Rating: 2
I think the cake was very good - the icing was absolutely delicious. However, the cake was more dense than I had imagined and was hoping for a lighter cake. I substituted the orange liquor with orange essence and added in 2 tablespoons of orange zest. Since I added 2 tablespoons of the orange essence, the orange flavor was overpowering the chocolate - so next time I would either remove the essence or add a smaller amount.

I was so dismayed by the review calling this cake "gross" that I felt compelled to respond. I am an experienced baker, and this cake is by far one of the best that I have ever had. The cake is incredibly moist, and the frosting is rich and creamy. The combination of the chocolate, lavendar, and orange flavours is exquisite. There is certainly nothing "gross" about this lovely cake!

I thought this cake was delicious. I used sour cream instead of yoghurt, and omitted both the lavender and the orange zest (I didn't have them on hand,) and the cake still turned out delectably. It was labor-intensive but that was more the result of not having the right tools than my being incompetent, or the recipe being too difficult. Highly recommended!

I thought this cake was gross. I took my time and followed the directions accurately but, in the end, all I was left with was a great big feeling of disappointment.

I've made this cake five times in 3 months. It is the best devil's food cake recipie I've ever found and I've been cooking with chocolate for 15 years! I've made it each time without the lavender, but may try and hunt some down for next time. The frosting is outstanding but does make enough for two whole cakes. I'm on a mission to visit Citizen Cake next trip to San Francisco to see what other recipies she'll part with !

This cake is delicious and well worth the effort. I had infused lavender into other desserts in the past but never actually left the lavender in the recipe. The flavor of the lavender was just the right amount. Not over powering. Do take it out of the refrigerator at least 2 hours prior to eating as this will increase your eating pleasure. I had shared this cake with several people and they all loved it. I will make this again and again.

It's too bad the cook who first reviewed this cake left out the lavender. I thought I might not be able to find it at my local gourmet store, but I did -- and it was all the difference between an ordinarily amazing cake to an extraordinarily amazing cake! The recipe provided ample (perhaps too ample) frosting, but if you're a lover of the decadent, this is for you. In the future, I'm going to try baking it as a bundt and pour an orange grand marnier glaze on it (found in The Chronicle Cookbook's Chocolate Orange Ancho Chile Cake). My hope is that it will lighten up the cake to make it appropriate for a brunch or afternoon snack. Otherwise, bravo! Citizen Cake & Liz Faulker have upheld their reputation!

I made this cake for my monthly bunco club and it was an absolute hit! I have to admit that I was not brave enough to add the lavender but will the next time when it is "just us". The amount of the frosting allowed a very libral amount between the layers and covered the cake beautifully! I think next time I will take it out of the refrigerator about 3 hours before serving rather than two as it was still pretty firm, which was not a bad thing, I just thought it was better as it sat at room temp for awhile. It was a great cake to make and to serve!!
