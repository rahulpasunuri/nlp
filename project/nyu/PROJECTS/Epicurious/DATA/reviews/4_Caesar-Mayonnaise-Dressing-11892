This dressing is amazing! I was so stoked with the result. I didnt add the anchovy paste as didnt have it on hand. The dressing was still really tasty without it. Instead I added capers to the salad and that provided the saltyness that the anchovies would have given ... and is a really good alternative for people that dont like anchovies . This will be a staple dressing in my house from now on. YUM!!!

Great as a veggie dip too! I also tried mixing a little with my regular spaghetti sauce to create a rose sauce. It was a hit!! So versatile!!!

So easy. Fail-proof. I used what I had on hand...lime juice instead of lemon, anchovies instead of the paste. Didn't measure a thing, kinda eye balled it, and it turned out delish and very caesar-y!

Classic, super-easy recipe. A no-brainer.

Followed other reviewers suggestions and used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 greek yogurt. I also used a whole can of anchovies (what am I going to do with the rest?). It came out great. Have used grain mustard when I didn't have dijon and it's also good. Not as good as with the dijon, but still tasty. I see no reason to look for another recipe.

This is a great recipe...but I agree with others....I would use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 greek yogurt. Also, I used canned anchovies (4) rather than anchovie paste and threw everything into the cuissinart. Easy!

Very tasty! Super easy! Only deviation I made was to follow the other reviewers suggestion of the 1/2 mayo, 1/2 plain yogurt. I will probably try it as written next time, just to compare.

I made this without any changes, and think it wonderful, easy, quick and perfect, but will experiment in the future -- since we are lovers of garlic and anchovy, I can't wait to try it with more of these ingredients. A friend of mine (here in the south of France) sent over an entire head of home grown romaine (roots intact) which was my inspiration.

- Used 5 whole anchovies instead of paste - doubled garlic and just pushed through a garlic press - used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup plain yogurt - blended it all in blender really really delicious and the hubby LOVES

Very good. Added about 1 tbsp of anchovy paste. The dressing is very thick so I thinned it with water. Just had it for dinner, with homemade croutons and grilled prawns on romaine hearts. Yummy!

Tastes the way it should, especially with a touch more anchovy paste.

This dressing took me maybe 5 minutes to throw together. I didn't mash the garlic but, instead, used a microplane and added required salt. Following another reviewer's suggestions, I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 plain yoghurt, a bit more anchovy paste (as we likee), a lots of microplaned parmesan. This is nirvana in a bowl. My kids like the store bought version here in Canada (Renees) but this is much better and I pulled a little trick by storing it in the Renees container. THIS IS SOOO WORTH MAKING. You will never go back to bottled.

I've been looking for a creamy caesar dressing recipe and this one is great. I am just starting to experiment with the anchovy and I would say to others, do not be afraid to add a little more than 1 teaspoon, it really gives it the "taste". Easy, does not take 45 minutes, more like 10.

Rating: 4
Oops, forgot to say, I did not add dijon-style mustard, because it tastes awful and I don't allow it in the house. I used my favorite grainy mustard instead, but I'm sure it would be good with inexpensive ballpark mustard, too.

This.Was.Excellent!! I was shocked at how good it was, especially since it was so simple. I did make a batch and a half, so I adjusted the seasonings after tasting, (it was a bit tangy for my tongue) but I wouldn't hesitate to make it again. In fact, I'll be making some tonight, drizzling it over crisp romaine leaves, sprinkled with some homemade garlic croutons and shredded parmesan cheese (semi-traditional, and good for watching TV).

I was making caesar salad for a crowd and knew it would sit on a buffet, so I didn't want to do the traditional raw yolk version. This is a keeper. I cut the mayo in half and substituted in 1/2 cup of greek yogurt in its place. Gave it a nice, tangy flavor and cut out some of the fat. Next time, I'll probably make it with a full cup of greek yogurt. I also add a lot of black pepper.

Great combined with leftover roasted chicken. I tossed in homemade croutons (toasted bread ends). It took no time at all to make. It's perfect for a fast and easy weeknight dinner.

Another WOW!! Just used this dressing to make Caesar Salad Roll-Up sandwiches. Lathered the flatbread with the dressing, layered on large pieces of romaine lettuce (ribs removed), shredded chicken, chopped tomatos, garlic croutons (great crunch), a few more dabs of dressing, and rolled it up. Superfast, very tasty..... I just won't talk to anyone for the rest of the day. (Next time I'd cut the garlic a tad!)

Rating: 4
Wow, so good! It was just about perfect when I followed the recipe exactly but it was too thick to pour so I also thinned it out a little with a few tablespoons of olive oil and water. I wanted so more of a zing so I also added extra garlic, anchovy and lots of black pepper.

this is super easy and delicious! A true keeper! I used a few anchovy filets instead of paste, and added tamarind concentrate since I ran out of wortershire. The key is to keep on tasting until it gets to your liking.

Fantastic recipe! I've always been fearful of making my own caesar dressings because of the raw egg, and have shied away from it - but this recipe uses mayo and so it totally rocks!

Very good and easy - added a little more lemon and a splash of red wine vinegar to balance the mayonnaise and thinned with milk. Bet it gets better as the flavors blend.

This is my first review, but I LOVE caesar dressings and I have to say, this one is the best I have made so far. I used fresh anchovies, doubled the lemon, and thinned it out with olive oil... my whole family loved it!

Great dressing. I didn't have anchovy paste, so probably could have been better. Did add some fresh ground pepper. I liked it thick so did not try to thin it out.

This recipe is terrific. I've been using it for years, and I'm back to send my brother a link to it. I thin it out a bit, too. And really, including grating the cheese, it takes about 10 minutes to make.

I smashed anchovies (4 or so) and added a little olive oil to thin it down. We loved this easy recipe! Very flavorful, easy, and a keeper!

This is really very good. We love this recipe. The best Caesar dressing I've ever tasted, and I've tasted a few. Starting with ready-made mayo saves time and produces consistenly good results. I've used much more complicated recipes that were nowhere near as good as this one. It's a keeper.

I love this recipe! It's my new favorite Caesar dressing. My suggestions: I use a little milk to thin it out a bit (I found it a bit too thick). Also add a teaspoon or so of capers. Yum.

Loved this recipe and have received rave reviews every time I've made it. Added 1/2 minced shallot (really makes it), Tsp red wine vinegar, doubled the lemon juice and added pinch of sugar and freshly ground pepper. Using lower fat (but not non-fat) mayo works nicely as well.

LOVED it! I too don't much like the idea of raw egg in the regular dressing. This is addictive. Great with raw vegies, too. Finger lickin' good!

This is definately one of the best and easiest caesar dressings I have tried. No concerns whatsoever of salmonella from raw eggs. It is rather thick but you can thin it a bit with some milk or water. Tastes great with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to brighten flavors. Yumm ...

Excellent! It eliminates the raw/undercooked egg dilema and, when you think of it, mayonnaise is made from egg yolks. I thinned it a bit with water, about 2 teaspoons and added a few drops of Tabasco.

Great dressing. Wish it wasn't so fattening, but it makes a wonderful salad.

My 8 year old loves Caesar, but cringes at the thought of anchovies. This recipe (which she prepared with a little help) got raves all around. I omitted the anchovies, increased the Worchestersauce, and added a dash of aged balsamic and a little more Parmesan. HUGE success! (We even have a little leftover for a school lunch Caesar)

Delish! Best caesar dressing, w/o the raw egg, I've ever had. Coats the lettuce very well. It has become my standard caesar dressing.

just a thought - and....if you don't like anchovies/paste - try using 1 heaping tbsp. dijon mustard, oil and vinegar, 2 shallots, 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 Cup SOUR CREAM, dash of salt and fresh ground pepper and a dash of sugar and cayenne pepper, plenty of lemon zest and the juice from 2 large lemons - mix well and drizzle over the salad greens. Would love to hear feedback.

WOW!! I really like this Caesar dressing. I didn't have any anchovy paste on hand so I added extra lemon juice instead and it turned out great. In fact I added a whole lemon. I also added pepper. My guests raved about this dressing. The dressing is VERY thick so I think it needs the extra lemon juice or maybe a little water. It sort of weighed down the romaine even though I mixed it very well. I will make it thinner next time. The flavor of this dressing is excellent!

I searched under anchovy paste to find an easy recipe for a caesar dressing for a dinner party. Complete success! Guest raved about it. I used Helmann's Low Fat (2 gram) Mayo, and it worked great - never could tell it was low fat mayo. I am making it again tonight since it was such a hit, and doubling the anchovy paste to give it more zing. Bottom line - a total winner!

Oh no. Informal dinner for a few people, ran out of dressing, and used the last of the oil on the chicken. Ran to the computer, typed "dressing mayonnaise" and got this. No anchovy paste, and found out later I had used lime juice instead of lemon, but worked great. Normally I would give this 2 forks, because it is just a basic "creamy caeser" found in restaraunts, but the extra fork is for its ingenuity.

Easy and delicous! Used as dip for crudites as suggested. KIMBER
