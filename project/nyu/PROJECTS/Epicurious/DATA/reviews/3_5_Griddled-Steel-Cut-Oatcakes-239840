You can easily substitute milk for the heavy cream, in case you don't have it in the house. A favorite with everyone in our house - especially the 3 and 5 year olds. We top ours off with honey.

I followed the directions closely but I did something wrong I guess. The grilled patties would not stay together - perhaps I should have chilled longer (I chilled for 5 hours). I ended up frying it up like scrambled eggs and it tasted so-so. Not bad, but not awesome. BUT, I agree with the previous reviewer - the oatmeal was pretty dang good before the whole refrigeration/frying process. I would make this again and eat it warm and gooey from the pot.

First let me say that I LOVE steel-cut oats (also known as pin-head oats, grouts, etc). This recipe was pretty interesting - very tasty and the kids liked them. Frying the oatcakes added a nice toasty flavor, however, I preferred the little sample I set aside for myself before frying. I did like that the recipe could be made a day in advance and finished just before service.

Tasty recipe, but tends to fall apart on the griddle if you add any extra water, or don't allow it to coll before refrigerating. I serve it in a bowl - very tasty!

Yummy and a nice change from a bowl of oatmeal! Followed recipe to a T and they were delicious. I'll definitely be making these again.

Yum! I adore steel cut oats. And, anything that I can make ahead. I made this for a brunch and had no leftovers. Seemed to be everyone's favorite dish.

Its worth seeking out steel-cut oats. Don't go very far when simmering the oats. I had to stir every 5 minutes, and added a 1/4 cup of water 4 times. The oats really do tend to stick to the bottom of the pot.

Just wanted to let the entire world know that this recipe doesn't work for everyone. Perhaps I added too much water. Major mess here.

Make this now! It is a unique breakfast dish that I knew was a keeper when my 12-year- old son, who HATES oatmeal, had thirds and asked to have it again the next day. His father loved it, too. Change nothing.

Would definitely make this again! Made the night before and refrigerated overnight, perfect for Sunday morning breakfast or for guests.Served with fresh strawberries and a dollop of whipped cream. Even the kids loved it! Also,I didn't have steel cut oats so I used Quaker Old Fashioned Oats.
