Wow. This is amazingly good. I thought it might be bland, but it is not at all. I suggest following the recipe exactly. The balance of flavors is perfect. My family was blown away.

Okay - I normally don't go for recipes that get changed by all the reviewers, but here are some changes that could make this a 4-fork dish: salt dry, seed, and puree the tomatoes in a 1/2 tsp. vinegar and make it the top layer (put in the terrine before the pea mousse). Go heavier on the peas and carrots and jazz up the salt and pepper. If halving the recipe, whip all the cream at once, then separate it into 2 portions when ready to fold into purees - you really want this to be fluffy. DON'T sub the cream - the great thing about this dish is that it is light and rich - a little goes a long way (and a little heavy cream won't kill 'ya!)

My girlfriend is a lesbian Marxist vegan, and she still couldn't keep her fork out of this one! It's labor-intensive, but so is class warfare! It's a keeper.
