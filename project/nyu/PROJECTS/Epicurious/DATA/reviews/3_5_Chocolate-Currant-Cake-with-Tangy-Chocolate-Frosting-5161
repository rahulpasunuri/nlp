I had a whole bunch of currants left over from a cookie recipe and decided to try making this cake. The best thing about this recipe is its simplicity. For a minimal time and equipment investment it's really delicious. I made the cake on a weeknight and it was easier and quicker than most weeknight meal recipes. The burst of fruitiness from the currants really made this cake for me. It adds a subtle flavor, and relieves the rich chocolate flavor and sweetness. Since this is basically a plan sheet cake in presentation, the currants make it feel more like a dessert for grown-ups. My foodie friends loved it. I probably wouldn't make the cake without the currants unless I was making it for children. Crystalized ginger, chopped dried cherries or apricots might make an interesting substitute. Definitely a keeper. This may be my new go-to chocolate cake.

Easy easy easy! Turned out very moist. Left out the currants and doubled up on the choco chips - also used Valrhona cocoa. Everyone raved - said it was the best chocolate cake ever!

This recipe is wonderful! You can put it together in about 10 minutes and add any fruit/nut/flavoring you prefer. I made cupcakes (cook for about 10 - 12 minutes) but didn't bother with the frosting, I agree the cake is great on its own.

This has become a staple in my house. I've made it for birthday parties (with seasonal fruit and whipped cream), and for everyday nibbling. I skip the frosting to cut down on calories, and because the cake is good enough on its own. This cake is really great. It's moist, light, and chocolatey.

I agree that the cake is very moist. I found the frosting more exceptional than the cake; definitely a keeper. I like the flavor of mexican chocolate, so next time would try substituting some cinnamon and espresso powder for the currants.

I'm afraid I can only rate the frosting. Don't get me wrong, I made the whole recipe, but since I forgot to bring it with me when I left for work (dufus), I had my husband bring it to my kid's daycare-(I wasn't due back at work for several days). I, too, had problems with the frosting being grainy, but I added extra yogurt and mixed it with my hand mixer, and that mostly solved the problem. It tasted fantastic. Unfortunately, the daycare teachers and kids killed the cake, so there was none left for me to try. I'll make it again....I'm dying to taste the finished product.

I made this cake for my sister's birthday and everyone was pleased, especially me. An easy recipe and I had all the ingredients on hand-- so important. I did skip the currants, we don't care for them and used real whipped cream and fresh strawberries for a beautiful layered, spring cake. This was delicious-- chocolately, but not too rich and very moist. I feel like I found the best chocolate cake recipe. I will make this many times-- a definte keeper.

Fantastic cake - not too sweet and very light and moist. I left out the chocolate chips but I would think about adding more whisky-currants - YUM

Excellent cake recipe - moist, flavorful, and easy. The frosting is wonderful as well. I made this for a family birthday celebration, and both the children and adults enjoyed it.

This cake is moist, I mean REALLY moist. I did not have the rectangular pan and used a 10 inch round springform instead - that may have changed the baking time a little. I think next time I would do less vegatable oil, though, anyway. I also plan to try it with some dried cherries next time soaked in Grand Marnier. There was more than enough frosting, which was delicious. The cake is attractive enough, but I'm trying to think of some garnishings that would make it look more "special".

The cake was very moist. I used both dried currants & dried cranberries and found I preferred the cranberries. I especially loved the tangy icing! Best of all it was easy to make!

I tried this cake for my birthday one year and was happily surprised at how easy it was. I exchanged dried cranberries for the currants due to a food allergy, and it gave the cake a nice, tart-ish flavor.

This cake is very rich and very chocolate! I suggest a small piece at a time with lots of milk. An excellent and simple cake to make!

The frosting from this recipie is unbelievable. It's not too sweet and the yogurt complements the dark chocolate used. Perfect for those who prefer desserts not too sweet.

I added a couple of these cakes to the dessert-laden menus for 1999's Christmas holidays and received rave reviews. The recipe has been added to my "tried, true, impressive but easy" short list of recipes.
