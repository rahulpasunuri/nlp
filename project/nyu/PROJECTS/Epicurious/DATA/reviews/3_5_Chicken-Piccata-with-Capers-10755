This is a great and easy recipe I made even better with a few changes. I dipped the chicken in beaten egg and then in crushed saltine crackers before cooking to make a delicious crust. As other reviews said I made more sauce then the recipe called for. I also added sautéed mushrooms to the sauce and threw the capers in whole. I have made this multiple times for guests or just for myself and it will remain one of my favorites.

delicious but double or triple the sauce. also good to increase the amount of butter in the sauce. The fact that this is so simple (and takes about 10 min start to finish) makes it a great weeknight dish.

I added garlic powder to the seasoning and dredged in flour. BANGIN! also added some chopped kalamata olives but I don't think it needed it. And definitely put the chicken pieces into the pan with the sauce for a few minutes. The sauce seems "thin" but it's full of flavor so don't feel like you have to thicken it up that much. plus if you dredge in flour it becomes the right consistency.

Good, but not the best Chicken picatta recipe I've come across. Would have preferred more sauce and didnt like how thin the sauce was. Overall it was a hit.

Rating: 3
Very tasty: I agree with others that the sauce needs to be doubled, or tripled, as it is very yummy. I do not think it needs the flour that some recommend; after pounding the chicken well, it browns up very nicely in butter and olive oil, and even without ths sauce tastes great (children say so). I served this with my old standby baked rice from Craig Claiborne's International Cookbook (onion and garlic sauteed in butter, rice, thyme, parsley, a bit of cayenne, and chicken stock), and steamed broccoli. Easy weeknight dinner, but I'd be happy to cook for guests as well.

My husband loved this recipe...and it was the perfect way to use up the extra capers and parsley I had in my refrigerator. I used a whole chicken, cut up, because that was what I had on hand. I sauteed it as the recipe suggested, just for longer. I added extra capers (they get lost in the sauce), added thinly sliced onions after removing the chicken and before adding the wine and lemon juice. It tasted a little too lemony, so I cut it with orange juice. I chopped up cilantro and served it as a separate add-on for myself since my husband doesn't like it. I don't usually like salty dishes, but this is a keeper. Stephanie B.

I LOVE chicken piccata and finally decided to give it a go. It was wonderful! I doubled everything except the chicken to yield a little more sauce. I also love capers, so I just added them until I thought it was enough. Big hit with the family. Quick, easy and very tasty!

Rating: 3
I started with this recipe because of the chicken prep as it needed to be gluten free. That was a huge success. It was also nice that the flavoring was mild. However as others noted, the quantity of sauce is minimal. I doubled the recipe but tripled the sauce and could have used more. Used gluten free stock for the wine.

Rating: 3
A good recipe because it doesn't overwhelm your palette with acidity like other picatta recipes I've come across. However, I like the chicken in my picatta breaded or at least dredged in flour before frying. Also, I fried it in olive oil and butter instead of vegetable oil and butter to build an extra level of flavor early on.

Simply put.. THE STANDARD! The GOLD Standard at that!

I didn't think this recipe was that great. The sauce was very bland and the recipe did not make enough sauce (I would double). It's okay but I like the lamb piccata recipe better on this site substituting chicken.

Rating: 4
Good basic recipe. I added a little more butter and sauteed garlic and shallots after cooking the chicken. I would not recommend pouring out the excess fat after preparing the chicken. Doing so may make the dish healthier, but the sauce is left wanting. Finally, I trippled the amount of capers (I used capote) and wine.

This is a terrific recipe. Buy the chicken already cut and sliced thin. It's delicious and easy.

Very good! I made a breading for this since my chicken was old and had some freezer burn, first dipped it in egg beaten with 1 TB lemon juice, then coated in flour with paprika, salt, and garlic. I also used chicken tenders, unpounded. Also, I used 3 Tb of chopped mixed herbs- basil, mint, oregeno, and chives instead of the parsley, as I was out. Very pleased with the results, obviously a versatile recipe. Should have chopped the capers, but forgot!

Very good - my whole family (5-yo & 7-yo included) loved it! Very quick/simple to make. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and floured and seasoned the chicken breasts, doubled the sauce recipe and simmered the chicken a few extra minutes in the sauce. The chicken was tender and moist. Would serve this on a weeknight or for company - NICE!

Pounding the chicken flat will enable you to cook it quickly and enjoy a tender cutlet, a very different (and IMO better) experience than cooking a full breast. I cut the chicken breasts into pieces, pounded them then tossed them in some flour, salt and pepper before sauteeing. After making double the sauce, I returned the pieces to the pan to coat them all evenly in the sauce. It was delish!

This was a great recipe, but definitely needed to be tweaked a little. Luckily I read the reviews before I got started and did my own variation based on the comments. I made this for a party this weekend and everyone raved over the dish. I floured the chicken before putting it in the pan for cooking. I mixed a little salt and pepper with the flour. In the pan I had put 1Tbs of the capers, 2TBS of wine and a little lemon juice together with the butter and vegetable oil, and then cooked the chicken for 15 minutes on each side. The chicken came out very tender and could be cut with a fork. I also had to triple the sauce and added some artichokes plus sautéed mushrooms. Since this was for a party, I mixed the sauce with the artichokes and mushrooms with bow tie pasta (easier to eat. For a regular dinner I plan to use regular angel hair pasta.

Rating: 3
A delcious quick & easy, but elegant looking, dinner. I made it for a party. I chose not to bread the cutlets as some have. I did double the amount of the sauce, also adding a touch of cream, since I served it over fresh linguine. For it's quickness, simplicity, and taste, it gets my recommendation.

I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and tripled the sauce. I also lightly floured the chicken thinking this would help thicken the sauce. It did not. Also in tripling the sauce, it was way too lemony.

This recipe is a definite do over! With a couple of modifications it was perfect. The sauce definitely needed to be tripled, especially since I served it over angel hair pasta. I coated the cutlets in flour before cooking, added a little lemon zest and a couple of tablespoons of fat free cream to the sauce to thicken it up.

I have never reviewed a recipe before (although I get receipes from this site several times a week)... but my 14 year old insisted that I place a comment saying how wonderful this recipe was. I, too, doubled the sauce and might triple next time... having again for dinner tonight. Yummy, quick and easy... what more could anyone want!

Rating: 3
I did my own little rendition of this recipe... I used a bit of fat free half and half, only 1 tbs. total of butter and only about a tbs. of vegetable oil, simply to cut down on the fat content. I also drenched the chicken in seasoned flour before simmering in the sauce for 30 minutes. Simmering the sauce really helps make the chicken nice and tender. The fat free half and half also thickens the sauce, as does the flour from the chicken. Definitely a do-again!

Simple, elegant and delicious. Made with fresh chicken cutlets that were already trimmed and flattened and dredged them in seasoned flour before sauteing. Doubling the sauce is a must. Served with oven roasted baby potatoes and sauted vegetables (zucchini, yellow summer squash, mushrooms, red bell pepper and shallots in a little olive oil and seasoned salt). Very easy and lovely meal, the chicken was a standout.

Made this recipe with calamari steaks. A local restaurant in Santa Cruz serves this. Seasoned, then lightly floured the calamari before pan sauteing. Most important to not overcook. Served with grilled asparagus. Try it!

Made this last night and liked it but it needs tweeking. First of all there is not enough sauce. I had to triple it. Used the same amount of lemon as I kept tasting it and the lemon was still too much. Next time I'll use 1 tbls and add more if needed. But a good basic recipe for Piccata.

Rating: 3
This is a great mid-week recipe to use those costco half breasts always on call in my freezer. Like others, I double the sauce quantity and I am in the 'flour my chicken' camp. Only significant tweek is I add some chicken demi-glace i have in my fridge to 'doctor-up' basic sauces. Hard to knock this simple classic. It isn't 4-forks but i make it perhaps 3 to 4 times a month. That tells you something

Wow - this was soo easy and tasty. I made it last night for a small get together and was very happy with it turned out (my guests seemed surprised as well - but they've never had my cooking before). Just like the previous reviewers, I doubled the amount of sauce and added some additional garlic and mushrooms. I served it with some thin spaghetti noodles, poured the extra sauce on top and doused it with some olive oil, butter, garlic and parmesean cheese. Served it w/ brocolli as well - very good and easy recipe - will be making it on a frequent basis.

Delicioso and so simple to make! I, too, dredged the chicken medallions in flour (the flour ultimately adds body to the sauce).

I'll be making this again and again.

I have been making this dish for about 5 years now and is a favorite with everyone I serve it to (along with the salmon with mustard dill sauce that I also found through this site).

I, too, followed the advice of some of the reviewers, plus made a few changes of my own. I did, however, try to leave the basic recipe intact. I dredged the chix in flour, then egg, then flour/breadcrumb mix. Shook off as much as I could so it left a nice, light coating. I doubled the sauce, added a little (about 3 tbs) chix broth, and mushrooms. Served over plain white rice with fresh broccolli (sp?) on the side. It was quick, easy, and very delicious. I might actually make even more sauce next time since I'm a sauce fiend. Good home cookin'.

Like most reviewers, I dredged the chicken lightly in flour and doubled the sauce. Also, I added thinly sliced lemons which I then cut in half. I cooked them after the chicken but before adding the wine and lemon juice, and cooked them enough so they almost seemed like preserved lemons (as you can tell, we LOVE lemons!) Served the chicken over match stick potatoes and put the sauce over both. One of my husband's favorite things!

I modified this recipe by cutting chicken into strips and adding more capers. Chicken was frozen boneless/skinless and worked well.

This was fine, not really too special but definitely ok. I did as advised and put in extra wine and lemon and butter, which I'm glad I did - I think the idea of the mushroom, artichoke hearts, etc. is good, and probably would help it a lot.

Very nice balance of flavors IF you don't skimp on ingredients. I like a lot of sauce, so I used a little over a pound of chicken breasts, then 1/2 C white wine, 1/4 C lemon juice, and about 3 rounded T of drained capers. I tried to cut back on the butter -- BIG mistake. After I added the full 4 T of butter (since I was more or less doubling the recipe) and chopped parsley (I only had dried, though), the dish was really lovely!!! Next time, I'll be sure to use fresh parsley, and maybe add artichoke hearts and/or shallots. Also -- I cheated and used cornstarch to thicken it, since I thought the sauce was too runny. Worked fine.

I am a caterer and made this dish for a customer. I had to brown the chicken and then put it in a baking dish with the sauce, covered with foil, and let the customer finish it in the oven. She said it was great. I added some extra wine and covered each breast (I made 20) with thin lemon slices. I made this at home in the past and enjoyed it then too.
