Very delicious! Complimented it with a zany coleslaw. I would recommend to others. The timing on this recipe was perfect and we cooked for two, splitting recipe in half.

Really a great, simple dish. I used boneless smoked pork chops, but it would work well with ham, too. I added quartered potatoes into the oven in the same dish as the chops, and served a simple sauteed collard greens on the side (should have simmered those, though - they were a bit tough - but the slight bitterness of the greens were a great side for the tangy, slight sweetness of the glaze). The glaze was not too sweet, with a bit of a kick to it, and went really well with the chops and over the potatoes.

Interesting recipe. Smoked pork chops are a lot like ham. They are fully cooked and taste very similar to ham rather than a regular pork chop. The tangy glaze complimented the smoke flavor. I'll make this one again becuase it's good and very simple.

Great recipe. I used boneless pork chops, about 3/4" thick, and there was no need to finish cooking them in oven. I just covered with foil while making the onions and cider mixture.

Very tasty sauce. My spouse didn't like the texture of the smoked chops, next time I'll do it with regular bone in or maybe a grilled chicken breast.

I have made this recipe twice now...was great both times, I made with a regular thick cut pork chop,and with a bacon wrapped tenderloin filet...I cook at one of the more popular restaurants in my area, and this is one we'll try a variation of at the restaurant...

Add a little grainy mustart to the sauce...adds a little something extra
