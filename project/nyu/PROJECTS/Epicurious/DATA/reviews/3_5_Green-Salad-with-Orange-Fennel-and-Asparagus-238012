Good, but not great. It was rather bland and I think goat cheese would be helpful.

Delicious! The teenagers loved it!

I bought cold pressed extra virgin olive oil for this recipe and realized it turned the dressing bitter. Unfortunately, I had to toss the first batch. Next time, I will use canola oil for this recipe so it won't conflict with the oranges. I also roasted the asparagus as suggested by another reviewer, but would definitely steam or blanche next time and serve cold. The roasting took the bright flavor away from the asparagus and really didn't go with the fresh oranges.

I made this for Easter and it was good and beautiful. I used the Mache lettuce. Based on other reviews I diluted about 1T brown sugar into some orange juice and added this to the dressing. I halved this recipe for 4 adults.

Very tasty with the Easter dinner, grilled the asparagus, both green and white, and added radishes and cucumber sliced very thin

Dressing was great and with Balsamic vinegar, you can easily cut the olive oil down without damaging the flavors. Used 1T brown sugar, 1 t. orange j. concentrate instead of squeezing the oranges, and used fresh orange slices in the salad. Broiled asparagus instead with some olive oil spray and balsamic vinegar--SO much better than just blanched. Good with addition of feta, chevre or blue cheese and black olives.

Really liked this salad, but I found the dressing needed to be sweetened up a bit. Added a tsp of dark balsamic and a couple of tsps of orange juice. Yummy

I made this for Easter sunday and it was delicous. Making it again tonight and adding grilled chicken for a main course

I've never used fennel in a salad before, but it was perfect in this. I was confused about the oranges. Was I supposed to squeeze or just peel? No leftovers with this one, everyone enjoyed it.

For Easter, try substituting blood oranges.

I've made this recipe several times and each time it's gone in minutes! I marinate the vegetables in the dressing the day ahead, and then just toss with baby greens just before serving...delicious!

I made this for easter--it was perfect, no left-overs. i was worried about the fennel, not quite sure how best to cut it to have the right texture, but it blended in with the other flavors. The oranges were a bit time-consuming, but i liked their freshness as opposed to mandarin oranges-would only do this for easter though. Oh, i added some toasted sesame oil to the dressing and didn't need to add any salt to the dressing. Served it with leg of lamb, scalloped potatoes and spinach souffle.

I made this salad for Easter Dinner. It was good but not spectacular. The asparagus was a winning ingredient but I think it could use more orange zest. I substituted green onions for the chives.

This is an interesting, different salad that's very tasty and very easy to make. I used Boston lettuce and thought it went well with the other ingredients. The dressing is nice, and the orange zest makes it different. You can play with it to make it more mustardy or peppery or orangey as you prefer (though I enjoyed it just as indicated in the recipe). It's a perfect salad for a spring dinner or a brunch. By the way, for inexperienced cooks like me: fennel is often labelled as "anise" in grocery store produce sections.
