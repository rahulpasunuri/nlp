Not a fan...didn't think that any of these components went well together. The beans were the best part, but I've had better bean recipes from Bon Appetit that require the same lengthy cooking time.

TO DIE FOR. I made it with sauteed scallops instead of broiled arctic char but otherwise followed to the letter. Tomatoes sweet. Beans fragrant. Scallops, dusted with dried porcini and fennel pollen, rich and creamy. Nothing's hard in this recipe, but it does take some time (most of it in advance). In my top 5 from now on.

Admittedly, I changed this recipe but it was still delicious! First the changes - used canned beans cooked in the liquids (less 1 c. chicken broth) for about 40 minutes and used a mixed blend of mushrooms since porcinis were not available. Also used salmon instead of char. On an upnote - this was yummy and worth the effort I put into it. The beans were a perfect foil for the fish although I would chop the tomatoes next time and sprinkle over the beans for acidity in every bite probably. It was lovely to have such a rustic fish dish!
