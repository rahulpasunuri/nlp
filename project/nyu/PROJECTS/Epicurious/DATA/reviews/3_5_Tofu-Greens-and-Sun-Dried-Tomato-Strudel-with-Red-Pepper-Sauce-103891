Made this for a kale-themed dinner with friends. It was a big hit! The sauce is exceptional and worth making for pizza. Making this again soon.

I made this for my parents and it was a hit. I used kale as called for, but I did substitute feta for provolone. The sauce is great - I added some red pepper flakes to it to give it a bit more kick.

Made this for the first time last night to use up tofu. I did take the advice of previous reviewers and substituted spinach for kale and basil for dill. I added only 2 tablespoons of basil and next time I would probably double that as the taste didn't come through the sun-dried tomatoes as much as I would have wanted. I did make the accompanying red sauce however I heated up the sauce after processing. A cold sauce didnt seem right to me. Good use of tofu and satisfying with a simple salad.

this was great. I did add walnuts as another reviewer suggested and subbed feta for the provolone. Great hit with my dinner guest. Roasted my own peppers for the sauce instead of the jarred variety. Was nice with a Sav Blanc.

This was a big hit with vegetarians and non-vegetarians at my dinner party. Like a previous reviewer, I substituted spinach for the kale. I don't like dill so I left it out. Next time I'll go with the reviewer's idea who used basil. I think the red pepper sauce is essential to the dish.

YUMMY! My kids liked it too. I used spinach not kale, store had no dill so I used basil, it ended up kinda of pizza-tasting and delish. Had no time to make the red pepper sauce, and we dind't need it.

Thanks to earlier reviewers, I added feta and walnuts to the tofu mixture, with good results. I also added chopped kalamata olives. The red pepper sauce, laced with a bit of Jamaican hot sauce, added just the right note to a delicious vegetarian meal.

This one was very very good, even for non-vegetarian guests, but there was just not enough "wow" for me to give it the full 4 forks. I took the suggestions of several reviewers and used feta cheese instead of the provolone, and I upped the dill by at least double after tasting the filling. I also added a few extra sun dried tomato halves - total of maybe 10 vs 6. My final tweak was to use a bit more phyllo - I did about 9 sheets vs the 6 suggested, and I used butter rather than olive oil spray (personal preference :-) It turned out very tasty, just watch the cook time - if it goes too long, the phyllo will split and your filling will start to ooze out the side. Still tastes good, but doesn't look quite as pretty. Oh yeah - don't forget the red pepper sauce! It was super simple, and gets 4 forks easily!

This was surprisingly easy to prepare and looked good, but the taste wasn't anything extraordinary. I followed the recipe as is and it went over only so-so with non-vegetarian friends (who didn't finish). Might play around with the ingredients but currently, wouldn't make again.

Loved this; as did the two non-vegetarians we had for dinner. Delicious! I added about 1/4c chopped walnuts which was perfect. Served it with the red pepper sauce, which was good, however I feel a little over rated. This is definitely worth making.

Rating: 3
Very nice and easy. I replaced the cheese with feta, the kale with spinach. I will add some walnut next time for a extra crunch. The filling could be used for lasagna as well..

This was an amazing tofu dish! my whole family loved it and it had great flavors. also: a quicker cooking method- you can cut up the strudel before you bake it and cut the cooking time down to 20-25 minutes and it's just as good

It was okay. I thought the filling was a little bland. Great way to eat tofu, but it needs some help:)

We made this last night with friends and it was a big hit. We used canola spray instead of olive oil, and we used dried dill instead of fresh.

I was nervous about using the phyllo dough, it seemed like it would be complicated but wasn't; additionally rolling it up was easy and it looked good on the table, was easy to cut without destroying. I skipped the sauce and it was fine on its own. Guests liked it and seemed somewhat "impressed." Nice.

I've just started cooking w/ tofu and wasn't sure what to do with it, so this recipe was incredible!! I didn't think it was hard to prepare, used pre-shredded italian mix (incl. Prov & Asiago), pre cut Kale (just pulled out any big stems). Took me about 40min of prep but that was partially cuz I kept rechecking the recipe, but now that I know how it goes I think i could have it ready in 20min next time. For the sauce I only had marinated red pepps and still tasted great! I used 12oz tofu & ended up rolling 2 logs and served myself and 2 others. We all thought it was incredible (a little like tofu lasagne) even the one who said she would bring the meat when I told her it would be a tofu dinner!

I am a carnivore. I hate vegetables. Despise tofu. Getting that out of the way, this is one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten!! This will please the fussiest of anti-vegetarians. I did tweak things a bit: used feta instead of provolone and substituted baby bok choy for the kale. I sliced the bok choy in the food processor, then sauteed it with the garlic and onions (actually, I used shallots). I then mixed it with the tofu and feta. The only half-complaint I have is that the phyllo doesn't really move me. I used more sheets than required... and used butter for the final few sheets.. but it was kind of lacklustre and limp. Would love some suggestions on how to improve that (will likely try the puff pastry as someone else suggested).

Probably the best veg. dish I've tried - terrific recipe, all the more so since finding a good way to use tofu without using Asian ingredients can be hard. I found this one pretty labour-intensive, so I will probably try subbing spinach next time as others suggested, since prepping and cooking the kale took forever. I did use tomato/basil flavoured baked tofu instead of water-packed, which was MUCH simpler and added some taste/texture (I left out the sun-dried tomatos for balance). I also used frozen puff pastry instead of phyllo, though next time I would roll it out a bit so it's not so thick. Very versatile - I can see using different veggies, different cheeses, different flavours of tofu...Oh, and I didn't make the sauce because it got too late, but I thought it was delicious on its own!

I have made this dish several times. It is one of the best vegetarian dishes I have had! I sub spinach for kale and leave out the dill. I have experimented with different cheeses as well, last time just used an Italian cheese mix already shredded. Don't forget the sauce, it makes the dish!

Very nice. I served this to guests and while I struggled a bit with the filo (never used it before) it still came out very tasty. The red pepper sauce was also delicious on the roasted root vegetables I served as a side.

This was really good. I am always looking for a way to trick my boyfriend into tofu, and this was it. I made the whole recipe as stated, aside from subbing spinach and puff pastry. I just rolled out the dough, and then spread the filling in the center, rubbing the exterior with some melted butter. I did use cream and melted provelone in the sauce, it was kind of weak with just the vegtable stock. This was not only impressive to look at but the flavors melded so nicely, I am excited to make it again.

I am not a cook--at all. I made this dish for a special occasion and not only was it beautiful, tasty, and a huge hit for the special evening, it was tasty cold the following day.

I made this for my folks while I was visiting them. I was in a hurry, so I used frozen puff pastry instead of the filo. The puff pastry is smaller than the filo, so I just made two. I didn't have any problems with the filling being too runny, but I took a lot of care to press the moisture out of the tofu and the greens.

Excellent dish, low fat without tasting like it and the bonus is a beautiful presentation.

Great recipe, one modification which helps with moisture content and flavor, use flavored baked tofu instead of tofu packed in water.

Amazing dish! Excellent for company. I used feta and spinach based on other reviewers' recommendations. Served it with a chopped salad and steamed asparagus. Definitely make the sauce -- it adds a lot. I doubled the recipe and then it served 6.

Although the flavor was good, we had some complaints about this recipe. The filling was soggy, in spite of pressing and draining the tofu and other ingredients. Also, it could have used more sheets of phyllo to balance the filling. It needs some doctoring.

I followed the recipe as above and it was delicious. We have been vegetarians for 15 years and always looking for interesting mains. My children of 6 and 8 loved the strudel and the Red Pepper Sauce.

We thought this was great; I used spinach in lieu of kale but everything else exactly as stated, including the yummy red pepper sauce. Even the anti-tofu men (who didn't learn til after consuming) loved it. The second time I made this I added 1/4 cup pine nuts to the mixture. This added wonderful crunch and flavor.

I used some of the other advice in the feedback section and the recipe turned out perfect! I used feta with garlic and herb seasonings (instead of the other cheese), dried rosemary (instead of dill) and a little more kale. The only suggestion is to use a little less onion because it seemed like a lot. I think even tofu-phobics would enjoy this recipe.

This has been, for me, the "find" of all time! My family and friends love it. The texture, color and TASTE all combine for a perfect [vegetarian] dish! My compliments to the chef!

Thanks so much to the cook from Marblehead, MA's suggestions - I followed the variations suggested and this turned out wonderful, with rave reviews. The mix of ingredients is very adaptable to modifications according to taste (pick your fav cheese) and a perfect vehicle to show off a great tasting vegetarian entree!

Followed the suggestion of another cook and used spinach instead of kale, feta instead of provolone, and added an egg and lemon juice. It cracked open during baking...still delicious, but next time I will slash the top a couple of times.

This was a big hit. I used frozen spinach and frozen puff pastry (didn't have 5 hours to defrost phyllo) as suggested. We put toasted pine nuts in, too, which were delicious.

This dish was fantastic! My grocery store was out of phyllo sheets, so I used puff pastry sheets instead and it was delicious (don't spray the baking sheet). I cooked the kale and onion in the microwave to save time and hassle. A cuisinart makes this dish a breeze. I'll definitely make this one again!

This recipe is greatly improved by substituting spinach for the kale (to save time, feel free to use frozen spinach prepared according to package instructions). I'd also recommend replacing the provolone cheese with feta, and adding a squeeze of lemon juice and one beaten egg to the tofu mix, all of which produced a nice Mediterranean flavor. Because this recipe is labor-intensive, I also doubled the amounts and made several smaller strudels-they cook more thoroughly this way and make for easier serving. Finally, you can eliminate the red pepper sauce entirely, which makes this a much easier, less time-consuming recipe to prepare. (I found the sauce uninteresting.) My husband and kids adored this. (I didn't tell them there was tofu in it. What they don't know won't hurt them.)I should also tell you that I used real butter and extra virgin olive oil instead of the olive oil spray the recipe recommends. Very tasty. I've got company coming this weekend, and I'm making this for them to impress them. Great recipe--with these variations.

This is a great receipe. When I made it the last time, I substituted spinach for the Kale and it was still great. I even made it without the red pepper sauce, and we still loved it, However, we are vegetarians and used to eating things without sauces! It's also okay to use dried tomatoes not packed in oil. There's enough moisture in the filling that they come out just fine.

I'm a novice when it comes to cooking with tofu but this made me look like an expert. I added a handful of chopped walnuts to the filling and it tasted great. My husband -- highly skeptical of tofu -- enjoyed it too. (Although he did say it should be a "side dish.") Considered it a victory none-the-less!

Rating: 4
This is a great meatless entree. I ate one and individually wrapped the remaining 5 servings in foil and froze them. To heat, I pop a serving in the microwave (foil removed of course.) The strudel remains crispy and tasty and it's a much healthier option than a TV dinner!

Excellent! We had it for New Year's Eve, and it was a big success.

This was a wonderful dish, very tasty. I would recommend making the filling a day in advance to let the flavors blend,and definitely let it sit about 5-10 minutes after removing from the oven. Also, the red pepper sauce is key, so don't leave it out. Great way to add tofu to the diet.
