I made this for a birthday gift for my uncle. It was very quick and simple, but looked a bit like vomit when I poured it out onto the baking sheet. Tastes AMAZING though. Looked a bit more pretty as it cooled. Will for sure make it again.

Very nice! I used rosemary infused sugar and added some cardamon. Turned out beautiful!

Easy and delicious. My sig other who complained that he hates brittle the whole time I was making it couldn't stop eating it once it was done. I guess he just hadn't tried MY Salted Pistachio Brittle yet!

Oh my! This is SO GOOD! Easy to make and just down right decadent! I am going to be making this every year. So glad I saw the recipe in time to make it for Christmas. It should have been in the Christmas issue! I wish I could give it 10 forks!
