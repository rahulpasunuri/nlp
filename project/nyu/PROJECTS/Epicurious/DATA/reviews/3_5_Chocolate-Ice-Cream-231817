This ice cream was fabulous! I served it for my mom's birthday and everyone raved about it. I've made a lot of ice cream over the years and I feel this is one of the smoothest and richest so far. It was a little more work than most custard style ice creams, but worth the extra 5 minutes.

this was my first ice cream recipe, and I choose it after reading that thick custard ice cream is good if you're not using an ice cream maker. I was going to give it a try in the freezer. I used eggs from a local farm, very good chocolate and demerara sugar- the results were stunning. I used a metal loaf pan in the freezer, started stirring every 10 minutes, but found that I only need to look in on it every 30-45 minutes, for a couple of hours till it was frozen. It was dense but still reasonably easy to serve. For me, this is a keeper.

Made this for the 4th of July, wonderfully, rich chocolate ice cream with great flavor but heavy texture. I used 62% cacoa (Nestle chocolate available in store)and as recommended by past reviewers, I cut the egg yolks to 5. After the mixture had cooled to room temperature I also added 1/2 c. scalded milk, 1/2. scalded cream, 1/2 c. milk, 1/2 c. cream (combined together then added to mixture). My Mom and I are both chocoholics and loved it, but it was still very rich and you couldn't eat much at one sitting. I used leftovers for a chocolate milkshake the next day, heavenly! Next time I might substitute half & half for cream or use a lowfat milk rather than whole milk.

I didn't read the reviews of this recipe before I made it and I wish I had. When I checked the base after cooling it overnight, I was shocked to find it as thick as a pot de creme. I didn't think my ice cream maker could get through it so I decided to add equal parts (1/2 C each) of scalded and cooled milk and cream. This thinned it out enough to go through the machine and the scalding mitigated the formation of ice crystals in the final product. I also didn't find the base to be any less chocolate tasting despite the addition. I'm giving it 3 forks because it was the best tasting chocolate ice cream I have made yet. I also think this recipe could be really versatile in making other chocolate deserts.

Simply calling this Chocolate Ice Cream is rather misleading, since it's much closer to gelato or frozen custard. The recipe is rather time-consuming & has more steps than usual, due to the caramel. I also commented to my husband that the custard base was very pudding-y. But once I froze it in the ice-cream maker, it did result in a fabulously rich, creamy, chocolaty treat. One scrumptious scoop is enough!

Ice cream is one of my absolute favorite foods, and I was very excited to try this one. Unfortunately, I have to agree with one of the other reviewers. This is pudding, and a sickening sweet one, not ice cream. But if you like the inside of a Milky Way bar, you'll love this stuff. Frankly, I'd never make it again, nor recommend it.

About 20 minutes into the cooling time I realized what I had made--pudding. This was confirmed when one of my guests couldn't finish it because it was soooo rich. The "ice cream" still held its form a good half-hour after she had set it aside. But dang it's good. Like my wife said, if you don't like truffles, you won't like this.

I thought this had a very nice flavor, but I only ate a few teaspoons. My husband and my 9 year old sugar junkie declared this to be "too rich". I think this might make a very nice filling for a small profiterole or eclair, but I guess that eaten from a bowl the flavor is too much.

absolutely the best chocolate ice cream I've ever had. Only for those who are extremely into chocolate. My husband said it was too much for him. Not for me!! Loved it!

Definitely more like frozen custard, but so good! I used 8 oz of Ghiradelli Semi-Sweet Baking Chocolate, and half-and-half instead of whole milk. I used the wire whip attachement on my mixer to whip the yolks and add the milk/caramel mixture, so everything ended up very airy. I let it chill for an hour instead of 35 minutes, before putting it in the ice cream maker, which I'd had in the freezer overnight. The result is an exteremely rich, decadent, velvety smooth frozen custard. I will make again, and experiment with add ins and different chocolates.

I agree with the other reviewers. While this a decadent chocolate dessert with incredible flavor, the texture is definitely not one of ice cream. I'm not sure why the custard comes out that way. Perhaps it's the caramel, or the fact that the eggs are so whipped. If anyone can shed a little light, it would be appreciated.

I agree about the texture and mouthfeel of the previous reviewers. However, what is wrong with chocolate velvet? My husband and I loved this ice cream, and I'll be making it again this week - right after I stock up on great chocolate. Bless you, Ruth!

This should not be called ice cream. It doesn't come close to resembling the texture of ice cream. It's like a rich, smooth, cold fudge. I even tried cutting down the eggs to 4 in one batch and while better, it still wasn't the right texture. There are also too many steps and the time spent is not worth the outcome.

it's like eating frozen chocolate mousse, not really ice cream

WOW! I just made this in my new Kitchen Aid ice cream maker attachment and it's amazing stuff. I agree that it is super rich and decadent but what's wrong with that? It's like velvet in your mouth...just like Ruth said. Mine did not incorporate very much air either so it yielded only about 5 cups. It's a lot of work so I suggest doubling the recipe. It is like gold in my freezer!

This recipe produces a dense, rich, and decadent dessert that I'd call frozen fudge, or a concentrated pot de creme -- but not ice cream. The flavor is more a combination of cooked caramel and chocolate, rather than being pure chocolate. The cooked custard base has the consistency of a thick pudding even before it cools to room temperature -- so thick, in fact, that my ice cream maker could not incorporate almost any air into the mix. One scoop goes a long way, so be judicious when serving.
