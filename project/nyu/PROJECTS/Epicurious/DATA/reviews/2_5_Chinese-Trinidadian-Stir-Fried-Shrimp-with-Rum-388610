This dish was quick, easy, and paired perfectly with my leftover coconut rice. I removed the shells but left the tails on and it worked fine. My one complaint was the cooked tomato tasted grainy, but February is not exactly the season for tomatoes. Next time I'll try grape tomatoes. Definitely a keeper for a quick week-night meal!

I wasn't crazy about this dish, it was a bit too spicy (garlic & ginger?) and the shrimp cooked in the shell, made it a messy eating experience!

Can you use chicken instead of shrimp? If so do you recommend any changes?

This is very similar to a dish I grew up eating, and now cook myself. My Chinese Trinidadian family makes shrimp and pepper stir fry with sherry/light soy sauce/hoisin, rather than rum and ketchup. Also, we'd use shado beni (also called culantro or "spiny cilantro") instead of cilantro. This herb is also used in Vietnamese cooking; here in my current city of Austin, Texas, I find it mostly in international or Asian groceries.

This was ok, but a pain with the shells on, Flavor was pretty good
