Great recipe! I made this several times over the holidays. Very impressive looking for the level of effort. (And it's not that hard to make the mushrooms to decorate the top. Load of compliments from my guests on this1

I made this last night and it was absolutely delicious! I used part minced shallot with my onion. My dinner guests raved about it. In the past I've made brie with preserves, nuts, etc and thought I'd try savory this time. Good choice this was.

This was a bit expensive as I'm a starving college student, but I usually spend most of my money on food anyway and we had to impress for our friends' "fancy" cocktail party. Brie in pastry by itself is yummy, but this was on a "whole 'nother level." It was delicious; there were no leftovers and everyone appreciated the little mushroom design I made on top. :)

I did this with shallots and added fresh thyme. I didn't have time to do the pastry so just ended up putting in the mushrooms on top of the cheese and shoving in the oven to warm. I really don't think you need the pastry! But fresh herbs are a must.

Good, but not awesome enough. Should have been shallots, should have included herbs, should have been more melty and amazing. Sauce also leaked out of the package and was kind of messy. It all got eaten, but not fast enough, and only after other stuff was gone. I'll be looking for a better recipie.

This is an awesome recipe, and one that should be made exactly as stated in the recipe. Do not make any changes and you will love the results! It can be made in advance, except for baking,and again, bake according to the recipe. One of my favorites to come along in years.

Made this the first time years ago for a dinner party and people raved! I've made it numerous times since, usually as a special request from those same people. Easy but looks like you slaved for hours. Love it!

This simple recipe makes for a beautiful presentation - I did it for a Christmas party with holly leaves on top - it looked just beautiful, and the taste lived up to my expectations, too!

So easy and elegant- everyone loves it. I made this for Christmas and cut out a Christmas tree and star for the top (instead of the mushroom). Beautiful and yummy!

This was so yummy. I didn't get fancy with the pastry dough at all, really literally threw it together, and it came out beautiful and perfect and most importantly, incredibly delicious!

This was very easy to make. Next time, I will use the port and zinfadel mushroom recipe on this website. Great dish!

I personally do not eat mushrooms, but this was gone within minutes. I omitted the nutmeg, added garlic and made these into phyllo triangles instead. They were a definite hit.

Rating: 2
A bit dull and very heavy/greasy! Maybe when using more mushrooms, less cheese and a cheese with stronger flavour, then it could work.

Rating: 4
I too made this with the phyllo dough since it was what I had in the freezer. I turned out great, I cut the top and sides of the brie then topped it with the mushroom mixture and wrapped it with the phyllo, it tasted sooo good. I had made the apriot chutney one before, but this one is definately a keeper and I will make this again tonight, this time I will try it with the puff pastry

Rating: 4
excellent recipe. i actually picked up phyllo by mistake at the store and used 8 sheets (buttered between each layer) and 4 sheets for top and had no problems with leaking. i cut away any overlapping waste to prevent bulking. it was perfectly brown and flakey and possibly better than a puff pastry would've been. i was in a big hurry and put the finished (uncooked) brie in the freezer for 15 minutes then baked. EXCELLENT!

I love this recipe. Always my first choice to take to parties. But, I have just one question: If you are using the 'back' of the knife to score the pastry, why does the knife have to be sharp?

Rating: 3
Oh, so delicious! I was concerned the nutmeg would be a little powerful, so I reduced it a bit and didn't notice it at all. I would use the amount called for in the future. In my opinion, the thinner the puff-pastry, the better.

I did not tamper with the ingredients of this delicious recipe, but I made a few "stylistic" changes. I used two 8-ounce wheels of brie, so used extra puff pastry accordingly. I did not cut away the pastry on the top to leave a one-inch border around the top edge. I thought that doing so would leave a slight depression on top after the top pastry round was added, and I thought a more "rounded" effect on the top would be more attractive. So instead, I brought the pastry up around the sides and gathered it in pleats toward the middle on top, cutting away only what was left after the top was completely covered and the pleats were touching in the middle. This created the rounded top I was after, and it looked great. Also, I used a cookie cutter to cut a leaf shape to decorate the top, scoring "veins" in the leaf with a knife. (You could use a seasonal cookie cutter to correspond to the time of year you are serving this hors d' oeuvre.) I brushed the entire top with the egg wash before adding the pastry round to ensure that it would adhere. Finally, I brushed the entire puff pastry crust (top, leaf decoration and sides) with the egg wash, and it emerged from the oven with a beautiful golden brown sheen. My dinner group devoured both bries right down to the plate, I was asked to provide the recipe, and it was a great success! A scrumptious recipe that looks spectacular -- who could ask for more?!

I prepared this the day before (except for baking), including wrapping the brie in the pastry, it was fantastic. Because I was doubling the recipe, using two brie wheels, the moisture from the mushroom-onion mixture was not evaporating completely, I simply put the mixture in a strainer. This hors d'oeuvres was the most popular at an 80th birthday bash!

Rating: 3
Really good and easy. I like it as an appetizer for a party because it doesn't require individual assembly for each piece as most appetizers seem to require. I got lots of rave reviews--it looks like it took a lot more effort than it did.

I have to agree with all the other reviews... this is a great AND easy appetiser. Every woman at the party asked for the recipe.

This time I used two small 8 oz. Brie wheels and made 2 separate croutes. Again this time it was delicious! Everyone liked it.

This is awesome!!! I have taken it to three different parties and always need to give out the recipe. I can't get a brie wheel large enough where I live, so I buy 2 small ones and roll them out to the right size and put the mushroom mix between.

After tasting this recipe after my sister made it for her book club, I knew I had to make it for New Years Eve! It was a HUGE hit. Even had to give out the recipe several times! Was very easy and fast to make. I decorated the top with very small circle cut outs to form a grape cluster with vines and leaves. Brushed with milk and beaten egg for a golden crust. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe was a New Years Eve hit with my guests. This is the most delicious baked brie ever, and very elegant wrapped in the puff pastry. A very simple recipe that anyone can pull off. Can't wait to try it again!

I have made variations of brie en croute with apricot jam and almonds. My big question is, tho..can this be made,frozen and pulled out for guests? Do you bake it from the frozen state or defrost it and then bake. HELP!

I made this last night for a party and got many compliments. 425 was a little high for my oven. I baked it at 375 and it was perfect. I couldn't find fresh nutmeg so I used the stuff from the my spice rack, just a little less. Looked like I slaved and it was one of the easiest recipes I have ever done.

This dish is absolutely delicious! It's very easy to make and can be done in advance. I rolled out 2 blocks of puff pastry together and wrapped it around the brie rather than fussing with it as stated in the recipe. My guests all loved it!

I have made this 3 times, and it gets rave reviews every time. I use portabellos, I think they're more flavorful. 1 out of 3 trys broke through the pastry, I think the key might be to roll out the dough well. This is such a winner for a large group.

We made this for our wedding, it disappeared quickly and everyone wanted the recipe! We used 6 phyllo sheets instead of the puff pastry, brushing butter between each layer. We also made it a week ahead of time, froze it, then popped it in the oven. Turned out great!

I made this for New Years Eve & it was a hit. I used a 2lb. wheel purchased at Costco, for 12 adults it was perfect. I used shallots and green scallions in place of onions, & the mushrooms were a combo of shitake and portabella. To assemble the bottom shell I had used leftover pieces, from the top cut, due to it being an inch shy coming up over the brie I added the pieces with egg wash. I must say it looked fabulous when it came out of the oven. I will certainly make this again. I added a veg crudite along with bread and crackers.

Ok , in my house this is know as yhe exploding mushroom app. so understadably i am less than trilled. the seam broke open and exploded in my oven, and smoked up my entire house filled with guests. however i will say perhaps it was user error in the assembly? everyone said it tasted wonderful, even though it didn't look good..maybe i'll give it another shot?

We made this for a cocktail party. It was a HUGE hit - it evaporated. The pastry seal broke open while cooking, but when served you couldn't tell. I will definately make this again.

So yummy and SO EASY. Looks more impressive/harder to make than it really is. I made the brie a day ahead, so it was so easy/quick to just bake before the company came. I halved the recipe and used a smaller wheel. I will make this again - next weekend!!

I made a couple of slight variations to the recipe as I am not fond of the nutmeg/sherry, instead I added white wine/basil/garlic and the addition of a can of crab meat. I made this for our New Years Eve party and got RAVE reviews even from the men, most of which didn't even know what Brie was!

Rating: 4
This was a fabulous and simple dish. I used shitake, some portabella, and white mushrooms which gave it a little added flavor. Make sure to let dish sit when you take it out of the oven. Looks beautiful when done, but a bit messy to serve. This is a keeper. A GREAT appetizer that I will surely make again and again!

This has a spectacular presentation and it was so good, I couldn't stop eating it. I served it with strips of pita bread. Make sure the dish you bake it in doesn't have high sides or you'll have trouble transferring it to a platter (I used a cookie sheet).

I set this on the cocktail table at a recent dinner party and everyone said "oooohhhh". When they tasted it, they were even more excited. It is impressive but actually quite easy to make, especially since you can make it ahead. I have one sitting in my freezer ready for my next unexpected guests -- they'll be so impressed!

Rating: 4
This was easy to do and my guests raved, but I served it on a silver platter that was just an inch or so larger than the finished brie. The platter was too small and the hot cheese ran over onto the table. After the mess started, I was able to transfer it to a larger platter with a lip and it was the hit of the party. The ease of making it the day before was wonderful. Will definitely do it again.

This was a favorite at our hors d'oevres party. I'll make it again without question. (I used portobello mushrooms and liked the clear mushroom flavor they gave.)

This is fabulous! I made this for a romantic harvest moon celebration dinner with my boyfriend. We dined under the stars while the moon was rising, and were just thrilled with this appetizer. We used portabella mushrooms accented with the sherry for a spectacular effect. Our only mistake was not making enough of it. But, we're making it today for Christmas Eve which is why I'm here!
