Not sure why the eclairs tasted too eggy despite using medium (rather than large) eggs...could it be whisking by hand rather than using an electric mixer?

Made these for a casual dinner party. Absolutely fabulous--and looked gorgeous too. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious! But each of the eight eclairs were rather small...

For the sauce: just delicious!! (it was the only part of the recipe I used) simple, easy and quite wonderful...especially with vanilla ice cream and the fresh ginger cake also foundon this website.

I absolutely LOVED this dessert and so did my family. The bitterness of the bourbon in the caramel was perfect with the peaches. Definitely use a 3/4 inch tip, as the recipe recommends.

Excellent recipe, got rave reviews at my dinner club. One thing, do NOT use a 1/4 inch tip for your pastry bag. Either use a one inch tip, or cut a one inch wide corner off of a freezer bag. With the 1/4 inch tip, you get (guess what?!?) a 1/4 inch wide tube of dough! So, your one inch strips are made up of3-4 small tubes and the whole thing doesn't "puff" quite like in the picture. You need a single one inch strip of dough for this to work right asthetically.

Great recipe - easy to follow - we baked without the bourbon and it was delicious! A big hit with the family...
