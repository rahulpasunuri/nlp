I too skip the salmon butter. I also skip the saltines, add chopped garlic,a little shot of hot sauce and just use half and half. It's delicious and my family loves it.

This is my families favorite soup. I make it for the holidays as a starter...every year! I love it!

I have never had one person not like this soup. Our family travels a lot so we need to travel with non-perishable food items frequently. I use four cans of whole baby clams total, instead of the fish. Which basically makes this clam chowder, but it is the best.

I thought this was a little bland, but I served it to some other people who liked it. One plus is that it's surprisingly easy to make, so I think it would be a good weeknight meal.

Delicious! I made 2/3 of the recipe for the two of us. Had plenty of leftovers. What a gourmet meal! Used bacon instead of salt pork. Used salmon instead of cod. Added a pount of fresh mussels. And used all half and half (instead of some cream). Sprinkled dill and the bacon bits from the beginning, right before serving (did not use smoked salmon butter). Amazing dish. My significant other rated it 9.9/10! Enjoy!

Absolutely fabulous. I used 1 1/2 cups Alaskan King Crab and about 2 lbs shrimp. (I skipped the salmon butter.) To save time, I used canned new potatoes. Everyone loved it!!!

Very yummy - used bacon instead of salt pork, and fresh instead of dried thyme. Served with crumbled bacon on top & crusty italian bread with butter. Didn't make the salmon butter becauseI didn't have the time, and it is excellent as a double seafood chowder! Makes a good amount so it can serve a couple or small family for a few meals.

My wife hates salmon, and other fish, but loves clams - go figure. I make this with 20 oz of CHOPPED clams, and substitute 2-3 large cans of whole belly clams for the cod. I skip the salmon butter (it's completely unnecessary in my opinion). Ends up being the best clam chowder arround!

This is a great seafood chowder recipe. I do it exactly like the recipe states, however this year, I am going to increase the liquids and seasonings and add some shrimp and blue crab meat.

I also added scallops and salmon, yummy! I too used bacon instead of salt pork and let it simmer for a while so it would thicken up. It was excellent.

Wow. This is really good! I substituted whole milk for 1/2 and 1/2, but still used the whipping cream and the consistency was great. I used bacon because I couldn't find salt pork. (Then I put the bacon bits on top in the bowls!) I halved the recipe since there are only two of us. So, I just used 1 cup bottled clam juice which means you only have to buy one 8 oz. bottle. I highly recommend-yummy!

Always being health conscious, I had to lighten this recipe. I omitted the pork, used all fat-free half and half, and Brummel & Brown for the salmon butter. This chowder was absolutely fantastic. It reminded me of a seafood chowder from a favorite little New England restaurant. I had to use flounder, as cod or haddock wasn't available, and it was still great. I think you could substitute any seafood. Next time, I'm going to omit the dill in the chowder. I thought it was a bit overpowering.

This is one of the best things I ever made in my life. I subbed small scallops for the clams, and used thickly sliced peppered bacon instead of the salt pork, then sprinkled some of the bacon on top when serving. Also added some "Tony's" cajun seasoning. Did everything else pretty much according to recipe, along with the salmon butter, which was a wonderful addition. Well worth the time and effort.

Fantastic. I used smoked veal bacon instead of pork & left it in. I also used grouper instead ofthe $50/kg haddock or cod, and added scallops & shelled mussels instead of clams. Very very nice. One comment, the liquid seemed to be on the low side, so I would add another 1 cup of clam juice.

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. It does need a bit more seasoning - I used Emeril's, but cayenne pepper to taste would probably be alright. My husband had caught striped bass so I used that in place of the suggested fish. Also, the smoked salmon butter is nice but a luxury that you can skip without altering the taste of the soup too much.

This was great! I love any kind of seafood chowder, but the dill/salmon combination was incredible. I served it with tabasco and sour cream.

The best!!! I was looking for a seafood chowder with a little more variety of seafood, so... I made a few adjustments. Served it Christmas Eve. Even the guys who like "hearty" meals were satisfied with seconds (thirds for some) with a slice of french bread. I added a couple bay leaves in the initial cooking and a little summer savory and more celery. Didn't need the crackers for thickening, just smashed some of the potatoes on the side of the pot until it was the texture I was looking for. Then added some fish (cod and haddock), followed by fresh sea scallops and fresh prawns, and topped it off with some crab. Used whole milk and half and half, no cream. It was still rich enough for us. Didn't bother with the Smoked Salmon Butter. I ended up making it again for Christmas Day with the same results....rave reviews and no left overs. I'll be making this dish all winter!!

Really great on cool evenings with fruit and crusty bread. I added butter, black pepper, and provided tobasco at the table. I used shrimp instead of cod. Can't wait to serve this to friends.

We have made this recipe several times and it has become the chowder asked for by family members. We have not used the salmon butter and it is still fantastic.

This was delicious. Being a semi-vegetarian, I left out the pork, and also switched the half and half to 2% milk. You can't go wrong with this one, it was terrific!

Rich and filling, served with slightly fruity,chilled white wine. Subsituted pepper bacon for pork and used 1/2 salmon. Also, used condensed whole canned milk instead of whippping cream. This recipe will go in the keeeper file.

Excellent chowder but the prep time was long -- a lot of chopping. Plan ahead. ..amd

Excellent for a cold winter evening, comfort food-like. Be sure not to overcook fish. I have made this about 5 times, and each time it is received with acclaims !!!!!
