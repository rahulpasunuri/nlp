I've made this recipe four or five times and it's very good. Like a fruit cake, but more bread like, and the sweetness is nicely balanced by the tea flavoring.

I was looking for a way to use some dried fruit I had, so I made this. It turned out quite dry and rather heavy. Though the flavor was nice. I had it with tea. I wouldn't make this again.
