I used a premade pie crust, and it still turned out so great that my mom asked me to make a second pie! A great hybrid of two classics.

The pumpkin portion was too soggy and the pecan topping didn't do much for the flavor. The crust was OK but could use a little more sugar.

This was merely OK-Next time I will make either pumpkin pie or pecan pie-I don't think the two combine well.

This was good but not great. Sugar did carmelize and it took awhile for it to melt down again. I'll keep searching for another recipe.

Quite a bit of effort went into the making with very, very disappointing results. With no mistakes in preparation, I'm baffled why anyone would bother making this pie twice.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and I'm making it again. It was awesome - I added a little more rum than it called for and everyone LOVED it. I got a lot of comments that it tasted like something "from the islands" i.e. the caribbean!

Delicious and impressive. A perfect blend of the boring pumpkin pie and the too rich pecan pie. Sugar did crystalize after poring the corn syrup in-not to worry just let it melt for a while and use the remaining liquid. Remember to arrange the pecan halves on top of the pumpkin filling. It's worth the time and effort.

Delicious and easy. My family loved it. I omitted the Rum and it was still great. I will make it again and soon!

I think this recipe is a bit over-rated. It was good, but involved way too much effort given the outcome.

Perfect pie for Christmas or (AND?) Thanksgiving. COmbines my two favourite pie, PLUS it has rum in it! Everyone (even my super picky little bro) had big pieces. Served with nutmeg-spiced whip cream.

The first time I made this pie, I also made my first, second, third and fourth tries at caramelizing sugar. It kept crystallizing as soon as I added the corn syrup. Maybe nobody else had this problem. Anyway, my version of the pie tasted great, and the crust was even better.

Very tasty and good looking. I forgot the rum but the taste was delicious anyway. A 'to do again'.

I usually despise pumpkin pie, but this was wonderful! I didn't have corn syrup or pecans, so I substituted and honey and walnuts. The result was a heavier mixture, but when drizzled over the pie it cut into the pumpkin with dazzling swirling formation. Lovely to look at and lovely to eat! An excellent compliment was caramel ice cream.

This pie was excellent...can taste the rum in it!!! The pie crust was soooo flaky. My husband asked me to make another one the very next day!!!

We've enjoyed this wonderful pie since first discovering it in the 1991 Gourmet. Simply elegant!

This pie will most certainly make more appearances on our dessert plate!! I brought this pie for a retirement party, and although it was placed on the very end of the dessert table, it was the first dish to be emptied. I received many compliments for this pie with accompanying recipe requests. Take the time to arrange the pecans on the pie, it really adds to the final presentation!!
