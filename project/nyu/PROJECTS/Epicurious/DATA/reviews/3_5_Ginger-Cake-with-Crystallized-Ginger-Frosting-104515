Very good cake. I too decreaased the amount of molasses to about 3/4 cup to avoid sinking in the middle, which seemed to do the trick. I also may have over baked mine, as I had to bake the layers one at a time and they only took about 28 minutes each...but the result was still a moist yet airy cake. I added some vanilla to the batter, and wished I had added some to the whipped cream as well, just for a little more depth of flavor. Overall a solid recipe!

Amazing cake! I read the reviews first and altered the recipe a bit to make sure the cake had no trouble rising. I cut the molasses to 3/4 cup and baked it at 350 degrees. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of coffee. Everyone agreed that it turned out great!

Have made this twice and everyone loved it! Used Guinness for the stout and used diced crystallized ginger for the decoration on top. Both cakes, however, sunk in the middle. I baked the cakes in my convection oven at 325° for 40 minutes. A trouble shooting guide says cakes sink if the temperature is too hot. Gosh - guess I've have to make another cake and test that theory. Anyone have another idea on this problem? Doesn't effect flavor or guests' happy enjoyment. Love this cake! Different & delicious and keeps really well - if there's ever any leftover.

The taste of the ginger cake is delicious. It is a richer and heavier cake than most ginger recipes I've tried. Mine, due to user errors and not the reicpe, didn't turn out pretty looking, the frosting wasn't beat well enough and the cakes stook to the pans despite being well greased and floured, but I will be making this recipe again.

Very good. It tasted better than expected. Took it to a camp out and many loved it. It was quite tasty.

I love gingerbread so I tried this recipe. I've made lots of cakes from scratch but this one was really heavy. It wasn't bad tasting but I've had much better gingerbread so I wouldn't bother with it again.

Fabulous! This cake received rave reviews at a little music and dessert soiree we had. The frosting is absolutely perfect with the cake. Even without the decorative sliced orange and cranberries on top the cake was beautiful and delicious. Most of our guests asked for a slice to take home.

I like the gingerbread flavor but the cake came out heavy. It seems to have too much leavening (baking soda).

This cake was wonderful! Having never made a home made cake before, I entrusted my husband to bake it, and it came out wonderfully! Took the leftovers to the office, and it was a smash! Highly recommeded for anyone who would like to try their hand at from scratch cakes!

I decided to try this cake on a whim, having no whipping cream for the frosting, left it plain & served it with the Lemon Ice Cream from this site. Wonderful texture and flavor, I will definately make it again with the frosting. BTW, I cut the recipe in half and it worked perfectly.

This cake tastes great...however, I've made it three times now and each time it goes flat in the center. Can anyone tell me what I may be doing wrong? Normally I would just give up on the recipe, however, the taste is fabulous!

Man I wish I could rate this 5 forks. Had it for Christmas and it was just incredible. Our guests also loved it.

I made this for both Thanksgiving and for Christmas dinner. I got nothing but rave reviews on this delicious and easy to make cake. Everyone wanted seconds and the recipe! It makes a nice break from the traditional pumpkin pie!
