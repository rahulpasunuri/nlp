A keeper! I have another excellent lemon shortbread recipe that I've been making for years, but was intrigued by this one because of the poppyseeds. Based on past experience, I used more zest than called for in the recipe and the bars turned out great; they were a big hit at a party. Cutting while warm worked beautifully. Also, if you line the pan w/ parchment, you can use the edge of the paper to gently pull the bars up out of the pan when you're ready to remove them. This will allow you to take out the 1st 1 or 2 bars easily, avoiding messy corners.

Just Okay. I had enough after just one. For anyone who would make this I suggest you sprinkling with powdered sugar while still warm.

I doubled recipe and baked in 9x 13 pan. I might have over mixed as dough was soft and sticky so I used waxed paper to smooth it evenly right to edges and corners. Baked for the 30 minutes. I thought it was a delicious shortbread, right amount of lemon flavor, and wonderful POP from the poppyseeds. definitely cut while still warm. I will add to my christmas cookie collection, made this time for a "Southwest" potluck

I baked these for the extra 10 minutes, which they seemed to need. However, they ended up too crumbly & broke into pieces when I cut them. Good flavour, though. I substituted candied ginger for the poppy seeds.

This recipe has received rave reviews from co-workers and family alike. I did not need to bake them over the alotted time. I think that the person who said they were not lemony enough may have skimped on the lemon zest/peel. You've got to grate for only the yellow portion of the skin for a long time to get the necessary quantity. I also found that they cut without crumbling if done while they were warm.

Delicious! I substituted lemon juice (1 tbsp) for the zest which I think was a mistake - the extra bit of liquid I think reduced the crispiness a bit (even with the extra 10 minutes of baking time), so I will make sure to use zest next time, but even still these were great pick-me-up to regular shortbread. Palo Alto, these shouldn't be compared to lemon bars - totally different - these are shortbread. And besides, they are just so easy to make that they can't be beat.

I hate to rain on the parade, but these were a disappointment in our house. We love lemon and poppyseed but neither flavor sang out; the poppyseeds did add a nice crunch. Regular lemon bars are much better.

I might just make another panful right now. These are out-of-this-world wonderful! I did cook them an extra 12 minutes.

These bars have a great flavor. I did have to bake them for an additional 10-15 min. too.

Excellent shortbread. It is not solid as a rock, but rather firm and moist. The flavor is wonderful and the texture is perfect. My husband and I could not keep our hands off of them! Definitely a keeper. Very simple to prepare and the cut and cool in a jiffy. No hassle for great flavor!

Maybe my oven temperature is off, but I found that 30-35 minutes was not enough for these cookies. After they cooled, I put them back in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes, and they were much better in texture and flavor.
