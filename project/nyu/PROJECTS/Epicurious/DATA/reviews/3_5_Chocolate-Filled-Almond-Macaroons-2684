A Passover favorite at our house. Definitely use non stick foil (we spray with butter pam too)since they can get very sticky.

Delicious and a big hit with my family. Easy recipe! I used slightly less than 1 cup sugar since almost identical recipes exist for 1/2 and 2/3 c sugar to the same egg writes and almond paste amounts. I didn't bother with the chocolate part and placed a single almond sliver in the center of each cookie for "identification." (people with nut allergies appreciate the identification!) I used nonstick aluminum foil and the cookies came off easily after cooling slightly.

I adore almond macaroons, and the flavor was wonderful. But even after cooking it an additional 5 minutes, it wasn't browning very well, and the cookies were impossible to get cleanly off the tray - even though I heavily buttered it as instructed. Sigh, a disappointment.

This was my first time making macaroons, and, after worrying that the proportions wouldn't work, I'm happy to report that this recipe can be halved very successfully. I actually had 4 ounces of almond paste (half a tin of Solo brand, left over from a pear and frangipane tart made earlier), which I combined with 1/2 cup sugar and one egg white. The macaroons -- maybe I didn't portion them correctly but I ended up with 14 dough-dollops, or seven filled cookies -- spread beautifully in the oven, and I was delighted by the results. Try this, it's fabulous!

A disaster. I love almond macaroons but there is something seriously wrong here. Followed recipe exactly, but cookies began to burn at about 3 minutes into the specified 10 minutes of baking. Result: a sticky inedible mess. I don't know how to explain the success of other cooks who have rated this recipe, but I've been baking for decades and don't recall anything this disastrous before.

Yeah. These are amazing so there is not much more to say. I'm a bit indecisive re the raw almonds on both sides, perhaps might only do one side for stability, but really, one can't go wrong. Oh, and bittersweet is the only way to fly, my friends.

I sandwiched these with milk chocolate instead of bittersweet, since that is my personal preference..but regardless, the cookies themselves..melt in your mouth, and the slight hint of orange in the ganache is decadent! This cookie is definitely a keeper :)
