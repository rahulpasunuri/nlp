I didn't measure the ingredients but I was relatively close to the recipe. Used frozen orange juice instead of freshly squeezed. We enjoyed the sauce over seared tuna along with steamed asparagus, peas, and potato.

Good recipe to fool around with, but it wasn't thrilling as is. I tried to finish a bottle of La Choy - should have used Kikkoman, it's a lighter, sweeter soy sauce.

Amazing recipe! The sesame seed crust is key. We skipped the oven cooking since we like tuna seared and rare in the middle. It turned out great!

If you are a cook like me who appreciates healthy food with simple, fresh ingredients, then you will like this recipe. I wouldn't make it for a dinner party but it is perfect for a weeknight meal.

I wish there were a negative fork. This was horrible! I made exactly as directed and it did, like some reviewers had mentioned, taste exactly like burnt soy sauce. In an effort to remedy, I tried some of the additions (garlic, chiles, honey) that other reviewers suggested, and the honey helped somewhat but not enough. Threw it out and started over with a different recipe.

Oy vez Poseidon- worst recipe I've tried after 5 years on this site. This is also the first review I've written after 5 years of successful cooking. Epicurious is my cooking Bible, but this one sucks. The flavor was HORRIBLE!!!!! I wouldn't recommend this to an oriental dog. The vinegar ruined all the lovely fresh orange juice I squeezed. I tried to doctor it up by adding orange marmalade and ending up pitching the whole lot. I wouldn't spoil my lovely fish with this rot.

The sesame seeds detract from the marvelous taste of tuna. The sauce had an overpowering soy flavor that hid the tuna flavor...it could have been any kind of fish. 1 to 1 1/2 minutes per side and no oven cooking for nice rare tuna. Not a bad dish, but not good enough to repeat. And I had no problem with the sauce...took 25 minutes to reduce to 1 1/2 cups. (The recipe says 1/4 cup per serving.) Ms. "professional range" should look up the definition of "simmer" on this website. Then she would know that simmering is done on relatively low heat. If I used the mega-burner on my stove, the sauce would have boiled over and then burned.

In addition to the sauce I seared the tuna in a fennel, pepper, salt crust. The flavours merried very nicely

This dish was delicious! We added garlic, honey and crushed red pepper (about a pinch) as previous reviewers suggested and it turned out great! The sauce was the perfect consistancy we were surprised to see how many people had said their sauce was runny. We added telicherry pepper and salt to the tuna steaks and it gave such a wonderful flavor to the dish. We will be making this again!

Almost missed purchasing the sesame seeds since they were listed in the ingredients. We used a combination of sesame, cumin seeds, and black pepper to coat the tuna which added a great flavor. The sauce was great but added a touch of honey to sweeten -- my husband loved it!

Sorry for the typos! You used to be able to revise your reviews. What happened??

Okay, I didn't make this recipe as-is so I'll be faire and not rate it, but I think I my experience my help others, so here goes. Bsically I made the sauce and, without cooking it, marinated the fish in it. I didn't have ginger so I used garlic instead. After the fish was done marinating, I did reduce the sauce and served it on the side. As a sauce, it was delicious but as a marinade I think the citrus flavors overpowered the delicate flavor of the tune. I wouldn't recommend using it as a marinade.

I took some of the suggestions in this thread of reviews and it all turned out wonderfully. And I, too, cook on an electric range with an uneven burner to boot. i used rice wine vinegar instead of basalmic, crusted the fish with fresh cracked pepper and sea alt as well as sesame seeds, added garlic, and added honey. i served this over wilted watercress with a side of wasabi mashed potatoes. each was a compliment to the others. my husband and i simply gorged on this dish. it was fantastic.

Really enjoyed this recipe in spite of my "heaven forbidden" electric range. What a snob! The sauce is perfect with the seared tuna - light with just enough savory flavor. Enjoy!

I had no problem reducing the sauce since we have a professional range. Remember this recipe was developed in a restaurant and if you have a standard gas range or (heaven forbid) an electric stove it will take a lot longer to reduce. I would suggest that if you don't feel the reduced sauce has enough citrus zip then add a squeeze or two of lemon and lime at the end--I tried that and it really brightened the sauce a lot. I also agree that the oven is unnecessary and simply searing the tuna is sufficient.

Yes, adding garlic to the sauce ingredients is key. Also, I always add black pepper to any savory orange sauce (after it has reduced). It really sets off the orange flavor.

Rating: 4
I made this exactly per the recipe and it turned out great. Depending on the sweetness of the oranges that you use, you might need to add some honey. You can add this towards the end after reducing the sauce to your desired consistency.

I found the sauce to be a great blend of flavors. I used tropicana o.j. and low-sodium soy sauce, and I simmered the sauce until it was reduced by half. (it takes a while--just put it on the back burner and have a glass of wine with your guests!). It is a thin sauce, but wow what a kick of flavor. The second time I made it, I should have strained out the ginger about half way through the reducing time, because it overpowered the flavor a bit. Garlic would be a good addition too, and I liked the suggestion of adding green onion to the fish. Go with what you like.

The sauce was way too thin, I cooked it for at least 30 minutes then again (reheated) another 15 minutes. The soy sauce was way too overpowering, after juicing 7 oranges and the lemons and limes, then adding the light soy sauce, it ruined the sauce. Then I followed the directions, 1 minute seared then baked for 3 minutes. If overcooked the tuna. I was dissapointed. Yes, I cook often so I know how to cook, and this will not be on the menu.

This recipe is great as it is. Of course if it is well made. An advice to those who say it is bad, awful etc. Learn to cook! To improve this recipe, boil the sauce longer, cool and place some over the tuna and let marinate for about 1 hour. Dry tuna well. Boil the remaining sauce and add 1 or 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter to it. Serve topped with lots of chopped green onions.

This was a delicious summer dinner. We followed the modified recipe with garlic, etc. and have to say that it made the recipe! I might suggest toasting the sesame seeds lightly prior to coating the tuna as it enhances the flavor. We also didn't have fresh giner so we used sushi ginger and cut out the vinegar from the original recipe.

The sauce is really good. I use it over chicken or fish and it tastes great!

I like to make this for dinner parties because I can make the sauce ahead, the fish takes literally minutes to cook, so I have time to enjoy the guests and the party myself.

I served this sauce over salmon at a dinner party-to rave reviews. Two friends called the next day for the recipe! Two key changes, however. I substituted sherry vinegar for the more pungent balsamic. I also added one chopped garlic clove and a tablespoon of honey. Simmer for at least 30 minutes or until reduced by half.

Not again in MY kitchen! Lacked intensity of flavor. There are several other tuna recipes on this site that are much better!

Rating: 4
I agree with some other reviewers who said add honey. Also, I left out the ginger because a dinner guest was allergic. It came out great! I would definitely cook the sauce longer than the recipe calls for - it allows the flavors to blend better and takes a little of the strong citrus flavor out. I served this with wasabi mashed potatoes and it was a hit!

The tuna was great. Next time I will go a little lighter on the sauce so that it dominates less.

This is a great and versatile sauce. I used it on broiled salmon, halibut and blanched snap peas. It is light and not overpowering and is even tasty over cooked, cold soba noodles or salad. Careful not to use too much ginger root, it can be too strong a flavor. Highly recommend this recipe!!

The sauce was great. Baked the tuna a little longer than called for in the oven, and lessened the amount of ginger. Worth making again and again.

This was a delicious recipe which I enhanced with a lot of other ingredients. For the citrus sauce I used one cup of orange juice and half of soy and no vinegar. I also added shallots and garlic, two tablespoons of apricot jam and red pepper flakes. As a veggie side, I served thinly sliced fennel, carrots, chinese cabbage, red onion and peas sauteed in a tiny bit of asian sesame oil and some chicken stock. I added a lot of fresh cilantro to this and served white rice on the side. Yum. Excellent starter recipe, but don't be afraid to add everything else you like, And the tuna doesn't need to be cooked in the oven after stove top. It's low calorie and low fat too, only problem is - I had two helpings!

I used the adapted recipe from cook in Amesburg, MA and it turned out wonderfully. I used about 2 tablespoons of minced ginger from a jar and it tasted great also used a little honey to sweeten it up a bit. I'd definetly make it again.

Ick--I shouldn't have even bothered making this dish. The sauce was way too thin, too soy-ish, and too tart all at once--with chile sauce, honey, cornstarch, and yellow miso I managed to doctor it up, but it was still overly citrus-y for the tuna steaks. It made a nice presentation, but I've definitely made better tuna dishes with Asian flairs. Skip this one!

I have made this sauce to serve with both ahi tuna and salmon (pan seared). It was such a hit at guest dinners that the guests have asked for the recipe to serve at their dinner parties. Word of advice, simmer the sauce to the desired consistency. This will blend the flavors and achieve the right viscosity. Enjoy.

I used fresh, tangy orange juice and found it gave an amazing citrus flavor. I served the tuna (very rare, skipped the last step) over lemon-zested mashed yukon gold potatoes, this was a perfect match! The potatoes absorbed the sauce and complimented the texture of the tuna perfectly.

Inspired by this recipe, but mindful of comments of others, here is my variation on this sauce: 2 cups fresh orange juice 4 tablespoons fresh lime juice 4 tablespoon soy sauce 2 tablespoon rice wine vinegar 2 teaspoon Asian sesame oil 5-6 drops hot sauce (i.e. Tabasco) or more to taste 2/3 cup chopped peeled fresh gingerroot Combine all the ingredients in a saucepan. Bring to a boil and reduce until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. Adjust seasonings. You may want to add a little honey if the sauce is too tart. Do not strain the sauce; the bits of ginger are wonderful.

we substituted a non stick cooking spray for the oil and it worked great. The citris is marvelous. the sauce was thin but I'm sure it could be easily thickened and be even better.

The sauce was too thin and tasted more of soy suace than citrus. I added some orange marmalade and chili garlic sauce and saved it, but cutting the soy sauce to begin with would be a good idea.

I made this with tuna and salmon last night so that we could have a taste-test. They were both so completely different and quite good. This recipe is really easy. I started with tempura shrimp, asparagus with sesame dressing, steamed rice and a bottle of gewurtztraminer. It was an easy and interesting meal.
