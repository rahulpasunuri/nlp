We use this recipe a lot. Usually I halve it, and use a pizza pan, since I like it thinner and crispier, more cracker-like. It's a great one to play with - I've added Spanish smoked paprika, or other seasonings with happy results!

Delicious and rates high with the two other farinata recipes that I've tried.

It's really good, try making it. For best results try increasing the amount of olive oil and decreasing the salt. I have experimented by putting pitted green olives into the batter which was very good. Next I am going to try sun dried tomatoes. This is an authentic dish of Italy. My wife and I ate it in Piza during our honeymoon. Ah memories.
