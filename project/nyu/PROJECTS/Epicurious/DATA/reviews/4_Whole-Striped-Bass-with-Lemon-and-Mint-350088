We made this last night -- last minute with ingredients on hand. It was delicious and easy. The mint, lemon, scallion mix was perfect. And it looked so appetizing -- tasted great too. We would definitely do this one again!

Quick. Easy. Kids liked it. Pretty on a platter. What's not to like? Served it with roasted potatoes and green beans.

Have used this on both bass and rainbow trout. Excellent each time. Wonderful blend of flavors!

Didn't have the exact recipe when I made it, but my combination of ingredients was roughly the same. Used swordfish (best fish available that day). Fabulous. It's like chimchurri but with the mint flavor that's so distinctive. I used leftover sauce as a spread on a chunk of baguette for a sandwich with the leftover fish. Addictive.

This same sauce works great for grilled lamb ribs!

Exceptional in taste and presentation. Followed recipe exactly (unusual for me). Had to ask my fish monger for whole fish when only fillets were displayed. Served with roasted baby Yukon Golds and spiced butter glazed carrots. NB My 2 1/2 lb fish served 3. Can't wait to show this off to guests.

Got a line caught sea bass from Borough Market that came in that day. Followed the recipe exactly. Wonderful!!! Served with roasted fingerlings and asparagus along with a baguette. Will make again-- definitely.

I made this recipe as it was presented to me in my October 2008 Bon Appetit. It was so delicious and made for a stunning presentation. The prep took the longest, but cooking was a breeze... I broiled it for 5 minutes on each side and it was done to perfection! Initially I was uncertain about the reserved sauce, but when I ate it with the fish, it really complimented the meal. Will definitely be adding this to my arsenal of recipes!

Excellent! I had filets, so did not turn to other side. Just broiled 6 minutes, then flaked with a fork to test. I ran short of mint, so added fresh dill & basil --- everyone asked for the recipe.

Instead of bass, I used rainbow trout but I followed everything else as written. Fish was moist and flavorful. Be careful not to overcook - 5 mins per side under the broiler is really all you need. The lemon-mint sauce gave the fish a very subtle but balanced flavor. Don't skimp on the lemons or the mint. They really make this dish superb! I would definitely make again.

Easy, quick, and very elegant. Fish was incredible! Will definitely make again.
