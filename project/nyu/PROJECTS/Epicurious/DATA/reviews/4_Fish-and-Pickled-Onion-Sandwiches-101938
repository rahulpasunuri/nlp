Great summer sandwich! The market didn't have catfish fillets, so I used tilapia instead, which worked fine. I'm not sure why the recipe calls for vegetable oil; I used olive oil instead to delightful effect. The only thing we didn't love was the cornmeal crust. I think I'd use panko another time. I'll definitely be making this again, though!

Yummy beyond fish sandwich compare! This should be named Fish Sandwich Extraordinaire or something, so as to attract more takers. Thin fillets, I agree, are a must. Forget the side dishes . . . I just wanted another sandwich!

Easy dish to make. Delicious flavor. My family loves this. The onions are my favorite. I have made this numerous times. I prefer it when the fillets are thin. You must try this great summertime recipe.
