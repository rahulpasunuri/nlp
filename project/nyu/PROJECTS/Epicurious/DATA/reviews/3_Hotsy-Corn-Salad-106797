This was a big hit at my ladies-only margarita happy hour--many requests for the recipe. I used mangos instead of papaya. It was still tasty two days later.

A very good spring salad recipe, would be good with a Southwestern theme meal

I really loved this recipe. I added a bit more pepper since the papaya was so sweet. Family loved it. I'm making it again this weekend.

Also tried replacing papaya with mango - very good

No there was to much corn and the flavors didnt blend well. I am an experienced cook and I was looking for a quite healthy fix but this just didnt cut it.
