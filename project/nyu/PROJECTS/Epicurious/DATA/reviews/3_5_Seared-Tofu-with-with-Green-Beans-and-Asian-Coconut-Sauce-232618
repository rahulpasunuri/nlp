I liked it! I did change a couple of things since people didn't love the original results. I marinated the tofu as described and then broiled it in the oven (sprayed cookie sheet with olive oil and then sprayed the tofu as well and added some pepper) I broiled it for about 20 minutes until it got a little toasty. I followed the rest of the recipe as is except also added a few lime leaves that I had in the freezer to the coconut milk and seemed to add some extra depth to he flavor.

I've made this recipe twice and like it very much but I did twist it a little. I added a couple dashes of fish sauce, a tablespoon or so of red curry paste, upped the amounts of ginger, red pepper flakes and garlic. I also pressed the tofu first and weighted it down between plates and paper towels to get the water out. When frying the tofu in the beginning I put in a split open serrano chili and left it there in the peanut oil until the dish was done. Everyone liked it, even my meat eating husband.

Honestly, I thought this was a darned good dish. I used a bit of fish sauce too, and baby bok choy in place of green beans, which I didn't have. Made for great leftovers, too - no complaints at all. Good flavor.

This is a keeper, not fabulous but solid! I added eggplant - because I had some and I heeded the advice of earlier reviews and amped up the red pepper. Served it with brown rice at hubby's request. If you want it hotter, add a squirt of Siracha at the table :)

Rather bland and not terribly interesting.

Meh... Needs a lot of help. But I guess it's a good enough for the little effort and fuss involved. I used fish sauce instead of salt and much more lime and still needed more salt and shredded basil leaves to give it any sort of appeal. Guess one should not expect a fragrant flavorful restaurant level Thai dish from such a simple preparation...

My husband loved this dish, and I was thrilled because it was the first time I was able to cook tofu without it becoming a crumbled curdled mess in the sauce. I would have liked it if there was a bit more sauce. I served it over asian style noodles, like the ones you get with Pad Thai, and it was delicious! Definitely will make again!

I made this for some friends as a "quick" kind of meal after the gym. I thought it had great flavor. I like a lot of sauce/gravy on my rice so for the next time i'll double the liquid. I also didn't have roasted cashews but it still was delicious!

Rating: 4
I made this the first time just as the recipe suggested. Fantastic! Amazing! The second time I made it, I tried to be the Low Fat Hero, using lite coconut milk, just as the recipe told me not to do. Lo and behold...terrible. Stick to the high fat and you won't be disappointed.

I've made this dish several times now and it remains a favorite at my house. Once I made it with only green beans, but it was fine. This last time, I added a 1/2 tsp of thai red curry paste and a couple matchstick chopped celery sticks (I was low on green beans) and it was better than ever. yum yum yum.

easy and delicious! I didn't have any red bell pepper or nuts, but it was fine without. I only had 3/4 can of coconut milk, but had just enough sauce anyway. will definitely make again!

This recipe was great BUT... you need more red pepper flakes (about 1t) and a little more lime juice (from a whole lime). It was outstanding - I would make it again.

Rating: 3
Delicious but my beans needed more time, which actually reduced the sauce without needing extra time at the end.

Rating: 3
I made this dish for my girlfriend and I last night and we both loved it! I doubled the red pepper flakes for a little more spice. And instead of using the full amount of coconut milk I used half, and then mixed it with an equal amount water. The sauce was still quite tasty, and it picked up the garlic, ginger, and perpper flavors nicely.

Rating: 4
I made this for my family tonight and I thought it was very nice. The beans were crispy yet not too raw and the sauce was creamy and fragrant. Be careful not to overcook the coconut sauce as may become too thick and slightly sickening. I used 2 tablespoons of lime juice instead of one and it added extra "zing" to the dish. It may have been a lot nicer if the tofu was chopped in smaller pieces and cooked last to preserve the heat. Everyone in my family enjoyed this- from my eight year old brother to my 43 year old father.

Rating: 4
I made this tonight to universal acclaim. I had 1 1/2 of green beans, so I increased tofu to 28 oz. (I also increased garlic and ginger, but only 1 can of light coconut milk.) I also added 2 T of red curry paste, put lid on green beans to get them tender. It was absolutely delicious. I used peanuts (didn't have cashews in cupboard): don't pay attention to those who said to skip the nuts. They were grand. This meal was very easy and elegant.

Rating: 4
Much enjoyed. Definitely will try the low fat coconut milk next time. Added a little chicken. Would use a few less grean beans. Did not use the cashews on an assumption of fat content but I think they would add a nice crunch. I will have to look into this.

This dish kicks ass. Made it with these variations: Says to serve w/ rice or noodles but I had neither on hand; found that the combo of tofu and coconut milk proved rich enough on its own to be a one-dish meal, and there wasn't a lot of extra sauce to soak up anyway. Needed more than 2T soy sauce for marinating. Didn't have a bell pepper on hand, and didn't miss it. In fact, I think the dish was better without it. Verdict: skippable. Used lemon instead of lime. Didn't add cashews. I think they would have been an annoying textural addition.

Rating: 3
I sauteed the tofu in toasted sesame oil and it gave it a very rich flavor.Also I substituted peanuts for the cashews because my son is allergic to cashews.

Rating: 4
One of the best stir-fry recipes I've made in a long time. It was even better the next day, when the flavors had time to meld. I used a bit more hot pepper flakes, garlic and ginger than the recipe called for, as I prefer my dishes a little spicier. The cashews are not necessary, but add an interesting texture.

Rating: 3
Overall, pretty great. I made two changes: 1) used a wasabi-soy marinade instead of the plain soy sauce, which gave it a more complex flavor; and 2) 3/4 of a can of low-fat coconut milk - and the sauce actually didn't have to reduce at all.

Rating: 0
I love the dish. I don't eat tofu, so I used tilapia, instead. I used coconut water, chicken stock and eveporated milk as the sauce base. I selected these because they are less fattening and expensive than coconut milk.

Rating: 3
The dish is super tasty....a few notes: make sure you use coconut milk not water otherwise you end up with a thin sauce, use a large enough pan that the beans aren't layered too much a bit too much liquid, last but not least I feel the dish could use a bit more salt.

Rating: 0
All I can say is....YUM!! I used low fat coconut milk and it wasn't bad at all. We will for sure be making this again.

Great and great-tasting recipe. I used Chinese Long Beans and cooked a lot longer than 6 minutes---till they shrivelled up. Added fish sauce, too, to liven it up. Complex blend of flavors. Will try with mushrooms next time!

Like other reviewers, I found issues with the recipe being a little lacking in flavor. Luckily, I had a bevy of Asian spices to add in. This is always a subjective issue, so taste as you go along to make sure your getting the results you were expecting. I adjusted to add more hot spice and sweetness. One major flaw I saw was the cooking time for tender veggies. The recipe calls for cooking the beens until tender for approx. 6 min. Using an electric range, my beans were still pretty chewy at 6 min.; more so than I like. Maybe next time I'll try steaming them a little first. I can only give this recipe 1 fork because it's so open to interpretation, but I would make it again as a base recipe with modifications.

Being a fan of dishes with coconut milk, I enjoyed this recipe. I used a lot more soy sauce to marinate the tofu and probably used only 1/2 can of coconut milk. I also skipped the lime juice. I will probably make some version of this again.

It's delicious and simple to make. I'm not chef by any means but in an hour I had a meal that my friends thoroughly enjoyed. I would say that you should reduce the amount of green beans though...1/2 lb should be fine.

You people are all crazy. This dish is absolutely delicious! Although I might take some of the advice on lightening it a little in the interest of health.

I feel a little split on this one. The first time I made it, it was wonderful. I used only about 2/3 can of coconut milk, added some white wine and chicken broth to the sauce (to prevent the thick, stickiness that others referenced), and added more red pepper/ginger/garlic. It was fabulous. So fabulous that I made it again the next week, with awful results. The only real difference was that I used a different brand of coconut milk the second time. I guess my conclusion is to try, try again if you don't like it - apparently not all coconut milk is canned equal...

I made this for my vegan brother and his girlfriend. We all really liked it. My 1 year old son loved the crunchy tofu. I doubled most of the vegetables and added water chestnuts.

Rating: 2
This was good but not great. I used light coconut milk, which was definitely the way to go, and I still found the sauce heavier than I liked. Next time I make this I might use 2/3 coconut milk and 1/3 veg broth or water...or something like that. The sauce needs a little more complexity of flavor, and a little less gloopiness, than the coconut milk provides. The overall idea is good though, and it could definitely be a 3-forker with some alteration.

Rating: 3
This was very good. I used a bit more garlic, ginger, and red pepper flake. Right before I pulled the veggies out of the broth mixture I added some fresh chopped mango. It was a great addition! Enjoyed the sweet, spicy, salty bites very much. I served this will steamed brown rice. Simple, healthy, and deeelish!

I fell sick with stomach flu after making this recipe. The taste was great but the huge mistake is never to add coconut milk in a recipe which does not have much water and the worst part is lime aggrevated this I guess. I would suggest people to add water if they would like to have gravy and then add coconut milk else skip both.

Rating: 1
This was almost inedible. Or rather, it was inedible, until I strained off the sauce. I'm not sure why I didn't figure out that a sauce whose sole ingredient is coconut milk was going to be a disaster before I started the recipe, but alas I didn't. You don't need to make the same mistake. Even when I added a little curry paste, it was still cloying and nauseating.

Rating: 4
With some minor adjustments this is a 4 fork recipe. I used lemon juice instead of lime, a little extra soy sauce, and substituted 6 dried red chilis (this makes it very spicy) for the red pepper flakes. I also used low-fat coconut milk and a lot less oil than is asked for. Also cook the beans/peppers for longer than is suggested. The result is a very authentic tasting Thai dish sure to please anyone with a taste for the spicy.

Rating: 1
agree with the other poster - the lime juice really did make the tofu taste really off/rancid. and yes, pretty high in fat for such a dish that doesn't have the richness and flavor of curry (well-worth the fat in my opinion :)

Rating: 1
I cannot see the appeal of this recipe, and I've done a lot of good tofu dishes. Frankly, it was almost sickeningly rich, and made the tofu taste rancid to me. My girlfriend and I could not even finish what we took on our plates. Really gross.

Sooo good! Like other reviewers, I used frozen beans and pressed the tofu first. Would definitely recommend low-fat coconut milk in the future -- as written, the recipe has waaayy too much fat: 31g, 17g saturated (by my calculations).

This was delicious! Instead of red bell pepper I used butternut squash, which worked well. I also added a little fish sauce and a touch of brown sugar to bring out the other flavors. Yum!

This recipe was delicious! I made it with bok choy and no nuts to fit what I had on hand - it would be excellent with any vegetable. I also breaded the tofu (just rolled it in flour) just because I love it that way. I will make this over and over again. It's really important to press & dry the tofu and don't leave out the fresh lime juice - it really adds that perfect touch!

Rating: 4
If you press the firm tofu between 2 plates w/ paper towels between the plates, the tofu loses a lot of water and ends up really absorbing the soy sauce.

Forgot about the lime juice and cashews, but this was delicious without. Didn't have vegetable oil, so mixed roasted peanut oil and olive oil together.

Vegetarian 8-year-old and the rest of the family loved it! Quick and easy. There was no need to remove the vegetables and reduce the sause further.

Absolutely delicious! Like other reviewers, I used low-fat coconut milk and the dish was still great. My fresh green beans took ages to soften up, so I ended up skipping the step of taking the vegetables out and reducing the sauce because the sauce was already quite reduced. I strongly recommend this recipe to you!

I like tofu but my husband normally does not. I knew this recipe was a hit after I saw him sneaking the leftovers into his mouth while he was supposed to be putting them in the fridge. I confess I took one shortcut: instead of marinating the tofu, I bought Asian flavored pre-marinated tofu from my local Wegman's. It was delicious, easy, and cooked up all in one pot.

just a tip, but if you freeze and then thaw the tofu before pressing out the water, it will have a meatier consistency

Tasty! Changes I'll make next time: -more flavor needed, maybe use chile garlic sauce? -press tofu before marinating to have the tofu soak up more soy sauce -definitely less oil to fry tofu, and maybe use sesame oil instead Used Trader Joe's French Green Beans which worked perfect as well as TJ's frozen peppers, which was mushy so I think I'll stick to fresh peppers.

This is a staple in our house! I use lowfat coconut milk and reduce the amount of oil. Forbidden rice is the perfect accompaniment! Yummy!

This was great for a tofu dish. I used seasme oil when frying the tofu and only about three TBLS. I also added extra garlic and ginger. For a kick try marinating the tofu with spiracha (garlic chili sauce) as well as soy sauce. It adds more flavor to the tofu. Definite will make again!

Rating: 3
I froze the tofu before cooking, I love the results. I went a little heavy on the pepper, garlic and ginger, next time I will follow the recipe for the pepper part. Everything else was fantastic. I used small sweet peppers in red, yellow and orange for more color. I served it over brown rice.

Rating: 3
Very tasty and very easy weeknight dinner. I added some fresh baby corns and a minced hot pepper for some spice. I also removed most of the oil from the pan after frying the tofu, as there was a lot more oil than I felt was needed for the vegetables. I forgot to add the nuts, but it was still good. I served this over the rice noodles, which I think made it seem a little lighter than it would have if I'd served it over rice.

This has a great flavor, although it's a bit rich. Perhaps it's because I am not a vegetarian, but I think this would be tastier with chicken instead of tofu. I think I'll try that next time. And a little bit more soy sauce for us salt lovers.

Holy cats. I've made this a few times already. Brands of coconut milk seem to produce a slightly different consistency in sauce. Silken-type tofu didn't come out as well as regular, but still delicious--I usually serve it with basmati or brown rice.

I made a few changes for flavour: a fair bit of ginger, more citrus (lemon & tangerine), and I used sesame oil. Used citrus in the tofu marinade, too. I put tangerine slices as garnish, as well. My family liked it quite a lot.

I thought this was great -- the first dish I've made with coconut milk that actually came out well. I also liked the way that the tofu was fried, I will cook it like this more often. I used frozen green beans for the first time, and will use them much more from now on, made the dish even simpler and they were practically as good as fresh. The only thing I would say is that there were too many green beans compared to the tofu; my leftovrers were basically greenbeans in a coconut sauce because my husband and I devored all the tofu. So, I wouldn't change a thing except to use less green beans perhaps. I used sweetened coconut milk and liked the flavor. Will make again!

This was just ok. I used light coconut milk (which I don't think made any difference) and just sprinkled cashews over (not chopped). Not bad but I don't think I would repeat it- flavor was just a bit too bland for my palate.

This was a strange mix of Chinese stir-fry and Thai cuisine. My tofu looked crisp and brown, but remained soft even though I used extra firm tofu. The dish was quite edible, however. If I make it again, I will definitely add some red or green Thai chili sauce and hope for better results.

This was really fabulous! Very rich though, so I will try the lower fat coconut milk next time. Also, I will cut back on the salt to 1/2 tsp as the soy and salted cashews really added up. I guess the fact that I added more like 1/2 cup+ of cashews may have contributed to that. Take that into consideration if you like extra nuts! As I am not a vegetarian, I would also like to try this dish with beef as an alternative, even though I will definitely be making it with tofu again!

This simple dish is wonderful - also used Trader Joe's frozen green beans, sooo easy. I always store my firm tofu in the freezer - simply thaw it before use by running warm water over it, then press all of the moisture out of it. This really improves the texture. Other than that, prepared it according to the directions and it was very tasty. My boyfriend and I both loved it and it will now be in our regular rotation.

This was fantastic and very quick. You could make this with pretty much any veggies on hand, too--it would be great with summer squash, for example. We substituted peanuts for the cashews. I also added a little hot chili sauce to mine, though my wife omitted it.

This was really simple and delicious. The texture of the tofu is just perfectly the way I like it, a bit crunchy on the outside and soft in the center. I added about 1/2 red onion when I added ginger/chili flakes, and also used some broccoli instead of just all green beans.

Wow. That was really good! I just finished making it. I used the frozen French green beans from Trader Joe's and a fresh red pepper. Next time, I'm going try it with Trader Joe's frozen peppers too.

Took to a vegetarian pot-luck and was gone in a flash. However, one major correction to the recipe is needed: After you halve the block of tofu, drain thoroughly on several layers of paper towels before marinating in soy sauce. No need to pat dry after marinating.
