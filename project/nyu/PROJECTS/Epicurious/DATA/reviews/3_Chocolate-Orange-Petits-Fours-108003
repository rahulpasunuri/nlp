This was a backup dessert for the coconut cream tart (in case it didn't set - and it didn't). They are a very attractive dessert, but my guests prefered the soupy coconut tart. My children however thought these were great. I had to recut the finished cake with my cookie shape as they spread while cooking (why not just cook them in a pan and then cut them with shapes?). Will not make them again as I have so many other things to try.

The picture looks great, however, I ended up with 25 dry little hockey pucks. The ingredients seem like a sure thing, but there was no salvaging these poor things.

Looks good with the suggested glaze drizzled in zigzags/stripes. I used Pampered Chef's 1.25" "creative cutters" in the heart, flower, and star shapes. Found dough a little difficult to release from the cutters, esp. the star. Spraying w/ cooking spray seemed to help, but frozen dough also helped. I had refrigerated mine overnight but froze the remainder as I went. 12 min. in the oven was the ideal time for mine. They rise in the middle when they're done.

This is definitely a winner. Made it as part of my advanced baking final, came out wonderful... easiest recipe you wwill ever maky, definitely freeze the doucgh for a while though, i would also reccommend putting a tiny bit of candied orange rind on the top after piping some cream on it, an orange glaze (sugar and OJ and orange zest) would also go great on top of these marvelous "little Cakes"

Talk about taking french baking to the max! A dish beyond compare where a touch of orange and a flare of blasting chocolate makes a wonderful desert! My gests adored them and requested I make them the next time they came.

I made these for a friend's party, and woo-wee! They are delightful. Addictive, even. And cute. What more could you ask? Next time I'll reduce the oven time--they came out a teench dry. But I am definitely making these again!
