I only made the filling, and used my own dough recipe. This was the best pumpkin pie I've ever had, hands down! I had to bake it for quite a bit longer than the recipe stated, however, probably about 90min.

Creamy and yummy! Wonderful flavor. Will make this again. Oh I didn't have whole milk so I used 2 percent with some half n half instead.

I used a fresh pie pumpkin from the patch at my church. Also, used a spelt crust. It was one of the best pies I have ever eaten. Highly recommend the fresh pumpkin. It was less expensive than buying the canned and much easier to prepare than you might think!

We love the taste of pumpkin pie. I would like to make only the filling and I would also like to make it in the microwave. Has anyone tried to do that and how did it turn out?

Made my man V E R Y happy with this recipe. From previous suggestions, doubled + the cinnamon and ginger. Was out of cloves so added a pinch of nutmeg and the best part was using a NILLA pie crust. Made this pie so fast. Already getting requests to make again.

2 things absolutely necessary - prebake the crust and use a real pumpkin! Real pumpkin is easy - cut in half, scoop out the seeds, put in a 400 degree oven for an hour (might need to cover with foil half way through), makes all the difference! Just enough richness from all that cream (next time will just go with all heavy cream!) and silkiness of the real pumpkin goodness. Added cardamom for that special kick. Definitely recommend putting cardamom in everything - you will become a star baker overnight! Cardamom rules in anything to do with desert. Just enough so that they do not know it is there...

I substituted acorn squash (no pumpkin on hand) and used half-and-half instead of cream. It was delicious, sweet and creamy.

This recipe was ok; I guess my tastes in pumpkin pie differ from everyone else's. I make a lot of pies, so I know my problem with this recipe wasn't an inability to bake pies. The cons I had: it tasted bland; I added more spice; it still tasted bland. The baking time was off - I left it in for over an hour but it still didn't seem cooked; maybe that's the light fluffy texture everyone's raving about, but to me it seemed incomplete. The pros: a simple recipe at heart. You probably won't need to go fetch ingredients for it. It's a good recipe for anyone who thinks normal pumpkin pie is inherently too dense, and for those who want more of a cloud-like autumn pie.

Hands down the best pumpkin pie I have ever tasted. The heavy cream MAKES IT. I used canned organic pumpkin, and pumpkin pie spice instead of individual spices. It's creamy, it's wonderful.

This is one of the best pumpkin pies I have ever eaten! I usually change the spices around a bit like adding a little more clove and definitely some nutmeg. I also make my own crust which makes a HUGE difference. It's an awesome filling, however.

I used my own crust recipe, but followed the filling recipe exactly. Good, traditional pumpkin pie, but I like a little denser filling.

Very bland. I thought it was when I tasted the filling, so I added some more spices and it was STILL bland. If you want a pie that tastes pretty much like sweetened pumpkin puree, this is it.

This pie is the perfect texture and flavor for anyone who loves a traditional pumpkin pie. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and it got rave reviews from even the most discriminating matriarchs. Can't wait to make it again!

Very much the traditional pumpkin pie. It was delicious, but it did not taste any different than the libby's pie recipe made with evaporated milk. I think it is insane to roast your own pumpin...each one has varying sugar levels, and you risk ruining the pie over a silly step! Just my own opinion...

Great recipe for those who want a traditional pumpkin pie. The filling is very light, and it's not too sweet, either.

The filling was great. I used light whipping cream because I grabbed the wrong carton. It still was great. Lighter pumpkin flavor than traditional pumpkin pie. It was liked by even those who claim not to like pumpkin pie.

This has been the pumpkin pie of choice for our Thanksgiving table since the recipe was published in 1999. The filling is sinfully creamy and decadent, and it is truly simple to make. I'm not wild about the crust, as I prefer a sweeter dough, so this year I've found an alternate dough recipe.

This is more custard-y than the traditional pumpkin pie. The crust was flaky, not soggy at all. Overall, a more delicate, less rustic take on pumpkin pie with the best crust.

I just wanted to ask how one could possibly consider a pumpkin pie recipe which calls for canned pumpkin a gourmet recipe? Really, it is worth the trouble of preparing the filling from scratch. It takes aboout 4 small pumpkins (you don't want to use large ones) to yield 2 cups of filling. Divide the pumpkins into eigths, clean them out and then cut them again width-wise. Place shell side down in a roasting tin. Bake in a medium oven for 2-3 hours (checking to be sure that it hasn't burned!). Scrape the meat from the shell and whizz in a food processor till smooth. If you have the time, add your spices to the pumpkin mixture and allow to sit in the fridge for a day. Well worth the trouble!!!

I thought there was something missing from this recipe. I didn't pack the brown sugar--so maybe it wasn't sweet enough. I also used dark brown sugar--does that make a different? I didn't think it was any better than the evaporated milk recipes.

I love this recipe, silky smooth texture with just the right amount of spices so the delicate pumpkin flavor comes through. IMO, much better than the evaporated milk versions.

A really good pumpkin pie recipe. I used my own crust, but the filling was delicious. The only change I might make is upping the cloves and cinnamon. I used 1/4 c. 2% and 1/4 c. whipping cream as I forget to buy the whole milk. Next time I might just use all whipping cream. A very tasty pie!

Ohmigod!!! It was sooooo good! You see, I am only 13 but i LOVE(!!!) cooking, or should I say cheffing! This was both delicious and easy. I used a graham cracker crust, and it was still wondeful. My dad, (who hates pumpkin pie) even liked it! The filling is custard-like and very yummy. Definately a new family tradition!!!

This was good, but nothing special. It also would have been pretty boring without a lot of extra spice; I increased all the spices and added pumpkin pie spice too. This is nice and easy but there are more interesting pumpkin recipes that would be more rewarding.

Really love this pie and not a big pumpkin pie fan. I think it is the cream. I didn't make the crust, but followed the recipe for the filling and it is delicious, even better after it has been refrigerated for awhile.

This is an excellent pumpkin pie recipe. The filling is custard-like and the crust is good too. I disagree with a previous review about the crust. How could you not like a crust with 3/4 stick of butter in it? Be forewarened though making the crust, it's not for the faint hearted. Don't overwork it, chill it well, and roll it out pronto.

Four forks for the filling only. The pie shell was sub-par and I would never use it again!

I need a pumpkin pie recipe that can be non-diary-- I tried this one with a few modifications and it turned out fabulously!! I replaced the whole milk with an equal amount of soy milk and I replaced the heavy cream with an equal amount of soft silken tofu. I blended the pumpkin, tofu, and soy milk together in the blender, and then followed the rest of the recipes directions. I pumped up the spices a bit and cheated a little because I used a frozen pie crust. It was so yummy and so much healthier than the original version-- I will definitely make this again.

I made this yesterday, and it was great! My husband had two pieces. I did use fresh pumpkin and half and half instead of the milk/cream combination. I had some filling left over, so I carmelized 3/4 C. of sugar, poured it in a baking pan, and poured the filling over it. I baked it at 375 degrees in a water bath for about 30 minutes. Instant pumpkin caramel! Messy to dish out, but it sure tasted good!

This was very creamy and delicious! Everyone absolutely loved it. I also served it with a spiced whipped cream which really is better with this than plain whipped cream: 1c. whipping cream, 1tsp. cinnamon, 1tsp. vanilla extract, 3tbl. powdered sugar. Definately a keeper.

This is a lovely recipe, not too spicy and amazingly 'creamy'. My French Friends now feel different about traditional American cooking. And they even forgot to ask if it should be be served with ketchup, which they think is our national food.

This recipe was excellent! The crust was very buttery and flaky, and the pumpkin filling was delicious. The only change I had to make was that I had to bake the pie for over an hour for the filling to set. I also put a decorative crust around the edge, using mini cookie cutters, after I poured the filling in. I had to put a foil "tent" over the pie in the last 20 minutes to keep the crust from burning. I'll definitely making this one again for our Christmas party.

This pie was GREAT. I don't like sweet deserts, and when I saw that one reader said it wasn't too sweet, I knew this was the pie for me! My family loved it and friends loved it and I was asked to make it again. Actually I have, and just bought another pumpkin so I can make it again for Thanksgiving. I used light cream instead of heavy, and 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice which replaced the other spices. I also don't do pie crusts, and just poured the puree mix into a store bought graham cracker crust. Yum - we at it for breakfast it was so good.
