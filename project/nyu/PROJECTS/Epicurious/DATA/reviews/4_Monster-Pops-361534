I just have one question - do I have to use cake mix and canned frosting? I always make my own but wonder if it would work with this project. I would make a chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream.

I found that there is a large learning curve in dipping the cake pops in the candy topping. They fall off the stick easily and it takes a long time to tap off the extra candy coating in fact sometimes too long and the sprinkles do not adhere to the coating. I started using my small rubber scraper to get the excess coating off faster and then the sprinkles could adhere. It wasn't as pretty, but I had to get many done as a favor for a wedding. Even at that it took days not two hours per cake as the recipe says. Even on my 5th cake and frosting it took a long time. My friend and I had to put the cake balls into the freezer often to prevent having them fall off the stick. They were a great success as a wedding favor and that was the reward for the labor intensive task.

I made this for a regular birthday party. For the balls, I made a dark cocoa cake (no melted chocolate) and bought dark chocolate frosting. I also used dark chocolate candy coating and fun sprinkles. I followed the directions exactly and am grateful for the tips in the recipe. It is indeed time consuming, and keeping the balls cold is a must - otherwise they'll poke through the top of the stick and slide down. The dipping and drying takes a lot of time, but it all came together very nicely. Remember to use a big - or several - styrofoam blocks. I served it with fresh berries and vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved it. :)
