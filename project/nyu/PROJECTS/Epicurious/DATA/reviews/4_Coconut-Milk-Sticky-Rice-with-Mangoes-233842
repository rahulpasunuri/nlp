an unexpected and delightful summer dessert. i served this to cap off an vietnamese meal. cooked the rice in the micro after soaking at 3 min intervals..perfect. do not add more sugar; salt is a must. used 1/3 c dry measure to mold rice to shape; served on top of drizzled alfonso mango pulp. topped with toasted coconut and sesame seeds..yum!

I had lots of peaches on my tree so was looking for good recipes. I cheated and used instant rice (what I had in pantry) and cooked it in the coconut milk -it turned out awesome. Hubby said I could make it every night! ha I served it with fish.

We LOVED this. A relatively light and not-too-sweet desert with one of my favorite fruits. I could not find "sticky rice" so I got sushi rice and just cooked it as the package directed ... which is how most rice cooks (20 minutes very low heat). Then I followed the recipe for the rest. It was lovely. I served it to some guests who were enchanted by it. So unusual, healthy and delish!

I didn't make this recipe, but I gave the recipe to a friend to make for progressive dinner dessert dish for an Asian-themed meal. It was a huge hit and made for a great way to end the "Trip to the Orient" evening.

Awesome Taste ! Loved it immediately once i tried it at some Thai restaurant, and decided to try it at home... this reciepe is very good, but i needed to add more sugar to taste (almost double quantity) and i used mango pure (canned mango pulp) on top as it was served that way in the restaurant beside the mango slices... but ladies this mango pure is a real fantastic addition to it, as it incorporates into the rice and milk to give awesome flavour...if you are an addict to this reciepe try it next time with Alfonso mango pulp on top. Bon appetite :-)

one of my favorite desserts ever first had this at twisted noodle a restraunt which apparently appeared in gormet magazine. I never knew it was so simple to make. use mangos that are slighly soft when squished the skin should detach from fruit easily with your finger. this is a ripe mango. serve warm with mangos being cold. yumm!

I love this recipe! It will surely become one of my signature desserts. I used Korean sweet rice, Thai canned coconut milk and Korean burnt (brown) sugar, something like turbinado. I used a colander in a large soup pot for steaming. In the future I will try putting a scoop of the sticky rice into a Tuscan melon half as an alternative to serving with 1/2 a sliced mango.

Jasmine rice is amazing with this recipe! The combination of flavors is excellent. Will make again and again and again!

I had this dish in a Thai restaurant and had to recreate it at home. It is amazing! The biggest tip, though is that you don't need some crazy basket. I found instructions on another site how to microwave the rice: Drain, then add 4c water to rice in microwave safe bowl. Cover bowl with plate, then microwave and stir in 3 minute intervals until water is absorbed. It took me a total of 12 minutes. Worked great!

The success of this recipe really depends on the quality of the coconut milk and the ripeness of the mangoes. If you can find it, use an organic coconut milk (not low fat) or at least one that contains no preservatives, as they really affect the flavor. Don't skip the salt, as it brings out the flavor of the coconut and the sweetness of the mango. If your mangoes aren't ripe, use the peaches instead. It's not worth making unless you have ripe fruit.

I did a few things differently in this recipe and it turned out great! I used Jasmine brown rice in the rice cooker, and added twice the water as rice, but also threw in half a can of coconut milk. When the rice was done, I added about a tablespoon of light brown sugar, and a few dashes of coarse salt. Paired this rice with some simply marinated b/s chicken breasts (1-2 hrs in Trader Joe's Soyaki sauce), and the mangos on the side. Husband loved it!

Excellent recipe, and so simple, especially if you use the microwave to cook the rice (sacrilege, I know, but so fast and easy and foolproof and doesn't require dealing with cheesecloth and baskets and such). Soak the rice for 10 minutes, then cover with new water and place in a microwave safe dish, cover with a plate, and microwave on high for 3 minutes. Take the rice out, stir it around, then replace the plate and microwave again for 3 minutes. Repeat until rice is cooked, but shouldn't take more than 10 minutes or so, depending on the power of your microwave.

I used a regular bamboo steaming basket lined with a nonwoven steaming mat, as I could not find the conical South Asian steaming basket. Also used the glutinous rice which is necessary for the right texture... it worked out great. Served with Haagen Daz mango sorbet as a substitute and that was absolutely delicious. used less sugar than the recipe called for, which suited my taste perfectly.... I'm still nibbling on the leftovers several hours later.

This was good. I had some problems steaming the rice (note to self: buy rice cooker!), but the flavor was great! It is SO pretty on a plate! I made my rice into balls with a small cookie scoop. Served it with mango slices and really juicy raspberries. So good I'll be eating the leftovers for breakfast tomorrow!

I am now hooked on this!! I made it first a few days ago, and have now made it every day, as I got some fabulous ripe mangoes at a local indian market. I also found the sticky rice at the large asian market nearby. Yeah! I used just a sieve over a saucepan, as I didn't want to buy the traditional steaming basket and pot they had at the market(for far cheaper than I had found it online). It worked perfectly. I forgot to cover the pot the first time, and it took forever and the top layer of the rice didn't cook. The second time, I covered it, and it was perfect after just 20 minutes. I used brown sugar, as I couldn't seem to find palm sugar. Sticky rice is truly delicious! I will make this many times, and have shared it with a few friends so far, and they all want to learn! yummmmm.

This was very good, and easy! I didnt have cheesecloth, so I used a clean towel instead. It worked, but took twice as long, about 40 minutes. Next time I'll maybe add some cinnamon.

Yum! Just like the Thai place down the street. Use the really great smaller variety of mangoes.

So taisty! It was hard to find mangos, but the rice was still great!
