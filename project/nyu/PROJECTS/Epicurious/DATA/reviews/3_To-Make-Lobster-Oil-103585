This lobster oil is delicious. I've also added additional ingredients like carrots, onions, garlic, celery, little tomato paste, bay leaf, thyme. Very versatile recipe. The Cannery Restaurant in Vancouver BC serves its own lobster oil with balsamic for dipping bread. Use it in veggie dips, dressings etc. Check out this link for uses http://oliveciboulette.com/oil_recipes19 .html
