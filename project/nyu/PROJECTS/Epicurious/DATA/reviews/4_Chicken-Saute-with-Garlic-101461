Easy recipe for when you have that chicken in the fridge you need to cook, but aren't quite in the mood to do anything complicated. Remember to brown the chicken, so don't push it around in the pan. Let it sit and get fully browned before turning. Constant stirring will steam the chicken and you won't get a good pan juice in the end.

I can't believe no one has rated this dish. Garlic, butter, wine....how can you go wrong? I added a bit of crushed red pepper flakes. Delicious. What's wrong with you people? It's easy.
