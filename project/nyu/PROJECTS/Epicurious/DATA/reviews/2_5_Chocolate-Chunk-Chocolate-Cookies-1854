These were absolutely revolting!!! Mayonnaise in a cookie - worst idea EVER.

These were very rich, but too crumbly, and a bit too salty. Not very healthy either. I wanted something easy and fast, which is why I chose this recipe, but the results disappointed. I found a mayo that had vinegar and paprika, but no garlic, etc., so I figured I'd be ok (Dukes brand). My kitchen had a bad "cooked mayo" smell for a couple days after. My husband liked them and I tried to, but just couldn't get past the salty mayo taste and crumbly texture.

Mayo is basically oil and eggs, its not that strange and makes a great cookie

I'm typically a very experimental cook. But Mayo? In a cookie recipe?

I only wish I had read the reviews FIRST. These were disgusting and a waste of time and money.

I agree with the wise cook from Tasmainia Austrailia. Stay away from this one.

A fast, fun recipe. It's hard to keep people from eating the dough.

A very rich and delicious chocolate cookie...gotta have milk! One thing, though...make sure you use mayonnaise that doesn't have garlic and other spices in it - otherwise the cookies taste a little bit funny. You may have to search, but there are mayonnaise products without garlic!
