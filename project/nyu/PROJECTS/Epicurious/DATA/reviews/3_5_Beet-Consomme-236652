This soup was very tasty. I used golden beets rather than red and I have never seen such a wonderful colour of Consomme. This being said, the inital producet based on the recipe is not a true consomme, given that even with straining, the soup is very cloudy. To get a true consume I prepared a clarifying mix with ground turkey, carrots, onions and dill, the final product was a crystal clear golden beet consomme which I will make again.

This is definitely refined, the taste is quite wonderful. However it takes forever to prepare! Those who live in the Ottawa Canada region, you can get smoked turkey legs and wings at the Sausage Kitchen in the Byward Market.

This gave our Christmas Eve dinner a great balance. Not only was the color beautiful, but it was a light broth based soup that gave balance to a heavy meal.

I used a chinois instead of cheesecloth and instead of making their turkey broth, used as the base some smoked turkey stock I'd made from the Thanksgiving bird. The result was tunningly beautiful on my holiday table, and really great taste to boot.

This was just the perfect starter over the holidays. Not too heavy - and it went well with the suggested pirozhki.
