This is a wonderful recipe. Stick-to-your-ribs comfort food, high in fiber and free of processed carbohydrates. I use fresh garlic, and add red wine, rosemary, and oregano. When I don't have lemons, I use limes. You can use less lamb and more carrots and garbanzos for health and budget, or more meat for the carnivorous among us.

This was so delicious and so easy to make. I followed the recipe without any edits and it was really flavorful and hearty. Great meal for this cold September night.

This is a great basic recipe that you can modify to your culinary whims. I used 1# ground lamb, added all ingredients as written but thought it needed a little something. I added oregano and dill to taste. I also doubled the tomato sauce and chicken broth to 1 cup each. The spinach added at the end made for a colorful meal. I served the stew over quiona and topped with a little crumbled feta. Goes together fast with ground lamb.

Why do so many people think every soup or stew has to have a tomato base? Yuk. Leave it out!

I used a pound of lamb stew meat and two sections of lamb neck. Lots of bones for richness, but I didn't have to cut up a shoulder.

This was delish. I took the advice of one reviewer and added a tsp of cumin and ground coriander but also added slightly more than a tsp of nutmeg and cinnamon. I used half a large lemon which was probably the equal to 2 tblsp. I had some left over tomato sauce - one I made and one from a jar that I used and all was fine. served with couscous..I would definitely make this again.

I have been making this for years, without changing a thing, and guests never fail to rave about it and ask for the recipe. It's so simple, yet so tasty - a real keeper.

Loved this dish, but will make a few adjustments when I make it again. Two lbs lamb stew meat, 4 cloves of minced garlic, 1 c chicken broth, 2 c tomato sauce, 2 pkgs of spinach and touch more lemon juice. I served it with couscous. We are on a low fat, low calorie diet so I really skimmed the fat. This dish is worth splurging.

Skip the meat? Absurd. This is not a vegetarian recipe. The whole point of it is the lamb. It was very good, though - simple, easy, hearty, and delicious. I had leftover grilled leg of lamb to use up and this was a great way to do it. I followed the advice to use fresh garlic (just add 3-4 minced cloves when the onion is almost done), and I did use canned diced tomatoes (a full can) and I did double the chicken broth. Otherwise, proportions are not that important - I had about 2 pounds of precooked lamb. Skipped the carrots because I don't like them. It's wonderful over couscous - I used some of the broth dipped out of the stew pot to make the couscous. It's just fine as written without extra spices.

this stew never fails to please and it's quite simple to boot. also, I always seem to have better luck with lamb shoulder becomming super tender than I do with pork shoulder. I highly recommend this!

Excellent, but next time I will skip the meat (and possibly the carrots) and serve this as a tapa.

Taking heed of previous reviewers, I used fresh garlic, replaced the tomatoe sauce with diced tomatoes (a whole can - with chillis), and further upped the liquid with a whole cup of broth. I also added 1Tbs each of cumin seeds, ground coriander and cayenne pepper. Lastly I threw in a couple of handfuls each of rasins and toasted almonds with the spinach. The end result was delicious (if somewhat spicy) on day 1, and even more flavourful the next day. This is a simple, quick and adaptable recipe that tastes way more difficult and sophisticated than it is. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 4
Be sure to use minced fresh garlic (3-5 cloves) added to the pot with the onions and carrots, instead of the garlic powder. Also, add 1 t. coriander and 1 T. cumin to the pot with the garlic, onions and carrots to add great depth and delicious flavor to this dish.

Excellent flavor for how simple it is. I added saffron to the dish and I also added saffron to the rice while cooking. The only thing that I would change is maybe to add a little paprika for some spiciness. Would definitely make it again.

I love this recipe and get a hankering for it every fall when the weather gets cold and grey. The recipe is deceptively simple, but the lemon juice gives the seemingly disparate ingredients a real lift and freshness. I have never tinkered with the recipe, but reading the comments from other reviewers, perhaps I should!

Haven't made this in a while, but it has always been a family favorite. Was just looking over my recipe notes, and I DID see that I had recommended increasing the cooking liquid to: 3/4 cup chix broth and 3/4 cup tomato sauce. I saw that one of the reviewers did not feel there was enough liquid in the original recipe and would not make it again. That's a shame, because just adding that additional amount makes a world of difference and it really is a delicious recipe. That said, I'm off to the butcher to get my lamb stew meat!

Used coriander in the first step. The kitchen smelled wonderful. I loved this dish. Brings back memories of grandma's authentic cooking.

The lack of liquid makes it hard to cook the meat until it is tender. It lacks flavor and lamb with garbanzo beans also makes a heavy combination. Will not make again.

We loved this dish! I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and one 10 oz. box of frozen spinach instead of fresh, and it turned out wonderful. I also added a few cloves of fresh minced garlic and a chopped shallot to the onion, and about a teaspoon of finely grated lemon zest with the lemon juice. We served this over garlic couscous and it was just delicious. My husband rated this a definite keeper!

I have made this dish twice now, using lamb the first time and pork the second time. It's FANTASTIC both ways! I gave it 4 forks because it is so wonderful AND so SIMPLE! I can't wait to make this for friends. I highly recommend trying this recipe.

This dish was EXCELLENT! I read all the reviews before I decided to go for it. There was one single negative review from Scotland. I am also a lamb lover but love spice/herbs/flavour on my food. With his comments in mind. I added about 1-1 1/2 tsp of store-bought harissa (be careful if you do not like spice). 1 tblsp of curry and replaced 3 cloves of crushed garlic for the garlic powder. YUM!!! (all of this was used when browning the lamb on the olive oil). I also added more tomato sauce. After one hour + of slow cooking at lowest heat in the stove top. This dish was simply Delicious! My husband loved it. My 2 year old who is going through a vegetarian stage ate all the chickpeas, sauce, and the basmati rice I made with it. Thanks for such an EASY and tasty recipe!

Very good! Used suggestion to double sauce ingredients and found it was good advice. I marinated the lamb in olive oil, rosemary, garlic and lemon juice for 2 hours ahead before browning. I also added some cinnamon and a touch of red wine to add to flavors in the pot. Served with couscous w/quick preserved lemons and cilantro(Michael Chiarrello)for a great presentation.

I make this frequently, it's always a big hit. Like other reviewers, I always add extra liquid, extra garbanzo beans, actually extra almost everything, so that there are plenty of leftovers. Great with homemade hot crusty bread.

This was simply delicious. I followed other reviewers' advice and doubled the sauce ingredients and added garlic and cooking wine. At the last moment I threw some cilantro and chopped jalapenos in with the wilting spinach. (We like a little zip.) Lots of lemon juice was key. A perfect easy meal for a cold winter night.

This really deserves 5 forks. It was simple to prepare, yet tasted like a much more complex dish. (I added a dash of cinnamon.)It was even better the next day, and my 10 year old loved it so much she took it to school for lunch. We'll have this frequently!

I had leftover leg of lamb. I cooked this recipe in my crockpot. It was so easy and so good. I added some curry to the recipe.

We first had this at a dinner party hosted by a friend who loves gourmet cooking and I was surprised when I saw dinner bubbling in a crock pot rather than her usual elaborately coordinated menu. But served with plenty of extra lemon wedges on a bed of couscous, this stew is colorful, healthy, and unforgettably tasty. I've made this recipe again and again, usually with lamb but occasionally with beef (slightly milder flavor overall) when lamb is too expensive. I minimize work and maximize taste by putting all the ingredients except the spinach in a crockpot and simmering for 6-8 hours (I add the spinach and extra lemon juice 30 minutes before serving). Appearance is rustic rather than sophisticated, but the flavors are perfectly balanced and even better as leftovers (and I usually HATE leftovers). A definite keeper!

Loved it! Its is great to have a stew recipe that cooks in under 2 hrs. As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the sauce and broth. Smart advice. I used 1.25 lb of stew neck meat and it was just enough for 2 people -- so much of it was bone. Next time, I will make a LOT more meat, since this dish would make great leftovers.

I made this last week for my meat-loving husband. He had four servings that night and asked for it again the next day. What more can I say? I used fresh garlic, two onions, a can of chopped tomatoes and a whole can of broth (too lazy to measure). Outstanding, fresh, delicious. Don't forget the lemon wedges!

Lamb is my favourite meat. Yet this is so bland that, for the first time ever, I found the flavour of the lamb overpowering. Lots of herbs, spices or wine would, I'm sure, help to make this dish more worthwhile - but then that's another recipe... If you want a plainly cooked but tasty lamb dish, try Irish Stew instead - vastly superior!

I used beef instead of lamb and used a bit more spinach than the recipe called for. It was delicious! I'm glad I made extra to freeze. Note: if you use beef, you'll need to cook the stew for about 2 hrs. I didn't make any other adjustments -- I thought the amount of liquid was just right.

absolutely delicious blend of flavors... the lamb/chickpea/tomato combo produces an uncomparably wonderful flavor... easy to make... super healthy... only one pot to clean if you make in a dutch oven. my husband said "if you want to find a way to make me eat vegetables, this is it".

This was great! I never cooked lamb before, but was looking for a good stew on a cold night. The lamb was tender, and the flavors were wonderful. I served it with cous cous which was just the right complement. I'm not sure why everyone recommended adding extra liquid. I actually found it too liquidy and added a bit of flour to thicken the sauce (and I'm not one who usually likes thick gravy). My husband LOVED it. The leftovers didn't even last 24 hours. I plan to double the recipe next time. Definitely serve it with a lemon wedge. The added citus at the end really enhances the flavors.

It was surprising to me that a recipe with so few ingredients could taste so good. We loved it and will make it again. I agree with those cooks who doubled the amount of liquid. I used diced tomatoes (canned) and a heaping Tablespoon of tomato paste because I had no tomato sauce. It was great.

This is an exceptional recipe in so many ways: It's easy, flavorful, nutritious (what a great way to get my 4 year old to eat spinach!) and we eat every bite when we prepare it.

Good! The lamb was so tender. And the stew was quite colorful with the bright green spinach. I did not enter a fork rating because I did not follow the recipe precisely. Otherwise, I would have given it 3 forks the way I made it. I used the entire can of tomato sauce (somewhat less than 1c) and used all the remaining chicken broth I had (slightly less than 1.5c), partly because I wanted to finish them up and partly because I felt I did not have enough liquid in the pot for simmering. I also used 1.5 lbs of lamb shoulder chops with bones. Increasing the chicken broth and lamb was fine, but next time, I will stick to just 1/2c of tomato sauce. I also will increase the garlic powder. I thought the amount of spinach was just right.

Rating: 3
I thought this was simple and delicious. The butcher suggested lamb stew meat (leg) which was fine. I would suggest adding some garlic, and increasing the chicken broth and tomato sauce to 1 cup each for more flavor and liquid. I thought there was a little too much spinach so I decreased it to 3/4 of what the recipe called for.

Rating: 4
Fabulous taste, easiest and quickest stew I've ever heard of and a pretty, colorful presentation. All flavors were perfect and complemented each other just right. My butcher did not have shoulder cuts that day and gave me leg meat (less expensive, I think) instead and I can't imagine it could have been better the other way. My only advice - double the recipe. It reheats well and you'll want more!
