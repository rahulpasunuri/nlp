The ONLY taste in this dish is the sauce. It's very tart and over powers the taste of the meat and whatever else you are having with it. I decided to have a more expensive cut of meat and was disappointed. The dilemma is that the cheaper cut may be a little tough but its a waste to go to a more expensive meat. If you do decide to make this; two points you may wish to consider: prepare it for yourself before you have company and I find that the proper way to panfry a steak is not in butter but grilled on a dry, HOT, preferably cast iron frying pan.

This was good, and quite quick & easy to make. I will probably experiment some with the sauce until I find something we like a little better--maybe something a littler richer and 'smokier' tasting; I thought this sauce was too tart. Certainly, we will try this again.

Very good and very easy to make. The only change made was we added a 1/4 of bourbon and cuth the chili sauce by half. Otherwise made as recipie says to.

We loved this recipe! It was very easy to make and the sauce was excellent over the steaks.
