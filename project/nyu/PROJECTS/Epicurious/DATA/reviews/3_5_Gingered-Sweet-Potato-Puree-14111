Yum! I did not have butter but I used half-and-half. I added agave nectar and it really tastes sweet but not overly so - not like marshmellows. Highly recommend.

Simple and delicious, these were a big hit at dinner. I used more ginger but did saute it in the butter as recommended by other reviewers. I also added in a bit of orange zest and fresh juice.

wow. fabulous. sautteed the ginger in the butter like another reviewer said. I estimated all amounts and think i used too much butter. in this dish, a little goes a long way (and I never say that about butter!). also threw in some brown sugar, but didn't notice much flavor difference.

Easy and good, but I prefer to sautee the ginger root in the butter for five mins to mellow it.

Really yummy and great for a week night side dish.

I used three small white sweet potatoes and since I wasn't sure how that added up next to the called for 2 medium ones, added slightly more of everything--butter, ginger, and whole milk. A nice flavor and consistency--served it with the pork loin with onion marmalade on this site.

Although this was wonderfully easy, I thought there was too much ginger. If I were to make these again I'd probably add some brown sugar or something to make them more interesting.

First Thanksgiving that I didn't serve candied sweet potatoes and no one missed them. I pureed the potatoes, butter, ginger, and cream with a hand mixer which resulted in a very light rendition.

Very easy to make. I added more butter, and it definitely needs salt. Great as an easy side dish for a week-night. I had all the ingredients on hand, nice subtle taste of the ginger.

Lovely! I made this for Thanksgiving & it was a hit. If you like ginger, this one's for you. Tasty, not too tart. In a second batch, I added brown sugar, but it didn't seem to make a big difference.
