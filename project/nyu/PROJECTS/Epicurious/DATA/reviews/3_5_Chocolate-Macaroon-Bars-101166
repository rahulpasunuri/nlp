I wanted the coconut to be moister. Maybe I will try the crust, which I over baked, with the recipe for Magic cookie bars instead. I did like the crust, though. I have been looking for a shortbread recipe for a base for cheesecake.

I agree with others that the coconut needs more chewiness. Good flavor though.

I liked these. It's a very easy recipe; in fact, I think it would be a good one for children to try. It's also a good recipe for a party; that's why I made it.

These macaroon bars are ok. I would prefer the coconut topping to have a little more wow to them - maybe a little gooey-chewyness. I did add 1/2 tsp pure almond extract to the coconut topping and that really improved the flavor.

I've been making this since it first came out in 1999. Always a big hit. Easy and delicious. Makes a great gift, packs and travels well. Recipe is perfect, wouldn't change a thing.

I followed the suggestions of others by adding more coconut. I also cut the bars before cooling. It worked out great. Everyone I shared the cookies with loved them. I would say they are a keeper. In fact, I need to e-mail somone the recipe today, that's why I am here :-) plus to add my 10 cents.

Have to give this recipe 4 forks for being easy to make, simple ingredients and DELICIOUS!! Had no problem with the shortbread. The only change I made to the recipe was cooking the shortbread 15 minutes instead of 20.

Excellent bars! Chewy, and not as sweet as I was worried they would be. I used half milk chocolate and half semisweet chips. As written, the recipe wouldn't be too sweet at all, but still rich. Nice balance of coconut and chocolate. Might be good with pecans added. The crust does tend to fall off the bottom when you're eating them. They would be perfect with coffee! I made them for our neighbors as a thank-you for mowing our lawn for us, and they were very well received.

Next time I make these (and I will) I will cut the shortbread crust in half. I don't think I overcooked them but they were really hard to cut. Maybe I waited too long. I liked these even better the next day. Excellent flavor and easy to make.

The texture was near perfect. Would like it a bit chewier, but the flavor worked out well. Not as sweet as I thought it would be so it was a nice surprise.

This recipe was delicious! I'd definitely make it again. I made it for a function at work, and people raved about it. The shortbread was a little crumbly, and I had to use a very sharp knife to cut the bars. I also had a hard time spreading the coconut mixture over the shortbread base prior to baking it. The coconut mixture seemed a little hard when the cookies cooled and I prepared to cut them, but that wasn't a problem. The cookies were delicious. The recipe for the shortbread base has other recipes for bar cookies, and I'm eager to try them, too.

This is a really good treat. It is easy to make and the whole family loved it. I did not find it dry at all. Just be careful not to overcook it. If you don't like a lot of sugar, I suggest that a little less won't hurt.

These macaroons were o.k, but nothing to brag about. I would not make them again.

After all the great reviews, I expected to be "wow"ed. I wasn't impressed. I found it rather dry-perhaps it baked too long. However, I wasn't thrilled with the flavor combo. I love shortbreat, love chocolate, love macaroons...I don't think I love them together. I think I'll stick to the lemon bars-they're wonderful!

This recipe is just yummy. Next time I will use only half a recipe for the shortbread base.

Gosh, I really loved these, and they were so easy to make. I've made the blueberry cheesecake and the lemon bars too, and all have been a success. Next time I make these I'm going to try adding pecans as a previous reviewer did - that sounds heavenly. These are very sweet, but just wonderful.

Wow. These were SO good and SO easy to make. They are very rich, though, so be sure you cut the bars small.

Delicious! I thought it might be fun to add 1/3 cup white chocolate chips and 1/3 cut chopped pecans to the coconut mixture. My guests loved them!

I cook professionally for several families and they loved this recipe and the Lemon Bars. These are easy enough to teach children to bake.

I thought they were a little dry but everyone else who ate them raved. I baked them in a glass dish and probably need to reduce the oven temp by 25 degrees.

Delicious!!!!
