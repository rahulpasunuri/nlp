I have made this a lot and it continues to be one of my go-to vegetarian dips/spreads for parties. The flavor does intensify over time, so if you are planning ahead it is best to give it a couple of days in the fridge to really develop before serving. And yes, it is a lot of work. But every time I make it people ask for the recipe and I eat the leftovers for dinner for days!

I thought this was terrific. Yes, it's a ton of work but mine came out a gorgeous orangy red color and the flavor intensified over time (i.e., after several days). I've had several people ask for the recipe. Straining it thro a sieve to get rid of the skins is a pain, but worth it. I skipped the terrine part and just put it in a ceramic bowl to be used as a spread. Have already made it 2 more times. Love it.

I found this rather bland, especially given the amount of work it required (and the mess it made in my kitchen when I put the mixture through the sieve!). Increasing the spices might help, but I'll choose a different recipe next time. (And the color was odd - kind of orange, almost like velveeta, instead of brownish like in the picture).

Sorry, but I didn't like this and neither did my guests. I was a LOT of work for something that was kind of weird. I won't be making it again.

Make this. But if you are a cook who bases success on the relation between time spent and praise received, make sure to make it for a big crowd, because it's a time consumer. But I can't really imagine that any vegetarian pate would be better than this one. And it officialy receives the Greater Than The Sum Of Its Parts award. Silky, complex, and flavorful.

Mild and pleasant flavoured. Would have given it only 2 forks because it didn't seem fantastic, but my guests kept coming back for more. Used leftovers as a spread for sandwiches. Scraping out the lentil skins was the hardest part but made for a silky terrine. Will try leaving them in for a more "country pate" next time. For the reviewer using gelatine- I thought the instructions for replacing agar were weird too, but it worked.

I made this as a spread, without agar, for a party and everybody loved it.

If gelatine is used, shouldn't it be added after the 40 minutes cokking time?
