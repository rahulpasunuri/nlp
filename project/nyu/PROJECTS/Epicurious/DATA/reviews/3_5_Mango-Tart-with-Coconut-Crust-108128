I really enjoyed it. The second time I made it, I had some late RSVPs and had to make a 2nd tart last minute. I put the folded combo in the freezer right away. I was then able to put the mixture in the cooled crust, cool it and serve it in just a very few hours. It worked wll without the prescribe amount of set up. I agree that the toasted coconut and lots of lime zest really makes a difference.

Just a note: I made the filling and used it between cake layers. It set up quite stiff with about 1.5 teaspoons of gelatin. If I were making it for a tart filling I would probably use the listed 1 teaspoon. Also, I believe that gelatin breaks down if you heat it too hot, so it's best to only heat the puree + gelatin mixture until the gelatin is dissolved.

Followed recipe exactly - and was mildly disappointed. The crust was fantastic! But the mango "custard",(which set perfectly with 2 teaspoons of gelatin) was a bit bland tasting, something a few other reviewers have pointed out as well. I also didn't care for the texture of the "custard" which appeared more jello-like rather than creamy. So I tried again, this time folding 1 cup of lime-infused pastry cream into 2 cups of the mango puree - and the result was absolutely delicious: a wonderfully creamy texture and a delicious balance of fruity sweetness from the mango and refreshing tartness from the hint of lime. As others have suggested, I topped the tart with both lime zest and toasted coconut flakes - and skipped the mango chunks all-together. To infuse my pastry cream with hint of lime, I combined the called-for sugar and zest from a lime in a food processor and pulsed until the zest was finely minced and almost ground into the sugar. Then proceeded with the standard recipe for making pastry cream. It yields a pastry cream that has just the right subtle nuance of lime flavor without it being too domineering.

Oh- I also used 1/2 C almond flour and 1/4 C gluten-free AP flour, so my gluten-free spouse could eat it too.

This was delicious. Even my picky kids ate it up. I used other reviewers suggestions and doubled the amount of gelatin (2 tsp), and topped it with lime zest and toasted coconut. I used unsweetened coconut and it was fine. I also found (in making this 3x) that I needed to make the bottom crust thin or it was tough to break off a piece when eating. I will make this again and again...

I absolutely love this recipe. It was delicious! I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions to put some toasted coconut and lime zest on top, and that really pulled the dessert together - especially the lime. I also doubled the amount of gelatin, for fear of the tart being runny. This worked perfectly. My only qualm was that 10 minutes of toasting burnt the coconut - so I had to re-try 2 times. I made a sauce with blackberries as an accompaniment, and it worked quite well accompaniment

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. It was smooth, creamy, mango deliciousness! I did not put any toasted coconut or lime zest on top, due to picky children who might not eat it with that on top, but I think adding those things would look and taste divine. I made two of these, since they're not very big and I had a large party. I didn't want my filling to be runny so I doubled the gelatin as suggested. That worked very well, and the filling was just the right consistency. Due to wheat allergies I altered the crust somewhat. I used ground pecans instead of flour and it was incredibly good. So I suggest looking for a pecan crust to really make this dessert special. I am going to make this again soon.

I made this for Mother's Day. Of the 5 of us, I was the only one who didn't really like the recipe. It tasted to me like something was missing. I followed other reviewers advice to add toasted coconut to the top and that did make it look prettier. I like mangos but feel you need to LOVE mangos to really enjoy this dish. I followed the recipe exactly and found the filling to be only slightly loose as in the consistancy of a rich pudding especially when left out for a little while. My family wants me to make this again but it is time consuming and, to me, not really worth the effort.

I made this tart sometime ago and although I never got to try it, the reviews were AMAZING!!! I sort of burned the coconut when I toasted it, but all in all, it is a great recipe and would recommend it to anyone!!! :)

Delishious! Really! It's the first recipe I tried of this site and I really liked and the people who I shared it with all thought the same. Too bad that the mango's in Belgium are more yellow than orange, the colour on the picture is really amazing! One thing I had a litlle problem with was that the filling wasn't stiff enough, it was rather runny. But I tried it again and I hear it calling my name in the fridge...

I've tried a few mango tart recipes. This is the best tasting and best looking one. This is the only version I now make - having made it now 4 times. Other recipes have left me with watery mango filling. This one is more of a creamier consistency - like a great keylime pie. I've followed the advice of other reviewers - using some lime and coconut on top for a hint of aroma - I agree with them, do it. My only recommendation is to make 2 at the same time.

A very light and refreshing dessert. Like another reviewer, I used 2 teaspoons of gelatin - but for the 9-inch tart. I also added a generous splash of creme de cassis to brighten the flavor. Everyone loved it.

I have made this many times and each time have received rave reviews. I have substituted coconut cream for the dairy and it was just as good ( for the lactose intolerant).

a delicious and surprising light dessert tart. The crust is easy to make and while the mango filling requires a little work, the results are well worth the effort. I added a handful of flaked coconut and some lime zest to the topping for color and a little extra pop, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. I'll definitely be making this again.

Made this also for a diner party. But I didn't think it turned out really well. The taste was amazing but I also found, as some previous users mentioned, that it was somewhat runny.

As I was making this dish I was thinking that it had better turn out!!!! It was a lot of steps to go through for a bum dessert. Like another poster stated, it was worth it! I made it for a birthday party for my mom and she loved it. The dessert got devoured and several people asked for the recipe. Ripe mangos are a must...when they are on sale for a great price and you buy a lot of them this is the recipe to use them in. They are not kidding in the prep time, it takes a long time to make but it is well worth it. I made it as directed and would not change a thing. It was delicious, perfect for summer.

This makes a lovely, quite light dessert made with perfectly ripe mangoes from the Indian grocery. The crust was absolutely wonderful, made with unsweetened organic coconut, toasted in the oven. I was using a 10" tart pan, so I increased the crust recipe a bit and used a heavy hand on the filling ingredients. Used a scant two teaspoons of gelatin and with the extra cream and mango, it held together perfectly. You definitely need to chill the filling over ice and the finished tart in the fridge overnight to ensure that it sets up well. And keep it chilled until serving time, or it will melt.

As I was making this, I swore I'd never make it again because it seemed like a ridiculous number of steps for a simple fruit tart. When my family tasted it, however, it all became worthwhile. I would do it all over again and not change a single thing. The crust was delicious, the filling was perfect - intense mango flavor, not too sweet... OUTSTANDING!!!

i found the mango filling was wonderful. it was silky smooth and cool on the pallate. the coconut crust however, seemed too buttery and bland. i would suggest using graham crumbs instead of flour when making the crust, to absorb more of the butter and provide flavour.

This recipe probably has potential - but whatever you do - DO NOT use two envelopes of gelatin. The general consensus seemed to be that recipe as written produced a too-runny filling. I followed one reviewer's advice to use two envelopes, and yuck, what a disgusting taste and texture. Still, the crust is good, and I love mangoes, so I'd be willing to try again. Would one full envelope (1 tbs) work, or maybe two teaspoons? I can't help but think that the filling would be better if one made a regular cooked custard and then folded the mango puree into that. Has anyone tried that?

Absolutely delicious. The filling was subtle and not too sweet and the crust was rich and flavorful -- a terrific counterpoint to the filling.

Good recipe but chill for 8 hours???? I froze it for 2 hours instead. Good even without the mangos on top.

This was pretty involved, but the result was special. The coconut crust was an excellent counter point to the smooth, creamy filling. I used a regular tart pan, which didn't hurt the taste, but did make the presentation more iffy. This is a special occasion dish, when mangos are abundant.

Definitely raves over this recipe. As mentioned by others, use 2 packets of unflavored gelatine to get the right filling consistency. Additionally, I would recommend replacing a 1/4 C of the flour in the crust with ground up macadamia nuts to add a more tropical flavor.

My gourmet group loved this mango tart and all gave it a thumbs up. However, I had the same problem as Marisa did with the filling not setting up as firmly as it should have. I question if the one teaspoon of unflavored gelatin should be 1 tablespoon based on comparable recipes.

The coconut crust was pleasant, and the mango filling had a lovely flavour, but it didn't set enough, so that when the tart was sliced, the insides ran out. I had leftover filling that i put in phyllo baskets layered with coconut and cinnamon.

I did this recipe exactly as written. This tart is the BEST!! This is a very european style of pastry. It tastes like fruit and not like sugar. I also love the crust. If you love very sweet pastries ....this is not for you. Will do this again for sure.

Not bad. I had really ripe tasty mangoes and this pie did taste like a great big mango. I had trouble with the crust. It baked up sort of flavorless. So I threw it away, made a grahm craker crust and added more toasted coconut Into the filling. Fresh and light I probably will make it again though because I know so many people who are dieting and it fits the bill for that purpose.

I made this for a rather discerning group and they loved it! The flavors are subtle and the mangos need to be quite flavorful. I would experiment with the crust next time, perhaps add chopped macadamia nuts.

LOVED the crust but found the mango filling insipid--maybe the mangoes available to me are not as flavorful as others. I kept waiting for the flavor burst and was disappointed. I liked the texture of the filling but found it lacking in flavor

Anybody have a mango pie recipe with a spiced filling more similar to pumpkin pie? Been looking for a recipe since I had a version in Bali four years ago, have heard of something similar served to tourists in Guatemala as well. Thanks!

As soon as my magazine arrived, I knew I had to make this tart! It turned out to be the perfect ending to my Easter meal. Pretty, fresh and not too sweet, I served it with vanilla ice cream sprinkled with more toasted coconut. The coconut crust was so good, I intend to experiment with other fillings such as the lime custard tart from the Best of Gourmet 2003 cookbook.
