This is a great twist on the traditional bruschetta, but I would only recommend it for those who enjoy strong flavors. Despite Mario's disapproval, I ended up having to use the canned variety of anchovies, and found that they worked fine. However, I'm guessing he meant 2 TEASPOONs of freshly ground black pepper, not 2 tablespoons! It was way too peppery; I'd definitely make it again but with half his pepper amount. Also had a ton of the cheese mixture left over. Buy two baguettes.

Great make-a-head recipe. Wonderful to have on hand to serve hungry guests while preparing the main course sea food. Variation ! Try spreading a thin layer of concentrated tubed tomato paste on the bread before assembling. Enjoy !
