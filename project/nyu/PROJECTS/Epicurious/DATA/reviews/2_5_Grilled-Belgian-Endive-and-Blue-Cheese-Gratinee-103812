I followed the suggestion of cutting the endives in two and grilling them a bit longer. The smoothness of the leftover Gorgonzola I used created a nice contrast with the crispness and bitterness of the endive. I would suggest to go easy on the balsamic though, half as much would do just fine. And yes, the color is well...the color of cooked endive, nothing unsightly and it does remain crisp...as it should.

I did not slice the endive in five but in two and took some big ones. The temperature must be right to keep the endive moist and grilled at the same time. Also put more cheese than the recipe calls for. My husbad loved it and so did my friends!

Gratinee? Hardly. This recipe just doesn't come together, physically or in taste. The grilled endive takes on an odd color, the tops are overcooked while the bottoms are undercooked, there is a very large core that guests must cut around, the cheese melts off rather than in, and the oil and vinegar serve little purpose. So, while I liked the ingredients, the individual flavors, and the simplicity, I'd have to say this is a one-half fork dish.

The endive was too soft to hold up the gratinee; it made a big mess. Although the flavor was good, it was too much trouble to make this dish with not enough reward.
