Really enjoyed this recipe. The spices are really nice, although the mix makes quite a bit (I adjust for the size of the brisket, mine is usually 2 lbs). I cook it low and slow, around 300 in the oven until it's almost falling apart. I throw the onion in with the brisket at the beginning, like a pot roast. Very flavorful!
