Overall, an interesting combination of ingredients. The dish was well received by all, including the teens, on a mid-winter evening. I agree with other posts that recommend reducing the amount of olive oil.

I made recipe per directions...came out good...I did not like, a little too sweet for my taste for lamb...my friend and sister liked it...I will have to try another recipe next time...good though if you like sweet...

The ingredients on this recipe are innovative and fresh, and I was really excited to make it. Overall, though, I was really disappointed because the sauce is much more fatty than I expected, making the dish very rich. If I were to make it again, I wouldn't use shoulder meat -- just too much fat. I also would omit the olive oil, since it's really not necessary, and again, made the sauce too oily for my taste.

Great comfort food - yet sophisticated at the same time. Made this for friends over the holidays and it was a great hit with everyone! Didn't add the red peppers - just forgot and improvised with the chili powders too. This very simple recipe was cost effective and simply delicious - plate licking good.

An excellent and easy meal. I made the meat the day before and took the fat off when cold. I did use only the chilly powder, not much, just a tiny kick as my guests were unknown. Great. I served Roasted pineapple and Cardamom Orange cream for dessert.

I tried this recipe because of the member reviews. I was not disappointed...neither was my fiance. The entire house was filled with the mouth-watering aroma of this delicious Autumn stew. We liked it so much we decided to serve it for our big family Christmas Eve dinner. I used a fresh ancho chili and it tasted fine. I also thickened the broth with corn starch and then served the entire stew over jasmine rice. We paired the meal with fresh cut bartlett pears and blue cheese, a small spinach salad, warm crusty bread and some red wine. Delicious, satisfying, and hearty...not to mention nutritious! Who needs Julia Child?

It's my first time making lamb stew so I was happy to find this recipe.. After reading the reviews, I decided to add a few items to absorb the broth and I also substituted a few items to help balance out the sweetness. To begin, I braised the lamb in a cast iron skillet with a little olive oil to tenderize the meat. Then placed the lamb in a large, heavy pot to stew with the spices on low simmer for approx. 45 min before adding the carrots and potatoes. Letting the meat and root/tuber veggies simmer for approx. 15-20 min before adding the mushrooms, olives, roasted red bell peppers and apricots which took another 15- 20 min approx. Additional items: * 2 shallots, grated * double the garlic * 1/4 tsp more chili, cumin, cinnamon * 1/2 pd more lamb * 1 more carrot * 4-5 new potatoes, halved * 2 cups baby portabella mushrooms, halved (toward last 15-20 mins of cooking) * 2 cups whole black olives (also toward last 15-20 mins) * 1 tbl each of fresh rosemary, parsley and mint (toward last 5-10 min). Substitutions: * 1 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes instead of ancho chili * 3 sweet potatoes, quartered instead of butternut squash. Enjoy!

Surprisingly good recipe. I adapted it to left over leg of lamb (see other reviews with same idea). I used California chili powder and no ancho. I adjusted other spices to taste, as should anyone. This recipe is no hassle, if you concentrate on prepping all ingedients quickly at the start, as would any serious cook. After that, I used common sense, had fun and went to work. I added a roux to thicken the pot, since I already had cooked meat and didn't need to overcook everything to death. Made it quicker and easier anyway, than cooking to reduction. Also I didn't use cilantro and diced the apricots fine.

Easy dish after the prep work of chopping meat and veggies. I also added cornstarch as described below to thicken the somewhat watery stew with good results. I didn't add roasted peppers (too lazy to roast them ) and did not miss them. The butternut squash was mushy but I felt it helped thicken the sauce so I liked that.Great dish for a cold night.

Great recipe! I roasted the "bell" part of the butternut squash in the shell and served the stew in that. Very pretty and festive for a rainy fall evening in front of a fire.

This was really a terrific recipe though not as "simple" as the heading suggests; a lot of prep time, but well worth the effort. I used only a Tbs or 2 of oil, browned the meat for a few minutes with the seasoning (added about 1/2 tsp more of each), then added all the remaining vegetables (cut slightly larger). I cooked it for the full hour but, as others have said, there was slightly more liquid than I would have liked. It was easily remedied by spooning out about a 1/4 cup of the liquid, whisking in a bit of cornstarch, then re-adding it to the pot & letting it boil for a minute or two. Next time I'll add the carrots & onions per the recipe's suggestion, but will add the butternut squash 15-20 minutes later to avoid the squashy squash problem. I also used about 3/4 C. of dried apricot halves. Served over couscous w/ salad & good bread. It was really delicious!

Geat recipe, easy to prepare and amazingly quick. I used leg of lamb instead of shoulder. Rave reviews!

This dish rocks! Enjoyed it very much, but I did double the spices and I added garbanzo beans. Lovely mix of flavors.

I made this lamb stew for a dinner party and it was a hit. My husband was so proud. Lovely stew. Beatiful colors, interesting fantastic flavor. You must be careful not to overcook the veggies, especially the butternut squash, which can get soggy. The chili pepper gives this recipe the slightest kick, but don't use to much. Loved the orange zest and dried apricot flavors. Also, don't forget the fresh cilantro at the end. Makes it looks so pretty with all the bright colors. Serve with a nice bread. You'll love it.

Great stew; used raw cubed sweet potato in lieu of squash plus some small new potatoes, and added a few star anise. For those concerned about mushy veggies; I tend to add them at the final 2/3 of cooking time so as not to get mushy. Also added small dried chipolte for some kick.

I've made this twice now and it is so rich and satisfying. Substitute wherever you need to--different squash, raisins instead of apricots, with or without ancho chili. Fresh lamb absorbs more flavor, but also a great use for leftover leg of lamb.

I made this once with 1/2 of a 4 lb leg of lamb and froze the rest. I made it again, this time making the chunks of butternut squash and carrot larger to prevent mushiness. Used cayenne for a little more umph. Great keeper of a dish. Over basmati is best. Rave reviews.

I made this with leftover roasted leg of lamb and it was incredible. I changed it around a bit - I cubed the roasted lamb, (probably used 4 pounds) and added more of each spice to accomodate the larger portion of lamb. After bringing it to a boil, I put in the oven in a covered clay crock and roasted it for 2 hours at 325. I did not add the red pepper, and left in the orange peel and the ancho chili (which I had hydrated and chopped very fine). Wow - the flavors are delicious together. Served over basmati rice and everyone LOVED it.

This recipe has made it to my book. Prep was easy. Used leg of lamb i/o shoulder - more tender and meaty. Veggies came out great - tasty, spicy, sweet, so much going on. Cilantro is a must -- I used cayenne instead of ancho chile. Orange rinds really made the dish. Easy, tasty, and not very time-consuming. LOVED THE SQUASH.

This is a delicious stew but be forwarned, it is not as easy as the heading suggests. There is quite a bit of prep work needed before the cooking begins such as cubing the lamb and squash, mincing the onion and garlic and slicing carrot and preparing the roasted peppers.. If you have a sous chef sitting around idly put him to work getting everything prepped. And then enjoy one delicious and aromatic stew. Yummy!

I doubled the amount of the spices and I slightly browned the meat. It reduces the fat amount from the meat. Also, didn't add nearly the amount of olive oil. Farm raised lamb is much fatter than the mass produced lamb available in stores.

This was a great dish for a Minnesota winter evening. It was easy to get it all in the pot before our guests arrived so we spend the evening chatting by the fire. I used a canned chipotle pepper instead of the dried ancho chile and it worked just fine.

Liked the result but was wary of Rochester's complaint of it being too liquid, so went one of the 30 minute segments with the lid entirely off and cooked it for an additional 30 minutes. I don't think there's much you can do about mushy vegetables with a stew though.

As with many of the meat recipes from the Lukins books, there are creative aspects, primarliy things that add a certain sweetness. I thought this recipe was just okay - was wishing for something to cut the sweet flavors, like maybe black olives or red wine. Also thought too much liquid - veggies got mushy pretty fast. But with some elaboration it might be very good.

this was awesome. add more cilantro- it was a great touch. it's easy to make (a bit time consuming to prepare, but it's good for casual guests since once it's on, there's not much to do). very very tasty- each ingredient added a unique slant to the dish.
