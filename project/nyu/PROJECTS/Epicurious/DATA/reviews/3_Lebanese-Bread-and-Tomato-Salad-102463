Being Lebanese and growing up on Fattoush salad I can just look at this and say it isn't so! I have not tried this but I can honestly say that you might call this a tomato and bread salad, but do not call it Fattoush salad! Although traditional Fattoush salad does have purslane (a lot of it) but it's really difficult to find purslane in the US, I have found it at some Latin markets in the summer, it is a weed that is edible like dandelion but the tastes are not the same. Fattoush does not have Pomegranate molasses in it. It usually consists of parsley, mint, tomatoes, cucumbers, purslane, romaine lettuce (optional) and crispy pita that serves as a crouton and that is added right before tossing the salad. The dressing is mashed garlic with salt, extra virgin olive oil, lemon juice and sumac which is typical of Fattoush salad!

I like Middle Eastern food but I never want to make this again. This does not taste authentic and prepared with the good and carefull hands of a Lebanese cook. I really don't recommend this recipe...it tastes like alfalfa sprouts stuck in mud!

Being of a Lebanese-ish background (Armenian, actually) fattoush is a common part of my holiday diet. Generally, you can add mint parsley or romaine lettuce to the salad to give it greener colour. Sumac powder can also be used to season it, with a lemon & oil dressing, if you have any; the pita bread would also be crumbled into pieces (substantial pieces, not teensy bits) and added at the last moment to preserve crunchiness. Cucumbers would also be a nice addition to this recipe.

Mt grandmother was Lebanese and made tomato bread salad ... this recipe is nothing like hers.........this recipe looks like someone was left alone with the remote control and no idea how to change it off the food channel.

OK - I am a professional chef and live in a "big city" - Chicago - and it would be somewhat difficult for me to find pomegranate molasses. Additionally, I don't recall seeing purslane at my local stores, which may explain why nobody has reviewed this recipe - probably no one made it!
