I knew something was off about the ingredients, and I should have went with my gut. Soy and miso do not belong here. I added a little soy to test and it brought the taste and fragrance down. Use sea salt instead of soy sauce and omit the miso! I got plenty of flavor from the spices, and I used fresh lemongrass. Also used a whole can of coconut milk and made the rice separate.

I really appreciated the other reviews. I browned the chicken in the pot and then added the coconut milk and aromatics. I used one cup of white jasmine rice, one cup water, and a whole can of coconut milk. It came out a bit soft (probably could have used 1.25 or 1.5 cups of rice), but fragrant and delicious. Total comfort food.

i'm glad i read the other reviews first. that being said i made the rice separate from the chicken, i basically made a sauce with all the same ingredients but i used the whole can of coconut milk. it came out delicious but as posted i can't see how this recipe would really work. i might make it again but i would brown the chicken and just simmer the sauce then serve it all together with the rice. i missed that they meant cilantro as well but i just boiled some coriander seeds in the dressing and it came out ok. probably wouldn't make this cucumber salad again.

I am still waiting to find a recipe that is as good as our favorite Thai restaurant. I was very disappointed with this recipe except that the cucumber relish was wonderful. Otherwise I felt the dish was very dry and mild so added extra water, then extra coconut milk and then threw in a bottle of Korma sauce from Trader Joes at the end of cooking. I will not make this again but I am still on the quest for Tahi curry dishes.

Like most previous reviewers, I found some serious flaws with this recipe and would actually advise AGAINST making it - although the flavors are wonderful, you risk spending an evening preparing something that might not turn out right and take much longer than anticipated. I'm echoing other people's sentiments, but as a person who uses epicurious all the time, and relies heavily on and appreciates the reviews, it seems important to add my opinion because most importantly, this recipe can really ruin your night. The ingredients are captivated: ginger, honey, vinegar, miso, curry, cilantro - it sounds amazing and it smells incredible throughout the process. However there are two main problems: (as a side note, I try to duplicate a recipe exactly the first time - no changes to the instructions) 1. Browning the chicken: If your pan isn't teflon (and why would a casserole dish be teflon?) it could end up as black as teflon after you try to brown chicken on high heat using only a 1/4 cup of coconut milk. 2. 2+ cups of rice + 1 cup of water = going back and adding water for an additional hour each time the previous amount evaporates before the rice actually cooks. The end result took over 1:30, and it was OK - like it could have been special. But at that point it's impossible to tell how it should have tasted. I'm sorry, I really hopes this recipe works for everyone else and it's just me. But I just can't see how this recipe passed muster and am a little annoyed by it. And not for nothing, but not everyone has a scale in the kitchen. There, I said it! Happy Cooking!

I thought the dish was a bit too salty - I would definitely add less (or no) soy sauce next time. Various elements of the recipe gave me pause: 10.5 oz of rice is nearly 2 C, yet it calls for only 1 C (or 9 oz?) of water, which wasn't nearly enough. I'm not familiar with brown jasmine rice; perhaps that cooks faster than the brown rice I used, which took much longer than 30 minutes to cook. The cucumber relish was very tasty and needed to break up the homogeneous flavor of the main dish; I used two cukes and halved the sauce, and it turned out quite well. I usually think of coriander as the spice, but they mean the leaf here, right (cilantro)? I also wish there had been some suggestions for the chile peppers - I used serrano - was the recipe referring to the little Thai red peppers? Lastly, I used Indian curry powder (which already included cardamom) - is there a Thai version? Again, I just wish there were a bit more specificity in some of the ingredients.

the flavor in this was wonderful! i too halved the honey and vinegar, but i would cook it less next time. other changes for next time would be to brown the chicken in the pan first, as to avoid the sticky brown mess at the bottom of the pan from the coconut milk. i might also add a touch more water to the rice. despite wanting to make these changes, the dish was really delicious, will give us leftovers for tomorrow and is a total keeper!

This is a lovely comfort-food dish. The flavors are delectable both to smell while cooking and to taste while eating. I omitted the miso and cardamom as I did not have them, but I did not feel like anything was missing in the final product. The rice at the bottom of the pan got a little brown, so next time I will use more liquid, lower heat, or both. The cucumber relish is a must, and based on the previous reviewers comment, I used only 1/2 cup each of vinegar and honey, and it was plenty. Highly recommended!

A delicious, fragrant dish. Absolutely loved it. Just one quibble: The cucumber relish that I made turned out a little soupy (too much liquid), so next time I'll try halving the amounts of honey and rice vinegar.
