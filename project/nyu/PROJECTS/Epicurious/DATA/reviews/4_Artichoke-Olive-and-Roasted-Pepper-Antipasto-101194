Made this for a New Year's Eve dinner party. Guests loved it and went back for seconds and thirds. I stuck exactly to the recipe. Easy to prepare. I recommend roasting the peppers and not using store bought.

I halved the recipe. I added more garlic and fresh basil and served it with crostini. Today I am putting the leftovers on pizza. It's delicious.

This is the best antipasto I have ever had. I added the feta suggested by others and it really added a lot to it. My husband raved about it and he hates peppers. I plan on making it again and again.

Superb. Intended to eat this the day it was made, but plans changed and we didn't get to it for 2 days. The flavors blended together and mellowed. Best antipasto we ever made. Don't forget the Italian bread to dip into the juices.

I prepared this antipasto just as the recipe appears here, and it was wonderful! I took it to a party, and everyone wanted the recipe. The colors made for a lovely presentation in an attractive serving dish, as well. It was really good the next day as leftovers, too:)

We used Cilantro instead of Flat Leaf Parsley and it was delicious. Served on toasted rounds they made great bruschetta and the next morning with asiago cheese: amazing omelettes!

This was a little too messy to eat for a good company dish, but it was delicious.

It's quick and easy and a definite crowd pleaser. I serve it with cheese (a sharp provolone)and ciabatta bread. It's the most frequently requested antipasto by my in-laws.

This was easy and fabulous!!! I made it as an appetizer for a dinner party of foodies and they all loved it. It would be great toss with pasta as well - perhaps w/a little crumbled feta. Bravo!!!

A very nice addition to a buffet - I made the dish the night before and served it at room temp. I also added crumbled Feta cheese - delicious!!

I found the recipie to be delightful for the first few bites, but is definitely an appetizer, and not to be enjoyed in meal-form. My roommate, however, ate the majority of the antipasta, and thought it was simply grand. try it for yourself i guess.

Make this a day or two ahead of time so that the flavors can fully develop. It didn't look as pretty as I thought it would when all of the colorful ingredients were added, the black olives dulled the color of the vibrant peppers and parsley. The leftovers make a great vegetarian sandwich filling, pill a french roll with this anitpasto, melt provolone cheese on top. ohsogood.

This went really well at a wine and cheese I had with some friends. They ate it up and asked all about it. Very easy to do and well worth it!

Added balsamic vinagrette to add a little more 'guilt free' flavor. Added more garlic too. Took it to a party, everyone raved!

After I made this dish I kept thinking that it needed a dressing with it but after I tasted the dish I was astonished at how delightful all of the flavors were together. It was light and a great alternative for a salad. Everyone at the dinner party commented how good it was.

Great! I made this as an appetizer, to go with slices of Italian bread. It was wonderful that way. Since there was some left over, I cooked some linguine and tossed some of this antipasto with the linguine. Fresh ground pepper and shaves of parmesan over top. REALLY good! Best at room temperature. Keeps well. Beautiful. This recipe will be with me for a long time!

I can't wait to make this again. I will try it with store bought roasted peppers next time though since roasting and peeling the peppers was messy and time consuming.

My mother spent all day making a mushroom lasagna and whipped this up at the end. She was disappointed that this simple recipe was the hit of the evening. I liked it so much that I made it the next night to rave reviews at my own home. Delicious!
