This is the first time I have ever tried chard and was pleased with the taste. I thought it would be bitter. I loved the raisins and olives together. I think perhaps a touch of vinegar will be added the next time I make this dish. I used the bright lights chard which made the dish very attractive.

I love chard, and I like salty and sweet together, so the raisins and olives were great. I added a little white wine and seasoned rice vinegar--maybe that balanced the sweetness. Also, I didn't bother to chop the raisins.

After reading mhbartel's review, I decided to skip the raisins and add some freshly ground black pepper. We enjoyed it.

I used a mix of green and red chard. The raisins were way too sweet for this. They made it taste almost sickly sweet.
