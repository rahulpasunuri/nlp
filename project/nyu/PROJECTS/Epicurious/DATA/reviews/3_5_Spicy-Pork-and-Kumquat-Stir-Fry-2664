Couldn't find kumquats so subbed sugar snap peas, and it was still great. Didn't have oyster sauce so added some soy, left out the sugar (will use when I actually make with kumquats, though), and next time will cut the pork more into cubes than strips so they stay more moist and tender. Four forks for ease, quickness, and big flavor!

I would make this again, but with a few modifications. I wasn't thrilled with the texture of the pork, so might make it with a different cut. I also thought the kumquats could have cooked down a little longer in order to lose a little more of their sourness. I think this would be really nice with some greens added to it as well.

I get annoyed at people who substitute willy-nilly in a recipe and then "rate" it. What gives with that? You haven't MADE the recipe, so you can't really RATE it, can you? In this case, I followed this recipe to the letter, and it is an exceptional recipe. We all loved, loved, loved it. The kumquats add a zippy zing, the sauce rocks, and the pork is perfectly done. Bon Appetit recipes can sometimes disappoint, but not this one. It's a keeper.

I was given kumquats from my friends tree and then found this unique recipe. Don't make this without kumquats. This is what sweet and sour SHOULD taste like. Top with the mentioned green onions and I like red chili seeds for some heat. Nice accompanied by broccoli topped with a bit of tamari

I'll probably make this with steamed broccoli next time. Kumquats were a little bitter in recipe. Great way to use up all the 5-spice powder I didn't know what to do with though! Very tasty.

This was just good, not great. My family didnt really like it, they covered the taste of the chicken with chili paste. I thought it had way too much five spice powder. Next time, I wouldnt even bother with it. It took a few minutes getting the seeds out of the kumquats. I would make this again only because the ingredients called for are staples in my kitchen, so they're readily available. Also it's quick.

I have been looking through my cookbooks for three days trying to find this recipe. Then I realized it came form BA. Glad I found it again and glad it is in the recuipe file on line. Very good and relatively low carb. I really like the flavor of the dish and will make it fairly often.

HOT!!! Next time I will only use half of the chili oil mixed with vegetable oil. Or is it the Chinese five spice that is so hot? Did not add the oyster sauce. Anyway, we loved this recipe and will make it again soon.

I liked this recipe very much. It was easy and had an unusual, but very good, flavor. I used 1-1/2 times the marinade, since I had more pork. For the pork, I used boneless, butterfly pork chops, sliced into thin strips. Also, I didn't use the kumquats. Instead, I got a bag of frozen stirfry veggies -- snap peas, juliened carrots, and onions -- and thawed them before adding them to the dish at the very end and cooking them for a couple minutes only. Excellent feed for a weekday meal!!

Wow! Fabulous dish. I didn't have 5-spice powder on hand but made my own mixing equal parts of ground star anise, fennel, pepper, cloves and cinnamon. Also substituted sauteed red pepper for kumquats and made my own chili oil with a mix of veg oil, sesame oil and dried chilis. YUM, YUM, YUM.

We used canned lychees instead of the kumquats and added snow pea pods and baby portabello mushrooms for a complete meal. Absolutely delicious.

The kumquats aren't necessary and I added pepper, stir-fried separately. Mind that you don't overdo the kumquats and try to buy small ones.

Truly different. Exotic blend of flavors and very easy to prepare. Fresh kumquats are available from Nov-Mar only so it will be a seasonal sensation for our family

I couldn't find kumquats in this area in Nov. so I used snow peas instead and added some extra oyster sauce to them. It takes a bit longer to prepare but results were good and the pork is very tender. Even my kid liked it!

Interesting combinations of flavors. The sweetness of the Hoisin sauce is balanced by the citrus flavor of the kumquats and heat of the chili oil. None of the flavors is overpowering as can happen with 5 Spice or hot peppers, but each distinctive flavor still comes through. Mildly exotic and unusual but not something that will put off anyone used to Americanized Asian food.
