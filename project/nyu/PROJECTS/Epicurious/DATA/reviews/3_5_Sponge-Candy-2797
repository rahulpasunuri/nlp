I was served this recently as a garnish with a chocolate pot de creme at Bistro 28, in Victoria BC. They sprinkled the parchment paper with fleur de sel and fennel seeds before pouring the toffee on it... This made it over the top gourmet! Sweet, salty and crunchy. Awesome.

I cannot believe others liked this recipe. It was horrible. My family and I found the texture bizarre and the flavor not good. And I hate that it sticks to my teeth when I eat it. I threw the entire batch in the trash.

My vote for 'candy most fun to make'. Be sure to use a big enought saucepan to allow for the foaming action which will not disappoint! I will use a 9x13 pan next time as mine overflowed.

The best! Very easy and better than my aunt's recipe. We coated it with dark chocolate for our Easter Baskets! Perfect, perfect, perfect! CookFromScratch.com

This is exactly like the kind you can buy in stores...just like the middle of a Cadbury's Crunchie bar. I was so excited to find this recipe (I love making candy) and, even better, it seems to be foolproof. Turns out perfect every time!

This was very easy to make and delicious. I was looking for a recipe for honeycomb and it was exactly what I was looking for.

I made about 5 batches of this recipe over the holidays and had good results every time. I always loved this candy when I was a child, buying it from our local candy store. I never knew how easy it was to make and how authentic it would taste, but am really glad I tried this recipe.

I make my own version of this recipe often. I have never added vinegar, it seems to work fine without it. After many batches of picking off little peices of foil, I discovered that lining the pan with parchement works perfectly, and does not need to be buttered. It is definitely worth dipping the peices in chocolate, albeit time-consuming.

Fabulous! My 5-year-old son needed to make something for class and describe the process. He did most of it himself and it was perfect! Unlike the chef from Claremont I found it very forgiving. We didn't sift and certainly didn't halve the recipe. The best part is the process -SO much fun and quick for those with short attention spans like 5-year-old boys!

You can halve this recipe, which will make more than enough for a family for a week. You have to sift the baking soda, don't overmix the mixture once it puffs, and don't let it turn too dark. If the baking soda or vinegar are too old, it won't puff, and if the ratio is wrong, it won't puff. It's easiest to do a half recipe, and pour it on a silpat mat to cool. It needs to stay puffy, cause the holes are what makes it crumbly. And if you don't heat it to 300, it won't be crispy. (This is easy, IF you follow directions. You can't play with this one much.) And dark chocolate is great to dip the pieces in...I don't try cutting it, since it's too annoying. No one notices, anyway.

Super easy, even for this first-time candy maker! Reminds me of a candy I used to eat in New Zealand. Especially good when dipped in warm, homemade hot fudge sauce!

I've always loved sponge candy (or seafoam candy, as it's also called), and have often wished that it was more readily available. I was thrilled to discover this recipe, and happier still when I found out how simple it was to make! We dipped ours in chocolate, and it's wonderful (great for fondue, I'll bet!) - a lovely, old-fashioned pleasure.

I waited for the 'volcanic erruption' but only got a hard, pale brown, sheet of something that was like peanut brittle sans peanuts. Better luck next time.

Terrific, and easier to make than I thought it would.

My 5 yr old daughter said, "Mom! It's breathing! It's alive!" My dog ate a lot of this also as the recipe makes quite a large amount. As for dipping the candy into chocolate, forget it! after fighting with it breathing and sighing on my countertop who wants to put forth the effort?

I have made this recipe many times, all successfully and all reviews (this is the prefect bring-along when a sweet is requested)have been positive, ranging from "weird, but good" to "Where did you get this fabulous stuff?" The ease of the recipe and the fun of watching the last step are both big plusses...

It was OK, but the squeeze wasn't worth the juice. I think it would make a nice base to a dessert or confection. One hilarious episode - I decided to do a half batch but forgot and added the entire measure of baking soda. It was a candy volcano. At least the dog profited!

This recipe is great just the way it is, or even better when the broken chunks are dipped in melted chocolate that's used for candy making.
