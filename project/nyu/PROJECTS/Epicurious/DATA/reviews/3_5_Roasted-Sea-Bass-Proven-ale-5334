This is potentially a lovely recipe. I followed it pretty much to the letter, but, although the fish was perfect after 15 minutes, the tomatoes, capers, garlic and olives (yes, I added olives) were incinerated. Nevertheless the end result was still flavoursome served with couscous with lots of lemon juice, olive oil and diced tomatoes. From other reviews I can only suppose that I did something wrong so I will try this again, but check on the liquids every 5 minutes (perhaps adding a little more oil).

Wanted a quick easy recipe for Sea Bass and this fit the bill. Was very pleased with results as was my husband.The sauce made the dish and agree could be used with any firm white fish including marlin , shark or monk fish. Since I used an iron skillet and have a hot oven so found the sauce was going toburn away so added more clam juce and wine while in the oven. Added Carribean spices because I had just bought a jar and was curious as to the result. Would make this again.

I used Chilean sea bass, an inch thick. Did not boil long enough to reduce to glaze. It was fabulous! Don't bake longer than 15 minutes.

This was yummy! I used Mahi-Mahi and I reduced the sauce for only a minute, thanks to the advice of other reviewers. I served it with sun-dried tomato Israeli couscous and steamed asparagus. I already want it again.

Amazingly easy and delicious. Did not have quite enough clam juice so added more wine, would do more clam juice next time for more flavor. Wish I had some good bread to soak up all the good sauce. Will definately make again. Used fresh striped bass that we caught on Christmas. YUM!

Outstanding is the only way to describe this recipe! I followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception of the addition of chopped kalamata olives, as suggested by another reviewer. I was not able to get bass at our local seafood market so I used snapper filets. I think any firm white fish would work. This was a "practice run" for a dinner party next week. Can hardly wait to make this again.

I thought this recipe was very bland, especially given the fact that my four year old who thinks everything is "too spicy" loved this and kept asking for more fish. I might make it again just so that he'll eat something besides peanut butter and jelly!

We loved this! My husband thinks bass is bland and he devoured it, though I think the silkiness of bass is second to none. I used dried thyme, though next time I'll get fresh for even better flavor. Took the suggestions of others and didn't reduce the sauce first, but found it was too watery after removing it from the oven, so I had to add a bit of Wondra on the stove top to quickly thicken it up. Next time I'll reduce it first as in the recipe. Definitely use the clam juice, as I think this is important to the flavor of the sauce. This ones a real winner and I'll be serving it as a treat to guests since bass is so expensive.

Made this for my kids during New Year's visit. It is their (and our) favorite fish dish. Used thick part of fresh cod filets (half the price of sea bass), and have also made this with frozen "cod loins" from Costco. A bit more liquid came out during cooking, but I just reduced the sauce after cooking, and whisked in a little butter. Be careful to not over-salt!

Easy to make and very flavorful! I used a dry northern Michigan Riesling and omitted the clam juice. I would definitely make this again.

My wife loved it and has requested I prepare it again for two other couples. Sea Bass is a great fish and this recipe gives it wonderfull flavor. I deleted the clam juice and added a little more wine.

I made just one serving as a treat for myself, using canned diced tomatoes and no clam juice because none on hand. Was in a hurry and did not bother to read all the reviews. Wish I had because sauce almost burned away in oven. Tasted very good because the fish was so good but maybe I'll try it again and add more liquid to sauce and reduce only briefly.

It was good, but a bit oily. Unfortunately, my children wouldn't touch it, so I won't be making it again. My husband loved it, though, and I thought it was very good.

I followed the recipe more or less exactly, except after removing fish to platter, I deglazed the pan with more wine and clam juice to make more sauce to spoon over. Served with stuffed tomatoes and white rice. Miminal fuss for a high-end dinner party entree.

This is a great dish. So easy to make and great for company as it dosen't take you away from your guests. Slip it into the oven when you have your first course and thats it. Beautiful on the plate because of the colours and so favourful. I didn't boil it down to a glaze just brought it to a boil.

I loved this recipe, I used orange roughy instead of sea bass.I also did not have sun dried tomatoes so I used vine ripe cherry tomatoes cut in half. I omitted the clam juice and took the other cooks advice and added matchstick zucchini, which I sauteed with the olive oil and garlic first, then the wine, the juice of 1/2 lemon, then the fresh tomatoes to keep them from over cooking. I put this in a non metallic baking dish and placed the fish on top and baked at the recommended time and temp. I served it with herbed orzo and steamed asparagus. My husband thought I ordered this from the take out Italian restaurant it was so good!

oh yeah, i used Halibut instead of SeaBass and it was delicous! Both are great I'm sure.

Great dish, even heated up the next day -- the sauce soaks into the fish. Used sun-dried tomatoes NOT IN oil; boiled water, covered tomatoes, then put hot tomatoes into olive oil and let sit for awhile. Somehow, using this more pulverized version, made the sauce excellent. Who knew! Anyway, this is a wonderful entree.

Great flavors! I added some juillienned zuchini and yellow squash to the sauce and will keep that addition in the future. I am always trying to squeeze as many veggies in as possible. Will also use less oil next time. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was relatively simple and absolutely delicious. The oven roasting cooks the sea bass perfectly.

Excellent flavor! I agree with the cook who said not to reduce this sauce before it goes into the oven; actually, I would let the alcohol cook off for a minute or 2 on the stove after adding the white wine but I agree that the sauce overall will reduce in the oven at such a high temp. I served it with pasta and we absolutely loved it!

This dish was so easy to prepare yet, the taste was delectable. I did not have capers on hand so, I went without. I added a few chopped clams in clam juice to add a little more body, used seasoned salt and seasoned pepper and a little of Emerils Essence. Simply Marvelous.

I made this receipe for New Year's Eve (12/31/01) buffet party for 20 folks. It was excellent - the guests could not get enough. Dee Hunter, The Fresh Kitchen, Personal Chef Service, Savannah, GA

This is absolutely delicious. But, there is really no need to reduce the sauce prior to adding the fish. It reduces itself quite nicely while baking. The first time I had to add more liquid to avoid a burnt dinner. Now I just bring the sauce to a boil, add the fish and pop in the oven.

AWESOME! A simple, yet really awesome recipe. I substitued thick pieces of fresh striped bass for the "sea bass" called for. I also "bulked up" the sauce by adding 2 small fresh beefsteak tomatoes, about a cup and a half of pitted, halved kalmata olives, and I used a whole jar of capers, a cup and half of wine, and a small jar (10oz?) of sun dried tomaotes instead of the amounts called for. I like alot of sauce :) If you add the olives, don't salt the fish, b/c the brine from the olives adds all the salt you need. I served with baby yukon gold potatoes roasted with rosemary. YUM!

Dinner guests have raved about this dish, made with Chilean Sea Bass. It's simple to prepare, as well.

Maybe it's my fault for substituting halibut, but the fish was dried out and there wasn't any sauce, just flecks of almost-burnt sundried tomato. I'll substitute oven-dried tomatoes, reduce the sauce less, cover the pan, and reduce overall oven time in the unlikely event I attempt this one again.

Excellent sauce but the sea bass was slightly over cooked. Next time I will cut the baking time down to 12 minutes

Excellent! Even the non-fish eaters were raving about it. And it's very quick and easy.

Absolutely marvelous! Great texture! I substituted dried sun-dried tomatoes that I reconstituted with hot water and a smidgeon of olive oil for the oil-packed tomatoes. Will do again very soon!
