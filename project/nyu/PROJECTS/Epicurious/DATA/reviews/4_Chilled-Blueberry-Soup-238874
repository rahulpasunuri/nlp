This recipe gets 4 forks for ease of preparation and for the wildly fresh and refreshing taste of blueberries in season

Great hot or cold and easy to make. Substituted Grand Marnier for the orange along with the wine and it became a cold soup/drink. We will make again and recommend to friends.

just made it for the first time and enjoyed it...although there was room for improvement. I recomend using more fruit, a little less wine or water and have additional yogurt on hand.

Simply amazing! Delicious on a hot, summer day. Substituted the fruity white wine for Chardonny. Would definately make it again.
