This is such a delicious and elegant way to incorportate cheddar into an apple pie. The crust is so flavorful and very complimentary to the tart apple filling. I didn't have raisins on hand, so I chopped up some dried figs and used those instead which was great. This is my new favorite apple pie recipe.

I made a double crust, used a mixture of apples we had picked, and added a pie bird in the middle. Quite the hit

The filling was good, but we were not big fans of the crust - it was too savory for the sweet filling. I do think I would like the crust as crackers or something. I have a bunch of extra, so I'm planning to try it.

My dinner party guests raved about this. For reference sake for those who have no kitchen scale- 4 pounds of apples is approximated by 11 cups of sliced apples. As with the other reviewers, I used significantly less than 2/3 cup ice water in the crust. The egg wash was important to getting the crust to brown a bit. And finally, I omitted the raisins to keep the flavors more distinguishable in the final product. Very nice.

I have made this pie many times and it is great every time. I use the crust recipe but make a bottom and top crust. I also don't chill the dough the whole two hours. Thirty minutes is suficient.

I thought the crust was just too cheesy. Maybe the filling would stand up to the intesely flavored crust better with more brown sugar and spices, but I think I just prefer the more traditional crust. It did have a nice light flaky texture, though.

The dough formed into a ball after I'd added only a few drops of ice water. I added a bit more just because I couldn't imagine the amount of water called for by the recipe was that far off. That was a mistake. My advice: as soon as a ball forms, no matter how much water you've added, stop there. The dough was very wet and difficult to form into a disc, but I managed and chilled for 2 days. The dough was still too wet to roll out. I actually pressed half of the dough into a traditional pie dish and added flour until I could roll the other half into a version of a top crust. It wasn't pretty. I left the raisins out of the filling (husband doesn't like them)and needed less apples since using a smaller pie dish. The crust baked beautifully while the filling was soupy. But, while I thought the pie would be a disaster, it came out really well. Not the prettiest pie I've ever made, but quite tasty. My group likes this better than the recipe by the same name in Nov. '96 Food & Wine.

Made this for the first time. Followed recipe to the letter. Crust turned out thick and tough and the filling too tart. I wish I'd read the reviews before I made this. Obviously I did something wrong.

We just moved up to Vermont, and this is the perfect way to use the local cheeses and apples. Another great feature is that we were able to cut the recipe down in half, making it a good choice when you aren't serving a crowd and don't want tons of leftovers.

Having made this dish before, I figured it was a likely candidate for doubling... not so. Even after baking for well over an hour, the apples were still hard, and were swimming in this horrid watery sauce, and at the suggestion of another reviewer, I used extra sharp cheddar and the crust was a bust too... overcooked on the edges and thick (but not doughy) in the middle. Ended up taking the top off, adding flour to thicken, making a crumb topping and re-heating. Big disappointment this time around,(not that I was overly-impressed with it the first time), just that my guests seemed to enjoy it.

This recipe has its merits in that the apple filling itself is good. But, I would never again bother making a cheddar crust for an apple pie. The crust IS very good, but it isn't worth the extra effort and expense to add cheese to the crust because the apple filling completely overshadows the crust's flavor. If you want the taste of apple pie & cheddar, your best best is to put a wedge of cheese on top of your slice. Also, remember to wait until juices start bubbling before removing your pie from the oven, regardless of the baking time specified. If not, the apples may be undercooked.

I was disappointed with the cheese crust. My guess is that the sharp cheddar I used wasn't sharp enough. So my recommendation is to use the sharpest cheddar you can find.

This is a delicious and beautiful pie. Like some other reviewers, I made it with a top and bottom crust (there is plenty of dough in the recipe). The cheese crust is delicious, but it's very savory and doesn't go with ice cream if that's the kind of pie you're looking for. Also, be careful with the water - I used the whole amount in the recipe, and I had to scrap my first attempt after the dough became too wet and glutinous.

This is great! I'm doing an apple pie birthday party for my son and wanted a variety of pies-- this one is good for those people who don't really like the super sweet pies. I just wanted to give a tip for people without a food processor: You can use a standing mixer for the crust. Sift the flour and salt together into the mixer bowl, add butter with the beater on "stir" until it resembles peas. Break up big chunks with your fingers. Add cheddar cheese while mixer is going until it's pretty consistent. Add water while it's stirring until it all holds together. Easy!

This pie was so delicious! Although I made alterations and they were wonderful. I used Fuji instead of Granny Smith, butter instead of shortening, "Craisins" instead of raisins and used raw cane sugar on the top of the pie instead of regular sugar. It was tart and a great compliment to the cheddar crust. I loved that it was a bottom-less crust pie. My company raved over how good it was and there was not a piece leftover.

I've never made a pie this good! Everyone at the Thanksgiving table raved! There is plenty of dough to make this into a traditional 2 crust pie, with enough left to make decorative leaves for the top. The crust was fabulous!

Having made apple pie all my life without a teaspoon of pepper in the apples, I am nervous to do so but with the reviews so good, especially for the cheese crust, I have to try it! But first, a question: you still add the ginger, right? or is it really just "pepper as the spices"? I admit it - this recipe has upset my apple cart....

delish! best tasting crust i have ever tried. i am now officially a crust picking loiterer.. so i baked up the crust trimmings to spare the pie.8^D made as written, we also thought the blend of apples and spice v good, will definetly make again. and soon, judging by the disappearing act going on right now.

WOW. This is the first of many, many epicurious recipes that my boyfriend has given the almighty four forks. I'm right there with him. The crust is absolutely delicious (beware of crust picking loiterers in the kitchen) and so is the filling. I followed the recipe to a T - the only difference is that I made two smaller pies (didn't have the right sized dish) - had to make double the crust to get two pies (unlike a previous reviewer). Oh, and used dark brown sugar rather than golden just because it's what I had on hand.

Alas, true love! This is the apple best pie I've ever tasted. I tried the 'pepper as a spice' suggestion and will now use it all the time. Best ever - enjoy!

Everyone loved this recipe especially the crust. I'll be making this one again in the future.

This was a wonderful recipe and I would definitely make it again! From the other reviews, I adjusted my version of the recipe as follows: basically made the crust the way Joy of Cooking does it with the cheese added, plus I mixed Galas, Granny Smith and MacIntosh apples which turned out great! It was a big hit both freshly baked and reheated the next day!

I absolutely loved this crust! I also made a top and bottom crust and thought it turned out fine. However, I wonder if the cooking time is too short?? I cooked it the recommended time and ended up with alot of liquid in my pie. It still tasted great, though. I think I will tack on addtional time to the cooking next time and see if that takes care of the problem.

Fantastic. "The Crust To End All Crusts" this should be named. This beats out the "Honey Apple Pie with Lattice crust" that I held so dear. A couple of amendments were made to this recipe: 1.) Sweetie specifed that he wanted "a no-frills apple pie with cheddar in the crust." This meant no raisens 2.) used three jonagold and three granny smith apples (the jonas weren't as crispy as the grannies which made the end result perfectly textured) 3.) added cardomom to the list of spices 4.) top & bottom crusts 5.) baked this in a shallow, oval copper gratin pan (my baking ware is currently en route to my new residence). I think that's it. Boy was it good.

The crust is definately what makes this pie stand out from typical apple pies. Instead of making this with a top crust only I made two smaller pies with top and bottom crusts and it turned out great.

I've made this pie four times already. However, I recommend using more than one type of apple. I use at least three diferrent varieties - Golden Delicious, Gala, and Granny Smith. absolutely wonderful!

This was perfect for a Thanksgiving Dinner Party I had for 14 guests. I was not able to get the Cheddar Cheese we have in the States, but the English Cheddar was a O.K. substitute. I served it warm with a dab of whipped cream. Also it was not a heavy dessert after a very large dinner. It also is good cold the next day. Will make it again.

This was FAB - also used black pepper for spices. Gave it a great kick. To the novice from Jacksonville, a savory crust such as this one begs for a spicy offset to the apples. Not that you'd understand what any of this means, of course. Keep cookin' (and capitalizing your letters inappropriately)!

Apples and Cinnamon go hand in hand. Pepper in place of cinnamon??....how awful!!! You have to be nuts to even consider using pepper. That is sick! This recipe was very good and the cheese pie crust added a really nice flavour. I don't like raisins so I left that out. It was a great pie.

Wow! My husband and I were testing recipes this weekend and he decided to try this one. We're not big fans of nutmeg or cinnamin, so he substituted a teaspoon of finely ground black pepper for the spices. Also used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Our kitchen smelled so great while this was baking! This is our new favorite and we'll be making it for the holidays.

Great pie. I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. I omitted the raisins and did a full bottom and top crust. There was plenty of dough so I didn't even need to double the crust recipe. The dough was also very easy to work with. Will definitely add this one to my favorite pie recipes.

The cheddar crust was the best part! Everyone went crazy for it. I also used slightly sweeter apples from the local farmers market and these were absolutely delicious in the pie.

I made this especially for my Dad since he loves cheese and apple pie. I'm afraid I didn't read the recipe very close and made an actual pie with top and bottom crust. I was concerned how it would turn out. My Dad said it was the best apple pie he ever ate!It came out beautiful! I will make this again.

The crust is what make this pie great! I do find it to be a bit too tart, therefore, I like to make it with half granny smith and half golden delicious.
