My first time making Kalbi. These were as delicious as any I've ever tasted. I marinated for about 5-6 hours and they came out as juicy and flavorful as any overnight marinade. Very minor substitution; I just used brown sugar instead of raw/turbinado sugar. Looking forward to making these again!

Excellent recipe. The crosscut ribs are very flavorful. The meat is nice and chewy as it is supposed to be.

Great flavour but tough! Even after 3 days marinating this cut was still like jerky. Its a shame since the cross cut ribs look really cool and I was so psyched that the local supermarket was happy to custom cut these. A thin sliced T-Bone worked much better.
