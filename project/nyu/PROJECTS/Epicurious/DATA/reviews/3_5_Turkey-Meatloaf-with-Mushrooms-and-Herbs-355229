I made this last night and it was fabulous. I used 1.5 cups of panko and I sauteed the mushrooms and shallots with a few cloves of garlic. The mushrooms put out too much moisture if they aren't sauteed first which is probably what the excess fluid people mentioned in other reviews. I used two pounds of 94/6 ground turkey. The mixture fit perfectly into my Pyrex loaf pan and the timing in the recipe is accurate - 1 hour 25 minutes at 350. I did not do a glaze since I hate ketchup - the lack of ketchup in the recipe is what appealed to me. Instead I made a light gravy from chicken stock, shallots and thyme. This is moist and delicious and definitely a keeper.

Our favorite meatloaf. Make the glaze, sautee the shallots and mushrooms and you're golden. If your cat won't eat it, open a can of cat food.

Not good at all. No one would eat it, not even the cat. Only thing I did differently was I didn't put in the parsley. I even made the glaze.

This recipe is AMAZING! The flavor is excellent and the meat is tender and juicy! I used a wheat roll rather than pain rustique, but I think either would have great results. I will definitely make this again.

This was very good. I made it as written except that I used about 3/4 lb. of mild Italian turkey sausage and 1 1/4 lbs. ground turkey. It did have a bit too much liquid that bubbled to the top during cooking. It was easy to spoon away, so it was no big deal. But if I make it again, I'll spoon out the extra liquid while it still has a little cooking time left so it browns completely on op.

I needed something to do with my ground turkey and mushrooms and how easy was this? Made as written and loved it. The bread made the meatloaf a little like stuffing. I liked the idea another reviewer mentioned of a mushroom sauce on top and may try that next time.

I have made this recipe as is several times and have absolutely loved it! Very moist and aromatic! This last time I decided to try some of the variations suggested by others. Several have recommended sauteing the mushrooms and shallots and using panko instead of bread cubes. When tried, I found the meatloaf to be much less flavorful with a texture that was rather unappealing. Make this recipe as written! It's fabulous!

Rating: 4
Very good! Moist & delicious, we didn't miss the beef at all. I used panko (1.5 C), sauteed the shallots & mushrooms, and made the glaze suggested by many other reviewers. I'm happy to have found a go-to recipe. It was so good that for the first time ever my husband didn't drown his meatloaf with ketchup!

Rating: 4
Made just as the recipe suggested and we really liked it. I had a lot of mushrooms to use up, so I sliced and sauteed the rest of the mushrooms, made a light bechamel sauce laced with a tablespoon of cognac,combined them and used to sauce the meatloaf. Kicked it up a large notch.

Very delicious, was able to make really quick. Also sauteed mushrooms and shallots, and used pankro. Definitely will do it again.

Tons of flavor - not your average meatloaf. The mushrooms were yummy. I used Semifreddi's garlic croutons for bread which helped I think. I didn't worry about the fat content and just used whatever turkey was available

Rating: 4
Used panko for bread crumbs, could not find 15% fat turkey so used 2 pounds 10% fat. Other than that, made as directed. It was great. Husband loved it, son thought it had too many mushrooms. I think you could easily tweak for variety, like using chili peppers and jack cheese for a mexican meatloaf or something like that, but it was just perfect as is.

Rating: 4
Excellent! However, first time I made it, there was too much fluid all around, so I omitted the chicken stock the second time, and it was perfect.

Excellent dish. I added about 1.5 x the herb and spice ingredients for extra flavour.

decided to make this as is (with the small addition of 2 cloves of garlic) even though I thought it would need some kind of glaze/sauce......it did need this and when I cook this again I will make this addition. I did also find it to be a little too bread crumb tasting for my liking....Potential though as I think the overall flavour was quite tasty.

Rating: 4
I took the suggestion from others and used two cups of panko breadcrumbs instead of rustique bread. In addition, I sautéed the mushrooms, shallots, and added a few cloves of crushed garlic. I did not add the thyme, though did use the Italian parsley and 1 1/2 tsp worcestershire sauce. I used one pound of ground turkey and one pound of elk sausage because thats what was in my freezer. And lastly, I made the glaze and it turned out scrumptious!

normally i dont like meatloaf because every time that i have eaten it it was always dry. this meatloaf was very moist. i made this for dinner for my boyfriend and i one night and he raved about it. he even went as far as saying it was better then his moms. needless to say we will be making this again.

Rating: 4
so delicious! have made exactly as written (my first time), and then when i remade it followed other reviewers' suggestions to saute the mushrooms & shallots first and add the glaze at the end. the suggestions make it even better, but it's also fantastic as written. my husband says this is the best meatloaf he's ever had. i usually do it really simply with mashed potatoes and green beans. on a cold winter night it's perfect!

Soooo gooooood! I used Panko and beef broth. I also made a glaze with ketchup, brown mustard, and brown sugar. AND I sautéed the mushrooms and shallots. Dry herbs were a good substitute for fresh herbs. This one is comfort food all the way...

This meatloaf was delicious. As posted in other reviews, I used Panko bread crumbs, sauteed the shallots and mushrooms in about a tlbs of butter, and used the glaze. I also used a pound of frozen ground turkey and a pound of frozen ground turkey sausage. It was just awesome. My 2 year old even loved it.

Very good and light meatloaf, but don't skip the glaze suggested by one of the reviewers towards the end: "I also added a glaze to the top of the meatloaf. 1/4 cup balsamic, 1/4 cup ketchup, 1 tblsp honey, 1tblsp of brown sugar, and brown mustard." It adds SO much flavor. The meatloaf is better with ground turkey with a little more fat in it, or even ground dark meat turkey. Also good with a little garlic or extra herbs -- I wasn't as crazy about the thyme, but loved it with plenty of fresh parsley. The recipe is a good starting point, but it's turned out best when we've played around with the ingredients a little.

This was delicious! I also used some ground pork in addition to the turkey. I sauteed the mushrooms and shallots together before adding to the mix. It was wonderful warm, so will try as a cold sandwich tomorrow to see if it stands up to the test. Will definitely make this again.

Very good turkey option if you want to go leaner than beef. So yes, you should expect a different texture. I enjoyed the mushrooms a lot in the texture and added a ton of fresh herbs which i think made the flavor. I also had a kielbasa and cut it up into little bits and added to the meat. recommend that little touch!

The reviewer who said the meatloaf resembled canned cat food was spot on! My family loves meatloaf, but this was a major loser. I will never make it again.

I've made this a couple of times now and my husband and I absolutely love it. The only change I made was to use 2 lb of 97% lean turkey since that's all I can usually find. It's even better left over.

"Better than expected" said the man who doesn't like meatloaf nor mushrooms. (What was I thinking making this dish?) He actually doesn't know there were mushrooms in there since I chopped them up tiny, used lots more parsley and not so sure about the flavor of the thyme in the dish. Served with freshly steamed green beans and ketchup.

Rating: 1
I tried this recipe with some of the substitutions suggested: bread crumbs for the rustique, ground pork for the turkey breast and I coated the meatloaf with the glaze (the glaze was actually the best thing in this dish). The meatloaf was TERRIBLE! My boyfriend, who will pretty much eat whatever I cook, wouldn't even finish his. We threw the whole loaf away. The texture of the meatloaf never really firmed up and the flavor was like catfood or something. I think I'll stick to "beef" meatloafs from now on.

Rating: 4
this was delicious, my husband and i both loved it. i followed the recipe pretty closely, except i used dried parsley and thyme rather than fresh, and i used 2 lbs of lean turkey breast (less than 1% fat) rather than 1 lb breast and 1 lb of 15% fat as the recipe calls for. it was the tiniest bit too salty, probably because i used full-salt chicken broth so next time i may reduce the extra salt just a bit. but i am definitely making this again. i served roasted eggplant and some warm tomato sauce on the side.

I loved this recipt and so did my kids. You know it has to be good when everyone will eat it! I made it with panko though, since I know I don't like chunks of bread in food, and it was great. I used the same amount. It was such a hit I can't wait for the leftovers tonight!

I really liked this recipe. It was so easy, and it came out smelling and tasting like it took a lot of effort. I ended up adding a ton more shallots and parsley than called for. Also used store bought crumbs and the glaze suggested by an earlier review. First recipe I've taken the time to review.

Pretty Good Meatloaf. I was unable to find the ground turkey at the grocery store so instead of the ground turkey I used 1 lb of gr pork and 1 lb extra lean gr beef. I used the glaze recommended in the other reviews and it was fantastic! Next time, I would add garlic, and less olive oil.

The loaves' appearance and texture seemed very strange to me, but then again, I haven't eaten meatloaf in thirty years. Strangeness aside, the dish was VERY tasty. I followed it according to the recipe EXCEPT subbed 1 1/3c bread crumbs for the bread. My mixture filled TWO loaf pans nicely. I did not have the moisture pooling problem at the end, although halfway through baking, there was lots of liquid that eventually baked off. I glazed one loaf w/one reviewer's recommended glaze, minus the honey. Yum. The other loaf we had with gravy I made from roast chicken drippings. Just like thanksgiving! :)

Rating: 4
I was not expecting much because I'm sort of new to the whole ground turkey thing, but we loved it. I made the recipe exactly as written other than the herbs. I didn't have the fresh parsley or thyme and didn't want to make a trip to the store, so added 1 tsp herbs de Provence. Next time I will only add one tsp salt. A little too salty... Also, don't be tempted to saute the mushrooms first. They release their liquids into the meatloaf and keep it moist.

I don't like meatloaf and have been refusing to make it for my boyfriend. I saw this recipe that did NOT include ketchup and decided to try it. After reading the reviews I made some modifications that other reviewers tried/suggested. I used 1.25 lbs of ground turkey and .75 lbs of ground grass-fed beef. I sauted the mushrooms, shallots, and added a tsp of garlic in the oil first. To that mixture I added the parsley, a 1/4 tsp of each salt & pepper and 1-1/2 tsp of worcestershire sauce. I omitted the thyme, but added a shredded carrot and celery. I added more salt and pepper to the meat before mixing in with the bread and the saute mixture. It turned out very good. I would eat it again. My boyfriend loved it. He said he normally needs ketchup on meatloaf, but he liked the flavor of this one so much he skipped it! I gave it 3 forks, but he said he gives it 4 forks!

I did not like this recipe at all. Very bland and tasteless. I think sauteeing the mushrooms and shallots first would help a bit as would a glaze on top, but as is, I would never make this again. Yuck!

I thought this was great, and VERY easy, especially if you get mushrooms already slided. I have never really made meatloaf before, but have made this twice in 2 weeks. The turkey makes it much more appealing and not as heavy.

This recipe is very bland. I made it per the directions but, I reduced the salt by half (which I do for every recipe I make - IMO, if you have to add a lot of salt for flavor, then it is not a good recipe.) If I were to make it again, I would saute the mushrooms with the shallots and some added garlic and double the herbs.

Rating: 4
this is one of the first bon appetit recipes that i've tried that i'd give 4 stars. i'm originally from the south and used to ketchup-topped meatloaf but this was fantastic! very succulent and moist. i didn't have a loaf pan so i used a square corningware-type dish and had to adjust the cooking time. also, instead of 15% ground, i found ground dark meat turkey so not sure of the fat % but don't think it'd be less. also substituted dried herbs instead of fresh.

Just made this last night, and my wife and I were very impressed. Previously, I'd say that my dad's meatloaf was the best I've ever tasted, but now I think we've got a close contender. Very moist, very flavorful, and I'm now looking forward to carving up what's left for lunch today. It's not a question of would I make it again, it's a question of how soon will I make it again.

This was really good. I skipped added salt, but made it just as written otherwise. It could use a little something, so I may try the glaze mentioned in an earlier review next time.

My fiance and I both thought this was very delicious. I made a few changes, sauteed the mushrooms first in a little oil because I love that chewy texture. Also I added one small finely diced red onion to the shallots, and sauteed those in butter first. Followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. Made a simple gravy with shallots, chicken stock, corn starch, white wine and S&P. Excellent! To the reviewer below with the liquid pooling problem, this happened to me too. After I had let it rest I simply spooned off the liquid and discarded, its mostly fat and impurities.

Ok...I guess I'm the only one who had this problem: This was way too salty for me!! Maybe because I didn't use low-sodium broth? If you are planning on making this, use low-sodium broth. Also, it could just be me. My boyfriend loved this - he said it tasted like "Thanksgiving" (I think it was the thyme). Also, my meatloaf had this weird liquid that poured out the top and kind of congealed on top - any suggestions on how to prevent that?

I was surprised at how moist the turkey meatloaf was. I substitued bread crumbs for the plain rustique day old bread. I think soaking it in chicken stock really makes a difference. I also added a glaze to the top of the meatloaf. 1/4 cup balsamic, 1/4 cup ketchup, 1 tblsp honey, 1tblsp of brown sugar, and brown mustard. It added a lot of flavor.

My family really enjoyed this meatloaf - in spite of the fact that we generally are NOT meatloaf lovers. I left out the mushrooms, and it was still excellent (though certainly would have been even yummier with 'shrooms). The next day, we made sandwiches with slices of leftover meatloaf - adding mozarella cheese and frying the sandwiches in a bit of butter.

Very, very good. I've had turkey meatloaf once before and it was HORRIBLE so needless to say, I had very low expectations. This recipe was delicious. I made a few changes (I just can't help myself). I grated 2 carrots to boost our veggie intake and added some caramelized onions on hand from the weekend before. We've made two dinners and two lunches out of the recipe and we still have leftovers. Yum, yum, yum.

This recipe was delicious! My boyfriend said that it was the best thing I have ever made. I used a crunchy wheat bread that I purchased at the store that same day and it worked great - I even left the crusts on. I baked it for about 5 extra minutes to get the crust a little crunchier. The end result tasted a bit like Thanksgiving, a combo of turkey and stuffing.

This recipe turned out delicious. It was very flavorfulfresh thyme is a mustand moist. Although the recipe labels serving four with leftovers, in my household, there was no leftovers to speak of.
