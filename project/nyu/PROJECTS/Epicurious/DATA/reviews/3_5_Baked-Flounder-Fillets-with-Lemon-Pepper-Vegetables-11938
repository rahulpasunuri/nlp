Wonderful flavors! Can't say I followed the recipe really, I cooked the flounder filets face up, on the mushroom and green onion mix, sprinkled the bread crumbs and freshly grated parmesan on top of the filets, drizzled white wine over it all, and baked as directed. Yumm!

Simply amazing dish. We just had two fillets so we divided the vegetables by 3 -- made the whole wine/lemon juice/olive oil mixture though. The fish fell off the fork it was cooked so perfectly. Made it with some jasmine rice (it was all we had) but it made for a perfect, aromatic, light dinner. I'll be making this again soon!

Nice dish, good flavor. Pretty presentation with vegetables was appetizing and healthy. Always looking for a different way to prepare fish and this was a great change. Went very well with a brown rice pilaf that I had time to make while it baked (rice already cooked and leftover from previous meal) so it was a time-saver as well.

Sorry but this was nasty. Don't know if it was the fish or the vegi's or maybe just me, but it wasn't good at all... Oh well maybe next time.

This dish is easy on the pocketbook and on the digestive system. It's easy and light and might make an excellent appetizer served with Champagne. We served this dish with a 1996 Pascal Jolivet Sancerre and found it to be a very good match.
