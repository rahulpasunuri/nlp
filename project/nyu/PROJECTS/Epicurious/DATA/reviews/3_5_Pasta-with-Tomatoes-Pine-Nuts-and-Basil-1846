4 forks with a few adds based on other reviews... - I toasted the pine nuts and added them at the very end - Add 1/2 c white wine and 1/4 c lemon juice after the garlic. Let it cook down a bit and then proceed. - Almost forgot! Added a little crushed red pepper. - This was so, so, so good! I will make again and again. Would be great with chicken or shrimp added.

Delish! My husband say he could eat this every day. As per previous reviewers, I toasted the pine nuts in a skillet and used them as a garnish at the end along with additional chopped basil. We didn't even use the Parmesan cheese that I grated because it was good without it. And why not save calories/fat grams where possible?

Very easy and quick to make with summer ingredients from the garden. I used regular canned artichoke hearts instead of marinated and was not disappointed. Can be made while the pasta cooks.

Made it with one jar of the artichoke hearts and fresh linguine and it was an easy, scrumptious summer dinner. My daughter loved it too.

QUICK and tasty. Perfect as is! Made with whole wheat penne and grape tomatoes cut in half. Will try some of the other cooks' variations next time around.

Perfect.

This was simple, healthy summer fare. I made this without the artichokes and substituted the angel hair with whole wheat spaghetti.I will definitely try this again, maybe with capers next time.

Conventiently, the pine nuts and basil were packaged together at the supermarket. I left out the artichokes (to save some $$) and found this dish to be light and tasty.

I agree with a previous reviewer. The ingredients didn't complement each other. It wasn't a good mix.

I would definitely make this recipe again. It was really quick, with just a few ingredients that were already in the fridge. It wasn't anything super spectacular, but you get a lot of bank for your buck. I also added lemon juice just for a little kick.

A great recipe to begin with, however, I like to make this dish with chicken and a few extras to liven the flavor! After sauteing the garlic, I also add about a 1/2 cup of white wine and 1/4 cup of lemon juice and let it cook down to about half. Then I cook about 3-4 chicken breasts in a separate pan, cut it up after it's cooked and then add it to the tomato mixture at the end. It's one of my husband's favorites!

Simple and tasty dish. I agree with the other reviewer in that I wouldn't cook the nuts with the garlic. Instead I toasted it in the oven for a couple of minutes. I added a couple of other modifications as well. I sauteed a small onion with the garlic and used cherry tomatoes instead of 2 large tomatoes. I also added a bit of white wine. I mixed the pine nuts in at the end.

It's an OK recipe if you want something quick and easy but it's nothing to write home about.

My new fellow and I made this the other night and we both loved it. We probably smelled of garlic and oil when we went to the theatre afterwards, but it was well worth it.

A little mild like Noelle said: I add some cayenne! And of course some capers. As for the artichoke, I put 4-5 pieces per person and add them only at the end. Garlic and nuts together: no. First the pine nuts and the garlic after a few minutes is more secure.

An easy dish to prepare, and it's a great summer meal as well as a satisfying vegetarian dish.

With a few modifications this is one of my favorite summer recipes! I left out the artichoke; used grape tomatoes for more flavor. Sometimes I cut a chicken breast into very small pieces and saute it with the garlic at the beginning. Loved it!

I loved it! I thought that it had a great flavor, if a little mild. Next time I'll add some more tomatoes and possibly some crushed red pepper flakes to the oil at the beginning.

The addition of 1 jar of capers makes this even better!

Easy and quick and yummy. I added capers and black olives to the recipe.

In my opinion, this recipe lacks flavor. I have similar recipes which are faster to make and are much more flavorful. I wouldn't make this again.

Easy, quick delicious. I was very pleased with this recipe. I doubled the tomatoes and cooked them longer (because they were super-market tomatoes.) But with home grown, the given time would probably be great.

This is the perfect recipe--delicious and quick and easy to make! It's become a regular dish on our dinner table.
