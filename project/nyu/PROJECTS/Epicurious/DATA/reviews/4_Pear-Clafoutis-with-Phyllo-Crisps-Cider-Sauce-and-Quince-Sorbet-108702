Onolicious as one would say in Hawaii...don't let the length of the recipe intimidate you. It's mostly prep and after that it moves along rather fast, especially when parts of it can be made ahead of time which helps immensely. The balance is perfect with the smooth sweetness of the pastrycream-clafouti and the cider sauce along with the crispy slightly salty texture of the phyllo. Ooooo, won't be too far in the future to repeat the fun once again.
