I wanted to add meat, so I took the casing off of mild Italian sausage, added garlic and the broccoli. Followed the rest of the recipe except for the anchovies paste, which I didn't have on hand. Great flavor, very color and fast and easy to make. I will definitely make this again!

The only substitution I made in the recipe was to use 2 tblsp of balsamic vinegar in lieu of anchovies, which I did not have on hand. It blended well and added some depth to the flavor, which I knew I'd need without the anchovies. Definitely worth a try as a quick weeknight meal, and it works well to reheat as leftovers.

Used couple of oil packed sun dried tomatoes and grape tomatoes halved. Thought it was excellent quick weeknite meal. Never had broccoli rabe, so great way to try.

One of our favourite pasta recipes. Make just as is--bitterness of the broccoli rabe, the umami of the anchovies, the sweet of the tomatoes (definitely worth using heirloom) and basil ... really good.

I substituted cauliflower for the broccoli rabe and used enriched penne. This was easy, quick, and beautiful to look at. My son rated it a ten.

I abosulutely love how fast and easy this is to make. I didn't use the anchovies (too lazy to go buy) but used wheat penne instead and spinach instead of broccoli and it still was a very tasty dish. I even whipped it up on a friend's with dinner night and they thought I worked hard. Our secret! ;)

Recipe looks easy and seems to be good. For those thinking the addition of meat would help- Pancetta or Proscuito would seem ideal.

I'm a meat lover lol! I think that's what I needed for this dish. I substituted spinach for the broccoli which turned out fine and I skipped the anchovies because I forgot to buy those. It turned out just fine and it was easy to make, only like I said we like meat and I think maybe I should have added some.

Would make this dish again, but would use spinach next time. The brocolli rabe was very tart, almost bitter. Beautiful colors in this dish.

This is a great quick and easy recipe with fresh, readily available ingredients. We used anchovie paste instead of anchovies... it was fabulous.

I love rapini and this recipe is delicious. I didn't have any lemons so I used a little balsamic and I used romano instead of parmesan. Yummy!!
