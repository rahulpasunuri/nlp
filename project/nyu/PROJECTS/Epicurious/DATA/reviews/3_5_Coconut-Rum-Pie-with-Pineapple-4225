Pretty good. Some people raved about it. The crust was really good, and the filling does taste a lot like a pina colada. I tried to make it in a springform pan, though, and it was just too messy to cut because it didn't get really hard, even after 24 hours in the freezer. it melted quickly and I had a gloppy (but yummy) mess on my hands.

A great summer time recipe! It was very refreshing. The earlier review about it being a frozen pina colada was true. It was really good and the overlapping pineapple circles made for good presentation. The recipe instructions do not say when to put the rum in but I added it with the whipping cream mixturm and it turned out good!
