Too bland as is...granted I forgot to toast the almonds but even toasted I don't think it would have enhance the flavor. I finally got to an acceptable taste by adding Greek Seasoning & garlic powder. Not sure I'd make this again.

When I read this recipe, I thought it was too much garlic, but really it's perfect. I reduced the amount of oil and added some chopped parsley. I used this dip as garnish for a fish. Potatoes in this way are delicious.
