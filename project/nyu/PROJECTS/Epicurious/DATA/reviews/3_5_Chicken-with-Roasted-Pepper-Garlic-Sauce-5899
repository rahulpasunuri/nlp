Is this a good sauce? Yes, at its heart. Does it have too much lemon? BY FAR. This sauce is not called creamy lemon sauce, it's called Roasted Pepper-Garlic Sauce. The lemon drowns out both. With everything that goes into this sauce, the flavors should be layered, delicate, and complex. Instead, this is a one note dish. The lemon covers all the other flavors, and the only time you taste the garlic or the peppers is when you actually bite into a piece. That is tragic, because this dish has so much potential. Next time I will try it with 1 - 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Also, there is no reason to broil the chicken. Cook it in the same saucepan that you will use to make the sauce. This will save you some dishes, and add some flavor to the sauce.

Okay, a little to much lemon taste for us.

Very good, it's can become an easy everyday meal if you buy the peppers already roasted. I would say use sour cream rather than the whipped cream. It makes it tastier and tangy. Also, don't let either the sauce or the chicken dry out.

This is delicious. I think those who said it was too lemony should have skipped the step of marinating the cutlets in lemon which the recipe did not call for. I agree about the time used to roast the peppers. I don't think using the ones in the jar would make much difference. I also think a bit less heavy cream and feta would be fine just to cut the fat content a bit.

Absolutely delicious! Definitely not too much lemon. Perfect balance of flavors. Easy to prepare but impressive enough to dazzle guests. This is my favorite chicken recipe!

I'm not sure if I would make this dish again. I thought it was a bit too lemon-y and tangy- and I like tangy usually. If I did try again, I would definitely buy jarred roasted peppers (too much work for hardly any difference). I would cut the lemon in half and add more white wine or some chicken stock. I marinated the chicken in lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, sage, salt and pepper. I grilled it, and the chicken turned out really nice. Served over mashed potatoes and with sugar snaps and they complimented well. Overall a decent dish that didn't take too long (sans marinating and roasting the peppers). Just need to work on the sauce.

I loved the blend of roasted garlic, lemon juice and cream. I doubled the garlic and would not reduce the lemon juice by even a drop.

Way to much lemon in this recipe!! The sauce might be decent if only a tablespoon was used.

The sauce was fantastic! I love roasted garlic. Because it's summer I could find no reason not to grill the chicken. I marinated the chicken for 1/2 hour in olive oil, lemon juice, and a little cracked pepper before grilling. YUM!

This is the most delicious blend of garlic, peppers, and cream I have ever made. But since my fiance and I are garlic lovers, we will try it with two whole garlic next time.

Yum! A really nice sauce. It's rich from the cream, but the lemon seems to lighten it a bit, so it's not overwhelming. I used all the ingredients as written (I forgot the feta though) but my prep was different. I sauteed the chicken (3 minutes a side, to brown) in a large skillet, pushed it to the side, and made the sauce as written in the same pan. The chicken stayed nice and moist that way, and flavors blended really well. Also easier cleanup; only 1 pan. I did use a jarred roasted red pepper. If you had that and some roasted garlic on hand, this would be easy enough for a weeknight. I served it with sugar snap peas and whole wheat rolls. It was nice to have a sweet vegetable to contrast the sour sauce, and the earthiness of hte whole wheat was really nice with it as well. Don't serve with sourdough bread! :)

What a great dish! The roasted garlic was in perfect balance with the peppers and the cream. My wife absolutely loved it, I am definately making this again.

Usually at home I give a rating up to 5 stars for new dishes I make. For this dish I had to add a new rating of 6 stars. It's that good. The feta makes the dish. I prepared exactly as the recipe calls for and it was easy to make and delicious.

I was quite underwhelmed with this. It sounded so good. A whole lot of work for mediocrity. Won't be making this again.

Loved it and would definately make it again. I didn't add the feta as the cream was enough fat. I pureed the garlic and added as well I used only the amount of juice I got from one lemon and a cup of wine.

Whoa, way to much cream! I had to add another tablespoon and a hlaf of fresh lemon juice and cut up some fresh parsley to balance it out. My guests loved it, but without my additions it would have been blah-cream sauce. Also, I used roasted peppers from the jar, worked fine.

This was an excellent dish!! I used a yellow pepper instead of a green, and grilled the chicken instead of broiling. My husband LOVED it! Would HIGHLY recomend it.

Rating: 2
This was OK, but nothing earthshaking, especially given the work involved in roasting and peeling the peppers and the garlic. I thought the sauce was a bit too sour, and the roasted pepper and garlic flavor got lost in the sauce--- literally.

Changed it - a bit, Loved it - a lot! Used 1 cup wine and no lemon juice but used 2 tsp grated lemon rind. Pureed roasted garlic and used to thicken sauce. After adding red pepper strips to sauce, stirred in 1 cup baby shrimp then topped chicken which was marinated in lemon juice and olive oil with thyme then grilled. Still topped with crumbled feta. Excellent.

Really fine. I used french feta, and grilled the chicken breasts on the BBQ. Also, I don't like the sharp flavor of green peppers, so I used one red, one yellow.

I love the sauce mixture of wine and lemon and cream. I have made this several times and it is always a hit. I have substituted Shrimp for the chicken too which is, of course, great.

The roasted garlic made this sauce really unique -- and delicious. I thought the sauce was a little heavy, but my husband loved it (in fact thought it might have been a little too thin). I like it when sauces taste a little more winey, so next time I'd add some more wine. I also took the easy way out and just used roasted red peppers from the jar -- still delicious and saved a lot of work. I served this with sugar snap peas w/toasted almonds and orzo that i cooked in vegetable broth and added some shallots to. Both went perfectly!

Rating: 4
Excellent! What a delight of many different flavours that go well together. Will go in the list of our top favorite recipes. Next time I will replace lemon juice with some lemon zest. That way you should get the lemony flavour without that little bit of sourness.

Loved this recipe! Next time I will prepare the garlic and peppers beforehand to cut down on the time. The sauce was excellent. I broiled the chicken but I guess overcooked it a bit. I will try grilling it next time. This is definitely a keeper! Would be wonderful to serve to guests also!!

My Husband and I made it last night. We both felt that the sauce was great. We both could have eaten the sauce alone and would have been happy. The chicken was very moist and tender putting the two together was a taste that we both will be craving for a long time to come. This recipe get's a 100% in our "Yum Yum" book. It sings flavor to your taste buds.

Roasted the garlic the traditional way,the whole bulb. Marinaded the chicken breasts in olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, red pepper flakes and basil. Then grilled the chicken on the bbq, great flavor. Beware! The cream will curdle if you do not reduce the heat before adding.

Rating: 3
Excellent flavor!!! A few short cuts I took: I sauteed the chicken and used Lemon Pepper seasoning, and I used a jar of roasted red pepper, both of which were fine for me. Already had the roasted garlic on hand. Used the called for amts. of wine and lemon juice and loved it! When I added the whipping cream I first removed the pan from the heat, added it gradually and also gradually increased the heat again. I then put the chicken into the simmering sauce, turned the heat down very low and covered it. Cooked for about 20 more mins. RAVE REVIEWS! Served with the Herbed Orzo on this site. A bit involved, but well worth the outcome! KIMBER

Very good. It helped to marinate the chicken, as other reviewers suggested. One thing, though. When I read the recipe I thought to myself that the cream, once in contact with the wine and lemon juice, would curdle, and that's just what it did. Continuing to simmer the sauce smoothed it out somewhat, but it was not as smooth a sauce as I like to serve to company. On the other hand, the company did not mind a bit.

I made this recipe for a friend's 40th Birthday and I was serving it to 20 people. The presentation was excellent over angel hair pasta and the sauce was very bold and flavorful. I am surprised that some didn't use all the lemon juice which I thought was what made the sauce in the first place. The other reviewer who's sauce thickened too much was probably due to overcooking as I didn't have that problem. My guests are still calling for the recipe and I'm making this again for New Year's instead of the traditional Prime Rib dinner!!!

Excellent recipe for entertaining as a lot of preparation can be done in advance. I cut down on the amount of lemon juice as did others and I served it with saffron rice. All my friends asked for the recipe (which was a great vote of confidence!).

This recipe was okay. The roasted garlic is very good but I didn't care for the whipped cream sauce-too heavy, and got gluey as it cooled. My husband liked it more than I and I am the chicken person in the family.

Made it with slightly less lemon juice. Didn't have boneless chicken so I baked it with some of the sauce and a few of the roasted cloves. Pretty tasty.

Rating: 3
This zesty, peppery sauce was a pleasant surprise for us garlic lovers. I like the idea of pounding the breasts thin and browning with salt and pepper. Serving over a bed of fettuccine will compliment this dish. The sauce did not reheat well the next day so enjoy it while it's fresh.

Rating: 3
I would reduce the amount of lemon juice called for in this recipe; it completely overwhelms all the other wonderful flavors. Also, I pounded the chicken breasts, sprinkled lightly with salt and pepper and sauteed them in a little butter and olive oil, then placed them in the sauce to let the flavors marry for a while.

Rating: 3
Very tasty! Dropped the peppers (would have presented well) and used lowfat (2%) milk instead of cream. Used key-limes from my tree instead of lemon. Finished sauce with 2 tbs butter to enrichen. Also, used 3/4 cup chicken stock in sauce to add to flaver and added broiler pan drippens to sauce. Roomate RAVED over sauce.

Pretty great when the chicken is marinated with lemon, garlic, etc. and grilled. Also used gorgonzola instead of feta, which was delish. I mixed red and green pepper for color. I've made it three times now. A hit!

Wonderful dish! I served it for company with herbed rice. Next time I will try it on pasta with the chicken sliced on top. Feta adds a nice touch!

We really liked this dish! To make it a little simpler, I used roasted peppers from a jar (red only). Presentation would have been better with both red and green, but the taste was great. I would forgo the feta cheese, but use the called for amount of lemon juice. I'll make this for company.

Sauce is terrific. Made it for the first time with great friends. Everyone loved it. Based upon previous comments we grilled the chicken for more flavor....excellent. Very versatile sauce. Would go with shrimp, rice, etc....

A versatile sauce that I found to be quite tasty. I really like the flavor of roasted peppers and garlic. I made the sauce with a white bordeaux and half-and-half (always looking to cut back the fat), and I think that wine was a good choice for this. Served it over the chicken on rice with simple, steamed green beans. I think shrimp would be great with the sauce over some pasta.

I added some "kick" to the chicken by adding cajun seasoning as well as salt & pepper before broiling. I think next time I may marinate the chicken before broiling it. The sauce was great, I have a feta cheese lover in my family and he loves this dish.

My family loved this dish. To be honest, the chicken was the least appealing part of it. The sauce was delicious over rice--next time we might skip the chicken.

I love this dish! I've made it over and over again. I wouldn't halve the quantity of lemon juice--that's where a lot of the flavor is. On the other hand, I double the amount of garlic-roasted garlic is delicious! I usually use either non-fat yoghurt or evaporated skim milk to cut down on fat and grill the chicken (tenderloin is best). I serve it on fettucini.

Delicious. As well as reducing the lemon juice by half, I also substituted nonfat yogurt for the heavy cream and coated the chicken breasts with olive oil flavored Pam cooking spray to reduce the fat content of this dish. I served it with a side of roasted garlic couscous. My wife loved it.

In that I make almost all of my meals from recipes from this site, I thought that this was a good meal, but there are others that are better and much easier to make. I refer the readers to the Chicken in Roquefort Cream Sauce in these pages. We liked it better and it was very easy.

Delicious! At the advice of prior reviewers, I too cut the lemon juice in half...I might even just use 1tbsp next time as I think the wine provides adequate acidity. I used grilled chicken and grilled monkfish and the results were excellent. A definate keeper. I've also substituted blue cheese for the feta and still loved it. Great for company, especially since it can all be made in advance then just re-heated and assembled prior to serving. Enjoy!!

this was delicious, but I agree with another submitter... cut the lemon in half.. no need for a side dish, just a crusty bun to mop up the sauce...yum
