OK, I'm browsing recipes for a stuffing to serve with a turkey I'm doing today. Since I've lived in Santa Fe for a lot of years and know a bit about the local cuisine, imagine my surprise when the first ingredient is kielbasa. This is just a generic, non-regional stuffing with the addition of green chiles. Stuffing here would likely have pine nuts and chorizo, but not kielbasa.

This stuffing had a bit of a zing to it which all of our guests enjoyed. Only change I made was using pine nuts, we've got a keeper here for our future Thanksgiving menus! Gobble, gobble! B.J. Harrick

Have made this every holiday season since 2004, always a winner and I don't change a thing, except the heat of the chilies, depending on the crowd.

This is truly delicious!! I used this as the stuffing for the Southwestern Turkey with Garlic-Ancho Chili Paste found on this site. An excellent pairing! I took the suggestions of others and used chorizo instead of kielbasa and pine nuts instead of pecans. Loved the pine nuts, but next time around, may opt for trying out some other smoked sausage. The chorizo was really good. I'd just like to taste the difference. Either way, I don't think you can go wrong. I used approximately equal amounts of day old cornbread and packaged stuffing mix, which worked well. There was plenty to stuff a 14 pound turkey with leftovers enough to fill an 8x8 square baking dish. I think I actually like the stuffing baked in the casserole better. The consistency was drier and fluffier, while the stuffing in the bird was a bit soggy. Less liquid would be in order, I think, but that will depend on the dryness of your bread. I'd suggest keeping the mixture on the dry side for stuffing the bird. Then, add a bit more liquid to any you bake separately. I was fortunate to have some Hatch green chiles I had frozen from the last harvest. I like the favor of the Anaheims better than Poblanos. All in all, a wonderful concoction that I will definitely make again.

This is such a favorite at christmas. However, I always make it with Chorizo, Bell Peppers, Thyme and leave out the Pecans and sage. Absolutely stunning, even the left overs the next day are too yummy for words.

This stuffing has been a family favorite since we first tried it 5 years ago! Virtually every dinner party or holiday we try out new recipes; this is one of the very few dishes that we make over and over. The freshly roasted poblano peppers are the key to this one, it's definitely worth the extra time to use them over canned chilies.

I just wanted to add that I just finished preparing this for tomorrow (Thanksgiving) and Mama Mia - it's yummy. If I don't get my husband away from it there won't be any left for the turkey. I liked the added of using pine nuts, which I did. Unlike others I actually used less bread crumbs. But, either way I think you'll like this.

WHAT??? No recommendations since 2004??? This is a perennial favorite. My family is always shopping the best store, the best this and the best that for the perfect meal; but they ALWAYS ASK me to make this stuffing. The combination of the chili, keilbasa, and cornbread is OUTRAGEOUS; and seriously contributes a great turkey. Do yourself a favor a give this recipe a try; You won't regret it!!!!

I made this stuffing last year and my family loved it. I had some friends try the leftovers and they liked it so much that a couple of them asked me to make it for Christmas. It was great!

I've made this stuffing for Thanksgiving every year since 1991, when it came out in Gourmet. I've rarely substituted ingredients, with the exception of using pine nuts instead of pecans. This year, at my father-in-law's request, I added golden raisins and instead of the pine nuts, I added butter toasted pistachios...I loved the taste of the raisins, but not crazy about the pistachios...although several people loved them. I'm sticking with pine nuts. I have always used more bread than called for, and also have used cilantro instead of the parsley. Such a wonderful recipe!

This was the best dressing I have ever made. Family loved it. I used 1 1/2 pounds of spicy Chappel Hill very spicy sausage. Did not put in turkey but baked separately till just hot. Very good. Will do often.

I didn't like that there were so many nuts in this recipe. It seemed like a very dry stuffing. I did however think it is a very different stuffing and certainly unusual, just not right for me.

I agree with everyone that it needs more bread than is asked for. I used half the green chilis and roasted pepitas (pumpkin seeds), 5-6 cups of bread and more liquid that requested plus 1 beaten egg. I skipped the parsley, but may add cilantro another time. I took another's suggestion and baked pork chops on top. This all fit in a 9 x 13" pan. My family loved it. Thanks for all the help beforehand, everyone.

I served this at a large family turkey dinner. Everyone loved it. I used only one can of chilies, made my own herb-seasoned bread crumbs and I used a box of corn bread stuffing. All together it was about 7 or 8 cups of bread crumbs. I also found the recipe a little confusing with reference to the amount of stuffing needed, so I suggest doing the above as the result was delicous.

I will make this again - a little confusing, as it referenced a buttermilk corn bread, so I made an Epicurious version. Added the entire recipe of corn bread(way more than 6 cups), and it yielded a good balance, although I may reverse the balance in favor of the herb stuffing vs. the corn bread. I also needed about 3 cups of broth to keep up with the corn bread addition, and also because I like a very moist stuffing. This makes a HUGE amount of stuffing (enough for two 9x13 baking pans).

This stuffing isn't just for Christmas or Thanksgiving. It's such a great hit at our house I make it now with baked pork chops. I want my whole family to enjoy it so I only use only 1 can of green chopped chiles. Also I substituted almonds for pecans and that turns out wonderful too. This is the most wonderful stuffing I have ever tasted.

I made this stuffing for Christmas dinner, and everyone loved it. It was definitely my husband's favorite dish. I did not add any chiles because most of the party do not like spicy food, but the taste was still good. I am looking forward to making this dish again for a party that likes chiles.

This made the best stuffing we have ever had. And the flavor that it imparted to the turkey was marvellously delicious. We will gladly use this recipe again and again.

This recipe was a definite hit at Thanksgiving dinner -- several diners opted for a second helping instead of dessert! I substituted toasted pine nuts for the pecans to extend the southwestern theme. Increasing the amount of cornbread, as suggested by one reviewer, also worked well. This stuffing will become a standard in my holiday meals.

I use chorizo, instead of the kielbasa - cooked and drained. And for extra spice, I mince a couple of jalapenos, cooking them with the onions.

This stuffing recipe is truly delicious (excellent w/the Southwestern Turkey). I would make one minor change- double the amount of cornbread (to 6 cups) to balance the volume of the other elements.

I make this stuffing year round and I make lots of it. my family likes it cold on ham sandwiches with loads of mustard. I eat it right out of the bowl.
