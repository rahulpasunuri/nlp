I LOVE this potato salad! We eat it every summer til we've OD'd on it. Yesterday I made it with purple potatoes, as they were the only organic easily available, and it was beautiful! You do need to serve it at least room temp or warmer, and use a good quality truffle oil. If you like truffles, you'll love this potato salad!

Made for a big father's day dinner; rave reviews; in fact my father-in-law wanted the recipe! Do go light on the oil, but every flavor was a joy; I used a little more prosciutto.

FANTASTIC potato salad! I took it to a bbq and actually received a round of appaulse.

This recipe was pretty good, and it was a nice change from the mayo potato salads. It would even work for the VERY picky eaters who don't like mayo, mustard, or vinegar (all standard salad ingredients). I think that the slices of potatoes look nice, but are not very nice to eat, so next time I'll be dicing them. I will also cook the potatoes for a lot longer to ensure that that they're soft, rather than crunchy.

This turned out horrible. The truffle oil was so overwhelming that I had to toss it out. I think next time, I'll cut the oil way down and add gradually. I think 1 tablespoon is too much. I would make it again though as all the other flavors are wonderful.

My daughter made this for a BBQ we attended yesterday and I have to say it is among one of the best potato salads I have ever eaten. She has made it before to rave reviews from her guests, so I was anxious to try it. I wouldn't change one thing about the recipe, but have to say that the truffle oil gives it that 'edge' and is a key ingredient. I am saving it to my recipe box and will be serving it at our next picnic!

I beg to differ with the reviewer from Ohio. I didn't find anything heavy about it. The Yukon potatoes are creamy tasting and there is very little oil in the recipe. My sister-in-law made this for her house- warming party last weekend. It was a smash and was gobbled up quickly. It's so darn good that I am making it for a party tomorrow.

This was awful. Heavy and greasy, yuck. Too many heavy flavors. Had to throw it in the trash.

People always request that I bring this dish to pot lucks/bbqs! LOVE it!

I simplify this by using bacon and omitting the truffle oil, but I do crave it - the chicken stock makes it so tasty and rick. I've made this many times, even in winter!

good flavors but not worth the trouble and expense

Have made this salad many times especially for my son who is lactose intolerant. Without mayo or sour cream it has become a family favorite! The truffle oil is a must!

Made this last night for company to accompany steaks on the grill, fresh green beans with hot pepper relish (from here) and was disappointed. Great ingredients - just okay.

I have made this four times now and love it! I too, like the fact that you don't have to use mayo!

This was a great accompaniment to our grilled steaks.......agree served warm or room temp was better, and the next day it was even better after the flavors developed!

Made this weekend for an outdoor party, so it was served at room temp. It was just ok, everyone liked it, but it seemed sort of disjointed to me. I might make again in the winter & serve hot/warm & see if that helps.

This was a great potato salad recipe - my favorite this summer. I've made it about 4 times, and every time I love it more!

Excellent recipe. I made it exactly as written. I especially like that you don't need mayo or a lot of oil - the chicken broth gives it a great taste & texture. This salad is definitely better served warm - I heated up the leftovers the next day and they were excellent!

This was an outstanding potato salad! I used new unskinned red potatoes, which added a nice colour contrast to this indulgent dish. It was the perfect accompaniment to grilled steaks on a warm summer evening.

The picture looked very enticing and the list of ingredients were wonderful to make this special, however, the salad was found wanting in my opinion, it was nothing special at all.

This was excellent - made it for a dinner party where the main course was steak on the grill and it got raves. A wonderful change from heavy potato salads, the trick is not to overcook the potatoes, so be sure to keep testing them. I doubled the recipe so I'd be sure to have leftover and it kept well for two days but is definitely best served room temperature!

This potato salad should be the eighth wonder of the world. How can you go wrong with fried crispy prosciutto and truffle oil? The truffle oil marries perfectly with the lemon juice to make a rich yet light dressing. The celery and crispy prosciutto add a yummy, perfect crunch, and the chives and onions give just the right kick. The recipe is easy to follow and quick, even in my tiny kitchen. I used spring onions out of my garden instead of Maui Onions. I could also see using a smaller potato, perhaps fingerlings. However, it is perfect the way it is: a simple yet complex delight.
