If this is a place for reviews, aren't we suppose to make the exact recipe and review it? I get confused and frustrated when so mant people change the recipe and then tell you about their own version. Maybe I'm being too literal but it happens every time i hit on the word review.

I made this recipe twice now. The first time I couldn't find celery root, so I subbed turnip and a few stalks of celery. It came out very tasty. The second time around I was able to find celery root and it was equally great and had a bit deeper flavor. I can't speak to the biscuits as I have to admit I took the easy route and didn't have the time to make them.

Very good recipe. Addition of white wine set flavors off. Substantial and delicious. I cut biscuits with heart- shaped cookie cutter, very good.

We followed instructions and ingredients exactly and it was truly delicious. Definitely recommend and will definitely make again.

The biscuits made the recipe, so I would not skip that step. They made the presentation perfect, and they were crispy, and flaky making the perfect accompaniment for the soup.

This was awesome. I used breast meat instead of thighs, but used bone-in, skin-on and prepared them as per the recipe. I cut back the amount of carrots a bit, and added 2 cloves of garlic, and omitted the rosemary. I would love to try this with tarragon next time. I added a few mushrooms and kale, not because it needed it, just because I wanted to use them up, and they were a nice addition. The biscuits were delicious but I would tweak the recipe next time...I also found the buttermilk needed to be increased and I would add some baking soda I think...they were pretty flat and a bit tough, as I overworked the dough because of its dryness...but they were delicious.

Not at all worth all of the steps, try this instead: 2 cans cream of chicken soup. Using soup can, measure 1 1/2 can of milk. 1 lb. bag frozen peas and carrots. 3 to 4 chicken, breasts (cooked and diced). 1 pkg. refrigerated biscuits. Combine first 4 ingredients, simmer 30 minutes. Prepare biscuits as label says. Spoon chicken mixture over biscuits. Salt and pepper to taste. yer DONE !

I only made the chicken soup. Not too difficult to make. It was really delicious and had an excellent chicken and white wine flavor. However, after my second bowl I thought it was too rich, maybe too much butter. I still highly recommend it for an simple meal!

This soup with the celery root is absolutely delicious. The recipe is not difficult. I used homemade chicken broth. The only reason I gave it three forks is that the biscuit recipe has some problems. I needed a full cup of buttermilk in order to properly moisten the dough and because biscuit dough should only be minimally handled, I worried the biscuits would be tough (they were not). I do use thick buttermilk from a creamery in N Georgia and that may have meant that with thinner buttermilk from a grocery store, only 3/4 cup would be needed. Also as a Southern woman who has made biscuits all my life, I've never met a biscuit that needs 25 - 30 minutes at 400 degrees. These were done in 15 minutes and would have been ruined if I had left them in for the prescribed time. Overall I loved the recipe and will make it again.
