This was very good. I used it as a sauce for grilloed salmon.

One of a variety of sauces I made for a fondue party. This went particularly well with the chicken and shrimp cooked in a court bouillon. Not my favorite, but many people like the sweet taste on savory dishes.

I am usually not a fan of sweet sauces, but I thought I'd give this a try anyhow. Glad I did, it was the perfect accompaniment for panko-crusted chicken cutlets. I added about a tbl. of sirachi for some heat.

This sauce was way too sweet so I added more ginger, soy sauce and hot stuff. It still tasted terrible! I fed it to a large group who were drinking lots of wine. I don't think they noticed.

I followed the recipe exactly and doubled the batch, then added another teaspoon of soy sauce and another two teaspoons of lime juice. I heated it on low just until warm, then put in a couple of garlic cloves and let it sit for twenty minutes or so. I removed the garlic, added a scant tablespoon of Sriracha sauce for some heat, brought it to a boil and then back to a simmer until it was time to serve. I had it over plain grilled chicken breast and basmati rice. Fabulous!

I used the apricot-pineapple preserves, added extra ginger & extra lime juice. Excellent dipping sauce for wontons, and such a beautiful color, too!

Great sauce. I used it in a chicken salad with celery, mandarin oranges, slivered almonds and chinese noodles. Big hit. But I did add some Roasted Sesame Oil (1-2 tsp).

This is a tasty, tasty sauce! I prepared some for a tasting of crispy rice-coated cod strips at my work (a seafood manufacturing company), and it was a hit! The sweetness of the preserves is nicely counterpointed by the soy and mustard. I did add more ginger, almost tripling it, since it seemed to need a little extra zing. Great dip for breaded seafood; I'd like to try it with chicken next.

This recipe is easy and delicious. My boyfriend does not like ginger so I left out the ginger & water, added more mustard and it was still delicous.

You can also make this with dried apricots- use 10-15 and simmer in about 1 cup water- reduce and add more water as needed, until they become soft and almost the consistency of jam (about an hour). Then blend and return to sauce pan with other ingredients. It's excellent with crushed chili peppers if you like spicy food. You might need to add a little more lime and mustard than the recipe calls for.

like another reviewer, i also used apricot-pineapple jam. i grated the ginger and added a bit more than what the recipe called for. i heated everything in a small saucepan but did not bother to blend it. it's fine slightly 'chunky'.

This was so easy and so good! I heated it slightly and served over risotto cakes as an appetizer. I added a bit more ginger. I think it would be terrific over chicken or pork tenderloin.

Made this with the Shrimp Sesame sticks. I doubled the recipe and glad I did. People went "dunking" crazy. Leftovers, if any, would be great on chicken or deep fried fish.

It is a great dipping saucing for alot of asian inspired items. I use apricot pinapple jam.

I made this to accompany the Shrimp and Sesame Sticks and thought it was just a bit too sweet. But once I added more lime juice and mustard, it hit the spot! I'll definitely make it again, and the next time add a pinch of cayenne as well.

I used this sauce as a marinade for chicken and it was very nice. I added some red pepper for some zing!
