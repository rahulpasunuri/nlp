I am a complete nut for real Maple syrup. Just about anything maple. This recipe is amazing! The sour cream - walnut filling is superb and the glaze brings it all together very nicely. This is a great recipe and easy to do. Everyone flipped out over it and is a new favorite. Definitely put this on your to do list!

I am playing with this recipe. I've used Agave nectar in place of maple syrup, lower in glycemic index; I've replaced maple sugar w/light brown sugar (though I think it would work w/ half light brown sugar, half sugar in the raw/turbanado; I've replaced 1/4 of the flour w/almond flour & another 1/4 of the flour w/coconut flour; i've added a generous splash of half n half (about a 1/4 cup); I've mixed the cinnamon mixture w/ a combo of: 1/8 tsp cardomom, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, pinch of mace, & 1/8 tsp of cinnamon. I always sift the flour. comes out very moist. I generously butter the ring pan w/butter and lightly flour the pan. I use a aluminum ring pan, as the light colored pan produces a golden cake. The 1st time I made this I only substituted the maple sugar w/light brown sugar & coworkers were swooning over the cake.

This one is a keeper. I used it for my sister's wedding cake: she lived in Arizona where lemons grow, and he was from Vermont, home of maple. And everyone loved it, even those who didn't decode the symbolism.

mmmm! Delicious. But I really used the wrong ingredients... I thought it read maple syrup when in fact it said maple sugar. Can't believe that it turned out perfect but it did. The glaze is fantastic too but i added a bit more lemon peel

I looked all over for the maple sugar and found it - quite expensive but I *love* maple. The cake didn't make the best of my expensive ingredients. Came out a bit dry and not really mapley.

Good cake, really easy to make. I used brown suger as I couldn't find Maple Suger (and I live in Canada). I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp allspice. I used a glaze of sour cream and maple syrup alas I had no lemon...:( This cake is light and moist, not too sweet. A winner in my my books looking forward to eating it tomorrow for breakfast...if it lasts that long. Wonderful :)

I take it back. I will make this cake again. It is very tasty - even without the lemon glaze. It seems I can't keep from enjoying a piece of it every day.:-)

This is a good tasting cake, easy to make. However, I shall not bake it again. The best tasting sour cream coffee cake is the sour cream-streusel coffee cake at http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/5807. That coffee cake is so good, my husband has asked for it for his birthday cake.

Everyone in my family loves this cake. It has become a tradition on the Thanksgiving dessert table. A side note, I use raisins instead of nuts.

I love maple, but I thought this cake was too heavy-textured and too sweet. The lemon glaze also seemed gratuitous and didn't really provide the foil for the sweetness I was looking for. Perhaps I made it badly, but I don't think I'll give this one another try.

This is an excellent recipe. I will keep this recipe in my repetoire. It is a moist and delicious cake.

Wowza! So so delicious. the texture is moist and perfect. i actually just made a simple sheet cake with the batter and didn't add the layer of walnuts and it is absolutely delcious. Go for the maple sugar if you can find it. Next time will try the cake all dressed up with glaze and walnut layer, but know that it's great just simple.

This was a good cake but trying to find maple sugar was way too much trouble. I found it through mail order and the cost was chokingly expensive. I may make it again but having made it both ways, I will stick to cane sugar or maybe raw sugar

I can't imagine what else you would want in a "coffee" cake. This was perfect. Moist, delicious, warm and cozy. I didn't search too hard for the maple sugar (I used dark brown sugar) but next time I will either look at Whole Foods or order it, just to see what it tastes like made as written.

Excellent cake, very good texture and it's nicely moist. I used a 12 cup Bundt pan but next time would use a 9 or 10 cup to give a higher cake, smaller in diameter. It was done in about 51 minutes. Didn't make the glaze, just brushed the cake with 3 tablespoons melted butter whisked with 3 tablespoons maple syrup. And I scattered half a cup of chopped nuts (in addition to the nuts in the filling) over the bottom of the Bundt pan so they topped the cake after it was baked.

Fabulous, fabulous. Perfect. I have searched through countless recipes and web sites for a cake with this texture. i was springy, spongy and so light. execellent. i used raisins instead or walnut. didn't do the glaze so i can't comment on it. and since i did not have all the sourcream used yogurt to make up for the rest. rest assured i will be using the recipe for years to come.

Very tasty and moist, but had trouble finding maple sugar. BOught an 8oz bag, which wasn't enough, so used brown sugar in filling, and @1TBL granulated sugar in cake. PROBLEM: filling disappeared - Is is suppose to?? and cake stuck completely around tube. Thought it was done, maybe not. Next time I'll cook longer and use a 9" square tube pan, used Kugelkopf this time.

I've made this cake twice and thoroughly enjoyed it. I did not make the glaze the second time as I thought it overpowered the flavors and the cake does not need the additional sweetness. The second time I made the cake in individual bundt molds and they turned out wonderfully moist. The guest they were served to loved them. A definate keeper.

Since I keep kosher and made the cake to serve with a meat meal, I had to use non-dairy ingredients in the recipe. Even with non-dairy margarine and Tofutti-brand (non-dairy) "Better Than Sour Cream," the cake was excellent. I also used pecans instead of walnuts, because I like them better, but that's just an issue of personal preference.
