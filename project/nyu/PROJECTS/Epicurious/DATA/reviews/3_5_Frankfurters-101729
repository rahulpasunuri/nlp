The blue cheese and grated onion is wonderful. Secure bacon with toothpicks. Cook over a very hot grill, turning constantly. When the bacon is done, remove toothpicks and you're good to go.

All good ideas for making changes to the beloved hotdog. I added diced onion to the first one and it made it even better.
