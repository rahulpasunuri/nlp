Really good, but no Cosi tomato soup (that's my favorite). This is less sweet and tastes more creamy. That's flavor, not texture - I could really taste the heavy cream. Not in a bad way, but I'd probably reduce the amount of cream if I made it again. I didn't use any milk - I liked the thickness, but the soup was thick with just the tomatoes. I think fresh spinach and fresh basil really punch it up. Simple. Tasty. Easy. Good.

I was sceptical after reading the reviews but I had not much else to cook with so I gave it a go. Subed all the butter for olive oil and double cream for the whipping one and used no milk. I like thick soups. It was good!

I was looking for a quick tomato soup recipe to go with sandwiches. I used one can of tomatoes, doubled the oregano and basil and added a large clove of minces garlic (because of other reviews -- I didn't want bland), and used a whole onion and 1/2 cup whipping cream. I thinned it with a very little water. We liked it a lot. I would add paprika or some other pepper next time.

this was really bland and more like a sauce than a soup.

I added a few splashes of sherry at the end and pureed the entire soup. Instead of parm, sprinkled aged provolone on top. I think the sherry really helped.

It was only ok. Nothing special. It was not bad but I wouldn't make it again.

Another keeper. The family member who is not fond of tomato soup had seconds!

This soup is becoming a "comfort food" in our house -- great for those cold winter weeknights when we want something warm and satisfying. I make it with the Parmesan Wafers also found on this site (they are to-die-for!).

Great flavors and easy to make. Use fresh tomatoes in season pureed in the blender for an even fresher taste. Fresh spinach works too.

Absolutely delicious. Everyone at our dinner party loved it and wanted the recipe. Used fresh spinach and San Marzano tomatoes--definitely worth the extra couple of bucks.

The whipping cream is better to use. We tried with all milk the first time and it was a bit grainy in texture. The next time we used the cream and it was much smoother. My husband likes this soup so much he actually offers to cut the onion just so I'll make it for him!

A good basic soup... revised the following to make it healthier: (1) TBL butter only with a bit of olive oil, 2% milk instead of whipping cream, fresh spinach and tomatoes. Also, I added garlic and then pureed the entire soup with a stick blender.

Very, very good. I agree with the cook about fresh versus frozen spinach. I used fresh and it was delicious. Quick and easy.

I added even more chicken stock b/c i enjoy a thinner soup. Easy to make, but would probably add more basil / spices to suit my taste next time...

This was so so good and so easy! i halved the amount of tomatoes, but kept everything else the same - it is chunky but deliciuos. also added a garlic clove and used 2 scallions instead of onion. i will make this many times!

Snowed-in and desiring a vegetable soup , I searched for recipes to utilize what I had on hand - fresh spinach. I added a little vegetable broth with the cream, and tore the spinach into nice-sized pieces before adding it. Served with homemade focaccia and freshly grated Parmesan cheese, it was delicious.

Absolutely wonderful! Tantalizing flavors! Next time I'll have to double it because my husband ate most of it. To the folks (who didn't bother to read the whold recipe)the soup can be thinned to the desired consistency with milk. I used cream myself.

I love this soup because it is so fast, easy and flavorful. I do not use milk or cream because of lactose problems and instead use either veg or chicken broth. Throw in spinach, kale, collard greens or whatever is on hand and maybe even some small pasta and there you have a healthy soup/meal in a minute. season well with salt and pepper - don't be shy.

This was very thick - I didn't use the milk option, but will need to thin it a bit. It was very tasty and a hit for everyone in the family. It's nutritious and I will definitely make this again in the near future!

My husband and I prepared this soup for a large function - it was a big sucess. It is thick! We cut it with extra broth and half & half. We are still receiving request for the recipe.

This dish turned out delicious for my family & I!! What I recommend (which worked for me) is to use 6 fresh tomatos & puree is food processor with 2 cups of water & salt to taste. Proceed with directions & when sauteeing (sp?) onions add 1 clove of minced garlic. Omit the milk serving. At the end, mix in good helping of can parmesan cheese in the pot. This turned out wonderful & was not thick at all. It was nice smooth, creamy texture. If you really want to perfect the taste, re-heat & serve the next day. YUMMMMY!!!!! To describe the dish based on tastes...if you love creamy soups, tomato soups, the taste of spinach & onions then this is the soup for YOU!!

My spoon stood straight up in the middle of my soup dish - this was the thickest soup I've ever seen and this is after adding at least a couple of cups of extra milk. Might be good for pasta but I'm not sure!

very simple and tasty soup. good way to use up extra spinach. I had extra fresh spinach I wanted to use up and it worked fine. Also, used milk instead of cream (didn't have any) and the soup was still tasty. Adding a little parmesan to each bowl adds nice flavor.

This also makes a GREAT pasta sauce!

I like spinach, but this soup is too thick with this vegetable. Maybe only use a portion of the spinach called for. Otherwise it has a nice flavor.
