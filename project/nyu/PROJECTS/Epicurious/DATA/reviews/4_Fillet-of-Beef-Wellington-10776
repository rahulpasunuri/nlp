I have made this several times, with various paté mixtures (usually one from Whole Foods, made with chicken livers) and it always receives rave reviews at the dinner table. This recipe mentions beef "tied with thin sheets of larding fat". I don't do that. I use my silicon bands (like rubberbands, but food-safe, reusable, and dishwasher-safe) or kitchen twine to tie up the roast (fold the thin end toward the middle to make a uniform width). Then I sear it in a very hot pan with a bit of olive oil, let it cool slightly, remove the bands or twine, and proceed with the preparation. It holds together just fine. I do not roast it 25 minutes before wrapping in pastry; that would be overdone to most of my guests. I have never included the truffles; it's rich enough already, though I'm sure they're a nice touch. After removing it from the oven, be sure to let it sit awhile before slicing.

I have made this and everyone loves it but I always have trouble carving it. The puff pastry comes off. It is also soggy on the bottom and does not seem to get fully cooked. Any suggestions?

This was delicious. I did slight modifications. Instead of foie gras, I used duck pate as it was a fraction of the cost and I used Sherry wine for the sauce. I also added a shallot to the sauce as other reviews suggested. Garnished it with watercress which was delicious and served it with gouda and fennel scalloped potatoes and steamed white & purple asparagus. This meal was a show stopper!

What a fab Christmas dinner! Had to drive around a bit to find the foie gras, but as the other reviews indicated this was an important ingredient...we did...and it was worth it. Followed the recipe and it ended up the highlight of the meal. Was not fiddly as many complained .

I've made this for Christmas two years in a row and it's phenomenal. I roast the tenderloin and saute the mushrooms the day before, then top the beef with the foie gras and mushrooms and roll it all up on Christmas Day while the kids are napping. Have not had any problems with the standard, store-bought puff pastry. For some reason I never get too much in the way of juices after cooking the meat, so instead for sauce I just reduce the heck out of 5 cups of beef broth, 1.5 cups of port and 1 cup of brandy (plus 1T tomato paste whisked in at end). Saute one cup shallots in 3T butter, add the reduced broth, then whisk in some cold butter a bit at a time. DIVINE. This is a really impressive treat that isn't as hard as it looks.

My favorite epicurious recipe to date was filet with port and cranberries. Have been making that for years, but this beef wellington actual either ties or tops that recipe. It was beyond fabulous. It took a very long time to prepare, and after that I swore I would never make it again...until I served it. By far one of the best recipes on epicurious. The pate made the recipe as did the mushrooms. Used a mix of shitake, oyster and baby bellas. We all groaned in delight thru the meal.

I splurged and bought prime tenderloin, which was worth it. I did not roll out the puff pastry because I left it out too long and it was warm. I merely added a third of the second sheet, sealed the edges, and tried to enlarge the rectangle with my fingers. This worked surprisingly well. For the mushrooms, I added shitakes (a must), chantarelles, oyster, and button. I probably had 6 cups once all were chopped before saute. I added madiera to the mushroom mix and then after I took off the heat (once dry) I added 5 ounces of truffle mousse pate (Trader Joes). I spread this on the puff pastry, leaving two inch borders around all. I cooled and rolled the cooked meat and used the extra puff pastry to make a decorative cross-hatch pattern down the length of the pastry. Baked just until the pastry was brown and to rave reviews from my dinner guests. I used a meat thermometer to first sear/bake the meat and was a little disappointed since I didn't have the probe placed perfectly. The two ends of the beef were medium plus, but the 12 inch-long center was medium rare and perfect. My husband and I took the ends, so no one knew. Seriously good recipe.

Rating: 4
Wow, the beef turned out so tender and it was very tasty. Takes a long time to make, though. My puff pastry didn't rise during baking as much as I would have liked, and I had to take my store bought pate and whip it in the food processor to make it spreadable.

Very nice and very easy. Used mousse truffee rather than foie gras. Would definitely have made the sauce with demi glace if I'd been able to buy it or had the time to make it. Use a meat thermometer and it's hard to go wrong with this dish!

Excellent recipe however I misjudged some of the timing that others reviewed and warned about. The only real challenge was the wrapping the tenderloin in the puff pastry. This is well worth all of the work and expense as it was a real hit with all of my Christmas guests. Next time I might try individual Wellingtons as it would be that much more impressive. Like the others, I "added and improved" on the recipe by adding shaved truffles to the puff pastry dough and some of the mushroom liquid from reconstituting dried mushrooms to the duxelles. Duxelles needs to be bone dry before removing from the heat. Pastry needs to be wrapped tight around the whole tenderloin.

Only three forks because of the arrow root, use a demi-glace insead, makes a huge difference and is worth it entirely. Otherwise and wonderful method. Enjoyed reading the reviews and rants in response to foi gras. I agree that cheap factory farmed chicken is raised in an inhumane way (if you saw what they do to them you would NEVER eat chicken again)but nothing is what it appears to be (read Omnivore's Dilemma for another perspective) I was also stunned at how incredbly rude the New York cook was... after all everyone is entitled to voice their opinion, if we disagree then surely we can say so politely?

This came out PERFECT. I followed the recipe almost exactly as written, except I used truffle mousse pate instead of Foie Gras and sauteed the mushrooms in a bit of truffle olive oil. The oven sequence was absolutely perfect and the store bought frozen puff pastry in the one pound package was exactly enough to cover 1/2 of the filet. It looked beautiful to bring to the table and sliced beautifully.

Qite a lot of work, but well worth it. I served it to 9 people, which necissated cutting a fillet into 9 steaks. I seared the steaks in brandy prior to wrappin the pate/duxelles in the puff pastry. What a hit!

I'm planning on making this dish next weekend for the first time, but I have a question about the preparation. To me, it makes more sense to brown the fillet in a pan rather than in the oven, but I am not sure how to adjust the cooking times to achieve a medium rare in the end. So how long do I brown the fillet for?

I believe the name of this dish came about because the England was in conflict with France. Filet de Boeuf en croute is awesome and impressive entree. This was my maiden voyage making puff pastry dough and had great results. I omitted the pate and used a variety of mushrooms for the duxelles. Instead of pre-roasting the beef, I rubbed extra virgin olive oil and a little herbes de provence over the filet and seared in a large saute pan with clarified butter. That way, you have all the wonderful bits to make a sauce while the filet is roasting (deglaze the pan with red wine and reduce, add beef stock, season to taste and finish with beurre manier to slightly thicken it--not too thick, just enough to add some body). After I rolled the filet, I brushed with egg whites and dusted it with fresh thyme leaves. It came out superbly--my friends loved it. served pommes anna and brussels sprouts with a warm shallot and cider viniagrette.

I wanted to cook something ambitious and grand for Christmas, and this Beef Wellington definitely did the trick. Some say this dish is labor intensive, but it really wasn't that bad. I quite enjoyed the entire process. The only part I struggled with was getting the final product off the roasting pan. Next time I'll know to use something non-stick, but otherwise this was a fantastic dish for a big occasion. My guests felt special and were thoroughly delighted with it. Would definitely make it again.

This dish was a HUGE hit for a New Year's Eve dinner. It was labor intensive but worth it. I used pre-made puff pastry to save a little time. The pate was hard to find and added a nice flavor, but I don't think that next time I will view the pate as totally necessary. I used wild mushrooms including morels which added some depth to the flavor as well. Leftovers were yummy and we will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
I really enjoyed this dish. I used wild mushrooms for the duxelles, and added in some rehydrated porcini and morels in the mix which gave it an extra depth of flavor. I made a standard reduction sauce, using the trimmings from beef and homemade stock. I agree that the foie gras gives it a special flavor that's distinct to this dish. If you've got an issue with foie gras, you can use homemade chicken liver pate although it is a different flavor. However, I must note that as a professional chef and as a food writer, I've been to both farms where they raise ducks and geese for foie gras (in France and in New York) and to mass production chicken farms in the U.S. On the whole, the foie gras animals were treated far more humanely. For people truly concerned about cruel treatment of animals, I resent those who select one item to get worked up, but then proceed to eat those frozen chicken filets they sell at Wal-Mart without thinking twice. I suggest getting to everyone that he/she get informed about mass meat production in the U.S., boycott fast food establishments, selectively shop for organic or humanely treated meat in supermarket chains or preferably eat only organically produced produced by local purveyors with whom you're familiar with their treatment of animals. We do the latter as much as possible, and since it's more expensive, it means we simply eat far less meat which is probably a good thing all around. And, we also eat foie gras raised by places we know in France and New York without guilt.

Wonderful & Not Alot of Effort! I made Beef Wellington from the first Joy of Cooking... it was outstanding; but making the pate from scratch and then the duxelles... well, I was too tired to eat! (OK, I've never been too tired to eat anything in my life; but, you know what I mean!) This recipe tastes just as good... if not better, and is 1/4 the work! Wonderful presentation - everyone ooh'd and ahh'd. Absolutely delicious! The pate makes it a rich dish; but, that's the point! So, go simple with the side dishes and it will be a great and memorable meal!

This dish is FABULOUS! Just served it at a dinner party and cleared clean plates! The fois gras is a MUST! If you are not a pate eater why are you looking at/commenting on a recipe for Beef Wellington! If it weren't for the fois gras the dish would be missing something. As for the sauce, I actually forgot about it until halfway through the meal. While it was tasty I found it totally unnecessary; the dinner was faboulous without it. I highly reccomend this recipe; everything can be prepared ahead, and if you cheat and foil line the roasting pan (because there is no gravy) clean up is a snap! ENJOY!!!!

I'm with the cook from Germany. I think the cook from MA expressed a valid opinion in a mature and concise way. I love Beef Wellington and I love Foi Gras but I can understand why people might object to how it is produced. It's like veal or meat or anything else for that matter-- people are allowed to pick what they do and do not want to eat for themselves. That being said; I've had this with foi gras and I've had it with chicken livers. It's good both ways (don't get me wrong, it's better with the foi gras) but if you just can't use the foi gras then don't.

I've made this recipe before with pretty yummy results, but I agree with the reviewer who commented on the unnecessary degree of complexity of this recipe (both as to ingredients and processes). I'm doing a Wellington cooking class tomorrow and am going over my 3 favorite recipes to come up with a good amalgamation for my clients, which made me scrutinize this recipe a little more than when I used it for my own purposes. Now, I know how to wrap a Wellington, but did anyone else read the following from this recipe and think this might be an unwieldy proposition for a Wellington newbie (read: WTF?!). (Pardon my English.) "On a floured surface roll 1 pound of the puff paste into a rectangle about 20- by 12- inches, or large enough to enclose the fillet completely, invert the coated fillet carefully under the middle of the dough, and fold up the long sides of the dough to enclose the fillet brushing the edges of the dough with some of the egg white to seal them. Fold ends of the dough over the fillet and seal them with the remaining egg white."

The official wellington recipe calls for porcini mushrooms, slices of foie gras (not pate) and a port veal demi glace with freshly shaved black alba truffles. But in a pinch this is good. Arrowroot? I agree with the chef from NYC that if you have demi glace you would not need to use the dreadful thickening agent. You can make it yourself too and it really is not that hard and is great to have around at ALL TIMES. Get 4 lbs of veal bones and 4 lbs of beef bones and vegs at the supermarket and boil it down...

After I read the reviews that referenced the "Cambridge" writer, I was expecting a vicious rant by a animal rights extremist. When I actually read the review by the Cambridge cook, I concluded that it was simply one person's concise fact-based opinion. What I can't understand is the number of attacks by other reviewers on this person's opinion on an ingredient used in a recipe. Surely there are countless debates about other ingredients on this board, so why should a question about how the ingredient is derived be excluded from our conversation? I would imagine that if a recipe for dog or rat appeared - two dishes quite common in parts of Asia - that some folks may have some concerns about how the main ingredients were obtained. BTW, I made this dish without the foie gras to very satisfied diners.

Nice to do an old standby again. I used Ottawa's suggestion of two pieces of puff paste rather than a wrap-around, it made for a very attractive presentation. Warning to the squeamish: I cooked the beef to 140 degrees just to be safe, and it was still medium-rare red in the center, though the meat felt medium. My wife ate both ends! The canned bloc de foie gras works great, it's already a paste and the foie gras doesn't play a strong enough part to justify buying fresh. Also skipped the "larding fat." When's the last time you saw *that* in a recipe? Good, classic dish.

Rating: 4
Some other options - to avoid bruising or crushing the puff pastry, roll out the dough into 2 rectangles - one about a third longer and wider than the other. The smaller rectangle must be at least 6 inches longer and wider than your piece of fillet. Put the smaller rectangle on the baking sheet, place the duxelle, beef and foi gras on top, brush the edges of the dough with egg wash then gently drape the larger rectangle over the meat. Seal the layers of pastry together by pressing with the tines of a fork. Decorate the top and trim the edges of the pastry into an oval, rectangle or whatever shape you choose (perhaps a fish, if you really what to surprise your guests). By not handling the pastry as much, the top layer puffs up more and provides a more spectacular presentation when the baked wellington is sliced. Cut a small vent hole in the top - hidden among the decor - so that excess steam can escape and the pastry comes out dry and flaky, not soggy.

Wow is this a fancy recipe! I've gone "all out" and made it exactly as written, and it comes out great! You can really make the presentation exceptionally nice with the scraps of puff pastry. However, if you're in a hurry or poor (or if you have "MORAL ISSUES" with the foie gras!) the you can take ordinary pate (the mousse version works better) and coat the beef with that and coat it with puff pastry. As for the Cambridge writer... you have no right to comment on a recipe you haven't tried. My only hesitation in referencing you is that it brings you and your inappropriate comment attention you do not deserve!

Loved this.Couldn't find truffles or truffle oil.Couldn't find Sercial Madeira in our town so used what was suggested by the sales person.Because of the lack of suggested ingreds the sauce was not very good-using a beef demi-glaze with the wellington would have been better. Even so;everyone was pleased. This was my first Wellington and very easy to do.The hardest thing was deciding what to use "in place of" ingreds.I found the reviews to be just the thing. Realizing other people had like problems, gave me courage to forge ahead. Many Thanks everyone! Carol Bain ,Redding Ca.

This is a forum for whether food is good or not....next we'll be seeing opinions about how morally corrupt it is to eat veal, lamb, venison etc. ENOUGH already!!!!

What a wonderful tasting showpiece this is!! I found different versions of it in my cookbooks but decided to use this one.(not to the letter though). Eye fillet is amazingly cheap in Kenya at 4 dollars a kilo!! 1.2 kgs served 10 quite comfortably with some left over. I made my own pate the day before and used the rest as an in- between course after the soup. I used plain olive oil instead of larding. I made shiitake mushroom sauce to go with it. Served it with braised baby onions, plain boiled carrots and beans and another side dish of mixed veggies in white sauce. I cut out leaves from left-over pastry and arranged these on a central "stalk" over the length of the pastry. I am still glowing from all the compliments!!!!grin.

The recipe is great, although it is often difficult to find black truffles in less than urban areas. The frozen pastry sheets are so much easier to work with! For mushrooms, I use baby portabellas.

For my very first dinner party for 6 on Yule, I made this. Now I have been elected to make this every YEAR! At first I was really put off by the "rawness" of the meat. But a tenderloin just barely heated has such incredible flavor that to cook it longer would kill it! I now follow the exact timing and it comes out perfect everytime. As other cooks have mentioned I use a bit of shallot and wine to make the duxelle. It takes about 20-30 minutes to cook dry, but very worth the time! As for finicky guests, if they don't like a meal, they don't have to eat it or they can cook it themselves. When I cook, unless a certain ingredient will actually put you in the emergency room, you better smile and eat it with no comment. There is nothing I hate more then people who nitpick over ingredients of a recipe. Foi Gras (sp) is fatty liver. Tenderloin of beef is fatless. You don't have to lavish it on thickly. You only want to cover the meat so that the fat will be absorbed into the meat to give it extra flavor. No-one will ever know if you used goose or chicken/pork, although the goose does taste so much better. Since I couldn't find truffles, I've used green onions in the sauce and my guests love it. I also serve this with twice baked potatoes, so everything is ready ahead of time and all I have to do is heat and serve! And if you want to read some hilarious reviews, check out the Tarragon Lobster Salad! Four pages of people fighting over live lobsters or hot dog buns.

I've 2 things to say: 1) this is an excellent recipe, by far one of the best I've tryed for this particular dish. If you wish to lighten it up a bit, use phyllo dough instead of puff paste-it works well and tastes great. 2) For those of you with moral qualms about foie gras, all I ask is that you keep in mind that several millions of people eat a great deal of food a day, and dont "move freely" (that is, exersize), and they are quite happy. So lighten up a little bit;)

the foie gras made all the difference in the dish as for the texture and moisture content. Although I was a bit skeptical of the gras, it really was good. Hepatic lipidosis?

I've been making this dish every Christmas for the past 5 years for 20 or more family members, children included. I don't use the pate because some are finicky. So I use a mushroom duxell instead.
