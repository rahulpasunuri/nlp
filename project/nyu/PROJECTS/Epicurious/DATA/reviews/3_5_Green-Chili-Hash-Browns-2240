Great comfort food and so easy. This is soooo good. I used lite sour cream and a combination of reduced fat and regular sharp cheddar.I thought the chicken soup sounded odd but you wouldn't even know it was in there.Nice conbination of creamy and crispy.

This gets 4 fork due to ratio easy/deliciousness. i used cheddar/jack combo, I added some garlic, and half chopped onion. I divided into 2 shallow baking dishes. A little crispy outside, soft and luscious inside. Make this!

This was really liked in my house. My husband doesn't really like chilis, so I just put some scallion instead. Added garlic as recommended by other reviewers. Will make again...

This is a great husband pleaser. I added 1/2 chopped onion, one chopped garlic clove and about 1 1/2 cups cooked, cubed chicken. For the cheese, I used equal amounts of mozzarella and cheddar. I cooked it at 350 degrees for one hour, then topped it with a little additional cheese and cooked until melted. Delish!

This easy-to-make hash brown casserole is tasty, although a little bland. If I make it again, I'd either add more green chiles or some cayenne pepper.

Excellent dish! Cheap, easy, and tasty. We added 1/2 of a can of jalepenos to give it a little more kick. Next time we will add shredded roasted chicken for an entree.

This is a great brunch recipe. I've made it half a dozen times. Adding a smidge of salt is important. I've never had any sticking problems, and I think this dish is rich enough not to need the extra butter. I regularly add more chile, and spread extra cheese on top. The last time I made this, I fried up some bacon and crumbled it in-- delicious!

Easy. Would recommend melting about three tablespoons of butter in the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking and to richen the flavor. I skipped the chiles as my guests were notoriously finicky. I have a friend who makes a similar casserole, but uses one stick butter and two cups of low fat sour cream. My friend's version is much better though certainly more fattening!

Works well for a crowd and/or picky eaters.
