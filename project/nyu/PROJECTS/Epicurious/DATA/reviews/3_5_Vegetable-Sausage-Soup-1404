Delicious fall soup! Big hit with my kids! In the tradition of meddling home cooks I substituted fennel for the mushrooms and cannellini beans for the chickpeas. Also used a full bottle of beer, added Parmesan and ditalini. Yum!

I made this forgetting the beer, and with Tofurky Sausage, as my husband and I are vegetarians, and it was delicious! My husband actually my husband ate most of it he liked it so much. Very warm for the beginning of these autumn months!

Delicious! Would like broth thicker. Next time I'll double up on the vegetable and beans!

I made this twice using two different kinds of sausage and both times it was very average. There are so many better recipes for sausage soup out there. I won't make this again.

This was wonderful! I can never leave a recipe alone, so I substituted small white beans for the garbanzos (my personal preference), and added a bit of pesto in each bowl along with freshly grated parmesan before serving. Wow...rave reviews and definitely a keeper. Thanks for this great website...use it several times a week and it's a big help to read what the other cooks have to say.

This is just what I was looking for to use up some hot Italian sausage. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used all fresh herbs and ran out of onions so I used shallots instead. I think next time I will experiment with more vegetables. This is a great basic soup with a nice slightly spicy kick. Best of all chopping included the whole thing whipped together in 45 min.

Awesome soup! As others said, I nixed the water and doubled the beer. Pretty scrumpy!!

The recipe is okay, but the basic idea is a good place to experiment from. My changes: 1 lb turkey/basil/sun-dried tomato sausage instead of hot (drain grease before sauteing onions), a quart of home-canned tomatoes, pureed, 3 cups chicken stock, and 1/2 cup of red wine instead of beer. After the carrots are just tender, I add a big handful of coarse chopped napa cabbage, and simmer 10 minutes. I also use a mixture of Italian herbs, a spoon of pesto from my freezer, and add some parm. when I serve.

I found this soup delicious when I added some red peppers to give it a little more oomph. I will serve it to FRIENDS.

At a soup tasting party, this was the favorite of those who like spicy dishes. It was a little hot for the others. Maybe half sweet and half hot would be a better combination for our group.

This recipe is truly delicious and the best part is that it is so simple as well. Please try it - I guarantee that you will not be disappointed :)

Quick and easy but not nearly as good, to be honest, as the Italian Sausage and Tortellini Soup recipe that was in Bon Apetit back in the early 1990's and which I've been making since then. It's on this website -- do try it and compare.

As I dislike sage, I substituted marjoram. The result was easy and delicious. Tonight I'll probably try some of the leftover soup spooned over steamed rice to make a heartier meal.

Delicious and easy to make. We substituted shaved parmasian cheese for the parsley garnish with wonderful results!

Great flavor. Nice break from all the soups with a cream base. I roasted my hot sausage first in the oven, then sliced it into the soup, otherwise kept it the same. Easy recipe.

An outstanding, flavorful soup! I substituted small macaroni for the garbanzo beans and omitted the sage. I would add more carrots next time, too. Delicious served with a bit of fresh grated parmesan and garlic toast!

.I subsituted canneloni beans instead of garbanzo AND used dark beer instead of water and got rave reviews. I also found that if you use sweet sausage and pass around crushed red peppers for the people that like a little bada-bing in the soup you 'llmake everyone happy

Very tasty - because of personal preferences, I substituted/added the following: In place of the beans, added small elbow macaroni; I liked the idea of some heat by using hot sausage, but didn't want to ruin the dish with too much, so used sweet Italian sausage only and added several dashes of Cholula hot sauce (then passed around the bottle for those that wanted more heat); lastly, topped it off with crumbled Cotilla cheese and crusty French bread on the side. Yum!

We loved the soup. I did put in black beans instead of the ones called for.

THIS IS GREAT!! Actually it deserves a 3-1/2 fork rating. I made a double batch to feed a group and I could have eaten it all myself! I used half sweet and half hot Italian sausage, homemade beef stock in lieu of water, both portobello and button mushrooms, and added extra garbanzo beans. The beer added an extra "layer" of flavor. I used fresh herbs from the garden and a healthy sprinkling of hot red pepper flakes for a kick. WOW! I think I'll try a bowl sprinkled with imported Romano. Quick and easy to put together.

Because I do not like chickpeas, I substituted 3/4 cup raw barley simmered in chicken stock for one+ hour. I also substituted stock and/or water for the beer. I used hot rather than sweet sausage. Everything else I followed exactly. This is without a doubt, the best vegetable soup my husband and I have ever eaten. As a matter of fact, I did not get to freeze any leftovers!

I Have made this recipe many times and it is very good. It is easy to make and very filling. Many people have asked for this recipe. However, using the spicy sausage makes it a little too spicy.
