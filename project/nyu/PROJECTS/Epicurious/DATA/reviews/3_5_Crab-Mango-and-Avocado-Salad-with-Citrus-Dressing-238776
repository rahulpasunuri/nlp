I made this with a couple of changes, and it was still very good. I didn't have mango or lettuce on hand, and I used imitation crab in place of real crab. It was delicious! The recipe needs a dash of something spicy (I used red pepper flakes), but other than that, it's great as is. If you want to cut costs, imitation crab (the stuff in california rolls) works very well in this dish. Definitely making it again.

Made it without crab as light appetizer for mexican meal. It was delicious and refreshing. Love the citrus dressing.

Made this as an appetizer for my mother's birthday. It is light and refreshing and the flavors mix very well. Would definitely make it again.

Wow...I can't believe how simple & easy this was! And the flavors are pure joy. Even the 8 yr old prounounced it fanatastic. Will add to the weekly rotation. Used frozen mango because ya can't get truly fresh mangos here in Denver.

Sauteed prawns to replace crab. Loved it! Simple, but easily good enough to serve to guests.

Excellent. Left out the lettuce and added bell pepper, jicama, and bean sprouts. Cubed all of the veggies and the mango instead of slicing them. Added lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Delicious and great the next day too

I always make this as a side salad for lemon grilled chicken and cous cous sans the crab. Great dressing that isn't too oily. Would be stellar with crab too no doubt. Looks good too since the lettuce serves as little cups for the fruit and onion.

my boyfriend and i both agreed that the dressing was bland, even when i tried doctoring it with extra lime juice, garlic and cayenne. i added balsamic vinaigrette, after which the salad was nice and fresh, strawberries were a great addition, as well as roasted sunflower seeds for crunch.

I have made this many times (although only once as the recipe states). Strawberries are also good, add jalapeno. Since I am lazy, a raspberry vinegrette is fantastic on it instead of making this citrus dressing. mmmmm

i made this on ladies camping weekend. Made the dressing before leaving home. Quick, easy, and was a hit! Have made it a few times. Will try the variations.

This is one terrific recipe. I added in extra crab meat as my market had crab legs on sale. I'll make this one again and again.

Quick, easy, and delicious. I added a tablespoon of chopped garlic and a shot of cayenne pepper to the dressing, used king crab instead of lump meat, and used baby spinach instead of Boston lettuce. A great weekday meal.

This is a delicious and lovely party dish. I added, as suggested, sweet chili sauce and cayenne, added one more avocado as well, and the compliments just keep coming! I also thought that it feeded more than 4 people - closer to six, over a bed of greens.

I love this dish. It's simple to make and such an interesting combination on ingredients. I use king crab leg meat. I had a party last week and served the salad as a starter in martini glasses. My guests could not stop talking about this salad.

Substitute fresh grapefruit sections for the mango (or orange...hold the honey) and the recipe works; otherwise the combination of ingredients don't mesh.

I love all of the ingrediants on thier own, they just don't work together. used dungeoness crab, cut the honey and added garlic and cayenne, it just didn't work.

Loved it - have made it twice in one week. Bought a couple of king crab legs on sale. I did add a little cayenne pepper to the dressing.

Rating: 4
I thought this was great. I made it as a meal one night. My husband loved it. He's not much of a "salad for dinner" type but it was a hit and surprisingly filling. I omitted the honey and used one small mango...otherwise it would have been too sweet for my taste.

Delicious and perfect for summer. I made extra dressing and was glad I did. Next time I'll make it without the meat.

Simple and delicious. Can't wait to make it with some fresh, sweet Maine crabmeat. A keeper.

This was a nice fresh way to use crab. A very summery recipe. I would definitely make it again. I used spinach instead of Boston lettuce and the whole combo was quite lovely.

The crab meat, avocado and mango go very well together; however, the dressing was not exciting enough. I would add more lime juice and a touch of salt and pepper next time.

It was good (hence 2 stars) but not a 4 star recipe .. it was fast so that's a bonus.. would not make again..

I agree with the previous viewers. IThe dressing needs a little "something". I added cayenne pepper and minced garlic. This salad is very light and refreshing.

Outstanding salad. One thing I will do differently next time is use larger crab pieces. The kind you get from a container in the store just don't work well. I am going to use meat from King Crab legs next time. I also think this would work well with steamed shrimp instead of crab.

Tasty, fresh and wonderfully "summer"- like, this recipe is already the bomb in my outdoor entertaining aresenal after only 10 days of having the July issue in hand. I've substituted fresh dungeness crab, and it's terrifically juicy and sweet, and more than holds its own with the exotic mango and the rich avocado. My suggestion -- add a little freshed minced or granulated garlic, and consider a dash or two of sweet chili sauce or some cayenne, just to pique la langue, as the French would say. This is a terrific dish!

I thought this was just ok. I think I would have prefered the dressing with a little lemon in it or something. It needed something acidic.

Perfect for a hot summer lunch or as a salad before dinner. I'm making it again for guests as a starter for dinner. I used backfin instead of lump and shallots instead of onion. YUM!!!
