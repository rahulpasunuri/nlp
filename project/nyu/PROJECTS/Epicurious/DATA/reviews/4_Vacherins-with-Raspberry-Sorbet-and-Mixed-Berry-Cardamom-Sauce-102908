A deliscious use for left over egg whites. My "cups" didn't look as lovely as the picture; a bit lopsided. The sauce is lovely.

My family were impressed. This was easy to make although the cooking time is long. I did it all in one day, however. Let the meringues cool for an hour or so and they were fine to use after that. This would be perfect for Valentines Day.
