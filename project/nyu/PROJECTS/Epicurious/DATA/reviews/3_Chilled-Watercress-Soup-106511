Tasted like grass soup... I am not an expert on watercress though, so perhaps I just really don't like this ingredient? Ended up throwing away the whole batch.

It's hard for me to review this, as I'm not a huge fan of chilled soups. I actually reheated it the second time I made it, and it was pretty good. I think it could use some kick - lemon, red pepper flakes, or something like that. I'll do that if I make it again. Also, immersion blenders are awesome! So much easier (and less messy) than a blender... and no need to wait 10 minutes for to cool. (I made this for a potluck and people seemed to enjoy it.)

Beautiful soup! Simple, delicious, refreshing. A favorite which we'l enjoy again and again. Caveat: requires at least six hours in frig, better overnight. I plan to try it with milk or condensed skim milk instead of whipping cream in an effort to reduce fat intake.
