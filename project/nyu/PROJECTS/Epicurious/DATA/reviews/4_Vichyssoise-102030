Used this recipe as a base to use up left over mashed potatoes from a dinner party. It turned out great! Used the Goat Cheese Mashed Potatoes on this site .. which are very good in their own right. Served it as an appetizer in fancy wine glasses.

Although listed as French cuisine, this cold soup is of well documented American origin. Even Julia Child recognized this.

Just finished making this. They say "add to taste" and mine was: 1 TBL Sour Cream and 2 TBLS Heavy Cream to 1 cup of the mixture. Nutmeg a must. So good just ate a cup full unchilled. Chilling now (me and it.) 1 Cup = another 30 minutes on my racquetball game, but worth it! Try it. Racquetball and this Vichyssoise! Very good recipe and the leeks in the stores are beautiful right now. - Carol Porter (I review cookbooks and write a recipe column for almost a living:) at http://www.macon.com/cookbookfarm/

My wife and I are following the South Beach diet and so I substituted cauliflower for potatoes. I also used fat-free half and half in place of heavy cream. All other ingredients were added as specified. It was an experiment, but to our delight, it was wonderful! Such a refreshing low-carb treat on a hot summer day!

This soup is exquisite! Whether cold as vichyssoise is served, or hot it's always great. I think though that the addition of sour or heavy cream is not at all needed.The soup is enough "heavy" with the rest of the ingredients, so why make it more fattening?

Very good soup but very thick, I had to add broth. It might be because I used the wihte and the green of the leeks. I wasn't mention in the recipe.

This soup is delicious. I always cook the potatoes in a separate pot as it keeps the soup from tasting starchy.

Excellent! I used all the ingredients but like others, did it in one pot. Sauteed leeks until tender, added potatoes, then added stock and simmered for 30 min. I then used hand blender to puree. Easy!

My mom used to make this in the summer for us, and I've always loved it. When she passed away, I searched endlessly to find the right recipe and was so pleased to discover this is the one! Velvety (if strained through cheesecloth),savory, beautiful- it is a lovely dish!

I pretty much stuck to the letter of this recipe, except I used fat free half and half instead of cream, and used a dollop of plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream when serving. I am not an experienced cook, though, so was not sure whether potatoes were to be peeled before they were cooked -- the answer is YES (had to look this up in other online recipes). Leeks were sold at the market in bunches of 5 (about 1" diameter), so I only used 5 and I used only the tender parts (no dark greens). The soup was delicious, not at all bland, and everyone at the Bastille Day dinner loved it -- all bowls were emptied. I would definitely make this again.

I wasnt sure how many leeks to use since there was a lot of size variation in the ones I had. I used one 1.5 inch diameter leek and 3 skinner (about 3/4 inch diameter) all together. I followed another reviewers suggestion to boil the potatoes in the broth to save a pot. The soup came out great, although I have only tasted it warm so far, not chilled. I ended up adding 1 T salt for seasoning and some white pepper. Delicious!

This was really good on its own, but for my bachelorette party, I added a large shallot, bay leaf, thyme, and marjoram and substituted white pepper for black. After chilling, I used fat-free half-and-half to thin the soup to the proper consistency and then garnished each serving with 1/2 a teaspoon of sour cream and minced chives. It looked and tasted beautiful!

I followed the recipe as stated, with the exception of the cream which I left out. It was still most successful, and very delicious.

I changed the order in which I cooked the ingredients so that I could make it all in one pot. I sauteed the leeks (I added a couple cloves of minced garlic also) in the soup pot. Then, I removed them from the pot and put them aside. I cooked the potatoes in the chicken stock until they were done, then added back all but 1/4 of the amount of the leeks. I blended everything together with a hand blender, and added the cream and seasonings. After returning the soup to a simmer, I added the remaining leeks and the chives as a garnish. I have also made this soup as a full meal. I sauteed some diced chicken breast in the pot and removed it before cooking the potatoes. Then after blending the soup, I added the chicken, the garnishes, and about a cup of frozen corn. The soup always turns out a pretty, light green color because I do use the lighter green, tender parts of the leeks.

My wife and I really enjoyed this. We only had 1 leek left and it still tasted pretty darn good. We've had this in restaurants and this is the first time we've tried making it ourselves. The taste is spot on!

A good, solid recipe. Easy and delicious, you can sub some milk, fat-free half and half, whatever - for some of the cream depending on how rich you want it. It's really good either way! The flavors in this soup need no tweaking, it was so tasty and well-balanced.

I've made this twice in the just the past week. The first time I made it according to directions except I used a combination of 1 cup of fat free half and half and 1/2 cup of sour cream. Husband loved it but said it was really rich. The next time I made it I only used 1 cup of the fat free half N half. A dollop of sour cream on top with a few snips of chives completed the picture perfect dish. It was simply divine!

Wow. This is the original. I've made about three Vichyssoise soups in the last few years and none of them tasted quite as good as a bowl of Vichyssoise that I had in New York City one summer. I finally found the taste!

Unfamiliar w/ cooking leeks, I put the whole leek in which turned the soup quite green, and tasted like "leek potato soup", not the creamy pale vichyssoise I was hoping for. Did use homemade broth, and added lots of pepper/salt. Just OK--would use different recipe (and research leeks) next time.

Decreased all dairy, save for the 2% milk mixed in at serving time. Increased broth too! Can't wait to make this again!

This is yummy and easy - to the cook who said to boil the potatoes with the leeks -- don't! This recipe is so much better than others because you don't get that starchy potato taste overpowering the leeks.

What a great recipe. First time I made vichyssoise, and it turned out great! I almost felt like it was complete even without the cream (if you wanted a lower-calorie version). Simple and easy and delicious!

I have made this on several occasions with the roast prime rib au poivre also on epicurious. Lots of subtle flavors in this dish, my whole family loves it!

I thought it was delicious though rich. The only problem was that it was a bit hard to reach the proper smooth consistency

This is a good recipe but may I help you adapt it? Use good quality or homemade chicken stock instead of bouillon. And add the potatoes to the leeks sauteing in the butter, and boil them WITH the stock!!! It really helps the potato absorb the leek flavoring, and the flavor is SO rich and delicious although you must be careful NOT to let the potato burn, it adds a deep nutty flavor not associated with vichyssoise. I also added one small sliced onion and it was great. After, blend it all together, let it cool til super cold, and stir in cream (NOT sour cream!), and vous avez une recette vraiment francaise. Bonne courage, you can do it!

It was good. Interesting combination of subtle flavors. However, I made it with the heavy cream and it's a bit too heavy for my taste. Next time I'd use sour cream instead or half and half.

I really didn't care for this, and that conclusion was unanimous in my household of five. Even my brother, who loves Vichyssoise, did't care for this version.

This was fantastic! Very authentic. Next time I'll modify with less butter and cream and just increase the broth. Essential to serve chilled with snipped chives..

This recipe is delicious and incredibly easy. If you want to cut the fat, I think you could leave out the sour/heavy cream. I used less leeks and more potato than it said--still terrific!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe! I love Vichyssoise and this compares to any good restaurant around yet it's easy and takes no time at all...

So simple and inexpensive... I made this with some potatoes I had sitting around and the remainder of a Chinese leek.... It cost me next to nothing and was an excellent dish. It didn't even take long to prepare.... By the way, the reduced fat sour cream is just fine in the recipe for other calorie conscious...

My family loves this - it is so good, especially now when it is so hot outside. I used to think our country club made the best vichyssoise around, but now I make it at home! I like the idea of using sour cream instead of just cream - I usually do it about 1/2 and 1/2. Also, you can substitute some milk for the cream if you want to make it a little bit lighter.

This very simple dish was a big hit. For those of you who are watching your weight, substitute the heavy cream with fat-free half and half. It is still delicious and very healthy!

Scrumptious flavor and very simple to prepare, a winner! I also added the shallot and it was very tasty. Tastes better a few days later too.

Add a thinly sliced large shallot with the leeks. It makes a subtle difference.

I prepared this recipe for our gourmet club and it was a terrific success, so muuch so that one of our guests asked for the recipe. I gave her the recipe plus an extra quart (left over). She called the next day and told me what a success it was. She said she HEATED it, added a couple of matzoh balls and served it to her husband. P.S. I never gave her another recipe.
