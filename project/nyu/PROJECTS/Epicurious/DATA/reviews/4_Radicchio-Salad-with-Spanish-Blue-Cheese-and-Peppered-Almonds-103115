Beautiful salad to kick off Osso Buco night! Loved the colors and the peppered almonds were great! I made the almonds on top of the stove, as another reviewer suggested...very easy. Our new go-to salad!

Excellent choice for a winter meal. Must use high quality blue cheese. Should be served as a course on its own with a good warm "just out of the oven" crusty bread and high grade european butter. I served it a number of times, always to rave reviews, and no leftover.

Fabulous salad...we can't get enough of this. Definitely use the best blue cheese you can get. I tried this with cheaper blue cheese once--never again! I also use a good Pinot Grigio wine vinegar which adds a lot to this. Don't forego the almonds...it's the combination of everything--salty/sweet/crunchy almonds, pungent blue cheese, bitter radicchio, and good quality oil & vinegar--that really makes this special. And, it's easy! Great for company.

Excellent! This has quickly become one of our favourite salads. I recommend reducing the amount of blue cheese if you want to soften the sharp taste. I have also perfected the peppered almonds after a couple of attempts: start by heating the oil and sugar gently in a pan on the stove top. When hot, add slivered almonds and mix well to coat. Half way through roasting the almonds, add the salt and pepper directly from shakers, mixing all the time to coat the almonds uniformly, and to avoid the formation of clusters. Watch temperature and time carefully, and remove almonds from pan immediately when they reach the proper roasting point.

Salad is very good - although the peppered almonds did not come out well so I just served it without them and it was fine.

Every time I make this salad I never get a chance to try it!!! Gone in a flash. This is counting Spaniards who are great aficionados of FOOD.

I used a spring mix as a shortcut, but the recipe was terrific anyway. Very good mix of flavors for a fairly simple salad. The peppered almonds were a unique twist and a great addition. I ended up baking the almonds at 350 for 12 minutes and saw no sign of burning.

Great recipe! The peppered almonds are fabulous. I didn't find Spanish blue cheese? I served this to 7 and there was some leftover. Good company presentation.

A wonderful myriad of flavours and textures! Not for the bland of heart.

This is an excellent salad. It is so good with the blue cheese and the almonds added a nice crunch. It's unusual, yet delicious.

We made this salad for a party and everyone loved it. I would make this again it was easy and so good.... The almonds really gave it something extra.
