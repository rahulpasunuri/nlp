I have not tried this recipe as of yet but I have the original copy of the magazine and that recipe only calls for 1/3 cup of mayo along with the same quantity of other ingredients. This may make the difference in the negative reviews.

I would just like to say to Kenton, the "finish with angel food cake ... " means - finish the meal as in dessert !!!

One assumes that the topping of angel food cake and caramel sauce on the fried oysters is a typo?

I really love fried oysters, so this wasn't a complete loss, but the "holiday tartar sauce" really didn't do much for us. I ended up just using my old favorite, lemon juice.
