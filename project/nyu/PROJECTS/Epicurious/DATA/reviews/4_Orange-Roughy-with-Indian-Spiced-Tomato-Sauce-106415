What a delicious, quick weeknight meal. Put the rice cooker on earlier, and then it's less than 10 minutes to table. I realized I didn't have garam masala so made a mixture of two parts curry powder to one part cayenne, and it was perfect. I served it with wilted spinach on the side.

Great recipe! Used my own tomatoes and added red onions, fresh garlic & jalapenos. Then made as recipe. Made my own Garam Masala from "Barbeque Bible"

I would have given this three forks just on taste; it gets the extra one because of how unbelievably easy it is. Fantastic. I made it with shrimp and think it would work well with any fish, chicken or tofu. Next time I think I'll try it with coconut milk instead of yogurt. Try it you won't be sorry.

This was very easy to make and satisfies our once in a while Indian food craving. I used curry masala and it was a tad spicy so I ended up adding more diced tomatoes to even it out. I broiled the fish also and I would say that you can use almost any fish for this dish and it would work.

This dish was amazing! I also made raita and white jasmine rice on the side. And of course served with na'an.

This recipe turned out amazing! I even forgot the yogurt at the end and we still loved it! It's going to be a regular on our menu for sure!

The orange roughy stands up to the spicy Rotel tomato sauce. I did not use the mild version. The quickness and simplicity plus bold taste make this a winner. I stirred the yoghurt into the sauce and used twice as much cilantro as suggested. Excellent!

So easy and delicious! Followed the recipe as written, and I made raita to serve alongside the curry. Also served with basmati rice and Indian-spiced broccoli and potatoes. Oh, if we only had bottomless stomachs!

Amazing... I made my own garam masala after realizing i didn't have any in the house (cumin, corriander, cayane, hot curry).

We love this recipe and make it often. I've made it with olive oil instead of butter and it is still good, although not quite as rich.

big hit, will make it again. Dressed the cukes with yogurt mixed with lime zest and cilantro--delish

Yum. This was simple to make and delicious. For the folks who thought it was too spicy, Penzey's Spices Graam Masala is very mild.

I followed the recipe exactly, and we were not bowled over by it. It all got eaten, but the most common comment was "Hmmmm! This is certainly different". I doubt that I'd cook it again.

This dish was absolutely delicious. Would be great to serve at a dinner party accompanied with brown rice steamed broccoli or sautéed spinach with garlic. I also added curry powder to my fish before frying and to the sauce as well as a half of julienne orange or yellow pepper to the tomato sauce.

Wonderful recipe. Make it almost fat free by using fat free yogurt and just "painting" a non-stick pan with a bit of oil or butter....no sacrifice to taste. Next time I will add the dollop of yogurt on top as the recipe said (instead of mixing into tomato mixture as some reviewers said they did) Doing it their way was not visually appealing. Served with plain old basmati rice and steamed broccoli....this dish doesn't need anything else competing with its flavors! Side note.....I used a can of tomato with green chili from the Mexican section (rather than one of the two standard American brands that make it) and could swear it has lots more chili heat than the "other" brands.

Simple and full of flavor. Doesn't need to be changed at all. We're making it again tonight!

I am in the middle of remodeling my home and wanted something I could cook in an electric skillet that would be tasty and allow me to stay on my low-carb diet. I used a bag of Trader Joes flash frozen orange roughy and sauteed the filets as directed. I made the sauce and added the yoghurt to the sauce to make it creamy. Then I slipped the filets back into the sauce and turned the electric skillet to low for a few minutes. It was served with the salad but without the rice for the low-carb benefits. Delicious! Definately a keeper just for the ease of making and the deep flavor punch. Recommended!

So easy. No modifications needed. Absolutely delicious! I served with coriander carrots (carrots, coriander, raisins - recipe from Sass's vegetarian pressure cooking book). The two went perfectly together.

This truly is a "dish beyond compare". Restaurant quality and takes less than 10 min from start to finish. I am blown over by the complexity and simplicity of this dish.

Hmmmm... I guess orange roughy is like a fine wine... aged to perfection. I really enjoyed this recipe.

This recipe was great...I was in a bit of a rush and threw everything on top of the fish and baked it. I also used tilapia. I made gram marsala and omited the cloves, which makes it a bit milder. Served with rice and Indian Pea and Cauifower recipe. It was truely a hit!!

This was a very easy and delicious recipe - it exceeded my expectations! I didn't have canned tomatoes with chilis so I used a 15 oz can of chopped tomatoes and about 1/2 a can of chopped green chilis. I also mixed about 1/2 of the yogurt in with the sauce and used the rest for garnish.

A very very easy recipe, and it was a surprise hit with the boyfriend. But I can't say I found it all that fabulous. I think maybe its just a matter of whether you like garam masala or not, and maybe if I just used curry and cumin and cayenne I would have loved it. Also found that the fish (I ended up with red snapper - all they had at the store) was a bit of a problem to cook. I think if you like the spicing you could easily do this with boneless chicken breasts instead.

I used tilapia in lieu of specified ingredients. Snapper would have been great! The fresh cilantro was intense. However, the garam masala was a little too hot for my wife's taste, but just right for mine. Garam masala is a wonderfully fragrant mixture, temper it with more yogurt if you don't like heat!
