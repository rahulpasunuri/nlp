Made this to go with sticky toffee pudding. It was delicious but not out of this world. It was good with the puddings. And it was quick and easy.

Quite delicious with a bit of sea salt added. Yummy sauce to dip pretzels in.

I also used a bit less cream. I also used salted butter to get the salt in the recipe. It was perfect!

I did the same thing as an earlier reviewer--I used a little less cream. This helped keep it a bit thicker. I added a dash of salt, too. I topped brownies with the caramel sauce, then sprinkled a little fleur de sel over the top. Great.

Very easy and delicious! Thin when first finished but thickens nicely (espcially on ice cream!)

I made this as written first. It was mild in caramel flavor and thin as others mentioned, but I refrigerated overnight and it became the consistency of condensed milk. The flavor improved too. Second time I wanted deeper caramel flavor, so I used 1.5 cups cream instead of 2, which made it darker, buttery, and thick. It only needed 10 minutes to boil with less cream. I prefer a dash of salt in caramel so I used salted butter. This is TO DIE FOR and much easier than dealing with the hardening sugar and bubbling cream of the traditional way.

This was a great caramel sauce recipe. I agree that it wasn't too thick, however I wanted it to be slightly thin. I made this to go over a flourless chocolate cake with homemade white-chocolate gelato and it was a hit at my easter dinner!

I served this with ice cream and a different caramel sauce, and it was very good. Next time I will try regular flour as has been suggested, because this was a "cake" and not at all pudding-like. I will also try it with Cardamom Praline Sauce from this site, which is my all-time favorite sauce. Very moist and had people guessing what was in it. Not the best dessert I've ever had, but one you can't go wrong with.

I used this as a brownie topping- perfect, not too sweet and not to thick.

This makes a fairly thin, pourable caramel sauce that is very creamy but really lacks the depth of caramel flavor that I was looking for. I suppose I should have expected that, since the sugar doesn't get caramelized separately from the liquid. In any case, this requires a bit of doctoring (I added triple sec and vanilla) to give it a flavor beyond sweet/creamy, but it does make a decent ice cream topping. I wouldn't bother again, though - there are MUCH better caramel sauce recipes on this site.

Although I'll admit I don't know much about caramel, I can honestly say that I found this sauce to be delicious--and every one of my guests agreed. It took a bit longer to reduce than the recipe specified, but once it did, the flavor was full and rich, with a velvety texture. I served it with a simple vanilla cheesecake. Perfection!

Made just a third of this recipe for just the two of us. It was plenty over some good vanilla ice cream. Will do that again.

Compared to the other carmel sauce that I made this was sickly sweet and far to creamy!

I made this sauce to go along with bread pudding. It was delicious!!!! I didn't want to make a lot so I halved the recipe and it turned out great. I'll be using this recipe again in the future.

Sauce is truly excellant. I usually make a bit more then eat the leftovers Not very adultish I know but this sauce takes me back to christmas at my english grandmother who always had some type of steamed pudding with the most amazing caramel sauce

The sauce was great, nice balance and not too sweet. To the reviewer that the caramel sauce separated. Too things could have been the problem. The butter was added when the caramel was to hot or butter was too warm. I was a pastry chef and we always allowed the caramel to cool about a half hour before adding the butter and stired it as it cooled to keep everything in suspended. Also if you overheat the caramelwhen rewarming it will separate

Not sure what happened here. The sauce tasted great, but it took an hour to reduce to 1 3/4 cups, not the 15 minutes. It ended up being too dark and, although not burnt-tasting, was too carmelized. Then, the sauce separated and oil rose to the top. It also wasn't smooth and shiny. I want to try it again and think it has potential.
