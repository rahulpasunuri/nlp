I thought the pesto for this dish was a bit salty. What I liked about it was the combination of the sweet, crunchy sugar snap peas with the peppery arugula. Delicious! So, maybe I'll cut the salt in half next time and double the sugar snap peas.

Overrated.

I added white beans and chicken marinated in lemon, garlic, and mixed herbs. Nice alternative to basic basil pesto if you like arugula. Would be nice topped with fresh chopped tomoatoes.

Yummy, but so green! Next time, I'd add tomatoes or yellow bell peppers.

This is a fabulous recipe. Perfect use for farm fresh snap peas!
