I made these stuffed with mozzarella and anchovies for a dinner party and they were amazing! The batter was so easy and really crunchy. Everyone loved them and I'll definitely make them again.

I did not like this recipe at all. They look great but I think the batter (I included the egg white) is much too heavy and soaks up a great deal of oil. The batter winds up tasting just like onion ring batter and it's so thick that you can barely discern what's inside. I used gorgeous large organic, super fresh zucchini flowers from the greenmarket, but I could only eat one and immediately felt kind of ill, as though my insides were coated with oil. My husband just managed to eat 2. We have enjoyed this delicacy in Rome, where we found it to be much lighter and less leaden. I'd recommend using a different recipe when trying to turn these out at home!!

Bought 9 Zucchini blossoms at the Union Square Market today for $3. Made a filling of goat ricotta cheese mixed with chopped fresh mint,salt,pepper, and a little fresh grated Parmesan cheese. Added the egg whites to the batter and used Anchor Steam pale ale with the flour. Divine!

I made these, stuffed with a mixture of fresh ricotta, minced shallots and fresh herbs - basil, parsely, thyme and then sauteed them in canola oil. A big hit, but labor intensive, not to mention, if you don't grow them in your own garden, an expensive treat at $3.00 per bag of 2 blossoms!

Made this recipe using Coors light of all things, and it came out wondrously. Big props to Miciolla below for recommending a filling of mozzarella and anchovy. I used a small piece of fresh mozzarella, a tiny smear of anchovy paste and a small basil leaf in each one, dredged in the bubbly batter, and it was the best thing on the planet. I don't even love anchovy.

I'm looking forward to trying this recipe, though I have same recipe as skinnyboy's from Italian grandmother as THE traditional recipe. With an over-abundance of zucchini in the garden, we sometimes use this batter for sauteing zucchini, sliced very thin lengthwise (or stuffed, but that's another story...).

I was delighted to see a recipe WITHOUT filling! This is the way I grew up enjoying them. Our batter was the simplest, peasant way: flour, baking powder, an egg, and enough water to make a thin batter. You do NOT have to remove the stamen. But be sure to pick the flowers in the morning when they are open (not to trap any bees). The male flowers are the ones with the skinny stems. The female have the fruit behind the blossom. Delicious!

My Italian grandmother used to say that the stamen contains toxins, so we remove them. We also make the batter with an egg, yolk straight in, white whipped up to soft peaks, and we season it with plenty of black pepper before resting it in the fridge. Rather than beer, a little dry white wine, or vinegar is often used. They are divine plain, but I can also highly recommend stuffing with a little seasoned and herbed ricotta.

Hello everybody! Congratulations on this receipt that is exactly how we make "fiori di zucca fritti" here in Italy! May I suggest to all of you the best filling ever? The most famous in Southern Italy! Please just fill each blossom with one chop of mozzarella and 1 anchovy. Please taste and let me know... big hug from Rome!

These were delicious! The batter is a bit heavy, but this is by far the best way to eat squash blossoms. I've tried them stuffed with ricotta, mushrooms and sauteed and this is really the best cooking method. I used the blossoms that still had the zucchini ends attached (not sure if those are the males or females) and it gave them a little something extra. I definitely recommend using these as opposed to the blossoms that just have the stem. There is a lot more flavor in that little extra bit of zucchini.

I've found a farmer here in Central PA who will supply me with blossoms throughout the summer. I've made these variations twice to rave reviews from very discerning eaters. My one question is, why is clipping the stamen before stuffing and frying a requirement?

I made the master recipe exactly as written. The coating was absolutely perfect--light and crispy. These were fabulous and my guests raved about them.
