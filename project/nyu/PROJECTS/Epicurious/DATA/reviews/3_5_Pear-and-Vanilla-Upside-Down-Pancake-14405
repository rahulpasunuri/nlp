This recipe was a bit more work than the usual pancake recipe, but worth it. Most Dutch pancake recipes have more dense and sometimes gummy pancakes. This one is light and fluffy. What a pretty pancake, and likely more of an "upside-down cake" than a pancake. I'll definitely make this again. I did substitute vanilla extract for the vanilla sugar which seemed to work out fine. Also, per other reviewers, the cooking time is about half what the recipe states. So cook for 7 mins at 400 degrees then drop to 350 for 7 - 8 more minutes. And I think this would make a lovely dessert as well. MIght work well with apricots or peaches, too.

I love recipes like this that teach me a new technique-- in this case the upside down pancake. I've adapted it many ways, but this is my favorite: http://collectedquotidian.com/2011/10/12/pear-and-rosemary-upside-down-pancake-soaked/

I was disappointed by this recipe (my husband really liked it, though). I thought the pancake came out tough and thin. The cooking time was significantly less than the recipe called for. I won't make again.

I have made this dish countless times and it's always a hit! I also use good vanilla extract (and plenty of it). I also tend to use more than the recommended amount of pears...call me crazy. I find that it serves way more than two people though. More like 4 to 6 if it's served with other things.

I have made this recipe yearly since it came out and I had just gotten some Harry&David pears as a gift. everyone loves it. I use a commercial vanilla sugar to save that step, but you could certainly do it ahead. Have successfully doubled recipe also.

This looks and tastes fantastic! We were a bit short on pears but it worked out fine just the same. I used powered buttermilk which was as good as fresh. The vanilla bean seeds make it very elegant and we will definitely make it again soon!

I thought the recipe was fairly simple and looked beautiful. Truth be told, I think the whole thing with the vanilla bean is a little gimmicky and a little vanilla extract would produce the same effect quicker, cheaper and more easily. The flavor was good and we didn't think it needed maple syrup.

Although this pancake smelled delicious, it was a lot of work for only so-so results.

This is a wonderful recipe. It looks so beautiful on the table, and tastes just as good as it looks! Remember though to cut down on the baking time, we found it needed just half the time the recipe mentioned.

Very time-consuming, but well worth the effort. The whole family raves ... over and over!!!!
