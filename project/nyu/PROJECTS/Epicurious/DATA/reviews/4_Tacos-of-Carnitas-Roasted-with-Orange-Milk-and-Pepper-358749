So.... I consider myself a pretty good cook, I have re-read this recipe to make sure that I did not forget anything. This recipe was just BLAH! It had no flavor whatsoever! I also did a rub on the pork as other reviewers suggested and it did not help! I always get compliments on what I make... Not this time!!, Look for another recipe!

I thought this was amazing! I couldn't keep my husband and youngest son out of Le Crueset!! I used bone-in country ribs and I'm so glad I did. I think the extra fat made a huge difference. I used rendered chicken fat instead of lard, sprinkled each rib with cumin, fresh ground pepper, kosher salt and garlic powder, and the flavoring was just right. Since my roaster fit all of the ribs in a single layer, I didn't need to use the whole 2 cups of water to cover them, hence when browning, they did only require the 20 minutes as directed. These came out wonderfully moist albeit not low cal (but you can't expect to cook country ribs and have them be low cal!). We cook for large groups at our lake house and this will certainly be on the menu this summer!

I wasn't quite as effusive as others. I think it needs garlic as a starter, lots of salt, and defiantly add the cumin as others have suggested. It wasn't as succulent as I would have wanted, it seemed somewhat dry. I tried to separate out as much of the grease from the liquids and tried to not add grease back in with the meat. Perhaps that was the problem, but I couldn't stand putting so much avoidable grease into the dish. Now that it is the next day and I am warming up the leftovers, there seems to be PLENTY of grease in the meat. I had never made carnitas before, and probably will try a different recipe the next time.

Excellent!!!!! I used pork from our local farm and I am a firm believer that happy, healthy pigs taste waaaay better. I did a little mexican dry rub-bish sorta thing (garlic, cumin, oregano and cayenne) on the pieces and let them sit for about 4 hours before I cooked them. I also subbed olive oil for the lard but followed the rest of the directions in the recipe. Roasting to reduce liquid took about 45 minutes. Served with homemade tomato corn salsa, a mexican slaw and yogurt lime sauce I made on the fly and corn tortillas. My husband said this was my best dinner ever.

The best carnitas I've ever had. And so incredibly easy to make. I am blown away by how this combination of few and simple ingredients produced such amazing flavor. I didn't have lard, so I rendered some fat off the roast along with a couple slices of bacon and added butter for good measure. I browned the pork in two batches in my 7-quart Dutch oven (so important not to overcrowd the pot). Make sure to get a good sear on the meat, as doing so produces a ton of flavor. The only changes I made were seasoning the pork with more salt and pepper, then adding a generous sprinkling of cumin on the meat after roasting it for the initial two hours. I agree with other reviewers that it takes a good 45 minutes for most of the liquid to evaporate while roasting the meat uncovered. Don't worry, the pork will still be unbelievably tender when all is said and done. I served it with organic chile corn tortillas, crema that I made with low-fat sour cream and lime juice, feta cheese (because I couldn't find cotija), shredded green cabbage, Mrs. Renfro's hot jalapeno green salsa, caramelized red and sweet yellow onions, and the corn and avocado salsa that also appears on this site. What an exceptionally authentic-tasting meal! I will only use this carnitas recipe, and I can easily imagine making it at least once a month. Pork butt is affordable (a 3.5-lb roast only costs $10 on AmazonFresh), and I would love to explore other uses for this meat.

Outstanding and so easy to make! The flavor was just incredible. Made the tomatillo salsa as well. The only thing I did differently was use olive oil to brown the meat instead of lard.

Awesome recipe. You can use some vegetable oil instead of the lard. I also like to bring some cumin and mexican oregano to the party. I've also tossed in a seeded dry arbol chile in the pot if I want to kick it up. Or a half of one if you are cautious. Though, hitting it with a nice salsa at the table works fine, too. Remember to keep an eye on it towards the end so you don't burn it! The sugars can go from caramel to carbon quickly.

Just...wow. This was amazing. My first time making carnitas, but oh my this recipe is delicious. After grocery shopping I realized I didn't have lard, but I did have duck fat, so I used that instead. Surely that inauthenticizes the dish somewhat, but that was fine with me. Otherwise followed the recipe, but giving the liquid more like 45-60 minutes to reduce. The tomatillo salsa was good, like other salsa verdes. As much as I'd like to try other versions of carnitas, I'm afraid this is it for me. I will make this recipe over and over again.

I really enjoyed this. I used butter instead of lard because I couldn't find a small amount. The meat comes out exceptionally tender and moist. It took a bit longer than 20 minutes to reduce the liquid after I put the broiler on. I also couldn't find fresh chicharrones. The salsa was just ok.

This turned out beautifully; so easy to make and super affordable. Next time, I will mash some garlic in a mortar and pestle with the salt & some Mexican oregano to give it just a bit more flavor. My husband, who thinks he does not like Mexican food, LOVED THIS! Delicious. I served it with the Raw Tomatillo Salsa too!

leftover report...omg. made a batch of crispy corn tort shells for tacos, loaded them with the rewarmed pork carnitas and leftover tomatillo salsa, chopped fresh cilantro, tomatoes and avocado and a sprinkle of shredded cheese (cheddar in this instance) - UNREAL! We actually have leftovers of the leftovers and will have them tomorrow morning :) SO GOOD!

Muy delicioso! Make everything, the pork, the tomatillo salsa, chopped onion, cilantro and avocado on the side. Warm your torts. This is amazingly delicious. Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow.

This is one of the easiest carnitas recipes I've found. Great flavor but I thought a little bland. Next time I'll play around with adding jalapenos or something else to bump up the spice.

I have tried many ways to make carnitas but this is the best so far. Do not alter it at all.

Great recipe. If your new to Carnitas try this one. The flavors are a surprise. I squeezed in the orange juice but only used the peel instead of the whole rind. All things normalized, this is the best Carnitas recipe I have found.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! Instead of doing it in the over, though, I rub the outside of the shoulder with salt, pepper and cumin, sear it off in the lard (yes, it does make it 10x yummier!), and then plop it in the crock pot for 10 hours with milk, orange and garlic. Easy and amazing!!!

I have made this several times and always delicious. Better to go with a little fattier cut of meat and pick out the fat before serving than selecting a leaner cut. The cilantro and lime juice bring a lovely freshness to it.

i added garlic, chilies and cumin to this recipe to spice it up, then cooked the pork in a slow cooker (adding water and milk), reduced the sauce in a pan, coated the pork with it and then broiled; lots of additional work but adds flavor and crispy texture!

This gringa doesn't usually cook Mexican at home, but I found myself with a pork roast and a hunger for carnitas. It was absolutely delicious. DON'T SKIP THE LARD. No need to be embarrassed for your skinny friends to discover you use it: buy the butter-sized package, stash it in the back of the fridge and use the rest for pie crust. I used perhaps a little more salt than I should have, but the meat turned out juicy and scrumptious, and is well worth waiting 1 1/2 hours for.

Excellent carnitas. So easy to make - I didn't alter the recipe at all. The pork was so tender and flavorful!

The whole family loved this dish. I wasn't sure it would be flavorful enough, but was surprised. So yummy. I cut up a pork roast because I couldn't find shoulder. The liquid did not cook off in the last 20 min. so I dipped it out and saved it for keeping leftovers moist in the fridge. We had them with handmade corn tortillas, white onion and cilantro. Might try lime next time. Allergies to avacado.
