these are tasty, but a little fussy (especially the cutting into triangles through the parchment). but they taste wonderful! i had to bake in 2 batches and ended up baking only 10 minutes for the second batch becaues the 1st one browned too much. just be careful to watch them!

These are delicious! As recommended in a previous review, I topped them with arugula and blue cheese then drizzled them with a balsamic vinegar reduction. Brought them to several parties and everyone loved them.

I made an appetizer with these by topping them with arugula, braised pears, blue cheese, and drizzling a balsamic reduction over the whole thing. Absolutely spectacular both in presentation and in taste. Had bunches of leftover crisps which were great just on their own.

These crips are easy to make and absolutely delicious! I did not care for them with the mocha mousse as in this recipe. Next time I will make them to go with a different mousse or just a good dish of ice cream. The taste is somewhat like a praline.
