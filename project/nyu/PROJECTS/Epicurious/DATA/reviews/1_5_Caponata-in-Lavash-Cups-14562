This was tasty after I doctored it up a bit. The water did not yield enough flavor so I drained the water about halfway through cooking and continued the rest of the sauteing with about one tablespoon of oil. Also I pureed about 1/3 cup and added it back to help bind the dish and make it look better. You really need to stick to the 1/4" dice and doing that took a lot of prep time. (I did not make the lavash cups but served it along toasted Italian bread).
