I made this with framboise and I found that it was a bit bland. I would recommend using cassis and playing around with the recipe. Next time (if I make it again, not sure I will) I'd try adding diced plum pieces in the mix and experimenting with spices.

The cassis is the key to this recipe. I used small, purple, greengage-type plums, and since it's a nuisance to pit them I cooked them gently until they just started to soften, then pureed them through a nylon sieve. I didn't quite use all the sugar syrup - about 5/6 of it, adding it a bit at a time until I was happy with the flavour. I've done this with framboise as well, but the cassis is the best.

Really fantastic dessert -- cool and elegant. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

When I saw this recipe I thought it would be a fabulous way to use up some of our delicious home grown plums. My guests loved it and so did I...but beware of the after effect. I wish I had considered this before serving my neighbors. I'll probably never live down serving a laxative dessert to friends. If only they knew I used 24 plums.

fantastic, though very intense. We used only 1/2 the simple syrup, as the plums were ripe. and we made it with liquid nitrogen.
