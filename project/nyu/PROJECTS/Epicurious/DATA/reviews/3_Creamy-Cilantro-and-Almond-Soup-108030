Very good! Tasty but not overpowering with cilantro. Liked the crunchiness of the almonds. A little thin.

I ended up throwing this pot of soup out. I started with perfect, beautiful cilantro and parsley, followed the instructions and came out with a tasteless, unsaveable watery soup. I have no idea why any of the other reviewers liked this soup.

I made this as a surprise for my hubby (from Mexico City) and he hasn't stopped raving. It's a wonderful light soup.

I'm always looking for less-common Mexican recipes. This was a real find--much better than I expected! I'll note that I used homemade chicken stock, which can never hurt. Next time I make it, however, I'll probably put it through a food mill instead of using the blender, to improve texture. A great recipe for summer!

Delicious and unusual recipe. I used 8 oz of cream cheese and about 3/4 cup tosted almonds to make the soup thicker. It was perfect. This could also work as a tasty sauce over chicken.

This is a fantastic tasting recipe! The only thing I would like to change at all about this recipe is that it is too thin but the taste makes it worth doing again and again.
