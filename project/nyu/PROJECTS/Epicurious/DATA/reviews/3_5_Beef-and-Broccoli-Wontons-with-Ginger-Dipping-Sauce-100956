Oh my goodness, these were a huge hit with my family and guests. I followed the recipe for the dumplings to the letter. They were so easy to make! They tasted great hot, reheated easily, and were yummy when eaten cold the next day. I served these with a store bought dipping sauce. Very happy with the results. Doesn't need any adapting at all, but I might add other veggies next time.

I made these for a Thanksgiving appetizer. They were absolutely delicious and a huge hit. I pretty much stuck to the recipe, except that I precooked the ground beef. I plan to make these again, but I might just add a splash of soy sauce to the beef mixture. I found that it worked well to pan fry the wontons with the skillet cover on.

still REELING from the incredible flavour of these little morsels. They certainly pack a punch when accompanied by the dipping sauce..BUT alas I had to compromise...I could not get wonton wrappers (live in the boons) so was forced into the egg roll realm. I followed everything to the letter other than the wrappers...I did cut these on the diagonal in order to get the size proportional. My boys are young but basically will try anything and everything and these went over without comment...so not really kid friendly as the dipping sauce is really a decadent grown-up taste...maybe "too stingy" for little ones? I had left over meat mixture cause I was getting fed up with the procedure so I added another egg, fried it up and mixed in some rice...this ended up in a "slat-sling" as we call it in Nova Scotia...slat in that and sling in this and eat. Lovely.

My sister has been making these for years. Fantastic evertime. I'm about to have my first go at them this weekend. Can someone pls tell me if you can make them ahead of time, freeze, then fry from frozen?

Suzie in Sequim & anyone else interested - the recipe is: Crab Pot Stickers with Sesame-Ginger Dipping Sauce

On my review down the list I gave this 4 forks. I have found it makes a big difference which wonton wrappers I use. If you are going to the trouble of making this recipe, find the thin, white wonton wrappers at an Asian market. When I made this with the thick, ivory colored wontons from the supermarket the results were extremely disappointing.

Made these for a cocktail party last night, and they were a huge hit! Definitely a keeper.

Easy recipe, once you get the hang of filling, folding and sealing the wonton wrappers. I often double the recipe (since I generally start with a one pound package of ground beef) and freeze the extras for later. Our three year old daughter loves these, too.

This got raves from the whole family...even the kids who discovered the broccoli. My 10 year old did the assembly and some of the cooking (supervised of course). He was quite proud. We will make this again soon.

I thought this recipe was delicious! I made no changes to the original and I was very hapy with the result. I definitely do agree that the wontons are in need of the sauce. I made both the Ginger Dipping sauce from this recipe as well as the Sesame Ginger Dipping sauce used w/ the Crab Potstickers (also found on this site). Thought I have not made the potstickers yet, I found the Sesame Ginger Dipping sauce more to my liking than the Ginger sauce that accompanies the wonton recipe. My family also seemed to like it better. P.S. We have a deep fryer and I found that to be much easier than frying them on the stove!

For my veggie daughter, I substituted wild rice and dried mushrooms for the ground beef. The result is that the texture is meaty and carnivores are even fooled by the flavor. I also substituted the onion with green onions. Even my onion-hating mom loved these. I am making these for my daughter's birthday this year, which happens to fall on Thanksgiving. I suspect I'll have to make enough for everyone!

These are excellent. They aren't what I expected at all - usually I make pan fried/steamed pot stickers - but my oh my were they tasty. The sauce is necessary. The wontons themselves are very delicately flavored and do need more of a kick - which they get from the soy sauce/rice vinegar/ginger/honey sauce. mmmmm. Throw in a spoonful of garlic chili sauce and it'd be even better. Great way to get kids to eat broccoli!

I made this EXACTLY according to the recipe and it was absolutely delicious. The garlic, the fresh ginger, the sesame oil play off beautifully against the strong flavors of the beef and the broccoli. (I was thinking this is the only way I'll ever eat ground beef again, it is that good.) Worth the effort.

While I enjoy the idea of wontons - they look so nice - and I like the idea of adding different recipes to my collection, this recipe was not a wower. The flavors were mild; for the amount of work, I would have preferred to make meatballs. Asian food is great when their unique spices are brought out. Even though I used ground pork and water chestnuts and added some red pepper flakes, this recipe was rather homey tasting. I am looking for a meat wonton recipe that wows everyone. Perhaps the impression is all in the moment, because I was incredibly hungry when I ate them and, don't get me wrong, I did enjoy them hot. I was impressed with how tender the meat was without cooking it before I fried them, and the chopped texture was better than others that are pureed.

Delicious! Don't skip the sauce, the combination of flavors is what makes it so good. I pan fried most and also baked a few. I would not recommend baking them, the texture isn't great. Next time I will pan fry them but use less oil, maybe only 1/2 - 1 tsp, as they were a little too greasy.

Yummy! Will make again - especially for parties.

I have made these wontons countless times, both steamed and pan-fried. They are declicious each and every time I make them. However, I use a different sauce for it - a spicy sesame dipping sauce that works really well.

I only made the sauce (to dip stir fried ahi in) and it was great! I had a couple of other recipes (including the one from Benihana and the one with Dijon for the crab potstickers from this site) and this sauce was hands down the best. I used low sodium Tamari instead of soy and added a dash of dark sesame oil.

Love these! I don't measure the ingredients well, so I often feel like I end up with too many, but they taste so good. I added a little chopped asparagus, too, which I liked a lot. They are also good the next day.

I have made the wontons many times for parties and have gotten excellent reviews. They are always gone quickly. People have even asked me to make them again! The fresh ginger and garlic are key. I can't understand how other reviewers found these "tasteless" with those ingredients?! They are one of our favorite appetizers!

I made this dish for a cocktail party and got rave reviews. I made the filling in advance and then assembled them the next day with a friend's help. Not only were they amazing, but fun to make as well!

The sauce was great. I am using it with a lot of different asian foods. The wontons were OK, but we like the crab potstickers on this site better.

I now know that I do not have to order asian foods out anymore! I am not one to follow recipes exactly to the T - I enjoy adding my own spin to things. I doubled the measuments, and added a bit of ginger to the filling. It was wonderful!! Brought some into work and EVERYONE loved them! Not sure what the cooks from CA and Boston/NYC/LA did wrong...but it certainly was something....

This recipe didn't say to cook the meat first, but I did anyway because it didn't sound like it would get done when you fried the wontons. I also used pork because it sounds more Oriental than ground beef. My 12 year old daughter helped me wrap the filing into the wonton wrappers. Having never cooked with them before, we destroyed the first four! This recipe is not hard, and very tasty.....and we will make them again!

I thought this recipe was very good. I forgot to buy broccoli so I used water chestnuts and bamboo which I minced. The flavor was good and the wontons were surprisingly not greasy, although some were a bit crisp. I will definately try to bake some of the wontons. Next time I am going to try with ground chicken and broccoli.

I don't understand why others rated this dish a 3 or 4. The wontons are tasteless and so is the dipping sauce. Didn't want them to go to waste so I used soy sauce for dipping instead which gave it a little flavor.

Hideous. Tasteless and pasty inside, even after I added more soy sauce and sesame oil and garlic to the filling. Yuck.

I made these and decided to try steaming 1/2 of them and baking the other half on parchment with a quick spritz of oil. The ones that were baked (about 10 mins at 400 degrees) where by far much better than the ones that were steamed. If you are trying to cut down the calories and make something that doesn't have to be babysat too much, I would definitely bake them again.

I made these wontons over a year ago and we loved them. When I couldn't find the recipe I went crazy, I feel so lucky to have finally found it here on this web site. It's a definite keeper.

I made these for a small cocktail party, and everyone loved them. The accompanying sauce adds a great flavor to the wonton. I made them several hours in advance and then fried them right before serving.

This recipe was great. We steamed ours for 15 minutes instead of frying (to cut down on the fat content) and were very impressed with the flavors!

These tasted fantastic and were pretty easy to make. I substituted pork for the beef, mixed everything in my food processor, and steamed them first for about 15 minutes. Then I lightly fried them making the best pot stickers I've ever had. Even though I made a mistake and put in twice the amount of honey I would do it again--still not sweet and took care of some of the saltiness. Everyone gave them rave reviews.

I made these last night and was surprised at how easy they were to make. I didn't have broccoli so I used extra onion and they turned out great. I took a previous reviewer's advice and chopped everything up very finely which gave them a nice consistency.

I have made this recipe for 3 different parties and they have been gone almost before I can get them on the table!!! I added a very small splash of sesame oil to the filling and then fry them in canola oil rather than the sesame oil. Great recipe!!!

Love these yummy wontons! They may be a tiny bit on the salty side, though. It's really easy to lighten them up by just using cooking spray when you fry them. They still taste great the next day, although they won't be crunchy at all.

Rating: 2
I found the wontons to be on the salty side and because you fry them in oil...kind of heavy. If I were to make this dish again, I would steam the wontons and then lightly pan fry to give the wontons a more "authentic" taste. I would also recommend finely mixing all the ingredients in a food processor to give the wontons a more "chewy" consistency as found in most Asian wontons.

Excellent, even as a main dish accompanied by plain white rice. We have tried a variation on this recipe, substituting ground turkey and chopped spinach for the beef and broccoli. It proved to be equally good.

This was a surprising very easy appetizer to make with rave reviews..even by someone who didn't like broccoli. I added a bit of soya sauce to the filling to enhance the flavour. The only thing that is a bit fussy at first is working with the wontons, but you get the hang of it pretty quickly..
