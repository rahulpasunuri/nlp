Nice recipe. I used the slicing blade attachment on my food processor to get uniform size slices. I tossed all the potatoes into a gallon size ziplock bag, poured the oil, salt and pepper over them and shook the bag for complete coverage. They took longer to crisp than what the recipe said. I put them onto a raised grate so I didn't have to turn them.

These slices are extremely delicious. A great way to incorporate a mouth watering healthy vegetable dish into your dinner meal! My picky boyfriend, who does not like veggies, even thought these were great. The only problem I had, was that mine got a little dark to quickly. I would recommend lowering the oven temp a little or reducing the cook time.

Just roasted a sweet potato for lunch to try this!Don't need butter in recipe. Just sliced one potato, tossed with olive oil, and sea salt and fresh ground pepper. Roasted for 10 minutes, turned slices over, and done in another 10. 20 minutes total cooking time! very tasty, and halfway good for me! Yum! I will be doing this again for 2 now that I see how easy and flavorful, with some crispness!

Delicious! I just used olive oil, salt and pepper and it was still very tasty. Simple to prepare and good enough for company!

Coincidentally, I was making curried chicken salad at the same time as these, and happened upon a recipe that called for both as an appetizer. Well, I wasn't having any company over, so had it for lunch. Just a spoonful of the salad on top of the chip and it was great!. Only thing I need to work on is making them crispier.

I accidentally had the oven on 350 for the first 10 minutes, so they weren't done yet at 15 (as other reviewers suggested). I waited until a couple had burned the edges, then took them out. They were the perfect texture, and absolutely wonderful. :)

Amazingly simple and good. I toss the sweet potato slices in the butter/olive oil before roasting them to make sure they're evenly coated.

This is a fun way to make sweet potatoes. Next time I'll just put the oo/butter combo on one side and see if that helps crisp them up better. I will also salt them at "half-time" and see if that helps the crispiness. I used a mandolin, but still had some burned edges. Delish with steak and salad.

I would suggest tossing the potatoes in the butter/oil mixture for a better coating. Ours burned. I also added parsnips for variety.

Very good. Almost burned em tho. Watch them when they get to bout 15 mins.

These are a staple in my house. I'd rather eat these than restaurant fries.

These were delicious and so easy. A mandolin would definitely help to make them uniform, but I'm not sure it's worth the trouble. I will make these again and again. Next time I may try a baking or Yukon gold potato. My kids loved them!!!

Simple and wonderful. Thanks for the rack roasting tip. This worked great. I skipped the butter untill the end to ah-hem "garnish" the sweet potatoes. Even the sticky sweet potato hating hubby loved em.. This recipe has given sweet potatoes a warm welcome to this house!

A mandolin makes quick work of the slicing and the pieces are uniform. A bit labor intensive to place teh slices individually and coat with oil. Nice side dish, only worth the effort when the usual side dishes are too tired.

I make this dish more often than any other dish on epicurious. (Roasted veggies are the my favorite.) These sweet potatoes are very delicious, quick, & simple. The only trick is to slice the sweet potatoes very evenly or the thinner bits will burn before the thicker pieces become wonderfully crispy. I've gotten to the point where I just use olive oil & I'm not sure there's a big difference. I also occasionally add chopped rosemary.

Yum...easy, too! I used olive oil...I doubled the recipe and used different seasonings (Italian...some rub/jerk spices I had...Mexican) on small batches. They were loved by all.

I used half "Take Control" margarine and half olive oil and roasted them on a rack on top of the cookie sheet (so I didn't have to turn them); they were also crisper than the test batch put directly on the cookie sheet.

Save your arteries and just use olive oil. It's just as good!

This is so simple and delicious! To make sure they come out crispy, cook them on a wire rack over a cookie sheet to catch any drippings.

EASY! SIMPLE! DELICIOUS! Try to use coarse salt if you can. Don't skimp!

These were excellent--provided I used genuine sweet potatoes, not yams. The yams were too tough, and the skins were stringy after roasting. Also, this is the kind of thing you have to make and eat immediately; re-heating just doesn't do it!

This makes a perfect side dish or snack. It's simple and delicious! A word of warning - avoid being "creative", such as skimping on salt or adding non-essential ingredients. This recipe must be followed as is for it to work well. Did I mention that you mustn't to easy on the salt?

Very easy and delicious. my children (age 3 and 6) made this with only a little supervision and help. they loved using pastry brushes! next time we will try the cinnamon and honey as suggested by another rater as that may swing it over from the "kids can make it" into the "kids will eat it" category.

The taste of sweet potato is great, but using these cooking times and temps the chips were burned on the outside but soft inside. I forgot to season before baking, and I'm sure if I season next time they will be crisper (salt draws out the moisture). Will make them again though!

i cut the wedges about 1/3" instead of so thin and also followed the advice of a previous rater who suggested the honey and cinnamon... this was a wonderful accompaniment to my Christmas game hens this year and will be for other dinners in the new year!

Roasted veggies are the best! A dab of honey and light sprinkle of quality cinnamon makes these sweet potatoes to die for! YUM!

These are great. I've made a similar recipe using Russet potatoes which is also very good. We like them crispy, so I slice them fairly thin.

Sweet potatoes are so delicious and nutritious it's great to have different ways tio make them. The key to this recipe is thin, even slicing of the potatoes.

Tasty side dish and alternative to traditional potato dishes. It's in my recipe file as an old standby

Easy and Delicious, and I don't like sweet potatoes! I made all the oil/butter sauce to brush on, but only need to brush on half, and I think they would have been soggy if I'd used it all. Otherwise followed recipe exactly, and we could not get enough! Served with "spicy Blackened Catfish" from this site(over spinach)....a Keeper of a menu!!

These were pretty and delicious- but far from crispy- I don't think the thickness (1/8") is too thick. I'll try again, but thinner. Given the potatoes thickness, softness, my guests weren't sure whether they should pick them up or use a fork! Oh well, I'll try again!

Didn't leave these in the oven long enough to get crispy - but I'm a big sweet potato fan, so it didn't matter. Served them with Italian meatloaf and a basic salad.

Fast and tasty. I've made and served these many times. For the cook from Dearborn, MI: I found that sticking to the 1/8th inch thickness (by using a mandolin) resulted in crisper slices, whereas anything thicker was soft (and still flavorful). I also found that my temptation to use "just a bit" more butter made the slices less crispy.

Great with seared scallops and mushrooms. Make sure to use unsalted butter or you will have a smoky kitchen- I did!

I liked this recipe (I love sweet potatoes almost any way), but the slices were not crisp, even though I followed the instructions. Hmm, I will try again.

What a wonderful recipe and easy to make! Nice alternative! My husband just couldn't get enough!

An alternative method for cooking the sweet potato slices that also produces delicious results is to saute them in olive oil in a pan. Just place them in one layer in the pan, saute until golden (about 3-4 minutes), flip and saute on the other side, 3-4 minutes. Note that any winter squash, except spaghetti squash, may be cooked in this fashion nad is much tastier this way than baked. Just remember to cut off the peel before or after you slice the squash. A nice way to serve either is with wedges of lime and garlic salt. Delicioso!

This recipe is quick and tasty. I highly recommend it. The coarse salt is very important. Don't make a substitution for it.

I don't normally like sweet potatoes, but these were great. I made them just as suggested and then lined two shallow bowls with the crispy sweet potato "chips" and served a nice beef stew on top of them.
