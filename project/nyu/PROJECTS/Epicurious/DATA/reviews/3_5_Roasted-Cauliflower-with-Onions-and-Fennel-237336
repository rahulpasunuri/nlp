I didn't have onions, so i subsituted leeks. And i had 1/2 the fennel and leeks, but even with those changes, I thought it was delicious!!

LOVED THIS! Very easy, very healthy, very tasty. Browned all the vegetables together (halved the recipe) & then put them in the oven. Omitted the marjoram. Cooked them with parmesan-sage-breadcrumb crusted pork chops from this site, which cook at the same oven temp. Hubby was very pleased (and me too!).

Simple, yummy and perfect on a cold winters night. Completely agree with writer from NY browning vegetables is the key.....I just tossed vegetables in the skillet and it worked great. I finished off with fresh grated parmesan. Definitely a keeper.

Great winter dish. Using green cauliflower really makes it beautiful. Browning the vegetables is key -- don't overcook at this stage or it will certainly turn to mush after 25 min in the oven.

Suggest Cavender's seasoning, golden raisins, and pecans as additions.

This is almost 4 forks, except it is a little dry. I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the marjoram sprigs because I didn't have any (and I suspectED any fresh herb would burn to a crip in a 425 degree oven). The technique of sauteeing the veggies first is very good, and they come out of the oven very heavily carmalized, almost black, and--unlike a lot of roasted raw cauliflower--soft inside. It's almost a perfect recipe, except it's a little dry. I served it with veal fricadelles (patties) and a beef stock deglazing sauce. The sauce ran into the roasted veggies, but even still . . . it's good, but it needs something. Maybe someone has some ideas to make it a little more succulent. The flavors are excellent and I really want to like this to a four fork level where I will make it again.

This was exceptional. The fennel really mellow. The juice from roast chicken dish sealed the deal (I bet any roast will do it, though).

I have made this twice now and am making it again this weekend to serve with lamb and a wild rice dish. It is simpe and delicious. Be sure not to overcook it (like I did the first time).
