This is a great recipe! I'm glad I found it again. I orig. found it featured on this site in the summer grilling section. It was part of a menu that included a amazing grilled shrimp recipe (w/ a sauce too).

Highly recommended recipe for peperonata; probably the best one on this site. Overall, the dish is very flavorful and the leftovers with peperonato make great pita sandwiches. The hardest thing was finding a sufficiently thick piece of sirloin in my area of town, as the stores cater to people who either don't eat meat or buy it in small pieces.

This was delicious! Great and easy, the peperonata made the recipe. I made it three days in advance and was absolutely divine. I rubbed the herbs into the steak too and had it in the fridge of 5 hours and then left it out for an hour before grilling. The steak was so tender too - followed the recipe exactly as written. Will definitely make again!

One word...Delicious I physically rubbed the herbs into the meat rather than just sprinkle it as it says in in the recipe and I only let it sit for about 3 hours and it came out great. Not to mention very, very simple!!!

Fantastic weeknight meal for a house of hungry carnivores. My young teens loved the peperonata, too, capers and all.

Served this to 12 people on Labor Day, by doubling everything and we had no leftovers. It was fabulous and really easy!

This was very tasty and not too complicated to make. It is definitely a "special occasion" receipe to keep on hand.
