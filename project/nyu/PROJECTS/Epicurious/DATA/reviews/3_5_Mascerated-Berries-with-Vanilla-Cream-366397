On a hot summer night, in a cool air conditioned house, after sharing a delicious hot sausage lasagna and antipasto salad with family and friends, this dessert put my guests over the top. Light, flavorful, summery, and so easy. I served the berries in stemmed red wine glasses with the vanilla cream on top. Lovely ending to a wonderful evening.

Simple; easy to make and the sour cream in the vanilla cream really gives it a great and different taste. Looks great in a nice old fashioned glass!
