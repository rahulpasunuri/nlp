This was a tasty recipe! I felt strange putting fresh shrimp in the food processor since they're fleshy texture is part of what makes them so yummy. Might try frozen shrimp next time.

when i read this recipe my mouth watered. it sounds delicious. i would not use ponzu sauce though. i think vietnamese dipping sauce would be far more complimentary to the ingredients used. i am really looking forward to making these snacks.
