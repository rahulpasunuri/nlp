fantastic and so easy. i've made it with frozen green beans and corn instead of peas and it comes out delicious no matter what, as long as the broccoli is fresh and not overcooked.

This is a very good dish I've made several times for guests. Even my brother-in-law, who hates garlic, enjoyed this dish. It's easy, fast, and will even keep for a couple of days in the fridge if there are leftovers. I'd give it 3.5 forks if I could.

I did not prepare this dish, but had it served to me recently at a dinner party. It was delightful and very green! I've added it to my recipe collection for future use.
