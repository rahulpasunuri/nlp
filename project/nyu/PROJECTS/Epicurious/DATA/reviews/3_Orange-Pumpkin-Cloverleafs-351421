These rolls are easy and delicious. I never add salt to anything so they always come out perfect. Serve them warm with butter. They also freeze very well.

These rolls were very easy to make, & turned out just like the photo. From a previous review, I reduced the salt & used between 1/2 -3/4 t. Next time I will use 3/4 t. The orange flavor was dominant, & while the golden color was very rich, I wish the pumpkin flavor had been more pronounced. I served these tonight with a molasses butter, along with a hearty soup. Delicious.

Flavorful rolls that come together with not much effort. Enjoyed the amount of salt and the texture. May up the quantity of orange zest next time, however. See my write up and photos at my food blog, Sass & Veracity http://sassandveracity.typepad.com

OMG-Wonderful! Moist from the pumpkin and I loved the subtle flavor of the orange. The salt heightens the layered flavors and they were beautiful.

Too salty for my taste and I like salt! Difficult to clean the muffin pan after egg wash made rolls stick to the sides. Will not make them again.

My family really enjoyed these rolls. The orange and pumpkin flavors are subtle but as the recipe stated, that is intentional and makes them perfect to serve with almost anything. We enjoyed the leftovers for breakfast the next day.

Followed the recipe to the letter and my rolls turned out saltier than I would like. The pumpkin/orange flavor wasn't that strong. Some of the other roll recipes in the issue were far better than this one.
