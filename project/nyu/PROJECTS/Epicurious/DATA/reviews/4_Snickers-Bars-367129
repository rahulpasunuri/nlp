I made these with gluten free rice cereal (I am celiac) and everything turned out great. I agree with others, multiple steps and lots of time to make keeps me from possibly making it again BUT very delicious and a wonderful break for gluten free dessert. If I did make again I would break into smaller sizes (way too big portion as is) and make more coating (don't have the skills to make that part pretty yet).

Simply SICK! Yes, don't go in thinking that you are going to have these made in an hour. But mom always said "Good things come to those that wait." And it did. Hard to make? no. Just lots of steps as one reviewer says. Worth it? DEFINITELY. Will it be a hit at any event? SURE WILL!

Yum. These are very good but very rich. I will make them again (they were a big hit at a dinner party) but I will cut them into 24 pieces instead of 12 and melt a little more chocolate for the coating. I made the mistake of using a Silpat instead of parchment for the nougat and had to freeze it to get it off, but otherwise had no problems making this.

I was really excited about these and they are definitely good, but for the amount of time and work they take I'm not sure they're worth it. Very, very rich. I love rich desserts, but I think these were too rich.

These were great. I followed teh recipe exactly, and they came out perfect. Everyone was surpised at how well they came out.

I'm not a seasoned candy maker so this was really hard for us (yes, it took two people) to make. In the end, these snickers bars were DELICIOUS. Very rich, but a well-rounded, satisfying dessert. With that said, I'm not sure I'd make it again because it took such a long time. The most painful part is making the nougat--so you really have to pay attention to the steps and you MUST monitor the temperature of your sugar to get a smooth and thick consistency that the recipe requires. I also recommend that do the last (chocolate covering) in batches--meaning, keep the uncoated bars as cold as you can before spreading chocolate on them. They'll start to melt and it makes them hard to deal with.

I took two days to make this recipe, because really, there are a LOT of steps! We ate the snickers bars tonight straight out of the freezer, and they were GREAT! Not sure how to answer the question would I make it again. Once may have been enough. You rarely need something this rich and decadent to serve.
