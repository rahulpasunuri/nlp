These eggs are delicious. Mayo and mustard amts. should be switched. Whenever I serve, people ALWAYS ask me for this recipe.

This is my favorite deviled egg recipe, but I think the mustard/mayonnaise ratio should be reversed. I agree with the reviewer who said that these deviled eggs have a sophisticated taste. I like to slice my eggs horizontally and slice off the bottoms of each half to keep them stable when plated up. I've also added slivers of onion and smoked salmon on top.

I still have the taste of vomit in my mouth.

No thanks, Carl--no oysters in my eggs.

This recipe was a nice change of pace from the norm, but nothing to write home about. Definitely switch mustard/mayo ratios. I love deviled eggs, I have tried many recipes and variations, and I am surprised Epicurious doesn't have more recipes listed for the "deviled egg" recipe searcher. One of my all time favorite deviled egg recipes calls for smoked oysters, which is delish. If any other deviled egg fans are interested, let me know and I'll share the recipe with you.

For those who find this recipe too tart or vinegary, simply add a bit of sugar to taste and you'll love it.

If you look at the ingredients, you come up with a lot of vinegar, so yes, they are tart, but don't let that deter you. They're still very good, especially if you like tart. I garnished with paprika and cayenne, and that made a tasty addition.

Thesewere the worst deviled eggs I ever had. They tasted like straight mustard. I tried adding more mayo to even it out, but they still tasted like mustard.

i just made this recipe for Easter. i am not a brown spicy mustard fan, so i combined brown, horseradish and dijonnaise mustards. i added more tabasco sauce for extra kick. overall, i was pleased with the taste and outcome.

I just made these eggs and they are terrible. I too switched the mustard/mayo amounts and they still were just too tart.

I also reversed the mayo/mustard amounts. These eggs were made for my christmas party at work and dinner at home. They disappeared quickly each time. I loved the mix of flavors. This has become my deviled egg recipe!

good if you don't love mayo, but like tabasco and eggs. i made as-is and didn't find it too mustardy.

Reversed mayo/mustard amounts, added a little more vinegar to taste, and topped with paprika and capers - yum!

I made these eggs for a party at work. I followed the directions and reversed the mayo/mustard amounts. I thought that there was a lot more mustard in the eggs than there should have been and not one person at the party commented to me that they liked my eggs. I will not make them again. Disappointing.

Just what I was looking for.

Ok, reverse the mayo and mustard, result: a great dish. Everyone at the party wanted the recipe. A very sophisticated taste.

Having made deviled eggs for two to one hundred people, I can assure you the mustard and the mayo quantities are reversed.

I haven't tried this but think the mayo & mustard amounts may be reversed.
