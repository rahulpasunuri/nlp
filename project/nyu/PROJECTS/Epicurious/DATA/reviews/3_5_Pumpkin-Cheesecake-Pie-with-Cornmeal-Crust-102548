THis was great - I will def make it again. Lavern - why do you have to ruin the rating by posting your opinion 15 times? Do you think your opinion should hold more weight than every one elses? Epicurious editor: Is there anything we can do about people like Lavern who post more than once?

Sorry. The only thing I liked about this recipe was how easy it was to make. I did not like the crust or the filling. I threw it away. I will not make this again or save this recipe.

great! Made this for Thanksgiving for people who do not like traditional pumpkin pie, and they liked it! I too do not think pumpkin pie is that great, but loved this recipe. Great for cheesecake fans, but satifies a "pie requirement", i.e. the holidays. The cornmeal crust is a nice change. yum!

This recipie has become a traditional Christmas gift for a couple of bachelor friends of mine. Every year as the holiday season rolls around, they start talking about this pie as their eyes glaze over and they begin to salivate a little. I usually wind up with more custard than will fill the pie shell, so I put the remainder in a small ramekin and bake along with the pie. The custard, even without the crust is delightful!

Yum! I brought this to a friend's house and forgot the whipping cream - she topped it with sour cream of all things and it was great...

Excellent pie! I made this along w/ a traditional pumpkin pie because I was cooking for a finicky crowd. This one was completely devoured. Only one person (a 10 year old) ate my traditional pie. I received many compliments on the cornmeal crust as well. I liked the taste and also thought the dough was very easy to work with. The filling looks much better after cooking than a traditional pumpkin pie (no cracks.)

Made this once for B-day of a friend who loves cheesecake and also pumpkin pie (I was looking for a quick version of pumpkin cheesecake) The cheesecake part was not at all noticeable (it's just like a nice pumpkin pie), so it didn't really work for that need. Also, the lemon flavor was a bit too strong. However, I did decide to decrease the lemon a little and make it again for the thanksgiving pumpkin pie. The cheese makes it less watery than a standard custard pumpkin pie, so the crust gets crisper and the filling holds up better, with nice clean slices. (I used a standard pastry crust, not the cornmeal one) Got glowing comments all around.

I made this recipe for my office holiday party. Everyone loved it! The use of cream cheese adds a nice touch to the traditional pumpkin pie. I will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe. Not a crumb was left. Everyone loved it. Even those that do not care for pumpkin pie.

I am not a pumpkin lover, but everyone RAVES about this pie. It has become a requirement to enter my brother's house for Thanksgiving. I have used a cookie crumb crust in the past and this time tried a classic graham cracker crust both of which are better than the cornmeal. Two Thumbs Up!!

My husband and I both LOVE cheesecake, so were excited to try this. However, it seemed to be more of a cheesy PUMPKIN PIE than a pumpkin cheesecake. Maybe there should be less pumpkin for it to be more like a "cheesecake with pumpkin flavors". I added more lemon and also sultanas (golden raisins) because I was trying to copy a cheescake that we had a potluck once. It turned out really well with those extra things. Perhaps without them it would've been too ordinary.... All said and done, I will make it again, it was lovely!

The pumpkin filling in this recipe is delicious. I used a hazelnut crust instead of the cornmeal. I took this to a potluck and heard people whispering about how good it was. I will definitely make this again. It is a good alternative to pumpkin pie.

This recipe was fine, but nothing to rave about. The filling was smooth and nicely flavored, but the crust was a bit dense and chewy -- perhaps I used a bit too much water. I served it at a potluck, and someone else brought a Sarah Lee frozen pumpkin pie that was finished well before this was. Oh well.

I made this recipe in an 11 inch tart with the pastry dough recipe for the crust. The crust:inside ratio is much better as a tart. It was so easy to make and everyone loved it. I'm making 2 for christmas this year!

This is a great recipe...no more custard pumpkin pies for me. I did however, use the gingersnap pecan crust from another recipe, and low fat cream cheese. A great combination of flavors. This crust is best when eaten soon. After a couple days it gets a little soggy......but still tastey

This was my first pumpkin pie ever, and it turned out so well, and really wasn't that much work. Turned out beautifully, got rave reviews, have ingredients left over, I just might make another one today!!

I loved this pumpkin filling. I didn't think the crust was anything special though -- it neither added nor detracted from the recipe. I will definitely make this again, but next time I will try a different crust -- the filling alone rates four forks, and it deserves a four fork crust to go with it.

i have made this pie 2 thanksgivings in a row, my family has enjoyed it so much. it's a nice alternative to traditional pumpkin pie. i knew it was a hit when my husbands' whole family asked to take pieces home after thanksgiving dinner!

Rave comments from everyone at Thanksgiving. I made 2 pies the night before and they kept well. The recipe is not too sweet a perfect balance. My family asked me to make it again for Christmas.

I made this for a pre-holiday celebration and everyone loved this version of pumpkin pie. It has a nicer, firmer texture than most regular pumpkin pie recipes. And the crust! The crust makes great pie-crust cookies as well (a little jam in the center...um-um good)

This was delightful! My husband and I loved the unique cornmeal crust and the subtle lemony tang which contrasted well with the pumpkin-cream cheese texture. I would definitely serve this to guests and may make it a regular at Thanksgiving in addition to the familiar version.

This pie is very easy to make and it has a much different texture than traditional pumpkin pie. The crust is very crisp like a shortbread cookie. The lemon adds the right amount of zest. Good recipe if you're looking for a new twist on a pumpkin pie.
