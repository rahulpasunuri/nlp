Excellent! The lime juice and olive oil really pull it together. I eliminated the Fritos (healthier) put on romaine lettuce as a salad for lunch. Really good!

We made a couple of modifications that really improved the salad. Use green onion instead of white, which is too strong for most salads raw. Put tons of fresh lime in. Also, do not mix the cilantro into the dressing - it's better mixed into the salad. Finally, we added only 1/2 the amount of chicken and replaced with about a pint of chopped cherry (or grape) tomatoes.

I made this on a frantic week night and we just put the shredded chicken mixed with the vinaigrette into flour tortilla shells with everything else cold the first night as a quick burrito. Second night I heated the chicken mixture slighty and the black beans and tried it again with shredded cheddar cheese. Finally we used the last of the chicken mixture,cheddar cheese and tortillas to make quesadillas for lunch. They were all tasty and a big improvement on other chicken recipes for burritos and quesadillas. It was an easy, efficient way to have three weeknight meals for two that wasn't boring. Next time I'll try it as a salad one night too. For the burritos we skipped the Fritos, added chopped tomatoes, olives, shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream.

I had made just a small amount of this to test before deciding to serve it as an appetizer. I used almost all of the ingredients but the exact measurments were not to recipe but still very good. I added a scant amount of mayo/sour cream to bind it and served it on toasted cornbread rounds with a sprinkling of crushed Tostidos on top (I thought the Fritos would be a little too strong in flavor). Next time I will make Jalapeno corn bread rounds just to heat things up. 4-forks because it was so easy and really good.

I have made this numerous times. Added extra chipotles, doubled the dressing, added cheese and olives...loved it!

This is such a delicious salad! I've made it for girls-night-out dinners and a few other times when I want something delicious and unusual. Everyone raves and wants the recipe!

Lots of possibilities for substitutions and additions - a good basic spicy dressing.

The dressing makes this the best. I can dress it up for down by adding fresh corn, sliced red onion, jicima or just with pasta. it is great.

I have made this salad a few times and I think it is great. Make more dressing than the recipe calls for and use more chipotles in adobo if you like a bit more kick.

This took a bit longer than I expected, but it was still delicious and I would definitely make it again. I think I could reduce the prep time by making the dressing in advance. This was the first time I've used canned chipotles in adobo and we really enjoyed the kick they gave the dressing. A great supper for a hot summer evening!

This salad has been a huge hit with everyone who has eaten it. Great use of leftover chicken or I have used white breast chicken nuggets cut up without compromising the recipe at all. I alway make more dressing than recipe calls for.

We didn't care for this. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just didn't work. We served it over lettuce, but it needed more dressing or something. I won't make this again. The dressing - though - by itself was tasty.

This is a great salad! We liked it using tortilla shells as a wrap.

My husband and I loved this. We skipped the fritos and still thought it was a great salad with lots of flavor.

A complete waste of time and ingredients. Threw every bit of it out and had to whip together something else for my family and I to eat that night. Truly the worst recipe I've ever tried at this website. Blech.

I've made this dish several times and it has been a huge hit with family and friends. I doubled the dressing (seemed too dry the first time I made it). Defiitely a great summer meal.

I made the recipe as written except for adding come cherry tomatoes and resting the salad on a bed of butter lettuce. I added a bit more adobo as well and it still was not too spicy. We really enjoyed this and it was pretty quick and easy. My husband and friends enjoyed the leftovers even without the fritos or avocados.

So-so dish. I found it a bit bland. Maybe it needs more dressing?

This is delicious and easy. I prepared it as written and served to guests for a casual dinner. They cleared their plates. I will definitely make it again.

Great recipe. I added extra chipotles for a little more heat and took it to a picnic where it got rave reviews.

Avocado answer: The easiest way to cube avocados is to cut them in half, remove the pit, and cube them by cutting through the avocado without cutting the skin. Then you scoop the cubes out of the skin with a spoon. It saves having to peel them. I think they just left out the scooping part.

Haven't made this yet but before I do, I have to know why you would leave the peel on the avocado pieces?

Very quick and easy throw together when you have a night short on time. This was a bit "dry" so definately double the dressing ingredients, and reserve half to pour over the salad after it's made up. We added shredded cheddar cheese and black olives on top, which really kicked it up a notch

Left out the cilantro -- didn't have any and some of us aren't crazy about it. Thought it was delicious and easy. After assembling the salad, minus the lettuce, I thought there would be leftovers, so I served the chicken and lettuce separately and added about a half pint of grape tomatoes, halved, to the lettuce. I doubled the dressing ingredients (except the cilantro) but didn't use all of it -- added it the next day to the leftovers. And everyone added their own Fritos. Great for a hot day's lunch.

This was just alright. Probably won't make it again. Definitely needs the corn chips.
