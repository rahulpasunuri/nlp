Excellent savory side dish. I cooked and assembled the leeks and squash the day before then added the remainder just before baking. Subbed pecans for hazelnuts due to allergy. Very nice and will definitely make with Christmas turkey.

Simply the best! Used two 2 lb bags of chunked, peeled butternut squash, 10 oz. of chevre, and everyone raved about this; it can feed 12-15 easily as a side dish. B.J. Harrick

Thought this was good, and will make it again. Next time will add more fresh sage. The amount listed didn't give it enough flavor; in fact, I could barely taste it. The toasted hazelnuts are a must.

I'm no a fan of squash, but it looked interesting so I wanted to try. I added a sweet potato to the squash, substituted onions for leeks, and used pine nuts and sliced almonds because I couldn't find hazelnuts. It was delicious and looked great. Definitely a keeper to cook again

Awesome dish! Not only is squash sold peeled and seeded, leeks are sold cut and cleaned at Wegman's making the dish exceptionally easy to prepare.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a great hit. Like many others I decreased the butter and sauteed the leeks in combo of olive oil and butter, but otherwise followed the recipe as is. I would say the only drawback is that it is VERY rich. For a Thanksgiving dinner with so many other dishes, it felt a little over the top. I love goat cheese, but I think I would maybe decrease that the next time I made it just to make it a little less rich. That said, it was a hit.

I Made this dish for a fall buffet dinner with pork tenderloin etc. I followed the recipe but added about two cups cubes roasted russet potatoes. It was very popular with several people asking for the recipe. I think it might be even better with a topping of smoked bacon crumbles...for the non vegetarians!

This was incredibly good. Made it as written for Christmas dinner & thrilled all the adults at the table. Made it again for friends, but definitely lightened the recipe-- lots less butter, half-n-half--but still got great reviews. I did use about a third less leeks the 2nd time & liked the texture better. The only problem I had with this recipe was finding hazelnuts after Christmas--I would have stocked up if I had known the stores in our area only carried them for the holidays.....

Added sliced potato (about 2 parts to 3 parts butternut), omitted the leeks, used almonds, and added romano along w/ the goat cheese. This was pretty fantastic, but then anything covered in cream and cheese would be.

I don't know what it is, but the combination of butternut squash, leeks, goat cheese and nuts is just delicious. I was a doubter, but both times I've made this it disappears. I have substituted regular yellow onions for the leeks and toasted walnuts for the hazelnuts and that combination was good, too.

I wish there was a 3.5 fork rating! To me a four-forker should make your eyes roll back in your head :-) I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and it was great. After reading the reviews, I also used a larger amount of leeks. Substituted goat cheese crumbles for the soft goat cheese and used a little less than the recipe called for. Also substituted toasted walnuts for the hazelnuts because I had them on hand. The leftovers reheated beautifully and tasted just as good (if not better) the second time around.

Rating: 4
Not only is this always a hit at Thanksgiving, I can use the leftovers to make a tasty soup. Just put all the remaining gratin into your food processor, and add chicken broth and cream until the consistency is right. I like to keep it a little chunky. Warm it up on the stove top and serve it with a few chopped, toasted hazelnuts and a roasted red pepper puree.

This was my absolute favorite dish this Thanksgiving. I wouldn't change a thing. A tip for working with butternut squash - zap it in the microwave for three minutes before starting to peel and chop. It softens the skin just enough to make it workable.

Rating: 4
I was worried about the richness of this dish so I cut the butter and cream by half, and used about 4.5 oz of goat cheese instead of the whole log. I also doubled the sage (and I think it could've been tripled). Once it was assembled I was doubtful (it looked a bit bland), but once the cheese softened and blended with the cream and leeks, it turned out rather sublime. My guests ate all but a spoonful of it!

Rating: 4
The first time I made this dish, I made is the night before Thanksgiving. My husband ate half of it before I could get it into the fridge for the next day. We grow most of our own veggies so this is a perfect seasonal winter dish. I add A LOT more leeks. I generally use 5-6 large leeks. Then I usually end up doubling the amount of goat cheese because I use more veggies. This has really become a go to dish for pot lucks or parties because it's so simple and elegant. I recommend it for anyone who is entertaining vegetarians.

Wow, these reviews are so positive! I thought this dish was WAY too heavy. 1 cup of cream? A whole 5 oz of goat cheese? I thought this tasted like goat cheese and cream stew. Such stellar ingredients but not delicate at all. I think if I ever made this again, I would double the sage (couldn't taste it), and just serve it as leeks with roasted squash, some hazelnuts on top, and a crumble of goat cheese (with pork tenderloin or chicken).

This is really tasty. However, I didn't know leeks were one of those 'sandy' veggies and so I didn't wash them as well as I should of. It came out gritty. I will make this again and do a better job, because despite the grit, it tastes really, really, really good!

This is so, so good. A very nice winter dish paired with a simple salad. I didn't change anything, but agree with a past review suggesting a touch more leeks. And next time I might try pecans instead of hazelnuts. (Also, one reviewer was having difficulty husking the hazelnuts. Try rubbing them in a towel right after toasting. That will pull most of the husks off.)

Rating: 4
Oh my gosh, this recipe is soooo good. All my guests LOVED this on Saturday board game night, and it was pretty easy to put together (save prepping the squash, that's always a pain....) I used half and half to decrease the fat a little bit, and I don't think we missed a thing. Really unique flavors, and every piece of the recipe really adds something to the overall flavor. We did find out my gf is a bit allergic to hazelnuts though, so maybe next time I'll have to try almonds or walnuts.

This was a huge hit for Christmas dinner. I didn't change a thing about the recipe. I made the dish the day prior and chilled unbaked as suggested. It was so easy to just pour on the cream and hazelnuts and bake right before dinner. Favorite new dish of the year!

Rating: 4
I would like to eat this every day for the rest of my life. Yes. The only adjustment I would make (for my own interest/sake) would be more leeks. They disappeared a little bit into the squash and I didn't really have enough to layer all that well as the recipe suggests. Anyway, this was a really fast dish and everyone was really excited by a butternut squash dish that doesn't involve brown sugar.

Rating: 4
Everyone who tasted this dish at Christmas dinner loved it. However, it looked too "different" for some guests, so not everyone was willing to try it. Also, I found it to be a lot of work to put together. I especially had trouble with husking the hazelnuts, although they did add some pretty special flavor to the finished dish. Do plan on making this ahead of time and refrigerating it - not the sort of dish you want to be dealing with at the last minute.

I cut down on cooking time by steaming the squash for 15 minutes instead of roasting it. Still delicious!

This seemed too easy, but since I didn't have a lot of time, I decided to give it a try. Was SOOO happy that I did. Everyone raved about it. Will make again...and again and again!

I had my reservations about the combination of flavors in this dish but they came together seamlessly. It smells and tastes like winter holidays and is much more attractive than the image makes it appear. It also reheats well. I made it for a beer tasting and the host remarked it was an apt palate cleanser. The amount of squash can be reduced by about a pound, and the hazelnuts should be as fresh as possible.

My brothers, who normally wouldn't touch butternut squash with a ten-foot pole, wolfed this down and raved about it afterward, and I happily ate the leftovers for lunch the next two days (and I hate leftovers). I might increase the quantity of leeks in this next time, but all in all, it was simply phenomenal.

i can't even begin to explain how pleased my taste buds were with this dish! i added about a pound of kale to the leeks in the last couple minutes of sauteing, and used only about 1 tbsp of butter to try to slightly offset some of the guilt of all the cream to my brain ... otherwise made as written ... served with grilled chicken breasts and a rocket salad ... one of my guests asked if it would be crude to lick her plate ... had i not had company, i probably would have ... next time i'll be sure to serve with some bread to sop up the creamy sauce goodness .. there will definitely be a next time

This was such an amazing dish. Def prepare early on, before you have company. I decided to use russet potatoes and yams instead of butternut squash and it was amazing. I also used a little veggie stock with the cream for added flavor. For my non vegetarian friends, I served this with a great apple and sage sausage, salad, and bread. It was so yummy, and I will be making this again for sure. Comfort food at its finest!

Well this was actually better than 3 forks but I try to reserve the 4 forks for an out of body experience! That said, I had a hard time not going back for 3rd's.

I used feta instead of the goat and will try the original version when I have company over. This was very very good and can't wait to make this again soon.

The first time I made this fabulous dish, I almost lost a finger chopping butternut squash - so time- consuming! But the pre-chopped stuff is not cheap, and not always very fresh, so for Easter 09, I tried it with sweet potatoes instead. Wow, it was fantastic! I also recommend skipping the "layering" step, you don't need to do this. Just mix the veggies all together, then put the cheese and cream on top and your guests will love it!

This recipe was fantastic. I am not a fan of leeks, so as a substitution I shredded brussel sprouts and sautéed them in place of the leeks. They made for a wonderful substitution and this dish turned out very hearty and could be used for a delicious vegetarian main course (and made great leftovers I might add).

This recipe turned out great! But my concern with the author is the suggestion to buy already cut squash. Prepared foods are wrapped in products that are not easy to recycle. By buying the vegetables whole and preparing them yourself, you are able to reduce waste and improve your prep skills.

OMG. Soo delicious! We did half and half instead of cream, made goat cheese pieces smallish, and made sure all ingredients were eventually in the creamy "sauce" toward the end of cooking, with just the top sticking up. You don't have to totally husk the hazelnuts -- we did about half before saying to heck with it, and they were great! Chopped them smaller than the photo shown here, which was perfect. We made this for us with a salad and yummy crusty bread, as suggested by someone else. Now I wish it were the holidays where I'd need to bring a dish somewhere! Well, 10-11 months to go!

Best new vegetable dish we've tried in a long time. The biggest hassle IMHO was the hazelnuts. Problem solved when I found roasted and husked hazelnuts at Whole Foods in their bulk foods area a few months ago. I bought a large amount and froze them, and now just take out what I need for this recipe. I regularly make it ahead of time as the recipe suggests which is especially helpful for big holiday meals and when having guests over.

I made this for Thanksgiving with friends and it was barely touched. I wanted a different twist on Butternut squash and this was very different, but not that good. I just threw out all the leftovers.

This was excellent - and I don't even like squash! However, maybe it was the type of goat cheese I used, but the dish didn't reheat well. I will try a different kind of goat cheese next time. And I think (although my husband disagreed) that it could do without the hazelnuts.

Very easy to make, though I don't know I would use hazelnuts again. I did the Julia Child method of husking (thanks to the poster below for that!), but it was still a real hassle - and mess!! - that I wasn't prepared for. My guests loved the dish and even asked to take home the leftovers. I can see how it would really travel well as a dish to take to a dinner party. I made it the night before and just threw it in the oven (remembered the nuts but almost forgot cream on top step!) about an hour before dinner. To make it even easier, I used the already-cubed squash from Trader Joe's. If not for the hazelnuts, it would be a dream recipe.

Made this yesterday for Thanksgiving - huge hit. I followed the recipe more or less, but I had about a 5 lb. squash and more leeks than called for. Even so, I didn't really have enough ingredients to make 2 layers of everything, so I just did squash-leeks-squash. I added a shallot and some garlic to the leeks and tripled the sage. Forgot the nuts entirely - I would use them next time. Flavor was delicious but I felt that it was just a touch dry (I used the full cup of cream), so I might increase that a bit next time and use half and half for a more liquid texture.

Rating: 4
10 forks! This dish was raved about at our Thanksgiving dinner today. I followed the recipe pretty much to the "T". The only modification I made was that I broke the goats cheese up into smaller pieces and distributed the cheese amongst the squash in such a way to ensure that the squash and cheese were married in every bite. This one is a winner!

First, I made this in half the quantity listed (as i usually do for two), second, I used acorn squash, which I prefer, and is more flavorful anyhow -- but otherwise exactly as written. As another reviewer said, I too love these things individually, but this didn't come together for me either. There's something it's missing to hold it all together -- in the sense of both texture and flavor -- but I can't spot it. Perhaps I was expecting something more like a gratine, where the cheese binds things together. Being goat cheese does not do that, I feel it lacks cohesiveness. My girlfriend thought it was good, but I'm rating it just O.K., as in I'll /probably/ eat /some/ of the leftovers.

I have made this a few times, and every time it has been an enormous hit. The first time I followed the recipe precisely, and I found that toasting, shelling and peeling the hazelnuts extremely tedious and time consuming.

Absolutely delish--- have made this multiple times, as is. The only alteration I've found helpful is to cut the butternut squash the long way and then in 1/4 inch slices before roasting-- it cuts down the roasting time and the slices arrange nicely in the pan.

Wow. What an elegant and unusual combination of flavors and textures! Although I could certainly see serving this with poultry or pork; for an everynight dinner, I let it shine as the main dish, with a simple brown rice accompaniment. (Vegetarians, note!) My husband declared it "decadent!" He's right. PS to the cook from Knoxville, it's true, you really shouldn't make this if you don't adore goat cheese.

This was a great side dish for Christmas dinner. I assembled it the day before and refrigerated overnight. I was concerned about the fat and calories so I substituted half and half for the cream, and instead of a full cup I used half a cup. I used plenty of salt and pepper when roasting the squash, and a bit more chopped sage than the recipe calls for. I was afraid that it might overpower the other flavors, but it didn't at all. The blend of flavors was wonderful, and it was a nice change from the usual roasted veggies I make.

It was so good! I didn't have leeks, but used shallots instead. Because of diet restrictions, I used olive oil instead of butter to saute and a sheep's feta for the cheese.

Yum - this was very good. I dont know why anybody would say it needed more salt...if you use a good goat cheese, the tanginess of the cheese should add plenty of flavor.

You can tell by looking at the ammount of cheese and cream that it's not exactly light cooking, so...if you don't want it rich don't make it :)

I made this as the squash dish for a big Thanksgiving dinner (serving 12). Of all the recipes I was attempting, this was the one I was most skeptical about. I LOVE butternut squash and I make it quite often --- just with butter, maple syrup, salt and pepper. I wasn't sure how goat cheese was going to mesh with the flavor of the squash... I was pleasantly surprised! It was really good. The flavor of the leeks was just great. I didn't have any hazelnuts so I had to use walnuts --- it was good, but I'm sure it would have been better with hazelnuts. I make it a bit less chuncky than the picture suggests, and it was still a bit too chucky for me. When I make it again, I will half- mash the squash. I like my flavors infused a bit more. I recommend this recipe!

This was the star of our dinner. Next time I would cut the cream or lighten it, use more sage and maybe cut the squash in smaller dice.

Served with T-day meal and found it really excellent. I sauted minced mushrooms with the leeks, added about 2 more ounces goat cheese, used 2x the amount of sage,and topped with a light layer of parmesean cheese (more for salt than anything.)and nixed the hazelnuts (I had none) I would absolutely remcommend making this for any holiday dinner affair.

I served this as a main course for a simple vegetarian thanksgiving. It was enjoyed by everyone. I used half & half mixed with nonfat milk and it turned out fine. I will make this again.

This was delicious! Everyone went back for second helpings with this one. I used half and half in place of cream. I didn't end up with nearly enough leeks or squash to do the 2 layers though.

We had this dish for thanksgiving and it was really good! The oven time for the squash only took about 15 minutes for me. The only complaint I would have is that the sage was not really evident with the amount....next time (and there will be one) I'll add more sage. Very easy to make. If you like this one, try the Sweet Potato and Sausage Gratin with Thyme -- still my all time favorite for Thanksgiving or for any meal with friends.

This was delicious, but very rich. We had it as a main course along with a green salad for a light dinner.

made this for faux thanksgiving and friends were very complimentary... didn't grease the pan, but did add a little garlic to the squash while roasting which gave more robust flavor and cut down on salt. next time may try the fat free 1/2&1/2 and will add a few more leeks... delicious!

everyone loved it! i didn't use any cream or broth. although it was more like a casserole, it was delicious. the toasted hazelnuts are a must.

This was excellent! I halfed the recipe and used low-fat cream. I have lots of fresh sage in my herb garden and could finally use some of it in this recipe. It was so good that next time I will make it as a vegetarian main dish!

Followed recipe exactly and halved for family and made again for staff party. It was easy and I was asked for recipe. My teenager who never likes anything even liked!

This was to die for! I confess, I used the heavy cream called for in the recipe. Why fight it? It's the holiday season. (I did use cooking spray instead of the additional T. of butter to grease the pan). I actually had goat cheese, whipping cream and butternut squash on hand and it seemed like Fate that I make this recipe. My husband and I both loved it. The sweetness of the squash and sauteed leeks, the slight sourness of the goat cheese and the crunch of the hazelnuts complemented each other perfectly. This would be great for Thanksgiving, particularly an all-adult one. I have a feeling kids would look upon it with a jaundiced eye.

I loved this dish. It was so easy and soooo rich and yummy. Everyone at my book club meeting loved it and I will definately be making it for Thanksgiving. I actually made it exactly as written and would do so again.

Great, simple dish. The earthiness of the sage and goat cheese really makes the flavor of the squash come out! I also used pine nuts and it worked well.

halved the recipe; easily served 5 hungry people. Used Fat Free 1/2 & 1/2.... Wonderful variety of flavors and textures. Will definately be served on my Thanksgiving table.

I plan to "test-drive" this before Thanskgiving, substituting evalporated skim milk for the cream. It usually makes a decent and healthier alternative.

I don't understand the fuss; I made this following the directions exactly and it was terrible. Husband ate it, but I found flavors flat and boring.

This was very, very good. I used the cream but think that I can get away without using it next time. The picture looks like there's no cream. I'm trying to cut fat where I can.

This will definitely be on my Thanksgiving menu this year - it was both beautiful and delicious! Only change I made was pine nuts instead of hazelnuts. (I just don't like hazelnuts.)

Two pkgs. of peeled squash is 4 lbs., so I upped the leeks to 4 cups, used 2 containers of goat cheese, and a 13 x 9 casserole, it was perfect. The roasted squash makes the difference, 'twill be on the menu for Thanksgiving.

I made this dish as a test drive for Thanksgiving. It was great! My kids loved it too. I would cut the cream a little and add some chicken stock.
