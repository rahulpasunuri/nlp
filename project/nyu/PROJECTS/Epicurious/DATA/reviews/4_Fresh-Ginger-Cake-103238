Wow, this is an exceptional ginger cake, and very easy (apart from having to peel/chop or grate the ginger!) I did not have enought molasses so made it up 1/4 cup of golden syrup and honey and I did add about 1/4 cup of chopped crystalized ginger, but I don't think these changes were enough to alter such a good recipe. If you can actually wait I think this cake gets better as it sits a few days, but that takes an awful lot of willpower.

Amazing cake. I subbed the flour for whole spelt, wwheat pastry and coconut flour. Subbed 3/4 cup coconut sap + 1/4 cup applesauce for the sugar. Served with unsweetened vanilla whipped cream sprinkled with cinnamon. A low GI version.

Like others, I'd recommed adding chopped crystallized ginger (which mellows out wonderfully as it bakes) and dark beer instead of water. The beer (a porter or stout) adds an incredible level of depth and complexity to this spectacular cake.

Excellent! I used half cup fresh ginger, added a half cup of finely chopped candied ginger and doubled the spices (pepper, cinnamon and cloves). I cut the oil in half and substituted with applesauce. A hit!

A spectacularly delicious ginger cake. I did head some reviewers warnings about stringy ginger, and wanted to try something to avoid this. So, I substituted the water for milk, heated the milk, and steeped the fresh ginger for 5 min. Then I pressed the mixture through a sieve to extract as much of the ginger flavor as possible. Worked beautifully; wonderful flavor & no strings. Served with cinnamon whipped cream, salty caramel drizzle, & candied orange zest. Was a huge hit at our thanksgiving party. Will definitely be adding this to my holiday repertoire.

Made as written. It was beautiful, but not fully cooked in the middle using the "spring back" methodology in the recipe. Definitely stick a skewer in there and make sure it comes out clean. It was SO good though. I still got tons and tons of compliments.

I made this cake for a 4th of July party and paired it with gelato from Philadelphia's capo giro. I received rave reviews from everyone. It was moist, with a great ginger taste. Not too sweet, and not too spicy. Details: I followed the recipe exactly. I grated the ginger using a cheese grater, and didn't find it stringy at all. I shop at a small produce market, so the ginger was probably fresh. I used the smaller (but not smallest) side of a cheese grater for this. I also used a scale to measure 4 oz, and it came out to about 3/4 of a cup.

Fabulous! I used pureed ginger (found a 4.5 oz jar) which worked really well, no textural issues. Served slices with homemade caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream (not homemade!) - the sauce soaked into the cake which made it really heavenly. I'm not a baker by any means but this is really tasty stuff and pretty easy. It also kept very well wrapped in plastic wrap for 2 days before I served it

Looking for recipe for holiday gift cakes. To those who've tried this one, would it work as a mini-loaf with lemon glaze, wrapped in cellophane and tied up with a ribbon? The concern is that it would stale too easily?

I had a terrible time trying to figure out how to measure 4 oz. ginger. I finally used 1/2 cup. It wasn't too gingery. The other thing that puzzled me was the "vegetable oil, preferably peanut." Is that considered a vegetable oil? Those are my questions. Now my review: the cake was delicious & I'll make it again, perhaps with a creme fraiche kind of icing. Thanks. Linda P.

I used pureed ginger from a jar, which gave the same flavor without leaving stringy fibers in the cake. Serve it the way they do at Park Chow in San Francisco with pumpkin ice cream, caramel sauce, and whipped cream. It's so good, it's unbelievable. You'll be over the moon.

I just wanted to add to my previous review. A rotary grater works WONDERFULLY for grating the ginger. I buy ginger in bulk from Asian markets, peel it, and freeze it so I always have some on hand. It took about ten minutes to grate all the ginger. A food scale makes measuring easy. I usually add 5-6 oz of grated ginger to account for the weight of condensation and my own preferences. Also, for cupcakes, bake at 400 and start checking them at about 15 minutes.

Rating: 4
This was amazing. I made cupcakes with a cream cheese icing. Next time, I think I'll try making a layer cake. I'd give it five forks, if I could. I decreased the oil to 3/4cup and it still produced a moist cake even though I forgot about them in the midst of party prep and baked them a few minutes too long. The taste is a little more intense the day after but they taste amazing right out of the oven. Also, the leftover cupcakes were still moist 3- 4 days later! Next time, I think I might double the pepper out of personal preference, but these were a hit.

For those of you that had problems with stringy ginger, I would suggest buying ginger from an Asian or Indian market. Generally, it's much fresher (and cheaper) there, since it is used heavily in their cooking. Check the skin---the more transparent it is, the fresher. At the supermarket (including Whole Foods), not as many people are buying large quantities of ginger, so it is bound to be less fresh, and from experience, there is a noticeable difference in the ginger. Also, you can buy a special Japanese grater for ginger from Asian markets which eliminates problems with stringiness.

This is terrific; I agree with the cook from SF who says: Best. Ginger. Cake. Ever. I added some chopped crystallized ginger (I tripled the recipe and subbed out 2 oz of fresh with 2 oz of crystallized). I can't wait to make this again.

Read over some of the prior reviews, and simply wanted to add a few things. I found the ginger easy to grate using a medium holes microplaner. Also, I used a 9 1/2" spring form pan (my round 9" cake pan was too shallow to use). Had a tiny bit of seepage at the onset, but had placed a round cookie sheet beneath the pan which caught it, thus avoiding burning on the bottom of the oven. The spring form pan made for very easy removal once baked and cooled. Finally, I sprinkled the top with powdered sugar, giving it a prettier, more finished look. The cake is super moist and the the little bit left over was equally delicious.

Thia was absolutely delicious! Nice and easy to make, and tasted really good too... I didn't have a large enough cake tin, so I made two separate cakes which worked out pretty well. I used vegetable oil rather than peanut, and I used slightly less than the 1 cup recommended. Otherwise I followed the instructions to the letter. Highly recommended.

This cake had really great flavor but I had a few problems and am hoping you all can help me out. First can someone tell me what kind of pan I should be using? I used a 9X2 round pan (from the grocery store; I was in a rush) and the cake bubbled over and fell all over the floor of the oven. It also burned on the bottom, sides and top -- maybe because of the pan size issue. Last, it stuck to the parchment and I had a hard time peeling it off ... should I have greased the parchment? Thanks so much for your help! This is the first time I baked a cake!

I had this as "Dave's Ginger Cake" at Park Chow in SF last summer, and recreating it was a snap with some key ingredients from my trusty local Asian grocery store (H Mart in Wheaton MD for those of you who are local). They sell bottles of pureed ginger which makes this cake as easy as a cake out of a box. I also use a water boiler and dispens the water right out into a measuring cup with baking soda in it. I am in love with this cake! Also--to make this flavor more "asian"--try substituting the molasses with brown rice malt syrup--it's more dense and chewy but yields an interesting--and delicious--result.

My children went completely mad over this cake, they LOVED it! I have now made it twice. Freezing the ginger is a must as peeling is thereby a snap and by the time you are finished peeling, it is simple to just slice and dice. Do NOT grate the ginger, as I did for the first cake, as it ends up looking like it is packed with cat hair from the fibres. Yeck. (Please note my children did NOT complain!) Both cakes I drizzled with a simple lemon juice, lemon zest and confectioner's (powdered) sugar glaze. For the second cake, I added some additional chopped candied ginger, and used half molasses/half Golden Syrup (Karo would work) and I preferred the second result. Both cakes lasted a good week, tightly covered... but ONLY because they were hidden in a high cupboard!

I liked this spicy gingerbread cake, but be warned - it's not for people who prefer mild flavors. The ginger and pepper make it pretty powerful, so while it's not for everyone, the right audience will rave about it. The recipe works perfectly as cupcakes (it makes 24, bake for 20 minutes). I used canola oil for the fat, and cut it down by a few tablespoons. Drizzled them with a simple lemon glaze - delicious.

I made this cake for a small dinner party, and my guests raved about it. I kid you not, they said it was the most moist and delicious cake they had ever tasted. The ginger and pepper give it a very interesting, distinctive flavor. I found the flavors to be a little heavy and intense, but nevertheless a welcome change from more boring cakes I'm used to. I used 1/2 cup ginger, which grated up just fine when I used the zester.

I've made this delicious cake many times. I mince the ginger by hand - a pain in the butt, but worth it - and use the full 4 oz. I sub safflower or sunflower oil for the peanut and use Guinness Stout in place of the water. Serve it with whipped cream, sometimes with fresh raspberries as a garnish. Fabo

DELICIOUS! I made 24 gorgeous little cupcakes out of this recipe!! Baked for 20mins at 350 - perfect. I wasn't sure if the 4oz. ginger was supposed to be before or after peeling so I erred on the high side and used a full 4 oz. after peeling. The flavor is excellent but they are quite rich - might try cutting down the oil next time as they are quite oily. Made lemon glaze as recommended by a few - it pairs great with the spicy flavors.

Fantastic recipe! The texture is surprisingly soft and light. I minced the ginger in the food processor then added the rest and it was so easy, too. I will definitely make this again. (I used the following for addition to the processor: ginger- mince, then molasses, sugar, oil, eggs, cinnamon, clove, pepper- mix, then flour + 1/2 c water/soda- mix, then rest of water/soda)

We had orange-honey glazed chicken with mashed sweet potatoes for dinner. This was a wonderful dessert for such a sweet-flavored dinner. I prepared the ginger by using a cheese grater (the kind for parmesan cheese). It was much simpler and I did not have a lot of fiber. I served the cake with a powder sugar topping and everyone loved it! This is definately a make again cake.

NOW I've made it, and it was a true delight. I had young ginger, very new and soft, but grating it on the small hole side of a four-sided grater still left a lot of fiber. Next time I'll try mincing half (to see what biting down on a small chunk of ginger would be like--sounds great). To compare this to Park Chow's version. Theirs was cooked in a square pan and served as a square chunk. Next time I will measure and see if a 9" square pan is the same as a 9+" springform pan. I made the caramel sauce that is part of the recipe for Flourless Chocolate Cake with Caramel Sauce on the Epicurious website. (Also a winner.) Served it hot on top of cake slices, with Dreyer's vanilla bean ice cream. I couldn't find pumpkin ice cream, and decided whipped cream would be overkill. Oh this is delicious!

I made this cake at the absolute last minute as guests were heading out the door. After the smelled the ginger, they stayed until it was done and then left with the hot cake. A day later, I heard it hadn't made it beyond the car ride. This was by far the best ginger cake i have ever had. AMAZING!

In my country, it is not common to use ginger for pastries, but this is lovely! (We use ginger for everyday dishes though.) As suggested, I used the frozen ginger, which was a new idea for me. Thanks. Another merit of freezing ginger is that you can keep fresh ginger as long as a few months in your freezer.

What a great cake, fast and easy, wonderful flavors. The pepper was fine. I chopped the ginger, and liked the larger pieces. No need to bother grating the ginger so far as I can see. I didn't serve it with a glaze, etc., but could see that a flavored whipped cream on the side would be lovely. I will be keeping this as a staple for potlucks!

A lovely cake. I used only 3/4 C of oil (vegetable, I think) and only 3/4 C of molasses (that was all that was left in the bottle). I did increase the cinnamon and cloves, along with adding a dash of all spice. I made a lemon glaze for it, which compliments the ginger. By the way, grated the ginger with my microplaner. Try this cake, you won't be disappointed.

I have loved this cake for years, and so has everyone I've made it for. To the people who had trouble with peanut oil--maybe you used roasted or toastd peanut oil? It has a strong peanut taste, while regular plain peanut oil should be neutral tasting. Anyway, you can use any kind of light clear oil. The cake is great. Maybe the people who didn't like it don't like ginger? It has a strong clear fresh ginger taste, not a spicy-cinnamony gingerbread flavor...

This recipe has taken on a life of its own. I made for a gathering a couple of years ago when it first appeared in the NY Times. Everyone asked for the recipe and since then I have heard time and time again about how much people love it. So. I decided to make it again last week. Same reaction from my guests.

I've been testing all sorts of ginger cake recipes in hopes of finding one that tastes like a dessert at a local restaurant that I absolutely love. This one is the closet yet in flavour - delicious. I found the texture overall a bit oily but the crusty outsides were perfect. Next time I'd cut back on the oil just a bit to try for a drier cake. Excellent with Breyer's Natural Vanilla ice cream.

I love this cake!! I have made it twice in one week. I used my food processor for the ginger and it comes out perfect everytime. I bake this cake for 65 minutes and that seems to be perfect. Longer and the edges get kind of hard, shorter and the cake crumbles. I strongly recommend a lemon glaze made of 1 1/3 cups powdered sugar whisked together with 5 tablespoons lemon juice to be brushed on when the cake has cooled a bit. Served with a bit of vanilla ice cream and it is a great end to any meal.

Grating the ginger was a real pain in the upper arm - after buying a piece of ginger that weighed almost 8 oz, I stopped grating after what seemed an eternity and only had 2 oz of grated ginger (and a stringy mess left behind). Anyway, the cake turned out wonderfully spicy anyway. I made the mistake of using a bundt pan and no parchment paper, so my guests scooped the cake out in spoons. And I agree that lots of whipped cream would have been the best accompaniment, but we had none and will have to try it next time. To the reviewer below - 2 eggs are listed at the end of the ingredients.

Outstanding cake. . . thanks, David, for sharing your delicious recipte! Our guests raved about the wonderful flavor and the delightful crispness on the top vs. the moistness of the interior. I used half grated and half finely chopped ginger. My opinion is that finely chopping the fresh ginger is beneficial to the texture of the cake. We also used peanut oil purchased today (we all know the critical importance of using fresh ingredients, a Julia Child cooking must, no?), Brer Rabbit mild molasses, and medium grind black pepper. As other reviewers have experienced, our guests requested a copy of the recipe. (We included copies of recent Epicurious' reviews as the cooks' comments regarding the use of parchment paper, etc., are invaluable). Thanks, to "A Cook from Berkeley" for the presentation suggestion to use grand marnier creme--it was a terrific idea--and to "A Cook from Montreal on 4/19/01" for the very useful tip on how to determine if ginger root is fresh (feels heavy for its size vs. very light & dry and has a smooth, almost shiny feel).

My daughter has a new tradition at her home on Thanksgiving. The women brought their favorite desserts and the men voted for their favorites. They voted using a numeric system of 1-5; 1 being the worst and 5 the best. There was a holiday prize given to the winner. The ginger cake scored high with the older/wiser :D generation. But they were outnumbered. This was the first time I made this ginger cake and I will make it again.

Absolutely fabulous!!!! I have made this recipe about 6 times and it comes out perfect! It travels well, serves up beautifully, and works well with any fare.

Someone in a prior review stated using a bundt cake pan didn't work from them. I used a bundt cake pan, just one from Longs Drug store, and I lined it with parchment paper. The cake came out of the pan fine (it was too easy), and I removed the parchment paper. Turned out great!

I've made this twice now. I took it to a potluck last night and it was definitely a winner. My son loves the ginger cake served at Park Chow in SF. They use a dark chocolate glaze and serve it on a bed of warm caramel sauce. Not being able to do that easily for the potluck, I drizzled the top with the warm sauce. I used a larger springform pan (10 inches?) and baked it just 50 minutes. Today I added a smidge more fresh ginger. I think one of the secrets to this cake is the tiny bits of fresh ginger, so I would not recommend grating it. Biting into the cooked ginger is a plus. It's very dark and moist. Many people mistook it initially for a chocolate cake. It's definitely better than gingerbread. And definitely a keeper in the "winner" file.

I have taken several classes with David, and this cake was featured during the first one. It was paired with pears poached in white wine mixed with water, lemon peel, a little more fresh ginger, cloves and cinnnamon stick, with either creme fraiche or whipped cream garnish. It has become one of my favorite and signature desserts. I have always used a 9 x 3 pan, regular vegetable oil, grandma's brand molasses, and the ground pepper with outstanding results. The only difference in the original class recipe was that the eggs were mixed into the molasses/sugar/oil mix, then add the dry ingredients, followed by the boiling water/baking soda and ginger. This really is a no fail winner!

This cake is addictive. Extremely moist without being too heavy; spicy, but not sharp or harsh (nobody guessed the black pepper). I did make a big mistake baking it in a bundt pan - it stuck like mad and came out in chunks. I used cannola oil instead of peanut so I can't say what that might add or detract. A microplane grater made quick work of the ginger and the whole thing was mixed and in the oven in about 20 minutes.

My cake came out perfectly fine (I am a very experienced baker and have taken several baking classes) - light and moist, however this has to be the most awful tasting cake I have ever made in my entire life - and no, I did not make a mistake with the ingredients. I am disappointed that I read such good reviews about it and then wasted so much of my time on a product that is truly horrible. And despite what the Epicurious reviewer says, you can definitely taste the pepper in the cake - AWFUL!!! I give this recipe no forks at all. I would never make it again - it's just so incredibly bad.

This was very good. Mincing 4oz of ginger was a pain (I tried grating it but it went into an awful stringy mush) but apart from that, it was a snap to make and turned out of the pan beautifully (I used a 9" springform cause that was what I had.) It needed a full hour to cook & even then I was a bit apprehensive about the centre - it looked from the outside as if it might be a bit soggy still. However, I took it out of the oven anyway & it turned out to be perfect. I thought it was better while still slightly warm, with a big slick of brandied, whipped cream (from a carrot cake recipe on this website) but my husband preferred it cold. Definitely one for the 'keeper' file. The taste of the fresh ginger is subtle but really delicious. Make sure you buy a large piece of root ginger - lots of waste when you trim and peel - and also make sure that the piece you select feels heavy for its size & has a smooth, almost shiny feel. A lot of fresh ginger-root has been sitting around in shops for a while & has dried out - feels very light & dry when you handle it.

I really wanted to like this recipe and was very disappointed that it wasn't what I thought it would be. I thought the cake was going to have an incredible ginger flavor. What I found was that the peanut oil (the oil recommended by the author) overpowered the fresh ginger and therefore gave the cake a very, very mild ginger flavor. The cake was not that spicy either. If you are looking for a "fresh ginger" version of gingerbread - this is not your recipe. The best gingerbread recipe on this site is still "Grammercy Tavern Gingerbread".

Simply perfect. Nothing fancy, just GOOD. Every single person at the table had seconds! An unexpected surprise was that some of the sugar seems to rise to the top during baking to form the slightest crunch on top. It's incredibly quick and easy, too.
