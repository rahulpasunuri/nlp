This was good. Not quite the same as that made by my German host-mother, but good nonetheless. I admit, I peeled the cucumbers because I'm picky like that. I am terrible at thin-slicing and I don't have one of those mandoline slicers, I used my vegetable peeler to make the thin slices. It took forever to do, but worked great! Delicious recipe. A little on the sweet side. Next time I'll add less sugar.

A perfect bbq side dish - light and refreshing! I used red onion instead of chives but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Yes, it's a wonderful and easy recipe for cucumber lovers; almost like my (german) mother used to make it.

Excellent. I wanted to eat the entire bowl in one sitting. I substituted yogurt for the sour cream and drained the cucumbers first. Timeless recipe.

A classic and a great way to use the bounty of cucumbers from the garden. I Increased the amount of chives and dill and skipped the celery seed. Added some freshly ground black pepper.

Easy! What a way to use up a bunch of cucumbers fresh out of the garden. Very refreshing on a hot day. Goes with anything in the summer& Needs to chill a little before serving. Great recipe.

i have been thinking about trying to recreate this recipie from my childhood for years. I have spoken with numerous people. I am delighted with this. I would add a little more vinegar and a little less sugar, but I am still playing with it. I am very happy, particularly since this is the first time I have eaten this in about 35 years!!

Delicious! I made it with half plain yogurt and half low fat sour cream and it was still creamy and wonderfully refreshing

Loved it, even tho I left out celery seed (I don't like) and the dill (hubby doesn't like) and used a chopped scallion and a dash of dried chives. Next time the dill goes in. This is The recipe for sour cream cucumbers.

I'd been craving cucumbers and sour cream "like mom's", and the 1956 date on this made me think that this must be it! I would use a "scanter" tablespoon of sugar next time, had no celery seed so faked it with celery salt. Two friends over for an impromptu dinner both asked for the recipe - that's enough endorsement of success for me!

Simple quick even my 8 year old liked it.

This is such and simple recipe but absolutely perfect. My garden is full of dill and I never realized one could use the flowery part as well as the fronds. The flavor was much stronger. Everyone at the dinner table raved about this dish.

Maybe because I only had balsamic vinegar and not cider vinegar, this dish was a bit too sour.

I've eaten this my whole life and never knew how to make it. Tried the recipe for my Labor Day BBQ and it was great. I pulled almost all the ingredients from my garden so I'll be making this often.

This recipe was delicious! I was impressed by how much better the dressing tasted after the salad sat for an hour-- the cucumber juices really added to the flavor (but unfortunately thinned the dressing out quite a bit). We took the advice of one reviewer and added more than the recommended amout of sugar; the sweet-tangy contrast was very refreshing. We don't like dill very much, so we substituted mint, which seemed to work very well. We also left out the celery seed, not having any on hand, but we didn't miss it. Certainly a recipe we'll be making again this summer!

Very cool, quite refreshing. I found that the recipe called for considerably too much sour cream though. It was almost like tzatziki. Cut by a third. And a couple squirts of lemon juice don't hurt either.

Excellent combination of flavors. If like cucumbers this recipe is great.

This recipe is very similar to one my mother used to make when I was growing up. It is one of my favorites. It goes well with anything grilled such as barbequed chicken. I made it for my boyfriend and he absolutely loved it. If you like cucumbers this recipe is one of the best!

This was delicious!!! I had a recipe from a friend that was similar, but this was better. I used the onion instead of the chives and also I think next time, since I'm not that fond of dill and celery seed, I'll only use half the amount for these ingredients.

This is a very common salad in Germany. I've made it for years and serve it with just about anything. My only sugestion would be to double the amount of sugar. The sugar should really play off the vinegar for a sweet/sour flavor. The sweet just doesn't come through with the smaller amount given here (personal taste probably). As always, fresh dill is the best, but I have made this using dry dill weed when in a pinch. It still tastes great, just cut the amount in half. Also, try using a red Bermuda onion (sliced paper thin) instead of a normal onion. It tastes great and look pretty too.

Awesome! Reminds me of what my grandmother made! My husband, that doesn't like cucumbers, loves this dish. Wonderfully refreshing summer salad.

My mother had a similar recipe that was a favorite of mine as I was growing up. This one is better than her's and it gets better the next day. I added thin slices of onion, because Mom did. It's a five forker!
