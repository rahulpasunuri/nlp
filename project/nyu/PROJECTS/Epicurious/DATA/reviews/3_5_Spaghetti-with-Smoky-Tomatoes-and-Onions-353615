This is a great summer pasta! Since our family has some fresh zucchini and cork neck squash in our garden, I sliced up 1/2 inch thick slabs of each (cutting from stem to end or vertically) and grilled them with the tomatoes and onions.

Pretty darn good. I broiled the tomatoes and 1/2 the onion, then sauteed the rest of the onion with garlic and pancetta. I also added some steamed broccoli to the mixture. Broiling definitely works, but will definitely try again with the grilling method.

I stand corrected! My husband says charcoal grill, not broiler, necessary for smoky flavor, especially onions.

We grilled the tomatoes and onions over charcoal, but except for keeping the heat out of the kitchen, I'd agree that broiling would work just as well. To my taste, it needs a fair amount of basil, parmesan, salt & pepper, but I also added some sauteed proscuitto and that was a good idea.

I also used the broiler and the vegetables were delicious. I usually make recipes "as is" but I had some red and orange peppers, so I broiled those as well. Also, I tossed in some left over sausages from last night's dinner and a handful of fresh spinach leaves at the end. We thought it was very good!

With a gas grill I decided there was no benefit of grilling over roasting so I broiled the tomatoes, onion, and also roasted spinach and basil. Fresh ingredients are crucial as well as good quality parmesan. A perfect summer meal with a glass of wine!
