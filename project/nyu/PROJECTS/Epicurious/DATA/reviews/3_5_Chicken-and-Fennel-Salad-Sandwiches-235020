I used a rotisserie chicken for a 1/3 recipe of this, and it was really good. The fennel was a unique and much better flavor than celery. I would strongly recommend some greens on the sandwich to balance it out. I used baby arugula. I would say it was a tad dry/healthy, but that will of course vary with the size of the chickens. A very thin layer of mayo on the buns was all that was needed to fix the moisture issue.

It's a wonderful sandwich all in all. The only thing I'd change would be reducing the basil. I did just as well with 3/4 of a cup instead of a whole one. But I'd definitely serve this again.

I made this for a tea party and it was a smashing success. I made this along with a different chicken salad and this one 'won' - no contest.

Instead of making sandwiches out of this I served the chicken salad on a bed of lettuce for a light lunch. It was just delicious. I like fennel, but not fennel seed, so I omitted the seeds and it turned out just great. Will surely make this again!

Excellent. I used a couple of chicken breasts and fiddled with the quantities as I was just making it for myself. The recipe makes a nice salad on a bed of salad greens.

Everyone LOVED it! I made it with chunks of chicken breasts. I also used reduced fat mayo and yoghurt. No one could tell the difference. I did add follow advice from San Diego & added more lemon peel, salt & pepper.

I've made this several times and everyone loves it. Great for picnics.

I use a store roasted chicken and at times have added macaroni to the recipe and used it as a main course at lunch or supper.

I deconstructed this recipe a bit -- roasted a chicken on a bed of fennel and onion, and made sandwiches using slices of the breast meat, the dressing from this recipe, and the roasted fennel & onion from under the chicken. YUM.

I love fennel so I was surprised when I thought this was really bland. I tried adding more lemon, lemon peel, salt & more fennel and nothing seemed to work. Will try this again with grilled chicken I want to like it.

I have now made this twice with rave reviews both times. Flavor is exquisite. Easy to make. Just picked up a ready baked chicken on my way home from work and let it cool. For 1 diced chicken I halved the ingredients. Changes: used low-fat mayo, sauteed the fennel seeds in a bit of oil till brown (I added more fennel seeds since I LOVE the flavor), skipped the sandwich part and served as a chicken saled on a bed of mixed greens.

This was really fresh and delicious. The fennel has great crunch and its delicate flavour is perfect. Since I live by myself, I used half a chicken, one fennel bulb, and divided the dressing recipe by 3.

Made this for a Memorial Day picnic and it was a BIG hit.. Served it on crisped French Hamburger buns . I used roasted chickens from the deli that had a light lemon-pepper marinade , so the flavor was compatible
