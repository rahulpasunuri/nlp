Followed the recipe exactly. Expected more flavor but I think the lime juice overpowered everything. Won't be making this again.

I made, and reviewed this recipe several years ago. Remembering this awesome marinade, improvised yesterday. I marinated and grilled a turkey breast, and served it over green Boston lettuce with mango, cucumber, and green onions. I reserved the marinade and used it as salad dressing. It was REALLY great. Oh! And I didn't have Sherry, so I used Brandy. This recipe is just outstanding and is so versatile.

This is my all time favorite marinade for just about anything. I've used it for chicken, salmon, and pork. I don't bother with the kabobs, it's great on a dish topped off with more fresh cilantro. All my friends love it!

Great recipe. We made it a whole meal, no starch. I skewered the veggies, meat and fish separately so as not to over cook the fish or meat - perfect results.Because I made a recipe for 2 I kind of messed up on the sauce. I used all the marinade for the meat and fish - there wasn't much. I boiled the marinade (all of it which was too much) and then added the butter. The sauce was a little too runny and probably would have been more intense if I had used less marinade. Still good though.

What a disappointment. I tried the marinade on lamb only and the flavors completely overwhelmed the taste of the lamb. I can see how this would go well with fish or chicken but definitely not lamb!

Delicious and easy. Excellent sauce. I think the last step (heating the sauce with butter) is unnecessary and I actually preferred the dish without the addition of that extra buttered sauce at the end. This was also delicious cold the next day. I made it with the swordfish, but not the lamb. Did not have tomatoes; in addition to the green onions, I used regular onions, and I used nectarines instead of peaches, and added mango slices to the kebabs as well.

Followed recipe exactly (used chicken instead of lamb) for a 4th cookout - absolutely delicious. I would substitute sweet red onion for the green onions in the recipe, however, next time. Did not have enough marinade left over for sauce, but it was not necessary. Everyone loved this!

i have made this a number of times: once for a party of 20+ women with very discerning tastes. They LOVED it. and drizzling the extra sauce over a curry flavored couscous adds an extra something special.

Very good and fast. We used chicken and orange bell peppers and grilled over a wood fire and it came out great. I did not; however, make the sauce with the butter. Maybe next time.

I made this dish for a dinner party for eight. The marinade I made exactly as the recipe stated. I made both lamb and salmon skewers. The one thing I did differently was to make separate vegetable skewers & I replaced the roma tomatoes with whole strawberry tomatoes. I served a grilled romaine salad with roasted garlic dressing along with the dish. I received rave reviews & although it takes a while to get it all together, it is quite easy and so worth it. I will certainly make this again.

A party in your mouth and everyone's invited. Pre-grill marinade was almost untastably powerful. Post-grill impact devine. Used thresher shark and chicken, marinated for 3 hours for surprisingly tasty results. Semi-ripe peaches a-ok. Heirloom tomatoes good substitute for romas. This recipe is going straight to the file-of-fame.

Forgot to put in the mustard and used sake instead of sherry and the taste was still marvelous. My husband was so thrilled with this dish and asked me to make sure I kept the recipe.I also utilized white fish instead of swordfish. Very good. The lamb was excellent.

Oh My Gosh! This was unbelievable! I used halibut, peaches, pinapple and green onions. For a dinner party for 14, I also prepared lamb, beef and chicken with a variety of marinades, and this was by far the unanimous favorite. Bravo to the person who created this recipe. It was amazing!

My boyfriend made this for me a few months back and I have served it twice since. It is a bit labor intensive, but so worth it! I echo the substitutions of others. We have tried different meaty fish varieties as well as chicken and it came out delicious every time.

My sixteen year old daughter has made this recipe on three different occassions. Every time she has been highly complemented. She has claimed this recipe as her special dish. We use chicken for the kebabs and is it ever tender. we usually serve it with rice so we can enjoy the marinade, last time I served it with cous cous with sauteed carrots and snap peas which I modified from another recipe. It was great!

I have already made the swordfish kebabs on 3 occasions. This winter I substituted the peaches for mango - yum!

This recipe was wonderful! I made it for my family a while back and got rave reviews. It is a little tedious, but definitely worth it. I used filet steak, chicken and shrimp and it was great.

THis was truly delicious, the sauce at the end is what makes the dish. I made it will chicken instead of lamb and sea bass instead of swordfish. I didn't like the swordfish at all. Make sure to leave enough sauce to pour over when serving, that gives it the excellent taste and lots of compliments!

Used Mahi Mahi instead of swordfish and cooked on an indoor grill pan. The marinade seemed overpowdering, there was really no point in using it as a sauce on the side. Although I loved the taste of grilled peaches, not reall impressed with this dish.

I just made the marinade b/c I was looking for an interesting marinade for mahi mahi. It is my husbands favorite fish and while he is not very adventurous when trying new dishes, he really loved the mahi in this marinade.

Very tasty and well received dish. Substituted pineapple for the peaches. Marinade is really good on shrimp as well. Pretty salty, so next time I will halve the soy sauce.

Best kabobs I've ever had!! I made chicken and halibut and marinated for 4 hours. The chicken kabobs had red bell peppers and yellow squash. And I made the halibut with tomatoes, peaches and green onions. This was SO delicious, and dinner guests and family gave huge reviews. I will definitely make this again. It was very easy to make and cooking time was so quick. Oh, I only used 3 Tbsp of honey, but it was citrus honey, and I just threw in a handful of cilantro and a little extra red pepper flakes. PERFECT...Yummmmm!!

I thought it was very good. Not everyone liked the heavy cilantro taste. The only alteration I made the next time was to change lime juice and cilantro to lemon juice, basil and rosemary. I like this variation a little better. I doubled the recipe and used the excess to flavor a cream sauce for pasta that was excellent.

This is the best fish dish I have ever made. I will definitely serve this to dinner guests in the future.

Big hit with my family tonight. I didn't make the glaze, and used beef instead of lamb, as well as chicken and swordfish. The swordfish was especially delicious in this marinade. Will make it solo in the future. Very tasty. Next time I'll make the glaze and baste kebabs with it, the veggies were a bit dry tonight. Also, didn't use the green onions, used red onions instead, as well as yellow squash and several different kinds of peppers. Will make again.
