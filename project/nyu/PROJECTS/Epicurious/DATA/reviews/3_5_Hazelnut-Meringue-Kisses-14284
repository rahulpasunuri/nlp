I have been making these for years, using a similar recipe based on that used by my baker father in his bakery, 1935-1965. Here are a few more hints. You do not need cream of tartar. It just sets your teeth on edge. Buy a bottle of copper supplement capsules at the health food store and use an appropriate part of a capsule as you beat the eggs. This idea is courtesy of Harold McGee, On Food and Cooking. Copper makes the egg white foam more stable. Make sure the whites are at room temperature. Warm the baker's sugar in the 225° oven until it is 'blood warm,' then transfer it to one of the pieces of parchment you will be baking on. That makes controlling its flow into the whipped whites simple. Eggology whites work fine for this recipe and save you the accumulated yolks. We just baked a batch from 24 oz of ground hazelnuts and 10-3/4 oz of whites. You can get far more uniform nut meal if you grind the nuts in the simplest smallest Zyliss cheese grater. I like using a #8 Ateco star tip. Hold the tip very close to the parchment, make a star, then pull up sharply. We put a toasted hazelnut on top. Half is flavored chocolate by folding in melted dark chocolate to the nut meringue. It makes the meringue a bit stiffer. I've been using Guittard L Etoile Du Premiere 58% for several years. With care it can be melted in a microwave. Just don't get it too hot and ruin the temper. This same recipe is remarkably good made with toasted pine nuts. Here we arrange 5 in a star pattern on top. The oil content of the nuts is greater and the meringue does not easily hold a star shape.

The finished Meringue was delicious. Light and crispy, yet soft on the inside. I have made Meringue a few times and quite often they just don't peak, but this worked out great. I think one of the secrets to making a good Meringue is to work with egg whites that are room temperature and not right from the fridg.

These meringues were delicious. I dipped half the batch in white chocolate, for some variation. I also used a star tip instead of a plain tip, to produce a more attractive meringue--I found they did hold their shape well in the oven, despite what the recipe says.

I don't know what the previous reviewer did wrong...these are wonderful. Maybe they were inexperienced with a pastry bag. It takes the right touch. Here's a trick, puree some beans and add to the eggs. The coagulation is what gives the eggs their stiffness. Try this, it works.

Making these meringues was a nightmare! Clogged pastry bags, flat meringue...It took me three tries to get it right. Yes, they tasted fine, but not good enough for me to go through the stress of making them, again. Honestly, I think making these took a year off the end of my life.

I knew this recipe would be good when I read it, but I was still unprepared for how good! They're almost as good as Ferraro-Rocher chocolates, except way cheaper and they must also be way better for you.
