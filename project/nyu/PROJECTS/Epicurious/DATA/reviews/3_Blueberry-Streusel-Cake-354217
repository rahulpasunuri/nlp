A hit with dinner company, who have some expertise with blueberry desserts. Very berry-rich -- I'd call this baked blueberries held together by cake, rather than cake with blueberries. If that's what you like, this is a good recipe! Leftovers were the perfect breakfast, but there was very little left over.

My, my, my ... Whomever made the streusel this way, had to have known it was wrong from the get go! Streusel is made from flour And sugar, Not flour and a touch of sugar, wouldn't that be a cake? This is how Streusel is made! 3/4 cup flour 3/4 cup sugar 1 and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 cup butter You may also add a pinch of salt Also some cooks add crushed nuts, cinnamon And nutmeg, or variuos spices. If you want brown sugar, cut it to 1/2 cup not 3/4. Hope this helps Everyone :)

I found the streusel topping to be very dry. Also, when I weighed out 1/2 pound of blueberries, it was 1-1/2 cups, not 3-1/4.

What a waste of blueberries! I weighed 2 c. of blueberries and they weighed 3/4 lb. So that's what I used (between 3 1/2 c. and 1/2 lb). But the real problem was the streusel. Way too much flour. It was powdery and not like a streusel topping at all. Mine does not look like the picture at all, either. I will not make this recipe again. I have much better uses for blueberries than this recipe. Don't waste them on this one!

This recipe was so good! My Dad loves coffee cake, so i tried it. I am new at baking and found it to be pretty easy! Everyone loved it :)

I thought this was delicious! And so did the family. It's a great dish for the fresh blueberries that are in season now. I too needed to change the recipe for the topping by adding butter and more brown sugar.

I have a better recipe: Topping: 1/3 c.sifted flour,1/2c.sugar, 1t. cinnamon, 1/2 stick butter. Cake: 2c.sifted flour,2t.baking powder, 1/2t.salt,2oz.butter,1t.vanilla,1 egg, 1/4c.sugar,1/2c.milk,grated rind of 1 lemon,1/2c.chopped walnuts. I bake this in a 9" springform pan at 375º.

I'm giving this 3 forks based on the recipe as written, but with a few changes, I think it's a 4-forker. The picture and past reviews confirm that there's way too much streusel topping. I cut the flour in the streusel to 1/2 cup, put in 2 Tbsp. each of granulated and brown sugar, kept the butter and cinnamon the same amount, and added slivered almonds. Cutting the flour rather than adding 2xs the amount of butter gives both a moister streusel and a better balance between cake and streusel. This way, you can also add all the streusel at once and forget about adding 1/2 of it half way through the baking. 50 minutes was perfect. The slivered almonds add a very nice crunch. I would have added lemon zest if I had one on hand. But even without, it was delicious. It's a keeper for those summertime blueberries.

I made this last night and the results were fantastic. I used more blueberries than it called for. When I make it again tomorrow, I will use more butter in the topping...it was too dry. I'm at altitude and didn't find I needed to bake it any longer than recommended (if anything, I went a few minutes less) and it was prefect. Definitely give this a chance...not sure how others struggled with it so much...it was the best fresh fruit cake I've ever made.

I was looking for something to make with my 3 pound box of blueberries from Costco and found this recipe in Gourmet. I was disappointed to read the ratings in Epicurious, but decided to try it any way, with a few modifications. First, I skipped all the foil lining business and made it in a 10 inch spring form pan that I buttered and floured. It worked great. Next, as suggested by one of the reviewers I doubled the butter in the streusel to one stick and added some lemon zest to the blueberries. I also threw in two handfuls of oatmeal to the streusel. I also skipped the step that has you put half the streusel on the cake, bake and then add more and continue to bake. I threw it all on and baked one time. I cooked an additional 10 minutes. What you get is a densely blueberry flavored coffee cake. I served it for dessert, but actually enjoyed it more in the morning with my coffee as the original recipe suggests Next time I might add just a bit of lemon juice to the cake batter for a little punch and perhaps some sliced almonds to the streusel. If you like blueberries, you will enjoy this recipe.

I was curious to see what others had written about this one. This was the most frustrating recipe I've made in a long time. I made it twice, once for family in Chicago and once at home, and both times my results were truly awful (it was eaten, and heavy doses of vanilla ice cream helped) The first time I did exactly what the recipe said, and I thought there were too many berries, and the crumble topping was bland and powdery. I always use really good, organic ingredients... I wondered if there wasn't enough butter in the topping, making it dry; I prefer to make crumbles, with oats and perhaps nuts in the topping. The second time I used fewer berries, and forgot to add them until after the batter was in the pan, mixing this recipe up with the raspberry cake in an earlier Gourmet issue(which was fabulous). I mooshed the berries into the batter, which worked just fine, the cake rising to cover the berries, and leaving a bit more cake around the edges, which I liked. Both times, the cake took forever to bake, using two different ovens in two different states, both taking about half an hour longer than the recipe said, both ovens with separate thermometers. The foil lining seemed like a good idea, but was kind of a pain to do, although probably easier than cleaning baked-on berry from the pan. The result wasn't worth the effort.

rather bland, and left over cake was mushy. could have used a bit more salt, and perhaps some lemon zest. Wouldn't make this one again.

I have a delicious blueberry sour cream coffee cake recipe from Ina Garten, and this beat that, hands down. I do think is by far more of a breakfast/coffee cake type dish than something for dessert. For this, I added more brown sugar to the streusel topping--seriously, 2 1/2 Tbsp. sugar in a streusel topping? Also I agree with the reviewer below who suggested adding more butter to the topping to hold it together, as it did fall apart. In all, it was fantastic, and I'm on my way to grab a square right now to have with my coffee!

Fabulous coffee cake moist and lush with Blueberries. Yum! Didn't care too much for the Streusel. Will make my regular Streusel recipe next time to top it off. Also used less sugar, as I tend to do with most sweets recipes and used extra vanilla. Definitely a keeper!

Excellent crumb cake when you want to WOW your guests with something different! Easy to make,came out perfect. Would recommend to all.

The flavor was nice but there was a disproportionate amount of streusel to cake. I would have preferred something more substantial with a bit more of a rise. The streusel was also pretty traditional but not as sweet as in most recipes. My guests enjoyed it though, and went back for seconds.

These are very similar to the blueberry coffee cake at starbucks (the low-fat version) in taste and texture. They're incredibly moist and have a good amount of blueberry...I was a little worried from the picture, which makes it look like essentially a block of streusel. My advice, however, for those who make this: double the butter in the ingredients for the topping (use a whole stick). As is, the crumble stuff didn't hold together, had the texture of sand, and all fell off when you move the bars. If you do this, they should be quite delicious. Also, I added lemon zest to the cake, because I always put lemon with blueberry stuff.
