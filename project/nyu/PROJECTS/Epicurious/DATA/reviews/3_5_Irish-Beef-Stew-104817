I love this recipe. The stew was delicious. I followed some other recommendations to reduce the amount of stock and replace it with beer and wine. I did about a cup each and it was yummy. Not too soupy either if you cook it on a fast simmer. Will definitely make this again.

Absolutely fabulous recipe. The beef becomes extremely tender, no matter what cut you use. Delicious and special enough to serve company.

This was a delicious hit at our home with both my husband and my five year old. I used the repeated suggestion of adding stout and wine. So I used 4 cups beef stock, 1 cup wine and 1 cup stout. I added some beef stock to the veggie mixture halfway through the sauteeing. I had no problem with the thickness - if you have the beef cooking at the low-medium level then enough liquid boils off leaving a rich thick broth. I also used butter to brown the beef. Absolutely delicious!

I make this all the time and do substitute some of the beef broth with red wine. I also substitute some of the white potatoes with sweet potato. This also helps thicken the broth. So good! I pair this with the Buttermilk Biscuits from Epicurious.

Delicious! Followed suggestions and reduced potatoes to 2 lb yukon gold, reduced liquid to 3 cups broth plus 1/2 cup red wine and 1/2 cup Guinness. Used boneless chuck roast and coated with flour prior to cooking. Paired with egg noodles and even picky kids ate it up!

I have been making this stew since published. I think it is delicious. Really people, it doesn't take an experienced cook to figure out when something needs salt and pepper. This recipe also thickens when made the day before and refrigerated overnight. If you want a thicker stew, add a flour slurry (water and flour mixed together).

Made this as an alternative to the usual Corned Beef for an early St. Patrick's Day dinner. Used baby Yukon Gold potatoes (do try this!) instead of russet and subbed chicken stock for half of the beef stock. Flavor was good, if too sweet for my taste. Also used flour to thicken the liquid, otherwise it was more like beef soup than beef stew. It was everyday fare kind of good but not special occasion kind of good.

The recipe doesn't mention salt! Other reviews say it is bland. Mine was bland until I salted it too. I added salt to taste after I added the veggies before I simmered for 40 minutes.

Good recipe but not great. It lacks depth of flavour. I added a bottle of lager as suggested and a good splash of red wine. I also added some chopped celeriac with the potatoes and carrots. As others have mentioned, you don't need 8 c of broth and cut down on the potatoes. I used corn starch to thicken and it definitely needs s&p. Overall not bad but next time I'll try the Gourmet 08 recipe on this site.

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic recipe! It does take a lot of cutting but if you have a mandolin it helps a lot to get the evenly cut pieces. This didn't take too long to prepare, the longest part was the actual simmering for an hour. My one tip would be to pull out your two largest pots. I started with a deep large skillet and my usual stock pot and had to upgrade to the stock pot for the veggie saute and the pot I normally reserve for lobster or large batches of pasta for the actual soup.

Wasn't a bad stew, but it did come out a little thin for my tastes. I might try it again with (as others have suggested) a little beer or red wine in place of some broth and a small amount of flour to thicken the sauce a little bit more.

Too sweet, too much liquid. Underwhelming. It was palatable but not delicious.

Rating: 2
I did not have any beer or ale on hand, so I used 4 cups beef broth and one cup red wine. I did not initially add the sugar as the recipe instructs, because we generally don't like sugar in savory meals. But I found the end result WAY too acidic, so I added 2 teaspoons sugar (out of the original 1 Tbsp requested), and then it had an unpleasant "sweet and sour sauce" taste to it. I'm not sure what the problem was--perhaps too much wine, perhaps our wine or tomato paste was too acidic, but this was really only palatable and not delicious. I likely won't make it again, and if I do I will try the ale/beer for part of the liquid and no wine.

I think this is the best stew I've made. I love browning the veg. in butter before adding to the stew. Everyone who ate it loved it.

With the exception of an additional splash of Worcestershire, I made this to the tee, and that's with all 8 cups of beef stock. I don't see what the big fuss is with all of the prior reviews about the quantity of liquid -- so long as you have the stew on a pretty rapid simmer for the 40 minutes, it works out right. Oh and I subbed in 1c of red wine for the same amount of stock -- that's a must.

Rating: 4
Very tasty. Used about 5 cups of liquid, including a cup of strong dark beer & most of a can of stewed tomatoes. Didn't have the bay leaves, but turned out very tasty anyway once we let it boil down to stew-texture.

This is a great stew. Made it last night and followed the suggestions of many. Reduced to 4 cups total liquid (1/2 cup red wine), doubled the garlic (half in the veggies, half with the mean) and added some cornstarch at the end. Fantastic. I even cooked it a bit fast than the recipe stated as I had a "starving" 12 year old boy on my hands!

Rating: 0
Wow! This is a really delicious and hearty stew once you make some of the adjustments suggested by many members here. It's really a matter of preference/taste as to whether you add more flavor, but definitely reduce the total amount of liquid in the original recipe. I didn't have enough russet potatoes and added a sweet potato as well as some celery. I did add the Guinness and red wine as others suggested and the result was a really flavorful and delicious meal. This will be a standard in my household for cold winter nights!

This stew was great for a winter night. i made it pretty much as written, except I followed the recommendations and decreased the amount of broth to 4 cups and added 1 cup of wine. I marinated my beef in the wine for about 30 minutes first and then dredged it in flour. I also cooked my stew in the oven since I think the meat comes out more tender. 300*F for 2 hours and it was perfect. I added a little extra flour at the end to thicken it a bit more. Really good stew, I would definitely make it again.

I have a question about this recipe. Do you cook the meat, broth, etc. for one hour and then add the vegetables for a total of 1 hour 40 minutes of cooking. Or do you add the vegetables after cooking the meat and broth for 20 minutes, for a total of 1 hour of cooking? Thanks for your help!

This was delicious. As recommended by others, dredged the beef in flour first, added extra worsteshire, garlic, and used stout and red wine in place of half of the beef broth. Did the dash of balsamic on the rosted vegetables, too. Would cut down the potatoes next time. Very tender beef, great flavor. A keeper!

I generally enjoyed this stew, but made a number of changes. I guestimated the potatoes (just used what I had) down to about 2 lbs. That was the perfect amount with kathleenohealy's advice to use 4 cups of broth, 1/2 cup of stout, and 1/2 a cup of red cooking wine, but clearly 3 lbs. with the original 8 cups of broth would be right as well. I still found that the stew was lacking some acidity, so 10 minutes before it was done, I added an extra tablespoon of tomato paste and maybe another 1/4 cup of wine. Also missing from this recipe: SALT and PEPPER! Like Colicchio says, you got to season your food.

Rating: 4
Have made this stew a number of times and is always a hit. The basic recipe is solid. I discovered, as did other chefs, that dredging the beef in flour, less fluid and replacing part of the liquid with a dark beer definitely improve the end result. Double the garlic. Turnips are a nice addition too. Be certain to allow the roots to sweat before adding to liquid.

Made this last night and was delicious. I made as instructed except the liquid: I used 4 cups of beef broth and 1/2 cup of stout beer and 1/2 cup of red wine for a total of 5 cups of liquid, it was great! Oh, and I also doubled the Worcestershire sauce as someone else had recommended as well. Turned out great, it will be a staple in our house.

This was great and easy. We added more meat thanks to the recommendations of other reviewers, substituted some of the broth with beer, added a little cornstarch for thickening and basically doubled the garlic. It was delicious and very much the type of comfort food you look forward to. Will definitely make again!

I've made this recipe dozens of times now - it's a real favorite in our family. I've made it exactly as-is, and I've changed it around a bit too. I like it just fine as written, but if anyone's looking for a little variation you can throw in a sprig of rosemary (remove before serving) and use lamb and lamb broth or boullion - it's spectacular.

After I made this for us for dinner tonight, and we had enough left-over for at least one more night, my fiance said the only suggestion he had to improve this stew was that I should double this recipe next time so we have more leftovers! So it gets 4 forks from me! I basically followed the recipe but took the suggestions of the many other reviewers who suggested a bit less liquid (I used 6 cups total - 1 c of that was stout beer). I also threw everything in the crock pot (first I browned the meat and put it in the crock pot with the liquids, then I browned the vegetables in the same dutch oven I used to brown the meat, and added those to the meat in the crock pot), and cooked it for several hours. After about 4 hours in the crock pot (2 hrs on high, 2 hrs on low), the stew was very thick the way we like it, and the meat was fall apart tender. This was good and simple (not bland) and we thought it was delicious with some french bread. This is our favorite beef stew recipe now :)

Rating: 3
This is a great base, but is much improved by a few modifications, as suggested by other reviewers. I sprinkle a couple generous tablespoons of flour over the beef towards the end of the browning process, then deglaze the pot with a good splash of red wine and reduce the liquid to 5 cups, while replacing 2 of the cups of stock with a can of Guinness or other stout. I also add a few handfuls of frozen baby peas at the end. Great, warming meal for a cold winter's night!

Reading the other reviews i was prepared to have runny stew. i thickened it by using extra tomato paste, coating the meat in flour and cornstarch, and using only 6 cups broth. i added some red wine which enhanced the flavor, and extra dash of worcestershire, and only four cloves of garlic. i also added more meat since the potato to meat ratio seems a little high. The recipe is a good base to start with, but without tweaking it would have been very watery. Everyone loved it and it's now a requested meal - i've made it twice since then. This dish is even better the following day. Definitely take the time to brown the veg! The second time around, to make the meat extra tender, i browned the meat and let simmer in the broth for an hour, cool and refigrated overnight. the following day i put it back on the stove and finished it off with more simmering and then added the vegetables and continued to cook as normal.

Rating: 4
thanks to all the other reviewers for their suggestions, this stew wouldn't be as good with out them. I've made this a few times, and here's what works for me: - definitely replace 1c. of broth with Guinness (I prefer over red wine for this) - Reduce total liquid to 5 cups (vs. the 8 called for) - Dredge the meat in flour before browning, but I find it may still need extra flour to thicken - don't skimp on browning the veggies, especially the carrots -the more garlic, the better - use 2 pounds of potatoes. ps this makes a HUGE pot. Some of the reviewers felt there was not enough meat, but I used the amount called for and thought it was plentiful, and sometimes I use even less.

Rating: 4
A rich and mouth-watering stew with wonderful textures. The Worcestershire sauce (however small the quantity may seem) is, I think, the key ingredient to the special flavour, so don't be tempted to leave it out or substitute. The perfect hearty and heart-warming meal on a cold and snowy winter evening!

One of our favorites and always a hit. Easy to make and the ingredients are basic. I double the garlic. Also you may wish to thicken with a corn starch & water mix. Make a double batch as its better as a left over.

I thoroughly enjoyed making this recipe for my family. I followed as closely as I could and found I had everything in the pantry or frig except for the fresh parsley. Oh well, I'm not particularly fond of the green stuff anyway. Great depth of flavor developed during the long cooking time, especially when I added salt and pepper. The meat was tender, the potatoes, carrots and onions just right. Thanks for a great introduction to a wonderful beef stew. As for those of you who are wondering what makes it an Irish Stew, the meat and potatoes, man...the meat and potatoes.

My family loves beef stew, so obviously this was a winner. I did make a few changes: dredged the beef in flour before browning, substituted beer for about 1/4 of the beef stock, added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the veggies and stirred in some baby peas at the very end. I think the Worcestershire sauce is key. I may even increase it a bit next time.

really very good--worth the time to cook carrots etc separate. I add sugar prior to broth to "carmelize" a bit w/meat. I also use much less beef broth and sub in 1/2 cup ale or stout.

I made this yesterday for the first time. After reading over the other reviews, I was prepared to make adjustments. The only adjustment I made was 2 pounds beef (there were so many potatoes and carrots there the extra beef was needed) and I added just half a cup of petit verdot. This turned out to be the best beef stew I ever had in my life. Wow! This is definitely going to be a winter staple.

Great! I added a cup of red wine with the stock and then whisked in a a couple tablespoons of butter/cornstarch mash before adding the veg. Yes, it was still a bit thinner than a traditional stew, but the favors were spot on.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! The brothy part was thinner than I like, so I stirred some of the liquid gradually into about 1/4 cup flour until it was smooth, then stirred that back into the stew and cooked until it thickened up. I would probably coat the beef with flour before browning next time instead, because it's easier. I'd probably also double the recipe for leftovers, because it tasted even better the next day.

Rating: 3
This is a good stew to make. Prep time wasn't too bad, about 1/2 total. I followed some of the earlier reccomendations. I used 6 cups of broth and 1 cup of red wine. I did not have the tomato paste or the Worcestershire sauce in the house, so I didn't use them. I substituted fresh thyme for dried as that is what I had and I increased the garlic to 8 cloves because we're crazy like that. I also only had 1 cup of carrots so I added 1 cup of celery to go with it. I increased the meat to 2.5 lbs and decreased the potatoes to 2 lbs. As I mentioned, this is good although today I thought is was missing "something" and couldn't figure it out. In order to thicken the stew at the end, I added some corn start and it did the trick. I would say 2lbs of meat is good intead of 2 1/2. Also, take time to brown the potatoes, I didn't brown all of them and could tell the difference. Still, this hearty stew is great comfort food on a cold, rainy day.

I have made this recipe a few times now and it's fast becoming a regular. I do find it a bit heavy on the potatoes, though, and sparse on the meat. Last time I used a 700g pack of stew beef, added a half glass of wine with the stock etc., and used just enough potatoes to fill the pot... probably 2 lbs. worth. It is better the second day.

Rating: 3
I reviewed this previously explaining that I used 2 cups beef stock + 1 cup red wine. I made this again last night and just used 2 cups of broth with maybe a little more than 2 tbsp of tomato paste. I also think about four cloves of garlic are plenty (and believe me, I love garlic)! I had no carrots and only used one potato. With these changes, the stew was perfect! My husband devoured it. This recipe has great ingredients, but bad measurements. With less broth, potatoes and carrots, it works out great!

Well it was a lazy Saturday morning, cancelling my golf game to make this for my wife and I wish I would of played 18 holes instead. My wife seemed to like it and I was not a huge fan of the dish, I agree like twenty other people to much like a broth. I added about three table spoons of flour to attempt after making it a little thicker. It did not do much for the dish, I do not think I would make this again unless asked to.

I would suggest reducing the amount of liquid or doubling the meat. I substituted a bottle of guinness for some of the stock, reduced the amount of liquid to 5 cups and also doubled the tomato paste. A couple sprigs rosemary also adds a nice flavor. I added the guinness in right after the meat and garlic and so that allowed the meat to really take in the flavor and also become much more tender.

This recipe is great! The only thing I changed was I added parsnips as well, doubled the amount of beef, and added water (in addition to the stock) just to cover. Oh and I floured the beef so that the stock got much thicker. Stew preference. :)

Like some others, I made some modifications that I think help transform this dish into something really excellent. First of all, I made a mix of about 3 tbsp of flour, and, to taste, cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt and pepper, then tossed the beef in this mix. Per directions, I browned the beef, solo then with garlic, then added about 2 cups red wine to simmer for a while before addding beef stock, etc. This not only adds to the flavor of the beef and the stew overall, but it also helps thicken the broth. As other reviewers suggest, lengthening simmer time also helps make beef more tender and produces a thicker stew.

There seemed to be a consistent theme in many of the reviews, so I followed them. Thanks to many of you, it came out great. We did reduce the potatoes by half. We did increase the beef to almost 2 lbs. The best part, we did 10 cups of beef stock AND added 3/4 of a bottle of wine and simmered for about 3 hours. Kosher salt was another good suggestion. I'd suggest putting the veggies in when you are 30 minutes away from finishing to keep them from getting mushy. For me, that was at about 2-1/2 hours into simmer. Added cornstarch at the end to thicken.

Supurb receipe. After noting previous reviews, I too simmered the base for much longer than the recipe called for - my cook time was over four hours and the meat was absolutely tinder. The tip for thicking the sauce is to cover the pot with a screen and let it reduce itself down. I also rinsed the potatoes to reduce starch.

This sounded so simple but turned out delicious. As I was cooking it, I could see the points previous reviewers made-- the sauce was soupy and the meat was a bit dry and tough if you follow the cooking time in the recipe. The key is to cook it much longer than the recipe calls for-- I ended up simmering it for more than 3 hours and the meat and sauce were perfect.

Thank you, lisa662 from NY. I've become completely fed up lately with the recipe reviews on this site - some of the suggestions and changes provided are, I'm sure, quite tasty, but they do not serve to review the recipe provided. The only change I made was to use smaller, whole onions (to appease the picky eater in my family who likes the taste of onion but detests the texture). It's tasty and satisfying, and is good served with some thick-sliced rustic bread for soaking up leftover broth. I personally would have liked the broth to be a bit thicker or a bit less, but overall it was a satisfying and easy dish that the whole family enjoyed. Don't see what makes it Irish, though!

My family and I are in love with this stew, I add something new everytime I cook it, this time I think I will use cornstarch to thickin it and instead of potatoes I will try egg noodles ( the wide variety), I will also toss in a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and see how that turns out. I definantly recomend using a whole can of tomatoe paste for more depth of flavor and drain the beef completly if you don't care for it. try tossing in some beef boullion cubes for a stronger beef flavor.

i made this today and i agree with many of the other cooks. too much liquid, not enough beef, too many potatoes. had i not drained the beef completely before adding the garlic, i would have also said too much oil. it took an hour longer than stated in the recipe for it to become fork tender, so the potatoes degraded a bit as well. when all is said and done, it had good flavor. i'd make it again with quite a few changes including adding a cornstarch slurry to thicken it and longer simmering time for the beef before adding the vegetables.

I agree with all the comments about needing to add red wine, reduce the amount of broth and potatoes, and simmer it longer.

Simmered the stew for 1.5 hours and it was great--beef was tender and veggies soft but not mushy.

Looking at the recipe and all the comments, and having made this just based on the recipe itself, I think it really depends on what you are looking for...This is more like soup than stew (hence the no flour or cornstarch), however, it's more flavorful (as a result of the garlic) than most beef stew recipes. On the surface, we enjoyed this, as different as it was, and will absolutely make it again.

This recipe, prepared as written, has little resemblance to the outstanding Irish stew I enjoyed at Fidel Murphy's on Grand Cayman Island earlier this year. As others have noted, there's way too much liquid for the amount of meat called for, too many potatoes, and an unncessary amount of oil. I'm of the same mind as an earlier poster who thought perhaps the restaurant did not want to share the recipe.

While I have not made this recipe, I note that last reviewer claims to have made it. When the recipe calls for 2 tbsp of tomato paste, you added one 8 oz. can, halved the amount of beef broth, added red wine, mushrooms-- criminis and shiitakes (a real flavor- changer) and pearl onions. You did not make and rate the recipe given--you rated your own recipe.

This stew is great with a few changes. I agree with many of the other comments. I used 2lbs. of Chateaubriand (very tender) dredged in whole-wheat flour with salt and pepper, 4 cups beef broth, 1 cup red wine, and a whole can of tomato paste as changes to the first half of the recipe. I sauted the meat and garlic in a dutch oven, (it sticks) but deglazed with the red wine before adding the rest of the ingredients. Brought it to a boil put the lid on it and then baked it at 325 degrees for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, I melted 2T butter and 2T oil in another big pan to saute 1/2 bag pearl onions and about 15 shiitake mushrooms (sliced) and about 15 cremini mushrooms (sliced). Then added 4 yukon gold potatoes (3/4 in. pieces) and the rest of the vegetables. (Seasoned with S & P.) Sauted the vegetables for another 15 minutes. After the meat cooked for the 30 minutes I added the vegetables to the stew and put it back in the oven for another hour. At the end I added the parsley and boy was it good! Enjoy!

I gave it 3 forks since I took a lot of suggestions below and changed the recipe too much to rate it as is. I doubled the beef (for the kids who eat the beef but won't touch the vegetables), used about 2lbs potatoes instead of 3 and left out the parsley. I completely agree with everyone that there is far too much liquid as written. I used 4 cups of beef stock and 1 cup of red wine and there was still plenty of sauce to dip bread in. I also rolled the beef in a combination of flour, pepper, and an irish garden herb mix (a combination of thyme, rosemary, basil and chives) and browned the meat before adding the other ingredients (except vegetables). Then I baked at 275 for 1 1/2 hours before adding the vegetables and baking for another hour. I didn't bother to saute the vegetables before adding to the stew.

Rating: 3
I definitely agree that the recipe calls for too much liquid; I used 4 cups of beef broth and a bottle of Guiness- this seemed to be a good combination. I'd also advise cutting the thyme from 1 tablespoon to 2 teaspoons.

I made this stew yesterday for the first time and it was mouth watering and tastey. I did add more stew beef than what it called for and also added a full 6 oz can of tomato paste. I didn't have the Guiness beer so just put in a can of Miller Genuine Draft. Added more carrots as I love the flavor of carrots in a stew. The stew was hearty and rich in flavor.

My mum has made this stew for years and i would agree with the comments previously made,as we have used the same recipe(slightly less potatoes,more beef) but cook it slightly different. After browning and removing the meat,brown the veg and deglaze with half a can of guinness. Add the rest of the ingredients in a large pot with 1/4 bot of red wine and just cover with the stock. As t his recipe is meant to be cooked on a very low heat for 2/3 hours the amount of liquid should't then become a problem. For a real Irish touch i always add 1 1/2 cups of pearl barley. That reduces the liquid too. I love this stew. Great for cold days and works just as well with lamb.

Rating: 3
Here it is, Easter Sunday and our guests had to cancel so we had alot of extra lamb. I decided to try this based on the numerous positive reviews. I would give it 4 forks except I know people do not like high (or low) ratings when you've made alot of changes. Took others' advice: reduced the amount of broth, added red wine in place of one cup of broth, used fresh thyme instead of dried, reduced the amount of potatoes (used Yukon Gold...great). I added celery and will add parsnip next time for another level of flavor. Sauteed the vegetables but let them do most of the cooking in the stew. Dusted the meat with flour before browning...better flavor than adding corn starch...my husband hates all the "whites" but he thought the tiny bit of flour was fine. Fast, easy and delicious...with these changes, I'd highly recommend it to anyone but a novice could easily do it and impress.

Thank you to all the other reviewers of this recipe - your suggestions were great which made this stew turn out delicious for a St. Patty's Day party. Increased the beef, reduced the potatoes, added celery, a bottle of Guiness and red wine. Made it on Thursday for a Saturday party and the flavors married, the liquid thickened up and everyone loved it!

don't make this without reading the comments. definitely flour the meat and double the quantity. reduce the liquid. i think i overdid it in combining the suggested liquids. used consomme, a lot of red wine and a bottle of guiness stout. too strong. am making it again tonight in a more sensible fashion!

All the suggestions were on target - and it turned out to be a great stew. Definitely add more meat and reduce the amount of liquid. I did 4 cups beef broth + 1 cup of red wine, plus more wine for deglazing both the pot with beef and the vegetables (since they stuck to my pan). Browning the beef is a must and I substituted brown sugar for regular sugar, which was a nice touch - giving it a slightly sweeter taste. Thanks for making my St. Patty's Day a memorable one.

Rating: 3
Very good. I used 5 cups of liquid (4.5 of broth, 1/2 cup wine, with which I deglazed the pan after doing the beef and garlic) and almost 2 pounds of beef. I also dredged the beef in flour. 8 cups would have been WAY too much liquid. I omitted the potatoes and substituted mushrooms and green beans per one reviewer's suggestion. Very good. Served over egg noodles.

Rating: 4
Excellent, easy, and relatively inexpensive to make. Used 2 lbs of meat, dredged it in flour, and deglazed the pot with a cup of good cabernet before adding the beef stock. I added some mushrooms and was generous with the other vegetables so I didn't feel as if the liquid amount stated in the recipe was too much. I did use a cornstarch slurry, however. Pair this with a big crusty loaf of bread and you'll be in heaven. Served the Chocolate Stout Cake from this website for dessert.....my guests are still raving.

Rating: 3
I had a lot of fun with this and took a lot of other people's suggestions. I practically doubled everything in the recipe except the liquid. For the liquid I used two 12 oz. bottles of Guiness Extra Stout for the rest of the liquid I used canned beef stock and a little water. I also used fresh thyme and some bruised fresh rosemary on the stem which, along with the bay leaves, I removed before serving. I forgot to add Worcestershire even though I like it and meant to add it, but I do not think I missed it. I also roasted the vegetables. You can do so much with this recipe as a template. I might try wine instead of beer the next time. Maybe lamb instead of beef and so on. Cheers! Happy St. Paddy's Day 2007!

Excellent with some suggested modifications (less broth, more beef, add herbs and mushrooms). I'd give it 4 forks, but you really need to adjust the ingredients. I've been looking for a good beef stew recipe for years and this is the last one I'll try! It's really that good!

Perfect flavors for me. I have made this before, and you must dredge the meat in flour before cooking, and perhaps even add a little corn starch at the end -- otherwise, it will be soup. Perfect for winter!

Excellent flavor, satisfying, and easy/quick to make. I would also reduce the beef stock to make a hearty version. I would recommend the additions of 1/8 cup port and 1/4 cup red wine to the stock. I added 1 cup quartered Crimini mushrooms and several diced leeks about 20 minutes before the finish.

Rating: 3
Very good stew, but 8 cups broth is WAY too much liquid, so cut that in half unless you want beef soup. Like others, I dusted the meat with flour before browning to help thicken it up. I even added a corn starch slurry to try to thicken it up with no luck. Anyway, the flavors are wonderful. I also deglazed the pan with some good cabernet before adding the broth. I was out of tomato paste so I added a dollop of Heinz chili sauce -- it was great! Fresh thyme and bay leaves are a must. I will definitely make again but with less broth.

Rating: 4
I doubled this recipe since I was serving it to a large group. I also tossed the beef with flour, salt and pepper and browned the meat in olive oil. With such a large quantity, I combined everything in a large electric roaster oven for more even cooking. Instead of canned beef broth, I used the concentrated beef base and used fresh thyme. Delicious! A true crowd pleaser.

Like many others, I made some changes... I upped the quantity of everything for more stew, but I also: tossed the beef in flour with thyme and oregano before browning (in extra virgin olive oil, for a little more character and richness) Upped the worcestershire content to 3+ TBSP and made the sugar brown Added some other herbs to the stock, notably basil and oregano. Added almost 2 cups of a good cabernet sauvignon, and used it to deglaze the pot after browning the beef. Increased the vegetables, made the potatoes red, added celery and thick-sliced button mushrooms. I also think that next time I will ROAST the vegetables rather than sauté to increase the earthy, rich flavor even more. Maybe with some rosemary. With the increased amount of vegetables, I increased the amount of butter to 4 TBSP. This was a delicious stew, and I plan to keep the modified recipe around for a long time.

Rating: 3
This is a great combination of ingredients, BUT the measurements are insane! I'm thinking the restaurant that shared the recipe really didn't want to share! 8 cups of liquid for a little over a pound of meat is just crazy! And 2 tbsp of tomato paste would get lost in all that liquid! I used 3 cups of beef broth and 1 cup of red wine and there was still plenty of liquid. I used at least 1/2 the can of tomato paste. The potato and carrot measurements are excessive as well - about 1 cup of each is enough! Basically, this is a great mix of ingredients that you just have to play with according to your taste. This would not be a good recipe for a novice cook to try! Everyone's advice is helpful, so if you can wing it based on that too, then you have yourself a great stew!

This recipe yielded mostly broth. The meat was tender and delicious after 2 hours, but I found the stew itself rather bland after reading all the high ratings. As other cooks suggest, I would double the meat, and also add pearl onions, crimini mushrooms and baby potatoes to add more flavor and depth (the potatoes, as prepared, came out mushy).

Wow!! This was my first attempt at a beef stew and it turned out so great! My boyfriend and I were both thoroughly impressed. Using the previous commenters suggestions, I used equal parts beef and potatoes (2lbs), upped the Worchestire to 3Tbls, and added 1.5c of a nice Shiraz to 4cups of stock.. Additionally, I marinated the meat for several hours in a wine/garlic/Worchestire combination, and then dredged the meat in flour before browning. I also ended up (inadvertantly) stewing the meal for about 4-5hrs total.. This worked out perfectly as the meat was oh so tender and broke apart beautifully.. The sauteed veggies were added during the last hour to completely soften. The stew ended up reducing quite a bit and the end product was very thick... Exactly what I wanted!

Yummy! This is a definite keeper. Perfect for a cold winter night. I cut back on the thyme (a whole tablespoon seems like way too much) and used fewer pototoes (3 or 4 were enough). I might try thickening the broth with some flour next time, but it was very good as is.

This recipe is SO GOOD. The only change I make is to add celery in the mix. I also add some Granville Island Winter Ale--the best beer in the world between November and February! The first time I made it I ended up using chicken stock instead of beef (since that's what I had) but it was actually still very good. If I had the time I would make it once a week!

This is my favourite recipe on Epicurious. I make it about once a month, especially in the winter. The flavour is just so delectable and it really warms your belly. I get the logic of others on the site who say that because this is an Irish stew, one should add use Guiness not red wine... but after trying this recipe with both, several times, I have to say that despite it's non-Irishness, adding red wine tastes better than adding beer. That's my two cents.

Double the meat. It's BEEF STEW! That's a lot of veggies and I think it needs more protein. My wife likes peas in her stew and I like mushrooms, so we make those changes.

I'm not even Irish but I really think adding wine to this stew is simply 'not done'. You should try something like Boeuf Bourgignon or a Spanish type of beef stew if you like that kind of flavour. Just try a bottle of Guinness stout or some other strong beer for a bit of an Irish experience.

I have FINALLY found a beef stew recipe worthy of my taste buds! Even my two small children ate it and liked it! I seasoned the beef with salt, pepper, and a roast seasoning blend when cooking, as well as a generous few tablespoons of worcestershire and a tablespoon or so of flour. Cooked it up, and added the garlic then the broth. In the end I would up with WAY more broth than beef and veggies, so I will cut the broth down to 5 cups next time, maybe even 4 after I see how 5 does. After sauteeing the veggies, I deglazed the pan with about 1/2 a small bottle of red wine (the airline size ones) and added that to the stew. Oh, and I added most of a can of tomato paste. Why they can't make tomato paste in a squeeze bottle or something is beyond me. I added some thyme, basil and oregano as well...just can't see beef stew without these seasonings. It was good, probably the best beef stew I've had in a long time...and I am forever searching for a recipe like this that has LOTS of flavor!

I just made this over the weekend and it was very good. I did add about a cup of red wine after browning the meat and added a small can of peas to the stew near the end. I felt it would be better a little thicker and mixed about a T. of flour with the hot liquid and let is cook a bit to thicken. I think next time I'd let it cook for a little longer to make things even more tender. Served with either biscuits or a baguette....yummy.

I really loved this! I have a problem with following recipes, so here are some of the changes I made: I dredged the meat in flour and black pepper before frying it. I used the whole (small) tin of tomato paste (I guess I like it tomato-y), and used about 10 cups of liquid. I used only a pinch of thyme, and a pinch of oregano. If you have time, I recommend that you simmer everything twice as long as it says... it really builds the flavour. I also sauteed 4 stalks of celery with the other veggies, and threw in about 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas right before serving. It was VERY good! I baked the leftovers (the best part) in the oven with a layer of biscuit dough on top... I was heavenly!

FYI - The reason your stew is too thin is you are not adding enough Potatoes and, 40 minutes is not enough time for the potatoes to break down! The potatoes are what thickens stew. Cook everything for 2 hours not 40 minutes. Your stew will be lovely and thick.

This my favorite beef stew. I cut down the amount of liquid I add by a cup or two. I also replace 2 cups of broth with a pint of Guinness. In addition, I make it the night before--I find that the stint in the refrigerator allows the flavors to meld nicely. For a splash of green, I add some peas at the end of cooking. It's delicious served with popovers.

Delicious, absolutely delicious, though it was a little greasy, and I halved the butter and used 2/3 oil. I also used 2 cups red wine in place of stock, which gave it a nice, robust flavour.

This was tasty but I thought 8 cups of broth for the amount of beef called for in the recipe sounded a bit too soupy so I used 4 pounds of beef along with the potatoes and carrots.

I will definitely make it again, but will cut down a bit on the broth and perhaps add some red wine in place of some of the broth.

This was the best stew we've had. Definitely a keeper.

This was a really good stew, and probably the best I've ever made. Not sure if it's the best I've ever had overall, but for me- a novice chef- to be able to produce this was pretty great! I followed several other comments and subbed a cup of broth for Guiness. I also dredged my beef in flour and cut back on the potatoes. Next time I'd add more beef. Only real downside to this dish is that it seemed like I had to add a lot of salt to get some flavor.

The suggestions in the reviews of this recipe have really perfected it. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe as is, except substituting a Guinness for some of the stock. It was fine. The second time, I made the following changes: (1) doubled the amount of meat and tomato paste; (2) reduced the amount of thyme; (3) reduced the potatoes to 2 lbs; (4) reduced the stock to 4 cups and added a Guinness; (5) added 1/2 cup celery; (6) dredged the meat in flour before frying; (7) prepared the stew in the morning and reheated in the evening. The new version was delicious, a major improvement. A great winter meal for everyone, especially the meat-and-potatoes crowd; very satisfying. (PS I definitely recommend saute-ing the vegetables, even though it's extra work; it really livens up the flavor and makes it more complex.)

Rating: 3
I make this stew often and everyone loves it - the flavor is wonderful. Just go ahead and put the whole can of tomato paste in and some red wine or dark beer. After the meat cooks for about an hour, add the veggies (I skip the saute step). When the potatoes are very tender, remove some of them, mash them and return them to the stew. This thickens it nicely.

It's stew, and it tastes fine, but not exciting. For the work, the recipe for Mahogany Beef Stew is infinitely better, although if you were making "Irish Beef Stew", you probably weren't looking for a stew that uses hoison and red wine as it's base like the Mahogany Stew does

Excellent basic stew. My family is Irish, so I made a few changes to make it more like my childhood favorite. I used lamb (tossed the pieces in flour before browning), used only 2+1/2 lb. potatoes (which still ended up seeming like a lot), peeled baby carrots (all I had), and 2 cups of beer plus 5 cups beef broth (total 7c). Cooked it for a couple of hours. Used flour to thicken, even with less total liquid added and all that cooking time it was still too watery. Otherwise excellent but not overly memorable.

I made this just as specified and it was a good Winter meal. The only correction I would suggest is to brown the onions and the potatoes separately. While I had a big enough skillet, there was just too much vegetables in the skillet to brown them properly.

I made this recipe using 6 cups of stock, and one bottle of Dark Stout. I also left out the sugar, used 2 lbs. of meat dredged in flour, and half of the potatoes.

Came back to add a review and saw that it was unnecessary...never seen so many reviews for a recipe here before! Nonetheless, this is the only stew I make any more (and as a former restaurant professional and native of New England, I've made plenty of others). My vegetarian daughter eats it, it's so good. The gist of many reviews: yes, reduce the fat, not all necessary; I have never used the full amount of potatoes, and there is not too much stock. Some people like a thicker stew, but I think is fine as is. Any way you fudge it, it is still the best stew recipe ever!!! Worth the effort to saute the veggies!

I made this for an easy, basic stew. I dredged the meat in flour & cook for 5 min., added cabernet sauvignon and let it simmer before the broth. I thickened the broth with flour and also added celery w/ the veggies. It was god and I'll make it again. The baby even liked it!

I've been looking for a great beef stew recipe.(In Ireland the stew is typically made with lamb). Took the advice of the many reviewers and ended up with a fantastic rich meaty stew that is great with mashed spuds w/scallions or a nutty couscous dish. Here's what I did; Omitted the sugar and potatoes. Halved the garlic and beef stock. Used 2lbs of stewing steak and dredged in seasoned flour before sauteing. Added 2 stalks of chopped celery to the onion and carrot. MOST IMPORTANT added 2 cps of Guinness (bottle better than can). Cooked it all for about 4 hrs and it was fantastic! My mum loved it when she visited!

We were looking for a dish for St.Patrick's day and this was perfect. We thickened it at the end with a little cornstarch water, and used fresh thyme but that was all for the change. It was delicious and we had lots of compliments

I don't understand the high ratings, either. My parents were from Ireland, so I grew up with Irish food. As far as I'm concerned, it isn't Irish stew without the Guinness. I remade this omitting 2 cups of the broth and adding a 14 oz can of Guinness. I cut back on the garlic by half, even though I love it. I used one teaspoon of thyme and it was plenty. I also added salt and pepper to taste. There is no need for all that oil, either. I dredged the meat in flour before cooking it in about 3 tbsps of oil. The flour also serves to thicken the stew and more can be added if needed. I ended up adding a few tbsps more by first shaking it in a container with about 1/4 cup water. After adding it, bring the stew to a boil again for a few minutes. There is also no need to saute the vegetables first in even more fat. Just drop them in the stew after an hour and cook them until everything is tender. After making it this way, I had a stew that was bursting with flavor and the meat was very tender. Don't worry if the stew tastes bitter right after you add the Guinness. That will go away. Boiling also takes out all of the alcohol. My teenage son, who never eats much, ate two huge bowls of this.

For our early Irish dinner, I made both the Irish lamb stew on this site and this beef stew along with the Irish Pub Salad and the soda bread. A friend made the Choclate Stout cake with sauce. The beef stew was terrific and I would make again - following suggestions from others to flour the beef, substitute brown sugar for granulated, add 1 T. molasses, extra stout beer for part of the beef stock, small red potatoes, and making a roux to thicken. It surpassed the lamb stew which was quite time-consuming to make, in flavor. Irish pub salad was a nice accompaniment and we added mashed potatoes since we were serving two stews on dinner plates. Great menu - cake the weakest. I also served three types of Irish cheese as appetizers.

I thought this was good beef stew, if not very basic-- and what makes it Irish? Anyway, I prepared it for an Irish-themed art gallery opening, putting it in little phyllo cups, and it was very well received.

I liked the recipe, but would cut back on the thyme. I found it to be too much. I also added other vegetables like green beans, celery, peas, etc. I also thickened it with a little flour.

A few modifications made this stew amazing. First of all, irish stew simply is not irish without some stout beer. A bottle of guiness makes the broth rich and dark. We also thought that coating the beef in flour before browning sounded like a good idea, and found that it adds a little thickness to the broth that is wonderful. Double the beef if you like your stew meaty.

I used Cambell's double strenth beef broth and only 71/2 cups. Also added 3 celery stalks. So good!

Tweaked it around a bit, doubled the meat and used vennison along with beef tips. Used 3lbs potatoes and added a dash of herb de provence to the flour which the meat was coated with. Also added the Guinness... which is a step you can't skip! Like the idea of a roux... will try that next time, I think. This is a perfect winter meal.

Excellent. I also added guiness and more meat. I also made a roux to thicken the stew.

We followed the advice of the other raters and added Guiness, increased the meat, added a small diced turnip and a handful of peas. We were initially concerned with the thickness of the sauce, however, found that after simmering longer it was the perfect consistency. In addition, we added a family recipe for dumplings which made the dish superb. A great dish for a cold winter's evening.

Followed recipe family liked it - made some changes and they LOVED it. Used steak tips (worth the extra) and doubled the amount; dredged in flour, s&p, browned in olive oil. I don't think it's necessary to saute veggies first unless you are in a hurry to get overything to cook faster- otherwise I don't see the difference in taste. Omit sugar - use Guinness (18 oz) and 6-8 cups of beef broth, I add some celery and a package of frozen peas near the end. Make more than you need and freeze for another time. As with most things, better the second day. Serve with Beer Bread and it's a big hit - (3 cups self rising flour, 3 tbsp sugar, 1 can room temp beer @ 350 for one hour and butter the top).

I've made this twice, first with russet potatoes and then with yukon gold. I used a chuck roast that I cut up removing much of the fat. It's much better than stew meat and uniform throughout. Doubled meat and carrots and added some chopped celery. Kept the potatoes to 3#s. Next time I'll use white or red potatoes - russets disengrate and yukon golds not much better. Everything else followed the recipe. Great flavor!

This is a really flavourful stew that I would definitely make again. I followed suggestions to dredge the beef in flour before frying it and to reduce the beef stock and add a can of Guinness. I also reduced the amount of potatoes (I used 5 red ones, skin on) and added a couple of turnips and a few parsnips. And instead of sugar I used molasses, which gave it a nice rich, slightly sweet flavour. The longer you let this simmer, the better. And it definitely improves after a day or two in the fridge. Perfect thing for a cold fall day!

This was very good for a cold Sunday evening. Followed suggestions of adding beer and more meat and dredged the beef cubes in flour before browning. Also included more garlic and some sliced mushrooms. Husband hovered around the pot doing a little happy stew dance and begging for tastes.

I too floured my meat before browning and used olive oil. In the end it made a very nice sauce, not runny. I added 1 bunch fresh spinach, 2 Zucchinni, and extra meat along with the carrots and potatoes. I also only added 1/2 of the potatoes the recipe called for. It was more than enough. The beer was a added bonus!(1 can Guiness Beer)(6 Cups Stock) My family loved it, and it made the whole house smell delicious!

Excellent Stew! Like some others, I added more beef, used a good microbrew beer to add to the broth, and cut the sugar out. I also added celery, personal taste. It is better the next day!

I should have read the reviews to find out that it was important to coat the beef in flour. The stew was awesome, but I had to thicken it at the last minute, as it resembled soup. I agree that you could use less potatoes. I would also add more carrots & perhaps peas. I used a crockpot, and added the vege/potato mix, three hours before serving. Definitely a keeper for the cold winter months!

Rating: 4
This is such a great recipe. I have made it twice now. I used at least twice as much stew meat - covered in flour and sauted in olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also added a longneck of Guiness beer, added a cup or more of celery, and at least 2 extra tablespoons of tomato paste. I needed a little salt too...just my taste. It is a recipe that is even better the next day, just as many others say. I served with salad and a loaf of crusty bread. Ahhh....comfort food at its best.

Delicious!! I've made this stew a few times now. Very tasty and filling. Rich & gorgeous. I made a few changes: I added a c. of red wine, which is sweet enough to allow the sugar to be omitted. I agree with the comments about adding a little extra meat. I don't bother sauteeing the veggies - too much work for me - I just throw'em in. And I add frozen peas in towards the end. The changes I made are more out of personal preference than necessity. Can't wait to try making it with beer!

I realized it was St Patrick's Day, I was at work, and I didn't have hours to prepare a stew. I started the recipe at 5, didn't change a thing except to dredge the beef in flour, and enjoyed a thick stew by 7. I didn't have to cook for hours longer as others have stated -- the stew was plenty thick (and thicker the next day) and the meat was ever so tender. I did use a higher-quality meat, Omaha Steaks sirloin tips, and next time I will definitely add more of them. The stew was a little bit sweet, so I would probably cut back or out the sugar next time.

Rating: 4
This is a fabulous recipe for beef stew. The only thing I changed was to add more meat. There simply wasn't enough - especially if feeding a bunch of hungry men. I usually add another pound of beef which works out great. Also, I cut the amount of broth to 6 cups and added a can of Guinness. Delicious!

Rating: 4
My family & I absolutely love this recipe. We've been making it for about 3 years. This is definitely a standard in our fall/winter menu cycle! You might need to play around with the amount of sugar & thyme to the recipe, but it all depends on personal taste. This is delicious served w/ a crusty piece of bread!

Very good, my family loved it. Next time I will add more beef and add a green vegetable such as peas or limas and use less potatoes.

This is a good start but I will want to tweak it a little next time. I read the reviews and used many of their suggestions: seasoned the beef before dredging it in flour, doubled the beef, worcestershire sauce and tomato paste, reduced the potatoes, added chopped celery, replaced 1 pt of broth with Guinness. Added mushrooms because I can't have stew without them (no idea whether they're usually in Irish food.) The Guinness left a strong aftertaste at first but increased simmering helped diminish it. I guess I'm a cabernet rather than a beer person! Next time, I'll either cut back on the Guinness or break away from the Irish stew and use wine.

Rating: 4
I recently made this stew. It was fabulous. Changes I made: I did replace some of the beef broth with Guinness. Because I doubled the recipe, I ended up adding a whole can of tomato paste. I used lamb instead of beef and dredge it in flour prior to browning. (The meat was soooo tender!) I thickened the stew by using some of the simmering broth and mixed it with flour. My family loved it. I brought a bowl to a new friend of mine - a native of Dublin, Ireland. As I wanted an honest opinion I didn't just ask her if she liked it, but what she would do to improve the stew. She said it was quite delicious and the only thing she would change would be to add more thyme. In truth, I ran out of thyme and didn't have as much as the recipe called for. So except for the small changes I made, this will be my Irish stew recipe and I will make it often! Thanks for all of your suggestions - this was a big hit.

Thought this recipe was good but could use some improvement.

I agree with many of the other reviewers that this recipe needs adjusting. I added the Guinness, tossed the beef in salt & pepper before browning (should have also tossed in flour), more than doubled the tomato paste, added balsamic vinegar, used a corn starch slurry, and a few other things. It's fine, but I'm going to keep hunting for a recipe to become our favorite.

Followed the advice of previous cooks and used 1 pint of Guinness in place of some of the beef broth. Also added 2 celery stalks with the veggies and after adding the sauteed vegs to the meat, allowed it to simmer at very low heat for about an hour and a half. Very tasty - and satisfied two very selective eaters!

Rating: 3
This is a very good basic recipe. Like most of the other reviewers I made a few changes: Added only 7 cups of broth instead of 8, and used a pint of Guinness (my boyfriend is Irish and would be horrified if I used wine), used 3 tbsp of tomato paste instead of 2, added 2 stalks of celery and a bit of cornstarch at the end to make it more aesthetically pleasing. Oh, I also used only 2.5 lbs of potato but I still think it was too much - next time, I'll only use 1.5-2 lbs, as they really overpowered the dish, and will definitely double the amount of beef. Much better after sitting for a day, so make it a day ahead of time! Really tasty and we were all happy to have leftovers (not that they lasted long!).

I took this recipe and modified it to what I had on hand. I had a two pound chuck roast which I chopped up into stew meat. I used the broth I had in the freezer(which I think was poultry.) I used more worchester sauce than called, probably 2-3T with the meat cooking and then a little more towards the end. I didn't have any thyme or tomato paste, but instead threw in some celery and a small can of spicy V8. It came out fabulous. The man of the house raved and raved, says he wants it again. Now if I can just repeat what I did last time, LOL.

Where's the beef? The flavors are quite good but this is mostly vegetables.If I make this again I will double the amount of beef (or actually halve the vegetables. Following other's suggestions, I substituted a cup of stout for an equal amount of beef broth and thickened it at the end with flour.

Wonderfully rich flavor. I first made this recipe for friends who had come to visit for some rigorous skiing last winter. It was perfect coming in from the cold, and off the slopes.

I have never made a beef stew before. I threw a small dinner party and served this dish to my friends. Everyone loved it! I must say that I am grateful to all the other cooks who added their comments and suggestions. I added 16 oz or red wine and put less beef bullion. I thickened it with corn starch and left out sugar. I also added parsely dumplings from another beef stew recipe on this site. The dumplings were a great final touch. I highly recommend this recipe if you have a few hours to kill.

My husband says stew is one of those things that looks like it should be really good, but seldom is. "This is good stew", and coming from him, that is saying volumes. Did not have enough of the Kitchen basics beef stock so added some cab to make up the difference, and as suggested, added some fresh peas at the end. The flavor addition from the saute' veg is nice too, don't skip that step.

I wish I had read more reviews of this stew before I made it last night. It was average with little flavor...I did flour my meat first and found that just that flour added to the thickness in the end. I was hoping for more depth in the flavor and will add wine or beer next time without a doubt. It definatly needed salt and cracked pepper and I will ask around for another herb to add to the thyme. I absolutly agree it is much better the next day. This is a keeper if reworked a little. Have a nice day.

This is so simple, it's hard ro figure out why it tastes so good, but it does. If your meat isn't browning, you're probably putting too many pieces in the pot. If they touch each other, they stew, not brown. Use tongs and do a few pieces at a time, removing them as they brown. I couldn't get the veggies to brown, though. Pan too crowded maybe? Stew was still good, though.

Very tasty stew. When I make it again, I will make a few changes, though. Not quite so much broth, although it's good for bread dipping. I'm with the other cooks about dredging the meat in flour first. Also, I won't cook the veggies in a separate pot next time. Don't need the added butter/fat or mess. I also added fresh mushrooms and some Cajun seasoning for a kick.

Very good stew - three things need changing. First, make a flour and water mixture (slurry) and pour it in once you have combined all ingredients - this makes it heartier. Second and third, use 2 1/2 lbs. meat, and reduce potatoes to 2 lbs. Otherwise, great one!

Excellent. I made a couple of changes: used a whole can of tomato paste, substituted red wine for about 1/3 of the liquid, added turnips (because I, and only I, like them) as well as pearl onions, and used a little corn starch-mixed-with-stew-liquid for thickener.

Here is the problem people are having: You are not cooking this long enough! Cook it 40 minutes to an hour more than what the recipe calls for and it will thicken on its own, no thickening agent necessary. The starch in the potatoes will thicken the stew, just be patient. It will also be thicker and tastier if you make it a day ahead of time. I made the recipe as is, with the exception of dredging the beef in flour before browning and doubling the beef amount, and it was wonderful. Next time I will cut the potatoes larger (they disintergrate a bit from cooking so long)and add turnips or parsnips for variety.

This stew has a great flavor and is perfect for a healthy, cool weather, economical meal. I did use two potatoes less than 3 lbs, and may try using less beef stock next time, maybe 1 cup less so it is a bit thicker. Loved the flavor of the thyme and garlic.

I found this recipe both easy and subtile. I particularly liked the method of frying the potatoes together with the onions and carrots before adding them to the stew. That way they remain slightly crunchy and don't get mushy. I guess I will be using this method in some of my own stews as well. I also liked the sugar in it; definitely enhances the flavour. Yet I'm thinking of substituting Guinness stout for sugar the next time, to give it an extra classic British touch.

Rating: 3
Not bad... I'd have liked it a bet thicker sauce though. I suggest letting it simmer uncovered longer so that the sauce becomes a bit thicker. Adding other veggies (corn, celery, turnip, etc) can mix this up a bit. Go heavy on the worschester

Not a bad recipe for a bit of the Irish. But no celery? that's a crime! (best shaved first). Why are so many people adding wine? This is no French cassoulet, y'know. Brown ale or Stout is the way to go. Those of you trying to cut down the cooking time are missing the point. You can't overcook this dish, it just keeps getting better with age. If you have the willpower, have a can of soup or something on the day you make it, and come back to the stew the next day. Your patience will be more than repaid! My nanna taught me how to cook this - and she's from Dublin.

Very hearty stew is almost indistinguable after I got done tinkering with it! I didn't have 8 cups of broth or enough boullion so I added half of a Coca Cola (no sugar and yes, it is a Southern thing)and a beer to four cups of broth. Sustituted corn for carrots and added a whole can of diced tomatoes. Everything else is the same and it is WONDERFUL. Especially if you get a little pan brown on the veges before you add them.

Just like my grandmother used to make. I don't understand why some folks need to flour the beef. If you simply remove all the moisture from the beef first (pat dry with paper towels) it will brown just fine. The sauce should thicken on its own from two things: 1) from being reduced and 2) from the starch in the potatoes...if that doesn't happen, you probably haven't cooked the stew with the potatoes long enough.

I made this and the lamb stew for a troop of guests for St. Patricks Day. Both recipes got rave reviews. A whole tablespoon of thyme frightened me so I used about a half and the stew was still very thyme-y. I had to drain the sauce after a couple of hours and thicken it, so I think the other reviewers tip to dredge the meat in flour and then brown it is a good idea. If I had only read all the reviews before making the stew...I almost dredged the meat (since the lamb stew calls for this) but then decided not too! Definitely dredge! Wonderful for a cold winter day.

I altered the recipe slightly based on previous reviews and it came out great, my family LOVED it! I too dredged the meat in seasoned flour first. I added some red wine, used a little over 2 lbs. of meat, about 1 cup of potatoes and more carrots, no parsley (didn't have any.) The only thing is, it seemed kind of salty, maybe from the Worcestershire Sauce? I used beef "Better than Bouillon" for the beef stock. The gravy came out nice and thick, I didn't even have to worry about thickening it, and simmered it for a total of about 3 hours, meat came out nice and tender. Didn't even have to skim the fat, I had used very lean meat from the butcher. Real keeper, will make this again!

i also used about 3 pounds stewing beef. i also used about 5 red potatoes with the skin left on and i added some parsnips (because i like them). the thyme is a must as is the bay leaf but i didn't use worchestershire sauce or tomato paste (i had none) i used some chopped tomatoes and i dredged the beef in flour before browning. also added red wine to deglaze the pan and to the 8 cups of water i used one knorr beef bullion cube and some salt,too. it's really tasty even though i didn't follow the recipe exactly. i cut down on the oil too and didn't saute the veg. in butter.

Rating: 3
I made this again 12 months later and after many more reviews and tips. This time I used lamb, red wine, concentrated paste and cooked it for 21/2 hours. It was even better! I also made the Parsley Dumplings found under "Irish Stew" and they were very good also. Watch the size of those though so that they cook all the way through. Oh, and I agree with 2 lbs of meat, browned with flour and s&p, and I prefer less potatoes-just 2+ lbs.

Rating: 3
This recipe is great with a few alterations. Firstly, I use one small can of paste, 2 cups of red wine and more thyme. I also use a little more sugar. It is also very important to use Russett type potatoes and stew for at least 4 hours. If you do this, the spoon will stick up in the bowl like all great stew should, as my husband says.

Rating: 4
Easy to prepare, excellent aroma and final result very tasty. I followed others suggestions and dredged the beef in flour before cooking. I also used the oil from the stew to cook the vegetables, and cut down on the butter. I used a bit more tomato paste.

Rating: 3
I took many of the suggestions here and added some wine, and fewer potatoes. I also dredged the beef in a little seasoned flour before browning. I thought it was just so-so after the described amount of cooking time, so I set it aside for the following night. The next day, after simmering for another 2 hours or so the meat was almost ready to fall apart and the gravy had taken on a much richer flavour. Fantastic.

I made this dish for my grandparents who are meat and potato eaters. They raved to me and then raved to my father which is a big deal. I made a few changes. I left the skin on the potatoes and the carrots which helped to thicken the dish and added extra nutrients. I added 6 cups of chicken broth(I was out of beef), 2 cups of cabernet and 3 cubes of pure beef boullion. I also added an extra tablespoon of tomato sauce which also helped to thicken it. Delicious.

Rating: 1
I follwed the given recipe and the result was rather blah. I suppose I needn't have been excited--it is, after all, just beef stew. It has potential, though. I'd make it again with some changes--adding more meat or substituting lamb, substituting beer for part of the beef broth, thickening the broth (I like thick stews...this was way too thin and a bit oily).

This was really yummy! To save a little simmering time, I put the beef, broth and garlic - plus substitution of canned peeled plum tomatoes over tomato paste, and of course some red wine- into a pressure cooker and let it come to a steam about 8 times. I sauted the veggies separately, and added it all together and let it simmer about 45 minutes. It was fantastic - and alot quicker than an all-day stewing affair!

Rating: 0
Very Tasty...I added a bit of thickener and also about a cup of red wine. I omitted the tomato paste (because there was none at hand) and increased the gralic and the beef portions. The red wine is a key, I believe, to enhance the flavor. The whole family enjoyed it and ate the left-overs (which is almost a first). It seemed even better the second time around .

A great, hearty stew with my modifications: I use two pounds of beef (it's beef stew, after all!), using sirloin tips to improve the quality. I *definitely* add a good dose of red wine to brighten it up (about 1/3 a bottle). I leave the peels on the potatoes and carrots to make it heartier and tastier. I usually just sautee a couple of vine-ripened tomatoes instead of the paste, and because I like it thick, I add only about 2/3 to 3/4 of the stock called for. I also add some sliced shitake mushrooms for the last fifteen to twenty minutes. Also, you must must must let this baby simmer for a good two and a half to three hours -- it's amazing what a long stew will do for the taste. This is a often-requested meal that lasts for days.

Rating: 2
Very 'blah', even though I used homemade stock and added lots of salt and pepper. Defintely reduce oil to 1 T for browning. Ratio of potatoes to beef is very high. Need to add more spices if you like stew with any taste. I added flour to get a better consistency (2 T dissolved in stew stock)

Rating: 3
made it for 13 people EVERYONE loved it. i cut down on the amount of oil used to brown the meat...as it became too fatty (i made two separate batches). also, make sure that the vegetables are tender when you add them to the beef mix, it keeps the simmer time down to about 40 min instead of the 1 1/2 hr time i experienced the second time.

My husband just loved this stew! He said I could make it again anytime. I used beef broth from a starter, 1/2 can of tomato paste, two potatoes, and added mushrooms in the last few minutes of cooking. It was delicious.

I tried using the whole can of tomato paste as people suggested in the review section and found that it was way too tomato-y. Stick to the two tablespoons. i deglazed with a light beer which was nice too. i might use a waxy potato instead next time.

Absolutely fantastic! I'm a new cook....never had the inclination before but I was able to follow all the instructions. [I had to buy a new big stew pot though!] My other half made orgasmic noises as he ate it and said that it was better than his mother's. Praise indeed!!

Rating: 3
The flavor was unusual and very tasty. Next time I will use less potatoes and more meat. I used a third of a can of tomato paste which worked great. I used fresh thyme probably more than a tablespoon, instead of dried thyme. I will definitely cook this again and enjoy the leftovers this time.

This is a delicious well balanced stew. I also used a whole can of tomato paste as well as 2 pounds of stew meat. Also added wine which gave it a nice flavor. Next time, I will delete the oil to brown the meat, ended up draining it off anyway. Very good recipe. Will definitely make again.

This is a delicious beef stew. I know lots of people added a whole can of tomato paste, I didn't and was very pleased with how it turned out. It had a rich broth and didn't taste heavy like some other beef stews that I have made. I would, I will, make this again.

I have made this dish several times and it is quite easy and absolutely delicious. I have meade several beef stews and Bourgignon's and this one is one of my favorites! I would advise adding the whole can of tomato paste and cut back a little on the potatoes or add more beef to balance it out. I have even made this dish for company on afew occasions and they went back for seconds and thirds!

Rating: 3
This makes, to me at least, exactly what I imgaine stew should taste like. I dredged the beef in a little salt and pepper seasoned flour before sauteing because that's my what I'm used to for doing for stew and I added the whole (small) can of tomato paste cause I wouldn't have had any use for the leftover paste anyway. Most importantly, I cut the broth to 6 cups and added a can (about 14 oz) of Guiness to the liquids. Hey, it's *Irish* right? Next time I'll have to remember to leave some of the potato chunks larger -- they do tend to fall apart, which thickens the stew but disappoints hardcore tater lovers like me.

Rating: 1
I followed this recipe percisely except to add the whole can of tomato paste - it was a disappointment. It was too bland - perhaps the large quantity of potatoes nullified the flavorings. However, it did improve after sitting 24 hours. I finally added some canned tomatoes seasoned with Italian herbs to improve the flavor a little. I would not repeat this recipe because I know there are many better ones available.

This was truly delicious! I usually end up adding spice to recipes, but this one needed nothing but a tiny bit of salt. The flavor is terrific, and I suspect that is partially due to the miraculous addition of worcestershire. I highly recommend this recipe as it is easy and a crowd-pleaser!

1st attempt at stew. Next day was better but still very bland. Soup did thicken, b/c I added half my potatoes into the pot while sauteing (all the veggies didn't fit into pan). Those potatoes broke down too much and gave the soup a mushy texture.

I lived in Ireland for a many years, and had lots of variations of Irish stew: in pubs, restaurants, and friend's homes. Some were good, some were not so good. This is a wonderful adaptation of the Irish classic. It was easy to prepare, hearty and delicious. I'd choose this one over just about any 'authentic' version I've had.

This was really easy and flavorful. My family was taste testing during the last 40 minutes, and the only thing they felt this stew needed was salt. I hadn't added any, so I did and it made all the difference. Will defintely make again, I'd like to try it with lamb as suggested.

I agree with the review below mine, a good basic recipe. This is what I did differently, I sauteed the tomatoe paste (after the garlic) before adding the liquids, I then added a few splashes of wine. Then I added the broth, about 5 cups. I added marjoram and thyme. I used cornstarch to thicken the stew. When I sauteed the vegetables I added the same spices to the pan. I served it over a bed of rice and it was really good. My only advice in avoiding bland stews is to season it as you go along (including the meat - before browning).

Rating: 2
I thought this was a good basic stew. It was also interesting to make, the amount of thyme and garlic seemed excessive, but it worked. I was really intrigued by the frying of the vegies in butter, seemed like a great idea, however in the end I doubt it made much difference. I like my stew SPICY, and I think many cooks who make stews would have a hard time with this one, you know what you like, and this was not quite "it". However for someone new to a stew it was perfect. It was very good, well worthy of this site, but like many others, I will go back to what I like (I use curry, thyme, allspice, majoram, white pepper, cracked black pepper, red pepper flakes, cumin, fresh anything I can get, and almost always, even if I have to make a special trip to buy it: parsley at the very end). Stews are a wonderful meal, great for imagination and creativity. The day I insist that a stew follow a set of rules, I will hang up my apron! Finally, a fun thing to do with a stew such as this is to serve with some gremolata, why not?

Rating: 1
Chicago - the ingredient you can't put your finger on is a nice little slug of red wine ! Transforms any beef stew. I also put in the juice of one orange & a few shakes of Tabasco sauce, fresh parsley sprigs & much less liquid. Cooking a stew in the oven at a low heat (325) also makes for a better dish IMO. My recipe is from Arabella Boxer's winter cookery book & is the best beef stew I've ever made or tasted.

Rating: 2
Boring dish. Nothing extraordinary IMO. I used less oil and about 7 cups of broth per the reviews and I am grateful because it worked out fine. Definitely needs a healthy dose of salt and pepper along with something else that I can't put my finer on...maybe chocolate. :)

I found this recipe to be very ordinary. It wasn't bad, but just tasted like regular old beef stew. I only used a couple teaspoons of oil to brown the stew meat since previous reviewers stated that 1/4 cup was way too much. I used 4 cans of Swanson's beef broth, which was a little more than 7 cups. I had red potatoes on hand, and substituted them for the russets. Since red potatoes aren't as starchy, I think the gravy didn't thicken as much as I would have liked, so I did add a bit of cornstarch to thicken. My family enjoyed the stew with hot rolls, but didn't think the meal was extra special. I was a bit disappointed considering how many reviewers have raved over this dish.

This is a wonderful recipe. I used about 2 1/2 lbs. of beef, 4 lbs. of potatoes, and added about two more tablespoons of tomato paste.

Great stew! I will definately make it again for my parents-in-law who don´t like too spicy food.

My first experience making beef stew. There was way too much liquid, so I separated the broth, then reduced it, then added buerre manie to thicken. The thyme made every bite of meat crunchy. I made it a second time with a wine and beef broth reduction, and then spent a lot of time at the end straining the thyme leaves out. If I make this again, I would make a thyme bouquet garni.

This recipe is about the same thing I do with no instructions (using a roast or stew beef) and toss in the crockpot. Good and easy. The difference is sauteing the veggies first - I'll try that next time. My own thought is that unless you are planning on vegetable beef soup green beans and corn and such don't belong in this dish.
