I used 2 chiptles in adobo--seeds scraped--and 1 TBSP adobo sauce. It didn't adhere and singe on the pork as I expected it would at the high heat...was kinda runny. Not great, will try another alternative next time.

This was fine, but I'll try the other maple-chipotle glaze mentioned by other reviewers next time. Because some members of my family prefer less heat, I took a few moments to remove the seeds and membranes from the peppers. On a side note... Why would anyone feed a toddler something that is so spicy? I would never my kids give something with hot peppers in ANY form or amount without checking it first. Just common sense and good parenting. duh.

i thought this was way too spicy, and i like medium spicy food. my kids wouldn't eat it at all, and my son, who is 16 months cried at how hot it was, even after i scraped off all of the sauce. next time i'll try the maple chipotle glaze for the corn on the cob.

I made this recipe, but used the glaze from GRILLED CORN ON THE COB WITH MAPLE-CHIPOTLE GLAZE as recommended by another reviewer and it was excellent. I will definitely make it again. I used 3 chipolte peppers and it was nice and spicy, but not overpowering. mmmm... delicious!

Couldn't find chipotle peppers so added chopped jalapeno instead. Seasoned pork with chili powder, garlic, and pepper before covering with sauce. Cooked at 375 for about 35 minutes and turned out very tender & delicious. I made pineapple-mango salsa for a topping also. Everyone loved it!

This was just ok. Here's a tastier one for sweet/spicy on pork - use the maple chipotle glaze from this recipe: GRILLED CORN ON THE COB WITH MAPLE-CHIPOTLE GLAZE. I brushed it on pork, then grilled, and also brushed it on sweet potato wedges before baking. Added a nice salad to cool it down, and it was a spectacular meal.

I roasted the pork for about 30 minutes and it came out very juicy and tender. I like spicy food - but 3 chilpotle chilies is way to much for me - I used one large and it was just the right temp. Quick and easy to make- always a plus for me

I usually love the taste of chipotle but I gave this recipe two forks because it wasn't that flavourful. Also I found that I had to roast it far longer than 20 minutes. I agree with the previous reviewer who mentioned that the Spiced Pork Tenderloin (August 1991) recipe from this site is far better.

Way too hot. Should probably have seeded the chilis. I thought honey would contribute more to the flavor--just hot,hot and more hot.

We thought this was OK, but I don't plan to make it again. We like the Spiced Pork Tenderloin recipe on this site much better. I agree with reviewers who said this recipe packs a lot of heat but not much flavor.

Absolutely fabulous! Great sauce, easy prep, nice flavor. I used dried chipotle chile's, reconstituted them in warm water, and added tomato sauce instead of the canned chiles. Served roasted potato rounds, carrots, and red onions as a side. Roasted corn was the other side with a toasted star anice coarse salt, and lime juice seasoning.

Very good......However, next time I would make a little extra of the marinade to use as a sauce...I grilled on the BBQ and it didn't leave us with enough flavor of the yummy marinade....Will definitly make again!!!

This is a favorite of ours and numerous guests. It also works well with pork chops -- just marinate in a ziplock bag and cook on the grill.

I had pork loin and was desperately searching for a quick recipe for which I had the ingredients. This fulfilled all the criteria and turned out dynamite to boot! I served it with the skillet corn bread on this site, which offered a nice contrast to the spicy pork.

Rating: 4
I used a centre-cut pork loin, not a tenderloin, so altered recipe slightly & increased the cooking time. Used 4 chilis, 4 garlic cloves & doubled the honey. Browned the roast before brushing on a couple of tablespoons of glaze. To keep the glaze from burning, I roasted at 375 for about 20 minutes, then brushed on more glaze. Repeated the 'basting' every 15 - 20 minutes until done. Also turned the roast a cuple of times. The result?? Fabulous! The entire family loved it. Will make this again.

I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion and served sliced with flour tortillas, avocado, shredded lettuce, sour cream, grated jack, and salsa. Also served with black beans and Spanish rice. The smoky, spicy flavors of the pork worked really well in the tacos. It was great, super easy, and I'll definitely make it again.

If it was an option, I would have said three and a half forks. It was delicious. I actually used a pork loin rather than tenderloins, which is what I think was called for. I served it garnished with carmelized onions on top of corn pudding (which was nice and mellow with the heat) with a tomato, avocado, and sweet onion salad with a lemon dressing that balanced out the heat. I prepared it on the grill (indorect heat) and basted it while it cooked. There was a nice, sweet/spicy crust. I'll absolutely do it again.

Besides being an easy mid-week meal, this recipe is really nothing special. The flavor is very one dimensional. That is, it's mostly just hot (and I usually love hot and spicy food). There's a hint of smokiness, a hint of sweetness, but both are overpowered by the heat of the peppers. If I ever make this again, I'll marinate the pork before cooking. I also like the suggestion another reviewer had of using the pork in tacos. It definitely needs to be mixed with other flavors!

This recipe has become a family favorite since the first time I made it in '99. On the grill or in the oven, it's so fast and so delicious. I serve it with warm flour or corn tortillas, grated cheddar cheese, avocado and lastly, sour cream (or lowfat plain yogurt)to cool down the spiciness of the sauce. I recently this served at a progressive dinner party for 40 people and received rave reviews. I joke it's my favorite recipe because it has only three ingredients and requires only three of each!

Not a good receipe. Very bland.

I marinated the meat overnight, I used olive oil to get a clingy sauce. It was great, very spicy. I think next time I will add more honey, though to get a sweeter flavor. I served the dish with brownrice and black beans and corn. The rice was bland, but if It had been spicy the meal would have been gross. The mild rice perfectly balanced the dish. I will make it again and again, but make a double batch. One pork loin for the meal and one for leftovers. Would be great shredded in tacos or in a sandwich.

This marinade is absolutely amazing-i have used it on the pork and just tried it on london broil-both got many compliments and will definetely be made again. With both meats i marinated them in a ziploc bag over night,and grilled them,pork 12-15min,beef16-18min. I served the pork with spanish rice, and the london broil with a southwestern salad and fruit-alll of these sides were very complimentary.

I don't rate anything a four, because I don't think there is anything that is beyond compare. This, however, is very good. I've made it twice, both times on the grill. I simply blend the marinade ingredients, adding a little olive oil, and put it into a ziploc bag with the meat. I probably marinade about 8 hours or so. Sear over the coals, then move off the coals and finish with closed grill until up to temp (instant read thermometer!). Great for a simple meal with tortillas, and just as good dressed up for company. Many compliments on this one--even the kids eat it. I may try it in the oven this winter (hard to grill in this part of the country then), but it really strikes me as a grill thing!

This dish is delicious, quick, and extremely easy to make with very few ingredients. I've made it twice so far. The first time, I roasted it in the oven as recommended in the recipe. It was pretty good, but I thought it tasted a little... I don't know, somehow pot-roasty, and I wasn't too crazy about that. So, when we had a potluck at work, I decided to make it again, but I grilled it this time after marinating it for twenty-four hours and it was infinitely better. Everyone at work raved about it. I thought it wasn't nearly as spicy cooked this way, but that was good because it made it more palatable to people who can't handle really spicy foods, but left it spicy enough to satisfy those of us who can. I will definitely cook it this way from now on. I don't think the ingredients need to be tinkered with at all, everything balances perfectly.

This was an extremely easy and quick recepie. Everyone loved it including the ones that don't normally choose a spicy dish. Definately worth the effort!

This *easy* recipe is for anyone who likes the combination of hot and sweet. I made only one 3/4 pound tenderloin, but the whole sauce recipe, reserving half to drizzle over the pork on the plate. For those who'd like a little less spice, be sure to seed the chipotles before pureeing.

The key here is perfect timing on the meat. It's a tasty way of serving pork and nothing to it.

This recipe has a strong, wonderful smoky flavour. You have to like all these ingredients before you will enjoy this recipe. My mother in law and teenagers did not care for this (found it too spicy) and picked off all the outsides of the pork before they would eat it. I would, however, serve it to friends (they seem have the same tastes as we do!). I also added 2T olive oil and marinated it for 24 hours. Wonderful and easy!

Great, simple recipe. It's so easy. Great for a weekday or if you just don't feel like doing hours of prep. I also marinated it. I used 4 TBS honey, 3 TBS olive oil, 5 garlic cloves and chipotles. Marinated for 6 hours (made it in the morning). I kept some of the marinade aside to baste during roasting and flipped it over half way through so that each side would be well basted. Excellent. My husband loves it! It's in my permanent recipe book.

We loved this recipe. We used 3 chipotles, 5 garlic cloves, 4 tablespoons of honey and 2 tablespoones of olive oil and marinated for about 1.5 hours. The flavor was excellent with a little kick.

This so simple and delicious. The first time I made it did seem searingly hot. Now, instead of brushing on the sauce, I marinate the pork for an hour or two in a freezer bag. I add about 3 T olive oil, so the sauce spreads/clings better (add salt too). This method seems to tone down the fire and bring the honey-garlic flavors out more.

2 forks for taste but for ease of preparation I have to give this 3 forks. To increase the flavor quotient next time I make this I will marinate the pork in the sauce for several hours or even overnight before cooking.

Excellent, tasty recipe. Have made it four times for guests, each time to rave reviews. The only changes I have made were upping the cooking time by 5-10 minutes and adding a pinch of cayenne pepper to pep it up a bit (not recommended for the weak of palate, however). I also used four chipotles instead of three (I use the remainder in my Ranch-bean recipe). The last time I made it, I used freshly roasted chipotles and some chipotle sauce instead of the canned version. Living in a state whose motto is the question "Red or green?," I am fully aware of the fact that peppers are not used solely for the "heat" effect, but rather as a flavor enhancer. Those who prefer blandness should simply use fewer chipotles.

Three chilis was just too hot. Slicing very thin helped, but I still didn't think it was suitable for company. And, as I've written on this site before, I always cut the chili open and scrape out the seeds. Does everyone? Another explanation for the mixed reviews may be that different brands of canned chipotles have different heat levels. Or maybe they can simply vary from can to can or chili to chili? In any case you may want to taste a bit of the glaze first. If I ever make a variation again, I'd probably add some lime or orange juice too.

Excellent taste, tender meat. I love it when we rate recipes but change everything! But this time I used a 2# boneless pork sirloin roast seasoned with salt; seared it on indirect grill then brushed it with the marinade once it reached 120 removed at 140. I upped the garlic and used the 3 chiles. It's spicy but so-o-o very good.

I loved this recipe! I agree with the review from Washington; I think the review with the sauce which includes cream cheese and beef broth is a little peculiar.

Rating: 3
It does take some manipulation to get this one right. I decreased to one pepper and increased the other ingredients somewhat. The end result was a suitable concoction, but it was still on the spicy side. The cooking time does need to be increase unless you are fond of rare pork.

Terrible! I agree with the reviewer who said it was unbearably spicy--and I _do_ eat spicy food normally. Plus, my 1.5 lb tenderloin took 40 minutes to cook at that temperature, not 20, and the drippings in the pan kept burning so I'd have to add water to it. Just an awful recipe--the only flavor is HOT. I tried to make it better by increasing the paste by 1/3 at the beginning and adding the extra 1/3 recipe of paste to carmelized onions, to make a sauce; I added about a half a cup of port and 1/2 a cup beef broth, cooked it all down, and then added 2 oz cream cheese to cut the heat and make the sauce creamy. The sauce, which wasn't even part of the original recipe, was the only halfway decent part of this dish.

If you're looking for a recipe worthy of your tenderloin, this is DEFINITLY one! Fire and sweetness was in perfect balance. Short on time? No problem. As a personal chef looking to expand my menus, I will most certainly add this to my repertoire. I served this with a typical spanish rice, corn and black bean salsa, and cooled down with a dessert of bananas with rum caramel over vanilla icecream. A keeper.

Delicious meal, very easy to make. I did not have the chilis in adobo so I soaked the chipolte chilis in apple cider vinegar, then blened the chilis with apple cider vinegar and fresh cilantro in the food processor to make a paste then added the remainder of the ingredients. I served the pork tenderloin with garlic mashed potatos. I memorable meal.
