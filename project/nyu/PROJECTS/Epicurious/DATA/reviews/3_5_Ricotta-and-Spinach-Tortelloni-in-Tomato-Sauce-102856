Fairly good recipe, but I think it benefits from some basic improvements: 1 - brush wonton wrappers with egg, rather than water. Not one fell apart. Two mins boil -- at most. 2 - wilt spinach by dousing briefly in boiling water then spin or squeeze dry. 3 - add an egg yolk to the cheese/spinach mixture for binding. 4 - the addition of a few chopped basil leaves was an excellent suggestion from Penfield cook -- thanks. Also, try piping the filling using a small plastic bag with a *tiny* bit of the corner snipped out. Much faster. Really delicious. Froze the remainder in a plastic box, sprinkling each layer with semolina.

This was fabulous - my husband couldn't believe I didn't get some "chef" to make it... I did use wonton wrappers b/c I don't have a pasta maker (yet), but I will make my own soon - they did hold together beautifully though, and I used lite ricotta (i know, never vere from a recipe the first time) - the filling was smooth, creamy, and delicious - the nutmeg is a must, and use fresh grated if you can...

This dish was excellent, but when I made it the second time, I made my own fresh pasta and the tortelloni held together better, and the flavor was more genuine. I also added a few small chopped basil leaves to the cheese mixture for a bit more flavor. I would definitely make this recipe again.
