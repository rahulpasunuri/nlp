I Loved this recipe, I used MacIntosh and Grannysmith apples with this recipe, this is the best tasting apple-butter I have ever had.

This made great gifts for the holidays paired with small loaves of pumpkin bread. I did have to cook this about 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for, but it turned out great and I love the clove flavoring.

This is delicious - I made 2 batches and will definitely make it again. Cooking longer just enhances the flavor.
