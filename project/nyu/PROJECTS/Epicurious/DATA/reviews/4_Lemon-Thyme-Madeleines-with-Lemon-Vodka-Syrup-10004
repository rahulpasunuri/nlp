I made these for an Easter Egg Hunt and dinner and everyone raved! Tweaked the order of addition for the ingredients to follow traditional madeleine preparation - blended rind & thyme with the sugar until it was moistened, added the butter (melted) last, and let the batter rest for 24 hrs....they were perfect and will make these often!!

I am in the restaurant buisness and I bake everyday. These Lemon Madeleines were very good in my rating. But what really put them over the top was when I served them with a rich Lemon Curd that was mixed with a little fresh whipped cream. The result was a very light yellow lemon cream. I also topped that all off with some small sugared strawberry chunks. I won many an accolade for an incredibly easy and lite / elegant dessert. Muy Bueno!
