This turned out really well. A few tricks for me: I drained the cherries a few times to ensure well- drained. Also, I used a 9 1/2 inch pie dish (Pyrex) and I did not have any bubbling over issues--it was a well-packed pie and bubbly and golden when done baking. For the crumble, I cubed the butter and then stuck it in the freezer while I was working on the rest of the prep. Then I worked it into the dry mix. I did use the cherries from Trader Joe's as I couldn't find these kind of cherries anywhere else. And the bourbon packs the right amount of delicious richness to the cherry gravy. Yumm-O! I don't think my friends or family will let me try a different cherry pie recipe. This is boozy baking at its best...

Oops, I lied. It was a 10-ounce jar of lingon berries, not marion berries, and I used whiskey, not brandy. Sorry, but boy was this a good pie.

I hate it when people change the recipe and then complain about it, but . . . this pie was absolutely delicious and incredibly easy to make. I took to heart the comments about too much filling, so I used two 15 oz. cans of sour cherries in water, plus an 8-ounce jar of marionberries, which was sweetened. I added about a half cup sugar, and instead of bourbon, I used brandy. It all fit beautifully in a 9-inch pie pan. I made the crumble to recipe and the amount seemed just right (I did it in the food processor, after using it to make the pie crust). Wow! Good stuff.

This recipe makes a very large deep dish pie. I reduced the amount of cherries by substituting one can in for one jar and it was still overflowing even after the cherries cooked down. The pie was a huge hit and will be my go-to recipe for cherry pie now.

I used fresh cherries and soaked them in cherry bourbon for several hours before baking. I doubled the recipe for two deep dish pies. This is our new favorite cherry pie recipe.

This recipe made enough filling for two deep-dish pies -- and they both bubbled over. I think the filling needs to be cut by at least 1/3 (and up to 1/2) if you only want one pie. Or increase the amount of crumble topping and make two. We liked it, though, just not as much as we like regular cherry pie.
