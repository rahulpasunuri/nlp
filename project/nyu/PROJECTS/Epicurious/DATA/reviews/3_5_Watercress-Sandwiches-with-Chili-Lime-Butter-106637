Delicious. But better with a little garlic salt thrown in. Also i made some with just the watercress; and some with watercress, cucumbers and sprouts.

I had this sandwich a few weeks back. It was so good, that it was the first thing that popped into my mind when I saw some leftover watercress in the kitchen. So I had another sandwich tonight. This might be a regular for the season!
