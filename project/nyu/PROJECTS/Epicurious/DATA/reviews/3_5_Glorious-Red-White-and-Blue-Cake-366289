The red velvet portion of this cake was a real disappointment. This is the oiliest cake, very unappealing. Yes, it was light and tender, but just couldn't get past how oily my fingers were when I touched it, or the residual in the pan. The ration of 1 c oil plus 1/2 cup butter AND sour cream (vs buttermilk most recipes use) to only 2.5 cups SIFTED CAKE flour... As I learned in pastry school, if it doesn't mesh with your intuition and what your training has taught you, it probably is for a reason...lesson learned. I might try tweaking the recipe, not sure.

This cake was spectacular! Being Canadian I omitted the blueberries and piled on strawberries and raspberries to make for Canada day. The cake is light and fluffy - almost a box cake texture - the icing soft and sweet but not too sweet. This may become a Canada day tradition at our house - DELISH!

Fantastic recipe..BUT AND I CAUTION... cut the rounded side of each layer so they are flat on both sides..It's a big cake and the third layer split on me.. so make em flat. I did not find the lemon to compete w/ the choc. layers at all.. but next time I will try almond extract for the white layer...it's worth the time.. and makes a wonderful statement!

points to this one for coming out almost exactly like the picture! very satisfying presentation. my platter was bigger than my cake and had a lip on it, so i piled the extra berries around the base of the cake, which looked great. the only thing that made this less than perfect for me was that even having added some extra red food coloring, my red layers came out reddish brown, not as pictured. i'll do 2 bottles in the future. other than the extra food coloring, i made this exactly according to directions. the cake recipes were excellent. i think because of the sour cream and oil, they had a nice texture - dense, held together well, even though i was concerned i might have overbaked the red velvet. (i wonder if those who note the cake tended to fall apart might have done better leaving it in the oven a couple minutes longer.) the assembly worked beautifully. i found that though the icing was quite soft, after i had chilled the crumb-coated cake well, the second layer of frosting stuck to the colder part quite easily. as for the recipe making tons of extra icing - i measured out a cup each for in between the two layers, and while there was perhaps 3/4 cup left over after i felt the cake was covered... i took it as a sign from the Cake Gods to pile it on thicker. in the end, when we cut the cake, it seemed just right to me. and as for the review saying this is a "caloric bomb".... if you can't enjoy a big beautiful slice of real, non-diet cake on America's birthday, when can ya? just make it a modest slice, and pile lots of those berries on your plate. they are very high in fiber and antioxidants. ;^}

This is by far the best cake of its' kind that I have ever made. It was nice and moist and the flavors were out of this world! I didn't make any alterations to the recipe at all. My friends were super impressed. I'm sure yours will be too! :)

I wanted something that would "pop" for July 4. Everyone loves Red Velvet so what better was there to make? A beautiful presentation that drew ooh's and aah's from everyone. After reading the reviews I too chose the Mascarpone Cream Cheese frosting on this site with the Red Velvet cupcakes since I had a few tubs laying around. Very light delicate frosting making a great cake.

My daughter and I made this cake for our Fourth of July dessert. It was excellent. Not only did it look great it tasted just as good. We used raspberries instead of strawberries. I would definitely make it again!!

Made the recipe almost exactly as is, cutting back a tad on the sugar. Turned out perfect and looking very elegant! It is huge so a lot of happy eaters. BEWARE: This cake is not heart, health or hip friendly!

This recipe seemed fairly straight forward at first, a little bit hard to assemble if all 3 cakes do not come out of the oven the exact same shape. Very crumbly, therefor I found it hard to work with

I made this cake last year for a Fourth celebration. It was a big hit so I'm making it again this year.

Made the cake layers exactly. Loved the red cake, but the white layer was as little dry and the lemon flavoring didn't seem to go with the red cake. Topped w/ 1 1/2 recipe mascarone cream cheese icing (epicurious red velvet cupcakes w/mascarpone). Frosting was the best! Cut cake layers in heart shape and topped w/strawberries. Very, very pretty.

I didn't rate this recipe because I made a ton of adjustments. I just made this cake into cupcakes and after cross-referencing a dozen recipes I wanted to share my changes because these cupcakes came out perfectly. Perfectly. Here are my adjustments: 3 T cocoa powder, 1 t salt, (no buttermilk) 1 cup of sour cream, 2.5 oz red color and 1 T vinegar. Baking time: 18 min. Made 25 cupcakes.

Awesome Cake! I added an extra bottle of coloring when I saw that it wasnt coming out red enough. But the cake came out well for me and didnt fall part and the sour creame added a nice flavor to the cake. It was a cut above the rest!

This cake is truly delicious however it's a real caloric bomb and when my mum made it turned out to be a glorious brown not red. Also, it was really hard to move the cake layers because the cake fell apart easily. I would make it again but with a little improvisation.

I am a recent graduate of college and I am not that good at making anything. But these directions were great! They were easy to follow and very concise. My family loved the cake and said it was better than a cake you would buy at a bakery. I would definately make this again! It was awesome!

A great cake. The Wow factor was off the charts and what was really great was how great the cake layers tasted by themselves. Awesome!

I loved the look of this cake enough to take it to our remote cabin for the Fourth, but had to put it through considerable abuse to get it there, and it held up like a champ. I made only the red velvet layers and froze them in the pans for transport. The frosting was too soft so I added more powdered sugar (duh) and kept it cold. The flavor was num! Impressed everyone, and they finished it off for breakfast.

Before making this, I read a few reviews that said the icing was runny. I did not have this problem at all - despite the heat. I have no idea what the difference was when I made it, but if the butter and/or cream cheese were melted instead of just softened, I imagine that would create problems. Just a thought. That aside, this cake was not only delicious but looked incredible. My whole family was absolutely blown away, and I would absolutely make it again. The instructions were clear and I followed them exactly, and ended up with a beautiful, delicious cake.

If I based my rating on looks alone, I would give 4 forks for sure! Beautiful cake that makes a great presentation. Cake was not difficult to make and wasn't as time-consuming as I thought it might be. You can cut back on the frosting ingredients as I had a ton of frosting left over. The cake was good, but not as moist as I had hoped. I liked the lemon flavor in the white layer, but it didn't compliment the red velvet so much. Compliments will be flying if you make this cake for guests as it really is a pretty cake. I will definately make again, but will probably make my white almond sour creme cake for the center layer.

Glorious indeed! This cake was so beautiful and SO good. It's a real showstopper. It is time consuming, though. No one step is difficult, it's just that the whole undertaking stretched out over a pretty full two days in my case. However, it was well worth it. Will make again.

I did not like this recipe- in particular the frosting, which tasted like fake/highly processed frosting you find at convenience stores. The cake was good and moist, but the frosting just ruined it for me.

Rating: 3
I give it three forks because it was delicious BUT it was also very expensive and time consuming to make. The berries alone cost almost $10 then add in a whole bottle of food coloring at $4 all that butter and cream cheese--this is a very expensive cake.

Absolutely divine dessert!!! Had no problem with the icing. Came out very white and nice and firm. I used the clear vanilla extract to keep it nice and white. I also put a crumb coat on the night before and let it sit in fridge overnight. I put on the final coat the next morning and it came out perfect!

beautiful cake and a big hit at my 4th of July dinner party. No problem with the icing. I whipped on high with the mixer for a long time and it was light, fluffy and perfect. I used real cream cheese and real butter- no subs or reduced fat versions.

I made this cake for Canada Day and it was a hit, everyone loved it, turned out perfect. The icing is a little runny, after putting on one layer, pop it in the fridge to set before adding another layer, otherwise - I would make it again, the lemon flavor in the frosting was a nice touch

Followed the recipe exactly. 4 forks for the cake. First time making red velvet and it is amazing. However 1 fork for the frosting. I have a tub of yellow-tinged butter cream SOUP in the fridge. Nobody else has commented on the frosting, so maybe it's me. But a sad waste of ingredients. I added 2 extra cups of powdered sugar after removing one cup of the sloppy goo, and still not working. Even if it thickens overnight, it's not a bright and beautiful white like in the picture.

I made this cake for a Canada Day Party- just Red and White. It was spectacular. I made it just as the recipe stated. If you want the red velvet redder you need a second bottle of coloring. I have been getting phone calls all day complimenting me on the cake.

Very delicious and delectable looking cake. In decorating I placed a variety of the fruit in the center of the cake as well as roung the outer edge of the top of the cake and around the base of the cake. This guaranteed everyone had fruit. I am an avid baker and am accustomed to using recipes far more intricate then this so I didn't think it was that much of a big deal. Flavor and presentation is everything to me. How long it takes doesn't really enter into the picture for me.

This would be great for Canada Day too! Just decorate with strawberries on top to keep it red and white. I agree it is a lot of work but worth it.

I made this cake over the weekend for my mother's birthday party and it was a hit. It is a large moist cake that holds the sufficient amount of cream cheese frosting well. I decorated the top in concentric circles with strawberries, raspberries and blackberries and infilled with blueberries. The berries were sweet and complimentary in flavor to the rest of the cake. But regardless, of what the description says it still does take a good bit of time since there are different colored layers and kitchen ware can not be interchanged without cleaning (i.e. sifter, bowl).
