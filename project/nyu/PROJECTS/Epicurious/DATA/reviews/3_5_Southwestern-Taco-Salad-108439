I am really surprised by how good this little salad is. I served it over spinach and grilled tortillas. My husband, who rarely comments on new recipes, said he really liked this one.

We absolutely loved this salad. I cubed and sauteed raw turkey. I bought both refried beans and seasoned black beans. We added shredded lettuce, chopped tomato, jack cheese, salsa and sour cream. It was so filling! We had it again for lunch the next day. I mixed the beans together and that worked great.

The dressing is what makes this, and the dressing is excellent. It made more than enough, so I added a can of black beans, plus an extra avocado to the salad, and it turned out perfect! Dressing is a little on the spicy side, but I love it.

I added jicama and corn, which added nice cruch and flavor. Hardly any leftover with just 2 people eating, but just enough left for me to enjoy for lunch!

I added black beans on bottom, and shredded cheese and sour cream on top, it was delicious. Very easy to make and the chipotle peppers gave it a smoky tex-mex taste!

Very good and Southwesterny. I used less oil than called for (and will use even less the next time, it's just not needed), and used whole wheat tortillas and made wraps. Making wraps it was very "not messy" at all to eat. I added the black beans to the mix, and sprinkled a bit of shredded lettuce and low fat cheese on to each wrap before I rolled...no sour cream or salsa....it's really quite the healthy meal and a great use for that leftover turkey.

Very nice use of leftover roast chicken as well. Nice flavors. I will definitely make this again.

I don't know why the cook below hated this recipe so much... It's light, flavorful and spicy, and perfect for hot weather. Can be made as a taco salad with tortilla chips as well, or rolled up as a burrito. I make this all the time.

Yuck Yuck Yuck! Too much oil and not enough flavor. I threw away the chili and turkey mixture. Don't waste time or money on this one!
