I cooked this as written and the black bass was tender, flaky and delicious. This could easily be a company dish with a little tweaking of the pan juices, such as the addition of a little white wine and lemon zest.

i didn't think this would be that great but the reviews were so good so i threw it together one night and wow! so simple and light tasting. and very pretty with the cukes on top. i used striped bass that the shop cleaned for me (we only found two bones) and an all-clad metal saute pan so the skin stuck to the pan. this is a keeper for a weeknight when you have some good fish and want a light meal.

The dish was very good. I used half ghee and half garlic olive oil for cooking. Used lemon zest with the dill and one slice of lemon per portion on top of the fish for flavor and esthetics. I will surely make this time and again.

This was so easy and very tasty! Used local caught sea bass, and went easy on the butter. This is a keeper and will go into regular rotation!! Perfect for a weeknight!

I thought this was good, but I think that there are better recipes out there. If I make it again, I wouldn't use sea bass because of the bones (even at the specialty shop, they said that they couldn't remove them for me because of the shape). I think I was expecting a little more after reading the reviews, but it was good...and easy too!

I have made this twice-once with Sea Bass and once with Halibut. Both times it was outstanding. Cooking cucumbers like this turns them into something different and rich and totally delicious. It is truly easy and elegant. A great recipe, going in my all time favorite file!

The first time I made this recipe, I agree it was easy and it was great. However, the recipe was a little too buttery. I substituted some olive oil for butter and added a little white chardonnay. Still easy and delicious with the changes.

Absolutely outstanding. I used my mandolin to slice the cucumber, and like the previous review I used one beautiful fresh-caught big fillet of striped bass that I cooked for 15 minutes. My only alteration was to deglaze the pan with a splash of white wine and reduce for 1 minute. Easy, delicious, and fun!

This is truly delicious and easy. I used one big bass fillet and cooked it for about 15 minutes. So easy and it received rave reviews from the pickiest eater I know.

This was very good and simple to make -- almost fool proof. Next time I will make a cream sauce to serve with it, as the pan drippings didn't have quite enough flavor.

This deserves four forks for its flavor AND its ease. It's simple, yet elegant. The only thing I added was some lemon slices . I used haddock as well, and it was delicious.

This was excellent. Delicious, quick, and easy. The cucumber slices were buttery, the fish was flavorful. I did everything up to the cooking and put it in the fridge for a few hours because we had to go out and wanted dinner quickly upon returning home. We had to cook it longer, about 15 minutes (fillets were also pretty thick), but it came out excellent. So 4 forks for really easy, prepare ahead, but still looks and tastes great.

I am actually giving this recipe four stars because is it SO delicious - we will make this one again and again. Couldn't get bass but haddock was perfect.
