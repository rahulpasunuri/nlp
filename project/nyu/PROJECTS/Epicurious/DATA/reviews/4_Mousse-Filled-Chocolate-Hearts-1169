This isn't one of the better mousse recipes I've seen on epicurious. It's a lot of work and turns out quite a bit too dense. I would echo the other reviewer's suggestion to add one or even two cups of whipped cream to lighten it up. Also, definitely serve it at room temperature, as others have mentioned. I would recommend the mousse recipe is in the Layered Mocha Cream Torte if you're looking for something to substitute.

Delicious! After reading a few other reviews, I decided not to bother making the sandwiches -- instead, I cut very small hearts to sprinkle on top of the mousse in parfait glasses. Much easier, and just as pretty. The chocolate flavour is very rich, and the mousse is not overpoweringly sweet. A definite keeper!

Very impressive dessert! The mousse was especially decadent and delicately textured. I used very high quality chocolate for this recipe (Scharffen Berger) and that made a big difference. I'll be adding this recipe to my collection of tried and true favorites!

How do you eat these things? Even after letting them sit out the chocolate was still to firm to allow you to take a bite without the inside squishing out.The "mousse" stuff was kind of cake like, as was said by another reviewer, but turned out great after adding another cup or two of sweetened whipped cream.I ended up serving the mousse in a parfait glass layered and topped with the hearts.Very romantic on Valentines Day.

Thanks for the tip of good organization. It did help with the mousse. I served right out to the refrigerator because it said "serve cold" and next time I will let it sit just a bit before serving because the chocolate hearts were too hard for guests--just like a candy bar when you first take it out of refrigerator. I cut a few smaller hearts out of the leftover chocolates, and scattered on plates along with raspberries.

This was awesome. The trick to the mousse is the temperature. You have to let the corn syrup reach the right temperature and then add it while it's still boiling to the egg whites. Next time I make it I will beat the egg whites first and then do the syrup becuase I had to go back and start over. By the time the white are beaten, the syrup has already cooled too much. It's not too difficult if you get all the ingredients organized first and its definitely worth it!

This was a fun recipe to make. The mousse turned out a bit weird after refrigeration, almost cake like, it was good, but next time I will try a more traditional mousse recipe (without the corn syrup). Despite having a bottle of corn syrup I don't know what to do with, this was a great dessert to share with friends and loved ones!

The first time I made this, it took some time, but it gets faster each time I make it. If you are organized, with everything "mise en place", it will come out perfect every time. Try making miniatures for a shower or christening--a huge hit! P.S. everything can be made 2 days in advance, with the assembly done the morning of, and the garnish just before serving. The presentation is just fabulous-your guests will be awestruck!

Not an easy recipe to make but the results are well worth the trouble!!
