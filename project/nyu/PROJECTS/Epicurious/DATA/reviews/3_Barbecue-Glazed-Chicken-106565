Follow this recipe for the grilling instructions, but make the BBQ sauce from the Barefoot Contessa that a previous reviewer was kind enough to share -- it's awesome! (the 3 forks is for the grilling instructions - I'd give the Contessa 4 forks for her BBQ sauce)

Very nice indeed. Toi any other UK cooks, if you can't find A1 sauce, use a mixture of HP and ketchup (just using straight HP is too fruity). I pepped this up with a couple of shakes of hot sauce. I haven't tried the Ina Garten recipe yet but thanks to the person who posted it!

While I'm not really reviewing this recipe (because I made and used the Ina Garten recipe from A Cook from NYC (06/21/02)), I can say that the grilling instructions in the recipe made all the difference. Between the I.G. sauce and this method the chicken was out of this world, really perfect. It's a bit time consuming but I guess you can't rush great BBQ.

Ditto re the comments made by A Cook from Seattle. The Ina recipe rocks.

My 6-year-old loved this so much that he ate the sauce alone by the spoonful. Makes a great chicken!

I almost tried this recipe but switched to the Ina Garten sauce due to it's rave reviews. Now I have to add my own. Everyone loved it. We had it on chicken one night and tofu the next and I can't wait to have it on something else. I still have plenty left. Thanks NYC.

Just wanted to add my thanks to NYC for the Ina Garten recipe. That was one of the rare truly nice postings of all I've just read.

I have not tried Ina Garten's bbq sauce, but my 15 minute sauce has spoiled me and it really is that easy: 1/4C each of brown sugar and ketchup, 2Tbs each of spicy mustard, molasses, and cider vinegar, 2 garlic cloves chopped, and hot sauce to taste. Bring to a boil and let simmer 15 minutes. That's all. To the American living in Germany: I lived in southern Spain for 2 years. You can't get much more remote and I could find ready-made stuff (even Old El Paso!) at the local superstore, Pryca. It seems to me "France" thinks they are too good for American pre-packaged things.

I made this recipe with Bobby Flay's Mesa BBQ sauce (you can find the recipe on www.foodtv.com) and it was pretty good. Bobby Flay's recipe is definitely the best BBQ sauce recipe that I have tried so far. The ingredients are actually almost identical to the ones here. But as an Ina Garten fan, I will try that one too! As for all of the comments about the cook in France: I am an American living in Germany and, unless you know exactly what you are looking for and where to go, it can be pretty difficult to get the pre-made ingredients that are so easy to find in the US. As a "foodie," it was one of the hardest things for me to adjust to here. So, go easy on the French reviewer!

Well, people! I'm critiquing Ina Garten's bbq sauce. Look out Kirkland's Dressing! I tried it--it's spicy, it's sweet, it's good! On anything, I would guess! Including this chicken. Oh! And it's "Don't get your shorts in a bundle!" or "Don't get your panty hose in a twist! :)

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. Personally I wasn't a big fan of the shallots, I thought it overwhelmed the flavor too much. If I were to make it again I would cut back on the shallots or omit it entirely. I would also cut back on the vinegar. I tend to prefer a sweeter sauce and the onions and vinegar gave me heartburn. lol. Just a bit too acidic for my taste.

I have not made this recipe, I just want to thank the Cook from NYC for the Oma Garten recipe. Since I don't store bottled sauces this was much appreciated, and because of this, I cannot disagree with the writer from France. To the others, it really IS "Knickers in a Twist". Thanks Epicurious for your many, many fine offerings - all that I've used have been highly successful. t

Add horseradish to the sauce if you like it tangy. For the french "chef" if it wasn't for us pre-packaged Americans, you'd be speaking german in your fancy markets!

My family liked the BBQ Sauce but I did not think it was significantly better than commercial sauces I have had. Therefore, given the time involved making it, I do'nt think I would make it again.(Too many other recipes to try.) One could reduce the time by prepping the sauce in a food processor.

To Atlanta, No need for you to go out and buy the cookbook for one recipe. Here is the famous Barefoot Contessa barbecue sauce recipe by Ina Garten. 1-1/2 cups chopped yellow onion, 1 T. minced garlic, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1 cup tomato paste (l0 oz.), 1 cup cider vinegar, 1 cup honey, 1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce, 1 cup Dijon mustard, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1 cup hoisin sauce, 2 T. chilli powder, 1 T. ground cumin, 1/2 T. crushed red pepper flakes. In a large saucepan on low heat, saute the onions and garlic with the vegetable oil for 10 to 15 minutes until the onions are translucent but not browned. Add the tomato paste, vinegar, honey, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, soy sauce, hoisin sauce, chili powder, cumin, and red pepper flakes. Simmer uncovered on low heat for 30 minutes. Use immediately or store in the refrigerator.

Good flavor, but not amazing enough to make regularly. To the "chef" from France: in addition to pre-packaged sauces, we have a variety of fresh markets that carry fresh ingredients. You act as if the dirty French are the only ones with open air markets. Get off your high horse.

With all due respect to our friends from France, there must be some sort of bottled steak sauce available, if only from across the pond in England. HP makes a couple of different steak sauces, and anything tomato sauce based should work well here. (HP sauces are a little fruity, however). I would recommend, however, using A-1 if you can find it--it has a unique combination of raisins, orange and vinegar tang to it that is quite good. I made this recipe with A-1 Bold and Spicy (contains Tabasco) and it gave it a good kick.

Y'all, I'm just so pleased to save this recipe to my box! BUT where is the Coke cola and hickory smoke flavouring that a good BBQ sauce must have??? I am interested in the Countess Ina Garten recipe--where might I find it? Thank you Epicurious gods for letting me once again save to my recipebox--life IS good!

It seems as thought the spices should be self applied, (as suggested). Has anyone actually applied this method to the sauce instead of using A1? I have a fabulous spice blend that seems made for this (I use it with a honey and wine mixture, but wonder how much it would throw off the texture, and if the change might be welcome.

This recipe was fine - nothing to get too excited about....but more than acceptable - as an aside, a really wonderful barbecue sauce I make and keeps for quite a while in the fridge is Ina Garten's Barefoot Contessa's recipe...lots of ingredients go into it, but it's very easy to make and is exceptional!!!

I would make this recipe again and WOULD AND CAN MAKE my own BBQ sauce. But for convenience a bottled sauce would be best - considering the small amount used. What is up with dude from Colorado...IGNORANT AND RUDE. He says he is a chef....hmmmm got to wonder about that considering his insults to the French. At least the French can cook.

Recipe: Not great, but not bad. Then again, I think I'd eat elephant droppimgs if they were charcoal grilled ;) And hey, Kimberly: If you think the web is "just for fun," MAN are you ever missing out!

I added three diced and seeded jalapeno peppers for a kick - yumm-ee! And not to beat a dead horse but . . . no one's panties are in a . . . twist?

I made the recipe exactly as written and found it to be very so-so. It did not thicken when it had cooled down, which meant that very little of the sauce stayed on the chicken when I basted it. I will say that the flavour of the sauce was okay.

This is a wonderful recipe. I added a bit of liquid smoke as well, which gave it a bit more depth. Panties in a wad, knickers in a bunch. I have spoken.

Quick sauce that beats most you'll find bottled at the store. A must: perk it up with a good dose of hot sauce and a few dashes of liquid smoke!
