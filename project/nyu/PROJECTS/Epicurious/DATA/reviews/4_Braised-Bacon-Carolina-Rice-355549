I though this was not bad, but my husband really didn't like the tomato or the celery in this recipe. we also disagreed on the texture - I liked the creamier texture (we usually have dry fluffy rice), but he din't like it. I might make this again (without the celery or tomato juice), because you can't go wrong with the combination of bacon and onions! but it wouldn't be the same recipe.

Definitely my go-to potluck recipe. Fairly dependable and always received with rave reviews. A few alterations that I make: - double the amount of rice - halve the amount of chicken broth (I add two cups of water instead) - add about 8oz of crushed tomatoes instead of tomato juice (never seem to have tomato juice in the house and always have some crushed tomatoes left from pasta sauce. Also, this seems to make it just a bit juicier and the crushed tomatoes absorb the spices well). Otherwise, just do as is and have a lovely, easily scalable meal!

I screwed up and put an entire 12 oz package of bacon I had on hand, which happened to be hickory smoked. I knew it would be salty, so I left out that salt, and I left out the butter. Anyway, due to my bacon error, the dish was too salty and rich. I LOVED the flavor and the smell of it simmering, it was just a bit overpowered by the amount of bacon I used. I read the recipe and 1 1/2 lbs. of bacon... what a gomer. I will try it again for sure.

I only had jasime rice and I found that a full 4 cups of broth for one cup of rice left my rice a little too wet and soggy. So next time I'll use less. Although it ended up being absolutely fabulous the next day fried up like pancakes!!! In fact, no modifications I'll just always fry it up after!

A really great recipe. Very easy to make with a ton of flavor. The kids loved it.It was a little spicy so I will probably use a little less cayenne next time. A little cracked pepper at the end worked well also (but once again remember that it's already a little spicy).

I did this recipe with the Gold rice I bought on line. It was great. I cooked both with chicken and low salt beef broth. I like the beef but it could be a little salty for some. I served it with boneless beef short ribs following Danial Baloud recipe obtained from this site. I placed the beef on top of the rice and sprinkled the reduction over everything. I added some shrimp grilled in garlic butter around the edge of the plate. Did for a party of 20 as a sit down dinner and was pretty easy. Could do a lot ahead of time.

I've made this several times now using long grain white, brown rice or leftover rice. Each time it's an easy and tasty dish that pleases. The chopped celery leaves and paprika add a lot to the flavor, don't skip either. This is exactly what I look for in a recipe -- simple to do, uses ingredients I almost always have on hand, and appeals to a broad range of palates. It doesn't have to be complicated or exotic to be just plain good.

Pretty good stuff, nicely flavored. Was a little mushy for my taste. I used brown rice and I don't know if "Carolina" rice cooks differently. I'll make it again with maybe a bit less liquid.

This is a keeper. I thought it would be more of a modern twist to the traditional risotto I grew up with, but was surprised at how light yet warming the dish was. Plus it was relatively quick - this would make a nice week night meal.

This was OK but nothing special. I made as directed except I used basmati rice.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It is surprisingly tasty and easy to make. The addition of celery really adds to the recipe's taste. And it works well with long grain rice.

I have sent a complaint about the SPAM to the webmaster. As to the recipe, I'm interested in any more comments about the texture as made from the recipe, because the photo makes me think it's similar to risotto. I haven't had a chance to try the recipe yet.

Very good recipe. I made it tonight for dinner. I used regular long grain rice, and I made the dish in my 6 cup rice cooker. I only used 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth, and it was perfect. I would like to try this again with the Carolina rice, so I ordered some from http://www.carolinaplantationrice.com

Excellent recipe. Didn't have all the exact ingredients, but still came out very good. Too bad the scum bag spammers can't control themselves!

Easy dinner. Used regular long grain rice and hickory smoked bacon. Didn't add an extra salt. Might be nice with some chunks of smokey ham to make it a little more substantial. The house smelled nice and smokey.
