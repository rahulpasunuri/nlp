Not alot of flavour, quite bland. I thought that the sherry would add a bit of a punch, but this recipe lacked flavour. Other than adding a can of diced tomatoes, I followed the recipe to the letter. I will not be making again. This recipe also makes a huge amount of soup, and took a very long time to cook. In the end, it totally lacked flavour.

The best soup on this website. I tried the Ann Arbor one too and this is definitely better. I made mushroom stock from leftover stems and used it instead of water, but I did add the prescribed amount of beef stock. I agree the soup won't be a favorite if you are looking for barley flavor, but for me, it's about the mushrooms. A money saving tip: if you have an Oriental store nearby, but the shiitakes (or equivalent Chinese brown mushrooms) there instead of the regular supermarket...you'll save a lot.

I used the delicious mushroom stock from Deborah Madison's "Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone" instead of chicken or beef. I added a little more soy sauce. The aromas are really great. Lovely soup!

This was at best OK. I was looking for soup with more of a barley flavor, and this was very strongly mushroom-flavored.

This is a delicious and easy soup. I use whatever mushrooms I have on hand. This time it was 1 lb. button mushrooms, 1 lb. chopped portobello, and 1/2 oz. dried oyster mushrooms. I only use 2 carrots and dice them small, and substitute veggie broth for chicken broth to make it vegetarian. Excellent every time!

very good, had a lb. of fresh chanterelles that i wanted to use in soup. used beef broth and definitely started with the onions and added garlic after. it's a winner, the taste of the chanterelles came through.

Very good, and worth making. I made it with chicken broth, but next time I'll use beef. I used less water, and substituted it for broth. Also, I would use less barley next time. Maybe 3/4 cup instead.

Excellent soup! My husband wants to know if I can make this everyday. I used a mix of white and red onions. Also used fresh herbs rather than dried. 1 1/2 tsp of each, rosemary and thyme. Will make again for sure.

I tried this recipe for the holiday and found it to be delicious. I had no sherry on hand, so I used a good Cabernet instead and it worked wonderful. I will certainly use this recipe again.

Very good. I thought the recipe called for too much olive oil, so I fried three strips of bacon and used a few tablespoons of fat from that to fry the mushrooms and onions. I used beef broth instead of chicken and added about a pound of well-browned beef stew meat to the mix. I also threw in a bay leaf. My husband is not a soup or mushroom fan but he went back for seconds.

Fantastic! I actually made this out of the Gourmet cookbook and everything so far has been great, this being no exception. I used beef broth (Trader Joes fat free boxed brand) instead of chicken broth as well and I found that it needed plenty of salt and pepper. Taste well and don't skimp. I also needed to add just a bit more broth at the end. Otherwise the soup is nice and earthy with just a hint of the sherry and a slight sweetness presumably from the garlic and onion. The shitakes also add great texture, and dont' leave out the parsley at the end, it adds a nice bright quality. We loved it. I halved it and it fed my SO and I (with salad and bread) for dinner plus enough for three servings of leftovers at least. I can't wait to eat them!

This is so good! I was worried when I started to cook down the mushrooms because they barely fit in the pot--patience matters with this recipe! I used beef broth instead of chicken broth but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. A great soup for a cold night.

"Hearty, healthy comfort food. Beef stewish without the beef. Good with a glass of red wine. I'm on my third helping now, just to finish it up.'' _ Husband. ''But if it cooks longer than the hour, add more liquid to keep it a soup.'' So, this was pretty easy and good. I halved the recipe, (but used the whole 3/4 oz. package of dried porcini mushrooms instead of 1/2 oz.) and it fed two teenagers, a hungry husband and me. Also served salad and sourdough rye.

IT SUCKS!!

I have made this soup twice: once with the shitake mushrooms and once without. It was delicious both times! I brought it to the office for my co-workers and it was a hit!

Great soup for a rainy winter night. I am a beginner cook, so prep time took me a while and didn't realize how long it would take to boil off the water from the mushrooms. But it a straightforward, hearty and delicious recipe.

We made this recipe with 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 mushroom broth. And we used dried porcini instead of shiitakes. The soup had absolutely NO FLAVOR. Now we have to figure out what to do with the leftovers...

Definitely omit the water...used 9 cups of chicken broth and 1-2tsp of herbes de provence instead of thyme and rosemary. Also thickened it with a little flour and melted butter. Just delicious. Have been making it this way since it was first published and everyone loves it

I usually make barley soup with beef stock. I had a lot of homemade chicken broth and decided to try this recipe. I had about 15 large fresh shitake mushrooms and used them instead of dried. Only had a few button mushrooms and threw them in. I used 10 cups of chicken broth instead of 5 broth and 5 water, as my broth was rather thin, and chopped up some celery to saute with the onions. Substituted marsala for the sherry which I was out of. Delicious and easy. Will definitely make it again.

I cut the recipe in half and used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth...and I used a bit more dried mushrooms...IT WAS WONDERFUL. It was even better the next day although it needs to be thinned out a bit with additional broth when reheated. If the intense flavor of olive oli is a turn off, used corn or vegetable oil.

we doubled the recipe and had NO leftovers! excellent for vegetarians and all very tasty

I tried it for the first time and will make it as often as the stove and pots will last.

I didn't like this dish very much. The taste of olive oil was too prominent in the soup. I almost felt like I was drinking it from the bottle. But the carrots and onions added a sweet taste that fortunately distracted me from the olive oil. I suggest that only olive oil enthusiasts try this recipe.

It's a keeper! I added a whole c. of barley vs. a 1/2 and more leeks. My family loves it, including my 18month old!

I really liked this recipe. It was not difficult and it was quick to make. Adding chicken or more wild mushrooms might give it a richer flavor. I cut the recipe in half and it made plenty for four, with some left over.
