The prune version is the best, I also added a bit of (rather finely) chopped walnuts and coated the bonbons in dark chocolate - it turned out delicious!

The bonbons turned out pretty well. I couldn't find prunes, so I substituted dried cherries - they were the best out of the three flavors. For a picture of the apricot bonbons, check out http://scottsfoodblog.com/2007/12/29/holiday-bonbons
