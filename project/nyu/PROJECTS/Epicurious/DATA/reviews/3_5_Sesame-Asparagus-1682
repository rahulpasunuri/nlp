Here's another take on these ingredients, using the sauce as a marinade. Steam and shock the asparagus, and then marinate it in the following: sugar - 1/4 c., plain old white vinegar 1/4 c., soy sauce 1/4 c., Oil - 1T, pepper as you like. Drain, heat, sprinkle with sesame seeds and eat.

Added garlic with the red peppers. Then added sliced mushrooms before the asparagus! SO good.

Like others have said, it is a pretty presentation. It was good as written, but next time I would definitely add some garlic or red pepper flakes for a little zip.

Supre easy and delish. Almost stole the show when I made it with Salmon withe sesame and orange giner. Followed the recepe exactly, except I dunked the asparagus into and ice bath after boiling to shock the color and stop the cooking. Really nice looking and very tasty!

Awesome. I made the sauce ahead of time and left it at room temp. We coated the asparagus with oil, grilled it and then tossed with sauce right before serving. A big hit at my last two dinner parties.

Very good and very simple. Do yourself a favor and make this tonight. I made it for my parents anniversary party and it was a hit!

So simple, and so good! I made it with orange-ginger swordfish. The Asian falvors complimented each other. I've also made this with broccoli when asparagus is out of season and that's good too.

Tried microwaving the asparagus as another rater suggested; worked well. Very fast, delicious recipe.

Good! Very colorful and full of flavor. I cooked the asparagus in the microwave for about 2-3 minutes prior to adding to the saute pan. I would make it again!

Quick and delicious! I made this side dish for Easter Dinner and to save time, I cooked the asparagus ahead. It just took minutes to finish, and everyone loved it.

My husband loves asparagus, but I had never really been a fan--until this recipie came along. I decided to make it because the colors in the picture looked so great. And I ended up really loving it. The flavors are wonderful and it is very easy to make. I have since enjoyed asparagus in many other dishes, but this is still my favorite.

I've made this recipe a few times for my family and for my mother-in-law who never ate fresh aspargus in her life. She has now converted from a can to the real thing. It's a beautiful and simple recipe. Share it with you friends.

A great change for asparagus. I have already prepared this more than once, and my family has declared it a keeper. Perfect since it takes barely more time than preparing it straight, but is an elegant, welcome addition to a meal. I microwave the asparagus rather than boil it in the preparation stage.

I find it hard to find basic vegetable dishes that have an interesting twist. Because it is easy and quick to prepare I make it for every day meals as well as for company. It's always a hit. It's hard to improve this one.

Easy to make and really good. I soak my asparagus stems in a little bit of sugared water before cooking which takes some of the bitterness out of the asparagus without altering the taste. Have made this recipe several times over the last few years and it is always a welcome hit!
