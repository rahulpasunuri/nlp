Holy smokes this was amazing with the roast pork recipe from the same month. I truly pity those who dont get fresh cranberry with meat. I was very nervous about it and the horseradish. Couldn't have been more wrong. The brightness accentuated all of the savoury flavours on the plate. Could not recommend this higher. What's that? You only like canned cranberry. You are dead to me.

I served this with a rolled/stuffed version of crown roast of pork with onion and bread- crumb stuffing for Christmas lunch and received rave reviews! I didnt have a full bottle of horseradish so used what I had (probably 4-5 ounces) and thought it was perfect. To complete the meal I also served potato and lardon casserole, roasted asparagus with hollandaise sauce and a tossed salad. It was a wonderful and simplemeal! A definite keeper and one I will certainly make again!

This is a wonderful adaptation of cranberry sauce to serve with beef or pork. The horseradish gives it a little "kick" and brings out the flavor of the cranberries without being cloyingly sweet like some are. I served this with a Crown roast of Pork and it was the perfect accompniment and added color to the pork. My husband, who doesn't like sweet stuff, went back for seconds, and raved about this dish. I made it a couple of days ahead to let the flavors meld and it was really wonderful. This one goes in my permanent recipe file!

This isn't cranberry sauce with a horseradish kick, it's just the reverse! Tart, slightly sweet and just great with pork. Easy, freezes well.

I made this with the crown roast of pork for Christmas and it was a bit hit. Traditional with a twist. I used all the horseradish it calls for (unlike some reviewers) and told everyone not to expect cranberry sauce -- it's more of a horseradish sauce flavored with cranberry. They loved it!

I made this with the crown pork roast for Christmas and I loved it. I used slightly less horseradish but at least 4oz. My husband and in-laws have mild palates so they didn't like it, but I will keep this for other guests in the future.

Wow this sauce was fantastic. I made it for the Crown Roast Pork and served the leftover cranberry with my Christmas turkey....no one used the plain cranberry sauce everyone grabbed for the horseradish!

After reading the reviews, I used only 4 oz of horseradish, otherwise I followed the recipe and I was skeptical, but game to try it for my pork roast. It was delicious and loved by most of my guests. I'm adding this to my cranberry recipes. It would be great with venison or goose as well as the pork.

I made this to go with a pork crown roast for a Christmas party. The horseradish so overwhelmed the cranberry that I threw it all away. Very disappointing. I like the idea of the flavors enough that I will try it again, but next time I'll try just 1 or 2 tablespoons or horseradish.

I made this sauce to go with a roast pork tenderloin for a christmas party. I thought it was fantastic -- it gave the cranberry sauce a little kick. I was afraid that the amount of horseradish would overwhelm the cranberries, but the cooking process mellows the horseradish. Will definitely make again.
