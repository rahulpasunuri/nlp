This is really yummy. I made it for my husband and his friends, and they really enjoyed it. Takes a while because of the onions, but if you have time, it's worth it. Don't need that much aioli either.

So, so good. What you want to do is prepare the Chicken with paprika, tomatoes and garbanzos beans that is elsewhere on this site, then use the leftovers for these sandwiches. My college-age son absolutely fell in love with this. So, for that matter, did I.

So grateful to reviewers or I would've skipped over this incredible recipe. The smoked paprika aioli & caramelized onion combo make it taste like the most delicious bacon-y yum. I used boneless skinless thighs and they were perfect, no need to cut in half. The onions take 30 minutes or more so start them first they only need monitoring for the first 10 minutes. I'm salivating just thinking about this sandwich!!

WOW, what an amazing chicken sandwich!!! I had roasted a chicken over the weekend and wanted to try a chicken sandwich recipe where I coud use my leftovers. Well,I didn't have paprika but I did have cajun seasoning. I wanted to add the "hot" part that the recipe asks for, so I added red pepper flakes to the mixture as well. It was perfect! I decided to also substitute the sourdough bread with ciabatta bread and it worked great.Overall a tasty sandwich that I can't wait to try again. Higly recommended!

We loved it! The combination of flavors was unique,but excellent. We did not have the Spanish paprika, so I used regular paprika with a little cayenne pepper and it turned out great.For the bread, we went with sour dough bread not rolls and we thought that was perfect. Not too bready and just the right amount of crunch.

Delicious as "sliders" on sourdough, whole wheat rolls!

I made the menu (with the heirloom gazpacho) for friends whom I was visiting and they said I should open up a restaurant. Ha! I made a dulce de leche/blackberry/nectarine parfait for dessert, and it matched great.

This is amazing. I have made it 3 times so far and everyone loves it. I crave the darn thing. I served it with a couscous salad and fruit salad for a small summer dinner party...what a perfect meal.

I love this sandwich. It is the perfect summer chicken sandwich. Made it exactly as written and we all loved it. Oops, not exactly as is. I used ciabatta rolls instead. Wonderful!!!!

I loved this sandwich! So simple, but restaurant quality. I used mild smoked paprika and added cayenne to taste. I also did not whisk in the extra oil into the aioli for caloric content, however aioli is almost identical to mayo so I'm not sure why you would need it anyway. Made it with the garlic and thyme sweet potato fries, complimented each other very well!

Excellent sandwich. I only had mild paprika so added a little cayenne. My husband loved it. Used fresh focaccia bread.

Husband has been asking for this all week, which is fine except we had it a week ago! Made it a while back with hungarian paprika, which was nothing to write home about. The spanish paprika made all the difference in the world. Used grilled ciabatta instead of rolls. FAB!

I have shared this recipe with family and friends who call it "The Chicken Sandwich". We use pita bread instead of the sourdough. Also, I was unable to find the hot smoked paprika so I use smoked paprika and a little cayenne.

We made these exactly as directed, but found them a bit heavy and rich that way - the mayo, oiled bread and caramelized onions made it seem unbalanced. Next time, I probably won't oil the bread and may just use fresh, thinly sliced onions.

I would give this lovely little bistro style sandwich four forks, but my husband had the audacity to say it was just OK, perhaps because he nearly starved waiting for the onions to carmelize. Other than the prep time of the onions (and requisite stirring which mandates regular attention) this was a perfect little sandwich. I will definately make them again, but perhaps next time just for the girls. Butternut squash soup would pair perfectly with this, as a side note...

I made this for a Friday night tailgate. I was very short on time so I purchased caramelized onions (williams sonoma), squeezed lime juice on the butterflied chicken breasts before bbqing and served on focaccia bread with the aioli. It was a HUGH hit and they were gobbled up. I was concerned the sandwiches wouldn't hold up but the watercress was fresh and made a delicious addition. (I'll make the onions next time)!

Great recipe! Super easy and even our young children enjoyed them! Only thing I changed was to use romaine instead of watercress, and we did one side of the bread with mayo, and the other with the aioli. Yummy though!

Tasted like a fancy sandwich from a hip bistro but it was sooo quick and easy. I was only making three sandwiches so I adjusted accordingly, but made the full aioli amount and used most of it. I didn't cut the chicken and it worked out just fine. Served with roasted red potato fries and baby peas with roasted garlic.
