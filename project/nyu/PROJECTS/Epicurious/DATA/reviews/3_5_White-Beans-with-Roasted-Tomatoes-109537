I get hungry for this dish every summer. I am going to make it tonight- lucky me!

I knew this dish needed a little jazzing up, and the results were awesome! I followed the recipe with a few additions: I omitted the sugar as well, and used balsamic vinegar instead. I also roasted some garlic in the pan with the tomatoes (for about 10 minutes) then threw that into the beans. And for the beans, I used veggie stock instead of water and browned the onions before adding them to the beans. So much more flavor! This is a very easy and delicious dish, and makes a great substitute for when I'm craving a winter version of salad caprese.

I used two cans of Whole Foods 365 brand Cannellini beans (no salt added) instead of dried beans to save prep time. I used Campari and Cherry tomatoes, omitted the sugar and added Rapunzel Pure Organic Vegetable Bouillon (no salt added), some dried oregano and black pepper for additional flavor since flavor seemed to be a hit or miss issue for people. I added the tomatoes into the beans and onions in a slow cooker and let it all meld for a couple of hours. The flavor of the roasted tomatoes is fabulous and overall this was really delicious!!!! I highly recommend this dish.

Made this twice in two weeks! First time, I made it with Texas onions (!? never heard of it but they were mini onions!), plum tomatoes, and cherry tomatoes. Omitted the sugar completely but other than that followed instructions. Came out great! Second time, I forgot to boil the onions with the beans, so I boiled it separately, added them together and let it sit in a plastic container overnight. Not as flavorful as the last time so don't forget!

I'm glad I read the reviews for suggestions-I couldn't find cipolline. I roasted carrots and pearl onions with the tomatoes; roasted a separate pan of yellow, red and orange peppers since I had them in the fridge; I roasted both pans until caramelized and the pan drippings are just delicious! I cooked the beans until tender with Herbes de Provence. I will probably serve it tonight on top of some pasta.

Really really good! I've made this recipe several times, with small variations each time. I've used canned white beans and/or cannellini beans, and both are good. I've used either all small tomatoes (a colorful mixture) or both large and small tomatoes as the recipe suggested, depending on what was available. I've made it for guests, and they loved it. This recipe is a keeper.

Absolutely loved it. This was my first try with the dish so I followed the recipe exactly. We found wonderful fresh cherry tomatoes in our CSA basket and needed to do something special with them.

Like many other reviewers, I thought this was just okay. The tomatoes were delicious, and they made the dish, but the rest was just okay. The beans were pretty unexciting (they were good, just not exciting) on their own, even after I cooked them with lots of fresh sage, thyme, rosemary, and oregano, peppercorns, bay leaves, carrot, etc. I roasted the cipolline and they were delicious as well, so as long as you had a bite with some onion, some tomato, and some bean, it was delicious. I would add more carrots next time, they were tasty, upped the veggies in the meal, and added some textural interest as well.

I really enjoyed this recipe but took some of the suggestions of the other folks who made this and added a couple of my own. First, I salted the water that the beans and onions cooked in before I started them. When they were done, I tested to see if they needed more salt and added a bit more. I used hawaiian red salt but kosher would be just as good. I also sauteed some garlic in olive oil and put it on the tomatoes before baking them in addition to the oil/salt/sugar mixture that the recipe calls for. Finally, I sprinkled the tomatoes with a nice sherry wine vinegar when they were done. It brought out the sweetness in the tomatoes.

I modified quite a bit and it was very good. I added roasted zucchini, onions and 1 whole head of roasted garlic. I mashed the garlic with a little chicken broth and added a little soy sauce to give it more depth. I like intense flavors and the garlic especially helped.

This was delicious and well-received for dinner party.

except that I now make this without the beans (which need more seasoning and need to be cooked to real softness)--serving it tonight as a side with artichoke lasagna for color and contrast.

Really fresh, delicious and easy. I used Maldon sea salt from England which brought out the sweetness of the tomatoes. You need to season the beans and onions for sure.

The purists won't approve of my review but here's what I did and it was delish. For the beans I followed "Cannellini Beans with Garlic and Sage" from Bon Appétit, October, 2009 (used the slow cooker) for dried/shelled homegrown green beans that had been left on the vine too long. As per suggestions of other cooks, I roasted cipoline and small red onions, stirred them into the drained beans, topped it with the roasted tomatoes and fresh basil. Wow - what a great dish!! Bread, rice or couscous might have a good accompaniment.

I thought this was great as a vegetarian main course, with toast for dipping. Use fresh home-grown or local farmer's market tomatoes, because they are definitely the key to flavor in this dish. A splash of balsamic can liven it up, but taste it first, you may not need it! As other reviewers suggested, I roasted the onions (I used plain yellow) and a few garlic cloves with the tomatoes. The use of canned beans makes this a fairly quick and simple weeknight dinner.

Amazing! Just so good when you take a big spoonful of it. I used can beans instead of dried and I did not use onions, but this is just fantastic!

This was pretty good. My husband liked it more than I did. I kept feeling like it could use a little something...maybe some cheese or vinegar?

Made this recipe with some fresh-frozen tomatoes leftover from last summer - YUM! Put them in the roasting pan following the directions, and after roasting let the sauce concentrate at 350 for a half-hour more while the rest of dinner was cooking. A spectacular Tuscan-French Provencial dish!

I've made this multiple times and it's simply tasty. I think if it's turning out bland for you, it's probably the quality of the tomatoes. I use either heirloom, roma (plum), or in a pinch a nice organic tomato. The flavor of the tomato is really what makes this dish.

This is a yummy, one- bowl-wonder! I didn't have the time to soak the beans, so I used canned ones. Also, I added oregano to the tomatoes while stirring them in olive oil, sugar and salt. Its nice to pour minced garlic, lightly sauteed in olive oil, over the tomatoes just before the oven. Didn't have the "boiling onion," so I used a regular yellow onion, chopped and sauteed with some canadian bacon and olive oil. Served it with beans- bacon-onions on bottom, roasted tomatoes on top, and cut fresh basil over it last. mmm!

A wonderful savory delight. Not blah at all.

Very much worth the effort, delicious! Served it with grilled pork tenderloin but could be a vegetarian main course. The smoke from the high heated oven was a problem tho...maybe do the tomatoes on your grill.

I've made this twice now - just delicious. Thanks to previous reviewers for some great tips. I used canned beans (two cans of cannelini perfect for this amount of tomatoes), roasted my cipolline in with the tomatoes (after blanching them for one minute to make peeling easier), roasted a whole head of garlic (separated in to cloves but left unpeeled) along with the tomatoes and onions, and finally gave it a splash of balsamic vinegar after it came out of the oven. I brought this to a party and numerous people asked me how to make it. It was definitely a hit.

I made this for a garden club meeting and it was well received...but I thought it was rather 'heavy' and would maybe like it with some pasta in the future. But it may be because I carmalized the onions and they created a richness that maybe was intended for this recipe.

I thought this recipe was going to be a bit unusual & a stretch for my guests, but everyone loved it and I have made it several times since. Delicious!

This dish definitely needed garlic, so I roasted large whole cloves with the tomatoes, then added minced garlic to the finished product. Also, a "hit" of good balsamic vinegar did wonders.

A wonderful recipe.Added 2 teaspoons minced garlic to the olive oil.Used 2 pounds vine-ripened tomatoes and 1 pound pearl onions.Used 2(15-oz)cans Progresso cannellini beans. Tossed the tomatoes and onions with the olive oil mixture and placed in a 12x9-inch baking dish.Added 1/4 teaspoon minced garlic to the warm beans and lightly seasoned with salt and pepper.Served it in an 8 1/2x 8 1/2-inch dish. This has already become a favorite of my family.

This dish was surprisingly blah -- even after I dressed it up with garlic, herbs, peppercorns and vegetables while simmering (all were removed afterward). It wasn't bad, it just didn't have much flavor. I also threw some minced garlic in with the tomatoes, though, which were heavenly on their own!

I don't know if I did something wrong but this was totally blah. I even roasted garlic with everything as suggested but it was just bland.

This was a big hit. I also used canned beans and added chopped garlic to the roasted tomatoes. I think it would do very well in the winter w/only cherry tomatoes.

This is a keeper! I used canned beans. I drained and rinsed them and then just brought them to a simmer in salted water. I roasted the onions with the tomatoes and some garlic. They caramelized in about 30 minutes and were delicious. The dish makes a beautiful presentation also.

This was very, very good! I used two cans of beans and added three cloves of garlic (cut into chunks). I roasted the garlic and onions (from a jar; couldn't find the fresh) in the pan with the tomatoes. So good, so easy, yum, yum, and I can't stress this enough...yum!

I roasted the vegs on the grill. Next time I would only use large toamtoes- I used cherry & plum, but the cherry fell apart. This was very easy & very tasty. A very nice change from the usual side that I served with grilled salmon.

This is delicious! I used canned beans(rinsed) and substituted pearl onions. It turned out to be a quick and delicious side dish. I don't usually like beans, but I started picking them up now! Yummy!

All our favorite Mediterranean ingredients in this! The little onions aren't easy to find, but jarred did work. Everyone loved it!

The picture doesn't do this justice. It is beautiful, easy and yummy too. The small to medium tomatoes were better than the large. I couldn't resist adding garlic so I sliced it and sauteed it in olive oil and added it to the beans with a generous squeeze of lemon juice. I served it as a veggie entree with roasted asparagus but would serve it with grilled fish or as part of a buffet. This can be peasant-y or elegant depending on presentation. Will make this over and over.

Thought this dish was excellent! Could not find white onions so sliced yellow onions and roasted them with the tomatoes until they carmelized. Good quaility canned beans (rinsed) would make this a quick and delicious side dish.

My husband and I loved this, but probably because of the roasted tomatoes. I just used canned beans, and a sliced Vadelia onion, as it was all I had. I thought the cherry tomatoes were burnt when I took them from the oven, but they were delicious! Great simple recipe.

This just didn't do it for my husband and I. The only thing we liked were the tomatoes - but it's hard to mess up roasted tomatoes.

Much to my surprise, this was just "okay". We love all the ingredients, this just seemed to need something else...maybe garlic or carmelizing the onions would have helped...something to tie it all together and give it some depth. I used very good tomatoes too. Don't know...

This was a fantastic recipe on its own, but I changed a few things after reading up on bean dishes, (I am such a rogue.....) but the additions were lovely and as follow: navy beans because I had them, and they were perfect white and firm when cooked even with the salt added during cooking, (what was that old wives tale about no salt during cooking of beans about anyway?) bay leaf, salt and one clove of minced garlic during cooking of the beans, 10 minutes or so before end of bean cooking time added one chopped carrot and 3 cups or so of coarsley chopped baby spinach. I also added some yellow and red peppers that I roasted in olive oil and salt and pepper for about 30 to 40 minutes in a separate pan from tomatoes...then to top it all off a handful of dried cherries.....beautiful!! Make an effort to find the cipolline onions...they are outstandingly sweet and have a beautiful presentation!

This is such a simple recipe, and yet the combination of flavors is exquisite. The chopped basil adds a wonderful touch, and the roasted, carmelized tomatoes are an inspired addition. I'll definitely be making this again.
