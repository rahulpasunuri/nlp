This is a solid recipe and it's very easy to make. Definitely roast it longer than the recipe says; I didn't take it out of the oven until the skin was golden brown...so instead of the eight minutes after stirring it I would say I had it in there for at least another 12 minutes. It's not overly flavorful, so I served it with chive pesto fingerling potatoes and it was a perfect combination.

Followed directions to the letter, and it came out well, with both the meat and veggies nicely done. While the meat was very juicy, the flavor was a little boring... very "chicken". The vegetables on the other hand were great, and my husband (not normally a veggie fan) loved them, and ate them all. Would try again but with a little oomph added to the spice on the chicken.

followed the recipe, used frozen veggies instead and Marsala wine and a good oven thermometer (not relying on the oven display). the hens came out just right, crispy on outside, juicy on inside and was delicious.

I loved this recipe! This was truly quick and delicious, adding additional vegetables was a nice, and the sauce from this was exceptional.

I suspect, after reading the reviews, that those who found the hens undercooked did not split/halve them as the recipe calls for; there is no reason the hens would need more cooking time than specified unless they were left whole. And one should NEVER buy or use so called "cooking wine". If you won't drink it, don't cook with it. If you don't want to open a bottle to cook with then use dry vermouth.

Delicious and quick weeknight meal. Cooked the bird for exactly 25 minutes (almost 1 3/4 pounds) and it was perfectly done. The fennel makes this dish come alive. To those with undercooked birds: Is your oven really reaching 500 degrees? An independent oven thermometer is a good gauge. Also, if the bird came right out of the fridge into the oven, it would definitely take longer. Let the hen sit out on counter while you prep the veggies and preheat the oven.

Amazingly easy and delicious, plus a nice way to make a main course and vegetables at the same time. Like other reviewers, we had to cook the hens for longer than the recipe indicated. Also, depending on appetites, 1/2 a hen might not be quite enough.

I, too, was disappointed. As the previous reviewer stated, it took longer than indicated and I had to keep putting it back in to be edible. I did, however, like the combination of leeks and fennel, they both went well together.

We were disappointed. It took longer to cook than the recipe said so I had to return it to cook after opening it up. I had stuck a scewer in the leg to check for doness, but I guess I need more practice. The fennel didn't taste nice to us. The leeks and carrots alone would have been better and it could have used a punch, like garlic. After the hens were cooked properly I decided that I will one day try to make them again with a Moroccan recipe. I'll let you know how it goes...

The hens came out very tender. I substituted a little bit of beer in place of the wine, and roasted the veggies under the broiler for a few minutes just prior to serving. Everyone raved about the vegetables, and asked if I would make them again to accompany other meals.

The hen turned out to be absolutely tender. My only suggestion would be to add more veggies that people tend to eat as sides.

My mouth was watering all day in anticipation of trying this dish. This medley of vegetables is a tasty and very satisfying accompaniment to the hen which came out incredibly juicy but was not undercooked. I roasted everything 10 minutes after adding the wine and it was simply superb. Next time I won't use cooking wine(too salty) and I'd like to add another leek. My highest recommendations!!
