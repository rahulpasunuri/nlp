i LOVED this recipe. it seriously was one of the most amazing pies ever, and *everyone* who ate it raved about it. i used a store-bought crust because i was running short on time. i didn't bake the crust in advance, just did it with the filling because i've always found that pumpkin pie filling takes much longer to bake than you think it will...and of course it did. i think it baked for almost 1.5 hours (including the time with the topping) - but it was SO tasty!! not too heavy, really tasty. i didn't adjust anything in terms of ingredients, and didnt think it was too sweet. didn't measure the pumpkin - used a 15oz can from trader joes.

This pie is a winner. Much better than the average pumpkin pie. I used my own crust, which calls for both unsalted butter and vegetable shortening, and no sugar. I also used only 3/4 cup brown sugar in the filling as many reviewers recommended. I'm glad I did. The pie was sweet enough with the added sugar in the topping. I loved the spicy flavor of this pie, combined with the brown sugar and nut topping. I baked the filling in the crust for 55 minutes (no need to pre-bake the crust), then added the topping and turned down the heat for an additional 10 minutes. Perfect!

Great pie! My family said it was the best they've ever had, and it was so quick and easy! I ended up using canned pumpkin and pre made crust, but used half the sugar like other reviews recommended and it worked wonderfully. The other review recommending bourbon maple whipped cream was also fantastic.

FANtastic!! The pie was a hit following Thanksgiving meal. This is only the 2nd time I've attempted to make a pumpkin pie - the recipe and tips from others made me look like a pro. I will definitely make this again. These tips were esp. helpful: Use a real pumpkin and strained to get rid of excess water before adding it to the recipe. Precook crust 5-7 min. (bought pre-made, gluten-free crust, straight from freezer to oven). Cut back on sugar. Enjoy, you can't go wrong with this recipe!!

Absolutely THE best pumpkin pie recipe ever! I added 1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. I baked for 1 hour (without pre-baking the crust) as I live at high altitude. I kept an eye on it and and kept foil around the edges till the last 15 minutes. Took it to a party and the guests said it was the best pumpkin pie they HAD EVER HAD!

This is straight amazing. I used pecans instead of walnuts in order to solve that whole pecan vs. pumpkin pie debate. Also I couldn't find canned pumpkin the day before Thanksgiving so I used sweet potato. This pie is delicious! The nut topping is perfect. Ate it with cream that I whipped with some bourbon and maple syrup. So good.

On one hand, perhaps I should say it was magnificent, for my fussy husband, who generally dislikes pumpkin pie, thought this was "delicious" and he even had seconds. First time he's enjoyed pumpkin pie and I've tried several supposedly magnificent pumpkin pie recipes out on him. On the other hand, even though I made a pate brisee crust (no sugar), reduced the brown sugar in the filling to 3/4c, added extra pumpkin and upped the spices a bit, I thought it was too sweet and a bit bland. I liked the taste and textural contrast of the nut topping, but next time I make this, I think I'll add a little butter to the topping, in hopes that it will hold together better and not make such a crumbly mess. And yes, there will be a next time, but with reduced sugar in the topping, too, and more spices in the filling, especially ginger. (Hmmmm, maybe crystallized ginger could sub for the sugar in the topping?) Thanks to the preceding review/comment from tleningt, I was able to tell exactly when to take mine out of the oven; mine took an extra 14 minutes.

This pie is so good! I followed some suggestions from other reviewers and it came out perfect! I bought a 2 pack of frozen 9" pie shells (all natural). I made double the topping. For the filling I did the amount stated plus 1/2 more of what it called for. It filled up the pie shells perfectly. I did not pre-cook the shells, but I did use the foil tent for the crust. I cut down on the sugar a bit, and strained my fresh pumpkin to get rid of excess water before adding it to the recipe. The cooking time for the pie filling was closer to an hour. It tastes so good, I love the crumb topping!!!

Wonderful Pie!!!!!! I dont even like pumpkin pie and want to make it over and over again

It's odd that the photo with this recipe has the pie out of focus, so I cannot tell if the brown sugar was supposed to melt into the filling or not. Mine did not melt in, and I found it overall too sweet. I wish recipes would give you a range of sugar to use so that those of us who do not like sickly sweet desserts don't have to make it twice to get the sugar right. I also found it took much longer to bake until the filling puffed up, as suggested in the recipe. It makes a big difference if you use a light coloured aluminum pan, a glass, or a black enamel pan. I used an aluminum pan and it took twice as long to bake. Next time I'll try a glass or black enamel pan. Otherwise, a good recipe.

I found this pie too sweet overall. The brown sugar in the topping was over kill on sweetness. Next time I would reduce the sugar in the filling by 1/4 cup, and reduce the sugar in the topping to just one tablespoon. I used roasted buttercup squash from my garden, and coconut milk instead of cream. The spices in the filling were just right. I found the crust shrank quite a bit, so I had leftover filling, and baked it in a couple of small ramekins. I think I'll try pecans next time instead of walnuts.

I used Martha Stewart's pate brisee recipe for the crust (only used one crust and froze the other). Also, cut the brown sugar to 3/4c; added 1/8tsp nutmeg and allspice; used a whole 15oz can of pumpkin puree; and subbed a 12oz can of evaporated milk for the cream. This was perhaps the best pie I've ever made. You could up the spices a bit but I think it had just the right balance. The topping was unique and added a great little crunch. The recipe doesn't do a good job of telling you how to know when the pie is done, since the topping makes the visual cues a bit tricky. The secret is to insert a butter knife about 1inch from the center--when it comes out clean the pie is done. I will be adding this to my holiday (and post-holiday) repertoire!

The pie filling itself is outstanding. I had seconds as did everyone else. The crust with the sugar in it was not the best. Too hard to cut so we had to use our hands. It was tough though sweet. Try a regular short crust.

Rating: 3
This was a great pie, although sadly unappreciated by the non-Americans I was cooking for. I thought it had just the right amount of spice and wasn't too sweet, perhaps that is because I roasted and pureed fresh pumpkins from the market rather than pumpkin puree (because it's not available here)! Its presentation was less beautiful than I hoped but that might be more due to my baking than the recipe. Great, basic pie--will definitely make it again next year.

Great Pie. Made my own crust recipe, followed the rest of the recipe to a tea. Only thing I would do differently next time is to take the sugar in the filling down just a bit. GREAT PIE!

I made this for my thanksgiving dinner this year as a gift to my father who looks forward to treating himself to pumpkin pie every November. It was a complete hit, the entire family could not stop talking about it. I made the pie crust a few days before and stored it in my freezer until the wednesday before thanskgiving. The pie crust was not so pretty, but the tasty filling made up for it. I also substituted the walnuts for pecans which everyone seemed to love. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to impress family on the holiday.

Was a home run! Even folks who don't like pumpkin pie liked this recipe. I used my own crust recipe but did the filling as specified.

This recipe is excellent. For those making their own pie crusts, I offer the following adjustments: -make and blind bake your crust -if using a 10 inch pie pan, instead of the 9 inch pie pan called for in the recipe, adjust filling by simply using a whole can of pumpkin instead of just a cup. -I had to increase cooking time by about 30 minutes overall

Amazing! My daughter just made this and it was delicious. At our local grocery store they only had 9 inch crust so we got two of those just in case. When we made the filling, we had enough for two pies! So we made ine with the topping and then one plain one. I also recommend using pecans instead of walnuts. The texture is way more enjoyable. :)

I used Libby's canned pumpkin and a store bought crust and this pie rocked. It was quick, easy, and best of all, delicious. I added a little bit more pumpkin than the recipe called for and added 1/4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice per the recommendations from prior reviews. You won't be disappointed!!

The walnut topping was great - that's the only part of the recipe I used. I just made the regular pie recipe from the can. Turns a boring pie into something great. Next time I'm going to add a little butter to the nuts to see if it will be more toffee-ish.

Also, I cooked the pie for about 45-50 minutes and added 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Perfect!

This pie is DELICIOUS! I'm not the biggest pumpkin pie fan, but I needed to make one so I tried out this recipe, and I absolutely love it. I can't stop eating it and may have to make another one tomorrow! I used a store bought pie crust and didn't even make the topping, just the filling. It's simple and delicious. For those who roasted their own pumpkin and were not happy with the results, I find that fresh pumpkin can be watery and needs to be drained after roasting to get the same (thicker) texture as canned pumpkin.

I was really disappointed in this pie. As many others have said, it took much longer than stated to bake, and then the end results were less than satisfying. It's way too sweet for my taste -- cloying, in fact -- and too airy and whipped as well. I roasted and pureed my own pumpkin, so the pumpkin flavor was there, but the texture was too soft and insubstantial. Glad I tested this out well before Thanksgiving; I won't be serving this to our extended family.

Rating: 4
This pie is excellent, the best I've ever had/made. I doubled the spices and added some more pumpkin because I like A stronger pumpkin taste. Like others have mentioned, I had to bake the filling much much longer than instructed. And for some reason my crust shrank down when I was baking it, and I am not exactly sure why. Otherwise, a wonderful recipe I am definitely making my primary pumpkin pie recipe.

Not too much effort and so delicious. I don't usually like pumpkin pie but made this for an autumn themed dinner at someone's house and I couldn't believe I wanted a second slice!

I substituted 1 cup of canned pumpkin for 2 cups of fresh roasted pumpkin. I also substituted the ginger, cinnamon and cloves for 1.5 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. I did have to cook it for over 1hr, much more than the recipe states. This pie was a hit at a potluck. The host even wanted the leftovers. It was not a strong, spicy pie, but rather a lightly flavored and creamy pie. I think I have to make this again so that I can have more!

This pie was good, but not outstanding. The topping was a little rich for me and maybe the 15 minutes were not enough but I expected it to melt the sugar a little more than it did. Next time I would probably leave the topping off or reduce the sugar since the walnuts were still a nice addition. I added 1/2 cup more pumpkin for 1.5 C total and rounded out the spices and baked pre-topping for 40 minutes.

Fantastic pies. I made it with fresh pumpkin and squash from our farmers' market. Made fantastic pies that melted in your mouth. Also, made it both with and without the walnut topping. Fantastic with all variations.

I made this pie yesterday for my son's birthday. It was so good, and I normally pass on pumpkin pie. (My husband said it was the best pie he ever tasted.) A few notes that might come in handy: I went heavy handed on the filling spices, and the cooking time was closer to an hour rather than 30 minutes. Use a deep dish as the pie puffs up more like a deep dish apple pie than a traditional pumpkin pie. I also added a dollop of the spiced whipped cream seen in another recipe on epicurious. Very delicious even in a tough crowd used to culinary delights. My son was felt very special. :)

I baked two of these pies for Thanksgiving dinner. My family and guests told me they were the best pumpkin pies they have ever tasted. I am making three of them for Christmas, one for my daughter to take to her fiance's family dinner.

I also loved this pie and received great reviews. I had to cook it a LOT longer than called for, but it turned out delicious. I served it with spiced whipped cream from the "pumpkin pie with spiced whipped cream" recipe and was glad I did because it added just the right touch. People who don't like pumpkin pie and people who live for pumpkin pie both gave it rave reviews.

I added Grandmarnier and a healthy dollop of ginger syrup (Ginger People) to both the pumpkin pie filling and the topping. I absolutely loved this pie.

This recipe is amazing! The custard is so delicate and you can really taste the pumpkin in it. I used a store bought crust from Whole Foods and it worked just fine, I just transferred it to a glass pie dish. Also only had dark brown sugar and a pumpkin pie spice mixture on hand, and those worked perfectly. The topping really sets this pie apart. My mother in law said it was even better than her traditional pie-- possibly the greatest compliment I could have received.

Made this today and served it this evening. It was DELICIOUS! I used a frozen crust from Trader Joes's and added the whole can of pumpkin as someone else on here suggested. My cooking time was about an hour before I added the walnut topping. The cooking was a little tricky for me but well worth it!

This was a big hit in my house today. I used the crust recipe recommended and followed the other tips and rounded the spices, used 1 1/2 cups pumpkin and baked 10 minutes longer. I want to make it with fresh pumpkin next time. A keeper P.S. I topped the pie with a vanilla rum whipped cream!!! :-)

Perfect and updated pumpkin pie. The pie was raved about by many.

I made this for my family and EVERYBODY loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe states but added the whole can of pumpkin. This keeps it from being soggy and gives it more pumpkin flavor. I didn't increase the spices but I didn't level off the measuring spoon either and I did have to cook it longer. Eye-rolling good.

I tried out this recipe to see if it were "Thanksgiving worthy." While it was quite delicious, I do have to say that the "Molasses and Spice Pumpkin Pie" recipe on here is much better. I think I'll go back to my Molasses and Spice Pumpkin Pie for Thanksgiving.

This is the perfect pumpkin pie recipe. The spices give that traditional pumpkin flavor and the walnut topping gives it that little extra something. Also, the recipe gives a double-baking technique for store-bought crusts that really makes all the difference, especially if you're not into making a home-made crust. I don't think I'll be looking for another pumpkin pie recipe again.

Wonderful! The spices in this pie were perfect for me. I had to extend the baking time to about 1 hour total, adding the topping after about 45 minutes. Next time I will reduce the amount of brown sugar in the topping and not process to fine crumb as recipe suggests. I like the texture of larger walnut pieces and a little less sweetness. My dinner party loved this pie. I used my own basic pie crust and bypassed all the freezing. I pre-baked with pie weights for about 20 minutes and had no trouble with it browning too much or getting soggy. This is a keeper.

I made this pie with pecans instead of walnuts, and used a pre-made whole wheat crust (9"). I also added enough pecans to encrust the entire surface. The second round in the oven was a few minutes longer than the 15 minute suggestion. The pie will become firm after cooling, so make sure you give yourself about an hour for it to completely cool. This pie does NOT keep well, and should be consumed within the day of being made. The crust eventually becomes soaked from the filling's moisture content. It's also a bit difficult to serve without a proper pie/cake knife. I may make this crowd pleaser again with some tweaks - less heavy whipping cream, and maybe some flour for firmer texture for the filling, for example.

I am a baking novice, and have only attempted pie crust once before. Granted, I didn't have a stand mixer like the recipe says, and tried it in the food processor instead. Fail. That said, I made the Martha Stewart "perfect pie crust* from her general cookbook, used my food p., and did the rest the same. It took a long time, and it felt like what giving birth must be like, but tasting it made me feel like my pumpkin pie baby got accepted to Harvard. Amazing. And super proud of myself.
