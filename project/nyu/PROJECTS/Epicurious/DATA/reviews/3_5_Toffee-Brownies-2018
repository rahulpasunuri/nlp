Moist, delicious brownie with fine crumb. Nothing like the gooey or rock hard versions that seem to come from mixes. I've never been a brownie fan, but I made these for a party and thought the toffee topping would be enough for me to enjoy them as dessert. In the end, I think the frosting and toffee topping were too much. The brownie alone is delicious. I took the feedback from other reviewers and frosted them individually. We've been eating the left overs without the frosting and like 'em even better!

Excellent! Far better than the other toffee brownie recipe on the site.

I have made this recipe a number of times and it ALWAYS gets great reviews!

I agree with the cook who said "nothing subtle about these." Incredibly fudgy and moist. The espresso makes the brownie a tiny bit bitter (in a good way) and the topping makes them creamy and sweet. LOVED them. I had trouble not eating them all myself.

Best brownies I've ever had. I made them for a baby shower, along with several fancier cookie bars, and the brownies all disappeared first. People raved about them and threatened to fill their purses with brownies. Decadent and delicious.

Nothing subtle about this brownie. Too many things going on. The crushed candy topping put it "over the top" on the sweet scale. Thought the brownie was a little too dense. For those who like a fudgie brownie, this might be worth the try.

Call me crazy but my brownie loving family didn't like this recipe at all....

These were quite good on the first day, but I definetly have to disagree about them being even better on day two. I kept them in the refrigerator overnight because of the cream cheese frosting and they got very moist and fudgey, which I know doesn't sound bad, but really they were much more appealing on the first day. I would only make them again if they would all be eaten right away. I'm throwing out 3/4 of the pan. (They might keep better overnight not in the refrigerator and frosted just before serving) Also, they did take the full 30 minutes of baking time.

This is the best brownie recipe that I have ever tried! Living in Argentina, which is three hours ahead of central time, most people here have never tasted brownies before. I think that I will try again tomorrow at seven central time to make this wonderful recipe and this time use less cream cheese topping and more Heath bar to give it texture.

The brownie base was amazing and is wonderful on its own. The toffee can be a lot of work to chop up but is so worth it. I added some more sugar and cream to the cream cheese so it tasted like a topping and not just cream cheese. A huge hit every time I've made them.

Very easy and delicious. Brought to work and won a prize for them. The espresso gives an added kick!

It is essential to make these a day in advance. The day I baked these we thought they were just so-so. Overnight in the refrigerator, however, they underwent a transformation, and they were GREAT the next day - - rich, moist, fudgy. Probably could do without the cream cheese topping - - it seemed like an afterthought.

To die for!! I made these for a friend. I didn't expect to like them this much, I hadn't found a cream cheese brownie recipe that I liked until now!! Even after 3 days in the fridge, still looks and tastes yummy. Recipe scaled down well too (I cut it in half and used an 8" square pan).

Intensely chocolatey, and cakier than a brownie, but the flattest, smoothest, most attractive looking brownies I've ever made--they also come out of the pan very, very easily (I cocoaed instead of floured). The smooth brownie with the topping (I used a tablespoon of yogurt instead of heavy cream; tangier and lower in fat, along with lowfat cream cheese which also works here) and the toffee bars is simply heaven.

I made these for a bar-b-que we had yesterday and they were a real hit! I agree with baking them 20 min rather than 30. One note I have is after putting the toffee bits on I put the cover on the pan and it made the bits melt some and be caramel like which was good,however next time I will keep the lid off at first and try them with crunch!

The brownies were good, but rich. In fact, they were better on the second day. I would make the brownies the day before you need them and then frost them on the day you will serve them.

I made these delicious brownies for company one evening and everyone LOVED them. 1 1/3 cups of toffee for the topping might sound like a lot, but the amount is perfect to cut the richness of the brownie underneath. I stored them unrefrigerated in an airtight container overnight and they actually tasted better the next day!

I made a batch of these to take to work today and everyone loved them.....I'm printing out a bunch of copies for all the recipe requests.

Very good and VERY rich. I used Skor bars and enjoyed the rich chocolate combined with the tangy cream cheese mixture. The brownie base is wonderful.

These are good--kids love them because of the topping. I wouldn't cook them for as long as the recipe states; I think 20 minutes is enough time.
