TO "A COOK": Crispiness in fried vegetables comes from proper heat and preparation, not just tempura. Even tempura or flour dredging can be soggy if one does not cook it correctly, or leaves the item wet. I find that Fried Leeks are fabulous. They are more crispy if closer to dark, but also taste wonderful in a dish if just a bit fried and still green. I followed the instructions from "Oyster Soup with Frizzled Leeks" which I found were more informative on proper preparation.

You can fry anything! Including kale, (highly recommend with bird chilis and garlic.) Just make sure the leeks aren't wet and you do it really hot, and in small batches! Brown is good.... (You can also do this with sage leaves, but don't let them get brown.)

I've made this for years and they've always turned out crispy. Make sure the oil is spitting hot and do small batches. Actually I make double what I need because I tend to eat them like potato chips when I'm cooking.

The crispiness in fried vegetables comes from breading- think tempura. The previous reviewer nailed it, just plain fried leeks will be soggy and oily, NOT crispy. It doesn't matter how hot you get the oil. These need to be dredged in flour, etc, for this to even remotely work.

To the last reviewer, from my experience it sounds like you didn't have your oil heated to a high enough temperature. I haven't tried this yet but I will be doing this as an accompaniment to a seafood entree Saturday night for guests so I will give a report (I WILL test before I serve it to my guests though!)

This recipe sounded easy but the leeks were saturated with oil. The only "crispy" ones were the ones that were almost burnt.

my husband loves this as an eye-pleasing garnish for meat or fish. i've made this in a 'fry daddy" and on the stovetop. very simple.
