I served this pesto with poached chicken thighs. My father in law, who is originally from Hong Kong) has served a similar pesto with poached chicken numerous times. I skipped the macadamia nuts, as my father in law does not use nuts in his recipe. I found the pesto a tad bitter on its own; I did add a teaspoon or two of agave nectar to help balance it. However, when combined with brown rice and chicken, the the flavors combined wonderfully. In the future, I will cut back on the scallions and/or ginger to see if that reduces the bitterness.

I reduced the oil to 5T and added 2T of freshly squeezed lemon juice to make up the liquid amount. Also reduced ginger to 1/3 cup. Delicious!

This has a wonderful refreshing flavor. I changed nothing.

Follow the recipe precisely, except for the amount of ginger (use a little less), and you'll get pesto that tastes good even raw. I served it on top of boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I seared (dry, no oil, just salt and pepper) on a heavy cast-iron skillet. Delicious! Will definitely make this again.

I own a catering business and use this pesto recipe all the time - its amazing and everyone raves about it time and time again. Those who substituted other nuts will NOT get the same thing - not even close. The magic here is in the cilantro and macadamia nuts together - otherwise make some other pesto with the nuts that you have. I use this on grilled shrimp with mango salsa, crust halibut with it, and more. This really is good ... trust me!

The pesto was nasty on its own. DO not eat raw! I grated and sauted instead of chopped the ginger and used walnuts instead of macadamias. I cooked bonless chicken thighs in the oven until almost tender then topped each one with the pesto and let it cook for about 15 min. It was good but I probably won't be serving it for company.

Great flavor. I didn't change the cilantro/ginger ratio. I mixed in a little 1/2 and 1/2 and served it over penne. I also increased the amount of cayenne for a little extra kick.

Disappointed with the dish. Kind of bland, and the ginger overpowered the cilantro. Not worth the effort.

Definitely will be making this again; an unexpectedly delicious combination of flavors. Next time I'll go a little easier on the ginger to bring the cilantro out a little more.

I enjoyed this recipe for the bold flavors and that it's a relatively healthy way to prepare chicken. My husband gave this five stars! I too used pine nuts, although you couldn't really taste them. I used the George Foreman as well. Next time I will use half the amount of ginger - it was definitely the predominant flavor. I will also try using olive oil instead to make it a little healthier.

This is really good. I cooked the chicken on the George Foreman grill rather than cooking it in oil, and topped it with the pesto for the last two minutes of cooking. Kind of spicy and unusual - and the amazing thing is that my 13 year old son liked the pesto!

I made this recipe because I needed to use up the huge bunch of cilantro in my fridge. I doubled the recipe and froze it in several one-cup containers. A few days later, I thawed one and made the chicken as described here. Simple and delicious. As other reviewers have said, the cilantro and ginger married together perfectly, with neither taking on a predominant flavor.

An excellent addition to the chicken repertoire. However, I will broil the breasts next time. There was too much fat in the saute pan.

The pesto would be great with fish.

A great variation from traditional pesto - the flavors blend so well you don't get a strong cilantro or ginger taste...definitely a keeper! Easy to just throw in the food processor. We used pine nuts too...

This is one of my all-time favorites! I use it over penne and grilled/chopped chicken, double the recipe, add a little milk or 1/2 & 1/2 at the end and toss with diced fresh tomatoes and a good parmesean/asagio. Delicious. Everyone I've ever served it to loves it.

I changed this recipe a bit; used peanuts since that was the only thing I had on hand. The ginger flavor was a bit much; next time will cut down to about 3/4 of what is called for in the recipe. Other than that, absolutely yummy and easy.

Delicious and easy to make!

This is one of my favoite fast and easy recipes although I use it on pasta. A nice salty cheese and diced tomatos with sauted chicken penne is really good. I usually use pine nuts.

I baked the pesto over chicken, (sealed and cooked for 30 mins at 350 degrees), and the cayenne really came through. The recipe makes about enough for 6-8 portions, but was delicious. Served with prawn rice salad and salad, for a really light meal.

Fabulous with sea bass. Really easy, pretty and delicious. I served my guests grilled sea bass with achoice of the roasted red pepper sauce (from epicurious) and this. Both tasted great but this pesto won hands down, I like it better than the traditional basil/ pignola nut version. This is one of the recipes that make epicurious just a great site.

Wow, this was super as a spread for a chicken breast sandwich! I had come across the recipe as a result of a search for "cilantro pesto" (I had had the better part of a bunch going a begging in my fridge.) Like one of the previous reviewers, I used pecans rather than Macadamia nuts . . . Try it on a sandwich with a nice artisanal bread!

Instead of using whole chicken breasts, I chopped up the chicken and sauteed with a little basil. I tossed the chicken with penne and added this pesto. Topped it with shredded asiago and diced tomato. It was fabulous!

I used the pesto on linguine as a sauce; a single batch coats 1/2lb pasta, for dinner for two. This was an excellent pesto--definitely cilantro flavored. I used cilantro in place of the parsley, and pecans for the macademia nuts. Definitely make again!
