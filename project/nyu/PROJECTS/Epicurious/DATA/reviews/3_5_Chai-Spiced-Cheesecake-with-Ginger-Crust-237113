PS I agree with the other reviewers who said that the crust took too long to bake and burned as a result...

This was disappointing... despite all the packages of cream cheese it called for, i was bummed that it wasn't thicker in consistency. Also, it needed more sugar. Finally, the crust was forgettable. Find yourself a great plain cheesecake recipe that you already like and add the spices from this one, and you might have your winner. Also, maybe a gingersnap crust....

Everyone loved this cheesecake. I did only bake the crust for 20 minutes and it was brown. I didn't roll the crust out, just poured the crumbly dough into the pan and pressed it to the bottom and up the sides. It worked great. Everyone commented on the crust. I will definitely make it again.

This is my FAVORITE cheesecake!! I have made it at least 6 times and I plan on making it again tommorow. I love the creamy texture as most cheesecakes are SO dense and heavy. I have played with the spice a bit and used Garam Masala and some orange rind. I also have adapted the crust and make a standard cheesecake crust but instead of graham crackers, I use ginger snaps. Also garnished with small fresh flowers such as violets or panseys,it presents itself amazing.

I think I may have made the recipe incorrectly, but it just doesn't seem right for cheesecake. Most cheesecakes are cooked at a low temperature for a very long time. And typically, when you precook a crust it is only for 10-20 minutes. My crust burned. Apparently, the other reviewers had some success stories, but for me this didn't work out. Also the chai spices are very strong.

Nice creamy cheesecake. The spice was just perfect. I used a 9 1/2 " pan springform pan & there was just the right amount of filling. Would definitely make again.

I halved the filling recipe and made this in tart pan which worked well. The crust is too tedious, a typical graham cracker crust with the ginger added would have sufficed. The filling is good but the Chai flavor is barely discernible, several guests didn't notice it at all. Next time I'll double the Chai spices.

Exceptional!(I must admit I fiddled with the recipe so I don't really know if the unadulterated form is fab!)I cut the flour in the crust in half and used ground toasted almonds instead;ground half of them fine and other half a little more coarse. I also added zest of 1 orange and some juice to the filling. I added 1 egg and 3/4 c heavy cream to the filling and used two 8" springform pans. Definitely a keeper. My guests were oohing and aahing all over themselves...

Excellent cheesecake - everyone who tried it loved it. At first I thought that I put in too much ground pepper, but the taste mellowed after a few days in the fridge and the last few pieces were perfect. The ginger in the crust was awesome - I will definitely make this again!

For anyone who loves the taste of authentic chai tea, I can't see how you could not love this! I omitted the crystallized ginger but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Definitely worth the work!!

I was the only person that enjoyed this recipe. My family and co-workers did not like it. The taste was overpowering for them. This was a lot of work, just like someone said earlier, there are better cheesecake recipes out there.

Delicious flavor and I love the sour cream topping. The crust was good-I used a little less sugar than called for because I don't like a too sweet dessert. Also, don't make the mistake of using a pepper grinder with a large grind like I did. Overall, very tasty. I usually never make the same cheesecake recipe twice unless it is very outstanding. I am bringing it to a bake sale tomorrow and I'll see how it goes!

My cheesecake came out perfect! I used a 10" springform because I was paranoid about having extra batter. I also used fat free cream cheese with the marscapone and fat free sour cream in the topping. I should have omitted the minced crystallized ginger, because I felt it didn't really add much to the otherwise tasty crust and I had explain it to my guests when they found it. I would probably not make this one again unless someone asks for it, just because there are so many other flavor combos to try.

This was expensive and not worth it for the overpowering taste. No one I served it to enjoyed it and I felt like tossing the leftovers in the garbage. There are way better cheesecake recipes to be had. Try Cappucino instead.

Guess I do not agree with most reviews. Found this EXTREMELY time consuming to make and than only so so when completed the flavor was quite good but it was heavy and not a good quality Cheesecake

WOW!! This cheesecake had an exceptional texture and a real spice kick. Depending how you make your chai, it may or may not be redolent of chai. Especially if you use those yucky mixes, it won't taste like chai.

The crust was indeed very gingery, and it was interesting to have a shortbread-type crust instead of the usual graham cracker one. The addition of the crystalized ginger to the crust for flavor and moisture was a great idea, and one I will use again in other recipes. The spices in the cake leaned very heavily toward the cardamom -- it was delicious, but did not really taste like "chai" to me. Next time I would cut out a third of the cardamom, and add some actual loose chai tea to the spice mix for a more realistic chai flavor. Also, the recipe made much more cheesecake filling than would fit in my 9-inch springform pan, so I had to make a few extra mini cheesecakes to use it all.

I agree with the last reviewer that the crust is a bit of a pain and for the work, not that exciting, which is why I only gave 3 forks. It is an outstanding cheesecake and next time, I'm just going to do a regular graham cracker crust. It got rave reviews from my friends who are chai tea lovers. The mascarpone cheese does add an extra creaminess and I may increase the spices by 1/8 tsp each to get just a bit more flavor. We love cardamom so a bit extra will be welcome. Also, I used the same pan size as recipe called for and had no problem with having too much batter left over. It definitely filled the spring-form pan up to the top, but not close enough to cause any spilling. Put it on a cookie sheet to help transfer in and out of oven.

I made this cheesecake twice, the first time with no mascarpone cheese (subbed an extra package of regular cream cheese) and using pre-ground cardamom. The second time I used mascarpone and 2 teaspoons freshly ground cardamom. I think that the mascarpone cheese gives this cake a nice mellow flavor and lets the flavors of the spices come through a little better. Also, if you use fresly ground cardamom, 2 teaspoons is just on the verge of being too much. I'd cut back to 1.5 teaspoons next time. I might also add a little bit of cloves and cinnamon tool, though the spice combination was nice as written in the recipe. The crust is a bit of a pain, and I might use a gingersnap/minced crystallized ginger no-prebake crust if I make this cake again. Overall though, it was an interesting and very tasty cheesecake.

I loved this recipe. My husband made this for me on Valentine's Day. He halved the recipe and made it in an 8 inch pan, which was just the right size. It was absolutely delicious.

This recipe is yummy and received rave reviews when I brought them to a party. I halved the recipe and made 24 individually-sized cheesecakes in cupcake foils with a cardamom-ginger snap crust. I baked them at 350 for 15 minutes, then at 200 for 10 minutes. I didn't put them back in the oven after I added the sour cream topping, and it set perfectly. I topped them with a whole almond and sprinkled the tops with cinnamon. I would suggest eating them the same day, as the ginger snap crust does not stay "snappy."

The flavors of the cheesecake were fantastic. My only problem was the crust. It scorched a bit in some places and stuck to the pan. Hazard of the crystallized ginger, I suppose.

Made this twice. It had a great texture. The ginger and allspice is barely perceptible due to the overpowering cardamom flavor (I used freshly ground seeds). The first time I made this I found my 9 1/2 inch pan to be too small, and I had to pour some batter into a custard cup. The second time I made it I used a 10 1/2 inch pan which accomodated the batter just fine. Am I the only one who had this problem? I don't see how 4 packages cream cheese and mascarpone and all those eggs can possibly fit in a 9" pan. No other reviewer has mentioned a problem with the volume.

I've been very excited to make this cheesecake since it first came out...and finally having made it, I'm pretty disappointed. While the flavor was just fine, it really didn't taste like chai at all (at least as I made it). The crust was quite nice, but very gingery. The cake itself really just tasted like a combination of cardamom, ginger, and some other spices...so it was nice and creamy and tasty, but not particularly cohesive or memorable in my hands.

Everyone raved about this cheesecake! It was a huge hit and the crust was amazing. I am saving this recipe for future events.

In response to the 350 degree oven at the end.......Put the topping on the cheesecake and bake at the 350 setting till firm.....probably about 10-15 minutes.

My modification: a gingersnap-cookie crust instead of the one in the recipe. I did that to save time and effort. Worked well. Texture: Good - dense, creamy. I don't think the mascarpone added anything significant. Flavor: The cardamom was a little overpowering - no real sense of the ginger or the allspice. Not bad, but I'll play with the balance of spices next time. Overall: Well-received, but not raved over. Next time: I'll fiddle with the spice balance, and sub out the expensive mascarpone for cream cheese.

Is something missing? At the end of the recipe instructions I got off of the web site it directs that the chessecake is removed from the oven and then the oven heat is increased to 350 (from 200). What's next?

To Philadelphia PA - Seriously? The spices in the filling are the Chai flavours. I'm glad to see the positive comments. I saw this in my issue of BA and highlighted it right away. Looks so delicious!

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I carmelized pears and placed on top for a beautiful presentation - people loved the creaminess and flavor of the cake. Other than the pears, I followed the recipe exactly. Delicious!

It sounds like a wonderful recipe--BUT where is the Chai? I do not see it listed.

O.M.G.! This recipe combines the best exotic aspects of chai with the most sensuous aspects of cheesecake in a wonderful, memorable dessert. It's pricey, but worth it. Use this for an occasion with no introduction, and I guarantee you people will be mystified by the ingredients. Wow!
