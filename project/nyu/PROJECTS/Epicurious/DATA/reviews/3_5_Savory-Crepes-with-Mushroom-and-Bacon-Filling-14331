Very nice savory crepes. I used a little less mushrooms and added some left over grilled chicken to these. Yum. I added a little chicken base concentrate to the sauce to add more flavor. A thick sauce for the filling is necessary so the filling doesn't ooze out everywhere. Quite tasty. Not fabulous therefore three forks instead of four.

I have been making this for several years now. My family and friends go nuts for it. Even made a batch for a friend going through chemo, she said they were still good after 3 months in freezer, and popped in the microwave.

Loved this recipe! Made the filling ahead on the same day, re-heated a little in the pot before stuffing the crepes and popping into the oven. So delicious, if a bit rich. I did add some wine at the saute phase. I had little bit too much filling for the crepes, but it worked out well. This is a standout!

The sauce is WAY too thick/gluey. I think 1/8 cup of flour would be much more appropriate with the 2tbsp of butter in the roux.

We made this on Mardi Gras and my kids loved it, despite being highly skeptical to start with. I doubled the crepe recipe in order to make enough for 4 of us, and discovered that I did not need to oil our non-stick crepe pan - the crepes cooked better without oil and slid easily out of the pan. Didn't have any mushrooms, so substituted the kernels from one ear of corn that I had lurking in the fridge, and fried up half a green pepper with the bacon to toss in as well. Instead of the cream, I used all milk, and added an ounce or two of grated fontina, for a pleasant cheesiness. Will definitely be making again!

I also just used this recipe just for the basic crepes. This is a really good recipe, but I recommend letting the batter sit in the refridgerator for at least half an hour before cooking. Crepes are always easier to make and more likely to turn out well if you let them sit for a while (even overnight) to get rid of any bubbles formed while mixing.

Great! The second time we added Crab meat and a little cayenne. We drank J. Lassalle Brut Rose' with it. Paired wonderfully. When we make it again we're going to add a little Cognac or Champagne to the sauce and play with the herbs in the crepes. Try it and enjoy!

I've made this recipe every year for Christmas brunch since I first found it. My brother always requests it, and it has become a major family favorite. If done right, this is a fabulous recipe. It is easy to over-cook the filling and end up with an overly thick mess, so pay close attention to it. Go by the look rather than by the clock.

I made these for a brunch I was catering and everyone raved about them. I'd definitely make them again. I added some diced bell pepper to the filling at the very end of the cooking process and they added the perfect amount of punch to the flavor.

I thought this was a pretty decent recipe and good dinner dish if you're looking for something different and open to a fairly a rich entree. I made several changes: * replaced parsley with chives (but topped the final dish with a little finely chopped parsley) * replaced the milk in the mushroom sauce with vegetable broth * left out the bacon from mushroom sauce * added one chopped shallot to mushroom sauce * replaced heavy cream with creme fraiche The mushroom sauce came out beautifully; my crepes were a little lopsided and sad but I improved with practice. I served this dish with a side of smoked salmon with a dallop of creme fraiche and chopped chives. I thought it would make a nice brunch entree if paired with a side of fruit.

I didn't make the filling, only the crepes, which were absolutely delicious! It was very easy. I would suggest using an electric mixer just to make sure you get all the lumps out of the batter. And if you're using just a regular pan, and not a crepe pan, use the whole 1/4 cup of filling to pour into the pan for the crepe, not just 1/8 cup since it will be way too thin. This was a great crepe and very easy!

This recipe was just blah. Too rich and definitely not dinner fare. I could see them as an appetizer. Otherwise, crepes turned out great (my first time attempting crepes). Will use them as a base for other recipes. Will not make the mushroom crepes again.

I won't rate the whole recipe since I only used the crepe batter recipe, but I would give that 3 forks. Very easy. The first couple, as usual, didn't turn out well, but they were yummy to snack on!

The Mushrooms are very good though the sauce is a bit thick and you have to be careful to not let it burn. Crepes are tricky and I don't have a crepe pan so whatever I used only made 4 of them. The filling would never have been enough either but luckily I had doubled the mushroom amount. The first crepes weren't too good but by #3 I guess the temperatures were better.

As per my father's suggestion, I added carmelized onions and used milk. They turned out wonderful!

I made these for a party and they were a big hit. The sauce was thick, but it was great for a party where people were standing up and eating - that way the sauce didn't run all over the place. Very good - I would make these again.

Great flavor but the sauce was a bit thick.

I MADE THIS DISH RECENTLY. I USED CHOPPED SPINACH AND PARMESAN CHEESE ALONG WITH HEAVY CREAM. THEY WERE GREAT! THE HIT OF MY PARTY. WOULD MAKE THESE AGAIN.

I made this dish by adding chopped spinach and parmesan cheese and 2 cups cream (eliminated the step with the flour and milk), and it was absolutely delicious!! I received lots of compliments and would definitely make this dish again!!!

Made a few changes, added frozen chopped spinach and parmesan to the filling, then used the sauce from the Dilled Spinach crepes recipe and it was EXCELLENT! I can't wait to have it again.

it needs personal touch and creativity. it's a down-home recipe made gourmet. try it once, to get the feel of it, then make it your own.

I agree, the sauce was a little glue-like. Added the cheese as suggested but ended up a little too rich. Needs lots of pepper.

This really sings if you add some lemon zest and a bit of lemon juice to the crepes. While you are at it, add a bit of lemon juice and a bit of Worcestershire sauce to the mushrooms. If you want to simplify things, just pour the mushroom mix over well toasted bread. When you make the changes to the mushroom mix as indicated above, this goes from a 3 rating to a 4 rating.

I am French and so I grew up eating my mother's amazing cuisine (which included stuffed crepes), so I was looking foward to tasting that French flavour. I was so disapointed! They were so bland and quite uninteresting, especially for the ingredients. Also, I used a whole package of bacon, and the sauce was so glue-like, none of the flavours came through. Yestarday, I called my mother to get her recipe!

I made this as a starter to a rich pasta meal, big mistake because it is very rich. We wished that we had made that our main course though, it was sooooo good. I added some cheese before folding the crepes, as someone else suggested above, and substituted the parsley for basil in the crepes. Result was amazing!

I made this recipe for my family and we loved it. Even my 4 year old ate every bite(which is amazing!). For some reason I didn't have to simmer the filling to make it thick, it was thick right away. I even added a little more milk because it seemed a little to thick. It came out great though and I think next time I make it I might add some asparagus to the filling.

This dish was simple to make, but truly delicious I would definately make this again

Easy and wonderful. A little bit of grated cheese added before folding crepe wouldn't hurt it at all. Definite make again!
