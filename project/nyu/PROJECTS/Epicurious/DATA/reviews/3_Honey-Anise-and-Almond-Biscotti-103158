I'm sure that the negative comments previously made about overly-gooey dough are a result of the misprint, because I just made these last night, following the recipe exactly, and they came out GREAT! The honey, anise and almond flavours all compliment each other perfectly, without being overwhelming as a whole. The dough is a little sticky, but the recipe does mention to handle the dough with "well-floured" hands, and this rectifies the problem.Make sure to use parchment paper when baking - don't bother with the buttering and flouring. I would suggest watching the cookies during the second portion of baking, when toasting the slices. Seven minutes per side seemed to be too long, as my biscotti was borderline too dark, and I perfer a less toasted biscotti. I would suggest 5 minutes per side, but otherwise, follow the recipe to the letter, and be prepared for fantastic results.

I suggest substituting 8 Tablespoons unsalted butter for the veg oil. Who ever heard of veg oil in biscotti? No wonder they were runny.

Excellent! Quite easy and straightforward, with excellent results. I made the dough the night before, chilled overnight, and baked in the AM for an evening dinner party.

After having to restrain myself from attacking the incredible dough, the cookies were a major letdown. The dough, as other mentioned, was too runny even after I left it in the freezer. During the first round of baking, the instructions to take them out when they felt 'springy' resulted in a final product that had none of the crispness I so wanted for my bottle of vinsanto! Back to Dorie Greenspan for good...

I love the anise and honey in this recipe. I have made it with various substitutions: orange peel vs. lemon, chopped/ground almonds (all I had) vs. whole. The key to success seems to be the refrigeration time (either three hours or overnight) which lets the somewhat soft batter harden into a malleable and manageable consistency.

Even with 1/2 C honey, the dough was just like batter and ran off. Good results regarding taste, but consuistency was quite diffrent from what I expected from biscotti and the dough (batter) was pretty difficult to handle. Next recipe...

This recipe is perfect. I would definately make these again.

From reading the other reviews, it appears that many people made these biscotti using an erroneous recipe. When made with 1/2C honey, they're terrific.

These biscotti are absolutely awful--not sweet enough despite the honey. I am considering tossing them before guests arrive this evening and am currently online looking for another quick cookie recipe.

Fix this recipe! The dough was more like a batter and ran off of the cookie sheet.

I made this recipe before but could not remember what issue it was in. I used this site but when I read the reviews I was confused about the honey issue (1/2 vs 2c). I dug up the old issue and it is infact an error. It should read 1/2c honey. The correct results are superb!!!!!!!!

There is a mistake in this recipe. 2 cups honey should read 1/2 cup honey!

It's hard to tell whether this recipe would be good or not as I think something must be wrong with the recipe. It says 2 CUPS of honey and I think it must be a mistake--it's way runny! It must be 1/2 cup instead.

These are always a hit when I make them for parties, teas, etc.

recipe is precise in amounts and times. takes 5.5 hours from start to finish but is worth it. using parchment paper instead of butter and flour on pans makes it an easier cleanup.may drizzle melted chocolate on for a sweeter treat.
