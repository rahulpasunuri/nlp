We enjoyed this cool recipe. I was looking for a way to use up some fish in the freezer. It was easy to prepare and nice to not heat up the kitchen. I did marinate the fish for 3 hours and flaked it. The spices were a delicate blend and the vinegar seemed to balance the oil in the fish. I did not use the apple, I served it on a bed of lettuce with tomato and cucumber wedges.
