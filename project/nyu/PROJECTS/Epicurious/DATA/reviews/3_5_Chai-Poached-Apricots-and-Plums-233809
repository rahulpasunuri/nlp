If you like the spices in Chai tea, you will enjoy this. I cut the apricots into quarters and added about 1 tsp of crushed star anise. Yum. I like it with plain, fat free yogurt.

Don't expect to be able to spread this compote like jam! It's delicious on thick slices of crusty bread.

very good, made with fresh peaches and didnt use plums. very easy would have been easier if i would have looked at the recipe more carefully when shopping and used dried appricots and plums. very good though. would definately make again!
