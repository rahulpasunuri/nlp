A friend emailed this to me and it has since become a standard in our house. I use vegetable buillon instead of chicken broth, natural crunchy peanut butter (the kind w/o sugar & shortening), toasted sesame oil, and add a little cayenne. Fabulous!!

The mistake I made in moving to the Poconos from NYC was not checking out the Chinese food in the area. It's mediocre at best and most places don't even have cold sesame noodles. Thank God for this recipe. It tastes almost exactly like what I used to get back in NYC.

Cold Somen noodles are a nice choice. If you're feeling all artisanal, lightly toast some sesame seeds and whirl them up in the mini-processor that came with your stick blender. Extra-fresh sesame taste, and fluffy texture. That pepper sauce recipe is a keeper, too!

I doubled the sesame oil but otherwise made this as-is and it was delicious! Even better cold the next day. On the advice of another commenter I added snow peas, carrots, and red pepper to give it some crunch.

This dish is easy and delicious. I took the suggestion about adding 2 tbs of sesame oil to the noodles and chilling before adding the sauce, and it was a wonderful idea. The dish had even more of a sesame flavor and the sauce didn't make the noodles "clump up."

Dry-fry 1lb tofu ahead, and then stir into the sauce. Eat it for lunch all week.

Easy and delicious. We made this into a whole healthy meal by adding julienned carrot, red pepper, cabbage, and snow peas, each just barely steamed or sauteed first, and using whole-wheat pasta. Also doubled the ginger in the sauce and added an equal amount of garlic. This is a great easy meal to serve guests too, because all the colors are gorgeous and it's best at room temperature. We top with chopped peanuts, sesame seeds, and cilantro. Yum!!!

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe. Since we first tried it, it has become a favorite and we make it every couple of weeks. The first time I made it, it was pretty good, but did become really thick and stiff. I tried many different variations of things to "fix" it and found that the recipe is actually perfect the way it is, with only one small change. After cooking the noodles, I toss them with about 2Tb of sesame oil and refrigerate them for at least an hour before tossing with the sauce. It gives an even lovelier sesame taste and the sauce sticks to the noodles but doesn't stiffen up... even after a day in the refrigerator (they never last longer than that!) Love Love Love it!

I love this recipe--and I don't usually bother with recipes! I made only one change: red pepper chili paste (totally worth having in the fridge) rather than red pepper flakes. So good! Don't substitute the vinegar--rice vinegar is my new friend. All the tang, but not so much bite.

This really hit the spot! Like others, I reduced the peanut butter (1/4 c. was plenty - I used chunky). I also grated in some garlic along with the ginger, and I used pasta water to thin the sauce rather than broth. Was fantastic over soba noodles. Served with scallions and julienned cucumber and carrots.

This recipe was disastrous. The sauce only needed to cook for about a minute, long enough for the natural peanut butter we used to soften. I let it "thicken" a couple more minutes and it turned into a hard paste. Eventually I had to add a whole cup of extra broth to get it soft enough to mix with the noodles. I used soba, per other reviewers' suggestions, and would NOT do that again. It all fused into a gloppy mess in the bowl; though it tasted fine I'd try another recipe before trying this one again.

I made a few substitutions the last time I made this dish to use what I had on hand. I barely had a quarter cup of peanut butter, buckwheat noodles really kicked up the flavor, ginger powder worked instead of fresh, and I toasted the sesame seeds. Some leftover diced chicken and cubed, freshly picked heirloom tomatoes made it a meal.

This recipe has become my go-to easy summer meal - served with grilled chicken breast, fresh cilantro, scallions and cucumber- it's pure heaven. I reduce the sugar to 1T, and add 1/4c PB and 1/4c satay peanut sauce. Added bonus when it's 92 degrees outside: it can be made in the microwave - cook 2~3 minutes (or until thickened), stirring every 20~30 seconds.

Rating: 4
Very simple and delicious. As a native New Yorker in Salt Lake City I get cravings for chinese food and this recipe helps me quell those cravings and saves me money all at the same time. Tastes as good as at my favorite chinese restaurant at home. I did make some modifications; I added fresh garlic, and used sriacha in place of the dried red pepper. I also add fresh shredded raw baby cabbage to the bowl to be tossed with the pasta & sauce. But that's because I seem to be on a cabbage kick lately.

Made everything the night before (stopped short of adding the sauce) and kept it in the office's fridge the next morning for an evening women's bible study. As advised, cooked noodles al dente, rinsed it thoroughly in cold water, coated it with 1 T sesame oil. When ready to serve at the meeting, simply added sauce and tossed. Many second servings and compliments.

This recipe is so much like the sesame noodles you get at a Chinese restaurant. I thought it was delicious. Used all the leftover noodles including some whole grain, some thick, some thin. I absolutely love peanut butter, but those who are not total peanut butter fanatics might want to use 1/3 cup instead of a 1/2 cup of PB.

My three year old son loved making this with me, and stood over the bowl as I mixed everything together, eating it by the HANDFUL. Gross, maybe, but high praise all the same! I made stir friy veggies first - garlic, peanuts, carrot, red pepper, and several heads of bok choy, and tofu; then I doubled the sauce; I found there was too much peanut butter so I added fresh lime and MILK. I wasn't sure about that but it was actually very good - made it creamier and, if you are trying to sneak calcium into a child's diet, why not? Garnished with cilantro and cucumber. Any dish that causes a three yaer old to say "bok choy is dawishus" is a winner in my book!

I like the sauce but the noodle broke a bit and ended up being mushy. Would use the sauce on other applications.

I'm originally from NYC and have had some of the best Chinese food around. I was very impressed by this recipe. It was INCREDIBLE! In fact, it was better than any CSN I've had at restaurants. At first, I had left out the vinegar and broth because I didn't think the recipe sounded right with them. When the sauce came out way too thick, I ended up putting in the broth and vinegar after all. I'm so glad I did. This is the best recipe for Cold Sesame Noodles I've ever tried.

Super Yum! My husband and I loved it and the kids gobbled it up. Made it just as written with the exception of adding chunks of cucumber, chicken and shrimp to make it a meal. PERFECT to make ahead for a summer time dinner. Very very good! A new favorite for my family.

Rating: 4
This was a very easy recipe to make. My 4 year old niece had a lot of fun helping me make it. I didn't have red pepper flakes on hand, so I used the powdered kind instead... worked just fine. One word of advice: if you think you'll have leftovers, garnish each individual plate with cucumbers rather than in the dish itself, because the cucumber will get soggy in the leftovers. By the way, this tastes even better the next day!

Rating: 3
Very good. I recommend making as written, tasting and altering to taste. I found I wanted to up the peanut butter and brown sugar both a little (not much!) and then I had just the right amount of sauce and it tasted just as I wanted it to. Very nice easy dish that pretty much replicates what you get at your local Chinese restaurant.

Rating: 4
I gave this 4 forks with the following alterations. I used whole-wheat linguine and grated two small cloves of garlic into the sauce ingredients. I doubled the sauce save for the peanut butter, and I used 1/2 cup pasta-cooking water and 1/2 cup vegetable broth to thin the sauce. To the noodles and sauce, I added julienned carrot and red bell pepper, snow peas, sliced Szechuan marinated tofu, and sliced scallions. I garnished with crushed toasted peanuts and toasted white sesame seeds..

Rating: 3
This is a really great base recipe. I did make some adjustments. I added garlic to the sauce, sauteing it along with the ginger and pepper flakes before adding the other ingredients instead of just dumping everything as the recipe calls for. I cut down slightly on the amount of peanut butter and reserved a cup of pasta water to add to the sauce to thin it, as it thickens really quickly. I used wheat linguine and rinsed the noodles after draining, this seemed to prevent the sticking others mentioned. I garnished this with cilantro and lime and highly recommend it: the added freshness really elevates the other flavors!

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe was very good. Like previous reviewers, I decreased the amount of peanut butter. I also added a little garlic. I will be taking this to a picnic and will add grilled chicken and fresh chopped peppers and cucumbers. One thing I did to avoid drying out the noodles: I made the noodles and then refrigerated them overnight. While making the sauce, I tossed the very cold noodles in cold water and drained them before adding the sauce.

Rating: 3
My favorite chinese take-out dish and first attempt actually making it. The result was very tasty, flavorful and spicy while not being overbearing or too heavy/oily. The keys to success w/ this dish are (1) to double the recipe for 1 lb. noodles - otherwise, not enough sauce, (2) rinse the noodles in cold water immediately after cooking, then toss with a coating of sesame or peanut oil then let them sit before tossing w/ sauce - this should prevent sticking and prevent the noodles from absorbing the sauce later, and (3) start with about half the peanut butter and add it gradually to taste - you don't want it to overwhelm the other flavors. Also, I substituted a medium red chile (deseeded, deveined) for the pepper flakes, gives it some nice heat - add the chile gradually if you are concerned about the hotness. I served this at a BBQ and had no problems with it turning gummy or absorbing the sauce after being put out for a little while. It was also a big hit, and will most certainly be made again.

I followed the recipe to the end and just tossed a whole julienned cucumber and 3 chopped scallions into the whole thing. Very good. I'm looking forward to playing with this recipe again and again -- perhaps adjusting the quantities of peanut butter, sesame oil, and red pepper; adding carrots, broccoli, jicama, sliced napa cabbage, or other vegetables; etc. I'm having the leftovers for lunch today -- can't wait!

Rating: 3
This is a good starting point for sesame noodles, but like many of the other reviewers I felt some changes were warranted. I used extra ginger and somewhat less peanut butter. I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I liked how it came out, but it was a bit too salty/unbalanced and I added some extra sugar at the end, which helped. Next time I think I will replace the broth with water to cut down on the saltiness.

Rating: 4
I found this a bit too peanutty the first time I made it but after I made these adjustments, it was a major hit. Double the amount of all ingredients for the sauce except the peanut butter (leave that at 1/2 cup). Add julienned strips of cucumber, red pepper, green onions and carrots for crunch and color and add sliced grilled chicken to make it more of a meal. Seriously addictive and perfect for hot summer nights!

Rating: 3
This was great -- a less unctuous version of the Chinese restaurant classic (although I guess the reason it's swimming in oil when you get it is to keep the peanut sauce from totally absorbing into the noodles). Try just 1/3 c. peanut butter and add a little more if you think you need it as you cook. I used half crunchy half smooth, both "low fat", upped the ginger and red pepper flakes, and topped it with slivered red pepper, green onion and carrots in little "piles" and a smattering of sesame seeds -- looks beautiful and you can toss at the table. On the side simple sliced cucumber seasoned with rice vinegar and extra sliced veggies for the weight-conscious (like me) to add to the noodles (try putting a pile of them under the noodles and toss to get the peanut sauce over them). Delicious!

Rating: 3
To avoid having this dish dry out; drain, rinse and re-drain your noodles (I use fresh chinese egg noodles), toss with a teaspoon of sesame oil and refrigerate for at least an hour. Shortly before you are going to serve, toss the sauce with the noodles and add you cucumber and scallions. It is really delicious.

Rating: 2
Very simple to make but once the dish came to room temperature, the noodles absorbed all the peanut sauce and the result was very dry.

This is delicious and the closest I've come to the "authentic" cold sesame noodles I used to have when living in NJ. I add grated garlic to the sauce and leave out the red pepper - those who like it hot add hot sauce or red pepper flakes at the table. Jicama makes a nice change from cucumbers sometimes, too. I've made this with just the sauce, and it still tastes great. Make sure to give the pasta a good rinse with cold water -- this will prevent it from clumping, getting gooey, etc. Deeeelicious!

Rating: 2
The flavor of this recipe is good...but the gloppy texture was, frankly, gross. I don't know if that was caused by the sauce or the egg noodles I used. I have made other sesame noodles before that were so much better...so I would skip this one and look further.

Rating: 2
I liked the crunchy cukes and subtle minced (not sliced) scallions on top of this dish, and I finished my bowl. But I wouldn't make this again -- because, mainly, life is too short. This may be unfair, but I generally don't repeat recipes whose leftovers I don't relish the thought of gobbling up the very next day. If I'd rather leave 'em in the fridge, I figure why bother. And the leftovers from this dish literally left me cold. Wondering if any other cook uses such a criterion...

A definate keeper. I used Reeses peanut butter and it was excellent! Also sauteed some chicken slices up in a tablespoon of sesame oil and cooled before adding. Next time I think I will try using baby scallops prepared the same way. Delicious. I'll definatly make it again.

This recipe was OK but I also made one of the other Cold Sesame Noodles recipes from Epicurious at the same time to compare the two recipes and I found that I liked both recipes very much when I mixed them together. This recipe was cooked and came out to a nice consistancy but didn't have garlic in it and it is very difficult for me to cook without garlic. The other recipe I tried had garlic in it both wasn't cooked but blended in a processor and came out runnier than I liked. So by putting the two recipes together I was very pleased with the favor.

While I might use this a a guide to play with, I won't repeat this one. I felt that the sauce was too salty (and I use low sodium soy sauce) and too peanut buttery (sticky). I will most likely use other recipes, or significantly alter this one (e.g. seriously decrease the amount of peanut butter, and possibly cut down on the soy sauce. I'd also use water instead of chicken broth, and do the garlic thing suggested by others). Thanks for the broccoli suggestion; that sounds good.

I practically lived on this stuff in the summer and was so disappointed when I couldn't find it after I moved away from NY. I was thrilled when I tried this recipe. Like others have said, it needs a bit of tweaking, but it's really delicious and reminds me of the "cold noodles" I used to get back home. I double the sauce and add a clove or two of grated garlic and a bit more ginger. It really is best chilled -- let the pasta portion get nice and cold, then toss with the room-temperature sauce. I use soba or spaghetti. Wonderfully addictive!

Rating: 3
It didn't turn out like a noodle dish I'd get in a chinese restaurant, to be sure. But it had a nice taste. My complaint is that it came out a bit heavy and sticky (too much peanut butter?). And it could definitely have used some vegetables -- I like the broccoli idea. That said, it's a super quick, super easy dish.

Rating: 3
I agree, as written the FDA would label this flavor-free. add an extra 1/2 t. ginger, extra T. brown sugar, juice of 1/4 lime, 1 clove garlic. And it's really, really good. Make sure to use szechuan crushed pepper (a wet paste) rather than dried perrer. Yum.

Rating: 3
I make a slight variation of this--I just guesstimate amounts on the sauce ingredients, with less peanut butter and no chicken broth; I also sautee a chopped garlic clove in the sesame oil before adding everything else. I throw broccoli in the pasta water during the last minute of cooking and toss everything with chicken marinated in soy and fresh ginger. the noodles do get a little dry after sitting for a minute (especially if you don't use all the sauce, which I generally don't because it's pretty strong) but I actually really like the dry effect. Yummy and most of the stuff is just sitting in your pantry.

Rating: 3
This was very good. For the cook's critique before this: it is not a good idea to add sauce to pasta & then let it sit. As you found out! Pasta is like a sponge & will just keep absorbing all the sauce you give it, until you have a glooey mass/mess. I cooked the pasta 1 minute before al dente. In other words, about 1 minute before it's supposed to be done. (Soba, in this case) in the early a.m. (hot day today) & tossed it with 1/2 of the sesame oil. It kept the noodles separated plus the hot pasta absorbed the oil flavor. I made the sauce & set it aside in the fridge. At dinner time, I pan-grilled a marinaded flank steak, reheated the sauce, added Asian cukes & dinner was on the table! Husband & I did need a conversation dealing with the fact that peanut butter can go on something else besides toast. He bought it! One half recipe of sauce is plenty with 4oz of soba noodles that served 2 of us.

I made the dish virtually exactly as written (relatively unusual for me). It came out dry as a bone, and tasting of very little except perhaps of some traces of Jiffy peanut butter. I did, however, make it earlier in the day, refrigerated maybe 3-4 hours, then took it out of the fridge at least an hour before serving to bring it back up to room temperature. This could have contributed to the dryness. Still, if I was to make it again, I'd double all the sauce ingredients, but only increase the peanut butter by 50%. And I'd be sure not to make it earlier in the day.

Wow. I loved this!! Cold Sesame Noodles are my favorite thing from Chinese take out. I guess I can save some money now :) REALLY easy. As suggested, I tossed the pasta with some sesame oil to prevent sticking and I doubled the sauce, which was good, because I think it could have been a bit dry if I didn't. I used this as a side dish to Sesame Chicken, but there is alot left over. So good I think I would serve this to company, (maybe just the friends that don't care all that much about presentation).

Rating: 3
I've made this a couple of times now after tasting it at a potluck and requesting the recipe. My favorite presentation was for a luncheon--I served the plates with the noodles on the bottom, ringed with cold steamed snow peas and topped with a cold poached chicken breast. It looked beautiful with a little julienned carrot over the top of the whole thing.

Great! You may want to add something to it to make it more of a meal, though admittedly I didn't find that to be the case. Definitely toss the noodles with a little bit of sesame oil to keep them from sticking and soaking up all the sauce. I used udon noodles in my version, and it was awesome!

Fortunately I read the reviews before preparing and used oil in the boiling water as well as adding extra sesame to the noodles before mixing with sauce.

I always read them before preparing an Epicurious recipe and find them very helpful. Oh, for someone not into piquant, cut down on the pepper.

This was a very tasty recipe, with the exception that the noodles were a bit dry - as someone mentioned, they absorb a lot of sauce. Next time I will toss a very little bit of sesame oil over the pasta in hopes of making it less gummy. I substituted vegetable stock for chicken (a tablespoon of powdered to the 1/2 cup of hot water), eliminated the sugar and used chunky peanutbutter, which I thought made for a more interesting texture. I also used capellini instead of linguine.
