I lost this recipe many years ago. So glad to have found it again and look forward to making this again.

Have made this countless times to rave reviews! Comes together quickly and easily. Spray ramekins well, and run a knife around sides before unmolding, then turn ramekin over onto plate and bang slightly on counter and should come out easily. Dust with cocoa powder. A definite keeper!

i made this recipe 3 times before i finally served it to guests. I had trouble unmolding it all 3 times. the first time i made it i buttered the custard cups vs using oil. They did come out of the cups but not perfectly. The next time I did exactly as the recipe stated and oiled the custard cups. Again, they did not come out easily. Finally, the third time i made them in straight sided ramekins, oiled them and they did not come out AT ALL!! They were very very tasty though so I will make again. I doubt though if I will try to make them come out of whatever dish I use, I'll just serve up "as is" with coffe bean garnish. My guests did love them inspite of not coming out of the ramekins.

Excellent and very rich. I served it with Chocolate Hazelnut Biscotti (Bon Appetit 11/99). It unmolds well but not perfectly; perhaps buttering the ramekins instead of spraying them would work better.

This is easy, impressive, and delicious. I have been asked for the recipe several times.
