Wonderful flavor, elegant! A favorite in my family for years.

I make this several times a year always to rave reviews. I think one whole pear in puff pastry is a little too rich. I cut in in half and serve it on a bed of baby greens and drizzle a little mustard vinaigrette over it - works great! The vinaigrette contains only red wine vinegar, olive oil, dijon mustard, salt and pepper - nothing else.

This was one of my few misses from these recipes. It was so heavy. My pears may not have been ripe enough--there was nothing sweet tasting about it. A big disappointment.

Not a bad recipe, but the puff pastry does substantially shrink making it less than attractive. Also found it pretty dry - it would definitely benefit from a fig or raspberry sauce

If I could give it a few more forks, I would!! Am making again tonight because its so good. This will be made many, many more times! (I used gorgonzola instead of roquefort.)

I made this based on all the rave reviews. We did not like it. I think it turned out OK, but it was not worth the effort. I would have liked the stuffing served as a spread on a raw pear or apple maybe.

Wonderful - skipped the walnuts though...my family adores roquefort so this was a wonderful "last" dish. If you know anyone who loves cheese & isn't a real dessert lover (as in no sweet tooth) this is a pretty ideal treat! I'd also use it as a light lunch meal with a side salad. Its super easy for delicious results!

I served it as a munchie at a cocktail party with french crusty bread. People LOVED it and wanted to know where I got the recipe. IT seems a bit much as a first course.
