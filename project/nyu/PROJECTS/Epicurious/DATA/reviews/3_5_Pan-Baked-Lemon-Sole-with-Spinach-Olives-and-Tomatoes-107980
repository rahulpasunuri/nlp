To make it a bit quicker I used crushed tomato sauce, heated in the saucepan first then transferred to baking dish. F.Processed olive paste, fresh basil, anchovy paste and garlic. Go easy on anchovy paste, I ended up using too much...overbearing fishy taste. Maybe 1/2 tsp anchovy paste would be sufficient.Omitted spinach altogether.

I really thought I would like this dish - it has so many ingredients that I love. I found it too salty and too wet. If I were to make it again, I would cook the fish for 12 instead of 15 minutes - parts were definitely overcooked, and the fish will probably continue to cook while you're wilting the spinach. And as far as that goes, I would just saute the spinach separately next time - I don't see the point of drowning it in the tomato sauce. I would not add sea salt to the tomatoes - all of the ingredients have plenty of salt in them already.

This was really easy, tasted great and looked good. I put it on top of spaghetti squash mixed with a little parmesan, basil and butter. It tasted great with the tomato sauce and fish. Kids loved it too. Will definitely make it again.

I rate this 4 because it's lovely, perfect for a houseful of dinner guests, delicious, fresh, hearty and light. I used three times as much basil (ready in my garden), and i used fresh tomatoes (also from the garden, romas that i roasted and blended). I'm talking really, really good. Served with a side of homemade fettucini with nothing but olive oil, parsley, garlic, crushed red pepper and peccorino romano, along with a bright salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Loved it!

I really liked this dish! I made it for a 7 person dinner party, and it was really easy to cook while entertaining. And it impressed everyone. I used dover sole and a pre- made olive tapenade (with chopped fresh basil) to cut down on preparation. Make sure to use just a little smear of the olive mixture, otherwise it can easily overwhelm the fish.

Just okay from my experience. I used petrale sole - no lemon sole to be found. The fillets were about 3 ounces each so I bought 2/per person - big mistake because everyone only ate one. The fish AND sauce lacked flavor. The sauce ingredients looked a little bland but I thought the tapenade would spice it up - not enough to improve the result. I pureed the sauce in hopes of it becoming thicker but then the addition of spinach to the sauce was quite odd to begin with and only thinned the sauce more.

This turned out really good and light. I skipped the anchovies (didn't have any), and used low-salt Turkish black olives. I didn't use any additional salt since the saltiness from the olives and fish was enough. I used dried basil instead of fresh and added some fresh parsley into the olive mix... 15 minutes bake time was perfect. My husband and I both loved it.

I used dover sole and added leeks to the garlic and tomatoes....served with red potatoes and roasted cauliflower drizzled with balsamic. Great, easy dish

Excellent flavors and easy to make! It also works well with a more robust fish like tanigue.

I made this last night for three guests and was really happy with how it turned out. I used dover sole fillets (skinless) instead of lemon sole and found it perfect, unlike other reviewers who used the lemon sole. I skipped the anchovies like others, if only because of the high salt content in the olives. I also used an olive mix from the fresh olives section of the market. Instead of whole canned tomatoes, I used 28 oz of diced tomatoes from Contadina and added in about 6-7 grape tomatoes for some sweetness... I served with some israeli couscous (added a little white onion and sauteed garlic for flavor -- no salt) and some sauteed asparagus. Delicious!

We liked this dish a lot and I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I didn't have any fresh basil on hand so I used some store bought pesto to put in the paste. Also used kalamata olives because that is all I had on hand. The fish did come out too flaky but everything had good flavors, the sole was thin. Easy to make and tasty. No spinach either so you don't have to follow exactly. Worth making.

I didn't use the anchovy or the olive and it was a great dish. With those two items I think the flavors would have been too much

Rating: 0
Don't be tempted to use the entire amount of olive/basil mixture just because you have it as it will overwhelm the delicate fish and ooze inky black into the tomatoes. A mere smear is enough to impart flavor. Mix store bought olive tapenade and a squeeze from a tube of anchovy paste with minced basil and you will cut down on time spent in prep and clean up with the same tasty results. Also, the spinach yields much liquid, so next time I would definitely saute the spinach separately, drain the liquid and add to sauce. Or, any even nicer presentation would be to place sauteed spinach in the center of the plate, top with sole and drizzle tomato sauce on top and around the plate. Serve with piping hot crusty bread for a "cioppino-like" dish.

This dish didn't work so well for me. Sole is a very thin and delicate fish; I found that the olive tapenade completely overpowered it in taste. I also found the dish difficult to prepare since the fish is thin and kept ripping. I would not make it again.

Very good. I used flounder, skipped the anchovy and substituted an olive tapenade for the whole olives - which just meant i didn't have to dirty my food processor. Would make again.

This is a good recipe. After reading other reviewers' comments (thank you!), I used sole, but skipped the anchovies and put the black olives (sliced) into the sauce before baking, rather than into the fish. The filling became a simplified pesto and didn't overwhelm the sole. I also laid the spinach, uncooked, in the bottom of pasta bowls and let it wilt with the addition of the red sauce and sole. A very good weeknight meal and good for casual company, too.

This recipe sounded so good but...I only had the sole, frozen spinach and lemon of the ingredients listed. I was out of ideas so I thawed the spinach on low heat, to evaporate the liquid and added onion, garlic and dried jalapeno flakes. Sprinkled the sole with fish seasoning and rolled. Using a cast iron fry pan with a little olive oil. Put in the spinach and scattered a few bread crumbs to soak up any extra liquid. The rolled sole went on top of the spinach with a sprinkle of lemon juice and a brush of melted butter and paprika. 18 minutes at 400 degrees. Time enough to make hollandaise and a shrimp, corn, cucumber, relish, Rice would have been really good with this, but I was out of that too. I share this because it shows that a recipe with good 'bones' can be varied in different ways and still deserve 4 forks.Thanks Jamie...this is a keeper!

If I had to make this again, I would not use sole. The olive and basil mixture completely overpowered it. I might try it again with a thicker fish. There is way too much liquid if the recipie is followed. Would not make this again.

Excellent!! I followed the recipe exactly using petrale sole. I can't believe anyone could have disliked this. My only regret was that we didn't have company for dinner to show it off to - presentation was beautiful! Even my 2 and 5 year old boys liked it. Will definitely make again and again.

Good flavors and a great fish dish you can prepare ahead of time. I found the sauce a little watery, next time I will cook it longer.

I have tried this recipe many times and been pleased with the results. I substituted capers for anchovies. The presentation is great. Great fish dish if you are tired of having salmon and halibut all the time.

Rating: 2
The only reason I gave this only 2 forks is because I like my fish more done than this. If I had left it in 4 minutes longer, it would have been great. Beautiful presentation, especially if you use rosemary sprigs to stick in each roll of fish. I used kalamata olives instead of black. I also used some parsely. Substituted capers for the anchovies.

Rating: 3
Any dish involving fish that makes my 'anti-fish' husband say WOW is great in my books. Will definitely be making this again...it was so easy, and the timing of the steps was perfect for the in between prep. I used Kalamata olives instead of black olives because I love the flavor.

Rating: 3
This is very easy and tasty. I threw the spinach into the gratin dish with the sole and tomatoes. Presentation is nice. I don't know why some reviewers didn't roll up the fish. It takes the same amount of time to cook. Go esay on the salt since the brine cured olives are salty.

This was fun to prepare; an interesting twist on the normally bland sole. Changes i made: i cut back on the oil a bit, and used onions instead of anchovies. Added salt as omitting salty anchovies made it necessary. Overall a yummy healthy dish.

It was delicious and easy! I had just bought some beautiful gray sole and looked up a recipe on Epicurious. I was in a hurry so I used a jar of Trader Joes' bruscetta sauce. I used a little anchovy paste from a tube and frozen basil from last summer. I did not have spinach But sauteed some chopped kale with garlic, a little westphalian ham and a little reduced balsamic vinegar.

Although I've used this site for years, I've never commented on a recipe. This one is fantastic. A nice change from sole menieur. I used 6 fresh roma tomatoes and an 8oz can of tomato sauce (& no anchovies as we didn't have any on hand). My husband and I both loved it and will make it again!

A good dish with nice flavor. In the end, though, as my brother put it, it was a bit like eating pasta puttanesca and fish. Without the kick from the red pepper flakes I usually put in puttanesca. I made both the tomato sauce and the olive paste the night before to let the flavors develop, so work the next day was a cinch. I don't think I used 5 oz of spinach because 1 28-oz can of tomatoes does not yield much sauce. I suggest going lightly with the olive paste, esp. if you use the pungent cured black olives that you find in olive bars at gourmet grocery stores and doubling (at least) the basil. I did the latter and still think I could have used more -- the olive flavor was somewhat overpowering. This would certainly be a good dish for company since it's quite easy, as Oliver notes, but it really didn't impress me too much. Also, is lemon sole a larger fish than petrale sole? There were no 7-oz filets of the latter! The biggest was maybe 5 ounces...

My husband & I are great couch potato fans of Jamie Oliver, but this is the first recipe of his I've made. It's delicious, simple and has lots of different flavors going on. I also substituted capers for anchovies and the result was fantastic. Time for me to get off the couch & start trying a few more of his recipes.

This is a fantastic recipe with a fabulous presentation. Serve with rice pilaf or a crusty baguette to dip in the sauce. I used San Marzano tomatoes (canned) which added a lovely sweetness to the sauce.

FABULOUS! My husband loves fish and tomatoes but he hates olives -- I, however, love olives so I made it anyway! Guess what -- he LOVED this dish. Said the olives were yummy and not too much for him. I thought they were soooooo good with the fish and the tomato sauce was delicious. My only change was to omit the spinach at the end, only because I didn't have any on hand, so I added some fresh chopped parsley and it was just great. Lovely, colorful presentation with minimal effort. I'm sure this would work with many different types of white fish beside sole. Will make millions more times!

Well, let's see, my husband said to me- "Save this recipe!". I personally used Orange Roughy-although, I think any flat white fish would work. I cheated a bit, as I had an Olive Tempanade which I used and I omitted the anchovy, though I do have an anchovy paste that probably would have worked. I followed all other directions EXCEPT-I had a huge bag of fresh spinach, so, I had enough left over sauce to make several cups worth of the spinach and tomato mixture. I served this with, the Creamy Rice w/lemon, herbs and Parmesean, which was the PERFECT side-dish, as the rice/lemon picked up on the tomato and spinach. Overall this was a HUGE success in our house, and trust me, my husband is a restaurant owner, and a picky eater who likes~ "only the best". We even are thinking of serving this combo as a "special" at our restaurant. PS: very little cleanup for such a great meal.

This was so easy and the fish was excellent. In 2 seconds you have these cute fish rolls and they are yummy. You can prepare them in advance but why? In his cookbook Jamie secures the fish roulades with a sprig of rosemary.

EXCELLENT! I was looking for a fish recipe with spinach and came upon this one -- my husband wanted to know why I made such a nice dinner for a Monday. The store didn't have lemon sole so I used flounder. It was restaurant and company quality and so delicious. The contrast of colors was beautiful. I served it with a timbale of whole wheat couscous and a salad. I'm definitely making this again!

This is definitely a recipe I'll have to make again. We used tilapia instead of sole because of price and availability, but it was still quite amazing. The tapenade was great and rolling the fish up around it preserved infused the fish with its flavor nicely, as well as making sure it was nicely tenderized in the oven. Yum!

This was great! I used snapper and did not roll it up. I also did not add anchovies to the paste but added a bit of salt and a little bit of olive oil. My husband loved it over couscous.

Tasty dish and so easy to cook using one pan for both modes. This is a dish that might appeal to those who say they don't like fish. The other flavors dominate, and the fish is really just a foil to them. But, that can be okay, as it is here.
