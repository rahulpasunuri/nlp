If you liked eating playdough as a kid, this is the cookie for you. I couldn't have found a way to make this cookie more palatable...my boyfriend, however, suggested adding blue food coloring (or red, I whichever your favorite playdough color is). This is the first time in four years that I have found a recipe on this site that I hated, so I count myself lucky. Make yourself lucky and don't attempt this.

Suprisingly, these cookies are absolutely delicious. Will definetely make these again.
