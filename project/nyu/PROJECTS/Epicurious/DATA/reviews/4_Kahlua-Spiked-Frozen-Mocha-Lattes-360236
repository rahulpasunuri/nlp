I really enjoyed this recipe, but I usually prefer warm coffee-flavoured drinks. I found something similar that is equally delicious, and warm. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/AMARULA-COFFEE-SURPRISE-50174355

These are very addictive and I pretty much drink them daily in the summer. Yum!

These tasted delicious, and just the right size. However, my coffee cubes did not freeze like ice usually does, they were sticky, so it seems if I make some way ahead to keep in plastic bags in the freezer, they will all stick together. Did anyone else have this problem?

I skipped the kahlua and just added some milk when blending and they still turned out wonderful. Having the frozen cubes sitting in freezer is great for a quick on-demand frozen latte!

Delicious! Great combo of flavors and love the creamy texture. The only drawback was that the espresso kept me up that night.

Delish! Made it this afternoon and my husband wanted another one two hours later! I love that you can make the ice cubes ahead of time and keep them in a ziplock in the freezer ready to blend up in a sec.

Very yummy with some of our homemade Kahlua. Great treat!

This drink is really good! I didn't read all the instructions before I made it, so I didn't realize that you have to freeze the stuff first. Instead I just put everything in the blender with ice. I substituted instant coffee for instant espresso powder. The only complaint that I have about this is now my husband bugs me to make this for him daily.

I have made these twice and they are wonderful. So easy to make!!! I think they are best if you make them 3-4 hours ahead and keep them (in coffee mugs) in the freezer.
