I didn't have Heath Bars, so I ended up using Butterfinger bars in their place and I thought this turned out delicious! More of a dessert than a breakfast food, but it was moist and not too heavy.

This was delicious--very rich with the Heath bars on top. I don't see how anyone could say that this could be sweeter; I can imagine that some would find this to be too sweet!

This coffee cake was moist and easy to make, but bland. I did use Heath chocolate toffee bits,instead of chopping the bars and am not sure if this made a difference. I did toast the pecans, as suggested by other reviewers. I don't think I would make this again.

This was sooo delicious! I toasted the pecans a bit as other reviewers did, and used Skor bars. This was just fantastic. So much so that my young daughter snuck into the kitchen and ate the topping off the rest of the cake. This recipe is a keeper!

I was honestly a little skeptical about toffee on my coffee cake. I thought it might be too much, but it was great! I think it would be good without the toffee as well if you didn't happen to have it on hand (P.S. I used the Heath toffee pieces in a bag instead of the candy bars and that worked really well). I think this will be my new "go to" recipe for coffee cake.

I usually try to do something more "elegant" for brunches, but this gets constant rave reviews (especially from my boss). I bake it in a 9-inch springform so the topping is thicker. I've had particular success with pouring half the batter in the pan, topping with 1/3 of the toffee mix, then adding the rest of the batter and toffee.

ABSOLUTE DELIGHT-A KEEPER-I USED A BUNDT PAN AND COOKED IT A LITTLE LONGER ABOUT 45 MINUTES, ALSO GRILLED THE PEACANS A LITTLE.NICE AS A CAKE AND ALSO AS A BRUNCH DESSERT

We all enjoyed this cake. It was best the second day. I used 9 x 13 pan and had to sub Hershey's Miniature Nuggets-Extra Creamy Milk Chocolate with Toffee and Almonds candy. Still used pecans. My cake was not low like a bar, finished product was approx 2" high. Maybe be extra careful not to overmix like recipe suggests, that may make the difference. I would make recipe again.

Good, but could be sweeter.Used an 8"x12" pan. Ends puffed, but not middle. Left some toffee in big pieces. Next time, I'll use more topping and mixture.

I used the other reviews and decided to bake it in a spring-form and also double the candy bar topping and added some semi-sweet chocolate as well. The result was a FABULOUS, moist coffee cake with a sweet topping. A big hit with all and the simplest recipe ever!!

I'VE MADE THIS RECIPE MANY TIMES AND COMMENTED ON THIS BEFORE SO IT WAS INTERESTING TO READ REVIEWS SINCE THEN~I MADE IT IN THE SUGGESTED 9X13 PAN WITH EASE BUT MY FAVORITE IS STILL A SPRINGFOAM DESPITE THE CHALLENGE TO REMOVE IT FROM THE PAN. THE 9X13 IS RATHER SMALL RISING-NOT THAT THE SPRING FOAM IS THAT TALL BUT PRESENTATION IS BETTER. HOW ANYONE CANNOT LIKE THIS RECIPE IS BEYOND ME AND I SUGGEST THEY GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY!

Made it exactly as written and it was loved by all and gobbled up in no time. This cake is low, like a bar so next time I'll try doubling it for more height. Loved the topping and the quantity was just right.

Wow, I hate to be different from the crowd, but I just didn't like this recipe that much. My husband tried it (without knowing whether I liked it), and the best he could say is, "It's ok." The topping is pretty good, but the cake is just missing something. It just isn't as good as most of my coffee cakes. I may, however, occasionally add a chopped Heath bar to other coffee cake toppings.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Instead of a rectangular pan, I baked this cake in a 10.5" springform pan. It stayed in the oven for 40 minutes and came out just right. It was a hit with my co-workers and I will definitely be making this again.

Rating: 4
I should have doubled the recipe, it was that good. I used Toffee McGreevey made with pecans(from this site), which I have handy, chopped quite small. Only used the brown sugar; otherwise too sweet. The taste deepens the next day, sigh ...pecan and brown sugar ... mmm. Go on, try it.

Rating: 3
This sounded like it would be too sweet with the dark brown sugar and white sugar, but it isn't. I make my own English Toffee (with walnuts) for Christmas, so I used it in this recipe and stayed with walnuts, rather than pecans. This will probably be a regular for Christmas.

This is a dangerous recipe!!!! It is soooo delicious that if you are making it for company,you better freeze it or there will be nothing left! I now make it in small loaf tins, so that if I have another couple over, it's the perfect size for 4 people. If I make the big one, I know who will eat it until it's gone! I consider myself a good baker, and this is a winner! It's EASY, a no fail recipe, and yummy!

I've made this coffee cake many times since it was printed in 1999. I'm surprised by some of the negative reviews--don't let them scare you away from making this one. I (and my family) think its GREAT! I've always used 1/2 c. toffee chips and 1/2 c. milk chocolate chips because I usually have these both on hand and I follow the rest of the recipe as stated. The buttermilk is what gives it such a moist crumb. I do like the idea of toasting the pecans first which I will do next time. I've passed this one on to many relatives across the country.

very simple to make and delicious. i used a smaller pan and also substituted milk for the buttermilk. i love the topping-it's so crunchy-and it goes really well with the moistness of the cake.

One of my family's favorites and so easy to make! Adding a little cinnamon to make the batter more flavorful is the trick.

I love toffee bar and coffee cake so I thought I'd love this but found it to be unimpressive. The cake and candy combo didn't seem to work well and while it was sweet, it really had no flavor.

Rating: 3
This cake is a good snack when you're craving something really sweet with coffee at 3pm. The topping is a little heavy for the amount of batter. Use less topping so you'll get a better topping/batter ratio. It's quick so it's a good backup when you don't have any sweets around.

Good. Very sweet. It does improve with age.

Rating: 4
TERRIFIC! So incredibly quick and easy to make! I ended up using a 9 by 9 inch pan rather than 9 by 13 as I reserved a full cup of the coarse crumb mixture for the topping rather than the half cup so I didn't feel that the remaining batter was enough to fill a 9 by 13 pan. Like previous reviewers, I used Heath bits instead of chopping up candy bars for efficiency. Bake for a full 35 - 40 minutes or the middle will be slightly soggy in a smaller pan size. A real keeper in my book.

This cake was a hit at two diferent brunches. I had "toffee bits" to use up, so I sprinkled on some semi-sweet chocolate chips to replace the chocolate that would be in the Heath bars.

I too used Skor bar instead of Heath. A delicious recipe and so easy! Nice and moist cake.

This cake was wonderful!! Very moist, and delicious. I toasted the pecans before adding them to the topping, and I think that made all the difference! I thought that 4 bars were just about right, although I used Skor bars, instead of the Heath.

Dunno why I thought this would be gooey, but it was crunchy on top. I should read the recipe more closely! At any rate, it was quite tasty and hard to stay away from. It was also quite easy to make.

We enjoyed the topping. Did add the extra toffee per recommendations. The cake itself is not glamorous to look at. We drizzled some melted semi-sweet chocolate to make it look a little more attractive. Overall was a hit.

Brought it for the office and the cake was devoured within a couple of hours. Everybody loved it. The Heath bar pieces really make the cake; next time I'm going to up the amount of candy bar going in. Or maybe sub with Toblerone, another favorite of mine. Very moist, crunchy and tasty.

I must have a beyond normal sweet tooth- this recipe was very mediorce to me and those who ate it. I soley made the recipe because of all the great reviews- reading the recipe itself I doubted it would be as good as everyone raved. It was OK at best- I actually made it twice. I was not crazy about the texture either. Oh well.

Delicious! I made this in a tube cake pan and cooked it for 35-40 minutes. Found the amount of toffee and topping to be just the right amount. The crunchy topping seemed to also go to the center as well so it was moist and candy bar throughout!

MMM! Very moist and yummy. The center collapsed (oops, forgot to adjust for altitude) but made it even denser and contrasted with crunchy top. Made it a day ahead - it was hard to wait for!

Very quick and easy. Tasted wonderful and everyone loved it and swore that there was a "ton of butter", because of the great, buttery, rich taste. Just like the last reader, I also just used toffee chips, and mini choc. chips, because that is what I had. Try!

I loved this recipe. I found it easy to make and absolutely delicious. I was able to use homemade toffee that I had made using almonds. I just added more toasted almonds instead of the pecan. I look forward to making this recipe again.

This cake is delicious. I cannot imagine eating it for breakfast, brunch or a snack cake it is wonderful. My whole family loved the toffee flavor and my guests went home with my copy of the recipe. I can bet that my Mother-in-law who is the best baker will make this for her friends. Now that's a winner recipe.

Rating: 3
This was tasty, but not as good as I had hoped based on the reviews. The batter was a little thin so next time I will add 1/4 c. flour (and 1/4-1/2 tsp. cinnamon--was missing something). The nuts on top tasted a little raw to me so I will lightly roast them before chopping, and reduce the amount to 3/4 cup. I increased the toffee bars to 5--might even add more next time--it is what "makes" this recipe. (Plain toffee would be great too!).

Rating: 3
This cake was a snap to make & turns out perfectly. Also comes out of the glass baking dish very easily. Cutting the slices cleanly is more of a problem with all those nuts on top, so a sharp knife is a must. Cooking time was just right. The cake layer is a little light & lacking in 'oomph' for my taste but the toffee/nut layer does help to balance this. Altogether a nice, basic coffee cake that works, though possibly not the most interesting one I've ever made.

I made this for breakfast over the weekend and it was gone that morning. So good!! Everyone loved it!! I had to add a tablespoon of cinnamon to the batter, I couldn't help it!! It wouldn't seem like coffee cake, without the cinnamon!

I loved this recipe. It is very sweet, but "everything in moderation". I used toffee bits instead of the candy bar and it came out great. I also made it in a bundt pan, and think next time I'll put some of the "topping" in the middle also.

Easy to prepare. Sweet, but not overwhelming. Moist but not greasy. A real hit at work. I halved the recipe (though I still used one egg) and used a 7"x9" pan and used the same baking time.

This coffee cake was very successful at a women's church conference. It was not used for the continental breakfast but instead was saved to serve as a special dessert during the pastor's wive's luncheon. I was asked for several ladies for the recipe. If you are looking for something a little different from the ordinary-this is the answer. I prepared this recipe the day before it was needed and baked it the next day. It was very moist and sweet! It would make a delicious teacake!

I was disappointed with this cake. It was dry and I found that the nuts overpowered the toffee. Next time I would decrease the amount of nuts and increase the toffee. Or maybe bake it in a bunt pan with the toffee mixture in between the layers of cake. Maybe that would work, but will try it next time.
