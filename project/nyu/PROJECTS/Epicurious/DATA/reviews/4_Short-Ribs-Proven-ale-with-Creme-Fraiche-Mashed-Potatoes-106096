A great recipe for short ribs that I have made many timees. I omit the olives and herbes de Provence and use more thyme. Always a hit and easy to boot. A gremolata is a refreshing augmentation. The cook time can be flexible - up to an extra half hour with out compromizing quality or flavour. I have completely made it the day before and warmed it up to serve for real speed on a busy day.

I only began making short ribs last week, starting with a barbeque recipe, which came out sooo good that I wanted to try another recipe this week. Well, I am so glad that I decided on this, as I love this recipe even more, and I will make it again and again. I only prepared three lbs. of short ribs, with three small sized carrots, three quarters of a large onion, one celery rib, and I used one and a half cups of Coppola red zinfandel, which in my opinion is a great zinfandel for cooking beef. This truly tasted better than some meals which I have had in high end restaurants. My daughter rarely eats red meat, and she actually had seconds. Great recipe!

I read the reviews before making this recipe and took the advice of one reviewer to serve the beef with polenta. I made a basic polenta recipe adding gorgonzola & rosemary. I skipped the last step & did not add carrots & olives. It was fantastic!!

This is that classic braised short rib recipe I have been looking for! Its relatively easy and so delicious. I did store it over night as the recipe offers, and there was a huge amount of fat that rose to the top and coagulated (disgusting!). It was very easy to "chip" off the 1/4" of fat and discard. The bones seperated from the meat after the first 2 hours of cooking, so ultimately they were boneless to serve. I strongly recommmend this recipe and its great for company since you can make it the night before.

This was so delicious. I omitted the olives and used a combination of herbs de provence (mine had lavender in it) and italian herbs. I also used a combination of boneless short ribs and bone in to save some money yet still get the flavor from the bone. I could not believe how good this smelled and how wonderful it tasted. I would not consider myself a cook which may or may not be obvious from my lavender comment but you would never know it after tasting this dish. It was easy to make and is definitely a keeper.

This was excellent. Tender meat with the flavors of the carrots, celery and garlic were a huge hit at a dinner party. Pretty much followed the recipe as suggested with great results. The potatoes are a perfect compliment to the meat.

I made this for Valentine's Day this year, and I was very disappointed. I followed the recipe very closely, and yet after all the work I thought that the meat and the "stew" that went with it was more or less flavorless and fatty (from the short ribs). The mashed potatoes were about the only thing I liked.

I adore this recipe. I prefer the boneless "short ribs" from Costco as they are leaner. Tonight I served it with polenta and that was amazing. I decided to broil the meat at the last minute while the sauce was cooking down. Also, used an immersion blender to make a smooth sauce -- this works as I omitted the olives and removed the carrots and meat. I never have beef broth on hand, so use chicken. I am starting to feel guilty that I haven't made this for my best friend!

Rating: 4
This recipe was easy to make and tasted better the next day. I used boneless short ribs and veal broth instead of the beef broth, and I cooked the ribs for a total of 4 1/2 hrs (2.5 hrs the first night, 2 hrs the second). I added the olives prior to cooking the ribs the second night, which gave the ribs much of its saltiness. I also removed about 1/2 of the cooked broth/gravy from the pan, added a bit more salt, and reduced it for about 45 minutes prior to serving. I'd definitely make this again for a dinner party, as it's easy to prepare ahead and reheat the next day.

I made this recipe for my wife, and she absolutely loved it. I am far from being a good cook, but the directions were simple, and the dish turned out perfect. My wife couldnt believe the smell was coming from our flat.

I've been making this dish as one of our favorite comfort stews since it first appeared several years ago, but prefer using a 4-lb chuck roast which I cut into 12-16 very large chunks, each approximating the size of a short rib. Less fat, less waste, more meat, and more economical. I also eliminate the extra 1/2 cup of water, and use pitted Kalamata olives. Go easy on the salt, as the olives provide much of the saltiness in the dish, and definitely do reduce the sauce down after removing the solids. One of my favorite tricks during that last stage is to add a tbsp or so of honey - it adds a glossiness to the sauce, and helps cut the acidity from the tomatoes. Just had this again last night and it continues to delight.

Rating: 4
Wow, this was so delicious! I omitted the olives and didn't have bay leaf, but otherwise I stuck with the recipe and it was remarkably good! I made it for a dinner party and everyone cleaned their plates. I trimmed as much fat from the ribs as possible and that made the dish less greasy.

We made these for Christmas dinner and our guests couldn't get enough of them. They were so easy and wonderful. We cooked then at 275 for about 4 1/2 hours and they were so tender. Left them in the fridge overnight and then before reheating for dinner, we skimmed all of the fat off. We also skipped the nicoise olives. Served over the Creme Fraiche mashed potatoes. Would make these again every day.

I forgot how yummy these were. Don't change a thing. Definately make them a day ahead- the hardened layer of fat is thick, even with less fatty ribs. Reheat and simmer down to thicken-no need for the extra broth.

This meal tasted wonderful. My only complaint has to do with the fat of the ribs. It was a bit much. I am going to try this recipe again using a roast and see how that goes. Also, I used a burgundy wine instead of the zin (by accident!). It came out great. The creme fraiche potatoes go beautifully with the wine in the sauce.

Finger-licking good! My little oven wouldn't fit anything bigger than a spring chicken, so I braised it on stove top, at the mildest simmer possible for 1 H 45 mins. The short ribs were melt-in-the-mouth tender and the sauce was of perfect thickness, no broth needed in the end. Couldn't think of a better main course for a family gathering.

Nice hearty comfort food! Delicious.

Rating: 4
A sensational dish! I'd recommend using boneless short ribs, since the meat falls off the bones anyway and then the meat requires a lot of post-cooking trimming which is awkward. I didn't use the final 1/2 cup of broth. I did need to boil down the juices for thickening.

I made this yesterday as a trial run for a dinner party I am having this weekend and OH BOY was it delicious. And not difficult - just long. I used boneless ribs (oxymoron?) from Costco because my hubby bought them and I figured I need to do a trial run anyway. This weekend I will use the real thing - short ribs. I also made the creme fraiche mashed pototoes and they were also good. I will do the whole thing all over again on Friday night for Saturday and hopefully I will get the same great result.

My first time with beef short ribs and I'm glad I went with this recipe...it is really good!!! Used an All-Clad roasting pan with lid about 10 by 17. It allowed all 12 rib sections I used to be in one layer. Will certainly be making this again.

I made this for the jewish holiday of succos. I used 3" flanken because my buthcher believe it or not did not know that wide cut flanken is called short ribs. I also substituted chicken broth for the beef broth. Being kosher, I couldn't use creme fraiche with the potatoes, but the ribs are so full of flavor nobody missed it. Everybody loved it. The meat melted in your mouth. They scraped the bottom of their plates. The leftovers were unreal too. I'm still dreaming about eating them. I can't wait for an occasion to make them again!

I like the Stout Braised Short Ribs recipe on this site better. This recipe does taste a little like pot roast mixed w/ olives (not a bad taste, just different).

Oh, I really, really enjoyed this. The meat was so tender, so flavorful. I served it with smashed red potatoes. Made for terrific leftovers as well. One guest did, however, comment that it was, "a bit rich." Yes, it was filling, but no one forced him to eat so much!!

Rating: 4
This dish has been a favorite since it first appeared two years ago. Since making it the first time with short ribs, I have since preferred to use a 4-lb. whole piece of chuck roast from Whole Foods which, when cut into about 14-16 large chunks, approximates the serving size of a short rib. More meat, less fat, and meltingly tender. Any good red wine will do, the additional 1/2 cup of broth is unnecessary, and reducing the sauce down after removing the solids truly enriches the flavors.

Made this first time and used mostly short ribs with bones and some boneless short ribs and found it too greasy and fatty but thought the dish deserves another chance. Made it for a dinner party using lean (cut out as much fat as I can) boneless short ribs and it turned out awesome and everyone loved it! This is one of my favorite dish and it is extremely easy. I also prepared it the night before I served it. But if you don't have the time, making it the day of is also very good!!

Served this last night and it was a big hit. I seared them really well and cooked the ribs for about 2 1/2 hours the day before, refrigerated them overnight and scraped the fat off the next day. Served with the potatoes, which were great (no surprise, given the fat!). It's a little less than 4 forks, but well worth doing again.

Excellent short ribs. Trimmed them of most of the fat - seared them well. Drained almost all of the fat / oil before cooking the vegies. Baked for 3 hours then put them in the fridge overnight. Cooked them with the carrots for another 30 minutes (no olives). Very, very good. Made plain mashed potatoes (dish was rich enough). Will make again.

Lovely dish. I made it in the morning, and then left in the fridge for a few hours, and took off the fat (it would have been really greasy without this step). Then I simmered with the carrots and olives. It was wonderful, and even better the next day.

Rating: 4
Had never made short ribs before and these were so good I'm hooked. Mine were very meaty and the dish wasn't greasy at all. I roughly halved the sauce recipe for a little over 2 lbs of ribs, but did the full mirepoix, which made for a chunky (and delicious) sauce. Umbrian table red left too long in the fridge, kalamata olives -- I was leery of the olives but they were fabulous -- and (gasp!) grocery mini-carrots worked just fine.

A very tasty dish and really quite simple to make. I agree with other reviewers in that I would recommend making it ahead of time and cooling to remove the fat that made it a little too rich for me when eaten right after making it.

It was nothing special. I made it 2 days in advance, used great beef, great wine and great beef stock and followed the recipe exactly. Potatoes were blah, maybe some garlic mashed would jazz it up or serve w/polenta. The pretty little carrots gave it some color but it wasn't an attractive presentation.

Rating: 4
This recipe was delicious. The ribs were incredibly tender. I did not add the remaining broth, as instructed, because I felt that there was more than enough liquid. Any more, and it would have been too watery. Also, be sure to season the ribs well (before cooking them). The stew was very tasty but the ribs themselves needed a little salt. While it takes a long while to cook, the dish itself was easy to prepare. But the results were impressive.

As an experiment, I tried this recipe to make a pot roast, using two eye of chuck roasts, about two and a half pounds each. I substituted a cabernet sauvingnon for the zin (it was on hand and already open), and didn't need the half cup of broth at the end. I refrigerated the dish overnight, took the grease off the top the following day, and added the carrots and olives when reheating. My favorite pot roast recipe, and very fast and easy.

This is absolutely delicious and surprisingly easy to make. Love the fact that it can be made the day before and improves in flavour. One minor quip though -- it's not the most appealing looking dish to serve guests. Serve it for more casual get-togethers rather than a swanky dinner party.

Very simple to make, and absolutely delicious. Two keys - use high heat to brown the ribs, and try and make TWO days ahead. All the flavors just intensify with a couple days in the fridge, so very worthwhile!

I made this recipe exactly as written and would change nothing. The flavours are deep and rich and perfectly blanced. I would STRONGLY recommend making it at least one day before serving as a lot of fat solidifies on the top with refrigeration. As with any braised dish, it only tastes better the next day or even two days later. Loved it!

This is wonderful, dark, rich and sexy. Make sure you get the best Nicoise olives and pit them yourself before adding to the stew. Also, difficult to find baby carrots, so use organic and cook for a few extra minutes.

With my local butcher featuring short ribs for $1.99/lb, and a bottle of good Zinfandel on the wine rack, this recipe was heaven-sent. Even better the next day, and the third. Instead of canned tomatoes, I used an equivalent amount of chunky marinara sauce, and did not find the additional 1/2 cup of broth necessary. While reducing the sauce, I added a tbsp of honey - a trick I learned years ago to add depth and gloss to a sauce. Incredibly satisfying.

Rating: 4
Very good dish - short ribs came out great. Important note to season the short ribs WELL before browning since I felt that the meat itself could have used a little more saltiness that could not be achieved by adding the salt into the stewing liquid at the end. I served it over parmesean polenta but I would love to try it over mashed potatoes next time. I would definitely make this again and this dish is definitely a keeper.

We're sitting out Hurricane Frances, the storm which won't go away, and dug some farm-raised venison spare ribs out of the freezer. Hunted around for a recipe and used this based on all the raves, and we agree ... Tremendous!! Made a half recipe, baked for almost 3 hours, and the meat (which is quite lean) melted off the bones. We didn't have the olives but didn't miss them, and had to (oh, the shame) substitute instant mashed potatoes with plain yogurt - can't run out to the store!

This was an easy and tasy recipe for guests. The one thing I would do differently is definitey make the day before, refrigerate, and then skim off all the fat on the top before reheating again for company. The day I made it for my guests there was a lot of fat from the short ribs, but the day after when I ate the leftovers and could take the fat out it was much better.

I've made this recipe numerous times - always a success! I like cooking it for about 3 hours - meat falls off the bone. You do have to add more liquid so I use 3 cups of beef broth, a full bottle of either Zinfadel or Cabernet Sauvignon and I top it off with a tablespoon of demi-glace that has been mixed into a half cup of hot water. A great combination of flavors that really gets the job done.

I made this dish immediatley after it seeing it on the cover Jan. 2002. I just skimmed the fat as I went along and everything turned out perfectly. My guests devoured every bit and serving it over the mashed potatoes just made the dish.

I have prepared this recipe several times for company and had rave reviews. I omit the olives (just don't like them) and use crushed tomatoes for a smoother sauce. I have come to like this over cheddar polenta instead of mashed potatoes, but either preparation is really tasty. Good make-in-advance idea for entertaining. This cut of meat is also quite affordable at my grocery store when I buy in large quantity, which allows me to spend more on wine!

I hate to be one of the ho-hum types here, but honesty propels me to such. This is a good recipe, but it shows no new wrinkles on the ages-old process of braising beef. This is just pot roast plus wine, which makes it, essentially, boeuf bourguignon. Add olives and herbs and it becomes Provencal. Use short ribs, and you get to pay more for less meat and more fat. I'm not looking for an epiphany in every recipe I prepare, but I'm not sure what the fuss is about. This is a good recipe, very satisfying, and everyone ate it right up. But next time I'd use chuck or stew beef.

This winter I have been braising something different almost every weekend (lamb shanks, osso bucco, short ribs, etc.). This recipe sounded good and the final results were great! I would say the most important step is to make sure you brown/sear your meat before braising-also ask for a "flanken" cut on your ribs-2" in width-this gives you the ability to plate a two rib section that looks great (and I think they cook better)

I served this dish to my book club and it was a huge hit... people were clamoring for the leftovers. I followed this recipe almost exactly with the exception of the cooking method. I got everything ready to the point you put it in the oven, but instead I slow-cooked it in my crockpot for seven or eight hours on low. At that point, I refrigerated it so that I could get rid of the excess fat, then reheated it the next day, adding the carrots and Nicoise olives (which I pitted myself... what a pain). Superb results, however, and raves. Everyone wanted the recipe. What an excellent recipe.

This was fun! It took a while to cook... longer than I'd planned, but no one minded. The sauce was especially yummy, and I had TONS left over! The mashed potatoes were a huge hit, too.

I am going to cook this for the second time. I am using Niman Ranch Short Ribs. I didn't change a thing for this recipe. I bought baby carrots with the leaves still attached, just like the picture.I used frozen beef broth. I never use canned broth. I can find all the great ingredients. Nice living in a city. This is on my favorite list to serve company. Wonderful leftovers.

Yes, this meal is a lot of work, but as they say...good things are worth waiting for. Just buy a couple extra bottles of Zinfandel to drink while you wait! This is a perfect meal for a chilly Autumn day. It's even better the next day! Yum!

One of the finest "stick to your ribs" winter meals I have ever prepared. Three suggestions though: First, substitue brine cured black olives for the Nicois olives(it will make your life easier). Second, double up on the veggies(you will understand later). Third, if your ribs are not completely covered before baking use 1/2 red zin and 1/2 water mix to cover(the stock will be much more flavorful).

This is a great and wholesome dish. Too bad it is impossible to buy pitted nicois olives and next to impossible to pit the puny devils!

I love this dish! I've made it several times before and it is always a hit. My variation on this is dish is to strain the braising liquid after the 2 hours in the oven and before adding the remaining broth, baby carrots, and olives. The chopped vegetables in the braising liquid are pretty much spent and all flavor is extracted...it's a little more work but, it makes a more elegant presentation.

I have made this dish twice before for the same couple, who request it all the time. Now that it's cold in the Northeast, it's time to make it again for tomorrow's dinner party. I add more garlic,celery and olives. This is an awesome dish!!!

Just made this great dinner(perfect for a cold fall night)for myself and my husband who kept moaning about how tasty this dish was. I added more garlic cloves since I love the soft garlic pulp with the meal. Also, when the meat was done, I took them out as directed, defatted the sauce, and thickened it with some cornstarch and water (mix these two ingredients first before you add a little at a time to the sauce). The meat was very tender and fell off the bone. Next time I might add some quartered onions, potatoes, etc. at near the end. Definitely a keeper!!!

This was fantastic! I made it for a dinner party and it was a big hit. I cooked it at least 3 hours and it was meltingly tender. I made it the day before as suggested in the recipe and skimmed off some of the fat before reheating. I served it with buttermilk mashed potatoes. It was perfect for a cold fall evening.

I'm making this dish tonight, to serve tomorrow. It smells great, I'll de-fat as a lot of you have suggested. If any of you can tell me this,I would appreciate it.. I made creme fraiche (equal parts heavy cream and sour cream) tonight, then realized it's supposed to sit for 12 hours at room temp, then at least 3 days in the refigerator. Do you think it will be ok? Should I just leave it room temp the till tomorrow? Thanks. lornawilliard@aol.com

This is a great and easy recipe. It also works vary well for beef shanks. I like to build up the volume of sauce a bit more than the recipe calls for. Also, if you cook an larger portion or don't think you will need all that is called for in the recipe, don't worry, freeze the remaining - the flavor continues to be excellent

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe-if made correctly-I used flanken cut ribs vs. conventional short ribs-they have far less fat and are meatier. You must use Zinfandel or you will use the nuance of the Zin taste vs. other red wines. I would add the carrots the last 30 minutes to be fully cooked. I added slightly more butter and creme fraiche to the potatoes-but you want the potatoes a little stiff since they will blend wonderfully with the rich sauce.

Great Dish although the Beef Ribs were not worth the effort to locate / cook. I have made it since twice using a Chuck / English roast and it works out excellent. If you / yours are roast people - this is well worth making !

This was my first attempt at making short ribs and the recipe was easy to follow. I like fare that tastes good as well as looks good. This recipe does both. I will definitely try this one again, however next time I will search out the short ribs days in advance. It was not so easy to find them. My primary grocery store (major supermarket) only carries them occasionally. I would recommend to anyone call ahead for short ribs.

I love short ribs and this recipe was delicious. At the final stage, I removed the short ribs and added cooking time to the sauce which finished the carrots. I'm health conscious so I also degreased the sauce.

First, I halved the recipe to serve 2 with leftovers. After browning the ribs, I put them and all remaining ingredients in my crockpot for 10 hours on low. Falling off the bone tender and didn't have to think about it all day. Skimmed the fat off the top and then reduced the sauce before serving over mashed potatos. Really good.

We have made this several times for guest and everyone loves it. It is fairly easy to prepare and delicious. We typically cook the dish for 30-60 minutes more to ensure that the ribs are falling off the bones. We serve with horseradish mashed potatoes which are a hit as well.

I made this dish for a dinner party and it was a BIG HIT. I made a few modifications....added some chopped up bacon with the sauted veggies to give the dish a subtle smoky flavor and added mushrooms instead of olives at the end. Use a good wine definitely. The ribs and wine were pricey but worth the $$. I served it with sauted spinach, garlic mashed potatoes and crusty french bread. Yummers!!!

My family loved this dish. I thought the carrots needed a bit more time than was allowed for. I have made it with both bone-in and boneless ribs and while both were good, the bone-in had more flavor. The olives are a great addition.

We love short ribs and this recipe was excellent. I couldn't get to Fresh Fields so I just used the little, peeled baby carrots offered by the local grocery store. Wasn't quite as snazzy looking as the picture because my carrots were more pedestrian, but tasty nevertheless. I did have to simmer them longer than the 15 minutes suggested by the recipe to get them to the tender stage. I didn't make the mashed potatoes they suggested but instead made a baked fontina cheese mashed potatoes from another issue of BA instead. The whole meal was a big hit. I'm keeping this recipe on hand.

Rating: 4
Yum. My husband and I were having friends over for dinner but were going to be gone most of the afternoon. I put the meat in the oven at 300 degrees for about 5 hours. When we got home, we had enough time to throw in the carrots and olives (I used kalamata), make the mashed potatoes and toss a nice salad. Piece of cake, delicious and I can't wait for the leftovers tonight!

Rating: 4
My mom didn't alter anything...well she used kalamata olives and I must say that the evening she served this we all REALLY overate!! Mom has always done wonderful short ribs, but this will become the "new" standard. The sauce on the mashed potatoes was fabulous!! I don't usually do "gravy"...but I was the last one at the table. Very very good and would have recieved a higher rating if you'd offered more forks!!

Rating: 4
Excellent! A great make ahead company recipe. I made the Creme Fraiche Mashed and they were awesome with the short ribs and sauce. I added extra chopped onions and carrots, and used 18 cloves of garlic. After the initial baking I used packaged baby carrots and doubled the amount. OH SO GOOD. Next time I will make it a day ahead and skim the fat off not because it altered the flavor or great result but to make it a little healthier.

This is a great Short Rib recipe. I changed it a bit though. I added 1 extra carrot & 1 extra celery. I used the following spices. 5 sprigs fresh thyme & 2 teaspoons dried basil. I strained out sauce after cooking and tightened with roux. I would make it the same way next time, it was so good. Burgundy works as a substitute for Zinfandel.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved the ribs (and the mashed potatoes). In the end, all of the rib bones were sitting on the bottom of the pan. The meat had slid right off. When I make it again, I might boil the sauce down to a thicker consistency.

Although I didn't make the mashed potatoes, I thought the spare ribs were delicious. Very easy, good flavor. I dislike olives immensely, but put them in anyway. They really just add a richness to the dish, but after so much cooking the olive itself doesn't even taste too strong. Unlike the previous review, I would actually add even more carrots, but that's really personal preference.

This was very good, but not terrific. I wouldn't put in so many carrots

This was the bomb! Absolutely wonderful winter fare. I didn't have baby carrots so just added 2 additional chopped carrots. Do use real Niçoise olives - the taste is worth the hassle getting the pits out compared to a handy can of "industrial" pitted black lives. Also do make sure you skim off the fat (a benefit of making it a day before and cooling is it makes the fat easier to remove). And of course the creme fraiche mashed potatoes were sublime.

This truly is YUMMY! We aren't olive lovers so I left them out but followed everything else. My company loved them! The mashed potatoes were good and like other cooks I added a little milk to get them creamier.

Used the two day method and some venison. Loved the flavor of the sauce. By the way, I used the immersion blender on it and it was nice. Omitted the baby carrots at the end and just used large chunks for the intial carrot addition. As I rarely get them, I always forget how good cooked carrots are. Sour cream for the mashers and it was a great meal.

FANTASTIC FLAVOR - I made this dish twice now, last time for SuperBowl Sunday (25 Guests) - Everyone Loved it! I braised the ribs for about 20-30 minutes which seemed better. I also mixed short ribs & prime rib (wanting more meat for the company. I added both the ribs of the prime rib and large chunks of the meat (cutting them 2-1/2" in thickness and about 3-4" in diameter). It was the best meal I have ever eaten! I know there is a high amount of fat in Short-Ribs, but the flavor from the fat & bones is unsurpassed!!! Bravo!

Rating: 4
Excellent! Truly a "comfort food". I lost my issue of Bon Appetit and was thrilled to find the recipe on the internet. Will make it again and again, the only thing I will change is to par boil the baby carrots prior to putting them into the oven with the ribs. Thanks for a great meal!

Started this yesterday, and skimmed fat as suggested and finished for dinner this evening. It was good, not great. Give me a GOOD Beef bourguignon any day, more flavor and a lot less fat. Even after having the fat lifted off, this is a heavy, greasy dish. Keep in mind that shortribs used to be an economy cut, used by people who couldn't afford better meat. They are no longer priced in the economy category. There are better cuts for the money. I really enjoyed the process, and wouldn't give up the chance to make them once. Thanks to Bon Appetit for that opportunity. I would just rather eat a good pot roast or beef bourguignon, than this.

Rating: 3
This is wonderful, easy to prepare, winter comfort food. If all ingredients are readily available - great. If not, it's very easy to modify. I've made the potatoes with sour cream and creme fraiche. In both cases I added some milk (or cream)to achieve the consistency we like. Also, I like to cook the potatoes with two cloves of garlic, put them through a food mill and then add some prepared horseradish. Really goes well with the short ribs.

I've made this twice already. It's easier than the short rib recipe I use to make, and tastes just as good. The ribs are incredibly tender, the "gravy" is wonderful. For the herbs, I just used basil and thyme and quartered regular carrots because I can never find baby ones. I have not made it with the olives. Everyone loves this and I'm here right now to print out recipes requested because I made this for a dinner party this weekend.

This is a wonderful, hearty winter dish. I had a chuck roast I needed to use and substituted it, cut into large cubes, for the short ribs. I ended up baking it a bit longer than the recipe called for and the meat was really tender. I strained the liquid and reduced it instead of serving it with all of the vegetables and it made a wonderful sauce with the potatoes. Definitely a keeper! I'm anxious to try it with short ribs.

Amazing dish! A very hearty dish with lots of flavor. Not a huge fan of herbs de provence but didn't mind it in this dish. Would definitely recommend making it a day ahead...can skim off quite a bit of the fat and it tasted better the second time around.

I prepared this exactly according to the directions, planning to serve it for a special dinner, given its designation as recipe of the year. With less than an hour until my guests were scheduled to arrive, I found that there was so much grease in the pot that I couldn't bring myself to inflict it upon my friends. (I made an emergency pasta recipe instead, using things I always have on hand, including tomatoes, olive oil, artichokes, and the olives that were supposed to go in this greasy stew.) After a few hours in the fridge, the thick layer of fat was easy to remove, and I served the defatted dish the next day. It was good, but not great, and by no means the best I have tried this year!

Rating: 3
I made this for company for a cold evening, and it got raves (and requests for the recipe). I made some changes based on previous reviews: I made it the day before to chill and remove the fat, and I used fairly lean beef shanks instead of short ribs (same price as short ribs, but leaner and more meat less bone), and used a gourmet assortment of olives which included Nicoise. I didn't bother to pit the olives, since a sensible person wouldn't simply bite down on an olive assuming it to be pit-less; besides, it sparked some amusing conversation along the lines or how-do-you-do-this-gracefully...I served it with garlicky sour-cream mashed. It goes in my keeper file. Oh, and the olives are not optional.

Rating: 3
My husband and I enjoyed this dish very much. I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of the mashed potatoes, which I made with butter and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of creme fraiche. I agree with a prior comment...the fat needs to be skimmed off and is easier done if the dish is made a day before. Also, the sauce needs to be cooked down before serving. Don't leave out the Nicoise olives...the contrast of the olive taste really adds flavor dimension to this dish. Comfort food... and wonderful on a cold February evening with a nice glass of Merlot.

This is the first Epicurious recipe that has inspired me to write a comment...It was absolutely delicious. I am a classically trained chef, and one tip is to make sure that the braising liquid is very well seasoned before putting the ribs in the oven. It's hard to make up for the lack of seasoning later. Completely yummy. Try it!

This was one of the best recipes I've ever made. Period. I can't say anything but good things about it. It was easy, delicious and it was a hit with all three of my sons and my boyfriend. The potatoes are fantastic. The flavor is subtle but savory. This was GREAT! I will make it again and again. Will serve to guests and my family! I made it as listed with one exception - I used boneless ribs.

This has great flavor, but must be defatted. Cook a day ahead as recipe says. Scrape off the fat before continuing. I made root veggie mash with mine. A comfort dish

Looked like very good comfort from the picture on the cover, so we tried it. It was oh so rich and fatty. Those who took the fat off were ahead of the game. The creme fraiche mashed potatoes were not to our liking, so they detracted from the dinner. Leftovers with mashed potatoes were excellent. We got a bit of a glaze on the ribs and the carrots, and they were delicious. Once again the fat, though.

We made this within days of the magazine hitting the mailbox...and loved it. I, too, was aghast at the price of the short ribs but it was worth it for a comforting Sunday dinner. I didn't find the nicoise olives and substituted kalamata instead, with good results. As far as the amount of fat on the meat goes, my feeling is that this is a throw-caution-to-the-wind recipe, especially with the creme fraiche potatoes, so ignore it and enjoy.

Rating: 3
I thought this was the epitome of comfort food. My husband loves anything with a bone, :) so I made it for him, but enjoyed it myself. My only complaint was I found short ribs to be 1> expensive and 2. very fatty. Otherwise, It was a great dish and a beautiful presentation. I couldnt find those cute carrots so used the baby carrots in a bag, worked fine.

Rating: 4
This is a superb recipe. I made it twice, the first time using ribs w/the bone and the second time using boneless ribs (Costco sells them for 2.99 pound). I bought a 6 1/2 lb pkg (smallest one they had) and trimmed at least a pound of fat off. The boneless ribs were much better. They were every bit as tender -- literally melt-in-your-mouth tender -- and had a lot less fat (hardly any solidified on top like it did w/the bone-on ribs). Both times I made this, I did so over a period of two days. I would highly recommend that. You must use the nicoise olives. They really add a wonderful flavor. I could not find any pitted, so it was kind of time consuming to pit a bunch. My cherry/olive pitter was too large for those little olives. This is, as they say, a permanent "keeper." Yum!

Rating: 4
This was good, followed it pretty much as written, and even made my own Crème Fraîche. I unfortunately could not obtain the right olives so went for the best substitute. Yes, I am a food snob and proud of it! My husband is darn picky and I asked him if it deserved the high rating, it did, I didn't care, I was too busy enjoying it. I do note that short ribs are expensive, so next time I'll try it with a cheap cut of pot roast. There is no reason to pay too much for what should be inexpensive meat, the slow long cooking tenderizes it well. Overall it really is good with those fattening, but delightful potatoes!

A cook from Oxnard, CA. I tried this recipe before reading any reviews. This recipe is a keeper, as my husband says. I cut the recipe in half in case we didn't like it. I used all of the ingredients except for the olives. I could not find herbs de Provence so I just used the spices in the recipe and made my own. I used sour cream instead of Creme Fraiche. The grocery store did have the Creme Fraiche but it was expensive. I plan on making this recipe for company and will buy the Creme Fraiche. The ribs were not hard to find, but were expensive. While this was baking in the oven the whole house smelled so good. I do plan on cooking the meat one day ahead to skim off the fat. The juice from the meat blends well with the mashed potatoes. This is definitely a meat and potatoes, stick to your ribs meal! Just wonderful!

Rating: 3
This was a tasty treatment for short ribs. Tenderized the meat nicely---actually, most of the bones fell off. The carrots could have used a few more minutes in the oven; recommend putting them in for 30 or so minutes. Halved the meat quantity, but made the entire sauce portion, so we have a delicious base for soup or something else. We enjoyed it, but I'm not sure I'd make it again.

Rating: 3
Wonderful flavors! I added small red potatoes and baby carrots after 2 hours of cooking. Next time I'll use a different cut of beef, though, since the ribs were a bit too fatty for my taste. I used the leftover broth and vegetables to make barley soup, after discarding the solidified fat.

Rating: 3
I'm still in the process of making this recipe (it's in the oven as I write...) but wanted to weigh in early. The ratings I've provided are optimistic, as short ribs always are a great dish. I've made them with root veggies only in the past, but thought the addition of olives in this recipe might make for a great new taste. Only problem: my local market was out of short ribs and explained that short ribs had been a big seller since they appeared on the cover of Bon Appetit. I then trekked to a second store, which said short ribs have been selling out for the past couple of months (hmm. perhaps since the Jan Bon Appetit hit the newsstands?) The third time's the charm; I hit a third market on my way home and was able to secure a few pounds of succulent short ribs. I'll let you know how they turned out...

Wow! Loved it! Started this early in the day. After pan searing the meat I sliced off any extra fat on the meat. When it came out of the oven I let it cool and refrigerated it since we were going to an early movie. When I got home I skimmed off the fat and continued on! I served it over a soft polenta that I had added butter and pecorino cheese to! To die for!

After making this dish, my family specifically asked me to never make it again. So the recipe went in the trash! We found the meat hard to eat as it was so fatty. I prepared this one day in advance, giving the fat in the sauce a chance to harden, which I removed. I thought the sauce was tasty, but the having to pick through all the fat to get to the meat was a disappointment after spending so much time on the preparation.

Rating: 3
I thought this was good, but my husband (who is French) raved on and on about it. Maybe it takes him back to his caveman days? I liked that it was easy to make ahead of time. The potatoes were tasty as well. The best part is the sauce. The next day, I used some ground beef and made a "hamburger steak with gravy" from the leftover sauce. Yum

Rating: 4
Read the rave reviews, I was hooked, so went looking for short ribs at various local markets. Not always easy to find. When I did find them I gasped at the price. It kills me to think of paying approx. $4.00/lb. for mostly bone and fat. The flavor for this recipe is mainly in what has been combined with the beef, and the process for preparing and cooking it. I used chuck roast. More meat, less waste, less cost. Still fabulous.

Amazing! A wonderful meal for the season. I made this for guests over the weekend and it just blew them away. As someone suggested, I cooked the meat a day ahead and removed some of the fat.

This was a fantastic recipe, and easy to make. I tried it on 3 friends, all of whom raved...especially nice was sopping up the juices with slices of baguette!

This whole supper was a winner that I will make again.

This dish absolutely deserved to be named Bon Appetit's dish of the year. I prepared it for our Christmas Eve gathering and got rave reviews.

These added color, tasted delicious AND saved more time.

Spectacular! This recipe really brings out the deep rich flavor short ribs should have when made properly. I didn't, and wouldn't, change the recipe a bit. Just be certain the wine in the dish is good enough to drink with the meal (and while the short ribs are cooking, as well)

I had an opened bottle of red Sangiovese so I used that instead of the Zinfandel and I used canned "sundried" tomatoes in juice instead of the regular canned tomatoes. Friends(who do not normally get too excited) raved about it! I did not try the potatoes, however, as I made garlic mashed potatoes instead, which went very well.

I can't believe that this was Bon Appetit's recipe of the year as advertised on the cover. I made the entire dish, and it was very labor intensive for the mediocre results that I got. It tasted like plain old roast beef to me, nothing remarkable about it. The potatoes were dry and very stiff. No one finished those. A very disappointing adventure, luckily it was a cheap piece of meat.
