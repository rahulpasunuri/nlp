Easy and decent as is, really good with a few simple modifications: up the curry powder, add jalapeno or other heat if you like it spicy, and instead of tomatoes I like cubed sweet potato. I often add celery too. Serve over rice with cilantro, sour cream or yogurt, and a wedge of lime.

We added one small chili and added it to the onions and garlic while sauteing. Mixed my own curry made from garlic, fresh ginger, ground mustard, turmeric, cumin, coriander, chili, and a touch of cinnamon, made recipe as instructed with veg broth made from oxo cubes. At the end we added 6-7 vine (or 2-3 normal sized) tomatoes to sub for the canned, and a bunch or spinach and stired them in to the hot lentil till mixed and wilted. We served it over multigrain rice and had it on the side of curry cauliflower. Next time we will make the yogurt with greek yogurt. yumm.

This was okay: nice flavor but pretty boring. I also thought the tomatoes were far too acidic and jarring. Probably won't make this again.

Good! Made a nearly identical version of this using another cookbook. Added: garam masala (1 tsp at the beginning and a dash at the end) curry powder (ditto) cardamon powder (at the beginning) some leftover carrots and shishito (when lentils reached a simmer) spinach (at the very end), juice of 1 lemon and some lime juice (very end) served with the pita, pear-and-lightly-carmellized-onion salad with asian pear slaw dressing, and carmelized bananas as recommended. perfect.

Nice and easy weeknight meal. I use coconut oil instead of olive oil. Coconut oil is actually healthy for you (read Nina Planck's Real Food). Also use greek whole fat yogurt to make it really tasty.

A little bland. I added about half a lime, cilantro, two tablespoons of brown sugar, and 3/4 teaspoon of chili spice blend. It was AMAZING!

Very, very tasty. I increased the curry powder to 2 TB and used chicken broth instead of vegetable. It was a perfect weeknight meal.

I have made this dish many times by now, for big occasions and small occasions. Because it is quick and easy. Because it is cheap. Sometimes I use this simple recipe (but always with ghee butter... and fresh coriander before serving), sometimes I add carrots, potatoes, lamb ribs, chicken, ... There is nothing bland about this dish if you cook it right, and use a good curry and stock. I use the very thick Turkish yoghourt. I must admit with some runny yoghourt, it would not be the same.

I would make this again, but next time add some diced jalapenos at the beginning. This dish is a nice and simple homey meal, but thought it needed alittle heat.

I confess: I'm a modifier and I'm an eyeballer (which is probably why I'm not a good cook)...so I can't speak about this recipe exactly as it is written. But considering I'm no great talent in the kitchen and this still came out better-than-okay, here's what I did: Started with onions, added garlic, mild curry paste (instead of powder), and some chopped ginger. Threw in zucchini and carrots. After cooking everything with lentils and broth (added a smidge of tomato paste, too) and right before serving, I added the tomatoes along with chopped cilantro. Also added cilantro to the ginger yogurt. Not huge modifications, but it turned into a hearty bowl of flavorful soup that I wouldn't hesitate to make again. The yogurt, simple as it is, really stands out and makes the soup. Hmm... just took another bite of soup, looked at the "green lentils" I used in the recipe, and realized that I used split peas. Heck,... I think I'll even stick with split peas in the future. No wonder the color is so nice. I'm going to help myself to another bowl.

Because of some of the reviews, I was hesitant to make this, but I had most of the ingredients on hand so I decided to take the plunge. I am glad I did. This is a really refreshing dish with the sharpness and tang of the ginger yogurt mellowing the heat of the curry. As other reviewers suggested, I upped the curry to 2 Tbsp, added some ginger to the cooking lentils and used veg. oil instead of olive. Very nice dish that I will make again. My husband will hate it, I think, but I've got some pork marinading for his dinner :-)

I'm with Atlanta. We like lentils well enough, and looove curry but this somehow just didn't do much for us. We used 21/2 Tbl. curry powder (good kind from an Indian market nearby) to counteract the blandness others spoke of and this was as spicy as we'd like but not too much. The yoghurt was surprisingly nice. All in all, we have leftovers and I'm hoping my husband will eat the rest because I don't really want it again.

This is a delicious dish with one glaring exception - olive oil? Indian food uses either ghee or a vegetable/seed/coconut oil. Olive oil has the wrong taste for this cuisine.

This was very simple to make and tasty. I served it to about 10 college students, and all but one cleaned their plates. I used curry powder from the Indian grocery, not the bland stuff from the supermarket, which probably accounted for the flavor.

Very easy & tasty (& cheap! for a college kid on a budget). Used about 2 T hot curry powder and it's about as hot as anybody would want it, a nice kick but the spice doesn't overpower the flavors. Used a can (2c) of diced tomatoes and about 1 T garam masala. I also found that it cooked in about 30 minutes, but I used red lentils, so that may have made a difference. Definitely a keeper for cool winter nights.

This dish cured my lentil-phobic roommate of her fears...the earthiness of the lentils, the coolness of the yogurt, and the piquancy of the ginger all combined to make this a wonderful vegetarian meal.

I make this with Madras Curry powder (a bit more than called for in the recipe) and it gets rave reviews. A keeper.

We loved this dish. Even my Guyanese-Indian nanny thought it was great, very much like a dal she makes. We had plain Greek yogurt with it since we do not like ginger, and the cold creaminess of it was a nice contrast with the curry. It was also exceptionally easy.

I can see why some might find the recipe a bit bland. However, I make it regularly with a few moderations: I double the amount of curry powder and add a bit of tandoori spice or garam masala, depending on my mood. I also use chicken stock for additional flavour. The ginger-yogourt adds a great little kick, and this is a super dish to pack up individually to take to work / school.

I didn't care for this recipe either--there are a lot of good lentil soup recipes out there, and this is not one of them. It was bland, even with additional seasoning, and no one wanted seconds. The yogurt sauce was nice, but save it for a better soup recipe.

Maybe I did something wrong and didn't know it, but this wasn't all that great. I love lentils, but not this dish! We won't be having it again.

This was delicious, healthy and quick. I added another tablespoon of curry.

This was fabulous!!! We liked the ginger in the yogurt for a cooling yet tangy flavor addition to the spiciness of the curry.

EXCELLENT!!! I rated it four forks because it was so tasty AND was ready in about 20 - 30 minutes (I halved the recipe). I used hot curry paste instead of the powder which added more flavour, I think. I also added the ginger to the stew, rather than the yogurt and used canned crushed tomoatoes. It's great with and without the yogurt. Don't skip this one.
