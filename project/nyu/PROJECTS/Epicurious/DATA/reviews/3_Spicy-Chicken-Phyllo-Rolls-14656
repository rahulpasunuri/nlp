These were great if you serve them immediately! Do no let them sit around,they become soggy and tasteless. I added more lime juice and more jalapeno. I would make them again.

I used ground chicken this time. We'll see on the 26th if it worked the same. They were very yummy although phyllo isn't my favorite to work with.

I made these for my office holiday party. People thought they were good (some thought too spicy, but I did double the jalapeño), but I thought they were kind of bland. I liked them overall, but next time I might add some cheese, more cumin, maybe some chili powder.

Made this last night for dinner. Added cilantro and used 2 jalepinos. I made the sauce separately and poached 4 chix breasts per the recipe. I laid out the phyllo, added the breast whole, topped with sauce and wrapped. I made 4 chicken "envelopes" -- a great entree. Served with heirloom tomatoe and goat cheese salad.

wonderful dish and easy to make. i used canned chicken and it still turned out great. i also took some leftover meatballs,sauce and mozzerella and wrapped them in the phyllo. FANTASTIC. there were NO leftovers.

Left over roasted chicken will work here also. I added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for additional kick. The egg white was awkard, I switched to lightly spraying with Pam, it worked great. No leftovers! 'nuff said.

I was so busy i did'nt get to taste them! I made them ahead and froze them, my guest seemed to like them, although they didn't hold together as well as i would have liked, maybe too much filling in each roll. And I would advise using the other reviewers suggestion with an extra sheet of phyllo in the wrapping...

I forgot how much I hate to make (but love to eat) recipes with Phyllo. I used 3 sheets instead of 2, which held together a little better. The flavor was excellent. Letting the prepared mixture "rest" for a couple of hours takes the edge off the jalapenos and lets them mellow a bit. Nice appetizer or finger food.

Outstanding. I didn't have time to chill for 2-3 hours, so I chilled it in freezer for 20 minutes, and refrigerated for 10 before assembling. I also added a bit of chopped cilantro...Very tasty! Perfect for cocktail party or for watching college football with friends!

This recipe was yum-yum-yummy. It was a big hit, it just may need more jalpenos - if you like your food very spicy. Make sure you use a really good salsa and garnish with lime for a pretty presentation.

A tasty appetizer - I didn't have any real jalapenos so I used bottled which worked great! A real treat!
