I followed other suggestions and reduced the It still needed more flavor. Maybe fried pepper next time? It filled a regular muffin tray of a dozen normal size muffins.

Like other reviewers have said, this is quite bland. I used 1/2 tsp kosher salt and ended up adding more. This recipe would benefit greatly by the addition of a more pungent cheese--I'll go for goat cheese or feta next time.

Delicious! I added a slice of tomato on top and sprinkled a little parmesan on top for a great result. Hubby loved it too. I'll definitly be making this again. However I used only 6 eggs and recipie still made 9 frittatas, used less chives too and it turned out great.

AFter reading the reviews I decided to add shallots to the zuchinni as well as apple/hickory smoked bacon which i cooked separately and cut into pieces unto the egg mix. doubled up on the salt and increased cheese to 1 cup. my family and friends raved.

I made this recipe a little healthier and more favorful by using 4 whole eggs and 4 egg whites and added some roasted red peppers

I thought this was good, particularly when you have a garden full of too much zucchini, but I added the following to deal with the "bland" factor: 1t biber (Turkish red pepper flakes), heated with the oil; 6 cloves of garlic, sliced, 1/2 C sliced onion, and 1/2 C chopped prosciutto, which I sauteed with the zucchini--thanks to all who gave their recommendations before.

I took the advice of adding prosciutto, and I also added a bit of finely chopped red pepper. It's still just good, not great. A friend suggested plopping a round of buffalo mozzarella into each frittata just before cooking. I think that's what I'll try next.

Delicious but will add a little more salt next time; found it to be a little bland. Wonderful presentation and easy to make. Used a small 12-tin muffin pan instead of the 1 cup muffin-tin suggested in recipe. Served with sauted red peppers, crisp green salad and fresh bread.

I made this in the large cups and it was delicious! I would definitely make it again. I did however double the salt as it didn't seem like the recipe called for enough. I'm glad I did otherwise it would have been bland. I like the variations some of the other cooks suggested. In fact I used half eggs and half egg substitute and I didn't notice a difference.

Did this in 12-cup muffin tin. Also used baby squashes (which included zucchini) so the veggies were a bit more varied. I thought it was very easy to make and like it for that, as well as for how nicely textured the veggies were, but it was just a little... bland. I'd consider making it again and adding in some prosciutto or something. I did, however, use a grana cheese that wasn't quite as strong in flavor as pecorino romano would be, but doubt it would be good enough as a main dish even with the more strongly flavored cheese.

Great recipe, great taste, but what a mess! Used nonstick pan as advised and did everything as instructed, but was left with a serious mess afterwards.

Great recipe for a light dinner, brunch, breakfast - anytime really! All you need is a side salad and a little bread.

This may be a silly question: when you grated the zucchini (instead of chopping it) did you still saute it (lightly perhaps)? Or, was it so fine that you didn't need to cook it before adding it to the egg mixture? I'm thinking of trying this with sauted onions, garlic and mushrooms added to the Zucchini...and some tabasco...

Added cheddar cheese to give a boost to flavor and used lots of vidalia onion yet still quite plain....needs something more...maybe tomatoes?? and some fresh herbs...??

Very bland, even after adding additional onion, a clove of garlic and a touch or red pepper flakes.

What a great recipe! I made it once in the large muffin pans and am planning to make it in mini pans for an open house.

I have more zucchini in my garden that I know what to do with! This recipe, along with chocolate chip zucchine bread and Italien zucchini casserole are now my new summer staples! I served this for a brunch for 10 along with garden fresh tomatoes, grilled potatoes and peameal bacon (Canadian bacon). WOW! Easy and delicious!!

I used a mini-muffin pan to make bite-size frittatas. I shredded my zukes, and used egg-subsitute (gasp!) instead of eggs. It worked beautifully and tasted wonderful.

Very tasty. I don't understand why the make-again-% rating for this recipe is so low, since there is only one bad review so far. Don't let that scare you away. They're not bland at all if you add salt, pepper, and/or a bit of your favorite flavors. I made them in a mini muffin pan, and everyone loved them.

I made appetizers using a mini-muffin pan. It made 2 batches. Very good. Make sure you use enought salt! I used grated zucchini and added the white part of 4 scallions during saute. Then I used the green part of the scallion instead of chives. Lowered the over to 350 and cooked 10 min, then 3 min under broiler.

The idea really appealed to me, I did make some changes however, I grated onions with the zucchini and browned them together . . I also used less eggs . . . it was amazing,we were scraping the bottom of the dishes!!! Definitely a keeper!!!

SIMPLICITY AT IT'S BEST Made these frittatas in mini-muffin pans. Shredded the zucchini as opposed to slicing. Added minced onion.a little garlic and used butter in place of oil. Decreased cooking time to ten minutes for my oven. Placed on cookie sheet and then added fresh shredded parmigiano to top for more cheese flavor. They were a hit as an appetizer, being bite sized and definate finger foods.

I added aclove of garlic to the zucchini as I was cooking it. It addded a little more interest to the recipe. My guests devoured the frittatas.

Very bland, the eggs overpower the zucchini and chives. No one in the family liked them, even threw one away.
