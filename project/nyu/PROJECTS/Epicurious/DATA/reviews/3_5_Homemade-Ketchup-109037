This recipe is way off. I cut the sugar back to 1/3 cup, and it's still too sweet. A 1/4 cup is more than enough. I used 1/3 cup of vinagar, that seems to be about right. I realize that recipes are meant to be tweaked, and that people have different tastes, but this recipe would be disgusting to most people if followed to the t.

RE: canning and botulism. Tomatoes vary in acidity, and your garden produce may not be safe to can, all by itself, in a typical hot bath canner.The temperature of boiling water will NOT destroy the botulinus organism. (There was an outbreak of botulism in Russia within the last several years that was traced to home-canned tomatoes). That being said, the Ball Blue book can probably give you an idea of the ratio of vinagar to tomato necessary for producing a safe product. Offhand this recipe looks like it would easily qualify. Alternatively you can use a pressure canner, if you`ve got one.

After reading other reviews, I cut the cider vinegar down to 1/4 cup and the sugar to 1/3 a cup. I also added a tsp of minced garlic and some chipotle tobasco. It doesn't taste like Heinz if that's what you're expecting, but it is definitely delicious and I will definitely be making it often.

I too cut down on the sugar and cider vinegar to 1/3 c brown sugar, and 1/4 c cider vinegar. I also added a couple cloves of garlic and added 1/4tsp of hot spanish paprika. it tastes like, ketchup, but not. it's delicious, definitely, and reminds me of the buglarian sauce lutenitsa.

I was in a hurry so didn't read all the awful reviews. Doctored it up a fair bit - was only making it because I was out of ketchup and too lazy to run to the store. Here's how I doctored it: - 3 15 oz cans of diced tomatoes (instead of 1 28oz can whole) - balsamic vinegar instead of cider - large red onion instead of medium yellow - added 4 cloves of minced garlic - added 3 large roasted hatch chillies (skins removed) It's definitely not 'normal' ketchup, but it was easy and tasted great. I'll probably make this on a regular basis.

Yeah, I agree completely with the other reviewers who said this was awful. It was *nothing* like ketchup - no spiciness or anything - and was overly sweet. It tasted like extremely sweet and tangy tomatoes. Blech. Tossed out the entire batch. I even doctored it up per the suggestions - I added smoked paprika and some black pepper and garlic powder. It was still just horrible.

I will make this again and again. No more store bought ketchup for me! It's really easy to make and the taste is out of this world. I will say I did reduce the amount of sugar since my family doesn't like stuff too sweet. This will be a staple, believe me!

Commercial canned tomatoes and tomato paste can vary widely in sweetness and acidity. Bear in mind when making this ketchup - go easy on the sugar and vinegar. You can always add more if needed, but you can't take it out once it's mixed in!

Have made this but wanted to respond to the post below WRT botulism. C. botulinum can only grow in low acid environments. Both tomatoes and vinegar are quite acidic and this recipe is perfectly safe for home canning. Additionally, the toxin is not heat stable so if you really wanted to be insane about it you could heat up the ketchup and then refrigerated in an aerobic environment.

This was great and easy to make. I didn't change any of the ingredients, but did let it cook about 15 minutes longer that the recipe said. Everyone here likes it. Can't wait to serve french fries.

I doubled the recipe and added some garlic and other spices, and I cut down the sugar and the vinegar. I used my fresh tomatoes too. I found that if I added more salt, the sweet and vinegary taste dissappeared. I thought it was delicious and am out so am making more now. I am going to try the recipe exactly the way it is written but add enough salt to take away the sweetness and vinegary taste. I will let you know how it turned out.

I can't even give this recipe a single fork. It tasted NOTHING like ketchup!! I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be way to vinegary. I'm not even sure that was the whole problem. It just did not taste like ketchup! I would not recommend this recipe! Stick with Heinz!

I haven't tried this yet, but wanted to respond to the previous commenter. There's no indication that this recipe has been lab tested for safety. Please don't can it! Really bad things can happen (botulism!) when canning untested recipes. Use a trusted source like an up-to-date Ball Blue Book or the NCHFP website.

HI, I have a question. Someone said she canned remaining ketchup. Do mean canned like you would can peaches or other product? Thanks. MG

Who needs Heinz when I've got this?!? It's absolutely wonderful! As suggested, I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and still found it a bit sweet. However, it was perfect once I added about a teaspoon of smokey paprika. I made a double batch and canned it so that I could keep it on hand. It's definitely worth the time. I also made a chipotle version which wowed my spice fans. No more store bought ketchup for me- this is the way to go!

Made this with my own tomatoes. Just blanch and peel the skins, deseed if you need to and aim for 28oz. Then, follow the recipe to yum!

Did anyone make this with fresh tomatoes? If so, can you give specifics (e.g., need to peel the tomatoes? how many more tomatoes did you use to make up for the puree?) Did anyone try to can or freeze this recipe?

This is really yummy. I'm making an upscale American food themed party and I plan on serving this in martini glasses with french fries. As per everyone's suggestion I only used 1/2 a cup of sugar. Also, it was looking thin so I added more tomato paste. It's a pretty flexible recipe, do whatever you want with it.

I disagree on the 'you shouldn't rate if you changed the recipe' comment. I read the comments specifically to get ideas on how others changed it. The diversity of opinions is what makes epicurious better than a cookbook. Viva la internet!

This was really delish, especially when compared to bottled ketchup, but next time I'll definitely use less brown sugar. Also, is it necessary to puree whole tomatoes in puree? I don't see why you couldn't just start with... tomato puree.

I love this recipe - followed it exactly, just adjusted the sweetness to taste - wouldn't add or change anything else. Cooking time to reduce was right on as well!

Keeper - I agree with springfield on sugar. I did 1/2 c and will cut back to 1/3 next time. I also added 1 tsp of hot smoked paprika, and it gave it a great boost. yes it is ketchup, only so much better than mass made stuff. Great to get away from HFCS

i disagree with the "too much vinegar" comments. we think it is delicious as is. for those of you who modify the recipe, you should not rate it cause you didn't make it as specified. it is so annoying when some cooks do this. and it isn't fair to the recipe author either. the next time i make it, i plan to cut the sugar to 1/2 cup since i thought it was a tad sweet. this is an awesome recipe and i plan to give it as gifts with homemade mustard. it took a long time for the ketchup to reduce enough but i think the end result was worth it.

I agree with that it has too much vinegar- I tried 1/3 cup and added more salt, pepper and also added about 1/2 tsp each of allspice, garlic powder and dry mustard. My 4 year old helped me make this, and she now thinks its absolutely delicious! I tend to agree- best ketchup we've had.

I recently made this recipe. I agree, a little too much vinegar. I cut the vinegar to 1/4 cup, and used an organic, raw vinegar which has a more mellow taste. I also cook this ketcup in a slow cooker. Still a great taste, but a time and energy savings compared to stirring on the stove for a hour.

Wasn't time consuming and was absolutely delicious! A great way to avoid that pesky high fructose corn syrup!

It is to comment from the person that wrote "Is this from the too busy to cook section" No some of us just don't care to buy all these processed foods from the grocery store that are loaded with all these preservatives. We like to take the time to go the extra step. I will comment again after I am done making this recipe.

Simplified by using the cuisinart w/blade; tomato paste, stewed tomato, water, distilled vinegar, onion, garlic, paprika, cayenne powders, honey and s&p to taste, liquids to consistancy. Simmering until taste comes together. Very gourmet taste w/out the high fructose corn syrup!!

Way too much vinegar! I really liked the consistency and look of the ketchup; our family was very excited about trying the finished product. Only it tasted overwhelming of vinegar. I'll make it again, but halve the quantity of cider vinegar -- and maybe some spice as suggested at this Epicurious ketchup recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=12260 Any suggestions about the vinegar issue?
