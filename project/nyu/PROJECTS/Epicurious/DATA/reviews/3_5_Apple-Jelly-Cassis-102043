First, please notice that this is a recipe from 1962 and here we are making it in the 2000's I'm making it in 2010. My apples are truly unripe. I have two old apple trees and I have no idea what kind of apples they are. Three years ago we discovered that they make good applesauce (we moved here two years before that and I understand from the neighbors that no one had ever done anything with these apples before). Last weekend (mid August) I noticed that a branch had broken and we have a bumper crop of apples this year. Last year we didn't have a one! When the branch came down loaded with apples I looked for a recipe for unripe apples and found this one. I made a batch using only 3 cups of sugar and the best quality blackcurrant liqueur I could find rather than the cheaper cassis. The jelly is delicious! Full of flavor, neither too sweet nor tart. Six pounds of apples yielded six 8 oz jars of jelly and I've already given 3 of them away. I'm into my second batch of 6 lbs of apples for another 6 jars as I think these will make great holiday gifts.

I am torn on this, and i think it is in part due to the fact that i find most jellies too sweet, so perhaps it is not such a reflection on the recipe. I made this with 1/2 cup less sugar, used Chambord rather than Cassis. I was hoping for more flavor from my unripe Gravensteins (harvested a bit early to foil those pesky squirrels). Still tastes good, but the Chambord shines through more than the apple flavor. Maybe a bit less liquor next time.

This was very good, but I wasn't crazy about the cassis. Cassis is so syrupy. When I make this again, I will use Chambord or another liqueur that I like instead of Cassis.

This is the best jelly I have ever tasted. It has a perfect jelly consistency and is not too sweet. The Cassis adds a lot of flavor and gives it a beautiful color. It's easy to make and I will definitely make it again and again.
