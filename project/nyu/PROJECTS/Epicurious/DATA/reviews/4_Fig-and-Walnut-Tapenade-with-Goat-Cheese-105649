Based on the advice of one of my foodie obsessed friends, I made this as an appetizer for an autum-themed meal. It was simple to make and it was easy to assemble for guests, but I was disappointed, especially after reading these great reviews...I just didn't think it was that great. In theory it sounds like it should be fantastic, but I agree with another one of the reviewers that it was just sort of...blah. I do love figs and goat cheese together, but next time I would go with my old stand-by of proscuitto "horns" with goat cheese, fig jam and arugula.

I have made this every year for Thanksgiving for the past 10 years. My guests from out of town call ahead to request it and it is always the first appetizer to disappear.I make it exactly as written which is very unusual for me. Definitely get a quality goat cheese.

This recipe is just outrageously good, especially at an autumn cocktail or dinner party. The photo makes it look quite loose, which may make it hard to "scoop" onto a round along with goat cheese. I usually make this with mission figs, which I prefer, and give all ingredients except walnuts a rough puree, then add well-chopped walnuts at the end. I can't tell you how many people have asked for this recipe-- four forks!

This recipe is simply one of the best! I have had it with the capers, but often find myself leaving them out because I don't have them in the house. Doesn't seem to harm the appeal of this tasty little dish. It is always finished to the last crumb and EVERYONE wants the recipe. I typically don't slice the goat cheese. Instead I place two small logs side by side in the center of a dish and pour the tapenade over it. Garnish with walnuts and thyme and place crackers around. Use spreaders to break apart the cheese and spread on crackers. Absolutely delicious!

I served this with homemade french bread and it was delicious. My husband practically fell into the bowl of it, and then asked me to take it away before he ruined his dinner by eating the whole thing. I made it the day before and added the nuts at the last minute so they wouldn't lose their crunch. Will definitely make it again.

This is the second time I have made this recipe and I think it is wonderful. Everyone loves the unique combination of flavors. The first time I made it as written but servered it with brie, mascarpone and goat cheeses. Today I added some red wine, chopped fresh rosemary, and chopped fresh tarragon(I think the anise taste will work well and I didn't have any thyme) during the steaming process. I also added brine cured green olives along with the Kalamatas and am debating right now if I should add a chopped garlic clove.

i am a bit tapenade fan and was a bit hesitant to do a sweet version... (and tapenade with anchovy? huh?)...but judging that 10 guests finished almost all of it, i'm thinking that it was a real success. next time, i will blend the goat cheese with a tiny bit of cream to make it more spreadable. mine crumbled, but was delicious nonetheless. i also did what a prior reviewer suggested, and assembled a few crackers on the tray to indicate that the cheese and tapenade were a package deal. ;)

Relatively simple to make and full of flavor. I added a couple of tablespoons of red wine to the water while hydrating the figs. I also used pecans instead of walnuts since I had them on hand. I made individual crostini just before guests arrived as a nosh before a 5 course meal. (Valentine's Day) I served a ginger champagne cocktail with it. Guests who don't like figs liked this. Nice combination of sweet and salty.

Based on all of the glowing reviews I took a chance and made this recipe for my family Christmas get together. We loved it. I spread the goat cheese on the bottom of a small tray and then apread the tapenade on top. That way it was easy for people to tell how to eat it. I will be making this again this weekend as I have enough figs and olives in the refridgerator.

When I made this for the first time, I ran into some problems when I was trying to slice the goat cheese rounds. Since the goat cheese was falling apart and the guests were about to arrive, I combined the tapenade and the goat cheese into a cheese ball. All of my guests loved the flavors and having everything combined made it easy to spread on crackers or crostini. This dish was enjoyed by people who don't consider themselves fans of goat cheese or olives.

My search for the perfect hors' doeuvre has ended. I brought this to a gathering of my friends last night and everyone asked for the recipe. It's gorgeous, can be made ahead, and is addicting. I used a beautiful plate, placed the sliced circles of goat cheese around the perimeter, and put the tapenade in the center with some strewn sprigs of thyme. I served it with a basket of crusty bread slices. Even if you don't care for goat cheese, the tapenade is a great thing to serve with drinks while the party is getting started.

This was totally outstanding. Probably the best appetizer dish I've ever done. The combination of ingredients is stellar. I used Coach Farms goat cheese, which is the best I've ever had, so I highly recommend it. It was in a wheel so I cut the wheel in half, so it created a triangular space. Very attractive with the thyme sprigs. Will most definitely make again!

Love this recipe, it always gets great reviews. Last time I made it I used pine nuts instead of walnuts (our friend is allergic to walnuts). I also serve it with roasted garlic heads -- spread some garlic on the crostini (we use herb bread brushed with garlic olive oil and grilled), top with goat cheese and tapenade. We also present with goat cheese logs -- beautiful presentation and just delicious!!!

This was excellent, I served it at my New Year's Eve party and it was a big hit. A few alterations to the recipe: I was able to find soft dried figs at my grocery store, so I didn't have to do the process of boiling them in water, which saved time. I also skipped slicing the goat cheeese and instead served a 10 oz log of goat cheese covered in the tapenade, so that people could spread as much cheese as they wanted on the crackers. Then, on the edge of the platter, I made a few in advance so guests could see how to eat them, plus they looked pretty; so I had a few crackers smothered in cheese and topped with a tsp or so of the topping. Also, instead of adding the chopped walnuts into the mixture, I sprinkled them on top of the goat cheese log, as I didn't love the walnuts in the tapenade, I thought it was better without. Even my husband who doesn't really like olives or figs, ate a bunch of this.

I have made this over and over and over for multiple occasions. It's always a hit, even with people that don't like goat cheese. Tastes even better the next day, from the fridge. AND, it can easily be doubled and prepared together. TIP: To cut the goat cheese in nice little rounds, make sure it's cold and use waxed dental floss (NOT MINT FLAVOR). Works like a charm.

Truly delicious, gorgeous, easy, do ahead. What more can you ask for in a recipe? I used a different brand of goat cheese and had trouble cutting the log into neat slices--- didn't matter as people just scooped the soft cheese up with the tapenade. Also used the big brown dried figs (not the Calimyrna figs) and they were fine.

Thank you all for yet another way to gain 10 pounds checking a recipe for quality control. On the strength of your carrying on about this sublime tapenade, I made it yesterday for a party tomorrow. After removing a bar of gold bullion from its hiding place, I went to Whole Foods Market as suggested by a reviewer, only to find they had only Mission and Turkish figs. I bought them, but later discovered that my regular grocery store carries Sun Maid calimyrna figs cheaper. They were far more tender than the costlier figs. I doubled the recipe, but plan to add another batch. My 15 guests will be lucky to sample this stuff. I'll probably end up telling them the dog ate it, which may not have the ring of truth as I have only cats.

The given proportions allow the figs to overwhelm the olives, so I boost it to 2/3 cup olives: 1 cup figs. Also I add 1-2 cloves of minced garlic. I serve it with a warmed rustic bread and a (salty) chile/cheese crustless quiche, green salad and a sauvignon blanc.

Definitely yummy and different, but a bit too sweet for my taste. I used Chevre goat cheese, so perhaps a more heady feta would've been better for my tastebuds. If you have problems finding the Calmyrna figs, try Whole Foods, if they have one in your area. They are in the bulk food bins. I also agree with the cook who said that she doesnt cook the figs to soften them, that she likes them chewy. I proably would do half and half, cooking some and then throwing in the rest.

This has become one of my favorite hors d'ouevres. I present it on a large platter with sliced herb bread, brushed with garlic olive oil and grilled, a small dish of roasted garlic heads (4), a couple of types of goat cheese (unsliced) and the tapenade on the platter, but in a small bowl. My guests spread the garlic on the bread, then the goat cheese and top it off with the tapenade -- it's addictive!

Rating: 2
Sweet and salty are a good combo, but the figs I used must have been too sweet. Or maybe I used the wrong type of olives (I couldn't find Kalamatas.) If I made this again I'd use different olives, different figs and more balsamic. That goes to show that the quality of your ingredients is really important!

This recipe is fantastic!! The only thing that is off about this recipe is the statement that it "Serves 20"! I made this for 4 people as an appy and it was completely polished off. I recommend making it a day or two ahead to allow the flavours of the figs and olives to blend and mellow. Next time I am going to try a fig-flavoured balsamic vinegar. I followed one other reviewer's advice to slice the goat cheese using dental floss. I brought the cheese to room temp and was able to get beautiful half centimeter slices with no crumbling. Perfection! The tapenade is also delicious on crusty bread with prosciutto...mmmm...

This was a very tasty spread! The goat cheese can be left out if you're making a dairy-free meal, although I liked the flavor combination. However, others preferred the tapenade sans the cheese.

Next time I'll decrease the figs by about 1/4 and increase the olives and capers. I'd like to enhance the salty/tangy/sweet combination.

Yum!

Made this for a V-day dinner party, and my guests LOVED it! I didn't find it overly sweet at all, although I have to admit that I didn't really measure the capers and olives; I just added them until it tasted right. I gilded the lily by drizzling a teeny bit of thyme-scented honey from Greece over the top right before serving.

Figs and olives together are hard to beat! But this recipe doesn't do them justice owing to the dominance of the figs. It's VERY sweet. A bit more balance (e.g., doubling the olives) helps. Better yet, try the Jimtown Store's Fig and Olive Tapenade recipe. It's just as easy to prepare, but far more delicious!

This recipe is a REAL WINNER. I've probably made it a dozen times, and people come to my parties expecting it. I read here that some are using a food processor????

They have them in plastic tubs that are reasonable and delicious.

I've made this many times as well. It is a wow your guest kinda thing...I don't find it to be expensive, but dried figs are plentiful in the southwest. I also pre-spread the goast cheese onto toasted rounds - way less mess and chevrie is cheaper in a tub. I do all of the chopping by hand, I find the presentation to be more uniform, plus it is such a small amount that I can't see messing up a food processor for it. I wonder if you could use raisins in this? Of course, it doesn't have the ring of figs, but it might taste similar and would be cheaper...someone else try it and let me know...ok? :)

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Take SanDiego's advice and throw the olives, etc into your food processor. I used a 8oz package of SunMaid Calimyra figs; they were not in the least bit problematic when I chopped them. An 8oz package contains a few more figs than what's called for; if you're a stickler for following recipies to the last detail, just hold out two or three for munching. I reduced the capers to 2 teaspoons, because I'm not a huge fan. Also, make it the day before, the flavors do need to blend. I served this with Olive & Artichoke Tapenade and Crostini w/ Sun Dried Tomato Tapenade as a starter to a dinner party last week. Because my goat's cheese was very soft (following the advice from Gatineau, Quebec), I served it in two small bowls. People didn't seem to realize that it was to be eaten together. I'm thinking that next time, I might try to combine the tapenade and the goat's cheese. If I do and it's successful, I'll be sure to note it in reviews.

Rating: 4
Excellent and unusual-- wonderful for an elegant cocktail party. I think it's best served chilled rather than at room temperature. The hardest part is chopping the figs (they're sticky!). I would suggest buying figs that are already rather dry, since they'll be plumped up by cooking anyway. They go well with crispy, thin rice crackers, although the toppings do tumble off a bit. As suggested by previous reviewers, very soft goat cheese and slightly processed tapenade would make for easier serving. I'm making this again for another party next week.

Made this today to bring to a New Year's Eve party tonight. I've made it many times and it is always great. I wanted to share this tip: For the nicest, most manageable texture, I suggest throwing the olives, capers, and thyme into your food processor and giving it a few pulses. Then add your cooked fig and pulse a few more times. This produces a nice, spreadable consistency without losing the wonderfully rough/chewy mouth feel. On occasions when I have skipped the processing of the cooked fig, I have found the finished product to be delicious but a little hard to keep from tumbling off the cracker. Enjoy,and Happy New Year!

Even those that don't care for goat cheese loved it! The combination of ingredients was unique and oh so tasty! A definite must for any party!

Excellent, easy and unique appetizer. I made this for a dinner party this weekend and everyone loved it - even the ones that don't like goat cheese. The combination of the flavors is fabulous. Definitely a recipe to WOW your friends and relatives.

I made this for a cocktail party recently and mistakenly thought some nice guest had cleaned the serving platter - they devoured the whole thing without leaving a trace! Wonderful!

I made this for a little dinner party I threw last night and it was a huge hit! It has a wonderful and perfect combination of flavors. I omitted the capers (only because I thought I had some, but didn't) and it was still wonderful. Next time I'll have to try it with capers. It's also a perfect make ahead dish, I let mine marinate for a couple of days and I think it made a big difference. I highly reccommend this dish, I know I'll be making it again!

This is a wonderful recipe - easy to make, elegant when served and guests love it. I've probably make this 10 times in the last five months and my husband still can't get enough of it. And excellent beginning to casual or formal dinner parties.

actually -- I did not even make it, a friend brought it to a dinner party and it was consumed in SECONDS FLAT! I am just here printing the recipe for my files. I was surprised I liked it because I generally despise olives, perhaps the figs are the secret ingredient for offsetting the olives. Who knows, I just know it is one of the best appetizers I have ever tasted!

I couldn't find figs the first time I made this and used dates instead. It was good enough to make again. The second time, I found figs....it was great! Wonderful contrast of sweet and tart and its pretty in an earthy food kind of way.

Really wonderful, complex flavors and the goat cheese adds the perfect accent. Also spread cambazola cheese on toasted bread rounds, topped with the tapenade and broiled. Yum!

Made it with pine nuts instead of walnuts. It was pretty popular and there was not much left.

A friend made this for a Holiday get together recently and I was very impressed. This recipe is a perfect combination of salty and sweet, and the texture had a wonderful mouth feel being both chewy, crunchy and creamy. Anyone who makes this dish will not be disappointed.

Incredible blending of flavors. Very popular even with people we thought wouldn't like olives. I left out the capers since I'm not wild about them, so my version was probably a bit sweeter.

I served this at a dinner party and it received really good reviews. People liked the taste, and seemed to like the fact that it was a bit unusual. It's a good combination of salty and slight sweetness from the figs. The presentation is very elegant when served with goat cheese rounds and assembled as the recipe suggests. Next time I'll use toasted baguette slices instead of crackers. Something substantial is needed to hold up to the goat cheese and chunky tapenade.
