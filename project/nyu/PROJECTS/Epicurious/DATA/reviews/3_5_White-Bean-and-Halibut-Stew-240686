I made this with cod instead because it's less expensive. It was awesome! And nice and healthy-tasting.

Underwhelming. Used some of the variations suggested, pancetta instead of bacon, potatoes for 1/2 of the beans, and I added some thyme. This recipe was BLAH. Wouldn't make again. Lots of better uses for Halibut

This was just great! I used it for a soup party and it got rave reviews from my guests. I purchased saffron, but when I got home from the store, it wasn't in the bag. I substituted tumeric and paprika. I used halibut, which was wonderful, but a bit pricy. For a weeknight dinner, I'll probably subsitute something less expensive.

Didn't use clam juice, subbed cod for the halibut and added potatoes as suggested (tiny roasted fingerlings) - it was super! Perfect dish to serve for wintertime company.

My husband and I loved this recipe. Used fresh Mahi Mahi by mistake and it was delish; otherwise followed the recipe, except did not add the olive oil.

Easy, tasty, nutritious comfort food, we've made it several times. My kids even like it--sort of (-: Yields enough for leftovers.

Fantastic. I followed the suggestions of others and added a potato and only one can of beans. But, we thought that less than a pound of fish was plenty for the soup.

This is a really versatile recipe. I have made it several times, and love to vary the type of beans and fish. I love beans, so rarely used canned. I soak my favorite overnight, and then simmer for 2-3 hours before adding to this recipe. I have used cannellini and scarlet runner, and both have been excellent. It's also easy to use whatever firm white fish is fresh at the market. May favorite so far are halibut and grouper. I agree with the previous reviewers, rendering the bacon first helps with keeping it crisp. If you have pancetta, it's even better than the bacon!

This was great for a quick Sunday night dinner for my husband and I -- with great leftovers for lunch the next day. Like other reviewers, I used only one can of beans and let the bacon cook a bit before adding the shallots. Easy and delicious -- I'll definitely be making this again!

Delicious and extremely easy. I would suggest adding sage and bay leaves, though, and second the suggestion about rendering out the bacon first- it can be tricky to get the bacon crisp without overcooking the shallots otherwise. I used a frozen sole instead of a halibut (which was prohibitively expensive) and it worked well.

Super easy, super hearty and packed with some great flavor. Good staple on a rainy weeknight.

MUCH more than the sum of its parts. I only used one can of beans, and added a couple of diced potatoes instead. Really delicious.

Very enjoyable; I took other reviewer's advice and only used 1 can of beans. Used local mahi-mahi for fish and a bit of fresh thyme. Love the idea of fresh spinach or kale for next time. Served with a crusty loaf of red pepper bread and a chilled sauv blanc.

Very easy and healthy recipe. I use frozen fillets of orange roughy (or sometimes tiplapia) from costco. Not quite as good as halibut but way cheaper. One and a half can of beans would be ideal. If you can find Dinosaur Kale (aka Lacinato or Italian heirloom kale), add that to this stew.

Yum! This was really good -- and I had to make it without the saffron, with which I bet it would be even better. A sophisticated but quick weekday meal for winter. BTW, I used frozen fish fillets from Trader Joe's because I didn't want to spring for fresh, and it tasted just fine.

I used this recipe as a base, but I was missing about 1/4 of the ingredients. Even without the bacon and clam juice (really, what student has those on-hand?) it turned out amazing. I will definitely make this again, and go shopping beforehand!

This stew was excellent. I used only one can of beans and added a little bit of thyme. The halibut is spendy, but is tender and juicy in the stew. I don't know if you'd get that same result with cod.

For the short amount of time, this dish had great flavor. I added spinach(might add kale next time) for color and vegie. Kids like it, foodie snob husband like it. You can sub any firm white fish or even chicken, tofu. Really greatflavor for the first time out. Will make again.

This is soooo easy with impressive results. The fish counter had no halibut, so I used fresh cod. So fragrant and rich tasting, yet really healthy! The leftovers were good too. A little crusty bread or a side salad and it is a hearty meal.

I have other fish stews that I prefer and are much fresher tasting. Halibut (at least in California) was expensive - $28 a pound - so this was not the best preparation for expensive fish. That said, it was good, but too many beans - they overwhelmed the fish.

Great stew! Quick, easy and different. The only suggestion I have is to start cooking the bacon first to render some fat before adding the shallots (which I minced). Very tasty!
