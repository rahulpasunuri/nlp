This was great. Came together perfectly, in just a couple of minutes. Will be having it on falafel sandwiches tonight!

I'm not sure what I did wrong -- followed the instructions exactly -- but my sauce came together beautifully in a few seconds, tasted great, and then within the next couple of stirs started to break. Ended up completely broken. I'm going to try again, but it was very strange.

Excellent. Served with steamed brocolli, roasted zucchini and potatoes and chicken. The sauce worked great with everything. Would be awesome to top falafels or as a salad dressing. Will be making more often.

Fantastic! Authentic and very, very tasty. I don't understand the poor review at all--I was looking for an excellent tahini sauce recipe, and this is it. I made it exactly as written and loved it with my falafel.

This recipe is missing white vinegar. When you first take the 1/2 cup sesame paste, add at least 1/4 cup white vinegar and stir until the paste becomes more white and thinner.

Very nice flavor. I served it with falafel and pita bread, and there was almost no sauce left after lunch. Only problem: the oil tends to separate itself from the rest of ingredients, so I stirred it before each serving.

1 fork because there's no lower rating. This recipe was the worst Tahini Sauce I've ever tried. I couldn't serve this to guests so into the garbage with it. I was really disappointed.

Make sure to use freshly ground cumin if you can, and add a pinch of cayenne pepper...zingy!

I've made this three times now and it's GREAT!!! I use 1 tsp corriander instead of cilantro. I also add everything but the Tahini into the oil mixture first and let it sit for a bit. I'm taking it to a preschool pot luck dinner tonight with as a dip for my veggie platter :D
