No one liked this dish, but when we accidentally mixed it with the brown sugar-pineapple on our plates, it was much better.

I have made this several times but had to leave the peppers out because my wife does not like them. Otherwise, it goes perfectly with Thai food. I ususally serve it with thai basil chicken that I found on a Thai web site.

I don't know, perhaps I didn't prepare this correctly, but it was a sodden mass of wet tasteless whatever. I am usually quite happy with Epicurious recipes, this one was definitely not up to my expectations, but again, perhaps it was my fault.

Delicious and very easy to prepare! I added just a bit more lime juice and you can adjust the chilies to your personal taste. Great paired with grilled chicken for a light summer meal.

This is the exact recipe as another here on Epicurious called Thai Chinese-Cabbage Salad (same name except the other has a hyphen between the words Chinese and Cabbage!). Anyway, same recipe with just a little difference in the instructions. I reviewed the other recipe, so to read my review, check there! Although this was a fantastic salad, I made a couple of small changes that you might want to read.

This salad is excellent. It's simple and aside from sqeezing the cabbage after it's drained and rinsed is takes no time or effort at all. I love the Thai flavors and this salad really captures that lime/fish sauce combination excellently. A little added soy sauce might be nice too! I highly reccomend this light salad!
