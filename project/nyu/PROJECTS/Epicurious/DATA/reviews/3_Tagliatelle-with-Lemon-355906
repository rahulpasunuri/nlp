I gave this recipe three forks even though I don't think I'll make it again. It was very good but tasted more like dessert to me than dinner. I followed the proportions and directions exactly but the creme fraiche and lemon combined to taste like lemon curd. When I reheated it the next day I added in chopped parsley and some sauteed spinach and it helped cut the sweetness. Again, it was very good just not what I expected.
