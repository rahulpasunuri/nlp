These galettes are in our regular dinner rotation. They're great. I mix the dough before I go to work and leave it in the frig to firm up. We always make four galettes, which means you need more of the topping ingredients. We use three onions, three-quarter pound of asparagus, and 5-7 ounces of goat cheese (depending on the package size) to make four galettes. We don't increase the proscuitto. We also just put the topping on and bake them for about 10-15 minutes at 400 degrees. We don't do the whole refrigerate, bake the crust, put on the topping and bake again. That's way more work than is necessary. Try the recipe with these simplifications. The galettes are really tasty.

QUESTION- I feel like I am missing something. Not one to get uptight about cooking directions, but it says "4 galette rounds...makes 2 galettes." Am I spreading this on all four rounds....making 2 servings of 2 galettes each?

A lot of expensive ingriedients and over an hour of prep. time with very little pizzaz in the end product.

Had relatively low expectations starting this and was just trying to use up some ingredients, but was quite impressed with the result. Easy, absolutely delicious and the galette dough does freeze quite nicely. Outstanding.

Absolutely Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was big hit. Great party food since it can be served at room temperature. Definitely a keeper.

Wonderful. I followed Andre Soltner's procedure and used the goat cheese mixed with a little creme fraiche as a sauce base, and then topped with the asparagus, proscuitto & onions. Divine!! By the way, you can roll out the galette dough and freeze. It saves alot of time and can make this a really quick fix.

This recipe was fantastic. I used mozzarella instead of goat cheese to reduce cost. Simple to make but you must plan ahead to make the crust. Taste similar to sauceless pizza
