Very good! I made it as described, minus the saffron and with a layer of thinly sliced eggplant. I served it over couscous, wonderful!

Delicious and so easy to prepare! If you slice the lemon very thin you can eat it up with everything else. Maybe a little cumin next time.

Fabulous dish. I used half hot smokey paprika and half sweet paprika. I also used fresh green beans rather than carrots the second time. You can put anything in the dish and it will be fantastic. I served it with rustic grilled bread rubbed with fresh garlic, butter and feta cheese on top. Crazy good with this bread.

I served this at a dinner party and got raves. Used sea bass and grouper. I did make a few changes. The best was using preserved lemon as suggested by another reviewer. You can make these yourself or get them at some specialty food shops and large Whole Foods. Also I used 1 tsp. of tumeric and 1 tsp of cumin. I placed the fish on top of a layer of onion and tomato and sprinkled olives and preserved lemon over it rather than layering additional vegetables and cooked the recipe for about half the recommended time at each temperature. The marinade is suprisingly fantastic. I also mixed some of it in with some lentils we cooked and they were great!

A favorite recipe from a 1995 issue of Bon Appetit - a tour of the Mediterranean. My copy is tattered and dogeared!! I often use cod for the recipe, definitely let the fish marinate in the chermoula as the recipe suggests. As previous reviewer states, the taste of the lemon - rind and all - is important part of dish. Very thin slices are key. I always serve with plain couscous and thick slices of peasant bread.

I only did the fish in the marinade and roasted it over a vegetable Tagine from another recipe. The fish was delicious, I will use the marinade again.

I am a relatively inexperienced cook and followed the recipe closely (though I substituted Tilapia for Halibut). I made sure to slice the vegetables very thin, as recommended here and it cooked perfectly. This dish was easy, delicious, beautiful, and a real crowd pleaser - no leftovers! I will definitely make this again!

I only used the marinade portion of the recipe, and it was delish! I did add a pinch of cayenne for just a touch of heat. I used halibut cheeks, and with the leftover marinade, sautéed some shallots & button mushrooms in it, with a little bit of white wine and lemon juice to deglaze. I served the halibut topped with the mushroom mix with basmati rice and sautéed broccoli rabe.

cooked this on a stove top with a tagine, and an hour cooking is too long maybe more 45 minutes. the colors and textures are beautiful. tasty. i might consider adding cumin next time - the turmeric taste is slightly harsh.

I've been diving into African dishes ever since our return from a visit there last month. I cooked this dish with New Zealand wild orange roughy, in a traditional tagine. The only adjustment being the use of home-cured preserved lemon instead of the fresh. (A very easy process and worth the effort.) Perhaps the dish is more authentic this way. The flavors were delicious and mild. The two 8 oz. portions of fish were perfectly cooked as per the instructions. We enjoy foods with a bit of heat so I will try using hot paprika the next go around. This is a keeper because of the ease in which the recipe goes together, the health benefits of it, the unique flavors and keeping the cooking dishes down to a minimum! Certainly worthy of using for entertaining too.

After the holiday gorging this is just the recipe we were looking for, light and delicious. Since there is no acid in the marinade I let the fish sit in it all day and then it was ready to cook by the time I got home from work. I only used about half of the oil called for because I think they were a little excessive with that. It really didn't need so much. I cut all the veggies very thin including Meyer lemons. There was no bitterness from the pith at all. I agree with the previous reviewer about the spices. All my spices were very fresh so the flavor was fabulous. I also left out the salt because of the olives and then put salt on the table for anyone that wanted more but no one did. It was perfect just as it was. I served it with quinoa pilaf. Absolutely perfect.

to those who are sying it wasn't flavorful, I'd check how fresh your spices are. I made it last night with spices that I just bought back from Morocco and it was great! Also, you need to let the fish sit a bit in the spices as the recipe says. I added a bit extra on the parsley, cilantro and garlic and a bit of cumin and the juice of 1/2 lemon. I made it with 8 oz halibut filets and only cooked for the 40 minutes not the additional 25. It would have definitely been overcooked had we left it in for any longer. Cut the veggies really thinas the recipe calls for and they will be fine. I love veggies, but you probably could use a bit less. Cut the lemon paper thin also and then eat the whole thing. The taste of the rind is definitely part of moroccan cuisine and it is not over bitter if sliced thinly enough. Also, we left out the salt as the olives were really salty and that was the perfect amount for the dish. It was easy,beautiful, tasty and left me time to socialize. Served it with a cous cous made with a little vegetable broth, sultanas and sliced almonds.

This is such a tasty dish as is. Both my husband and I loved all the vegetables, and the broth that's created during baking is so flavorful. We had just plain white rice on the side, which absorbed the delicious broth and didn't compete with the wonderful complexity of the dish. There was a bitter aftertaste, which I'm guessing was the lemon rind; so next time I'm going to peel the lemon first and see if that eliminates the bitterness. I used a mandolin to slice the carrots very thin, and I baked it for the full time suggested. The fish was overdone, so I'll try less baking time, as many reviewers seem to have advised. My husband, who is Columbian, says there is a similar dish there that has potatoes, as well as many of the vegetables in this recipe. I might try adding a layer of sliced potatoes at the bottom of the dish next time to see what that adds in texture and flavor.

Nice, but we felt the flavor was a little too subtle. I'm glad I added crushed red pepper & cumin which gave it a nice touch. I also think that zesting & juicing the lemon and adding that to the mix as opposed to adding lemon slices gives more flavor (although I would still leave the ones on top for presentation). I cooked the dish for a total of 45-50 min. and the veggies were cooked but still had a little bite to them which I liked. Served orzo seasoned with lemon & parsley on the side.

I've made this dish many times to rave reviews and in my experience it calls for too many vegetables, which may explain some people's feeling that the veggies get undercooked. You could reduce the amount of carrots, tomatoes and onions by about 1/3. Halibut works well, as does orange roughy. It's a delicious dish, though -- I make a "moroccan rice pilaf" with it (currants, almonds, carrots, almonds, cinnamon, cayenne) that is a nice counterpoint to the fish.

The only thing good about this recipe was the way it looked -- I followed the recipe since it was a first time for me, and it was inedibly bitter from the lemons. And the vegetables were still raw after 40 minutes in the oven; at about an hour the carrots were slightly crunchy but okay. I can't believe all the good reviews; maybe others just used lemon joice? I don't even think the recipe is worth tinkering with to improve; I'll look for a similar recipe elsewhere!

We really loved this recipe but would make one addition: saute the onions in some olive oil before composing the tagine. The onion flavor was too strong and not at all reminiscent of the flavors I remember from being in Morocco. Otherwise it was easy and flavorful.

Rating: 3
Very easy - but beware the sauce stains b/c of the spices. One note - my diners would have preferred if the fish was skinless - otherwise, rave reviews and a beautiful presentation. Used halibut - but otherwise exactly as presented. Not sure if we were supposed to eat the lemons...

Very tasty...would make this again. But next time I would use less salt. Was way too salty following the directions.

My girlfriend and I were surprised about the long cooking time, but the fish came out very juicy and tender. I think the marinade in olive oil, plus the moisture from the tomatoes, keeps it juicy. We made the dish exactly as specified (minus the saffton, which we could not find) using orange roughy. We also prepared couscous, which is of course the perfect accompaniment. Contrary to the experience of several reviewers here, the fish was very flavorful and delicious. Easy to make - will do it again.

Excellent dish but I modified it with the following. I used tuna steaks instead because they keep their firmness more. I omitted the olives so they did not overpower the tuna To make the liquor richer and sweeter I used cherry tomatoes but one could equally use sun-dried or sun blush tomatoes. I used a lemon and a lime to give a stronger mediterranean flavour and also added a large glass of white wine and red chillies to give bite. I kept the temperature at the initial setting and cooked for longer (1+3/4 hours) to mirror the original 'slow casserole' style. Overall result - brilliant !!!

The cooking time for the fish is way too long. It came out dry and almost tasteless. The dish itself is not nearly spicy enough. I was planning to make it for 10 people, and experimented first, and I'm glad I did. Can't recommend it.

This was so easy, incredibly tasty and incredibly healthy too! Try it. You won't be disappointed. I'll keep this one on hand for guests...

HELP! This sounds so good, but am I reading it correctly, that you bake the fish for a total of 65 minutes??? Sounds like a lot for the small 6 oz fillets. Any help? Thank you!

I found this recipe to be very adaptable to various kinds of fish and very attractive, as well. I have made it several times and always been pleased.

We thought this was a great weeknight dinner, even w/o the saffron. I didn't have any on hand and was unable to get to the store before dinner. We served it w/ couscous, sprinkled some parmesan over the fish, and yum!

This dish is delicious and because it's baked, leaves you free to entertain your guests. It is surprisingly moist and very colorful. My in-laws and husband loved it. I did add twice the amount of parsley, but then again, I can never have enough herbs and spices. Fantastic.

Fantastic recipe, and extremely easy to make. I used sole instead of halibut or roughy and it worked beautifully. Instead of using olives and capers in the actual dish, I put them in the cous-cous. Do not pay attention to the person who called this dish bland.

I served this on Easter using sea bass. It got rave reviews. I made some changes though. I decided to put the olives into the couscous that I served with it and I wanted to serve a carrot salad, so used celery root in the recipe instead of carrot. One of it's biggest selling points for me is that it can be put together an hour or so before serving, since it has a ~45 minute cooking time, so that I was free to spend that hour with my guests before dinner.

The dish looks spectacular, is healthy, and was fairly easy to prepare. Unfortunately, the flavors lacked pizzaz. Other recipes I've gotten from Epicurious are significantly better. Sorry.

My girlfriend did this with Chilean sea bass and added prunes, and had both the prunes and the olives as part of the marinade. It worked very well. My mother & best friend both requested the recipe. This is a wonderful (& beautiful) party dish, even a cooking impaired girl like me can do it (it's not very hard).
