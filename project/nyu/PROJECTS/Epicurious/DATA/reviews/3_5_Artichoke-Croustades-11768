I've made this twice already and received rave reviews each time! I followed the advice to add dijon mustard to the recipe which I think helped to jazz it up. This is super easy and tasty!

With a few modifications, I thought this was a great appetizer. I used phyllo shells instead of the bread, and it worked great. I reduced the amount of mayo,and also used marinated artichoke hearts with sweet red pepper bits (that's what was at the store). They turned out beautifully and garnered raves from my guests.

This recipe needed a little flovor but I didn't want to drown the artichoke out. I substituted one tablespoon of dijon mustard for one of the tablespoons of mayo. Because I had a time constraint, I used phillo dough shells instead of the croustades. Everyone loved them.

This recipe was rather boring and needed "jazzing" up a little. I added dijon, lemon juice, shredded cheddar cheese, parsley and sprinkled with paprika. I eliminated the mayo and made a roux with butter and flour instead. I also froze them and then cooked right out of the freezer at 400* for 15 to 20 mins. Now they're delicious!

I made this recipe for guests who love to cook, and I received raving reviews. This recipe is simple to make and is delicious. I made the filling the day before as well as the croustades and just assembled and baked prior to my guests arrival. A wonderful finger food before dinner. I will definately make again.
