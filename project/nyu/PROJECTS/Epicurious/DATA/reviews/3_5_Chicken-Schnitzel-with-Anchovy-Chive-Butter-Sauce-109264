I probably have no business rating this recipe, because I did make changes, but this one is a real keeper, if only as the backbone to a variety of different meals. I used pork tenderloin, pounded thin, and dusted it with seasoned flour before the egg and panko. I went a bit crazy with the paprika, and added some thyme. I also subbed half the butter for canola oil for frying. I also had to go with flat anchovies and jarred capers, so I didn't add any salt to anything. Lot's of fresh-ground pepper, though. The only complaint I had was my fault: the wine I had on hand was way too mild for the sauce (Pinot Grigio), so it lacked any body. Next time I'll go with something heavier and sweeter, maybe an Alsatian variety, like a Reisling. As is, this is fantastic on a crusty bun as a sandwich, or with a warm potato salad. If you're serving it over noodles or spaetzel, though, you should probably make plenty of extra butter sauce. My next project is to try this recipe with lamb loin. (Anchovies and lamb go wonderfully together) When I get around to that, I'll let you guys know how it all worked out.

I thought this was a good and flavorful but not delicious chicken dish. If possible, I would actually rate it 2 1/2 forks. Great for a weekday dinner.

This was great! So easy - my German husband loved it!

Great dish! I've made it twice now for friends and family and everyone loves it. Served this up with crisp latkes and homemade applesauce. Make sure you garnish with green, since it is a 'brown dish'. What it lacks in beauty, it makes up for in taste.

Okay - here's the deal. The sauce is definitely the star. If 'ya don't like anchovies, skip this recipe. You can make the sauce more intense with more anchovies, and vice-versa. The chicken doesn't end up like crispy McNuggets if that's what you're looking for. The chicken is moist and tender, the sauce subtle. Looking for more than that? This 'aint the recipe for you.

This is just breaded chicken, nothing more. Much better recipes with more flavor than this.

I chose this recipe for its simplicity, but found it to be one of the best ways to prepare skinless, boneless chicken breasts. They were tender, flavorful, and juicy. Be sure to have bread, potatoes, rice, or noodles to soak up all that sauce.

Made exactly as listed in recipe. It was FANTASTIC. Made the pancakes, applesauce, and coleslaw, which were all great suggestions.

Nice. Different. The sauce was subtle - I doubled it to have additional for the noodles and carrots I served with the schnitzel (easier than recommended pot pancakes and slaw). I used pork rather than chicken as another reviewer did and my guests were pleased. PS Could use local (German) bread crumbs as they are actually more "authentic" than Japanese.

I used anchovy paste instead of canned anchovies, and it worked very well. We love the combination of flavors. Will definitely make this again.

This was an easy recipe with a lot of flavor. I did substitute pork for the chicken. Made more sense to me. I couldn't find anchovies rolled around capers so substituted a can of flat anchovies and added caper paste and adjusted to taste. Delicious.

To Washington: Congratulations - you made chicken cutlets . . . not this recipe.

If you want a good recipe for schnitzel, try the pork medallions with mustard cream sauce on this site substituting chicken. The flavors come together much better than this one....

These flavors just didn't seem to go together to me.

I'm a college student, and I love things that are simple to make. I make the chicken but didn't bother with the sauce and just served it with lemon wedges-- not too exciting, but it had a great flavor and was very easy to make!

I guess I forgot to rate this recipe also. We liked it a lot. Easy to make and I always have the ungredients on hand. The pork substitution makes a lot of sense as the recipe is essentially a variation on Schnitzel a la' Holstein. (at least I think that is the one with the anchovy and not the egg.)

The rolled anchovies with capers are a "unit". Mash away.

Rating: 0
Are you supposed to smash the capers too or just the anchovies?

My husband liked this better than I did. Was easy to prepare and had nice flavor. I suppose I will try it again.

I made this dish as a quick meal because I've fallen in love with Panko and have been using every recipe with them I can find. I used a can of anchovies and bottled capers and I didn't have fresh chives so I reconsituted some freeze dried ones. The sauce doesn't "reduce" as much as you'd expect, but making sure the anchovies and capers are cooked through seems to be enough. It came out very, very well. Raves from everyone who tasted it and I've made it at least 3 times in the past month.
