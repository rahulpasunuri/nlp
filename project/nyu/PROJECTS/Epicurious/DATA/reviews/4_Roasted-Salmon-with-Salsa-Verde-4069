I just found this recipe again after losing it years ago. It was always my "go to" recipe for a large dinner party in the spring or summer, and everyone always loved it. I'll try it hot for the next winter party.

Fresh corn tortillas also good with this if served hot. Wish the recipe would have directed what to do with the reduced salmon juice.

Thin Slices of small lemons and english cucumber made pretty little scales. I wasn't sure what to do with the herbs and lemon slices in the cavity after roasting. They turned limp and gloppy so I carefully removed them then inserted fresh lemon slices before serving. The fish dude removed the spine but there were a some bones I couldn't remove with pliers before cooking, (tore the meat) then couldn't get to them after cooking. I'll figure it out next time.

Really really good. We serve it hot, though. I've oven roasted the fish and grilled it - great both ways. The salsa is also great - better than I expected.

I prepared a 7# Norwegian salmon using the techniques explained in this recipe. It was easy and fullproof (using an oven thermometer) and made a spectacular presentation. I made a simple mayo/lemon juice sauce rather than the suggested salsa verde and it was fine; in fact, most people ate the salmon plain -it was that good. It was served on a huge platter and garnished with lots of parsley with lemon wedges tucked among the parsley. It was decorated with the traditional cucumber slices, small in diameter, overlapping. Since this fish was headless and tail-less, I fashioned a head and tail out of large foam "paper" plates and gave the salmon a gentle smile. I really had fun with this. By the way, I didn't know the fish monger was able to remove the bones and keep the fish intact, but he did, and I think this made diving into the fish a little easier.

I have been making this since 1997 and it is wonderful every time, I also make it with smaller fillets even without the skin it works well, I have tried different combinations of herbs and all have been good.

This recipe is a real winner for large parties. We had a family reunion dinner the other night, and I made this the day before. When I flipped it over and cleaned it off, I laid the lemon slices all over the top. Everyone was wowed by the presentation. This was surpassed by the compliments I received when people ate it! So moist and delicious. Absolutely perfect.

This is a great recipe for a party. It tasted great, and using tsatziki was a great idea. Yum!

Talk about an impressive presentation!!! People will think you slaved for days -- when really, the prep time is almost non-existent. I forego the Salsa Verde and buy Tzatsiki. Decorate the fish with thin slices of cucumber and lemon "scales."
