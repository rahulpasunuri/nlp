This is a favorite in our house. We have been making this soup for a couple years now and definitely recommend doubling the quantity of the spices.

I made this last night for dinner and it was fantastic. I made a couple small changes, but otherwise cooked as directed. I used 1 cup of peas and didn't pre-soak them. I added 2 additional cups of water and about 2/3 cup of chopped carrots. I simmered it a little longer than called for. It was delicious! Very spicy and filling.

My husband and I enjoyed this a lot. I used 2 cans of black-eyed peas, added some sliced carrots, used one carton (4+ cups) of chicken stock, and a little extra of the spices, as suggested by other reviewers. The result was excellent! It was quite spicy, and so our 2-year-old wouldn't eat it, but we enjoyed the heat. A really tasty but easy recipe that would be great after a day out in the cold!

I also modified a little bit. I incorporated recommendations of earlier reviewers and added 3 carrots and a cup of cooked squash to the recipe. I had doubled the black-eyed peas and used 10 cups of chicken and pork broth. Added 3 cloves garlic and didn't pre-soak beans (you don't really need to do this for soups, but may need to add liquid as soup cooks). Added 2 tbsp. red wine vinegar to the soup after pureeing the entire batch. I really liked the flavors; always looking for a good legume-based soup.

I doubled recipe, as there are 2 1/2 cups of dried peas in a pound, and I like to have leftovers. Did not double bacon-quadrupled spices, except for cayenne and red pepper. Added carrots. This was very good and easy, and relatively healthy. The flavor is rich and deep, and the curry is a nice, unusual combination with black-eyed peas. Initially, I pureed half, but today I pureed most of the rest and I like it better that way-it's thicker and seems more substantial. I would be interested in trying the previous reviewer's suggestion of coconut milk.

This was fantastic! I added garlic as the other ingredients seemed to cry out for it. Also, I added a carrot and more spices as other cooks suggested. The other thing I did was fish out the bacon before puree-ing the 2 coups of soup, so it wouldn't affect the texture and I would have more bacon bits in the soup.

As a Southerner transplanted to the west coast, I'm obliged to eat black-eyed peas on New Year's Day. This dish has been my tried and true stand by for the past 4 years. It's easy, make ahead, and always garners rave reviews. I don't eat bacon, so I saute the onions and celery in olive oil, and I always add a touch more of all the spices than is called for. I also put Frank's Red Hot Sauce on the table, and serve cornbread and turnip greens on the side. I've tried it without pureeing a portion, and it's tasty that way, too. Delish!

The flavor was wonderful, the texture not so much. Used more spice, as was suggested & a pinch of garam masala. I will try again, maybe adding more peas, shredded carrots. Could also add some spinach. I think some heavy cream or coconut milk would be nice too.

Fantastic. I don't eat bacon so I sauteed the onions in leftover fat/oil skimmed off of a chicken tagine dish from the night before. The Moroccan seasoning in the fat gave the soup a deep, smokey flavor which complimented the curry. I also added yogurt and chopped fresh cilantro at the end, which was tangy and refreshing.

Good dish, but I did think it needed more spice. Wound up using about twice as much curry powder (madras) and cayenne; also added a touch of cinnamon and cumin. Served the cilantro in a dish so people could add as much or little as they wanted, and also provided some yogurt to cool the heat for the timid.

Holy Moley! Easy and delicious. I'll definitely add this to my repertoire. Filling, hearty, but also healthy.

I left out the bacon and cooked the onions and whatnot in some olive oil, as my fiancée is a vegetarian. I also used only 4 cups of vegetable broth, as previous reviewers recommended. We both thoroughly enjoyed the soup, and had it again the next day for lunch (there wasn't quite enough for four servings with the amount of broth I used). I added the cilantro only to the soup we were eating immediately, and chopped fresh cilantro when I reheated it.

This soup was delicious. I did make a few modifications to the recipe. I couldn't find dried peas at my grocery store so I used a 540 mL can instead, I didn't drain them before I added them. I adjusted the amount of chicken stock to compensate for the extra liquid and only added about 5-6 cups. I like spicy food so I really increased the amount of cayenne, cumin and curry. I don't love cilantro so I only used about a tablespoon and I threw in a few finely sliced leeks near the end for colour.

I made a few changes to this recipe based on my cooking habits and my family's taste: I pre-soaked the beans all night; I skipped the bacon altogether (we are vegetarians); I used only 3 cups of vegetable broth; I skipped the red pepper flakes; finally, I puréed the soup in a blender. The result was smooth and very flavorful, delicious with cheesy croutons.

I loved this recipe. Based on the previous reviews, I increased the spices and added a carrot. I also used very good quality smoked bacon and a splash of red wine at the end, which I think made it richer. I also only pureed 1/2 of the soup leaving some of the peas whole and giving the soup more texture.

Up the ante and put in more cumin, cayenne, and/or curry. This dish has a lot of zing and personality. Everyone want to have it on New Year's as an alternative to Hoppin' John.

What a great recipe! My husband and I love curry, and I wanted to try black eyed peas since I had never cooked them before. I didn't have the pepper flakes so I used some japenese 5 pepper blend. I also added some carrots and extra curry powder. Yummmy!!!

Wow, this was good. I only had 5 cups of broth, and I added in a chopped carrot. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. It was delicious. The only problem is that it didn't make enough leftovers! I'm planning to double the recipe next time. Not sure how well the soup will freeze, I'll try it out.

This soup had an ideal balance of flavors and heat. To save time, I used 4 cans of black eyed peas, drained and rinsed. I suspect this change was responsible for the fact that my resulting soup was -- well -- a little soupier than I would have liked. Next time I plan to use only 3 to 4 cups of chicken broth. Despite the high liquid content, this recipe was a great hit, and worked well for New Year's Day.

This dish was very good and flavorful and warming. I rounded all my measurements, and even added a little chipotle tabasco when salting near the end and still had no problem. (But then again, it was pretty chilly outside today!) Also added some mushroom base and carrots, just because I needed to use them up, and won't hesitate to do it all again.(And so enexpensive!)

Yummm...A great tasting soup to add to my "favorites". I think if I have any of the "Jalapeno Black-Eyed Peas" (recipe from this site)leftover next NEW YEAR's I will use them to make this soup! Definitely a keeper....

Excellent recipe. We used Morningstar Farms "fake bacon" which was just fine. Very easy and interesting recipe.

Great!! I will use this every New Year's Day. Try even if you don't like curry. It doesn't overwhelm the taste. The nice mix of spices gives this soup a wonderful flavor.

Great winter soup. We really like this recipe, although it did come out spicy, even for a spice loving family (my cayenne pepper is from an indian spice market and may be particularly hot.) I might put in a little less pepper next time, and a little more curry. I also poured out a some of the bacon fat after frying. Real easy and really delicious.

I'm from Texas, so I know black-eyed peas. I've made this several times and always to rave reviews. The curry flavor gives the generally bland black-eyed peas great flavor. I recommend this as a New Year's Day tradition.

Good. Basic meal in one.
