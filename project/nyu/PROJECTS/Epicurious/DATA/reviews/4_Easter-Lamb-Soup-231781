I have done it to my family and our parents and they were all very satisfied. My parents were proud of me and my parents in law could not believe it!

I grew up eating this soup, but my mother's version has all the flavor, but none of the innards!! She only uses lamb meat, which she boils until very tender, shreds it into the soup along with the traditional flavorings, like dill, scallions and rice. the result is a delicious egg-lemon lamb soup with NO innards!! It's the only way my family will eat mageiritsa.

I've eaten it but would never try to make it. Its delicious if you eat it with your eyes closed. One year my aunt bought a lamb head to make the soup -- my brother who was 12 at the time had too much fun with it. The memory is enough to keep me from making it.

I haven't made this recipe either, but I had the great good fortune to eat mageritsa made by my mother-in-law several years ago when we visited Greece for Easter. In spite of sounding unappetizing to a gal who didn't grow up eating innards, the soup was delicious. I may never make it myself, but I would gladly eat it again.
