I made my own rendition of the "Cannelini Beans with Garlic and Sage" and I added rosemary and a bay leaf as well as a cup of white wine to the mixture. Instead of only keeping *some* of the cooking water, I saved all of it and used that in place of the plain water called for in this recipe. My husband likes things nice and salty so he definitely wanted more salt, but I thought it was homey and yummy just like this.

This is not very complex. I added many spices (dried thyme, oregano, bay leaf) and more tomatoes and used veggie broth/chicken broth. I would even recommend adding ham or sausage. Just not very flavorful, otherwise. But if you add these flavors you will enjoy it.

it wasn't too good when I made it but I think that's because we did too big & too much noodles

I made this recipe and found that it lacked a little depth of flavor. So, I made a second pot and used chicken broth in place of the water. My family loved it.I will make this again, even though we have to drive to New Orleans to buy the dried cannellini beans at Whole Foods.

Great recipe! Agreed that it can use more salt, but otherwise a hearty soup.

Very good recipe. You may need to add more salt to finish.

I just made a bag full of white beans, and this looks like the perfect soup to use them, easy and heathful. The only thing I will change is use chicken broth instead of the water, and maybe a bay leaf.
