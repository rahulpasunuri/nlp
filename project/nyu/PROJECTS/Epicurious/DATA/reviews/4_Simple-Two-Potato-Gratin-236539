Made this for Christmas dinner as a side for beef wellington and this stole the show. I made it with 1 cup cream and 1 cup chicken stock and it was perfect. This goes on my permanent rotation!

Love this recipe. It is my go-to make ahead potato recipe for a crowd. I increase the garlic. The garelic sage combo is delish!

Absolutely delicious, and quite easy to make. However, this recipe is missing one key direction, which existed in the magazine version of Bon Appetit: You need to thinly slice the russet and sweet potatoes before they are spread in the baking dish! I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mand Higgins.

This was so yummy. My boyfriend who claims that he doesn't like sweet potatoes devoured it. I did make a few changes/addtions. I used all sweet potatoes. I simmered the cream and sage mixture to infuse the cream and shorten the cooking time a bit. I caramelized some onions and layered them and some pecorino cheese with the sweet potato. Then topped the whole thing off with fresh bread crumbs more pecorino and these delicious fried shallots that we get from the asian market. I'm sure this recipe is awesome as written but I couldn't resist guilding the lily a bit. ;-)

I love this recipe. I prefer a slightly lighter version so, like others, I usually cut the cream to 3/4 cup and increase the chicken stock to 3/4 cup. I also like to add some minced, sauteed onions to the recipe for a little additional flavor.

I liked it and so did many others who tried it with me at dinner. They're not too goopy nor cheesy, which I love. I had never made potatoes gratin before and because there were no instructions on how to prepare the potatoes I went to another potato gratin recipe on epicurious and followed those instructions (peeled and sliced 1/8").

Super yummy! I added pads of butter on top to make it extra creamy. This was super easy to make and was a great addition to Christmas dinner.

This was "heavier" than I remembered from the last time I made it. Wish I would have done as other reviewers suggested and cut down on the cream. Guests politely took some... but I'll not mess with tradition and in future make sure to feature "real" mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving meal.

I made this as a side for Thanksgiving dinner and the flavors went perfectly with the dressing and turkey. Based on the suggestions from the other reviewers, I cut the cream to 3/4 cup and substituted milk for the other 3/4 cup. This made it a bit runny, but we didn't have the heaviness/greasiness that others complained about. I supplemented the gruyere with some parmesan as well. Will make again!

My roommate and I used to make this delicious potato recipe for our friends in college. It was extremely well-received. We made it for every dinner party we attended and always got requests for the recipe. So yummy and not difficult to make. We never used two kinds of potatoes - just yukon golds. Also made a great brunch dish.

The first time I made this recipe I didn't have any cream, so instead of 1 1/2 cup cream, I used 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup of milk. I got wonderful comments on it, and have made it that way many times since. It is a big hit at my house.

The flavor was really good. The problem I found was the amount of cream--it ended up to liquidy. I would ease up on the amount of cream and stock and add some of the cheese into that mixture to thicken it up a bit. I would also put half the potatoes in the pan, pour some of the mixture on top to coat it, then put the rest of the potatoes down adding the rest of the mixture on top.

I thought these potatoes were good. However, the amount of cream makes them a little greasy. I am wondering if blending the cheese more or adding flour to thicken would help? They were yummy, but didn't look very appetizing with the greasy liquid on top.

I followed the recipe to the letter and was very disappointed. I love all types of potatoes and cheeses and thought this dish would be a knock-out. The combination of sweet & regular potatoes with the rich sauce and cheese was bland and boring. Waste of good cheese.

Made this for a holiday dinner party and everyone went back for seconds. Cut back on the cream and increased the chicken broth; also used Asigo cheese, as that's what I had on hand.

The first time I made it was for Christmas and got overwhelming raves. The second time, I just threw it together for a weeknight dinner. Seriously. It's that easy and that worth it. In making it twice, I've done it two different ways just to kind of experiment (somewhat out of necessity). Once using yukon gold and two different kinds of sweet potatoes, following the rest of the recipe. And now a second time using only yukon golds and dried sage (ran out of fresh). I think I overdid it with the dried sage (I was in a hurry and didn't calculate properly the difference between dried v. fresh), but I really preferred the straight yukon gold dish. I liked not having to bother peeling all those potatoes. :) I have a mandoline, but have no clue where it is. I just put everything through my food processor and it was fine. This is definitely now on my list of go to recipes. I look forward to trying different cheeses and potatoes. I think it might also be good with an onion and/or Granny Smith apple thrown in for interest.

Some of the best potatoes that I have ever made! Made them for Christmas dinner and they were a hit. My picky husband told me later that he LOVED them and couldn't wait until I made more. The blend of the flavors went very well together, especially the sage and Gruyere cheese. I put 3 pounds of three different potatoes (russets, sweet potatoes and yams) and layered them. A new staple for the holidays (and any other time!)

BORING!!! Thought it had no flavor except for garlic. Couldn't even taste the sage. Needed something...maybe much more cheese. Better recipes out there!

Everyone loved this and it was very easy to make. I used 2 - 3 T of sage, I'll use more next time. I'll also add some onions.

Excellent recipe! So easy and so good. Used Yukon gold potatoes and Russet potatoes. Will definitely make again.

This looks great. Has anyone tried lightening it up a bit, by substituting something else for the the cream?

Very good, used yellow sweet potatoes and russet and thought it was a great combo. Also, very simple.

Had this with ham for Thanksgiving. Perfect. I have never had so many requests for a recipe before. Used double the amount of sage and garlic called for in the recipe.

This was AMAZING. I made it for dinner for some friends last night--it was a good thing I saved it for a group, because it made a HUGE pan of potatoes! I used a food processor for the slicing, which made the prep rather quick and easy. Tasted delicious!

Rating: 2
Tasted good but too rich for my liking... felt a bit like having been kicked in the gut afterward. May try again substituting half and half or making a roux based cream sauce. The concept of a gratin with mixed potatoes and sage is a good one.

Loved the recipe. I used 3:1 ratio of russet to sweet potatoes and there was just enough sweet, nutty flavor. Fresh sage is a must and makes a world of difference in the flavor. A bit rich for a staple but it left me longing to make it again.

This was utterly delicious! I brought it to a family Easter brunch and received scores of compliments. There's really nothing like Gruyere; it made the cheese flavor perfect, nutty, subtle. I used a Cuisinart to simplify the potato slicing. I truly can't wait to make this sumptuous dish again.

I absolutely loved this recipe, as did my company. I used 3 sweet potatoes, 2 russet potatoes, and 1 yam (color was gorgeous!). I didn't make any other changes. Perfect recipe.

This dish is beyond compare, this is only the second time I've given a 4 fork. The sweet potato makes it. The best part is it's simplicity. I received a mandoline for Christmas and it made our (daughter too) lives so much easier. If you don't have one I recommend buying one. Make it as written. Just make it!

Absolutely wonderful.

This recipe couldn't be easier or more delicious. The cusinart made simple work of slicing the potatoes and grating the cheese. Even my mom who can't stand sweet potatoes loved this dish! The sweet potatoes (I used white sweet potatoes) give the dish just a hint of nice sweetness. There are too many calories to make this every day but it's a great special occasion dish.

I made this for Christmas and it turned out wonderful. I only used russet potatoes because I made it last minute and couldn't make it to the store again. With just the russets, it was a nice basic gratin with great flavor.

This dish was an instant hit even among people who confess to not really liking sweet potatoes. I made it as-is (I used vegetable broth instead) and it was beautiful, fragrant, and a great accompaniment to our christmas ham & fish. Several people asked for the recipe.

Wonderful!!!! A V-slicer would have been nice but it was well worth the slicing. I made this for X-mas dinner and it was a perfect compliment to the ham. The sweet potatoes give it a very nice flavor. I didn't use fresh sage but I'm sure that it would only improve on the dish. Really wonderful.

Made this for a large dinner party. If you double the recipe, you may need to bake longer in a larger dish. Or just use two 11x7 dishes....that would work too. Everybody loved it and several people asked for the recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was an excellent side dish. I halved the recipe and left out the chicken broth, but it was still very tasty and a great accompaniment to turkey.
