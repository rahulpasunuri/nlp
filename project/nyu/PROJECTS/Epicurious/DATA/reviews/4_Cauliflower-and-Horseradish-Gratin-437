Well, I've made this a number of times, and it is simply great. I like to use golden cauliflower for a nicer presentation and more color on the plate. I have had many requests for the recipe. Don't be afraid of the horseradish.

Excellent!!! I too used only 5 tblsp of horseradish because what I had on hand was "extra hot". I was worried that it might be overwhelming, but it wasn't. If I had regular or mild I would use the full amount called for next time. A fabulous dish for a special occasion and a bonus that it can be made ahead.

I also used less horseradish but wished I had tried the amount suggested. Used Panko crumbs and regular milk as well. Otherwise I followed the recipe. This was really great. For folks who like cauliflower this is a hit. I thought it was better the second day, reheated in the oven. The cauliflower was still crisp but it seemed that the flavors had had more time to develop and mellow.

We really enjoyed this. I used one head and just 3/4 of everything else. I also lightened the sauce some, with 1/3 milk. I used whole wheat crumbs from some leftover bread. This is one of the better gratins that I have tried. I may try to lighten it further.

I substituted 1/2 of the cheese with medium sharp cheddar cheese (Tillamook), and used Panko bread crumbs. Delicious side dish for roast chicken.

I've previously reviewed this recipe with rave reviews and I stand by that review (note: I used slightly less horseradish, 5.5T, and subbed Comte cheese instead of fontina). I'm only re-reviewing to tell everyone that I tried to cut a corner and substitute store-bought Italian seasoned breadcrumbs for the fresh French breadcrumbs and it turned out LOUSY! DO NOT DO THIS, you will have a soggy unappealing dish.

I just made this recipe for a second time for Easter. I tweaked it as follows: used slightly less horseradish (5.5T), used 1 1/4 cup of Gruyere cheese instead of 1 c Fontina. This time it was absolutely DIVINE! Got rave reviews from everyone at the table!

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe but my boyfriend had a couple of suggestions for next time: (1) slightly less horseradish (maybe 5.5T) b/c the horseradish slightly overpowered the flavor of the cauliflower; (2) slightly more cheese (1 1/4 Cup). We will definitely make this again with these slight adjustments.

This is a yummy dish. I used super hot horseradish and loved the results. My bechamel was a little too thick. Next time I won't cook it so long.

This was delicious. The horseradish was surprisingly subtle given the quantity used. Probably the best cauliflower dish I've ever had. The only changes I made were to add an additional 4oz of Fontina to the sauce and I substituted Panko breadcrumbs for the fresh French breadcrumbs.

Quite possibly one of the best cauliflower dishes I've ever had. The horseradish is present, but it still lets the true flavor of the cauliflower come through. I will continue to make this dish again and again...

Great side dish for adult guests. Kids did not even try it. However this is a sophisticated accompaniment to steak, bistro type fare. Will make forever!

This was great. I served it with beef tenderloin at a dinner for friends and it was a hit. I was looking for color, so I used a mix of white and golden cauliflower and some broccoli. I also went for Gruyere cheese and added about a half cup to the sauce, as others have suggested. The only negative: I found that it did not taste so good as a leftover. However, it is fabulous out of the oven, and you will probably have very little left.

A flavorful and easy way to prepare a vegetable that is often overlooked. Everyone enjoyed it and the vegan guest was thrilled.

I love cauliflower but find it rather bland. The horseradish was perfect and be sure to use all that is called for! I used organic heavy cream instead of half & half, too, and all I can say is WOW!

I've made this frequently. One thing I love about the recipe is its versatility - sometimes I add broccoli, sometimes use a combo of Parmesan and Gruyere instead of Fontina, often use Panko vs bread crumbs. It's fabulous, adapts well to creativity, and is often requested.

Loved this dish! I needed more color on my plates, so substituted part broccoli and threw in some brussel sprouts for good measure. I used gruyere cheese, and melted it into the white sauce for better texture. Had a large dinner party and most could not finish their dinners, but they requested "doggie bags" to take this home. The horseradish is not at all overpowering. Do use fresh breadcrumbs, though. It is worth the effort.

This was pretty good, but not fabulous. I agree, there should be cheese in the sauce, like most gratins.

I forgot to add - I used gruyere instead of fontina b/c I had it on hand and it was great. In fact, the second time I made it I purchased gruyere specifically for this dish b/c it was so good.

I made this recipe the weekend before Christmas and then repeated it for Christmas dinner because we all loved it. My family had seconds and thirds. Some family members thought it was a potato dish - however, I made this instead of potatoes given the low carb craze. The horseradish, although detectable isn't overwhelming. It's amazing 7 T of horseradish doesn't clean out your sinuses, but it apparently mellows considerably when baked. A delicious dish. I had people begging for the recipe.

This was fabulous - made it for Thanksgiving and again for Christmas. My only change was to add extra horseradish. Even the very picky non-vegetable-eating in-laws had several helpings of this dish. The leftovers are great too.

Outstanding recipe! I've made this dish twice now, and it is my new favorite veggie casserole. As a student living alone I'm always looking for delicious, cheap, one-dish dinners that are easy to make and will last a few days. This recipe wins: affordable, easy, very very tasty. The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty good. The second time was the bomb; I added more horseradish, mixed cauliflower with broccoli, used less bread crumbs, and used smoked Fontina cheese on top of the bread crumbs instead of over it (by mistake, heh...but it worked). It's amazing how such "sharp-tasting" flavors mellow out and mingle after baking. Unique, nutty flavors that beat the pants off the usual soggy bland green bean casserole that everyone makes with sodium-laden Campbells Soup...but I digress. Even if you don't love cauliflower or horseradish, consider trying this anyway, don't tell the family what it is and you'll be fine. ;D

This was a great make ahead recipe. I used the creamy horseradish as a reviewer had suggested. I HATE horseradish, but this was delicious. Because I had to keep the dish hot in a thermal bag for two hours, I skipped the breadcrumbs. Added them to the reheated leftovers next day and would certainly use them if I could. I think this will become a favourite for company and family.

Loved this recipe! Who knew that I liked cauliflower so much! I've made it several times and my husband (and anyone else that has tried it) loved it. Quick note---the first time I tried to cut a corner and not use fresh breadcrumbs. BIG MISTAKE!!! It is really bad unless you use fresh.

This dish is wonderful! The recipe is easy to make, yet offers complex flavors. Although Fontina is delicious in the gratin, many other types of cheese substitute nicely. We used gruyere and tt was outstanding with short ribs finished in a mustard cream reduction. Yum!

Really good--even non-cauliflower fans had second helpings. The horseradish was zippy, but not too strong. A good Thanksgiving vegetable dish.

This was delicious and got many rave reviews at the Thanksgiving Table. I did play with the flavors too however and used swiss and cheddar cheeses, used less breadcrumbs and some additional cheese on top. I did not find the tastes overpowering at all but watch what horseradish you use - I decided to use creamy instead of straight and I think it was less potent with the flavor still evident.

I made it for Thanksgiving and didn't receive any complaints, but it definitely wasn't the highlight of dinner. The initial taste was pleasant enough, but I thought that the horseradish aftertaste was overpowering. If I ever made this again, I would definitely watch how much I added.

Sorry folks! This sounded good, and the reviews supported that, but it just wasn't that great. Made it as written (why isn't the cheese in the sauce???), and we just think it's mediocre. The kids didn't like it (and they eat all sorts of things). I'll probably try using my standard sharp cheddar cheese sauce and breadcrumbs (I like the horseradish idea) on steamed cauliflower in the future. This isn't worth the price of Fontina.

Rating: 4
This has become a Thanksgiving Day favorite at my table over the past few years. I take a few liberties with the Cheese, Horseradish and wine vinegar to taste to my liking, but the basis for the recipe is the same. I always suggest steaming your cauliflower a few minutes before hitting the oven with it. Makes it moister and a little softer. Enjoy.

Finally we have found the perfect cauliflower recipe. Everyone loved this dish and the horseradish was not overpowering but leant a subtle zing to the delicious cheesey cream sauce. I thought the crumbs only enhanced the dish. Fabulous! ADDENDUM: Doesn't freeze well - reheating it made it mushy and it lost some of it's unique flavour.

Everyone seems to like this recipe except us!! I served this to company, made EXACTLY as the recipe is written, and the opinion of all eight at the table was UGH!! These were guests who eat everything and anything, too, are so easy to cook for as I have for over 40 years!! Long-time friends and HONEST. I threw out the leftovers as well as what was left on the plates....

wanted to try this for just the two of us, so i scaled things back for one head of cauliflower. used fat-free half and half and a mixture of swiss and cheddar since i didn't have the fontina. all right--skipped the crumb topping too. but we really liked it and will definitely make it again!

Perfect winter comfort food - even if it was 80 here degrees today. Fast, easy and delicious but did use a lot of pots and pans. Had only one head of cauliflower so made one-third a recipe. Good for two generous servings. No half-and-half so used non-fat milk. No fontina so indulged and used Comte we had on hand. No horseradish so doubled dijon mustard. And we always have plenty of breadcrumbs in the freezer - save leftover bread, dry it, crush it in the blender, et voila! This gratin was so yummy!

This was wonderful! I had quite a crowd for Christmas dinner and they would have eaten twice as much. And this was after having to rescue it after the top fell off the salt shaker as I was "salting to taste".....

YUM. I used gruyere, but next time wouldn't bother with anything expensive and would just use regular swiss. The horseradish taste means you probably would be unlikely to tell the difference. Really delicious.

I made this recipe for my visiting family and received rave reviews. I was initially nervous because my mother and horseradish don't mix, but much to my surprise, she couldn't stop talking about how good it was. I made it with the half and half; I will try again with milk and see if the recipe loses too much. I only cooked the breadcrumbs in the saucepan for a couple of minutes instead of the full 9 minutes and they turned out fine.

Made this as a vegetarian dish and thought it was good. Made it again to serve with roast beef and yorkshire pudding and it was a fantastic accompniment (sp?). And I am someone who hated beef and horseradish! It doesn't suffer at all from being made entirely with semi-skimmed milk.

If you like horseradish, you'll love this dish. Even if you're not partial to horseradish, it's not over powering. It's excellent served with prime rib. Half broccoli and half cauliflower, would make it a more colorful dish. I used 1% milk to make it a healthier dish and don't think it affected the flavors.
