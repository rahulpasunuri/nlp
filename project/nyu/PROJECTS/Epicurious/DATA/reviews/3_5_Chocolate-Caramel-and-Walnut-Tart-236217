I LOVE this tart. It has been one of my holiday favorites and my guests love it. It is worth the effort!! Don't overbake the crust. I had the original recipe from a Gourmet magazine from November 1997 or 1998, and held on to it every holiday, but then couldn't find it this holiday and was distraught!!! Thank you Epicurious for having it on this site!!!! You just don't know how much I thank you!!!!!

I've made a variation of this recipe a few times and it has been the dessert of choice even against proven classics my family enjoys. However, those who reviewed and said it is too sweet/intense are correct. As I learned the first time I made it, the intensity needs to be mellowed. I recommend the following. Omit the unsweetened chocolate and increase the bittersweet chocolate to 3 tbsp. Reduce the honey to 1 tbsp. It is still a candy bar of a dessert, but these two minor changes made it possible to enjoy a sliver piece as a nice finish to a family gathering.

I made this and shipped it overnight to WA for my sister's birthday. I made it in a 9in tart pan and made mini tarts in a muffin pan so I could taste the recipe. The flavor was very nice and it had nice texture. It is quite rich so a little goes a long way. It's probably easier to make the caramel sauce when you are not watching a baby at the same time, but it did turn out well. When I poured in the cream it did not bubble over, but did turn into a thick caramel slab which was unexpected. Maybe a temperature thing? I haven't made many caramel sauces. I kept stirring and stirring and it turned into a lovely caramel sauce. So keep at it! All in all very good if you want a rich chocolate tart. It shipped well packed between styrofoam and cold packs.

If you like 3 sugars in your coffee you will love this. 4 of my 8 guests at a BBQ over the weekend could not eat more than one mouthful. It was far too sweet for our taste.

This was so easy to make and delicious. It was actually better the next day because it hardened. My husband claims this is his favorite tart.
