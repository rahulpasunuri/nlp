I make these all the time! Great vegetarian option or you can always add some sausage or pepperoni. It's a versatile base to add other goodies to the spinach saute mix, like mushrooms, etc. Definitely a winner!

This was excellent. I followed the directions exactly and was very pleased with the result. It took a little longer than I expected. The flavors of the oil cured olives, the roasted peppers and the smoked mozzarella cheese blended perfectly. It probably also helped that I used a sweet Vidalia onion, and it was nearly caramelized after cooking for ten minutes. If I were to do anything differently, I would probably replace half the roasted red peppers with oil-packed sundried tomatoes.

Not worth the effort to get the premade dough stretched out and over the calzone filling! Might make again as a pizza.

These calzones have become our standard Sunday Night Football food. We absolutely love them. We omitted the olives as they make the crust too soggy and used a variety of cheese for more flavor - Mozzarella, Fontina and Parmesan. For a prettier presentation, brush the tops of the calzones with olive oil and sprinkle dried basil and Parmesan cheese on top. And of course, don't forget lots of Marinara on the side...my favorite is Rao's!

My family LOVE this one! I have an 11,6,3,and 1 year old. All loved these. They thought it was better than ordering pizza. I also made some with some turkey pepperoni and a little bit of pizza sauce and they were a big hit.

We loved this recipe. I would make it again in a heartbeat. I omitted the olives but added a little spicy pasta sauce and pepperoni. I didn't use as much spinach as the recipe called for. Definitely a fav.

I wouldn't make this again. The taste was just ok and I didn't find it quick or easy because of working with the pizza dough which, well, like I said, I don't think is quick or easy.

We made these at home for a Sunday dinner and it was yummy and easy. My fiance added some sausage to his and we both omitted the black olives. We traded in smoked mozz for asagio and parmeasan cheese, served with some homemade sauce and it was fantastic.

This recipe will please foodies and cautious eaters. I wasn't in the mood for olives so I substituted in artichokes and added some goat cheese. This will definitely be in my monthly rotation.

Like the others, I used marinara sauce for dipping. Using my own dough, the bake time was more like 20 minutes. This is a good recipe for families with children. My three year old got to make his own...What a mess!

Yum! We've made this a couple times. My husband likes making yeast breads so he makes dough (rather than buying some) and we use regular mozzarella instead of smoked. Serve it with marinara on the side for dipping. Yum!

Easy and good! I added red pepper flakes and a bit of raisins. I like the pesto idea from the previous cook, will try next time.

This was good! The smoked Mozz was excellent and melted so nicely. I didn't have olives so I used marinated artichokes instead (i realize this isn't a substitute...) Also put a little pesto in a couple for a bit of variety - easy weeknight meal!

this was pretty good. i didn't care for the taste of the olives in it though, and i love olives. i added some pine nuts and a little marinara on top. i probably wouldn't make it again - there are better meatless calzone recipes out there.

Liked it! All kinds of possibilities here...we used an good quality unfrozen pizza dough (Portland Pie Factory)...next time we may use whatever we have laying around...although the smoked mozzarella added some, I think you could use any good melting cheese you had laying about..we like spicy food,so added zing is what we do...cayenne, garlic..whatever!
