For a very easy dinner, this was a keeper. However, I would not plan to make this for company. I had fresh Stripped Bass (lucky me lives at the ocean and caught some yesterday), so I grabbed whatever I had in the cabinet and off I went. Simple, healthy and I feel like I ate well.

I followed the directions exactly until I noticed that the seabass we purchased at Trader Joe's tonight seemed pretty dry on the surface to have the almond/flour mixture stick before cooking. Thus, I decided to make a quick egg bath, and since the white wine bottle was sitting right there waiting for the sauce at the end, I added probably 2 T. to the egg bath to thin it a bit. This definitely helped the almond/flour coating stick better. Two thoughts: I wonder how well the cooking part of the dish would do in olive oil, especially the fish. Also, I was wishing for a little more sauce over the fish at the end. Tasty and quick. Oh, yeah, and next time, we'll do a better job of snipping the stems of the watercress. Duh.

If possible DO NOT SUBSTITUTE INGREDIENTS: watercress has a very distinctive flavor that no spinach can match. Although other fish could work, sea bass is best. Serve with "Baked Sweet Potatoes w/Scallions and Cilantro" and a glass of good white wine. It's worth the effort and money.

This one was "ok"...didn't love it. Watercress wasn't available, so I served it over spinach sauteed with shallots. Not sure if I'll make it again...not much punch. If I'm lucky enough to get my hands on some more striped bass, I'll probably try a different recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as provided using Virginia Striped Sea Bass. It was excellent in terms of taste and presentation. My wife and I agreed that it was a real keeper; very easy and quick to prepare and without a rich sauce.

I made this dish for Mother's Day with my in-laws, and it received rave reviews. I substituted scrod for the fish, but prepared the side dishes suggested. My husband said it was the best fish he's had in a long time. A snap to prepare.

Followed reviews advice and served ut atop sauteed spinach with garlice. Used less butter (2T) and less flour 2(T). It is very good,I believe the simplest things are the best. By the way I used Chilean Sea Bass...(I know how un-PC of me)

This is a spectacular, quickly prepared luncheon meal (altho we enjoy it for a light dinner). I usually make it with less expensive fish than the sea bass: both orange roughy and talapia are excellent.

I love to take a recipe like this and mold it to my own tastes. I too used halibut, added some dried tarragon to the almond coating, and used baby spinach instead of watercress, which I wilted in the pan after adding the wine. Served the fish on top of the wilted spinach with baked sweet potatoes. My boyfriend was delighted to have such an elegant dinner on a Tuesday night!

I used halibut which ended up in chunks instead of strips, but it was still very yummy. Next time I'll use less butter to make it a little healthier. I served it as recommended with roasted potatoes and asparagus with goat cheese sauce, and it was a very nice meal.

very good recipe! I substituted spinach for the watercress, olive oil for the butter and forgot the white wine sauce, it was still great!

Very attractive looking, but just a little ordinary. A good way to incorporate a salad into the entree. There was more breading than needed; next time I will prepare less. A nice recipe, but not super memorable.
