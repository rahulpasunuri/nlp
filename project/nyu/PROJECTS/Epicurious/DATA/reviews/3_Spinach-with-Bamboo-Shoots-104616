Eh... good accompaniment but don't expert it to hold its own. Would make again for an evening of Asian food. Bamboo doesn't have much flavor.

I used young spinach and the oil and sugar was too much for it - it was a little too sweet and slimy. I will make this again with normal older spinach and probably half the oil and sugar.

Great way to prepare spinach. I balked at the amount of oil, 1/4 cup?!?!? No way. I used about a tablespoon of peanut oil with a dash of sesame oil for taste.

My husband really liked this dish, I was a bit lukewarm, hence the rating.

Made for the third time, but added sliced water chestnuts this time! Yum! Great alternative. Be sure to double this recipe.

I found this recipe when doing a search for bamboo shoots, after finding some fresh ones in an Asian market. Great way to cook spinach! This is so tasty, and a good presentation because it stays bright green. I will easily do without the bamboo shoots in the future. Even fresh, they didn't have much flavor.

Oh so good but felt a little guilty about all the oil. Now I know why the greens they serve in Chinese restaurants taste so good. The recipe doesn't mention it but you need to stem the spinach before you cook it.

Awesome recipe! I was looking for a creative way to make spinach, and this is it. Incredible, the sugar and salt really make a difference.

Yummy, quick. I thought I'd be adding sesame seeds or sesame oil for flavor or interest but it has plenty of flavor and color without adding anything.
