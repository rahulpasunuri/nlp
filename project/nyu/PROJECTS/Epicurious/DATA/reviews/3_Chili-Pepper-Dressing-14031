I only followed the general gist of the recipe. I used preserved New Mexico green chilis, preserved jalapenos and the vinegar they came in, and preserved chipotle chile. I also added a little apple cider vinegar, tripled the garlic, skipped the roasted peppers, and added red pepper flakes. My dressing came out great. I used it at a BBQ and the guests loved it. The recipe here seems to take too long for too little flavor.
