Sans tacky monkier, heywood's got a point - chicken hearts ARE very affordable. While they're probably not something I would serve to an uninitiated guest, I enjoy them myself at home. They're also good sauteed in this marinade with a little peanut oil and some cornstarch right at the end to thicken it up.

I liked it, simple and easy to make. I added one thing -- brushed honey onto it before grilling. Makes it taste better for me.
