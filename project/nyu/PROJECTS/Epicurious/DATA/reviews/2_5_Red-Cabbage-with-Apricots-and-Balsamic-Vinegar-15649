This dish is a delicious, beautiful and festive addition to a holiday table. We've made it for several special occasion dinners and it's always a hit, even with the decidedly anti-vegetable crowd. Yum.

Use dried cranberries and brown sugar instead of apricots and jam for a real winner.

Easy, quick and very tasty (perhaps the one fork cooks cooked too long, didn't measure properly?). I am not a vegetable person and I have three children so pickiness and time are major factors. Don't miss this recipe - it's yummy!

We have made this dish a regular part of our thanksgiving dinner ever since I discovered it (4-5 years I'd guess). I was suprised by the weak reviews and felt compelled to write in. The dish is not for everyone but we like the sweet-sour comination. The only downside is that it is not a "pretty" dish. However, a creative cook can remedy that with service dishes and adding a garnish.

Not a hit whatsoever, and with 12 diners in attendance only a fraction was eaten. I like cabbage and realize that many others don't but, I wasn't crazy over it either. Too bad, the recipe really did look interesting! I really felt compelled to add my comments here, I wouldn't want anyone else to go forth unwarned!!!

Based on the recipe and others' rave reviews, I made this for a Thanksgiving dinner this year and it was not at all as good as I had hoped. The vinegar was overpowering, the cabbage faded to a pink and the apricots were hardly noticeable. So much for trying to add a healthful dish to the traditional meal. I'll go back to green beans with fried onion rings next year.

Very good, quick and easy to make (the hardest part is slicing up the dried apricots) and reheats beautifully. Actually serves 8 generously (or maybe my cabbage was a bit bigger than expected?) Anyway, expect leftovers!
