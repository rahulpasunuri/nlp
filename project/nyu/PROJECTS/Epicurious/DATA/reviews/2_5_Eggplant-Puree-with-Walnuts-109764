This is a better version of the classic Greek eggplant dip - the walnuts add a much-needed texture and the eggplants aren't as strong and bitter as usual. I used 2 cloves of garlic and substituted rice vinegar for the red wine vinger. I don't usually eat eggplants (I think I might be a little allergic to them) but everyone I served this too told me it was fantastic.

I used pine nuts instead of walnuts, cut the acid in half and didn't worry about removing the seeds and it was delicious.

I was not not "wowed" by this dish. That being said, I liked it and will probably like it more when I do some adjustments. I did the whole thing by hand, so it was very rustic and I seemed to have no problem removing most of the eggplant seeds with a little patience. I did add the vinegar and lemon juice to taste, rather than trust a recipe on blind faith, so I did not find it overly tangy at all. I will probably make this again, but will probably add something green to brighten it up.

I tried this recipe, I adjusted it, and was so disappointed. The terms stunk may not be OK for snobby people trying to be foodies, but for regular cooks trying to excel at home, this was exactly what everyone said: too tangy, acidic, and MOST IMPORTANTLY nobody came back for a second dip, especially me. Perhaps readers should focus on rating the recipe instead of criticising people's reviews: I wish I would have skipped this dog of a recipe and gone for a good baba ganoush instead. Sorry for another bad review but it did indeed suck!

Two words: baba ghanoush.

2tb lemon juice plus 1-2tb vinegar sounds too much. Better not to add all at once.

I'm on the fence about this recipe, but I will probably make it again. I think I may have put too much red wine vinegar; it was a bit too tangy. It was nearly impossible to seed the eggplant, so I ended up with a lot of seeds, but it wasn't too bitter...still something is missing. maybe some bits of kalamata olives? Not sure if that would work with walnuts... sorry for the wishy-washy review:(
