This cake is delicious. It is best to melt the chocolate in the hot coffee and then add at the end. It tastes better if it sits overnight before serrving. I did not make the pears or the whipped cream but served it with vanilla ice cream and warm applesauce. It would be good with chocolate sauce and perhaps a la mode with chocolate and coffee ice cream. It also baked in about 45 minutes in a convection overn.

I cannot give this recipe any forks because it was truly awful! I made the cake exactly as described in the recipe, with the pears and the coffee whipped cream. I had to assure my guests that they didn't have to eat it, and not one did! After a single taste we all agreed it was terrible. The pears were just okay, and the whipped cream was good.

Made this cake for Xmas and it was delicious - a great balance of all flavors - you'd never know there was a cup of molasses and a cup of olive oil - how bizarre! Very moist and the pears were a perfect compliment - instead of whip cream we did home made vanilla ice cream. very moist - an excellent choice.

Used canola oil instead of olive oil, melted 60% cocoa choc chips in hot coffee before adding to mix, and chopped the crystallized ginger quite fine. Otherwise followed recipe exactly and had no settling problems as described in other reviews here. Not a really sweet cake, so the whipped cream is an excellent addition. I never could get the pear syrup to reduce to the volume stated in the recipe (tried twice). Anyone have any idea what went wrong? I used raw sugar, which you can't really pack, so I wonder if that had something to do with it.

I love complex tastes and am very rarely taken by sweets. This (at least the cake part) is exceptional.I made it with hardly sweetened cream and more simple poached pears. Yum. Everyone oooed and aaawed. Cake stands on its own.

Very festive for Christmas! I skipped the pears and instead served it with a hot bittersweet chocolate sauce (recipe here on epicurious) and freshly made whipped cream.

This was delicious. I'm not a huge fan of gingerbread, but all the additional ingredients like coffee and chocolate made this a hit with our dinner club. Would make it again!!!

I made a few changes so my "good" review is based on that fact (perhaps created to the letter makes it a 4 forker). The most disappointing thing is how the heavy melted chocolate sunk to the bottom and ruined the consistency, making a mess when it came out of the pan and to eat. But in fairness I did make substitutions: I ran out of molasses and subbed maple syrup for half; didn't use crystallized ginger (added 1 T of real shredded ginger) and used a loaf pan instead of bundt pan. If I make this again I will sub canola oil for olive oil (too oily) and skip the chocolate.

This is delicious but..........melt the chocolate chips in the hot coffee before you add it to the batter. Otherwise you will end up with chocolate chips at the bottom of the cake that will stick when you turn it out of the pan. I did not use the candied ginger, don't like the taste or texture.

Wow! I have never had the entire family rave about a dish I made before. That sure felt good. I made the cake and pears exactly as called for. Changed the whipped cream by adding Frangelico and Kahlua and left out the coffee. Wonderful.

I doubled this dish and made it for a holiday potluck. To make it portable, I assembled it as a trifle: a layer of cubed cake, followed by pears and whipped cream, then another layer of each and a sprinkle of chopped crystallized ginger for decoration. I actually left the crystallized ginger out of the cake by accident. But it was rich and delicious anyway, almost like a chocolate spice cake. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips. Very impressive dish! The pears were a bit sweet, though.

I absolutely love ginger, so when I saw this recipe that combines ginger with my two other favorites, chocolate and coffee, I HAD to give it a try! I used a standard 12-cup bundt pan and had no problems with overflow. The cake popped out of the pan without any problems, and the flavor is absolutely wonderful. Those who expect this to be a chocolate cake with a hint of ginger and coffee will be disappointed. It is a delicious gingerbread; the chocolate and coffee simply intensify the richness and depth of the ginger flavor. The texture is moist, and the chocolate and ginger chunks are a nice addition. True, they did sink to the bottom, but I don't see that as a problem. The only change I made to this recipe was to substitute canola oil for the olive oil. The batter does seem very thin, but don't be concerned. It turns out just fine. Next time, I'll try the pears and whipped cream with it, but it can definitely stand alone, no problem. I dusted it with powdered sugar before serving.

This flavor combo is amazing. I baked in a sheet pan, soaked with pear syrup, sliced then layered with poached pears and coffee cream in a trifle dish. Soo good and not bundt pan issues that other posters mentioned.

This cake is to die for, and far exceeded our expectations, especially after reading some of the lukewarm reviews posted here. As mentioned, it is not a chocolate cake, but a true gingerbread with subtle hints of chocolate. You really don't taste the coffee, except to enhance the other flavors. It's easy to make, goes together quickly, and ours came out exactly like the picture. The instructions to butter, flour and then spray the bundt pan seemed like overkill, but worked great. We will make this cake again, for sure, and not even bother with the pears and the whipped cream - it doesn't need them. Be sure to use the soft candied ginger that comes in a little bag and not hard, crystallized ginger that comes in spice bottles. Mine was perfectly cooked in exactly 60 minutes in my convection oven, and had an elegant, tender interior and a slightly crisp exterior, with tiny bits of chocolate and ginger in evidence but not too much. I wonder if the folks who experienced "explosions" in their ovens used baking powder instead of baking soda? We have had to force ourselves to only eat one piece of it at a time. Highly recommended.

I should start by saying that I don't have a sweet tooth, and usually do not have dessert, however, I made this for a semi formal dinner party for 8, and I have never had a dessert that I liked more. It was unbelievable. Everyone loved it. I made no changes, and I have had to print off the recipe for everyone who came. The syrup from poaching the pears was fantastic drizzled on the cake, and the whip cream was perfect... not too sweet which was great!!!... definately will make over and over again...

I made just the cake last night and since it was a last minute decision, I didn't have chocolate squares or crystalized ginger. For the chocolate, I substituted an equivalent quantity of high quality chocolate powder (1/2 cup), which I mixed into the hot coffee to dissolve. I used 1 Tbl of good quality ground ginger. I also reduced the cloves to 1/4 teas and added a little extra cinnamon. I was disappointed when a portion of the cake stuck to the bottom of the pan. The texture is a bit oily and I think the molasses flavor is a bit overpowering. I'll make this again, but with less oil and molasses, using quantities similar to a standard gingerbread recipe, which calls for 1/2 cup vs 1 cup of both.

I made the gingerbread part of this recipe for a party. The flavor was nice, but all of the chocolate chips and crystallized ginger pieces sunk to the bottom of my bundt pan - or the top of the cake when served. I had even dusted the pieces with flour as other posters suggested. I would not make this cake again as the recipe indicates. If I make it again I will try using butter in place of oil. I think the sinkage problem was due to the batter being so wet from the olive oil and the coffee.

I thought the molasses overpowered the other flavors in the cake with only hints of chocolate and ginger. Pears were delicious and would make them again.

I am so gratified to read that someone else experienced an explosion in the oven after following directions precisely! In my case, I substituted 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup oil for the fats, but I have done this many times without incident in all kinds of cake recipes. The only thing I can think of is that perhaps my bundt pan is too small; I'm pretty sure it's a standard size, but I did notice that the batter came up more than 2/3 of the way to the top. I don't know as I would make this again.

I made the pears and cake for different dinner parties. Both recipes were great. I added some dried fruit (apricots, cherries) to the pear recipe, and served them with angel food cake. Yum! Even my 6 year old granddaughter loved it. And I just served the cake on its own, and everyone loved it, although my husband, who tends not to like anything chocolate, said he would have preferred more crystallized ginger and no chocolate pieces (not gonna happen). I didn't use the olive oil - substituted canola oil.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! People were freaking out! The pears and whipped cream are an absolute must, and add so much to the flavorful cake. Not difficult to prepare at all, will definitely be making this again and again.

1. Excellent, rich, decadent dessert. No need to poach any pears or whip up any cream. 2. Chocolate did not melt all the way and so sank to bottom of cake pan; inverted the pan and chunks of chocolate were now on top of the baked cake; not bad. 3. Is olive oil necessary? I used it, but wouldn't canola do just as well? 4. Not a big hit at the office; I think it just doesn't sound yummy, but to me this was fantastic!!

After reading the recipe, I tossed the chopped chocolate and chopped ginger with a tablespoon of flour before adding to the batter; this allowed the two ingredients to remain dispersed throughout the cake instead of sinking to ther bottom. Other than that I followed the recipe but omitted the poached pears. Instead, I poured a chocolate glaze over the cake, which I borrowed from a Pumpkin Chocolate Bundt Cake, and I also made the flavored whipped cream. Although I had reservations while preparing this cake, the result was absolutely wonderful, and everyone loved it. I will be making this again.

I made this yummy sounding gingerbread this morning. The directions and measurements were followed precisely. The batter was poured into a 12 cup bundt pan and to my surprise rose over the top of the pan after 20 minutes of baking. The kitchen was filled with smoke. Despite this the flavor of the cake is nice. I did have a problem keeping the candied ginger in suspension...most ended up on the top.

I made this tonight for dessert. It was easy but a bit different than other cakes I've made. Given that its made with olive oil as the fat, the batter was a little runnier than I expected (which made me a bit nervous). However, after 55 minutes in the oven, it came out beautifully. I didn't make the poached pears and left out the coffee in the whipped cream though. The cake was pretty moist and had a good flavor. The flavor is a bit unexpected given that the cake looks like just a plain chocolate bundt cake. I'd definitely make it again. In fact, I'm making it for a bake sale on Wednesday.
