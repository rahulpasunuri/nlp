This is an easy chicken recipe if you have a juicer to squeeze the 12 lemons. The golden brown skin makes a beautiful presentation. Good to serve for a crowd. My guests raved about the flavor and tenderness. Made a gravy from the lemon pan juices.

Made this for my HOG (Harley Owners Group) friends at a dinner party following our first spring ride. They rated it with four "Oinks"; 4 forks really. The most delicious and tender chicken ever. I added some dry white wine to the marinade. The honey glaze browns the chicken nicely; it makes a great presentation. We're making it again soon.

This dish was simple to make and tasted amazing! My husband said I had to make this dish more often. A caesar salad with it really compliments the chicken.

This is one of my favorite chicken recipes, and it's very easy. We often use Cornish hens instead of chicken, as the little birds cook faster.

I don't know why, but for me the recipe was bland. It definitely was juicy, but it needed other spices. Also, I would recommend not heating up the honey, because it just runs off the chicken when poured on it. It's better at room temperature so it sticks to the chicken.

I made this for Passover this year, and it was OUTSTANDING! For reasons unnecessary to mention, I made it the day before I served it, following the recipe exactly; the next day I cut the chicken into pieces, drizzled it with a little honey, and rewarmed it under foil. It was still moist and delicious. It's a keeper for year-round, not just Pesach!

This was amazingly good - wasn't that optimistic given the few ingredients, but the flavor and appearance were superb. Starting the roasting with the breast-side down really works well. I will make this again.

I served this for relatives visiting with two teens who are somewhat picky eaters. Everyone loved it. The kids asked for seconds! The chicken turns out tender and moist; the honey and lemon glaze makes it very satisfying comfort food.

What a great way to enjoy chicken. It was so tender and juicy. Definitely a dish I would be proud to serve.

We absolutely loved this!! My husband, infact, said this was one of the best dinners he has had in a long time. This was super easy to prepare and make. I used only fresh lemon juice and didn't use the roasting rack. I added some garlic powder, and pepper to the chicken before I baked it and I INCLUDED the lemon juice (from the bag) into the pan. Why waste a good thing?! I will definitely make this again and I will recommend it to friends and family. I guess you could use other citrus fruits (oranges, limes) for a different flavor. You won't be disappointed. Tender, melt in-your-mouth, flavorful chicken that's not too sweet. A winner!!

I noticed the other reviewers were afraid this recipe would be bland, so they added various ingredients to the recipe. I was also strongly tempted to add stuff to it (especially since I had quantities of various fresh herbs on hand), but on a whim for once I followed the recipe straight through. The result was one of the most flavorful, juicy whole roast chickens i have ever had. I am glad i restrained myself from adding the herbs, since the sweet flavor of the subtly lemon-scented chicken flesh was marvelous, and the skin was crispy and sweet with a nice lemon tang. I'm sure the addition of other ingredients were wonderful, but try making this as is at least once! The only thing I would recommend is double-bagging the chickens in the freezer bags while you marinate them in the lemon juice. We had a small but aggravating mishap when one of the bags tore a leak while we were turning the chickens in the fridge.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe after looking at the picture and reading the reviews. I did make it in my clay baker like one of the other reviewers and that may have been part of the problem since I put the marinating liquid in the clay baker with the chicken. I am going to make this recipe one more time not using the clay baker and follow the recipe exactly since all the ingredients should make a delicious chicken.

I made this dish in my clay chicken brick and it turned out absolutely delicious! I put some chopped carrots and zucchini underneath and sprinkled it with fresh basil leaves. I stuffed the chicken with lots of fresh parsley and some garlic cloves. It was so easy to make and we all loved it, especially our children!

The recipe sounded good, but possibly too bland, so I spiced it up a little! I added 3 cloves sliced fresh garlic, LOTS of fresh basil, lemon slices and a little white wine to the marinade. I also used a whole cut-up chicken. After marinating, I roasted the chicken at 425 degrees for 20 minutes with the marinade in the pan for basting. After 20 minutes, I turned the chicken and continued roasting for another 30 minutes. I then glazed the chicken with honey and continued roasting for another 20 minutes, basting occasionally. After roasting, I skimmed the fat from the pan juices, basted the chicken with the juices and returned to the oven for 5 minutes. YUM!!

I've been looking for a recipe that is similar to the one our local grocery offers in their deli (rotissere). I add some fresh herbs and grated lemon peel and I'm liberal with the honey! It's turned out good both times I've made it.

I made this using Cornish Game Hens. I thought they were bland, and with all the chicken recipes out there not one of the better ones on this site.

A fabulous dish! Easy to do and delicious just as written. I'm sure it will also be a great basic recipe with many yummy variations possible.

This was actually very good. I followed the recpie, altering only the cooking times to adapt to my oven. The chicken looked great, nice and brown and crispy. It was very moist and tender. I roasted some carrots underneath the chicken and they were good as well, maybe a tad too lemony. Easy and a keeper in my book!

This recipe is not only easy to make it is delicious! I was afraid it would be bland but the chicken was the juiciest and most flavorful I have ever had. My dinner party raved it was the best chicken they had ever tasted. I added chopped fresh rosemary while it marinated over night and it is really spectacular.
