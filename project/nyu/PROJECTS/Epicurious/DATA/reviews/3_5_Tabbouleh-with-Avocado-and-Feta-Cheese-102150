I loved this recipe. It will be a great addition to our rotation, especially in the spring and summer. I made it with all the ingredients it called for (you should buy the fresh spices!). Like others, I added a little extra lemon. Make sure the water you put in the bulgur is really hot, and double-check that ALL the bulgur is tender before mixing it in.

Of course I tweeked the recipe...Left out mint (increased the parsley) and avocado, used cooked barley instead of bulgur (which I could not find) and increased the lemon juice to one lemon's worth...Fantastic.

This is a keeper. I used chopped red pepper for the tomato (hubby won't eat raw tomato), and added chicken suggested by another reviewer. Great!

Made this last night. Terrific recipe. A keeper.

Excellent! I also mixed the avocado in with the cracked wheat. I used 4 tb oil, and cherry tomatoes. This is a a great hot-weather recipe since it requires virtually no heat. Also, it makes use of summer produce. I served it on raw spinach. When I make it again, I will double the feta.

Easy and tasty. I skipped the radishes and the green onion. Next time I'll add more bulgar to balance out the feta. I served the tabbouleh in a whole-wheat pita and loved it.

I love this recipe and make it all the time. I throw in sauteed chicken breast chunks to make it a complete meal. Delicious!

I haven't made tabbouleh for years and this was great. The addition of the feta and avocado (which I chopped into small dice and tossed through the salad) was a nice change. I also added a bit more lemon and mint.

One of my best friends brought this to our Middle Eastern Themed cooking club dinner and it was a hit! I plan to make it time and again. Nice texture and great taste~ Delish!

The best tabbouleh I have ever had - there is usually a bowl of it in the fridge during the warmer months. Sometimes I add pitted kalamata olives but making it exactly as written is fantastic.

Absolutely delicious!

We substituted couscous for tabouleh and let it cool as we prepared the other ingredients and made the Spicy Avocado Soup (very delicious). We deleted the mint and radishes, added 2 chopped bell peppers, doubled the feta cheese to 1 whole cup, and added 1 more avocado (for a total of 3). A very good dish.

Fantastic! Followed the recipe in detail, the first time. Used feta cheese imported from Greece; the grocer cut a piece from a round of cheese in a brine filled wooden barrel. Second time: used 3/4 cup of feta, left out the mint but added 18 Kalamata olives pitted and sliced thin. These were also a product of Greece and are far superior to those grown in the US. They added a nice flavour.Buying these items "in bulk" appeals to my Scottish ancestory. Great dish!

It's a very good tabbouleh, but I would add more feta and bulgur at a minimum, if not black olives and/opr toasted pine nuts perhaps...

Absolutely delish! Good ratio of bulgur to veg. I tossed avocado slices with salad, rather than using as a garnish--adds a nice creamy texture to an already good food. The feta bits were a great compliment--tiny little bursts of flavor. This dish will be made often

Great light salad & healthy too. It was easy to prepare and delicious. Will make it again as soon as my avacado ripens.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe at all. It seemed to be missing something and I still can't place what it needs. ALso thought there was too much dressing given the amount of bulgar. Maybe it was just me but I wouldn't make it again!

This is a really great take on your standard tabbouleh. My husband is Middle Eastern and he really loved it. Great for when you want to do something a bit different.
