I was sceptical about the combination of celery and cucumber, yet I decided to make it. It turned I was right: the flavours didn't match and the texture wasn't right. I ended up throwing half of it in the bin.

I'm giving this 3 forks but next time I'm cutting the lemon juice in half. My son thought it was good but I could only eat a little bit because it was so sour. I did use sour cream instead of the yogart and chose to use the parsley over the cilantro.. I'm sure with less lemon juice it will be just delicious.. thus, the three forks...

Nice, simple salad recipe. I thought the cilantro was a bit strong. For those who want a subtler taste, I'd cut the cilantro down to one tablespoon instead of two.

This was great. This dish was perfect to cut through the richness of our main dish, Lobster Bisque (also on this site). I actually used fresh, chopped mint, added a sprinkle of sugar, a lot of lemon juice and let the flavors combine for about a half-hour. Actually, I didn't use celery either, I forgot to pick it up at the grocery store. I also left out the olive oil-I really don't think you need it.

I did not have the yogurt but instead used light sour cream. After having the first night added onion, 1/2 tsp. sugar and cut up basil leaves and now this is a very special tasting salad.
