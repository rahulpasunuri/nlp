I haven't tried this recipe yet - I can't figure out how much cooked pasta to put in? Where does it say? Thanks!

Satisfying! I skipped the zucchini and replaced the tofu with chickpeas. I couldn't find any abc or star noodles so I used Annie's Homegrown Bunny Shape organic pasta noodles instead.

I thought this was a waste of the homemade chicken stock I used, as well as the time spent to cut veggies into tiny dice. I had made it for dinner last night, with high hopes, but I thought it was so tasteless I served sandwiches instead. However, my 4 yo son was so thrilled with it when I tested it on him for lunch today, he scooped out the veggies remaining at the bottom of the bowl with his fingers. What can I say.

My kids, age 2 & 3, ate it up. I added a little rice to their bowls & they went back for seconds. My husband & I enjoyed it too but I made it for the kids. Very easy to make.

My family loved this. (even my husband who usually won't go near tofu) I thought it was a nice, simple soup and tasted fresh even the next day. A keeper for us!

This was really good. I had my doubts, the recipe sounded bland but it has a very appealing flavor. I had to use frozen corn instead of the baby cobs, and couldn't find firm tofu so I added a bit of leftover chicken breast (chopped tiny of course) for the meat-eaters. My two toddlers gobbled it up. Easily one of the best veggie-rich dishes I've made for them.

Quick and easy to make, I used 5 cups of chicken broth and used chick peas instead of the tofu. Also used about a cup of cooked orzo with the veggies in the recipe and Italian seasonings.

I'm sorry, folks, but I could never consider making this recipe, as I can't even LOOK at baby corn without thinking of Tom Hanks in "Big"!

I haven't made this recipie yet, but today while looking for "stew" recipies I came accorss this recipie online. I have this cookbook and I notice that Epicurious doesn't give the pasta amount. So, as a help to all cooks out there, directly from the cookbook: 1 cup cooked tiny pasta (about 4 ounces uncooked). She adds this note: Cook the pasta in advance, and store in airtight container in frig. Then you can make this dish on short notice when the need arises. Surprisingly her yield in the cookbook is 5 cups. Hmmmmm. Not too hungry people? Hope this helps. Happy eating.

My daughter Celia loved this soup. She loved all the vegetables and the alphabet noodles inside. She ate the whole bowl.

I thought it was delicious, but didn't do as well with the kids as I had hoped. None of my 3 cared for baby corn. Would make it again with minor substitutions.

This was a hit from my husband to my 12 year old, 3 year old and 9 month old! Especially serving it in the "teeny tiny" bowls with "teeny tiny" spoons and glasses. I added some basil as I cooked it and fresh grated paremsan at the end.

Haven't made it yet, although it sounds great for my budding chefs. A question to those who have: how much pasta? None is actually specified in the recipe, and I tend to either over or underdo when I guess. Thanks

I substituted chicken broth and some leftover smoked chicken for the vegetable broth and tofu. Both my toddlers and husband loved it!

Wonderful recipe, I loved it. Thank you so much for a kid friendly vegetarian recipe! Please add some more.

Delicious and simple to make. My kids loved it! I sprinkled some grated fontina cheese over the soup just before serving. The cheese melted nicely and really perked up the soup. The next time I prepare it, I plan to use chicken bouillon for a more flavorful broth.

Very nice, healthy soup. This recipe is so versatile that you can add or subtract a wide range of ingredients, depending upon what you have on hand. For example, I used chicken stock, omitted the baby corn and tofu... I added finely diced onion, and a good heaping teaspoon of mixed dried Italian herbs. I also used acorn squash rather than summer, and chose the tiny tube "ditali" pasta. Who knows what will end up in the soup next time? Enjoy!
