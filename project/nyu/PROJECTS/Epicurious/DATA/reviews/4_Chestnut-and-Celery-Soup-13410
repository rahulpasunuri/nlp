I thought this was very good. However, the chestnuts flavor did not come through. I added extra garlic and a little cayenne. I would make it again, if i need to use up the ingredients.

I have been making this perhaps since it was first printed. You can purchase chestnuts in the jar from Williams Sonoma or the Sonoma outlet after Thanksgiving at half price. You can also purchase them in a pouch at Ocean State Job Lot when they have them. The flavors never fail to surprise and please my guests. This is a perfect start to a holiday meal. I follow the recipe as written, except that I sometimes use homemade broth and less water.

A few years ago my husband had an amazing chestnut and celery root soup at Salts in Cambridge, MA. He asked me to re-create it but I couldn't find a recipe for chestnuts and celery root. This once came pretty close so I just traded out the celery and potato for celery root (aka celeriac). It makes for a rich, haunting flavor. I highly recommend that substitution. A splash of sherry at the end doesn't hurt either.

So Awesome! was a big hit as a first course before roast chicken.. it did need a bit of a kick so i added a bit of nutmeg, which was a bit hit.. Tried it with the sour cream, but it dominated a bit too much so had some left over creme and mixed it half and half with the sour creme.. and it was perfect... still a bit of sour, but much lighter flavorwise.

We roasted and chopped far too many fresh chestnuts for our Thanksgiving stuffing, so I tried this in order to use up the chestnuts. The soup was good, but the taste really wasn't sophisticated. It seemed more like home-style comfort food. I found the potato taste and texture to dominate the chestnut and celery. I might suggest using less potato or more of the other ingredients. Also, it was a little bland. I should have added a bit of crushed red pepper before pureeing.

I made this for a dinner party and all my guests raved. The soup is very easy to make and has fantastic flavors. I used my immersion blender and kept at it until the consistency was very smooth. At the end I added a splash of red wine, some cream, and some red pepper flakes to give it a little kick. I will make this again and again.

Very impressive soup, perfect for company. Elegant, nicely balanced flavors. I love chestnut soup, but this is lighter, less sweet, more complex and simply delicious. I used grapeseed oil instead of butter, fresh thyme instead of dried (ugh). Also added a healthy splash of Madeira (which seems to be made for chestnuts), heavy cream and maybe 1/4t of fennel pollen which added another subtle dimension to the flavor. The recipe doesn't mention seasoning with salt and pepper (I guess that's a given), but I used freshly ground white pepper which I thought worked nicely. Loved the suggestion from a cook in NYC to use as a sauce with fish and complementary roasted vegetables. I plan to steal your idea soon, and maybe dust the fish with fennel pollen as well.

Very easy and good, except for finding the chestnuts. Finally got them at Wild Oats, canned. I took previous advice and cooked a white fish to go with it. The soup was good, but the butter-pecan brussell sprouts and plum tart marzipan crumble (using pears and cranberries w/ ice cream)--both recipes from this site--were the shining stars. The whole meal ended up revolving around different nuts but it was fun and delicious.

I was disappointed. Given the prior reviews, I expected this to be exceptional, so I served it at a formal dinner. I followed the recipe to the letter and while the soup had a good flavor, it really tasted alot like bean soup. And it was heavy. It would be better used as a hearty, cold winter's day lunch, but who wants to shell out the cost of chestnuts for that?? Stick-to-your ribs--yes; but the only thing I found elegant was it's name.

A superb dish: fragrant, filling, gorgeous chestnut brown, and flavor to make one's eyes roll back into the head with every bite. I tossed a handful of fresh chopped fennel in with the celery just because I had it and was awfully glad I did. This makes a lot of soup, thank the heavens, as the leftovers led me to invent one of the culinary triumphs of my career: for a dinner party this weekend I spooned about a cup of the hot soup into each of four shallow bowls and topped it with inch-wide filets of baked cod, 3/4 inch chunks of roasted celery root, carrot, parsnip, and halved Brussels sprouts, and dusted it with chopped parsley and fennel fronds. Try it.

This is one elegant soup intriguing 'cause most can't define the chestnuts. Use just a splash of sherry and cream or half and half swirled at end- perfection get the dry pak chestnuts - time waster to do your own and not as good flavor

I bought a jar of chestnuts from Trader Joes and then imposed a Christmas deadline on myself so they weren't still in the pantry in June. Found this recipe, made it for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. It was fabulous---I also used smoked duck stock so it was extra great, but rich homemade chicken broth would certainly be almost as good. Definitely a keeper.

This was a lot of work -- for little return. Roasted fresh chestnuts -- a colossal time drain. The soup was a bit flat, though I used homemade stock. Souped it up with some heavy cream, sherry, and reduced chestnut broth (from blanching and peeling the chestnuts). In the final analysis, it was not worth the time. May be okay with less work -- using canned chestnuts -- but even so I doubt I would make it again.

This soup was outstanding. I used leftover chestnuts I boiled and peeled from Thanksgiving. Added celeriac - one cup- instead of two cups of celery. Also added touch of madiera and heavy cream at the end. Rave reviews and leftovers were fabulous. Try this one.

I made this at my sister's house last night and she didn't have any thyme (gasp!). As a result, I thought it came out a little bland, so I added 1/8 tsp. dried red pepper flakes and let it simmer for about 10 more minutes, then topped with minced chives. Everyone loved it, but of course I want to try it again using thyme. A great first course, especially for the fall season. Use Williams Sonoma's vacuum-packed chestnuts -- they're really good and absolutely effortless, worth the price of $12.50. It also helps to use organic or free-range chicken broth; it tastes better and has less sodium than Campbell's.

I've done this recipe so often I don't need to look at it, but today a friend asked for it and rather than type it out I was going to email this to her. I leave out the potato it is not nescessary and instead of sour cream I top it with frizzled mushrooms..crimini if available..if not what ever you can get! I wait till after Christmas and buy up all the chestnuts I can at wm. Sonoma 1/2 price sale! or bring them back from Europe ..vacuumm packed they last for ages!

After tasting this about - at the Thanksgiving table, I will upgrade it to 4 forks. Some of the guests were practically licking the bowl even though they had been stuffed with hors d'oeuvres, and I have to say that I did quite enjoy the left over soup for lunch. You really must try this soup for a nice winter's nignt treat. It was not complicated at all. No doubt, some will be impressed with the uniqueness of it, while some may be hesitant at trying it, but the cook will say it was worth a try.

Wow -- this is delicious! A very elegant "comfort food" -- rich, creamy and nutty (the sour cream is not necessary). The vacuum-packed chestnuts are expensive. An alternative, if you can find them, is dried chestnuts. Soak them first over night (like beans), boil for 20 minutes, then continue with recipe.

A good basic vegetable soup flavored with a classic - chestnuts. I used canned chestnuts, but they were very soft, so I'd suggest roasting whole chestnuts for a fun, rainy fall afternoon exercise. I suppose roasted chestnuts would need a longer cooking time; I'm not sure. You could throw in other left over vegetables as the week goes by, and not bother to puree the soup, and it would be fine.

This soup was awesome! The flavors blended together so well and the soup had a wonderful texture and color. My kids and guests wolfed it down. The leftover portions didn't last 24 hours. I'm surprised that this recipe has been around for 10 years and there are no other comments. This is the perfect Thanksgiving/Christmas dinner starter.
