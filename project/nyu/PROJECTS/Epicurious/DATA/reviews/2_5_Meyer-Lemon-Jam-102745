Hey cook from Las Vegas -- your meyer lemon vinaigrette? Care to share?

I love Meyer lemons. My Meyer lemon tree had a crop of over 400 lemons this past season and even though we've given away loads of them, and used them in recipes we're familiar with, we are still looking for more ways to use them. I thought this recipe would be tasty, but it was disappointing. No matter what I did, it did not thicken. The flavor was just O.K. We did use it on several dishes, but much, much prefer my own Meyer lemon vinegarette dressing instead. Very disappointing.

Another comment - I went back and added the peel, which improved the consistency. It seemed a little counter-intuitive to zest the peel and then add it anyway. The peel added a bitter note that required more sugar. I still don't think I've got this one right.

I too am confused by this recipe. I could blend this thing from now until eternity and it would never thicken. I added a little oregano as per the Babbo inspiration, but it remains a lovely tasting sauce/marinade, not a "jam" by any definition.

About how long do you let it blend in the blender before it thickens? Also, should I remove the skin from the lemon segments, or just toss the seedless lemon quarters in whole? Thank you!

I purchased my Meyer Lemons from a farmers market in Sarasota. When I mentioned to the seller that I intended to use the rind for it's zest and to make a jam for a salmon I was broiling, he laughed and wished me luck. He claimed the lemon skin of Meyer lemons was to thin to use in any recipe. How wrong he was. I can't recommend enough how delicious this jam topping is for your favorite fish recipe. He also spelled them "Myer", I assume this is because of the proximity to FT Myers, Florida.
