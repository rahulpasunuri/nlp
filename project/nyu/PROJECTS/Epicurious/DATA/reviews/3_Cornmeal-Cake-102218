A wonderful recipe, perfect for a cold winter's night. It's a mystery to me that something so utterly simple can be so completely soul- satisfying.

I upped the salt, and lowered the sugar, and used finely sliced red onion in place of the apple. It was very nice with grilled tomatoes.

This is delicious and light! My husband and I ate the whole thing by ourselves...and he wanted more! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Interesting and worth a try. I lined a square cake pan with buttered parchment which made removal quite easy. I will try this again for it's simplicity, taste and texture. It's a quick, nourishing meal and a nice leftover snack. Next time I will use 1 tbsp. of dark brown sugar and perhaps a pinch of cinnamon. It's also a good way to use up apples. Don't bother peeling the apples - ths skin is good for you.

As the article indicated it was more pancake-like than cake-like. I ended up adding a bit more flour and cornmeal. What I really liked about this recipe is its rustic simplicity and nourishing. I'm sure this is what the peasants of rural France ate for centuries. It was tough removing the pancake, even with the butter - I'll probably line the pan next time with parchment.

This recipe sounded so good. So, I made it EXACTLY as the recipe said. It was neither "crisp" or "wonderful". Very disappointed. I have made several oven type pancakes in the past and this was the worst! Sorry.

I thought this would be different somehow. I didn't really hate it. But I really didn't like it either.

Very good for breakfast.

Just made this tonight. It was different and delicious. Even my 13 year old son took seconds-and he usually isn't very adventurous. This will be a staple in our weekly menus. The salad recipe was fabulous too.

I have made this several times. It goes great with salad and pork. Quick easy and cheap to make.

This is a great dish to make in the fall/winter or when you want a simple but comforting meal. I double the recipe and my whole family--young children included--loves it. I'll sometimes make it as a snack or dessert for my youngest by using applesauce instead of apple slices; it offers a completely different taste and texture more suited to a preschooler.
