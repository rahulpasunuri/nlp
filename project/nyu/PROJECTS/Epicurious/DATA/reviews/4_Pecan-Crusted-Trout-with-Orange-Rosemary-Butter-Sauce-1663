I never really liked savoy cabbage that much, but the combination with bell peppers is great! And the assembly of the whole recipe is astonishing as well; we used almonds instead of pecans as the latter are hard to get in Europe. This will be our Good Friday recipe from now on.

I pan fried whole trout in butter which I had dusted in all purpose flour. (heads removed). I finished cooking them in the oven for 5 minutes. Because we're not big on pecans in Australia, and we wanted to cook them whole, I skipped the coating of pecans. I may try it with macadamias next time as per the pecan method. While they were cooking, I made the sauce and spooned that over them to serve. Absolutely delicious!

Light and perfect for freshly caught trout. In spite of what seems like a ton of butter, hang tough with the sauce. It is rich but you only need a smidgen to accent the cabbage and bring out the sweetness of the trout. Great simple recipe. Can use small whole trout, just pan fry at lower heat and turn frequently.

The reviewers are correct, there are way too many nuts. I used one cup for 24 ounces of fish and had about 1/3 cup nuts left over.

Spectacular recipe, look no longer! My husband and I absolutely loved this dish and will make it again and again! Made it with fresh trout he caught the day before. Delish!

This is the 2nd time I've made this. This time, I placed the fish in a bag with OJ for about 20 min prior to rolling in pecans. I used 1 stick of butter and everything tasted wonderful. I also added more carrots as the garnish was a hit the first time around!

Reduced the pecans, flour, and used less than 1 egg white. Made about 1/2 the sauce. Did not make the vegetables on the first try and left out the whipping cream. Served over rice noodles. Fish and sauce were excellent.

excellent recipe...i halved the sauce, and used less butter as described by other reviews (added until it tasted rich enough, about 2-3 tablespoons). definitely tasted restaurant quality. for the fish, i placed them skin side down on aluminum foil, sprinkled flour on top and spread it over the fish, then used the egg white as described, and sprinkled crushed pecans and a little panko on top. moved the aluminum foil with fish to the grill, and grilled until done. perfect, and enjoyed by the whole family!

This was delicious and fairly simple to make. Like others, I used less butter than the recipe called for, and only 2 egg whites. I skipped the vegetables and served it with rice and sauteed asparagus. My husband and I both loved it.

Great recipe - i would just say the recipe calls for too many pecans - not sure what to do with the leftovers now - and probably too much butter (and one too many eggs). i tasted as i added and stopped about half way through as it was more than rich enough. otherwise it's a great recipe thats looks and tastes first class! Served it with some vermicilli - something simple to soak up the great sauce...

My husband and I loved this - followed the recipe except I substituted salt- water trout filets for the rainbow trout. He asked me to be sure to fix it again.

I thought this was great - but I substituted almonds for the pecans and cut the sauce recipe in half.

My husband goes fishing all the time, brings back lots of trout (specks). Whenever he comes back, he expects me to have everything prepared to make this dish. His fellow fisherman were so impressed with it as well. I've made it at least 5-6 times, always getting raves. Found great way to cut reduction time on the sauce is to use 2-3T of OJ concentrate instead of reg. OJ.

This was a very good recipe. The sauce is very tasty, although a bit labor & time intensive to make Still worth the effort.

Absolutely delicious...didn't change a thing for the main recipe. Served over rice pilaf (complemented so well by the sauce) instead of the suggested veggies. For vegetables, we served the pea, asparagus & basil recipe from this site- a great accompaniment! Agree that the sauce took a bit longer to reduce, and made a lot, but looking forward to using up the leftovers!

Rating: 4
Delicious. I have made this with both trout and with chicken. I use no cream (because I never have it on hand) and 1/2 the called for butter. I avoid wasting ground pecans by combining with flour on a 2:1 ratio and dredge without the eggs, then saute in evoo. My husband and tween boys love it. I serve with rice and a green salad.

Rating: 4
This is indeed a fabulous recipe, worthy of your best dinner party! Yes, the sauce reduction takes time, and it makes more than you need, but guess what? It freezes beautifully, as does any unused pecans for the crust. Lots of butter, booze & cream..........what's not to like? I served it with sauteed carrots (thinly sliced) and sauteed spinach, for a colorful presentation. It was a big hit with everyone! Definitely a keeper.

For a client on a diet low in carbs and sans salt, I tried the pecan crust without the flour dredging, which worked perfectly employing just the egg whites and crushed pecans. For myself, who will eat anything that doesn't bite back, I found the sauce superfluous and ridiculously wasteful. I'll be eating what turned out essentially to be citrus flavored butter on everything, until it expires!

This is amazing. Served with a green salad and have made it several times since. Very important to let the sauce reduce-found it took a lot longer than recommended.

Trout was amazing and easy to make. I especially liked this over the crunchy vegetables. I found the sauce to be a bit thin. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be thicker.

This is possibly the best recipe I have found on Epicurious. The blending of flavors from the orange butter rosemary (use fresh!), the fish and the vegetables resulted in a superb dish, and so easy to make. I was able to remove the skin before staging with the sauce and veggies so I recommend you do that to get a more subtle flavor medley. Highly recommend it!Magnifique!

I started the meal with the field green, pear, blue cheese and walnut salad that is recommended as part of the menu. Loved it! As far as the trout, I wish the recipe specified what kind of trout to use. I used steelhead trout, which resembles salmon in color, texture and thickness. It took much longer than 2 minutes on each side to cook and I ended up slightly burning the pecan crust as a result of the additional time necessary to cook on the medium-high heat. Next time, I will cook on a lower setting. The sauce was unique and very delicious - nice color too. The cabbage, pepper and carrot mixture was a wonderful vegetable accompaniment, and made for a beautiful and colorful presentation. I also served wild rice as a side dish. Paired the entire meal with Korbel Le Premier - what a match! Very elegant. Would make for a lovely dinner party menu.

This was incredible! Definitely season the fish before cooking. I served it with sauteed spinach (with olive oil and garlic), poppyseed biscuits (recipe in the very first issue of Martha Stewart Everyday Food), the recommended salad, and a fine French white graves. Divine.

Delicious. I'm a novice cook, so I burned the sauce the first time (doesn't take as long to reduce when you halve the recipe, I discovered). Also, I cut my creme fraiche with skim milk for the whipping cream, something I probably shouldn't have done but again, I'm a novice, and it came out really well anyway. Even halving it there were too many pecans and I had to throw a lot of them away. But to the dish-- it really was great, the citrusy sauce was amazing and the pecan crust was wonderful. I will make this again, with more success I'm sure. If I can do it, anybody can. :-)

Fabulous! I used pecan-crusted halibut instead of trout, and doubled the sauce. Use fresh orange juice. The sauce was great drizzled over wild rice and asparagus, and would be wonderful on a variety of other dishes.

Trout turned out great. I used golden rainbow trout and didn't have any issues with the cooking time. Instead of the slaw, I served it with the Wild Rice and Toasted Pecans dish from this site and they complemented each other perfectly. I'll definitely make it again.

The vegetable garnish makes a beautiful presentation. The delicately-flavored, good-enough-for-company fish might benefit from the addition of a jalapeno or similar pepper in the sauce or on top to make it zippier. The sauce had just a hint of rosemary; I expected more. To make the rosemary more pronounced, one could make the sauce except for the whipping cream and butter and let the mixture sit for several hours before straining the sauce. I agree with another reviewer that the amount of flour is way too much for the dredging. I used 1/3 c. for half the recipe. I baked the trout at 350 for 12-14 minutes until the pecans browned. Served with a lettuce wedge and grape tomatoes smothered with bleu cheese dressing, spinach souffle, garlic bow-knot rolls, and parmesan fettucine to soak up the sauce, the fish was amply filling.

I found this sauce absolutely delicious as very quick and easy to prepare. We cook our fish on the grill only. The sauce was very good with the crispy trout. My family loved it & I have small children!

I have been looking for a sauce to make with macadamia nut-crusted tilapia ever since we got back from Maui. This sauce was fabulous! (I'm sure it is really good with the trout, too.)

Rating: 4
I've made this 2x now, both with good results. Don't broil the fish (it will burn before the trout cooks through); bake at 350 or 375, then broil for the last 2-3 minutes. Also, the recipe calls for way too many pecans and way too much sauce proportionate the number of fish fillets. Last time, I prepped plates garnished with a side of butternut squash puree drizzled with aged balsamic. Then poured sauce over fish and served.

The sauce was very buttery. Although delicious, between the sauce and the pecans, the fish was nearly overpowered. The combination was good, but next time I will probably serve with mashed potatoes. We were all still hungry afterward.

This was excellent and I will definitely serve it again. It was delicious and the presentation is beautiful, too. I used some colorful produce, red cabbage, purple onions, yellow squash, etc. which added to the appearance. This is a restaurant quality dish!

Very easy to make. I substitute Ono, Opah or Ahi for the trout. Trying the sauce tonight on chicken for one of my friends who doesn't eat fish :-)

This was an excellent complement to salmon steaks which I baked topped with thinly sliced oranges, (425* oven 10 min./inch ). I tripled the sauce recipe for 12 salmon steaks. Decreased the butter by half and adjusted the lemon juice to taste, adding it after the reduction process. Removed the salmon to a serving platter with sauce underneath the salmon and garnished with fresh rosemary sprigs. The next time I made an equally appealing sauce, but quite different in taste and color by using frozen OJ concentrate. A bottle of white wine was reduced with the shallots and herbs to 1/2 cup. The remaining ingreds. were then added for a fresher taste and brighter orange color. Both sauces were excellent!

Although this dish was very tasty, for some reason I felt like it took me forever to make! The trout had to cook much longer than expected..... next time I will definately broil it.

I thought this sauce was great and will use it again for other fish dishes. As I made this for a quick night dinner, I just salt and peppered the trout, brushed it with a little butter, and broiled it for 4 minutes while I heated up the sauce (which I had made 2 hours earlier).

Used this as one of the recipes in a cooking class on fish I did last night. The trout was delicious as was the sauce, although very rich. I served on a white platter and garnished with slices of fresh orange, lemon and chives - it looked beautiful. I did find the amount of pecans was way too much as was the sauce quanitity. I would probably cut both in half next time to avoid waste since the sauce will not reheat well.

Sauce was great. Cooking time for fish took quite a bit longer as well as the time for reducing the sauce. I will definitely make this again.

Marinaded the fish with salt and pepper before coating it with some homemade honey roasted pecan that I ground up. Skipped the egg white because the trout was already quite moist and I was too lazy to get out a THIRD dish. Also skipped the orange-rosemary sauce due to time contraints. The dish was so easy and quick to make and the sweetness of the honey pecans took away the little fishy taste that was in the trout. Both my husband and I thought this was better than a similar dish we get at one of our favorite restaurants, and it costs next to nothing compared to the $17 that we pay at the restaurant!

My husband, our two children, and I all loved this dish. My market had some beautiful looking trout, so I searched this site for a recipe. I'm so glad I chose this one! The sauce was silky and beautiful and a perfect complement to the fish and its nutty coating. I predict that I will make this sauce to go with salmon, and soon!

I usually stay away from recipes with fruit or fruit flavors involved. This one was fantastic, though! I used steelhead trout which gave it a salmony flavor without being too rich. The pecan crust stayed on the fish and was very tasty. After we had this, I went out and bout more trout! The only disappointment is that the sauce does not reheat well. Hell, it's almost all butter!

We all thought that this was an outstanding dish. The wonderful fragrance of the sauce while cooking, was an added bonus. I did not care for the cabbage side dish as a compliment to this recipe though on its own it is quite nice. Next time I won't bother with it as it is additional work and not worth the effort. This is definitely company fare!

I cannot emphasize how delicious this dish is. Definately a showpiece meal. I didn't bother with the carrots or red pepper-- the aroma and color of this dish provide enough festivity. However, the sauce is needed to fully appreciate the flavors. I was surprised because I always find sauces sort of ho-hum.

Rating: 3
Very tasty and easy to prepare. I coated both sides of whole, baby trout, which added to the flavor and crunchiness. Eliminated the red bell pepper and instead added julienned scallions. Will definitely make again, but with soft-shelled crabs. The sweetness of the crab should go well with the orange-rosemary butter sauce.

This dish is FABULOUS! My husband is an avid fly-fisherman and I have tried just about every trout recipe under the sun. This one takes the cake. IT has become our new "entertaining" dish. It is also simple enough for a monday night dinner for two. A MUST TRY!

Loved this recipe! Served it with the cabbage/red pepper/carrot saute that was shown with the fish in the original Bon Appetit article, plus simple white rice. Delicious! The rice was especially nice because it absorbed the sauce. The orange flavor in the sauce was subtle, by the way; I wondered if it would be too strong. This is definitely a "company dish" for us.
