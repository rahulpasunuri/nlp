2 forks always seems chintzy but it means "Good". It's not going to knock anyone's socks off, but i think that's clear from the ingredients. It's pretty much how I would cook eggplant intuitively except I wouldn't have thought to add the water, so having that guidance was helpful. I didn't put it on romaine, that doesn't really seem to go with it. I think it would be better just served hot.

This could be good but we just didn't care for it. Too many onions and not enough diversity in flavors. Maybe adding red pepper would help, or zucchini. Go easy on the parsley. Also, peel the eggplant as the skins get a little too much when eaten straight up like this.

It was easy and so good. I made it without the romain leaves and served it as a side dish. It could be paired up with just about anything.

Cooked eggplant well until it was soft and served warm on good quality buttered/toasted italian bread. Added capers and chopped green olives, extra squeeze of fresh lemon. It was awesome!!!

This is now my favorite eggplant recipe. I used small white eggplants from my local farmers' market. This salad is delicious and fast. Sometimes we enjoy it warm. I agree with the reviewer who suggests using the herbs. I use rosemary, basil, sage and parsley from my garden. One more thing - high heat is essential because you get this wonderful caramelized flavor at the end. When you transfer the eggplant to a bowl, make sure you scrape all of the delicious caramelized sauce from the pan. It's the best part!

Added more salt and pepper, per the previous reviewer. Also, with the water, added 1/2 tsp. "Herbes de Provence" (mix of thyme, basil, fennel, savory, rosemary, tarragon, & lavender). Probably any combination of similar herbs would do, and adding them gave a much more interesting result.

Recipe needs a little more seasoning. Salt & Pepper are a must...
