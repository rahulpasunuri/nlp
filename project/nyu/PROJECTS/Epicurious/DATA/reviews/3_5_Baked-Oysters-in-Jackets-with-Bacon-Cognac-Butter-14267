Don't know where I went wrong but these ended up soupy and bland. Not worth the effort, sadly.

SOOO good. A lot of work, but worth it.

I made this recipe for friends recently, and I plan on making it again tomorrow for my anniversary with some of my wonderful oysters from my mini farm. The only modification I made was the addition of some parmesan reggiano for the last three minutes in the oven.

These weren't bad but my husband and I both felt that we were gilding the lily. The bourbon overpowered the oysters, and the whole dish seemed a little too "arranged" for our tastes. I think we'll go back to raw oysters.

I purchased the fresh oysters pre-shucked from Whole Foods, my husband was kind enough to cook the bacon (real bacon) on the burner next to his grill to save the grease from my kitchen, I simply laid one or two wilted spinach leaves right on top of the oyster, no need to trouble with wrapping, and I drizzled a tiny splash of Cognac over the finished product! Folks are still calling for the recipe.

This was easy to make and perfect to start a party with. I had it prepared and put in the fridge; once guests started coming, I popped them in the oven. Viola! And everyone was impressed.

This is excellent! I didn't have any shallots so I substituted green onions and they worked fine.

Awsome! simply delicious. a bit rich but definitely something that i would make for cocktail parties. great presentation too. the second time around i did not blanch the spinach and it tasted a bit fresher.

I loved this recipe. The cognac butter was to die for and was so easy to make ahead. I also added a small sprinkle of grated parmesan cheese a few minutes before pulling them out of the oven and they were amazing! I drained some of the melted butter so they would be easier to handle. Excellent!

I made these as a starter for a recent dinner party. It got rave reviews. The best part was that so much could be made ahead, leaving you time to enjoy your guests. I served it with a Champagne for a winning combination.

Oysters abound here near the Chesapeake Bay; so a new recipe with panache is always welcome. I made the butter up the day before as well as wrapping up the oysters. Next night, top with butter and roast. What a treat!

I don't even LIKE oysters (my fiancee does...) but this dish blew us both away. The oysters are so tender and the bacon-cognac butter so flavorful (the leftovers are GREAT on toast the next morning) that this immediately became a favorite.

I am like Cheryl husband, not a big spinach fan, but I gave it a try. Cheryl next time wrap the oysters with spinach. The spinach taste was not overpowering, but added to the overall great taste of this dish.

My husband does not care for spinach -- so I left that step out; however, this dish has become one of our favorites and is often served at special occasions and holidays.
