Tarragon Tarragon Tarragon! I know dill and salmon are an obvious pairing, but tarragon adds such a fresh and clean flavor. Don't be shy with the tarragon!

Fast and Delicious! I made this for a business luncheon. Used light cream in lieu of the whipping cream and added fresh dill to the sauce, it tasted great and got raves from all my guests. I definitely will make this again.

I make this frequently, and love how simple it is to prepare, besides being delicious. I double the ingredients for the sauce, and add a handful of fresh dill, lemon zest, 1 tsp of lemon juice, and capers at the end. Gives it really tasty flavor.

My last minute self (and new mom with no time to cook) needed a simple but yummy recipe to cook for New Years so after reviewing many recipes I finally settled on this one and I couldn't be more pleased. This recipe was so simple, and the sauce was amazing for so few ingredients. Everybody at the table including myself loved it! I ended up increasing the ingredients to make more sauce but realizing it was so simple, this could easily be done last minute anyway as I felt the original quantity of sauce was not enough for the salmon I purchased. I used a high quality mustard (Maille) and a cheaper Sauvignon Blanc for the sauce. I read a previous reviewer's suggestion about adding fresh Thyme and agree that this would be a wonderful complement. I served fresh Pacific Wild Salmon on a bed of fresh organic herbed greens and Maiche which looked beautiful. Will make again for an elegant dinner when I need to impress.

So easy, so tasty, so impressive to dinner guests. This is definitely a keeper. i doubled the recipe for 1.5 lbs of salmon fillet instead of 12 oz. Next time i will make a bit more of the sauce, as it's a little bit scant for the amount of fish being served. Instead of 1/2 cup of whipping cream, I added 1/4 cup of it and 1/4 cup of fat free half+half. The mixture worked out well, the sauce tasted rich but not too rich.

"Delicious" could not get any easier than this. I fixed this last night for myself and had the leftovers for lunch today. Decided to make it for an elderly couple but had to go to the store for a green onion. Walked in the door at 2:00 p.m. with the onion. Walked out the door at 2:30 with the perfectly cooked, attractive salmon. My friends liked it as much as I did. This recipe is a winner. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Quick and easy. I'm sorry I have no more leftovers.

This was a big hit with my family and a nice change from our usual broiled salmon. Used lowfat half-and-half.

edible, but not tasty..blah, didn't rock our world.

I tripled the wine/onions/cream for 2 pounds of fillets. The trick to thickening the sauce is patience (not flour as some suggest); at just about 6 minutes the wine and cream suddenly thickened into a rich, creamy sauce, which was just enough to sauce 4-5 fillets lightly. I sprinkled a bit of dill into the sauce along with the mustard; I would probably add a more generous sprinkle of dill next time. The salmon was moist and flavorful; my family enjoyed it and rated it a "3" for delicious.

I did enjoy this but found it a bit bland. I added some dill and even more wine to the recipe as there didn't seem to be quite enough liquid for poaching - and I used a standard size pan. With a few adjustments it was tasty indeed.

I agree that this is a very subtle tasting salmon dish. However, the subtlety is correct so that the salmon reigns. I did greatly increase the wine, and added pepper and tarragon into the sauce and on top of the salmon, which made the salmon not look anemic. And, I poached it 13 minutes, as well. The dish was fabulous and the salmon looked very "gourmet."

What a complex flavor from a simple recipe. A quick dish for the weeknights.

Maybe not exceptional but definately very very good. I didn't want to rate it less than 4 stars because I might not have made it had it not had 4 stars. Would definately make it again. Simple and the flavors went well together. The poached salmon was so easy to make but so good and healthy.

First time for us. A true winner and I completely disagree with the reviewers that required more "flavor/taste" or other addatives. We downsized the mustard and increased the wine. A simple Pinot Gris worked fine adding a nice acid level. We did substitute fresh garden chives for the green onion and it was great. Try serving with asparagus with a lemon dressing and then a salad chaser of cucumber & arugula with a simple greek yogurt dressing & dill garnish. Very nice!

Simply the best salmon recipe I have tried. The best part is that is how quick and easy it is. Perfect for even the busiest night.

I use Epicurious a lot and this is the first time I have felt inspired to review a dish. This was excellent and my husband and I are picky eaters. I served this on top of mixed greens with some bread and butter on the side. Perfect, easy, elegant meal. The only thing I might try differently is to double the wine and mustard as we would have like some more sauce.

Excellent! I (surprisingly) was out of white wine, but had Lillet, so I used equal parts Lillet & water. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee. I LOVED it and so did my guests. Will make again for sure.

This has been my favorite way to prepare salmon for almost 10 years! My family has a fine dining restaurant and this presentation quite often appears on the menu. The plates ALWAYS come back licked clean. If you like, I recommend you try leeks in place of the green onion and ensure that you are using fresh dijon mustard. I wilt the leeks in a small amount of oil before adding the salmon filets. I also season the salmon filets with salt, pepper, garlic powder and fresh dill. Who wouldn't like this dish?!

I am not a salmon lover, but I love this. Very easy to make.

the poached salmon was delicious, but the mustard cream sauce was very dull. i was expecting some more kick, especially since i'd used dijon with horseradish, but the sauce was very mellow and rather blah. to be fair, my husband was rather more appreciative than myself (although still far from raving with joy). if i were to make the sauce again (which i won't), i'd taste it more rigorously before serving and much increase the amount of mustard. i didn't use the dill recommended by other reviewers, perhaps that would have helped.

i made this with fresh artic char served on a bed of greens and it was fabulous. made a little extra sauce and that was great with steamed buttercream fingerling potatos on the side.

This is good. I've made it several times now. Just made it with ff half & half. Added 1/2 tsp cornstarch to thicken and prevent breaking. Added some fresh dill that I had on hand. Will make again.

Thumbs up! Really easy to prepare. I added some fresh dill I had on hand and everyone liked it except my Mom, who skipped it and ate prime rib instead (Prime Rib with Merlot Sauce Recipe!!!).

So good! fyi: I didn't have whip cream. So used ff 1/2 & 1/2. Not to save on fat/calories but because that's what I had. As we all know, ff 1/2 & 1/2 doesn't thicken. So I did a 1 tsp of flour & 1 tsp of butter. MMMM! Will do this one again & again! Easy!!

Excellent recipe! Very easy, only a few ingredients, simple preparation, & quick to put together. My boyfriend was very impressed with the dish & suggested that I make it for company. I served the salmon with boiled baby, new potatoes flavored with fresh parsley & a small amount of butter. Also accompanied the salmon with steamed petit pois. I squeezed fresh lemon over the petit pois & added fresh pepper. The only changes I made to the recipe was that I used fresh thyme in the salmon sauce. Added the thyme at the very end. Didn't have any green onions on hand. Think that the fresh thyme was very French & provided more of a delicate touch to the sauce.

I've just started to teach myself how to cook and this is the second recipe I've ever tried. Couldn't have picked a better one. As a 29-year-old bachelor, I'm all for recipes like this one that are fast and easy to make. Aside from being easy, it tastes great and looks great. Plus, salmon is super healthy for you. I've made this recipe twice this week already!

Whats weird here is that the salmon is absolutely perfect, and the sauce is fantastic, but somehow I thought that the richness of the salmon made it hard to taste even this very rich sauce. I would definitely make both again (sauce and poached salmon) but separately. Both really wonderful though.

This was incredibly easy! The salmon came out just perfect, tender and moist, and was good enough to eat on its own without the sauce. Just make sure not to overcook it.

I used salmon fillets with skin on and placed them in the pan skin-side down. This is the best salmon I have ever tasted. I served it with "Roasted Asparagus with Lemon". It will be made again!
