The mousse turned out to be more than needed adn a little too sweet for my taste. This was definitely a rich, rich cake and nobody in my household really cared much for it. A small slice once in a great while is all i can really handle.

I only made the mousse. Normally i read the reviews before I try the recipe but unfortunately I didn't have time today. I felt the mousse was a bit too tart and too much cream cheese flavor. Next time if there is a next time I would cut the cream cheese to 12oz. 8oz of regular cream cheese and 4oz of mascarpone. The mousse was very light and airy when room temp. I was dissappointed with the result.

3.5 forks. I followed the recipe as written and everyone loved the taste and texture, but the crust was rather difficult to cut. I did it like a cheesecake, and pressed the crumbs only partially up the sides of the springform pan, and sadly, the mousse did not come away from the sides very well even after refrigerating for 8 hours. Next time, I'd place the pan on its side to ensure that I could press the crumbs all the way up and would only lightly press the crumbs on the bottom (The bottom crust was quite hard after baking). I served 10 people and had half the cake leftover-- it's deliciously rich!

EVERYONE - young and old alike rave about this recipe. I do not have any trouble with the crust, maybe because I cut down the butter to 4 Tablespoons, which is more than sufficient and only use 1/4 cup sugar. It's hard to find the 18 ounce jar of peanut butter, so I open a second jar and approximate another 3-4 ounces. I like a more peanut buttery taste and I increase the powdered sugar slightly as well. Really a fool proof recipe. Freezes well too!

Wish I could give 3.5 stars. This is very yummy, love the simplicity of ingredients. The peanut butter layer is very tangy--I wonder how it would turn out using marscapone cheese instead of cream cheese? In any case, the only drawback I see is lots of dishes to clean. I also was short on crust ingredients so I winged it with a sleeve of chocolate graham crackers, 2 little paper cups of peperidge farms chessman shortbread crackers, a stick of butter and cinnamon. It turned out really yummy and hard--but not impossible--to cut. Don't skip the cinnamon, it tastes great!

I just made the filling because I just wanted some mousse but it was really really good. I even used reduced fat Jif peanut butter and it was still amazing. I also sprinkled on top some crushed up graham crackers and sugar and cinnamon to give it a little something extra. I wouldve given it 4 our of 4 forks but I didn't make the entire cake so I just gave it three.

So delicious! Very rich and creamy. I made crust with chocolate graham cracker crumbs. The cinnamon in the crust gives it an interesting punch of flavor. And instead of espresso powder I used cocoa powder since I'm not a coffee lover. The topping is so easy to make and makes the cake look so pretty. I'll definitely make this again! Everyone loved it.

I doubled this recipe and made two of the 'cakes' for my husband's birthday. It was a huge hit! The topping is wonderful and the flavor of the crust was fantastic (but way too hard...any tips?). We had leftover peanut butter mousse which my kids used as celery and cracker topping for after school snacks. This recipe is a keeper!

I have made this many times over the last few years and it is always a hit. I always get compliments. I am a little ashamed to say (but none of you know me anyway) I always buy a pre- prepared chocolate crust and make the filling per the recipe. I leave the espresso powder out of the topping. Also the filling recipes makes 2 pies - so I buy 2 crusts and freeze one. NEVER FAILS TO PLEASE!

This was delicious and easy to make. I don't know why some reviewers questioned if this was a cake... it is just like a cheesecake. Crust was a bit hard to cut so I will try to adjust it a bit. I made this 3 days ahead and it was perfect. A keeper!!!

This is fablulous and so easy. I omitted cinnamon from the crust.

To die for; I have made this a gazillion times, and it always works. Not a "cake" at all, but a sort of fluffy peanut butter mousse pie (or a cake in the cheesecake sense). I always have more filling than will fit into my standard 10" springform, which I eat with a spoon! Definately needs to be served cold and kept fairly cold (this isn't a good recipe for a pot- luck) or the mousse filling will run. I often add Dr. Oetker's whipped cream stabilizer to the filling just out of habit (I add it to all whipped desserts), but it isn't necessary. Very rich. Can be hard to cut due to the fudgey topping (score the topping with a warm knife before plunging into the filling). Consequently it is hard to slice into small slivers, so just cut into manageable slices, and suggest that your guests split them with their significant others. If you have any peanut butter lovers in your life, make this for them and they will stalk you until you make it for them again.

I just made this cake for a dessert party. I made the following changes: for the crust, I used 7 oz choc. graham crackers, 6 T butter, 2 T sugar and I forgot the cinnamon; for the filling, used 1 1/2 cups 10X sugar, 1 T vanilla and 1 2/3 cup whipping cream; for the topping I used 1/3 cup whipping cream. I decorated the edges with shaved white chocolate. This cake was beautiful BUT, after being out for about 2 hours, it became a complete mess to cut and serve. The ganache topping stayed firm, but the mousse, while light and fluffy, just oozed out all over the place. It still tasted delicious, but next time, I would serve right from the fridge. Also, the crust was perfect - not too hard or too sweet.

This is the cake my fiance requests for his birthday every year. It incorporates all his favorite flavors - peanut butter, chocolate and coffee! We will even be using it as a filling for our wedding cake. I agree with other reviewers that the crust is hard as a rock as written. I reduce the butter in half and completly eliminate the sugar (who needs it? this cake is already extremly sweet and it lets the chocolate shine through). Very tasty and very easy recipe.

Rating: 3
I made this cake 2 days ago and I agree with other reviewers that the crust is not good. Mine came out hard as a rock. I will never make it again. The peanut butter mousse, however, was very good and I will probably use it as a filling for chocolate cake or with another crust.

Rating: 3
I could not imagine eating a whole cake of this mousse but I used it as a filling for a chocolate butter cake and it was divine. I frosted with a chocolate buttercream and covered the sides in chopped peanuts. It's my daughter's favorite candy combo and she loved it for her birthday cake. Rave reviews all around. To the cook who said it was heavy. I used a heavy duty high powered mixer and beat the whoop out of it. It came out light and fluffy and very creamy. Worked very well.

I really had high hopes for this dessert after reading many of the reviews, however was sorely disappointed. As someone who is known for her desserts and always gets rave reviews I did not even get a single comment (good or bad) about this dessert. Something tastes a bit off in the mousse to me and I thought maybe it would be better when all the parts were assembled - no luck. It tasted more like cream cheese than peanut butter. Also it is a good thing I took the advice of many of the others and halved the recipe for the mousse. Half is plenty to fill the crust. I like the concept of this dessert, but would need to come up with a different recipe for the peanut butter mousse.

Rating: 4
The cake came out a bit heavier than a mousse... The recipe was fairly easy to make and I made it for a birthday party. There was already a store-bought Ferrero Rocher cake but everyone absolutely loved mine... Even my best friend who doesn't enjoy peanut butter all that much thought it was "heavenly"... YUM!!!

Rating: 4
this is a great recipe! the only thing i changed was that i made an oreo cookie crust and it was fine. the ganache is so delicious! the coffee, chocolate, and peanut butter are so good together! i used a somewhat smallish pie pan so i had leftover filling, but it disappeared right away. this was so easy to make and the mousse was deliciously rich. i will definitely make this again, but i'll make only half of the mousse with peanut butter. i'll make the other half with nutella (i think the nutty chocolate taste is great with peanut butter) and swirl the two types of mousse together.

Rating: 4
I made this for a JIF lover's birthday, and it was absolutely decadent. I substituted the topping with Peanut Butter Ganache found in another recipe on this site. I would recommend adding a bit more cream or peanut butter to the chocolate ganache to make cutting easier. Also, I couldn't find chocolate wafers or graham crackers, but finely crushed chocolate Teddy Grahams (with half the butter and no additional sugar) for the crust was delicious!

Absolutely awesome! I made this for my son's 30th birthday and his comments were "addictive" and he's a health nut, but has a fondness for peanut butter & chocolate. It was soooo simple. I used chocolate grahm crackers for the crust and only one substitution...used one tablespoon of Creme Caramel International Coffee in the icing. The flavors from the crust to the icing blended beautifully and as my son stated, you look forward to the very last bite!

Recipes are funny. Sometimes a very simple recipe yields a wonderful dish, and an elaborate recipe turns out to be a waste of time. So, sometimes I rely on the reviews to help me choose between recipes. After making this cake I can't understand the rave reviews that were given to a so-so dessert. These people must be peanut butter freaks. Unless you really LOVE peanut butter, or your kids really LOVE peanut butter, or you just can't get enough of instant pudding/coolwhip type desserts, I wouldn't recommend this recipe. My biggest complaint is with the texture. It had a sort of "greasy" mouth feel.

Rating: 4
If I would have been able to rate this a 10, I would have done so. This is the best food I have ever eaten in my life. It is addictive. It makes a large volume. I divided it. Some goes into a pie tin and the rest goes into the springform. I use a chocolate graham cracker crust. I even made it with a store bought regular graham cracker crust and it was divine. Take my advice. Make it.

This was delicious! I bought a ready-made 9" Oreo cookie crust which tasted good. Also, cut the filling and topping in half! 1/2 of the filling barely fits in a 9" shell! I am not sure who originally designed the written proportions. This also keeps well and is good days afterwards.

Rating: 4
This is an excellect dessert! It gets so much better as it sits. I originally served it about 8 hours after making it. It was good and very rich. About half the pan was left over and I saved that for three days before serving it again and it was amazing! The flavors had blended and were more mellow than so rich. Very, very good. I will always make this at least one day ahead of time in the future. (I cut back on the espresso pwd and I think I will eliminate it completely next time - personal preference.)

I AM SO ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH THIS RECIPE! I AM A HUGE PEANUT BUTTER LOVER AND THIS SATISFIES MY CRAVING FOR IT PERFECTLY. IT IS SO CREAMY AND DELICIOUS AND I LOVE THE CRUST - I OVERCOOKED MY CRUST A TAD - NEXT TIME I WON'T LEAVE IT IN SO LONG.

If you love peanut better....this is the dessert for you! I have made this several times and it is great! My only piece of advice is make it at least a day before you serve it. My boyfriend & I both thought it was much better the second day. We ate on it for a week and it was still good 5 or 6 days later! Also, I didn't bother with making the crust. I just bought the chocolate ready-made pie crust and it worked fine. I bought two of them and I had enough filling to fill both crusts.

This cake/pie was SOOOO simple to make, and it came out wonderfully. I bought the ingredients to make this just in case I had time while I was making a turkey. Made this in about an hour while the bird was cooking, and it was ready for desert. Everyone loved it. Creamy, sweet, and simple to make!

I have been making this recipe ever since it first appeared in the mag. A huge hit with everyone who has tried it. The first thing I did the second time I made it was reduce the peanut butter by 1/2 cup. I have also found that, in a pinch, you can purchase a chocolate graham cracker pie crust and halve this recipe - it works perfectly. (Melbourne: I have never had a problem with the recipe crust - perhaps your butter was starting to cool?)

This recipe is awesome! Preparation fairly simple. The reason for 3 forks is the crust. Everytime I make this, the crust does not stay on the sides of the pan. Seems like an awful lot of butter. I may attempt to reduce butter next attempt. Does anyone have suggestions????

Excellent dessert. I have made it twice, both to rave reviews. Half of the filling is more then rich enough and don't penny pinch on the quality of chocolate to use. I used Giardella (sp?) bitter sweet the second tiome and it was fabulous. Make sure you let the chocolate cool before putting it on, otherwise it can reduce the volume of the mousse.

My husband and I both agreed that the cinnamon in the crust is a little much. There's enough flavor going on with the peanut butter, chocolate and espresso without adding the spice so I'll omit that next time. We also agreed that the filling and topping would taste really good as a square over a brownie base so maybe I'll try that next time.

Rating: 4
OOOO, REALLY, REALLY GOOD, but I found it made way too much filling. I've made this dessert twice. The first time, for Thanksgiving, I made it as directed and couldn't fit all the filling in the pan. Also, my guests found it so rich, that small slices went a long way; consequently, I ended up having to freeze most of it. The second time, I cut the filling portion by half and it went over really well. I found the ratio of filling to topping was better this way, also. I used instant coffee instead of espresso powder and it was very good. As the chocolate wafers are expensive, I think next time I will substitute oreos or chocolate grahams instead. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 0
Nobody else mentioned this problem, so I'm not sure what went wrong. I followed the recipe exactly and chilled the cake for 5-6 hours, but it did not set up and had to be spooned onto plates. It did taste great, but I agree with a little less cinnamon in the crust. I'll make it again and try chilling it overnight.

Have made this several times - one of the richest, most luscious treats you'll ever eat. Always a hit when I serve it. My only adjustments: because it is SO rich, I cut back a bit on the cream cheese and/or put in more whipped cream. It lightens it just a bit. Secondly I don't put a full tsp of cinammon in the crust. But it's superb just as it is. MUST be served after a lighter meal with huge icey cold glasses of milk, and makes a great midnite snack (and breakfast too!)

I made this and followed the directions exactly and it was WOW!!!

This is sooooooo good! The only substitution I made was to use chocolate graham crackers instead of chocolate wafers (couldn't find them at the store). Since there was sugar sprinkled on the graham crackers, I used a bit less than 1/4 cup of sugar in the crust so it wouldn't turn out too hard and that seemed to work. You could certainly make this in a glass pie pan. You would just need to cut down on the amount of filling depending on how deep your pan is.

Question: Is it necessary to use a springform pan? Or could I use a simple glass 10" pie pan?

Wow is right. Following what I thought were suggestions, I used 1/2 cup less peanut butter and 1/2 cup less powdered sugar. I used 1 Tbls. of pure vanilla extract and 1+ 2/3 cup of whipping cream in the filling. For the topping I used 4 oz of semi-sweet chocolate and 1/3 cup whipping cream. For the crust, I had chocolate graham crackers and used 7 oz. + 2 Tblsp. of sugar and 3/4 tsp. cinnamon and 6 Tblsp. of melted butter. I have a 9" springform pan and these reductions fit perfectly together. Yum!

A springform pan is a pan that has a flat circular base and removable sides. I made the cake as directed, only substituting instant coffee for the expresso powder (which I couldn't find), and it was fabulous - better than a peanut butter cup! Cut small slices, as it is very rich - feeds a crowd!

I rely on these recipe reviews when I decide which recipes to make. This really is a great dessert and, apparently one you cannot screw up easily. I goofed and purchased just four ounces of the bittersweet chocolate for the toppping, so I used two ounces of unsweetened chocolate, added some powdered sugar, even threw in some raspberry flavored instant cocoa mix I had in my cupboard. The the thick, fudgy flavor perfectly complemented the mousse filling. Everyone loved it.

WOW - Filling was absolutely delicious! I goofed and made the topping with 1 cup whipping cream so the "glaze" ran down the sides of cake when I removed the springform. I used chocolate graham crackers which were sprinkled with sugar, so with the addition of the 1/2 cup sugar, the crust turned out hard.Despite everything, it tasted terrific.Plan on preparing again, this time however, I'll make the adjustments with the crust and the topping. And, yes, it is a lot of cake. Can't wait to try it again.

PERFECTION! What more could you want -- tastes fabulous, looks wonderful and is very, very easy to make. I made this mega peanut butter cup for a Welcome Back Teacher Luncheon. The teachers and school staff absolutely loved it, moaning with each bite! As for the topping: I used 4-oz bittersweet and 2-oz semisweet chocolate, and a generous tablespoon of instant coffee instead of the espresso powder. I did not use a knife to spread the topping; I just poured/scooped all of it on the cake and gently tipped the pan from side to side. It was perfectly smooth. (My eight-year old, however, immediately detected the coffee in the chocolate topping; like some kids, she would have preferred just the chocolate.)

I made this for my husband's birthday and it was a huge hit, even though I left out a crucial ingredient. I whipped the cream first, put it in the fridge and completely forgot to fold it into the peanut butter mixture. The result was an amazingly rich cake - very much like a peanut butter cup. I plan to make it again, according the recipe, and see which way is better.

In answer to one cooks question as to why this desert is called a "cake". It is a "cake" as in cheesecake - not white cake or genoise! I have made it four times since first seeing the recipe! The last time, I froze the complete cake in the springform pan it was made in. A month later I needed the pan, unmolded the frozen cake and re-wrapped it in freezer paper. This is to let you know it froze and defrosted well. It is definitely more efficient to cut it when cold, using a hot knife(wipe the knife frequently to make clean cuts). It is delicious, if you like peanut butter. I like to decorate it with whipped cream and mini peanut butter cups

Very delicious!!! I got many compliments from guests. It made enough to serve company 2 nights in a row with left-overs besides. I couldn't find espresso powder at our local grocery store either, so I used 3/4 TBL. instant coffee instead, it worked out really well; It added a little bit of bitterness to the chocolate topping, but I love dark chocolate anyway. The cake was a bit tricky to cut though I thought, the topping was very firm and the filling very fluffy. Next time I think that I would drizzle the topping ( warmed up) over each serving. This is definately a KEEPER.

This pie was far better than a similar Reesie peanut butter pie that I bought last week at a Perkin's Pancake Restaurant.Next time I make this I will decrease the peanut butter by about 1/2 cup.This is a big pie.I cut the filling and chocolate sauce in half and to save time used an Oreo crust I purchased.I sprinkled the cinnamon on the crust then filled it.I liked the expresso powder in it a lot.I used half semisweet and half bittersweet chocolate for the topping,then topped it with whipped cream,toasted coconut,and toasted nuts.It was a show stopper and delicious.Everyone loved it.

Very good, but does make a very LARGE cake. I got the mousse effect and really enjoyed it. I made the chocolate sauce for the top, but did not put it on, as I did not like the taste and did not want to ruin the cake. I don't do well with chocolate sauces, so that could just have been me, or maybe I just don't like them - not sure, since I haven't really made one that I am crazy about yet. The cake was very light and creamy and the crust was delicious.

WOW! What a great dessert. I had regular graham crumbs on hand so I used those and I only made the crust for the bottom, not along the sides as suggested. The chocolate sauce was wonderful although I think it made too much; I couldn't fit it all on top so I just drizzled the rest on top of each piece. I didn't realize that it was going to make such a large pie (I made it for 2) so we ate it for a few days and I cut up the rest and froze. It still turned out great.
