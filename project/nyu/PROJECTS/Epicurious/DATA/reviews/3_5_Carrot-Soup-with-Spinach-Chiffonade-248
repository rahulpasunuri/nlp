My husband and I both loved this recipe and were thrilled a the vegetable intake! I did not have any ground ginger so put fresh ginger in at the beginning and omitted the ginger at the end. I think this was perfect as it had a nice ginger flavour without being overpowering. I also left out the lemon juice based on other reviewers and had no yogurt but thought it did not need it.

It isn't that good. I agree completely that something is missing and I can't tell what it is. I tested it with ground garlic at the end, at it was worse. Nutmeg helped a little and so did parsley. Dried basil did nothing. Perhaps its missing some fat, which could be added at the beginning. If I were to try this one again, I would sautee the onions in butter first before adding the broth and the other ingredients.

I made the soup without the chiffonade and served it with Ginger Cilantro Pesto. Delicious and very easy.

Left all the peels on. If we are going to puree why loose the lovely vitamins & nutrients? Used a yellow onion. Doubled the minced ginger. Substituted 1/2 cup cream into the soup instead of yogurt on top. Hated the lemon juice. Had liked it prior to the lemon but hated it after so I added 1 tsp sugar to try to back it out. But I still LOVE this recipe!

After reading the reviews, I made a few additions to combat blandness concerns: added a pinch of nutmeg, cayenne and 2 cloves of garlic with the carrots and potatoes. (kept everything else the same) I also swirled in a generous amount of light sour cream before serving. My carnivorous fiancee loved it, so I guess it was pretty good!!

This is an amazing soup. I've been making it for two years and it never ceases to impress me. The texture is amazing, the flavors are perfectly balanced, it looks super elegant, and it's a nutritional powerhouse. I use vegetable stock and regular yogurt (skim is too tangy); I very finely chop the ginger by hand and love the little bits; and I use less lemon juice and add some grated lemon peel at the same time. Great for company, too!

Not thrilled with this. The flavors don't seem very balanced, but I do agree the texture is quite nice. Not idea how to improve it (other than removing the ginger?) so will just choose to make another variation of carrot soup next time.

I don't think I'll ever make this soup again. I know I'm in the minority, but...overall, I thought it was bland with a weird bitter aftertaste (The onion? carrots? Not the ginger...there was no mistaking the ginger!). I gave it an extra fork for healthiness, though. On the plus side, this soup does have a lovely texture...and again, so low in fat! I would take another reviewer's advice and add the ginger early so as to puree it with the soup. In my opinion, the little pieces of minced ginger overpowered this subtle soup. The finished product, with the yogurt topping and spinach, was interesting, just not great.

I was tempted to add milk to this. It is a very elegant soup. The yogurt, I used sour cream, is a must. I put the raw spinach chiffonade on the top. It gave the soup a nice, fresh appearance and taste.

Different but enjoyable carrot soup. My guests loved the texture. The spinach and swirl of sour cream (I didn't have yogurt) make it a great presentation. Actually, without the spinach and topping this recipe wouldn't be a "Four Spooner."

This is an excellent recipe and the presentation is elegant. Everyone seemed to enjoy it.

Just lovely. A very beautiful and velvety soup that is so easy to make. A perfect appetizer for a sophisticated dinner party or when you just want to eat a bit healthier. I used only fresh ginger (didn't have the powder) and it worked fine. Also, sounds like a great foundation for adding in a few other winter root vegtables like parsnip. A keeper.

Definitely yum. The ginger was excellent in the soup. It was thick, satisfying, and the spinach topped it off. Very pretty, presentation-wise, as well, with the swirled yogurt. A wonderful soup, you can definitely fool people with it - it doesn't taste as easy as it is!

I made this soup because of the reviews and because it sounded different. I never expected to enjoy it as much as I did. My husband loved it. A keeper!!!

I used sweet potato instead of white potato, and it sweetened the soup - very good. Baby spinach worked great, cook for only one minute to wilt, to maintain flavor and texture of spinach. Easy, delicious recipe!

Keeper! Healthy and used veggies I always hv onhand. No ground ginger (blasphemy in Asian household), so I threw in the fresh ginger w/ all in the beginning thus it would be blended too. I wldn't wnt to come across bits of ginger while supping soup anyways -- too strong. Didn't know what yogurt was for until I saw what it did for color... very lovely & bright.

A lovely dish! Had 1/2 lb. of baby carrots I needed to use up, so halved the recipe. Came out great. Used the food processor to slice the carrots. Looks don't matter, since all gets pureed in the end (can someone tell me why you can't just pour the whole shebang in and process, instead of pureeing the cooked veggies first?) Had no plain yogurt, so used low fat sour cream. Also used baby spinach.

This recipe is delicious and very easy to make, although it does take a little bit of time since you need to puree the soup. I have made this twice, first for my own family then for company and everyone loved it. It can be made ahead, however I would still add the spinach at the last moment for the sake of presentation. The spinach lost a lot of its color if added to far ahead of serving. Still tasted delicious but the colors werent as vibrant. I also found I needed the spinach sliced small so less hung from your soup spoon. But I believe you could get the carrot portion made up ahead of time and set aside.
