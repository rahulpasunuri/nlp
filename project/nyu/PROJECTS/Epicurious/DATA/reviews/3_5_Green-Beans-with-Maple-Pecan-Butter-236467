use only one stick of butter and pecan pieces instead of halves. no need for the oil - just use the maple butter and sprinkle the toasted pecans on top at the end.

I made this as a side dish for my family with potatoes, and a turkey casserole. It's a great side dish and my family raved about it! the butter didn't melt quite like I thought and collected near the bottom, and solidified pretty quickly. The pecans gave an extra crunch, but I would recommend doubling the amount of pecans for this recipe. Highly recommended.

I usually love the four-fork recommendations but this one was awful. I made this for thanksgiving for a new twist on green beans. It was oily and heavy even though we only used 1/3 of the butter to toss and 1/2 the canola oil to saute. The dish reminded me of the overly-fried veggies on a bad Chinese buffet. On the positive side, the maple-pecan butter was delicious, we used it at breakfast for the next few days.

Delicious, easy and cooked as written.

Made this with haricot vert and, with the thinner beans, I think it would have been better with the pecan halves cut lengthwise so that there would be more of the nuts and smaller pieces. Also agree that half the butter is plenty.

Delicious recipe. I took the advice of the other reviewer and used half the butter, but kept the same amount of pecans and syrup. I made it in advance and refrigerated the beans in a bag and the butter mixture in a bowl. Just microwave the beans until warm, instead of the pan/oil method and then melt the butter in the microwave and pour it over the beans.

Loved this, it was really tasty and easy, but whoa, WAY too much butter. Halve the butter, trust me--it will still be MORE than enough (don't halve the nuts or syrup though)
