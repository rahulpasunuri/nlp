I have made this tart twice, once with the cranbery jam and once without. I agree with reviewers who said the jam overwhelmed the eggnog flavor (even though it was pretty). The second time I skipped the jam and made what turned out to be a delicious topping-I mixed non-fat Greek yogurt and eggnog with a little ground nutmeg, spread it over the top once the tart was done, and continued baking for a few minutes (just like with cheesecake, since that's essentially what this is). Turned out GREAT. I also substitute eggnog for creme fraiche, and I used gingersnap crust in a cookie sheet so it was like a sheet cheesecake. Super easy and people loved it.

I was looking for a really special Christmas dessert, and I'm glad I chose this one! The people I served it to RAVED about it and went back for seconds, then thirds. I felt a little badly that my boyfriend's pumpkin pie was largely ignored amidst the enthusiasm for the tart-but not too badly! I used a gingersnap crust, omitted one of the eggs and only put the cranberry jam on top. Yummy!

Review Readers, take note: Not ALL of the reviewers comments for this recipe should be taken to heart. The review that said MORE cookie crust dough is needed -- NOT SO! This is not a recipe for a deep- crust pizza. The review that said not to put cranberry jam between the crust and the eggnog filling -- WRONG! That's the whole point of this tart: a little sweetness with a little tartness. Plus, it's so much prettier with the two layers of red! My only suggestion is to substitute dark rum for the bourbon. Served this to a table of priests for their Christmas dinner and they loved it!

I just tested this recipe for Thanksgiving and it will not be featured at my table. As many reviewers have noted, the cranberry jam is over-powering and almost completely masks the egg nog flavors. The best part was the crust, which I modified, per another reviewer's suggestion, to include the zest of two oranges. My suggestion to those who want to try it would be to make an egg nog tart with the orange zest crust and serve the cranberry jam or a cranberry whipped cream on the side.

My son wanted an eggnog tart with a gingersnap crust for his Christmas birthday. After reading the comments about the bland crust, the gingersnaps made sense. I used 20 crushed gingersnaps, 3/4 c. flour, 1 stick of butter and kept the remaining crust ingredients the same. For the filling I used spiced rum, 3 whole eggs, and added 1/4 t. allspice. I did not make the cranberry layer because it wasn't what he wanted. Delicious dessert with lots of compliments and no leftovers!

This is a winner! Added extra bourbon and rum based on suggestion and glad I did. Incorporated only one layer of raspberry jam for balance and made a graham cracker crust because it sounded right. May drizzle the jam on top next time.

Really, really good and unusual. I thought the cranberry and egg nog flavors both stood out. Everyone else at dinner did, too. Followed recipe exactly except I used brandy because that is all I had. Definitely a keeper recipe. So pretty when presented on the table.

Made for Thanksgiving and it was a great hit. Looked just like the picture. I added the zest from the two oranges used for the filling to the cookie crust. Added flavor and color. Also used 4 tablespoons bourbon and 1 tablespoon dark rum (since this 4:1 ratio is used in our favorite eggnog.) I found the tart pan in a resturant supply store. Used rice to blind bake the crust and it turned out perfectly. No sags or cracks.

good dessert, not fantastic... cranberry was overwhelming, couldn't really taste the eggnog with the cranberry.

I thought that this dessert had a beautiful presentation (except for the fact that I totally messed up cutting it), and the eggnog filling was delicious. The eggnog and cranberry balanced each other nicely, and I thought that the cookie crust was just fine. Perhaps the other reviewers didn't cook it enough--I could see how that would result in a less flavorful crust. I added a tablespoon more bourbon as one of the other reviewers suggested, and I also added a lot more nutmeg. I could see how the filling may be a little lackluster otherwise. My main problem was that I, too, could not get my 'jelly' thick enough, so when I poured in the eggnog filling, it became a little swirly. It also didn't provide a nice, thick topping for the tart like it did in the picture. It still looked pretty, though. I couldn't find a 2 inch tart pan anywhere, so I used a 1 1/8" one. For a pan this size, the amount of crust was perfect, but I agree that if you are using the correct size pan, you'll probably need more. Despite using a smaller pan, I was still able to use all of the filling ingredients and had a perfect fit. Overall, I thought that considering the results, this recipe was relatively easy and worthwhile to make.

A wonderful balance between the sweetness of the eggnog filling and the cranberry jam. The pie was suberb and didn't last long! Will defn make it again

This was OK but the cranberry overwhelmed the filling. If I made this again I would double the filling amount to give it a better chance of being noticed. I also added a table spoon of H20 to the crust to make it tacky enough to adhere to the tart pan sides.

I made this for my family's Thanksgiving dessert, and it came out superb! My cranberry jam didn't solidify, so I left the tart plain and served the "jam" as a sauce on the side; no problem. A great end to the meal, and it came out well even for a cheesecake first-timer like me!

This is just okay. I mistakingly added one extra tbls. of bourbon but otherwise made the recipe as written. The cranberry jam was great, but the eggnog filling was overpowering (partially my fault for adding slightly more alcohol). On the other hand, it looked great and I would try the same concept with some adjustments to the flavors.

I would like to give this 3.5 forks...it only loses half a fork because the crust is mediocre at best. However the eggnog filling is truly spectacular! That said, I did modify the recipe to make it more eggnog-like: tripled the liquor (dark rum) and added lots of nutmeg until it smelled strong...also added nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, and a little Triple Sec to the cranberry jam. Really wonderful combination. Only the crust is lacking! Would definitely make the fillings again.

A little time consuming, but well worth it! This was one of (and the best of) our New Year's Eve desserts - a crowd pleaser and a perfect (and uncommon) combination of flavors and textures.

I didn't have a two inch deep quiche pan so made two crusts and divided the filling and jam between them. It worked well. I used rum instead of bourbon. Tasted very eggnog like. Great combination of flavours.

This was our Christmas dessert, and it looked exactly like the photo! It was really wonderful. I used dark rum and a splash of Grand Marnier in the filling in place of the bourbon, and increased the nutmeg just slightly. I also didn't find the need to add water to the jam, just used it straight. My only complaint is the crust. It's easy to make and work with, and did hold up beautifully, but it's lacking in flavor. I agree with those who made the comments about changing the crust, but I don't think graham cracker is the way to go. I'll try adding some lemon zest next time, for a bit more flavor, and maybe increase the sugar slightly, as it tasted bland to me. Definitely a repeat, though! The combination of the tart cranberry and the creamy eggnog is wonderful.

Fabulous!! Wonderful marriage of flavors. Made this for Thanksgiving, and it got rave reviews! The cranberry jam was nicely tart when tasted by itself, but combined with the sweetness of the cheesecake layer, it worked quite well. The only changes I made to this recipes were: I baked it in a springform pan, since I don't own a bottomless tart pan. I pressed the dough a full 2+ inches up the sides, and filled it with rice to the top of the dough to blind-bake it. I substituted a full 1/2 tsp of mace for the nutmeg, and I used Crown Royal whiskey instead of bourbon. And I didn't use a food processor for any of it (made the crust by hand, and used a hand mixer for the cheesecake). I did have to bake the cheesecake layer an extra 20 minutes, because it was still very loose after the stated time. After a full hour of baking, it still jiggled considerably, but the center was solid to my touch. It was still very soft when we cut into it, oozing a little bit onto the plate. It came out beautifully, the crust is substantial enough to support the tart, even when sliding it off the bottom of the pan. The beautiful red color of the jelly layer on top really makes for beautiful presentation. I added rosettes of whipped cream around the edge to finish it off, and served it as is. Everybody loved it. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this for dessert on Thanksgiving and it was perfect, plus it looked so elegant. This has become a new tradition for my family.

I made this as well as the Caramel Apple Pastis for dessert. This was the clear winner at the table. The cranberry jelly was very easy to make and the cranberries alone should have had plenty of pectin to jell the jam. I wonder if frozen berries vs. fresh made a difference. I do agree that the tart shell needs a bit more in order to reach up properly in the fluted pan. I spread it as thin as I was willing without compromising leaks and it shrunk down a bit when baking. Still it didn't really affect the overall dish. The filling was very light and this will be a repeat dessert at this house.

We loved this! It was absolutely gorgeous, before serving, as a whole tart, and after, as slices. The candied orange and cranberry compote that accompanied the recipe in the mag is a beautiful, and delicious, addition, but not necessary to the success of the dessert. Some tips for a successful tart shell (and I learned these after my first shell was less than perfect!): make sure the dough is pressed all the way to the top of the quiche pan (it puffs a bit in the oven, so don't worry if it seems thin); and fill the pan, after putting in dough and foil, to near the top to hold the dough against the sides of the pan while it bakes. I used rice, and it worked very well. If you do these things the crust will be successful, and the rest of the recipe is very simple. This is very much worth the effort it takes to make!

Well, I got the second batch second jelly to congeal, and the tart was a real success; I loved the tartness of the cranberry with the richness of the cheesecake. Had another problem getting it out of the pan, which was the size and type called for, although not non-stick. Next time I would spray it with Pam or use a springform pan. Jury still out on whether or not this will be our Christmas dinner dessert.

I'm making this for my book club tomorrow evening, and was planning on making it again for my family for Christmas. However, there are some problems already: my cranberry jam did not "jell" (even after all night in the frig), and I followed the recipe exactly. I'm considering making it over, using less water, --or adding some cornstarch and recooking it. Additionally, I can see that I will have some leakage, since my crust broke apart in a few places; agree with those who say it needs more dough for the pan. And finally, it didn't take as long to bake the crust as called for, and generally things take longer in my oven. Bottom line is that I imagine that it will taste good but maybe not look like a tart attractive enough for a festive occasion, what with all these problems.

I made this recipe exactly as it is. I was very excited about it, it sounded heavenly. I brought it to thanksgiving dinner, giving everyone the name for it. everyone kept calling it a cheesecake. Well, to be honest it did not live up to its name. "Oh, eggnog, really, I'll I taste is cranberry." I thought, and every piece I ate I felt the same way. I loved the jam but would add less of it and would also find a way to kick up the "eggnog" flavor. I thought the review stating that the carton version was about the same and scoffed. But the reviewer was actually close to speaking the truth, (but I would never substitute with the box, which I don't think the reviewer was suggesting.)

Very nice, but didn't think the cookie dough crust worked with this recipe- neither did the other 12 people at the table. Cheesecake had nice flavor, would make again but would use graham cracker crust.

I thought this was exquisite. I agree with the cook from Brooklyn that increasing the dough by half will ensure better coverage, as I had some leakage. I used a non-stick 10 x 2, so I needed to check the crust for browning before the allotted time. If the cook from Lake Sherwood thinks that using pre-made pie crust, Jello cheesecake mix and jelly would give her the same result, I suggest she not bother baking from scratch if she can't tell the difference.

I made this tonight for the dinner tomorrow. The tart pan I used was a 9 inch, so I baked the filling that wouldn't fit in a separate casserole. My husband and I just tasted it hot out of the oven and the custard is yummy. The nutmeg and bourbon flavors are really nice and the texture is creamy. Can't wait to taste the whole tart tomorrow.

This pie was good. Not too heavy and the eggnog part had a nice creamy texture. The next time I make it I'll skip putting the cranberry jam on the bottom. Although the jam was good and balanced the sweetness of the eggnog, two layers was a tad too overpowering.

I made this for my office as a dry run for Thanksgiving and five days later, there is still some left. Not nearly worth the effort. I could have used a premade crust, a box of Jello no-bake cheesecake, and some jelly and achieved approximately the same result.

Very good. Like a very soft cheesecake. Impressive, festive presentation. I made half again as much of the crust to ensure good coverage and no leakage.
