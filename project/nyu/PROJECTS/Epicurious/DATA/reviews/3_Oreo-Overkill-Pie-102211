I made several changes to this recipe: omitted bananas, used all crumbs in crust, and used hot fudge as the frosting. That is, I poured hot fudge (homemade...mmmm) over the top after freezing and then covered and refroze. The result was so delicious, my sister in law asked me if I knew of any religions formed over this dessert;)

It's soooo easy to prepare. I just loved the flavor the bannanas gave to the pie. I think it's a very good combination. I gave it in a reunion and everyone loved it.

The bananas ruined it. I tried it a second time without the bananas, and it was yummy. So LEAVE OUT THE BANANAS

I enjoyed this pie. I am an Oreo-a-holic, and thought that I could go one step further and make it even better. The second time I made it, I made my own home made cookies and cream ice cream, crushing up Oreos in the blender. If short on time, you can purchase Vanilla ice cream, let it soften a little bit, then mix in crushed Oreos!

Made a few changes to this sinful yet scrumous dessert. Omitted the banana, used Low fat Cookies and cream ice cream, in the middle in addition to the milk chocolate syrup, i used dulce de leche spread and crushed a bag of M&Ms. Also used the M&Ms on the top along with cookie crumbs! AWESOME!!! An entire family pleaser!!!

This was a delicious meal.I saw the review about the bananas so I did not put them in the first one, and it tasted so good and rich. On the second one i added the bananas and it tasted even better! This is a great dessert for anything.

I was very disappointed with this recipe, but some of the people I served it to said they liked it. To me, the bananas seemed out of place.
