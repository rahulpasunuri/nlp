Stilton is very difficult to find here so I used a Turkish cheese called tulum. Being a bit new to using celery root (instead of the stalk as we usually do in the US) I was very pleased with this recipe. Very tasty and it doubled and halved nicely. My husband loved it. Will make again often.

Stilton? Incomprehensible. Substitute Goat Feta and you'll find an utterly charming meld of flavors that augments the celeriac, instead of burying it as the stilton would. Lovely compliment for portabella duxelles stuffed breast of veal.

I was disappointed. The stilton cheese definitely overpowered the celery root. If I made it again I would just do it with potatoes. I was looking for a dish that complimented celery root flavor and this one let me down.

I used a mandolin to cut the potato and celery root (especially because the celeriac is SO hard cutting with a knife is dangerous!). Worth every calorie and effort; the hardest part is arranging the stuff in your casserole dish! (And that isn't anything!) Try it, you will love it! P.S. All cheeses vary in saltiness; be wary of that and don't overseason!

I could not find Stilton cheese so I used Gorgonzola and a little Parmesan instead and it was a little salty.

So many different flavors that complimented each other beautifully. There is no way this dish wouldn't taste good. I would make it again and again. A dish to be proud of and the effort put in is definitely worth it.
