Hard boiled eggs would only dry out the tartar sauce, so you would have add more mayo.

I used Hellman's Light Mayonnaise which worked very well. The Tartar Sauce is delicious just as it is written, but I will try the capers the next time I make it.

If you're interested in my interpretation, I doctored this a bit. I added very finely chopped green onion in place of the shallot, a tablespoon of lemon juice, the cornichons, capers instead of olives, a touch of olive oil, salt and pepper, tobasco, and probably 3 tablespoons of finely chopped fresh tarragon. Perfect. Next time thought, I might add a chopped hard-boiled egg to give it even more texture.
