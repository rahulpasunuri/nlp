Reminded me of a soup I had years ago at a quaint little deli and could never quite duplicate. This one is almost spot on. A light cream soup that was not too heavy feeling on the stomach. I added 1/2 tsp. ground ginger at the end after tasting it to give it a little more "umph" like the deli soup, curry would be good too. Might try to puree the bacon in next time for fuller flavor as suggested. Husband was concerned about bacon grease for health reasons, olive oil as suggested by other reviewers may foot the bill. Really liked the pureed rice texture and thought it tasted even better the next day as most soups always do! Instead of using a blender I used a hand held stick blender right in the pot making it a very quick soup to put together. If I could, I would give it a THREE AND A HALF FORK rating! A "dish beyond compare" for four forks is an awfully high standard...but this came darn close with adjustments.

This is my favorite soup ever! In college, I was lucky enough to be friends with one of Fanny Carroll's daughters. On our birthday (we share the same day), Fanny would cook us a special meal. I always reqested her carrot-rice soup. On more than one occasion, I was sat down with my own place setting and served this wonderful soup. It is truly a "comfort food, " absolutely delicious! Today, I am going to make it with my own daughters for the first time. Fanny may not be my own mom, but I am happy to be passing her family recipe down to my own children. p.s. I'm pretty sure Fanny didn't use bacon when she made it for me, so I prefer to omit that ingredient.

I followed the recipe with a minor change or two and it was delicious. I didn't have bacon, so I did what another reviewer did and omitted it, just sauteed the onion in some olive oil. Also, I used half chicken bouillon and half beef bouillon and it was a fine substitution for the stock. My children - 6 months to 10 devoured it!

Followed recipe exactly and was glad I did! I think the puréed version is nice, and I don't think it'd be the same with the whole grains of rice (although it would be good). Nice, full flavor with the onions and bacon. I wouldn't want this every week, but it's a lovely cream soup as a first course!

Delicious. Took other's suggestions and added the rice after pureeing the soup.

I LOVE this soup! I omitted the bacon, and sauted the onion in butter. I cooked the rice separately, and added it after pureeing the soup - I wanted to have a little additional texture. My roommate, who does not like cooked carrots and was hesitant to try the soup, went back for seconds. This soup has definitely worked it's way into my Repeat Recipes!

Very nice, a quick and easy recipe the whole family loves. We make it often.

This is similar to an old favorite carrot soup recipe I have. This is good with the rice and cream. I don't think I would bother with the bacon since I don't care for it anyway. What I don't understand is why put the rice in when it will get pureed with the carrots and onions?? I made the rice separately and added at the end because I don't want pureed rice.

Skipped the whipping cream and served the bacon bits separately. A nice soup and a great way to use up cooked rice (I added it at the end). The addition of a few extra spices was key - cumin, garlic and lots of ginger.

This was very good. I added a tiny pinch of cumin and ground ginger based on past reviews but am not sure if there would have been a difference if I had omitted them. I also left out the sugar and used speck (German bacon). Left half the bacon in the soup and cooked/pureed it with the carrots.

The bacon adds such a wonderful flavor. Kids and all enjoyed it to the very last drop. Wouldn't change a thing to the recipe.

After reading the reviews I was looking forward to making this soup. I followed the directions exactly and ended up with a pot full of bland soup. Even with the bacon added as garnish it was simply boring. For the cook who wants a soup with flavor, I would not waste my time on this recipe.

Scrumptious. However, I did add some cumin, chopped ginger and cayene pepper for extra zip. I also applied a splash of Chardonnay. I used a combination of chicken and vegetable broths, (name brand is "Imagine")these organic broths are of superb quality. Instead of bacon I incorporated the use of Pancetta. Pancetta is an Italian version of bacon. After browning the pancetta I also added it back to the simmering ingrediants to be included in the final puree. I made this yesterday for my sister and her family. They loved it. This one is a keeper.

My husband and I are in a gourmet group and I made this soup based on the ratings. I followed the recipe but did change bacon as suggested. I browned the bacon, removed and drained it and then put in back in the pot. I made some extra bacon for the garnish. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!

This soup is really easy to make and it is very good though I must agree with Scotch Plains, NJ that it is a little bland. Next time I will take his/her advice and add some chile pepper, cumin and ginger and probably a clove of crushed garlic.

This was absolutely wonderful. Followed the advice of a previous cook and left the bacon in the pot and blended at the end. Scrumptious!

The first time I made this soup I thought it was a bit bland, so the next time I added 1/4 tsp ground chipolte chile pepper, 1 TBS chopped fresh ginger, and 1/2 tsp cumin while the carrots were simmering and the result was amazing! My husband said it ranked with the best soup he's gotten in any restaurant, and he's a tough critic! It's a keeper.

This is a keeper. I make a lot of recipes in Bon Appetit and I have to say this is one of my all-time favorites. It's very easy and very yummy. I also wouldn't change a thing about the recipe.

I know the words "this is the best..." are too freely used, but I mean it in this case. This is the best smooth cream style soup I have ever had. My wife agrees.
