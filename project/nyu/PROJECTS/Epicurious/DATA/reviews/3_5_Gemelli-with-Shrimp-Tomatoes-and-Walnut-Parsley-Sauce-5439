I was skeptical as I was making this (I was worried the sauce would be too bitter) but this turned out very well. Lemon juice or not, the "pesto" will turn brown unless you serve it immediately. I used pecans instead of walnuts, because I always have those on hand. I made it early in the day and served it at room temp, which was very good. I've also been having it as cold leftovers. You can't really call this pesto, but whatever. I like the lemon in it - very bright. My kids (4 and 6) would not eat it, but that's not a surprise.

Much better the next day and eaten COLD!

I had higher hopes for this. I thought the pesto was bland. I added quite a bit of Diamond Crystal Kosher salt, and found it still lacking in depth. I couldn't taste the lemon zest or juice in this at all. I think a standard pesto with the sharpness of Reggiano and basil would be better. I also didn't know if this was a cold dish. From the reviews you could serve it either way. I served it hot, cooking the tomatoes a bit with the shrimp. I made this in a 6 qt. Viking saute pan, so the pasta went in from its pot directly over the shrimp and tomatoes, and then I added the pesto and folded it all together. I guess I was just looking for more of a burst of flavor. It was good, just not knock out like I had expected.

My family loves this and request it often. Serve with bread, wine and salad. Super!

Good dish, a little too much garlic(and we love garlic). I added about 1/2 cup of pasta water instead of the tomatoes. Sprinkled some Parmesan cheese a top.

Have made this recipe several times and it has always been a hit. Great spring/summer dish and healthy. Very fresh taste. I've spiced it up by adding some summer squash, zucchini and asparagus. You can add whatever you like.

We felt the parsley was too overwhelming for such a simple dish. While it was easy, I wouldn't make it again. It did not have a nice flavor.

I bring this to summer picnics. Colorful, delicious, and quite unusal, so it also has become a conversation starter. I saute the minced garlic (with the shrimp and lemon juice) for a milder garlic taste, and have also toasted the walnuts.

We've been making this recipe since '98 as well. When shrimp aren't available, we use grilled chicken breasts. A great summer salad!

I've been making this recipe since the June '98 magazine arrived in my mailbox. Excellent and relatively quick. Also, it can be make with ingregients I often have on hand in either my frig, pantry, or freezer. I've never had problems with the pesto darkening; I'd suggest more lemon juice than what's called for. Additional lemon juice also brightens up the flavor. Also, I cut the shrimp in to quarters (first lengthwise, then in half). This more evenly distributes the shrimp among the pasta and tomatos. Because the shrimp is so small and will easily overcook, I sear the pieces over very high heat. Recently, I've begun to add a small pinch of crushed red pepper flakes to the olive oil before I throw in the shrimp. Gives the shrimp a bit of an extra kick.

Absolutely delicious! Very colorful and appealing-looking dish. WOnderful for a summer lunch. I'd even consider adding some small pieces of Mozerella to it.

I have only made this recipe once when it first appeared in Bon Appetit (too many recipes; so little time), and I thought it was very good. I would definitely make it again. The parsley walnut sauce is simply a variation of a basil and pine nut pesto, but not nearly as strong in flavor. I love basil pesto, but I also love parsley and found this to be a nice alternative to the traditional pesto pasta salad.

Marvellous combination of ingredients. I'll make this again and again. However, I cut the walnuts down to one-third of a cup blended with parsley, and I didn't top the pasta with any - too many nuts are too overwhelming. And I let the cherry tomatoes heat with the shrimp and lemon juice briefly - don't think they should be cold.

This is a great simple recipe! I would only recommend that your pasta is mostly cooked by the time you cook the shrimp. I started the pasta too late and had to turn the shrimp off while the pasta was still cooking. The parsley pesto browned quickly. Any solutions to fix this out there? I tried a little lemon juice and maybe I didn't use enough.

I found the parsley flavor too overwhelming--I'd use half as much, or substitute fresh herbs (like basil).

A great party dish! After overnight storage in the refrigerator, however, the leftovers turned a very unappealing brown color--must be the pesto. Even with the color change, this is one of the best dishes I have ever made from B.A., and I would definately make it again. Use the largest shrimp that you can find, and don't overcook them or they will be rubbery.

Absolutely yummy and sooo easy! Could easily make the sauce ahead of time, keep it well covered. Everybody at my dinner party raved about it. If you don't have a shrimp peeler/ deveiner, I highly recommend spending the $.79 at your grocery store, it really makes peeling fast.

The whole family loved this recipe. I used four plum tomatoes chopped and warmed in the shrimp saute - very creamy. Great recipe! I'll definitely make this again and again

This recipe was very garlicky. Laying low on the garlic is a primo suggestion.

GREAT RECIPE. THE PREPARATION OF THE SAUCE, THE CLEANED SHRIMP AND SLICING OF THE TOMATOES (I USED SMALL GRAPE TOMATOES) CAN ALL BE DONE AHEAD OF TIME. THEN WHEN YOU ARE READY-WHILE THE MACARONI COOKS THE SHRIMP CAN BE QUICKLY COOKED AND THE REST OF THE ASSEMBLED INGREDIENTS ADDED TO THE DRAINED MACARONI FOR A EASILY PREPARED DISH. GENEROUS PORTION CAN EASILY FEED 6 WITH A SECOND COURSE OR 4 LARGE PORTIONS AS AN ENTREE.DEFINETLY A DIFFERENT TASTE THAN THE USUAL BASIL AND PINE NUT PESTO.GOOD IF YOU PREFER A LESS STRONG FLAVOR. A RECIPE WORTH REPEATING.

I can't recommend a better summer party dish...it's a hit with all. I've made this several times and my two observations are that the pesto making process takes nurturing to achieve full, seasoned flavor (salt!), and that once the dish is served, keep remaining amount covered...air seems to discolor the green vivid pesto. It's simply awesome and delicious!

I'VE MADE THIS RECIPE SEVERAL TIMES AND IT'S A DEFINATE KEEPER, BUT NEXT TIME I THINK I'LL LAY LOW ON THE GARLIC. YOWZA!!!!! ALSO TASTES GOOD COLD THE NEXT DAY.

When I had made the pesto sauce I thought I had made a drastic mistake - grass clippings! But I soldiered on and found the combination of pasta, sauce, shrimp and tomatoes was terrific. The colors make this a lovely dish, too. I have to say, I made this in the quantity written, and four of us struggled to eat half! I paired this with the Endive, Arugula and Orange salad and found the combination a good one. I'll make this again. Maybe half a recipe.

This is a really good, easy pasta dish. I loved the walnut parsley sauce and the cherry tomatoes gave it a nice color and good flavor. This is a perfect main course (generous portions serve 4) with a nice salad on the side.

A wonderful warm weather dish that's a favorite with my family. The generous amount of parsley makes the sauce fresh and lively. Don't try to save time by buying peeled, precooked shrimp. You need to cook raw shrimp with the lemon - it makes a big difference.
