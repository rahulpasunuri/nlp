Hubby liked this quick to assemble sandwich. I omitted mayo and forgot the onion. I used focaccia wedges split into three layers in which to stuff the meat, cheese and tomato. I used Swiss instead of Provolone. Next time I intend to reverse the proportions of vinegar and oil, as I think the more vinegar is needed to balance the taste.

Hey, Oh. Mayo? Nah. Without Amorosos these people got no chance anyway.

The Philly Cheese steak sub shop on Telegraph in Berkley is better that any in Philly. Bar none. This si good but needs more melted cheese in the meat

Oh, but you must go to Philadelphia and see...it's where sandwiches are created by celestial beings....it's where good sandwiches go when they....really, the Platonic form of the great sandwich resides in the soul of the City of Brotherly Love.

People from Philly: did I miss something? Did you guys patent the name "hoagie"? Pu-leez! It's another name for a sandwich in a long roll. Get over yourselves.

To the other cooks from Philly, they certainly could have done worse. They got some of the meats right, shredded the lettuce, and added the "if desired" to the mayo. Not what we're used to but certainly a good start for those not lucky enough to live here. Now about that roll . . .

This may be a sub, this may be a grinder, this may be a sandwich - BUT THIS IS NOT A HOAGIE! People, please step away from the mayo and let the pros handle it. Feel free to have a cheesesteak on the house while you watch.

Great recipe for an easy dinner. Kraft Greek Vinagrette is also good in place of the oil and vinegar mixture.

I make this sandwich once or twice a month and it is always a big hit.

I agree with our friend from Philadelphia. Mayonnaise NEVER belongs on a proper hoagie, only oil & vinegar. Also, I always use two kinds of salami--Genoa and hard. Cappicola, however, is certainly an excellent choice for the ham.

My husband and I loved these sandwiches. I used wonderful Italian sandwich rolls from a local bakery and our own home-grown tomatoes, following the recipe exactly, and they were delicious. I plan to make this recipe again-- soon!
