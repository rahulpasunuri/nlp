I made this the other day and it is, hands down, delicious, rich, and so damned tasty! UNfortunately, as I'm watching my diet, the calories for this puppy are an absolute diet breaker. A standard 12" tart at 1/8 slice (barely a couple of mouthfuls)is 335 calories, so while I can readily control my urges to have a second piece, I don't need the temptation! Regardless--absolutely delicious!

Amazing. I haven't yet met anyone who doesn't love this recipe. This is my go-to recipe for any special occasion. It's perfect to take to a party or potluck because it's delicious at room temp. I can't review the crust because I used a different tart crust recipe, but man is that filling spectacular. Don't use any old goat cheese--Bucheron makes all the difference. It adds a depth of flavor that younger goat cheese simply doesn't have.

I love this tart! The leek confit and goat cheese set in an egg and cream mixture makes for a luxurious yet simple supper. I usually serve my husband and I quarters of the tart with a green salad for dinner, then wrap the other half for lunch the next day. Also, I have been known to use refrigerated pie crusts. Honestly, the filling is so lovely, you won't know the difference. This makes it practical for a weeknight supper as well. Other suggestions: toss in some crisped pancetta or bacon (a little goes a long way!), and/or swap half of the goat cheese for a nice cave- aged gruyere (YUM!). Enjoy!

I got the bucheron, and while it was very good I think any crumbly goat cheese would have been just as good. I loved the dish, my husband thought it was a bit salty.

Wow!! Truly awesome. Add some cut up bacon, the flavors are wonderful.

It might help if I had the correct recipe up before I review it! My apologies...the prior review was directed toward the Salmon, Leek & Goat Cheese Tart. Need my glasses on next time!

I have made this tart five times now and always with rave reviews. The last time I made it (just last week) I made my own crust (worth the effort) and replaced the salmon and lemon juice with my home made duck confit! I think smoked chicken would work, smoked halibut or any number of firm meats. The duck really put it over the top.

I was inspired to make this when I first read Molly Wizenberg's article last year. I finally made it as part of a family brunch buffet and it was a hit. I used a refrigerator pie crust, and probably didn't pre-bake the crust long enough (or maybe I shouldn't have pre-baked it at all?) which caused the filling to leak a little. Regardless, the tart was absolutely delicious, and no one noticed it wasn't perfect.

I have made this a few times and each time, we are licking our plates clean! If you have trouble with the tart crust shrinking, freeze it first and bake it lined with tin foil. Lovely dish for a light supper.

This is a wonderfully reliable recipe. I've make it 4-5 times. Even when the crust has broken up I've poured in the filling and it was lovely. Twice I've been unable to find Bucheron in my grocer's cheese section so I used a mixture of the cheap goat logs and a bleu goat cheese. Be sure to cut off the rind if you're serving to guests... my family loves the rind, but I've found that guests don't!! I double the recipe and pour it into an oversized quiche plate. This is even a wonderful breakfast dish and can be made a day ahead of time.

This needed more cooking time. I found it fab! Very rich and tasty and I would certainly do it again!

We completely screwed this recipe up (forgot to bake the crust first, forgot the cream so simply chucked egg over the top, etc) and it was still fabulous. That's proof of a good tart, if you ask me.

Absolutely divine! Such wonderful flavours and textures. I made two, one using the aged goat cheese and the other using fresh soft goat cheese. Both turned out beautifully and delicious, so if you prefer more mild flavours just use fresh instead of aged. I also added black pepper to the crust to give it some oomph.

I made this for my family and it got great reviews! We served it with salmon and roasted potatoes. Delicious!

This was great. My kids (5-11) all asked for seconds! Next time I'll be doubling the recipe.

This has to be one of the most delicious and simple appetizers i've ever made! The leek confit is out of this world and is so versitale to serve with eggs and even on a slice of bread. It got the best raves at my supper club event last week! This is a keeper!

Delicious tart. I thought the dough was a little hard to work with, don't really know why, but it was flaky and taste great. Served with salad and some prosciutto.

This was great! I've made it twice now, both times using a store bought refrigerator crust. I added a little crumbled bacon which was delicious with the flavors. I topped each slice with a dollop of sour cream and a dab of caviar to show it off for a dinner part. This one will continue to be a favorite.

So, what to you do with the extra 1 tablespoon chilled unsalted butter? There was no mention to that!

This was outstanding. It's the cheese of course that makes the dish, but it's very well balanced. I used the Bucheron, which was perfect. It's also super easy (assuming you're comfortable making a crust). Equally good the next day warmed up.

As everyone else has stated, this was both easy and delicious. Unfortunately, my tart crust didn't fully set after 30 minutes with weights, so when I put the crust back in, it bubbled. Then, as it cooled, it cracked. So, when I added the custard, it almost immediately started leaking out the bottom. But it wasn't a complete disaster and was certainly still edible - and quite delicious. I would encourage bakers to seek out Boucheron or another aged cheese - it made for a much more sophisticated flavor.

This was awesome and will make again!

WOWOW! absolutely divine. sophisticated, simple... enjoyed it with a malbec. crumbled in some extra cheese-- had some purple haze (goat cheese with fennel and lavender) leftover, and it was a tasty (but superfluous) addition. will make this again and again.

Wow. What a simple and delicious dish. Served it with a little prosciutto and melon on the side. Excellent fare.

This dish, composed of such simple ingredients, was absolutely delicious and satisfying. Don't scrimp on the goat cheese and you can't go wrong. I'm already envisioning serving the tart for brunch.

This was exceptionally good;I was able to find the Bucheron goat cheese recommended and the whole things was quite easy to prepare in stages during the day and can be done ahead, as well. Served with fresh tomato wedges it was an excellent light supper!!

Definitely a keeper. Wonderfully rich flavor.
