Very good soup just as written. The only change I made was to toast the caraway seeds after crushing.

Very nice and easy. I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and a splash of pure maple syrup. Yum! Very autumnal and light. Served with hummus and pita. Great meal.

This soup is wonderful!. Perhaps because I had my doubts about carrot soup, my pleasure at its good taste surprised me. It's simple and easy to make. The caraway added complexity of flavor. I served it along side the pistachio pesto chicken. I think I would double to recipe next time, because the four of us only had enough to fill half coffee mugs each.

This was a great soup - altho I have to admit I modified it some. I added 1# butternut squash and cooked with carrots, increasing broth to 3-1/4 c. I didn't use aquavit. Anyway, it was great for a light and healthy fall supper.
