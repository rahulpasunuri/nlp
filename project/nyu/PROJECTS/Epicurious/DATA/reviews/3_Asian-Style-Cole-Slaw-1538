Easy and delish. Only had cabbage, carrots and green onions on hand so that's what I used. Added 1T sugar to the dressing which made it much more interesting.

Quick and good. The sesame oil is the dominant flavour, but I think that's the point. I made the recipe exactly and found it to be well balanced and tasty.

This recipe is a good one although I did add/change a couple things as I found it was a tad lacking. I used fresh ginger as well as added some garlic. I didn't have dry mustard so used dijon. I would cut the vinegar a touch and added a tsp of sugar.

Made dressing over a bag of Trader Joe's broccoli slaw. I don't have (don't like) sesame oil, so left it out. Very nice, light slaw.

I omitted the dry ginger,soy sauce and mustard and just used olive oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil and salt and pepper. Toasted sesame seeds and some scallions would be nice.

We love it...a summer staple served with simple grilled salmon or stir-fried shrimp.I do add a dash of chili oil and a pinch of sugar to the dressing.

I love cole slaw but my wife doesn't generally like it. We both loved this one. I could not disagree more with the cook from San Diego who thought the sesame was overpowering - we thought it was great.

Also very good with bagged broccoli slaw/ rainbow salad. I add sesame seeds and/ or chopped peanuts. Fresh ginger is perfect!

Way, way, way too much sesame oil - overpowers everything else in the dressing. Tossed out the first batch. Reduced sesame oil to 1/2 teaspoon, increased vinegar and dry mustard, added 1 teaspoon brown sugar. Much more to our liking, but still not as good as several other recipes in our collection.

We loved this recipe! Served it with ROASTED HALIBUT AND GREEN BEANS WITH ASIAN CILANTRO SAUCE Bon Appétit (April 06); and it was just the perfect side dish. I did add a little bit of sugar too.

I add a scant teaspoon of sugar to the dressing and reducing the sesame oil by half.

I have made this dish multiple times and everyone always loves it. It is easy, healthy and unusual, and is great paired with the salmon burgers with tarragon mayo from that same March 1996 Bon Appetit issue. It has been a staple in our house ever since it was published in the magazine!

I'll give my husband's rating, as I am not a big fan of cabbage. He loved it though & I didn't even use all the veggies, as I didn't have them at the time. I followed the dressing recipe & just used cabbage, added sugar snaps, cilantro, chives, red pepper flakes & topped w/chopped cashews. Served it along w/Chinese roast chicken thighs & sesame asparagus. Made it a couple hours before serving & never had any problems w/it getting soggy. My husband even had leftovers the next day & said it was just fine.

Made the recipe as directed, with no silly modifications.It was very good. This recipe is good the first day but gets soggy overnight. Use it or toss it out.

Yum! This was just what I was looking for. I just had cabbage and carrots--and substituted a few red pepper flakes for the mustard. Would have added chopped peanuts if I'd had them. Fresh red or green peppers, even mayo/yogurt--the variations are endless! This'll be a staple in my house.

It was terrible!

I used angel hair cole slaw, and fresh ginger. I also added peanuts - it was terrific with the modifications! Suggest eating it within an hour of making it.

This was a great recipe with a few minor changes. Napa cabbage works much better and looks better also. Adding some red cabbage is a nice touch also. Scallions definitely and fresh ginger to complete the taste. If you add shredded chicken and chinese crunchy noodles to this you have a dish similar to Wolfgang Puck's Chinois salad. Delish!!!!

I omitted the radicchio and substituted canola oil for vegetable oil. I found this to be very tasty. I can't wait to make it again!

I omitted the radicchio and added extra cabbage to compensate. After tossing it with the dressing, it seemed to lack something, so I added a can of pineapple chunks, a couple of tablespoons of pineapple juice, and two tablespoons of brown sugar, plus another good shake of the mustard, ginger, and sesame oil. Great!

I omitted the radicchio and added purple cabbage. Doubled the spices. Then it was excellent. Great with Delmarva Crab Cakes with Remoulade and a nice Hogue Riesling.

I found that this cole slaw didn't have a strong enough flavor to register with my guests. It didn't taste distinctly Asian, despite adding freshly grated ginger and all of the other ingredients. I won't make it again.

I used napa cabbage for this dish and omitted the raddichio. I also added a few scallions and used fresh ginger instead of ground; both of which added a nice bite.

I would leave out the radicchio which I always find too bitter. The dressing was excellent!

A different cole slaw. I used freshly grated ginger which gave it more life.
