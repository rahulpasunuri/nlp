the lemon twist was our favorite par of the dish, nothing remarkable, especially for the work involved. Was ok, not bad by any means, but will not do it again.

Excellent and extremely tasty, with wonderful texture. I made a couple of small modifications - added a bunch of sliced shiitake and baby bella mushrooms sauteed with the onions (added them back in at the same time as the tomatoes and asparagus). I omitted the arugula and halved the tomatoes. It was truly lovely!

i would definitely make this again. i did make a few changes, based on comments and taste. used some white wine at the beginning, chicken broth instead of vegetable. increased the garlic, lemon zest and cheese. and added lemon juice and chili. left out the arugula but added parsley on top when served. very tasty and lots leftover. lots of room to play around with additions in the future.

This is a great vegetarian main dish. As others have said, it yields a TON of food, but it's delicious even as leftovers! I used a can of Italian tomatoes since some commented it was bland and I used 1 tsp zest as some suggested. I also used 2 cups chopped spinach since I didn't have arugula. It was perfect! Healthy and hearty.

Easy to make. Even cut in half, this would serve 3-4 people. I used fresh tomatoes because that's what I had. Texture, color and flavors good. Stick with the recommended amount of lemon zest--very fresh but NOT overwhelming.

Made this for a potluck and it was wonderful. Used 7 1/2 total cups of liquid: 1 cup vermouth (first), 6 1/4 cups broth, and 1/4 cup lemon juice stirred in at end. It travelled much better than arborio risotto - the cheese didn't get clumpy after resting. Good at room temperature and chilled as well!

I love this - I followed the recipe as written although I cut back on the lemon zest per others' comments and added some chopped chard. I used olive oil instead of butter and reggiano instead of parmesan. I would like to see the people for whom this is four servings. It's more like 24 -- It makes easily three quarts in volume judging by how full my 4 quart saucepan is. And it's extremely dense and filling. It definitely takes close to two hours of cooking with fairly close attention.

This dish benefits from additional garlic and onion and reggiano- I also liked it with mixed mushrooms (sauteed in the butter with the onions) and some chicken broth.

I would not make this dish again. I am vegetarian and used to bland food, but this had very little flavor. My husband did not like it at all. I heated up leftovers and added some red pepper flakes, but it was not much better. I loved the idea of using barley as "risotto," but there is not enough flavor or texture besides the barley and asparagus. Maybe it would be much better with a bit more spice and lots more veggies.

I have made this a few times now and LOVE it. The only changes I make are: I omit the butter and use olive oil instead because it is healthier, more garlic, and instead of the arugula I use 2 cups of fresh spinach. YUM!

very good, healthy, and colorful. Used chicken broth only need 6 cups and substitute a teaspoon of lemon juice for lemon peel.

I accidently bought diced tomatos with medium green chili peppers - WOW, it was abosolutely terrific. I don't like too much kick when it comes to hot dishes, this was right on the mark. I just got married a couple of weeks ago, and hubbie has high cholesterol, this is a great high fiber healthy dish. Really, if I can make it without a major kitchen fire, anyone else can too.

Wonderful! What a nice suprise, I hadn't realized that barley would create a nice creamy sauce the way risotto rice does. I followed the recipe pretty faithfully - all I did was add some lemon juice at the end because I didn't find that the zest made the flavor strong enough. I shaved some high-quality parmesan over the top and we just LOVED it. You should note, though, that this is a very filling dish. My boyfriend and I probably each only had about 1.5 cups cooked of the risotto and we were stuffed. Not a problem, though, because the leftovers were also good (although the asparagus gets a little stringy when reheated). This one's a keeper.

As I don't usually make barley, this recipe was a nice change of pace from the usual side dish. Hearty, rustic and a good autumn dish! I followed the advice of other reviews and used 1 tsp of lemon zest; I woulnd't make any other changes.

This is a fabulous side dish for just about anything I can think of or a great vegetarian feast too. I made it exactly as stated (with arugula) but used only a teaspoon of lemon peel and it's top drawer. However, serving wise, it's more like fourteen servings than four.

Absolutely fab recipe! I was a little wary of using barley at first, but the results quite convinced me to make this a favorite. Definitely reduce the amount of lemon zest, I used just a teaspoon of it and that was quite enough. Try substituting parsley with cilantro... it adds a real nice twist.

As for the taste, it was very good. Everyone who ate it liked it. It has enough flavor to satisfy those that like interesting foods, but it wasn't too strong for my guests that prefer blander tastes. Per other reviews of this dish, I used less lemon zest than the recipe called for, and that was a wise choice; had the lemon flavor been any stronger, it would have taken away from the rest of the flavors. Using barley instead of a rice is a great idea. It actually seems "heartier" than real risottos. The only problem with this recipe is that it was rather time-consuming. Don't make it if you have less than two hours.

Wow! We have always loved all of the elements in this recipe, but the way they came together was a revelation. I guess barley "risotto" is a new food fad, but I'm all for it. Followed the recipe closely, with the following changes: used 1/2 butter, 1/2 olive oil; omitted fresh greens (none on hand); nuked aspagarus and doubled the amount; added lemon juice as well as zest; added white wine in place of some of the broth. Now I'm thinking, there's so much potential here....mushrooms? poached chicken or fish? the possibilities are endless. You owe it to yourself to try this one. P.S. It did take a full hour +.

Yum! Made this dish as part of a holiday meal and loved the chewy texure of the barley. I added only 1 tsp of lemon zest based on others comments and the flavor was great. The only change I would make is to serve the asparagus on the side instead of adding it to the risotto.

I really disliked this recipe, even though I enjoy all the components. The night it was prepared & served, it didn't have much flavor at all. When I ate the leftovers for lunch the next day, the lemon peel totally overwhelmed the dish (even though I cut back on the amount based upon other cooks' recommendations). I ended up throwing the rest away.

I really enjoyed the chewy texture and the zesty flavors of this "risotto". It was unexpectedly hearty - kept me from snacking all afternoon. Great recipe to keep around for those vegetarian dinners.

This was very good and enjoyed by the whole family. We took the advice of others who had rated the recipe and decreased the lemon zest. It was yummy!

This was a pleasant surprise. I probably wouldn't have tried it if it hadn't been for the enthusiastic reviews. Terrific taste--and heart healthy too!

I made this for a small dinner party and my guests liked it so much that they bought the magazine the next day. I agree that the dish serves many more than four. I went light on the lemon zest and think I would miss the tang if left out all together.

I forgot the lemon (oops) so I didn't have the problem the other cooks did. The serving sizes are huge! I made if for a small dinner party of four all of us pretty normal eaters and we each had our own leftovers for lunch the next day. And incidentally, it reheats lovely in the micro.

I made this for a dinner party I attended. I agree with the previous reviewers. The lemon flavor was slightly overpowering. The overall taste of the dish was delicious. I will definitely make this again. It serves more than 4 people.

This recipe turned out above and beyond our expectation. If making it again I would go conservative on the lemon. I did a zest and it over powered the risotto slightly. Still amazing though.... It is every bit as colourful as the picture. I would not hestitate to serve this to company. I served it with a baked skinless breast of chicken rubed with olive oil sprinkled with thyme and lemon. Baked at 350 fot 20 min bone side up, turn over , raise temp to 375 and cook for 20 more min.

I really enjoyed this dish, really very tasty, however, I did think that the lemon flavour came through a little too strong and overpowered the other flavours. I can't believe that this was supposed to serve 4 people, the serving sizes would be just humongous as the dish is quite filling. Would make it again with the lemon toned down.
