I made this for Christmas. I wasn't able to get Strega, so I used Galliano instead. It worked very well. Everyone loved it. I used whole filberts as a decoration at the edge of the torte (arranged like a clock face) in addition to the chocolate. I made a "trial" (half-size) cake before doing the final version. A half recipe makes a cute little cake for a small family or office party.

My guests loved this torte. I will add a little more Strega in the next one.

Made this for Christmas Eve. Very easy, not to heavy as far as desserts go. Everyone liked it.Don't let the taste of the strega discourage you, it works well in this recipe. I also sprinkled the top with cinnamon for a little extra and I am glad I did.
