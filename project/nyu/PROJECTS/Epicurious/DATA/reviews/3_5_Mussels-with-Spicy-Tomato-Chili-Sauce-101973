Best mussel recipe I have made - every time it is a crowd-pleaser! The flavors add zing to mussels. Wonderful served with bread.

Way too salty. I made it for a mussel-loving crowd, and had lots leftover that I had to throw out. Extremely embarassing. Flavours not spectacular either, I couldn't get past the saltiness.

this receip is wonderful. i used 3 tabelspoons of garlic and used diced tomatoes with chili seasoning. I also used 4 pounds of mussels instead of 2. It is a great flavor and would diffently make it again

I could not find the pretty New Zealand mussels, so I used "plain old" East Coast mussels. Not as visually appealing, but a nice flavor. I prepared the sauce ahead, then re-heated the sauce in a Dutch oven and steamed the mussels per recipe directions. Super-fast -- and when you're serving a buffet for 40 people, this is KEY. Serve with a wonderful crusty bread for dunking, and lots of napkins. Not a dry plate in the house!

This dish is wonderfully tasty. I did find it to be a bit too sour/salty due to the black bean sauce, so i added about 2-3 tablespoons of sugar. As some of the existing reviews already mentioned, this dish does have a lot of broth, so I served it over hot cooked linguine, which was perfect. Once my guests were done with the pasta and mussels, they simply sipped the leftover broth because it was so tasty.

The recipe doesn't say, but I suspect this is a soup though others have mentioned they served it over pasta. The "sauce" is thin and plentiful. It looked like a soup to me when it was finished so I served it as a soup! It was delicious.

Love it!!!! I used Ro*Tel Mexican festival diced tomatoes with lime juice and cilanto...Added more great zest to this dish...Easy to make and great to eat.

Our guests just raved. I have served this as an hors d'oeuvre and as a main course ladled over pasta (make sure to have a rustic crusty bread when served as a main course).

I thought the sauce was addictive. One word of advice -- let others know this is definitely NOT an italina marinara sauce, even though it may look similar, before they taste the dish, so as not to have a preconceived notion of what the dish should taste like. My guests had a little difficulty adjusting to the unique flavors, as they were expecting the italian version.

Very impressive flavor for such an easy, quick-to-prepare recipe! I served this over hot linguine; guests thought this ranked with sauces from top Italian resturants in the Philly area. Ingredients now a staple in my pantry for impromptu gatherings!
