Excellent, easy and enthusiastic eating and positive reviews from everyone in the family. Thank you!

Really keeps the chicken from drying out, and gives a technique that has seen me through many a flavorful chicken+sauce combination--once you get this down, you can sort of unload the fridge on your chicken with confidence.

So easy and tasty. I saute the onions and add garlic before mixing the rest of the sauce ingredients. Other than that, I make it as is. Perfect with green beans and roasted potatoes. Yum!

I'm glad I read the reviews before putting this together. Used no salt broth, no salt butter and cut down on the worcestershire as many suggested and it was still on the verge of being too salty. Instead of tabasco I used Blair's Golden Death Sauce - YUM!! It was quite tangy and delicious. It's a keeper!

Quick, fairly easy and the wife LOVED it! I made a little modification and used this new mustard she got me for Christmas - Lusty Monk Burn in Hell chipotle mustard - WOW! The sauce was amazing! The mustard is sooo good and from a small company that I'd love to support, or as they say "Spread the lust!" If you like spicy mustard, check 'em out! http://LustyMonk.com

Made this last night for my husband and I. We just loved it !!! It was better than I expected. The only change I made was using unsalted butter

As usual, been making this for 2 decades! Always a favorite with family & friends. Great dish for a dinner party. Can be made ahead until sauce reduction, & then finished off! Just LOVE BA Recipes!

It was very good, but we also found it salty. Next time I'll likely omit salt wherever possible (Worcestershire).

LOL - I just reviewed this recipe twice in a row. Sorry! I was overwhelmed by my own enthusiasm.

I just love this recipe. The chicken gets deliciously tender after simmering in the mustard mix, and it's so tasty it's hard to stop eating it! We hardly ever have leftovers. I'm a frozen-Costco-chicken-breasts kind of girl, so I usually "modify" this recipe by using a couple of defrosted breasts, cut up into chunks, rather than bother with a whole chicken. I never end up with "too much" sauce. :) Highly recommended!

We eat chicken almost every night and I'm always looking for good South-Beach friendly recipes - this is one of the best I've ever found! My husband loves it too. Good on its own or with a salad, and I'm sure it would be amazing on rice. It's hard to mess this one up.

This recipe is SO simple yet totally delicious. The only change I made was the use of a flavored dijon mustard (dried tomatoes and chili) for 2Tbs but I used the regular dijon mustard for the 1/4 cup. I will definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. My husband and two-year old both love it. I make it with chunks of chicken (which makes it more toddler-friendly) and serve it over rice. A good quick mid-week meal that tastes like you spent hrs. in the kitchen.

Rating: 3
This is a deceptively simple recipe that produces just the right amount of mustard flavor while retaining the flavor of the chicken. The deception is the flavor that you get from combining all the initial ingredients without first sweating or browning them before adding them to the pan with the browned chicken. Made it twice to rave reviews.

Rating: 3
This was very good, but -- wow -- was it salty. I used low-salt broth. I will look for low- salt worcestershire sauce, and maybe try a different mustard next time (I used Grey Poupon.) Also, I used chicken tenders and even though I removed them completely while I reduced the sauce, I overcooked them. I'm sure chicken parts are more forgiving.

Rating: 4
Easy to make and delicious immediately after preparing and the next day. The sauce could definitely work on other meats and even tasted great with the salad and roasted carrots we made as side dishes.

Easy & husband loved it. I thought it was great, as well, but a bit on the salty side. Next time I'll reduce the Worchestershire just a skosh. Even better the next day!

Wonderful and versatile sauce. I used whole pork tenderloins instead of chicken to great success. I'd do it again in a flash. Yummy!

Rating: 4
This was really delicious and super easy to make. I added leeks to the mustard sauce, like another reviewer suggested. I used chicken thighs, as that was all I had on hand. The sauce is fairly rich, so I just served it with vegetables as it seemed like serving with rice or another grain would end up feeling too heavy. I ended up with leftover sauce, which was delicious the next day over some simple broiled salmon.

this is amazing! it made enough sauce to use as a dip for steamed artichokes. the only substitutions i made were shallots instead of onions and i used 4 turkey cutlets. i will definitley make this again. it was a wonderful dish to share with our guests.

Loved this, but it was really salty (and I did not add any salt)...I did use half grainy (Grey Poupon) and half smooth (Maille). But it was DELISH!!!

Rating: 4
would probably give this 3.5 forks, but rounded up because it was so easy! used chicken breasts and salted very very lightly before browning...was not too salty, but very savory and delicious!! served with artichokes, mixed green salad and brown rice (you can buy frozen precooked packages at Trader Joes that microwave in 3 min) an effortless dish with universal appeal!

Rating: 3
I thought this was a good recipe as I usually have all the ingredients needed already in my pantry. One change I did make was to add sliced leeks to the pan when the chicken was being braised. The leeks upped the flavour quotient enough without adding any extra fat or too many calories. I also reduced the amount of butter and used no salt butter along with low sodium broth. I would make this recipe for friends as well.

I make this recipe often, me and my husband love it. I use chicken breast or pork chops. When I cook with the pork chops, I just use water instead of the chicken broth.

Rating: 3
YUMMY! Even my nearly 2 year old son liked it. I agree with the other reviewers concerns over it being a little salty. I will season less next time and use low/no sodium chicken broth. Also, I used only half of the butter/oil and that was plenty. This one is a keeper.

Rating: 4
Fabulous!! An excellent dish, easy to prepare with most ingredients people have on hand!!! And with chicken breasts, could be used for entertaining. I made with just chicken thighs on-hand in the freezer, only chicken bouillon, a different hot sauce and using a Worchester just for chicken that has white wine in it. And it still turned out just fine!!

Tasty and easy -- a great mid-week dish. I didn't have Tabasco on hand, so I added a dash of chile powder.

Big hit with the family, even the non-mustard-loving children. Had a wonderful flavor. The mustard was not over-powering. I did it with boneless chicken breasts, and did add a little fat-free half n half at the end.

LOVE this recipe! It's super easy and oh SO good. Like some others, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I think next time I will cut the chicken into strips before browning so there's more sauce per bite.

Rating: 3
Note that it is very important to use 'low sodium added' chicken broth; I didn't have any on hand and used salted broth - the dish was still very good, albeit way too salty. Nonetheless, this is a fabulous quick recipe, excellent flavor and the sauce is a perfect consistency (not to soupy.) Recommended for those on the Atkins or South Beach Diet - worked very well with fresh asparagus and broiled pesto tomatoes!

Great recipe, easy and fast. Used chicken thighs, removed fat before adding mustard sauce and replaced dried herbs with fresh thyme.

My husband found this recipe and he made it and it turned out great. We've made it a couple of times since then using different parts of the chicken, and each time it's delicious!

Easy to prepare, delicious sauce. Just what I wanted in a recipe for chicken in mustard sauce. As I can't stand "wobbly" chicken skin, I placed the chicken under the broiler after sauteeing. Near East makes a very good rice pilaf with almonds. If your local store carries this brand , I highly recommend it as an accompaniment.

Super-yummy! Easy to make! Easy to eat! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts in lieu of a whole chicken and had to make my own herbes de provence (worth the effort) and this dish turned out great. The sauce makes the dish.

This recipe was better than my Dijon Chicken recipe! I used boneless, skinless thighs, since I have a tendency to over cook my chicken (child distractions). Easy on the salt, b/c the mustard has salt, too!

Can't wait to make this simple, delicious dish again! Only changes I made were using unsalted butter and did not sprinkle chicken with salt as I only had regular chicken broth on hand, and I used boneless/skinless breasts. Do try! KIMBER

Umm, umm, good! My whole family loved this dish, even my picky 8 yr. old who doesn't eat anything with a sauce on it! White rice is must. I made this just as written, except I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead. After reducing the sauce and scraping up the brown bits in the pan it looks and tastes great. Took previous reviewers advice and held back on salt, since I didn't have low-salt chicken broth. Great week-night "what do I do tonight with chicken breasts?" dinner!

Rating: 3
A quick yet elegant chicken dish with a very piquant and flavorful sauce. My finished dish came out a touch too salty, but probably because I only had regular chicken broth vs. the low-salt variety. I won't salt the chicken next time since there are already enough salty flavors with the mustard and worcestershire. For weeknight ease, I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. As luck would have it, I happened to have a mixture of butter, mustard, thyme & parsley sitting in the fridge (from "Grilled Cheddar Cheese and Ham Sandwiches," also on this site) and used it in place of regular butter to saute (how perfect is that??). Once I reduced the sauce, I returned the chicken pieces to the pan to coat with the sauce. And, yes, white rice is the perfect side dish. Thumbs up!

Made this last night based on the raves below. Hubbie liked it -- I was disappointed. Used chicken breast pillards to make it quickly -- maybe that was the problem. Love dijon mustard, but this sauce seemed too salty, with not enough zing. Roasted asparagus and white rice were great accompaniments, though!

This recipe was much more subtle and elegant than I expected. I had all of the ingredients in the kitchen already and its preparation was so quick! We all loved it--a definite keeper.

Rating: 3
Delicious! Quite elegant for such a simple dish. I was concerned the garlic would be too much but it was just right. I used boneless chicken and it was great. The sauce proportions make more of a coating than lots of sauce to spoon over the chicken...I think it is best as a coating. I made extra but didn't really use it. I served it with white rice and steamed asparagus. Very good.

This dish was pretty simple to prepare and was vary flavorful. I served it with Asparagus w/ parmasean and prochiutto and toasted slices of french bread with parmesean. The proscuitto made things a bit salty overall so I might omit that next time but I will make this again. I used a little flour at the end to help thicken the sauce.

Rating: 4
"Outstanding" was the way my husband described this dish. My only changes: I used boneless chicken breast, and I didn't add the butter. Otherwise, I made the sauce exactly as stated. It was absolutely delicious!! As the other reviewer noted, the mustard really mellows--you can taste it but it isn't at all overpowering. This recipe deserves 4 forks for deliciousness, AND, the fact that it can be made with just the basic ingredients you have in your fridge. It is also incredibly simple--essential for someone who gets home too late to make anything too elaborate. This is my new favorite weeknight meal, but I think it is good enough for company. I love this website! Here I am planning tonight's dinner when I should be working... :-)

Love this recipe and make it often. I usually remove some of the fat after cooking the chicken, though.

Wow. This was very tasty. My husband and kids loved it. The sauce is delicious but rich. I think next time I will cut way back on the fat used to sautee the chicken. I served this with rice and haricort vert with pine nuts.

I would never have tried this recipe if not for my foodie brother who said, 'you must make this one'. I'm glad I did. It's not only tasty, it's easy. I've now made it four times and have given the recipe to everyone who will take a copy. The mustard mellows into a deep flavored, intense sauce that is great on buttered noodles or plain Basmati rice.

Instead of removing the grease (as others have suggested), I kept the original amount of oil/butter and doubled the other sauce ingredients. This was a huge hit with the family. I served it with white rice and grilled asparagus. Yum, yum, yum!

Rating: 3
Great and easy. While the sauce was reducing, we deboned the chicken (added benefit, loss of some (but not all!) skin). Put the chicken over rice and poured the sauce all over. Next time over pasta. Definitely drain grease and up tobasco sauce. A keeper!

This was wonderful! You do have to really like mustard to enjoy this recipe but I thought it was fantastic! I added more tabasco then it asked for (I tripled it) and I added lots of pepper to the sauce. TOTAL winter comfort food. REALLY nice!

Benefits outweigh effort. Definitely must be a mustard fan. Would make again for everyday chicken

Rating: 4
This was outrageously good! However, there's a very important step missing from the instructions: you have to DRAIN the chicken of all grease before you add the mustard/broth mixture. Just take the chicken out of the pan, throw away the grease and proceed with the recipe. Otherwise you'll have an oily mess. I would definitely double the sauce next time --it's that good! And yes, we skinned the chicken first. My husband strained the sauce and added a Tablespoon or two of creme fraiche at the end (heavy cream would do, too.) A lot of flavor for such an easy recipe! Great with steamed carrots and red bliss potatoes and chives --a real bistro meal!

Since I didn't have any real hot sauce I used taco sauce instead and it came out just fine. Great for mustard and garlic addicts such as myself :)

This recipe was very good. Although, I did have to make a couple adjustments because I didn't have all the ingredients. I substituted the Worcestershire with AI, didn't have tobasco. I also didn't have unsalted chicken broth so I opened a can of soup, drained it and put half water to keep the salt level down. I served with small potatoes which I simmered with the chicken and white rice. Thanks for the great recipe.

This dish is very easy and very tasty! I did not use "low sodium" chicken broth (as directed)and it was a bit on the salty side - oops! I boosted the amount of onions to a whole cup and this really added to the flavor - yum yum! I served steamed broccoli as the side dish and it was a perfect blend with the chicken and sauce!

Rating: 3
Very good dish and easy to make with very basic ingredients that can be found in your home on any given day. I used chicken quarters and the meat practically fell off the drumstick portions. I didn't feel the mustard flavor was overpowering at all, but I guess it could be depending on the kind you use. I felt the chicken had an excellent, subtle flavor, and I also agree that the sauce is a must! (I added some chopped garlic to mine) This dish held up well for leftovers and the chicken was still extremely moist and tasty. I even added some chopped chicken to my omelet the next morning with a dash of Balsamic vinegar. Microwaves well and the kids/hubby loved it. I also made broccoli with an extra lemony Hollandaise sauce and orzo. I think the jasmine rice would definitely be a better accompaniment and will use that next go round. The presentation wasn't that bad, but fresh herbs can always be used to spruce up a dish that is otherwise very tasty but not quite as visually appealing. Enjoy!

Rating: 3
My husband and I thought this was great. I didn't think the taste was at all strong as some people commented. It was also very easy. The only problem I had with it was that I needed to cook the chicken 45 minutes after browning (not 20) for it to be cooked through.

I did not like this AT ALL! It was way too mustardy tasting, had no "eye appeal" and had no other redeeming qualities.

Rating: 3
Terrfic dish! I too would urge that extra sauce be made as it is the key to this recipe. I increased the chicken broth, worchestershire, tabasco, and herbes de Provence and also about a cup of dry white wine. I thickened the sauce with arrow root. Used boneless, skinless chicken breast cut diagonally into pieces and reduced the butter/olive oil (you don't need so much!). I took one rater's suggestion and served with jasmine rice and steamed broccoli. Excellent!

Rating: 4
We had to improvise since we had neither tabasco sauce nor onions in the house; we skipped the onion altogether and substituted a heaping teaspoon of vindaloo paste for the tabasco sauce. Also, I skinned the chicken since I do not like chicken skin in braised or stewed dishes. We also used German-style brown mustard instead of Dijon. It was superb and became a family favorite with the first bite. This is a rather flexible dish, I think.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. I would recommed playing with different types of mustards for a variety.

Not for the weak of palate! This is a very big dish. Next time would cut back on the amount of herb and mustard used. Needs very bland side such as rice or pasta to soak up the rich, pungent sauce.

Fantastic recipe. I doubled the amount of sauce and used three large boneless skinless chicken breasts (or six halves). My guests and I loved the bold sauce which not only tasted great, but made the whole house smell wonderful while cooking. I recommend this dish wholeheartedly -- and I agree with another rater who encouraged others to make extra sauce. It's delicious.

This is an easy, and very flavorful dish. Don't be fooled by the strength of the mustard. The chicken broth mellows the flavor nicely. Everyone I have given this recipe to has enjoyed it! Tastes great over jasmine rice with steamed broccoli.
