The salad and dressing are good, but the pears make this outstanding. It's perfect for entertaining - simple but different.

I have had many, many people ask me for this recipe since I introduced it to a soup luncheon. It was enjoyed by all. I love how light it is and the different flavors , but I expecially like how easy it is to put together.

I'd have to agree with one of the other cooks. I was looking for a different, unique salad other than my usual go-to's & this was a nice change of pace. Now I have 3 go-to's that I can put into rotation.

Perfect use for pears that aren't ripe enough to eat out of hand...the roasting makes them sweet, soft, and delicious! Some of the greens listed were really expensive and didn't look all that great at the store, so I just used a mixture of watercress and baby greens, which was really yummy! I also loved the dressing...light and easy!

The bitter greens are a nice change of taste in a salad. I caramelized the shallot and pears together (in unsalted butter), tossed them w/ the greens (while still warm) and topped w/ sugared pecans. Beautiful!

I've made this twice and it is great. The first time I followed the recipe (minus a few of the greens I couldn't find), and it was wonderful. The roasted pears are amazing. The second time I bought a pre-packaged organic herb and greens salad, roughly chopped the pears (not as pretty, but it was a less-formal meal), and roasted them the night before. Just prior to serving, I sautéed the pears with some prosciutto and olive oil to give it a different flair. That, combined with the dressing, was amazing.

Delicious! Couldn't find all the greens & it really didn't matter anyway. Added some candied pecans for crunch. The pears made the salad. These greens don't wilt so easy to make ahead.

I purchased a bag of prewashed greens and combined them with some crispy romaine. This is a terrific salad. My guests & I loved it.

This is a fabulous salad. I used packaged European greens and added some toasted pecans. The roasted pears and the dressing make this salad among the most interesting I've seen.

I use any mix of baby greens and add walnuts or pecans and dried cranberries. Excellent.

I used Romaine lettuce and also topped the salad with toasted pecans(chopped). I love the dressing. I will definitely make this again!
