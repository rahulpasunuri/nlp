Added 1/3 cup diced ham to the filling, I think without it would have been bland. Used frozen tomato puree from my winter CSA to make the sauce, which was simple, easy, and fresh tasting. The crepes were easy and delicious. Altogether, a wonderful meal. My husband chased me around the kitchen table.

A bit time-consuming, but easy and delicious. Out of necessity, I made some substitutions, but nothing that would dramatically change the recipe or that should anger purists. Firstly for the filling, I used sweet peppers from my CSA in lieu of the green bell pepper and reduced the oil to about 2TBSP. In an effort to be healthy, I also only used 8oz of ricotta. Secondarily, I used only fresh heirloom tomatoes (again from the CSA) in lieu of the canned, omitted the tomato paste, and used 1.5 tsp minced fresh basil from my garden. Because I didn't use any tomato paste, I simmered the sauce the entire time I was making the filling and crepes so it would thicken and the end result was rich and a perfect consistency. I used fresh chives from my garden for the crepes--which I will definitely repeat. They smelled AMAZING while cooking. The recipe doesn't state--but perhaps it goes without saying--but seasoning the sauce and filling to taste with salt and pepper is crucial. Particularly with the filling, because as written, it's a little bland. I ended up with a total of 8, 8" crepes (didn't bother measuring the batter and just ladled it into the pan) and hubby and I found ourselves full after each eating 3. With the full amount of cheese, this would definitely serve 4 people as 2 crepes per person would be sufficient. Next time I make this, I'd still stick with the changes I made this round because the biggest changes made involved changing from using canned/dried ingredients to fresh--and you can't go wrong with that. Bottom line: this tasty, easy and definitely worth making.

Made this for vegetarian dinner guests. Substituted spinach for the red bell pepper and it went over well. And I used vegetable broth instead of chicken or beef. It's a nice alternative instead of just making pasta for vegetarian guests.

Really tasty! I made this on a week night, so used pre- made crepes from the grocery store (found in the produce section). They were only 45 calories each and really good and a huge time savings. With that out of the way, the dish came together relatively easily, and everyone really enjoyed it. I added some chopped spinach (raw) to the ricotta mixture, and added shallots when cooking the pepper. Used only 1 TBSP of oil (1/4 c seemed unnecessarily excessive). Will definitely make this one again!

Fine, but on the bland and not too interesting side. Not worth the time it takes to make.

Excellent cheese filling although I used red instead of green bell pepper and added chopped ham. Raymond Oliver's crepe recipe, which contains beer, is the ne plus ultra. I think next time, I'll saute a couple of chopped shallots, then add shredded, squeezed zucchini and lightly cook it. Add a bit of chopped basal to the tomato sauce. But I'm so happy to get away from the traditional bechamel.

Not rating the whole dish, just the crepes, so I am apologizing in advance to purists that get nuts over that. Some of the best, easiest crepes I've ever made. Have made them lots of different ways, with lots of different combinations of fresh herbs. Will try the whole recipe when I have a free weekend ;-)

This dish was delicious and easy. It is very time consuming, however. I made the sauce and crepes a day ahead, assembling and finishing the recipe just before dinner. This is the first time I've made crepes and I was a bit hesitant. If it's your first try, go for it! For me, the trick was medium heat, swirling the pan until the batter was set, patience to wait for the edges to pull from pan before turning, and a non-stick spatula designed for fish fillets (it's long and wide) AND high temperatures. (My original spatula began to melt as the pan became hotter.) My skillet is 8 inches, thus I needed about 1/4 cup of batter per crepe, yielding 8 total. I did wilt a bag of baby spinach in the olive oil and garlic in place of pepper. A lot of work, but worth it!

Everything about this dish was delicious. Unfortunately, crepe-making isn't one of my particular talents, so it was not an attractive dish. I told my husband to close his eyes and tell me how good it tasted. He did say that he liked the tomato sauce better than the spaghetti sauce I usually make from scratch.

omg - delicious crepes, as easy to make as crepes can be. I used fresh plum tomatoes for the can of tomatoe sauce, and cooked them for 5 minutes to soften. I also added half a fresh jalapeno pepper, which gave it the perfect amount of spicyness. My wife raved (which made me VERY happy.. :-) )

I had to make this florentine style, with spinach in the mix rather than the pepper, but the crepes came out nice and the cheese was great. Substituted a premade sauce to make it quick but it still came out great.

To Jeff from Chicago- you are so right. thank you for reminding us. as you said, food plays a role in our cultures, families and also a form of art. happy holidays everyone!

This was good, light tasting (though it's not light), attractive. Time consuming just due to the crepes, but fun. Would make again probably, though I did not think that the leftovers tasted good at all and the recipe makes a lot. Will have to invite company next time I guess...

As I watched the World Trade Center attack coverage on TV, I found making this recipe strangely comforting. As life gets faster and more complex, we seem to be losing touch with the role foods have always played as important touchstones to cultures all over the world--as ways to comfort us, to bring us together, to commemorate our past, and to celebrate life. The simple act of cooking this meal for my family during this terrifying time in our history accomplished those things for me. More importantly, each time I make this dish, I will always remember the bravery, courage and defiance the people of my country showed on one of its most awful days. The dish itself isn't important, just the act of gathering with those we love at the food table to share and to remember. Consider food not as something to ingest quickly while running out the door, but as something to comfort us, to bring us together and to sustain our souls and our spirits as well as our bodies.

A really delicious recipe. I broke the prep down into stages, made the crepes ahead and kept them in the freezer. I also used a tomato cream sauce from another recipe on this site (Shrimp and Crab Cannelloni). Try it out, it's a delicious sauce, although a bit time consuming. I made that ahead too, and kept it in the fridge. After those steps were done, this recipe became an easy weeknight dinner, only 20 minutes in the oven! I used a mix of parsley, chives, and cilantro in my crepes. I only came up with 12 crepes total from the batter recipe, not 16, which is perfectly fine, since the recipe only fills 12 crepes anyway. I threw all the Parmesan into the ricotta filling, and skipped the brushing with melted butter part.

Just wonderful!!!! Every time I have a special guest I do this recipe. I can do it the day before, forget about being in the kitchen and the flavor and presentation of this recipe surprise you. Try it, it worth it!!!!

Wonderful. An elegant entree. I'd put less salt in the tomato sauce, however.
