I tripled this recipe and prepared it for ten people on Christmas day using a couple Roseda Beef tenderloin roast. It was easy to prepare and the results were spectacular! All of my quests were totally wowed! I used the recipe as written, no modifications.

Very easy and impressive meal! Read the reviews and also added 1 sliced shallot and 1 cup sliced cremeni mushrooms.

Outstandingly simple to make. I couldn't find demi glaze in a jar however found these pouches at Kroger that I mixed with water. I used mushrooms rather than the red peppers. I would put this in my top five of all time favorite EPI recipes.

Wow, indeed, just made this for Christmas dinner. I substituted mushrooms for the red pepper as previously suggested and because I didn't have demi-glace, boiled down organic beef broth with sherry and balsamic glace, then added the mushrooms and simmered, then added cornstarch at the end to thicken. Best gravy I've ever had.

I made this for our Winter Solstice dinner and it was absolutely amazing. My advice: don't skimp on the ingredients. A two pound tenderloin deserves the best! If you can find demiglace, be sure to use it, because it makes a huge difference. Also, use good bacon, for the bacon flavor will make or break the sauce.

Excellent. Prepared this at Thanksgiving for those who don't love turkey and it was such a hit that I will make it again at the Christmas holiday. Cranberry relish from Good Enough to Eat cookbook was a good side dish for this too!

WOW! OMG! Delicious! Substituted cremini mushrooms for the bell pepper. Sauce was to die for!! Thickened sauce with an arrowroot slurry. Did not have demiglace so I reduced organic beef broth. I purchased an untrimmed tenderloin from Costco for Christmas. I saved and froze the Chateaubriand from the loin. 2 delicious meals in one months time! THIS IS A KEEPER!

This recipe is exceptional. I did cut back a bit on rosemary.

Great idea to cook in the pan rather than roasting in the oven. The amount of demiglace was over the top in both taste and quantity. Will try again with much less demiglace.

This is one of my favorite recipes. It's easy to make and everyone always loves it. I, too use More than Gourmet Demi- Glace Gold. I make this dish about 4 times a year as a special treat.

There's a reasonably price demi-glace at Surfas in Culver City, CA (great place to shop if you're local). They ship nationally https://www.surfasonline.com/catalog/search.cfm

I'm Canadian and unlike one reviewer, I do not eat whale blubber, despite the fact that I live in Newfoundland and Labrador. This recipe is fabulous and really easy. I too have used the More Than Gourmet Glace de Viande for years and it is the BEST!! Serve this once and it will become your signature dish!!

This is a faboulous recipe. It's easy and elegant. I use the More than Gourmet Demi -Glace Gold for the sauce, which makes it nice and rich. I always get asked for this recipe when I serve it.

Excellent recipe, our guests loved it, and it made a beautiful centerpiece on the holiday buffet table. If you do not have demi-glace, simply reduce beef stock or consomme by half.

I cooked this on the lowest setting on my gas cooktop and the meat was beyond well done in 25 minutes.

Not crazy about the pepper in the sauce, needs to be a seperate dish entity. Like the idea of browning then simmering to get more of the flavor into the beef. If you really want to be naughty, go to a butcher who sells prime beef and ask him for the top or the fat end of the tenderloin roast and ask him to tie it for you (they have massive amounts of free string don't be stubborn you chefs you) I like to add a bit of boiled down port sauce a la charlie trotter to the finish along with some butter. Mushrooms too, and some nice Sangrantino or Burgundy

This was simple and a perfect alternative to grilling tenderloin. I did not have any demiglace so I used mushroom broth and it worked out well...just a bit more cooking the sauce.

After reading all 28(?)reviews, I decided to make this using demiglace the old home-fashioned way. It did take some extra time. I can say this when you do take the time to make it from scratch-I am not sure I have ever had any sauce that was a good as what I made tonight. This was fantastic. Don't know why the cook from SF gave it such a bad review. I did think others would be interested in a new shortcut to making demiglace, at least to me. You can go out and still by the product sold at Williams and Sonoma for around $30. However, there is a company based in Akron, Ohio, I believe, called "Better than Gourmet." I called them up and spoke to a representative who told me of a demiglace they sell for about 30 bucks, but, it makes over a gallon of demiglace! And, it is very concentrated, and has received rave reviews from some of the cooking magazines. They also sell other wine reduction sauces which I am going to buy and sample. From the sounds of it, they sound very good, and it would take an awfully good tongue to taste the difference between the commercial product and one started from scratch. Just thought some folks might want to know. The 800 number to get contact them is:(800)860-9385. There is another company who also has some quality sauces as well. The name here is "TodHunter", and they can be reached at (561)655-8977.

I have been trying different tenderloin recipes for Christmas for years and this was definitely the best. I also substituted mushrooms (baby bellas) for the red peppers and used Williams Sonoma demi glace. It was perfect.

WOW! I am NO gourmet cook, just a novice that likes to cook a big holiday dinner once a year. I was a little intimidated by this recipe, but it ended up being the best thing I have EVER made!! It was seriously fab, and easy to follow. I made my own demi-glace (a recipe I found somewhere on the net), but it didn't finish in time, so I ended up running to the local Williams-Sonoma (thanks to the reviewer that made that suggestion!). I had to triple the recipe for my large dinner party, and everything went smoothly. But beware, if you're as gauche as I, please know that the meat for this is VERY expensive- this is not a pot roast you're buying. (-: However, it is worth every penny!!!!!!!!

Dependably delicious! A fast and elegant Christmas dinner recipe that everyone enjoyed -- taste, presentation, and savored with a nice Beaujolais! We've made this several times since it was first published in Gourmet in 1998, and this year we prepared the sauce -- from bacon (degreasing) through the red wine, beef stock/demiglace/ rosemary and red pepper -- but we grilled the Chateaubriand on the Weber and braised it briefly to finish -- WOW!

Yes, to the mushrooms & cranberries! A friend prepared this & it was terrific. Is there any reason I can't roast this in the oven turning, once? As the singular "host(ess)", I don't like spending too much time away from my guests.

My golf game was SO poor today that I really needed a success! I used the William Sonoma demi-G, and my only suggestion would be to leave salt out entirely. The canned demi-G is so concentrated that I added more wine and some beef broth. What dumb little white ball when dinner can be this good????

My husband and I have just finished eating this wonderful dish prepared by my daughter. We Canadians are used to chewing on a piece of frozen whale blubber so we were truly impressed by our daughter's culinary skills. We will force her to make this for us again and again!

The sauce is excellent, but after all was said and done, it reminded me of a (fabulous) pot roast I tried from this same website, which obviously used a cheaper cut of meat. FYI, if you can get a beef rib roast at a good price, you can always make your own demiglace for this by trimming the bones and using them for your base stock. Then just use the filleted beef for the chateaubriand.

I made this for Christmas dinner. It didn't take very long to make and I didn't have to heat up the oven and that was nice. The only problem I had was finding the demi-glace. The only place I could find it locally was Williams Sonoma and it was $29! I followed the directions on the jar of demi-glace and only used 2tb and I cooked mushrooms rather than the pepper. Even my picky spouse liked the sauce, miracle of miracles!

This is so easy and delicious. I have made it several times -- always to rave reviews. I add tarragon in addition to the rosemary. I am definitely adding a medley of fresh mushrooms next time based upon the review below.

We made this for Christmas dinner this year and it was scrumptious!!! I had so much demi-glace leftover that we made it again the next week for company and added mushrooms to the sauce - it was even better!! We definately make it again!

fantastic recipe -- followed the directions as-is, bacon, peppers, demi-glace and all. tenderloin was succulent enough to cut with a fork, and really liked the red peppers. was perfect with a side dish of cheese-herb grits from the williams-sonoma catalog. made for a terrific new year's eve.

Easy, elegant, delicious! Did use mushrooms the second time around instead of peppers. This dish is always requested on special occasions.

After all the rave reviews, I tried this for Christmas and was very unimpressed. I like bacon but didn't care for it's flavor in the sauce. I thought the sauce should have been toned down a bit more, perhaps with more red wine. This was easy to make and my guests liked it but I wouldn't try it again.

We made this for Christmas 2001 and took the tip on the mushrooms and dried cranberries, along with Fois Gras in Ginger Cream Sauce (see Sunset magazine, November 2001 I think), roasted beets served atop baby spinach (fresh) with a citrus vinagerette, and gorgonzola & garlic mashed potatoes (those 2 recipes came from www.beringer. com. Heaven. We were unable to find demi glace - Williams Sonoma had a run on in it and that would be only game in Fresno, CA - so we made our own (Joy of Cooking). That was an experience in itself (took 2 days) but we are sure it was well worth it.

Excellent. We baked it last Christmas, and the success was such that we were asked to bake it again on New Year's Eve. We're having it again this Christmas. It has become one of our family's favourites.

For those cooks who can't finds demi-glace - Williams Sonoma sells a pretty good one called Forgotten Tradition - expensive but worth it. Really enhanced this recipe!

I made this the first time exactly per recipe. I got the demi-glace sauce from a French chef at a local restaurant. We didn't care for the red pepper flavor, so the second time, we substituted mushrooms and added dried sweetened cranberries. We will make it this way from now on. I'm ready for Christmas!

This is a good recipe to make on top of the stove if your oven will be in use. I used only 1/2 teaspoon of dried rosemary and added a few small onions, two bay leaves, some garlic and 1 extra cup of water during cooking time. Couldn't find demiglace, so when the meat was done, I added 4 extra cups of water to the pan and 4 packages of Knorr beef gravy mix to make the sauce which came out wonderfully. My family likes their meat to be cooked medium-well, so I took the meat temperature up to 165 degrees. It was perfect for us.

We had this last night for New year's eve (preceded by cracked crab appetizer). It was very very good. I followed the recipe exactly and also used Knorr's demiglace in the sauce. Next time I think I would get some real demiglace from a specialty shop because the mix had somewhat of a "packaged" flavour. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. I took the roast out when it was 122 degrees and rested 10 minutes. It was perfect. My husband and guests were very impressed. This makes a beautiful meal (even better because I got the tenderloin for only 8.97 per lb!)

In one word - WOW! Absolutely scrumptous! I believe this will become a tradition for many holiday meals forthcoming. Demiglace was difficult to find, but, a local caterer shared some - which really enhanced the beef.

Made it for Christmas and seved with mashed potato and sauteed green beans. Everybody LOVED it. Could not find beef demiglace so used Knorr's Au Jus instead. Added chopped portobello mushroom to the sauce and that was very good. This dish was a bit pricey but was well worth it. Definitely a keeper. I'll skip the bacon Next time.

This roast melted in our guests mouth. It was wonderful. I will do it a little different next time, however. The sauce does take longer than 10 minutes to reduce, so I will start that part sooner. Also, I will use only half the peppers next time. This is definitely a keeper.

very good, quick and easy to make. definitely a keeper. we just cut in some flour and butter in lieu of the demiglace. we paired it with classic garlic mashed potatoes.

Dinners this good should be outlawed. Probably the best diner I have ever made. The only hard part was finding the "Beef Demiglace". Knorr's has it under the dry packaged gravies. I passed it up twice not knowing what I was looking for. This meal will be on my table for Christmas Day.

This was the best chateaubriand I have ever eaten! No need to dine out to eat this dish ever again. I added some sliced mushrooms with the peppers when preparing the sauce. Magnificent. The recipe is for 4 people however the 3 of us finished it off and wanted more. I think the next time I prepare this I will cut back on the side dishes as they were neglected. i

As I was looking through Gourmet and Bon Appetit holiday magazines for that perfect, first class Christmas dinner, I came across Christmas Chateaubriand and decided this past Christmas to give it a try. The recipe was very easy to prepare. And, after years of searching and trying different recipes, I knew I struck gold! Christmas Chateaubriand was the most succulent and flavorful tenderloin I ever experienced or made. My father, who is 70 years old, laughed when he said to me, "I don't even need to use my knife." I had finally found the PERFECT Christmas dinner. . .and am so happy and grateful that I came across the recipe. My family and friends agreed that it was the best they ever had and voted Christmas Chateaubriand as our official Christmas dinner for our many Christmases to come. . .it truly is a little piece of heaven. Steve, my family, friends, and I salute and thank you for submitting your recipe and we look forward to many more.
