I made these a day or two before a BBQ and they were a huge hit. Instead of baking the cookies myself, I just bought a box of large cookies from the bakery at Costco. There are so many ways you can change this. I mixed M&M's in some, peppermint, banana chocolate...be creative. They are certainly best straight from the freezer to enjoy and am not sure about packing them in a lunch. I will make these every summer for sure. Even the leftover blended ice cream was great.

I made it for my child's first day of school and they had lunch first so they could be ready for the day. He said that they had gone a bit soggy and it tasted like there wasn't much sugar. I don't know about you, but I certainly am not making this again.
