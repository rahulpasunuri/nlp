Holiday staple. Never have leftovers. Need not change anything...maybe less marshmellow cream. I do add prayer pulp back into take.

I love this recipe. I have made it several times and it is always a big hit. I add the zest of 1 orange to the filling. I cut the recipe in half, it makes a lot. I have also made it in a baking dish without the orange cups. One thing to note, if you have leftovers take it out of the orange cups. Leaving it in will make it bitter.

Fantastic! I have never reviewed a recipe before but this was so easy and yummy! Huge hit at Thanksgiving and now making again for Chtistmas eve dinner by request. I don't mind the time that the yams take in the microwave, it gives me time to put the rest of the ingredients in the bowl and juice the oranges. I did adjust a few things based on other reviews: I juice the oranges instead of scooping the pulp. Then I put about 2 Tbsp of fresh squeezed juice in the yam mixture. I add a bit of cinnamon as well. I use mini- marshmallows instead of the creme. It is all delicious and so easy. Presentation is u and unique and appealing.

Absolutely amazing! This was one of the hits at our Thanksgiving get-together. I used 4 medium-large yams and an immersion blender to puree the yams/fluff/butter/syrup mixture. Scooping out the oranges definitely takes time, but this allows time for the microwaved yams to cool. I plan to make this again for our future holiday dinners.

I've made this for several Thanksgivings and it's always a hit. I suggest preping the orange cups a day or two in advance and storing them in plastic as cleaning them out is quite time consuming. I also like to alternate a streusel topping with the marshmellow creme. Mix 1/2 c flour, 1/2 c chopped pecans, 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 stick melted butter and sprinkle on top before baking.

I made this at Thanksgiving and it was a hit! I made the filling the day before and would consider adding a bit of orange juice to the filling. Would recommend something for scooping out the orange but taste was delicious. Used mini marshmallows.

This is delicious!! Easy to make, full of flavor, elegant in presentation. Served during Thanksgiving and no leftovers. Suggest use 2 large eggs instead and added pinch of fresh ground cinnamon. I used Kraft Jet-Puffed marshmallow creme under broiler for 5 minutes to brown tops slightly. Otherwise, as recipe suggests, add dollop of creme and bake 30 minutes-this is messy, creme melts. I will now incorporate this as an annual side dish to serve.

Amazingly successful recipe, made for Thanksgiving. I made ahead, freezing the nested orange cups until a couple of hours before baking. My adjustments to the recipe were to skip the eggs, add some brandy, orange juice, and cardamom. I didn't add marshmallow cream, just threw in a handful of mini marshmallows. I did use the microwave, and though it's time consuming, got a lot of other holiday prep done at the same time. I used regular sized oranges, which made for a fairly dainty size portion, with plenty of plain yams in a serving dish on the side. My guests raved.

This is the perfect Thanksgiving yam recipe. Not overly sweet if you add fresh-squeezed orange juice into the mix and zest on top, as many others have suggested. I can see why so many love it; I do not hesitate to give it the full four forks! I'll make it again and again.

I made this for a Thanksgiving potluck and it was a hit. Both flavor and presentation were wonderful. I do agree with the cook who wrote that the marshmellow creme dollop is a bit messy. Best to wait until the cups are completely cool, then make a little dent in the center to create a resovoir for the creme.

This is my favorite holiday recipe. It always gets rave reviews. The microwaving often takes longer depending on the size of the yams. I add a splash of orange juice to help bring out the flavor of the oranges. This is a wonderful recipe!

I have made these for the last five years at the holidays. Yes, it is a lot of work but really, really worth it. Everyone looks forward to them. I have also, over the years, instead of microwaving them, I just bake them and they are all done at the same time and you can mash together. Great dish!

I have been making this recipe since it came out in 2001. By popular demand I must make it at both Thanksgiving and Christmas. I use mini marshmallows instead of creme (the marshmallow creme melts too fast) and toast my pecans with brown sugar and butter, and make enough to top my spinach salad with raspberries and bacon. Big hit!

Definitely cook yams on stove in water rather than in microwave to save much time. Wonderful recipe and presentation

Every friend and family member who has tasted this recipe absolutely raves about it. I've made it the last 4 Thanksgivings by unanimous request. I make double the recipe and am LUCKY if I get any leftovers. Baking the mixture in a casserole dish instead of the cups is just as tastey and easier. I do this and grate orange zest over the yams and spread thick marshmallow creme on top.

This was so great! The only thing I will do next time is lighten up on the syrup, especially if the yams are particularly sweet, and make sure not to fill the oranges too full because the tops puff up in the oven.

I have made this every Thanksgiving for several years. Everyone raves about them, and I have to agree that this recipe is one of my favorites. I love how the sweet creamy filling has just a hint of orange flavor for a twist. These always look beautiful too, so they're great for a special occasion.

I loved this recipe. I used a juicer to remove the inside of the oranges. Just don't go all the way down to the pith or it will be bitter. I added 6 tbsp of praline syrup w/pecans, saving the pecans as decoration for the top. I also added 2-3 tbsp of burbon which gave a different and exciting taste to the yams. Am making it again this thanksgiving due to unanimous request.

I make this dish as described but do not use the orange cups. I bake it in a casserole dish. It's a little too sweet for some but most love the flavor and texture, especially the kids.

Marshmallow creme scares me, so I used the orange cups from this recipe and filled them with "orange flavored sweet potatoes with oatmeal cookie topping" (also on this website, Gourmet, November 1994). The orange juice and marmalade are a nice complement to the orange cups. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving for those that like yams. For some servings, we omitted the orange cups and used creme brulee cups instead. It saves on the cost and time, and also looks nice.

I omitted the marshmellow cream since I was looking to make a less sweet yam dish. For years I've whipped my yams with orange juice and maple syrup. For those of you that thought it was tough to scrape the oranges out here is what I do. I use a juicer for the oranges and then toss the "shells" in the freezer for later use with this recipe.

Amazing! With one try, this dish became an instant favorite and definite must at every Thanksgiving! Also incredible because the size is small, one for each person is perfect. Just right, not too much.

This dish is wonerful, and the presentation is great. I soooo dislike having sweet dishes mingle with my mashed potatoes and gravy--this solves that. However, the oranges were very difficult to clean out and were a bit flimsy when baked. Last year I switched to mini pumpkins instead and they were easier to scrape out, sturdier and a prettier!!

I AM making this recipe again. Made it in 2001 and had to search hard to find this recipe again. I had the MOST picky eaters love this and come back for more. Absolutely love it - it is my favorite!

What did others do to keep the bitter of the orange from flavoring the sweet potato? These looked gorgeous, and the top part was delicious, but no one got past that!

I loved this and so did everyone who tried it. It was like a dessert. I found scooping out the oranges a pain though. I had alot of extra puree, so I put it in an 8 inch square pan, sprinkled on marshmellows and pecans and it was great. One bad thing is that when eating leftovers, it becomes bitter from the white bitter part of the orange.

CAN BE MADE AHEAD WHICH I LIKED AND HAS AN IMPRESSIVE PRESENTATION. I JUICED THE ORANGE HALVES FOR AN EASY WAY TO MAKE THE SHELLS AND WE HAD JUICE FOR BREAKFAST.

I've made this recipe before and absolutely loved it. This time I did not use marshmallow creme. I put in a little brown sugar and 3-4 Tbs of bourbon! Also, I added pieces of the orange that were scooped out and some of the juice. Also, I placed several mini marshmallows on top of the potato during the entire baking time and they turned out just fine. I was making this for 8 people and allowed 1 potato for each person which was to much puree. Everyone raved about this dish. We are finishing the leftover puree tonight!

I prefer a point system when rating a recipe and had to give this recipe a 3 out of 4 because it was not perfect. I do however give it 90 points out of 100. This recipe calls for extra work (hollowing out the oranges) that helps with the presentation and adds some additional flavor to the recipe. I don't like to microwave vegetables, but decided to do it anyway. It worked perfectly; the yams came out soft and ready to be scooped out. Yams and sweet potatoes are kind of pasty tasting and I had hoped that the addition of marshmallow cream, butter, maple syrup, and eggs would have of reduced this pasty texture. It reduced the pastiness some, but not to the degree that I had hoped for. I am going to make this again, but I think I'll add some heavy cream to loosen up the texture a bit more.

I prepare the orange cups about a week or so prior, stack them and freeze (thaw before filling). Use any sweet potato puree filling (preferable using orange juice) prepared the day before and bake as instructed in this recipe. A special inexpensive little gizmo meant for coring tomatoes makes short work of scooping out the orange flesh. The great presentation always impresses!

Rating: 1
Got a day to make this? This is one instance when the recipe should NOT be followed. Microwaving yams takes forever not 30 minutes as the recipe indicates. Do yourself a favour. Dice the pieces & boil them with a little water until soft. Then continue the recipe as indicated. Upside - everyone loved the taste. Downside - preparation as recommended will have you fuming!

I made this dish for my New Year Eve party,and boy was this a hit. Everyone devoured them. My husband almost missed getting one. He's not really a yam lover but was asking for more the next day. My girlfriend said this was the best of the best mashed yams she had. I also but the dollop of marshmallow creame the last 5 minutes so it wouldn't burn.

Originally, I prepared this dish for Christmas dinner. The family was duly impressed with the gorgeous presentation and wonderful flavor. Since then, I've made the yams, sans oranges, at least six more times. We're addicted! Occasionally, I go a little heavier on the marshmallow and use it as dessert. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

My Christmas guests were really impressed with the whole nine yards of this recipe - they loved the presentation and devoured them without leaving any behind. It's a truly unique way to prepare yams for company, and is now one of my favorite yam/sweet potato recipes!

Finally a new idea on how to serve yams. You can use canned yams and it turns out just as nice and makes the cooks job a little easier and no one will know the difference. I made them the night before. They turned out great and my guests thought I was brilliant. A word to the wise the final dollop of marshmallow is best left to be added at the last possible moment or it melts everywhere. I also used my brulee torch to lightly brown the marshmallow cream.

These were excellent! What an elegant way to serve this classic Thanksgiving side dish. I never imagined I'd be using marshmallow creme, but this certainly was a treat. I made too many and have been eating them leftover for the past few days and they are just as good as they were the first day. I'll definitely add this to my Thanksgiving menu in the future!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit- we used fresh oranges off our tree. A hint- take the fruit out of the cups the day before and keep the cups in the fridge, way too much work on turkey day. Also add orange zest to the potatoes. I had maple extract instead of syrup and that helped to cut the sweetness-also had a bit of pumpkin left and added that as well. Will make again w/ a pork roast.

I made these for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved them. I made them in a casserole dish after reading in a previous review that leftovers in the orange cups were bitter. I'm glad I did, because these yams were great the next day!

I normally don't like yams -- but on Thanksgiving I coudn't get enough of these!! The orange cups really made the dish -- it gave them the slight orange flavor, plus made it nice addition to the holiday plate (you can get too many dollops on a plate, and it was nice to have something in a more defined shape). This is one of our new traditions!

This was absolutely divine. I used a whole jar of marshmallow creme in the mix, then added the "dollop" on top from the second jar. Didn't have pecans so at the last minute sprinkled some unsalted chopped macadamia nuts. Delish!

Mashed Yams with Marshmallows is one of my wife's favorite comfort foods; I needed her permission to substitute these. We have no regrets and have a new traditional dish

Rating: 3
This was a winner, with qualifications. We made it in a casserole dish, and added orange zest, as the orange cups were too time consuming. The marshmallow cream does not heat well--add the dollops toward the end of the reheating state so they don't brown! We all thought it was a little too sweet, but will try again with less marshmallow, but the same amount of maple syrup (for that nice maple flavor). The orange zest was a nice counterpoint to the sweet, and we will increase the amount used next time. A pleasant change from your averaged mashed yams/sweet potatoes with those marshmallows on top!

Wonderful and fun idea for Thanksgiving. Thought the marshmallows would make too sweet, but it was perfect. I chopped my pecans and folded in as well as topped with two halves before baking. Will make a nice presentation on the plate. Would certainly make again. BARBARA, TRY THEM! Luv, Sister Carol

Wow! what a great new option for Thanksgiving! I made these last weekend and they were delicious. Being from the south, I added a little extra maple syrup (real) and marshmallow creme to make them sweeter. By placing the sweet potato mixture in the orange cups, the final product has a faint orange taste which is divine. A couple of notes, the marshmallow creme got a little brown in the oven, so next time I plan to go ahead and put the pecan halves in and halfway through baking, I will dollop the marshmallow creme on top. Also, do not fill them and let them sit in the refrigerator. I had one left over and heated it up two days later in the microwave and the bitterness of the orange peel has permeated through the sweet potato making it unedible. This is a great Thanksgiving recipe!
