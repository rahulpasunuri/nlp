This has been a staple in our home sine it was published in 1994. A family favorite!

I used this recipe as a base to sort of build my own. I didn't use any chilis and subbed stale corn bread and white dinner rolls, cubed. I also diced up some orange and red bell peppers. This went great with my Mexican-themed Thanksgiving but is definitely something I would make again.

It was a delicious and easy recipe. Perfect for children as it consists of their favorite ingredient- corn.

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner for 11 people and almost doubled the recipe. In the end I'm glad I didn't as people were not crazy about it. I thought for sure my husband would love it as corn bread and cilantro are two of his favorite foods. The Fritos seem to give the dish an almost burnt taste and to me, the corn flavor is too strong. I much prefer other stuffing recipes.

This dish was a huge hit! I was a little worried because my family has a pretty traditional palate but they loved it. We cheated by using store bought corn bread but it still was delicious. Definitely a keeper.

I try to make a different stuffing each Thanksgiving and after an extensive search I decided to try this one. The sausage and the pecans were an interesting addition. The stuffing was enjoyed by everyone. I did take the advise of adding additional stuffing to mellow it out.

Even without the poblanos which I couldn't find, this stuffing was awesome! Just try it!

This is a great, tasty recipe. Very colorful, too. Excellent flavor. I don't think I changed a thing. Served it with turkey to guests who had never had cornbread stuffing in their lives. Ate ever drop. The regular buttermilk cornbread recipe is one of the best I've made.

Excellent! I served it with the Achiote Butter Basted Turkey and Ancho Chili Gravy. There wasn't any stuffing leftover! Next time I'll double the recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was really wonderful. I made the buttermilk corn bread recipe and it made this even more special. The flavors of the chiles and corn are suttle, not over-powering for those who might not be chile lovers. I'll be making this again and again.

I'm reviewing this second hand - my mother makes it and it is fabulous! I never thought we would give up traditional dressing, but this is a family favorite.
