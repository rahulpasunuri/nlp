Aw man, was this good! Disclaimer: I've never had a Reuben before, so I had nothing to compare it to. But it was just a mouth-watering good sandwich. I did everything as described. Since I didn't see the recipe for Russian Dressing, I looked online and found one for the Russian Tea Room's recipe. It was particularly complex (and made A LOT) but I'll know to make less of it next time.

About once a year I have a craving for a Reuben, in my case I made a Rachel because I used pastrami. Went on internet & found recipe for Russian dressing, mayo, ketchup, minced onion & horseradish. Absolutely delicious! The deli sandwiches use too much meat for me.

I would so NOT recommend using the George Foreman grill. I tried it, with less than stellar results. The pan method, as directed, is much better. Also, I layered the corned beef and cheese, instead of clumping them individually. I made the Russian Reuben's Dressing recipe but misread it and only used 1/4 cup of mayo; I liked it that way.

We loved your Reuben Sandwich recipe. We live in Cebu, Philippines. We had to substitute some of the ingredient not found here in the Philippines. We used imported Libby's canned chunky style corn beef, Thousand Island dressing, California sour dough bread. Even with the substitute ingredients, it was still delicious. I am an American living in the Philippines and my wife is a Filipina, my wife loved the Reuben sandwich also. Thanks for sharing these recipes on line for us Americans living abroad. The only way to get genuine American foods in the Philippines is to look in the imported section of the supermarket for the ingredients and then make it yourself. Thanks Again, We really appreciate your web site. David Melton

If you substitute turkey for corned beef and coleslaw for sauerkraut you should not be reviewing a Reuben Sandwich recipe.

This was a great sandwich...I love that it wasn't overstuffed like so many deli sandwiches seem to be. I made the Russian dressing provided by another reviewer, and it was SOOO good! Who doesn't love a good Reuben?

Delicious! Hard to find proper rye bread in London (and proper Thousand Island let alone Russian dressing) but I improvised. Well worth the extra steps and doing it just as recommended. Next time I may attempt to make the dressing per the recipes from other users.

Good sandwich. My husband loved them and I thought they were good. I like them even better made with sharp white cheddar cheese - just a personal preference.

These were delicious. Perhaps this was my most elaborate sandwich making endeavor because we brined our own brisket for 8 days to make our own corn beef (according to this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Homemade-Irish-Corned-Beef-and-Vegetables-241623 ) We also make a batch of naturally fermented saurkraut and two loaves of marbled rye bread. We used comte cheese and toasted the sandwiches on a hot griddle, pressed with a cast iron pot on top, panini style. Lots of work, but it was a fun project. Everyone loved these!

Had this for lunch and it was delicious. I used turkey instead of corned beef, thousand island instead of russian, and coleslaw instead of sauerkraut. I know those substitutions wouldn't satisfy a purist, but it came out delicious nonetheless. The most helpful part of this recipe were the instructions for frying -- buttering the bread and starting in a cold pan, and then turning the heat to medium-low, really allows you to control the browning of the sandwich.

Thanks for the Russian Dressing recipe below. Does anyone really need to know how to assemble pre-made Reuben parts? Probably not, I searched for Russian dressing and this sandwich came up with no link for the dressing. Epicurious - please put a link in for the dressing. Not rating it as I haven't made it yet, but know I will like it, how can you go wrong with great ingredients?

What makes this recipe is the Russian Dressing. It is the ONLY way to have a Rueben, Thousand Island doesn't compare. I have made this many times always with rave reviews. It's even better if you buy the corned beef brisket and cook it according to the directions. Out of this world!

Let's try this again! I have the recipe for the dressing from when this site was easier to use. Here goes: 1/2 c. Mayonaise, 1 T. ketchup, 1t. grated onion, 1/2 t. horseradish, 1/4 t. worcestershire sauce, 1 T. parsley. Hope this helps!

HERE'S THE DRESSING RECIPE!! 1/2 c. mayonaise, 1 T. Ketchup, 1 t. grated onion, 1/2 t. horseradish, 1/4 t. worcestershire sauce, 1 T. parsley. This is from this site when it was easier to use.

Made this last night. Found the Russian dressing recipe at www.globalgourmet.com. Very tasty.

This recipe stated "see tester's notes for Reuben's Russian Dressing" but when I clicked on the link, there was no Russian dressing recipe to be found. So, I used my own freshly made Thousand Island dressing. I rinsed & drained the sauerkraut, which eliminated the harsh sourness that sauerkraut usually has. The last time I made them, I grilled the Reubens on a George grill. Unfortunately, this recipe didn't tell me anything I didn't already know, and they were nothing to write home about. Sorry.

This was excellent! However, I used tofu slices instead of corned beef (about 1/4 thick). Also couldn't find Russian dressing, used a Miso curry sauce instead. I can't stop eating these sandwiches.

Great recipe, but I'll bet it'd be even better with the Russian Dressing - but somehow I cannot "click" on tester's notes and get it. Does epi have issues with Macs?

Oh my this is a wonderful sandwich. I made mine on the George Forman Grill as others had mentioned. I put the bread and ingrediants on with the grill off, then plugged it in, so the sides would cook evenly. I also put some weight on the top of it after cooking for a while, just in case. I dont even like Sauerkraute, but am starting to like it more and more, and this sandwich makes me almost love it! what a great tasting Sandwich. OH, I used thousand Island dressing from a bottle, and it was still very good, I cannot wait to try the Russian dressing listed.

I'd love to try this recipe, but can't find the directions for Reuben's Russian Dressing - can anyone help? Thanks!

I like to grill this up with the meat and cheese, then put deli cole slaw and Russian dressing on immediately afterward, as I love the hot/cold textures.

Great authentic recipe. I started it in a skillet to get it all hot and browned, then stuck in my panini press to compress it and melt the cheese. Couple things I'd do different next time: use a different russian dressing recipe...this one is too basic, too much mayo. Also...I would use less butter, and perhaps quickly fry up the shaved meat before putting it on the sandwich to get it nice and hot and flavourful. But...best recipe I've come across yet for Reuben Sandwich.

It's a great recipe, especially with the George Foreman Grill, but the recipe originated in Omaha, Nebraska.

Love these sandwiches. I put mine on the George Forman grill.

Thank you so much for the wonderful dressing recipe. I have been trying to duplicatei t for years.. I feel that Thousand Island dressingis the bane of Reuben sandwiches nowdays and I refuse to eat any except those I make myself.

The ultimate grilled sandwich. The combination of flavours surprises people who normally don't like saurkraut, rye bread or Swiss cheese. Yum!

We loved this recipe. I used a high-quality bottled thousand island dressing and it was great. Next time I'll make the Russian dressing. Even my fiance enjoyed it and he usually doesn't like sauerkraut, rye bread, or the dressing.

Sure glad I bought a Villaware panini press, as this works perfect for these and many more, and this is really good. *Make the sauce from the notes*

Very yummy! I used a firm, thin cottage wheat bread (hubby doesn't like rye), Paul Newman's 1,000 island dressing, havariti cheese and made it on my panini press. Glad I made 2 for each guy..they gobbled them up.

I love this sandwich. A trick I learned way back - drain the sauerkraut well and mix the dressing with it. Very easy assembly if your doing several sandwiches!

Excellent and very easy, I used pumpernickle bread... I love the assembly and the results were amazing. Even though I would know how to make these without a recipe it was nice to learn an easier way to assemble.

YUMMY! Reading the recipe brought me back to my childhood in the city. Warning! Don't go to a supermarket or grocery and buy the glutenous glop that passes for rye bread in the "bakery section". Take a couple of extra minutes and find a bakery that makes its own rye or pumpernickle. You'll be glad you did!
