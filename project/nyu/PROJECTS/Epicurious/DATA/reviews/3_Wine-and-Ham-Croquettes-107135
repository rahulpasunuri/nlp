Forgot to say that I increased the amount of ham to 2 cups.

This recipe is easy to jazz up. I added 2 tbsp stone ground dijon mustard, some red pepper flakes, 1/4 c Parmesan as one of the other reviewers suggested. Also used gluten free flour. Drizzled the croquettes with butter and baked on parchment paper. A keeper.

Right, I made some alterations to this recipe and it was delicious. First, use chorizo instead of serrano. Add some grated parmesan (about 50g or so), and a small amount of smoked paprika.

Not a bad ham croquette recipe but I found it a bit bland. I added 2 tablespoons of maple syrup, a teaspoon of cinammon and a small can of diced pineapple chunks which made all the difference!

Absolutely forgetable. Basically this is a recipe for deep fat fried roux with flecks of ham, and that's exactly how it tastes.

I loved this recipe, but it does need some doctoring. Delete the wine completely and make sure the oil is nice and hot. I've made them for 2 parties and they've been a success each time.

Has anybody tried freezing these?

Has anybody tried freezing these? I'd like to serve them at a party but I'd rather make them ahead of time rather than spend all evening in the kitchen when my guests are here.

These little croquettes are packed with a delicious savory flavor that kept my guests asking for more all night! I made them for a tapas party and used a pinot grigio for the wine so it wouldn't compete with the saltiness of the ham. I also made my own breadcrumbs since I don't have an Asian market near me - just use day old bread, toast in an oven and grate on the coarse side of a cheese grater. This is truly a recipe you'll want to make again and again!

I made this recipe for 100 people... they amazed with the taste and everything...i suggest this recipe could have the four forks!

These were a hit at a dinner party. I tested a few in my oil before cooking the whole batch. Once the oil was hot enough, the croquettes came out light & flavorful - not greasy at all.

My father, a Spaniard, used to make croquettes for us so I was so pleased that I finally put my hands on the recipe. I was a bit disappointed with the outcome. However, I modified it a bit and they tasted exactly as my dad used to make them. Delete the wine completely and and yuo can substitute the ham for chicken or ground beef. The modified version rates a "4".

Was disappointed. The recipe sounded much better than it tasted. Too much wine flavor overbalanced everything else. Also, I used proscuitto which is not as salty as serrano, and maybe that contributed to the blandness of the dish. Will make again only with lots of adjustments.

I made this for the first time this weekend as part of an appetizer tray for a small party at my home. In a word: fabulous! I was terribly worried that it would be greasy, but the crust was crisp and delicate, and the filling was warm and soft. Absolutely delectable. One suggestion- I added an additional 3Tbs more milk than is called for, and found the results to be just right. I will certainly make this again.

Maybe it was rushed, but these were greasy and not so great. Sound better than they taste.

I have a question for all you great cooks out there---I'd like to serve these as an appetizer at a party, do they need to be dipped into some kind of sauce??? If yes, any suggestions? Thanks for the help...

I didn't make this recipe yet, but if they have anything to do with the croquettes I tasted in Spain, so you shoul try, 'cause they are wonderful, and I had them several times, they are unforgetable.

Panko crumbs are used because they are very light and delicate. Very few bakeries in the U.S. provide the bread to duplicate the crumbs you can make in Eurpope with their stale bread.

I'm sorry to pile on after all the comments about how reviews should only be from those who have made the recipe, but honestly, why would a "classic Spanish dish" call for Japanese breadcrumbs? That is just silly. Anyone have any idea what they use in Spain?

To answer the question for the cook who was worried about the amount of ham,the recipe is correct. You are making a variaion on a basic white sauce with ham and wine flavoring. Once chilled it will be thick enough to shape and cook as croquettes. Hope that helps.

I'd love to try this recipe, but certainly you would need more than 1/2 cup of chopped ham to go with the rest of the ingredients. Anyone know the correct amount?

This recipe was delicous and perfect even for my low-carb diet. Our restaurant will love them. Thank you.
