I haven't made it but "purchased" just means factory-peeled carrots (since baby carrots are really just regular carrots that have been shaved down, and I assume they don't want you to try do so at home).

Already peeled carrots.

I don't understand the ingredient "purchased peeled baby carrots." As opposed to those other vegetables you stole, I guess?

I do not recommend this dish. The orange-sherry sauce clashes horribly with the vegetables! It over powers the veggies and leaves a sour taste in your mouth. Neither me or my husband liked it although luckily the dog thought it was tasty.
