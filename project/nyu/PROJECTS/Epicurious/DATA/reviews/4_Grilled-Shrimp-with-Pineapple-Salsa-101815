I love this salsa. I serve it with my own lemon shrimp. Very tasty, party impressive. I serve this often.

This salsa is delicious. I have had fruit salsas many times, but grilling the pineapple makes a world of difference. This was so quick and easy, and nice and healthy. I added chili paste and garlic to the shrimp marinade to give it some more flavor. Overall, a nice simple and fun recipe.

So delicious. The salsa is excellent, alone or with the shrimp. I put the shrimp and salsa on brown rice and added a mini side green salad with a sprinkle of feta cheese - salty complimented the sweet pineapple perfectly.

The pineapple salsa is absolutely terrific! It is so good that my guests wanted more than I had made. The shrimp marinade was pretty ineffectual and when I make this next time I'll use a different marinade for the shrimp; nothing that would overpower the salsa but as it was the shrimp was less than inspiring.

This is a fast dish, but I think you should marinate the shrimp a bit longer (don't forget the salt/pepper on the shrimp like we did!). We would have cut the pineapple into smaller pieces and used more jalapenos for more spice. Perhaps making the salsa ahead would allow the overall flavor to congeal more as opposed to tasting the individual flavors...I am definitely going to try this one again!

The pineapple salsa was really delicious. But I have to admit I tweaked the dish quite a bit according to my whims...Made fusion inspired risotto cakes to serve alongside (flavored with soy peanuts and thai chili sauce) Yeah, they sound unorthodox but were seriously good. I also added coconut to the shrimp and pan seared rather than grilled. This meal was a killer combination and one of the best I've cooked in a long while. Bonus points for being fresh & healthy!

The salsa was awesome! I didn't make the shrimp, just the salsa and served it with grilled Ahi Tuna. I also added some garlic. This is a definite keeper!

Awesome recipe. Was the hit of our summer BBQ.

This dish was the hit of our Hawaiian Party. Before I could get the shrimp to the table most of the salsa had been consumed with tortilla chips! I had to hide the remainder of the salso to serve with the shrimp.

I only made the pineapple salsa from this recipe. I served it on jerk pork chops with sweet potato fries...YUMMY. The salsa is excellent. It's very fresh. I also followed the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the onions. I would also cut back on the pepper next time.

I didn't use this shrimp recipe, just the salsa recipe. I agree with other raters, cut down considerably on the red onion and mince it finely. I used 1/4 cup and it was plenty.

This is a great recipe. I made this for a group of friends over the weekend - everyone loved it. The pineapple salsa had a wonderful flavor that complimented the shrimp. As suggested by others, I reduced the amount of red onion to 1/4 cup and I made it the night before so the flavors had a time to blend together. Also added some garlic to the marinade. I will definitely make this recipe again.

The pineapple salsa was the best part. Fresh!

Delicious. I love grilled pineapple, and this dish works great as salad or appetizer. Recommend finely chopping the jalapeno and letting the salsa flavors blend a little longer before serving.

The salsa is wonderful on this, it would be great with rice and chicken too. I did reduce the red onion and cilantro a bit based on other reviews, I thought it was perfect.

There was a little bit too much cilantro in the salsa.

Absolutely skip the skewers and use a grill wok for the shrimp, and use a CHARCOAL grill, or there will be little flavor to the shrimp. Charcoal adds such a nice smoky flavor to the shrimp and pineapple. The salsa is better with extra jalapenos and MORE cilantro, not less, but go easy on the onion.

Salsa was good, shrimp was tasteless. I would make the salsa again, but there are far better ways to cook shrimp...

This was very good, but not outstanding. I thought the shrimp were a little bland, even though I added minced garlic as suggested; it still needed more kick. The salsa was great, but I made it 1 day ahead and I should have let it come to room temperature first instead of serving it cold. I reduced the cilantro and red onion to 1/4 cup each and added chopped avocado just before serving. The salsa was also great with grilled quesadillas. I will make this again, but add something more to the marinade.

A regular request from family & friends - we all LOVE it! I skip the skewers and flip the shrimp in a BBQ grilling pan which further simplifies the process. More jalepeno for us too, but we like things spicy.

Perfect for a summer dinner---and soooo easy. The family and guests raved--especially the pineapple-addicted father-in-law. Shrimp were very easy to prepare and were enjoyed by all. Followed other reviewers' advice--minced salsa ingredients and kept onion and cilantro quantities down. Perfect. We scraped the bowl clean. Would be good, too, with other things--e.g., chicken, pork.

This was wonderful! The pineapple salsa is a great accompaniment to any seafood dish if made properly. Be sure to finely mince your red onion; I used about a 1/2 cup. Also, don't add any more cilantro than called for. The recipe calls for 1/2 pineapple cut into 12 slices; to get 12 slices at 1/2 inch thick, I needed a full pineapple. And be sure to use fresh pineapple, not canned. We liked this recipe so much, we grilled fresh tuna the next night to have with the salsa. It was fantastic!

We were looking for a simple recipe for dinner and chose this, it was very easy to make. The only deviations I made was to add fresh garlic to the grilling mixture to add some flavor, cut the pineapple into very small chunks so not to dwarf the other salsa ingredients, and added more Jalapeño for my taste. The meal was great, I had some Knorr brand lemon and jasmine rice and Santa Margherita Pinot Grigio on hand. which went perfectly with the meal! My guest Loved it, I will make this again!

If you cut back the red onion to 1/4 cup and finely mince it, this is a really good dish. To make up for the lesser amount of onion, I added a half diced avacado and a half diced nectarine I had left over from the day before. REally good. Also, I grilled the pineapple in wedges instead of rings for easier turning, and the leftovers we had had for dessert (don't salt & pepper them before cooking) with Hagen Daz caramel ice cream. Wow.

Yuck! I made the salsa to serve w/ pork, and I couldn't even serve it! It tasted like one big raw onion! I even used less than the recipie called for. I must have used an unusually strong onion. It was so bad, that my husband asked me to take it off of the appetizer spread for a party, b/c he was afraid it would stink up the house!

Outstanding! I've made this salsa three times in the past week -- since discovering it for my Valentine's Day dinner. (I was in charge of the appetizer, salad, and dessert.) Unfortunately, the shrimp was a bit overcooked (my fault), but the salsa made up for it. I added a squeeze or two of lime, as well as one third of a Poblano pepper, coarsely chopped. (My dessert was the Double Chocolate Torte, also found on epicurious.com... TO DIE FOR!)

I put too much cilantro in my salsa, but it turned out very good- a taste of the Carribbean! Would make a great appetizer for a coucktail party

Each of the component parts were really good and easy to make. I think I put a little too much jalapeno in the salsa and it kind of overwhelmed the shrimp. Next time I think I'll serve it with pork. The shrimp stands alone!

This was an easy dish to prepare and very tasty. I made the salsa the day ahead (next time I might add a bit more jalapeno). I served the shrimp with a 4oz tenderloin and coconut rice. The flavors blended very well.

OH MY GOD!!! This was soooooooo good!! It was really easy and delicious! I made yellow rice as a side dish and it went together perfectly. My husband went on about it all through dinner and he rarely raves. We're going on vacation and are going to make this one for sure!!
