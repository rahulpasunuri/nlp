Love making my own ricotta. Will never buy it again. Have made this with goat's milk, too. I use vinegar instead of lemon juice. The acidity is more consistent and I always have it handy. That's much more salt than I'd use. One advantage of making your own ricotta is controlling the salt, and we need to limit whenever we can. Great recipe. Highly recommended.

I love this one. I live in the woods and tend to make due with what I have on hand. Half a block of cream cheese instead of cream, made a calzone that was simply awsome. Thank you.

This may not be everyone's bag but you can and should use the whey for other things. It is full of protein and has no fat and can be used in smoothies or in place of milk on cereal, etc. It definitely has its own taste but is not bad by any means.

Definitely give this a try! It is easy and fun, and the ricotta is moist and flavorful, not dry and chalky like store bought. I used the entire amount in a large lasagna, and it was great. I dried mine a bit more with paper towels, just to make sure the lasagna didn't get watery. Delicious!

After reviewing this recipe, I read further on back in the reviews...This isn't really a forum for "who's the smartest foodie" or "who knows the most about the origins of particular recipes". If you have constructive critism, we all want your input, if you can offer ways to make the recipe work better, we want that too....no one really cares about how intelligent YOU come across.

This recipe is simple, fresh and a better consistancy for cooking then ricotta made with buttermilk. It is easily combined with cream cheese to make a smoother stuffing for lasagna, etc., and is great on it's own served on crackers drizzled with honey or sprinkled with herbs and cracked black pepper.

i am cow's milk intolerant and i'm trying to find substitution for the cream in this recipe, has anybody tried that before? any suggestion? i bought goat's milk to try this recipe, and i have soja cream but i don;t think that can be cooked.thanks.

I doubled this recipe and used an un-hemogenized, organic whole milk (purchased from Whole Foods - expensive, yes, but I figured if the milk is the entire dish, I should treat it like I would meat or fish and buy the best I can). Although the recipe did not specify, I used kosher salt. Like another reviewer, I had to use a bit (not a lot) more lemon than the recipe called for and stirred for longer, but I think this very well may be b/c I doubled the recipe and sometimes "doubling" isn't truly accurate in cooking. I also rescued the cheese from draining after only about a minute b/c I wanted a softer, wetter product - so bear in mind what your desired texture is when considering how long to drain. The recipe's 1 hour instruction would likely result in a rather dry, spreadable product. Regardless, what resulted was like mana from heaven!! Pillowy, bright, with a beautiful texture and delicate, fresh flavor. I used this for an appetizer with a gorgeous baguette from a local bakery, marcona almonds and olives. I opted for simplicity, so i just scooped the ricotta into a shallow soup plate, 1/2 a grind of black pepper and a tiny bit of flat leaf parsley for color. So delicious. Also - for anyone out there who did a bit of reading before settling on this recipe - after making this, although I would give buttermilk or goat's milk a try (as called for by some recipes), I would never use white distilled vinegar in place of the lemon, which is called for by many recipes I read including Ina Garten's. The lemon really lent a springtime fresh taste -- the result wasn't lemony lemon, it was just garden fresh and bright. Perfect.

For flavor I give this four forks, but for yield I give it two so... it averages to three. Great taste, easy to do and reasonably convenient if I have whole fat milk and cream on hand, which I rarely do. So, I have to say it was a successful experiment but I will not do this again; 1 qt tubs of ricotta are cheaper at Costco (and really tasty; i cant really tell the difference) than the gallon of milk I bought for this purpose and there is a lot of waste. Not sure what I will do with this much whey and the yield of cheese was barely enough for a small lasagne.

I've tried a couple of ricotta recipes and this is the one I like best. I did have to add more lemon juice and stir longer but it finally formed a curd. I have heard that it will not work as well with ultra-pasteurized milk. So much better than what you buy at the grocery store, but it doesn't last very long!

Try using a chinois/bouillon strainer. It is worth its weight in gold. I use it constantly to strain my homemade yogurt for Greek yogurt and now I am using it for this delicious homemade ricotta. I purchased mine at Amazon for those interested. http://www.amazon.com/Matfer-17360- Exoglass-Bouillon- Strainer/dp/B00069ZUXW/ref=sr_1_1? ie=UTF8&qid=1327429388&sr=8-1

Every cook should try this at least once. Making homemade ricotta is a really fun activity, and almost ridiculously easy. Plus, you can also control the texture of the cheese when you make it yourself. Followed as written, this recipe produces a dry ricotta with large curds. If you stop heating at 190 degrees and only gently stir the milk when you add the lemon juice, you get a very smooth ricotta that is almost the consistency of cream cheese. That version takes quite a while to drain. The version that I've settled on has a half gallon of milk, a cup of cream, a generous teaspoon of salt, and a quarter cup of fresh squeezed and strained lemon juice. I like to stop heating and add the lemon juice at 200 degrees. The resulting curds are smaller than the commercial ricotta, but they drain fairly quickly and the finished cheese is very smooth and luxurious. If you can restrain yourself from eating half of it out of the strainer, my version produces about a pound and a quarter of cheese.

i've made this several times, and here are a few minor tweaks and observations: 1) use a nonstick pan. trust me. one of my best kitchen investments was for a large nonstick stock pot. 2) i recommend NOT bringing the milk to a boil. personally, i like a softer curd in my ricotta. if you add the lemon juice to a rolling boil, as indicated, you'll get much tighter, harder curds. but if you instead bring it to a very soft boil, right over a simmer, and THEN add the lemon juice, and patiently stir a few minutes until the milk solids have coagulated, the result is a very soft, large curd. tastier that way, though i imagine that there are some recipes where a harder curd might be desirable. anyway, you have control over the quality of the final curd. just stir and cook until the whey has separated. (you'll see a yellowish liquid sort of wring itself out of the curd. you'll know it's done when the whey is translucent.) 3) a new, clean, cotton diaper is the best way to strain this. no amount of cheesecloth will work. if you use a diaper, you don't need a fine sieve. just use a pasta drainer and a diaper. works like a charm.

I tried this recipe and unless my whole milk is not as whole as the authors was, I found very little yield. So... I went to the store and bought a litre of cream, poured out half of the milk and mixed the cream with the remaining milk, when it began to boil, I added a little vinegar and walla... the yield was 10 times what I had from the original recipe and just as tasty. I am pretty sure it would do the same if you just used water instead of milk but I haven't tried that. By the way, don't answer the phone while boiling the mixture unless you want a mess to clean up as well.

Look out! You'll never be satisfied with store bought ricotta again. I've been making this since the recipe first appeared in 2006. Now I'm spoiled rotten. Since I don't always have enough time or ingredients on hand to make this, I often have to buy grocery store ricotta. All I do is dream about how much better the dish would've been with this home made version. It's as fresh, bright and natural tasting as can be. No comparison whatsoever to the supermarket stuff. Plus, it's very quick and easy to make. Try it, but be ready to be transformed.

This recipe worked perfectly for me. I live in Taiwan and was able to find a 1857cc bottle of whole milk (fat at "3 or less"--no need to add calcium chloride), which is basically 2 quarts. Our lemons are spherical and green and yielded roughly a tablespoon or more each. The liquid coming out of the strainer/cloth was clear from the beginning, so I had the right equipment and it worked perfectly. Also, having lemon smell in the house is much more pleasant than having vinegar smell that many other recipes suggest. I highly recommend this recipe.

Confused, or just trying to one-up epicurious? "Ricotta cheese made exclusively from whey is called Ricotone; if milk is added to the whey or if the cheese is made entirely from milk it is called Ricotta," from the Dairy Foods Consulting web-site of Artisan Cheesemaker Peter Dixon, M.S. He sounds like he knows his stuff. Regardless, this is a nice recipe for the home cook with results well above anything you can buy at your typical grocery store; and takes minutes to make. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

This is the easiest, and best, ricotta recipe. The cream isn't necessary unless you want the extra richness. But don't throw out the whey! If you do bread baking it's great to replace the water. Freeze the extra for later use.

I'm confused. The english translation of ricotta is "recooked". Technically, ricotta is made (recooked) from the whey by-product of cheese production. Although this is a tasty and simple recipe, it's a recipe for paneer.

Excellent ricotta. Way better than what you buy in the store. I would recommend not stirring it much after adding the lemon juice. Stirring as much as the recipe says breaks up curds. Just stir the lemon juice in a little and simmer for 2 minutes to let the curds form.

This recipe sounded intimidating when I first read it but I quickly found out that this is a really easy recipe to make. I don't really understand how you could mess this one up, it seems idiot-proof. I didn't have a large sieve so I just lined a collander with the cheese cloth and that worked fine. The ricotta tastes so fresh and creamy and my guests were "wowed" when I told them that I made it myself. I will try a lower fat version and see if it can compete.

Another lower calorie version of ricotta is to heat 2 quarts of whole milk and 2 cups of buttermilk and a pinch of fresh nutmeg, stirring frequently, to 180 degrees. Scrape the bottom on the pan and the curd will rise. Keep the brew at 180 for 1 minute. Then drain through cheese cloth in a collander and stir in 1/4 cup fresh parmesan and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Hang the cheese in the cheese cloth for 15 minutes. There you have a scrumptious, lower calorie ricotta for use in any recipe.

This is one of those recipes that is a true revelation. Homemade ricotta is NOTHING like the wet, pasty, acrid stuff in the tub. It tastes like the fresh milk from which it's made....INCREDIBLE! Fresh ricotta is delicious made with whole milk/cream, and even with lowfat milk alone (note: the yield is lower with the low fat version, and the curd is drier, but it is still absolutely wonderful). Try using this in the ricotta cheesecake recipe on this sight, and PUT ON YOUR SEATBELTS as it just might knock you right out of your chair!

This is an interesting recipe since it has the primary product being the ricotta. I typically make ricotta when I am making another fresh cheese, reserving the whey, enhancing it slightly with more milk/cream and following the same process to get ricotta. "Ricotta" literally means "recooked" and is considered a "whey cheese" (cheese made from whey). This recipe yields considerably more cheese than you would typically get when using whey (since you're already taken one pass at removing the milk solids). Incidentally, if you allow this to drain longer (and place a weight on it to force out more liquid), you can use the resulting cheese as Indian paneer (used for palak paneer or saag paneer).

I made this yesterday and it was the easiest recipe to make. It was better than any store bought ricotta. Very creamy texture. I used a thermometer and waited until the temp of the milk reached 190 and then took the pan off the heat, poured in the lemon juice and put it back on the heat for about 1 minute. Drained the liquid and used it in a Pizza Dolce...this recipe is great for cannolli's but I would not drain it as much for lasagna.....excellent!!!
