Delicious, Nutritious, and Easy! I did not follow the recipe to the letter, but used the basic ingredients. After sauteeing some shallots and leeks I added the curry to taste. Then I added chicken broth, cubed squash, and carrot pieces-- again to taste. I pureed soup in blender and soup was ready in 30 minutes.My husband exclaimed "delicious soup." I added turmeric to my soup serving. Definitely a keeper!

This is my favorite receipe web site! I too added white wine, peper powder, roasted head of garlic and roasted the squash. My wife loved it!

Great soup, even without the frizzled leeks on top. Agree with previous reviewers about a touch more curry and a bit of garam masala. I also balanced with a little lemon at the end. Will definitely be making again!

Very simple, tasty-great for a snowy night. Frizzled leeks are great. Might add pepitas next time.

The thing I love about this recipe is that the curry flavour does not overpower the sweetness of the squash. The flavours are delicate and surprising. No heat in this curry!

This was a very delicious soup that our guests, my husband, our two-year-old twins and I really enjoyed. The frizzled leeks were amazing on top. The only thing I added was a swirl of cream in each individual bowl before garnishing with the leeks. Sooo delicious!

Very tasty soup, I have made this with a variety of different squash. Works well with vegetable broth as a vegetarian dish, or use vegetable oil too and make it completely vegan. Freezes very well.

We also roasted the squash and added more curry, but wasn't impressed with that. Decided to add about a teaspoon of sage which helped. Didn't like the leeks. Thought they were tough and greasy. Could be I didn't fry them right. Won't make this again.

Following the advice from the reviews, we roasted the squash before cubing it and added more curry powder (about 1 tbsp more; we didn't have garam masala) and it tasted great. Subtle but warm!

We've been making this recipe just about every year at Thanksgiving since it appeared in the magazine! A few minor tweaks over the years, as also suggested in some of the other reviews: if the oven is on some time in the days leading up to thanksgiving, I halve and roast the squash instead of cubing it (more for convenience than for flavor!). I do tend to add extra curry (or possibly a little nutmeg) when making it for the local crew, but we actually like the subtlety of the spicing for Thanksgiving, where there are some present who can't take much spice, and the flavors will compete with what follows. I usually use a relatively potent Malaysian curry powder, so the amount called for is plenty to yield a noticeable curry flavor. I do tend to add a splash of citrus to brighten the flavors. And finally, we've also discovered that the flavor changes considerably if you use veg stock instead of chicken. Usually I'm happy to sub, but in this case, I think it's a lot better with chicken stock. The soup definitely gets better if it sits a day, and I sometimes thin it with a little bit of buttermilk if necessary, on reheating.

I had a ton of veggies from my crop share that I needed to use and I found this recipe, which was perfect! I loved the recipe and read some reviews and made my own tweaks: roasted cubed squash w/ olive oil & maple syrup, s&p @ 400 for 25min. 1 1/2 TBS. curry powder (vs. 1 1/2 tsp. 3/4 c. white wine 1c. water (vs. 4c. water) My husband said the soup was "orgamic".

I didn't like this recipe at all and won't make it again. The flavor of the curried squash is completely overwhelmed by the flavor of the leeks for an overall flavor that just feels "off". The frizzled leeks idea is a total keeper, however.

I really enjoyed this soup and the fact that it is one of the few butternut squash soup recipes that doesn't involve the use of heavy cream-- but I did make a few adjustments. First, I roasted the butternut squash before adding it, used about 1 Tbsp each of garam masala powder and curry powder (the extra spice was definitely necessary), and also added a couple of Tbsps of maple syrup at the end to make it a little sweeter, which I thought was a great compliment to the curry flavor.

Rating: 4
Delicious!! Per the advice of some others, I added 1 Tbs of garam masala powder, and I agree with the others who recommended it - it really does add a lot of flavor. Don't pass up the frizzled leeks!

Rating: 4
Amazing recipe with a few pertinent tweaks: the spice amounts are VERY LOW (I opted for two Tbs of garam masala plus 2 Tbs of curry, lots of salt and lots of black pepper). I omitted the leeks. Also, as a vegetarian, I used veg broth as the soup base rather than the chicken. Paired this with a nice South African Shiraz but will try it next time around with a crisp white. Those who rated this low obviously spiced as suggested in the recipe, as that produces a bland product. Up the spices and you'll be a culinary hero with this one!

This soup was delicious. I roasted the squash before I added it to the soup, which I think added to the overall flavour. I put a little less water than the recipe called for, about 3 cups. The soup was definetely thick, but I liked it that way.

This is excellent soup. I did not do the frizzled leeks. Made me think of SnoopDog though.

Joining a CSA has given me more onion, leeks, and squash than I knew what to do with.. until I came across this recipe. This is hands down my favorite squash soup, even more than the butternut squash soup with red pepper puree. It's creamy without needing to add cream, and flavorful without being overpowering. The changes I made: - Generous olive oil instead of butter - 1 T yellow generic yellow curry - 1 t garam masala curry (substitute cumin and a sprinkle of cinnamon if you don't have garam masala) - 2/3 of a cup of white wine in place of the 4 cups of water (eliminating all the water concentrated the flavor much more) The frizzled leeks are worth the small amount of effort. Just cook them while the soup is simmering. I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as I did!

Rating: 4
Absolutely scrumptious! I did add a few minor changes. I split the curry between red curry paste(for the heat) and yellow madras...probably at a 2 to 1 ratio. I also added about 1 cup of plain yogurt. It was a hit when I took it work the next day for MY lunch!

I always like to do butternut squash soup at Thanksgiving. Always it is well received. This one even more so. I do agree it could use some awakening - more curry or as someone suggested, cayenne. Cannot agree with those who pooh-poohed the frizzled leeks. They add a very nice and flavorful touch and are not hard to prepare.

This was a great way to use leftover roasted squash, also saves peeling it, just scoop it out. I forgot to get extra leeks, so I fried shallots to crisp. I added a little cayenne pepper. I also added yogurt to my dish.

Use 2 tsp of curry powder and the Williams-Sonoma Organic Butternut Squash Puree and the soup will be finished in under an hour. The leeks are a nice addition, but also just fine with a dollop of crème fraiche and a sprinkling of cilantro.

Please don't skip the frizzled leeks, they make the soup! Beautiful flavor and texture. It was a hit in this house... For those of you living close to a Trader Joe's - you can buy precut butternut squash. With the added help of my immersion blender, I was done start to finish in 1/2 an hour. Can't wait to wow my foodie friends with this one--

More work than I expected, between peeling the squash (how do you peel squash with indentations?) and chopping a lot of leeks. Everybody liked, though, altho one eater, my 14-year old son, thought it was too mild. I'm thinking a touch of cayenne or Tabasco would help. Skipped the frizzled leeks (of course, given the previous reviews). Added creme fraiche & canned French fried onions; worked well. By the way, this butternut squash soup is green (because of the leeks, I guess)!

this was a delicious and soothing soup. it will be a great addition to the thanksgiving menu next week! i roasted a buttercup (kobacha?) squash instead- much better flavor and texture. i also increased the (madras) curry powder and added a dash of cayenne for heat. didn't make and didn't miss the 'frizzled leeks'.

I roasted the squash and although I frizzled leeks I think next time I'll do with out or frizzle shallots instead. Leftovers the next day were even better and did not miss the frizzled leeks.

Just made this for dinner tonight, like others, without the leeks. We loved it and can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow! Note: For those who found the soup too bland, I recommend buying new curry, preferably from an Indian supplier. We get ours in Little India (downtown NYC) and it's HOT!

I added some sage - about a tablespoon but next time I would add a bit more. I also added some cognac at the suggestion of one reviewer. I didn't think it added anything special. This is a very good and warming winter soup.

I love this recipe. I even got compliments from friends who are not big squash eaters. I added a dash of cayenne pepper - not too much, just enough to give it some zing. Turned out fabulous. I didn't make the frizzled leeks, but it doesn't need them. Also, good with a swirl of olive oil on top of the soup before serving.

Rating: 3
Made this for extended family, and everyone liked it. I even made the frizzled leeks -- I felt bad that so few people had tried them! My family definitely liked them, but I can certainly understand different opinions about whether they were worth the work. (Why are they called frizzled? I expected them to curl up, and they didn't.) My husband liked the added crunch. My son said they were good, but not as good as the spiced pumpkin seeds I've made to go with a different butternut squash soup. If you're one of those people who makes this soup often, I'd definitely try them to see what you think.

This is one of the best soups I've ever made! I have received nothing but compliments. Began making it about 5 years ago, I'm glad the site still has the recipe up. I'd like to try the frizzled leaks, but have always served it with tiny bruchette. Which adds a bit of crunch if you throw it in the soup.

Delicious. I was wary of combining sweet squash with a curry seasoning, but its great! I added about 1 Tbs of minced fresh sage and a couple of Tbs of brandy. RAVES from all dinner guests. Didn't bother with the leeks. I made it ahead and reheated it, and it thickened up quite a bit (kind of the consistency of baby food if you don't thin it a bit).

This is one of the best tasting soups I have ever had. It tastes like creamed curry and has a honey texture if made correctly. I have never added the frizzled leeks. I submitted this recipe to my daughter's college fall recipe contest and she won an award!! The guy who delivered our Xmas tree 2 years ago tasted it and loved it too.

What a nice autumn soup. I have to disagree with those who said don't bother frizzeling the leeks however... the salty onion taste mixes in really well with the soup which is kind of sweet. All of us kept reaching for more frizzled leeks so we could get a couple in every bite! I served this with the mushroom gruyere pastry from this site and everyone was very impressed with my gourmet-ness!

This was a simple and tasty soup to make. I "cheated" and bought pre-cut squash which made it even simpler! Highly recommend doing that if you can... Made it for my in-laws and husband before Thanksgiving and they couldn't stop talking about it... Will be making it again tonight for dinner...

Based on the reviews, I expected to love this soup, but was disappointed by the blandness. I added 2 tbsp of fresh ginger and several tsps of an Indian garlic curry paste to give it a kick. It finally ended up tasting nicely. Not sure if I'll make this again or not.

Delicious soup. Made this for Canadian Thanksgiving dinner (Oct. 14) and it was a hit. Very flavourful and nice texture. For a garnish, I used Feta cheese and chopped basil rather than the frizzled leeks.

With all the reviewers who didn't want to bother frizzling leeks, I can't believe no one has thought of the obvious, dirty-little-secret shortcut - canned french-fried onions. Elegant? No. Expedient? You bet. I always like something that adds a little texture to creamy soups and this does the trick with zero time investment.

I have made this recipe many times over the years and feel that it is a great winter soup. Many family members (from a French mother-in-law to Indian parents) love the blend of flavors.

A big success @ a Fall dinner party. I put a dollop of sour cream in the middle of each bowl and gave the soup some dimension by placing the leeks in the sour cream to stand up every which way. A big, "Wow!" came from all of my guests and not a drop was left in a single bowl.
