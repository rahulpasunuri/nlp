The batter is much too salty and the brine made the meat much too sweet. I was incredibly disappointed with the taste, though the chicken was quite moist, and the cooking time/temperature was definitely accurate. If I do make this again, the salt/sugar will be cut down significantly and more pepper will be added.

Made this in the winter for an Oscar party (representing The Help) and am about to make it again for a fairly large party because my husband loved it so much. Brined the chicken and really let it dry off before coating it, then let it dry again before frying it. I found my first pieces were a little too brown because I needed to lower the heat a bit, but overall it was crispy and moist. Made it in advance and reheated in my warming oven, which makes it great for a party.

just made this recipe for the second time, is quickly becoming a favorite for sunday dinners. i double the spiced flour amounts, i find it makes the breading process easier, and i also increase the buttermilk to a full quart. other than that, i follow the recipe and it comes out wonderfully.

Results were wonderful! Brined the chicken as instructed but only for 8 hours. Followed recipe except that I turned the chicken a bit more than instructed. The chicken was tender with a delightful crispy crunchy exterior. Will definitely add this one to my repertoire.

I haven`t made this yet but after reading the reviews I think this is the perfect thing to serve my guests at Christmas!

I have made a bunch of the "best" fried chicken recipes over the yearsalmost always for picnics the next day. This is the first recipe that was still crisp the day after making it and it was perfect. I followed the recipe exactly, though I had been skeptical about the sugar in the brine. The final product was not sweet and was not salty, (though it didn't need any salt either). This recipe is a winer just as written. -Kevin from Manhattan

Made this for dinner tonight, except omitted cayanne. Great result. Kids loved it. Cooking times were spot on. Definitely make it again.

This recipe is very similar to the one I use all the time, and it is a winner! You will never eat unbrined chicken again, at least not voluntarily. It produces the juiciest most flavorful white meat you will ever encounter. Too dry breast meat is history. (And the brining/frying technique works great with pork as well! Also try grilling chicken instead of frying. Holy Moly!) Points of interest: use kosher salt,(reg salt can be bitter and too salty) and I would go with the amounts listed in the recipe, at least at first. After you have made this once or twice, you may choose to alter one or more of a few things: salt/sugar ratio, or cut the amounts of both as I do, brine for a shorter period of time, especially if skinless or small pieces, leave plenty of room in the pan for the chicken; use two pans if necessary; crowding the chicken lowers the oil temp and leads to greasy chicken; use a cast iron pan; it will hold heat better; cook the white meat and dark meat separately; white cooks faster. The drying time leads to crispier chicken. I only use a couple cups of oil at most. A tip: if you use fresh breadcrumbs rather than flour or dried crumbs or panko for the final dredging, less oil is absorbed. However, watch the oil temp. Breadcrumbs burn easily and lead to a burnt outside while the inside is still underdone. Nice for shrimp too... I also cover the chicken, which aids cooking, keeps the splatter down. Most difficult part of this recipe is oil temp. I toss in a bit of the breading to see how it's going before sacrificing my chicken to not hot enough oil. Also, listen! Oil at the right temp makes some noise when it's frying. Don't worry too much about overcooking. If your fire is not too high, there shouldn't be any burning, and the brining process ensures plenty of moisture will remain in the meat. I've made this countless times over the last 30 or so years and it always provides noteworthy chicken.

I followed this recipe as written- used kosher salt where the recipe did not specify. The chicken had a good flavor, although a bit salty. The recipe did not specify to rinse the chicken after removing from the brine however when I make this recipe again, I will rinse it to hopefully eliminate some salt. This recipe is quite good and the cook times were accurate.

I adapted this recipe slightly after reading up on brining meats and also after seeing the user reviews. I used boneless, skinless, chicken tenders instead of the chicken the recipe called for. Because of this I used 1/3 less salt and only let it brine for 7 hours. I also made sure to use kosher salt instead of iodized table salt. And the other learning was to leave plenty of room in the pan so that the oil maintained its heat and things cooked evenly. It was absolutely delicious and there was not a leftover to be found. It's now my families favorite food (and I mean two kids age 5 and 2 and a husband who is no slouch in the kitchen himself). Delicious!!!

Worst fried chicken I ever had. I made it exactly according to the recipe (except only 1 tsp of cayenne) and used an oil thermometer to make sure my oil was the right temperature. The chicken meat was way too sweet. The coating on the chicken was very bland. The paprika in the coating mix burned long before the chicken was done, so it had to be taken out of the oil and finished cooking in a low oven until the meat was done. Those reviewers who commented that it was too salty must have used regular table salt. I used kosher salt, as called for in the recipe, and it lacked flavor. A waste of ingredients.

I followed the recipe pretty close, used pickling salt instead of kosher, and I prepared it in my deep fryer about 2/3 submerged close to cooking times & temp. suggested. I was very pleased with the finished product, but it took a long time to cook complete batch.

This is a very good technique, and I can see a lot of scope for varying the seasoning in both the brine and the flour. Although I have brined larger cuts of meat for water smoking, it never occurred to me to brine chicken for frying! Used skinned chicken legs as that was what I had on hand, and brined as per recipe for 24 hours. Did not add additional salt to any other part of the recipe. Substituted kefir for buttermilk, as I do in most cooked recipes (I culture it at home and it is always on hand). Regarding the saltines issue some people have had, not only will the length of time brining affect the saltiness of the meat, so will the size of the pieces. Shorten the brining time for smaller cuts. Because I was using skinned (which allows faster brining) legs, I knew I wouldn't want to add any additional salt to the rest of the recipe. Fortunately I've never seen salt water injected chicken in an Australian supermarket, so that isn't an issue for me. Air drying the coated pieces is essential, but you can use a fan to speed it up if in a hurry, or if your kitchen is excessively hot and you are concerned about spoilage. I agree with CapeMayCook about the quantity of oil and think possibly the recipe calls for deep frying because it was originally a restaurant recipe. If I were batch cooking for a very big crowd, I might deep fry. I used my mother's old, deep cast iron chicken fryer with sufficient oil to come up just over halfway on the pieces of chicken. The pieces were turned after well browned, about 10-12 minutes. The chicken was moist and flavourful and the crust very crispy, despite being skinless! And yes, it remains crispy the next day. I found the proportions of sweet to salt not quite to my liking and will cut down on the sugar next time. I will also increase the seasoning in the flour a little next time I make this. Given my American husband's enthusiasm for this recipe, I suspect I will be making it on a regular rotation.

This was a good recipe. I didn't have buttermilk so used an egg wash instead. Took the time to let the chicken dry before preparing and again before frying. It definiely made a difference. Didn't have any salt problem but I didn't add the salt to the egg wash. Only used about 2 cups flour for the dip. Also used abot 2 cups of oil total in a cast iron skillet rather than 8 cups suggested. Wasn't needed and would have been a waste in my view. Less waste to just turn the chicken over after 12 minutes and finish cooking on the other side. Kept warm in the oven on several folds of paper towels while the rest cooked. yum. Allowing for sufficient drying time really does allow a proper crust to form.

Made this for a picnic with friends and everyone devoured it! I heard more than once it was the best fried chicken ever. Very juicy and flavorful. I'll definitely be making this one again.

A question rather than a review: I notice that at one point in the recipe, kosher salt is called for, but in the brine it just says salt. I have only brined once, but it was with kosher salt. If I use kosher salt throughout the recipe, should I reduce the amounts, as other readers' comments seem to suggest that the end product is too salty, or keep to the amounts written, since kosher salt is actually less salty than table salt?

if you make this recipes again reduce the salt amount in breading by half. Between the brine and the breading there is way to much salt

Way too salty. Almost inedible. And we are not afraid of salt.

This really is incredible fried chicken. We took a few shortcuts- such as only brining for about 3 hours instead of the recommended 12-24. We also only let the chicken dry after being coated for 15 mins instead of 30 and it still came out great. We had some people over for dinner and everyone agreed it was the best fried chicken ever. I'm already looking forward to making it again. We were definitely fried chicken novices, so I'm super pleased with how well it came out.

Very tasty. I can see how some people might find it a bit salty, but I didn't mind at all. I didn't put any salt into the buttermilk, so that could have helped a bit. This is a great fried chicken recipe (my first), and I'd gladly make it again.

I consider myself an expert in judging fried chicken. This is the best I have ever had! Truly does stay crisp...even the next day. My son-in-law, who thought it was perfect freshly made, thought the leftovers were even better. I did listen to those who felt it was too salty...I used only about a third of the 1/4 cup salt for the brine and used only 1 tsp in the buttermilk and one tsp in the flour mixture. No one felt it was too salty and no one added salt. Rave review from my family; they loved the zip from the spices at the end.

I wasn't looking for spicy fried chicken, so I reduced the cayenne & paprika to only 1 1/2 tsp each. Some cooks complained about the salt. My chicken was not salty at all, but it was pastured chicken, not injected with saltwater as are many supermarket birds. My suggestion would be that if you're using supermarket chicken that's been injected to "plump" it, eliminate the salt in the flour mixture.

Really was fantastic! Made it for a huge group and everyone raved. I was thrilled since this was the 1st time I've ever attempted fried chicken-but now this will be a big party staple! The lone piece that survived was even crispy the day after. I think I made my brine too strong (messed up when I doubled for double batch I think) because it did seem a little salty then sweet but it was SO juicy!!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was so incredibly salty that it was inedible. We took a few bites, and threw it away. What a waste of time, effort and, most importantly, $. I read every review before making this and cannot believe that no one commented on the saltiness of this dish.

I never comment on recipes but I absolutely had to after making this... Looking at the recipe, I was a little nervous but this is absolutely the best fried chicken ever. I cooked for 6 friends and they couldnt get enough! I brined the chicken the night before and the cooking process was so easy. Definitely will make again!

Absolutely Delicious! It was a hit at my 4th of July potluck picnic and the first thing to be devoured from all the dishes there. We had other people who also brought fried chicken and their dishes were barely touched. I will say that the cooking time allotted for dark and white meat is slightly optimistic - especially if you have large meaty pieces. Take your time cooking it on medium heat. I would say 10 minutes (or more) on each side - otherwise your chicken will come out slightly undercooked. Also, I doubled everything in the recipe especially if you are cooking the equivalent of two whole chicken (Unless you have really small chickens). :) Other than that, I making this recipe one of my permanent dishes for informal occasions. Yummy!

2nd time in my life making fried chicken, this recipe is AMAZING. The first time i tried Alton Brown's recipe off the food network site, it came out ok-but considering the amount of work required it needs to be outstanding to justify. this recipe is great, just be sure to regulate the oil temp and let the chicken rest at least a half hour after breading.

First time brining and first time frying chicken. Came out beautifully.

Couldn't agree more with all previous posts -- this was my first time frying chicken and everyone (kids and all) devoured it. A bit salty but incredibly flavorful and chicken was extremely moist. Used a bigger chicken, cut breast halves in half and followed recipe to the letter. Monitor the temperature -- oil did not drop to 300 once chicken was in, so you've got to keep an eye on everything. Tried to keep temp between 300 and 325 for as much of the time as possible and it was absoultely perfect. Did anyone else have to make more brine to ensure the chicken was fully covered? I doubled the brine given the size of the chicken.

I wholly-heartedly agree with kmvaughan! Although, I liked that you can make it in advance. It was hands down the best fried chicken that I have ever had and the only recipe you will ever need. Didn't change a thing and it was perfect.

I normally do not review recipes but I chose to make this with my kids for mother's day and cannot say enough good things about it. It was a hit with everyone including 2.5 year old son, 5 year old daughter, and my wife. My wife said that it was the best fried chicken that she has ever had. It will be a staple for years to come. Two things that really stand out are how moist and tasty the meat is and how subtle the spicy flavor was. At first, you do not not the spicy skin but really are struck but the moist skin then about 10 seconds later, the spicy flavor of the skin builds up without being overpowering. The only downside is that the chicken needs to be brined one day in advance so it is not a last minute recipe.
