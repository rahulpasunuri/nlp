I was reminded of my mother's very simple potato soup and set out to make my own version. This soup is a wonderful version, as is. Potato soup is simple fare. If others thought it bland, simple additions could change that. This recipe, however, is a wonderful starting point, if nothing else.

A good base recipe. I used homemade chicken stock with tarragon. I didn't add the other herbs, thought they might not blend with the tarragon.

This is a great base for potato leek soup. I served it with several garnish options on the side: cayenne, chili powder, lime or lemon wedges, shredded raw carrots. Super good and fun!

I grilled and sauteed the vegetables and added all but the Tabasco. I added Garam Marsala, and it added the depth that the soup needed. Yum.

I was extremely disappointed with this recipe. I followed it with no chances and it tasted like watery potatoes. Don't make it unless you are planning on completely amending the recipe as some others have done.

So tasty and comforting! I followed the advice of many of the previous reviewers. I sauteed leeks, garlic and celery root in butter. Then added potatoes (1/2 russet, 1/2 yukon gold), broth, 2 cups dry marsala and 1 cup white wine. Simmered the potatoes for an hour, then pureed 3 cups of it, added cream, dill, fresh thyme and chives and salt/pepper. Delicious and easy.

Great base, as others have said (I rarely follow recipes to a tee). Sauteed leeks with kosher salt, then added garlic and curry powder; then about 3 1/2 lbs potatoes (skins on, two types--yellow and red boilers) and more kosher salt. Added about 1/2 C of wine and let it cook off for a moment; then 1/2 C of half & half, 3 C of broth, 2 C water. Brought to the boil, then simmered about 30 mins, adding chopped fresh sage, thyme, and oregano about 15 mins out. Pureed unevenly with an immersion blender and added more water to think it out a bit. Served topped with a drizzle of good oil, cracked pepper, and course salt. Awesome.

One pot process. Three cups of chopped celery and celery leaves, add 3-4 cloves of whole garlic. Go light on the dill, forget the cream. I didnt puree any of it. Garnish with sour cream and paprika when serving.

I don't know if this recipe is what made me go into labor, but my due date was 11/28/09 and I made this soup (SOOOO DELICIOUS) on 11/10/09 and gave birth 11/11/09. I LOVED the soup and if I hadn't been in the hospital and caring for my newborn for the next week, I would have TOTALLY eaten the left overs! YUMMMM!

Yeah...NO! this was bland and really not worth the effort.

I followed a few of the suggestions and then added a few of my own. Sauteed the leeks with garlic. In separate pan, sauteed two slices of bacon. Took out 3/4 of the fat, sliced the bacon and added the cooked leeks and potatoes for a couple minutes. Then added 4 cups of chicken broth, 3/4 dry marsala, fresh rosemary and 2 carrots. I simmered for 45 mins and then pureed the whole thing. Added 1/2 cup of cream and 1/2 milk. Garnished wish cheese garlic toasts to finish... yummy!! I agree this recipe alone is bland but is a good base for some modifications.

Added 3 cloves garlic and sauteed with leeks until tender. Added potatoes to the sautee after leeks were soft. Added 1/8 tsp. cayenne to simmer. Used 2 cups white wine and 1 cup Marsala wine. At table did the chives and a dolup of goat chesse to plates. Don't forget to season to taste as it's simmering. WOW!

As suggested in previous reviews: Go with the dry white wine and garlic. Sautee the garlic and leeks until wilted. Add salt to simmering potatoes. I added 1/8 tsp cayenne to simmering mixture as well. My guys loved it.

After trying several potato leek soup recipes, we keep coming back to this one. We add chicken sausage to make it a meal.

After reading the previous reviews, I was concerned about the soup coming out bland. I chopped a small onion until soft before adding the rest of the ingredients and made sure to add plenty of salt and pepper, not listed in the ingredients and after I pureed the soup, I added some blue cheese. I did feel the chicken broth diluted the rest of the flavors, like the white wine and the leeks. I'll keep making changes to this classic.

Rating: 4
I used others' suggestions and sauteed 4 cloves of garlic in the pan before adding the rest.Then I substituted white wine for water, added lots of fresh chives and used yukon gold instead of russet potatoes. Yum! (I especially like that it wasn't too heavy in the cream.)

i added about 5 cloves of garlic and replaced the water with 2 cups white wine and 1 of half and half. it was delicious- even better the next day.

I'm giving this three forks only because of the modifications I made... which could still use a little touching up. I sauteed the leeks in 1/4 cup butter for about 5 1/2 minutes, then added dried dill and basil (perhaps not using fresh it why I felt the soup was a bit lacking in flavor) before adding the rest of the ingredients. I made four cups of my own broth my chicken bouillon, yellow onion, carrot and celery and used a purchased chicken broth for the remaining four cups rather than using 5 cups broth, 3 cups water. Using water only would have really made this soup bland. I also used an entire cup of whipping cream. I did a mixture of red and russet potatoes because that is what I had and the red were in season. I did puree the entire batch and garnish it with the chopped chives. I also used real bacon bits as a garnish but still felt the soup was lacking in flavor a bit. It definitely needed quite a bit of salt and pepper (which the recipe does not call for during preparation). The soup was good and hopefully will be better the second day, like most soups are. Overall, I felt like it was lacking something, though I'm not sure what. The recipe called for hot sauce, which I skipped because it just didn't seem to "go" with the idea to me. A good soup shouldn't need to be doused in hot sauce... perhaps that's where I went wrong. I guess it would be a nice addition to the homemade broth to spice it up a bit, but again it seems unnecessary for this type of soup. My husband did love it and I tend to like things pretty salty so maybe it was just me... suggestions?

I found that this soup lacked the richness and hearty flavour of leek soup. I even pureed 3 extra cups of soup to make it more creamy, but it was not to my taste. I also found that the basil was a bit of a distraction. It was not terrible, but I would not make this again.

I had high hopes with all the great reviews but I actually poured the whole thing down the drain. I followed the recipe exactly but it was so bland it wasn't worth eating. I even used fresh herbs.

Fabulous! And so easy. I added a dollop of sour cream mixed with Fage greek yogurt in the center and then topped with chives and some carrot slivers for a little extra color. Don't forget the Tobasco to taste-and put some on the table for the folks like me who like it a little spicier. Serve with hot, crusty baguette and YUM.

This was a great comfort soup. Next time I will try another reviewer's suggestion of serving with hot sauce. Or maybe with some croutons.

I didn't rate because I edited based on some comments. I used Yukon Golds, and 4 leeks because I had 4. :) I reduced the liquid to 5 cups of (homemade) chicken broth and 2 of water. I also took one suggestion and rendered 4 strips of bacon in the pan before cooking, then sauteed the leeks for a minute in the bacon fat before adding the rest of the ingredients. I also prefer soups smooth, so I pureed most of it before serving. With all that, the recipe got rave reviews.

This is an absolutely delicious soup and easy to put together. I made it two days ahead of serving. Used 8 cups Imagine Vegetable Broth in place of the chicken broth and water. Skipped the whipping cream and used f/f half and half istead. Used all fresh herbs (chives, dill and basil). Served with sour cream and hot sauce. With a good loaf of bread this is a filling dinner on a cold night.

Used organic free range chicken broth (4 cups instead of 5) and cut back the water to 2 cups. Used a variety of different potatoes for texture and color. Since I do not have a blender, I diced the potatoes to 1/4" - 1/2" cubes and used a hand masher. Very easy to make. Definately will use again.

Delicious - this is my favourite potato soup recipe.

This was yummy, comforting and unbelievably easy. I used dried dill, but fresh on all the rest and it was great. I had some homemade turkey stock on hand and I think that made a big difference with the richness of the soup. I was concerned about the gummy comments, so as I peeled and chopped the potatoes, I soaked them briefly in cold water to remove some of the starch. Will definitely make this again.

I was inspired at the grocery store by Leeks and Pancetta and so I settled on making this soup on Halloween. I made the recipe exactly as-is, except that we sauteed and rendered 4 pieces of chopped pancetta in the dutch oven before adding everything--we left in the pancetta and fat and sauteed the leeks in the fat for about one minute before adding the rest of the ingredients. Also--we pureed about half of the soup before adding it back in--the consistency was incredible and it was even better the next day. I highly recommend the addition of bacon! and pancetta brought it to a whole new level...

Terrific recipe. I made it with Swanson's vegetable stock instead of chicken stock, because there's a vegetarian in the family, and it was excellent.

Extremely easy soup - it literally takes 10 min to prepare, then you can simmer for one hour. Very good, basic soup. I served with the DILLED CHEDDAR CHEESE BATTER BREAD from this site for lunch.

This is a great base! I think next time, I'll add diced carrots and celery, and maybe a little more fresh dill because it's one of my fav herbs. I also think adding a little bacon would give it a nice, smokey flavor, if you don't mind tacking on fat and calories. I used light cream, didn't add any hot sauce, nor did I puree any of the soup because it's so thick already. I don't think substituting fat free half and half would make much of a difference, since the soup is already creamy without having the cream base. I'm very pleased with this, especially for being so easy!

Rating: 4
Excellent and easy!!! Definitely a keeper. I used all fresh herbs and chicken broth in the box that you find at health food stores. I added 1 C of cream instead of 1/2 C, but it probably would have been very good either way. It tasted good the next day as well. Everyone loved it - this one will definitely be a staple for cool weather cooking.

This was a great soup, I made some tonight, and the herbs in it gave it a nice and refreshing taste. I followed the recipe as it said, the only thing that I did differently was puree the whole soup which gives it a bit more thickness. If you are looking for a good potatoe leek soup this is the one for you... yum!

Delicious, simple recipe that is really nice on a cold winter day. I've made this several times; sometimes with fresh herbs, but it is also very good with dried---I like thyme and dill. If you are watching fat intake, the cream won't be missed. I like a chunky soup for everyday, so I usually puree 2/3's & leave the rest...mmmmmm. If

A wonderfully hearty soup, and it improves over the course of a day. The mingling of the dill and basil gets better over time, so I'd make this up the day before serving. I was cooking for vegetarians as well as omnivores, so I substituted a vegetable stock of my own (when I couldn't find any premade stuff at the store) -- just a carrot, tomato, some celery, and parsley -- using the same porportions as called for with the chicken broth. I waited to put the cream in until after bringing the rest of the soup back down to a simmer, but other than that, I followed the recipe, and we couldn't get enough of this soup. It was robust and hearty without feeling heavy, and I'll definitely put it into the regular rotation at home.

This is the best leek-potato soup I have ever tasted! The only thing I did differently (on the advice of other cooks who have reviewed this recipe), was to puree the entire mixture, and it turned out wonderfully. I then added the cream at the end, and the consistency was nice and smooth. A great starter when having company.

Rating: 3
Great and easy recipe. I also "beefed" it up a bit and used all veggie stock (what I had in the pantry) and added garlic. I added 2 cloves raw and 2 cloves roasted. I sauteed the garlic and leeks for 5 minutes in 1T butter then followed the recipe, not using Dill but added a bay leaf instead. YUM!

Rating: 3
Definitely use russet or peeled baking potatoes; anything waxy will make it gooey. The sweetness of the basil and dill plays off the sweetness of the leeks nicely but I also had to add a lot of salt. Terrific after a long afternoon of simmering and yes, even better the next day.

Good consistency, flavour and very easy to make. I used parsley instead of dill though - the dill-basil combination sounded a bit odd to me.

I really enjoyed this dish. I added just a little nutmeg on the second day when I re-heated it and was very pleased with the extra depth it gave to the flavor.

Have made this many times and its always delish. I use all broth and throw in a few garlic cloves. Many times I don't even add the herbs. I've found that when I puree the soup in the pot with the stick blenders, it can turn it goopy (why this is I don't know). Using the regular old blender seems keep it from getting icky

I wish I had scrolled down and read the other comments, I would have not used water and used more half & half. I thought the soup was bland and blending it (more than half) made it gooey. I need to work with this one again before I go the 4 fours!! :)

Loved this soup! But I must admit, I made a few changes. I used white potatoes instead of russets because it's what I had on hand. Also used more stock than water since I had homemade stock on hand. Substituted thyme and fresh oregano for the dill and basil, setting aside half the herbs for the last 2 or 3 minutes of the cooking time so their flavors would stand out more. Even without these changes I think the recipe would be a keeper because it's very easy and a good base for allowing one to be a little creative.

I pureed all of it. Returned it back to the stove. Kept it under a medium to low flame and added 1 more can of the broth and then the cream. (I just don't like my potato soup lumpy). The results were nothing less than perfect. Wonderful flavors and a beautiful soup for the start of an elegant dinner.

After spending a month in England and Scotland last year, I ate many varieties of leek and potato soup. This is my favorite to date, as I don't like heavy cream-laden soups. I made one change to the recipe - I used 8 cups of broth to give a better body to the soup. DEFINITELY make the day before.

I made this soup for dinner last night and my husband and I had to add a lot of salt to it. I am hoping that the other reviews are right when they say that the flavors develop over night.
