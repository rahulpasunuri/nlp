Made this for Thanksgiving last year and a few times since... wonderful! I'm excited to make it again this year. Just a note about the bacon: it definitely helps to get good bacon and really crisp it up. I used the thick, applewood-smoked from the Whole Foods butcher counter. It's not too expensive since you don't need much, and if you bake it on a cooling rack on a baking sheet, it is really meaty/crispy. Perfect for this recipe.

Overall a very nice recipe. However, as I often do, I did modify slightly. For one, I thought the finished dish was way too greasy (from the bacon). If making again, I would pour off all but about 1 TBS of bacon grease as following the recipe resulted in bacon grease overpowering everything. Luckily it did work to throw the completed dish in a colander and rinse for a few minutes (while tossing). Then I placed back in a (wiped) pan with just a little olive oil and I heated and tossed to coat. MUCH better that way. I also thought the dish needed a hint of acid, so I added a little white wine vinegar at the end. Don't be shy with the chestnuts as they don't stick out (enough) in the finished dish (in my opinion) so more is better.

Delicious, quick and easy to make.

I'm surprised more people haven't made this. It was a big hit at my Thanksgiving dinner, even with picky eaters. The chestnuts were worth the trouble to find them; they added a wonderful richness. The bacon I used was a bit fatty, so I drained some of the fat. Easy and really delicious!

This recipe is nice and simple, with a smoky, earthy taste from the bacon and chestnuts. I served this alongside pork and rice, and not a green bean or chestnut was left on anyone's plate. It's going on our Thanksgiving table this year!
