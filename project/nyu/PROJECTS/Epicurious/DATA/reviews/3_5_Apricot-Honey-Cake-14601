Like others, I found the description of "juice of 1 lemon and 1 orange" to be very vague and can lead to varying cake results. Too much juice can lead to a dense, gummy cake. I'd recommend reducing the amount of orange and lemon juice added and ommitting the sugar (the cake is sweet enough with honey).

I made this recipe in honor of St. Nicholas Day, and it was fantastic! I didn't change a thing, except I used chopped almonds instead of slivered. I didn't have enough honey for a whole receipt, so I made a half recipe, which made 7 mini loaves, each a bit bigger than a regular sized cupcake). The cakes are moist and light, with delicate citrus flavor. The apricots add just enough flavor and texture to make it interesting. The recipe comes together quickly and easily; while the apricots soak, get the rest of the ingredients together. This might just become a new annual tradition in our house!

Wow. I don't think I'll ever make a honey cake from any other recipe again. I've made and eaten 40 years' worth of them, and this was the best one ever - tangy and sweet but not cloying like so many honey cakes are. My changes (thank you, other reviewers) made it come out perfectly: 1) Added extra 1/2 tsp baking soda 2) Used grand marnier for the soaking liquid 3) Made it in a well-sprayed Jewish star-shaped bundt pan 4) Cooked for 65 minutes at 325. Fantastic and gorgeous!

Excellent and easy to make. It took mine longer in the oven than the recipe called for. No biggie, it still tasted just fine.

This is an additional comment to my earlier review. I have found over the many years that I have made this exceptional honey cake that the timing is the biggest issue. Although the recipe calls for 50 - 55 minutes, the cake must be checked for doneness and may take somewhat longer to bake. I recommend using a tester especially in the middle of the loaf so as to avoid the gummy texture that one reviewer noted.

After the first try, my sister-in-law insists I make this every year. It's always worth it.

Made one for Rosh Hashannah, and then went back and made 2 more. Followed others' advice: no sugar, tossed apricots in flour, watched carefully for burning, and covered for the rest of the bake. Everyone loved it.

This is a repeat review, I am not giving another fork rating, but am just confirming that as honey cake goes, this is the best as far as I'm concerned. In my earlier review I mentioned substituting molasses for half of the honey called for, for a darker look and richer taste. My guests asked for pieces to take home. It is very sweet (I might even reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup), but very moist, and the apricot bits have a slight tartness to them.

Well, I consider myself a fairly good chef/baker and I am not sure what I was expecting from this recipe but, after all the rave reviews, I was sorely disappointed. I, like another earlier reviewer, found the texture gummy and not light/airy at all. To add insult to injury, the flavor did no justice to the sum of the great ingredients. I am wondering if this wild discrepancy is due to the juiciness of my citrus. "Juice of one lemon and one orange" is unbelievably vague, and can lead to vastly different end products. My orange and lemon were both very juicy, so I found myself only adding part of the extracted amount. Still, this cake recipe is in the garbage, and the cake relegated to the back of the freezer, but it will, in all probability, follow the trajectory of the recipe. The rugelach recipe, on the other hand, is outstanding, and is oh-so- much easier to make than the croissant roll-up type. : )

Not at all like a traditional honey cake - much better. This cake gets praise from everyone (even my father), including those who don't like honey cake. My only suggestion is to watch the top of the cake, especially the nuts. The top gets a bit dark and the nuts have a tendency to burn before the cake is done. I've put foil over the top towards the end to keep it from over browning.

This has become my "go to" honey cake for the Holidays. I even make it for my father-in-law's birthday, at his request. I'm not crazy about traditional honey cakes, but this one is superb. I have only made it with regular white flour, never rye. I have also substituted brandy when necessary. Always, it comes out divine.

What an excellent honey cake. It was great to make with pre-school kids -as they can help in many of the steps-, it shipped beautifully, and it froze well. After making five cakes (a double batch, then a triple batch), I have the following comments: (1) I halved the sugar the first time, and omitted it entirely the second time. It's still very sweet without it. (2) I used organic whole-grain rye flour. Made excellent cakes that are even more appealing to diet-conscious family members. (3) Works fine without the nuts (we have allergies.) (4) If making double or triple batches, make an extra effort to spread the apricots evenly, or one of your cakes will end up with all of them. (5) As other reviewers, I found that the apricots sink to the bottom of the pan. I hope to find suggestions from other cooks on this issue. This cake is now a big family favorite. We'll be making it for many years to come!

The only thing I changed about this recipe was that I used the Splenda & Sugar blend sold now. My boss is Jewish and I wanted to make him something special for Rosh Hashanah. I divided the batter into two small bread pans. Then I gave one to him and the other I kept. It was delicious! It was alot of fun to make.

I made this with half regular (couldn't find white) rye flour, half unbleached flour, and baked in 3 Pani-Mould 7" loaf pans, 2 mailed as gifts & one for me. Very good reviews from all, & it kept well. I made a version with dried peaches & peach jam, and am now thinking about trying it with prunes & plum jam, dried sour cherries & cherry preserves, dried apples & apple butter...

Utterly superb- an elegant, grown-up dessert that's not tooth-rottingly sweet. I omitted the sugar entirely, used whiskey instead of rum, and topped it with cashews. I did have to add a significant amount of extra baking time because I baked it in a round springform pan. (1hr + 20 mins until tester came out clean.)To serve, I suggest a zig-zag of honey across the plate with a dollop of whipped cream. Utter heaven, a new family favourite!

This was a real disappointment. I baked it for a very long time, it tested done, but the texture was gummy. Granted, I had frozen it after baking (and cooling), but I have frozen many honey cakes with no problem. The taste was also too sweet, and too apricot. (And I love apricot!) Too bad! The ingredients sounded like the cake would be fabulous.

I have made this recipe three times, and the only change I have made was adding a 1/2 tsp more baking soda. It helped the cake rise and hold the apricots, cook more evenly, and come out perfectly. I have also sustituted brandy for the rum, and it worked as well or better. This is THE cake I get asked for more than any other- my father-in-law loved it so much I made one for his birthday. I use a spring form pan, sprinkle with powdered sugar, and serve with vanilla whipped cream. Perfect!

This ia a realy good, moist, delicious honey cake. No dessert without chocolate is likely to get 4 forks from me, so getting 3 is the bestthis recipe could get! I added a littleg ground clove and cinnamon to the batter, and replaced the rum with cointreau, and brushed some over the baked cake as it cooled, and I made it in a Bundt pan. I served it with vanilla ice cream. Yum!

Cook time: I took the cake out (having covered the top with foil at about 60 minutes)at 69 minutes. This was in a 10x5" pan and in a new and reliable oven as to temp. There was still a bit of moist batter on the tester. I was amazed that a Joan Nathan recipe was that far off!-I used a large Valencia orange, which was quite juicy. This may be part of the problem. Better to give a precise measure for the juices, instead of "juice of 1 orange and lemon." I sprinkled some white sugar on the top before baking.

So, so, so good! Followed lots of the reader's tips - I used 1 3/4 unbleached flour, 1/4 cake flour. Mixed in more cake flour with the drained apricots and they did not sink. Substituted apple sauce for half of the oil. Moist, sweet, citrusy - just delish!

Rating: 3
I read all the comments and suggestions carefully and can confirm the following: 1. To avoid having the pieces of apricot fall to the bottom of the pan coat them in flour (after they've been soaked and drained). 2. Bake at 325 for 65 minutes, lower part of the oven. I followed the advice of another reader and baked for 75 minutes. This is a bit too long for really moist cake. 3. I used a 9"x5" pan and make a mini loaf in another, smaller pan (5x3x2). This one was done after 35 minutes.

THIS IS DEFINTELY THE EASIEST AND MOST DELICIOUS HONEY CAKE I HAVE EVER MADE.

This was a nice cake and definitely not as dry as a lot of honey cakes. I tried making it in a bundt pan and it came out fine. Next time, I think I would add 1/4 tsp. cinnamon or maybe nutmeg-- the flavor is very fruity and I think some spice would balance it out more. I've been eating the leftovers for breakfast with coffee-- toasted, with a little butter.

this cake was devoured yesterday--yummmmy! second loaf in the oven as i type...i baked mine in a standard loaf pan, with extra dough in 2 ramekins (careful overfilling, this dough rises a bit). i also didn't add nuts (not usually used for rosh hashana). it definitely baked longer than called for (more like 65 min) and i covered losely with foil toward the end to keep the top from browning too much. a definite keeper to make every rosh hashana (and other times of the year too!).

I was looking for a unique present for my friends this Rosh Hashana and decided to give away mini honey cakes with a greeting card I made. I looked up for interesting honey cakes recipies, and as I found this one I knew that was it. I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat flour and only half the amount of lemon zest and juice (using more orange juice). The cakes came out delicous and the copliments accordingly. Thanks for the recipe, it's definitely a keeper.

Hi I made this recipe twice this weekend (no rye flour used). The recipe author's comment about his mother using burnt sugar intrigued me, so when I made the recipe the first time I used light brown sugar instead of white. I made one 8" (8.5"?)loaf pan (from supermarket) plus 2 mini loaves. I doubled the foil pans for extra insulation and strength--wanted to be able to give some of them away in the pans. Cakes came out great, pale inside color, tasted even better the second day, and I imagine they will keep even unfrozen for several days, though I froze my big one. Second time I made the recipe, I doubled all ingredients for a big batch, and then found I didn't have enough honey. Instead, I used what in the original single recipe proportions would be 1/2 cup of honey plus 1/2 cup of molasses. I wasn't at all sure how this would work out, but the cakes of course came out a darker brown color inside and with what I think is a richer flavor--texture slightly more dense. It may even be closer to the author's mother's burnt sugar taste. Either way, it's obviously a great recipe, and no more dry honey cakes!

delish! I just made this for Rosh Hashanah and am keeping it in the freezer for the next three weeks. No problem with it cooking through... I use a 9 x 5 and put the extra batter in 4 ramekins. I cooked everything at 325 and the ramekins took about 30 mins and the loaf took 75 minutes. Even though I put some flour in with the drained apricots (as per another reviewer's suggestion) they still seem to have sunk to the bottom. But I don't think it really matters. The cake is surprisingly light and tastes almost caramelized. I think my family will love this one.

I made this to wild reviews for a few holiday parties - it was excellent. I put a bit of the flour in with the drained apricots, and that may have helped them "float" in the mix a bit as mine did not sink. It did, however, take a long time to cook, and the middle stayed a little softer than I would have liked.

I'm going to keep making this until I get it right because the taste is fabulous. Year 1 in pan size specified: top burned, inside never cooked. Year 1 in downsized pans: better but still not right. Next year I'm going to try a tube pan! Other suggestions welcome.

I'm not generally excited by honey cakes. They're either heavy and dry or heavy and oily (to offset the dryness). But you really can't celebrate the Jewish New Year without one. This honey cake is exceptional. Light, moist, and not oily (only 1/3 cup oil). The cake is delicious (the flavor develops over time -- and the cake keeps well in the refrigerator or freezer). I cut the apricot pieces very small to avoid the "sweet/tart" problem mentioned by one reviewer. For a non-traditional touch (and to cut the sweetness), I paired the cake with a little unsweetened whipped cream (clearly, a Kosher household can only do this for a dairy meal). I didn't have a 10X5 loaf pan, so I used a 9X5 instead. I put the extra batter in greased ramekins to make mini-cakes for gifts (the ramekins cooked in about 20 minutes).

I used a blend of all-purpose and spelt flour, and substituted applw sauce and low-fat sour cream for 2/3 of the oil, but this cake turned out moist, sweet, and flavorful. It was dense in a loafy kind of way but that was all right, and the apricots stayed happily suspended throughout the cake.

Man. I wish this cake really worked out. I made it twice just to be sure but I found it to be an unpleasant mix of sweet and tart. My first version was with White Rye flour from Bob's Red Mill brand and it turned out really mushy inside and burnt on outside despite careful monitoring. Next try was with regular flour and cake flour. The conistency was nice but the flavor was still out of balance. It's a shame that a recipe with such wonderful ingredients is just shy of greatness.

I baked this cake for my boyfriend and he loved it. This cake is delicious - moist and not too sweet. Like the previous reviewer, my apricots sank to the bottom and the batter was too thin. Maybe next time I will add less juice and a little more flour. TrYiT!!!

This was a delicious cake! It turned out nice and moist and not overly sweet as I initially suspected. I will definitely be making it again and again. The only problem I encountered was that the apricot pieces eventually sank to the bottom rather than remaining evenly distributed. Not sure what the solution is. Maybe a little more flour?

Even though I have never liked honey cake, this was just wonderful...the tartness of the apricots mixed with the sweetness of honey and sugar made a delicious nosh! A new version of an old cake! I didn't have the rum, but it was still a treat, and really quite easy! Everything in to the Cuisanart!

I loved this cake. It looked beautiful and tasted yummy. This is a dense, flavorful cake that is a non-traditional honey cake. Although everyone liked it, they thought it was too different from the traditional honey cake for the Jewish holidays to be really authentic. Like another reader, I used Cognac instead of rum and it worked out great. I would make it again.

I've heard that this is made for the Jewish new year and is supposed to bring a sweet new year. We're not Jewish but made this for Jan. 1 new year because we think it's a sweet idea and will make this our family tradition from now on. It is very good. I made it in a loaf pan and the outside cooked VERY quickly while the inside was still gooey. I think next time I'll turn down the heat a bit and see if that helps keep the outside from getting so crispy and browned.

OK I loved this cake. But I, too, wish to recreate the honeycake of my childhood (during the 1970s) and the recipe for the cake my mother used to make has been lost. Does anyone know of a recipe for honeycake that includes ginger ale? I believe it was published in a Hadassah Ladies Cookbook, but I have no idea in what year. If there is anyone out there who can help me, please E-mail to Lisag_10025@yahoo.com.
