Two new things for me: 1) I rarely follow a recipe as "is" 2) And even less frequently, do I leave a review! But, this was SUPERB! Used the ingredients listed, did not improvise and this soup really hit the spot! Perfect for a Sunday night and football- This is the new family favorite. Used D'Artignan Chorizo, Martinti & Rossi vermouth and a cup of Viognier

So simple, but so good. I substituted shallots for the onion, and brown mushrooms for the shiitakes. The shiitakes (or fresh porcini) probably would have been even better, but it was pretty darned good as it was.

I made recipe exactly as stated and it turned out fantastastic. I used homeade tomato sauce and the only thing I would do different next time, would be to add some mussels, and maybe even white fish and shrimp to make seafood still. This is a lovely, simple base. delicious sauce. Fresh parsley would also be a nice addition.

I made this last night and both my husband and I thought we were in heaven! The sauce (used homemade tomato sauce) in the stew was fabulous. It was a very easy meal to make, great for a weeknight. We served the stew with garlic bread as suggested, Wonderful!

Even though it is not mentioned in the online recipe, heating the oven to 450 is for the garlic bread, not the Clam Stew.

I too would like to know what I am missing from the instructions regarding preheating the oven. There is no reference to transferring ingredients from sauce pan to casserol and putting in the oven. I have not made this yet but looks good, if I can figure out if it is supposed to be finished in the oven or not. Can't imagine that, however.

I loved this! This sauce had a wonderful flavor, it was out of this world and it really was very easy to make.

This recipe is amazing (as with most from this fab cookbook!). I used 2 pounds of mussels instead of clams and have made both with and without the shitakes - both good. Once tomato sauce is made - let it simmer for a bit to let the flavours combine. Also, after adding mussels only steam for about 4-5 min - they open quickly and you don't want to overcook. YUM!

im sure this is very good. please forgive this silly comment. it's just that i like mario and he obviously is a very talented and knowlegeable chef, so it seems funny that he'd incorperate chorizo into his always authentic italian cuisine

My husband declared this was one of the top 10 things I ever made! Delicious and quick to prepare! After the clams opened the sauce looked too liquidy so I removed all the "stuff" with a slotted spoon and reduced the sauce. (Be sure to use a good quality tomato sauce as it's the base for your sauce). Serve it over pasta (not with bread) as the sauce is incredible.
