Made this tonight and loved the recipe. Will make again for sure. The vinaigrette is terrific. Wouldn't change a thing!

One of my favorite artichoke recipes. For vegetarians - substitute in something salty and with similar heft to anchovies - like kalamata olives. I suggested this to a friend and she loved it.

Delish! Used regular artichokes and made the sauce. Served it with roasted salmon and it all went together perfectly. This is one of those high umami type recipes - so satisfying.

I only needed 1/4 cup of olive oil, even despite integrating the vinaegrete and artichokes with one half pound of linguine. By the way: this is tasty over whole wheat pasta! Also, as my first attempt with artichokes, trimming these 12 babies required approximately 30 minutes.

Very tasty ... if you omit the anchovies, you'll need to add some salt. Soy sauce could be a good vegetarian alternative.

i made this recipe more or less as called for (improvised quantities instead of measuring, etc.) and i steamed the chokes instead of boiling them. oh, and i live in nyc, so outdoor grilling is slightly hard to come by, so i seared the artichokes on a cast iron skillet... truly flavorful and a delight!! after chopping up the sauce ingredients and turning the flame off the pan, i thoroughly tossed the baby artichokes in the mixture and promptly ate a couple straight out of the bowl. sublime... this recipe is so good, it's worth the labor intensive prep to repeat for visiting guests later in the week.

Way better than any commercial marinated artichoke hearts we have tried. It is time consuming to prep the fresh baby chokes. I added some Maille mustard and used red wine vinegar in the sauce. The warm artichokes went into the sauce and marinated about 1 hour before dinner. Left overs are chilling in the fridge. It was a perfect counterpoint to a pan roasted duck breast. I can't wait to try it with lamb. I might be tempted to try this with frozen artichoke hearts. Heat them up, and proceed!

Interesting flavor but not exactly delicious. I thought the sauce overpowered the artichokes. I think I will stick to butter/lemon concoctions.

What about anchovies is vegetarian? They are fish and are not vegetarian!

I think many vegetarians would object to the presence of anchovies in this recipe. I wish epicurious would be a bit more careful about that kind of thing.

Oh my, these babies are to die for! I tweaked the recipe a bit, omitting a few superflous steps & left out the anchovies (not a fave). To start, I acidulated the water with the juice of a whole lemon & tossed in the halves, as well. I cooked the pieces in heavily salted water (2Tbsp) along with the stems from the chopped mint & the lemons. After they cooked, I drained the artichokes & put them, still warm,into the oil/caper/mint /vinegar mixture & marinated them for an hour. As the author stated, warm veggies soak up the flavors better & I was able to eliminate the extra2T bsp. of olive oil. I also didn't see the need to rinse the capers, as they are in a vinegary brine akin to the vinegar called for in the recipe. The results are heavenly; don't see how it can get any better than this!
