Eh, this recipe is okay. It's basically a no-bake cheesecake with fruit on top. Nothing fancy. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I thought the crust was very good.

I have made this several times and passed onto frieds. It is so good when the peaches and blackberries are fresh. Have made it with the crust as in the recipe and also with prepared graham cracker crust when in a hurry. Both were great. Many requests to bring to friends. Don;t think it would work well with frozen, but may give it a try.

I made this to bring to a dinner party along with an apple pie ( I am known for). I bought blackberries on sale and didn't know what to do with them. I found this recipe even though I don't like cheesecake. It was sooooo easy to make. I used Dole Sliced Peaches (in the plastic jar) instead of fresh peaches as they weren't in season and very expensive. It was DEVOURED!! Everyone asked me for the recipe. I used a pre-made graham crust and didn't bake it. I also needed to make another set of filling as the recipe only filled it halfway. I am making it for Thanksgiving to bring to another friends house.

I didn't have time to chill the cream cheese mixture so I redid this recipe two ways. First I skipped baking the crust, instead I used a food processor and made the crust by blending all the ingredients. I put all the crumbs into a deep pie crust and pushed up to make a shell. Then I placed the fresh fruit on top. Put all the cream cheese mixture on top and chilled - my kids thought it was great! They ask for it all summer.B

For a super fast version: Use store bought vanilla wafer crust, use half the amount of sugar and almond extract, use can peaches and do not bake, just serve well chilled. Yum!

To the cook from Houston: It's usually not a good idea to put a dish straight from the freezer directly into a hot oven - the temperature extremes could cause it to crack or shatter. I'd let it warm up a little bit at room temp.

Question for the cook from Myersville: Can you put your pie plate directly in the pre-heated oven after it has just come out of the freezer? Thanks for any help you can give me.

The almond taste was a little overwhelming; next time, I would probably not add extract to the cream cheese filling. And did anyone else experience extremely runny filling despite hours of chilling?

I don't know what the previous review meant by this crust is terrible. I've made this recipe twice now and everyone wants to know how I made this gorgeous crust! I baked it an extra 3-5 minutes and cooled it completely before adding the filling and cooled it again before I added the fruit. I used fresh blueberries from my garden and peaches. I've never gotten better reviews for a dessert:) Make sure the whole pie is cooled and you have a sharp knife to cut and serve with. Absolutely delicious and your guests and family will rave!

I bought a pre-made crust for this recipe. The filling and topping were a good idea, but I found that if you wanted it to stay together, you had to make it the night before. Wish I had known before the dinner party I made it for. It just kinda fell apart right before my eyes. I made it about 4 hours in advance. If you do make this one, prepare it the night before!

The crust part of this recipe is lousy. Here is the recipe for shortbread crusts for cheesecakes: 1.5 cups flour, 1/4-1/3 cup sugar, dep. on taste, 1 large separated egg, yolk lightly beaten, 1/2 cup butter. preh. ov. to 400, mix flour and sugar form depression in a mound of fl. and sug. and add yoke and butter, blend theses well with dry mixture. shape into ball, chill at least 10 min. , roll out to 1/4 " thick (betw wax paper if you can), use springform pan, place inside pan. Bake in oven for 15-20 minutes or until light brown. Cool, fill, eat. Incredible.

The crust fell apart. Ended up serving peaches and blackberries over ice cream.

With all the concern about to much butter I added the butter as if I were preparing a standard flour based crust. I processed the cookies in the processor, then added chilled butter until the mixture resembled corn meal and finally I added the extract. The crust came out great. I have already been asked to prepare this pie for our family's upcoming Easter dinner.

Absolutely delicious and a huge hit at an office pot luck lunch. I was pinched for time so I used a store-bought graham cracker crust and canned, sliced peaches. (Peaches are out of season right now...I drained the syrup out). Topped with blueberries.

I've made this twice now--both times for guests and it's been a big hit. The second time, however, I used half the butter and put the crust in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking. Both those steps helped and the crust came out much better the second time. Both times I used blueberries instead of blackberries and it made a beautiful presentation. And, like another reviewer said, the almond extract is the key--don't leave it out!

This is a great pie, I topped it with raspberries and blackberries. I am going to half the butter in the crust next time, I had to blot it with paper towels three times there was so much butter, also I am going to try and freeze the pies rather than chill it so that it holds together better. Great taste, will make again!

This was a wonderful dish! Very delicious. The almond extract makes it.
