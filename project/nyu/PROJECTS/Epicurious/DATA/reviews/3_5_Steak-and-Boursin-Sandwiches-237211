Since we like grilled romaine sprinkled with olive oil, S&P and parmesan, we used that. For the boursin we used garlic and herb and loved it - will use that on sandwiches again! The bread you choose can make it or break it too. Super easy weeknight meal or weekend lunch. Easily lends itself to additions.

Definitely a keeper! A great pull-it-out-of-your-ear supper that's elegant and delicious.

No Boursin within 50 miles; added horseradish sauce and pepper to plain old cream cheese, spread on toasted baguette and added baby Swiss chard (raw). My husband thinks I'm a genius! Thanks for a tasty, quick meal.

This is my FAVORITE in- a-heartbeat recipe. Seriously fast. Seriously good. Use sirloin instead of flank for a more superior bite . . . be generous with the boursin . . . and experiment with a flat loaf of ciabatta instead of rolls. So good!

My husband liked this more than I did. I love flank steak, but thought the lettuce was gross and felt the Boursin wasn't subtle enough.

Oops, I forgot add in my previous review that I also toasted the baguette halves under the broiler. SUPER GOOD sandwiches!!!

FANTASTIC, and when compared only with other sandwiches, a definite 4 forker. I made half of the recipe to serve two. Marinated the flank in the marinating liquid from "London Broil with Soy Citrus Mayonnaise" (from this site), and BBQ'd it on the gas grill for 4-a-side on high. No Boursin cheese in this town, so I whisked 3 grated garlic cloves, 1/4 tsp. black pepper, and a generous sprinkle of fines herbs into 2-1/2 oz. (by weight) of chive and onion cream cheese spread. Loved the sautéed romaine on this sandwich!!! (Had never heard of sautéing this before.) Will make this MANY times, perhaps increasing the size of each sandwich next time!!!

I have to disagree with previous reviewers--the sauteed romaine added a lot! Don't leave it out. This was quick, easy, and delicious, but if I'm going to buy flank steak, I like to make something a little more special.

This was decent, nothing special, really one and a half forks, but I'll give it two. The hearts of romaine didn't add anything, I made this a second time and omitted it. The Boursin cheese was nice, but the sandwich needed something else. The first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly. The second time, I increased the salt, added chopped fresh rosemary to the Boursin, toasted the bread and rubbed with garlic, then topped with some caramelized red onions. The second version gets 3 forks.

My husband says this is the best sandwich he has ever had. I toasted the rolls; we liked the toasty crunch. We also tried it with hamburgers when we wanted something more adult tasting than the usual condiments. Thanks for the geat idea!

Quick to make and relatively tasty. Instead of the romaine, I used caramelized onions. Warm/hot lettuce just doesn't appeal to me. Would toast the bread next time. Quick, easy and tasty. Cate from www.sweetnicks.com
