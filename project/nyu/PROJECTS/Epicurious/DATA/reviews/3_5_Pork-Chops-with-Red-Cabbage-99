Used bonless pork loin. Added 1/4 cup chicken stock to cabbage. Did not have marjoram so used Herbs de Provence. Then made a wine reduction and butter sauce for chops. This could easily be a crowd pleaser.

Amazing, Amazing!!! just added chopped bacon to the top of the cabbage and sage/marjoram/S&P for the pork rub. Cooked the pork in the bacon grease and also drizzled some of the bacon grease in the cabbage along with a bit of chicken broth. Super delicious and EASY! Served with Rice-a-Roni.

Rating cabbage only: Terrible. Absolutely flavorless. The marjoram and the garlic undetectable. I normally enjoy balsamic vinegar with red cabbage when the cabbage is lightly sauteed and still a bit crunchy. This was very soft and the balsamic vinegar didn't go with the cabbage texture well. I wanted to throw the whole thing away, but decided to salvage the dish at the expense of it being "light". Added some fried pancetta and garlic butter-based roux. That made it edible. The next time I want "light", I'll have some chopped sauerkraut with onions, parsley and olive oil.

This was excellent and cudos to Pam for suggesting the bacon! It made the dish!

I also thought it was a great way to do pork chops. I followed the recipe and incorporated the other suggestions. I did have to add chicken stock to the cabbage to prevent it from sticking and it also helped to cook the cabbage. I added sage to the pork and the cabbage and before serving, I added crispy bacon to the cabbage. Everyone loved it!

This was really great! My family absolutely loved it as well. Made it pretty much the way it is written. Added a little chicken broth to cabbage during cooking and put the sauce stuff for the pork chops in at the end of cooking.

Delish. This was my first time cooking red cabbage and I loved it. All of the flavours married up nicely. I made a few changes. Whilst the cabbage was cooking, I added a few splashes of the chicken broth here and there to keep it moist and prevent browning. I also added one golden delicious apple, as well as an extra clove of garlic. I didn't find the balsamic taste overwhelming by any means. It was perfect. The pan sauce you make when deglazing is divine. Word of advice: I failed to open a window when cooking this. When you cook cabbage and onion for almost an hour and then cook pork, the house will really have an odor. Sure, this is lovely as it cooks, but waking up with it the next morning.....not so much. Overall: Great dish and we will make it again.

Great recipe for a quick weeknight dinner or for entertaining! I serve it with couscous and ALWAYS get compliments. The cabbage is great to use with other dishes as well.

I rated only the cabbage part of this recipe. I served it with pork lion stuffed with broccoli rabe. It was amazing. Big hit!

What an excellent way to use up a lot of cabbage! Make it even easier by making the cabbage in a crock pot (low, 6-8 hrs). Then come dinnertime you only have the chops and gravy to make. I found the cabbage needed just a little salt to taste, but perfect for balsamic lovers! Fear not, Rochester, this is still low- fat and healthy because pan-frying is not like deep-frying and olive oil is a good fat. Get lean chops, good balsamic, and don't listen to the apple and caraway folks. Make it as is. Put your favorite bread roll on the side to pick up the juices. Yum!

This was delicious -- simple, rustic and full of flavour. I replaced the marjoram with oregano and served it with a side of yukon gold mashed potatoes and a dollop of horseradish -- yum. I will definitely make it again. It's important to use thick, good-quality balsamic or the red cabbage will be less zingy.

I make red cabbage a fair amount and I liked this recipe a lot better than my standard (apple cider vinegar & caraway seeds). I added apple to the cabbage and fresh sage to both pork chops and cabbage. really yummy and easy.

This dish was very good. Never really cooked with red cabbage. It did take a while to soften the cabbage mix I ended up turning the heat up and adding a little water to facilitate. Chops and sauce were yummy! Will definitely make again - nice to have a low cal - low fat dish that is hearty and delish.

Simple, savory weeknight dinner. Always well-received. The balsamic really makes this dish.

The only trouble I had with this recipe is that it seemed to need more olive oil, which, of course, added to the fat content. I used a little beer (about 1/4 cup of a pale ale) in with the cabbage and two sliced apples. I used an imported Italian organic balsamic vinegar, and the flavor was pretty wonderful.

This was actually a lot better than all the reviews made it sound. The cabbage was delicious and the porkchops tender! I used herbs de provence instead of marjoram as that is all I had on hand and it was fabulous!

I've made this dish twice. If you have any leftovers, the pork--sliced--with the cabbage makes a great sandwich on crunchy toasted french bread.

Ok folks, let's put on our thinking caps here. How can we take a *fried* *pork* chop, and make it "low fat"? By keeping the portion size sane, m'thinks. So, to fill our greedy bellies, this offers low fat fiber in the cabbage. The deepest flavors are *supposed* to come from the chops and the balsamic. Now, I'm a mexican food specialist, so I'm particularly sensitive to "bland", and I nearly didn't make this recipe because of prior reviews. I'm glad I followed my hunch. This is tremendously good. I might suggest that if your results were "bland" or overly "vinegar-ey" that your balsamic was of a poor quality. I used the good stuff, and this was richly flavorful, and I could actually convince myself I was eating light & healthy!

I really liked this dish. I didn't use quite as much cabbage (a little over a third of a large head) and it didn't take 50 minutes at all...only about 25. So, not only is it healthy, it's quick. The perfect weeknight meal. I'll change a couple of things the next time I make it. First, I'll add the garlic to the cabbage after it's wilted a bit. When I added it with the cabbage, it burnt before the cabbage was done. Secondly, I'll probably use a little less balsamic vinegar. I enjoyed the tang, but on both the cabbage and in the pork sauce, it overwhelmed the other flavors a bit. Other than that, hearty, healthy, quick...can't beat it!

Taking a cue from the other reviewers, who commented on the bland flavor, I doubled the balsamic vinegar with the cabbage and with the pork, sauteed an apple with the cabbage, added about a teaspoon of caraway seeds, and also sauteed about 4 oz of bacon and added that to the cabbage. Certainly not as light as the original recipe, but quite tasty

I loved the cabbage part of this recipe I've made it many times. I don't remember the pork chop thing. But I added a little extra vinegar and marjarom. I always wish I make more. It's a great cabbage recipe.

As a few others wrote, I don't think the dish was anything special. Sure, I like the combination of red cabbage and pork, but I think you could find better recipes out there.

Added apples, caraway seeds and used apple cider vinegar. Our family loved it.

This was very good but I like a little more contrast in flavors so I changed a few things. I used marjoram and apple cider vinegar in the cabbage (along with apples and caraway seeds). To season the pork chops I substituted sage for marjoram and added an extra tbsp of balsamic vinegar to deglaze the pan and make the sauce. I served plain baked yams with this and it was very hearty and the flavors worked well together.

This recipe is excellent! Definitely add the apple and carraway seed to the cabbage -- I think it adds important flavor. Also, I didn't have marjoram, so I used my Italian Spice mix (which has marjoram as one of many ingredients) and it was wonderful. My husband doesn't usually like pork chops (he thinks they are too dry), but he loved this recipe! I will definitely make this again -- plus, it is very healthy and easy to make!

The recipe was very good. Will make it again. I did substitute green cabbage for the red cabbage because that what I had in the house at the time. Next time will make it with red cabbage to have a better appearance.

I rate this as a 4 because of the ease, healthiness, and great combo of flavors. I have to admit that I did add a sliced apple and caraway seeds to the cabbage. But my husband and 5 year olds ate the whole thing!
