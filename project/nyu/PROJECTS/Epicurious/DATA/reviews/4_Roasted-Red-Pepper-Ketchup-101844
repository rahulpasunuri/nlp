Very tasty! I used two roasted bell peppers and three roasted garlic cloves. Post blender, I added two extra tablespoons of brown sugar, and at least a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to bring out the flavor. WARNING: I only cooked the sauce for 30 minutes, and after I ran the fennel seeds through the blender, they felt like bits of shredded wood in my mouth. Took care of the problem by pushing the sauce through a sieve. Next time, I'll cook the sauce longer or tie up the fennel in cheese cloth and remove before blending.

Absolutly awsome. Not a thing I would change except The cook time. One reviewer was right about letting it simmer an hour. And no, the fennel doesnt make it taste the way you would think that much fennel would make anything taste. Good to put it in the food procesor while hot, as it will run down to the blade easier after its splattered, just dont try it while its still bubbling. And F.Y.I., anchos are also known as pablanos. Dont skip these, they all but make the recipe.

I also used Muir Glenn fire roasted diced tomatoes and roasted two red bell peppers. I did not stop there. I also roasted the garlic and onion. Roasted vegetables are our friends.

YUMMY! I roasted my own bell peppers. At first I thought the fennel might be a bit much, but once it all came together it was perfect. I didn't have any red onions so I used brown. I also cooked the mixture for 30 min with the lid on to release all the flavors and 30 min with the lid off to concentrate and carmelize the flavors. I'm not sure if it added anything, but I also used Muir Glenn fire roasted diced tomatoes. I plan on serving this with the polenta fries tomorrow.

I've made cranberry catsup, concord grape catsup, and this is a nice addition to the catsup making experience! Nice and spicy. I used fresh tomatoes and roasted the peppers fresh, since it's summer. Wonder if yellow tomatoes and yellow peppers would be appetizing?
