This was a great recipe, fantastic results in surprisingly little time. The whole thing, including clean-up, took under an hour. The one problem I had was that there was definetely not enough liquid in the biscuit dough perhaps because of variation in creme fraiche? I just added about a tablespoon of milk bit by bit until the dough came together. It didn't look terribly pretty but they were still delicious. This recipe is worth it for sure!
