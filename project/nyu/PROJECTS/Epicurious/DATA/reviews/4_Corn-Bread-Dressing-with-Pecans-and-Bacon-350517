My family LOVED this stuffing. Picky nephews, too. Cut the recipe by 1/3 and still had lots of left overs with 8 people. I'll make the cornbread a couple of days in advance next time. Will also try adding some apple as other folks have recommended. I will definitely make this one again!

Have made this for the last two years. Delicious. Last year I added sweet Italian sausage for double meaty goodness - the fennel in the sausage adds a nice dimension. This year I will try the apple suggestion.

Excellent dressing recipe. As a previous user suggested, I made it with the Buttermilk Cornbread recipe from this site. Followed this exactly as written, and the only change I would make in the future is to make it a day ahead of time and then bake it the day I wanted to serve it. I think it would benefit from sitting uncooked overnight in the 'fridge.

Used this for Thanksgiving w/ minor changes. Used sourdough bread instead of plain white bread, no parsley, all bacon fat instead of butter (did not make it greasy) Did NOT stir it half way thru, and did not cover with foil, and let the top get a little crispy. Also added two small gala apples as I was using this with the cider brined Turkey recipe also on this site. Rave reviews from all!

I am giving this 3 forks--I liked it a lot and bf loved--I prefer sausage dressing, but the bacon was a nice change. I halved the recipe and still ended up with a full 9x11 pan. It was very moist, which was really nice for leftovers as it re-heated well. Will make again!

I didn't add apples because I have some family members who don't like fruit (odd, I know). I only used about 5/8 cup of bacon fat and folloowing other suggestions, went with 4 1/2 cups of broth. I thought this was very tasty and family really liked it.

This turned out great, I was worried that it was going to be too much chicken stock because it seemed so soggy right up to the last few minutes in the oven.

Just had this for thanksgiving...it was really dry and no one really loved it. Lacked flavor also. Very little veggie to bread ratio and I added apples too. Need to find a good stuffing. This one was deffinately not it.

Excellent - moist and flavorful. Only added 1/2 the bacon and 1/2 the butter. Also, used no nitrite turkey bacon.

I too added apple. It was great. I made a half a batch and put 1 gala in.

Just amazing. I used 1 lb of hickory bacon and 1/2 lb of applewood since I had extra. I added 4 gala apples like the reviewer below suggested and the added sweetness was divine. I like my dressing dry and crumbly so I decreased the chicken stock to 4 cups. Even better the next day. The buttermilk corn bread recipe on this site makes a great base. Cut it into large chunks and let it dry out for a day or so.

If you add fresh chopped apples to this receipe you get my Texas Grandmothers dressing that is out of this world. Just chop apples with skin, (red add extra color) and toss into dressing just before you put into the oven.

If you toast the pecans for the 10-12 minutes called for in the recipe, you'll have a bitter, burned-nut flavor in the dressing. Yum! Try 3-5 minutes. (I'd stay close to 3 and keep alert for signs of burning.)
