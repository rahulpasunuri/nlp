Oh! An important factor: Make sure you use a red wine vinegar with a high percentage of actual vinegar in it. One time I used Progresso's brand and I thick the percentage was 10%. It may seem trivial, but even at 12% the sweetnees is cut back considerably. 15% for me is the way to go.

Best recipe on this site, hands down. I soak for 5 days but other than that as is fulfills every Oktoberfest need you've had......even if it's in April! I pair this with the nutmeg spaetzle recipe and red wine braised cabbage with bacon recipe, both on this site. Absolutely perfect.

I served Clancy's Shiraz/Cab/Merlot blend with sauerbraten, and it was a great success, even (especially!) to the wine enthusiasts at the table. It also went well with an icnredibly rich chocolate tart, the recipe for which is chef Tyler Florence's.

Very Good with a wonderful aroma, I advise instead of baking to boil in the marinade for 3-4 hours at a gentle boil. Replace the brown sugar with white sugar at 2 tablespoons and use 1/2 cup of crumbled ginger snaps. Other than that I rated it 3 out of 4 forks, very nice recipe. Will make again.

I don't know what we did wrong, but this was tough as leather. The flavor of the sauce was good but the meat...

This recipe is a poor sister to the very simple and much more authentic one in "How to Cook Everything" by Mark Bittman. The gingersnap is an irritating addition in this recipe, sorry. It also goes against the historical roots of this dish. This is a winter dish, where you can use the root vegetables that you've had in your cellar with a piece of meat that's not the best. It should stand simply, borrowing 'topping' flavors from the vegetables like sweet carrot and being tempered by parsnip and celery. Vegetables should be used in the marinade and fresh ones added later in the cooking process. The central note should be a savory aged beef flavor that's warm and homey, with a slight interesting sour note. Brown sugar and gingersnap-- unnecessary frill to distract from the shoddy recipe. Marinate 5 days for more of a deeper flavor.

Cooked this for 120 people for an Oktoberfest. Got very good reviews. The only thing I would suggest is that a meat temperature should be given rather than until tender. I thought the meat for the cut was a bit over done and tough. Sitting in the sauce 2 hrs before serving saved it.

This is NOT classic Sauerbraten. Yet I noticed the fork rating, so I read the reviews. All who rated this highly had turned it into a classic Sauerbraten by changing the water to wine and the cider vinegar to red wine vinegar. These basic changes will make a big difference in the meat and the gravey. My German mother never used the gingersnaps in her receipe, so I don't either, just thicken with some cornstarch mixed with water.

Not a favorite. I have another recipe that cooks the roast with the sauce and it turns out much more flavorful and moist. I reduced the amount of sugar and it was still bordering on too sweet.

I'm not a great cook, but someone gave me 2 2 1/2 lb moose roasts. It was good customer and couln't say no. I searched this site for "Moose Meat" recipes, and came up blank. After keeping them in the freezer for 3 mos, not knowing what to do with them, I decided to sour them. Being German, my Mom used to sour anything gamey or unusual. I tried this recipe and fed it to my husband and son. We almost finished the whole thing. I served it with red cabbage and potato dumplings (a usual at my house growing up). I will certainly make the second one the same way. I did add the wine and marinade for at least 3 days as suggested.

I made this yesterday for a German-themed dinner and it was delish. I marinated the meat for two days, replacing the water in the recipe with a nice red wine ($20 bottle) and used red wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar. It was really good. The only other thing I did differently was that I used vegetable stock instead of beef and added some cornstarch to the gravy to thicken it up a bit. I even added the ginger snaps but can't say that I could taste them or they had any significant affect on the dish. Make this! It's fun and easy.

I marinated this for five days and all I got was sour beef in greasy gravy.

Great tips! Mother in law is from Bavaria so I used other reviewers tips on good German white wine; good white wine vinegar. I also used fresh ginger and a TB of pickling spices from gourmet market. I also cheated and used Knorr brown gravy mix with the marinade to make a wonderful gavy for my mashed red potatoes. Used other reviewers tip and made red cabbage with green apples- my teens and mother-in-law LOVED it. Used the BEST cut of beef at my butcher. THANKS Epicurious users for all of the great advice!

This recipe was so easy to make I am giving it as a gift to my father-in-law to make. And he is just starting to learn to cook. I have changed the water to Nice Red Wine by Chateau Chantal Traverse City, MI(for more fruity and Naughty red wine for more dry) and changed the vinegar to red wine vinegar. With these changes it resembled sauerbraten we had on the Rhine. Use gingersnaps recipe from www.penseys.com it gives it extra punch.

Although the meat turned out tender and tasty, I was very disappointed in the sauce, which was too sweet (even without the brown sugar) and not "meaty" enough for my tastes. Overall the recipe was a disappointment to me.

For many years there was a local pub that specialized in sauerbraten, perfected by a German couple. They retired and since then have never had really good sauerbraten. I tried this recipe, adjusting a little from previous ratings, and it was the ABSOLUTE BEST I have had in years! Yes it is time consuming, but worth every minute of the fuss. Wouldn't be sauerbraten without the time involved. I omitted the water and combined 2 cups of red wine vinegar, 1-1/2 cups dry white wine, and and 1/2 cup of white vinegar (all of good quality). I also omitted the the brown sugar. I served this over noodles with braised red cabbage (also on this site). The whole meal was wonderful, and my husband, who is of German decent, loved it.

I liked this recipe a lot. Thanks to former reviewers for suggestions. I substituted red wine for water and marinated five days. I served with reb cabbage sauteed in butter with granny smith apples, apple cider and brown sugar (my German friend gave me her grandmother's recipe). It was delicious.

This was my first attempt at Sauerbraten.It is not easy to master. I was disappointed, however I now know what I did wrong and I will try again. Use red wine instead of water, let marinate 3 - 5 days, make sure to turn meat 2-3 times a day. Add some liquid to the pan as a braising liquid..when done let the roast rest in the liquid. The gravy is much to sweet, add small amounts of brown sugar to taste , I think the gingersnaps will be all the sweetness you will need. I did find the second day it was much better. Next time I will make a day ahead and reheat.

I tested this out on family before a dinner party and it was fabulous. Instead of the water, I used red wine and I marinated it for 5 days in the fridge. I served it with spaetzle and red cabbage and a nice German wine. The leftovers were just as good and tender days later!

This was very disappointing. I marinated and cooked exactly according to the recipe. The meat was tough and the sauce was too sweet, even though I'd cut down on the brown sugar & gingersnaps. I have a recipe for Bavarian Sauerbraten that calls for the meat to be cooked in with the marinade like a pot roast. I'll use that from here on out. Don't waste your time with this one.

Three German citizens live in my home and we serve this recipe to guests. I suggest cooking the meat longer than two hours (to make sure it is tender). Also, feel free to substitute wine for the water in the marinade. The longer the meat marinates, the more sour it becomes.

This recipie was fantastic. I replaced the water with a sweet red wine and also added about 2tbs of sour cream to the sauce at the end. I omitted half the brown sugar and it was lovely. I work at a fine dinning restaurant and I passed this recipe to the chef to replace his.

I used red wine instead of half the water, and a chuck roast instead of a rump roast, and the result was excellent. No leftovers even.

I grew up near this restaurant and ate this almost every time we visited the Ox Yoke Inn. When I make it at home, I add a few tablespoons of sour cream to the sauce. If it's too sour, a few more gingersnaps do the trick. Or, if sour cream isn't used, add a little ketchup if you want a sweeter, sauce.

Use a chuck roast instead. Also, instead of water, I used beer, with a little water. I added a bit of sherry and used 1/2 & 1/2 cider vinegar/white wine vinegar.

We followed the suggestions of the last reviewer and used white wine vinegar and a rhine whine. We add 1/2 tsp. who;e allspice, a 3 inch stick of cinnamon broken into pieces and 1 tsp. of coarsely chopped fresh ginger to the marinade. As cooking liquid , we used the strained marinade wuth 2 leeks ( white parts only), 1 small omion, 1 large carrot thinly sloced and 1 rib of celery thinly sliced.We add a pinch of ground allspice, cinnamon and ginger at this stage. Although we made this roast on the stove, oven braising works well also. The final sauce is strained and thickened with gingersnaps.We add 2 tbso. of unsulphured mollases at this stage and sweeten with brown sugar to taste.The sauce will need to be thickened with flour, cornstarch or arrowroot , approximately 2 tbsp. Overall, this is one of our fa

This is pretty typical for a Bavarian style Sauerbraten recipe. My family is from the Rhineland (Cologne). To give this more of Rhinelander flair (which I think is better); use a HIGH quality white wine vinegar (something you'd buy in a specialty market with a good wine flavor - NOT that stuff you normally find in a supermarket - this is absolutly the KEY to great sauerbraten). The liquid for the marinade should be half vinegar and the other half should be a Rhine or Mossel white wine (about 2 cups each), not water. Add 2 tablespoons sugar to the marinade. The other ingredients are fine. Marinade the roast for 5-6 days in the refrigerator, not two. Strain the marinade, brown the roast well, add 2-3 cleaned chopped leaks, an onion, some celery and the strained marinade to the pot. Simmer 3 hours on the stove top covered. Remove the roast, keep warm, strain the liquid again, return to the pot and thicken with ground gingersnaps (about 1/2 to 3/4 cups of crumbs). Season with salt to taste. Leave out the sugar, it's too sweet!

I really liked this dish and followed the instructions except I used a rump roast. The lemom added to the flavor and is somthing that I have not tried before. When making the brine I add a few whole Juniper berries.
