Made this for dinner tonight and it was wonderful! The flavors blended perfectly. Added a bit of hot sauce at the table and that was great as well. Thanx

Made this last night after reading raving reviews. Didn't care for the combination fennel, olives and eggs. Sorry folks, but I cook a LOT and make a new recipe almost daily and enjoy a huge variety of foods so I'm not inexperienced or a fussy eater.

Great recipe! Had it for dinner - quick and easy. I exchanged the dill for basil and it was amazing!

What a wonderful Sunday brunch. We substituted Kalamata in brine for the green olives.

this was the first time i made an omelet. it was somewaht easy to make but a pain to flip. i think if i made it into 2 omelets instead of one big one, it wouldn't have stuck to the pan.it was delicious even though it didn't look like the picture. i don't think it needed the fennel fonds.

This is absolutely delicious and simple. A perfect supper dish. Other than substituting dried dill for fresh I wouldn't change a thing.

This was a great Saturday evening dinner. My husband really likes fennel but I was a little worried that it may overpower the entire dish. To my surprise, the licorice taste of the fennel was very subtle. A very nice change from normal omelets. I damaged my non-stick pan so I made it as an oven-baked omelet and it was delicious.
