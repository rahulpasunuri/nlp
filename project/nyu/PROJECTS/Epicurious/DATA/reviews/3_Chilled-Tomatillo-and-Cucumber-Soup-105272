I used nonfat Greek yogurt instead of the cream, and it was great. No need for the added sat fat.

This is a recipe that is truly a sum of its parts. If you loathe cilantro or don't like a little heat from peppers, skip it. If not, it is a tasty, complex, perfect-for-summer delight. Nothing difficult here, and it would be a great thing to do ahead and take in a cooler for a picnic appetizer.

This recipe was easy to make (although time consuming). I used 3 poblanos instead of 2 and less cucumber and more tomatillos. I also substituted vegetable broth for the chix broth (my husband is vegetarian). Plenty of kick and a nice hot summer alternative.

This soup was the hit of my summer. No one could guess the ingredients (vinegar? sorrel?), but they lapped it up. It's extraordinarily refreshing. I tried it with and without polblanos and decided I liked it better without. It didn't make much difference whether I used heavy cream, plain nonfat yoghurt or even fat- free half-and-half (an abomination, I know, but it worked). It was creamy and delicious in all three cases. I sprinkled the top with chives. I'm going to make some of this to freeze and try it hot in the winter.

This recipe was 3x more complicated than my basic cucumber soup recipe, with no added benefits. The poblanos were not detectible, and the flavor of lime and cilantro were not strong enough. My recipe is for 3 cucumbers, 2 tsp vinegar, 3 T cream of wheat and chicken broth. Add dill and sour cream before serving and it's much better (though not gluten free).

My husband has made this recipe at least a dozen times and each time it gets better. Everyone marvels at the rich flavors of the chiles, cucumber, cream and cilantro! We look forward to serving it every summer when it's too hot to cook!

This soup is made even more interesting by using 3 poblano peppers instead of 2. The extra pepper kicks up the taste of the bland tomatillos to make it a really remarkable appetizer.

We love this soup. I first tried it last summer and went back to it again this summer. To cut down on calories, I substitute non-fat sour cream for the whipping cream, adding it to the blender when pureeing the vegetables. I like it best when made a day ahead.

I've made this soup twice. My family said it was a "keeper". My husband dislikes cillantro and tart foods but loved the soup. Many thanks for your site--don't change a thing. We have a beach house and a country house and with this site I don't have to transport cookbooks back and forth. I especially like "My Recipe File".

I kept on trying to convince myself that i liked this soup but even though i added extra chilis it was still bland and just rather odd.

The tomatillos made the soup too sour, which was nasty with the chicken broth and cream. Might be better with more cucumber, less tomatillo...it really needed more sweetness and fire to balance out the acidity.

I thought it was too much like Salse Verde with a creamy texture. In fact most of the recipe is like my favorite homemade salsa verde recipe. It may be better with the cucmbers not pureed as much maybe?

Wonderful summer dish, it it needed salt and pepper. To keep it totally low fat, substituted the cream with non fat yoghurt. Everyone at my dinner party raved about it.

I doubled the recipe for a larger crowd. It has quite a spicey bite from the jalepeno, which makes for an interesting "hot/cold" experience. I added a bit more cold pureed cucumber at the end, and put the soup in the freezer for a few minutes prior to serving for a good chill. Everyone loved it.

We found this to be very refreshing for a hot Arizona supper. Some fresh fruit and cheese made it a meal.

I was disappointed; it's surprisingly bland.

I did this recipe for my Gourmet group that meets once a month. We all enjoyed it. It is cool and refreshing on a warm summer day. Will make it again, for sure. And my husband liked it, too.

I feel kind of bad as I haven't tried this receipe, but plan to get the ingredients tomorrow and make it. The combination of spices and veggies sound wonderful and refreshing. My son just moved back in with me for a short time and he works out in the hot sun all day, so I thought this would be healthy and tasty for him.
