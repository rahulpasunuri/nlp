This is my go to recipe when I entertain. I have never had a morsel left on a plate. It is a four fork for sure!

Very simple and tasty. Looking forward to having it tomorrow when the flavors have had more time to meld. I'm sure that this will be a often prepared recipe as time goes by. Next time I will double the recipe as I only ended up with 3 cups of soup, not five. Perhaps I'll simmer the lentils less than 30 to 40 minutes next time and see if I get the 5 cups the recipe states is the yield.

I am only giving this two forks because I made extensive changes, and without it this would not have been as good. I didn't have any carrot on hand, so I doubled the celery, garlic, and red pepper. I also added ginger, tumeric and salt. I simmered the lentils in 100% chicken broth (homemade) with half a stick of cinnamon, three bay leaves, about 1/2 tbs of cumin, and some salt. I added tumeric and forgot the pepper when sauteeing the veggies. This turned out to be delicious, but more of a stew than a soup, so I served it over some couscous. It was a great, healthy comfort meal. I will definitely be making it again.

My husband and I loved this soup. It was very easy to make and the results were delightful. The play of the flavors on my tongue and the various textures were a delight. I did add more carrot, celery and red bell pepper but you can never have too many veggies. I did use the immersion blend just a touch to thicken the soup but kept the veggies cooked but still firm. I will make this again.

This was a good fall soup. I made only a few small changes: ground pepper rather than peppercorns, and a little more celery and carrot. I also cooked it much longer than suggested: about 5 hours on low with the slow cooker.

I made this with RED lentils. It looked as delicious as it tasted.

I like this soup because it's healthy and tasty, but it's not nice looking (pureed or chunky). Make it for it's nutrition, but not for it's appearance!

I used whole fennel instead of celery, added chickpeas, and a dash each of ground clove and cinnamon, very tasty.

Just delicious is my verdict. I used commercial vegetable broth but tripled the recipe to feed a big family. I boosted the flavor by upping spice quantities and added a tablespoon of diced fresh ginger and a teaspoon of turmeric and served it over cubed tofu for a nifty one-dish meal.

My vegetarian son ate three servings. As his diet is pretty uninspiring (college cafeteria), any non-veggie lasagna recipes are very welcomed. Of course, I use vege broth, not animal-based stocks. I strained the puree for soup, and then served the pulp with brown rice, later.

This tastes good but looks bad. Honestly, I don't think I'll serve this again because of its appearance. Plus, I doubled the spices, and it still wasn't very flavorful. I like lentils a lot, but there are too many other great ways to prepare them.

This was very good (as well as very healthy). As I live in Luxembourg, green French lentils are readily available. Used all chicken stock instead of half stock/half water (had a lot to use it up) Skipped the spice grinding (life is too short) and used pre-ground cumin and fresh ground pepper instead. Topped soup with a swirl of creme fraiche and served with French bread and green salad. Hearty and satisfying.

This recipe was very good, but I would alter a couple of things. Namely, more of the same seasonings and more veggies. I'll make this again.
