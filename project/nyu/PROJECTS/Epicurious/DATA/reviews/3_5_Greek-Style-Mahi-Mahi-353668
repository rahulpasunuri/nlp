Only giving this recipe a 3 because we did not have all the ingredients. This dish was delicious and a hit at our table! So glad I found this recipe and will definitely make this meal again! It was fun and so easy to make.

I was tired of having Mahi Mahi the same old way and this looked a little different. I didn't use the tomatoes and it was still delicious. I had some lemon olive oil and finished it with that which added a nice boost. I also started it in the over and finished it under the broiler to get the nice charred lemons. I only did that because I had some potatoes roasting in the over at the same time.I will definitely make again.

halved the mayo and added 1/2 Cup authentic greek yogurt. This was an excellent dish.

YUM! I followed the other reviewers suggestions and used plain Greek yogurt instead of mayo. I also added cucumber to the tomatoes and used my own vinaigrette. Will definitely make again

Made this with tilapia using Greek yogurt. I used balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar - excellent. If I were to make it again, I would use some white balsamic vinegar in the topping.

Very good flavor for such a quick and easy recipe. I used greek yogurt instead of mayo -- didn't have fresh dill so subbed fresh tarragon along with the fresh mint. Didn't have greek feta, but used fresh Hungarian feta which has a smooth, sour lemony flavor and isn't as 'briney' as greek feta. Even with the minor substitution the flavor really came through. Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe to the tee--no problems. I also roasted some compari tomatoes with the fish, then added them to a cucumber onion salad that sat in a vinegar base. Side dish was the toasted orzo with Saffron (note on that recipe that the 1/2 cup Orzo should actually be 1.5 cups--huge error, but the trusty reviewers who tried the dish figured it out!)

This was very flavorful, quick and easy to make. I did substitute tilapia for the mahi mahi.

We found a wonderful mahi fillet and used this recipe for a family gathering. There were no leftovers. The sauce was wonderful and had just begun to brown, the fish was flakey, and the conversation was filled with warm, family laughter. It doesn't get any better than this.

oh yes, and i did 2% greek yogurt instead of mayo which made more sense to me and was yummier/healthier

forget the mahi, this worked much better with lemon sole

I'm not a big mayo fan, so I used greek yogurt (Fage 2%), and it turned out great. Trick is to use a thick yogurt so consistency is the same. Also, I added chopped cucumber to the tomato salad, which added variety.

Rating: 4
I didn't make the little tomato salad to go with it, but found the fish quite good. The feta was pretty strong, but balanced nicely with the dill and mint. My oven takes much longer than other ovens because it's from the past but that's ok. I would make it again but maybe use more of a steak fish like swordfish or something.

Excellent dish! Made it just as written. All ingredients complimented each other and made for an extremely flavorful fish dish. We were licking our plates.

Very good, I used less mayo and extra yogurt - it was very rich in flavor. We loved it

Rating: 3
Very good! I made this with tilapia, and broiled for only 9-10 minutes. I also added the tomatoes into the pan, so they cooked a bit while broiling. The sauce was delicious. I used 1/4 plain yogurt with the mayo. Maybe it was a bit soupy overall, but it's tilapia and the tomatoes were juicy. Served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it.

Super yummy, super simple! The store didn't have Dill, but I used the fresh mint! I used a little extra feta. I did not use any salt. I used lemon pepper. My family said it was the best thing I ever made. Kinda sounds like it might be an insult to the rest of my cooking. Next time I will use less mayo.

What an easy throw together recipe. Had everything but the feta so used cojita cheese. Can't wait to make this again using feta! The tomatoes were an excellent side and I would love to try the toasted orzo with saffron and fennel. Served with roasted new potatoes with rosemary and garlic. Checked the fish at 10 mins an covered with foil that last few minutes. So moist and flavorful.

The fish came out moist and flavorful. My husband (not a fish eater) had seconds. This will be hitting our table again.

Came home late and wanted to try something different. Followed the recipe except added lots of fresh dill and parsley. It was yummy creamy and there wsa no need for extra salt. Next time I am going to try it with Greek yogurt to cut the calories, Served it with chopped arugla, cucumber, tomato salad wth some kalamata olives and left over iraeli cousous,

I only had a very small amount of mint, and I did not have any fresh dill, so I used fresh oregano and tarragon instead. Amazing results! Very delicious fish recipe.

Rating: 4
I really liked this and it is a very quick weeknight meal. It has a great flavor and was more interesting than simply baking the fish and very easy to halve for two people. Thanks for all the great suggestions. Greek yogurt worked really well. I am not a huge dill fan, so went with mint only, and I think that also was a good choice. I just finished baking something at 400 degrees, so my oven was hot. I only had to broil for 10 minutes, and I will do it this way on purpose next time, since I think it gave me better/even heat.

Loved this! Worked well with salmon too. I was out of dill but had everything else on hand. Fantastic even without the dill.

Rating: 3
this is a lovely simple recipe. this was my first time cooking mahimahi. i usually prefer much thiner fish fillets but i was surprised how much i liked this. i didnt make the tomatoes, but served this with the toasted orzo as others recommended. i used fat free greek yoghurt instead of mayo which my fellow diners agreed was a better choice. i added a little more lemon juice, and the olive oil directly to the mixture.

A very good and easy recipe. I decided to cook the tomatoes with the fish for the last few minutes and it was delicious. I also served it with the recommended side dish - toasted orzo with fennel and steamed green beans. The plate looked as wonderful as the dish tasted. Easy enough for a family night dinner - fancy enough for company.

I used Greek Yogurt and used cilantro instead of dill (because I didn't have dill on hand). It was very easy to make, and everyone loved it.

My teenage son doesn't usually like fish, but he took a second helping and raved about the taste. Used dried herbs and therefore reduced quanity to 1 Tbsp each.

I loved this recipe! The mayo herb mix really sealed in the moisture of the fish and the fresh mint flavor really enhanced mahi. My sigo who is not much of a fish lover really enjoyed it as well. I halved the recipe and probably put some extra lemon juice. Next time I probably will use foil instead of parchment (burned and smoked) and might broil the skin side a bit before turning over and covering with the topping. I'm not much of a fan of soggy fish skin.

I loved the fish. Very quick and easy to make. One note, if you have leftovers, throw away the lemon slices. It makes the fish bitter where the slices have laid.

Rating: 3
Relatively easy to throw together and tasty. I increased the amount of feta in the topping because I though it was a little too mayonnaisy. Turned out great. The lemon slices on top are pretty but I don't think they were necessary flavor-wise.

Rating: 3
I really liked this recipe, I used 1/2 greek yogurt and 1/2 low fat mayo and the flavor was good. I also used a feta that had lemon, garlic and oregano. I substituted fresh oregano for some of the mint since we have such a huge oregano bed outside and was happy with the flavor. Even the teenagers ate it, a ringing endorsement. I am a Weight Watcher and it was low in points and a good way to get a fish meal. I made an orzo pasta salad to serve along with it with red pepper, zuccini squash, red onion, feta, kalamata olives and a dressing of olive oil, lemon juice and herbs.

Despite all the great reviews, I was surprised by this recipe. It was outstanding! I did not even have the fresh dill, so I had to substitute cilantro... I imagine that if I had dill, the combination of flavors would have been even better.

Don't know who that last cook was as this is a great recipe. We slice the lemons very thin so they almost get chewy and crunchie and oh so good! Am waiting for someone to pipe back in who has tried replacing the mayo with greek yogurt as we're always looking for healthier solutions.

Gross. We did not enjoy this at all. Followed the recipe as written, and we love all of the ingredients individually, but the fish just tasted wrong. Never again.

We made this with fresh mahimahi and did on the grill, so top didn't really brown making the lemons kind of pointless, but we enjoyed the taste. Used fresh mint from garden, but had to resort to dried dill..oh well. I like the idea of using greek yogurt instead of mayo and add zest and garlic to that. Served with toasted orzo & fennel side dish as suggested. Nice quick dinner.

Rating: 3
I would actually give this 3 1/2 stars because it was so easy to make and the result was so delicious. I added more feta, extra mint and lemon juice and zest in the feta. Also, MahiMahi not available here so I used another white flesh fish and it was great. Also, because this was for my book club and I couldn't be in the kitchen keeping a close eye on it, I didn't broil it but simply baked it in the oven. It was so good that one of the attendees, a vegan, succombed to temptation and thoroughly enjoyed it! Will definitely make again and again, as the effort/reward ratio is excellent.

I made this as written (along with the orzo as a side dish) and it was a huge hit. My 2-year-old liked the fish and my husband raved about the meal to a friend later that night. Thickness of the fish used will definitely vary the time needed to cook completely, so keep an eye on it.

I made this recipe recently, and it was a hit with my extended family. I substituted our local, fresh-caught, northern Lake Michigan whitefish for the mahimahi; and omitted the mint. This is destined to be one of our family's regular preparations for whitefish.

I liked this very much, although it seemed a little rich for a summer dinner. I wonder how Greek yogurt would fare as a substitute for mayo?

Very nice fish recipe. The Poker Guys liked it, but will experiment with other fish types though next time i make it.

We liked the flavors of this but the feta and herb quotient could have been upped. I used halibut since mahi mahi wasn't available. It was nice but not fantastic. If you want to have lemons on top for presentation, put fresh slices on when you ready to serve. I also like lemon slices under the fish to stop the skin from sticking. The tomatoes were fine--I used Campari tomatoes which had lots of flavor. Just before serving I tossed in some cucumber chunks. It was certainly quick and simple to make.

Rating: 4
This got a thumbs up all the way around the table at my house and will definitely be made again. I took the suggestion of adding a clove of garlic to the mayonnaise and thought that gave it an extra level of flavor. Next time I would tweak the tomatoes though as they were a bit bland. Maybe do a Greek salad sort of treatment with feta, Kalamata olives, mint and dill. I would also seed them before I cut them.

We're familiar with various mayo& herb-topped baked fish dishes, and as feta fans, were eager to try this. Couldn't avoid two modifications. . . . Mahi-mahi wasn't available, so we substituted true cod. We also zested most of a lemon into the mayo-feta mixture and, like another reviewer didn't salt the fish because the feta was salty enough. We enjoyed it as we made it -- the sauce was moist and tasty. We thought the lemon slices were pretty but bitter and in the way -- next time we'll add lemon juice to the sauce and skip the slices. A good, easy, and new recipe for fish!

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe, and I found it to have tons of flavor, unlike at least one reviewer. Using a quality feta is key here, and upping the herbs quotient is just fine, as well as using plenty of lemon juice. It's definitely better than pan sauteeing the fish and making a sauce separately.

Rating: 4
This recipe is delicious! I only made one modification, I used Chilean Sea Bass instead of Mahi Mahi. I recommend using whatever similar white fish is the freshest at the fish market. Mahi Mahi isn't necessary for this dish to taste good, all you need is a fresh white fish that has a semi-meaty texture.

Rating: 3
We liked this. The feta gets toned down during the cooking process though and I like feta. I did not have enough mint though so next time I will be sure I have enough! I also used 1/4 cup mayonnaise instead of 1/2 and it was still very creamy.

Rating: 4
Restaurant quality meal! I made this dish using red snapper as suggested and adding garlic to the topping. My husband and I raved about the dish saying it was worthy of a restaurant meal. Also made the orzo with fennel and served the tomatoes alongside. Definitely something I'll make again and will serve to our guests also.

This was delicious. I wasn't keen on the mayo but decided to stick to the recipe and it didn't have a mayo flavor just a yummy topping on the fish. We're putting this in regular rotation.

This fish was truly awful. The mahi-mahi is, of itself, without much flavor or character. Unfortunately, the topping added very little to the character. The recipe appears to be very appealing, but it is very, very disappointing. The recipe devisers should be truly ashamed.

I made this recipe using Red Snapper filets, added one clove crushed garlic to mayo mixture and a TBSP chopped fresh Italian parsley to the tomatoes. It was pretty tasty, and had a very nice presentation, but my husband wasn't all that impressed.

When a friend gave us some fresh- caught mahi mahi I had no idea what to do with it. I found this recipe and since we really like Greek food I gave it a try. Unfortunately I discovered after I had already started that I had used up all the feta so I substituted freshly grated parmesan. Everything else was as written in the recipe. A creamy, savory topping is just right for the mild fish and tomatoes are a nice contrasting flavor and color.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious!!! Great way to use some of the mint and dill that are growing really fast right now. I added a little extra feta (just under a half cup) and didn't salt the fish as there's enough salt in the feta. The tomatoes are a nice balance with the feta. Even my really picky husband loved it. I'll definitely make this often.
