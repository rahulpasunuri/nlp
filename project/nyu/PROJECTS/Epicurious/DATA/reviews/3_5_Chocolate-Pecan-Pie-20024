I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup and frangelica in lieu of the vanilla with a rich dark chocolate rather than chips. It was a real hit - very rich but very yummy.

I doubled the pecans and chocolate used milk Chocolate instead of semi-sweet. Then I took whole pecans and placed around the edge of pie to make it look better. Everyone loved it.

This was a fantastic option for my husband who is allergic to both dairy and gluten. I used DF margarine for the crust instead of butter and otherwise followed the recipe exactly - it was a HUGE hit with everyone!

This was tasty and I appreciated the simplicity of the recipe but the end result just doesn't seem/look decadent enough to serve to friends or take to a dinner party.

For the filling, double up on the chocolate chips and the pecans, but leave the other ingredients the same. It makes for a thicker, richer pie. I also added a tablespoon of melted butter to the corn syrup mix and poured it all into the melted chocolate rather than the other way around. Used a storebought pie crust (I was in a hurry). Result: Delicious.

First, I used my own basic pie crust recipe and it worked fine. Also, my family prefers a really tectured pecan pie so I coursely chop 1 cup of pecans, add to syrup mixture and I added 1-1/2 of choc. chips to mixture instead of melting. Then pour into pie pan. I place whole pecans around edge of pie and four in the middle in a sort of star pattern. Place in oven and bake as directed. My pie receives rave reviews every year, even this year from my brothers very southern in-laws. Enjoy.

I bought a ready made pie crust after reading all the other reviews. Even with the crust, it came out too liquidy. I can't imagine how it would have come out if I had followed the recipe and used pecans and butter to make crust. I think the filling is good but I would used to spread over real cake layers.

I was expecting a traditional "pie" but this is not it. While the recipe is quite good (and I have already had requests to make it again) it just wasn't the "pie" I was hoping for.

this is not really a pie...it tasted (and looked) like pecans in wet chocolate sauce. It wasn't a total failure, but it was not the result I was seeking.

Sooo rich and moist! Surprisingly chocolatey, even with the cheap store-brand chocolate chips I had on hand. Recipe could easily be made low-carb using the imitation honey (malitol syrup) and sugar-free chocolate chips.

I did not have any corn syrup, and substituted molassas and a little Myers Dark Rum. When I confessed this to several kitchen-savvy friends, they laughed at my foolishness. However, this pie was hands down the favourite at the family Thanksgiving dessert buffet ~ go figure. The decadent chocolate, the rich molassas/rum taste, and the fantastic chopped pecan pie "crust" - I would absolutely make this one again.

Made this last Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. It's very easy to make and can be prepared ahead of time. A new family favorite!

Great, but a little liquidy -- great flavor though!

This is an unbelievable pie for chocoholics. It is decandently rich and creamy, with just the right amount of pecans. The only thing is I wish this recipe was made for a 9-inch pie pan which is standard for most pies. I will continue to make this pie in my home...it is a definite winner in my family!!!!

I'm a confessed chocoholic and my boyfriend is *NUTS* for pecans, so the natural choice for our Thanksgiving dessert was (of course) Chocolate Pecan Pie! This classic recipe (especially the crushed nut crust - yum!) was easy to make and inspires numerous variations, such as adding liquers, but best of all it's absolutely delish! I think my boyfriend liked it better than the turkey ;) !

I live in Malta where we don't get corn syrup and pecans are very expensive. We substituted the corn syrup with honey, used very good chocolate and put a base of rice paper, which there isn't in the original recipe. We loved it and we'll be trying it again maybe with walnuts or hazelnuts too.

I tasted this pie on Thanksgiving 2000. I was in Los Angeles and I was feeling down and not in the mood to eat. I was at a friends house and someone arrived with a pie they felt nobody would eat. It was this one. It turned to be the hit of all deserts. I have been dying to eat it again since. Peter

To die for! Only for the true chocoholic. Everyone loved this. It was considered rich by only 2 out of 10 at my party and I've been asked for this receipe several times. Absolutely decadent! This one scores a 10. I used light corn syrup with no ill-effects and added a few pecans to the top for decoration. Turned out great.

This rich, chocolaty flourless pie is perfect for true chocolate lovers, and can be served in small portions because it is so intense. It also takes no time to prepare. I live in Italy where it is hard to find corn syrup and used sugar and water instead. It is also practically impossible to find pecans, so I used hazelnut praline for the crust and crushed walnuts for garnnish, and it was truly fantastic.

Easy to make. Delicious variation to an old favourite.

I live in Israel, where it is difficult to buy corn syrup.Honey works perfectly as a substitute.
