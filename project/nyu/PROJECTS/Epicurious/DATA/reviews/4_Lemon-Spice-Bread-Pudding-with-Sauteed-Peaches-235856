Oops, I forgot I had written a review for this last year! And to clarify -- I only soaked for an hour...it needs 2!!!!

I made this almost a year ago, so I won't be leaving many details here, but it was very delicious. I soaked the bread mixture for about 2 hours...but it could've soaked longer. My only complaint was that I wished the pudding had been a bit more tender. Otherwise, quite delish! I believe we served it with Hagan-Daaz vanilla. :)

This was really delicious and I will definitely make it again. I didn't have vanilla bean, but I used some homemade vanilla extract. I will probably use more cardamom pods, more star anise, and a bit more vanilla next time. Also I only soaked the bread for an hour; I think it needed another 30 minutes or so. Otherwise very delicious. I served it with the peaches warm and put Hagan Daaz vanilla ice cream on the top. Super dessert! A little bit time consuming, but the waiting around parts of it give you time to clean up, prepare for the next part, etc. Highly recommended. :)

What a fabulous recipe! I used Challah instead of old rustic bread which I toasted without the butter. I could not for the live of me find star anise so I used a half teaspoon of anise seed and a half teaspoon of fennel seed. The peaches were good but not a must. Next time I make them I will use very little lemon juice.

Made this on the weekend with sauteed nectarines since it's all we had. The bread pudding itself was very good, but the nectarines overpowered the spices in it (they were sourish), and perhaps my spices were a tad on the old side because I didn't get much of the cardamom or star anise. I might serve it with vanilla ice cream next time for a more mild accompaniment. Overall, the recipe was extremely easy to prepare and everyone enjoyed it.

I wasn't a bread pudding fan...until now. This recipe is a keeper! Didn't have fresh peaches so I served it with vanilla ice cream and it was a hit! Next time I'll try with peach ice cream.

This is the best bread pudding I've ever made. The lemon/cardamom combination is perfect for autumn, and the peaches are a wonderful accompaniment.

This is absolutely wonderful. I made this for an Easter Brunch and it was the favorite among many delicious courses. I am making it again today since fresh peaches are in season and doubling the recipe, as I did last time, because it also freezes exceptionally well. I will use this recipe forever.

THE BEST EVER!!! I rarely give 4 forks. I used vanilla extract because it is easier. I baked peaches on top (I have somed canned) because it is easier.

oh my gosh! INCREDIBLE!! This is one I will make over and over again. Yes, the dish was great without the peaches but...the peaches made it something very orginial and delicate tasting. I'll try other fruit in the future as well but this is definitely something I'll do again and again.

This was comfort food at its best. The spices work so well together. I used peach preserves we made from our backyard.

This recipe is exceptional. The flavors are light and fresh, the pudding is dense and moist. We've had it with fresh peaches and alone -- excellent either way. It's on my "classics" list.

This recipe will win over all the people who swear they don't like bread pudding. As others have noted, it's wonderful with or without the peaches.

I'm not a bread pudding expert, so I can't say it's the best I've had but it was yummy for sure! The whole process takes some time but the kitchen will smell amazing for a couple of hours. The pudding was delicious with elegant flavors, I only used 1 cup of sugar instead of the 1 1/4 cup and I'm glad I did because I thought it was almost too sweet.

I think this is the best bread pudding I've ever tasted. I loved the flavor the spice and lemon gave to the custard. I used vanilla extract instead of a bean but it was still delicious. Crusty buttery bread on the top and soft creamy custard underneath. Peaches are out of season now so I just served it straight up. It really didnt need anything additional.

Easy and tasty. Best bread pudding recipe I've come across. I've made for several dinner parties (with fresh whipped cream instead of peaches) and EVERYONE loved it!!!

How did this get 5 forks but there aren't any reviews of the recipe?
