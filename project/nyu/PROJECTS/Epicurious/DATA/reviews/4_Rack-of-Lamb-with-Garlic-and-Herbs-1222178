Very good but either there is something wrong with my oven or the cooking time or temperature is off in the recipe. As written, my lamb was still bloody. Upped the heat, roasted some more and turned out well. I highly recommend deglazing the the pan with some sherry for a lovely sauce.

This looks so impressive, but it is so easy! I cooked the rack in a 400 degree oven for 15 mins after searing and it was perfect medium rare. I had a lot of leftover herbs, which I used in a side of polenta and a red wine reduction w/ the lamb trimmings - YUM!

I agree - easy and DELICIOUS! Oh, it was yum-o-rama. I was worried I would be cooking it if I left it on high for 10 minutes, but not a bit! I didn't have parsley, used cilantro.

I used lemon thyme, Italian parsley and mint. Great herb combination. My boyfriend likes lamb on the rarer side so I only put it in the oven for 15 minutes and it was just barely medium rare. Costco has great frenched rack of lamb. Balanced the richness of the meat with a garden salad and some roasted veggies. Delish dinner!

We marinated the rack of lamb with the herb coating then grilled it on the gas barbecue. It was delicious!

i also enjoyed this recipe though i used a thin layer of dijon mustard on the browned rack to help the herb mixture stick. mixed in a handful of fresh breadcrumbs too and the crust was delicious and crispy.

Off the charts EXCELLENT!! I made this for a dinner party. The guests and my husband gave rave reviews, convinced that the chef originated from some fancy Parisian restaurant (not)! Three chops were artfully placed over a mound of mashed potatoes, then added a Pinot Noir sauce and sprinkled fresh parsley. Now getting ready to present it again for 8 guests. One tip: put the fresh herbs in the Cuisinart for the right texture and so that the spices adhere to lamb. Also, my racks of lamb required more oven time, even though I served it medium rare--really this is the BEST!

Yummy! I browned my rack, but had problems with burning, so deglazed the pan a few times with sherry which also helped create a nice glaze to drizzle over the meat at the end. Due to herb deficiencies, I used fresh time, oregano, mint and dried parsley. I think I used more olive oil that called for because my herb mix stuck fairly well to the rack. Served with a mushroom risotto. My husband couldn't stop raving! Quick and easy.

Trader Joe's lamb racks (uniform, easy to cut into finger food, cryo-vac, buy ahead) plus garden herbs. So easy and delicious. I now serve these at every brunch/buffet with things like asparagus custard tarts.

So flavorful and delicious. No, the herb mix doesn't stick to the rack, but you can just sort of sprinkle it on top. Mine has needed an additional five minutes in the oven to get to the correct temp, but that's ok. Have paired with a simple risotto and sauteed greens to the great delight of guests!

The rack of lamb was delicious!! It was moist and right at temperature. The only dilemma I had was that the herb coating did not stick to the lamb. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Indeed this was a fabulously easy recipe to prepare and so delicious. My husband loves lamb, I have never been a fan, until now! I was so nervous, this being the first time I had ever cooked lamb, but it came out perfectly. My only question is, how did everyone get the herbs to stick to their meat? Mine seemed to fall off pretty easily, which didn't matter because we just drizzled them over the meat while we were eating. I am so excited to have another great recipe in my recipe box!

This was really easy to make. I made it with a Welsh Gower Salt Marsh rack of lamb which is naturally salty so I'd cut back on the salt next time. I made it with one rack and it was perfect for two. I paired it with a bit of couscous, raw tomatoes, and a a Chateauneuf du Pape red. YUM.

Very tasty. Definately cook this again. Prep time is short. Cooking time is short. Therefore very good weekday meal. Prepared along with asparagus and potatoes.

I was concerned initially about what a "frenched" rack of lamb might be, not knowing if I had bought the right cut at the market, but proceeded apace with the recipe anyway. I used only rosemary for the herbs and halved the whole recipe for just myself planning on leftovers. Oh, my goodness, what a treat this was! The lamb was succulent and flavorful. I didn't need to cook the meat in the oven beyond the 15 minutes it was in there uncovered. Delicious and so easy! I can't wait to make this for company.

I had never cooked a rack of lamb before so this was a great starting point. The herb mixture was perfect. However, I didn't brown it in a skillet, I just roasted in a 450F oven until the internal temperature was 130F, removed and tented with foil until 140F. It was perfectly rare, tender and delicious. I have made this twice since with rave reviews from my guests.

@a cook from NYC I love theirs too! It's a nice easy way to have great lamb without having a lot of prep.

Rating: 4
Really easy, fast and delicious! I didn't have fresh parsley, so I just added a little dried to the mix, along with a bit more oil. I halved the recipe and baked at 350 (in the skillet I used to brown the rack). I checked the temperature after the first 15 minutes and saw that it was already at the target, so I just took it out of the oven and the meat was a perfect medium rare. Cuts of meat vary so it's best to rely on a thermometer. I served with mashed sweet potatoes and sauteed pea shoots.

What a lovely dish. Fantastic flavors! I to made a few changes. I added fresh chopped mint to may herbal mix and browned my lamb in olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Oh and I also dusted them with a bit of bread crumbs ... More so for the look then the taste. And for those who prefer their meat medium to well you'll have to cook them at least 20 minutes longer. I served it with lobster mashed potatos and garic spinach. Next time I'll serve it with some grill asparagus tips. Boyfriend loved it and he's a foody he knows his stuff!

This is indeed a great recipe. I also like the pre-marinated pre-herbed version from Trader Joe's...is that bad?

This is a favorite and one I cook again and again. One change is to blend the fresh herbs in a food processor into a pesto like sauce with a little olive oil. They stick better and it bakes into a delicious sauce in the pan that my family fights over.

Made this recipe as per the instructions and it turned out wonderfully.

Wonderful recipe with a couple modifications. First it was just me and my wife, so we needed just one rack and so seared it up in an oven proof pan. I then brushed the meaty side of the rack with a good dose of Dijon. I pulsed up two pieces of crustless bread and added it to the topping mixture before the pan went into the oven. We like our lamb rare so our 1.60lb rack roasted for 12 minutes uncovered and 7 minutes covered. Rested 5 minutes and badda bing, nothing left but bones. Served with smashed red potatoes and honey glazed carrots and parsnips. Served a Molly Dooker Shiraz.

My family requests this again and again. It is a favorite. My kids fight over the herb sauce that falls off the lamb into the pan. With fresh herbs, it is really tasty. I grow these herbs, so I harvest them right before and blend in the Magic Bullet into a very tasty sauce that goes on the lamb. Easy to make too.

This was my first time doing a rack of lamb and I must say that I was surprised and thrilled at the ease of preparation as well as the outcome. This is simply put, fabulous!! I have made this at several dinner parties since and this is always a hit.

Let me try this again. This was not what I expected. The coating tasted very raw and green, and did not complement the lamb. I would not make this again. Very disappointed, especially after all of the glowing reviews.

This recipe was terrific! I had never made lamb before and it was so easy. I made it for Easter dinner and my guests thought it was the highlight of the dinner. I chopped all of the herbs in my mini food processor the night before which helped greatly with food prep. The only downside to this recipe was the lingering odor the lamb left in my apartment, but that is what windows and vents are for!

This is the first time I made Rack of Lamb and it was a hit. Not difficult at all and family love it. This dish will impress your guests. Jerry - Lorain, OH

This is one of my husband's favorite dishes. This is also one of the easier things to cook. I use my "magic bullet" mixer to blend the herb coating ingredients into a paste that sticks to the meat well while cooking. That herb paste makes the dish taste fantastic. The kids scrape it up out of the pan to add to the pieces of meat. This a great "go to" special dish when we want a treat.

Add a half stick of butter and some truffle oil to the herb mix and you will have the greatest lamb you ever tasted. Not for the health conscious though!

Absolutely Fabulous!! It was one of the best and easiest dishes I have made. I made it as directed but I did follow suggestions of upping the cooking temp to 375.

Prepared exactly as written except that I shortened the searing time on the bone side of the racks. For me the time worked just as written for medium rare. Husband and brother-in-law loved this. Made with Australian lamb. Pretty easy, too.

I upped the temperature to 375 and only had to bake covered for five minutes before the meat was medium and just under 140 degrees. It was a bit more done than I'd have liked, so I'll remove it more quickly next time. I added 1/2 t red pepper flakes to the rub. Really exceptional-- and easy-- main course.

well, this is excellent - i used with 1 rack and based on other reviews, browned for only 5 minutes -perfect!

Rating: 4
I made this with only one rack of lamb, and the suggested 10 minutes per rack searing the meat seemed excessive (we like our lamb rare to medium rare), so it only seared for 5 minutes on the meaty side, and 2 on the bone side. The cooking time in the oven was perfect for us, and the lamb was melt-in-you-mouth tender. Served with asparagus with a simple lemon pepper treatment and a tossed salad. This was an excellent and very easy recipe that I will add to my library of lamb recipes.

Based on other rvws I started at 375 After 15 minutes I increased temp to 400 and covered lightly with foil. I took it out after an additional 8 min. It was medium (which my husband prefers). for med rare takeout a bit earlier..Served w/ wild rice w/ mushrooms (a cookinglight recipe mar 08) and sauteed swiss chard. Delicious!

The baking time for this seemed too short. Made exactly according to the directions, but the meat looked RAW. So, everyone crowded into our tiny kitchen and agreed... it looked RAW! So, we baked it for almost 15 more minutes, cut between two middle ribs, and it still looked raw. So, we cut them as if for serving, placed them back in the baking pan and returned them to the oven for between 5 and 7 minutes and they were perfect! People who like their meat rare got the centre pieces and the end pieces were only medium-rare to medium, and perfect for me! With the baking times seriously modified, this is a definite keeper!

Quick, easy and delicious recipe. This was my first time cooking lamb and my husband described it as filet mignon on a stick. Ok it doesn't sound elegant but he meant it in a very positive way.

I have made this 3 times now. The first time I followed fairly precisely and it turned out wonderful. The next times I have modified it. Tonight I added mint, crushed coriander, and whole cumin seeds. This adds a slightly Indian taste. I served with artichoke stuffed crimini mushrooms. Fantastic!

I made this recipe using a butterflied lag of lamb -making the coating into a stuffing. I added Feta cheese, fresh oregano, a few bread crumbs and an egg as binder to the herbs in the recipe.I thick-carved the slices,and it was beautiful with the stuffing staying in place. I served with garlic & chive mashed potatoes. Wonderful and so easy! All my guests enjoyed it.

Use all fresh herbs. This dish is just wonderfull. Very easy and absolutely lucious. My husband who did not like lamb is now a convert. You must try this.
