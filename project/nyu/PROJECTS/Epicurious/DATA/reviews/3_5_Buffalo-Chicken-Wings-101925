This recipe is so delicious that we have made it 3 times in the last week for different parties. Grilling is definitely the way to go for the best flavor. The sauce is also very easy and tastes amazing!!!

This is one of our favorite indulgences. I have made several adjustments to lower the fat content yet maintain taste. I broil the room temperature wings 15-20 minutes per side and then toss them with the sauce. I use light mayo and fat free yogurt in equal amounts for the dip. Sometimes, I have used just the fat free yogurt. I also use Brummel and Brown spread in place of butter in the sauce.

I followed another reviewers advice and used my oven. I baked the wings at 450 for about 40 minutes turning once. I added the sauce and really enjoyed the results.

I made this once and I'll never make it - well at least NOT by deep frying- again. So I'm new to frying, I admit it makes me nervous. I have flashbacks to 7th grade Home Economics and Mrs. Elliot warning us about the hazards of frying, hot oil and kitchen fires. To that list I would now like to add it made a mess of the kitchen and stank up the house. REALLY stank up the house. Yes, I used the stove vent. I'll admit the wings were pretty good but not worth the clean-up or lingering oder.

I couldn't believe how dead easy this recipe was. They turned out exactly like restaurant style wings! I used drumsticks because that was all I had but I'm sure wings will be just as good if not better. I grilled them on the barbeque and they were perfect just brushed with oil and seasoned salt.

I ccoked the wings on a cookie sheet at 425 degrees for about half and hour till nice and crispy and brown and then put them in the sauce. Easier and healthier than deep frying and tasted great!

The simplest and best way to do chicken wings. I dust them in flour before frying. Delicious every time. I've tried many other chicken wing recipes, but I always come back to this one. Always perfect!

I admit I'm a little squeamish about eating bone-in wings, so I pan fried chicken breast tenders quickly on high heat until they were just a little crusty on the outside. Frank's is absolutely the way to go, but I'd like the sauce a little thicker next time, which is the way they're served around the Dallas area. Altogether, this totally hit the spot. Yum!

I have made many different recipes for Buffalo wings and this one goes to the top of the list. I add fresh cilantro to the dressing. For any wing recipe, I skin the wings first and then roast them at 350 about 40 min, turning once. It does take a little time but you can eat a lot more of them with out feeling guilty or like you've consumed too much grease & fat.

I followed other cooks suggestion and id franks 2:1, with a pinch of cayenne for extra spice, we put the wings on the BBQ-zowee!-things were To Die For! I will make them again and again!

This was my first attempt at making wings and it was a huge success! I followed the 2:1 ratio advice (Franks to butter) and I think I would increase the hot sauce even more next time. Of course I fried these - is there really any other way? Yum! However, I was not very fond of the blue cheese dipping sauce. Next time I'll take others' advice and buy a bottle of Marie's!

I tried this recipe, just to try something different. There was not enough sauce. I will go back to the basic recipe on the back of the Frank's bottle, that is still my favorite.

I've made this twice for my wife's birthday. Attempting to pay homage to it's origins, I found Crystal's Hot sauce and use that 2:1 to butter, along with some habanero hot sauce and tabasco. Rave reviews both when they were grilled and when I deep fried them (no flour).

I am originally from Buffalo and was very disappointed that I could not find any similar, or even reasonable, substitutes for the infamous, irreplaceable Anchor Bar wings. That said, this recipe comes very close. My only complaint/change is the sauce. Frank's is THE ONLY hot sauce to use, but you can turn up the heat a bit (or a lot) by adding ground cayenne. I don't recommend it as too hot ruins the flavor. Anyway, the Frank's should be 1/2 cup to 1/4-1/3 butter ( i.e., a ratio of 4:3 or 4:2) and do add the cider vinegar at 1-2 tbl per 1/2 cup Frank's, to taste. We have found that Marie's Blue cheese dressing is exceptional; even the low-fat version. BTW, carrot sticks sit alongside the celery sticks. So, it's 3 forks here because of the necessary changes but it certainly is the closest thing to the original - deep-fried of course!!!

Try marinating the wings in hot suace (I use Frank's), and basting with the sauce during the last 5-8 minutes of cooking, then toss with a bit more sauce to coat. Adds alot of flavor!

As all the others. the sauce is not quite hot enough and there's not enough of it.

Great starting place for wings. Make it once, adjust heat and salt to taste from there. As others have pointed out, the recipe doesn't make any extra sauce. I ended up tossing the wings in a large bowl instead of the skillet, and it worked out fine. Extra sauce would have made them unecessarily gooey.

Rating: 3
This is a great basic recipe for the original Buffalo wings. Franks is good, but to heat 'em up some I add some Trinidad-style pepper sauce (Matouks). Alsofor the dressing, I use sour cream instead of yoghurt and add a little lemon juice and sugar to taste. My wings and dressing get rave reviews from our boys and their friends... who consider themselves wing connoseurs.

Rating: 2
This is a good start for a buffalo wing recipe, but there's not nearly enough sauce for the amount of wings called for - and as a result, the wings come out quite bland and "wimpy." When I ate, I ended up bringing my bottle of hot sauce to the table to dip the wings into. I realize some people like milder heat, but these are buffalo wings we're talking about - they're supposed to be hot! Next time, I'll double or triple the amount of hot sauce.

This was my first attempt to ever make Buffalo Wings and it was a HIT! I fried this batch instead of grilling but it was excellent! Definitely worth the effort.

Great advice, grilling as opposed to deep frying. Try this: Add a generous amount of garlic powder and a teaspoon or so of onion powder to the sauce before tossing. Yum. I also add a considerable dose of ground red pepper for added heat. Do NOT use Tabasco sauce or the like since this very noticably alters the flavor, whereas ground pepper does not. I've never had a leftover...

Deep-fried these wings because grill was covered with snow and I wanted to be busy while the football game was on. Tossed them in a big pan with butter, cider vinegar (key) and a little-more-than-called-for Frank's Hot Sauce, served with blue cheese dressing from the Farm House Cookbook (Loomis) (no mayonnaise called for). These are a hit with teens and adults. Easy to make and great tasting. I'll try grilling in the spring.

Rating: 3
If you are grilling instead of frying for health reasons, good for you. But the slimy slippery wing problem is solved easily and with great effect by rolling each wing in a flour/salt/cayenne mix about four hours prior to cooking and again just before you drop the wings into the oil. Voila, a crisp, tasty non-slip grip.

We grilled the wings to try and stay a little healthy. Sauce tasted better than it looked, but was very greasy. My husband loved them, there were no leftovers!

Rating: 3
This is so close to the way I have always made my wings. After I fry them I coat them with the sauce then bake them on a foil line cookie sheet until they start to brown and no longer wet. We all hate the messy wet wings in our family. I am definately going to try the grilling method at this year's SuperBowl party!

This is the best darn chicken wing recipe I've ever tasted. My three teenage sons love these, only problem, buying enough wings to go around. They devour them. This is EASY, fast and very tasty. I do broil my wings, however, I hate to fry anything and I love the taste of broiled chicken. It adds a nice flavor to this recipe. MMmmmm!

Rating: 4
As a native Buffalonian and having tried to re-create Buffalo wings every other way imaginable, I can attest that deep-fried (don't you DARE flour them) wings are the ONLY way to go. Prepared another way is simply chicken wings prepared another way, not Buffalo-style. This wing sauce recipe is a decent subsitutue; add Tabasco and/or cayenne if you want it hotter. I recommend Marie's Blue cheese dressing if you don't want to bother making it. Hail to the Anchor Bar! It's worth the trouble; Enjoy!

Fabulous! Deep fry and use Frank's. I thought they might be too hot for the kids but they were devouring them as fast as they came out of the pan.

I, too, have made changes to this recipe. After three attempts this is what I've decided works for my husband and I for a football evening. One stick unsalted butter, 6 / 7 - ish oz. Frank's Hot Sauce, 1 T cider vinegar, large dash cayanne, large dash Tabasco. You must fry these wings (9 - 10 minutes) for them to be wonderful. This is NOT a meal for anyone counting calories. This is something to make twice a year and enjoy!

Lesson to be learned: baking buffalo wings doesn't really work too well. We made these for the SuperBowl and, instead of frying the wings (as is, apparently, the only way to go), we followed a suggestion and baked them at 425 for about 40 minutes and then broiled them for about 5 minutes. Exceedingly easy. However, they simply didn't have that much flavor and, they looked rather unappealling. We also followed the hot sauce measurements in the recipe and they were way under spiced. We added much more hot sauce at the table but, again, they just weren't what you get at a restaurant or good take out shop. Blue cheese dip on side was good but, unless you are really chowing down on the dip this seems to make a lot of sauce, yet doesn't have enough blue cheese in it - so we added more. In short, I think if you are going for wings you may need to deep fry away and load up on the hot sauce. Half steps just don't do it here.

Disclaimer: I don't give a rat's patooty if these are not authentic buffalo wings- they were deeeelicious! I lightly coated in flour, s&P. Then dredged in the sauce (Franks and butter- 2:1 ratio) which I added a couple of tbsp of honey and some extra cayenne. mmmmmmmmm.....

Rating: 3
Try Celery Salt instead of regular salt or Dave's Insanity Sauce instead of Tabasco for a different taste. FYI, when you use flour to coat the wings, don't call them Buffalo Wings anymore, they've just become something else. Just a little peeve from someone who lives up here in "wing country".

Rating: 4
Wow these were great! I fried them after dusting with flour as someone here reccomended, then rolled them in the Franks sauce mixture and kept them warm in the oven. They were crisp and delicious-I could have made twice as many.The next time I would add some tabasco for more spice (personal preference), but the recipe was great for kids-spicy but not too hot.

My family loves hot wings, but these were not that great. I make my own hot wing sauce with 1 cup Texas Pete, 1/2 cup melted butter and a huge tablespoon of minced garlic,(from a jar). Frying the wings is a must!! Cut wings into sections, discarding tip. Season with seasoned salt and black pepper and fry. When wings are crispy remove from oil (drain on paper towels) and coat in suace. We serve them with bottled ranch dressing to cut some of the heat.

This is a GREAT base recipe for buffalo wings. The reason for the diversity among cooks here is regional. You like what you were raised with. Keep it as above, but add a fair helping of garlic and onion powder. Use ONLY ceyenne pepper for added heat! Tabasco changes the flavor considerably.

Rating: 3
I have a very well-seasoned pan which doesn't even require extra oil when baking. I baked the wings at 400 on preheat, which means it was broiling and baking at the same time. I turned the wings occasionally until they were nicely browned and crip. Meanwhile, I was making the sauce while the wings were cooking. I cooked it on the lowest possible flame. I have 4 types of hot sauce and just used a little bit of each one, and added a few dashes of garlic powder as well. I tossed the wings in the sauce after they were done, and served immediately with celery and Marie's Blue Cheese Dressing--ok, I'm lazy and already had it in the house and it was delicious anyway! I've been to Buffalo several times and tried the ones from "the source", and these were up there, according to my guests. I didn't make them as spicy as the real thing, however, due to our group preference for "not toooo hot".

Used this recipie to test drive my new deep fryer. They were a huge hit with the boyfriend and tasted very authentic. Fried for about 8 minutes for extra crispyness. I think using Franks is key, but we added some tobasco for extra spice.

Rating: 3
Being from the Buffalo area, an easier and just as tasty way to prepare: Line a jelly roll pan with foil. Single layer of wings, bake at 500. Turn when browned for allover cripsness. Simmer the sauce while the wings are cooking for a thicker sauce that will stick to the wings. To spice up the sauce and maintain the authentic flavor add a dash of garlic powder and ginger.

Rating: 3
Frying the wings is the only way to go, otherwise you are making bbq buffalo wings which taste very different due to the charcoal. Frank's hot sauce is best; if not, try to find Crystal. 2 or 3 to 1 with butter, and just a splash of vinegar. If you like it hotter, powdered cayenne will do the job. Tobasco changes the flavor too much, but is OK for a change.

This is a quick and easy way to make wings buffalo style. The also taste authentic with Frank's Hot Sauce.

I tried both of the recipes on this site and did a side by side comparison of the wings both grilled and fried. My wife and I agreed the fried with a touch of cider vinegar was the best but only slightly better than the grilled with the same sauce. Not worth the extra clean-up in my opinion. Heat the sauce and smother the wings just before serving.

I hate to play the Devil's Advocate here, but as I was looking at this recipe, the Unwrapped episope in question came on. They never claimed the recipe came from the Anchor Bar - actually they made a point several times of saying "it is rumored to have come"... But who cares where they came from? They are still good!

To the guy who says the Anchor Bar in Buffalo is not the true origin of Buffalo Wings - you might want to contact the Food Channel on cable (specifically their series called "Food Unwrapped"). They claim on one of their shows that the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York is the origin of the dish. They make a big deal of visiting the bar, talking to the owners and even shipping instructions for the sauce from the restaurant. Either the Food Channel needs to do more research and this is a bonanza for the Anchor Bar, or you are wrong.

I'm from Buffalo and hate to hear them referred to as Buffalo Wings we in Buffalo know Buffalos don't have wings. We call them chicken wings Buffalo style. I know it is thought that the Anchor bar came up with them but this is false. It really was a black man on the east side of Buffalo who came up with receipe. It's very simple deep fry the wings until crip and toss in the sauce. To make the sauce use Durkee's Franks Red Hot Sauce and Butter. Mild two parts butter to one part Frank's, medium one part butter to one part Frank's, Hot Two parts Frank's to one part butter, very hot straight Frank's, and suicidal Frank's with as much Tabasco as you can stand. Wing sauces all over Buffalo are made different because everyone likes to revise it just like the receipes I've read here. When you do that it's yours not the original any more and you might as well name it after yourself. But if you want the original Buffalo style chicken wings follow this receipe.

Good but not great,the Original Anchor Bar and Grill's Sauce is available from the Anchor's web site. This will assure you of authentic wings (www.buffalowings.com). The mild is mild, the hot is good, the suicidal is better.Follow the recipe on the bottle.

I think that the whole idea of using franks hot sauce is terrorable. If you want to make real buffalo wings there is only one source and that's buffalo. You can buy the best sauce at www.lanova.com. Also the only way that wings are cooked in Buffalo is deep fried.

Rating: 3
italian dressing? ranch? adobo juice? WHAT PLANET ARE YOU PEOPLE FROM? buffalo wing sauce consists of 2 ingredients: hot sauce and butter. the respective ratio must be AT LEAST 2:1. otherwise you might as well make bbq chicken. use frank's as a base and fortify with tabasco to taste (red tobasco; if you use green you will be shot). the vinegar here is tolerable...it adds nothing, but takes nothing away.

Rating: 2
Everybody please take note: 2 to 1 hot sauce to butter. These recipies that call for too much butter and not enough hot sauce are an injustice to chicken wings. And FRY them! Just a little canola oil in the bottom of a large skillet is adequate. These are not thighs, they fry quickly. Yes, you have to turn them in such a little amount of oil (1/2 inch is good), half way thru, but BIG DEAL. Do it right, don't skimp on the pepper sauce, and you may achieve the status of a Wing King.

These are great! Add extra vinegar, i like cider. Add alot of cayenne and definately use Franks. It has a much better flavour than tobasco. For a change add some adobo sauce from chipotles. I always serve with a blue cheese ceasar salad. I only gave them a four because they are chicken wings and not lobster which is food beyond compare!

The easiest way to inject more flavor into this dish is to dredge the wings with a cup of flour mixed with 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a pinch of white pepper. Deep fry them, cut the butter way back and add more hot sauce

Here is the original recipe created by Ms. Teresa Bellissimo, owner of the Anchor Bar and Restaurant, in Buffalo, NY. It is taken from Totally Hot! The Ultimate Hot Pepper Cookbook. 4 to 5 Lbs Chicken wings Freshly ground black pepper Salt (if desired) 4 C Vegetable Oil 4 Tbs butter or margarine (1/2 stick) 5 Tbs Louisiana-brand hot sauce or Tabasco sauce 1 Tbs white wine vinegar 1. Chop off the tip of each chicken wing, and discard it. Chop the wing in half (cutting at the joint) to make 2 pieces. Grind on fresh black pepper and sprinkle with salt if desired. 2. Heat the oil over high heat in a deep skillet, Dutch oven, or deep-fat fryer until it starts to pop and sizzle (around 400 degrees F). Add half the chicken wings and cook until they're golden and crisp, stirring or shaking occasionally. When done, remove them to drain on paper towels and cook the remaining wings. 3. Melt the butter or margarine over medium heat in a heavy saucepan, add the hot sauce and the 1 tablespoon of vinegar. Stir well and remove from the flame immediately. 4. Place the chicken on a warm serving platter, pour the sauce on top, and serve

This is how to make real buffalo wing sauce- franks hot sauce, tons of cayenne pepper, tabasco salt, vinegar, brown sugar or honey, tabasco, and any other hot sauce you have in the house. If you are going to grill them, soak them in the sauce first and then toss them in it again afterwards. Trust me, they are much better this way!
