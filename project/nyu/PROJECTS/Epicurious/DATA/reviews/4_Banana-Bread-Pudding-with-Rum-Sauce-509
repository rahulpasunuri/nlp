I made this yesterday for a Brunch on the Beach, and it was a big hit with everyone. I added extra rum (by accident) to the actual pudding. I doubled the recipe so there would be enough for the brunch, and I had to bake it an extra 45 minutes (total baking time 1 1/2 hours) to ensure that it was definitely cooked through. It's a rich dessert, but it was very popular and so was the rum sauce, which, like others said before, would do well on top of ice cream or any other dessert. It's more like a buttery-rummy sauce, like a caramel sauce with rum. This pudding was sweet enough that it could even be done with less sugar, and maybe some additional spices to jazz it up. Definitely a do-again dessert!

Very tasty! The only modification I made was to use whole milk instead of cream to reduce the calories. The only caution I'd add is that when the rum sauce has boiled, take it off the heat. It will curdle if left on the heat too long.

I made this after eating something similar at The Rum House in New Orleans. It was FABULOUS, the hit of the party. Used old french bread and potato rolls for the bread. Used eggnog instead of whipping cream. I thought it would be too much rum, but all of the alcohol flavor baked out, leaves behind a very rich, sweet rum flavor. Will definitely make again.

This is the best Bread Pudding I have ever had, in fact, it's the best dessert I've ever had. Freezes well too.

Surprisingly good. Was tempted to switch out raisins for chocoloate chips but glad I didn't. (More variations to try in the future!) Didn't even need a rum sauce drizzled over it, it was packed with flavor (and calories, eek!). I used spiced rum and added some nutmeg and cinnamon as well. I also used 1 additional egg and more bread (10-12 oz), and baked the dish in a 9x9 pan rather than a loaf pan. It took rather longer to bake and I almost put a foil tent over the top to prevent over-browning... just sneaked by with a nice brown crust after about 1 hour in the oven.

Big hit with my partner who devoured leftovers as a midnight snack. I did use croissants instead of bread (and they were almond because that was all the store had). I also tore them up and then let them soak in the liquid for 5 minutes, stirred in some chocolate chips and then layered into individual ramekins with the banana. Didn't have enouh whipped cream to make the rum sauce but they were fine without it. Definitely a great recipe. And they were impressive in the oven as they puffed up -- my partner commented on how great they looked. Compliments like that mean it is a four fork recipe!

Made this with Croissants (3 large) and added a little bittersweet chocolate chips and it was amazing. I love it, but my husband thought it was not sweet enought (maybe I'll add more sugar to the bananas another time). I used Jamaican Appleton Estate dark rum and it was strong, but GOOD! In my opinion you really don't need the cornstarch recommend by other reviewers as the consistency is just fine. Will make again.

Yum. Was a big hit at our dinner party.

This bread pudding is as good as it sounds! I wish the recipe had been a little more specific about the type and amount of bread. I used stale Italian bread, a little less than one 10" diameter loaf. If your bread isn't sufficiently stale, try microwaving it a little. As far as quantity, I would recommend skimping on the bread initially, pouring the custard mix over, then adding whatever bread on top you need to prevent it from being bread pudding soup! As other reviewers have noted, use 4 bananas instead of three. They're best when the peel still has some green on the tips. You might consider making more sauce and/or adding a thickening agent like cornstarch to it.

Made this desert a few months back and it was a bit hit. I didnt have dark rum so I used some regular Jamaican rum in the pudding and used Amaretto for the sauce. It turned out great and I would definitely make it again.

I added more rum. And as I only have 330l of thicken Cream in the fridge,I used 1/4 cup for the rum sauce,the rest of the cream and added milk to substituted the cream amount.The result; wonderful! Its excellent! My friends all love it. Even my daughter who isn't a fan for Bread Pudding,finished the whole serving and asked for more.

I made this dessert for Christmas and got great reviews from everyone. As previous reviews suggested, I replaced the raisins with chocolate chips and used challah (cubed) instead of white bread. Also, the custard was a little shortso I whisked together 2 egg whites & 2 tbs of sugar and added to the top before baking. This little workaround was stolen from the Slanted Door pumpkin bread pudding, which I also adore. The rum sauce rocked and adds that something special to this recipe.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone LOVED it. So much, it's been requested to make a second appearance at Thanksgiving. I used challah bread and chocolate chips and banana instead of raisins and pecans.

Definitely yummy, good texture. I made it with some stale yellow cake instead of white bread and it came out quite nicely. I loved the rum sauce (tastes like Butter Rum Lifesavers, only better!) and the rum raisins, but I would cut the rum in half in the egg mixture or simply cut it out altogether. The rum flavor was a little overpowering. That being said, I did use a fun, local rum--Dogfish Head Honey Brown Rum from Delaware. Other than that, an excellent recipe!

I made this when tyring out different mushy foods after having jaw surgery...I made it for breakfast (with the rum sauce!) and, though my fiance thought it was a tad too sweet for the morning, we both agreed that it was perfection the next day. In fact, I probably would have given it only 3 forks on that first day--but it pulled through on days 2 and 3. Pretty yummy...

Perfect as it - have also made it without peacans as I did not have any to hand and still wonderful. I always have requests for this recipe - even from people who don't like bananas!

First time making bread pudding and it turned out great. It really was easy to make and I popped it in the oven while we ate dinner and then made the sauce just before serving. I forgot to buy chocolate chips and my local walgreens only had chocolate covered raisins - a good idea I thought. But the chocolate got lost and I plan on adding lots of chocolate chips next time to balance this dish out and I would also like to add raisins, just separately next time.

Rating: 4
This is just awesome bread pudding. I made a few changes: used amaretto instead of rum (sauce was amazing!) and substitued chocolate chips for raisins. I baked them in 8oz ramekins and mixed everything together, except the bananas, which I did one layer of in the middle of the pudding. I always sprinkle sugar on the tops before baking as well to give it a little extra texture. Came out perfectly and made 8 servings. (If you spray the dishes and unmold while still warm they come out easily.) Served it warm with vanilla ice cream and lots of sauce. Everyone loved it - even those whose aren't normally fans of bread pudding.

Rating: 4
this has become my signature dish. i've made it at least 10 times and my friends LOVE it. for the perfect bread pudding, make sure that (1) the bread does not go above the top of the pan/dish you're baking it in, and (2) keep pouring on the custard until you see puddles on top of the bread that don't get soaked in. it's useful to have a little more custard than the recipe requires for this. i also add chocolate chips in between layers.

A bit of work but very delicious. My friends were impressed.

Great recipe to use with leftovers. I had leftover french bread pieces and banana chunks from a fondue night and so used them in this recipe. I didn't change the measurements in this recipe, but changed the way I put it together. I combined the creme/egg/sugar mixture with the nuts, hydrated raisins, and the bread then put that in the fridge for an hour to "combine" while I sauteed the bananas. Then I mixed everything together and baked it for 45 minutes. It turned out great! I have to say, though, that I still think it doesn't compare to the Bread Pudding with Spiced Rum Sauce recipe also on this site. THAT recipe is out of this world.

Very, very good. Made it for Brunch to RAVE reviews. If you like bread pudding-you will LOVE this recipe! Double the sauce and save for ice cream later...

I made this recipe the other night, and loved it. My major modification was to replace the raisins and nuts with bittersweet chocolate chunks (I used about 6 oz, broken up into small small pieces). The breas pudding turned out great, and wow, that rum sauce is excellent. We didn't even want the whipped cream that I had along side.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe several times and each time has validated what I thought from the first: it is wonderful. I did make some changes, though. I used challah bread and I just about doubled the banana portions. I also added the butter the bananas were sauted with to the assembled pudding before baking. And the rum sauce I plan to make on its own for ice cream or brownies. It's terrific. Thanks for a great recipe.

Yum-yum!!! I made 3 changes. 1: I used brandy instead of rum. 2: I made extra sauce. 3: I used thinly sliced, cranberry bagels instead of bread with cranberries being my current of choice. I hope you enjoy this beautiful dessert!

The bread pudding itself was good, but not fantastic. I was disappointed it didn't have more of a banana flavor- in fact it was hard to taste at all. But, the sauce is extraordinary- i will use the sauce recipe over and over again. I was not a fan of the raisins, either, would leave them out next time. I did not put the nuts in.

Rating: 2
I have to agree with the previous reviewer- I don't like cooked pieces of banana. What I did like about this recipe were the raisins and nuts...it gives a nice texture which most bread puddings don't have. I didn't much care for this, but my colleagues at work are absolutely raving about it. I think what really makes this recipe is the sauce, as so many others have already observed. I doubled this recipe using an old challah out of my freezer, but should have cut it in cubes, rather than large slices, and made it in a 13 x 9 inch pan. I also doubled the sauce , but I think I should have at least tripled it. I think the pumpkin bread pudding on this website is better, and the sauce is about the same, minus the rum.

Rating: 2
I got into my mind I wanted to make a banana bread pudding. Despite the rave reviews, this recipe did not do much for me. I decided I did not like the texture of the cooked bananas. Perhaps slicing them smaller (or even mashing them up) would have made it better for me. I used amaretto instead of rum and loved the sauce.

Rating: 4
Although I love bread pudding I do not like the texture of bananas that have been cooked in any way. I can't stand banana pudding and for the life of me do not know what made me try this recipe but OH MY GOODNESS!!!! This was devine!! To keep me from eating the entire thing I can only make it when I am expecting a large group and plan to make it this 4th. will double or triple the sauce recipe.

Rating: 4
I have made this twice and it got rave reviews! The first time I did it in the loaf pan which was good but not so pretty when sliced. This time I made individual portions in ramekins. It could be served in the ramekins or removed and plated. It looks nicer this way. Great sauce!

Rating: 4
Heavens to Betsy! This is one of the best desserts I've ever made. I used brioche bread, added more bananas and topped it with vanilla ice cream. My guests couldn't get enough! The other reviewers were right. Make more sauce. I made it the day before my party and pretty much drank it up and had to make more. My only problem is that it is not such a pretty dessert presentation-wise. But no one seemed to care. This recipe goes into my "best of" file.

My mom and I made this for dessert for Thanksgiving. MMMMMM, we loved it! The sauce was fantastic. Left out the raisins and used less nuts, but other than that, followed the recipe to the letter. We baked it about 20 extra minutes. We also got it ready the night before and experienced the 'purple banana' problem after baking it the next day, but that didn't stop us from eating it all! We also used the french toast idea and it was fabulous the next morning with more sauce! *additional note on 12/7* Just make this sauce. Forget about the bread pudding, you don't even need it. I've been making this sauce almost daily b/c my boyfriend and I can't get enough of it. I started subbing Kahlua when we ran out of rum. Just as good! We put it on ice cream and bananas and sprinkle with nuts. mmmmm! I'm going to have to buy us larger pants for Christmas! ha!

A delightful dessert! My substitutions included potato bread, as suggested by others, and fat free half and half instead of whipping cream. Although I can't compare the results to the original recipe, we all felt that it was delicious, and probably somewhat healthier, with the fat free half and half substitution. I had to cook the pudding ten minutes longer than suggested in the recipe. I definitely will make this again.

It was good, but a little mushy/watery at the end... maybe because I didn't have any cream and used 1% milk instead. Everything else about it was fine. The rum sauce was good, but not thick at all. Is is supposed to be a runny sauce? It tasted fine, but it wasn't the big hit that everyone else raved about.

Really delicious. I used extra pecans and liked the change of texture of soft then crunchy. I refrigerated the dish overnight before baking and like the custardy consistency. The rum sauce was yummy but not enough. Next time I'll double the sauce so it makes it around the table!

This is one of the better bread pudding recipes I've made (and I've several dozen in my search for the best). I only had 2 bananas (both overripe), and substituted smushy potato bread for white bread and almonds for pecans. Very easy to make. Would be great with apples or pears, and I could see trading the rum for bourbon or calvados.

Oh boy! Do I have a mess in my kitchen! I was talked into making this recipe by a friend, and I don't need to tell you that we are no longer friends. This must be some kind of a joke. I do not like banannas but was told that I wouldn't be able to taste them....not true! I think the cooks who really seemed to enjoy this were actually just a little toasted from nipping the rum. I have paid my dues with bananna bread, so for that I am thankful. Unless you have a completely non stick kitchen, I don't recommend making this recipe. I belive that I'm going to have to repaint the cabinets.

I started making this back when the recipe first came out in '95, it is by far the best bread pudding I have ever made or eaten. I now double the rum sauce portion (I make it with spiced rum like Captain Morgan's) because everyone always loves it, and leftover sauce is great over icecream.

Bananas and Rum...awesome flavors. Next time I'll cook them in individual serving sizes, I found that it needs to be cooked longer then the 45 minutes, the center was still very liquid when baked in the loaf pan, I added another 15 minutes and it was just right. Not the prettiest of desserts but what it lacks in beauty it makes up for in flavor.

Rating: 4
No question -- this recipe is a keeper. I prefer a moister texture so I always pour on the cream! For a sweeter pudding, be sure to use ripe bananas, not green ones! This rum sauce has become a staple for me, I used it with the Toffee-Pecan Peach Cobblers (also on this site), and over plain ice cream...delicious! You can also substitute bourbon for the rum if that's more appropriate for your dessert.

Really did nothing for me. Not enough banana for my taste. The rum sauce was great and is this recipe's sacing grace. But the bread pudding... don't waste your time.

Rating: 3
I thought the bread pudding was very good, but for me the rum sauce turned out kind of coagulated-looking and pretty runny. I possibly did something wrong. I used an extra banana (4 total) in the pudding, but next time I'll use more bread and less banana, as it turned out little soupy compared to other bread puddings I've had and liked. I used slightly stale sourdough bread and it worked beautifully. Very tasty overall.

Rating: 4
I tested this recipe last night in preparation for making it next week for 140 people. The only change I made was to substitute 2% milk for the cream in the pudding (but not in the sauce), which I think worked fine. With all that butter and eggs, I didn't miss the added richness at all. I think the differences of opinion on the dryness of this dessert are probably caused by variation of the absorbancy of the bread used. I used a firm italian bread, and next time I will reduce the quantity of bread so that there is more custard in the spaces. (I soaked the bread in the egg mixture before assempling the layers, to be sure the bread had no dry areas.)Since the recipe made 8 very hefty servings, and I know most of my diners won't want that much, I'm reducing the bread rather than increasing the custard. I will probably put more banana in it next time, perhaps 4 instead of 3. The only other change I would make is to increase the rum in the sauce. It was delicious, and reminiscent of the flavor of hot buttered rum, my favorite winter beverage, but I go for strong flavors in general. All said, I think this is a great variation on bread pudding and I intend to keep it in my repertoire.

AMAZING recipe! I made this as a part of my Easter menu and it was very well received. Everyone was "too stuffed" for dessert until they smelled this baking.

This pudding is excellent! I will always use this recipe now for any bread pudding I make. It would also be good with fresh or dried apples or apricots instead of the bananas. (I did leave the raisins out.) I agree with some of the other reviewers who suggest doubling or tripling the rum sauce. I used dark muscavado sugar instead of brown sugar for both the sauce and sauteeing the bananas. It made the sauce very intense and delicious. You will definitely want left-overs for ice cream or, even better, to eat with a spoon out of the jar! The sauce would also be great with baked apples or poached pears. Now, the only problem I had with this pudding is that the bananas turned sort of a purple color?! Did anyone else experience this? It definitely detracted from the presentation when it was sliced. I may try this in individual ramekins next time. I did make the pudding about four hours before serving it so I'm not sure if this had an effect? Regardless, the banana flavor was fantastic and everyone loved it. This recipe is a keeper!

this is the first time i made bread pudding and it was a HUGE hit!! our friends RAVED about it and demanded that i make it again in the future! i used challah bread which worked really well and was easier than cutting the crusts off of white bread. i also added more rum in the sauce but that made it a bit too thin. all in all, a resounding success and VERY easy to make!

I'm a big fan of bread puddings and this one was delish! I decided to make it on a whim and only had two eggs, 1% milk and no whipping cream. Not a problem.

Would be tempted to try the recipe again with all egg nog.

I cheated a lot on this recipe, using several different types of bread cubed instead of in slices, and substituting 2% milk for the cream. I also mixed it all together, like a traditional bread pudding. Still, though, it was gorgeous - even my non-bread pudding family members thought it looked and smelled terrific. Sauteing the bananas was an interesting technique that gave them an almost-carmelized taste. I ran out of rum, so used a chocolate sauce instead. Slices nicely for presentation.

Okay, I admit, I cheated when making this- I did not layer the bread and bananas - I mixed it together. I also used Capt. Morgan's spice rum to soak the raisins. I have made bread pudding for ever and so I understand the "custard effect" - I made this for my Mother-in-law the first time I met her! I made the sauce and all everyone could say was - "WOW!" It was a hit and very easy... (If you cheat --- like me---)

Very easy to make and very delicious to eat. I've made the pudding twice and both times doubled the ingredients and baked in a 13x9x2" Pyrex pan. The second time I made the pudding without the sauce and thought it tasted better. I believe the rum sauce makes the pudding too sweet and wet (the pudding is inherently moist).

Rating: 1
After having made this dessert, unlike other reviewers, I cannot praise it. The bread on the top layer remained as individual slices and did not mesh together thus it did not have a nice finished effect and I would not serve it to guests. Once sliced I wasn't pleased with the texture either nor did the addition of bananas enhance the flavor. As to the sauce, I admit that it was good and it saved the pudding. I doubt that I will make this again.

I am in the catering business. My partners and I hosted a dessert tasting party where we allowed guests to rank/critique 16 different desserts. This bread pudding beat out 15 other delicious desserts for the top spot. There were several people, including myself, who don't normally even eat bread pudding but nonetheless gave it rave reviews. I agree with the comments of others that the sauce is wonderful. I used a loaf of Italian bread and thought both the taste and the texture were just right. The best part is that it is very easy to make (though a bit time consuming).

Definitely different and good way to use up bananas. I think next time I might go with a little bit less cream. It was a bit rich. But then I also used homemade challah to make it. I might cut back on the rum a little in the pudding. And I agree, that rum sauce is pretty darned good, LOL. I also had a pina colada while I had the rum out. Woohoo!

This recipe is good. I don't have a loaf pan and I used a pyrex dish whichis quite small for the quantity of the recipe. I think it is important to really evenly soak the bread with the luquid mixture, because mine came out a little dry. The sauce was excellent and very very goooood! I will use it for other fruit desserts as topping or sauce. The pudding is good with vanilla ice cream and the sauce poured on top. Yum!!!!

Okay, think Homer Simpson sounds as he contemplates doughnuts once your tongue encounters this pudding with the sauce. It is the benchmark in the world of bread puddings. Subtle banana flavors... wickedly rich toffee sauce.... Licked spoons and smiling faces among adults. I traded amaretto for the rum, almonds for pecans and almond extract for vanilla. The results... my husband ran to do the dishes and praised me all night.

Quite Good, and I made a few substitutions. Used those dried Cranberry fruitlings in place of raisins. Had no Rum, so used Kahlua. Thought cream would be too rich and used a 2% milk and it worked out great. I found it took a bit more cooking time than the 45 minutes. A nice alternative to banana bread when you have too many bananas getting ripe. An AGAIN!!
