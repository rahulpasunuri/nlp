It was a one note (non) wonder. Color was a turn-off. Perhaps it needs more broth. Sorta like glue. Something green would help. Would like some kick but that seems inappropriate with the pears. Cumin? Coriander? Minced hot peppers. Will try to improve it...but wonder should I freeze it and throw it away later or right now.

Made this with a pear and ricotta ravioli. Off the chart good! I really don't measure but I'm certain I used more rosemary than what was called for. It was excellent and very quick and easy. The only sub I did was toasted almonds for the pecans as that's what I had on hand. Used the rest of the toasted almond to coat the chicken I served with the pasta.

I was concerned with reports of unattractive color with the sauce so I 'deconstructed' a bit and yum, yum - delicious. Here's what I did . . . In separate pans: I sauteed my pecans in butter and a splash of pear liquor - then spooned some on top I sauteed the pears over high heat in some butter - just to warm up and get some color - then added on top For the sauce, I started with rosemary and proceeded and, you guessed it, added a splash of pear liquor Lots of fresh rosemary. This is a keeper for us. People went back for seconds.

This is an interesting, different pasta dish. I used spinach linguine, which added appealing color and a mild complementary taste. Next time I would double the fresh rosemary. I didn't melt the cheese enough (perhaps I didn't chop it fine enough) so too much ended up in the bottom of the pan rather than in the sauce. But it still turned out very good.

Excellent flavour that everyone enjoyed. However, as one reviewer pointed out, the color in this dish is unappetizing. The next time I make it I might see if I can leave the skins on some red pears and sprinkle a bit of herbs on top.

I've made this three times for various guests, each time adding about 3/4 to a pound of diced chicken. My husband recently asked whether I had noticed that each time I made this dish, everyone licked their plates and/or asked for more. Really great, really easy!

I love this recipe, but I did cut down on the butter a bit, and cooked the pears on high heat until they were brown, giving them a nice caramelized taste. I'd add even more fresh rosemary next time, and probably half and half instead of the cream. I used some proscuitto and felt it didn't add anything to the dish.

I thought this recipe was good, but not great. Loses points for the icky-color of the sauce.

This was delicious! I used a whole wheat linguine and it gave a nice grainy texture which was perfect combined with the pears. Also, used a bit less gorgonzola and lots of parmesan. I will definitely add this to my list of autumn favorites!

I made this with gorgonzola- and walnut-stuffed tortellini instead of linguini and used pistachios (as someone recommended) and it was delicious! I'll definitely make it again!

Great! I was looking to duplicate a similar dish at a restaraunt and this came very close! I added more cream so next time I will cut down on the broth. I also substituted chopped pistachios and that was great!

I wasn't at all impressed. It tasted, at best, fair. It also turned a weird gray color as I was serving it. (not at all appetizing) I also thought I would love this. I followed the recipe to the letter. Perhaps that was my mistake.

I feel like a traitor, because everyone else raved. Honestly, I underwhelmed by this recipe. And I LOVE fruit/cheese variations. Found it very bland. I won't be making it again.

This is such a classic combination and so easy to make a flavorful. Make sure to combine the pasta and sauce right before serving though. I made the mistake of mixing them to soon before we ate it, and the sauce hardened on the pasta making a not so good texture. Excellent recipe though!

Excellent flavors, no modifications necessary. I served it with chicken pan-fried in olive oil and steamed broccoli (with garlic) as side dishes. Make sure your pears are firm- mine were, but they didn't brown- they probably could have used a slightly higher heat.

I feel like I should only make this again on a special occasion! I was surprised that I ended up with no sauce, just wonderfully flavored pasta, and also that the flavor was so subtle. Substituted whole milk for the cream.

Absolutely delicious! Try adding some shaved prosiutto to make this even more flavorful!

This recipe was very good, rich in flavor. I love gorg. but it's usually used in very heavy pasta dishes, although the pears lightened it up just enough. excellent lunch dish.

Rating: 3
I agree with other reviewers. I thought this was indeed quite subtle, but delicious. None of the flavours are over-powering or strong. A little more gorgonzola might do the trick. The flavours do blend really well together. Enjoy!

I found the Rosemary a little overpowering. Next time I would add more gorgonzola and go easier on the rosemary. I used sliced almonds instead of pecans, and added some diced baked ham. The ham really added to it, both in taste and presentation. I agree the mushrooms would probably help too. Overall very tasty..different, but I recommend the ham to finish the dish.

just one comment (i haven't made this recipe yet) in a restaurant i tried a pasta like th is but the sauce had curry in it and was divine. maybe for those of you who consider this bland, try adding curry powder!

I enjoyed this dish, but, felt it was sort of missing something. The flavors worked well together and were quite tasty but I think something was lacking in really making this recipe a "wow." Anyone else agree, and have suggestions about what to add? I can't quite put my finger on it; I was thinking perhaps mushrooms, but I don't know if that'll do the trick. Overall, I would recommend this recipe.

A totally pleasing surprise. Very rich, extremely delicious. I used organic pears for a fuller taste. This recipe is a little prize.

This was a really tasty dish. A great combination of flavors. The presentation was a bit disappointing - very white/grey in color - need to jazz that up with something.

This recipe was even better than my expectations. I did add about 0.25lb parma proscuitto and thought the results were wonderful. Also, I used light cream and the dish was still very rich. The pears were a wonderful compliment to the cream sauce. I highly recommend this recipe!!

Very Good. Instead of linguine I used spinach tagliatele,perfect combination, and next time I would try to use less pecan and add some parma ham.

Fantastic, what a combination. I used spiced pecans leftover from a gorgonzola salad recipe and they added a nice flavor. definetly a recipe I will use many times.

Hedonistic! Make a port sauce to drizzle on and around the rim of the dish to improve the presentation.

One of the best! I've made it at least 6 times. My husband craves this one. I would not change a thing, it's a unique combination that works.

I really enjoyed how this dish tastes, however it doesn't look pretty at all (murky gray brown). Definitely not for company. The pecans were a nice touch.

Excellent recipe. The flavors play-off each other very well, (the sharpness of the chesse vs. the sweetness of the pears vs. the flavor of the nuts).

I served this to three adults and two children. The range of response was from "Okay" to "really good." I'll give it two forks.
