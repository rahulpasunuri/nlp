I did not try this recipe but I gave it 1 fork because Corn Meal and Grits are two entirely separate products.

Change the name to fried polenta and more people will try it. I'd actually give it 3.5 forks. I make half a recipe of the corn meal mixture but with the full amount of cheese. I chill it in a smaller loaf pan that makes a perfect first course serving for eight with two 1/2" slices each. Accompany with a good Pino Noir.
