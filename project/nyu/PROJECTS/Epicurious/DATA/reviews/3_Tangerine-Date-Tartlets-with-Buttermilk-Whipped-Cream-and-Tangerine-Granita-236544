yummy. Do do the granita. don't over flow the tarts with the filling. I just used a muffing pan. and filled the cupcake with a small amount of rolled dough. The whipped cream is way way yummy!

Delicious and fun to make. A great company dish - time consuming but worth the effort. I am personally not a date fan so decided to use figs instead. The granita was refreshing and light.
