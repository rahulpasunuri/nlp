This is the best marinade and salad dressing I have ever used for chicken! Made several changes: omitted tomatoes, substituted red cayenne pepper for chili powder as I wanted the heat without the chili taste, the chicken was BBQ grilled the day before and I plated the salad in layers instead of tossing. Made a beautiful and elegant presentation that everyone loved. A keeper for sure

This recipe is Ah-MAZING!! I've made it exactly as the recipe calls. But I have also put it between rye bread with provolone and grilled it like a panini. With the sauce on it and more for dipping. Made that for a baby shower luncheon. RAVE reviews! And it was my FAV way to eat it!!

This was terrific-a perfect seasonal dish for June. I omitted the tomatoes because they are not yet in season here, and did not miss them a bit. I have made it twice-the first time I brined the chicken breast before I marinated it, and the second time I followed the recipe without the brine step. I think the brining improved the flavor and juiciness of the chicken, and I will make it that way in the future. It goes on the once-a-week list for late spring-early summer family dinners, and is good enough for a casual dinner party.

I thought this was a great base recipe that is flexible to changes and substitutions and the whim of the cook, and as many others say, perfect for a summer night. I did however stray from the raspberry theme - my local store had neither raspberry vinegar nor fresh raspberries, so I substituted fig balsamic and used fresh strawberries, which turned out to be flavorful and equally colorful. Also, my mother in law used the tomatoes for something else, and I didn't miss them. I also used a purple onion instead of the scallions, which was fine. The dressing was great, and is good marinade for chicken and probably even for salmon or tuna.

I multiplied this recipe by 6 and it served 20 at a ladies luncheon. I omitted the tomatoes and used frozen rasberries and mango. It was delicious and so pretty.

Very good. I tripled the dressing, but only doubled the oil. Did not add the salt. Mango makes this recipe. Next time will use either grape tomatoes or half strawberry tomatoes. Next time will purchase a roasted chicken.

This is a great summer salad. I purchased a roasted chicken and used it as well as sugared almonds in place of walnuts. I will make this again and again. Very complex well integrated ingredients but easy to make. Tip: when tossing salad pour dressing around the side of the bowl and gently move spinach to outside to coat. Perfect with a mangotini!

I quadrupled the recipe, and made this dish for a baby shower luncheon for 20. It was a tremendous hit - raves. Not too sweet, healthy for the mom-to-be, and everything could be made ahead, which was key. Passed the chicken separately for the vegetarians in the group. Will definitely make again.

FABULOUS!!! I used raspberry infused balsamic in place of the raspberry vinegar and it was great.

Terrific salad!!! My husband rarely cares for a fruited salad but this is an exception. Like other reviewers I omitted the tomatoes; then used canola instead of olive oil for a lighter dressing. We grilled the chicken outdoors and found the marinade provided a rich glaze. Simple, elegant and healthful!

This was excellent. I took the advice of an earlier reviewer and added blue cheese. DH says it's the best salad I've ever made. The perfect dinner for a warm summer night. The only thing I would change next time is to leave out the tomatoes. They don't add, they don't detract. They are just there.

amazingly colourful summer recipe. I used organic baby spinach so there were no stems, and layered the salad on plates, starting with a bed of spinach, the grilled chicken, mangoes, raspberries and walnuts...tossing it would have broken the berries....additionally, I used walnut oil to replace the olive oil. It made sense and tasted delicious. Really impressive and quite easy to make. I'll make this again.

Wow! With a glut of perishable raspberries, I've made three raspberry desserts and two salads with raspberries from recipes on this site. Besides this one I made an arugula, goat cheese and raspberry vinaigrette salad. This one is far superior--so tasty I'm considering it for a fund-raising luncheon entree. Marinate a chicken breast or two in this dressing and have them on hand for this salad later in the week. The dressing is so good I intend to make a double recipe and keep it in the fridge. Making the salad is a snap. I omitted the mango and forgot the chili powder. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. This is surprisingly delicious.

Amazing. Made it for my boyfriend and when I asked him if he liked it he said, quote, "You must know that I think it is amazing, since it is all I could talk about the entire dinner." Didn't use the tomatoes. A perfect mango is a must. Used Trader Joes sesame glazed walnuts. Yum

I do a very makeshift version of this with no mangoes and still like it. Also like it with penne pasta.

The best salad! I leave out the tomatoes and the scallions, and add more mango than called for. The mango makes the recipe, in my opinion. Great for impressing guests.

Wonderful salad. I've made it as a composed salad and used grilled jerk pork tenderloin sliced and place in rows atop the spinach. Spectacular presentation for an easy compay main course in summer. I always double or triple (or even quadruple) the dressing recipe and have it available at the table to pass. Also, I place all the ingredients except the oil in the blender and process until finely ground - saves time and you don't need to mash the garlic. Then add the oil for a quick whirl - do not over process and emulsify.

This dressing is fabulous! It's what makes the salad. I used ground ginger instead of fresh (cut the amount in half) to simplify prep a bit. As far as the rest of the recipe goes, I did my own thing; I marinated chicken tenders in orange juice, cinnamon, minced chipotle pepper and garlic and then grilled them. I did a mixed green salad with mango, golden raisins, avocado and roasted cashews. My friends raved.

Made this for a luncheon and everyone raved about it. I followed the recipe except for the greens. I mixed baby spinach and baby romaine--it was a hit!

My boyfriend & I thoroughly enjoyed this salad and found it to be very light & summery, but also pleasantly filling. We didn't have raspberry vinegar, so I just used some raspberry jam as the base and added a bit of white wine vinegar for balance. We also omitted the chili powder & cut back on the olive oil for a little healthier dish. Also used strawberries as we had no fresh raspberries on hand. This recipe is basically very versatile and delicious. I will definitely make it again and would happily serve it to company.

Excellent. I made this tonight for myself and a few friends. Took it to Lake Ontario and ate it on the beach with a full moon and a couple of bottles of Merlot.mmmmmmmm a gourmet moment.

A tasty recipe, the dressing got rave reviews. I used cherry vinegar since I didn't have raspberry on hand, and it still had lots of flavour. Next time I would use pecans instead of walnuts since I prefer their sweeter flavour. Will certainly make it again this summer.

great salad that allows for variations; I always add blue cheese in salads that call for nuts; if you are in a hurry a good gourmet salad dressing can suffice for the somewhat labor-intensive but yummy dressing. I would think that this salad could stand up to steak or pork as well as chicken

This was an outstanding dinner salad. Plenty to eat and the flavors went together so well. I did think 3/4 of a pound of spinach was overkill, at least for two people but it was a meal we will enjoy and be sure to share with guests.

This is the best spinach salad I've ever made- I was a little short on time and so I used an already roasted whole chicken from the deli section of the grocery store- just cut the meat off the bone and added to the salad- it was still delectable (and perhaps a little more so because the juicy dark meat was mixed in with the white). yum! what a celebration of flavors!! Will definitely make again.

I made this salad without the chicken, as I was serving smoked chicken as the main and needed a side salad. Everyone loved it, raving that it was the best spinach salad they have ever had.

Excellent meal to have outdoors on a nice evening with, say, a bottle of riesling. I used all of the ingredients, except that I used raspberry vinagrette instead of raspberry vingear, but added some balsamic vinegar to recipe. I also didn't add any salt. Chicken, spinach, raspberries and mango together are marvelous: I almost didn't even need a sauce.

We loved this recipe - it is a nice change from the typical spinach salad. I served this the other night to some guests, and every single one of them telephoned me in the days to follow to ask for the recipe because they were going to make it that particular night for their family or guests. I've never had that happen before (I mean, sure, you have people say: "Oh I must get the recipe", and there is no real intention behind it.

This is a great salad!!! I made it with romaine instead of spinach(I will use spinach next time), cut the soy sauce in half, left out the salt and used roasted garlic. I grilled the chicken breast basted with Dr. Pete's Praline Mustard Glaze, on the grill. Also didn't add walnuts (I was out of nuts). The raspberries and mango was out of sight. This is the only salad I have found that competes with the online recipe, Grilled Shrimp with garlic and rosemary, on top of my caesar salad.

Boston/NY/LA - you need attention or another site. Better equipment or imagination? I've made this salad - found it in restaurants here in Canada, served it without the nuts, tried a milder vinegar and used it with salmon,chicken and plain - all with amazingly great reviews from friends and relatives (the worst crtics) alike. It's one of my standard salads - even when eating alone. And the pleasure of it all wasthe fact that the restaurant where I first discovered this gem told me whee they found the recipe! A constant recipe seeker from Canada. Give this a try....

My boyfriend and I were looking for a new and different salad, and believe we found it with this recipe. I made it exactly as called for and thought it was delicious. ... As for the Boston/LA/NYC cook, I've noticed you make a lot of recipes on Epicurious yet don't like any of them. It makes me wonder why do you keep trying them when you always seem so displeased?

Except that I omitted the chicken, which shouldn't make a difference, I made this recipe exactly and _hated_ it. My husband kept saying, "this is very interesting. this is quite different," and we normally love spinach salads with fruit in them, but this just didn't work. Dressing is WAY too salty; do not add the salt with the garlic and maybe cut down on the soy-sauce. The soy, garlic, ginger, and mustard made it overpoweringly strong, and the raspberries were very out of place here. The mango and spinach itself were the only parts that weren't overwhelmed by the dressing. I would omit the nuts, as they soaked up a lot of the dressing and became tiny balls of sodium.

I added the chicken while it was still hot to make it a wilted spinach salad - tasted good but made the texture of the whole thing soft and mushy - something crunchy (other than the walnuts) could spruce this up. Great flavours!

Very, very tasty. The rasberries and mango really made this main dish salad, but every ingrediant seemed so important. I didn't change any ingrediant, but to make it so everyone got their fair share, I tossed the spinach, chicken, and fruits/vegs each in separate bowl with some of the dressing. Then to serve, I layered the spinich, then the fruit/veg and finally the cut up chicken. I didn't use all the spinach, but every other morsel was gone and enjoyed by all.
