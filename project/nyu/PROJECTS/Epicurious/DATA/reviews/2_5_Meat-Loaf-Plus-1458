Very salty and not a great flavor.

The taste of this meatloaf was very bland. It tasted more like bread than anything else.

Good recipe, an old standard with a new twist! I would recommend using chopped sirlion (lower in fat, but more expensive) and I doubled the amount of stuffing, I also added some mustard powder. I did not add olives, but next time I make this I will add them. If you don't like things very salty, I would recommend adding only half of the onion soup package. This was good with peas and potatoes!

I warmed the wine and added the soup mix to soften the onions. Let that stand for several hrs while out. Eliminated the olives because I couldn't imagine the taste with them added. Would have added mushroom but daughter is alergic. Served w/beef gravy. Great cold for sandwiches.

I enjoyed this dish, and I am not a lover of meat loaf. I deviated slightly by adding some mushrooms that I had left over and I also added some extra garlic. I served it with ketchup on the table, but I preferred it without.

I needed a meat loaf recipe for someone who is allergic to dairy and tomatoes. This one fit the bill nicely. I was pleasantly surprised at how little it shrunk and how non-greasy it was. I followed it to the letter and my husband thought it was delicious. Of course, he and the kids ate it with ketchup. This is not an exciting, over-the-top recipe, in my opinion but makes a decent weekday meat loaf for family dinner.

A "snap" to put together with good flavor and texture. Try making some delicous sauce to top it off and it's a winner! KIMBER

It was so different from the usual, boring meat loaf. I didn't use exact quantities because I had more meat than called for, but what I did use was fantastic. The onion soup really worked wonders for the flavor. Also, I think the addition of stuffing, rather than bread crumbs, is a neat twist, and it tastes delicious mixed with all the red wine and other goodies. It was a hit here!

I added a can of diced tomatoes and herbs. I really liked it. I try to find different meatloaf recipes all the time. It also makes great sandwiches.
