I made this dish for a pot luck office party, and it was a hit. I think the salmon and cream cheese is a nice twist on the ole classic.

Much better and prettier than standard stuffed eggs.

I made this recipe as part of a birthday brunch and everyone loved it. You can create a homemade pastry bag by just putting the filling in a ziplock bag and cutting a small hole in the corner. Then you just squeeze the filling through. Very delicious.

I made these for a brunch and they just disappeared. They are perfect for get-togethers, no more plain deviled eggs.

Good filling. Have more lemon juice ready!
