Meaty tasting and rich. Served as h'or d'oeuvres, and as such was better without spooning over the pan juices or adding more cream. Assembled day before as mentioned, not a whole lot of work to begin with and even easier this way. Definitely improved by the chopped chives, also added needed color, other than the brown.

The other reviews helped make this recipe delicious - so I did add a slug of whiskey and I did garnish with chives. My own personal touch? Some tarragon and some cinnamon...the verdict? Not a mushroom left on the platter.

I made this recipe as-is to serve as an appetizer for Thanksgiving in 2009. People have been talking about it ever since, so it'll be making a comeback in 2010. It is a very rich recipe but simple to make and delicious. Serve on a platter with garnish - it is a very brown & monotone in appearance.

Another popular mushroom dish which I serve at Christmas. The pecan-garlic filling is very hearty.

Nice recipe, some guests thought there was meat involved. Really needs the chive garnish as recommended by others/

Very disappointed with this recipe. A lot of good ingredients, just didn't come together. Shrimp stuffed portabellas recipe superior.

Made for Thanksgiving eve. From the response I received from guests they were awesome!

I have made this to bring to parties several times now, preparing it just as the recipe is. A huge hit every time and everyone always wants the recipe! Will be making again this week to bring to a New Year's Eve party.

I made this as an entree for a dinner party last night. Garnished with tomato and green capsicum. It was a hit and I look forward to making it again.

I've made this recipe twice now, and it's a big hit. It's easy and can be done ahead of time, but can be pretty unattractive if plattered alone--if you're serving it on a buffet, plan to add color somehow.

This was good, and unusual, but I thought that it was too rich, and not worth the amount of effort. I do prefer a more garlicky, herbed bread crumb stuffing. Between the butteryness of the pecans and the cream, it was just too rich. My guests did love them, though -- especially those watching their carbs.

The combination of pecans and mushrooms makes for a delicious, complex flavor. Next time, I think I'll add a tablespoon or so of brandy to the stuffing. These were a perfect complement to grilled, thin strips of London broil, and suprisingly easy to make. They would be wonderful on a buffet line.

I've made this same recipe in the past using chestnuts. I roasted the chestnuts in their shells and then chopped them up and lightly sauteed them with the other ingredients. It was SO yummy - a great dish for holiday get togethers.

This was amazing. It was very different from the traditional bread stuffing - which is why I loved it so much. I agree they could use a little more salt but that's just my personal preference. Can't wait to make it again for my upcoming dinner party.

I made this as a side to go with lasagna for a dinner we went to. I doubled the garlic and added fresh sniped chives at the end as a garnish. Next time I'll chop the stems in a food processor, as it took me quite a while to prepare. We ate them at room temp. and we all enjoyed them.

I didn't think this was great. It needed more salt (which may be becuase I forget to salt the mushrooms before stuffing them). But even with more salt, they would still be only OK to good, not great. I prefer normal bread stuffing.

These were awesome! I didn't even change or add anything. It was killing me not to add more garlic or cheese, but really, they don't need anything else. Will be served at my next party for sure!
