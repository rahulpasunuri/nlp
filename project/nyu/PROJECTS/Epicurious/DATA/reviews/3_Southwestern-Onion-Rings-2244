Loved these -- made them as directed, though replaced half of the chili powder with cayenne, as we like things hot. I used a huge pot filled with 3 inches of oil and a good thermometer so I wouldn't have the soggy problem: that seemed to do the trick, as every batch was crispy and perfect, though the first wasn't as flavorful. I would like to try a battered, steakhouse style next, but these will stay in my rotation for decadent and simple indulgences. Yummy comfort food!

i didn't care for the flavoring too much. the next batch i used just regular old sat to bring out some flavor and then they were ok. if i made onion rings again i would probably skip all the spices and just use flour buttermilk, salt and pepper, and maybe some crushed red pepper

Nice and crispy. Usually when I make onion rings they have been rather soggy but these came out great!

Yum! These were very good. I've never made onion rings before, and I was surprised how crispy and tasty they were. Using Vidalia onions really makes these great. I served them with grilled chicken and a black bean salad.

Awsome! A great dish for kids. Not the healthiest thing to make though...

This recipe is absolutely horrible. I am usually not picky when it comes to food. But these had no taste at all. I followed the recipe to the letter, my oil was plenty hot, but the coating did not stay on the rings, not that it made much difference. The coating tasted awful anyway. I am still searching for the perfect onion ring (sigh).

These came out terrible, but maybe I did not have the oil hot enough??? They where a complete dissapointment, and un-edible. I will look for another recipe.

These were the best home-made onion rings I've had. My friend loved them, too. Crispy, and the spices were a delicious blend.

I changed this alittle.. I added a can of beer and let it set for about 30 min. The batter was wonderful and held to the onions really well... the only thing I did not like was they did not stay crispy all that long..but if you eat them right away they were wonderful... I will make this again but add alittle more spice next time. We like our food with alittle more heat.

excellent !! It is easy to prepare (while the onions are soaking - you have time to prepare other dishes)and goes along with BBQ as well as brunch or other meals. one very nice thing about the recipe is you can vary the amount of "heat" by changing the chili powder from mild to extra hot depending upon the crowd you are serving them to !! I served them with homemade seafood soup and garden salad. I thought I would have some left over for munchies later - no such luck.
