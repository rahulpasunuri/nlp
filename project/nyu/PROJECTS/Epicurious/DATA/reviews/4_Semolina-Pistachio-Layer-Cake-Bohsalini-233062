Is this the right picture for this recipe? I followed the recipe exactly, and the semolina/pistachio mixture is light green, and the kashta is white. Why is the picture so different? Have to wait until tomorrow to taste it, but all the individual parts taste great!

semolina is flour, the butter/semolina misture is the flour mixture

i tried making it but it didn't look like the picture. Because in the picture you can't see the kashta so I think they're mixing the pistachio with the Kashta??? Personally I tried it with mixing the semolina and the pistachio it tastes good but does not look like the picture...So can anyone tell me with what do you mix the pistachio?

I haven't made this dish but it seems pretty obvious that a) the "flour mixture" they refer to is the semolina and butter mixture described in the first paragraph, and b) you don't combine the pistachio mixture with the kashta. You layer them. See the 5th paragraph.

I was planning on making this recipe, but a couple of areas are unclear. First, after pulsing the pistachio, sugar and rose water it says to add to the flour mixture(what flour mixture?), Second nowhere in the recipe does it say to mix the kashta with the pistachio mixture. Can anyone help clear this? Thank you

A real crowd pleaser. Once I got people to try it. Found Rose Water at a Middle Eastern food store. I learned that you need to remove the milk from heat as soon as it begins to boil. Boiling too long ruins the curds. Very rich dessert. Small slices were very satisfying for guests.
