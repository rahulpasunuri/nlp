I am on a low salt diet so the grape leaves where a no no. I substituted garlic and herbes de province and the sauce is wonderful. I find this recipe good for feeding vegetables to my daughter and a slightly different way to treat zuchini as side or light supper

I have made this twice and loved it. I had some doubts about the grape leaves but was pleasantly surprised. I will definately make this again.

I liked this, and my guests liked it even more. I cooked the shrimp myself, which I do recommend. I must have underspread the fritters because I had a ton left over, but served as a first course with a small salad they were very nice.

For the dinner party used the grapeleaf spread without the lemon juice and the fritter (ball) recipe from this site. Served with seared shrimp and garnished with cayenne pepper... yum!!

This was nice but not fabulous. We are planning a large dinner party in one week. Glad we tried this recipe before serving it. Too much lemon flavor for my taste in the spread, and the fritters were a bit soggy. Will try another fritter recipe and leave out the lemon juice. Too much for such delicate flavors.

Followed only the recipe for the fritters... too much nutmeg (and I usually love nutmeg) gave these an unpleasant aftertaste... perhaps make it with cumin or curry instead? in any case, will try another recipe next time, perhaps a more classic "fritter" with egg in it too.

We had this at our gourmet dinner group. It was delicious! Loved it and will definitely make again.
