I am going to try this recipe on my stove top for New Year's Eve dinner. I've used variations of the stove-top clam bake before, so I'm confident that this will be delicious, too. I know that some of the reviews are several years old, but for those who are reading this in 2007-2008, if you cannot find seaweed at your local seafood store or Asian market, spinach makes a great substitute. When it cooks down, it will have the same consistency as seaweed. Some other greens might work well, too; however, beware of those that have strong flavors, such as kale. They might overpower the seafood taste.

This recipe was great. We had our two grandsons over for the weekend and together we all prepared the and coooked up this recipe. We were amazed at how easy it was to prepare and that it was all eaten. We loved it.

I found I had similar problems to the Upstate NY reviewer, with the clams being overcooked, or not at all in the first round, chicken undercooked, seaweed burnt. A mess, and being so excited for the presentation I was gravely disappointed. It is a good thing the other reviewer mentioned the risk of eating them after another round - I guess I am lucky to be typing this review. Since my family comes from New England, I wanted to impress my native French husband with traditional American food that is GOOD and has cultural novelty. I will keep trying to find a better recipe for a clambake. He only liked it this time because of the collection of ingredients. Its got to be better than that.

Clambakes are always a favorite and this is an okay/basic method. Two comments regarding the clams though: first, they should really be served with clam broth to dip in before you eat them so any remaining sand is washed off and second, to the reviewer from NY: be careful about eating clams that don't open after the first round of heat. This could mean that they were dead before they were cooked. Eating them could make you very ill.

It was hard to find seaweed, but thanks to uor great public market I got my hands on some for free! I followed the directions, and the bottom layer of seaweed burned. About 10% of the clams were over done, and the rest were not cooked at all, I had to put them right on the grill rack so that they would cook and open up. Everything else was o.k., all in all it didn't work well for me, I will stick to steaming clams from now on.

What a great culinary introduction to traditional recipes of the USA! Living in Northern Germany where fresh seafood is plentiful, it was a delight to show my German friends a new approach for preparing seafood common to the region during the all too short summer months by the North Sea. Unfortunately, finding the seaweed was a problem initially. But, as a health conscious American girl familiar with the wide usage of seaweed Stateside, here's a tip for others finding difficulty in locating it : try your local asian food supplier or market; or run down to the nearest vegetarian store (where one can usually find a variety of seaweed products for seasoning food, or rolling sushi). The extra trip is well worth it, as it makes all the difference in discovering the diffferent layers of taste and textures in this dish.

One big problem with this recipe. It'great if you live near the ocean. In Ohio, I can get pretty fresh seafood...but 5 pounds of seaweed. I called every specialty store and seafood shop in central Ohio...out of luck. If there was some sort of substitute for those of us who love seafood but can't get seaweed, it would be great.
