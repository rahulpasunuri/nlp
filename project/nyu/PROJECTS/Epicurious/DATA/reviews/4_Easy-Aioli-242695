Followed the recipe exactly except for substituted greek yogurt for the mayo. Wonderful! And we had leftovers for panini tomorrow night.

Great basic aioli. I added a teaspoon or so of whole grain dijon mustard as well as a half a teaspoon of finely chopped fresh rosemary and some lemon zest.

For a quick condiment, this is a nice recipe. It certainly tastes good, if not exactly authentic!

It's a bit bland to start with. I add an extra clove of garlic and some Sriracha pepper sauce (about 1/2 tsp) to make it more interesting.

Made this quickly a few weeks ago when I thought my tortilla espanola needed a little something. It got way more compliments than the tortilla! Quick, easy, and delicious.

So easy. So good. Also great with French fries. I added olive oil that had been infused with garlic.

Love this easy recipe for aioli! I am making it quite often so I always have it on hand for snacks, veggies, etc. It is perfect!

this is very easy to make. Good when made 7 hours in advance; better still the following day!
