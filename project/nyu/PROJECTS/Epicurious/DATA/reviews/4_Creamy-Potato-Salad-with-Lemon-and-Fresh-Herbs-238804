I have made this potato salad many times, every time multiple people ask for the recipe. I don't like potato salad, but my friends love this recipe and always request it, so I'm happy to make it.

My garden was end-of-season overflowing with herbs, so I chunked in some mint, which I had, and skipped the dill, which I didn't, and used all the other herbs called for. Added fresh barely steamed (microwaved) peas, and got incredible crunch. So fresh with little surprise herb flavors. The grated lemon peel is really the secret ingredient here.

Made this exactly as written, except doubled the recipe for a family picnic. Everyone loved it....and I emailed the recipe to several. I think that an increase in the lemon flavor would be nice.....it's subtle, but i think more up front would be even better to pair with a lot of foods.

I made this last night, and it was absolutely delicious. Creamy, but with a light, fresh, bright, savory taste. I had about a pound and a half of red potatoes in my CSA box, so I added some Baby Dutch Gold potatoes. The only other change I made was extra lemon peel. Don't skip any of the herbs -- they blend perfectly with the lemon peel, and look beautiful.

I made this for a 4th of July BBQ side dish and everyone loved how bright(lemon zest) and herbal (I used extra dill and parsley) it tasted. A nice change of pace as far as potato salad goes; although the recipe says it is creamy due to the mayo, it is still relatively light.

I originally cut my potatoes in larger pieces but went back and cut them smaller so each piece had more of the herb combo. The lemon taste was refreshing and some wanted even more than in the recipe. Thought this was a great alternative to the usual potato salad which is such a yawn.

YUM! I this potato salad was delicious. The acidity of the vinegar and the lemon added to the freshness of the herbs. It really is a great recipe just the way it was written. My boy friend cringed when I said I was putting dill in it, as he is not a fan but this herb but the herbs are so well balanced that it just added to the complexity of the flavors. I will make this again!!!

Delicious. The dill is a great addition and sets off the lemon.

This is a very bright-tasting potato salad that is so easy to make. I zested an entire lemon and omitted the dill. I increased the amounts of celery and scallion. I also used a combination of super-tiny red and Yukon gold potatoes to make this more colorful. It is perfectly delicious without mayo, so don't feel like you must use it. I used less mayo than the recipe called for and it was still creamy enough, as the Yukon golds I find to be a creamy potato. I think this is a good base to experiment with some chunks of a good bleu or goat cheese and maybe some nuts to incorporate additional layers of flavor and texture.

I add chopped capers in addition to lemon juice with the lemon zest. Great potato salad recipe.

Love this recipe. I make it for every bbq I am invited to and it is always a big hit. Love to serve it with the warm potatoes. Also I use the Ojai Cook brand Lemonaise instead of regular mayo. It's a little healthier and gives it a bit more lemony kick. I highly recommend it.

This was a GREAT alternative to the traditional potato salad, which I love, but was so happy to find this light version. I used about 80%/20% ratio of greek yogurt to mayonaise and think it just adds to the flavor and lightness of this dish. However, I did add an extra 1/3 c. as it seemed dry. Made the night before to let flavors meld, used seasoned rice vinegar as it was all I had. Added a few TB of lemon juice as others recommended, and used fresh chives, dried dill (all I had), and Italian parsley. Rather than drizzle the vinegar over the potatoes, which I think makes it impossible to distribute evenly, I mixed it into the mayo/yogurt mixture first and the flavors melded into the warm potatoes that absorbed it nicely. Very easy and worth making. Will definitely make again!

My new Go-To potato salad recipe. It is so fresh tasting with the herbs and lemon. Love it!

Rating: 2
I thought this potato salad was not as good as others that I have . I was under time pressure to make it and so cutting the herbs seemed to take forever.Added green olives with pimento for color and more celery than called for. For those concerned with mushy potatoes, cook potatoes in boiling water for about 12-14 min. Check doneness with a cake tester. It should pierce the potato entirely. When finished boiling, drain in cold water and cover with an ice cube bath.You will never have mushy potatoes again unless you boil them for too long.

I just made this to take to a barbecue tomorrow and it's absolutely delish...so, it can only be better by sitting overnight. I didn't have unseasoned rice vinegar, so I used seasoned. Also, used a bit more parsley, since I love the flavor and color. No green onions in the fridge, so I substituted finely chopped red onion.I also added 1 T each of Dijon mustard and whole grain Dijon. It's very creamy and will be my new go to potato salad. One trick I've learned so that your potatoes don't get sticky or mushy is to drain them after cooking, then leave them in the colander and set it over the pan you cooked them in, cover with a clean tea towel, and let them "steam" for 15-20 minutes...works like a charm.

Rating: 3
This potato salad was very good but not perfect. I used baby red potatoes and they got a tad overcooked so I would recommend taking them out a bit early and then covering them with a tea towel to finish steaming in the collendar. The dressing itself was also a bit too thick - next time I will add a touch of creme fraiche or sour cream and extra lemon juice. Also, go easy on the dill as it will overpower the rest of the herbs and keep your vinegar flavor very neutral. The unseasoned rice vinegar is a good bet.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! I have only made potato salad one other time because neither my husband nor I usually like it - typically mushy potato & mayo slop...But this stuff is different! It's fresh tasting and lemony. I quadrupled the green onions, lemon zest, and celery plus I added a tiny bit of insanely small diced red onions. I used seasoned rice wine vinegar because it's all I had and I used 50/50 light mayo and non-fat Fage greek yogurt (does anyone else love this brand as much as me??) and it's so creamy you'd never miss the mayo. At the last minute I squirted in some whole grain mustard, but it was unnecessary because it was already so good. I just made it 10 minutes ago and I've already eaten 2 bowls. I can tell it will be soooo good tomorrow.

Great potato salad. I didn't have basil but would definitely add it next time, I think a generous amount of herbs is key to take this salad to the next step. The vinegar-mayo-lemon sauce is delicious.

This was REALLY GOOD. I added a few things (green jalapeno stuffed olives, capers, grainy mustard to the mayo) because I couldn't help myself but it still would have been great without these extras. The lemon is a nice touch and all the herbs in it were awesome. It's better the next day.

I've made so many potato salads over the years but not with this combination of herbs and lemon peel. It's a keeper. The lemon is such a simple but perfect add. I also didn't have rice vinegar so a dash of white wine vinegar worked just fine. The layering? No need.

Left out dill due to allergies... substituted 1/2 c. olive oil and 3-4 Tbs. of greek yogurt for the mayo, and it still turned out creamy. Didn't have rice vinegar on hand so used a combination of apple cider vinegar and lemon juice -- i personally wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Oh, and I didn't do the layering thing... just mixed up everything but the potatoes, adding a LOT of salt (the mix tasted salty), and then added the potatoes (when combined with the potatoes it did not taste salty anymore). Turned out to be a creamy yet very refreshing and "bright" salad!

This is an excellent alternative to the standard potato salad with pickles and eggs. When I make it I use half the amount of mayo and in its place I use fat free Greek yogurt. This makes the salad very creamy and cuts some calories. Also, I added some vermouth and used seasoned rice vinegar instead of unseasoned while preparing the potatoes. This is a GREAT potato salad recipe.

Um, many of us are very experienced cooks and well educated on the art of seasoning with salt and pepper. I agree; sometims people don't know how to season and don't understand why something tastes "blah," because they're so used to recipes telling them to add a 1/2 t of salt or whatever rather than season to taste, but that wasn't the case with me. I know how to freakin' season. Personally, not just a big fan of the creamy/lemon/dill mixture.I just prefer my potato salad more Southern European than Northern European. But, I'm glad I gave it a try.

I have cooked up a few potato salad recipes from this site, all of which I have thought were quite tasty, but which always seem to have a few reviews claiming it was just "so-so" or "blah" or "bland." Folks, the secret to not-bland potato or pasta salads is a truckload of salt when you boil them. You cannot make up for a deficit of salt after the fact, it must be done during the boiling process. Otherwise, the pasta or potatoes will soak up whatever you put on it and your efforts will be wasted. It is a mistaken notion that salt is unhealthy, unless you have hypertension or your doctor has told you to avoid it. So use it freely!

I'm not a huge fan of American-style potato salad, so thought I'd give this a try. It was okay, perhaps good, but just kind of blah. I seasoned it well and even added more lemon zest and vinegar, but still kind of just there for me. Will go back to my usual: red skins, rosemary, capers, white wine vinegar, evoo, dijon, green onions. Easy and delicious.

This was very good, however, I do think it needed a bit more salt. I used lower fat mayo which normally does not seem to matter when I make a more standard potato salad, but it definitely seemed to matter with this recipe. It was missing that certain something and I think it was full fat mayo! It was better the next day with the addition of some more salt.

This is fabulous! The lemon and dill linger but in a subtle way and the basil adds something special. I omitted the celery, just not a fan. The 17 min on potatoes turned out perfect for the "gourment baby reds" I bought, cooked but firm. I combined all the other ingredients and simply tossed the potatoes in that instead of the "layer and sprinkle and season" instructions. I added a bit of salt and pepper after giving that a taste. I made it the previous evening, it tasted lovely while the potatoes were still warm. Overnight and cold the next day, it was just as great tasting. Family says this is the new must for potato salad.

I took the advise of a few others and added lemon juice but besides that I didn't change a thing. It was delicious. Some reviews thought it needed more mayo. I didn't.

Made this last night for a dinner party. It was a hit all the way around and a great way to use fresh herbs growing in the garden. You can modify this recipe in some ways (I didn't use celery), but I wouldn't recommend eliminating the lemon. It's key to what makes this so fresh tasting. I also took the other reviewers suggestions and used a light mayo and combined it equally with yogurt. It was delicious.

Excellent potato salad...I served this at a summer bbq and everyone loved it. The flavor of the lemons and herbs give it such a refreshing taste.

Thanks to previous reviewers, I also added the juice of a lemon and a little extra lemon zest.

Mayonaise: I searched for a recipe and found none. If you make your mayonaise instead of buying it your recipes will be far better -- and it is easy to make mayo. Put two raw eggs in a food processor, switch on and process for a couple of seconds and and then pour a thin steady stream of safflower oil in thru the top opening. It is important to do this slowly otherwise you end up with a mix of eggs and oil instead of mayo. You will hear when you have added enough oil, the tone of the processor is much deeper. Or, you can stop occasionally and see how thick the mayo is. when you have the consistency you want, you can add salt, lemon juice etc. Of course if you miss your store bought mayo -- just add as much sugar as you need!!!!!
