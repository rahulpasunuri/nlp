The only substitution I made on this was regular mushrooms for the shitakes, and I found it totally lacked flavor. Plus, by the time the potatoes were done enough, the asparagus was overdone and mushy. What I did next turned out to be a very good solution, though -- pureed the entire thing in the blender with a little milk to make a soup, added a lot of salt, and topped with bacon bits and parmesan cheese. Now THAT was yummy!

Word of caution: the recipe should say that you "heat" the 1 tablespoon of oil which is hot but not smoking, not "eat". I have now learned that hot but not smoking oil is better used for sauteeing as opposed to drinking.

i changed this quite a bit, (since i think ragouts can get a little soggy)and was pleased with the results: i tossed the potatoes & asparagus w/olive oil and herbes de provence and roasted them in the oven at 475 for about 10 min while i sauteed the leeks, shiitakes, and some shallots in butter & sherry. added leek mixture to the potatoes, placed two sherry-vinegar-drizzed sea bass steaks on top of the whole thing, and roasted til the fish was done. came out marvelously!

a lot of work, and I found it hard for everything to be done at once. needs more flavoring too, so more garlic makes sense.

Great Recipe. I actually added some grain mustard and it was a nice twist. I found mustard and leeks go very well together.

I served this hot for one meal and cold for another...both ways it was great.

Potatoes do take longer than specified. I made it with vegetable stock (for a vegetarian) so it needed the lemon juice and mint to really add flavour so don't scimp.

Nice way to combine potatoes and asparagus. I used tiny potates and allowed a little more time for the first potatoe cooking and everything came out nicely.

This was a great side dish. But naturally no dish is complete without garlic and lots of it!! I've made this dish twice with great reviews.

A good, simple vegetarian main dish that satisfied both myself (a veggie-lover) and my husband (a potato-lover). I skipped the step of soaking the leeks in water, and just rinsed them well. I also omitted the parsley. As I suspected, the potatoes took longer to cook then allotted in the recipe. Either cut the potatoes into small pieces, or plan to add cooking time for them.
