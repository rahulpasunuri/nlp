This didn't go over well at my Seder. Most guests didn't like the expressly/cardamom combine. On the plus side it is very moist and raises higher than most Passover cakes. I am going to try adding chocolate and/or cake meal. Might replace the syrup with chocolate liquor.

I had high hopes for this as a new Passover-friendly dessert, but it fell short of my expectations. I found the cardamon an odd taste with the maple and lemon as one other reviewer noted. I followed the directions and used the syrup as well. Not a keeper in my book.

Yuck.

I was the first to review this Passover dessert two years ago, and yes - I have made it again. For last night's Seder, I made the torte the day before, using a 9" springform pan and adjusting the ingredients amount updwards accordingly. The syrup is a must when the torte comes out of the oven - I made half the recipe, brushing most of it on and allowing it to penetrate. Then just before slicing and serving, I poured the little that remained over the torte for additional moistness. It was a huge hit among my ten guests. It's imperative to grind the walnuts as finely as possible, without turning them into a paste, and to use your mixer on high speed for the time specified - this will ensures a light texture.

With such great reviews, I was really disappointed with how this turned out. It sounded wonderful, but the cardamom and lemon were too overpowering (I am fairly confident I used the correct amounts, but no one else seemed to have this complaint). Also, I skipped the syrup due to so many negative comments and offered coffee flavored haagen dazs ice cream, which is the only thing that made it edible. I don't think I'll ever make this again, but if I did, I wouldn't use cardamom.

The flavors were fabulous - however I should have used a 9" springform pan. When pouring the batter into the 8" springform as specified, I saw that the batter came right up to the top. Unfortunately, it then poured over the edge of the pan onto my oven floor in the process of baking. Luckily I was able to rescue the torte and it was delicious nevertheless with a little doctoring in the decorating department.

I made this cake for a dinner party (I'm not Jewish), and it was a nice change of pace from the usual heavy/chocolate or light/fruity desserts. It was moist and dense, with a terrific flavor. I'll definitely be making this again.

This was spectacular for Passover and for any other time of the year. Every cook at my Seder asked for the recipe. Note that because we had a 10" springform pan instead of the 8" that is called for, we increased the amount of each ingredient by 1/2. Although I served the torte with the syrup, no one really wanted the syrup. It was plenty moist already. (I did not have the other reviewer's issue with the syrup solidifying. After putting the leftover syrup in a covered jar in the fridge, we used it on matzobrei the next morning.) Also, I served the torte the day after making it, which was just fine. This is an excellent addition to the Seder, and will reappear every year from now on! Highly recommended.

This is fabulous & not at all like the usual Passover sawdust desserts. My family loved it. I would make this year-round.

Although I personally prefer chocolate, I'm giving this recipe three forks because it earned rave reviews from my father (who generally detests passover desserts) and husband, and generally was a success with all but the munchkins at our seder.

Easy recipe, but it would have been prudent for the writer to have mentioned that the syrup becomes rock solid, after it's left to sit while the torte is baking. I suggest making the syrup WHILE the torte bakes & shortly before it's ready, so that it doesn't turn into a thick mess. Brought this to a friend's house for Passover & it went over very well, but I wasn't impressed enough with it to make it again.

I guess the biggest compliment for this Rozanne Gold, winner of a recipe, is the following: All of the guests at tonights Sedar kept saying that this is a Passover dessert that deserves to be made all year long. Such a moist cake, and the coffee/maple/lemon combination somehow turned into the most delicious flavor. A "Plohtzworthy" recipe, indeed.

Delicious as is, instead of the Maple Syrup this Torte with would be good with a coffee liqueur or a walnut liqueur and/or fresh strawberries. I live in wine country so a nice Ice Wine over this Torte would be great.

Made a trial version of this in advance of Passover next week - will be including this in our dessert table. Very nice, and moist. Husband didn't think the added syrup was necessary at serving time.
