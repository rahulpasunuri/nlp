I have been making these biscuits for Thanksgiving since it first came out. Every year my family and friends ask, "you are going to make those pecan orange biscuits." They are a winnner!

This recipe came out in 1994 and I have made it for Christmas morning breakfast ever since.

I was very disappointed in this recipe - very little flavour. Having read the mixed reviews I decided to bake half with the glaze and with the other half I poured the glaze on after baking. I would strongly suggest pouring the glaze on AFTER baking. Otherwise there is not much flavour. I may use the glaze for other recipes but I won't make this one again.

I made a few changes based on the previous reviews. I add the glaze after baking and I leave out the ginger (I'm not fond of it). They turn out great. I've made them several times. I even took them to a lluncheon last week and got numerous compliments.

I made these changes after reading the review. Bake at 450 degrees for 9 min. and put the glaze on after baking. I used 3 T. fresh orange juice and 2 T. honey stirred together and heated till the boiling point. Pour over immediately after removing from oven.

Offered this on a list for a client to choose from for their Thanksgiving dinner - quadrupled the recipe for 30 people plus I wanted some for myself. Spent a lot of time and effort. I think the temperature given is too high - the glaze burned before the biscuit could raise/or even bake. Turned oven to 350 and threw in another batch - that one never raised either. Tasteless, not sweet. Am not making again and now stuck having to think of a good substitute for my client's dinner. IF someone else can figure out the trick to make these work - I'd love to know!
