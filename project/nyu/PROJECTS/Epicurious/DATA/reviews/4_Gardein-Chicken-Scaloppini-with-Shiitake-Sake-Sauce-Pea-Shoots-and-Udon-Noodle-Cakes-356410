This was a highly complimented dish in my half carnivore/ half vegan household. I made the full recipe which allowed for a filling dinner for two while leaving a serving for both of us for lunch leftovers the next day. I live I a small city with limited grocery options and substituted the Gardein breasts with Simply Organic Patties (just pan fried them), the pea shoots for dandelion greens, the udon noodles for prepared chow mein noodles (not the best sub but all I had to work with), and baby portobellos mixed with button mushrooms for the shiitakes. All those subs and still a good review.

This recipe has a lot of steps and a lot of ingredients. More complicated than the usual quick family meal. However, it was very good. I couldn't find any faux chicken breasts; everything at our store was seasoned. I ended up with the Gardein chicken strips, which were seasoned but not too much. I used vegetable broth instead of faux chicken broth, and that worked fine. I spent half the day driving around, looking for the precooked udon noodles. No luck. So I just bought dried udon noodles, cooked them according to their package directions, and swirled them around a fork and made my own noodle cakes. Took a long time to brown, but worked out fine. The presentation was lovely and the combination of crispy noodles, fresh sprouts, and mushroom sauce was delicious.

I am new to the vegan world and this recipe is amazing! The Gardein "Chicken" is a life send. I have found it in Publix and Whole Foods in a variety of "flavors". I highly recommend it to anyone trying to cut out meat from their diet.

Let me start by saying that I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian, so carnivores should take note. This was relatively quick and delicious, although I did make some changes. I used real chicken stock and sub'd butter for Earth Balance because those are what I keep in the kitchen. I do highly recommend seeking out the Gardein brand Scaloppini breasts. Great texture and flavor in this recipe. I'll be making this again very, very soon!

Absolutely delicious! Made this for my husband and he couldn't even tell that it wasn't chicken. Our area didn't carry the Gardein breasts, so I just used another variety.
