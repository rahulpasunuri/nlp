I was skeptical as to how good it could be. Too simple I thought... Well, it's one of the best desserts EVER. I didn't even make the ganache - just served with fresh whipped cream. It's like a chocolate pâté. Fabulous!

I have made this twice recently. Both times received RAVE reviews. Followed exactly, though I wind up using only about 2/3 of the ganache, even with spreading it in two 'coats'. Both times used Ghiradelli bittersweet for the cake, a combo of bittersweet and semi-sweet for the ganache and topped with fresh whipped cream. I am hopeless on presentation, but this looks gorgeous with no effort. You will not be disappointed.

We have altered the recipe slightly to our taste, but it is a great cake on itself! We have added 1.5 minced red chili to the sugar syrup, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 0.5 teaspoon cayenne to the ganache layer.

I made this for my friends 50th birthday and it was heavenly. I decorated it with pansies, raspberries and powdered sugar and served it with whipped cream. The texture was like a smooth, creamy melt-in-your mouth truffle. I like flourless chocolate cake but I have to say this was a step above. For the chocolote I used Choco Love 58% (in the red package) for both the cake and the ganache. If you have a large group to serve there will be plenty of cake to go around. It is so rich and delicious. If you like chocolate you will LOVE this cake. I followed the recipe as written and have had requests to make it again for my sister's birthday and my daughter's birthday. Make this cake!!

I've made this twice, and both times it's been amazing. It's excellent with a raspberry sauce ( I just make mine with frozen raspberries, water, and sugar )and I'm pretty sure my teenage son would attempt to eat the whole thing in one sitting if I let him.

1 word - EXCELLENT If you have a good white ganache recipe, that would be a nice change for the topping. Otherwise I would not change a thing.

Rating: 4
This recipe was so much easier than all those other flourless chocolate torte recipes that call for separating eggs and whipping into stiff peaks and folding gently and all that business. Nevertheless, it turned out just as delicious as the fussier recipes! As long as you use the extra wide heavy-duty aluminum foil and truly waterproof the bottom of the pan, this recipe is pretty foolproof. I was able to make this in a 9" springform, which is great since I couldn't find any 10" springforms and a 10" probably wouldn't have fit in my roasting pan anyway. Since this made for a thicker torte, I just increased the cooking time until the middle of the torte no longer jiggled. Next time I make it I will decrease the ganache a bit; in a 9" springform, the layer of ganache is about .25 inches thick! I felt it competed a bit with the delicious texture of the cake.

I just made this cake to rave reviews. It was easy to execute and very impressive. I followed the recipe to the letter, except for three changes: I did not use a water bath, I used a 9 inch pan so I baked a little bit of the batter separately in two little ramekins, and I added about 1 tbsp of orange extract to the batter. That was GOOD!! Highly recommended. The texture came out just right, even without the water bath. And the orange brightened up the bittersweet chocolate. I made the ganache as directed as well. I had no trouble removing the sides of the pan from the cake (having buttered the inside of the springform pan), and the parchment paper on the bottom really helped to served the slices nicely. Even the 9-inch version fed over 20 people comfortably -- small slices are utterly rich and satisfying. Overall, I would say that la bete noire est vraiment délicieuse!

I've made this a bunch of times but most recently I halved the recipe and baked it in a 6" pan w/ a removable bottom and 4" high sides (from Sur La Table, $12-ish). I've used great chocolate and Trader Joe's chocolate and it comes out pretty darned delicious either way. Instead of just water for the water/sugar mixture I use 1/2 c. coffee & 1/2 c. water; though you don't taste the coffee per se it does impart a richer, more chocolatey flavor. I made a half recipe for a dinner party for 10 and still had leftovers since this is so rich and a small piece is all that's needed. It's frighteningly simple and the perfect make-ahead dessert for a dinner party. Pretty with gold leaf or raspberries.

Rating: 4
This recipe is wonderful and easy. I've made it several times to rave reviews. Like others have mentioned, I make the bottom layer all bittersweet chocolate and the ganache layer is semi-sweet chocolate. I then serve the cake with a raspberry sauce for a nice contrast of flavors.

I made this for my husband's birthday. He loves chocolate, and we anticipated having a guest who is gluten intolerant. It was amazing. I served it with the cream cheese ice cream (recipe from here, too). This is incredibly rich, so I probably won't be making this too often.

I've been making this for my wife's birthday since it came out in 2006. The change I make is to use bittersweet for the cake and semi-sweet for the ganache. One year I made a dbl batch of ganache, let it cool partially, dipped platic spoons, then froze them on a parchment lined cookie sheet. She used them for coffee stirers on the weekends. Happy Birthday Dear!

This cake is amazingly delicious; however, serve small portions and with a drink! Incredibly rich but incredibly good. Blackberries on top also compliment the chocolate nicely.

i cannot stress enough just how phenomenally easy this cake is for how amazingly well it turns out, every time. i have made it several times, in many different ways. my favourite version was sort of a deconstructed black forest cake. i use the darkest chocolate i can find, a little almond extract in the cake itself and then i serve it with amaretto whipped cream, toasted almonds and sour cherries -- delicious.

Rating: 4
Awesome, everyone loves this torte and it is so simple to make. I change chocolate sweetness depending on those who will enjoy this chocolate delight. Bitter sweet is to bitter for me but good quality semi sweet like Ghirardelli is a great substitution. I also unmold the torte and make sure it is covered with ganache and serve it with raspberry curd and fresh whipped cream.I use a toothpick and draw decorative swirls into the ganache for an added touch.

The easiest recipe for any type of cake that I have ever used. It's also an excellent tasting cake that comes out in the end...pretty much a professional outcome from a seemingly simple recipe.

Have used this recipe no less than 50 (yes, fifty) times. As the vast majority have written, this is an easy, rich and impressive treat and the sole hurdle is securly wrapping the pan(s) before putting in the water bath. I often divide the batter among a variety of smaller springform pans as they make much welcome gifts. They freeze very well.

Rating: 4
Quite simple to make, with the hardest part being the wrapping of the springform pan. I used bittersweet chips and (gasp!) regular milk for the ganache. Had unwittingly used up the cream the night before. Adjusted the ganache by adding 2T of butter and just enough milk for desired thinness. Did not have whipped cream, therefore, which this cake begs. That, or something to break the chocolate flavor. Can't wait to try with other flavorings (chile, cinnamon, raspberries).

Rating: 4
I concur with the majority, this is easy and delicious. I can also agree somewhat with the reviewer who proclaimed the cake more like a fudge than a cake; it *is* rich. Note for singles or those cooking for only two: I cut the leftovers into individual servings, wrapped, and froze them. Take one out a couple hours before you intend on gorging.

Used semisweet chocolate chips (because my bf bought an 11lb box of them and I'm trying to use them up). Was the best cake I've ever made! Used aluminum foil tape (for duct work) to seal the tin foil around the pan so water didn't seep in while baking. Worked great. Yum!

Rating: 3
This was pretty good, and very easy to make, except for the pan configuration and baking, which were a disaster with our 50+-year-old spring pan, which no amount of tinfoil could waterproof. I wound up baking it in an old non-stick bundt pan, and it was very difficult to un-mold. Once it was out, I found it very thin -- I think it would have been even thinner in a 10" round pan. The flavor was good and intensely chocolaty, but the texture was more fudge- than cake-like. I prefer a lighter cake than what this recipe produced. It was good, but not perfection. I think it also would have been better with higher-quality chocolate (the stuff we used was only so-so, regular Baker's semi-sweet).

If there's such a thing as death by chocolate, this is the way to meet your maker!! Aside from what must be the million-calorie count, this recipe is perfection. I decided to try it based on the sassy name and ended up photocopying the recipe for all my guests. The cake is so wonderfully rich with an intense chocolate flavour; I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips for both the cake and ganache. I am not much of a baker but this was so easy to make - it's now my official go-to cake recipe.

I made this cake for a classmate's birthday. He fancies himself a bit of a cook, and is wont to make critical comments - not so with this recipe. It was a huge hit, and in his words "it makes cheesecake seem diluted!" The only modification I made on the recipe was to add a pinch of salt to both the batter and the frosting - it was needed. Wonderful.

This is by far the most AMAZING chocolate cake I have ever made. I made this for my aunt's birthday and everyone raved about it. I didn't change anything from the recipe. I used semisweet chocolate because my mom doesn't love really dark chocolate. I served it with fresh whipped cream and strawberries and it couldn't have been more perfect. However, it is very rich so keep in mind that whoever eats it may only be able to eat a small piece because it fills you up so fast. Makes great leftovers too though!! You should most definitely try this!

Unbelievable! I rarely give 4 stars, as I save it for recipes truly exceptional. This was very rich, very chocolate goodness. Almost had a bit of a cheesecake texture, but really more dense than that. I did prepare it in a double boiler out of habit when working with chocolate. Used ScharffenBerger chocolate, a mix of bittersweet and semisweet. Served with fresh whip cream. I had no difficulties or issues while preparing. Yum!

Well I think it's safe to say have no tears left. I just tossed $15 of Ghiradelli chocolate in the garbage because water from the water bath seeped into the pan!!!! I didn't have the giant roll of foil so I wasn't able to cover 2 sides of the pan all the up. I was afraid to add a 4th layer of foil all the way around so I patched up the exposed sides. It was either the foil or my pan wasn't tight enough. I'm so pissed. And it was so time consuming, not to mention next to impossible finding anything other than a 9" pan. I ended up having to buy a 3-pak of 8,9 and 10" pans. I don't think I'll try this one again for a while. Too bad.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent recipe. It's simple, it's easy, and absolutely a hit wherever you take it. I love the richness, and it goes far so small slices are very appropriate. Plus it's gluten free. I've made it about 8 times in the last two years, and I use Trader Joe's chocolate since it's very affordable. $8 at most for the chocolate you need for this. I make no changes to it, and occasionally make a raspberry sauce to accompany, which also tastes fabulous with the chocolate. ' GETTING IT OFF THE PAN: I usually have no problem lifting it off the disc onto a platter, once I slice around the edge with a thin knife, remove the top part of the springform, and loosen it in a couple places underneath. I actually used to put a flexible plastic cutting board on top of the cake (after sides removed), flip it all over, gently pry off the disc, place the platter on it upside down and flip it all back over, and it's on the platter with no damage. This morning however, I was able to lift it off with my hands after loosening from disc with a knife, and I set it on the platter and peeled out the parchment from underneath. This last time, I *did* get a pool of water on the top from condensation because I covered and chilled it while it was probably warm still. It discolored the chocolate, so I should probably chill it some first before covering it.

hello, I am writing to ask for help in making a smaller version of this recipe. I've made it before and thought it was fabulous, but can't really afford the 26 ounces of chocolate at this point in time. Math has never been my strong point, so I just want to make sure I'm on the right track with my calculations. With a ten-inch springform pan, the area of the cake would be 75 square inches (πr2 is 3 x 52 or 3x25=75 inches). With a five-inch springform pan, the total area would be 18.75 (2.52 x 3= 18.75). 75 divided by 19 is about 4, so I would want to reduce the ingredients called for in the recipe to ¼ of the listed amount. Does this sound right?

I have been making this cake for 2 years; basically since the recipe was first printed. Everyone raves about this "cake". Everyone calls it the Chocolate Truffle Cake since it really tastes like a sliceable version of a truffle. As I always do with most recipes, I made it my own by adding a secret ingredient: A generous splash of Frangelico to the cooled syrup. If you want an easy and amazing chocolate cake, adopt this one. You don't even have to bring out the mixer!

This is the most decadent and rich chocolate cake ever. It is like a pure and fine chocolate bar-- but better. I made this for my brother's 20th birthday, quite the cake! I added an extra layer of ganache after the first layer separated a bit, my fault because I made the ganache too soon in anticipation of topping the cake, but it was not cool enough, so I refrigerated it overnight and reheated it which resulted in a separation of the fat. It was fine though, who doesn't want another layer of ganache?! Served it with a white chocolate happy birthday message and homemade vanilla bean whipped cream.

Absolutely incredible!! I've made it for Valentine's Day, anniversaries, birthdays, all sorts of occasions. Even though it's a little time consuming, it's so decadent and rich that you won't care how long it took.

excelent cake, easy to make, just make sure you follow the directions. don't take the cake out of the springform until the ganache is set.Also try using the bittersweet for the cake and the semisweet for the ganache. I find a easy way to serve the cake is to freeze it. This way the cake will hold its form better than if it just sits in the fridge.

If you need a chocolate dessert, this is THE one. Creamy and rich - the consistency is like the inside of chocolate truffle, with a little bit more substance. I followed the recipe except for using brewed decaf instead of water and a 9" springform. The only challege I had was how to serve it on a cake plate w/o the springform bottom. I unmolded the cake onto a cake rack, removed the parchment and let it cool completely, then inverted it onto a cake plate. Then I poured on the ganache- which is very liquidy when warm- causing it to run down the sides of the cake onto the plate. Although it was messy, it cleaned up easily w/ a wet paper towel. As a result, I used only about 1/2 the ganache, which still gave a nice 1/8" topcoat. The cake is bakery-beautiful whole, and slices up cleanly and easily, just like the photo shows. I served it w/ whipped cream and fresh raspberries and found that they were the perfect contrast.

I love chocolate, especially dark chocolate. I love flourless chocolate cakes, brownies, chocolate cakes with chocolate frosting, hot fudge. I am a full time chocoholic. That said, this cake tastes good but is not worth the cost. I had my doubts before I made it, but I really wanted to try it so that I could compare it to the other flourless choc. cakes I've made. I read all the reviews and expected it to be rich. I used Scharffenberger 70% for the cake and Callebaut (don't remember the percent cocoa solids) for the ganache. As another reviewer mentioned, the ganache is unnecessary. Seriously, don't bother with it. The ganache was definitely too rich in combination with the cake. The cake was delicious but not better than other cakes that I've made with less chocolate. Plus, it cost me $30 for the chocolate alone. Make it if you have to, I did. I won't be making it again, though. I have other, cheaper recipes that were better received than this.

I don't need to add anything more - this is a cake for people who LIKE dark chocolate and LIKE rich chocolate cakes (pretty obvious from the ingredients). But I want to say that we found this very intense so I cut it into about 6 equal size large pieces (we only managed a small bit for my birthday) and I wrapped them in plastic and froze them. Now and then we can take out a piece and slice it super thinly and it is absolutely delicious. So if you are worried about this cake: remember that you can freeze pieces and enjoy for a long time!

We liked this recipe, but it was a little too rich for us; we served it with whipped cream and fresh raspberries, but I would have liked something a little less rich.

This recipe is wonderful, if dense and bold. A great wy to mellow out that boldness is to add an additional layer of White Chocolate Ganache. Follow the cooking directions of the normal, but use 1.5 times the amount of white chocolate. It's also wonderful, if you whip your own cream, to add a few drops of raspberry extract. Makes for a wonderful finish.

1st time I made it it was simple and perfect. Super dense, similar to an enormous truffle. No subtlety in taste, but great for chocoholics [who raved]. Tonight, my heavy duty aluminum was the regular size, [not oversized as was prior], and I got water in my cake, despite the 3 careful wraps, so be warned- use the oversized heavy duty foil. I used Jacques Torres [mrchocolate.com] baking chocolates, as clearly the better the chocolate the better the taste, as it is the only taste in this recipe.

Very, very simple and turns out delicious each time. I give this recipe away often since even novice cooks can turn out a very upscale dessert with no trouble.

Great flourless chocolate cake. Ridiculously dense though!! I'm not much of a chocolate lover, so a small sliver was all I could handle.

This cake is exquisite, everyone freaked out over it. Just make sure that your springform pan is covered in foil very well before going in the water bath.

I've served this cake several times and will continue to do so. Definately a hit, a true orgasim for the taste buds. I use about 2/3's bittersweet and 1/3 semi for the cake and semi-sweet for the ganache. I have also used the ganache on brownies, cheesecake, rice krispie treats and a frozen orange dessert I make with vanilla puding mix, orange juice concentrate and cool whip. Very good on all.

I am 16 years old. I have been making this cake for 2 years on and off. I absolutley hate this cake. It is too rich, and I think that the money we spend on Scharfenberger could be put to better use. I have been the in house "sauceier" and pastry chef for five long years. I have learned a little lesson in my time as a "professional" kitchen dweller, that is if I like a dish, it HAS to be total crap. But if my dad likes it, it MUST be good. If he brings anything I make to work with him, it must be good. Everytime I make this cake, he takes it to work with him mostly because he and I cant finish it between the two of us. Any of you who say that this cake is too rich or too overpowerful, you are right, but it has to be outstanding to someone else because the look on my dads face when he eats it, is ridiculously fulfilling to know i can create something that is that good.

Ok. I followed the recipe exactly after deliberating over whether I should use both bittersweet and semi-sweet choc. My vertic is similar to a few others. This dessert is too rich. Not in a "chocolate" kind of way but in a too much bittersweet chocolate kind of way. I actually felt ill from eating just the smallest piece. I am not opposed to the richness or density, per se, but it is just too much in the end. Imagine eating at a french restaurant where your meat dish has a VERY rich butter sauce. Sometimes, despite the fact that the dish is "good" or "sophisticated," the butter is just too rich. To me, that is a good example of a dish done poorly. A good chef makes a dish that is scaled in proportion to one person, does not have one particular flavor overwhelming another and leaves you feeling like you could not have done it better. I may make this again but would definitely combine semi and bitter choc or maybe even milk choc. I WOULD NOT make it again as written. I simply felt compelled to follow the recipe exactly before writing an honest review.

I made this cake for the first time today. I had company that I really wanted to impress and this cake certainly did the job. I made it exactly as the receipe stated and it turned out spectacular. I served it with fresh rasberries and sweetened whipped cream. Serve very small slices of this cake as it is incredibly dense, rich and delicious without being too sweet. A little goes a long way.

Made this cake for my and my husbands birthday. All I can say is it's sin in a 9" pan. Had to have him bring in the leftovers to the office because I would have eaten all of it. The slice in the picture is more than the average person can eat, so the serving size is more than indicated. Excellent cake!

INSANELY good and easy to boot. A friend took her first bite, swooned and declared this cake to be "like sex on a plate." Nuff said.

Surprisingly easy to make. It can be overpowering - I used bittersweet chocolate the first time, and it was too profound of a chocolate experience for me. Semisweet was more palatable. It's definitely rich, so it's best served in small portions balanced with cream and fruit, and after a lighter meal.

Awesome! Everyone RAVES about this - it looks really heavy, but is surprisingly not so heavy. Make sure you make tons of fresh whipped cream - it's a MUST!

I made this for my sister's gluten-free birthday cake. The first words out of her mouth were "oh my god" after the 1st taste, and everyone else said the same. It was easy to make. The ganache was too runny, even when cooled, so I chilled it before using - plus it made too much. Next time I'll reduce the ratio of cream to chocolate. I used mostly Callabaut bittersweet in the cake, with some Ghiradelli and Scharffenbarger mixed in. I used Nestle Chocolatier for the ganache - next time I'll try semi-sweet morsels for a greater contrast with the cake. Top with whipped cream and fresh raspberries to bring out the BEST flavor.

I have made it 3 times. Twice with bittersweet and semisweet combined. Third time with milk chocolate. By far the best with milk chocolate. You need to refrigerate much longer, but much more of a hit!

I have to agree with the cook from NY. It was WAY too rich for my palate. My guests left some on their plates and I served really small pieces. Unless you are a true chocoholic this is way over the top. A waste of really expensive chocolate.

Rating: 4
Just excellent. Made the cake part exactly as written. Use the best chocolate you can afford, as the taste shines through. I used boiling water in the water bath and it was cooked in under 40 minutes. Also, lined the exra-wide foil with extra-wide parchment paper for waterproofing. Foil always seems to get little holes that result in seepage. The parchment trick never lets me down. Also, used the chai-spiced ganache from that cinnamon mousse chocolate cake recipe, what a brilliant flavour combination that is!

I had saved this to my recipe file to make in the future but I went to a party last weekend and the caterer had made this for dessert so I was able to try it. She served a thin sliver on a pool of raspberry puree and scattered a few raspberries, blueberries and strawberries on the plate. It was delicious and everyone loved it. The caterer said she follows the recipe as written and that of all the chocolate desserts she makes she likes this one the best.

This is a great recipe. I use turkey baking bags, (or slow cooker liner bags) to keep the water bath from soaking the cake. I put the slip form pan in the bag, roll down the sides to the top of the pan, and keep in place with foil or tie with a strip cut from the top of the bag.

This was great. I put the slip form pan in a turkey roasting bag (or slow cooker liner bag) to keep the water bath from soaking the cake. I cut a strip from the open end of the bag then roll down the sides and tie in place with the strip I just cut.

Haven't made this yet - just browsing - but I'd add to the comment of the cook from SF on 12/24/06 that I wouldn't use a plant watering can if there is a chance of plant food remnants (solid or dissolved and precipitated) in the watering can...

Incredible!

You really have to love--not like, but love--chocolate to enjoy this cake. A sliver does it. Here's a hint, though... Don't mess with the springform pan. I use a 10" silicone pan, then just invert the finished cake onto a serving platter. This way, there's no leakage problems, and I've only had an unmolding problem once. (I think the cake was undercooked a bit that time.) And that time, the ganache hid the tears wonderfully.

Rating: 4
in a word.. stellar. Does have the sophistication of a restaurant desert. I, also, wrapped my pan in foil... I also have a very good springform pan that I might recommend to others if you cant manage to keep water out of your cheesecakes and cakes.. the kaiser la forme pans.. sure.. they are $40 vs 9$... but in the long run.. i have yet to have water seepage.. which is used to occasionaly become vicitm of with the regular spring forms!

Too bad I did NOT read others comments before I attempted to make this! I did not use extra wide heavy duty foil and low and behold, leakage into the springform. Duh! Still, I was determined that all was not lost and voila! It still turned out great. Luckily I made the "beast" a day early and it had time to dry out! Delish! Everyone still loved it! That really says something about this dessert, almost unwreckable! I used Ghiradelli for the base and Valhrona for the topping. So rich, the whipped cream is a must as a foil to the heavy chocolate cake. Enjoy!

I have made this twice and it was delicious both times. The first time I made it as written with the exception of adding a pinch of kosher salt, and omitting the ganache. I simply thought it would be way too rich. Talk about gilding the lily! Dusted it with cocoa and served it with lightly sweetend whipped cream and fresh raspberries. The second time, I made it for Christmas. I added about a 1/4 t. orange oil and again the pinch of kosher salt to the batter. No ganache again, but this time I dusted it with powdered sugar and served it with a fresh cranberry sauce I made with just cranberries, sugar and orange juice, and then strained it. Festive, and a little different. I have to add that this is a great cake for someone who cannot have flour, such as my daughter who is allergic to wheat, or for celiacs. Oh, and Trader Joe's Pound Plus Belgian chocolate bars work perfectly, and are not too expensive.

Outstanding! Always a hit and easy too.

Food for the gods and chocoholics. Just 4 notes: heavy duty tin foil a must, and even then I had some leakage into pan; bring La Bete to room temp for a couple of hours before serving...the texture will be more silken and less dense; lining the pan is unnecessary since there is no flipping of the cake; Start with small servings [and whipped cream, of course]. Then pray that there will be left overs for you to enjoy and enjoy.

This was a great disappointment. Despite all the great reviews this received, my guests and I found it far too rich. A couple of bites is all anyone could stand. All in all, a waste of expensive chocolate.

This is a fabulous dessert - rich and decadent! Probably the best flourless chocolate cake I've ever made. The recipe will serve at least 16 people. I had so much leftover - only 4 at the dinner party - that I took a chance and froze it to bring out on Boxing Day. It was as good as the day I made it. A big hit!

Rating: 4
Fabulous! Easy to make and feeds a crowd. You only need a sliver per serving. Use the best chocolate you can afford; otherwise, you will have "just another flourless cake". I used Scharffenberg bittersweet chocolate for the cake and Scharffenberg semisweet chocolate for the ganache. The results are worth the price. Heavy duty EXTRA WIDE aluminum foil is a must to prevent the water bath from seeping in and I thank all the previous reviewers for that suggestion. I made it almost 48 hours in advance and the flavors came together perfectly. I served it with a raspberry puree, fresh raspberries and whipped cream. Just devine.

Rating: 4
ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! I just love this flourless cake that is very easy to prepare. It is decadently sinful and a thrill to chocolate lovers. I used the NEW Nestle CHOCOLATIER Bittersweet Chips with great results. Extra-Wide Aluminum foil is a must to prevent water leakage. I topped the whipped cream with shaved bittersweet chocolate and added a few fresh raspberries on the side for color. Go for this recipe the next time you have a special occasion.

This is an amazing cake. I made several for the holidays garnished with sprigs of holly (don't eat the holly!) and ended up giving two as very welcome gifts. Two suggestions - chop your chocolate very fine before you begin baking, it will melt quickly and evenly. Also make sure to use the large sheet HEAVY DUTY aluminum foil to wrap your springform pan with, otherwise you may get a bit of water leakage around the bottom edges of the cake. This happened to me the first time I made it. I am working on variations with fruit and nuts. I will post my results in the future. I am particularly interested in tying it with orange peel/zest. Enjoy!

I agree with the reviewer who calls this "just another flourless chocolate cake" - it was good, but not memorable. I used Guittard chocolate in the cake and Ghiradelli in the ganache, which made for a nice flavor contrast. I also added some instant espresso powder to the ganache, which turned out really yummy with a subtle mocha flavor. But in the end, nothing outstanding.

Really simple to make, looks beautiful, but in the end it's just another flourless chocolate cake. Tastes just like any other dessert made with melted then cooled chocolate. Maybe I'm just not a chocaholic. Served it for Christmas with a fluffy white coconut cake for second dessert. People raved about the coconut cake, asked for seconds, etc. No one made any comments about this cake.

Let me just add my raves about this outstanding and memorable dessert. There is no better chocolate dessert than this. I used a combination of Ghiradelli semi-sweet and bittersweet baking chips for both the cake and the ganache. It is so rich, it will easily make the 16 servings suggested in the recipe.

Scharffenberg and Steinberg in their new book, The Essence of Chocolate, address the problem of handling the water bath. They suggest putting the cake into the oven before adding the water, adding the water with small pitcher (or, I suppose, a plant watering can) -- and when ready to take from the oven, removing a lot of the water by using a turkey baster to lower the level (and weight) substantially.

Hands down one of the easiest, most spectacular, professional-looking cakes I have ever made. Definitely only for chocoholics. One quick tip: When adding the eggs to the chocolate mixture, you can avoid white wisps in the finished cake by a) bringing your eggs to room temp before starting the cake and b) adding a small amount of the chocolate mixture to the eggs until they slowly raise in temperature. Also, definitely pull the cake out of the fridge an hour or so before cutting. Feed the beast!

This is a seriously chocolately cake...very rich and dense. It is not for the faint of heart. I love chocolate but I must admit, this was just a little too rich for me. Other self proclaimed chocoholics loved this, of course. Do make sure to serve it with some lightly sweetened whip cream. It definitely needs the counterpoint. Also, DO NOT ATTEMPT to make this without heavy duty, EXTRA WIDE foil. I cannot stress this enough. You will have a soupy mess otherwise. Regular, shorter aluminum foil will allow water to seep through the layers, no matter how many layers you put on. I learned this the hard way. I had to redo my whole cake! If you are a serious chocolate fiend, you will definitely love "the beast!"

This was out of this world. Made it on my 7th year anniversary for my chocoholic husband. Served it with a pureed raspberry sauce to complement the chocolate. Tasted much like a chocolate cake I order at a popular steakhouse. I used good quality bittersweet chocolate and it was to die for. However, I had way to much and ended up feeling sick afterwards. Extremely rich recipe. Will def make again and again.

It just didn't come out quite right. My chocoholic family agreed. I used Ghiardelli (sorry about the spelling) chocolate and had high hopes, but most of it is in my freezer now, since it seemed too costly to throw out. I really had high hopes and do not believe I made any mistakes.

I'm sitting here polishing of the last piece. I honestly thought this was too easy to make, and almost made a more difficult recipe (separated eggs etc) but fortunately reconsidered. I had leftover callebaut chocolate which also helped! Notes: I made 2/3 of the recipe and it fit nicely (just barely overly full) a 8 inch cake pan, and that was a more managable size for me--plus no worries about the pan leaking.

Delicious! I added a teaspoon of instant coffee and vanilla to the ganache. The coffee brings out the chocolate flavor.

This is an amazing recipe. It tastes great and is incredibly easy. I topped it with a rasberry drizzle and ganished with fresh raspberries. When you bathe it in water the water all seeped in. I then took a straw and took all the water out. It bakes perfectly fine not in water, so that is how I'll make it next time.

This is an amazing cake. It will come out perfectly every time if you use 3-4 layers of HEAVY DUTY/WIDE ALUMINUM FOIL to wrap the bottom of your springform pan before the water bath. The flavor is delicious and the consistancy is smooth. It melts in your mouth.

Outstanding recipe. I never got the River Cafe's Chocolate Nemesis to come out right (even the easy version) but this came out right the first time. After making it several times, here are my thoughts. When serving to non-chocoholics, definitely top with vanilla whipped cream to help balance the richness. The cake lasts several days in the fridge, but make sure to leave out for 8 hours before serving to reach the correct very smooth consistency. When first made, if you cake tastes a bit too solid and the top is dry, then for sure refridgerate overnight and then leave out for the day. Use a diffenent chocolate for the cake (e.g. Callebaut) versus the ganache for a more complex result. Be warned, cleaning the grooves of your springform pan may be impossible after this recipe -- but that ok, just devote one of your pans to this quick, easy and sensational recipe. It has replaced "Chocolate Stout Cake" on this site as my favourite. Why? Because the taste is pure chocolate and not dependent on the stout you get (Chocolate Stout Cake) or vegetable oil (Double Chocolate Layer Cake).

Rating: 3
On my first attempt, the beast slayed me - my water bath seeped into the springform pan. The second time, however, was successful. It's pretty easy, extremly impressive looking, but way too rich for my tastes. (Used Ghirardelli 60% chips for cake and semisweet chips for ganache.) It's definitely too dense and chocolate-y for me.

Rating: 3
Holy chocolate overload! Quite easy, and very impressive. I added Godiva White Chocolate Liqueur to the Ganache, and made a raspberry sauce to add some color. I felt like something was missing, though...next time I'll add an oreo crust. Yes, I'm one of "those" cooks who fiddles with every recipe!!

Rating: 4
This was incredibly easy with amazing results, but I have two cautionary points to share. Make sure the chocolate base is very cool before adding eggs (I had a few egg white wisps evident in cake eventhough I thought I'd waited long enough before adding eggs), and cake is much easier to cut and serve if it comes up to near room temperature. Truly a keeper.

I'm not a chocolate fan, but my husband is so I made this for his 40th birthday. He LOVED it! I used Valrohna semisweet for the cake, and bittersweet for the ganache. Just enough of a balance on the sweetness. Others are right about only being able to eat a small slice. We put the rest in the freezer, double wrapped in heavy duty foil. One month later it was still good....now it's six weeks later and we are finishing up the last 1/4 of the cake. I don't think it would last much longer than we have pushed it, but it's nice to know you can freeze it.

Not only is this cake super yummy but incredibly easy to make. I love recipes that allow for deviations, because it seems I can never make things exactly as they're written. I didn't have a springform pan so lined a deep dish glass pie plate and still was able to cut slices out with no problem. Used Ghirardelli 60% dark bittersweet chips for the cake, and the semi-sweet chips for the ganache. Had extra ganache and we are eating that this week with ice cream! Served the cake with whipped cream and we were all moaning with delight afterwards. For those who said "too rich," we all laughed at that! Can a dessert ever be TOO rich? We say no!

The cake is unbelievably outrageously good! I've made 3 or 4 different flourless chocolate cakes, and this is by far the best. The texture is somehow dense but melt-in-your-mouth, not heavy. Two-thirds of the recipe fits perfectly in an 8" springform pan, and then it's easier to cut into small wedges. The ingredient amounts for the cake are: 2/3 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar, 6 tablespoons butter, 12 oz. chocolate, 4 eggs. For the ganache: 2/3 cup cream, 5 1/3 oz. chocolate. Baking time will be a little less. I used Trader Joe's pound plus bars of bittersweet chocolate, which gave excellent results.

I also made this for a gluten-free friend; everyone at the dinner thought this was store-bought, it was so lovely. Since other reviewers had noted it was awfully sweet, I added a tablespoon or so of espresso powder to the sugar syrup, subbed 3oz of the semi-sweet chocolate with unsweetened, and tossed just a dash of cinnamon into the ganache. Finally, to compensate for altitude-related issues when baking, I preheated the water bath at 375 and then lowered the temp when the cake went in the oven. Decadent and very, very chocolaty!!

I used a raspberry perserve on top of the cake after it cooled prior to putting the Finishing Chocolate on top and it was wonderful...I would definately make this cake again and I feel it would make a great Christmas Dessert.

To make it even easier, I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chips - no chopping needed! I also used semi-sweet chips for the ganache for less intense richness - VERY GOOD.

I had a heck of a time trying to find 10" springform pans. All the places nearby only had 9" pans. But I went ahead and made it with the 9" and it came out perfectly. The cooking time was even right, which I assumed it wouldn't be with the smaller pan making the cake more dense. Plating was no problem and the parchment is invisible. I added fresh raspberries arranged on top and added a little raspberry extract in the ganache. The presentation was spectacular with the raspberries. I cooled it in the foil, which does make perfect handles if you bring it up a bit over the sides. It didn't seem to be an issue. Oh, and thanks to the person who gave the tip of wrapping all the way up with foil. I'd been pondering that and the tip cleared it up. Everyone LOVED it and it's so easy.

Regarding the question on "chopped" eggs. It's a line spacing typo. The "chopped" is referring to the bittersweet chocolate (chopping up the bars/squares into pieces). And then there is supposed to be the next line of just "6 large eggs".

Dear msgael from Muddy York, ON on 09/30/06 The recipe should read: semisweet chocolate, chopped.............6 eggs............the chocolate is chopped, not the eggs

Rating: 4
To the one wondering about the egg, you don't chop it. That's a misprint. It's the chocolate that is chopped. For the one who asked about the parchment paper, you just slice to the paper, not through it. The cake should slide right off when you slice it, if you have also prepared the paper as mentioned in the recipe. For removing from the the water bath, use rubber gloves or the new silicone pot holders if the water reaches clear to the top of pan. It shouldn't because some of that water will evaporate while cooking. Great recipe for those who have to have gluten free diets. Another word on that foil, don't neglect to do this. The purpose is to keep the water out of the cake. All springform pans will absorb the water if not lined with foil.

Sounds Fabulous!! But will someone please tell how to chop and egg? I guess you must cook it first, boling? Would some kind and gentle soul shed some light on this for me?

I have two questions about this recipe. Can you wrap the foil so that it is higher than the top of the pan, which might make removal from the water bath easier? Do you remove the foil to have the cake cool down? These might sound naive but small things effect temperature and texture.

I made this for my family and gave some to my sister and brother-in-law. The next day she came running over here begging for the recipe.

This cake is absolutly delicious and very rich, so the second time that I made it, I layered the cake with a vanilla mousse, froze it, then covered the cake completly with the ganache. After the ganache had set I made a dulce de leche sauce and poured it over the top. This was sooooo good!

I liked both the texture and flavor of this flourless chocolate cake compared to others I've tried.

Like several others, I made this as a birthday cake. The use of sugar syrup instead of plain granulated sugar is brilliant, and does make an incredibly smooth texture. Overall was super-easy. Wrapping the pan in foil was my biggest challenge. The cake does keep longer than three days. I'm making it for Thanksgiving dinner this year, and for many other occasions in the future, I'll wager.

My husband requested a rich flourless chocolate cake for his birthday, so I made this one. This one was perfect!

I don't eat or make desserts as a rule. However, I thought I'd give this a try as the reviews were positive. Very easy to make even for a novice. I am not a chocoholic either but managed to easily finish my slice!

I made this for my family to test it out before I made it at work (a restaurant). So easy and very good. Very intense chocolate, almost fudge/cheesecake like. It cooks faster than the directions indicate.

This was incredibly easy. I made the cake ahead of time for my mothers birthday and made the ganache the day of. We sliced it like a wedding cake instead of slivers, and decorated the top with a stencil and edible gold dust. My best friend who is a caterer at a poshe local restaurant (and the biggest chocoholic i know) raved. The other 50 guests said it was a BIG HIT as well!!! I'm keeping this one for my personal cravings stash.

Very chocolately. Much like a flourless chocolate cake, with the addition of the ganache. Small slices are best, a little goes a long way. Very easy-hardest part was removing the cake from the water bath without burning myself. Great cake to make again!

I asked my husband (a chocolate fiend) if he wanted a birthday cake and he said no, so I just made this for the heck of it.....WARNING! This is for EVERY chocolate addict you know! I personally don't like sweet desserts, but served it to his sister/bro-in-law after dinner and they just about died! But the cake (I call it more like a cheesecake) is SO RICH, you can only do a sliver, so my husband took the rest to work (along with the cover of the magazine to show everyone where it came from) and they went nuts! I think the magazine even got some extra subscriptions that day! Making it again tonight for work for someone's (also a choco-holic) b-day tomorrow. This recipe is so easy and absolutely devine! YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THIS RECIPE!

This flourless chocolate cake is to die for! It is so easy my 8 year old made it for his dad's birthday. I made it again for my book club- they thought it was my best dessert yet! You can have it in the oven in 15-20 minutes. The directions aren't very clear regarding the foil. Be sure to wrap the ENTIRE pan (botton & sides) to make water tight before the water bath. Absolutely delicious!
