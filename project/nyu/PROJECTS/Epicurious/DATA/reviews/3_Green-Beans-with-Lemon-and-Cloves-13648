This is, hands down, my favorite green bean dish. I have made it for Christmas or Thanksgiving (or both) every year since it was first published in Gourmet in 1996. Fresh, quick, healthy and tasty -- a perfect contrast to often heavy holiday dishes.

I thought this was good. It's an easy preparation and is a nice cut above just steaming green beans. So if you're looking for a little extra something with almost no effort, this is it. FYI, the water evaporated within three minutes and I nearly burned the beans, so you do need to watch this (or just start with more water).

This recipe is so simple to make, and yet tastes so beautifully complex. It is an elegant and healthy way to prepare green beans and I loved it!

Very interesting and very good - everyone loved these green beans - even the kids had seconds! The cloves and lemon perfectly compliment each other. I have made these several times and each time I'm asked for the recipe. I just boil the beans in a big pot of water until they're done to my liking and toss them with the other ingredients.

Blech. I can appreciate that others might like this, but we just had an instant dislike to this dish. It made me wish we had just put a little olive oil on them instead. . .

Very tasty way of cooking green beans. Will make this again.

This is a very simple way to turn green beans into something special. It adds just enough interest to avoid competing with other flavors.
