I agree that the recipe needs more savory notes. I also had WAY too much bacon-date puree; I think a third of the dates to the same amount of bacon would be better. I'm not sure that I'd make it again, as I prefer an "interesting" sauce to accompany duck to a puree. It was relatively easy, however.

This was amazing. The only thing holding back the 4th fork is that, even though I cooked the lentils longer than the recipe stated, they were still a little more toothsome that I like. Next time, I'll soak in hot water prior to cooking as I normally do. That being said, I will totally make this again. And again.

This recipe was fantastic! We used skinless, wild duck for the recipe and it turned out amazingly well. This is probably one of the best dinners my fiance and I have made in the 8 years we've known each other. My only problem is that I didn't watch the lentils and cooking them for 15 minutes was too long for my taste. If I would have checked them a few minutes earlier - they would have been slightly better. All and all - this is a keeper!

This was pretty good. I would make it again with some adjustments. I found I needed more savory notes to offset the sweet, so I would add more bacon to the puree to balance the dates, and more garlic to the lentils.

Cooked almost exactly according to recipie except that I used Champagne vinegar and white onion instead of sherry vinegar and shallots. I did add 3 chicken boullion cubes to the lentils and substituted 1 cup white wine for one cup of water. This was really great and will definitely make it again.

Wow! Definitely a keeper. Wonderful flavors and fairly easy & quick to prepare (if you make the bacon-date puree day before). Instead of duck, I used 2004 Cooking Light recipe "Chicken (used boneless chicken thighs), Date and Apricot Tagine", whose flavors wonderfully complimented the lentils and bacon- date puree.

I also made this recipe for New Year's Eve and it was delicious. I made the bacon date puree ahead of time and was worried that it would be to sweet but it went perfectly with the lentils. I would definitely make this again.

I made this for New Year's Eve and it was exceptional. VERY easy to do and all three dishes went perfectly together. I also thought one could make the puree and lentils, but have something else like chicken or scallops (as the recipe mentions). But the duck made it extra special.

I cooked this up for some of my duck hunting buddies and it brought the house down. Great flavor and texture with the puree and the lentils. I am making it again for another group of friends.

My husband is a fan of duck and also of dates, so I did this recipe, cutting it down by half (1 duck breast and 1/2 of the lentils and puree). It was an unusual combination of flavors and we thought it was great. I made the puree and lentils ahead of time, as suggested by the recipe. I also added an extra teaspoon of brandy to the puree at the end while I was pureeing. The only thing I would do different next time is warm the lentils a bit before serving.
