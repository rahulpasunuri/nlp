delicious & quite easy. perfect for entertaining. I did sub a rib rye roast for NY. The only other addition would be to mix up the veg a little bit, maybe more carrots, potatoes, cauliflower? The turnips and celery root were delicious, but are similar in color and texture on the plate. The mustard cream is amazing

Wow - the veggies were wonderful. Need to be sure to get them well browned. I needed to bake them at 400 the last 10 minutes to really crisp them - especially the shallots. I think I will try a rib roast or make sure the NY strip has more fat next time.

I made this for friends at Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit. I skipped the vegetables since I was making other roasted vegetables with the meal. Next time I'll make 2-3 times the amount for the mustard cream sauce -- everyone really liked it. Delicious!

Easy and delicious. I substituted parsnips and butternut squash for the turnips and celery root.

we loved this recipe. but i made it with a rib roast. didn't need the extra salt after roasting the vegetables.

not that exciting, but a serviceable recipe, and it got me to try celery root for the first time. the mustard cream sauce is nice with the meat. i think it must be important to use a fatty cut of beef, as mine was rather lean and it suffered from quick roasting.
