I'm not doing a rating since I changed it considerably: no greens at all, just the apples with the addition of sherry and a splash of orange juice, honey instead of sugar, and herbed feta instead of roquefort. Also used Gala apples. The result is somewhat similar - and very delicious! Such a simple warm treat!

I have consistently been asked to make this salad every year at Thanksgiving & Xmas. It is easy and delicious!

I have made this salad over a dozen times and LOVE it. I substitute gargonzola cheese and add much more arugula.

I had Maytag Bleu Cheese on hand and used that instead of Roquefort. Everyone loved it, and I've made it for guests three or four times in the last few months.

I first made this recipe last Thanksgiving and I haven't stopped since. I get rave reviews and people are always asking for the recipe. It is simple and quick to make and is a show stopper!

Excellent! I used spiced pecans (See Spiced Holiday Nut recipe in Epicurious) instead of walnuts and it was superb! I would agree that a little more dressing is called for. I doubled the dressing recipe but didn't use all of it. I'm looking forward to making this for my girlfriend's baby shower...it's sure to be a hit!

This salad is delicious as a first course. Some tips: I mixed the greens with the dressing and made each plate individually. I substituted a round of goat cheese in place of the crumbled roquefort, and then fanned out the apple slices around the cheese. And then topped with the walnuts. It went over amazingly.

I wasn't crazy about this salad. The sauteed apples just kind of made the whole dish too "sticky" for my tastes. After a disappointing trial run, I made the salad with sliced raw apples, and it was very good.

This is a great salad but what a cholesterol clogger. This with a baguette would be great. It was liked but kind of lost in the middle of a rich Thanksgiving meal. I guess balancing dishes is important in putting on a full menu.

The sauteed apples make this salad just perfect. We have had it twice, and I intend to serve it at a dinner party next week. I substituted bleu cheese and it still tasted delicious. It's a nice change from ordinary salad and since we always have salad with dinner, this is a good one to have in the recipe file.

This salad had the potential to be wonderful. My sister-in-law made it this Christmas and it was so beautiful in the glass bowl. However, the amount of dressing was minimal and didn't cover all the greens.

My siblings and I threw my parents a 25th anniversary party for 45 people during the fall. It was buffet style and I made this salad and it was a huge hit! There were many requests for the receipe.

This salad is absolutely sensational. I made a huge bowl of it for a dinner party of 12 and there wasn't a scrap left.
