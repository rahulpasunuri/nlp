Nothing special, but ok for during the week when you are looking for something fast and a little more interesting than spaghetti and a jar of sauce.

I used 2 cups of chicken broth, a little bit of lime juice and more cranberries. The sauce alone is disgusting but for some reason on top of chicken it's really good. Everyone loved it!

Not bad, but not great either. The sauce has a rather unappealing color, and no flavor really dominates, but overall the taste is good. I will probably make again for a weeknight meal since it is an easy recipe with basic pantry ingredients.

This recipe wasn't anything special, I was disappointed by the lack of flavor in the sauce. Plus, it has too much fat. The chicken came out very tender but it was pretty flavorless. I don't recommend this.

This first time I made this dish I used regular cranberry juice, the second time I used the concentrate. I liked the flavor better using the regular cranberry juice. It brought out the mustard flavor. The concentrate overpowers the mustard. Served with rice it is excellent.

This was all right, nothing special. The sauce was uncharacteristic, winding up with neither the tartness of the cranberry or the pungency of the mustard. I think using the concentrate for cranberry flavor prohibits the true cranberry flavor; also, there's a lot of sugar that my be detracting from the overall integrity of the other ingredients. I think chickent and cranberry can go well together, but this recipe needs to be tweaked a bit.

This meal was absolutely disgusting for me and my fellow guests. I own a restaurant in downtown Vancouver and the meal absolutely failed. My chefs and I made several attempts but the recipe just wouldn't prevail. I have been working as a chef for 30 years now and i know a bad recipe when i see one! I defiently reccomend this recipe to anyone who has disasterous taste in high quality meals. If you would like to see a much better, simpler, more flavorfull version of this recipe e-mail me!

This is a great recipe, quick, too! I substituted a cup of fresh cranberries for the 1/4 cup of dried, did not add any sugar, and it was delicious. I'll definitely make it again.
