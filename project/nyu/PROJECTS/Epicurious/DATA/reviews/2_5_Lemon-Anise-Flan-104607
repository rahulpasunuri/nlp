Good flavor, but I must have done something wrong with the caramel. When I tried to loosen from the ramekins, I could get the custard out but not the caramel topping. Maybe I cooked it too long? Tough time cleaning out the ramekins too!

The slight essence of lemon and anise make this an unusual variation from your typical flan. I was impressed and glad to share my treats with the neighbors. I'd only suggest adding a lemon twist on top for decoration as it still looks like your typical flan.
