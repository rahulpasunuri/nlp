This was a great recipe and was well appreciated by our guests, a mixture of vegetarians and meat-eaters. As I had to triple the recipe, I decided to oven bake it rather than pan fry it and it worked great. Put it on 400F for about 45 mins, and it came out browned and the marinade thickened up well. For a left-over use, I cut it up into small pieces and made a stir-fry with left over brown rice. Seasoned it up with garlic, soy sauce and rice wine vinegar, it was delicious. My 3yo and 5yo kids, who would normally not touch tofu, loved this stir fry. They even requested it for lunch boxes the next day. I would call that a win!

I found this recipe to be easy to follow and it came together quickly. The whole family enjoyed it. I am not that crazy about tofu and I thought it turned out really well.

A nice, but still easy, change from our normal Tofu Triangles in Creamy Nut Butter Sauce with Scallions ( http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Tofu-Triangles-in-Creamy-Nut-Buttter-Sauce-with-Scallions-355894 ).

For me, this was a good introductory recipe to get me started cooking tofu. I cut my tofu into triangles and marinated them in some Alhoha Shoyu Honey Teriyaki marinade for about 15 minutes, then threw them in the frying pan. The tofu absorbed the marinade nice enough, but I had the hardest time turning them! The triangle shape just made picking them up with tongs or stir-fry chopsticks difficult and a little frustrating. Next time I think I'll just chop them into cubes and stir-fry them afterwards, and maybe serve them over some rice or noodles.

The "one fork" rating may seem harsh, but Epicurious says one fork means "okay," and this was just okay. I thought it would be tastier given all the wonderful ingredients in the marinade, but it was somehow bland. For my preferences, I would add crushed red pepper and possibly garlic. And I would only use half a tub of tofu for 4 people (you can only take so much tofu...) and augment the recipe with veggies.

Really simple, really good--good enough that I've made this recipe many times now. Letting the tofu pieces fry at medium high heat for a while after the liquid is gone (turning them occasionally) gets them wonderfully caramelized--sweet, smokey and crispy--a far different creature than plain old marinated tofu. Similar to others here, I've enjoyed them served in a big bowl with Asian slaw, brown rice, and steamed green veggies, topped with toasted nuts. A simple, yummy meal.

Not an amazing recipe. I thought that there was not enough marinade for all the tofu. I found the taste of the tofu was very bland (and I let the tofu marinate for over an hour.) Even after I added hot sauce (and a little too much of it) I still found the recipe very dull and not having much flavor. I was fairly disappointed.

Not bad flavor but being new to cooking with tofu I wasn't sure how browned it was supposed to get. I cooked it until the liquid evaporated but not sure if it was suppoed get crispy...will try again for a longer period of time.

Great on top of or beside Asian Slaw with Peanuts. Very healthy meal that even my non-vegetarian boyfriend likes. Great for picnics, too - the flavors get better in the fridge and its wonderful cold.

What a good standby recipe! I made a few substituions based on ingredient availability and it still was great. Try tamari and cider vinegar to replace the soy and white vinegar.

Very simple to prepare as a last minute dish because of the simplicity of the ingredients and the short marinade time. I used toasted sesame oil. I served the cooked tofu over a salad of mixed greens with sliced carrots and lightly dressed with a sesame dressing.
