A very distinct tasting BBQ sauce with some kick to it. Excellent flavor with the paprika. I couldn't find the specific chile powders or dried chilies in the recipe. So I used 1 tbsp of my generic chili powder instead. Great with grilled bone-in pork chops!

this is a great sauce I used hot paprika so it was a bit too spicy, I used hot chili powder too. I had tone down a bit by adding some more ketchup. I used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar and a large can of diced tomatoes. It had a good strong bite and was so good on ribs.

This is the best barbecue sauce ever!! I just made a pan of it really quick to resurrect some pork leftovers - we were licking the pan. YUM!!!!

Absolutely one of the best BBQ sauces I have ever tried. Sweet, tomato-y, spicy, tangy ... delicious! I've tried this on chicken, beef and pork so far, this is now a staple for my summer barbecues.
