I use this puree to make low carb bisquits, chicken fried steak with the puree as the white gravy.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx just kidding, but it looks like great relatively low carb mashed potatoes and I plan to try it on Sun.

The consistency is very nice, but the flavor is too sweet or something. Other cauliflower purees are much better.

Surprisingly very good, reduced broth and used sour cream rather than heavy cream and a bit of curry. Place parm cheese on top and bake in oven if it's too loose. It's a vegatable in disguise!

Very easy and good for aging cauliflower or for persuading cauliflower-phobic family members to eat some. I also skipped the parchment paper--just covered it partially with the lid. Simmered until almost all the liquid was gone and dumped it into the blender. Just like mashed potatoes (the more 1/2 and 1/2 you add, the more potato-like the result--but that defeats the purpose of substituting cauliflower for potatoes I guess).

Disappointingly bland, even tho I was generous with salt and pepper and used Russian village-type sour cream. I added lemon juice and parmesan, but it was still blah. Needs punch: horseradish, garlic, paprika.

It seems many reviewers had success without the parchment paper cover, which sounds like a bit of a hassle. What's the reason behind the recipe calling for the parchment paper?

This was fantastic and so easy! I used whole milk and some sour cream, skipped the parchment paper and only used enough liquid to blend. I can't wait to make it again.

The great thing about this dish is that cauliflower is a healthier substitute for potatoes. To cut down on calories, I use skim milk instead of half-n-half and throw in the parmesan cheese for some extra flavor.

I am making this again for Thanksgiving. Have some Atkins relatives, and this will serve fine as their "Mashed potatoes." I also skipped the parchment paper, and for color I am going to add fried shallots to the top.

Don't bother with the parchment paper, or with cooking the cauliflower in the 1/2 and 1/2. Just go ahead and steam it, puree with 1/2 and 1/2 and cooking water(you wont need nearly as much 1/2 and 1/2 as they call for), add a bit of butter, salt and pepper. Very good substitute for mashed potatoes. Atkins/South Beach diet friendly for those watching carbs.
