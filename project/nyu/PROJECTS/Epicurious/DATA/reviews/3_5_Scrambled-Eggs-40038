This was so good! I made it with 2 ounces of cream cheese, 1 Tbl of shallots, and 1 Tbl of chives. Everyone loved it.

Absolutely the best scrambled eggs I've ever made or eaten.

This was wonderful... Really simple, but really great. I used the cream cheese recipe, but was a little wary to use all four ounces and settled for only two. The eggs came out really moist but not runny. Excellent

Great scrambled eggs! I made it with chives and parsley, and even used 75% egg whites with 25% whole egg. I love recipes like this that focus on technique!!

we've made these eggs each weekend we've been home since finding them a couple of months ago! we vary them with the addition of onion and chopped jalapeno, onion, lox and dill, cream cheese and chopped bell peppers... YUM!

I was looking for a nice variation to "basic" scrambled eggs. We loved the addition of cream cheese. Also, before adding the butter to the pan, I added & mixed 1 T chopped shallots and 1 T chopped chives to the butter. It gave a great flavor. I will definitely make this again

I was really shocked at how fluffy and delicious these were with only water added. Lots of butter in the recipe probably didn't hurt anything....

These were good..perfect scrambled eggs! not everyone knows how to make a good scrambled egg..take my husband for instance....he over cooks everything! And to me there's nothing worse..anyway with this recipe..you cannot go wrong...I like my eggs soft..but not mushy soft..so I let them cook a bit...but they were good and not dry at all..I also took another reviewers suggestion and added a few hit's of fresh nutmeg before cooking...and it was great..the nutmeg..while undetctable..lent a nice depth of flavor...I cant wait to make these for the kids..and my husband!(along with a copy of this recipe of course)...These are like what you get when you go out for breakfast somewhere ...but with much more flavor...I had mine with half an onion bagel...good breakfast :)

I've always used milk to make my eggs -- never again. I also added onions to this recipe and then wrapped in warmed whole wheat tortillas when they were cooked -- finished off with grated parmesan cheese. It was delicious!

Craig, I'm sorry it took me this long to comment on your bone-headed review.....if you're so good in the kitchen, why look up scrambled eggs to begin with?

Oh, thank goodness somebody finally wrote down a recipe on how to scramble eggs. I have searched for years for a recipe and have never found one until now. The mystery of scrambled eggs is over. My long nightmare of culinary ignorance has come to a glorious end!

for really yummy scrambled eggs, add a little milk,a pinch of salt and pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. the nutmeg makes all the difference.

Instead of water, add milk and whisk, so much better...

I've never really been an egg eater, but there is something about adding the water that makes them taste better. Good idea.

Pretty basic but I would cut back on the butter. You can succesfully cook the eggs in 1 1/2 tblspn. Also, do not add the salt before cooking. It is best to season scrambled eggs to taste, after they are cooked
