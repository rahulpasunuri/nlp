always looking for raw food recipes that are tasty. Definitely will make it again. And next time I'll remember to not burn my first batch of sesame seeds.

This is a really weird recipe. Do you cook the beets??? Presumably, but it should make a mention of the fact. Aferall, there are many ways to cook beets.

A great recipe for using up fresh spinach. I used pickled beets and less vinegar, since that's all I had. It was even better the next day.

A beautiful and fresh tasting salad. Very easy (if you don't mind beet stained fingers afterward) with fresh flavors. Goes well with any asian-inspired food. Only problem is that it doesn't make enough dressing. I doubled that part of the recipe.
