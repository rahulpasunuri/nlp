These are great, I mash the beans, (I use dark red kidney beans) with my hands and it makes a nice consistency. I use between 1/4 - 1/2 cup of crumbs and have no problem with them holding together. Really yummy and very economical to make!

I am trying to cut meat out of one meal a day and decided to try these...with some changes. Instead of chili powder I used chipotle powder and a handful of cilantro. I forgot to add the tomatoes, but these were delicious! Served them with warm naan bread and sweet potato chips and never missed the meat.

These have a good flavor however I would add more jalapeño if you are looking for spicy. I had a major problem keeping them together in patty shapes but if you are VERY careful and use ALOT of cooking spray then it's much better. Other than the crumbly problem these were easy, good and healthy.

Loved it and let me tell you why. After reading all of the comments I took them to heart. I did add some corn to the mix. Then I packed the burgers into one of those rubber silicone muffin tins and froze them. When they were frozen I popped out them into a freezer bag. When I wanted one or more I half defrosted them and fried them and carefully pressed them down into burger shape taking care to keep them in shape. Worked beautifully. Tonight I fried one up and made a tacos salad for myself. I think the bbq sauce added the needed spice and interest.

Very good. Spice and texture wonderful but fell apart much too easily (crumbly). Next time maybe more eggs to bind.

These are a good - a little crumbly - but you can solve that by wrapping them in a tortilla to serve. But, then, why not just make a burrito?

Taste was good but not wonderful. Like the others stated, they crumbled.

You won't like them if you're looking for a meat-substitute, that's for sure. They were nicely filling and cooked well, but were a bit in need of extra spices and had a falling-apart problem. All in all I was pretty happy with them, but if I make them again, I will doctor them up a bit.

These were so much better than the veg. burgers that you purchase. My only problem was that they did not stick together well, meaning that they were a little juicy. This time I have made them early in the day and hop that the crumbs will stick together better. Other than that they were great. Even husband liked them and he hates beans. Wonder how they would taste with black beans and a little more spice. Yum.

Cooked these on the stovetop in a nonstick skillet and they were terrific. A nice change of pace!

I use more Jalepeno and a spicy BBQ sauce, to give it real kick. Also, because of it's consistency, I eat it in a pita with chunky blue cheese dressing.

This was very good. The burgers were a little hard to keep together on the grill. Next time I will try adding a few more breadcrumbs and 1 egg. Also this recipe only made two large patties.

Excellent use of jalapeno. those who like spicy food will love it.

Excellent, but I agree that the mixture as listed is too watery. I would eliminate the chopped tomato and also reduce the BBQ sauce proportion. Also, I added a 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro and added extra breadcrumbs. They were perfect.

The flavor on these is very good. But, the mixture was way too "saucy". If I made it again, I would reduce the amount of BBQ sauce and/or increase the amount of beans and breadcrumbs to make it less juicy!
