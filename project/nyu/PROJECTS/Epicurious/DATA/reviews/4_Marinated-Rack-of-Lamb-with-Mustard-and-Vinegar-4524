Simple and wonderful. Very tasty lamb with a hint of spice. Everyone at the BBQ loved it. Great for a summer day as a started and with wine.

If you make an emulsion (adding the olive oil bit by bit at last) while whisking, it will make a remarkable difference to this marinade. It will infuse beautifully, and the lamb will taste superb. I am really happy. Mixed pepper on top of it , at the last second before service was a great idea...cheers!

This is an easy delicious meal. It was my first time making rack of lamb, and it was really good. I used good quality balsamic vinegar so I only put one tablespoon of brown sugar. I added a pinch of fresh rosemary before serving.

This recipe is incredibly easy to make and absolutely amazing. The lamb is so juicy and tender and is certainly a crowd pleaser!

This recipe was easy to prepare but I think next time I try it I will add chopped rosemary. Lamb just doesn't tast the same without rosemary

Very easy to make and my guests all raved and asked for the recipe. This is a subtle preparation that lets the flavor of the lamb shine through.

This recipe left me dreaming about making it the next day and the day after that. I made it all summer and got rave reviews each time. The vinegar adds a tangy sweetness while the mustard gives it a heady heat. Really fantastic.

I have made this twice and both times it was absolutely delicious! My kids don't particularly like lamb but they love this dish! I barbeque it instead of bake it and it is wonderful!

Unlike other comments this was not the worlds greatest. Certainly simple to make and got great praises but I wasnt swept off my feet. I think the herb crust recipe a better choice.

This is the easiest and yet the most impressive dish I've ever prepared. I too use fresh garlic and cut down the amount dramatically. I can't say enough about this wonderful recipe!!

Great and simple way to make a delicious rack of lamb! Really, this is a 3.5 forks rating. Instead of Raspberry Vinegar, we use Balsamic. Also, because I use fresh cloves of crushed garlic, I do not use anywhere near 1/4 cup (more like 1 - 2 TBLS). THE WHOLE FAMILY, even our 6 year old loves, this dish!!!! My hubby's fav!

this was very simple and easy to do. The recommemded cooking time was a little too brief for my husband who doesn't like his lamb as rare as I do. I would also try cutting the brown sugar from 2 tablespoons to 1 next time if I use raspberry vinegar. I will definately try this again but I will use red wine vinegar instead. This is much easier than the committment to a whole leg of lamb!
