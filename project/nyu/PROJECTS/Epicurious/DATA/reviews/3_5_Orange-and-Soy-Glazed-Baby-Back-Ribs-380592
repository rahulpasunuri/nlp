This is an excellent recipe. I've never made ribs before so I was nervous, but I made it pretty much as is except a couple things: used cumin powder because I didn't have seeds, mine wasn't thickening either so used starch as another reviewer suggested. I only boiled them one hour as short on time and they were wonderfully tender. I will definitely make this again.

FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS RECIPE SHOULD READ "SPICY ORANGE AND SOY-GLAZED BABY BACK RIBS." SINCE IT DOESNT CLEARLY STATE SO. ANYBODY WHO IS NOT FAMILIAR WITH CRUSHED RED PEPPER AND HEADS OUT TO PURCHASE IT FOR THIS RECIPE IS IN FOR A SURPRISE. NOW THAT I GOT THAT OUT OF THE WAY.... THIS RECIPE DESERVES 5 FORKS! USUALLY IM NOT CRAZY ABOUT RECIPES BECAUSE YOU ARE COOKING ACCORDING TO SOMEONE ELSES TASTE BUT THIS RECIPE IS AN EXCEPTION! THE FLAVORS ARE INCREDIBLE TOGETHER, THE SPICE, ORANGE, CUMIN AND SOY GARNISHED WITH CITRUS...AMAZING! WHOEVER SAID THAT SEPARATING THE RIBS AND BOILING THEM IN SALT WOULD MAKE THEM TOUGH DOESNT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE SALT IS ALSO A TENDERIZER AND BOILING THE MEAT WITH ALL OF THE SEASONINGS KEEPS IT TASTY. I ADDED THE ORANGE SKINS AND LET THEM BOIL IN THERE AS WELL FOR ADDITIONAL FLAVOR. WHEN REMOVING THE RIBS FROM THE WATER I HAD TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL AS THE MEAT WAS ACTUALLY FALLING OFF THE BONE. WITH SOME PRECISION THE RIBS MADE IT TO THE FOIL LINED PAN AND WERE THEN COATED WITH THE DELICIOUS GLAZE. I TWEAKED THE SAUCE A LITTLE BIT TO MY LIKING, ADDING AN EXTRA 1/2 CUP OF ORANGE JUICE (IT WAS TROPICANA) AND THE REMAINING PULP OF THE ORANGE THAT I HAD FRESHLY SQUEEZED BEFORE HAND. I ALSO USED LIGHT AGAVE NECTAR IN PLACE OF THE HONEY. IF YOU HAVE A SENSITIVE TASTE TO SALT I WOULD DEFINITELY GO WITH LOW SODIUM SOY SAUCE. DONT PAY ATTENTION TO THE THE TIME IT SAYS YOU SHOULD BOIL THE SAUCE. COOK IT UNTILL IT THICKENS, PERIOD. BROIL THE RIBS EXACTLY AS IT SAYS, TILL THE SAUCE IS BUBBLING. TURN THEM OVER AND REPEAT UNTIL YOU RUN OUT OF SAUCE. AMAZING RIBS!

Not drop dead amazing, but a really nice alternative to bbq or asian glazed ribs. The meat just melted off the bones, and the sauce, which seemed too hot to bear when simmering was perfectly balanced: citrus, garlic, and cumin all came together for a nice mellow sauce. I did use the grill, rather than oven, though, so the tastes were smokey and subtle.

Just made it tonight. Family and guests all loved it. I made it ahead of time then put them on the grill just before serving......yum

If you're not careful, the sauce can be too thin but adding cornstarch solves that problem perfectly. Due to a shortage of cummin seeds in the house, I only added 2 teaspoons and it worked out great. Aside from that, I did not deviate from the recipe at all and it turned out brilliantly, new household favorite.

I'm not sure how this recipe could be given anything less than 3 forks? I cooked it for a dinner party, and everyone said it was amazing.... best ribs ever! I followed the recipe to a T.

Too much cumin in the sauce. Perhaps straining the sauce might help. Orange flavor completely. Overpowered by soy and cumin.

Never cut the ribs until they are ready to be served. By boiling ribs in individual units you are loosing all of the flavor of the meat especially because of all the salt (soy sauce) in the marinade/simmering sauce. Salt toughens meat by taking out natural juices. Overall sauce flavor is fine.

How interesting that the combination of orange and soy will have a great taste. I would like to share a relevant recipe as to this, http://ztdevel.gourmetrecipe.com/recipes/apple-cider-grilled-baby-back-ribs#en just follow the link and enjoy.

I don't know what went wrong, but this sauce was NASTY! I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using store-bought orange juice instead of squeezing my own. Sauce tasted like boiled week old sweat socks that had honey and red pepper added.

That is supposed to be four forks bur the review won't let me change it. This was really a great recipe. Unlike the previous reviewer below me, my sauce thickened up nicely. Too nicely, as I didn't have quite enough sauce to baste all of the ribs. Don't know if I reduced the sauce too long or need to make more sauce next time. Wonderful flavors!!

i loved everything about this recipe...but simmering the sauce even 20 minutes does not make it thicker...any suggestions? I also disagree with the reviewer who stated the ribs do not need to cook for 2 hours...this made them absolutely succulent, not dry. Be sure the directions to cover completely with water are followed, and perhaps yours won't be dry. Recipe is extremely tasty and presentation is beautiful, meaning I will serve for guests next time!!!

Awesome! I've made these three times with huge raves every time. First time, I followed the recipe to a T. Good but too salty. Now I always make them with low sodium soy sauce. I also put in a little extra honey. Finally, I add toasted sesame seeds with the the zest for serving.

Made this for dinner last night, and everyone agreed they were EXCELLENT! Used pork back ribs and followed the recipe exactly. Easy recipe, delicious food.

This recipe was really interesting and delicious. I added ginger like the other reviewer and cut back on the cumin and pepper flakes because my husband isn't a fan of heat. I made these in my pressure cooker instead of the stove top and transferred them to the oven to finish.

One more thing... the individual ribs do not need to cook for 2 hours. One hour is adequate, or the ribs will be dry.

Just perfect. Wonderful contrast of sweet, spicy, and sour. For those who said it was too salty, use sodium- reduced soy sauce (40% less sodium). Do not reduce the volume of soy sauce or your sauce won't have the right proportions. I made a half recipe for my husband and myself, but intend to make this for my gourmet group. Delicious!!

The perfect combination of braise and finish -- came out tender and crusty at the same time. Loved the flavor, thanks.

We loved the citrus "faux gremolata", but found the sauce too salty. For those who are salt sensitive, I would suggest using only 1/4 cup soy sauce in the orange/soy reduction.

A great change up from traditional barbecued ribs. The flavor is subtle and refreshing.

Very tasty and easy to make. Next time, I will add minced ginger root (thumb-sized piece) with the garlic, reduce cumin seeds to 4 tsp, rather than 5, and add 3 Tbsp. of sugar with the honey.
