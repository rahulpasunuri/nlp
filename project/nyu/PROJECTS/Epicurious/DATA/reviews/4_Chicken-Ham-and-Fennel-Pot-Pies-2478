Omigoodness, these were divine. They do take a bit of work, but the fennel is just amazing. I used lowfat milk and they still tasted rich. I also used half chicken thighs and half breasts.

Absolutely delicious!!! I was in a hurry so I bought a cooked chicken from the store shredded it and bought a pie crust. I did what another reviewer wrote and made it in a 9" pie pan with crust on the bottom and top. Fabulous. Rave reviews. I also added celery and onion. Next time I will make them in the soufflé dishes and make the crust.

I've been making this recipe forever... and it's simply the best chicken pot pie ever. Did I mention the ham? Yes, it seems that pork and chicken have a natural affinity for each other. Add peas... just because no chicken pot pie is complete without them. And use quality ham, because that's the star of this dish.

Made exactly as written, no substitutions, even the pie crust. It was just too rich for my tastes but my husband loved it. I think you really really have to like fennel.

I love love love this recipe and make it often. I tried making the crust on my own for the first time and will continue doing so from now on. Next time I will use half to 1/4 of the shortening called for... there was way too much for my taste. I think it could use more water as well.

This was a major hit! I used a rotisserie chicken and pulled the meat from that as opposed to using the skinless boneless breasts that were called for. I also added frozen peas along with the carrots. Next time I think I will incorporate some fresh sage and use proscuitto instead of deli ham (I used Boar's Head brand.) Last but not least, I used puff pastry instead of making the pie crust from scratch. I just followed the baking instructions from that instead of the recipes 375 degree/40 minute suggestion. Will definitely make these again!

Outstanding on a cold night--for a spouse with a cold. The heavily aromatic fennel and lemon juice turn the sauce into a wonderful liquor. I did add celery and more carrots than called for. I also used homemade chicken stock, which I always have handy, along with plenty of frozen chicken breasts. This one is a winner.

The Family loves this. During the fall I use pheasant instead of chicken. I also add some cubed red potatoe and frozen peas. Works well in regular sized pie crusts, but you may need to cover the edges of crust 1/2 way through. I gave two of them to my mother (who is kind of a food snob), and she liked them enough to serve at her next casual dinner party. Have fun with it and make it your own!

YUM YUM YUM!! believe these reviews. This was a very tasty, delicious pie. One of the best i've ever made. I was concerned about the quantity of fennel used, but the flavours came out nicely. Husband loved it and licked his plate AND mine. We both went back for seconds. I should note that i used low fat milk and store bought pastry.

My family and friends LOVE this pie. Like others we made a few modifications to cut down on calories and time. We use store bought crust, add peas, use low fat milk and purchase a pre-cooked chicken from the grocery store and pull it apart. It makes making this tasty dish an easy Tuesday night dinner! Love the fennel.

Sorry.... I forgot that I add 3-4 medium Yukon Gold or White potatoes cut in bite-size pieces when I add the chicken, carrot, onion and celery.

We are not big fennel fans so we have modified this recipe to suit our personal tastes. You purists who do not believe in changing recipes can stop reading now. I use homemade chicken broth and add chicken, carrot, onion and celery and boil for 10 minutes as menu describes. I add sliced mushrooms after five minutes. I don't need to tell you cooks out there how much onion, celery, or mushrooms to add.... you'll know. I follow the recipe the rest of the way except that I do not use fennel seed and substitute several pinches of dry thyme. If you try my version, I hope you like it. Let me know if you do.

Absolutely delicious! The fennel really makes this pot pie recipe extraordinary. I poached the chicken in some broth, but I cooked the fennel and carrots (I sliced both with a mandolin), along with the fennel seeds, in some olive oil. I thought some of the flavor would be cooked off and discarded in the broth and they would be too soft. I took them off the heat while they still had a slight crunch, as I knew they would continue cooking in the oven. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I highly recommend this and I`m looking forward to making it again.

These things are incredible. They've become a coveted treat in my family, and we fondly refer to them as "Chiffenhams". I like to make two modifications to this recipe. First, you can comfortably use HALF the amount of fat when making the pie crust. Second, I make these in a large muffin tin (so I get 6 of them), which helps with the portion control, because, believe me, you're going to want to hoover up half of this pie when you make it. Mini pies also freeze beautifully, and if I need a quick lunch, I just toss one and a small ziplock of salad greens in my bag as I head out the door.

This is my 4 year running hit signature dish. I recommend following the recipe to a 't' until you get to the carrots (throw in some frozen peas/carrots combo). Also I like use more black forest ham than required. Actually crushing fennel seeds is a pain, but easily do-able in a coffee grinder if you feel compelled, but it won't make or break this dish. Last, and most importantly, I make one big pot pie in a large ceramic dish. I buy store bought crusts, roll them out, line the bottom of the dish with several butter pelts, the sides are heavily greased, I lay the crust over the bottom, drizzle in a bit of chicken broth, build up the sides of the dish with additional crust. I then pour in the mixture, and create a covering with the left overcrust- and you guessed it- I drizzle more broth on that. And at a few intervals in the cooking. It turns out better than words can describe!

This was a good, even great pot pie but not yet the pot pie I want. The pie crust was perfect- absolutely no room for improvement there. Thought the fennel in the pie was a little overbearing. I would only make it again if I added a few other flavors to smooth out the fennel. I would not cut out or lessen the fennel however because it would not leave much flavor to the dish. That being said,it is the best pot pie recipe I tried yet and my husband loved it and gave it a 5/5.

Rating: 4
Excellent. A crowd favourite and one dish that is requested often! I use no-salt chicken broth and leave out the ham. Add frozen peas, green beans, diced potato. I cook everything in chicken broth and reserve cup of broth for adding to the milk/flour. I also add some dried parsley and small pinch of smoked paprika.

Rating: 3
This amount makes two 9" pies exactly - both the filling and pastry. I could not taste the fennel that much but it added a nice slightly crunchy and fresh element to the rich pie. This recipe is OK but nothing special. The pastry is good and is the one I use all the time. It was a large party so in addition to these two pies I made another one using the Take Home Chef's chicken and leek pie. That called for puff pastry but since I didn't want to make it or use Pepperidge Farm (no butter) or to pay the $9.99/8 oz for Dufour (I would have needed twice this as it was a double crust pie) I made "rough puff" pastry. The pastry, while not quite the same as real puff, was very good and pretty quick to make. That pie was rated as far better, by my mostly British born family, than the fennel one. One difference was that the Take Home Chef added a tablespoon of dijon mustard to the white sauce which really added to the flavor but did not overpower the creamy sauce.

I had just made chicken stock when I came across this recipe, so I used it to cook the vegetables and chicken, then strained it and used the stock to make the sauce instead of the bechamel in the recipe. I used two chicken breasts, half a large fennel bulb, two stalks of celery, half an onion, three baby green peppers rescued from my garden before a frost, the carrots, half the amount of fennel seed and about three tablespoons of fresh chervil from the garden-a wonderful addition. I made my usual pate brise which is similar to the one here. I had enough filling for four Pyrex custard cup size pies, and they were just wonderful. I guarantee these will appear often at our house.

One of the nicest chicken pies ever. Can't wait for the left overs for lunch.

We really liked this pot pie. It took a little longer to prepare than I expected but outcome was worth it. I agree with others...if you can, make more filling than needed and freeze remainder for later. I made 4 pot pies and froze filling for 4 more. I used store bought pie crust. Other than that, I didn't change a thing.

Best epicurious recipe I've ever tried! This is in regular rotation during the Fall/Winter with my crew. I make individual pot pies and leave the chicken out for my vegetarian teen. The fennel seed makes all the diff, and the fennel bulb is great, too, when I can remember to buy it. I change up the other ingredients all the time, depending on what's on hand....very forgiving. And, BTW, don't skip the homemade crust. It's super easy and WELL worth the effort. I use the crust for all kinds of other dishes. Have one in the freezer right now getting ready for tonight's Tomato Pie.

I made this recipe last night and it was fantastic! I followed other reviewers advice and only used 1/2 the fennel seed but I will try it next time with all of it because I didn't find the taste overwhelming. I also used the reserved broth to make a chicken soup and just added a little uncooked chicken, 1/2 a box of pasta noodles, frozen peas & corn, and some chopped carrots and cooked it on med low for about 35 minutes. Also I used one large pie dish instead of the individual ones and had some dough left over from the crust and I rolled the leftover dough in a ball and flattened it some and baked it in the oven with the pie for 40 minutes and it was great with jam. The crust was fairly easy to make and really did taste delicous and much better than a store bought crust or puff pastry. I did double the amount of carrots in the recipe and that turned out nicely. Will definitely be making this again soon.

SO SO GOOD! This was the best chicken pot pie I've had. I am a mom of 3 so I used a ready made crust and doubled the recipe to freeze. The fennel and ham added great flavor. I threw in two cans of Veg-All because there were not enough veggies.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times and it is somehow so incredibly good. If you have never had cooked fennel it is worth a try- it's both sweet and savory. I always add a lot more veggies- peas, extra carrots, pearl onions, green beans. I use half fennel seed/half celery seed as others have suggested. Also,in place of whole milk I use a combination of skim milk and the chicken broth used to cook the chicken in. Always thickens fine, and the taste is heavenly. I make a double batch and freeze half in a casserole for another day-just thaw in fridge for 24h, stir, top with puff pastry (so easy) and it's perfect!

Really good. Can't compare to frozen or even fresh made a Marie Callendar's. Just did not care for the lemon juice. It smells wonderful baking up!

I love this recipe but my wife does not like the taste of fennel. I modified the recipe by removing the fennel and fennel seeds, but added 1/2 cup each of onion and celery when I cook the chicken. I also add a dash of dried thyme when I season with salt and pepper. I made add peas next time, too.

I love this recipe, and have been making it since it was first in the magazine. I make it every year right after Thanksgiving. It is the perfect use for leftover turkey, ham and pre-made pastry crusts. I sautee the vegetables by themselves, and add them to the sauce with the leftover turkey, ham and other ingredients, and throw it in a 9" deep dish pie plate with one large crust over the top. Quick and easy, and a great break from leftovers.

This was simple and delicious. I substituted crisp bacon, celery and par- boiled potatoes. Great blending of flavors the bacon and fennel add so much to the suace.

delicious! just like everyone said... really good with a slight sweet zing from the fennel and carrot. i had plenty of filling left over, so the next day i felt quite inventive and made up some pretty mini-parcel pies with a simple flour+water+butter recipe... and i FRIED them. it was so yummy and kept for a whole day (i took my little chicken pot pie parcel babies to a picnic). yummy!!! will do again.

Quite good crowd pleaser. Changes: 1) made 1 big casserole instead of individual and tucked pastry down on top of mixture instead of to top edge of dish. 2) think I used extra broth 3) next time try dark meat (pain to cut out breast tendons); 4) added frozen peas (next time also add celery) when first adding fennel to broth 5) used only 1.5 sm fennel bulbs (1 might even be ok) 6) added sauteed mushies and little bit onion to drained fennel-chix mixture. 7) replaced little of milk with stock. 8) might have cooked on stove(or left out) completed filling to make less liquid. 9) used 1 t fennel seeds + 1 t celery seed in place of 2 t fennel seed. 10) Made 1 day in advance and chilled uncooked. Next day brought to room temp and baked beautifully (careful not to overbake).

This was so easy to make--I made them ahead and then popped them in the oven for 40 minutes--easy! I served this to two 8-year-olds and two 5-year-olds (playdate at our house) and the kids loved it! I cut out leaves and hearts to decorate the tops. Lovely. Will definitely use this recipe as a base to make a million other variations of pot pie.

It's a keeper. The minor changes I made were to use lardons in place of the ham, which gave it a slight smoky edge, adding cubed potatoes, and a spice substitution. Preparing this in a bachelor-friend's pad not equipped with much more than salt, pepper and cinnamon, I found one of those cheap little spice mills of "5 crudités" - worked great. The fresh lemon juice accounts for a subtle zing that really makes the sauce, in my opinion. I should also add that not having 8 ramekins, I made this in one big clay dish. This will be a standard for me now. It's easy (especially if you use a good pre-packaged dough for the crust) and tastes great.

This was really great! I made it without fennel(was trying to head off my 3-year-old's excuses not to eat up front!) I will add it next time. This is a great winter dish on a cold snowy night. As for the pie crust, I made my own for years until I had to buy one for some reason. I will never make another again unless it has some special ingredients! Believe me, my friends call me a Martha Stewart wanna be because I make my own chicken stock and whipped cream (what's so hard about throwing whipping cream in a mixer anyway?! I guess that's a discussion for another time...) I can't tell the difference and neither can anyone else!

Yum yum yum. I have always wanted to cook with fennel, since I've only ever eaten it raw. It was a great complement to this pot pie. A nice cheesy flavor, with meatyness from the chicken and sweetness from the fennel. Even used (gasp!) 2% milk. We prepared them on Sunday then cooked them after work Monday. Very tasty! My tip: crust never looks as dark when you're peering in the oven as it is when it comes out, so don't wait too long to take the pies out. Mine were nicely browned, but when I let all the steam out, I let most of the moisture out as well. Don't let kiddies eat until they've been de-steamed--they're very hot!! (3.5 rating, only because it's naughty for the dieter)

My husband really liked this dish, AND it was easy to make. I made them early in the afternoon, then froze two pies and refrigerated the other two until dinner time. I really liked being able to do the work early, then put them into the oven later, allowing me to relax at dinner time!

I tried this as an alternative to the Chicken and Fall Vegetable pot pie. It was easy, delicious, and almost as good as the other one, with about 3 hours less work involved. I tried others' suggestions of substuting celery seed for half of the fennel seed and adding broth to thin out the gravy with great results. Definitely a keeper I'll be making again.

This is the most awesome recipe I've come across for "pot pie"! I have made this recipe probably 20 times (no kidding), and it freezes very well! I usually reserve the broth for the White Turkey Chili Recipe available on Epicurious. Also, my modification..... rather than 2 teaspoons of fennel seeds, I use 1 teaspoon fennel seed and 1 teaspoon of celery seed. I also add celery to the broth, as well as two sliced onions. You will love it!

UNBELIEVABLE!! This recipe is unbelievably excellent. I always make changes, but aside from adding chicken broth to thin it out, I followed it. Oh, well, almost...I cut the recipe in half and used a lb of chicken. I also used chunks of ham. I almost whimped out and bought frozen pie crust. Glad I didn't!! I'm a pretty avid cook, can't bake (or maybe just hate it!!) so it was my first pie crust. It was wonderful.

Passed the husband test - would definitely make it again. Didn't take as long as expected even though I inadvertantly added the white sauce before straining the pot. No problemo! I made a new batch of white sauce and used the strained broth for a potato soup that rivaled my old recipe.

I made this receipe alot and then lost it. I had several requests from friends and my husband to make it again for a couple of years. I just found it here and can't wait to make it again. I think the fennel has a very novel sweet taste that is accented by the carrots.

This is real cozy food - we loved it. A couple of alterations we made: added some sauteed shallots to the sauce, and extra chicken stock to make it less "sticky." The results were great. Also added some fresh rosemary to the pie crust, nice combination with the fennel. Would definitely make this again.

We can't get over how good these pot pies are. (Swanson, hang your head in shame!) We have made them several times for ourselves and for company, and they seem to get better every time. We even went to Williams Sonoma to get souffle dishes to give this dish the appearance it deserves.
