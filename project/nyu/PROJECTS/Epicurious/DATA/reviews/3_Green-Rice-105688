I used 2 poblanos that weighed 3/4 lb, and next time will use more to give it more spice. Only used cilantro, as per other's recommendations and was great. Mixed 1 cup brown rice with 1 cup white rice.

Results were godawful. Bitter and harsh. Roasted and peeled peppers would have been better.

My sister-in-law made almost exactly the same recipe for the family months ago and I have been looking to duplicate it. Hers used cilantro, and the previous reviewer suggested adding it, so I added a good packed handful of fresh cilantro leaves. I also had to add more liquid and cook the rice longer (about 35 minutes before letting is sit). The end results were excellent- this is a great side with stuffed poblanos!

recipe is delicious but the online version here doesn't list cilantro in the ingredients. it is called for in the preparation instructions and it was on tv - so just a small mistake i guess.
