A really good quick recipe. Instead of adding the unpeeled shrimp to the sauce, I peeled them and made a quick shrimp stock with the shrimp shells--simmered for 20 minutes or so.I used the stock instead of the water in the recipe, which I think added flavor and made it easier to eat.

A great dish with a little kick-- a warm french baguette accompanies this well to dip in the left over sauce. I always try out new recipes when I have company (probably a little risky!) but this one is fool proof! Also to make it a little more healthy, I cut the butter by half and added a little water. It keeps the same flavor but with fewer calories.

My mother made this for me for my birthday dinner more than 10 years ago-- I loved it so much that I requested it as a "special" dinner any chance that I had. Years later I wanted to make a special dinner for who is now my fiance-- I got this recipe from my mom and I couldn't believe how easy it was! And all this time I thought my mom was slaving away... He was impressed (as I was when my mom first made it) and now it's MY little secret. This is definitely a favorite recipe that I have made many, many times. Generally I serve it with crusty bread, fresh home made cole slaw and a chardonnay or pinot noir.

I'm not a big shrimp fan, but my husband is. I decided to try this recipe since I love spicy Cajun food. I liked it so much that now I make it for myself for lunch or dinner even if my husband is not in the mood for shrimp. I imagine it's great with crusty bread, but it's equally tasty with brown rice. Take a tip from a previous reviewer and buy the deveined, frozen shrimp. It makes the recipe a breeze!

This is a fabulous recipe! It was so easy to make and the sauce is very flavorful. To save work, buy the shrimp already deveined. And when you think of it, other than the shrimp, you probably have all of the ingredients on hand (just make sure your rosemary isn't too old).

Quick and easy. A great lunch with some red wine and crusty bread

This was very easy to make and delicious. The only thing that puzzles me is why we are instructed to reduce the sauce to 1/2 cup when the ingredients don't call for that much liquid. I would definitely make again because the sauce is tasty over rice. Since this is basically a butter sauce, you could substitute any herbs you like in place of the rosemary.

This is great and easy! Serve crusty bread to dip in the sauce. An indulgence, but worth it. I've shared the recipe.

There is a restaurant in Los Angeles, CA that serves this dish for $13.95 per person. This recipe is great and fool proof. It's the same as the restaurant but not as expensive for a party of four. Try it and you will understand why many Californians travel far out of their area to partake of this delight.

This is a simple and fantastic recipe for the shrimp lover. We sometimes use 1/2 the Worcestershire and make up the difference with PickaPepper for an extra kick. Coarse ground black pepper is also preferable. Whenever we've served it to company there's always requests for the recipe.

This is a more complex version of a simple shrimp dish. The basic version is for every pound of shrimp (size matters not), melt one stick of butter, 2 tablespoons of Wort. sauce, and 1.5 tbls of black pepper (less if pepper-shy). Put shrimp in a glass casserole dish. Pour sauce over them, add some lemon juice, and bake in oven for 15 minutes (or until done) at 375. Serve with good French bread and you have an amazing, simple, rather unhealthy dish.

This dish was terrible! After one taste, the rest went down the drain. I may have overlooked an igredient, but I don't think so. Either way, I'll never make it again.

I have doubled, tripled and quadrupled this recipe for company with superb results each time. Everyone is suprised how easy it is and asks for the recipe.

My family enjoyed this dish. They said it made a great change from the ordinary. It is good enough to serve to company. It also freezes.

I thought this recipe was absolutely delicious! We doubled the recipe and spooned it over a small dish of angel hair pasta, fantastic!

The only real criticism I have is that because the shrimp is still in the shell, it doesn't soak up enough of the sauce. The next time I cook prepare this I plan to marinate the shrimp in the sauce (sans butter of course because I haven't heated anything yet) for at least half an hour.

Had this recipe (made with whole peeled and deveined shrimp)served in ramekins on a large plate with a salad of field greens with a light vinaigrette and of course the French bread for soaking up the wonderful shrimp sauce. Excellent!
