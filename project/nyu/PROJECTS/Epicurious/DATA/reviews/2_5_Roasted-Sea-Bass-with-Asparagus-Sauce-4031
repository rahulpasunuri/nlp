I was interested in this dish. I have not made it yet but I can already suggest some alterations. Mainly, where are the aromatics in the sauce?! No wonder people thought it was bland! I will definitely add some garlic, shallot, and probably some thyme. I hadn't thought to pair these two items together, so I am excited to taste it. I will rate it after...

This is nice dish to make for a light dinner. The asparagus sauce has a fresh taste against the light taste of the fish. Sea Bass is expensive so I substituted with cod instead. I have made this several times and is one of my favorite simple recipes.

If you're going to spring for sea bass, make the miso-glazed sea bass from this site. It's my best fish dish. Everyone loves it.

I did not find this dish bland. I use organic aspargus and organic chicken stock, olive oil that has had rosemary in it for a few months. My husband, my 5 & 3 yr old all asked for more. I served the fish & sauce with organic brown basmati rice. I'll make this again.

The asparagus puree is good, but not as a sauce for the fish. Veggie purees are great as side dishes, but it really did not work well here. We'll try a more exciting sea bass recipe next time.

I agree...this was a waste of sea bass, which is not cheap. Will not make again :(

I thought the sauce was VERY bland and not a good use of sea bass, which is fairly expensive. Come to think of it, it wasn't a very good use of asparagus either! NOT GREAT. Will not make it again. My bofriend, who likes most things was unimpressed.

I agree that this is a rather bland dish...it is visually apetizing though. In order to add to the flavor, I used undiluted canned chicken broth. The recipe does not specify this. Also, one should always peel the asparagus before cooking.

this is very easay and delicious. Make sure you buy very thick sea bass and do not overcook. It's low calorie and very satisfying. My guest and I loved it.

Excellent dish! I made it for guests and they were very much impressed. Make sure you use tender asparagus stalks or else it gets stringy when making the sauce.

Served at dinner party for 8. Made sauce ahead of time, just popped fish in oven 15 minutes before serving. Guests loved it.

The asparagus sauce was very bland; it needed some sort of herbs or spices. My husband and I both found it very plain and untasty.
