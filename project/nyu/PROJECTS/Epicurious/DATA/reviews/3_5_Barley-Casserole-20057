So good. I added a bit of wine before the broth for the heck of it. Really good side - I had forgotton how much I like barley and get in a rice rut.

This was surprisingly delicious. I kept the ingredients the same, but changed the method a bit - I sauteed the onion, THEN added the barley, let it brown a bit, and then the mushrooms (I figured the water from the mushrooms would prevent the barley from browning). Also, because I needed my oven at a lower temp for braising, I just cooked the dish stove top. It was really yummy. I added a bit of herbes de provence, but considering how simple this was, I give it four forks for the nutrition:taste:effort ratio. :)

So good!!! Such a savory yummy dish! We had it plus salad for dinner and fought over the leftovers the next night. It does take a while to cook, at least an hour, but it's totally worth it. Make this tonight and ENJOY!

I made this on the stove top instead of the casserole/baking route and it came out great (sauteed onion in saucepan, added barley and broth, simmered until done). I left out the mushrooms because I didn't have any and it was still great.

I love this dish. I make it for dinner, pot lucks, special occasions, etc. It never fails to elicit requests for the recipe.

I've made this a few times. A solid side dish. Once made it with asparagus and shiitake mushrooms--was great.

We used 1 lb. of mushrooms for this because that is what we needed to use up. Due to that we doubled the butter to 1/2 c. This was delicious! Even the children loved it and asked for seconds. I think this is one of the best and EASIEST side dishes I've made. We will be making this again and frequently!

I love this recipe. It is easy, healthy, and a hit when I bring it places (everyone asks for the recipe). I make a few alterations: I use olive oil instead of butter for health reasons, add sauted spinach to mixture, use a good vege broth (stop and shop's natures promise is our favorite for this recipe) and add mozzarella on top.I am making some tomorrow and am going to try it without the spinach and with cheddar because that is what I have.

I heeded the advice of others and timed my other dishes to allow for a longer cooking time. I did end up cooking for 45 minutes. You could probably get just as wonderful results with a little less butter too if you are concerned about nutrition. It keeps well and has a great hearty flavor and texture. Probably best for a fall or winter dish.

When I shopped for this recipe I had 1 1/2 pounds of mushrooms on my mind so that's what I bought. I used them anyways and it really came out nice. (You need to like mushrooms for this version!) It took about 50 minutes to get to a nice chewy stage. I used all 3 cips of broth and added an extra 1/4 barley since I had so many mushrooms. Turned out delicious. Will make again 4 sure!

This is a very hearty and tasty vegetarian recipe (if you use vegie broth). My hubby loved it. Please note that the recipe says to check the casserole after 25 minutes and add more broth if needed. It does not say it will be done in 25. It takes almost an hour. Allow for this!

This dish will now be a staple in our diet. My husband and I loved it.

I actually had the cookbook it came from and lost it. I've been looking for this recipe for a while, we're using it for a Medieval themed wedding for my sister.

So easy and so good. I reduced the amount of butter to 3 Tbsp and came out so well. I will definitely make this again.

This is a great dish for busy nights. I use a good golden vegetarian broth, but otherwise I don't modify the recipe.

This was excellent! I forgot to boil the broth before adding it to the dish, so I popped in in the microwave for 7-8 minutes before putting it in the oven. The texture was great and there was no need for additional liquid.

This is an old classic! My mom used to make this and this recipe is just as good! It is the perfect side dish to ANY meal!

Yuck. This dish is very filling, not very flavorful. It took about 45 minutes (not 25) for the liquid to be absorbed, and the barley to move beyond rock hard. I have come to rely on Epicurious and reviewer's forks in 2 years? this is the first time I've been disappointed.

Very popular at my Christmas dinner. I added about a 1/4 oz. of rehydrated porcini plus their soaking water. I also used homemade beef stock. It's easy to make ahead!

My mother taught me this recipe 60 years ago. She always added garlic and reconstituted dry mushrooms and used either chicken or beef stock(home made). This recipe, with it's many variations is a virtual staple in my home and adding meat pieces to the casserole makes it our main course.

When I made this recipie I added toasted slivered almonds and a little chopped fresh parsley at the very end. I've been experimenting with vegetarian dishes lately, and this one has been one of my favourites so far. This one will be made again and again...

last night I cooked this for the first time,I also found that 75 minutes cooking time was needed and also raised the temp to 425 and cooked without cover after the first 25 minutes. I used celery, mushrooms, and water chestnuts, and served with chicken livers on top, it was great.

I made a vegetarian meal out this instead of a side dish by adding pine nuts, walnuts, mozarella cheese, broccoli, and asparagus. It was delicious, and not too difficult to make. I used less butter (only 2 tbsp)than called for for health purposes, and substituted olive oil instead when sauteing the onions and mushrooms. Only comment is that I had to bake the casserole for 75 minutes (not the 25 listed in the recipe) to get the barley to reconstitute.
