This was quick and easy, make one day before and its ready when you are. We added a little garlic. Refreshing!

This is a Christmas favorite. It is light, and delicious. We serve it hot and always fight over the leftovers. We also like the toamtoes a little chunky.

This soup was bland, tasteless and needed much doctoring to make it edible. The uncooked tomato tasted bland so I added a full can of stock , a 1/4 cup of rice and extra basil and cooked for 30 minutes. This improved the taste considerably but I would not try this recipe again.

Delicious and very fresh tasting. I left out the sour cream (didn't have any) and it was just fine.

Wonderful, fresh tomato taste when made with tomatoes from your garden or a friend's. An easy way to ensure a good texture is to run the puree through a food mill, rather than using a sieve. With a spatula, scrape what comes through the mill into the bowl (along with the juice that drips through on its own). If you crank the food mill too vigorously and see small seeds in the mix after milling, you can sieve those out just prior to filling the bowls. Another note: I ended up using more sugar -- about a tablespoon -- because my tomatoes were somewhat acidic. Didn't make the toasts but they sound good.

An excellent vehicle for fresh summer tomatoes. While the straining is an extra step, you don't have seeds and skin that way. With a bounty crop of both basil and tomatoes, this makes a lovely summer lunch.

This was time consuming to me, pushing the tomatoes through a strainer and it didn't quite thicken up like I would have liked. The flavor was very good but just not thick enough.
