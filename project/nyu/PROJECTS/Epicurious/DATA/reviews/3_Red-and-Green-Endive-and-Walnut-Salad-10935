I am not a big fan of endives, but I have made the dressing several times with baby romaine and it never fails to be inhaled by my guests. It doesn't even need the walnuts.

Just want to comment on this -- I was looking for a walnut vinaigrette for a simple green salad and decided to go with this. When I put the salad on the table, one of my guests said, "whoa! that's a lot of salad." But she was the one to finish it off!
