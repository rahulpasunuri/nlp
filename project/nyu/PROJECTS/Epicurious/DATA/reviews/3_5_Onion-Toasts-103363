So good! I checked the site Easter morning for a little something I could throw together with stuff I had on hand. They were a hit! Also made some bruschetta and some people didn't care for the tomatoes so they knocked some off onto the platter. I picked up a couple and added it on top OMG it was amazing. Next time I'm going to blend the two and see what I get.

What a forgotten gem! Mom used to make these years & years ago. Just made them again tonight. In the past I have served them hot, room temp, cold. Whatever the temp, the guys scarf them down like potato chips. Now that's a real winner!

While this recipe was easy, and proportionately good, it was nothing "to die for." For a similar taste (with a little more effort and flavor) try "Lindy's Crab Dip" on Google.

So easy, it's practically a dump-dump-stir recipe. Two comments: 1) I found that I got more than 12 appetizers from the amount of the spread; 2) Be prepared to get a little embarrassed when guests go, "These are great! What's in them?" My super-articulate response: "Uh, mayo..."

Easy and delicious.

This was excellent. Sweet and tangy and salty all at the same time. Used thinly sliced whole wheat roll instead of the cocktail rye. Very simple-- took about 3 minutes to put a few of these together for a light supper.

Unfussy, tasty, and interesting! I have served this simple, delicious hors d'oeuvres many times and my guests always ask for the recipe. The Cook from Ottawa said it so well, "The perfect little recipe."

fussy, bland and uninteresting. I found this recipe a lot of trouble for very little reward.

Can't wait to try the variation Sue from Oak Ridge, NJ described. As written though, it's a keeper for nights when all you want is munchies. I do these up in my toaster oven and it's perfection every time. So easy and so tasty. It's ok with light mayo too by the way.

From Ottawa, Canada. I served this recently to friends, and they could not believe how good it was, and never had it before. I will be making it again for Easter Sunday. I mixed everything together and broiled. How easy is that? Perfect little recipe.

THIS ROCKS! There is not much more I can say. Slather the mayo with the onions, kick up some spice or savory flavors if you would like and broil away. You can not fail with these. I will make them for the rest of my life for every party I have.

The hubby came up with the idea to carmelize the onions first in olive oil first on very slow heat then added a pat of butter, s & p, and a pinch of brown sugar - then followed the rest of the recipe and it was fantastic! All were gone in minutes! Thanks for a great recipe!

I, too, have been making this hors d'oeuvre for over 30 years. The reason it is such a favorite is that it's so good and so easy. I always have Parmesan, mayonnaise, and onion on hand. Since I don't always have cocktail rye, I cut small rounds of bread from regular slices, and that works as a base very well too. When you use bread rounds, you get as many as 24 from this recipe!

So simple and so tasty. I served them for a party and even people that are not onion fans really liked this recipe. They will be on the Christmans snack table!

This has to be in the top 2 of the all time best cocktail offerings! My version was to use the worcestershire, chopped onion mixed with mayo, parm cheese & topped with a slice of stuffed green olive. Oh! And I did not toast the 1st side. Just smeared the stuff on, put on the olive slice & under the broiler until "puffy". Thirty years ago I used the "stuff in the green can" & it was great. I've since discovered the joy of REAL parmesan & use it now. However---the "stuff in the green can" made this toast famous.

Delicious! Mixed the Parmesan in with the mayo. A big hit on the 4th of July! Will be sure to make again, KIMBER

My college roomate and friend of 20+ years came to stay for a cook-off weekend. We were anxious to try this time honored recipe. We used both the pumpernickel & the rye and decided the pumpernickel was the only way to go. Out of 17 recipes including doughnuts, molten lava cakes etc. this was our favorite by far. Definitely tried & true.

Very tasty and quick and easy! Everyone loved them. I needed a few things that contained no meat for a few vegetarians in my family. (Besides the usual meatballs, and meat salad sandwiches). These were a great addition to my party.

Easy to make and delicious! I made them as hors d'oeurves for a dinner party and got raves. Next time, I'll keep a better eye on the toasting phase as I left them in a little too long and they got slightly burned.

So glad to find this, it was a Christmas tradition in my family home for years and I wanted to share it with my new in-laws. Add the Worstchester and plain old Kraft parmesan from the green can will do just fine!

I was uncertain about these. Mayonnaise and onion? But what a wonderful, simple to prepare treat. These are the solid form of French onion soup--absolutely scrumptious and the hit of the party.

Since I am rather fond of onions, I thought I might like this one, modifying it only a bit. Having a bounty of fresh herbs and vegetables, I added about a tablespoon of fresh minced oregano and one minced jalapeno (less the seeds)to the finely minced onion in the mayo. This is absolutely a KEEPER!

My grandmother used to serve these at her cocktail parties she and her husband would give almost every evening in the summertime. I found her old Joy of Cooking from 1954 and this recipe is just the same & it's wonderful. However, there was an addition that she used: a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce & a sprinkling of either cayenne or paprika. I tried both versions last night and both are terrific.

Thanks, Hope in Virginia for this good old standby! My mother made this for so many family and company gatherings while I was growing up in Connecticut. Don't know where she got the recipe. She always made it with chopped onions, and everybody who likes onions and cheese hot from the oven loved these! So easy, but good.
