This was very good, but was not what I expected. It was kind of orangey in color and seemed thin, but very tasty and picky husband loved it. As usual, I did double most of the spices, except the peppers.

Once you get past the special trip to the Indian grocery, this soup is ridiculously easy to make, and the payoff is HUGE. I've made it three times already in the few weeks since I found the recipe. One caution, though...I use the one red pepper, and no green. I THOUGHT the ones I was buying were serrano, but maybe not...? Because we like pretty spicy dishes, and this has plenty of heat with just the one pepper, I cannot imagine adding the three green ones. No way. Also, if you like any leftovers at all, double the recipe. I think I will probably start tripling it, actually. Lovely, lovely recipe...one of my new favorites.

instead of chopping your ginger, try grating it on a box grater instead. the ginger dissolves and you don't get any chunks. Plus it's extra easy and fast (I don't even bother peeling after I wash it, I don't think it improves the taste, so why bother?) and if you freeze any leftover ginger root before it goes off it's an easy way to use it.

Easy, perfectly balanced Rasam. I loved the flavor toasting the mustard seeds imparted and the heat was deep, making this a perfect winter-warmer. Cheap, too, which is always a plus. Next time, I'm going to cut the ginger by half or puree it - kept running into large, crunchible pieces that overwhelmed the other flavors for a second.

I bought the asafoetida powder but ended up throwing it out after looking it up and finding out it can cause some weird side effects. Not messing with that. Substituted garlic and it came out very nicely. Will definitely try red lentils next time, however, as the too var dal took forever!

Surprisingly delightful. Quite a faithful rendition of the South Indian staple. For those unfamiliar, rasam is not a thick soup; it is a broth soup. The next time I make it, I will cut the ghee down by a spoonful, but otherwise quite lovely.

The soup got rave reviews from my guests; one said it was the best soup he had ever eaten. What's nice is that it requires no meat stock for its depth. I used red lentils as one other cook suggested, after my pigeon peas, which were very old, failed to soften even after an extended time on the stove. Red lentils go fast; I was glad I had them on hand!

Great for a cold, if your stomach isn't bothering you. Cleared my sinuses right up and it was easy enough to make, even though I have the sniffles.

Make sure to boil the broth long enough so that the tamarind loses its raw smell. And yes, the lentils need to be boiled so that they will disintegrate and disappear into the broth when you add them. Asafoeteda is called "hing" in Hindi and can be found at Indian grocery stores or ordered online from Kalustyan's.com.

This soup looks fabulous I'm definately going to put it on my list of soups to try. To the cook wondering where to find asafetida, I have found it at Indian grocery stores.

where could I possibly find asa feotida?

I've made this several times, though I use red lentils, add a lot of fresh chopped garlic and canned diced tomatoes rather than fresh plum tomatoes. I've tried it without the tamarind and finished it with a spritz of fresh lime juice before serving. It's a warming, nutritious and super easy soup for a wintry sunday night supper.

Delicious soup. I used less chillies as well and was very glad I did. I made it several times and it's always great.

Peel the tomatoes! I improvised a bit with the spices so it was probably less authentic, but still very good.

I used fresh home grown tomatoes in this recipe - it was very good. The dal paste did take a lot more water than the recipe indicates.

The first time I made it I used 1 serrano chili and that was SO SPICY that I could not feel anything after... next time I will omitt chilis and make as it is without it. I didn't have mustard seeds and used mustard powder and it was good. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and my soup came out perfectly! To make sure dal will come out as a paste, soak it in water (1 or 2 hrs is enough, but you can leave it to soak for longer). I also boiled dal almost covered at medium heat and that also helped to create a paste. This is a great recipe, except those chillis in it!!! :)

We liked this very much. I had red lentils on hand and used those. I also used ONE habanero in the first step and it was incredibly spicy. Thank goodness for those lassis! I got a paste as described in the recipe by following the directions as given. As a bit of a calorie (and saturated fat) counter, I felt the 'spoonful of warm ghee' got lost and wasn't worth it. The leftovers spooned over rice, however was perfect.

I'm south indian and this recipe closely resembles my mother's recipe - and she makes the best rasam i've ever eaten. A few comments: (1) rasam isn't supposed to be very thick -- my brother and i always fight over who gets the "top" watery rasam (the dal sinks to the bottom) (2) my mom makes this with canned tomatoes with excellent results. good to keep in mind during the winter. (3) it really does taste great with rice and ghee. try it. you can also drink it plain out of a glass. that's good, too.

This is a rather authentic recipe for rasam. In southern India, the true home of all the rasams you could say, it's a dish everyone absolutely loves. A few tips (from my experience of tasting and making rasams over a hundred times, literally): in the first step for bioling the dal in water, if you leave the vessel you're doing the boiling in uncovered, you will *definitely* use more water than called for. So keep the vessel covered (but not completely), and *do* keep the heat at a medium. That said, if the water runs out before the dal is really cooked through (just take some out and taste it, it should be soft, with almost no bite to it), just put in about half a cup more water. And don't do any stirring to make it a paste; you want to get rid of some of the extra water first (it won't get scorched with extra water in it). Just tip the water out, and *then stir, and quickly add to the tomatoes. (you could fry the dal in a couple of tablespoons of vegetable oil-using rapid strokes-after tipping out the water and before adding it to the tomatoes for a fresh taste with a northern Indian accent). And *do be careful not to get any popping mustard seeds in your eye--they get VEry hot! And oh, the dal and the rest of the rasam *don't mix together completely--they seperate out and that's the way we do it in India. Well, happy rasam making!

Make SURE you pop the mustard seeds; they came out very bitter if left whole, and just heated. I found the soup to be 'way too thin; I thickened it with butter and flour, and it was much better, and didn't separate. The first step of cooking the dal with water until it makes a "paste" doesn't happen either! It just cooks to a thin broth. The flavor was enjoyable, however.

Though not as thin as the rassams that I had in New Delhi, this one is pretty close in taste. I only used 1 serrano chili, and it was PLENTY hot! This recipe is definitely a keeper.
