We are chestnut lovers and we absolutely LOVE this soup. I'm a little surprised about the comments on the time it takes. I just put a pot on the stove and it took all of about 15 minutes to assemble. I'll just have to puree it and make the topping but it's certainly not an all-day affair. I use vegetable broth instead of water, and I use fresh chestnuts but shelled the day I buy them so they're ready ahead of time for whatever. The ones in the jar are fine.

So I made the soup, as a trial for Thanksgiving dinner. AND I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE. The result was an interesting dish, but it lacked the depth of flavor that one would hope to have in a soup whose prep is this time consuming. I even added a dash of Kitchen Bouquet, but it didn't help. We have a bumper crop of chestnuts this year from our trees but sadly, this won't be one of the ways in which we will eat them.

This is absolutely the best chestnut soup we've ever had, and I've tried lots of recipes. Most are too heavy, but this is light and flavorful -- a perfect first course for a holiday dinner. And yes, the topping is essential. Both the soup and the topping can be made ahead and frozen with good results.

We made this for Thanksgiving. The soup really had a nice light texture and subtle veggie/chestnut flavor. The saving grace was the crouton/sage/chestnut topping, which we added LIBERALLY to the soup. (The recipe results in lots of extra topping; I ate handfuls of the stuff for several days afterwards. Yum!)

It was a real hit for Thanksgiving. Substituted turkey broth for water and it had plenty of body without being too rich. Next time I'll reduce crouton/chestnut topping by 1/2 (might even leave out the croutons). Agree that using 7.5oz jars makes this very easy (but expensive @ $13 per jar) with a very good chestnut flavor and thick/creamy feel.

This soup was a very nice first course for our Thanksgiving dinner. I used au naturel chestnuts in the jar. They were already peeled. The recipe called for chestnuts in a jar... to those of you previous reviewers who complained about the amount of time it took you to peel/shell the chestnuts, try the chestnuts in the jar next time... you might find that you will like this soup more. I recommend making this soup, BUT follow the directions...!

What a lovely soup this could've been. We tried a test batch for our annual Thanksgiving feast. The soup was not at all difficult to make and made the whole house smell like Thanksgiving! But the taste of the lovely chestnuts was so watered down we couldn't finish the bowls. I think with a little vegetable broth this soup could be fantastic.

This soup was not worth all the prep time, and I will not make it again. Peeling all those chestnuts took forever!! To try and save a little time, I didn't bother with the straining. The flavour was ok, but not outstanding. And the colour was an unappetizing browny-green, yuk!

This is a great fall soup. It was easy to put together and required little attention while cooking. We started with fresh, whole chestnuts that we roasted ourselves and used 2.5c of chicken broth with the water, but otherwise followed the recipe. Our chestnuts were *incredibly* fresh and beautiful! We ignored the croutons, but it does go well with Zingerman's Deli Green Chile-Cheddar Cheese Bread.

I thought this soup was delicious. A note to those who didn't try the recipe but complained about the time: if you have enough time to review a recipe you didn't try - try instead to make the recipe and not review it!

Shame on you! Do not rate recipe, if you didn't try it. Nobody is such a good cook, to be able to taste just by reading. So much chemistry is going in cooking, that only your eyes could not comprehend. If it is to much work, then reheat canned Campbell soup. I have tried this chestnut soup and it is elegant with surprising undertones. My four forks are here for counter-balancing ignorant reviews.

Is there enough flavor in this soup? As I look at the ingredients, I am tempted to use vegetable broth rather than water. But, I don't want to over power a delicate flavor. what do others think?

I totally agree with sethian fron Gwynn Oak; I've never seen such a long recipe for SOUP!! So long, in fact that a glance at the list of ingredients was enough to put me off even reading the recipe! I have a reputation for making great soups and the simple ones are always the best!

It's a shame the previous reviewer of this recipe chose to rate this without giving it a go. I do not have loads of extra time, but gave this my best effort, and had a lovely soup as a result.(total time, start to finish was 1 hr 20 minutes)Surprisingly, it is quite mellow for a chestnut soup. It is not at all difficult nor time consuming, really. We wanted to do a test-run as we are looking for a soup course for our Thanksgiving dinner. This is it. Even our kids enjoyed it (3 and 6 yrs old), although they did not enjoy the leeks and croutons,which were left off for them. Next time I will make it a day ahead, though, as we'll have no space to toast chestnuts with the turkey in the oven!

I agree with the previous comment - looks like something out of Mrs Beeton! Who has time for this sort of cooking?

This looks like a wonderful recipe for a cook who has a couple of adroit but unpaid apprentices to do what seems to be hours of prep. I have no such help, unfortunately.
