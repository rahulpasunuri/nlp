i've used several sushi recipes and have to say that I like this one the best. I find the balance of flavours to be perfect. as for the previous complaints that the rice was "too dry" or "not firm and sticky," I'm guessing that these folks used the volume of water given in this recipe when instead they should be using the volume of water given on the packge of rice they have. Different types of rice will require different volumes of water. For example, my pearl rice requires 1.75 cups of water to a cup of rice, which is a lot more that this recipe suggests. Using the proper ratio of water:rice always results in perfect rice.

I've made this twice now. The first time it was a little to moist, soaking only 15 minutes, rather than 30, really helped with the consistency. I used a rice maker and for 2 rice maker cups I used 1.5X the recipe above. I have a sugar allergy so I used agave syrup instead and it still turned out really well. Also, I use probably a 2 x 3 inch piece of nori and just leave it in there. It gives a nice flavor and no one has ever complained!

I can suggest an easier receipe, you can use regular white rice or japanese rice, I always use regular rice and it's almost the same. Rinse under cold water until water runs clear (1 minute or 2). Transfer the rice to a sauce pan and add the double of fresh water of what you use of rice, for example if you are doing 1 cup of rice add 2 cups of water and so on. Bring to boil and once it's almost dry , cover and lower the flame until it dries completely... to know when it is ready, take a spoon to the botton of the saucepan and if the rice on the botton is dry but not burned it is ready. Transfer to a topperware and add just rice vinegar. Try it! is easy!

Perhaps the person who didn't get the correct consistency for this recipe used standard rice, which you cannot do for this recipe. You need to purchase either rice that states it is sushi rice or purchase it from an Asian market (the rice is a shorter grain medium rice) I agree that using less sugar is the way to go and I didn't quite drizzle it all on the rice as it would be a little too flavored for me, as well. However, it is the perfect consistency and the flavor is just as good as any sushi restaurant I've frequented.

I'VE TRIED THIS THREE TIMES NOW. The rice is not sushi rice. Sushi rice should be firm and sticky. This rice is neither.

I think the flavor of the rice is great but a little "too flavored" when serving with sashimi - I used the same amount of seasonings but with 2 cups of uncooked rice and it was great!

Excellent recipe. This rice was perfect. I have been searching for rice for my sushi rolls for awhile and in the past, the recipes are either too sticky, not sticky enough, to sweet, etc. This was the perfect consistency. The salt balanced out the sugar. Possibly the person below forgot the salt? I did not think it was too sweet at all. :o)

I would take it easy on the sugar, I had to make the rice over. I make sushi all the time and one Tbls of sugar made it taste like candy.

I cooked the rice in my rice cooker. Finished the recipe as directed and made California Rolls with it. It was a hit to take to a party. Quick and easy!

Skipping the kelp, this recipe was perfect, even though we were in a hurry and it didn't chill for very long. We used Calrose. It made enough for 8-10 sheets of nori. Sticky and yummy!
