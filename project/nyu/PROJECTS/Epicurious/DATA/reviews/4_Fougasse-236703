I have to second the first review - fantastic! I only have one rack in my oven so I cooked them one at a time in the center. I thought I had overcooked the first one at 35 minutes and so took the second one out at 30 minutes - both were deep brown on the bottom but ended up great. The outside was hard but I think the sweep of olive oil helps makes the crunch tasty and a nice match for the flavorful dough inside. Brought both to a dinner party that night and got many compliments.

Wow!! This was one of the most amazing breads that I have ever made in terms of the complexity of the flavors. The warm flavors balanced perfectly with the the floral flavors of the orange blossom water. The picture of the finished product made it seem more daunting to make, but it was not actually that difficult. It is time consuming in terms of the time it takes to rise and shape the dough, but it is well worth the effort!
