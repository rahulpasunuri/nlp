Sub in chicken or veggie broth instead of the water and it will solve all of the "bland" issues.

My favorite pasta recipe ever! You cannot separate the parts because the cooked sauce really needs the balance of the cheese, olives and garlic chips. My husband and I fight over the leftovers. And I would advise other garlic lovers to double the garlic. That's right I said double.

Surprisingly good. I followed the recipe, but increased everything so it wouldn't be bland. I also added some red pepper flakes to the onion saute. Next time, I will use a different pasta. The sauce is a chunky collection of things, and it doesn't stick to the thin pasta. I wound up with a large ball of pasta surrounded by delicious sauce. I think a different shape of pasta would be easier to combine for bites that include pasta with sauce. Very unusual flavor profile. The garlic chips were wonderful. I used a whole head of garlic, but I nibbled so many garlic chips that I had to make more. The currants were perfect -- just a hint of sweetness.

Very good despite the odd combination. I'll make it often. Followed the recipe exactly.

Very interesting flavors going on here. I have made this a number of times...to date my favorite way is to finish off the pasta according to the recipe....then fold in 2 eggs and pack into a 10'' "sprayed" glass pie plate. Top with parmesan cheese and bake 25 minutes on 350 degrees. Let it cool before serving. Super the next day at room temp for a nice lunch or picnic. Rave reviews asking for the recipe! Do not forget the currents....altho raisins work just as well.

Great recipe! Very interesting flavors. I've made it twice; the first time we also thought it was a little bland; the second time I doubled everything but the pasta, which made a big difference in the amount of flavor per bite. Substituted spinach for the kale (a 5oz package) and used parmesean instead of feta. Adding the pasta water is essential, don't skip it!

I loved this recipe. I used raisins instead of currants, and a bit more than the recipe calls for. I also used a good amount of parmesan cheese instead of feta. I think the sweet (raisins) and salty (cheese) combination is essential to making this recipe a success, and so I recommend a little more of each.

This recipe sounded really good, but it was really disappointing. Very bland and uninspired. You can barely taste the currants, and the garlic pieces were quite bitter. I followed the recipe exactly and used very high quality ingredients, so I think the problem must be with the recipe.
