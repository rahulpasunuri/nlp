I try new recipes every year. This one however, is the must have of Thanksgivng dinner (this and the craberry-pecan conserve; BA Nov, 1988). I even brought cans of Boston Brown Bread to Germany during the year we lived there to make sure I could make it. I think I follow the recipe exactly - I might add some extra broth if I think it looks a little dry but that's about it.

Well, I made this recipe and it's good, but not great. I have a few tips for you that I learned about it........ 1) Be sure that the Italian bread is nice and toasted before adding it. It gets very soggy if not dry enough.(The brown bread held its firmness very nicely.) 2) Add more bacon!....at least double the amount the recipe calls for. 4 oz.simply is not enough. 3) This might sound strange, but for my family, we needed more sweetness. Add brown sugar to this recipe. I added it after tasting it while it was baking and after I added it, it was MUCH better! I added about 1/4 cup and more would have worked well also. We live in the West, and maybe the brown bread was a bit too different for us. I would make it again, but it isn't a favorite. If you want to try something very different, give this one a try, but I would experiment with it before taking it to a party or a Thanksgiving dinner. That way you'll know what to do to avoid mistakes and what to add or subtract to make it a winner for you. Good Luck!

I'm a big fan of the brown-bread in this recipe - gives our thanksgiving dinner a traditional new england feel. I've made the brown bread from scratch and used canned, with little difference - and the can is much easier. Fresh, thick cut bacon is the key to this dish - giving it just a touch of meaty flavor to balance the herbed breads. Its easy to make and guests are always pleasantly surprised by the brown bread - a nice twist.

This is a good stuffing and a nice change from the usual. I agree with other reviewers that it was a bit dry (especially the brown bread). I didn't like the dry texture so much, but my wife loved it - I think it's a matter of taste. As a native New Englander, any way to incorporate brown bread into a meal is a good recipe for me.

This recipe seemed interesting when I read it, but it was awful. There wasn't enough broth, so the resulting stuffing was very dry and none of the flavors melded. Don't waste your time with this one.

It has become our traditional Thanksgiving stuffing. We love canned brown bread. We followed the recipe.

I followed the recipe to the letter with high hopes for lots of flavor. It didn't happen.

There as no oven temperature given for the actual baking - I used 350 degs and it seemed correct. It too used pumpernickel in lieu of canned brown bread and it was fine.

Great diversion from traditional stuffings. I used dried chives recontituted, brown bread may also be found in the baked bean section. This stuffing goes well with roasted chicken too.

I normally do not make substitutions when trying a recipe for the first time but...I could not find canned Brown Bread at the local markets so I substituted pumpernickel. The flavors of the bacon and tarragon were wonderful. A great recipe for those who prefer less traditional stuffing.
