I used pistachio nuts instead of pecans. They turned out fine, not exceptional though. Easy recipe. I ground all the nuts.

I would make these truffles again but next time I will double the recipe. I only got about 7 average-sized truffles this time. The recipe also calls for coursely chopped pecans. Next time I will put course pecans inside but roll them in more finely chopped pecans.

Super easy, the truffles look professional and taste great!!
