The recipe was great, but as others note, it needs an addition. My choice: green curry paste worked wonders.

It needed sweet/sour flavor added- I used a whole can of lite coconut milk, and added tamarind syrup.Or you can use a spoon of sugar and a little tamarind concentrate. Maybe lemon juice and sugar would work too... Also, skip the pasta and just make jasmine or basmati rice. With those changes and some extra ginger, it was very good.

Agree with everyone else - if you make it as specified, it's got hardly any taste. I used a big whole jalapeno, 2 times the garlic. Also used the lemon juice. It's spicy, but lacking real flavor in the eggplant and mushroom.

good concept, lacks flavor. Need to add fresh lime juice, little sugar, 1 fresh red chili.

Terrific recipe. Served this as a vegetarian entree at a large dinner party/buffet. Guests absolutely loved it. Simple & quick. Use fresh shitake mushrooms if possible, along with Japanese eggplants & Thai basil. Japanese eggplants have a better consistency for this dish.

I love this recipe, with a few alterations: to make it a bit spicier, I use 1 entire jalapeno pepper and throw in 1 tbsp. (or more) red pepper flakes.

We were unimpressed by this recipe. It was spicy but without much flavor.

This recipe was tasty once I added some lime juice and a little more pepper. Otherwise it lacked a little something.
