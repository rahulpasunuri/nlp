This recipe was great and easy to make. If you are expecting typical american-ized tex-mex mexican, this recipe is not for you. It's actually quite typical of the region.

I call this crazy potatoes. I lliked it very much. I used the Mexican Crema which is kind of a cross between half&half and sour cream. Next time I will double the jalapenos. After a bike ride I was starving. I heated the leftovers and served an egg over easy on top and smashed it all together. Delicious.
