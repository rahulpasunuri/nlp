This recipe turned out great!! I had to make a small alteration due to running out of whole wheat flour, I substituted 1/2 cup of white flour. I also made this in my kitchen aid mixer and it still turned out great. I was amazed at how well the wheat flour rose, as I normally have a very hard time with wheat flour. Yumm!

Thanks to Chow, here are some sources for flours that will work more easily with this recipe: -King Arthur Irish Style Wholemeal Flour. Can be ordered from the KA website or check for availability in your area. -Use whole wheat PASTRY flour instead of all-purpose/bread ww flour. It's softer and again more equivalent to Irish wholemeal flour. Whole Foods carries it in bulk and Bob's Red Mill sells it in packages, I think. Check with natural foods stores in your area if you're having trouble finding a source for it. -Instead of using dry yeast, use bakers or a compressed yeast cake. The live yeast similar to that used in Ireland may lessen the bread's density. (See the comment from the baker at the the Ballymaloe School.) -Preheat your oven to 150 degrees. Cover the rising dough with a damp, clean dish towel and place in the oven turning off the temperature and closing the oven door. Leave until it has doubled in bulk. Remove, turn temperature back to 150 degrees, follow directions, place back in oven covered with damp clean towel, turn temperature off, close oven door, follow directions in recipe. Basically, what I'm trying to do is use ingredients closer in type to the Irish and adapt the techniques described by the Ballymaloe chef in his comment. At least, it's what I tried. The dough is still rising! It was wetter than others described and not so heavy. Here's hoping it works. LOL

I have been making this bread for every week for 15 years after seeing Darina Allen make it. It has never failed me. I did make the exception of adding a total of 1 Tbl. of Molasses rather than the 1 tsp. called for. Buy excellent stone- ground whole wheat flour. It is not your basic yeast bread dough. To the reviewer from Boston that purports to be an intermediate baker, all the science in the world won't replace the touch one gets with experience. Trust yourself more. This bread makes fantastic toast.

I made this bread with white flour and demerara sugar (all I had in the house), and I did let it rise about twice the time specified here, but it turned out wonderfully: dense but not heavy, with a really tender crumb and deliciously yeasty. Mmmm.

I am in the middle of making this right now. I stopped to come write the review. I followed the recipe exactly, twice (because I thought I did something wrong the first time) and I don't get "batter" at all. I get a very loose dry dough that would only come together after lots of kneeding. We'll see what happens after it's baked but Any suggestions as to what I am doing wrong would be great.

I'm going to try this. I will use King Arthur wheat flour. It's wonderful hard wheat or strong flour and I think you will find that it's the closest thing you will get to the Irish flour.

My wife and I attended the Ballymaloe Cookery School and have made this bread many times. However, there is really no point in making it if you don't have access to the wonderful wholemeal flour that is available in every supermarket in Ireland. Our wholewheat flour just isn't the same.

Hi, i'm a chef at Ballymaloe and have made the bread many times. A few comments. The bread is very crusty.A characteristic of the bread I'm afraid. In the kitchen we use fresh yeast as a matter of course and this may in some way influence results. We rise the bread in a nice warm spot on our bread oven (a big old old thing) and it only takes 20 minutes. The bread isn't kneaded because the dough is too wet and it would only develop the gluten thus changing the texture of the bread.

I did ALOT of doctoring, and it came out OK...I added 1/2c of white flour (to lighten it up a bit), and 1/4t of sugar (to feed the yeast and promote rising). I also let it rise (for however long it took, which I believe was overnight). It is very dense wheat bread, tasty too.

I followed just abotu every note from the test kitchen, with little luck. Although the reviews were mixed, the 100% make it again rate convinced me to try it. My mistake. I use just one packet of yeast, and did allow it to rise almost three times as long as the recipe instructed. It still turned out VERY heavy and dense, with a very thick, hard crust. The flavor is good, but the texture is terrible. There have to be better recipes out there!

I made this as per the recipe, but followed the tester's advice to not preheat the loaf pan. It seemed to rise fine (I expected it not to be as high as bread made with all-purpose flour). However, when I make this again, I will skip the "turn out onto baking sheet & bake bottom-up for 10 more minutes part" since it came out much too crusty for my liking. I did like the density of the loaf, though.

I read the recipe and the reviews and I have a few comments. I would call myself an intermediate baker, not an expert. First, this seems like a lot of yeast for the amount of flour. Usually a recipe like this calls for about two teaspoons. Is this why the baker thinks the dough doesn't require kneading? How is the gluten in the whole wheat flour supposed to develop without kneading? Bread can't retain its rise without gluten (unless you add xanthan gum or something.) The test kitchen notes say that the yeast-proofing water should be wrist temperature and the bread pans should not be heated. How about a little kitchen science to explain how this recipe could possibly work?

I read the prior reviews and I added an extra 1/2 cup water and a little (1/2 tablespoon) of yeast. Rising time was OK and the loaf came out very crusty but still too dense. i am still experimenting and think that a little more molasses and yeat may leaven it better but it tastes good even if the loaf is dense

This bread takes alot of encouragement and basically 4 times longer than it says in the recipe to rise.

This didn't turn out too well when I tried it (though I haven't ever baked bread, or much of anything, before). It ended up being far too dense; could someone give me some suggestions as to what might have gone wrong? I used just one packet of yeast as per the tester's notes, though it wasn't at room temperature, and I think the water wasn't warm enough. The yeast didn't seem to foam very much and the bread had trouble rising, taking much much longer than the recipe suggested. Once again, any suggestions would be appreciated.
