Simple and delicious! I made it with lemon and strawberry sorbet. It was a hit with my guests. I'll be making it again soon.

This was a hit with us and our guests. Two of us put it together in just a few minutes. I added whipped cream but definitely not necessary. Also used peach sorbet. I will experiment with different flavors next time. This is a keeper!

Tasty,Easy and Healthy. Wonderful. I used good peach & rasberry frozen yogurts. Very colorful fruit combination! Some of my friends added whipped cream although I felt it was good without. The coconut rum was a nice touch. I actually made this because I had a bottle of such rum and was finding a way of using it. Great!
