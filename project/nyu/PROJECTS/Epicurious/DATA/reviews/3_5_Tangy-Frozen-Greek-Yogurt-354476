I may reduce the sugar and corn syrup next time, but unlike what others are suggesting, I definitely wouldn't cut it from the recipe - corn syrup's an invert sugar, and that helps with keeping the yogurt creamy.

I followed the recipe closely enough to rate it, but I did make the following changes and it was probably the best thing to ever come out of my ice cream maker. Used 3/4c honey and 1/4c sugar. This made it less sweet than the recipe called for, due to other reviewers' comments. Soaked 2tbsp dried lavender in the warm sugar/h2o/honey for about 30 min, then strained. I also used 2% greek yogurt. These changes made it come down to about 200cal per 1/2c serving. I would probably reduce the sugar mixture even more next time (not to reduce cals, but because it was still a bit sweeter than necessary) I plan to try this again with jasmine flowers

This frozen yogurt tastes exactly like sweetened yogurt. No more, no less. I'm surprised the other reviews are so positive!

This frozen yogurt was probably the best I've ever had. So incredibly fresh tasting,and I like the creamy, tangy simplicity of the flavors. I agree with previous reviewers that you can cut back on the sugar and corn syrup some. Maybe by 1/4 to 1/3 less would be perfect. Any fresh fruit you have on hand would be great with this. I used diced mango! Yummy!

I omitted the corn syrup, cut the sugar in half, and doubled the lemon juice. It was *fantastic*!

Like others, I halved the amount of corn syrup and this was still plenty sweet. I also added about a cup of basil leaves to the sugar mixture during the heating and cooling process, straining them out before whisking in the yogurt, etc., and was very pleased with the results.

This was a revelation. Absolutely glorious. If you're not a big sweet person, you might want to go a bit light on the sugar, as it was quite sweet (but also very tangy). We used a light Greek yogurt, which was very rich and creamy, as well as a light buttermilk.

Wow. I made a lot of ice cream, but this was my first try with frozen yogurt. Made it with half the corn syrup and may try omitting that altogether next time. So easy and absolutely delicious.

This recipe wins the prize for best ice cream of the summer. Easy to make with exceptional results. Very creamy, fabulously tangy, and perfect paired with a fruit or berry dessert. I followed the recipe as written and served it with an easy peach and raspberry crisp - heaven!
