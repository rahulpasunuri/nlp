This recipe is amazing, with one little fault . . . 8 tablespoons of olive oil?????? I used 4 and it was still a little much, I recommend only three, I used fresh dill, marjoram and basil, with green leaf lettuce and baby greens. Of course a salad is going to wilt with 8 tablespoons of olive oil, this recipe needs to be updated for the 21st century.

Didn't like it at all. The dressing was bland and the dish wilted before I served it. It was a flop

Fabulous salad. I served this to my extended family members, who are not are not exactly salad enthusiasts. They finished two large bowls in no time. The herbs liven it up quite a bit. Be careful, though - it wilts immediately.
