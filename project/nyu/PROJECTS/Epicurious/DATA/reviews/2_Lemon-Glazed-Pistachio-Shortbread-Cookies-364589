The recipe really intrigued me, and the cookies are pretty good. They are not too sweet, and the flavors are complimentary. It is very important to not roll the dough too thin (they burn easily), and don't expect them to hold a shape if using a unique cookie cutter. Go with round if possible. I think they are worth trying again.
