I wasn't fond of these. I admittedly used cantalope instead of honeydew, but I doubt that following the recipe perfectly would have changed my opinion. The recipe was less than the sum of it's parts. My husband liked it, though. I'll look for other flavor combos for my popsicles.

tastes likes frozen drink mix without the alcohol. easy to make but like other popsicle flavors better.
