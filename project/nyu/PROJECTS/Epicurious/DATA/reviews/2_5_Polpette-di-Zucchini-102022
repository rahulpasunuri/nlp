This was okay but not worth the trouble. The meatballs didn't hold together and the zucchini came out too mushy. You'd be better off making meatballs the regular way and adding cubed zucchini to the sauce at the end of cooking.

A little time consuming, but delicious. Great for a Sunday dinner. Good comfort food. Remember to make the zucchini pieces very small, or the meat doesn't like to hold firm around them.
