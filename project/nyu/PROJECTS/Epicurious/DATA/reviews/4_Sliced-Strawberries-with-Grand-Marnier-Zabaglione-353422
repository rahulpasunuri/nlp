Dead simple and incredibly delicious. A great recipe for when you need something quickly for guests.

Very tasty, made it with blueberries and raspberries in a fun margarita glass. But maybe it was a little watery/runny? I also think that this recipe should serve 4 easily...made it for two and had so much left over. Next time I'll try reducing the eggs and water by half.

This was my first attempt at zabaglione. I'm not sure I made it exactly right, but it was awesome anyway! I think I had the water too hot. By itself, there is definitely a strong Grand Marnier flavor, but over the strawberries it's perfect.

This was not as interesting as more traditional zabaglione. I prefer the richer taste of marsala to round out the flavor of tart fruits, like berries. Also it was a little runny. On the other hand, it was easy to make and a good recipe for last minute company.

Delicious and easy to make. The custard complimented the fresh strawberries and the grand marnier was a nice touch. My husband LOVES it.

I'm not a fan of any type of custard. The thought of eating uncooked eggs grosses me out. However, I really enjoyed this dish. It was very easy to make and very light. A great way to end a somewhat heavy dinner. I think the Grand Marnier was a little strong but nothing I would complain about.

Easy and Delicious! I will make this often as the ingredients are always on hand! Perfect, perfect, perfect.

This was a nice change from heavy desserts. Easy to prepare. Good with other berries. But flavorful berries is a must. My strawberries were not as sweet as they should be for this time of the year. The raspberries were excellent. Everyone went for those.

Delicious and so so easy. It's an elegant simple dessert - and very light. I didn't have creme fraiche or sour cream on hand, so I stirred in a couple tbs of heavy cream. The flavor was delicious and it worked fine, but it was a little too thin and too sweet so the creme fraiche would probably fix that. Otherwise, I would cut back a little on the liquids (Grand Marnier and water) so help the custard form thicker.

Delicious and elegant, yet so simple - how can you go wrong? I will also try it with other fresh summer berries, as someone else suggested. It will be a favorite in our house!

Just made this - stellar dessert that is relatively easy and stunning for guests. I made a few subs that worked out fine... I tripled the recipe - worked great. I didn't have grand marnier on hand (used it all up last time I made the grand marnier cranberries recipe on this site - try that sometime during the holidays), so I used TRIPLE SEC instead, and it was fine (although you can probably back down 1 tablespoon off of it and be ok. I had loads of great, fresh strawberries and used them up, but a blend of berries would likely be even better (fresh is what makes it). I am allergic to dairy, so I used fleischmans unsalted margarine (which I do for most cooking) and soy supreme instead of sour cream... no one ever would know unless I told them. ABSOLUTELY WILL MAKE AGAIN. Enjoy!

This is fabulous! Nice change from the traditional Marsala based zabaglione. We serve it warm in the winter over poached spiced pears, but in the summer over strawberries I prefer the custard chilled. It doesn't typically hold up well if made too far in advance, so to chill it I would put it in a small bowl and set it over an ice and water bath. Stir a few times to cool and then serve.

I'm not sure if I made the custard quite right, but it was delicious anyway. I would definitely make this again.

This was a superb dessert and quick to prepare after dinner last night. You can't go wrong with fresh strawberries on their own, but dressing them in the Grand Marnier-laced Zabaglione elevated them to a company- worthy dessert. Will definitely make again,
