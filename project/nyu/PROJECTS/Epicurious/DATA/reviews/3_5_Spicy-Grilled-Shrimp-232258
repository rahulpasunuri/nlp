Different and easy. I used grill pan and left peels on as it is supposed to keep shrimp more moist. They were moist, but very messy to peel.

I love to see a recipe where people prepared it as written and loved it! I used Tabasco and cut back on it a little because I was worried it would be too spicy but it wasn't at all, and I will definitely use the whole amount next time. We served it with a rice pilaf seasoned with lemon and it was delicious!

This is a crowd pleasing favorite. I use a grill basket for bigger parties to make it easier on the cook.

We vacation in Destin, FL several times a year, and this has been our 'go to' recipe for as long as I remember. The freshly caught gulf shrimp are key to this one! We use balsamic vinegar, doubling the amount, add additional hot sauce, and boil the marinade while the shrimp is grilling. Would love to serve it as an entree, but everyone is snacking on it as it leaves the grill. Fresh basil is key, but I'm thinking of trying the cilantro recommendation next time. Wonderful recipe!!!

Very easy marinade with a nice flavor. The basil is a must. I would add hot sauce or a jalapeno next time. Everyone enjoyed it!

This is so easy, and so delicious. My husband and I made it for his parents when they visited one summer, and they were really impressed and wanted the recipe. To me, fresh basil is the key ingredient. I write a blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins, and this is one of the recipes I featured on it.

This is delicious and so easy! I used rice vinegar because that's what we had and minced the garlic. Only changes for next time I would use 1/3 cup of olive oil and 1/4 tsp salt. This is the perfect summertime go-to recipe.

I am about to make this for the 100th time. We have served this at weddings, casual dinners and fancy feasts. ALWAYS a hit. Tonight I am serving it over mixed greens with the lemon vinagrette from a crabcake recipe on this site. Doesn't get any better, or any easier than this.

Fantastic. I didn't have worchestershire sauce, so used Tamari Soy Sauce. Didn't have "red pepper sauce, so used Sriracha, then added another tablespoon, and about teaspoon of Chipotle Tabasco. WE like it spicy and it was fabulous. Cut up some zucchini, marinated & grilled those as well. Yum!

Tasty, easy and fast to prepare. My parents and husband loved it. I made one important substitution... cilantro instead of basil.

It takes a lot to get 4 forks - and this one was closer to 3 1/2. Nice change of pace. I was a little bit shy on the amount of basil required so the sauce wasn't as 'pretty' as it could have been, but the flavor was ALL there. I also did not have white wine vinegar and had to use plain white - it was still really good. Be careful to not over cook them on the grill! We paired it with a pineapple-chili margarita (also from this site).

Rating: 4
wonderful, my family (my kids too) loved it! however, I read the other reviews and took advice from others. this is what I did.... I used only 5 Tablespoons of olive oil and used 3 tablespoons of water (it did thin it a little but it cut the amount of fat, I then added 1 Tablespoon of non fat mayo. to thickened it up). Instead of the white wine vinegar, I added 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. I then add all ingredients to a blender. It blended together to create a wonderful marinade (the color was beautiful). I used all the marinaded for the shrimp (I made another full recipe to drizzle on top) and let it marinate for 1 hour. We grilled them and served them on top of brown rice. For the rice: I chopped some white onion and baby carrots, browned them in some olive oil and then added my brown rice and 4 Cups of broth and cooked it for about 45 minutes. *I then made another recipe of the marinade so I had enough to drizzle on top of the shimp and rice. It was a wonderful meal.

Great flavor and easy to make. I like this in the summer when I have lots of fresh basil in the garden. Make sure you pour some of the reserved marinade over it when you serve.

I served this as an appetizer (served about 4), and everyone loved it. I reduced the oil to 5 Tbsp, and blended the mixture in a mini-food processor for a good texture. I also reserved a bit more of the marinade to use as a dip. 3 stars only because I found it a bit too vinegary, but the flavours really were great. I'll try it with grilled bacon- wrapped scallops too!

Delicious! Reduced oil to 1/3 cup and increased hot sauce as we like s-p-i-c-y. Easy, fast and crowd pleasing. Great with a side of linguine tossed with fresh basil pesto and a tossed salad.

This was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, added the juice of 1/2 a lemon and about 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes as suggested by other reviewers. I think the trick is to let it marinate for a good long time - I did so for about 4 hours and it was super flavorful. We are even going to try this marinade with other proteins, like chicken breast or calamari steaks. I think it might even be great with steak. This will be a summer staple in our house.

If I could give it 3.5 forks I would. Excellent taste and simple. I went a little heavier on the hot sauce as some suggested and cooked mine in a bbq pan (the kind with holes). Will be a summer time staple around here.

I added 2tsp of dijon and 1tsp of crushd red pepper flakes. Instead of small shrimp I used jumbo and wrapped in bacon. Was spectacular.

Made this with two substitutions: rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, and fresh rosemary instead of the basil, and didn't love it. It had such a sharp, acidic taste that I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar. Even with the sugar, a decent flavor,but not as good as the even easier Rosemary Garlic shrimp on this site.

Absolutely fantastic! My family just loved it. It was the first time I prepared shrimp and it came out perfect. I never thought it really would be as easy as it is. I added a bit more garlic and served it with lime. It is already on the family's 'Favourite dishes' list" :-)

Had this in the little town of Ballston Lake, NY for a dinner party of close friends. Everyone thought it was outstanding. Had a couple of changes. After peeling the shrimp, tossed the shrimp in a bowl with 2 TBls each of sugar and sea salt. Refrigerate 45 mins, then rinse in water thoroughly and marinate with the following changes. Added 1 Tbl crushed red pepper. Doubled the vinegar and tripled the hot sauce. Used Goya Salsita. Oil the grill prior to placing skewers of shrimp. If it is cold outside or windy add a few minutes each side. Enjoy!

I didn't have basil, but I had cilantro. I used that and substituted the vinegar for lime juice. It was great! I tossed leftover shrimp with avocado chunks and drizzled more lime juice and olive oil over the top, then topped with fresh cilantro leaves and WOW, what a salad. Look forward to the basil version too.

We Love it! Just like the cook below me, my family wishes I would make this shrimp once a week. My husband who, up until this time, claimed that he hated shrimp was begging the children to give their skewers to him. He loved it that much! I've made this over 10 times already with no changes in the original recipe. My husband claims its one of his all time favorite dishes. And its super fast. I can make it on a week night after work. I always serve this with a side of homemade fettuccine alfredo.

Absolutely fabulous! My family has been clamoring for it every weekend since I first made it a couple months ago. The first time I forgot the basil and was surprised how much flavor it added when I made it correctly the second time around. I agree that slightly more hot sauce could be a good thing.

This was very good although I will add a bit more spice the next time--I like the idea of boiling some of the marinade to use on the shrimp after it has been grilled.

Used less oil/more hot pepper sauce and still too oily and bland. Bad use of my fresh basil from garden. Perhaps saute shrimp stove top would absorb more flavor but too many great shrimp recipes to try and fix this one. A real disappointment as ingredient list boasts plenty of flavor.

These shrimp were a big hit at the BBQ over the weekend - even for us Neanderthals in Texas. I chose the recipe for its simplicity as I wanted to partake in the Pineapple Martinis in this edition (also highly recommended). I brought the bottle of hot sauce to the table to let people accommodate their own palette. Also keep in mind that hot sauce loses its power over time or if not kept in the fridge.

Great discussion, but I made the recipe last night and thought that it definitely needed more zip so I added some cayenne pepper and some red pepper flakes. I also thought there was too much oil so I balanced it out with a little extra Worcestershire sauce. But I would make it again with those additions.

A vegetarian does not eat meat of any kind, which of course includes fish and shellfish. Some people eat a mainly vegetarian diet but do include fish. There's nothing wrong with this, just as there's nothing wrong with eating meat (in my book, anyway) but you can't call yourself a vegetarian if you eat the bodies of creatures which were once alive. Simple as that.

My brother from Texas was visiting, and as a bovo-swino vegetarian I felt some changes were necessary in order for him to eat this. I therefore substituted beef for shrimp, lard for olive oil, and ,maple syrup for hot sauce (he doesn't like spicy food). I served it with a tossed pig entrail salad with balsamic vinaigrette, and I'll be danged if that ol' boy ate every dang morsel!

Tasty, quick and easy, but there are much better grilled shrimp recipes on this site. Like others, I prefer the Grilled New Orleans-style Shrimp and the Grilled Sweet-and-Spicy Shrimp is also very good. Re this vegetarian debate: My son is a strict vegan: he will not eat the meat/flesh or any by-product of any creature that has eyes - so, no meat, fish, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, chicken/beef broth etc. His wife is vegetarian: she does not eat meat/poultry, but does eat fish/seafood, eggs, dairy products etc. So, yes, for someone who is vegetarian but not vegan, shrimp would qualify as a suitable vegetarian dish.

People who eat any type of animal products are not vegetarians. They've invented all these term like Pesca-vegetarian, ovo/lacto vegetarians, etc. to make themselves sound as if they are doing something healthy/politically correct - whatever! It's just semantics. These people are actually just omnivores who prefer not to eat red meat. So, to review - there are vegetarians (also called vegans) and everybody else. Everything else is just splitting hairs.

I followed the recipe and found it satisfactory, though I do prefer the New Orleans-style shrimp (on this site). On a more frivolous note: for the record . . . bugs are made of keratin (if they have a 'shell') AND - protein!! Grubs/caterpillars, larvae, etc are also protein. Meat is protein: you do the math (my brother is an entomologist by profession, I checked with him just to be sure.)

I made this dish exactly as written. It was very easy, fast, and delicious. Certainly a keeper, although next time I will add more hot sauce, as it's not very spicy (and I'm fairly weak when it comes to spicy foods). I'm also interested in trying the balsamic substitution. PS people can eat whatever they want. and call it whatever they want. relax.

To UT or anyone else grill-less: I highly recommend the George Foreman indoor grill. It's a minor miracle, and the new ones have removable washable plates. The New Orleans Grilled Shrimp recipe on this site is also Foreman friendly.

Let is be known that shrimp is not a vegetable. Shrimp an animal of the crustaccean family known as a decapod. The part you eat is the skeletal muscle like that of fish and our land livestock.

If you reduce the marinade while the shrimp are grilling, both will finish at the same time and you will get a thicker sauce without any fear of contamination.

To the cook from B.C.: the recipe has you reseve a portion of the marinade BEFORE marinating the shrimp-- this reserved "sauce" is what's used on the finished dish. You're absolutely right, though, that anything used for marinating food needs to be thoroughly cooked before using as a sauce.

To the Cook from Minneapolis, MN - shrimp is a vegetarian dish. Its not meat. Anyway, I used italian flat parsely instead of basil and added a sprinkle of bread crumbs so it sticks to the shrimp. It was very good just dont over cook. You just need 3 or 4 min. on each side of a hot grill.

Iwould like to suggest that the marinade be boiled a few minutes before serving with the cooked shrimp. Serving a marinade, that has been used with any raw meat, as a sauce, without boiling 2-3 minutes can be very dangerous.

There are four basic types of vegetarianism, ranging in strictness of diet. Vegans do not eat meat or animal products, including eggs and milk. Lacto-ovo vegetarians do not eat meat, but do eat animal products. Pesco vegetarians eat seafood, but no other type of meat, and semi-vegetarians eat seafood and poultry. These options offer much variety and opportunities for the aspiring vegetarian. So, this dish is a vegetarian meal for those who choose to avoid meat and/or poultry as a part of their chosen regimen. A little more spice would be good - but that is an easy personal adjustment to make.

To Draper, UT: You can broil the shrimp in the oven. Make sure to preheat your broiler at least 10 minutes, it makes a difference. Put the shrimp on a broiler pan so the juices can drip off instead of puddle around the shrimp. Put the rack on the second level from the top. It will only take a couple minutes each side. Take the shrimp out of the fridge about 20 minutes prior to broiling them so they cook evenly through.
