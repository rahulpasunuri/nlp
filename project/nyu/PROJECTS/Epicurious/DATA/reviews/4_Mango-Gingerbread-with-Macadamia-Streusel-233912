I read the reviews and decided to adapt the recipe to what I had on hand, and to simplify a bit. 1) I skipped the streusel (sounds good, but didn't have either the crystalized ginger or macadamia nuts) 2) I replaced the brown sugar with 3/4 c. molasses - this gives more flavor, less processed sugar 3) I didn't have mango, so substituted 2c. applesauce 4) As this is post-holidays, used some leftover eggnog to replace the buttermilk. 5) Resulting batter was a bit thin, so I added another 1/2 c. flour Cake came out very tender, moist and delicious. Love the molasses flavor! Would be good with whipped cream, but is also just fine on its own. Packs well for lunches.

I'm the minority voice here, but I was not impressed. I'm a good cook, I love all the ingredients and had them on hand, I made exactly according to the recipe, and it came out perfectly to the eye. That said, it was bland. It had the ginger heat (which I love), but none of the depth or flavor I was looking for. Yes, it was dense and moist, but it did not taste like gingerbread. Perhaps the cook who added molasses was on to something. IF I make this again (and I probably will not) I would definitely add molasses and perhaps some cinnamon and nutmeg. With all the rave reviews I certainly expected more.

Delicious. I used Trader Joe's frozen mangoes. Excellent for breakfast.

I made this because of the stellar reviews. It was very good and distinctive. This makes a great breakfast or brunch cake. I like the fact that there the recipe calls for only 1/4 cup of oil. You don't really taste the mango - it just adds substance to the cake and smooths out the flavors. The macadamia nuts with their slight bit of salt are a must.

What a nice, delicate cake. The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup of whole-wheat flour and 1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour. Pureed the flesh of two mangoes. Baked in a 9-inch springform pan. No problems -- very easy and quick recipe with wonderful flavors.

The ingredients in this recipe intrigued me and since I just so happened to have brought home a container of peeled fresh mango from Trader Joes...Fabulous cake. Made as written, increasing crystalized ginger by 1 tbs and using slightly more mango. Those who complained of dryness must have overbaked it as 40 minutes in my oven which is perfectly calibrated produced a moist, delicious cake. Sweetened whipped cream will put this over the top. The idea of lemon zest and coconut is interesting and I will probably try that next time around. I am not easy to please, but this simple to make, sophisticated cake deserves a 4 forks rating. Can't wait to make this for company!

This recipe is to die for. I would not change a thing. The macadamia nuts are perfect here and should not be omitted or switched for other nuts.

I am allergic to nuts so didn't do the streusel. I have made this as a cake and as loaves - both with just a simple glaze and gotten rave reviews each time. It is a lovely, moist, flavorful recipe. (I added just a touch of molassess to the recipe the first time I made it - fine but unnecessary.)

I doubled the recipe and used a glass pan. It never baked thoroughly although I left it in more than an hour. The taste, however, is fantastic, so I will make it again using a metal pan.

Every time I make this my family eats it all within a couple of hours...it has yet to make it to the next day. I always use more crystallized ginger in the streusel. The mango helps it stay moist, which is perfect with the crunchy topping.

Really really excellent. Subtle gingerbread flavor, and the crystallized ginger makes the recipe. I halved the recipe and cooked it in a loaf pan for 40min and it was perfect!

Dense and moist with a strong ginger flavor. It was easy to make and my family enjoyed it.

I didn't change any of the ingredients and it turned out excellent. I've also made this recipe using a muffin pan -- cuts down on the baking time and quite lovely served in a basket on my brunch table.

I liked it! It is great just the way it is written, and even better with a bit more crystalized ginger. Serve with sweetened, fresh whipped cream...Yum!!!!

I thought this was rather lackluster. The crystallized ginger was the strongest element of the bread. Neither the mangos, nor the ground ginger notes came through as strongly as would have been desirable. The bread was also a bit dry and probably could have been baked for a shorter period of time. Next time i will add more mango to the batter and possibly some grated fresh ginger and lemon zest to give it more depth of flavor. Coconut might be a nice addition too.

i thought this was just ok. the layers with crystallized ginger were really tasty, but the rest of the cake was kind of bland.

I NEVER BAKE, BUT THIS CAME OUT GREAT. THE ONLY THING I DID DIFFERENT WAS ADD MORE GINGER.
