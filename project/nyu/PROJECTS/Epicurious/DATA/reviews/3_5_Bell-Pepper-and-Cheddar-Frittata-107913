Delicious! This could easily be bland if not well seasoned and without fresh oregano and really sharp cheese. I served the leftovers at room temp with a salad. I'll definitely make it again.

yum! didn't have oregano, used "krazy salt" instead of salt & pepper, and halved the bell pepper (my kids aren't fans...). it was really yummy, everyone loved it. oh, i also sprinkled a little chopped dried salami on one side prior to broiling, it made for a nice touch for my husband & me. served with a spinach salad & chardonnay. hubby loved it. :)

Very easy and tasty. I omitted the potatoes because I served it with a potato dish, and I used less cheese than it called for. It just didn't need all that cheese (and I love cheese!). Cooked and served it in a cast iron skillet with hash brown casserole (from this site), fruit salad, and cinnamon raisin bread/roll. Will try adding paprika next time as some reviewers suggested-

Great basic frittata w/simple instructions. I sauteed the potato instead of boilint it first. Yes, I would make it with a little less bell pepper and black pepper next time.

This made a quick weekday dinner. Took other's reviewers opinion about it being bland and added some paprika and hot sauce. Added some leftover broccoli too. Not what I would choose for brunch with company, but great for a regular family dinner.

Excellent fritatta, my guest really liked it. I made it for Mother's day brunch. Served it with bacon, fruit salad and homemade brioche. Delicious!

I have made this frittata several times and my husband and I both love it. The potato adds something that other frittata recipes don't have. We've varied the ingredients with whatever is on hand (broccoli, mushrooms), and it is always great. Leftovers make a wonderful breakfast.

Yummy, comfort food. Not super impressive, but a great breakfast or lunch treat. Would be great with chorizo. I used red potato and a dash of hot pepper sauce (also didn't have fresh oregano but used dried). I wouldn't use quite as much veggies either. With a little substitution to suit personal taste, this recipe a keeper and sure to satisfy even the picky eaters in your dining room.

After all the good reviews we were really surprised at how boring and pretty much tasteless this frittata was. It was easy to make and looked pretty, but it just didn't have that much flavor. I'd try another recipe instead of re-making this one.

I make this regularly as is and it is terrific. I've found a way to eat this during the workweek. I have the veggies already cooked -in the morning, I add a one-person portion of the eggs to a mini cast iron pan and finish the recipe.

My brunch guests and I greatly enjoyed this! My first whirl at making a frittata and it was really easy and quite delicious. Would be good for any meal: brunch, lunch or dinner. I added a dash or two of hot sauce to the egg mixture and a little extra cheese. I'll make again.

This was a great dish. Quick, easy and delicious. I didn't find it needed salt, but I was sure to really salt the potato water and the eggs. For anyone else on Weight Watchers, I plugged this in to Recipe Building and it's 10 points per serving. Enjoy!

This was relatively simple to make and quite tasty. Excellent for a Friday night meal when you have leftovers and want to clear out the refrigerator a bit. I would definately make this again. The only modifications I made were to halve it for two, and to use slightly less black pepper than suggested.

Made this recipe tonight for the first time. Modified it to serve three: used 6 eggs (and the appropriate amount of red pepper, onion, and seasonings to go along with the six eggs). It was very bland and needs some ZING!!! Next time I will add some chopped chili peppers or hot sauce, and increase the cheese a bit.

Lacked flavor. I added a jalopeno pepper and it was still boring.

I really enjoyed this. I love frittatas and make them all the time. I used a green pepper since that's what I had on hand. I also used slightly less cheese to keep the calories down. One of my favorites.

This receipe was very easy to assemble and make. I would offer the following options: I would definitely use a sharp(er)cheddar, and I would consider adding a little more salt. Like another reviewer, I added a little cheddar to the eggs before they had started to "set up," and I added more than listed on top of the frittata, before placing it under the broiler. I also sprinkled my pan with fresh paprika before placing it under the broiler. I tried it with Louisiana hot sauce sprinkled on top, as well as salsa, and both make the flavors "pop" more.

My Mother made this dish many years ago, with bits of ham or bacon. During WW11 it stretched the rationed meat.

Very very good. The only thing I changes was to add about 1/2 cup of cheddar to the eggs before cooking, then adding a little more than it called for on top.

I served this for brunch last weekend, and it was SO good and really easy. I didn't change a thing, and everyone loved it! And now everyone is asking for the recipe. I will definitely make it again!
