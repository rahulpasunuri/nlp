Just lovely! I've made it a few times now. Yellow or crook-neck squash easily substitutes when Summer Squash not available. Red Quinoa add lovely color, but tastes just as good with regular. A definite keeper!

My guests and I were totally surprised at this recipe. I figured it would be good, but this was outstanding. I followed the directions exactly except that I used about 3/4 cup raw quinoa and kept everything else exactly the same. There was just about a 1/2 serving left after feeding 4 adults. Will definitely keep this in my weekly recipe rotation!

Beautiful and keeps for a couple of days in the refrigerator. We had some gorgeous fresh corn and added the kernels from two cobs to this lovely salad.

What a delightful salad! I have made this two times in the last two weeks due to my husband's request. I used toasted almonds as I didn't have the walnuts, and I added cherry tomatoes for some color. The second time I added some raw kale and raw mushrooms cut into really small pieces. Both versions of the salad were delicious. I definitely liked the kale added as a nutritional bonus. This recipe is a keeper.

Heavenly dish! Now I wish summer squash was not restricted to summer! Thank you.

I made this for a birthday party where there were several vegans. We simply put the cheese on the side. It turned out the dish didnt need the cheese. Everyone loved it and ask for the recipe. We made it with half zucchini and half crookneck. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this for church pot luck. I used a vegetable broth instead of just water and didn't really measure the water. i used a full cup of quinoa because I needed more bulk to the salad. Aside from that I kept to the recipe. I tried the quinoa before adding all other ingredients and i was like EW but once the whole salad was together it tastes really really wonderful.

I made this for a picnic last night and it was delicious! I used regular quinoa using the 1:2 ratio cooking method and used chicken stock for my liquid. Some of the squash I used were patty pan and they added a bit of whimsy to the salad with their fun shape. I waited to add the dressing until I served it and it traveled beautifully. This is the perfect summer salad! My boyfriend and I enjoyed it so much I'm making it again tomorrow!

Just made this for lunch for a few clients who are vegetarians. Big hit! The only thing I changed was to use a fresh corn stock in place of the water. I served this with grilled Naan hot off the Q. Glad to see real recipes are back on this site!

Have not tried this recipe yet, but will do so soon. A pointer on cooking quinoa: foolproof method is 2:1 ratio of water (or stock) to quinoa. Bring the water to boil, add quinoa and boil on high, uncovered, until water is evaporated. If the quinoa grains have "popped" (they will appear to have a ring around them) the quinoa is done. If not, add a bit more liquid and cook a bit longer. When done, remove from heat and cover for 5-10 minutes. Fluff with a fork.

Turns out that toasted walnuts and quinoa are a WONDERFUL flavor and texture mix. After trying this recipe, I played with it: I substituted kale for the squash. I left the kale in largish pieces, blanched it for about 15 seconds, reduced the cheese slightly and added sweet carmelized onions. Yes, it's a different recipe but the core idea is the same. I'll play with this one a lot!!

This salad was a big hit with summer guests to our lake cottage. I made it several times this summer and it tasted great and complimented a wide variety of main courses. A real keeper. Rinsing and toasting the quinoa and using a 2/1 water/quinoa ratio worked best.

To the cook from Tennessee: The amount of water listed is more than needed because the instructions are to drain the quinoa once it is done as opposed to adding just enough water and letting the quinoa absorb it all.

I have a question. This recipe calls for 1/2 cup of quinoa and 4 cups of water which is a ratio of 8/1 water/quinoa. All the other recipes I've read say the ratio is 2/1? No one complained about it?

I made this for dinner tonight just as the recipe said except for adding a little more up salted squash near the end and this was spectacular. A definite keeper recipe.

I just made this recipe and followed it strictly with the exception of the lemon zest. I decided to leave that out. I also used regular quinoa rather than red. I was surprised by how good the salad turned out. My family loved it and it was very simple to make. It is perfect for the summer because it is best served cold.

Loved this salad. Not being squash lovers, this turned out to be a real treat. Also the walnuts really became very tasty with the dressing. Instead of shaved parmesan I used all grated. Used zucchini, crookneck and pattypan squash.

YUM! I have zucchini and squash in abundance and this is just delicious! Am going to have it as a main over pasta - would also be yummy if a bit of feta were added.

I made this salad for my squash-hating family. They actually liked it! I have been overwhelmed with squash and zucchini from my CSA, so I will definately be making this recipe a few more times this summer.

a superb salad. if you don't add the vinaigrette until later, i bet it'll make good picnic fare. i made the following changes: - didn't have yellow squash, so to my zucchini i added fresh yellow corn (blanched) - skipped the nuts and the shaved parmesan... i think too much parmesan is unnecessary, either use the grated OR shaved but not both - forgot the herbs and it was still delicious - cooked the quinoa in homemade chicken stock the best part is that vinaigrette, which i imagine would work for a variety of grains and legumes, vegetables, cheeses... like brown rice, lentils, buckwheat (not toasted), roasted cooled peppers, pine nuts, feta cheese, burrata. mmmm.

Excellent summer salad. Like others I skipped the parsley and used a bit more basil. The smaller the zucchini and yellow squash the better.

Looove this salad! The combination of basil, walnuts, parmesan and lemon is genious! I cut back a bit on the olive oil and eliminated the parsely because I think it's a pointless herb, especially when you've got basil there. This salad light and nutritious (quinoa is a superfood!) but not lacking in flavor. I've passed it onto friends already and it's definitely a crowd pleaser.

This is a delicious and easy way to deal with an abundance of squash and zucchini in the summer time. The tangy dressing with the crunch of the quinoa really makes the salad.

Wow. This was exceptional! I had some already made quinoa in the fridge, so it was perfect for a no-cook meal in the 95°F NYC heat. I'm not usually a big fan of squash, but this has won me over! I followed the recipe but used more basil than parsley (as I'm not a big fan of parsley either). I only had 1/4 cup walnuts, but felt that was enough. I also didn't add the shaved parmesan, I only used the grated portion. This will be a staple in my house this summer!
