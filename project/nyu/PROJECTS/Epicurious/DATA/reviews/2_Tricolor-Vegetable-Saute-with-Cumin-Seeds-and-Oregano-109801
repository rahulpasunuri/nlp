I definitely would not make this dish again. The colors were beautiful but the lovely vegetables were rendered inedible by the bitterness of the cumin.

This is a very pretty dish, but the flavor is nothing exciting. I would like to try it again, maybe adding some lime zest.

Great - very simple, nothing too unusual, but a great dish and lovely companion to the seafood and rice dishes.
