I tried this for the top of a cake and it was perfect. My daughter asked me to make these for her birthday. They are delicious and I will be making them again.

These turn out beautifully! One thing I learned (the hard way)...be sure to cover every single millimeter with egg white and sugar...any exposed bit of petal will wilt by the next day. Also, be generous with the sugar--too little, and the flower becomes soggy and gummy.

Friends.... What can I say! If I could be a recipe, this is 'the' recipe. Elegance and decadent are the words to describe this recipe. A recipe for those individuals who truly love to cook and eat. kiss...kiss...
