Thanks to the reviewer who made this in a small springform pan ... phenomenal. I've made this for years and never thought of it as cakey but "served in wedges with ice cream" was an awesome idea that I had to try. A great twist on a favorite brownie!

Hmmm, if a "cakey" dessert is your thing, this is the recipe for you. I had seen all of the bother comments about how cake like these came out. I took every precaution I could think of ( using an 8x7 pan, melting the butter 1ar, etc) they STILL were more like a breakfast cake and not a brownie. I'm not saying that is "bad", just not intended.

i doubled the peanut butter (used all natural which is super dense) added a quarter cup cocoa powder to all of it & used only milk chocolate. really fabulous! mine turned out dense cake-like, so a little bit closer to what people were hoping from a brownie. there's lots of room in this recipe varying types of nut butters & chocolates-adding marshmallows, etc.

Pretty cakey for a brownie for sure, but still outstanding.

I am pretty much just echoing what others have already said. These are closer to a snack cake than a brownie. As I prefer a fudgier brownie, these really don't work for me.

This was good although it's more a snack cake than a brownie, as othe reviewers mentioned. I melted the butter, then omitted the chips/chopped chocolate and swirled the batters together -- worked pretty well. I underbaked it a bit to get a fudgier consistency, but it needs something more (or less?) to make it a brownie.

I baked this in an 8 x 8 pan as one reviewer suggested, and sprinkled chocolate chips on top. I tried not to overbake them, but they still came out a bit dry. All and all, it was a good recipe. Next time I will use more peanut butter and sprinkle peanut butter chips or even chopped resee's peaces on top, since there wasn't enough peanut butter taste for me. But definitely something I'd make again with some modifications.

These brownies are delicious. I reversed the layers, putting the pb on the top and sprinkling with add'l bittersweet chocolate. Rich pb flavor and intense chocolate. Will make again and again.

Although I prefer brownies that are more cakey than fudgey, there was nothing brownie-like about them-- this was purely cake. Nevertheless, they were tasty and certainly easy enough.

Wonderful brownies! Made these for a kids party and could not keep the parents away. Most everyone had two, even the kids. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I bake brownies and cookies on a regular basis and this is by far one of the best I have made. I did use two-thirds cup of chopped dark chocolate instead of a half cup of semi-sweet to add to the chocolate layer. This gave a much richer chocolate taste.

These were a hit. I wouldn't change a thing.

Not bad, but I also like a fudgier, less sweet brownie. Still, I might make it again for a change of pace.

Thought that it was a great recipe, loved the ratio of the chocolate to peanut butter. This is in my permanent recipe collection.

These were very good. I also enjoy a more fudgier brownie so I melted the butter before using it and then baked the brownies in a 8x8 pan for 35 minutes. They turned out great and they were gone within a few hours!

These were amazing! A hit with my friends, most of whom went back for seconds. I did the chocolate layer on the bottom and the PB layer on top, and then sprinkled chocolate chips on top for the last 10 minutes of baking and spread around once they had cooled a little bit. Totally decadent, and quite easy. I will be making these a lot if my husband has his way!

Ahhh, dessert divinity. Underbake and use smooth peanut butter for ultimate gooeyness. I love how the flavors meld and yet retain their independence.

Brilliant. I'd almost given up on brownies after having tried so many so-so recipes. But this one hits the spot. No instructional comments to add, this is a great recipe.

I had read that this recipe made more cakey brownies, and I prefer them fudgy so I made them in an 8x8 pan instead with the same cooking time, and they were very good...

This is a tasty recipe. I used to send them to my husband's office to put by the coffee pot and three years later his coworkers still ask for them! Also, from the same issue try the triple chocolate brownies; they are fantastic too!

My husband is a peanut butter fanatic, and loves these brownies. Several reviewers mentioned that these brownies were too cake-like, and I would recommend 5-10 minutes less oven time for a more fudgy result. I made these brownies in a 6-inch springform pan and served wedges with a scoop of homemade vanilla bean ice cream at a dinner party. Phenomenal.

If you like cake-y brownies, you will like these, but if you prefer them to be dense and fudg-ey, these may not be for you. My suggestions: melt the chocolate chips before mixing them in. Also, I would recommend reversing the layers and glazing with a chocolate frosting. I thought they were fair, but my husband loved them and said they had the perfect amount of sweetness.

These were ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! I'm not sure which recipe the other reviewers were making, but it couldn't have been this one. If you are a fan of chocolate and peanut butter, look no further for a piece of heaven. These were so moist, not too sweet but sweet enough, and who cares how well they keep - they will be gone in minutes! I sprinkled the chocolate chips over the brownies before baking, instead of adding them to the chocolate. I also used smooth peanut butter. Make sure you don't overcook them. The timing in the recipe is sufficient to bake them, while still keeping them soft in the center.

I was not thrilled with these brownies. I like a denser, fudgier brownie. They didn't keep that well, either.

Although I am only ten years old i made these tasty brownies. I would definitly make the again. Everyone in my house loves them. If you and/or your child like peanut butter, chocolate and brownies, why not mix them all together. Happy cooking. We di not have the right chocolate, so we just used 8 ounces of semisweet choclate chips.Also we did not have three large eggs, and instead use 2 jumbo eggs. Every thing turned out great, and even a child like me can make tham.

These brownies were good and the recipe worked well, but with all the other brownie recipes in the world to try, these weren't good enough to make again. I am still glad I tried them though.

The brownies were very cake-like and not too sweet (not my preference) however others seems to enjoy the brownies.

These were delicious...Don't skip the chocolate chips. They make them really gooey.
