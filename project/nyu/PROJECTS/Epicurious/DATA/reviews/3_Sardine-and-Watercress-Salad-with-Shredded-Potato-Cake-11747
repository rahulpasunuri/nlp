Husband doesn't love sardines but he cleared his plate with this dish. Didn't have watercress but used spinach and radicchio. Red onions were amazing flavor balancer with mustard dressing and salty sardines. If you kinda like tuna salad then you will love this dish.

This really was good. The sardines in oil are not that strong and taste great with the potato cake, red onions and salad. The only changes I made were to use half fresh watercress and half baby lettuces and rice vinegar instead white wine. My daugter used left-over baked chicken instead of sardines and loved that combo.
