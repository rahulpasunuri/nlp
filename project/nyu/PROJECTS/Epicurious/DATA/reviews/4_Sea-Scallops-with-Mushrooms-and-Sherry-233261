It was quick and delicious. I cut down on the butter and added some baby spinach to the mushrooms. i had giant scallops that looked lovely on top of the mushrooms.

I first made it on Valentines day with my boyfriend. Very romantic and sweet. Perfect just how the recipe is. Delish!!

Very easy way to impress the neighbors. Followed suggestions about not finishing with the salt and adding cream instead of the butter. I also added about 2 T. flour to the salt and pepper to dust the scallops before cooking to give them a nice brown crust. Served the whole thing over fusilli pasta with steamed spinich.

I used fish stock instead of the sherry. I agree about not needing as much salt when using the soy sauce. This is a keeper!

Having formerly been a Cook from NYC - I must agree: lately I've been coming across these HUGE supposedly Sea Scallops (like 8-9 per pound) and I don't know what they really are - but I do know they are not tasty! Whether or not you get lucky with the scallops - THIS is a very yummy recipe - it works well with shrimp or chicken as well.

subbed scallions for shallots and used fresh and dry reconstituted mushrooms (and incorporated some of the mushroom water into the sauce), also skipped the salt at the end and only added 1/3 c sherry as other reviewers recommended. the sauce was delicious, served over wild rice. the only downer of the recipe were the scallops - i had purchased large, thick fresh ones which i thought were going to be amazing, but they ended up tasting incredibly bland, and we actually didn't eat most of them! would have liked to get a better crust and flavor from them - might just make this with chicken next time instead...

I made it with shiitakes instead and less salt. My whole family loved it, and I would certainly make it again

This is a fabulous recipe! Make sure you use the highest quality scallops you can find and don't overcook them. The sauce is full of flavor and the mushrooms provide a tasty accompaniment.

I used 1/2 of the butter and only 1/4 c. of sherry. It was wonderful!!

Made it for Valentine's Day! I didn't use any salt in the recipe, and I used 2TBSP of heavy cream instead of the butter to finish the sauce. The Sherry is the right amount, if you use a nice dry sherry. My husband LOVED it - licked his plate!

I dialed back on the salt a bit and it was just right.

Interesting recipe. Once I prepared the dish I wasn't sure how all the flavors would go together and if it would work, but it did. Is different, but pretty good.

Easy to prep/cook and very good. I used less scallops, more mushrooms and cooked some pasta. Poured the sauce over the pasta and had a chunk of fresh bread alongside.

This dish is extraordinary. I sense that other types of mushrooms would work, but these seem to give the dish an added richness. I used 9 scallops (about 1 pound), and it was a little too much for the two of us; I believe 3/4 of a pound for two people is the correct amount. This is a definite keeper that I will include regularly in our meal planning.

Iused 1/3 cup cream sherry and cooked this with the mushrooms, soy and vinegar. When the mushrooms were cooked, I removed them and added 2 tbs. creme fraiche to thicken the sauce. Then I cooked the scallops and added to mushroom sauce mixture along with the juice and reheated all. Divine!

Only used 1/4 cup of Harvey's Bristol Cream (that's what I had in the cupboard). I was afraid to use the soy sauce and the balsamic vinegar. The mushrooms were delicious and did not over power the scallops. I used oyster and shitake mushrooms.

This is a great recipe. . .Good quality scallops are always delish and preparing them this way is just special.

I made the recipe as written. I thought the sauce was too strong for the delicate scallops BUT my husband loved it and said if he ordered it at a restaurant, he would order it again.

You really should try this recipe. We loved it & it was quick and easy. We didn't use the 2T of butter at the end & most of the salt -- it was still great!

GREAT! I cut the butter and salt down. Will definitely make this again!

I had some problems with this recipe. First, it's way too salty. Either omit the soy sauce or the final 1/4 tsp of salt. Second, the sherry is overpowering. 2/3 of a cup??? I could not detect either the soy (other than the salt) or the balsamic vinegar in the finshed dish, just the sherry. On to the mushrooms, I don't know what the recipe means by "moderately high" heat, but there was no way that I could brown quartered cremini mushrooms in 4 minutes, even on high heat. At that point, they were just letting go of their water. It took a full 10 minutes to copok off all of the water and actually get some browning action going. Finally the resulting sauce is too thin. I will make this again, but I will delete the final salt, cook the mushrooms longer and probably add 3-4 tbsp of cream in place of the final 2 tbsp of butter.

Simple, easy and so good. I cut the butter to a tablespoon and a half, and it was still delicious. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.

Excellent dish. I did not start with the scallops, as they should be served immediately. I made adjustments to the scallop quantity suitable for two people, and used 1/4 cup mix of sweet and dry sherry for the sauce. I reduced the sauce quite a bit over moderately high heat, and then added some white wine, then the butter. I served the mushrooms under, not over, the scallops.

Made this dish last night for the first time. It was wondereful! Substituted Old Bay for the pepper. Served the scallops over baguette rounds brushed with olive oil and toasted in the oven. This is a keeper.

Also I served with bacon and thyme brussel sprouts and a butternut squash polenta.

I made this the other night for the first time, the Sherry makes the mushrooms that you use absolutly amazing and the taste on the scallop is wonderful.

Great. I used sliced baby bellas - they were on sale at the store this week - and it was superb. I think you could get away easily with regular button mushrooms.
