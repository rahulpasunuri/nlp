This was awesome. We made these for Easter brunch with a fruit salad and loved them! We didn't use the mashed potatoes, as they were optional and we didn't have any on hand. We did use Black Lumpfish Roe (that was the only reasonably priced roe we found), and it was an imperative ingredient, in my opinion. Due to the ease of preparation and amazing flavor, it will be a special occasion staple in our house.
