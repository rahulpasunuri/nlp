LOVED this. Finally - a traditional potato salad that doesn't have mushy potatoes or make me want to gag when I swallow. The vinegar adds a nice little zing, and I mashed the egg yolk with some dry mustard and garlic powder (as suggested by others) - delish. Definitely my new go-to recipe for BBQs this summer.

Very good if you're looking for a traditional mayonnaise potato salad. I would use less mayo next time, though, and perhaps a little more celery for more crunch, but that's just my personal preference.

This is the same as my mother made. Delicious. I think the vinegar helps to keep it light. Boiling poratoes are important as they hold up to the mixing. Use light mayo if you have some.

Perfection! I made a couple changes - I used red onion (what I had), added some red bell pepper (to use it up) and took the suggestions of others and mashed the egg yolk with a little ground mustard and mayo and finely chopped the egg. DELICIOUS beyond words, exactly what I was looking for in a potato salad. I think the vinegar step is what helps it from being too rich, yet its nice and subtle. Will be the base for my potato salads from now on as it lends itself very well to variations as well.

I prefer a more Texas-Czech style potato salad, using dill relish, pimentos, onions, eggs, mustard and mayo. But my husband, who I imported from NJ, does not care for this combination. He is always asking for 'normal' potato salad. This was extremely normal...but after adding celery salt, paprika, ground white pepper, and 1/2 c. sour cream it was decent. I'll make it again for him, but if you prefer a more 'deviled' potato salad I don't think you will be satisfied.

This is very close to our family recipe passed down through the ages. For 8 medium potatoes instead of vinegar and salt, marinate in 1/2 cup of zesty Italian dressing. Chill. Add celery, eggs and some chopped pimento then add dressing. Make the dressing by mixing in this order: 1 cup mayo, 3 Tbs. cider vinegar, 1/4 cup evaporated milk, 1 Tbs. grated onion, 1/4 tsp salt and ground pepper to taste. Chill salad several hours. Best dang potato salad period!

I have been looking for a good potato salad recipe and I found it. It is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, but then I added celery seed and dry mustard as suggested by others. As recommended by other reviews, I only used 1/2 of the mayo. Definitely will make this again.

This is the potato salad recipe I have been looking for! Simple, tasty, easy. I cut the mayonnaise a lot, because we're not big on mayo in my house. Still delicious.

Excellent dish for a summer barbecue or as a main course for lunch. I made this salad several times this summer and the family enjoyed it immensely. I liked it because it was not oily and no after taste! I think the secret is the addition of vinegar while the potatoes are warm. It really does give the salad a good tang.

This is the most delicious potato salad! I make this without the boiled eggs and I don't always include the onion, since my husband doesn't like onion. The vinegar really makes this recipe something special - it soaks into the potatoes and perfectly balances the creaminess of the mayonnaise. Yum!

this is the best potato salad I've ever made. Used green onion instead of regular. Added 6 strips of crispy bacon. YUM!

Here are my adjustments: 1 lb. each small red potatoes and small Yukon gold potatoes and four hard-boiled eggs. (I've decided 2 eggs per pound of potatoes is about right.) The potatoes took less than 15 minutes to cook, and I either quartered or halved them, left peels on. I scooped the yolks out and mashed them with 1 teasp. dry mustard and mayo, and chopped the whites pretty fine. Add 6 large radishes grated (large grater hole), 3 chopped green onions, a sprinkling of garlic salt, and fresh ground salt and pepper.

An excellent potato salad! Add some grated radish to help enhance the flavor, maybe two or three.

I would cut the mayonnaise to 3/4 cup - I think the recipe made with 1 c. is overdressed. I also left the skins on the potatoes which improved the salad's appearance - I used Yukon gold potatoes, as well.

Rating: 4
This is our new favorite potato salad. The key to the flavor is peeling the potatoes while still hot and tossing with the vinegar. This answers the age-old question of peeling/cutting before versus after boiling. I previously used the former method ... I'm now a convert. Tossing hot potatoes into the dressing enables them to absorb the flavors. Wow!

I made 1 1/2 times this amount, but, eight of us didn't eat even half. I used 3 lbs. mixed small red potatoes and small Yukon gold potatoes and six hard-boiled eggs. (I've decided 2 eggs per pound of potatoes is about right.) The potatoes took less than 15 minutes to cook, and I either quartered or halved them, left peels on. I scooped the yolks out and mashed them with mayo, and chopped the whites pretty fine. Additions that I didn't use but might be good are a bit of dry mustard added to the yolk mayo mixture, a sprinkling of garlic powder, grated radish, finely minced green onion. Others recommend finely chopped dill pickles, but I hate pickles in potato salad.

Rating: 2
This is a very basic recipe for those who aren't willing to take risks. Go ahead and experiment: add finely chopped dill pickle, grated radish, and finely minced green onion. A rule of thumb passed on by my mother-in-law is (depending on the size of the potatoes) one egg for every two potatoes. Also, a sprinkling of garlic powder never hurts. The key is to taste as you go. My mother-in-law's potato salad is visually appealing and has a delightful taste.

I have made this recipe since I learned it as a girl at home with my mother. If potato salad is needed at a function, I offer to bring it because no potato salad is better than this one. My only additions: Scoop the yolks out of the hard cooked eggs, mash the yolks with the mayo and add a touch of dry mustard. Chop the egg white a little finer than it would be if you left it in whole slices. I never have liked the whole slices of hard-cooked eggs in my salad. This gives the flavor without the whole slice interrupting the salad.

Just made this again using real mayo. A Keeper in my household, my husband does not like sweet pickles or sweet potato salads.

As the name states: "old-fashioned" This is a GREAT classic recipe! First time I made it, I followed the directions exactly. Just made it again & added slightly more celery & more of the hard boiled egg whites (just tossed a couple yolks out)& finely chopped the onion so the flavors married better.

Pretty basic but still a good recipe. I substituted radish for the celery and I added some mustard and sliced gherkins. To the mayonaise I added some buttermilk and sour cream. Delicious!

I added the step of tossing the hot potatoes with a little lemon juice and vegetable oil to keep the potatoes from absorbing too much mayo. Other than that, I doubled the onion and celery and added about 1/2 tsp of Coleman's mustard.

I use a vinaigrette dressing on the hot potatoes, rather than just vinegar and salt, substitute sour cream for half the mayonnaise, crisp cucumber for half the celery, and add a good dash of horseradish instead of mustard, finish with lots of chopped parsley - apart from that, the recipe I have been successfully using for twenty years is identical to this one...:)!!

Ya know--that's okay if you don't like yukons. I discovered them awhile back & found I like them for just about any potato recipe. They are firmer than russets. And have a creamier texture than the reds. Perhaps the ones you found were older. At any rate--perhaps it's like cilantro. Either you like it--or you don't.

I admit I haven't actually made recipe 'tho it sounds good, but I need to ask..What is the rave with Yukon Golds.. everytime I have tried them I do not find them "buttery', but unpleasantly sweet for a potato, and not particularly tasty. This recipe sounds like a good basic, 'specially the half and half mayo and Miracle whip!

Rating: 2
Put simply--this was not worth the effort, and I've had a lot better (see below). This potato salad did have an "old-time" feel to it, but my local supermarket makes something very, very similar. The Boiled Dressing is comparatively easy to make, but WHY? Mayonaisse with a scoop of dijon would taste the same and is a lot simpler. I'm sticking with my mother-in-law's recipe: potatoes, red onion, mayonaisse, black pepper and LOTS of bacon. I defy anyone not to eat a plateful of that...

Very good potato salad... just made over the weekend (along with the skirt steak & garlic bread) ! I added a little dijon mustard (what's potato salad without it )? Also, I definitely didn't leave out the eggs. My husband suggested an apple! I will do that next time, along with a few chopped up pickles - we really liked this potato salad & very easy!!

A perfect version of the classic picnic potato salad. I didn't bother to peel my potatoes, since I used organic yukon golds the first time and fingerlings the second. Left out the egg and subbed in a couple of spoonfuls of sour cream for part of the mayo,which added a little more creamy tang.

This salad is good, but it had a strong vinegar taste; an Italian or French dressing marinade tastes better, in our opinion. Also we prefer more celery and onion than called for in this recipe The tart apple is a nice addition.

Very much like my mother's famous potato salad...her trick, which you must try, is to use 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup of miracle whip. It adds just the right tang. Also, add a pinch of sugar and a touch of yellow mustard, not too much, just a teaspoon or so.

This potato salad's strength is its subtlety. It was delicious even after 3 days--it didn't get watery or too strong. It was refreshing to find a potato salad that wasn't too sweet or full of pickles, sweet or otherwise. We preferred it just slightly chilled, about 1 hour.

My sister made this recipe, and we both loved it. Easy to prepare, not too many ingredients. Texture is a pleasant combination of chunks of potatoes, creamy dressing and crunch celery. Not too sweet--just the way potato salad is supposed to taste. Best of all, it isn't scaled to feed the entire West Coast.

I thought this came out delicious. I substituted a small amount of light sour cream for some of the regular mayonnaise. It lightened up the texture of the salad and dressed it with a nice creamy dressing. I used Yukon Gold potatoes - yum.

This is a great recipe, and it is like the one I always use. I use California long white potatoes, they absorb the flavors the best, and peel the potatoes after cooking, at the hottest temperature you can bear. This helps the absorption of the flavors. I always use Hellman's mayonnaise, it isn't the same without it.

Made this yesterday with the boiled dressing. Thought it would be good for a change. I really like using mayo better (and it is much easier). The dressing makes 1-1/2 cups and the potato salad uses one cup. Now what is one to do with the other 1/2 cup?
