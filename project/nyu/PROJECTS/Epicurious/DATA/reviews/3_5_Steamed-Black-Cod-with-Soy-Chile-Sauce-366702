Amazing! I added veggie broth to the sauce and reduced it on the stove. It made a deliciously thick sauce to pour over the steamed fish. I did not use oil.

I loved it, my husband gave it a thumbs down, thought fish was too bland although he like the sauce. I had never steamed fish before and was really pleased with how moist it was. I followed the recipe using Pacific Cod. I will say I had to read the directions about four times -- and write down the steps with the amount of ingredients in order to keep it straight. It's a fairly straight forward recipe, but boy the way the recipe is written was really confusing to me. If I make it again I will use a fish with more flavor than cod.

I found this to be a bit bland -- okay only with a good bit of soy sauce.

This is one of the most foolproof and easiest fish recipes ever! I have made it with inch thick orange roughy, cod, and turbot flounder. I save the left over steaming broth for pouring over my setter's kibble-makes for a very happy puppy as there are never any leftovers from THIS dish! It keeps in the fridge and is just as tasty reheated, which is saying a lot for fish.

this was way too much work and the finished product was one of the worst dinners we've had recently. i used regular cod; may have over cooked it while i finished making rice as i left the fish covered with foil; still the fish would've had to been AMAZINGG to justify the time spent. also the sauce was the only good part in my opinion and could've 3x'd the recipe.

Delicious! Didn't have the Thai chile, so I used 1/2t red peper flakes for just the right amount of heat.

Was looking for a healthy but flavorful meal and I found it right here!!! Must say this is the best steamed fish I have had! My husband wrinkled his nose when I told him I was steaming cod (he has only had it breaded and deep-fried) and is NOT a fish person at all, but he loved it!!! He actually went in for two servings!

Delicious. The cod was incredibly tender. It melted in my mouth! It was wonderfully infused with flavors from the other ingredients.

LOVED this! Double the sauce and it's a winner! My husband said it reminded him of some of the amazing fish dishes that he ate in China, my 15 year old son LOVED it!

Found the recipe after I bought black cod at the Farmers Market. Used what I had: lime for lemon, added lime juice to the sauce, no ginger & a habanero chili. Amazing flavors!

Great! Lots of flavor, very easy to do. Used Tilapia, worked great. Can't wait to try it with the cod.

One of my fav Cantonese style dishes (except they don't use garlic, lemon or chiles). Also works great with sole.

Made this last Sunday with Ocean Perch. It is really good. Be carefull with the fish thickness. Should be at least 1 inch.
