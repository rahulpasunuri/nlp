I am not brave enough to try the potatoes without first wrapping them in foil - however, the difference in taste compared to conventional roasting methods is amazing.. whenever we are at the cottage, it's the only way to cook potatoes..

Personal ethics (and issues) aside, has anyone actually made this? I agree that the roasted potatoes are great, but has anyone done the full recipe (and if so, please comment, without rudeness) Thanks

Sha-bam! Score one for the geese! Come on, Philly, do lobster next!

Sure, NY, Keep telling yourself that. I'm a little confused though: what exactly do the geese use naturally in place of the long metal tubes which are stuck in their stomachs to facilitate the force-feedings? Hollow reeds perhaps? Amazing that they're able to cram them down there -- you know: without having opposable thumbs and all. But don't worry, I'm sure your theory rings true for those who share your limited intelligence and compassion.

Cook from PA, your ignorance and self-importance are striking. Clearly you know not of which you speak, as the fattening process through which the geese gain their heavenly flavor mimics the natural feeding which preceeds their yearly migrations. Why don't you stop leaving pathetic and distracting reviews on recipies and other cooks and try presenting your comments positively as alternate methods for people who share your limited palate?

I didn't find the sarcasm amusing...because... I often roast potatoes in the coals/ashes of my wood stove. This imparts a flavor not found in other "modern" methods. Also do this when camping out, making enough for leftovers to fry up in the morning for breakfast. Quite practical, really, and tasty to boot.

You need a place to put the "carefully removed" logs. We served this with fresh killed Mastodon steaks (be sure to remove all spears and arrows!) and Brontosaurus blood sauce. Delish!
