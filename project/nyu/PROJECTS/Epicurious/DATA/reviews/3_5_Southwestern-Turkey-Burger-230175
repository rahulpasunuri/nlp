Soooo good, soooo easy, SOOOO YUMMMY!!! I wasn't exactly sure how much meat I had so I kind of eyed the rest of the proportions and it came out totally awesome so I get the feeling this dish could be variated a LOT and still be absolutely delicious!

I used chicken instead of turkey. A better choice for sure. Turkey is so overrated. And unless you treat it right , it comes out dry. Other than that , great burgers!

The best burger I've ever made! Definitely a keeper :)

Excellent! Moist and tasty! I replaced the breadcrumbs with oatmeal. I also added two chipotle peppers into the batch, and threw them on the grill. As a side note: I'm not going to eat any burger, ever, on an english muffin.

Chose black beans over kidney, whole egg instead of just white and grilled instead of pan fried. Definitely a keeper!

Just made them. I used a full pound of turkey for the burgers, but even so I found I had enough for about 12 patties (I prefer a rounded hockey puck.) I also used chickpeas instead of kidney beans just because that's what I had. I left out the cilantro and substituted panko for breadcrumbs. With a little hot sauce on the burger, it's pretty good. I'd definitely consider seasoning the meat a bit more if you leave out the cilantro or choose a slightly blander bean. Also, I broiled on a lightly oiled, foil-lined cookie sheet. Turned out fine.

Since when is 17g of fat considered low fat?

They ended up very tasty. But the patties were really moist and smushy when I made them, so I didn't even attempt to fry. Broiling worked out nicely. I will add hot spices next time (just a preference, still very good w/o the hotness).

These are the tastiest turkey burgers that I've ever had. Yum!! I substituted refried beans for the kidney beans and it tasted great.

These are a household staple - I've been making them for years. Don't skip the diced cheese... it creates little pockets of goodness within the burgers. I have made a version of this recipe as a turkey meatloaf as well and it was delicious too.

a good use for leftover ground turkey and black beans. I cooked the burgers on lightly oiled parchment paper in a frying pan and had no trouble with sticking. They were a bit crunchy on the outside and moist within. We thought they were pretty tasty and a nice change from ordinary burgers.

Yuck, that's the best way I can describe this fiasco.

My family really liked these. They were a nice change. I used the kidney beans and they were good but I think that black beans would be even better. I cooked them on a very hot cast iron skillet on the grill. I was happy that they got a nice crust even though they patties were very moist.

These were great! I didn't have kidney beans or cilantro, but they still had a very full flavor. My somewhat picky husband actually loved them. Mine did fall apart because of sticking, so I think I would broil or grill next time. Other than that, they are definitely a new favorite burger at my house.

These were great. They are very moist and were even eaten by our almost 2 year old. Really tasty turkey burgers.

This was awesome. I did not have any kidney beans, and it still was great. Moist, juicy and full of flavor.

These were great! I used black beans instead of kindey, and didnt have cilanto... but they still turned out very good. I pan fried the first two but had trouble with sticking, so I broiled the rest with perfect results.

I made this recipe and took it to work to grill and everyone just loved it. I didn't put the kidney beans in, instead I used salsa with black beans and corn. The burgers were moist and flavorful.
