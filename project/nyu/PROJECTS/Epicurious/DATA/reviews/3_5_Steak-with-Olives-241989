My husband and I loved this quick alternative to steak on the grill. Perfect for nights when the weather is bad or you don't want to wait on the Big Green Egg to fire up. Next time we'll cut back on the hot red- pepper flakes. We're fans of heat, but both agreed they overwhelmed the other flavors.

I made this tonight and the presentation was fabulous! My vegetarian daughter said if she was a meat eater she would dig right in based on the appearance. I used top sirloin and cooked the steak a few minutes shy of the recommended time for medium rare. It turned out perfect. I will be making this again. So easy!

We used kalamatas for this & it was wonderful over the steak. It would probably pair well with most meats. Nice quick dinner that I would definitely serve to guests & plan to put in regular use. Served with fresh broccoli & a salad.

I thought it was great! Strong flavors, which were very tasty.

I think kalamata olives actually would work better than cured ones (they make the sauce too salty). Other than that, this dish was good.

The olive "sauce" is not really a sauce at all ... more like a dry chimichurri. But it's still tasty, and pairs well with the beefy sirloin.

Delicious! Easy and tasty. I messed up and combined garlic, red pepper flakes, and oil with olives without waiting--but it was still great. And easy.

I made this last night, and do not do what I did. I made 1/2 of the meat to serve 2, and followed a reviewer's suggestion to make the whole amount of "sauce" (which is really a topping). Used a scant 1/2 cup of pimento stuffed manzanilla olives, and the "sauce" was lousy, so I added about 1/2 cup of dry red wine and about 2 tsp. of honey, and reduced it to make a true sauce. Then it was edible, and was actually good.

I used kalamata olives as well. Very easy and good! You will need to double or triple the olive sauce for 4 servings.

This was very good. The sauce adds wonderful flavor and it was very quick and easy. Served with a spinach & summer squash salad and found the whole thing very tasty and healthy.

Its good, the problem that I have with Epicurious is their portioning is a bit out of wack. This recipe, like many others, is touted as "healthy" but completely overstates protein (you get over 100% of your Protein RDA with this dish) while totally neglecting grains and veggies. TO anyone making epicurious's recipe's as a smart healthy dinner entree I higly reccomend reducing the portion size of meat and adding in a veggie and some carb. of your choosing.

I was iffy about this while I was making it, but I enjoyed it a lot. All of the flavors work together quite well, surprisingly.

I made a half recipe, which served two well. I used kalamata olives and really liked the rough, thick salsa-type sauce.
