Born in New Haven and I believe Pepe's to be the best pizza on earth. Extra cheese and finely chopped onion and salted capers improve this recipe greatly. Canned clams are fine, but cheap olive oil is not.

I followed the advice of the "Cook from NJ" and the pizza was WONDERFUL!!

Being from CT and no longer living there I crave a clam pizza once a month. Although this recipe is a good starting point I have added a few ingredients that take the taste to the next level. In addition to the oregano I added basil & parsely (all fresh!), whole baby clams (not minced - from can ok), bacon (precooked and crumbled) and mozzarella cheese. The olive oil MUST be extra virgin and very little is needed. After baking I add hot pepper flakes on top. YUMMM!!!!

Folks, my family in conneticut is are Pepe's pizza patrons and they make a great sloppy thin crust pizza, white or red. Here in Georgia I make white clam pizza with a wheat crust that I make in my bread machine ( no work). I always start with chopped garlic and parsley and add dried oregano along with crushed red pepper and both pecorrino and parmesean cheese. You really need some good extra virgin olive oil to drizzle over the whole pizza and being that I'm land locked in Atlanta I use canned clams. My husband born and raised here thought I was crazy the first time I made this but one bite and you can't deny it.

My father used to make this for us when we were young, and I loved it! So I thought I'd make it for my children as a treat. We too were disappointed. I think that the recipe really needs more cheese. I made it again and used a mixture of parmesan, romano, and a more potent, Asiago cheese and it was a little more zesty.

I made this when the recipe was first published about four years ago. It sounded wonderful to clam lovers like us, but the taste just didn't deliver. It was a fair amount of work for a mediocre result. It may have possibilities with some adjustments, and I'd be open to trying it again if others have suggestions on improving it.
