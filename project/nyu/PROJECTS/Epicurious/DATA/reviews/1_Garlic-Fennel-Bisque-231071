This soup was surprisingly bland. I can think of a few improvements that might make this viable, but haven't tested yet. - 50% to 100% more garlic (possibly roasted) - Indian fennel powder or ground fennel seeds - Salt and pepper - Less water and more half and half or something thicker like heavy cream - Thyme

i'm surprised at bon appetit - don't even bother with this recipe! it's basically garlic & fennel poached in milk - BLAH!!! the only way this was remotely palitable was when i added 2 T. of roasted garlic i had in my fridge along with LOTS of salt & pepper. althought my thanksgiving guests were kind,it was only OK, but not worth making again.
