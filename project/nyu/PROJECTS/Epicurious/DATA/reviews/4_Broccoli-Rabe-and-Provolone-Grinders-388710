Delicious. The highlight of a potluck meal. Some thought it too spicy/bitter but I thought it was a sophisticated blend of flavors.

Since making it for the first time in February, this has become one of our top five favorite weeknight dinners. We've made some minor changes. First, we only use about two tablespoons of really good olive oil in the white bean paste. More than that made it too greasy. We use four cloves of garlic in that, too. Second, we skip that whole blanch-sauté routine with the rabe and follow the CI method of cutting it into 1/2 inch pieces, rinsing, then sautéing the slightly wet rabe with some garlic (about 8 cloves if you make the quantity in the recipe) and olive oil. Way quicker and every bit as good. Don't use expensive provolone. It's too strong and doesn't melt very well. Finally - and you don't have to do this for the sandwich to be good, but this puts it over the top - we crumble 1-2 strips of bacon on each sandwich. The smokiness, salt and meatiness elevates this sandwich to a favorite among everyone.

I made this for a garden party. It was fabulous. Some minor modifications: I used Cannellini beans, I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of a whole head and I didn't use quite that much olive oil either. It was excellent. It was easy to make ahead and then just assemble and throw into the oven which is exactly what I wanted. If you make it ahead of time ensure that you squeeze lemon on the rapini so that it dosen't turn brown. Fab! I will definitely make this again.

Made this last night and it was super tasty. I was only cooking for 2 and I used one bunch of brocolini which was more than enough. I didn't feel the need to let the brocolini cool a 2nd time before assembling sandwiches. Didn't try it but some roasted pepper on top may also be yummy.

This was delicious. I will admit that I couldn't find broccoli rabe (I live in TN) so I went with kale and mushrooms. Cooked the mushrooms with the garlic, did the kale the same way they recommended for the rabe. I also used less oil.

Yes, very tasty! Classic Mediterranean home cooking, right down to the beans. Well done. The comment about 'new cuisine' hit me out of the blue, however, as I must have missed where someone said it was. Oh well. (Chuckles)

I found this delicious. I love Philly roast pork sandwiches with rabe and provolone and found this just as tasty with the beans instead of meat. Like mizk1, I reduced the oil and found no need for more. I also crushed the garlic (much quicker) and did not process the bean mixture. This is a very heart, basic sandwich. I really enjoyed it.

Ive been making these sandwiches for years. The only thing I do differently is I add cooked, and sliced Italian hot, or sweet sausages.

This is an old time sandwich, vegetables and cheese that immigrants ate for lunch. This is not new cuisine.

Add roast pork to this and you have an already time-tested and approved Phily sandwich.

Made as written it was extremely oily, though the flavours were good. If I make it again, I would cut the amount of oil by 1/2 at least if not by 2/3.
