I absolutely loved this! It was one of the most raved about appetizers at our bbq, super easy to make, and great for a hot day! Serve it with crostini or a fresh baguette.

This was a lovely light spread. I used a whole garlic clove and used lime olive oil instead of regular.

I thought this was going to be a refreshing spread. It didn't have much taste and even the mint seemed to get lost in the cheese taste. I had a seven course meal and this was the one item that didn't get much attention

Interesting. I just made a cheese and mint pizza based on a Syrian hot pita sandwich of cheese and mint and it turned out pretty good. I bet a version of this spread as a pizza topping would be similar. More to come

Light, delicious and perfect for warm weather entertaining. I added a bit more garlic the second time I made this, and used lava salt.
