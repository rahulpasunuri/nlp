Great basic stuffing recipe! I make a few adjustments (as I usually do with recipes): (1) I use 1 loaf of day-old sourdough and 1 loaf day-old wheat bread, (2) I add 1 lb sweet sausage and 1/2 lb spicy sausage/chorizo, preparing the sausage the way it is suggested in the "Variations" section at the bottom of the recipe, (2) I add 1 lightly beaten large egg as I mixing all the ingredients (to give the stuffing that slightly gooey consistency and guard against any potential drying out of the stuffing), (3) I add a carton of bella mushrooms (sauteeing them with the onions and celery), and (4) I double the amount of herbs suggested (doesn't hurt to add a dash of nutmeg either). The result is a very flavorful stuffing with a slight kick.

A few years ago I made 3 different stuffings for Thanksgiving: a sausage/apple stuffing and a cornbread stuffing from this site, and Stove Top stuffing. Everyone agreed that the Stove Top was the best. Ever since then I've been begrudgingly making Stove Top but this year after reading the ingredient list on the box I just couldn't do it. I made this recipe instead and everyone liked it. I used olive oil instead of butter (and only 6T) and vegetable stock instead of turkey stock (and more of it) to make it vegan and it was really good.

We used this for Thanksgiving dinner and found it to be very dry. The flavor is great, but it needs a lot more stock to make it better.

Delicious! The classic stuffing recipe I have been searching for. I made my own croutons with day-old bread.

This was out of this world. I used Jimmy Deans sausage, tablespoon of minced garlic and two eggs. I put it into a meat loaf pan (2 of them). Don't pack it in. The stuffing was gone by the end of the night. I am in the South now and even they loved this stuffing.

My favorite traditional stuffing recipe. I do make some changes... I use fresh bread that i let get stale or cube and dry in the oven. Whole Foods rosemary olive oil loaf is a good option. I also use fresh herbs to taste instead of dried. Finally, i zest about 1/4 lemon into the mixture which adds a nice brightness to the stuffing. I personally can't imagine having stuffing outside of the bird... Alton Brown provides great tips on how to do so safely.

I didn't find this dry at all (last review)... I am adding this to my Thanksgiving must haves. I doubled the recipe and baked outside of the turkey and it turned out amazing.

One word: Dry. Followed this recipe to the T, and even added more turkey stock. Comparable to soggy bread cubes. The stuffing never formed that smooshy goodness that is stuffing. We are big time cooks in my house. Stick to recipes on cooks illustrated.

I have been making this one since it was first posted in 2007. my family loves it just the way the recipe is written so why play with it? Once again, it didn't disappoint. I did get the celery & onions prepped in advance which made it very easy Thanksgiving day.

I liked using this recipe, I wasn't sure on amounts though I knew the basics of the recipe. I used seasoned breadcrumbs. But I still added the celery salt, salt and pepper. I also used chicken stock it worked out great.

Wow! This was the best I've ever eaten! I would not substitute anything or ruin it by stuffing a bird with it!

Rating: 3
Yup, pretty good! I cut down on the salt a little because the bread was reaaaaally well pre-seasoned. I baked it about 5 mins longer than the recipe states, but still would've liked it crispier on top.

Oh, my! For a more traditional stuffing, this is excellent! It is so very moist and flavorful that it doesn't need to be stuffed into the turkey or chicken in order to be wonderful. Everyone who tried it commented on how good it was! I would highly recommend this great recipe!

Excellent recipe that allows for your own creativity. I added ground pork sausage, some diced dried apricots, fresh peeled and chopped waterchestnuts and oyster & shitake mushrooms I sauteed with fresh sage. Also mixed bread and cornbread crumbs. Doubled the recipe and not a spoonful left.

This is a classic and I am big fan of classic stuffing. Like the other reviewers I added apples and more turkey stock. Next year, Im going to reduce the bread amount a bit and add other interesting things. Since the turkey was still in the oven when I added the pan, I cooked it at 325 for 30 minutes then 350 for 10 minutes uncovered. I wouldnt say it was that crunchy on top but it tasted great.

I've made this stuffing for Thanksgiving for the last 2 years and will probably continue to do so. We always make it outside of the bird, so I guess it's technically dressing ;). My store carries 12 oz packages of stuffing cubes, and it turns out fine. I didn't have any celery salt this go round, so I subbed Old Bay and a smidge more salt. Yum!

This was a good recipe. I used hot italian sausage and mushrooms, as well. The stuffing baked outside the bird does need the additional broth. Also added red pepper flakes to it.

I added mushrooms, almonds and craisins! I also used fresh herbs (all I had) instead of dried. Delicious, easy and flavorful! My family loved it! So did my guests!

I changed up a bit and used fresh herbs and bread instead of dried. I also added raisins that I rehydrated and some chopped apples. I didnt stuff it into poultry, just placed in pan and baked...used as a side. Pretty good!

We made our own croutons instead of store bought, and added andouille sausage. Delicious! For moister stuffing, you might want to use a bit more stock than called fo -- the recipe as written was a bit too dry for us.

Stuffing, to me, is the most important part of the holiday dinner, and so I'm happy to say that you can't go wrong with this stuffing recipe. I've made it twice for holiday dinners, both times cooking it entirely outside the bird, and using boxed chicken stock. I cooked the vegetables one day ahead to save time and reheated them as directed in the recipe. If you want to make sure you get some nice crispy stuffing on top, you must remember to take the foil off 15 minutes before removing the dish from the oven. Enjoy!

I made this for a thanksgiving potluck with friends before thanksgiving, and they LOVED it! It was a little dry, so I added and extra half cup of turkey stock for real thanksgiving. My family just finished eating it--it was amazing! Just what I wanted my stuffing to taste like. I'll be making this just for fun in the future!

I made this last year, and came back this year to get the recipe again. This recipe got rave reviews from my family. I added additional stock to the portion baked outside the turkey to keep it moist.

This was very good and easy to make ahead as directed in the recipe. I also added some chopped dried cranberries with the sauteed veg. Yum! Way tastier than the boxes and almost as easy!

Made this for Thanksgiving with the sausage. I liked the sausage addition, but everyone agreed it was way too dry and not very good. Won't make it again.

I did not use this recipe to stuff the turkey, but made it as a side dish; used a little over twice as much turkey stock as it called for. Also used homemade bread cubes. Was a hit!

Everyone raved! I added 8 oz. browned sweet Italian sausage. Since I didn't have celery salt, I just used 1 tsp. plain salt (instead of 1 tsp celery salt and 1/4 tsp salt as the recipe called for). I'm not usually a stuffing fan, but this was yummy.

This tasted very salty. I prefer using whole grain bread cut up that is not preseasoned. I add shredded carrot, celery, onion, parsley, poultry seasoning,butter, stock.

This is a nice, simple recipe with great flavors. I made a few adjustments because it was last minute and that's how it goes in my kitchen. I used vegetable stock instead of turkey stock. I also added in sliced carrots. I cooked it all in my dutch oven and it turned out lovely.

This recipe is very tasty and always gets rave reviews. We call it our Scarborough Fair stuffing because of the parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme. These classic flavors are the perfect base for lots of variations. At different times I've added mushrooms, chicken sausage, apples, cranberries... everything works.

Family loved it! It is a simple stuffing recipe but it was perfect with the Roast Turkey with Carmelized Onion Gravy.
