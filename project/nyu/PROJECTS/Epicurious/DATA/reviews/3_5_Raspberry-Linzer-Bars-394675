These are delicious. I used basic wax paper to roll the dough out in between and also froze it prior to final assembly. Since I had marionberry jam on hand, I used that and the bars tasted great.

These bars are delicious; however, the recipe requires some modification. Rolling out the dough between two pieces of parchment proved a little problematic. So roll out to no thinner than 1/4 inch thick rather that the 10 by 12" size in the recipe. And FREEZE the dough rather than refrigerating it and then it will easily peel off of the parchment paper. Follow these two steps and you'll have delicious bars with less frustration.
