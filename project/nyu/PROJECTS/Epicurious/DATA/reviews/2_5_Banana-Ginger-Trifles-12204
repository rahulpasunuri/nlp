Sounded delicious, turned out horrible. Cookie crumbs and custard did not stay separate, but melded into a thick, gritty mud-like substance. Unattractive. Could have used a little less ginger (and I love ginger) as the flavor grew much stronger overnight.

This was easy, delicious and it looked great! I used Spanish 43 Liquor instead of banana liquor and it was fine. I also doubled the recipe and made it in a large glass bowl instead of individual bowls. I will definately make this again.
