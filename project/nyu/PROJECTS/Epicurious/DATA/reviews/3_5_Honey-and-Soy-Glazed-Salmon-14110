Prepared this in a cast iron skillet. Delicious. Just brought out the flavor of the fish in a perfect way. Not a super strong marinate.

I made this dish this evening and it was absolutely wonderful. It was so moist. I bought a piece of salmon just over a pound and it was rather thick. I sauteed it for 4 1/2 minutes per side over medium high heat which created a moist meat with a crispy golden exterior. I did make one mistake. I added the sesame oil(which was recommended and ginger) to the topping ingredients. To correct that I just poured most of the oil out of the pan before adding the topping ingredients. I also added just a pinch of cornstarch which created a thick topping for the salmon. This is going into my favorites file.

Excellent recipe and very easy and quick. I used sesame oil instead of the vegetable and, on first try, did not use ginger. But I think this would would make it better. Quick. Easy. Tasty. What else is there?

We were really disappointed with this dish. I used lemon juice instead, but I don't think that was the problem. We just thought the saltiness from the soy sauce was too overpowering. Our 2 year old liked it though, due to the saltiness. Sauteed spinach saved our meal.

I'm in shock. I *hate* salmon, but this recipe just may turn me into a regular lover! The ginger added a LOT of great flavor, I used a squeezed lemon. And to my utter shock, my 3 & 4 yo sons crammed this into their mouths hand over fist. At the store, I asked the fish guy to remove the skin, which helped me get past that horrible fishy smell when cooking it. (I know, I know, the skin is good for you, but if I had to deal with it, I just wouldn't ever make it!)

You can use lemon juice in place of lime. Add sauce to pan after turning the salmon. Sesame oil may be used in place of vegetable oil, in fact, it's preferred in my house. We just love eating salmon made this way.

This recipe was dissapointing. The two sauces work well together, but don't really make the dish. I added a large dash of dried red pepper flakes and a small dash of sesame oil to the honey sauce, which helped signficantly. There are other recipes that are far better, that I would prefer to make again, rather than this one.

Great recipe!! I served it for some friends and there wasn't a scrap left on anyone's plate. I served it with steamed green beans and soy noodles. I have to share the noodle recipe I got from my boss. 1/2 # cooked angle hair noodles, 3 Tbsp. Soy sauce, 2 Tbsp. Peanut oil, 1 Tbsp. Seseme oil, Fresh diced garlic, ginger and green onions, red pepper flakes to taste. It was great, even good as cold noodles the next day!

Wonderful!! and so fast and easy! The sauce comes together in 5 min or less. I pan-fried the salmon, which was good; curious to try bbq. Served with snow-peas and just a few seseame seeds on top.

Have made this several times so far for it is very easy to make. Have used maple syrup and it also serves as a good substitute, though darker grades hold up to the strong flavors better. Great serving suggestion by the cok from Rochester, ILL. Have also used baby spinach and shredded fennel with other types of asian-like vinaigrettes. Thanks for the inspiration. Great weeknight meal- easy and fast to prepare.

Great recipe - has become one our regular salmon preparations. A wonderful alternative to bottled teriyaki sauce. I made no alterations/substitutions to the recipe and we loved it!

This is my go-to recipe for a teriyaki glaze. Don't just heat ingredients, simmer til the sauce thickens so it clings to fish. Serve glazed fish on bed of shredded napa cabbage drizzled with spicy vinaigrette (sesame oil,rice vinegar, garlic, red pepper flakes, ginger). Garnish w green onions and toasted sesame seeds.

This is a staple on the recipe rotation. I cook the glaze separately to avoid the oily factor. This way you can time the dish better.

so easy and a new flavor for the salmon. I would serve the glaze split--some over the salmon and some to pass around for those who need more.

Extremely easy and delicious. As others suggested, I put in the oven after searing and doubled the sauce. Served over garlic mash w/broccoli. My husband loved it. Great week night meal.

This was so easy and yummy! I tripled the sauce, used lemon juice, and had to cover the fish at the end to insure it was cooked as well as I like. I would have preferred the sauce to be thicker and will try other suggestions such as adding sauce while fish is cooking and possibly some arrowroot. Will definitely make this again!

After all the positive comments on this, I was surprised that it was not better. It is easy and quick, but I felt like the sauce was a little too sweet and missing something. I may try it again with grated fresh ginger and a little more lime.

The sauce is excellent. Cook the salmon really hot, it gets a nice crust, throw the sauce in and it sizzles down in a few seconds. Yes, it's fast food salmon, but isn't that the beauty of it?

We like this recipe very much. Sometimes I make it as written, other times I marinate the salmon in the glaze then grill it, saute it, bake it, or broil it (sometimes lime, sometimes lemon). Flexible recipe without changing the dish. Whatever way, these are great flavors with salmon.

Perfect with tuna fresh off the grill. We were low on honey once so I threw in a little maple syrup and it still tasted great.

This was a great quick recipe for fishlovers! It was a hit with the whole family!(even the 3 yr old)The only thing I did differently was to put the glaze on the fish after I had flipped it and started cooking the second side. It thickened nicely with the heat of the frying and coated the fish well.

I thought this was going to be better than it was, but I'm willing to try again. I cut in half because I was only cooking for two. Very runny and I'll try next time some flour or corn starch to thicken it up.

I collect salmon recipes, and this one is right up there with the easiest and best. As happened with others, my fish didn't cook through in the recommended time. You may want to preheat your oven to about 500 degrees for a few minutes final cooking time. The reviewer from Madison, WI on 07/02/00 had what I thought is a good suggestion. That is to add a small amount of arrowroot mixed with a little water to thicken the glaze. Probably cornstarch would do as well. However, since few people seemed to have done this, it's hardly necessary. As for extra glaze, I made half again the amount, which was just right. If lime juice isn't available, my hunch is that lemon juice would work well.

Rating: 4
I've made this dish at least 4 times now and we love it. It's best done in the skillet with wild salmon (not farm raised) that has a little more fat in it. And the bonus is that it's fat that's good for you!

Unusual combination of flavors. I liked it, but am still not sure whether I loved it. My family also only liked it. Easy to prepare, though I did have to bake it at 400 for 15 minutes after searing it (they were large pieces). I might make it again for something fast & fairly tasty.

OUTSTANDING!!!! Simple, easy and absolutely delicious. What more could you ask for? I grilled the fish like other readers and added the sauce at the end. Tonight I'll marinate it.

I will start by confessing that I am a salmon lover. However, my boyfriend had always claimed not to like fish and we both loved this recipe!! In fact I made in twice in the same week and a few days later in the grocery store he looked at the fish counter and said "oooh, look, salmon!" The sauce complements the fish perfectly. I served it on top of coconut rice and surrounded with snow peas and broccoli sauteed in soy sauce and garlic. Delicious!! I can't wait to make it for my family when I visit them.

Rating: 4
Very tasty and an extremely easy and elegant recipe. I also marinated the salmon in the sauce and then grilled it which gave it a wonderful carmalized coating. This is great company food! I paired it with grilled potatoes, a nice salad and french bread...no pans! P.S. Spray the grill first with Pam.

Throughout our dinner, my husband kept saying, "This is the best salmon I've ever had!" (much to my delight), and I have to agree! I substituted the lime juice with lemon and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I placed the salmon in the sauce and let it marinade before I baked it. Excellente!! No doubt, I will be cooking this the next time we have guests.

Rating: 3
What a fantastic way to prepare salmon! I thought the sauce complemented the fish very well. I decided that my fish was still too raw after I had made the sauce, so I just placed the fish back in the pan, along with the sauce and baked it at 400 for about 8 minutes. Delicious!!

Rating: 4
I'm not a huge salmon fan but I do try to eat it for the health benefits. This recipe was easy and very tasty. My only complaint is that the salmon takes longer than 2-3 minutes on each side to be cooked through. I "seared" my filet and then baked it in the oven for 12 minutes on 400 degrees. Served it over soba noodles with some dark sesame oil.

I personally don't like salmon but my husband loves it. This receipe has received rave reviews from him and our guests (I like the sauce just not the fish). I know we have made it at least 30 times and each time the results are the same - rave rave rave. My husband likes honey so he adds a bit more and boils the sauce until it almost carmalizes.

Rating: 4
"Fan-Freaking-Tastic" !!! You can't get much more simple than this recipe, and the results were just amazing. Made 50% more of the sauce, and for guests would double amounts. Make sure you serve something (bread or rice) to soak up the sauce ... or else people will be licking the plates! YOU GOTTA TRY THIS RECIPE! Thank you Epicurious!

An easy-peasy dish--and yummy. I served with mashed potatoes and a green salad and it was a great take on comfort food. As per suggestions, I doubled the glaze and in it, and added fish sauce. Also added a few drops of sesame oil for a richer oriental flavour and it turned out really yummers. It plated nicely against the green salad and creamy potatoes.

I baked the salmon in the oven. When it was almost done, I put the glaze on top. I spooned the glaze over the salmon again and then poured it over the salmon on the serving plate. I didn't add the water, because it looked fluid enough. I served this (with a salad) dill sauce, and garlic mashed (red) potatoes. Both recipes from the site. I had a piece of fish that was about 1 1/2 pounds and this was plenty of glaze. I love salmon and never before made it at home. Now I will.

This recipe is foolproof! It's also a dish fit for casual dinners with friends, or for a last second weeknight dinner. Both in terms of time and number/accessibility of ingredients it is commendable, but above all, it just tastes delicious! If you'd like a thicker glaze, try stirring in some arrowroot powder (similar to cornstarch, but has a finer, lump-free finish) to the glaze before you simmer it...

This recipe was fabulous! I decided not to take out the salmon before I added the glaze, and let it simmer for about an extra minute to let the glaze seep into the fish. This intensified the flavor and added a delicious crispy layer to the outside of the fish. Mmmm...good!
