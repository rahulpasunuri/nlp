Wow! Wow! Wow! Easy, delicious and gorgeous. What more can you ask for? My first time making panna cotta. Made recipe exactly as written (well, no micro, so I heated gelatin over very low heat), and it was perfect. Used "stemless martini glasses" from Cost Plus and it looked 10 times better than picture shown.

I love this recipe. I use it as a base and change it up with all different flavor combos. Enjoy.

Very easy to make! I used canned cherries though. 1 envelope from the Knox brand gelatin, comes out to about 2 1/2 tsp.. just a little over what the recipe calls for. Still came out just fine in the end.

Absolutely delicious. Takes very little work to make, lots of waiting around for things to set but definitely worth the wait. The custard is surprisingly less sugary than I expected, but the cherry mixture has the perfect amount of sugar in it to sweeten up the whole thing. A perfect balance. And the crunchy toasted almonds are a great contrast to the silky custard.

I made this for the 4th of July and everyone raved about it. Easy to make ahead and then doing the cherries the day of.

This is a great summer dessert! It's really easy and very tasty. The almond flavor and cherries work very well together.

This dessert rocks! It's easy to make, too, and I say this despite the fact that my gelatin boiled over (twice) and my cream (once). The second time on the gelatin, I even had my microwave at 40% power...really gotta be vigilant! As the panna cotta was cooling, it developed skin on top that I was afraid was going to make it chewy or lumpy, but after the indicated stirring, it turned out fine. The flavors are just sublime.

I've made this a couple of times, tweaking it for a party. Love that everything can be made ahead of time and just assembled at serving time. Great with an Italian or BBQ menu. I've got two more parties to throw this summer. This will be on the dessert table for both. I prefer Kirsch in the cherries instead of the almond liquor. Think I'm going to try substituting Grand Marnier in the cherries next.

Cherry pits can also be "scooped" out with a paper clip. Open the clip by bending it in half 180 degrees, so that there's a half loop at either end (an S shape, if you will). Grasp one end, and use the loop at the other end to scoop out the pit through the stem hole. The more ripe the cherries are, the easier this is to do.

I used just a fraction of the almond extract...it was more than enough. The panna cotta was lovely with the cherries.

Beautiful. I'm usually not a fan of panna cotta, but this is one of those examples where the total is more than the sum of it's parts. My husband who thinks dessert is not dessert if it's not chocolate loved it. I will certainly make this again.

Very good! I'll admit I tried the panna cotta alone 1st without the topping and wasn't too impressed, but when it all came together it was great. I will be making this again this summer.

This was very easy and very good. My husband, who is not a dessert fan, really liked it. Most can be done ahead, which makes it even better!
