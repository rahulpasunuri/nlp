We make this recipe every year for Christmas dinner and it is delicious. We usually eliminate the watercress and cut the topping by 1/2 - the recipe makes WAY more than you need.

Made it to the letter except for the watercress which I too, could not find. I did use Herbsainte instead of Pernod for a more authentic New Orleans flavor. Will try sauteing the onions next time based on reviewers' suggestions. Yup, shucking is tough business which is why hubbie does it and not me.

Oysters rockefeller traditionally is made with parsley instead of spinach. Spinach is an acceptable substitute visually, but the flavor is lacking when prepared without fresh parsley.

I thought these were one of the best things I have ever made! Definitely the hit of the dinner. I didn't use watercress (couldn't find any) or fennel seeds. Found some very fresh smallish oysters that were perfect. I made the mixture and shucked the oysters a few hours ahead of time. Mine took about 12 minutes to get bubbly and properly browned on top. I thought the Pernod would be too strong when I was mixing it up, but really was the perfect flavor. Must serve with bread to soak up the sauce when the oyster is gone. I had a lot of mixture left over-It's in the freezer waiting for the next batch of oysters!

Made 1st time pretty much as is; it was good. Made 2nd time, used quite a few suggestions to alter to our taste - definitely appreciate those. Sauteed onion, garlic & spinach. Doubled hot pepper. Subbed Vermouth. Omitted fennel seed. Thought spinach also needed lots of salt & pepper. Will serve w/bread next time for sopping. Came back to get ideas for using leftover mix. Put on bread - duh! Thanks! It's exceptional now that it's tweaked for us.

Wow. This was truly outstanding. I substituted extra spinach for watercress, cut back on the butter, used vermouth instead of pernod (it was what i had on hand). The changes did not seem to affect the outcome -- the only thing I'd do different next time is maybe add a little more hot sauce -- we could not taste hot sauce at all. But on the other hand, it was perfect, so why mess with perfection.

This is our usual Christmas Eve appetizer. I agree with a previous cook, to saute the onions and garlic a bit prior to putting this together. Otherwise you get a little bit of a bitter taste.

Wonderful!. The only changes I made were 1 stick of butter instead of the 1.5 and I used anise seed which I ground instead of the fennel seed. I think it has a more delicate taste than the fennel.

Delicious! We made this on Christmas Eve as part of a gourmet dinner and it was wonderful. We bought the oysters shucked after reading previous reviews - thanks very much as it saved us a bundle of time. The only change I made was to leave out the fennel - the Pernod gave enough anise flavor for me. We needed to leave it in the oven a little longer as well. We'll be spreading the leftover filling on a baguette for New Year's Eve. Yummy.

A winner and very easy. I omitted the watercress and used more spinach; Zambucca instead of Pernod. I think you could cut down the butter a scooch. Will definitely do again!

Delicious and not too heavy considering the ingredients. Used anisette which worked well -- think that the anise-flavored liqueur really makes the recipe. Everyone raved. I will add this to entertaining repertoire. I ordered shucked oysters in advance which really cuts down on the labor. Also served Oysters on the Half Shell with Spicy Vinegar which was a delicious alternative for people who want something lighter.

Added a dollop of sour cream underneath each oyster (see a 1959 version of this recipe on this web site) and omitted the Pernod altogether. Wonderfully vivid green colour and delicious.

Added a small dollop of sour cream underneath the oysters (see other recipe on this site from 1959!) and ommitted the alcohol altogether. It was beautiful -intensely green - and delicious!

Wow! This was the best ever! Definitely a do over. The green stuff rocked and will be put on our toast tomorrow!

I beleive in caramalizing the onion/garlic and wilting the greens in the pan (watercress by the way does not originate in Loiusiana until modern times) is much more authentic of this recipe. And honestly, more cheese. Eat a salad for lunch or something, but don't skimp on the goods. Lowfat w/ 1.5 sticks of butter, Hmmm...

This was incredible! I served as an appetizer at my mother-in-law's birthday party, and guests are still talking about them. Very easy, very elegant and very delicious.

This recipe is a showstopper! We made this for our Christmas open house and it was a huge hit. The only problem is that my boyfriend complained about opening 3 dozen oysters - I made the filling which was easy and the presentation and taste were perfection. I would definitely make these again.

Loved It! I found that the preparation was fairly easy. The end result called for another dozen the following day. Great! (especially our Malpeque Bay Oysters here in Prince Edward Island)

I made a dozen oysters for a dinner party for six and all my guests raved about them! I didn't have Pernod or watercress so I used Galliano and more spinach just as the previous reviewer. I thought they were simple to make. The hardest part was shucking the oysters, which my husband helped me with. The oysters were a treat for our palates - would definitely make this again next week!

We just finished devouring this fantastic version of Oysters Rockefeller. I highly recommend this recipe to anybody who loves Oysters Rockefeller. I did omit the watercress, because it was not available. I substituted Galliano for the Pernod because I had it on hand and I felt it was a very suitable replacement. The hardest thing about this recipe, to me, is going to be going out to eat, ordering Oysters Rockefeller, and comparing them to ones I made at home, and wishing those were the ones I was eating!!!

Excellent and fairly easy to prepare. I omitted th watercress per above.

This recipe was absolutely divine. Served it at a dinner party as an appetizer and 2 doz oysters vanished into thin air! A good amount of prep work but well worth it, especially when entertaining. Probably next time I would omit the watercress - dont think one would miss it.

Everyone at my dinner club raved about the oysters rockefeller and requested the recipe. The only difficult part, according to my husband, was shucking the oysters.
