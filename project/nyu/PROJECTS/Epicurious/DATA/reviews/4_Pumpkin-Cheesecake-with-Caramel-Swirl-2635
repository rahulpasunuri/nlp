great cheesecake! I used my graham cracker crust recipe from another cheesecake. I didn't use the caramel swirl - too much trouble and I like cheesecake standing alone on my plate. I drained the pumpkin like Ellie from Olympia said to do. I never realized pumpkin had so much water in it! The texture of the cheesecake came out exactly like I like it - firm. I don't like soft, cream-like cheesecake. I decorated the topping with orange sprinkles done in a pumpkin shape (I have small -1.5 inch- cookie cutters in fall shapes. Placed that it center and sprinkled orange sugars inside to shape the pumpkin, and green for the stem). It does need something as decoration, though.

I have made this cheesecake several times to excellent reviews. The only problem I have with cheesecakes is cracking even after trying all ingred. at room temp, water baths, and slow cooling. I just slather the sour cream topping and caramel swirls on, though, and it covers a multitude of sins.

I made this for Thanksgiving but made it 3 days ahead so flavors could blend. It was delicious, but for some reason, the crust was somewhat soggy (maybe because I made it ahead?). Even though I wrapped the pan in foil as suggested, the butter from the crust spilled into my oven and my fire alarm went off for 20 minutes! This was a delicious change from pumpkin pie, and I personally liked it much better.

this was such a HIT at my thanksgiving dinner party! the crust is perfect as is, and for the filling i used half regular cream cheese and half 'light', and it still tasted amazing. i skipped the sour cream. i will definitely be making this one again. my husband thought he was in heaven!

Delicious and fairly easy. This cake has just the right amount and depth of pumpkin flavor to make cheesecake un-boring, while being more decadent than simple pumpkin pie. I made this for Thanksgiving AND Christmas dinner and everyone raved. If you do not care for gingersnaps, you can use regular butter piecrust (rolled thin, patted about 1.5" up the sides of the springform pan, and prebaked) or graham cracker/butter crumb crust. Both were very good in my variations. I would not bother with a water bath or slow cooling of the cake because the topping is going to conceal any cracks and there is no taste difference in a cracked vs "perfect" cheesecake.

This was a very good cheesecake recipe and fairly simple as well. I made the following adjustemnts according to personal preferance: I used graham crackers in the crust because the gingersnaps usually end up getting soggy when I have made gingersnap crusts for cheesecakes in the past. I also, doubled the cinnamon, and added some nutmeg to the filling. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Incredible! This was the first cheesecake I ever made & it was not hard at all. I made it for Thanksgiving & everyone loved it. It was gone so fast. Do not hesitate to make this. My daughter in law does not like pumpkin anything & she loved it. Give this a try you won't be disappointed. By the way, the water bath method with foil wrapped around it worked best-no cracking, & after it was finished baking I turned off the oven & opened the door to let it cool for an hour to prevent any sinking -PERFECT!

This is spectacular. I like a firmer cheesecake, and the water in the pumpkin takes away from that. To remove excess water from the pumpkin, line baking sheet with triple layer of paper towels. Spread pumpkin on paper towels in roughly even layer. Cover pumpkin with second triple layer of paper towels and press firmly until paper towels are saturated. Peel back top layer of towels and discard. Grasp bottom towels and fold pumpkin in half; peel back towels. Repeat and flip pumpkin onto baking sheet; discard towel.

This is a light, fluffy cheesecake, and the pumpkin flavor is just right. I used about 1/3 cup of Mrs. Richardson's Butterscotch Caramel Topping instead of 1 tbsp caramel for the swirl, which worked nicely.

I have made this more times than any other single recipe that I can think of, as my father-in-law repeatedly requests it for thanksgiving or Christmas gatherings. Personally I am not a big fan of cheesecakes but this one might just win me over. I have done it with low-fat cream cheese as well as regular, and you really can't tell the difference. I do prefer the caramel on top, as long as it is sparing, but I don't think the sour cream adds much. I have done it with or without a water bath, but probably prefer to use one just as a "good luck" charm, although doing it without has turned out fine too. This was the first cheesecake I ever made, and I think it is pretty hard to go wrong, whatever you do.

People raved about this cheesecake and in the end it turned out wonderfully. I will say, it is the first cheesecake I've ever had crack and then sink, but I think that might be my fault, since I used a water bath when it wasn't called for. I was convinced it would be a disaster, but the topping salvaged it and no one had any idea it wasn't perfect underneath. The taste was wonderful and it came out picture perfect in the end.

this cheesecake is a tradition at my house since 93'. now that the kids are grown the number of cheesecakes for thanksgiving has grown. the only thing that i have added is that i cook the cheesecake in water about 3/4 inch up the springform pan.

I originally made this in 1993 and will make again this year. Great way to serve pumpkin in a non-traditional way. Delicious. Some of my guests were hesitate to experiment but once they tasted it, I knew I had converted them. Not an overpowering pumpin flavor but like Goldilocks said, It's just right!

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe quite few times. I'm very happy with this recipe minus the caramel. There really is no need. I think it detracts from the pumpkin, which already much mellower than traditional pie. I find the key to the good crust is to used glazed pecans. Emerald bags them in a green pouch found at most supermarkets. Glazed pecans adhere much better in the crust mixture while baking. The crust will hold nicely if you don't own a spring pan. Glazed pecan are less likely to burn.

Made a test run for Thanksgiving. It was great! I made a few variations and it didn't ruin it at all! First, I used half low-fat cream cheese and half real cream cheese, and the taste and texture were still great. Also the spices seem forgiving - I used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice (as I didn't have ground allspice), a pinch of cloves, and generous splash of vanilla. When baking, I lowered the position of my oven rack to just below the half way point (my last cheesecake turned out a little too brown on top) and this cheesecake turned out perfect! Also, I wasn't sure whether or not to do a water bath, so I didn't but put put a small dish of water on the shelf underneath. Cooked full 1 hour 15 minutes. Turned out great! No cracks and just the right color on top! It tasted d-licious too!!

I cannot rave enough about this recipe. I had never made cheesecake before and this was my first test. Well, I've made it twice in the last two months and always get jaw dropping results. I make a few adjustments and double the cinnamon for the filling, and add a little ground ginger and a tiny bit of nutmeg as well. Also, I add more sugar and a little vanilla to the cream cheese set aside for the topping - takes the sour edge off and really compliments the filling. Also, you really don't need the sour cream, it's pretty unnecessary. Love love love this recipe!

I love pumpkin but am not a fan of pumpkin pie. This cheesecake will convince everyone who consumes it to forget about missing the traditional pie after the Thanksgiving meal. I had several guests who insisted they don't like cheesecake devouring it and asking for the recipe! Made the recipe exactly as posted minus the sour cream. I didn't feel that would enhance it in appearance or taste (or calories!). Did garnish with some delicious candied pecans sold at Trader Joe's.

Wow!! This is it. Search no more. I made these as little mini cheesecakes in mini cheesecake pans -I have both Williams-Sonoma and Chicago Metallic, but I like Williams-Sonoma better. Everyone raved. I baked the crust first for 10 minutes. Then put 1 tsp caramel sauce on top of the cooled crust, then poured cheesecake batter over the crust and caramel. Baked mini's at 325 for 30 minutes. After they refridgerated and cooled, I added the cream cheese topping and caramel swirl. Makes a beautiful presentation, are delicious, and they freeze beautifully.

I have made it many times over the years to the delight of guests and have even given the whole cheesecake as a gift before and I have received rave reviews each and every time!

I love seasonal baking and this is, by far, my favorite holiday dessert. It was such a huge hit with my family and friends last year that they have been pestering me for months to make it again! I was apprehensive about the crust recipe since I do not like ginger snaps, but it was the perfect compliment to the cheesecake. Also, in response to a comment below, the cheesecake does drop in the center during baking. Once it cools I just press the outside corners down to even out the height. Hope that helps!

Delicious! I actually wasn't the baker of this cheesecake--my mom tested it for a bridal shower we're having. I've been "testing" it all day & can't seem to help myself. She didn't even put caramel on it this time, but it's something about the texture & flavors of the creamy sweet cake against the spicy & crunchy crust--yum! I know she baked it 10 minutes longer than suggested. It's a keeper, & I think I'll make it for Thanksgiving too.

I did made a few recipe modifications. I didn't put any creamcheese aside for topping and added a few tablespoons more of pumpkin puree. I also added a 1/2 tsp ground ginger and about 3/4 tbsp pumpkin pie spice. I subbed graham crackers for the crust and added ground ginger. The cheesecake was absolutely wonderful! It's lighter than a NY cheesecake and more interesting than regular pumpkin pie. Completely delicious. I will definitely make this again.

This is an excellent recipe. The crust is a nice counterbalance to the sweet, creamy cheesecake. I added the 3T of flour as suggested and I used Stonewall Kitchens Spiced Rum Butterscotch sauce instead of the caramel. Not to be nitpicky, but the center dropped slightly - about a quarter of an inch. Any suggestions on how to prevent this? I thought that I may have built up the crust so much - almost to the top of the pan - that the sides of the cheesecake grabbed too much.

This is the first cheesecake I've made and it was a huge success (it was the only dessert to disappear after a huge Thanksgiving dinner). I made a couple of changes; One...I used a 10" springform pan (it was the perfect size, no leftover batter) & TWO...I added 2 Tbls finely chopped crytallized ginger to the crust. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the T (NO flour needed - it turned out real rich & creamy... just the way we like it). Don't skip the topping or the caramel either as it looks beautiful and tastes even better. I read the review that said store bought caramel isn't as good as homemade so I made Ina Garten's caramel recipe & I had some "Mrs Richardsons" caramel on hand; taste test side by side, almost no difference. I also followed the advice to pipe the caramel on by filling a small ziplock baggie & cutting the corner off (super easy, no mess!). I've already been asked to make this cheesecake again for Christmas. This recipe is a definite keeper!

A delicious change from pumpkin pie! I cooked it for 20 more minutes than called for and it was still jiggly, but upon cooling it set up very nicely! Makes a HUGE cake - I could have used a larger pan. I think next time I will cut the recipe in half and use a smaller pan. I still have almost 1/2 left! But everyone loved it!

This is a great cheesecake. I have made it exactly as the recipe calls and I have made it adding a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice (I prefer it spiced up a little more). I did not use flour and did not find it necessary but to the reviewer who inquired about using cornstarch instead, I would say go for it. If you look up the recipe for the Strawberry-coconut cheesecake, that one calls for 3 tblsp. of cornstarch. I have also made that one and it has a great texture (not too moussey and not too dense).

I love this recipe. I didn't change a thing except I left off the sour cream topping and used whipped cream instead. It was delicious. It was quite jiggly when I removed it from the oven, but it set up really well. I didn't need to add any flour like some other reviewers have suggested. Will make this one again and again. It's perfect for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Yum! I do not even like cheesecake or pumpkin desserts, but this is delicious! I made this for a friend's 30th Bday- it's her favorite dessert. I made it exactly as stated except I decided to omit the sour cream garnish. I did not add extra flour and the cheesecake set up nicely- much firmer than I was expecting from the rest of the reviews. One thing I did notice was that even though I cooked it at the recommended time and temp (no water bath) it was VERY jiggly. I was worried but as it cooked it firmed up very nicely. The crust is delicious. *I will add that I have not taste the finished product (w/ the extra cream cheese and caramel top) just the cheesecake itself.

Delicious. I make a lot of cheesecakes and this one is one of the best I've ever made, a real winner. I used 3 T flour as others had mentioned - thank you for that tip - I think it's essential. I have a tree nut alergy in the family so I made a crust of 3 cups Annas ginger cookies, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter and 2 T crystallized ginger.

I can't believe I'm making this one again, but my husband and his friend's insist. I normally make this for Thanksgiving then started it up again for his birthday in Feburary (at his demand). Now I have been requested to make it for New Years Eve. My husband is Argentine, so I sub Dulce De Leche in place of the caramel sauce which is probably why its so popular with his crowd. This is an exceptional cheesecake for sure. Anyone who has tasted it at Thanksgiving or for my husband's birthday has remembered it. "You're the one who makes that fabulous cheesecake, would you make one for my birthday?" I am capable of making other cheesecakes and desserts, but this one is unforgetable.

I have made this twice in the last six weeks (once for Thanksgiving and once for Christmas) and it was much admired both times, but I liked it much better on one occasion than the other because of a key modification. One time I made it with the 2-4 Tbs of flour other reviewers have mentioned and once I made it without, and I would strongly, strongly recommend including the flour. I think I actually used close to 4 Tbs. The time I didn't include the flour, the cheesecake was too soft, even when I left it in the oven for an additional 30 minutes--it held up to slicing, but it was more like a mousse or pumpkin silk pie than the New York-style cheesecake that I like. I baked in a water bath both times, which seemed to ensure even baking. Other than that (flour and the water bath) I made it according to the recipe. I used Whole Foods Whole Treat caramel sauce one time, which was perfect, and Hersheys brand caramel sauce the other, which was thinner in consistency and not as good.

Incredible! I had to make this gluten-free for Celiacs and it was the perfect cheesecake. I substituted gluten- free gingersnaps from Whole Foods and they worked perfectly. I stressed about adding two tablespoons of flour substitute because of the suggestions, but as long as you cook the cake a little longer (15 min more) it sets up nicely to a perfectly creamy but not too soft cheesecake. I did put a water bath on the bottom rack so it didn't crack and I didn't take it out of the oven until the center was almost set. Everyone wanted the recipe.

I have made this recipe many times with lots of variations, for lots of guests and have always gotten a wow! It is just a great recipe. Most recently I needed more servings so I did not subtract the cream cheese for the topping and used a 10" springform pan. I increased the pumpkin by using a whole can, (16oz), and added 1 additional tsp. of Cinnamon and 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. Then for the topping I blended 16 oz of cream cheese, 2/3 cup sugar and 1/4 cup whipping cream. Then of course the caramel (which I make myself and normally have on hand.) It served between 16-20 generous servings! Great dessert for this time of year-Happy Thanksgiving!!

If you love pralines than you'll absolutely LOVE this dish, I however am not a huge praline fan, it was a bit too rich in combination with the richness of the cheescake itself. My company at Thanksgiving however LOVED every bite of it. I would make it again, only I'd use a graham crust.

I have been making this recipe since it first came out in 1993 and have been making it ever since. The only two things I have changed is I put the caramel on the bottom on top of the crust after it has been cooked and cooled. I also use the pumpkin pie filling and add more cinnamon and nutmeg. Love this recipe. Happy Baking

Delicious and easy. This was my first cheesecake. It was very moist and was not overpowered by the pumpkin. Perfect for Christmas or Thanksgiving. Cooked according to directions except made 25% more of the crust as suggested. Carmel swirls ended up all over the top, so will definitely try adding the pecans or cinnamon as a garnish next time.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was such a hit that I had to make it again for our family Christmas party. So easy and delicious. Definitely make the gingersnap crust. To dress the white top up a bit, sprinkle a dusting of cinnamon or nutmeg through a doiley on the top. One caution with this cake - it does not travel perfectly - the caramel and cream cheese topping run together when jostled. Definitely make this at home however!

I have been making this for five years. Except for the time I used pumpkin pie filling instead of canned pumpkin, it has always been a hit! I never used the sour cream topping, just the caramel on the cream cheese. It looks very pretty swirled, like a professional dessert! The only thing is to do it right before serving because the caramel can bleed into the cream cheese. This recipe is always a hit!

This was a total HIT at Thanksgiving and i was asked to make it again for Christmas too. I accidently added all of the whipping cream at once, and it turned out just fine. I think I will do that again as it could be too dry without it. DELICIOUS!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and felt bad that I outdid my Mom's traditional pumpkin pies. It was so beautiful and tasted even better. I accidently added too much pumpkin (used the whole can instead of one cup) and I think I'm always going to make it like that. Everyone loved it. It was light and tasty. I didn't worry about the bath, because you cover the top anyway. And I used the caramel you buy for dipping apples (because that's what I had in the fridge) and that worked fine. This is a fairly easy dessert to make and, a definite crowd pleaser.

After everyone raved about it at Thanksgiving, I went home right away and made one for work. Everyone loved the crust. I made a few changes including using fat-free cream cheese and sprinkling cinnamon over the top instead of the caramel sauce. This recipe has increased my confidence in my baking skills. I will, without a doubt, make this recipe again.

Loved this recipe! I made my own caramel sauce, and plated the servings with a little more of the sauce. People raved about the crust...and the presentation. Fabulous recipe - makes a big, big cheesecake. Great for a crowd.

This was a huge hit on Thanksgiving!! Some minor changes I made: baked in a water bath (no cracks!), added 1 tbsp flour to the filling, graham crust, no sour cream. Added vanilla and cinnamon to cream cheese topping. Wrapping the springform in foil for the waterbath was a bit of a hassle, though, and still a little water managed to leak into the crust. No biggie. Maybe next time will put a pan filled with water on the rack below the cake. Absolutely scrumptious!! Will become a Thanksgiving staple in my home.

Rating: 4
Best dessert at a very competitive thanksgiving. Used equal amounts of maple sugar cookies and gingersnaps from wholefoods (in little bags - shaped like acorns and leaves)for the crust. Kept the crust only on the bottom, not up sides. Used fresh pumpkin(sugar pumpkins) and think that was the key to the delicate flavor. Did not add flour as suggested, but did use water bath and cooled it in the oven. Was incredibly creamy, rich and will make it every chance I get.

This was my very first attempt at making a cheesecake, and I have to say it was a thanksgiving hit! I actually exclamed with glee when placing the cheesecake on a serving tray.

By the way, I just finished making my second one in as many as three days.

I agree with you. For me, this lacked the WOW factor. For as much work as it was, I was disappointed even though the family enjoyed it. Made the mistake of using caramel sundae topping instead of caramel sauce. It was ok, but next time I would use the real thing.

Prepared Thanksgiving dinner for 3, therefore I planned for one fabulous dessert only. This was good, but missed the "WOW" factor for me. Was looking forward to a dense, NY-style cheesecake, but in hind site should have known that it wouldn't be due to the addition of the pumpkin. It was a spectacular presentation though with my caramel swirl of hearts made by dropping random drops of caramel, then dragging a wooden skewer through the middle of each one. Skipped the sour cream altogether.

Delicious! As previous reviewers suggested, baked it at 325 for 90 minutes in a very shallow water bath, cooled in the oven with the door open for 20 minutes, and there were no cracks in the cheesecake. The cream cheese topping was yummy and looked nice with the caramel swirl.

To last reviewer: Depends on the size of the cookie. You just have to grind until you have enough! Standard 3" gingersnaps from a box: about 20-25. The boxed ones work great because they're SO hard.

Excellent and quite easy! I accidentally used all 9T cream in the filling and it still turned out! I wouldn't bother with the traditional water bath since you're just covering it with some gorgeous toppings. Put a pretty carmel swirl and piped the sour cream on edges. A sprinkling of cinnamon and this looked great! This is a subtle, yet yummy dessert.

By far the best pumpkin cheesecake I have ever tasted. Definitely worth the time & effort.

A quick tip: The water bath is really intended to keep the top from splitting. Try placing a large sheet cake pan on the lower rack in the oven and fill half way with water. No more messing around with the foil and risk having soggy crust! Made this last year for Thanksgiving and was told that we no longer need to make pumpkin pie. Not only yummy, but makes a beautiful presentation.

Very quick and easy to put together. It's a "destination" dessert. I think it needs to have it's own event. Everyone was too full after Thanksgiving dinner to give it it's full ovation. Decadent and sublime. I also added flour to the pumpkin mixture. Crust is fantastic!. did not use a waterbath; there were cracks but these were covered by the cream cheese icing.

this was great as others said, but I don't think the sour cream added much and would skip it next time. Also, I heated the caramel up to make it easier to work with, and next time I will just use the caramel to decorate the outer edge since I think it tastes great with the cheesecake.

I can't believe that it was 11 years ago that a co-worker brought this scrumptious cheesecake to work after receiving the November 1993 edition of Bon Appetit. She gave me the recipe and I have made this cheesecake for special holiday dinners and gift-giving almost every year since.

Made two of these recently for Thanksgiving to rave reviews, even with people who did not like pumpkin.

A few notes on this recipe: -blend the topping the night of the recipe not the next day, the cream cheese takes long to soften, you get a smoother topping if you do it that evening -bake the cheesecake on a rack on a cookie sheet with sides, since it drips -sour cream addition is not really needed Really delicious recipe, its a crowd favorite

Rating: 4
This recipe is fabulous. I've made it twice in two weeks! The crust takes some time (try using chopped toasted pecans from Trader Joe's) but is worth it. Also, definitely use a water bath and bake for about 90 minutes. Then, you won't get the raised edges and there will be minimal cracks. Also, I skipped the caramel and the sour cream, because the cake is already very flavorful and the cream cheese topping makes it quite pretty.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! The crust is amazing! As recommended by other reviewers....I added 1Tbs flour, used fresh pumpkin and lite cream cheese....baked it in a water bath. It worked really well. Even my husband, who is not a big fan of pumpkin, loved this recipe. This not a "quick and easy" recipe... but it is well worth the effort! Be careful who you share this with..... you will be expected to make it again and again.

Following the numerous recommendations, I added the 2 tbsp flour. I think that one may have been enough. Two made it a little too dry for my taste. I also wasn't too fond of the topping, but I still think it is necessary for presentation.

I have made this cheescake for the last three Thanksgivings and it is always hit. I didn't make any changes to the recipe but I did bake the cheescake in a water bath (yes, you need the extra wide foil to prevent seepage into the crust)and baked for about an hour and 30 minutes and then left it overnight in the oven with the door ajar, no cracks!! Next time I make it I may try the addition of flour.

This is as great as everyone says. Rave reviews at Thanksgiving. Looks great too. Trader Joe's Ginger Snaps are the Best. I also use their roasted pecan pieces too. Crust was fabulous.

I really enjoyed the crust, very nutty. The cheesecake baked nicely, it browned and didn't crack. The plain cream cheese mixture for topping is a nice touch. The filling was smooth and light, but I might prefer more pumpkin flavor and/or more spice in the filling. I don't think the caramel did much for the cheesecake. What I would really like to find is a recipe for a pumpkin cheesecake with pecan pie filling for the bottom layer. Overall, very good, but not spectacular.

A dish that is tantelizing to the tounge. Amazing flavor and yet so easy to make. Slow cooking is key on this dessert. Never put on the sour cream. Seems a bit odd. Perhaps next time will try the sour cream.

I agree with the last reviewer regarding adding a little flour - all "new york" cheesecakes seem to. Someone mentioned water leakage into crust. Here is a solution. Do check that the base and walls seem snug first (sorry), then always use two sheets of thick foil. It is best to place them flat on top of each other at 45 degrees , and get rid of wrinkles and pockets. Place unfilled pan on top and smooth foil up sides of pan tightly. Fold top edges over and try to press into pan with as little space between foil and pan ( to avoid steam getting in between) and avoid excess bulk (ditto). When I follow these rules, I never have soggy crusts. Hope it helps.

Well, I do not usualy rate recipes as it always seems that everyone else has pretty much covered things. But I had to write to say that I completely messed up this recipe and failed to take out the 3/4 cup of cream cheese mixture for the topping...doing too many things at the same time...I loved the end result anyway although it seemed a little "loose"'. Next time I did it the same way and after extensive searching for other p/kin chzcake recipes on epicurious and elsewhere I added 2 tablespoons of flour,the end result was a lovely silky smooth cheesecake. I also used a water bath and increased time to 1 and a half hours, lovely golden color, no cracks. Instead of sour cream topping I made a pecan praline and crumbled it on top. So many people asked for recipe that I ahve made 12 this Thanksgiving and sold them!!!

Made this for a dinner party. I modified this recipe quite a bit. First, for the crust: I used gingersnaps from Trader Joe's (saw this in another review - great suggestion!)and used at least two cups. Instead of toasted pecans, I used candied pecans also from Trader Joes. For the filling: I used probably two cups of pumpkin and added more spices such as: 1 tsp fresh ground nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of cloves. I skipped the whole caramel topping, but did use some sour cream to top it with some decorations I piped on. I also baked it in a water bath, which they don't mention here. Very important to keep refrigerated until about a hour before serving. Unfortunately, the hostess left it out the whole dinner and I felt it got a little too soft. But, still was very good texture and taste. I particularly loved the crust!

Rating: 4
p.s.; also used fresh pumpkin--never did that before and wasn't sure how to handle it. After removing the seeds and skinning it, I pureed it in a blender and used the same amount called for. A recipe this decadent called out for a real pumpkin from the farmers' market.

Rating: 4
One of the best things I've ever eaten. Got so many complements on this cake, it was almost embarrassing. Used very spicy gingersnaps, neuschatel cream cheese, and added 1 tsp. allspice, ginger, and nutmeg. I've made some killer desserts before, but this one blows the rest away. Totally awesome!

Run - don't walk - to your nearest kitchen the next time you want something special for a holiday or fall treat!! Four forks plus plus! I made this for a family (Canadian) Thanksgiving dinner and EVERYONE raved! And it was so easy, even though I've never made a cheesecake before. The crust is absolutely to die for, and based on other reviews I made double, but next time one-and-a-half times the amount called for would be about perfect. Make this for friends or family and you are guaranteed a winning reputation in the kitchen! I can't say enough about this!!!

Wow! This was incredible... however I did doctor it quite a bit. First w/ the crust, added flour, and baked 10 minutes. For filling used the whole can of pumpkin w/ one more egg, and 2 Tbsp. sour cream for smoothness. Cooked in water bath. For topping: whipped cream and sour cream and bourbon and brown sugar. (I cut the cake ahead, and then put the topping on... very pretty that way and easy to self-serve). Then I drizzeled the whole thing w/ about 1/2 cup of home made caramel topping. It was so decadent.. my husband said I shoudn't put it out, because I was putting other desserts to shame.

This cheesecake was fabulous! All the odds were against my sister (a chef) and I: we forgot the springform pan, I had to use my old scorching gas oven, but it still turned out creamy, rich, and was gobbled up by all at the Thanksgiving dinner. We left off the sour cream piping and caramel, and it was still heavenly. I'm making it again in 2 weeks for a party!

To the previous cook: Just add the whipping cream just like it was milk. The water bath is a standard instruction with cheescakes and isn't as bad as it sounds. Just stick the pan in a bigger pan (like those foil ones that turkeys cook in) and put the water around it! Good luck!

Well, I made this cheesecake for the first time and it was a big hit. I followed the suggestion to double the crust recipe and also wrap the springform pan in aluminum foil and then bake it in a water bath. No cracks in the cheesecake! I omitted the sour cream border because I ran out of time, but no one seemed to mind. I'll definitely make it again.

I've made this cheesecake every year for four years--the friends that host my yearly Thanksgiving soiree do not allow me entry until they see (with their own eyes) that I've brought it. The first time, I made the crust called for in the recipe. I wasn't a big fan, so I devised my own: a shortbread crust. I think that is when it became an indispensable tradition. I simply buy shortbread sandies and crush them in a bag with a rolling pin, add a half stick of melted butter, toss, and press into the pan. TO DIE FOR! ***Make this cheesecake....it's EASY, and people will think you're a GENIUS!!!!***

Here's the topping information, which is given in the "For Filling" section of the recipe: "Transfer 3/4 cup (cream cheese) mixture to small bowl; cover tightly and refrigerate to use for topping. "Cool. Cover tightly and refrigerate overnight. Bring remaining 3/4 cup cream cheese mixture to room temperature. Add remaining 5 tablespoons whipping cream to cream cheese mixture and stir to combine. Press down firmly on edges of cheesecake to even thickness. Pour cream cheese mixture over cheesecake, spreading evenly. Spoon caramel sauce in lines over cream cheese mixture. Using tip of knife, swirl caramel sauce into cream cheese mixture. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.)" Cheers! :)

This cheesecake has a very light and creamy texture, although the taste is rich. The crust is wonderful, I used Trader Joe's gingersnaps which have tiny bits of crystallized giner.

Yum! Yum! This cheesekcake has double appeal: people who don't like pumpkin pie often eat this right up, while pumpkin lovers really enjoy it too. To the previous cook concerned about water baths: the water bath is a cinch, just make sure you tightly wrap your pan in foil. However, if you have a convection option on your oven, you can get away with skipping the bath. Both ways help the cake to cook more evenly; it will still puff up and then drop; that's normal. The great thing about this cake is that you put a topping on and the cracks don't show! Good luck and enjoy!

I am going to make this recipe for the first time on Monday. I'm not really an experienced baker- does the whipping cream have to be whipped?

This cheesecake is AMAZING! It's rich, yet not too sweet and melts in your mouth. Everyone is asking me for the recipe.

After shelling out $15 for a small Harry & David frozen cheesecake at Thanksgiving, I figured there must be a 'fresh' option. I made two cheesecakes, a day apart. I thought the taste was okay, but guests raved and asked for the recipe. I did follow recommendations to skip the listed topping, and used the one from the earlier recipe (2 cups sour cream, 4 Tbls whipping cream, brandy, something like this, spread on top and cook last five minutes--see review a few lines down). Was easy and made for a nicer presentation than the plain with nuts. For some reason this took almost two hours to cook in my oven (new, GE, high end). Not a convection though, perhaps that was an issue.

I usually combine elements of this recipe with elements of another in the database...the Pumpkin Cheesecake with Bourbon Sour Cream Topping from Gourmet in 1990. I'm gluten intolerant though, so I use a crust made from toasted unsweetened coconut, finely crushed toasted pecans, brown sugar & honey, a bit of rice flour and either xanthan or guar gum, and butter (the recipe's available via e-mail if anyone wants it). I also substitute dark rum for the bourbon. This has been a HUGE hit all 4 times I've made it and is now a holiday regular!

This cheesecake was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. My brother insisted we make the traditional pumpkin pie as well, but nearly everyone raved about this dessert.

Question, with the water bath and a springform, how do you keep the water from leaking in? I tried aluminum foil but it still manages to leak in. I have a 9 3/4 inch pan and I have to use two pieces of foil to cover it. Any suggestions? I made this cheesecake once already but it took a long time to cook and cracked a lot,fortunately, the topping covered it up.

This was a big hit! Figures that when I went to the grocery store 2 days before Thanksgiving they were out of gingersnaps. I improvised and used half graham crackers and half ginger molasses cookies. The crust had rave reviews!

Rating: 4
Simply put- this is amazing!! So creamy and wonderful taste and texture. The only change that I made was to use crushed oatmeal cookies instead of gingersnaps for the crust. (What I had on hand). The topping turned out wonderful for me- just as written. Cannot wait to make again!

WOW!!! The best cheesecake recipe I have ever tried! It's so creamy, with just enough pumpkin flavor. The caramel swirl topping is beautiful, and really adds to the flavor. I disagree with the previous reviewers...the whipping cream added to the topping mixture is exactly right! Easily spreadable, and not too runny. This will be one of my standards...we may never have pumpkin pie again!

Rating: 3
Market didn't have gingersnaps so I settled for the standard graham cracker crust. It was still delicious with a creamy consistency, perfect balance of cheese and pumpkin, and it looked lovely. I made my own caramel sauce which was thick enough to create a beautiful swirl pattern on top, with enough to serve on the side. "Joy of Cooking" has a great recipe called "Caramel Sauce Cockaigne" that includes sugar, water, butter, heavy cream and vanilla. Not much cheesecake or caramel sauce left over from this years' Thanksgiving dinner!

Rating: 4
I added 1/2 cup more cream cheese to the 3/4 cup of cream cheese mixture reserved for the topping. I agree with other reviewers that 5 tablespoons of whipping cream would make the topping too runny. Just slowly add whipping cream a tablespoon at a time until you have a nice spreading consistency. The first time I made the cake I drizzled the caramel and it just ran into puddles instead of looking nice so I did not use it the second time. The dessert is rich enough to not need the additional caramel or sour cream toppings. I also baked it at 350 the first time and the ginger snap crust burned slightly. The second time I baked it at 325 and it needed about 10 additional minutes for the center to set but the crust was just right.

To the cook from Portsmouth: I'm not sure what the technical difference is for using light vs. dark brown sugar, I usually just use what I have on hand and everything seems to turn out fine! Smuckers makes a decent caramel, and honestly you don't really taste it in this recipe, it's mostly for presentation. I look forward to Thanksgiving every year just so I have an excuse to make this!

These reviews have convinced me to make this tonight! I have a really simple question, which I have for most recipes using brown sugar. When should I use dark vs. light brown sugar? Also, can someone recommend a caramel sauce brand? Thanks! Happy eating!

I can't believe I'm writing a review of something I've never tasted-- I personally don't like pumpkin, so I didn't even sample it. But the rave reviews of my entire family has made this recipe the one "must have" at Thanksgiving. I make all kinds of cheesecakes, but this one is great because it has a wonderful presentation and it so easy to make! I highly recommend it-- well, actually, my family does!

Excellent dessert. Definitely double (or slightly less than double) the crust and use half graham cracker and half gingersnaps.

I have made this recipe no less than 10 times-both for family and as a 'prize' for several of our work get togethers. I don't use a mixer, instead use my food processor. I don't do the sour cream. Instead, toast some whole pecans, dip in carmel and cool in fridge. Place these around outside edge of cheesecake.

This is a great recipe! I even mixed it wrong and it got rave reviews anyway. I made two of them for a church gathering, and as soon as they hit the table they were GONE! Lucky thing I cut them and put them there, or I wouldn't have even been able to get a taste! I am planning to make them again (except I'm making them for at home where I can have some, too) for Christmas. I will make this often. I think it is a great alternative to pumpkin pie. I did, however, add 1/2 teaspoon of mace to the spices.

Very, very good. I'm not a huge pumpkin fan or a huge cheesecake fan, but I liked this. And the pumpkin pie lovers, loved it. It was very easy to make, and the crust was fabulous!! I line the bottom of the springform pan w/ foil and folded the overhanging foil up around the sides of the pan. I had no problem w/ butter seepage. I also cooked at 325 for about 1hour and 20 min. I cooled it in the oven w/ the door propped open, and it didn't crack! Yea! I accidentally used all the whipping cream to make cinnamon whipped cream to serve w/ the cheesecake and didn't have any leftover for the topping. So, I heated the cream cheese mixture in the microwave for about a minute so it was spreadable like icing. I then added the caramel sauce (Smucker's) and swirled. It worked perfect. I served w/ the cinnamon whipped cream and drizzled caramel sauce over the entire plate. Yum!

Perfect do-ahead recipe for a party. I made this 3 days before the party (baked Wednesday, party Saturday). Just wrapped it tightly with plastic about 5 times. I ate 3 Nabisco gingersnaps on the way home from the grocery store and decided they were way too spicy, so I used half gingersnaps, half graham crackers, got lots of compliments on the crust alone. Awesome recipe.

I have made this cheesecake as my main Thanksgiving dessert for seven years. It has never been anything less than wonderful. The gingersnap crust is a great accent, but during my years in Africa when gingersnaps were tough to come by, graham cracker crumbs with some spice worked just fine. I look forward to this every year!

Not that this dessert needs any more postive reviews, but I just couldn't resist adding another. I'm planning my Thanksgiving menu today and the first thing on it is this cake!! Even my mom, who likes neither cheescake nor pumpkin pie, loves this. I'm also on the "more spice is better" bandwagon, but usually go with the amounts specified when making it for a group whose tastes aren't as adventuresome and it is still delicious! Make it and enjoy it!!

I am actually making this cheesecake for the fourth time. I first made it last year @ Thanksgiving and it has become for my friends my signature holiday dessert. I had no problem with either the topping, Caramel Swirl, or the sour cream design around the edges. I also upped the spices a bit, but I like spicy pumpkin. I make my own gingersnaps again, because I can adjust the spice to one that I like, which is always heavier than pre-made anything. I will continue to make this recipe for years.

I've been making this for years, to great reviews. I put up with the top cracking, pressing it down and covering (hiding) it with the topping. I finally baked it in a waterbath (60 minutes at 325 in convection) and it came out perfect: no puffing and cracking, and wonderful texture/mouthfeel. I note that other reviewers have mentioned the waterbath, and it's worth the trouble. Also, increase the crust ingredients by about 1/3 to completely cover the springform pan to a workable thickness. This cheesecake rocks! Second note: don't give up on the waterbath to get a creamy, New York-style texture. For folks like Monica-San Diego who have difficulty finding gingersnaps, send me an e-mail. Bon Appetit had a great recipe in August 89 that I always use - alas, not in this database. Just don't eat all the dough!

Yummy! I will make this again. I read other peoples comments and I agree on them - I reduced temp to 325 for 1 hour 15 minutes and it was perfect. I added more spices, about a half teaspoon of each - could have even gone with more. The only problem I had was with the caramel swirl. Either the cream cheese topping mixture was to thin (maybe less whipping cream?) or the caramel was too thin (I bought a jar of Richardson's). Whatever it was the caramel ran and was not so attractive. I thought if I waited until the last minute it would be better, and I kept the cake and the caramel refridgerated until I served it, but it still ran and was not pretty. If this happens to you my solution is to take a rubber spatula and swirl/mix the caramel and topping together. It then becomes less subtle that there is caramel. I didn't use the sour cream design either, I think it would have looked worse. I was hoping to make a pretty caramel design, but it still looked pretty good. It tasted amazing! Way better than pumpkin pie.

This was a big hit at a recent dinner party. Did not use the topping. Instead I decorated with chocolate & butterscotch painted leaves, and served with a swirl of carmel on the plate. tried the waterbath and the reduced temperture-did not work for me. Even my fanatic cheesecake friend said it was the best she ever had. Go easy on the pumpkin, otherwise you will have a creamy pumpkin pie. The gingersnaps were hard to find--but keep looking they are worth the trouble. Can't wait to make this again!

I received great compliments this past canadian thanksgiving ('02)! I am sooo going to make this a tradition with every dinner I go to. The only suggestion I would make would be changing the temperature from 350F to 325F and using a heavy caramel sauce(so it sinks better into the topping). Thanx!

This is the best cheesecake I have ever made! The texture was perfect and was the perfect height. The gingersnap crust went great with the pumpkin flavor. Didn't have Allspice so I used pumpkin pie spice and it tasted really good. Also, drizzled chocolate over top instead of caramel and it looked really cool.

This cheesecake had everyone swooning! I served it at a birthday dinner in Sycamore, Illinois----home of the annual "Pumpkin Festival". I used caramel topping that came in single serving packets,---I think the brand was "Mrs. Richardson's". It made the caramel topping even easier---no messy spoon, just clip a corner and squeeze! :)

Unfortunately, I burnt the first cheesecake. I'm not sure if it was the fact that my oven temp is off or not. After running to the 7-11 on Thanksgiving eve to get more pumpkin and cream cheese and reducing the oven temp by 25 degrees, this came out perfect. The compliments I received from my dinner guests were never ending. This will be made for Thanksgiving '02 as well.

I've been dying to try this recipe. I made this cheesecake last night for dessert. 1) The crust absolutely rocks I used macadamia nuts over the pecans though. 2) Was very creamy and delicious I didn't have allspice so I doubled the cinnamon. Encourage others to try this cheesecake!

This is a wonderful cheesecake, and an EASY recipe. I made it for a Christmas Party last week-end, and it was devoured! I'm already being hounded for the recipe by the party guests. I added a bit more spice to the cream cheese base, and also added a bit of the pumpkin and a teaspoon of powdered sugar to the cream-cheese topping. Make an elegant swirl with the carmel topping and serve with a wonderful dessert wine. Fabulous!

My husband's family adores pumpkin pie, and my family doesn't. This proved to be an INCREDIBLE compromise for everyone at the table. I first made this recipe in 1999 for my side of the family and received rave reviews. This year, I made it for my husband's family, and received more praise. Our four-year old niece, Lauren, says, "it's the goodest." And, now a Thanksgiving tradition!

Absolutely outstanding. The best cheesecake I have ever made. The leftovers were fought over by the guests! I didnt do the sour cream thing, it wasnt necessary, and actually I didnt have gingersnaps so I used chocolate teddy grahams! In a pinch they turned out great. Id like to see what I missed by not using the gingersnaps so Ill try that next time.However, the chocolate crust was really good!! This was simple, beautiful and delicious, it doesnt get better than that! Id give it 5 forks if I could! - Also - I baked it in a water bath and it was flawless. Just put the finished but not cooked cheesecake into a large baking dish and fill the dish up with warm water half way up the springform pan. Then bake as directed. No mess in your oven - and a perfect cheesecake!

I would use more spice in this cheesecake and reproportion the pumpkin and the cream cheese to have more pumpkin. My guests and my family at Thanksgiving really loved this one! I usually make the traditional pies as well as a cheesecake and something chocolate. This year, I made this cheesecake and no traditional pumpkin...no one missed the pie!

For Thanksgiving, I was asked to bring pumpkin pie. So, I brought one (store bought - for shame) pie & then I made this cheesecake. WHAT A HIT! Even my parents were impressed. :) Here's a cheesecake tip: to avoid the butter dripping, put the springform pan on a cookie sheet. Problem is, the butter will continue to leak, even after you remove it from the oven. I sat mine on paper towels all the time, except when it was being served. A doily would work, too.

I have made this cheesecake every year since it first appeared in Bon Appetit. It has always received rave reviews and I have given the recipe out to many friends (who have also added it to their Thanksgiving menu every year). I suggest to cover the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil before baking. It stops all the butter from dripping out and causing smoke in the oven. Also I only put the crust on the bottom of the pan (not up the sides). I have found that it is hard to cut the crust at the point where it curves from the bottom up the sides. It gets very hard-- almost caramelized (but it still tastes delicious). I have mine baking in the oven right now for Thanksgiving!

This recipe is such a hit that I have made it every single year since it first appeared in Bon Appetit (1993, I think). My family claims it isn't really Thanksgiving unless I make this cake. And my husband, who generally hates both cheesecake and pumpkin, gobbles it up. Go figure...

I made this recipe for my first Thanksgiving with my family in law and they really loved it. I really like pumpkin so I substituted 1 8 oz of regular cream cheese with pumpkin whipped cream cheese (from Einstein bagels, but I'm sure other places have it) and I used 8 oz of whipped cream cheese in place of another regular cream cheese. It made the filling a bit lighter I thought.

I have made this cheesecake to "guest" at many holiday feasts. I have made a couple of alterations that seem to take this from good to WOW! For a deeper taste, I substitute  cup of baked yam (pureed) for  cup of the pumpkin and use brown sugar for part of the 1 2/3 cup sugar. I also add one tsp of vanilla paste and  tsp ginger to the filling. I prefer the contrast of 1 cup sour cream, 1 Tbsp sugar, and 1-2 Tbsp of bourbon with a little finely grated orange rind as a baked topping (the last 5 minutes of baking time). Generously drizzle caramel topping over the top of the cake. I know, I know, it is almost a completely new recipe. Nevertheless, I have yet to bring home any leftover dessert!

Delicious! I lightened this up by using 3 lowfat cream cheese and 1 nonfat. Still fabulous and very rich. Our carmel topping didn't chill as well (maybe because it was lower fat), but no one minded and rather enjoyed a lighter dessert after Thanksgiving dinner.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I used canned pumpkin (according to the label there was no sugar added). I didn't like the too-sweet, dense, dark, gooey result and wrote a 1 fork review here. I decided to try it again with fresh pumpkin and it came out great.

Made this for Thanksgiving last year and upon popular request, again this year. But this year I make a few "secret" substitutions. Because I am a diabetic, I used low-fat cream cheese and instead of sugar, I used "Splenda", a sugar substitute (see Splenda.com)that will hold up under cooking/baking and virtually tastes like sugar. I also used it in the sour cream topping. NO ONE NOTICED! However, it is necessary to use the brown sugar in the crust. So everyone enjoyed it and I literally got to have my cake and eat it too. I also have some advice on baking it. Cover springform pan with aluminum foil and place in a baking pan with hot water about 1/2-way up the sides (better known as a bain marie or water bath). When cheesecake is done, remove from water bath, but place back in the oven, turn the heat off, and crack the oven door and let cheesecake cool in the oven. You will not have a problem with grease dripping, your cheesecake will not sink in the middle and will not crack, and will be creamier in texture. But be sure not to overcook.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2000 - and will probably make again. However, I will reduce the amount of butter in the crust - as the cake baked, the butter melted out of the springform pan and pooled in the bottom of the oven and created lots of smoke! Had to clean the oven before using again. Also, mixing 5 TBSP of whipping cream into the reserved cream cheese for the top of the cheesecake was too much liquid. I stopped at 3 TBSP or would have had a very runny topping. Was the whipping cream supposed to have been whipped? I couldn't tell from the recipe. Good flavor - nice presentation with the swirled caramel.

I brought another pumpkin cheesecake to Thanksgiving a few years ago, but got raves over this one! I doubled the recipe for the crust, as I had a 10-inch pan, and was easy to make, turned out beautifully, and tasted wonderful!

This cheesecake is fantastic!! It's gotten rave reviews from my friends and is requested so much that I make it several times each fall. The first few times I made the recipe, I had varying results with the topping...one time the cream cheese mixture was too thin and the caramel drizzled on top actually "sank" and disappeared...another time I overcompensated, making the topping too thick and it wouldn't swirl with the caramel. The best balance seems to be adding 3 1/2 to 4 Tbsp. of the whipping cream to the mixture, rather than the 5 T. called for in the recipe.
