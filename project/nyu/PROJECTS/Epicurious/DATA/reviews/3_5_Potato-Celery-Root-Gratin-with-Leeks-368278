YES. Just yes.

To "a cook" re: leeks- you never use the dark green leaves at the top, only the white and pale green part of the leek at the bottom. When a recipe calls for "3 leeks", that means just 3 individual stalks; usually at the market,the leeks will come bundles with 3 stalks...

I meant, the best "gratin" they've had...

I have made this several times and everyone raves that it's the best grain they've ever had, however, I leave out the celery root as to me it adds nothing in my opinion and is not missed at all. I also reduce the heavy cream to 2 cups and use 3 good-size potatoes and it serves 8 easily. People always want seconds, though!

I used about 1-1/2 cups heavy cream and 1-1/2 cups of half-and-half, not because I'm a fat-o-phobe but because I wanted to use up what I already had. It did turn out a tad soupy but still delicious! My only complaint with this recipe is it calls "3 leeks." A leek plant is a bundle of leaf sheaths -- so does that mean three bundles or three sheaths? I used one bundle (including the dark green parts); I probably will use more next time.

it tasted yummy, but i have to say it was so full of fat between the heavy cream and the Gruyere that i won't make it again. i knew going in ... (duh!) ... but i felt a heart attack coming on as i was indulging. still seeking recipes for Celery Root!

I served this with porchetta and it complemented the meal well. I did parboil the celery root for 5 minutes but I don't think I needed to. The cooking time was as stated and the potatoes were tender and delicious. I used part heavy cream and part half and half and part chicken broth and it was still rich and delicious.

I know some folks don't like ratings where you alter the recipe, so please consider yourself forewarned. For lightening and flavor deepening, I did this: used farmer's market mix of potatoes, some yellow, some red. I steamed the spuds and celeriac before composing. I added sauteed mushrooms to the leek mix, lightened the cream by using evaporated milk and a little cream for body. Kept the steeping garlic and chopped it into the cream addition, and also drizzled cream mix over each layer as it was built. Added a sharp parmesan to the Gruyere. Added some sliced marinated artichoke hearts and this dish is a thing of complete beauty to view, smell, and eat.

This was a fantastic recipe and delicious. I used an additional cheese because I love cheese - a medium white cheddar. Our guests loved the twist on the typical scalloped potatoes.

I LOVE this recipe. I don't use quite as much cream and I used Yukon Gold potatoes for a more buttery flavor. Just delicious!

I made this as directed with one exception, I added more leeks. This recipe is simple and delicious. My guests all loved it.

This is a great gratin. I did pre-cook the celery root, added nutmeg and cut down the whipping cream, so thanks to everyone for the comments. Increasing the leeks is also a really good tip. One of my guests said this is his favorite potato gratin of all time.

Made this to serve with roast pork. Based on previous reviews suggesting the celeriac was undercooked, I parboiled it for about 8 minutes before assembling the dish. I also added some nutmeg to the cream but other that that followed the recipe pretty closely. It looked great, the texture was perfect and it tasted delicious, although the celery root flavor was pretty subtle. Might try upping the celery root quantity next time. There will be a next time :-)

Made this last night; everyone loved it and had seconds and thirds! Had no issues with the potatoes or celery root being undercooked, it was just right, although I did cook it a bit longer. I don't think the celery root is really necessary or adds all that much, next time will make only with potatoes. I have made many potato gratins/scalloped potato recipes and this will replace them all. Was not runny at all. Delicious!

Hard not to be pretty tasty considering the ingredients but if I made it again i'd replace half the cream with chicken or vegetable stock, cook 4 cloves of garlic with the leeks not just steeped in the cream, more thyme, double the leeks, and slice the vegetables with a mandoline.

Not sure how thoroughly this was tested. I followed it to the letter and it looked and smelled beautiful with nicely browned cheese when I pulled it from the oven. The major problem was that when I went to dish it up both the potatoes and celery root were still raw and crunchy. Another reviewer had the same problem with the celery root being raw. Also the cream was still highly runny and there was lots of it. Perhaps because the veggies weren't cooked yet. Looking back this should have been obvious to me. It is a full 3qt. casserole and it is densely packed once its all put together. There was no way this was going to cook at only 350 for an hour and then uncovered at 350 for another half hour. Turn up the temperature and this might work and is probably delish. Oh BTW we have tested our oven for accuracy so it was not that my oven is off.

This dish got raves from my friends at our weekly get together. I brought the small amount of leftovers to work and the whole office wanted to know what the wonderful smell was. The flavor was still fantastic! I will absolutely make this again.

I followed the recipe to the letter and it was good, but not amazing. The celery root never quite cooked all the way through, even though I sliced very thin and baked until the top was browned. So the celery root kind of stuck out like a sore thumb, not being tender. But the flavors were nice and my husband liked it a lot. Super super super rich, of course, with all the cream and gruyere. I would make it again with a different veggie than celery root. I think it would delish with asparagus layered with the potatoes.
