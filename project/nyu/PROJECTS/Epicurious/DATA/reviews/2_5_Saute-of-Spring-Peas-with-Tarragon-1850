Very good, simple, and fast. Excellent presentation, and a good side dish to serve when you want a classy, but not overpowering complement to a strong-flavored entree.

Peas and tarragon go together beautifully. I've been making something similar to this for quite some time, and everyone loves it. Usually I just used "regular" peas (frozen) and add either Parisian Bonne Herbs or a clove or two of crushed garlic (removed before serving). Try it, you won't be disappointed.

This recipe was bland and gross. I had a feeling that tarragon mixed with peas would end up weird but I tried it anyway. Nope. Didn't work. Wouldn't try it again either. Peas, in my mind are best on their own, why mess with simple pleasures?
