Amazing dessert! Every time I make this people are asking for the recipe. This one is definately a keeper.

Delicious! Left the peaches on the grill after grilling an entire meal so it was a slow roast. Served with just sauce and vanilla ice cream to a happy crowd. Had leftovers the next morning on toast. It was the most delicious marmalade!

This was tasty and easy! I used my stove top grill. My white chocolate chips didn't melt that well but I took the torch to them. We also made homemade peach ice cream to accompany the grilled peaches. FYI I noticed the pits of my room temp peaches popped right out.

Lovely Labor Day-weekend dessert, grilled alongside a foil-wrapped snapper, the main course for the meal. I added a little vanilla to the butter, sugar, cinnamon sauce, and, like several other reviewers used dark chocolate rather than white. The roasted, salted pistachios were an excellent complement to the chocolate. We served the peaches with vanilla ice cream.

This was wonderful and so easy. The toughest part was getting the pits out of the peaches. I even forgot to top with the pistachios but no one seemed to mind. Definitely a keeper

Fantastic! So easy but impressive. As per other reviewer don't be afraid to leave those peaches on the grill for a while. Also use really good, ripe peaches. We skipped the white choc. as we don't care for it and did vanilla ice cream and crushed gingersnap cookies. Yummy!

So simple, yet the smoked peach flavor enhanced by the butter mixture gave it a sophisticated twist. I am not a fan of white chocolate, therefore used a very dark chocolate instead (70% cocoa)and served with vanilla ice cream. Perfect for an easy summer evening BBQ!

Wow! So easy, and amazing. Tasted like peach cobbler, without the crust. I served with shortbread cookies, and it was just awesome.

Very good and fast. I would leave the peaches on the grill longer to soften more. I'd omit the white chocolate and serve instead with vanilla ice cream.

This has become a new favorite for backyard bbq parties. I'd recommend smaller peaches, as they seem to grill better, and serve with a'la mode on hot days!
