Personally, I'd give this "two forks" because I think it was missing something, and would have been better cold. I was outvoted. The 4 year old and my husband raved over it, and the little guy asks me for it every time we go to the grocery store and pass the green beans. I've promised to make it tomorrow.

We make this a lot in the summer - it's a good recipe and simple. A nice dish to take to lunch the next day.

This is simple to make and tasty. A nice summer treat when the green bean plants are really producing!

I used raspberry vinegar in place of balsamic & salad oin in place of the olive oil, then sprinkled sesame seeds on top before serving. I would rate this a 4 with these adjustments. Next time will use sesame oil & try toasting the sesame seeds.
