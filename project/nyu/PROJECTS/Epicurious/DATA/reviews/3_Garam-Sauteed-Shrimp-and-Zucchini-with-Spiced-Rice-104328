The flavor of this dish is very good. My husband is finishing the rest as I type. I didn't use cilantro and made a simple jasmine rice with butter and saffron. Didn't need a thing more.

Used yellow squash in place of zucchini, would not use flavored rice next time. Really liked the flavor.

Quick and good, all the flavors were very nice together. I think I'll steal an earlier commenters idea and add coconut milk next time--make more of a curry out of it. I used jasmine rice in place of the flavored, and it was just fine.

I don't know that I'm qualified to fully review this- since I made it with just the shrimp- but it was nonetheless delicious. It was also ridiculously simple and fast, so it is pretty impressive for very little effort! I thought all the flavors blended so well- the garam masala had a sweet spiciness, and then the lemon and cilantro at the end cooled it a little bit. Next time, I might add some garlic and a little more of the spice to experiment.

Interesting idea but the cilantro is too strong a flavor for the garam masala. Also, the garlic in the rice does not blend well with the exotic spices. Seems like the flavors were too competitive. I will try jasmine rice and nix the cilantro next time.

Pretty tasty. I believe someone commented that there wasn't enough 'sauce' with this - I solved that by adding some coconut milk.

I was excited to try this dish, because it is very quick and easy and nutritious. But...I didn't care for the flavor. It seems like it needs a sauce or something, too. I won't make this again.

I used left-over coconut rioce in place3 of the herbed rice pilaf so I cannot fully evaluate the combined taste as written. I noted that the zucchini concentrates the garam masala flavor nicely. The result was wonderfully aromatic and flavorful. I always reccommend using a freshly ground spice mix. Mine consists of pre-mixed whole spices that I obtained from the Spice House.This is an excellent mixture , but homemade is also strongly reccommended.
