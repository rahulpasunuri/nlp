I am not a fan of cumin, so I made it without. It got rave reviews at a party and no one guessed that something was "missing". It's easy and does very well made a day ahead.

I just want to add that it's important to seed the eggplant. Otherwise, it's gonna be quite bitter.

Very nice, light and easy to make. I added cayenne pepper flakes for extra zip.

Not only is this delicious but if you don't add too many olives, it's low fat.
