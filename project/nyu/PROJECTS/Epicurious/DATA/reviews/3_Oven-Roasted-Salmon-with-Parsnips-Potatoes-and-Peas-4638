I had issues with this recipe. By the time the fish was done, the parsnips were burned and the potatoes were excessively crisp. Not sure if my oven runs too hot, if I sliced the veggies too thin, or what.

This was a great simple meal that we both liked a lot. As someone new to cooking i really liked preparing this meal. I put some mushroom rub on my salmon to spice it up some.

This smelled great but was surprisingly bland. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't interesting. There are so many other wonderful things on epicurious to try instead.

I made it for a dinner party and it was a big hit. I, too, messed with it: added carrots and onions. Also lots of salt and pepper and added some of the fresh thyme to the vegies. It took more olive oil, because the vegies started sticking... I forgot to get skinless filets and it was fine with the skins on. Next time I think I would use more vegetables, though.

Easy to make. I've added minced garlic and dried parsley to the roasted vegetables as suggested by one reviewer. Great winter comfort food.

Very good. Use carrots and onion. It's easy and the family loves it. All in one meal.

I make a dish (that I thought I invented!) which is very similar to this but has some additional umph. Before spreading the parsnips and potatoes in a pan to roast, coat them with a mixture of minced garlic, a T olive oil, Kosher salt and chopped fresh thyme or parsley. A bit of that should be spread on top of the fish once that gets put on top of the fish, as well. I also cook the peas separately and just add them at the end.

having lost 40 pounds this is a weekly meal that I really enjoy.

I fried the zest of a lime in some butter and brushed the fist with it before putting it on top of the veggies and it was delicious!

i make a similar meal that i love. i chop up parsnips and sweet potatoes (or carrots, or potatoes i suppose), mix them with olive oil and salt (and a little rosemary, if you want) in a baking dish, and bake at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes. the salmon i prepare by sauteeing in a pan with olive oil and butter. the original recipe called for fresh chervil, bay leaves, ground black pepper, and lime rind to be fried in the butter and oil beforehand. i've tried using thyme as well, and works nicely. the buttery mellowness of the salmon melds beautifully with the browned and roasted flavors of the root vegetables. this meal was a big hit the first time we made it for a dinner party -- we all cleaned our plates off. and it's easy enough to prepare for a nice mid-week meal.

The recipe was fairly easy, yet the taste was disappointing. I would rather have much a much subtler taste with salmon.

This was a waste of time and I squandered over $15 worth of fresh salmon. Wouldn't do it again.

We have made it several times, and we have always been pleased. The flavors are simple and compliment each other well. The peas are a nice touch. This has become a keeper.

I made this dish for three friends. I thought it was disappointing--a little too basic to serve at a dinner party, yet too much fuss to make it during the week.
