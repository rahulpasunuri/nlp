I have made several times and this is delicious. It can be a lot easier (and just as good) by cutting out some steps. Whisk eggs and dairy together, then heat slowly, stirring constantly until it coats a spoon. Take off from heat and add the white chocolate, etc., whisking after a minute until smooth, then pour over bread cubes in a large bowl. Toss until coated well and pour into baking dish. I have made with 1c. of cream to 2c. of whole milk and is still very good. First time I made, I used the white wine, but the cherries came out looking brownish. I have since used a nice red blend and the color is beautiful. I also have reduced the wine after the cherries have soaked and added back to the cherries for more of a sauce. This is perfect in miniature rounds served on top of a warm white chocolate ganache and drizzled with the cherries and sauce. Serve warm. It always gets rave reviews!

This bread pudding has been a dinner party (and Thanksgiving!) favorite for years. (Last year it disappeared faster than the pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving!) I mix extra dried cherries and white chocolate chips/chunks with the bread cubes before adding the custard so that the cherries are distributed throughout. I also reduce the poaching liquid to a syrup to be poured over the finished pudding with the poached cherries. I do not bake it in a water bath -- I've found that it makes it take a lot longer to cook and I've never had any bad results without the water.

WONDERFUL!!!!! I catered a formal dinner party for 10 and people practically licked their plates clean! and this followed four other courses! I saved the juice from the poached cherries and reduced it to a syrup consistency and drizzled it over the cherries. I also melted white chocolate in cream and put a puddle under the individual bread puddings (made them in ramekins). I took a risk on trying a recipe for a client that I never made before but this will be at the top of my menus choices from now on. Especially festive for the holidays....a mint leaf garnish would have made it perfect!

A tried and true standby. Delicious!

I liked the flavor of this recipe, so I will make it again in an attempt to get it right. All I had to make this in was a pie plate, which was too small to hold all the custard (I tossed about 1/3 of it). As a result, this was more bread than pudding, which was good, but not as great as I think this recipe is capable of being.

I have been making this desert for years. I first found it in a December issue of Gourmet magazine. It is a demand, rather than a request, at every family/friend function. If prepared correctly, the taste and texture are nothing short of phenomenal.

Loved it! It's really not that difficult to make either. I used fresh cherries and poached them and they were delicious! Along with the poached cherries I served it with homemade whipped cream. I will definitely be making this many more times because everyone loved it.

I made this for a dinner party I threw for some "foodie" friends and it was a huge hit! They key to this recipe is the quality of the ingredients. I would guess that the less than enthusiastic reviews came from people who tried to stint on the bread and/or the chocolate. I used day-old home baked brioche and Lindt chocolate and it was wonderful. The only change I made was to poach the cherries in Kirsch rather than wine.

good taste combination but not easy to make

This bread pudding is absolutely delicious. I used croissant instead of challah, and it worked wonderfully. The croissant gave the bread pudding a lighter, airy texture but greaty buttery flavor. Besides the croissant substitution, I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone in my family loved it. I don't know why other reviewers did not like it. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I don't think it's a coincidence that the three (and only) negative reviewers on 4/21 all reviewed on the same day, were all served this at a dinner party, and all live in Jersey. Hmmm...sounds like they were all at the same party to me. Could it possibly be the cook who was in err, not the recipe?

Hey, jilleyn, could it have been the cook?

A friend brought this recipe for a Valentine's party and we all loved it. She made a raspberry coulis for the sauce and we were converts. Hard to know why some reviewers did not enjoy this recipe.

I beg to differ with the recent one fork reviewers. It is one of my favorite desserts to serve. I've served it at least 12 times and not only does it consistently get rave reviews, it's easy to prepare and can cook while you're eating. Dare I say that something was missed or added incorrectly to the embarrased desert bearer? Give it another try - you're giving a great dessert a bad rating.

This most disappointing dessert was brought to my house for a dinner party. I and the rest of my guests anxiously awaited the time when we would supposedly savor this delicacy. Unfortunately, it was not the case. We anticipated eating it for a week. All I can say is that it's a good thing I had ice cream and oreos on hand for an impromptu dessert in lieu of this travesty. I suggest that if you intend to make a bread pudding stick to the traditional one with a bourbon sauce.

I didn't make this bread pudding, but I was unfortunate enough to be served this heinous desert after an otherwise wonderful meal. I don't know which was worse - the texture or the taste - but I would rather eat the mildewy sponge in my kitchen sink than this bread pudding. If you've got a challah, use it to make french toast, because no challah deserves to come to such a stomach-churning end. Yuck!!!

I'm baffled about how this recipe got rave reviews. After eagerly anticipating both the construction and the consumption of this bread pudding, I was profoundly disappointed in its texture, taste, appearance, and every other sensory feature. I used challah and a good-quality white chocolate, and followed the recipe exactly--yet it tasted like something a half-starved seagull digging in floodwater might even pass up. I had brought this pale, bland "dessert" to a dinner party at a friend's house, and upon first taste was relieved that we had the back-up of ice cream and cookies. I mean, this was embarrassing!

My husband and 7-year old daughter made a gourmet dinner for my son and I. This was dessert, and the hit of the meal. He used French Bread, dried mixed berries, and vanilla bean ice cream on the side vs. whipped cream. Too die for. Will make this for my parents next time they're in town.

I have made this dessert several times both with and without the cherry sauce, one time I added dried cherries to the pudding. It is requested by friends often!

I've made this recipe a number of times, each time substituting rasberries for the cherries and vanilla bean ice cream for the whipped cream. A perfect dessert.

I used regular chocolate (imported) and also soaked the dried cherries in white wine and drained them. I added the cherries into the breadpudding before baking the mixture..It was delicious!! Will make this again!!

I used croissants instead of brioche and cranberries instead of cherries. I also added a little more sugar. We have a real sweet tooth. Absolutely delicious...dinner guests raved!

Loved this receipe. It was easy to make and tasted great. It was a big hit at the party. It was a little hard to find the dried cherries and I add whipped cream to the top. Delicious
