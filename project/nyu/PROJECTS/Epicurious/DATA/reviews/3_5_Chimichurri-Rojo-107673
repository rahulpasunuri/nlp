Deliciously very spicy. I expect the poor reviews weren't quite expecting the intense heat.

This is a TERRIBLE recipe. I think maybe the cayenne is supposed to be 1 teaspoon not tablespoon. Also the vinegar is a bit strong as well. I love spicy food but this is not spicy it is nasty.

Excellent taste with a nice hot bite. The recipe doesn't make 1 & 1/4 cups though.

A good sauce that works very well as a companion to baked or fried fish. But the heat of the cayenne can prove an obstacle to some. I have found that adding a half tablespoon of cane sugar, and half a cup of orange juice, helps to rebalance this sauce, making it more suitable for my Danish customers. The citrus tang also makes it even more suitable to use with fish.

It was spicy and delicious. I am so glad I decided to try it. I would recommend this gladly.
