This is delicious and I've made it many times. A few adjustments make it even simpler: just 2 sticks of butter (it's plenty moist and rich), a cup of buttermilk instead of milk + lemon. I use a tablespoon of ground cardamom and two tablespoons of vanilla paste instead of beans. People love it and it keeps well for several days.

Based on earlier reviews, I added 1/4 c. milk, doubled the cardamom and used 2 t. vanilla in place of the beans. I wrapped the cake and served it the second day. It was delicious. The next time I may pour over a glaze with cardamom and vanilla.

Fabulously delicious! Made it for a dinner with 3 families, adults & kids, and everyone raved about it. Having read the reviews, I bought a new jar of good quality ground cardamom, so the pound cake had a lovely fragrance & good balance of cardamom & vanilla. I followed the recipe exactly -- didn't reduce the sugar or the butter. But also did allow it to sit in the pan for the full hour, then let it continue cooling out of the pan for several hours. The texture changed from fluffy cake consistency to traditional firm pound cake. It certainly is rich, but it went beautifully with berries. We had no leftovers for me to see if the flavors really do intensify. I guess I'll have to make it again soon to find out.

I love the flavors in this cake, even if the vanilla beans are a little annoying to deal with. I also had a problem with it being dry, but using 1 1/2 cups milk instead of 1 cup made a HUGE difference. It's much moister with just that extra 1/2 cup.

Love this recipe, and have made it several times in bundt form, 9 in pan form, and halved for an 8 in cake. I do not find it dry, but I use buttermilk instead of regular milk. I like the combination of vanilla and cardamom, and it's been a hit at family celebrations. Works well with chocolate frosting and swiss meringue buttercream too. I suggest a soaking syrup if you find it a bit dry; you can up the vanilla or cardamom flavor with a soaking syrup as well. Making this cake for my husband's birthday tomorrow, and topping it with a ginger buttercream and candied kumquats. I know he'll love it!

Love this website, love the reviews, usually love the recipes. I bake a lot and hated this recipe. Followed it to the T, used vanilla beans, etc. It was dry and didn't have much taste. Not worth the expense of the vanilla beans or cardamom. Don't do it! Not worth it!

I really liked this cake. I agree it does not have the typical consistency of pound cake, but I like cakes a little more fluffy. I substituted 2 tsp vanilla extract for fresh vanilla beans, and ground seeds from 4 cardamom pods fresh. The cardamom flavor was subtle, but I served it with sliced strawberries it was a hit.

I wouldn't make this cake again. It is kind of dry. Does not really have the texture of a pound cake. I would make my other recipite before I make this one again.

so tasty! Can't affor the $11 for two vanilla beans, so I used about 1 or 1 1/2 tablespoons of the best quality extract available, doubled the cardamom and cut the butter as suggested and added a tiny bit of lemon peel. maybe more vanilla next time.

I cannot rate this recipe yet because I have a question before I make it. Because I have vanilla extract on hand, and with vanilla beans so expensive, is it possible to substitute the liquid, and if so how much?

Tastes good, but way too fluffy. I wouldn't call this pound cake; it's more like sponge cake.

Tastes good; waaaaay too fluffy.

To me this was just a good pound cake, not exceptional in light of so many others that are just as easy to do. It had nice texture and flavor and smelled good.

Needs more cardamon. Smells great in the oven but then seemed a little lacking. Good recipe, just needs a bit more to be a great recipe.

I made this cake as is (though without the whipped cream topping), and served it to a friend who had previously sampled my beet halwa. She still insisted that cardamom makes everything taste like "Froot Loops." I loved it, though, and thought it had the perfect vanilla/cardamom balance.

This is a real improvement over the traditional pound cake, from just the small teaspoon of cardamom. I added another 1/2 tsp to give it extra flavor and also added 1 tsp of nutmeg. I served it with vanilla ice cream when the cake was hot from the oven. Yum.

Excellent pound cake. The fresh ground cardamom is strong. An easy cake to make. The next time I make the cake I will use less sugar, maybe one cup instead of 1 3/4 cup.

With fresh ground cardamom, the hint of this earthy spice was subtle and delicious, working well with the vanilla. I didn't want to lose sight of the fact that this is a pound cake and therefore stuck ridgedly to the recipe and could not have been happier; great dense pound cake that is both flavorful and fulfilling. The complete cooling time is a must though - allowed the flavors to blend and shine much more than even when it was slightly warm. Was a hit with my guests and is on my favorites list for this year.

This will be my recipe for pound cake from now on. I accidentally grabbed the cinnamon jar instead of the cardamom jar and, when I tasted the result, I was so glad. The light hint of cinnamon was nice. I will try it with cardamom sometime, too. I would definitely use a little less butter next time, as others have suggested. Two sticks would be plenty.

Excellent pound cake but I made several changes. Have made this twice - the first time using milk and the second time w/ buttermilk. Much better w/ the buttermilk. Also doubled the cardamom, decreased the butter to 2 sticks and brushed a cardamom/vanilla bean pod (used the scraped out bean pods)infused glaze to finish it. Instead of using a bundt pan, I baked the cake in 2 loaf pans, decreasing the time to 45 minutes.This is excellent w/ tea and I have a cake to freeze.

This will be my new go-to pound cake. I used just two sticks of butter, and it is nice and moist. Really nice texture. I must have had super-powered vanilla beans. I only had one and a half, but I can't taste the cardamom at all.

I love this cake. It is so simple and so tasty. I think that less butter works perfectly and I also used half a cup of whole milk and half of a cream - and it was perfect :) Definetly will make it again!

The cake is very tasty, easy to make, very attractive. I used a bit less sugar than called for & used only 2 sticks of butter as per others' recommendations. I found the cardamom flavor too faint although that may be intentional; it's a not a popular flavor.

We made a rum caramel suace to put over this and i t rocked! you can do a lot with this cake.

This cake turned out beautifully! Based on the previous comment, I decreased the butter to 2 sticks (easier to measure and deal with, too), and I also substituted 2 cups of whole wheat pastry flour for 2 cups of unbleached all-purpose. I didn't quite have the nerve to sub out all 3 cups of flour. I also used buttermilk instead of whole milk as I think buttermilk does a lot for a cake's texture. The freshly ground cardamom and real vanilla seeds make a wonderfully fragrant cake, perfect with an afternoon cup of tea. I skipped the whipped cream and just dusted it with powdered sugar.

This cake has a very good flavor and is easy to make. The only problem is that it has too much butter, making it a little greasy and heavy. I prefer a slightly lighter pound cake.

Confession; I love cardamom in baked goods which remind me of the terrific cookies from Swedish bakers in the Midwest, so this was a natural to try. I used green cardamom pods which took forever to open and remove the seeds. I used a mortar and pestle along with the vanilla seeds and salt required, ground and added with the butter. I used lime juice instead of lemon and used a clear lime glaze on top of the cooled cake. Also buttermilk, because I had it on hand. This is not a dense pound cake but xcellent with a moist crumb.

Excellent. Moist, tasty without being overpowering. I suggest you use the best and freshest cardamom and vanilla beans you can afford. A definite keeper.
