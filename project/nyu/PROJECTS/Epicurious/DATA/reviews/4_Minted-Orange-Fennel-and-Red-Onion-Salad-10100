The dressing makes this salad a hit. I used Trader Joe's Orange Muscat vinegar and it tasted wonderful.

This was delicious! Served it with bouillabaisse, and asparagus wrapped in pancetta (and sauteed).

I made this without mint (I thought I bought it but can't find it). I used a mandoline to slice the fennel and onion thinly. I was afraid the onions were still too sharp even after the ice bath, but the dressing made them more mellow. This would be a nice winter time first course and a nice change of pace from lettuce-based salad. Not many people have had raw fennel so it's also nice that has something unique in it.

This is a favorite in our house -- very refreshing and great with paella. I do toast the coriander seeds per the recipe and think it's worthwhile. I quarter the sliced oranges, onion, and fennel and toss them together with the dressing in a big bowl, which makes the dish easier to eat IMO. It's OK to make this a little in advance but add the mint at the last minute.

I have made this salad a few times and it always gets great reviews. I leave out the mint as I usually serve it as a condiment for fish tacos.

Fresh, flavorful and healthy - perfect summertime salad. I prefer cumin instead of coriander. Powder instead of seeds works well, too.

I made this for a side for dinner and it was exceptional. I had a few changes though. I hand sliced the fennel and onions and they were fine. I added 2 minoela oranges instead of 3 navel. I thought the minoela's were perfect. I really loved this recipe and will make it again.

Excellent. Simple, but complex flavors. It is so refeshing and fast to put together. I was worried about the coriander, but it was perfect.

This is great, especially after a rich main course. Next time I might add black olives.

A very refreshing salad with an exciting dressing. I found the onion quite overpowering (although I did use the wrong kind!) so made it a second time without, and it was wonderful. I also put in grated orange peel which seemed to enhance the 'oranginess' I also didn't have any fresh mint, ... I am curious to try it with that! I will be making this salad a lot!
