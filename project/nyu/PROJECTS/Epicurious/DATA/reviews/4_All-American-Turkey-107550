This is a great recipe which I've used for our Christmas Turkey since 2004. A perfect meal every time!

I don't know what happened, but this was the worst disaster I've ever had at Thanksgiving. The turkey was way underdone and the gravy was horrible. I ended up having to use some packaged mix (horrors!) and doctoring it up with left over juices. I'll just stick with my good old-fashioned gravy.....

Great recipe, my husband says it is in the top five of everything I have ever made. I did not have molasses so I simply made a gravy w/ the drippings and it was still awesome.

The meal was wonderful. In my oven, though, I needed to keep the foil on for most of the cooking time.
