The best pie I have ever made! The cherries were from my tree, so that probably made a difference, but this is now my go to recipe!

I followed the recipe but the filling was extremely runny such that i couldnt even slice it and had to eat it out of the dish :( anyone able to tell me how to resolve this? do i add more cornstarch?

Wonderful recipe! I made the crust in the food processor and it turned out great. Used fresh sour cherries from our tree, probably closer to six cups. I substituted arrowroot for cornstarch in the filling--the cherry juice was a little runny, not at all gelatinous as some cherry pies can be.

Fabulous, top to bottom. This is my second summer in a row baking this pie! This time, I let the dough chill in the fridge for 1 hour, which really made a difference in stickiness when it was time to roll it out. We like our pies more tart than sweet, so threw in 6 cups of freshly picked sour cherries to the 1 cup of sugar in the filling. Delicious. I want more now!

Good receipe but the vanilla extract overpowered the subtle cherry flavor. Leave out the extract and you have a winner.

Very terrific! Just by looking at the picture alone, I'm so eager to test it. I hope my friends from gourmandia.com will check this one.

This made the most perfect pie, thanks to the comments of jmfreedly. Cook the pie filling on the stove first, adjust the amount of sugar, lemon juice, and most importantly, cornstarch to suit the type of berries you are using (frozen or fresh) and you will end up with a wonderful pie with a perfect consistency. Thanks for your comments, jmfreedly!

My mother is the most accomplished cook I know, and has made prize-winning pies. When I made this pie, she said "I think I have some competition", which says volumes about the recipe provided!

This is the second year I made this recipe with fresh cherries from our Evans Cherry tree. Wonderful both times. This recipe deserves its blue ribbon!

This was absolutely delicious!! I just made it with cherries from my tree and it was amazing. A friend of the family said I should patent it hahahaha. the cherries I had were SUPER sweet, so I was generous with the lemon juice and added a bit less sugar, it was perfect. I had no problems with it thickening with the 3 tablespoons cornstarch. Also, the crust was divine, so light and flaky!

I used about 1 1/2 cups of canned Ranier Cherries and about 2 cups of thinly sliced, frozen apples for half of the required tart cherries; the big yellow Raniers added good color and the result was yummy. Good crust too.

Exceptional pie!!! Made for co-workers birthday and received rave reviews-best cherry pie they had ever eaten!!! Will be the only cherry pie I ever make from now on!!

I made this with canned Orgeon brand cherries (they are tart)and I'm thinking that's the problem. I did drain the juice and measured 5 cups but the filling was still too liquidy not very flavorful, but too tart (and I like tart cherry!). I will be sure to revisit this recipe in the summer when I can use fresh cherries! I really want a great sour cherry pie!

I found this recipe delicious and have made it twice. My only concern was that when I made it the first time, I used 3 tbs of cornstarch and ended up with a very and hard to cut pie. It tasted delicious though so I made it again. The second time I made it, we were out of cornstarch so I used 3 tbs of potato starch...... OH MY GOSH! What a difference it made! The pie was still delicious but it held together so well and was sooooo easy to cut! I definitley recommed using potato starch as a substitute for corn starch when making the pie. SO GOOD!!!!!!

I think I just baked the perfect cherry pie! This was my second attempt with frozen tart cherries, and I learned to adjust the recipe a little to accommodate their texture and extra liquid. The cherries were frozen at the orchard, and came in a lot of very light syrup. After thawing I drained the cherries for about 5 mins. Still plenty of liquid to cook down, and about 6 cups of mushy thawed cherries. ! I added an extra Tbsp. cornstarch to the sugar/salt, and simmered the filling for about 25 mins (stirring gently the whole time) until the glaze was clear and became thick and heavy. This made a huge difference with the rather soupy frozen cherries, and was responsible for the success of this second attempt. I cannot wait to try this recipe with fresh cherries next summer! The crust is heavenly. Use butter from pastured cows or cultured butter if you can find it, the flavor is so much richer, mmmmmm. I made fresh frozen custard with farm eggs and raw cream to serve on the side. Hoping to skip the main course tonight...

This was very good but almost overpowering to the cherries. Try the Clafoutis recipe on http://notesfromjudieskitchen.com/ to get a lighter more "cherry" version of a desert.

We cheated and bought frozen pie crusts from Trader Joe's, but the remaining ingredients went in just the same - with one big exception: fresh, plump blueberries were on sale when we bought the cherries, so we added a cup of them into the mixture. YUM!!!! The combined flavors of the two fruits along with their complementary textures made it the best cherry pie I have ever had in my life. We've since made it three more times and have continued to add the blueberries. Give it a try!

This crust recipe is amazingly good. Even the bottom crust was crispy and flaky! And that is hard to achieve with a juicy pie like cherry. Wonderful flavor. I used canned cherries (tart) because I couldn't find frozen or fresh. I used 3 cans for a deep dish pie, used the juice from only one can and the measurements for cornstarch etc the same as in the recipe and it was perfect!!!

Rating: 0
Totally wonderful recipe. The crust is perfect, and the lattice top is fun (not hard) to do, and will make you look like a serious old-world baker. I have made it a couple times and do suggest patience while the cherries cook. It takes longer than I thought for them to thicken and the first time I made it, I dumped in more cornstarch and then it came out gummy. So just have faith in the recipe to come together, and I've found that it will.

Rating: 4
Fabulous made just as the recipe states- I used sour cherries and didn't think it too tart at all. I even made the filling ahead of time once and froze it for the future- it was still great! A beautiful, stunning dessert! I have made it 3 times and continue to get requests for it!

I need to get better at getting my crust into the pan, but that's not the recipe's fault. This turned out great with no changes. I eyeball the butter because butter here is sold in 250g blocks, so I guestimate. No matter, tasted great, and none was left at the end of the day.

Wow this is tart! I had never made a sour cherry pie before but I had some leftover freshly picked sour cherries. It made a very sour/tart pie so you definitely need to pair it with ice cream.

Rating: 3
Just finished baking this pie. I used dark sweet cherries and a store bought crust otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The filling was super runny even though I added an additional tablespoon and it wasnt quite as sweet or tart as it should have been. Next time I will use sour cherries, a little more sugar, more vanilla and certainly more cornstarch (possibly 5 tablespoons). This is a nice easy recipe overall and with a few changes it will be good.

Rating: 4
Have made this twice, now - 2 sour cherry seasons in a row. It's just perfect. I've not found it needed thickening, and like the teensy bit of lemon juice (though I did use Real Lemon 2nd time after watching a taste test on America's Test Kitchen) works. The crust is simple to pull together (and adjustable to humidity w/ the 5T water - this time I only used 3, last time 5), but because it's very buttery, is a little tricky to roll out, as others have said. But unless you're entering this in a contest and not devouring it immediately, it'll patch together just fine.

Just made this with cherries from our tree. It is the most fabulous pie we've ever had. I used more than 5 cups of cherries(about 6 cups)because that's what I had and I had a pie pan big enough to accommodate the extra. If you can, do use 6 cups. I also double the cornstarch because of the extra amount, the cherries seemed juicy, and I prefer thicker filling. The pie crust was the best I've ever had. It was buttery and flaky, like a french pastry. Fast and easy to make. Although I used closer to 9 T of water. I will never buy pie crust again.

SOOOO good! This was my VERY FIRST time making a pie from scratch and I impressed myself (thanks to this recipe of course). The dough was very straightforward. It turned out flaky and delicious. The reviews suggesting more cornstarch were spot on. I just added one extra tablespoon and it was perfect. This needs a scoop of vanilla Ice cream so make sure you have it on hand.

I like all the suggestions because mine needed thickening. I did use fresh cherries, my first time ever. Could not obtain sour ones though. What a fete!!!!! I am so jazzed, but will look at all the recommendations for thickening.

Exceptionally good. I did make the following changes: in the crust: I used 1/2 King Arthur pastry flour and 1/2 a.p. flour; I added 1 t. vinegar and used 1/3 c water. in the filling: I used 2 T cornstarch and 2 T Minute tapioca; 6 c. frozen sour cherries; 1/4 t. vanilla and 1/4 t. almond extract. It took 1 1/4 hours to bake.

The only thing I'd omit from this recipe is the lemon juice. The cherries are tart enough & I thought adding the lemon juice made the pie way too tart. We definitely had to eat this with a scoop of ice cream to sweeten it up. Otherwise, a good recipe for classic sour cherry pie.

I am a cherry pie lover and this has become my favorite. I love the tartness and consistency of the filling, and it is a very uncomplicated recipe. I made it for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews. Definitely will be my go to cherry pie recipe from now on.

Turned out excellent. I ended up using frozen tart cherries, about 6 cups. I think it could have used more. I also cooked the filling on my stovetop to insure it thickened. (I needed to double the amount of cornstarch.) For my crust I also needed to double the amount of ice water. That could have been because I used white whole wheat flour. (It's all I had.) The flavors were spot on though. This has become my cherry pie recipe from here on out.

This crust recipe is the best ever. I made the cherry pie and then used the crust recipe to make a peach pie. Don't play with the crust too long and it is fantastic! Very flaky and perfect. No matter what pie I make I will always use this crust recipe. The cherry filling was always very good.

Best crust I ever made - a little tricky to roll out, but very flaky and flavorful. Use sweet cherries and the full 3 T of lemon juice. I Based on the other reviews, I added one extra T of cornstarch and did not add all the juices from the cherries, reduced the heat to 350 as my oven runs a little hot. Double the vanilla because I like vanilla and it was great.

Tart and buttery, in just the right doses! I never vary from my mum's easy pie crust, but I thought I would give this one a try. The flavor was definitely worth it, and it was not much harder to roll out than my stand-by. I did refrigerate the dough for the full thirty minutes, which helped. As to the filling: Lovely and tart on its own, and heavenly when accompanied by vanilla ice cream. (Used sour cherries.)

WOW! Followed this recipe to a "T" using fresh Michigan tart cherries. Delicious buttery crust. Served it with vanilla ice cream, which balanced out the tartness of the cherries nicely. Pure heaven!

Rating: 3
Absolutely delicious! I used just over 4 cups of pitted sour cherries which I mixed with the rest of the filling, let sit a bit, and then strained off half the juice cause I was scared of it being runny. I think it would've set up fine if I had left all the liquid in. I baked it as mentioned at 425 but then only 25minutes at 375. By then it had already browned and the filling thickened nicely. I think next time I'll experiment by adding a little cinnamon or something to the filling for extra flavor.

Rating: 4
Turned out delicious! Used sweet cherries, cut the sugar by 1/2 and added extra lemon juice. It's best if the pie sits overnight before serving, or is made early in the day. The filling will not run if it's had proper time to rest. Crust was flaky and full of flavor.

the filling turns out quite thin, runny. and the recipe doesnt call for enough fruit, 6 cups seems to be the appropriate amount. the "old fashioned cherry vanilla pie" recipe, also on this site turned out much better. filling is made with quick tapioca.

The pie was great tasting, but VERY soupy --- the cherries poured out of the crust and the bottom of the pie plate filled with liquid after pieces were removed. It didn't seem like the corn starch did it's job at all as a stabilizer. Any one have any suggestions for a firmer set for the filling?

I made this for my dad's birthday. It turned out beautifully and my dad exclaimed, "It's just like my mom used to make!" I used more than 5 cups of pitted cherries and think it probably could have used more, even in the 9in. pie plate. My cherries were super soupy so I added 5 Tbsp. of cornstarch instead of the 3 Tbsp. called for. I also had to double the amount of ice water used in the crust for it to even hold together. At 9 Tbsp., it was still too crumbly. The result was delicious.

This pie is fanastic! Both the crust and filling are outstanding! I enjoy cooking, but not baking, but had fresh cherries and after reading the reviews thought I would give this pie a try. This is definitely a KEEPER. The crust is so rich, flakey and tender -- I used a food processor to make the crust. In the filling I used 3 TBS lemon juice, since I prefer tart, more than sweet and in addition to the vanilla added 1 tsp almond flavoring. I don't think I ever had a more delicious pie -- cherry or otherwise! Hard to stop at one piece.

I have made this four times in two weeks, substituting 2 1/2 cups rhubarb for half the cherries (we have a bumper crop of rhubarb in our front yard). It is better than my traditional rhubarb/strawberry pie. This has become the favorite pie of my sweetie & me. I still use only 1 cup of sugar - we like our pies on the tart side. Dark sweet cherries have been at the market, so that's what has gone into the filling. A stainless cherry pitter makes pitting the cherries a breeze. Like some of the other reviewers, I find that the pie has cooked a little too quickly at 375 - I think next time I'll turn it down to 350.

Made this on a whim and was very happy with the results. I used a roll-out pie crust and unfortunately didn't have five cups of cherries (used about three cups that were from a jar) so the pie was a bit on the small side, but otherwise was great Family loved it.

Yummy! I used canned sour cherries and added lemon zest and almond extract to brighten the cherry flavor. The crust was so buttery and flaky, it could be the best I've ever made.

Cherry pie is my husband's favorite, and he gave this recipe rave reviews. We made it for Thanksgiving (used a Marie Callendar's pre-made crust, since we had a number of dishes to prepare), and the recipe turned out great. Definitely needs the bit of vanilla ice cream on the side to add a touch of sweet to the sour, but overall a great and tasty recipe. We'll definitely be making this one again.

Wonderful recipe. We used fresh Michigan sour cherries from the Farmer's Market today. The vanilla ice cream balanced the tart cherries beautifully. Notes: It took 2 quarts of cherries to fill the pie. I only needed about 40 minutes of the hour at 375 the recipe calls for (though I used a pie baking ring under the pie pan (round, with a hole in the middle) instead of baking the pie on a cookie sheet.

Fantastic recipe! It was a huge hit with all those lucky enough to get a piece - a perfect, flaky crust and the filling was just right. I added an extra 3/4 cup of sour cherries, so I added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch. And instead of milk, I brushed the crust with a little beaten egg, and then generously sprinkled sugar crystals on top. Can't wait to make it again... it was just that good.

My first cherry pie and it was FANTASTIC! The crust is buttery and flaky and perfect with the sour cherries. I did make the same mistake as another reivewer and added extra cherries, but did not increase the cornstarch. It was runny but that didn't slow down anyone from grabbing a slice!

This is the sour cherry pie that my husband remembers from his childhood. When made with fresh Michigan tart cheeries the end result is just wonderful. I did not latice the top crust but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Would like to repeat and use sweet cherries next time since the season for tart cherries is so short.

A co-worker brought in this pie and before I could say Cherry Pies are my least favorite she left the slice. I tasted it and was really surprised. I dont normally give written reviews, but this is Honestly & Truly AWESOME!!! It taste so much like my favorite berry pies with a little tartness and it doesnt have the yucky jellied filing with the over baring sweetness. This is definitely a Thumbs Up!!!! I can no longer say its not my favorite.
