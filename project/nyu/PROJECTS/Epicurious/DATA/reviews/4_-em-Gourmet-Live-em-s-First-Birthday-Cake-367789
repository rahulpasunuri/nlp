This is the worst recipe I've ever gotten off this site. I'm not a pro baker but have had many people ask me when I'll open my shop and have made several large tiered wedding cakes that people have exclaimed is the best they ever have. I'm 100% sure it wasn't something I did, it just didn't taste good... it was very bland and a little dryish although not overcooked just not a great texture.

Great cake. A little labor intensive, but worth it. Yellow cake is moist and the frosting is fluffy and delicious. Go ahead and put all the butter in the frosting...totally worth it.

I made this for my husband's birthday dinner. It was everything I expected. The yellow cake was light and delicious. I changed the icing however because there was so much butter in the cake already. I used another choc icing recipe We loved it!

Its a bit complicated for baking dont you think? If you have time visiting www.Everything-cake.com, their cake recipes are quiet nice and easy to prepare.

I made this for my daughter's birthday (with her assistance of course). It was really delicious, very light and flavorful. My icing came out wonderfully, luxuriously light and creamy. It worked for us as my family doesn't care for sweet frostings but I did sweeten it up just a touch with honey and I added instant expresso to bring the chocolate flavor out even more. Really, really good!

made for a birthday party! Was delicious, successful and easy to make. Added a variation to make the frosting less sweet and less rich by adding 1/2 cup of the special whole milk plain yougurt into it.

I gave this recipe four forks because the cake part was excellent. However, we were not fans of the frosting and would use a different frosting recipe next time. I could not find plain whole milk yogurt, so I used vanilla whole milk yogurt. The cake was very moist, very light, and very delicious!

I also did not use all the butter. I thought 3 sticks of butter was a bit too much. The icing was very soft after I spread it on my cupcakes, but by the next morning the icing was firmer but still so soft in texture. The absolute Best Cake Ever!

I made this recipe, but instead of a cake, I made cupcakes. They came out so moist. I have never found a yellow cake recipe that was not dry. And let me tell you, the icing, Oh my goodnes! It is the fluffiest, lightest, and most airy icing I have ever tasted. I don't think I will ever make another icing.

We made the cake and thought it was exceptional. Insted of using Plain yougurt, we used Vanilla. Also, if you dont have any cacao, for the bittersweet, use semi-sweet chocolate chips. We used Nestle. For the bitter chocolate, we used unsweetend chocolate powder(like Hersheys). This made us a delicious Chocolate cake.

The cake is a home run. I would have given it four forks with better icing. The icing isn't sweet enough (a bit bitter), and isn't thick enough for really good spreading. It's a bit slimy. I'm chilling the cake and I hope the icing thickens up a bit. The cake took a lot longer to bake than the recipe says. I used 9-inch pans and it took closer to 40 minutes than 20. I turned down the heat to 325 after 25 minutes because the cake was getting too brown while the center was still liquid.

Wonderful! I've been craving this combo of yellow cake and choc icing for a couple months and didn't find a recipe in my notebook. Fell in love with this when I licked the batter off the spoon- swoon-worthy. Flavor and texture of the cake is lovely. I made two 6 inch layers and 16 cupcakes. Will freeze the layers to use this weekend and we'll enjoy the cupcakes all week. This one goes into the notebook today. Mmmmm. (I didn't have cake flour so used the substitution of 2 T corn starch plus enough sifted all purpose flour to make one cup; three times for three cups flour.)

Happened to read the blog post featuring this recipe the day before I needed a cake for a birthday party. Was wary of the amount of butter - but went ahead with it anyway. The cake tasted good and it doesn't crumble though it is sticky. The frosting whips up light and there is plenty for frosting a three layer cake. For my taste though, it is too rich and too chocolatey. Everyone scraped off some frosting and left it on the plate. Overnight in the fridge hardened the icing and muted the flavor. This cake could easily serve twenty and in my opinion is a much better cake when served in small portions.
