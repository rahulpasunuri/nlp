Terrific cheesecake! Served it at a dinner party last night and it disappeared.

This is, hands down, my favorite cheesecake... there is something about those flecks of vanilla bean, the creaminess of the cheesecake, and the pop of the fresh berries. I made these for my friend's wedding last year. People talked about them for days. However, I would leave off the jam/jelly topping. When the cheesecake was done, I just topped it with fresh berries and dusted them with powdered sugar. No glazed goo. This is my go-to cheesecake. Don't use frozen berries. The extra cost is worth it.

This one is a winner...creamy and delicious! I made it for a dinner party last night and it received rave reviews. One guest ate 2 pieces and took another home! I made a few adjustments: I used vanilla bean paste instead of beans; I don't like raspberries so I used strawberries, and I used pecans instead of hazelnuts in the crust. I will make this again...SOON.

Very good. Next time, I would use an extra vanilla bean, and not put berries into the cake, just use them on top in a nice pattern. I also made a chocolate graham cracker crust, and made sure it only went a little over half way up the sides so some of the cheesecake would show. It made a lot of crust, but was very good. Everyone thought it looked like it came from a high end bakery. Could have cooked a few minutes more.

A great cheesecake...I make it at least a few times a year. Looks gorgeous, tastes awesome....I especially love the hazelnut smell of the crust, it's unusual...

I made this cheesecake along with a few others for my brother's wedding, and it was a hit. It looked absolutely gorgeous with the blueberries and raspberries in concentric circles on top. I didn't add as much jam on top and didn't coat the berries with it (because who wants to temper the fresh taste of summer berries?). Adding the berries to the batter itself makes the cake particularly light and fresh. I would add a bit more vanilla bean next time--maybe cooking it with cream before adding makes the vanilla flavor somewhat faint. Oh, and the crust was AMAZING. The toasted hazelnuts were a little time-intensive but so worth it :)

I have made this several times and it's fabulous! You can order vanilla beans on line at www.arizonavanilla.com. It's much cheaper. You can get 12 beans for around $15 (not including shipping, which is not much).

This is a keeper. I didn't have hazelnuts so I used pecans. I also substituted blackberries for the raspberries, but it was still great. Guests that said they were not fond of cheesecake loved this one.

Made this for an office 4th of July potluck. Looked great on the table, but taste didn't live up to the looks. Addition of so much vanilla gives the cheese part of the cake an unappealing gray/brown color. Also, too eggy/creamy for my taste. There are better cheesecake recipes out there.

Yum Yum. The best cheesecake ever, the cream makes it somehow light and airy. Loved the vanilla flavor. I did not have the beans so used extract. I cooked it in a water bath as well. Will surely make again

Wonderful recipe. I made this and several other cheesecakes for my sister's wedding as an alternative to traditional wedding cake. I received so many compliments on this cake and threats that I'd be kicked out of the family if I didn't make this again for every family gathering to follow. A little time consuming, but well worth the end result.

Delicious!! I made it exactly as written using raspberries from our yard and fresh blueberries. Husking the hazelnuts is a pain, but very worthwhile - the crust is wonderful. I don't think almonds would taste nearly as good. Also, I buy all my spices at Penzeys and their vanilla beans are 3 for $6.29, much less than what I've seen here. They have beans from both Mexican and Madagascar. We have one of their 30 stores here, but they do mailorder and their website is penzeys.com. Finally, I put the berries on top in alternating concentric cirles. It surprised me how nice it looked. Too bad they don't have photos for this one.

This was an excellent recipe. I made the following changes: I used almond meal instead of the hazelnuts and I used 1 cup frozen blueberries instead of fresh ones for the filling part. I am not a fan of "heavy" cheesecakes and this recipe produces the perfect "light" cheesecake. Everyone who ate it raved about it. This recipe is a keeper.

I made this for a graduation party and it was an absolute hit!! The guests couldn't get enough of it. I'll definitely make it again...no changes. Time consuming, but totally worth it, even if the vanilla beans are expensive! :)

This cheesecake was amazing. I made it for Easter, exactly as written, and had tons of compliments. There were a lot of steps, but none were difficult. This was absoutely worth the effort.

I've made a lot of cheesecakes, and this one has been the best yet. Friends 'oooohed' when I brought it out and then promptly set about devouring it - not only striking in appearance, but delicious as well.

This cheesecake was absolutely delish. And it was loads of fun to make. I pretty much followed the recipe as stated, except I used pecans in the crust. I served the cake on a beautiful pedestal and placed fresh mint sprigs on top. The only thing better than looking at the cake was eating it! This is definitely a show stopper and a repeat for sure. BTW, if your local grocery store prices for vanilla beans are too high ($9-10 for 2 beans), I found them a little cheaper at Trader Joe's ($5.99 for 2 beans).

For the cheaters out there - I used double the vanilla extract and frozen berries b/c I was originally going to make the white chocolate raspberry layered cheesecake. So i didn't have fresh beans or berries on hand, and I skipped the topping. This one is less work and the texture better. I added a few berries in the center on top b4 baking and when serving for presentation. Next time i may use an oreo crust. It's hard to mess up this recipe.

I have officially renamed this cheesecake to "The 8 million dollar cheesecake" as it costs about that much to make it, particularly when berries are out of season! However, the results are absolutely breath taking. Talk about "wowing" people. The cheesecake makes an amazing presentation with lots of color. The flavor, thanks to those expensive vanilla beans ($9 each in Atlanta), and costly berries ($5 each container), is absolutely fabulous. The texture is perfect. I use a hot water bath (double wrapped pan in heavy duty aluminum foil) and bake the cheese cake for 1 hour at 300 degrees, then another hour at 275 degrees, and then the final 30 minutes at 250 degrees. I use this baking time with all of my cheesecakes (9 inch pan, 3 packages of cream cheese), and all of them turn out perfect. I'll make this again for sure, but when berries are in season!

I saw this recipe and thought, berries and vanilla, ho-hum. But based on the strength of the reviews I tried it, and am I glad I did. It's just wonderful - light, creamy, and bursting with berry flavor. I did think the texture was ever so slightly on the grainy side (although I was the only one), so I might use one less egg next time. But other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

This was a great cheesecake! The crust was amazing although I didn't add the hazelnuts, I just added more shortbread cookies. I also didn't want to spend $15 for whole vanilla beans, so I used a vanilla bean paste from Trader Joe's that worked great. I think I baked it a few minutes too long, because it was the slightest bit drier, but it was still mouth-watering. Will make again and again!

Little more needs to be said about this recipe -- the results are superb. Two vanilla beans, though, make the dish quite expensive (at $5.50 per!), so next time I might use only one, but the flavor of the fresh bean(s) was noticeable and wonderful. I laid out the surface berries in an easy pattern, and the cake looked like it came from a bakery.

I enjoyed this recipe with a few moderations. For the crust, I used toasted almonds with graham wafers instead of the shortbread. I also omitted the blueberries and just used raspberries. My guests raved about it! One guest who professes to dislike cheesecake even had 2 pieces! I'd definitely make this again...it's a flavourful, smooth, moist cheesecake.

I made two of these cakes to a big dinner party last Friday. I had a terrible cold, high fever, terrible headache. Yet making this made me feel a little better. It was very easy and managed to take my mind of the aches. And the cake was a huge hit, everybody loved it!

This was a great recipe to make. I enjoyed making it and have made it three times since last month. I substituted pecans for hazelnuts and the crust turned out great. This is a keeper.

This was delightful as everyone said, even using light sour cream and low fat cream cheese. (I also forgot the sour cream in the cake part and it turned out fine).

I used blackberries and raspberries in the recipe, and then piled blueberries and a few mint sprigs around the cake plate for presentation - it was gorgeous! I made it three times this summer and each time it got raves and requests for the recipe.

Great! Great! Great! The only thing I changed was I substituted Toasted Peacan for the hazelnut (only because I could not find hazelnut) and it was wonderful. The presentation of this dessert was magnificant.

Cheesecakes are my most requested special dessert, and this one is now my most requested cheesecake. I use macadamia nuts in the crust, but that's the only change I make. Just the best ever!

This is the cheesecake that introduced me to cheesecakes, and it gets better every time! Be prepared for cravings! So perfectly balanced between light and heavy (fruit and filling), the vanilla beans are crucial!!!! (Ive also added strawberries to the fruit mixture=))

I thought it was a little too creamy so the second time I made it I put in only 2 eggs. I liked the consistency a lot better and I've been making it that way ever since.

This recipe is incredible! I made it with vanilla extract since I couldn't find a vanilla bean locally, and it was still good. Also, I used frozen blueberries and rasberries (fresh would have been $20 since they're not in season!), and they worked fine. This made a LOT more than I expected - two 7" pie tins, plus more filling left over. But it went quickly :)

Wonderful recipe... the vanilla bean seeds are the key. Not that hard to make if you've made a cheesecake or two before. Guests gobbled it up. I wish I had made two!

This is a terrific cheesecake!! Comes out beautifully, no cracks, nothing! Its perfect! As others have said it is light tasting (due to all the fruit I would assume). Looks beautiful too. Not just a crowd pleaser but a crowd wower! Will make this again and again. Only flaw is the cost, the berries and the cream cheese make this an expensive one, but worth every penny!

This is by far the best cheesecake I have ever made. It was well worth the extra effort. I added an xtra bar of crm cheese for height. The vanilla bean makes all the difference!

I was in heaven the first time I tasted this cheesecake. As one of the other reviews says, it's both rich and light tasting at the same time, which is so very true. I often find cheesecakes can be entirely too thick and rich, to the point you can only eat half a slice. Not with this cake. You'll not only eat one slice, you'll want to eat the whole cake. While this cake is fairly labor-intensive the end result not only in taste but presentation as well are well worth it. People will hail you as a master chef. I can't say enough about it. I have yet to try the cake without the berries, but I really think the vanilla bean infused whipping cream is the key to the wonderful vanilla flavore of this dish. I could go on, but I'm thinking I want to go make this one again!

I made this for an office party along with your Chocolate Almond Souffle Torte. I expected the Chocolate Almond Souffle Torte to disappear immediately, as I had made it before to rave reviews. Instead, this cheesecake was gobbled up first. It is definitely worth the time to make.

This was the best, most scrumptious, rich tasting yet light at the same time, cheesecake that I have ever eaten. I made it for an official function and it was gone within minutes. I am making it again for my baby shower--my future little munchkin also loved it!!!
