Love the herbs! Made this yesterday w/ herbs from my garden (flat leaf parsley, curly parsley, rosemary and sage). We used it on a kobe burgers - a smidge of swiss cheese, the herb salsa and then a topping of diced sundried tomatoes. Delicious and made these burgers extra special - nice change of pace as we near the end of our grilling season.

This steak was awful, very tough. If skirt steak is marinated it can be delicious. But from the refrigerator to the grill for 5 minutes produces tough, tasteless meat. The green herb marinade, on the other hand, was delicious (parsley, mint, thyme).

This was exceptionally easy and so delicious. I made a few modifications: used thin cut NY strip steak, used chives, parsley, and mint as herbs, and finally, I slathered the herb mixture over the steaks prior to grilling to produce a nice crispy crust over the steaks. Superb!

Disappointed. Saw this was the recipe of the day and was excited to make it. After making the herb salsa, I really did not like it. I ended up putting it in the blender and making a marinade that I put on the meat towards the end of grilling. This is not a recipe I would make again.

OMG! Talk about easy and tasting fantastic! I used beef flap meat which is a similar cut of meat if not the same as skirt steak. The herbs that were accessible for me to use were mint, thyme, sage and flat- leaf parsley. My husband grilled the meat perfectly and I served this with corn on the cob with lemon pepper and chipotle sweet potatoe fries. This recipe can be as simple and casual as I served it and I would definitely make this for company and dress up the sides or not! We loved our dinner!

This is a recipe I used 30 yearsago. It requires lots of fresh garlic as well. I kCoarse salt works best I used flank steak then. Add some tothe top after grilling and it is very good. Lots of lemon makes the flavor.
