My guests enjoyed this more than I did. If I make it again I will not use quick cooking grits. Actually, I think this would be better if it was incorporated into a polenta recipe.

I have made this twice for potlucks and have gotten rave reviews on the dish. Being out in California, people see it as something different.

This dish was okay. I like roasted red bell peppers, but I would say this isn't anything to write home about. I added grated Grana Padano (a type of young Parmegiano Reggiano), which did boost the flavor. Not sure if I'll make this again. It does seem like a good accompaniment to some fresh ham, however.

Well i thought that cooking grits were the same thing as grit, so I put some pebbles in the recipe. It didn't taste very good. Then I went to the grocery store and asked for grits, and they had some other stuff called grits. So I made the recipe again and it tasted great!

Amazing. I have made this twice using the jar peppers and both times have added about 1/2 cup of freshly shredded parmaggiano reggiano. Definitely helps the flavor. Received many compliments.

I think this was more a matter of my taste, but I thought the recipe was too sweet. Maybe adding some sharp cheese would have helped.

Like many others, I used regular (not quick-cooking) grits, and roasted peppers from a jar. This was a terrific accompaniment to ham, and several people who thought they didn't like grits were converts!

One word: YUM! I made this for a brunch recently, and everyone who tried it (can't get everyone to eat grits) raved about it. After one taste, I was tempted to take the dish back into the kitchen and eat all of it myself. I used a jar of roasted red bell peppers, rather than roasting them myself. (After roasting a dozen red bell peppers two days earlier for another dish, I just didn't feel like roasting any more.) I'll definitely be making this dish again ... and again!

I made this recipe before I actually ordered it at the White Dog in Philadelphia. I have used commercial roasted red peppers as well as roasting my own and I don't think it makes much difference in the final product. This is a great "upscale grits" recipe that does not involve cheese; served it with country ham and home made cheese biscuits for Christmas dinner yesterday & everyone enjoyed this colorful meal!

Wonderful contrast! The creamy grits with the spunk of red pepper was a taste absolutely unfamiliar to me. We added a little blackened seasoning to kick up the flavor of the red pepper.

Easy to make in advance and a beautiful color contrast on the plate. For more umph, use more Tabasco. There's a typo at the end of the second paragraph. Grits should simmer for 3-5 minutes, NOT 35 mines.
