We all loved this recipe. I agree, add the scallions and ham at the end for color, but even without the best looks it tasted fantastic. My father-in-law loved them. And I always like something you can prepared ahead of time and simply reheat. The porcinis gave it a great flavor, but anything will work!

I couldn't find the mushrooms called out so I just used baby portabello's and I thought it was great (as did my guests). If I get the chance I'll try it with the original recipe, but even still, I give it a thumbs up.

This dish is delicious and, as the recipe states, can be made the day ahead. The dried porcini mushrooms make a good dish special. The one thing I will do differently the next time is that I will add the ham and chives just a few minutes before serving - I think the colors will enhance the dish.

Everyone loved these mushrooms which I made with the steak bordelaise and creamy potatoes featured in the October issue. I might add a bit more ham next time.
