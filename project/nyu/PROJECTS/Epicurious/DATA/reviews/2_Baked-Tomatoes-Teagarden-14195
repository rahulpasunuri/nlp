I put it on top of rice- not bad, I tend to think it should at least be a part of a maincourse rather than part of an appetizer (considering the amount of prep time for, basically, tomatoes)

It's not that these tomatoes taste bad, just that there is nothing special about them. It is not worth one and a half hours of cooking. Also, the tomato skin is tough and should be removed before serving.
