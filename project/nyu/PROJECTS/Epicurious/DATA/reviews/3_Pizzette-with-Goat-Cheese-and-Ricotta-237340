Delicious flavor with the goat cheese and lemon! I served this as a dinner and used beefsteak tomatoes, cut in big slices, instead of cherry tomatoes.

I made this into a large pizza using a ready made flat bread crust. Put the cheese on the crust and put in the oven at the recommended temperature on the crust package for about 10 minutes. Take it out and add fresh whole basil leaves on top of the cheese and then top with marinated tomatoes. Heat it through and serve. I took this to a luncheon and people went crazy for it. The fresh basil is a must.

I followed others' advice and tossed the tomatoes with lots of garlic and olive oil and a drizzle of balsamic. It was delicious. (Also added herbes de provence and pepper to the cheese mixture). I loved the pizza dough, I will use that recipe again.

I have made this recipe about 3 times now and love it. The first time I made it I found there to be a little lack of flavor so I added more lemon zest and also added basil on top of the pizzas. Absolutely delicious and everyone loves them!

skipped the pizza dough due to time constraints - made crostini out of a baguette instead and marinated the tomatoes in balsamic, basil & olive oil for about 1 hr before placing on top. Worked out great and everyone loved them

This was a boring tasting recipe. We even tried making some of the pizzettes with different toppings: mushrooms and pepperoni. There's just so much missing...

This recipe is a good starting point. The components are all good, the finished product tasty but a bit blah. I will make them again, and jazz them up with other ingredients (oil-cured olives? Anchovies? Tapenade? Caramelized walnuts?).
