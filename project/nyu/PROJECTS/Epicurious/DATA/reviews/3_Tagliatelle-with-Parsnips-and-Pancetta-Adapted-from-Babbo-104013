Good, simple recipe but realized I don't really like the sweetness of parsnips with pasta. Adding garlic does help.

My wife and I make this regularly. Be sure to remove the core of the parsnips. We substitute Turkey bacon and often deglaze the pan with white wine. Serve with a hefty dose of parmesan and be sure to use FRESH pasta, not dried to get the proper texture, mouthfeel and flavor.

I am a big fan of Mario Batali, and we made this recipe from the new Babbo cookbook. This was good, but too salty. Maybe it was the pancetta we used? Does anyone know? I thought it would be good with just the parsnips.

I made this recipe this weekend and it was delicious! My husband and I had this dish at Po in NYC and was hoping to recreate it based on memory but was happy to find it here!! I doubled the pasta and the pancetta and added some sage to the parsley. I'll make this again.

I read this recipe and gasped. It calls for 8 oz of pasta and 2 lbs of parsnips. I doubled the pasta and halved the parsnips. The flavor was good but the recipe still had too much parsnips. I would use 1 lb of pasta and at most 1/2 lb of parsnips. As written above, this recipe should be renamed PARSNIPS WITH TAGLIATELLE AND PANCETTA.

Made this as a lenten dish with freeze dried smoked salmon, added after parsnips were cooked. Also added 2 sliced shallots, 2 cloves sliced garlic while cooking parsnips and then added sliced green onions along with parsley. Also added a 1/2 t. of cajon seasoning. And, used some olive oil along with the butter. Everyone loved it!...definitely a keeper..

We like pancetta, butter, parsnips, pasta, Italian parsley and parmesan. Yet, sorry to say, we found this recipe boring.

Great recipe! Except, it took me a while to discover the techique for "coring" the parsnips. This added time to the preparation. The dish was very different, a great combination of flavors..better the first day than the second. I highly recommend this recipe! And it was fun to make.

I have made this twice now, the first time with bacon as I did not have pancetta, and the second time with pancetta. It was great both ways, with not too much difference. I also cooked the parsnips a little longer until some were crispy. The leftovers were also good for lunch the next day, reheated in the microwave!!

For once I had all the ingredients and the fact that I didn't have to shop especially for this was one of the reasons I gave it a shot. I agree with one of the other reviews - more pancetta is definitly better. I also chopped the parnsips smaller and cooked them for longer - still browning not crisping (though the occassional cripsy bit was good!). Yes I'd make this again - it was a pleasant change. I've even decided to make epicurious my home page - it's fun to type in exisisting ingredients already in your kitchen and see what recipes come up. Only wish I had a prep crew & clean-up crew behind me!!

to the cook from ontario: pancetta is an unsmoked bacon, freuqently used in italian cooking.

Great and simple. To the gourmet from Ontario, pancetta is similar to bacon, although not smoked. Can be purchased at Italian delis. I work for one in Minneapolis, but I am sure you can find it at other fancy food shops. Good luck!

Could someone please tell me what Pancetta is and where you buy it. Have seen it called for in a number of different recipes and would like to try it

Quick, Simple and Wonderful. Depending on your preference for Pancetta vs. Parsnips, I would suggest using a little more Pancetta to enhance the flavor. Perhaps 1/3 to 1/2 pound.

Wow, this is good! I wasn't expecting something special because it was so simple to prepare. I'll defintely make this again, and I wouldn't change anything about the recipe - the amount of parsnips, in particular, is really well-balanced.
