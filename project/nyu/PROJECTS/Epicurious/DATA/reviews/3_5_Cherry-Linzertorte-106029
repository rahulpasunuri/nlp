Completely agree with the reviewer who said the spices were a distraction. I want a cherry tart, NOT a cinnamon tart. I made this, and the cinnamon is overpowering. I will leave out the cinnamon and reduce or omit the nutmeg next time. I used sour cherry preserves, which worked well here. I wish that I had made the crust into cookies to test this recipe out before using up my sour cherry preserves. I would have known to omit the spices and not wasted the jam. So, if you're making this the first time, make 1/2 recipe into cookies first.

I ha e made this recipe so many times. It is my go-to holiday dessert. It comes out perfectly every time and my family loves it. I use Hero brand preserves and pecans in the crust. It is relatively simple recipe that looks impressive and tastes great.

This was a very easy recipe, and the recommendation for imported preserves is also good -- makes a difference.

My grandmother made this exactly as written... shelled, roasted, and husked her own hazelnuts. I have told her it may not have been worth that amount of effort, but it is amazing. She used Bonne Maman cherry preserves from France available in our local grocery store. I would eat the torte just for those preserves. Wow! She thinks she will try this with almonds next time. I am anxious to compare. My best friend and I fought over the last piece.

I have made this twice now and have come to the conclusion that the spices are nothing but an unwelcome distraction. I halved the amount the second time, but still found they unpleasantly overpowered the dessert. As everything else was yummy, I think I will try again, but let the butter and nuts (I used almonds) speak for themselves.

A hit with a picky crowd! This was pretty easy to make, though the dough is delicate and broke when I was making the lattice. I used raspberry jam instead and it turned out great, and it looks very pretty when it is all done, with powdered sugar in top!!

This recipe was really very good, if a little labor-intensive. I substituted almonds for hazelnuts, and found the flavor to be quite different from what I remember of Linzertorte in Austria. Not bad, just different, very perfumy. I used seedless raspberry jam, since I associate raspberry so strongly with this type of cake. If and when I make it again, I'll make sure to get my hands on hazelnuts.

I used the St. Dalfour jam mixed with some cherry jam..you can use about anything I'm sure. I had the hazelnuts and so used those for the crust. Got lots of compliments. Definitely a keeper. The crust comes out brown with the hazelnuts making it look "healthy" even though it was high calorie. Friends definitely liked it.

This is a really wonderful recipe. The crust is tender & delicious. I've added a splash of kirsch to jazz up the store-bought cherry preserves. It's also adaptable to just about whichever nuts & preserves you have on hand. It presents beautifully, too.

I prepared this recipe for Christmas and everyone loved it! I found the baking powder caused it to rise quite a bit so keep that in mind when pouring the jam in the tart. The dessert in the BA photograph made it look very flat. I couldn't find cherry preserves so I used St. Dalfour mixed berry preserves and they worked beautifully. All in all, a keeper.

I made this recipe last night for Christmas dessert and it received rave reviews! I substituted walnuts (I had on hand)and seedless raspberry jam. Even the children were asking for seconds. The dessert reminded me of the linzertorte my Swiss uncle use to make! Yum!

This turned out beautifully! The presentation was very pretty and the flavor just perfect. I did substitute toasted almonds for the hazelnuts (as that is what I had on hand) and I will do that again in the future as we loved the flavor. I will make this again in the future for sure.

I made this for the holidays and people were WOW'd by it. It was pretty simple to make, and the flavors were well balanced. Everyone had seconds. I've also used this recipe with a mixed berry jam and it works equally well. This is a regular at our house now.

Followed the recipe instructions exactly. It was delicious. I used the leftover dough to make jam filled cookies. I got many compliments on both the tart and the cookies.

The preparation called for is needlessly complicated---you can make the entire dough in the processor: a) without dirtying an additional bowl; b) in one fewer step. Also, I rolled out the dough as I would any dough or crust--half I fitted into the tart shell, half I cut into strips. Much simpler, and works just as well if not better!

Delicious recipe and the cookies are great as well - simple to do as well.

I used a 9" square tart pan and I was concerned that there wouldn't be enough crust in the recipe. Luckily, since the recipe had extra for the cookies, this wasn't a problem. I served it for Christmas dessert and got raves.

I substituted fresh roasted chopped pecans for the hazelnuts and used red respberry jam. I served it at a Christmas Tea and it was a real hit. All the ladies who cook want the recipe. The extra dough makes excellent cookies that my husband and I polished off. I made the tort 2 days ahead and stored it in the refig. Great! Mary of LaQuinta California

We have actually made this 2 1/2 times. The 1/2 was for the cookies only - they are great with a little cinnamon and sugar on top. Next time I want to try this with apricot filling - I think the slight tartness would be good. For the lattice we just laid the strips in one direction and then the other, didn't worry about actually weaving them, and they liiked fine.

The recipe was great to make, simple and a bit time consuming. I'd like to see how to lace the crust topping. I know there is instruction somewhere, however I did not comit it to memory as I rarely make pies of any sort.
