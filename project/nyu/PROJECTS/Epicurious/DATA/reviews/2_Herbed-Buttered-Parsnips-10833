I just had to chime in here. I'm preparing this dish right now to bring to a dinner party/birthday celebration. I've made this recipe several times -- I think it's wonderful! I use a combination of carrots and parsnips. Love the herbs and lemon.

Blah. If I didn't know better, I'd think I have more left-over than I actually made! Not worth the little effort this dish required.

Blah. This was so uninteresting--if I didn't know better, I would suspect that I have more left-over than I actually made! Not worth even the little amount of work that this dish required.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I steamed the parsnips for a bit longer than caller for and they achieved a wonderfully sweet flavor. I also incorporated the leftovers as the bottom layer of a turkey casserole a day or two after Thanksgiving and it was great.
