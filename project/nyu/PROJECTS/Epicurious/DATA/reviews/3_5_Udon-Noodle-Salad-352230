This was really good! The dressing is so good, I would use it in other dishes as well. DELISH!

Delicious! I made this without tofu and edamame, since they weren't handy, and added in a chopped cooked chicken breast. The dressing is unusual, but added a lot of flavor and texture. I didn't add as much broth, and steamed nearly all of it off when cooking the broccoli, so mine wasn't soupy at all. 2 cups is a bit too much, I think.

This is good and the kids (teenagers) liked it too. I question leaving all the broth in: I ended up straining about 1/2 of it off before putting everything together. otherwise it would be too soupy I think.

I really enjoyed this recipe even though it didn't turn out how I thought. I added some sugar to the dressing and used more broccoli to substitute the peas. The end result seamed more like a veggie-filled pasta dish but the flavors are unique and very filling.
