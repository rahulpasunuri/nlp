This is our go-to recipe for the day after Thanksgiving. Wo omit the Pernod, and add chopped turkey. Not exactly a 1:1 exchange, but still tasty.

This recipe was delicious!! I used a whole fennel bulb expecting a bit more fennel flavor but the fennel flavor actually gets muted a bit. However the soup was great overall. I used half and half to cut down on the fat content a bit but the soup broke since I boiled the half and half with the soup like the recipe calls for. However once I pureed the soup with the immersion blender, you couldn't tell that the soup was broken earlier. My boyfriend and I both loved it!

I made 1/2 recipe for 6 people. I used no salt vegetable stock and added a little salt. I used less heavy cream and added some non fat milk. I decided against the Pernod because a bottle cost $24 and I didn't want to spend that much for something I wouldn't use. I served about 1/2 cup and it was plenty. It was very good and everyone raved.

Delicious but not wonderful. The flavors were subtle. I may try to experiment with more fennel

I skipped the Pernod, and this still turned out wonderfully.

This recipe is comparable to the soups made at my favorite fine dining restaurant. I rave about it to everyone all the time. (Note I said rave, not share!) I put it in single servings and put it in the freezer where it doesn't stay long. Like another reviewer said, I'd give it 10 forks if I could.

This is an outstanding recipe. I enhanced it only very slightly, by deep frying julienned fennel to use as a garnish. I expect caramelizing the fennel would be equally delicious. Instead of mixing in the Pernod, I drizzled it on top of each individual serving. Guests expected this to be olive oil and were delighted by the delicious Pernod flavour.

This soup was good and mild - a great accompaniment to a more flavorful main course.

While I am not a fan of fennel myself, my boyfriend cannot get enough of it and he LOVES this soup. He enjoys Pastis so it comes as no surprise that he has requested I make this regularly! In fact, based on his response, I think this may be the best received thing I've made him. I used a little less cream but otherwise changed nothing. So for those of you who are fennel-lovers, enjoy!

Very nice. It's refreshing to have a soup that is vegetable stock-based, rather than meat-based. What you need to know before pairing this with your main course is that this soup is quite sweet. I didn't find it as oppressively rich as the preamble to the recipe suggests, but because of the sweetness I wouldn't want a big bowl of it just the same.

Excellent. MIGHT consider using half and half next time since it was very rich but so very good! I omited the nutmeg and the pernod.It was great!

Absolutely delicious, though next time I will try it with more fennel. I substituted Cognac for the Pernod, I think it was a great touch. Be careful not to add too much nutmeg, and the proper amount of salt is key to really bringing out the flavour in this dish. It may taste a bit bland if there is not enough.

Delicious, only complaint was I found it hard to get it completely smooth as I imagine a bisque should be. Used fat-free half and half with excellent results.

Fantastic!! I left out the Pernod since I'm not a fan, but even without it the onion flavor is absolutely sublime. I will definitely serve this to guests!

This must be the most impressive restaurant quality soup ever ever made! Seriously, this should get a 10 star rating. The depth of taste is amazing. I did not use Pernod or any anise liquor because i just forgot to pick it up. So, without it you have no anise-y flavour from the fennel but just a brilliant soup. I used half fat creme fraiche (available everywhere in London) but think sour cream could be substituted for the cream if wanted. I added a bit more wine which did not evaporate completely. I would make this for Queen Elizabeth given the chance. I never raved this much before.

wonderful and creamy. the rest of my family went nuts. I was expecting something with a bit more zing, but it was still very rewarding.

my bisque turned out quite well, and i'd be pleased to serve it for company. i'm thinking about adding some good rich mushrooms, too, to add some earthiness.

Unbelievably delicious; everyone loved from my 4-year-old to my parents! Amazing depth of flavor; not overly anise-y, rich, creamy and perfect with a nice chewy foccacia bread.

this a really great soup. yummy. it has depth and complex flavors that blend really good. I used creme fraiche (which was not liquid, bizarrely) instead of the whipped cream, and I would guess one could do without cream because it's so rich.

This recipie was amazing. A definiate must have for any elegant evening dinner, or wonderful gourmet lunch.

People People what is wrong with you all ?? Buy a tiny bottle of Pernod for $3.00 to have in your cupboard along with your other flavourings or substitute something else. Everyone whining about having to buy a big bottle...hmmmmm.

Excellent! This soup makes a fine start to a formal dinner with a robust main course. Flavours are subtle and intriguing. I've made this several times to rave reviews. Guests requested the recipe.

Great recipe that appeals to kids also - (but I didnt use the Pernod...)

We also served this as a first course for our Christmas dinner and all of our guests loved it. Topped each serving with a little fennel frond for color. It was easy to make and delicious.

Excellent recipe. Wonderful blending of flavors. Will make again and again. I did not have Pernod on hand so I mixed in a little Sambuca. Came out great.

Excellent and easy. Definitely splurge and buy the Pernod and consider doubling the amount.

I thought this recipe was even better a day or 2 later. On the ongoing question of what liqueur to use - I substituted Ricard for the Pernod. Both are different brands of 'pastis', a French liqueur that is typically mixed with 5 parts water to 1 part 'pastis' for a refreshing summer drink. Neither one would be a burden to have around the house after using only 2 teaspoons in the soup!

My husband made this as our first course for Christmas dinner - we doubled the recipe even though only 7 diners. It was fabulous - all is gone! So velvety. Rich, but subtly flavored by the fennel and Pernod. Easy to make. We made 2 days ahead which was very convenient.

Perhaps the so-soness of the soup was due to my substituting arak for pernod. i'll give it another shot.

COLORADO: maybe you should consider looking for an entirely different recipe? If you don't like anise flavor, why would you make an Onion and FENNEL soup?

Can anyone think of a liquor they would substitute if they didn't like the taste of anise?

To the person who does not have need for a large bottle of Pernod: Many liquor stores sell "miniatures." If Pernod is not available as miniature, then substitute another anise flavored liqueur like Strega.

This sounds interesting but I'm not about to go out and buy a bottle of pernod to use two tsp in a recipe. Has anyone tried omitting it, or is there maybe an anise extract (or something else) I could substitute?

Wine adds sour & slight sweet & pernod adds depth, as it is a liquor. Just if you were were interested.

I find the recipe interesting and I am going to try it out. But I do not see the function of wine since you add perned which is so strong a flavor such as to obkliterate all the others and especially a small quantity of white wine?
