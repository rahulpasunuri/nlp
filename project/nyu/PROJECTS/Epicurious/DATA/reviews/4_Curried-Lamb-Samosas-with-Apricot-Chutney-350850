We made good use of our leftover grilled boneless leg of lamb by finely mincing it in this recipe, and following it as though it were fresh (with slightly less cooking time). We did not put it in the food processor. Potatoes were also cut finely. In addition, we used egg roll wrappers. It was spectacular. We just fell in love with this recipe.

I made these at first and they were rather bland and dry. The next time I added to the filling one half cup of crushed corn flakes and a half pound of crispy bacon, lightly crumbled. Dee-lish! It has beome a holiday favorite at our house

These were a bit time consuming, but not difficult and so worth it. We needed more water to get the dough to the correct consistency, but otherwise we made no changes. My husband keeps asking me to make this again!
