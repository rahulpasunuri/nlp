These are the best stuffed dates I have ever eaten, and I love dates - I order them everytime I see them offered on a menu - so I have had quite a few variations. You don't need to go through the added step of making a walnut paste, if you chop the nuts fine enough the filling will still work. I also had more dates than filling so I stuffed the rest with blue cheese and walnuts and finished those in the same way. Those were a big hit as well! Add cayenne pepper to the oil for an even spicier kick.

This delectable offering was our Cinco de Mayo appetizer and it won over even timid eaters. Like other reviewers we find powdered ancho chili oftentimes bitter. Our alternative was to use the adobo sauce from jarred chipotle peppers, diluted with a touch of olive oil. Made for spicy drizzling!

Excellent!!! and so different from the usual cocktail party fare. People raved. I substituted Sri Cha...brand asian hot chili sauce for the ancho chili oil called for, which i made and did not like--it was bitter. The Sri sauce was a perfect flavor and added the heat to the sweet/savory stuffed dates. Will repeat this again and again.

I already had ancho chile flakes in oil, so I used that. I substituted halvah for the walnuts and lemon zest for the orange. I also left out the ham because I keep kosher. (Yes, my recipe has adulterated the original.) It was fabulous and the other people eating the dates loved them as well.

I prepared this dish exactly as written and although I thought it had a nice taste there was plenty left over. Unless you have known date lovers coming for dinner I would not recommend preparing this appetizer. I have to say when I put the dish out I thought to myself, "Oh my goodness it looks like I'm serving fried butterfly chrysalis!"

Absolutely delicious. These were prepared for me at a New Years Eve party and I can't wait to make them for myself!

A wonderful taste, but was disappointed with the waste of money involving the proscuitto ham. I found that I wasted half the ham due to it tearing when I attempted to wrap the dates. Still they were a hit at the cocktail party at which they were served, and I will probably make them again.
