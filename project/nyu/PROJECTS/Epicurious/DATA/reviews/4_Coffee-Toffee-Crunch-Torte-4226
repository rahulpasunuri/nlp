Time intensive but well worth it. My kids request this as their birthday cake.

Absolutely delicious. Used some nilla wafers and some graham crackers for the crust since thats what I had on hand. Would put more of the ganache in the filling since I had a lot leftover after making the lattice topping. I would increase the espresso powder a bit since I LOVE coffee flavor. Fabulous recipe. Phenomenal recipe according to all those that got the pleasure to try a piece!!! Heaven on earth

made this for a summer BBQ and it was fantastic. The only changes I made were to use some crushed nilla wafers and some crushed graham crackers for the crust. I also used the Heath toffee bits found in the baking aisle rather than crushing candy bars. I also used light corn syrup rather than dark This was great since it could be made in advance and it makes a WOW presentation

This was a delicious cake& worth all of the effort. I loved that I could make it a week in advance. Tasted great, looked great, what more could one ask for!

I thought this recipe was pretty good. It was about a 7 out of 10 in my guests' opinion. A little less than 1/2 of my guests thought I should keep the recipe. It is labor intensive and melts too quickly. I think it will be better to make in my ice cream maker adding chunks of the crust in it, instead.

One of my favorite all-time dessert recipes. Unbelievably rich and creamy!

Yummy! First, the crust is deliciously amazing. Toasting the almonds makes a big difference. For the filling, I decreased the coffee grinds, but increased the Kahlua; I also had to serve quickly, so stabilized the whipped cream with a little gelatin. As a result, the dessert was less like ice cream and more like Kahlua-flavored stiff whipped cream with toffee pieces. It was absolutely scrumptious! I served with some Kahlua drizzled on top for emphasis. Would highly recommend this dessert as a treat, even for those who don't really love coffee.

I have been making this dessert for years. It is time consuming, but worth the work. Everyone goes crazy about it every time. MMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...

The crust is outstanding! The frozen mousse is very good but it starts to melt quickly (especially if served outdoors!). I plan to try this recipe using a good coffee ice cream instead of making the mousse - I think the final result will be pretty close.

Extremely rich. Made for work birthday party and it was a big hit. But cut small pieces as it is so rich! Could maybe use a calorie cut down and it would still be terrific.

This is delicious and impressive. I swirled the ganache in to marbelize it vs. spreading it over the top. I garnished the edges with almonds and Heath bites. It was beautiful. I love that you can make it ahead. Allow to soften for about 10 minutes before cutting.

We searched long for a special desert for a special occaision, and this did not disappoint! Please do note that it needs to freeze OVERNIGHT! We didn't see that part at first, and ended up eating it after about 5 hours in the freezer. It was way too sweet and overpowering. But the next day...it was a whole different ball game. It took about an hour and a half to put together, minus freezing time. Easy enough, but needs to be made in advance. Next time maybe I'll halve the mousse and make part of it with more chocolate.

I made this last night for a dinner party. It was a big hit with all the guests. I love to bake and bake for my friends and family often. My guests (including my husband) said this is the best dessert I have ever made. It was also beautiful.

Awesome!! This recipe is great and was a big hit with the family, but very very time consuming to make! I highly recommend it if you have time.

We loved this recipe, very rich, but incredible. I used instant swiss mocha instead of the espresso and it was fabulous. Fairly labour intensive but worth it!

This recipe was really something - but it took longer to make than I expected. Its beauty lies in the fact that it can be made in advance. Overall whilst it looked and tasted great - it was too rich for me. I would certainly use the biscuit base again.

Great dessert, easy to prepare. Ganache lattice top was very impressive looking. Next time I'll cut back on the nutmeg since I'm not a huge fan. With the coffee, chocolate and toffee flavors I didn't feel the nutmeg was necessary.

I made this for a family dinner and my mother (who is VERY picky!) was at a loss for words after her first bite. This is by far one of the best desserts we have ever tasted. The ganache is a perfect topping (be creative with your topping design!) and it is not hard to make at all. It does seem to melt easily so keep it frozen to the last minute before serving :)

A wonderful make-ahead recipe that is practically foolproof. Not nearly as complicated as you'd think, and a great combination of flavors. Great presentation, too! Adapted this for a family member who cannot eat almonds by adding an extra cup of Bordeaux cookie crumbs and leaving out the almond garnish. Will definitely be making this again.

A friend made this for our dinner club last night. I loved it.

Great recipe, except I found the coffee flavor too strong. Next time I will use 2 tbs. coffee powder instead of 3. I did not have time to pipe the ganache, so I layered half of the mousse, drizzled half of the ganache over and swirled, and repeated the layers. It looked beautiful and the cake was done a day ahead!!

I've already made this recipe a couple of times in the last few years. The mixture of flavours is wonderful. Yes it's a bit expensive, but worth it for any special occasion, especially in the summer months!

Yes, this was expensive, but was well worth it. It is comparable to some of the best and richest desserts I've had in really good restaurants. Impressive to serve to company as well.

This was delicious! It's like the creamiest, richest mocha toffee ice cream you ever tasted! Delicious crust too!

my husband is still raving about this dessert 2 years later. Although it is rather labor-intensive, the results are worth every effort. This is a wonderful ending to either a special family dinner or when entertaining.

The mousse in this recipe turned out much softer than I expected, but I suppose that's why it's a frozen dessert! The texture of the frozen torte resembled a premium-quality ice cream. I doubled the ganache and served the torte with chocolate sauce since I'm a chocolate freak and would recommend that fellow chocoholics do so. It's possible to halve the recipe and make it in a loaf pan if you don't mind a rather different shape.

very good. took lomger to make than I would have thought-several hours. I recommend cutting it right out of the freezer, but letting it sit a few minutes so it is slightly soft-it gets to more of a mousse consistency, rather than hard ice cream. one note, the coffee flavor is very strong-I will probably add less next time.

This was great, except...I put it in the fridge for an hour because I was afraid it would be hard to cut. It got too soft. Serve it frozen. Also, have a very sharp knife for cutting the crust. It is very hard. I used a serrated knife for the leftovers and it went much better. Still, everyone loved it. (Note: this is expensive to make. I spent about $25 on ingredients, including $6 for toffee bits.)

I hope to make this soon-can someone please advise how it is served, i.e., straight from the freezer, thawed at all, brought to room temp, etc. I'd really appreciate it!

This dish was wonderful. I've made it several times and everyone is really impressed. Stays wonderfully in the freezer, so even if you have leftovers just put it in the freezer for a rainy day. You cant be on a diet with this one!!

I have to concur with the masses--this was absolutely outstanding. Don't hesitate to make it several days in advance--it holds perfectly and the flavors seem to improve, too (if that's possible). I was worried (unnecessarily, as it turned out) about having enough ganache for the lattice, so I piped it rather wide. Since the spaces were large, I piped stars in the center each space as well as a generous border around the edge, and it looked fantastic.

This dessert is absolutely fabulous and makes an impressionable presentation!! Recipe is easy, but a little time consuming.....totally well worth it, though!

This is an easy yet elegant dessert. I would make it in a minute and have also given the recipe to friends who have enjoyed it.

This one is a winner. Not the least because it can be made ahead, kept in the freezer - and makes a stunning presentation. The initial ingredients are expensive but once you have them on hand - coffee powder and corn syrup - it can be made again for a reasonable cost. Yum Yum Yum

I make this at least once a year, usually in the summer. Usually after a porcini risotto or a pesto pasta. It really finishes the meal nicely. Also, I pipe the ganache with a star tip and do a border with a 1/2 slice of almond on each star. It's a great dessert.

LOOK AT THE INGREDIENTS - WHAT COULD BE BAD?
