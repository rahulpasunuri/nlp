I used a spicy chorizo and it made it quite spicy. Next time I would use a more mild version.

i wanna update my review... without the milk, only using 1/3 cup crema, this is no strata... but the leftovers still kill lol

Did not prepare overnight, and I merely used the recipe as a guide. I sauteed half a sweet yellow onion, set aside. Sauteed only 6 oz of "super picante" mexican chorizo, drained, then added the chilies and onions and cooked a couple minutes longer. I cubed enough italian bread to fill bottom of 8x8 pyrex dish sprayed with olive oil, then spooned the chorizo mix on top. I omitted cumin and salt, and instead of milk, I whisked about 1/3 cup mexican crema (sour cream) into the eggs, added fresh ground black pepper to taste, and poured that over, topping with about a cup of grated queso quesadilla (part skim milk cheese). As it wasn't refrigerated beforehand, baking time cut considerably. Covered with foil, cooked for 25 min., removed foil and baked another 15 minutes. Perhaps not as spicy as original recipe, yet it was delicioso nonetheless. I topped mine with freshly made salsa.

I used artisanal chorizo from my friend's farm and roasted Hatch peppers. It was delicious. Tasted great with mimosas and made for a delightful New Year's Day brunch.

I cut the calories in 1/2 by using Soyrizo,Eggbeaters,1/2 Soy Jack Cheese & 1/2 Pepperjack Cheese.Nobody could tell the difference especially all the Meat & Potato Men in my family.

Good flavor, interesting texture. I used sliced italian instead of sourdourgh.

This is a great breakfast casserole that ALWAYS gets rave reviews at my table. I swap out meat chorizo in favor of the meatless Soyrizo to cut fat and calories. Soyrizo is really flavorful and guests never know the difference. Honest. The do ahead element of this dish makes entertaining a breeze!

Fully believing a recipe is a guideline, not a law, I made this for Christmas brunch with venison chorizo, Eggbeaters (plus one white left over from a Christmas Eve dessert), and skim milk fortified with a little heavy cream; cubed a whole loaf of sourdough and tossed rather than layering. Easy, delicious, and certainly a keeper!

I used Soyrizo (we don't have Mexican-style chorizo up here in Canada, but I had a stash of Soyrizo thankfully) and fresh chili peppers. I used only about 2 cups of milk because I don't like very "wet" stratas. Turned out really well.

This was a big hit with my brunch guests. I made two versions - one with chorizo and one without. The chorizo makes a big difference, but be warned, the dish is quite spicy. That was fine for this crowd, but others might find it a bit much. I didn't read the directions and thus did not assemble the night before - this didn't seem to make a difference. Will definitely keep this recipe on file for future reference.

I used La Preferida hot chorizo and pepperjack cheese. I like spicy food but my mouth was on fire! Next time I will use the mild chorizo or regular jack cheese. I left the crusts on the bread and it fit perfectly into a 8x8 pyrex. It did bubble over a little in the oven but I just put a sheet of foil underneath.

My good friend made this recipe for a brunch and served a big crowd this dish - to everyone's delight! I thought it was delicious and am still having cravings for more. The one change that she made was to substitute chorizo for spicy turkey sausage and I thought it was a great taste. Definitely serve this at your next brunch!

I highly recommend this recipe. I made this for a weekend brunch and it was a huge hit. I used hot turkey sausage instead of chorizo (one of my guests does not eat pork or beef) and 1 extra egg and it turned out perfect. I also left the crust on the bread which I would also do again.

I have made this twice for large brunches and both times my guests have raved about it. I use hot italian sausage instead of chorizo and the results are delicious! Rebecca D.

Love it! I used Neiman Ranch Spanish chorizo (the dry type), chopped in small dice, rather than the Mexican chorizo with the casing. I left the crust on a loaf of very good quality sourdough bread. he Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Very flavorful and a godsend for breakfast when you have houseguests.

Rating: 2
This was good and spicey, and very rich. Next time I would use less chorizo, perhaps 1/2 lb. Also, I used a little more bread than it calls for and I still wanted more. Next time I would use 8 or 9 slices of bread, and leave SOME of the crust on, it gives a nice texture.

WOW! I do brunch a couple of Sundays each month, and needed some new inspiration, as my guests have interesting palates - this didn't dissapoint! Use a good chorizo and drain/pat well. Added 2 extra eggs as mine was a bit dry and added another 3/4 c cheese to the top. I would definitely serve a salsa on the side, maybe a mango/peach or a cilantro based salsa if you like the flavor of cilantro. Cubing the bread into large pieces does make it easier, but leave the crusts on as that adds to the texture. Easily the best dish I've done for brunch and making it the night before is a lifesaver...

I've made chorizo and eggs for years, but had some leftover bread I wanted to use. Used mozarella instead of pepper jack, and didn't have cilantro, but this was great anyway. Very easy. Will try with soyrizo next time.

Very good! Misread ingredients and used sourdough baguette instead. I had croutons instead of slices of bread. The country "rednecks" girls at work loved it. I had to explain strata 5X!

I thought just pretty good, but offered two brunch dishes to my guests and they loved it. I think it may have too many green flavors competing. For one, I love cilantro and probably packed my 1/2 cup, so maybe went too far. But after that I think I'd just use regular montery jack cheese and the green chilis. Also, increase the amount of cheese on top to maybe 1 cup. That will keep the top from getting too brown. I'd also offer some fresh salsa with it the next time.

Unbelievably good, and easy. Made it for Christmas brunch, substituting soyrizo (as recommended by previous reviewers) for our vegetarian guest, substituted (HOT) roasted hatch green chiles for canned, and regular jack for pepper jack. Cubed the bread, and used a souffle dish - this was not just gorgeous but delicious. Everyone (even the non-vegetarians) raved.

The only change I made was to use 2% milk instead of whole. I was afraid it would be too spicy for those with timid palates, but everyone devoured it.

I thought I would love this dish but it was disappointing, even a bit gross. My guests said good things, but perhaps were just being polite.

I realize that I'm very much in the minority, but I was VERY disappointed in this. I used high quality chorizo and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was dry and in spite of the chorizo and pepper jack, it was just plain boring. Needless to say, I will not be wasting my time with this again.

My all time favorite strata because it's just a little different. The recipe works perfectly as is, but I've also made it with Bob Evan's regular breakfast sausage and roasted Anaheim peppers and it was still wonderful.

This was fabulous. I served it with fresh salsa and mixed the cilantro with some sour cream and lime juice as a sauce. My guests raved.

I made this dish for Xmas breakfast and my family really enjoyed it. I didn't add the cilantro because not all of my family enjoys it, and I only used about half the chorizo called for because it was so spicey and we have some mild paletes in our family, and it was still incredibly flavorable. Great for a brunch, very easy.

This dish was terrific for a breakfast potluck at work. I put it together the night before and popped it in the oven in the morning. It was a big hit at the office. Next time, I think I"ll try the soy chorizo so that vegetarians can enjoy it too.

I had a brunch for a vegetarian friend and made this with a product called SOYrizo. It was outstanding! Everyone raved, especially the people who normally eat pork! I will absolutly make this again

I did not have any problems with extra liquid. Instead of Monterey Jack I used something called "Southwestern Jack" that was the only spicy grated cheese mix available at our neighborhood supermarket. It's a mixture of Monterey Jack, Colby, and peppers. I took it to work for a potluck breakfast, and it was one of the first dishes to disappear.

Rating: 2
Although very tasty I couldn't get it to cook in the time allotted. I made it both in a round casserole dish and a flatter baking dish. By the time it was cooked the top was too crusty. Everyone liked it and they want me to make it again but I will try and use less liquid in the future.

I prepared this dish Christmas Eve and served it for Christmas Day breakfast. All seven people thought it was delicious! I will definatly make it again and again. I added a couple extra eggs to keep it moist.

Rating: 3
Excellent flavor. The only reason I gave it 3 forks is because it is sooo high in fat!! but we have to indulge sometime. I made this for Christmas day brunch for my family and it was a huge hit. It is simple to make and although we like spicy food, I may leave out the 1/4 teaspoon pepper - it just doesn't need it. Cubing the bread does sound like a good idea for next time. You could add another can of the chilies though. I served it with fresh fruit.

Rating: 3
A different egg entree for a brunch that can be prepared ahead of time. This got good reviews from my guests. I used 2% milk and substituted egg whites for 2 of the eggs since my bread was so old and dry. I also did not remove the sausage casings to save time... I cooked it and cut it into rounds. No one complained. I would add extra cumin the next time.

I made this dish for my birthday brunch. It was great, although a bit spicy for some folks. I used real chorizo sausage and roasted hatch chilies.....when I make this dish again, the only thing I'll change is using regular Monterey Jack instead of pepper jack to cut down on the spice. I did follow other people's advice and cubed the bread.

Made several times. Substituted hot Italian sausage once, and zipped it up with some extra spice and peppers (including chopped fresh red bell peppers). The gang enjoyed the dish just as well. But when available, I prefer the chorizo sausage.

SUPER! I made this dish for family who were staying with us, and it got rave reviews all around. I did substitute roasted Hatch green chiles for the canned, as we native Texans tend to favor hot and spicy. I'll be making this a part of the regular weekend rotation.

I keep trying different strata, because everybody seems to love them. This was the best of the lot so far, but honestly, the texture of strata is just....wierd. Mushy. Like badly done stuffing with eggs, or something. I dunno. It's probably just me.

This is delicious, but really, really hot. I cubed the bread also and due to a lack of chorizo used hot Itlaian sausage. It smelled like pizza when I was cooking the sausage but the final dish tasted great and all the flavors blended well. The advance preparation makes this an even more attractive recipe for houseguests, as long as they like spicy food. Will be using this again for sure.

AMAZING!!! Great brunch dish for guests with a passion for "hot & spicy". I cubed the bread and used fresh Cubano chilies instead of canned..... WOW! Certainly "a keeper".

I really rate this a 2.5, but I'll give the recipe the benefit of the doubt since I think I did something wrong. This is the 2nd strata I've made, and each time the baking time had to be extended a *lot* since there was a *ton* of liquid in the pan! I drained excess liquid out twice, and still had to bake it for an extra 1/2 hour! I can't figure out what happened, but I'll just have to keep tinkering with the recipes til I get it right. Still, it was very tasty and very spicy, my boyfriend said we should have had a beer with it instead of coffee (and really, it was after noon so we could have!)

Rating: 4
Wow - This is a keeper. Don't even make it unless you have good quality chorizo. It was spicy and looked beautiful (sometimes stratas look like a cooked sponge). Will cube bread next time. It's a lot of prep work the day before, but it's worth it. When you pop it in the oven and the house starts to smell wonderful and it looks like you've been cooking all morning don't tell it was all done the day before. Perfect for house guests and the holidays. Served with warm flour tortillas and sprigs of cilantro. With good chorizo, salsa is superfluous.

UNREAL! I took this to a brunch and it was the first entree to go! Be advised to have prep work -bread crusts cut off- done prior to beginning recipe. I added fresh jalapeno for a little extra kick.

Everyone loved it. Just the right amount of spicyness, using a hot Italian chorizo. I would serve with some nice melon to compliment the flavour next time.

Very flavorful! I prepared the strata by cuting the bread into 1" cubes and baking in a 13x9x2 inch baking dish as suggested by other strata recipes on Epicurious and it worked fine. Griddled Tomato-Chipotle Salsa(from "Southwestern Vegetarian" by Stephan Pyles) was a great addition; without a salsa I think it would have been too dry. The whole dish was completely devoured by 4 people!

My family and I love chorizo & this dish was a nice change! I did substitute the canned chiles with roasted chiles. This is a yummy dish that I'm sure I'll prepare again..

I was really surprised that others felt this dish didn't have any flavor considering the ingredients. I made this recipe and only added a sprinkling of chili powder on top for more color. Accompanied with some fresh homemade salsa this dish was a hit!!!! Everyone enjoyed it and asked for the recipe.

Rating: 4
This is fabulous. The finicky eaters in the family loved it. The texture of pepper cheese irritates me so I used regular jack with extra home-rasted green chilies. If you cook the chorizo long enough and drain it very well on paper towels it will not be a greasy dish. I even added extra cheese on the top! YUM!

Great dish for an early breakfast meeting, since it is assembled the night before. I used bulk turkey sausage instead of chorizo and it was wonderful.

All in all I found this strata rather boring. If I were to make it again (and I probably will not) I would add extra zip in the way of pepper flakes or even jalapenos. I also agree with other review that it's a tad on the greasy side.

I made this for Mother's Day brunch and it was a huge success. It was easy to make and a good break from the regular egg casserole I usually make. This one is definitely a keeper.

I love othe taste of dead animals under my toungue so I naturally loved this recipe. Truly, it was very good but could use a little more spice, maybe even just some spicy salsa to spoon over it. Actually easy to make and a group of eight all wanted the recipe. P.S. East Coasters have no idea what chorizo is.

I made this recipe for brunch and it was a crowd-pleaser. I could not find uncooked Chorizo, so removing the casing and crumbling the sausage was a bit time consuming. I would definitely use medium or hot chiles if I made it again. I was kind of disappointed in the spice level, but it was still quite good.

This dish is wonderful, flavorful and a real crowd pleaser - I made it for a brunch - and everyone raved. Because chorizo is high in fat, and not the healthiest thing for you, I used SOYrizo...simply chorizo made of soy instead of all the "bad" stuff. It tastes great and worked wonderfully in the recipe. Try it as a healthy alternative!

This is so great! The second time I made it, I added piementoes. Spicy and wonderful for a change!
