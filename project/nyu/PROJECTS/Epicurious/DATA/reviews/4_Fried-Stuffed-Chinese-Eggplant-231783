This dish came together fast and was quite tasty. I love eggplant and was looking for a different way to serve it. I added a bit more ginger to the filling as I also enjoy that particular ingredient. Served with some veggie fried rice and that yummy dipping sauce made from soy sauce and rice vinegar that you get sometimes with chinese take-out steamed dumplings. I would definitely make this again, only I will try using the asian variety of eggplant so the pieces would be smaller. The Italian variety makes them almost too big--like a small burger size. Also soaked up quite a bit of the oil; maybe will use a deep fryer next time to lessen the oil absorption.

Additional comment... uncooked eggplant does not freeze well at all. Doesn't cook properly afterwards, even when defrosted through. Recommend make and cook in one go.

Great comfort food. Recipe is exactly like at our Northern Chinese restaurant which is always full. Without a thermometer, it's difficult to know when the meat inside is cooked so a bit of trial and error works.

Was a little confusing at first, a picture accompanying the recipe would have helped! But real yummy!
