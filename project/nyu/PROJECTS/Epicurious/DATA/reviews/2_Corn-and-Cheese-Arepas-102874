Very simple and easy to make. They are just simple corncakes alone, but they are wonderful for sopping up the delicious extra Lime Mojo. I'll be trying these with other dishes that produce excess sauce.

Nice cool and sweet compliment to the Spicy Lime Mojo.

I found these to be a waste of time. I thought that these would be a good way to carry some of the lime mojo that was spooned over the pork but they were not worth the effort.

Just fair, but still good with the pork with lime mojo.

These did not taste good. At all.
