We thought this was only okay. The sausage (and we used half sweet, half spicy) overwhelmed the fava bean--which were my whole rationale for making it. Kind of a disappointment.

Instead of high-maintenance favas, which are also hard to get except at spring farmers' markets, I used shelled edamame. Yummy and not too heavy.

I loved this super-easy pasta dish. I used fresh fettucine but otherwise followed the recipe as-is. Lots of flavor!

great recipe, however, it's 4 servings not 8.

So tasty! I made a vegetarian version using sausage-style veggie protein (available at whole foods and most supermarkets) and it was delicious. I also had fava beans from my CSA so they were super fresh. Yum!

Easy, fast, and tastey. I was heavy handed w/the red pepper, which gave it a kick but was still good. I used spicy Italian not sweet sausage.

Very good,different. It seemed like it needed a little something, maybe more parmesan cheese.

This recipe is definitely a 4, but only if you use the freshest ingredients! I wait all year for favas to be in season from our local farm, and this is my family's favorite recipe without a doubt. We spent the morning making pasta, but if you aren't a teacher with the summer off, fresh pasta from the farmer's market will surely suffice:).

I received fresh fava beans in a CSA delivery. I've never prepared fava beans before & was looking for the right recipe. This was certainly it. The favas were a pain to prepare, but it was worth it. (I had a hard time not eating them all before putting them in the recipe.)

I found it a bit bland, but maybe I just added too many hot pepper flakes and ruined the delicate balance with all that heat.

I very much enjoyed this dish. The grocery store was out of fresh fava beans so I had to use fresh green peas instead, but I thought it still turned out great. Easy and tasty.

this dish is quite different from most of my cooking, but it was fabulous! very simple to make but surprisingly flavorful. i used one mild and one spicy italian sausage from the butcher, cooked favas from trader joe's (brown, not green), and fresh egg fettucine, and left out the cheese (not a fan). the only thing i would say is that the recipe calls for a bit more pasta than i would recommend--there seemed to be more pasta than sauce. also, though only cooking for two i made all the pasta at once to mix with the sauce as instructed; next time i'd cook just enough for two servings, because i suspect when i reheat the fresh pasta it will turn to mush. otherwise, YUM!

I made this using favas that come in a small tub/container (got them from Whole Foods). I also used slightly sweet (as opposed to spicy) Italian sausage...just under two links' worth. This was my first time making homemade pasta, so I might have ever so slightly cooked the pasta too long. I followed the recipe here on epicurious (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/FRESH-PASTA-107835 ) but used semolina instead of cake flour. That recipe for pasta is great but it doesn't give you even a rough guideline of how long you're supposed to cook it for. Either way, my dinner guests and I agree that this was one of the most flavorful yet simple dishes ever had at someone's home.

This recipe was divine. As soon as I saw it in Bon Appetit, I knew it would be for me, but I had to wait until the fava beans came in. I used fresh favas, tomatoes, and hot turkey sausage all from the Union Square market and served it over polenta instead of pasta. The flavors were delicate and worked incredibly well together; you could also taste each ingredient individually.

I made this with all the wrong ingredients based on what I hadcorn spaghetti, pancetta and strained tomatoes (I know, ick). I did, however, have fresh fava beans. The result was actually delicious, so I can imagine the correct ingredients would make it even more so. Fresh fava beans are a treat, if youve never tried them. And they add the most amazing green color (even when swimming in strained tomatoes).

delish! I was cooking at last minute so didn't have time to find fava beans and used frozen peas instead, also used canned San Marzano tomatoes, but it was still delicious. Of course fresh pasta a la http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/FRESH-PASTA-107835 helps.

This was easy and very tasty. I think fresh pasta and fresh favas are a must, but I did try canned diced tomatoes (per the suggestion from the reviewer from Milan, since it was colder weather today)...it was great.

This recipe was fantastic!!! Also see www.BrazilWine.com Enjoy!

Made this exactly as per recipe and found it to be good authentic Italian. Fresh favas are a must, but you could also leave them out if you do not like them. Having decent fresh plum tomatoes and a good Italian sausage with the white wine make this outstanding. Although I liked the fresh lasagna sheets cut in irregular shapes, I think a pappardelle would be good too. P.S. I've lived in Italy and know authentic Italian.

I used a mild pork sausage from Whole Foods and it had almost NO flavor. I usually would have used spicy but they had none. It was a disappointment because of this only I think. I don't know if I'll try it again tho.

To the reviewer that used frozen lima beans, I say Of course its going to taste terrible!  I used fresh fava beans (which are a moderate pain to prep&but worth it) and was very happy with the results. I substituted a dry red wine (since I had no white available).My only complaint was that the delicate flavor of the fava beans was a little overwhelmed (the red wine?). Next time Ill try chicken sausages.

The combination of ingredients is delicious, but I found that a lot of pecorino was needed to bring out the flavour of the sausage. For a wintry version I'd recommend using more olive oil and more sausage and tinned tomatoes to make a richer sauce that's delicious with any robust dried pasta shapes.

We really enjoyed this recipe with fresh fava beans and fresh homemade pasta. We used canned tomatoes and it was great.

It was really simple and fast...good weeknight meal. pasta sheets were a great carrier for the thin sauce.

This dish was more than I expected. I was just looking for a simple and quick recipe, and I saw this and was intrigued by the fava beans. They made all the difference. At first you think it's just sausage and tomatoes, but the fava beans add a whole new depth. Fresh pasta is absolutely necessary for this dish as it soaks up all the good sauce.

I thought this was a delicious and easy pasta dish. I used frozen fava beans (be sure to allow time to unpeel each fava bean if you need. That added 20 minutes to meal prep). And I think using fresh pasta adds to the delicacy of the dish
