I made this as a dessert for Thanksgiving. It was plenty sweet, but the addition of cinnamon and a hint of nutmeg made it a hit (think apple pie a la mode).

Cut the sugar in half, still plenty sweet. Great last minute dessert!

This made an easy, tasty dessert. I used dried cranberries. Next time I may add a few chopped walnuts.

This was very simple to make and extreamly tasty. I would surely make this again. My children liked it better without the cherries.
