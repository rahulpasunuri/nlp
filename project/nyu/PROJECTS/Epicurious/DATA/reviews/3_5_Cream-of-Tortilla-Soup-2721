Yummy! Very thick...I might start with more broth or less tortilla chips to see if that thins it out a little. Used diced tomatoes rather than fresh, made sure that the tortilla chips were crushed to cornmeal consistency, topped the soup with some avocado along with the other garnishes. Big hit with the whole family -- kid friendly and pretty addictive for the adults.

The soup is AMAZING. Definitely a new favorite. I replaced the whipping cream with greek yogurt for a healthier option.

I couldn't believe it when I went on here and saw that I hadn't reviewed this recipe! I love this. It showed up at our dinner club several years ago to raves from all. I have continued to make it and can't believe anyone would NOT like it.....I do like the original, but almost always add chicken these days as it makes it more of a hearty meal.

This is the best ever cream of tortilla soup. I've been making it since 1991. My kids all love it, even the finicky ones. It freezes well. If you need to wow someone - this is the soup! I make a batch and freeze if for Christmas and birthday presents. Put the crushed tortillas chips on at the last minute to give it the crunchy texture.

This is delicious. I substituted: - olive oil instead of the butter - feta instead of chedder - vache qui rit instead of jack I wonder how it freezes?

This was a delicious soup. I added the spices, cumin and chili powder to the chicken broth at the start. I think that using cilantro or chives becomes a personal or what's available choice. I had pepper jack cheese so this was pleasantly spicey. I crushed the tortilla chips as a previous reviewer suggested - to coarse corn meal and did not sense crushed chips in the soup, but a blending of textures and tastes.

This soup was delicious! I made it for a friends birthday party and all the guests raved about it. It was so good I made it a second time a few days later for my family. My husband loved it so it must be good! Definetly would keep this recipe. The only thing I didn't do was add the flour in. The soup thickend up on its own. Enjoy!

Not your traditional tortilla soup at all, although I love that kind too. Think of this as a cheesy cream soup instead. I always add a bit of diced cooked chicken, a couple of handfuls of frozen corn and a tablespoon or two of diced sweet red pepper (I keep some chopped and frozen on hand). This soup has become a standby when I need a quick and easy, hearty wintertime soup.

IGNORE the cook from Oslo - this soup is fantastic and I thought foolproof! It is so easy and we have made it so many times! Certainly this is no low calorie edition of Tortilla Soup but it can't be match for pure indulgence and rich, satisfying goodness! We heat large pieces of chopped chicken breast in the Chicken Broth and add it fully cooked when we add the broth. A real Crowd pleaser for sure!

This has to be the most disasterous soup I have ever made. The recipe looked so simple, but I guess I should have used my better judgement. There was way too much cheese and the chile powder I have was sooo overpowering that the soup was not salvageable. Argh. I am shocked that this recipe has received such good reviews! There are much better tortilla soup recipes out there.

This was delicious! I used less cheese and added shredded chicken, corn and black beans. Also used cilantro instead of chives. I served it with lime slices and it added a nice twist. I read all the reviews first to catch any tips! Thanks everyone!

This is fabulous and always a super hit! sooo easy and doesn't take a lot of time with a super result! I always use "Lime Chipotle" corn chips (crush very well) and it adds a slight lime kick to the soup. also, I put cut up chicken breast pieces into the chicken broth and bring to a boil and add it all together when recipe calls to add broth, not necessary but adds another dimension to this great soup.

The whole family loved it, even the picky kids. I'd give it 3.5 forks if I could. We made a few (minor) alterations: oil instead of butter and only 1/4 c., since there's plenty of fat added later. Added 3 tomatoes, masa flour instead of wheat flour, cilantro instead of chives, added at the end so it was still bright green. About the tortilla chips as thickener, we thought it turned out just fine. We used less than the recipe called for, a little over 1 cup. I crushed them thoroughly and after adding the chicken broth, I let the soup simmer for about 5-10 minutes. There was a creamy consistency, no tortilla blobs or anything, and a hearty flavor. Delicious!

Phenomonal. The other reviews were helpful, but let me give you one humongous hint that will make this soup fool-proof and instantly turn you into a gourmet cook. When you crush the tortilla chips - CRUSH them. They should be the consistency of coarse meal. If you do this, it is not possible to have "soggy" chips or soup. And whatever you do, do not puree. Last little tip-boil 2 chicken breasts, shred them and add when you add the chicken broth. Also, a half (small) can of corn will give it the truly authentic taste. Perfection.

Simple and delicious. A pleasant surprise. I'll make this again and again with different Mexican-flavored foods.

I think it might be better if all the ingredients were pureed. That's what I will do next time. I also deep fried my own tortilla strips. Looks a lot better for the presentation.

This is my absolute favorite recipe. I have made it at least 12 times in three years, so our family and for dinner parties. It has been raved about! I add in diced chicken and use low sodium chicken broth and no salt tortilla chips. Once or twice I have also substituted low fat milk for the cream with little taste difference for a healthier dish. You can also make larger batches and freeze it! YUM!

Putting the corn chips in during the cooking gave the appearance of cottage cheese in the soup. I put some tequilla in before the cheese and the acid helped it to melt nicely so I didn't have that problem. Next time I want this sort of soup I will put it the tequilla again before the chicken stock and leave the tortillas out until the last minute, for garnish.

This is a simply delicious soup. I can't comment on how well it reheats because my guests ate all of it! It was a hit with my family and friends. This is a hearty soup which is perfect for a quick dinner/lunch idea.

Nasty. I might be the only one who thinks so -- but the tortilla chips became mealy and the whole thing was digusting. I am a huge fan of tortilla soup, I lived in Mexico for 5 years and ate it often, but I think the chips should be added at the last minute. I made it a day ahead and reheated it following the recipe, and it was inedible.

In response to the question about Chili's Chicken Enchilada soup, no this is not like it. But you can get a recipe for that at www.topsecretrecipes.com I have made it several times at it is my husbands favorite soup.

I was looking for a recipe to use up the broken chips at the bottom of the bag -- and this is it! I used a 14 1/2 ounce can of Mexican-style diced tomato instead of the fresh tomato. I made a smooth version of the soup by putting it in the blender (in two batches) just after adding the broth. Then I returned it to the saucepan for adding the cream, cheese, and spices. It was superb -- definitely good enough for company. For an even heartier soup (it was cold out, and my husband was especially hungry), I added chunks of roasted chicken breast. Yum!

Is this recipe anything close to the chicken enchilada soup they serve at Chili's resturant?

This soup was just okay. I will try again with my own changes. I will use fresh cilantro,less tortilla chips if at all and no cheese. Then on top I will put the chips, cheese, and avacado. Also, I don't think this recipe as it is now tastes like Houston's Restaurant but has the potential with some changes.Oh yea, I also added some chicken that I had sauteed.

I would definitely make this recipe again. I took the advice of others and added chicken and it came out really well. One other rater mentioned difficulty with the cheese melting, my cheddar melted fine, however, the Monterey Jack didn't melt completely. No worries though, tasted just great.

I love this recipe and so does my family. My only real modification is adding chicken which makes it a much more substatial meal. I boil my chicken and shred it and simply add it to the recipe as is. Generally I garnish with a dolop of sour cream, chives and some crushed chips. Yumm !

This recipe is as close to Houston's Restaurant as it comes. It is wonderful! The only thing missing is in the garnish. Add fresh avacado, crushed tortilla chips and a sprig of cilantro! Will make again, and again and again!

I used this recipe as a starte idea of how to make totilla soup but changed it quite a bit...It came out wonderful though :). I added potatoes, corn, zuchinni, and chicken ( as suggested by others). Also to make the soup less thick I added about half the amount of tortilla chips to the soup and crushed them and also added less cheese to the soup while cooking. I preffered to add a good amount of tortilla strips and shredded cheese on top of the soup at the time of serving.I used half and half instead of whipping crea. I will definetly make it this way again!

Delicious!! I made my own broth with bone-in chicken breasts, added 3 or 4 green chiles to the tomato mixture, and added the shredded chicken and cilantro at the end. I also pureed the tomato mixture before adding it to the broth so I wouldn't have to witness my kids painfully picking out the onion!!

Delicious. I was invited over to a friends house for "Feliz Navidad" and the guests could not stop talking about how delicious the soup was! I love creamy Tortilla soup so I added more whipping cream and I let it simmer for 10-15 minutes in the end! Highly Recommended if you love Tortilla Soup.

I added the chicken and cilantro which was recommended. It was a nice touch. The soup was very good, only that it reminded me of a casserole that I make. Therefore, I kept thinking I was slurping a runny version of Chicken Monzella. Worth trying for others, but I'll just stick with using a fork instead of a spoon.

I loved the flavors in this recipe! Did anyone else have trouble getting the cheese to melt into the broth mixture? Some of my cheese wouldn't melt and stayed in clumps. I used a high quality cheddar. The second time I made this recipe I added one can of broth instead of two and added milk in place of the second can and got a much creamier and tastier result! I have also substituted a small can of crushed tomatos drained for the fresh tomato. You do not have to add salt if you use salted tortilla chips. This recipe will turn out fine if you use less butter. I have made this recipe more than once and it has definately become a favorite! Thanks for such a great recipe. Next time I will add chicken per the advice of the other reviewers.

A wonderful, hearty soup ! I added the chicken, corn, a jalepeno, and some roasted red pepper. Also, instead of corn tortillas I used flour tortillas both in the soup and on top.Just fry or grill them with some butter/oil brushed on them. Wonderful !

This soup is a bit on the rich side but my family and I really liked it. I didn't have the celery (didn't miss it tho') but I did do as suggested and added cilantro. Served it with cheese quesadillas and a green salad and it was a great dinner! I'll make it again for sure.

I agree w/ the cook from Sacramento - this soup is excellent with chicken! It doesn't reheat too well but the next day I ate it like dip w/ some chips & it was able to finish it off.

This is quite good, but cilantro is an absolute necessity in Latino food. Adding a tablespoon really puts this recipe over the top. Also, adding chicken breast meat makes a nice meal...
