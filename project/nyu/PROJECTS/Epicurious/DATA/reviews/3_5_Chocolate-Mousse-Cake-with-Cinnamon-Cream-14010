This recipe is a standby for me. Easy to make but looks much more impressive. I first made it when a friend demanded it for her birthday gift almost 10 years ago and I've pulled it out over and over. It is very rich, wonderful texture, and delicious flavor.

Excellent cake and gluten free! I substituted 1/3 c. orange juice for the rum and skipped the coffee.

This made a great cake that was pleasing to all tasters. I followed one user's advice and tried Tollhouse chips instead of baking chocolate. Also, I used brandy instead of rum and topped the whole dish with fresh strawberries. Great recipe!

This was very simple to make and a GREAT crowd pleaser. It tastes delicious. I made it with Toll House Semi-Sweet Chips and it was perfect.

Delicious and easy, although I agree it is too dense to be called "mousse." The cinnamon adds a nice dimension.

This recipe needs a new name. It's very tasty and easy to make, but is definitely not a "mousse" cake. It is a very heavy, dense cake that is only 1" high, texture somewhere between a brownie and fudge. The cinnamon cream is delicious. Although it was eaten up I was really disappointed because I was looking for a mousse cake and this is NOT it.

While my husband liked this, I did not. I felt that it was too close to dark chocolate for my taste. There are just too many other chocolate recipes out there that are to my taste to make this again.

I made this for Christmas and no one enjoyed it. It was too dense, there was a faint taste of scrambled eggs, did I cook it too long? As someone else mentioned perhaps beating the egg whites as in a conventional mousse would have been an improvement. There are simply too many delicious chocolate cake recipes out there for me to bother with this again.

Too heavy for my taste. I guess i'm not much of a chocoholic. Looked great though, and easy to make.

Excellent; very rich. Easy if you have a stand mixer-- just get the bain-marie ready ahead of time for efficient baking.

This cake was a great and easy success at a family birthday. I made it with Lindt bittersweet chocolate.

This came out more like a firm chocolate custard than a mousse cake. As I was expecting a mousse cake, I was disappointed. Perhaps it would be more like the real thing if the egg whites were whipped separately and then incorporated into the mix.

I was looking for an easy and impressive dessert to serve at a spontaneous dinner party--this cake exceeded my expectations! Even friends who "never" eat dessert raved about the flavor and appearance. Be sure to serve this with appropriate garnish--it is too beautiful a dish to go halfway.

I was cooking in the kitchen of my college dorm with limited kitchen supplies, and this cake was still excellent! The cinnamon cream was yummy.

Superb, restaurant quality...I used Ghiradelli (sp?) semi sweet morsels since I hate to chop block chocolate and it turned out great!

I made this dessert for a dinner get together we were having and it was a big hit. It is a very rich cake. The cake yielded 8 pieces but because it was so rich, you can cut the pieces in half again to experience the chocolate intensity!

This is the simplest recipe for an extremely elegant dessert. Your guests will never know how easy it is. Very impressive and delicious dessert. I've made it at least four times and it came out perfect.

A very delicious dessert, I served it without the cream and it goes perfectly well with dark coffee after a heavy meal.
