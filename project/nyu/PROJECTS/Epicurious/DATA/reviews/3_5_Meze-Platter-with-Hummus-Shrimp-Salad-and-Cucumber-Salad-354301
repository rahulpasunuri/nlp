I first made this when we returned from a trip to Israel and Turkey where we'd eaten some terrific food. It's just not that tasty, and after four or five attempts, I'm tossing the recipe. The hummus is good. The rest of the menu isn't worth the effort.

I just made the hummus portion of this recipe. It was very fresh and fantastic! I added a bit more lemon juice and olive oil.

Delicious...a simple to make crowd pleaser, although I did add a tablespoon of tahini to the hummus to make it more authentic.

I removed the shells from the shrimps entirely, to make them easier to eat with a knife and fork as part of the salad. I can see leaving the tails on if the shrimp are to be picked up from a tray by hand, but otherwise, the tails with shells are just a mess.

I gave this three forks because I'm just not that into cumin, but decided to try the full 2 tsp as the recipe suggests. I added a little more lemon juice (from a whole lemon), 1 tblsp of tahini, and a few pinches of crushed red pepper that we have leftover from the CSA. I'd make it the same way again, just with half the cumin.

I pulled the hummus recipe from this salad combination. This is by far the most simple hummus recipe I've ever tried! And the tastiest! I went ahead and added a tablespoon of flax seed oil and a little bit more paprika, because we like it spicy. Would make this again in a heartbeat!

Love this summer appetizer! My husband is middle eastern so familiar with mezze. This is a fresh version that is wonderfully authentic. Agree that there should be tahini in the hummus however. Serve it with little plates and forks like an antipasti platter. All of our guests have raved. A real keeper!

it seems like an odd thing to give a bad review to but I did NOT like this as an appetizer idea. The hummus was lacking, the shrimp were pretty good but the accompanying tomato/olive combo lended very little to the flavor and was difficult to eat with the shrimp if you're picking it up from across the table. Similarly, the cucumber/yogurt/feat combo was "OK" but difficult to eat without a fork and nothing particularly special. I would not choose this again.

Perfect for a hot night. I loved how this could be made ahead of time and refrigerated. This is a very colorful meal, delicious and refreshing. It is very fun, too. This would be perfect for an informal party. We served chilled vinho verde, a very crisp, low alchohol white wine from Portugal. melon with sugared phyllo dough crisps for dessert.

This is a fabulous appetizer. It was all so delicious (and nice to look at too) - everyone raved! I was skeptical of the hummus recipe without tahini but it was great (a friend said it was the best hummus they'd ever had). The shrimp salad was perfect. I highly recommend this!

this was really lovely. great variety and balanced flavours. i added a few additions to the hummous-- tahini and a sprinkle of sumac-- but the combination of the everything was lovely for a warm summer evening. I thought the cucumber feta and yogurt stole the show. So simple and so delicious-- of course, the greek yogurt made it so good. I wondered if I was serving it for a party what to drink-- any white wine suggestion for this recipe? i was thinking red might be better but it was so warm the evening I made this.

This was a lovely start to a dinner for five. I used Herb de Provence instead of Oregano on the cucumber salad.

Made this as a starter for a dinner party exactly as written and pictured, except i used fresh oregano and fresh mint on top of the yogurt. It is perfect as an appetizer or as a meal, with something for everyone. Not a scrap was left!!
