phooey. i should have read the reviews first too. i also had too much broth and it ended up just lacking in flavor. i have some leftover and will try making an extra pepper to thicken it up, maybe adding a teeny bit of cream and a splash of vinegar? could use some extra heat too. i won't be giving up on it yet, that's for sure...

Too much chicken broth! I had to make extra peppers to thicken it up. Should have read the reviews first.

These were ok. I did make some substitutions, cream cheese for the goat cheese to save $ and I used a mixture of manchego and cheddar for the cheeses. As for the sauce, as suggested by some I used a jalapeno and serrano and it was HOT!(although I forgot to add the chicken broth so maybe that's why) Might make again with some modifications

As I can almost never follow directions, I made substitutions: Queso fresco instead of goat cheese (they taste the same). Red onions for shallots since they seem to be a sharper version of shallots. White monterey jack from a local mercado instead of that yellow/white stuff at the mainstream grocers. For the red pepper puree: I added to the recipe 4 semi-charred green onions/scallions, 1 red chili pepper, bits of charred poblanos, red onions again instead of shallots, and finally instead of just 1 serrano and 1 jalapeno, I used both.

The second time around I won't use as much chicken broth, and I may try adding heavy cream. I wish the sauce had been a little hotter...I'll be adding more jalapenos. Also, if you don't feel like broiling the peppers or don't have access to a flame, a burner on a stove works well too. Just make sure to oil your peppers (I used olive oil) and keep a constant eye on them. Turn constantly, too. We spooned this sauce onto refried black beans as well as our peppers; as if we were putting gravy on mashed potatoes, and topped with cheese.

This is a good recipe but missing something spice-wise. I used 2/3 of a jalapeno pepper because my wife is not a big fan of heat and it is still plenty hot, OK by me. Also, I used a little less chicken broth. More like 6 ozs.

I loved this sauce. I added a bit of salt and about 2 tablespoons of heavy cream and used one jalapeno chili, beautiful taste, would even consider serving this as a soup. If it wasn't for this sauce, the poblanos would not have been near as good.

Made this sauce with the poblano recipe and thought the sauce was great - poblano's so-so. Want to try this on chicken or fish because it was so easy and tasty.

This was excellent with the cheese and shrimp stuffed poblanos. I used two jalepenos for extra heat. I also added some cumin which gave some nice flavor.

I think sauce was great over the stuffed peppers, I add two jal. peppers to give it a little more heat!! Sauce would also be good over chile rellenos.

Don't be thrown off when tasting this sauce on its own. It's very bland, but when teamed with the stuffed poblanos, it is perfect! I wouldn't change a thing. Will make this again-

Delicious! Takes the stuffed poblanos to the next level.

Made the sauce to go with sole. It's ok but inherently bland and boring. It's easy to make but even with a light fish like sole, it was nothing. Imagine roasted red peppers thrown in a blender... that's what this is and that's what it tastes like. Not interesting to the palate.

Very tasty, rich and interesting. Not as sweet as I was afraid it would be. Pretty color, looked good with the Roasted Poblanos on the plate. Will try again and again with other stuff as well.

yummy, yummy, yummy! Made this with the stuffed peppers that it accompanies. I would make this for grilled chicken also.. or I could see turning this into a soup and adding lots of goodies (black beans, corn, tomatoes, sour cream and avocado.. ) mmmmmm....
