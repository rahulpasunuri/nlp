Great recipe Followed the recipe and used grouper (thats what I had in the freezer). It was beatiful. Served with a brown rice. Poured some of the left over coconunt milk over the rice.

This was an excellent and very pretty dish. We served it with a nice green/herb salad the eggplant is very spicy (which we liked). the coolness of the tomato chutney was the perfect balance for it. Because the simmering liquid did not require the whole can of coconut milk, we used the rest as part of the cooking liquid for brown rice, along with a few pieces of chutney. The second time we made it, we used shrimp and other types of fish. It is a great preparation for all kinds of seafood.

Terrific recipe that produced a very, very good meal. Would recommend cutting back on the cayenne in the eggplant puree. And for the fish, cooking on medium-low is a good way to go (especially with an electric stove). Enjoy!

This dish was tasty but was somewhat imbalanced. Be careful not to skimp on the tomato chutney which is essential to balance the eggplant. Serve the chutney on top of the fish. I made an open face sandwich with the fish mashed together with the eggplant and mayonnaise the next day. Served it with sliced tomatoes and the daikon sprouts. It was better than dinner!
