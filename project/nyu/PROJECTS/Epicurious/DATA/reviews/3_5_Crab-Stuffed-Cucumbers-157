Hmmm, not so much. Pretty and fresh, but the cilantro over-powered everything else. Next time I will reduce the green onion and cilantro, and add more shrimp, in my case. Needs salt and pepper, and a pinch of cayenne if the jalapeno isn't zingy enough.

I substituted chopped up shrimp for the crab (didn't have any onhand)and left out the red pepper. I cooked the shrimp in olive oil with lots of garlic and it was delicious and probably added a little more flavor. I also cut the cucumbers a lot thinner than the recipe. These made a great presentation and I got lots of complements.

Maybe I missed something here, but this didn't do it for me or my guests. The crab was so overwhelmed that it could have been canned tuna. Wouldn't try it again.

Another twist is to use the cream cheese and sour cream- omit the jalapenos and peppers, add dijon, green onion, and horseradish and puree into a mousse. This lets the crab flavor come out. Garnish each with a tiny oece of crab. RAVE reviews every time!

I wasn't head-over for these, but they were very good. A delicate oriental flavor. The cucumber "toasts" were refreshing and balanced the heat from the crab mixture well. I also made my slices a little thinner (1/2") and used a baby spoon instead of a melon baller - gadgets: who needs 'em?

A book club hit! I followed the cream cheese tip and used good quality crabmeat. The only thing I'd change is the depth of the cucumber slices. 3/4 inch is just too big for munching. I see that another Epicurious recipe for cucumber-crab canapés uses 1/4-inch slices--I'll try that or a bit thicker next time and just do a narrow scoop. But there will indeed be a next time! Yum.

What a delightful appetizer! I served this at a cook out lunch as the first course and everyone agreed that it was delicious. I will make this one of my rites of summer.

I should have some reviews before making this. It was runny and next time I will add half cream cheese and half the sour cream. I would not scoop out the center of the cucumber either, rather just slice the cucmber and lay the crab mixture on top. I used lump crab and could not taste any crab at all! The other flavors where great with the cilantro and ginger but the poor crab never had a chance. I will try using an imitation crab next as it should have more flavor than the lump crab.

This was really good. I made it with half light cream cheese and half lite sour cream.

This was excellent. Very simple and pleasing to the eye. I combined a few different suggestions from the reviews and used 1 1/2 tbsp of sour cream and 1 1/2 tbsp of cream cheese, the consistency was perfect.

I made this for a little dinner party. I used more crab, maybe four ounces. It was delicious! I got a million complements on it -- and it was very easy to do!

Rather than slice the cucumber so thick,I cut them thinner,removed the seeds so that the slices resembled little rings and placed them on slices of pumpernickle rye(party rye size).They were easier to handle and less messy.They work great for finger food parties!
