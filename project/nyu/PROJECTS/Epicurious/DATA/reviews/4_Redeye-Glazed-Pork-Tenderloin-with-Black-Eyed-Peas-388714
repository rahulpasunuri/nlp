Lots of work, but worth it. I substituted bacon for the country ham (we're lucky to get bacon, let alone country ham, in Dominica.

Spectacular! Made this with the beans and greens shown in the photo (also WELL worthwhile). I garnished the pork with sweet relish from Trader Joe's, which was delicious. I used brown sugar for the gravy, as I could not find sorgham syrup. My gravy also never coated the spoon, but it didn't really matter. Everyone gobbled it all down.

This sounds delicious but what is sorghum syrup? And I've never seen 'bread and butter pickle' in shops here but my mum used to make one from cucumber and onions. Will that do for the puree?

Absolutely delicious. I never got a glaze either, but it didn't matter. I thought the relish on the pork sounded really odd, but it tasted wonderful. I combined it with a collard greens and bacon recipe I found, and the whole meal really worked well together.

Delicious. Had to use pork loin, which just took a bit longer but was worth the wait (and the leftovers!). My glaze never coated the spoon properly, but it still tasted great.

Outstanding! Had to add a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce, though.
