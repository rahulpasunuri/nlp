Tasty, but somewhat time-consuming for the results you get. 1) Make sure your onions are utterly fresh and naturally moist before you dip them in everything. 2) Watch your deep fryer; the egg mixture made the oil foam up so quickly I had to turn it off to get the batch after the first one safely.

These are _really_ good onion rings! They are crisper and less oily than any other rings I have experienced. Deadly for anyone on a diet!! Have to limit how often we can have these!! :-)

I agree these onion rings are by far the best I have made. The coating is not too heavy and they are very crisp. I will make this my go to recipe for onion rings.

It is a little time consuming. But if rings are your thing. This recipe works just fine.

I loved these. As I always do I just cooked them in a pan with a small amount of olive oil.

Generally I dislike when people "comment" on previous reviews but why would anyone offer a rating when they have not made the recipe?

Decided to try these since I was doing a fish fry with hush puppys anyway. Followed the recipe except added about 3/4 cup of Panko crumbs. Fried them in my deep fryer and they were easy. Placed them in a paper towel lined bowl and they sat for over an hour while everything got fried. As a result they were a little soft. I think if I had put them on a cookie sheet and stored them in the oven on warm they would have been crisp as advertised. The taste was far better than any battered rings I have ever had and they sold out long before the hush puppys. By far the best way to do onion rings.
