I made & reviewed this back in March 2007. Still believe my additions back then made it better (added 1/2 c. merlot, white pepper, white worcestershire, fresh ground black pepper). This time I added another can of tomatoes, reducing the amount of water. Also increased the pasta to 1 c. But this was the biggest discovery: the first time, my notes say "don't overdo marjoram." The second time I halved it & it was still too much. The third time, I put just 2 sprigs in and let them twirl around with the simmer. It was juuust right. Tried it with baby spinach which was good, just add it on top after the simmer to steam with the lid on the pot (don't do adult spinach unless you want to chop a bit - it gets gangly when cooked). Also did a shallot which added some nice depth. Yep, I'm one of "those" who starts reviewin' a recipe that no longer resembles the original (I feel it's ok when we have so many great suggestions from so many great cooks). Hope you will forgive me. :)

Try using fire roasted diced tomatoes...adds more flavor. I also used dried marjoram, 1/2 veggie broth, 1/2 chicken broth, pinch of cayenne. Crushed the garlic instead of dicing. Rather than thinly slicing the escarole, I cut it in 3" pieces and par boiled it a bit before adding (use the escarole water as the water in the recipe). Only add 1 cup water (2 cups waters it down). Acini di Pepi pasta works well b/c it doesn't get mushy...I like more pasta so I added 3/4 cup. Don't forget to add salt and parmesan or romano cheese...it really needs it. Tastes better the next day. Great veggie dish.

Honestly, it tasted like canned tomatoes. It was fine. Good, even. Not great. Not bad for a simple, quick weeknight dinner, but I probably wouldn't serve it to company.

The only thing this soup has going for it is ease and speed of preparation. I had my reservations, but decided to give it a shot based on other reviews. I am always wary of soups with canned tomatoes and my first instincts served me well. Totally lacks depth of flavor despite the fact that I put a chunk or reggiano in there for flavor. On the plus side, it was ready in minutes and is fairly healthy.

Very good and easy to make as a vegetarian dish, just substitute vegetarian broth for the chicken broth. Did I mention how easy it is to make?

I have made this soup several times. I have no trouble storing and reheating it as some others mentioned. Perhaps it is because I use lentil flour pasta and it does not absorb the liquid once it is cooked.

Simple, delicious, elegant and robust soup. I did add, thanks to a tip Mark Bittman had wrote about in a NY Times article a few months ago, 2 anchovies, which I melted into the oil after adding the garlic. It gives it that unctuous, rich flavor that makes people cry "what is that?"

I forgot to mention, I used a combination of beef and chicken broth and I think this gives better flavor than water

3 1/2 forks. I made a half recipe with a whole head of escarole and it was just enought for three side servings. Terrific flavor, just don't skimp on the fresh marjoram!

Rating: 3
This dish came out better than I expected. I substituted chix broth for both the veggie and water, and instead of fresh marjoram, I used 1 T. dried (could even go a little less). I simmered longer than 5 minutes at the end to let the flavors cook together.

I liked the flavors, but I do recommend eating it soon after it is prepared. If you wait too long (like I was forced to by latecomers), the pasta absorbs the broth, and you are forced to dilute the broth ... and lose the great flavor within (the frustration with any good vegetable soup, it would seem). Very easy; I prepped everything the night before, and then threw it together when I came home from work.

used chicken broth instead of vegetable. Delicious soup. Does not re-heat well.

Rating: 3
Quick and easy to make, and delicious. I've made this a few times and varied some ingredients. It always turned out well, but I actually liked it best when I used cannelini instead of the garbanzo beans, and chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. (Perhaps the vegetable broth i used is not as good as others.)

Did the whole Birthday Celebration menu this is associated with and was a fantastic hit, in fact I got accused of ordering in and faking it - a compliment from my point of view. Didn't change a thing. I really debated 3 or 4 forks...it was a perfect accompaniment to the menu BUT when it comes down to it, it's basically minnestrone. This was a definite home run, just not a "take it out of the park into McCovey Cove home run". (It's a baseball thing...really, it makes sense.

My husband has proclaimed this his new favorite soup. He would give it a 4+ rating and asks me to make it every week--lucky for him it's so easy to put together. I substitute bok choy or napa cabbage for the escarole, which is not easy to find in my area. Vegetarian family members and friends especially appreciate this soup.

Made for a nice lunch with tuna wraps. I added my own herbs rather than already seasoned diced tomatoes. Used elbow macaroni which made it a bit more hearty.

This was a nice soup. My husband rates it 3 forks, I rate it 2 forks. Used homemade chicken stock and acini de pepe pasta. Would make it again in a pinch.

This was a keeper! Even though I substituted spinach for the escarole and summer savory for the marjoram, this soup tasted like an Italian ministrone, straight from Rome; so fresh and delicious. My husband loved it.

It's OK to give a negative review, but maybe it would help if some more information was given. Cook on 3/4/04 could have mentioned why it was a "dud." After all, he or she may just have disliked garbanzo bean, or something. Constructive criticism is what I'm looking for. Otherwise, you just come off looking like a snob.

Had to make it with bok choy since escarole was not available (chop bok choy stems and cook a bit longer than the leafy parts). Also, made some revisions as it was too thin on the palate. We added 1/2 c. merlot, white pepper, white worcestershire, fresh ground black pepper. Next time (yes, I will make it again), I'll add another can of tomatoes and might try it with spinach. It thickened up nicely the second day and was even better. Good comfort food and certainly easy enough (love those recipes where you don't have to cook the pasta separately!).

This soup was excellent and simple to make for a quick supper on a busy week night. The combination of ingedients works well together.

This soup was a waste of good escarole.

In the midst of making this, I wondered why I chose the recipe and thought the dish could not be very good because of the simplicity of ingredients and short cooking time. However, I was so wrong. The soup is surprisingly delicious. It is so speedy to make and very tasty. My husband, who is picky, agreed this is a keeper.

Very similar to a soup made by my grandmother. I tried it substituting collar greens for escarole and added some Spanish chorizos. Will absolutely make this again.

Thanks, Turlock. As you know, bok choy is plentiful and inexpensive here, so I'll try it. We can get chard, but it's 3 or 4 times the cost of bok choy.

To Honolulu (my hometown too). Use bok choy - it cooks in about the same time and has the same slight bitterness. I make a similar soup to this, but start with sauteed pancetta. To do it Hawaiian style, you could add some crispy cooked Portuguese sausage. That would be ono.

To Honolulu: You might try swiss chard, the flavor is more delicate than that of spinach and the leaves have a great texture.Seattle Cook

The only things I did differnt was I used white northern beans and 1 cup uncooked mini penne. I also cooked calamari and added it to only my dish since my husband doesn't like it. We both enjoyed this meal and I would not hesitate to make it again.

How about cabbage? OR is that out of the question. Sound interesting to me....

A quick, easy and inexpensive meal. I couldn't find fresh or dried marjoram -- I used about a tablespoon or dry italian spice. There was no need to use the extra cup of water. I've made escarole and bean soup in the past, but this was the first time adding diced tomatoes. It gave it a very rich flavor but not an overpowering one. By far, this is one of the best recipes and will make again and again.
