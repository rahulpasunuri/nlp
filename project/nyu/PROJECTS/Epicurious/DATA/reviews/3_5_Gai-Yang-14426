Agreed with a few of the reviewers that this was a little bland as is. I added 1/4 cup of chopped lemongrass and a little more fish sauce, and everyone raved. With the lemongrass, it's definitely a 4-fork recipe! Baste the chicken with the marinade while you're grilling.

I found this to be a little bland. The second time I made this with added lemon grass , kaffir lime leaves and thai chilis. Now it's a knock out recipe!

I make this often but prefer to use bone-in chicken thighs which increases grilling time. The dipping sauce is simple to make.

Quite tasty! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added lime juice and rind to the processor, as well as a bit of chili-garlic sauce. I also like mine spicy so I added Saracho (sp?) while it was marinating. Next time I'll marinate the chicken longer to try and get a little more coconut flavor, but still very tender and tasty and definitely will make again!

Made this three times now, once for the in-laws and once for friends, all times with skinless chicken thighs. Excellent, inexpensive, and easy. I made the dipping sauce and was not impressed though - you can save time and purchase bottled dipping sauces (I used one sweet/hot and one Thai chili sauce - very hot) for variation.

I've made this three times now, each time to rave reviews. Last time I added lime juice which gave it extra zing

As printed, the dish is too bland for lava lovers; more heat is needed (a few dried Thai peppers). Double the peppers in the Hot & Sweet Dipping Sauce, and serve a milder Thai chili sauce for the faint-at-heart. This is an easy and impressive dish.

To the person who got food poisoning - you can't get food poisoning from a bad recipe - you get food poisoning from not handling your chicken properly or the chicken you bought was bad in the first place! There is alot of bacteria on chicken skin.

Absolutely delicious! Made this for a dinner party and the guests raved about the flavour and tenderness of the chicken. I find that the addition of lemongrass makes this dish extra fragrant.

Incredible!!! I couldn't believe how wonderful this recipe was. It was like a little piece of heaven in your mouth. It was too cold to grill so I ended up putting it under the broiler and it turned out great. The only change I made to the recipe was cut the coconut milk in half. I put just enough to cover the chicken. I love thai food and this dish was simple, easy, and delicious. The flavors all worked very well together. My husband also loved it and I'm sure we'll make it again.

This is a fantastic recipe, but I think it's probably better in warmer wather...It's fall in New England, not exactly grilling weather. I can't wait to trot it out again come summer.

very good. Absolutely amazing when paired with Thai sweet red chile sauce. You can make your own or buy it in the ethnic grocery shop -- do heat it up in the microwave first rather than using it at room temp. for this dish. I'm going to try it with shrimp as well!

This chicken works well on the grill or under the broiler. It appeals to everyone because of its simplicity- in every way, from preparation to taste. My significant other hates fish sauce with a passion, so I used 2 tbsp light soy sauce (light in color, not sodium) and snuck in one tbsp of fish sauce when he wasn't looking. I have made it for him in the past with all fish sauce, but he didn't like it nearly as much b/c he saw the bottle of fish sauce. My father despises bones and skin on his chicken- I don't know where he thinks boneless, skinless breasts come from, but he seems to have discarded the notion that they ever had skin or bones! So, I was a little worried about making this with such naked breasts, but I did it anyway. That was just as much of a winner. He loved it. I loved the idea of making it a little lower in calories and fat. This marinade is so versatile that you don't have to stop where the menu ends. You'll love it.

To weigh in on the coriander versus cilantro question--Fresh coriander and cilantro are synonymous. Fresh coriander/cilantro is sold in bunches, of which there is a leafy end and a root end. Some people only use the leafy end but actually the roots have a stronger "cilantro" flavor. They are often used to flavor marinades. Dried coriander, as the other reviewer mentioned, are ground seeds from the coriander plant.

This is my favorite chicken recipe! I combined the peppercorns, garlic and salt by hand with the back of a spoon and it worked great. The chicken turned out so moist and full of flavor. I can't imagine it WITHOUT the sweet & sour sauce - it was so easy and perfect with the chicken. Hate to use the cliche but the sauce is like a wonderful party in your mouth. Can't wait to make it again!

Excellent. Very moist. I used ordinary cilantro.

If you like moist chicken, then this is the recipe for you! Simple to make, even more simple when grilled on a gas BBQ. The flavor is just awesome. I don't know what I expected this chicken to taste like, but it was surprisingly good. I used fresh chopped cilantro (2 TBS.) instead of coriander root.

This is a household favorite. I've also made it twice for guests, with steamed rice and stir fried baby bok choy, and they loved it. The dipping sauce adds a nice kick and cold beers are the perfect accompaniment in the summertime. I also baste the chicken with the marinadee while it's on the grill.

To Houston cook: coriander is the dried seeds of the cilantro plant, the leaves/roots of which are frequently used in Asian cuisine. These terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Many people find cilantro "soapy" tasting and it can be vile if it is not very fresh.

This recipe went over very well with my guests and it wasn't a very time-consuming process. I couldnt find fresh coriander so I used ground coriander. It tasted great. I served it with the mushroom medley with spinach. Perfect match.

This was so good. I could have eaten the whole thing myself. Probably better grilled, but broiler worked like a charm. Sauce is a must. What is the difference between cilantro and coriander? I hate cilantro, but like dried coriander which I used.

My mini-Cuisinart choked on the cilantro roots. I had to fall back on the regular one. Seasoning was very mild. Promising but needs tweaking.

I've made this dish sans coconut milk and I too have had the same problem with only the pepper coming through. What I did wrong was grind the pepper too fine - Thai cookbooks recomend coarsely chopping or motaring...or is it pestelling? I am really looking forward too trying it with the coconut milk. Like I always say you can never have too much coconut milk.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. On paper, it sounds great. In practice, the only flavour came through the heat of the pepper, and via the dipping sauce, which is requisite. I would only make it again by adding some additional ingredients such as lime juice or perhaps some curry. As is, it does not stand up to grilling.

WHOA!!!!!!This dish is incredible.And I only used my humble little indoor grill.Served with jasmine rice,thai cabbage slaw and the dipping sauce suggested(make sure you make the dipping sauce).My first time giving out 4 forks, well deserved.

This is awesome! I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours and grilled them. What a hit!! Will definately make again.

I baked this in the oven instead - just poured the whole lot into an ovenproof dish and baked for around 40 minutes at Gas 6 (not sure of US equivalent). It was easy, delicious and had its own very tasty sauce. Am planning to make it again at the weekend with fish (huss or swordfish) for "fishetarian" friends.

Very good, We added red pepper flakes, green onions, and "sukang maasim" (philippino spiced white vinegar) to give it more bite. It is also very good made with shrimp.
