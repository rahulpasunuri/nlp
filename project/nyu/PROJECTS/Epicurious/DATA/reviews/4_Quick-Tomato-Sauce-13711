This is ridiculously good and easy! I don't know if I'll ever do the days of simmering in pots again!

This is a great base. Add some basil or oregano.

Nice basic sauce. I put everything into my food processor, along with 2 cloves garlic and pureed. Then simmered in an open pan.

This is so good and easy. Plus, it's versatile. You can do almost anything with it and use it whenever you need a basic tomato sauce, either for pasta or another dish that calls for it.

Added 3 cloves of garlic, 2 teaspoonfuls dried sweet basil and salt to taste. Used Nina brand of canned tomatoes (San Marzano) and reduced it until thickened. Then used hand blender to smooth out sauce. Kept unused sauce in glass jar and used it again a few days later,

This is a classic! I often use it as a base with grilled veggies (oyster mushrooms, zucchini, eggplant etc.) and some hot Italian sausage to top farfalle. Great no fuss sauce!

I made this because I had the ingredients on hand and it is so simple to make. This is actually the best tomato sauce I have ever made or bought. I recommend using San Marzano tomatoes if you can get them, because it really does make all the difference and the olive oil makes it so velvety. This is definitely a keeper.

Classic meat-less tomatoe sauce. Mom used to make this every Friday. I use 2-3 cloves chopped garlic instead of onion. Also add a dash of dry oregano and basil. I cook this sauce on a low simmer for a least 1 hour to reduce the water. Use a tipped lid to allow steam to escape.

Very easy and very fast. Try using diced tomatoes with roasted garlic to add more flavor.

This sauce is nothing fancy, but it definitely beats sauce from a jar if you are pressed for time. It's extremely easy to make. It loses a lot of its flavor after the day you make it.
