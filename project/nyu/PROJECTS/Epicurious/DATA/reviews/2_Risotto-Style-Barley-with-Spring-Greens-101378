I was determined to make this recipe work, despite some of the reviews, so added a shallot and garlic hoping that would add something. I substituted edamame for Lima beans and was generous with the salt. Despite these efforts it is just very bland dish. Maybe some white wine added with the barley and thyme could've helped. But won't make this again to find out.

This would be a good base for something great... as it is, this recipe is bland. I made it for Easter dinner and was hoping it would impress but no one much cared for it and now I'm stuck eating copious amounts of leftovers.

i think that if this were my first meal after waking up from a thirty year coma, i would weep for the souls of my species because based on this dish i would think that all life had been obliterated from the planet. P.S. dear epicurious: why is it that the one fork rating means "okay"? a run-of-the-mill peanut butter and jelly sandwich is okay. this was the blandest abomination of risotto that i've ever had. it's nice to be positive and all but when people's lunches are on the line i would like to give a more accurate rating.

Very bland and tasteless.

Excellent spring dish! Light, yet hearty. Combination of spring greens was very satisfying. I don't care for saffron so I left it out and didn't miss it. Used less broth than recipe called for and like traditional risotto, I added broth a cupful at a time, especially near finish.

This was light and different and really satisfying.

This was a really good vegetarian first-course. I added asparagus and fresh peas to make it more green and spring-like. As a final touch, I put a couple of teaspoons of truffle oil on each serving.
