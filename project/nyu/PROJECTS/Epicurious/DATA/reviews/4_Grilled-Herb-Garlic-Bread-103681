Great recipe, except that I'd put 1/2 to 3/4 less amount of salt next time. Was way too salty.

Really, really good! We have made this bread several times. I sent the recipe to my daughter. She and her husband pronounced it delicious!! This is a great one to try if you haven't already.

We LOVE this! Especially good using Costco Ciabatta. Also try replacing the butter with a flavorful extra virgin olive oil, also delicious and maybe a tiny bit healthier.

Absolutely delicious!! We tried this in the summer and it is so good we've pulled the barbeque to the door through 2 feet of snow to make it twice this winter.

Delish! I used half the amount of butter and salt but added the prescribed amount of garlic and parsley. The bread took on the smokey taste of the grill and was the perfect accompaniment to a grilled steak dinner.

Yummy and easy.. Grilling gives the bread a more unique twist than the regular oven garlic bread.

I've been making almost exactly this recipe since I was a little girl - I'm not surprised to find it here, it's so good! The only thing I do differently is to add some oregano - it's a little more savory. :)

This was amazing. I used baguettes instead of round loaves and it still turned out wonderful.

Delicious recipe. Maybe not the healthiest, but really tasty. Be very careful to watch the bread on the grill, the butter can catch fire pretty easily.

This recipe ROCKS! I used 7 cloves of garlic instead of the recommended amount and it was wild. Pay close attention to the distance from the coals that they recommend...by the time I got them out of the fire my neighbor had the phone in her hand to call the fire dept. I was able to save 1 quarter of the french baguette loaf and it was great. The only change I'll make next time (besides not entertaining my kids with a 3 foot fireball) is to go a little easier on the salt.

This is a GREAT recipe for any dish. However, I also use this recipe without melting any of the butter. I also add parmesan cheese to the mixture. Just take everything and put into a bowl, then either cut your loaf (I use French bread) in half and spread on each half, or cut in small sections and spread mixture in each section and bake. My husband can't get enough of this bread. We make it at least two times a week!!!!
