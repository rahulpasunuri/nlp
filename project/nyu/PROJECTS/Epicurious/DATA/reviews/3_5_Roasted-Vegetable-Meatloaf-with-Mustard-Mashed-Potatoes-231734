I made this meatloaf last night and was a little leery with the mix of vegetables, but it was the best meatloaf I've ever had. The roasted vegetables were great in it! They also will make a great salad later. I used 1 lb. of pork and 1 lb. of grass fed lean beef. The meatloaf was still very moist despite using lean meats. I also added some Worcestershire to the sauce. I will definitely be making this more often!

I'm not really a meatloaf person, but this was excellent. I highly recommend it for an easy make ahead dinner option. I made the whole recipe in the morning and put the loaf pan of meatloaf in the fridge until evening. Added the ketchup topping and popped it in the oven along with potatoes wrapped in foil. Pre-mixed sour cream and chives for the baked potatoes and dinner was on the table an hour later with no hassle!

Very good. I made it with turkey. Great comfort food.

I make this exactly as the recipe says except I only use 1 bell pepper and add 2 medium carrots diced to the roasted veggies. Also, I have never had the fresh herbs on hand that it calls for so I just use dried and it's super tasty still! FYI - I've tried free-forming the loaf on a sheet pan, but would recommend using the loaf pan per the recipe...much more even cooking results! Even my 2-year old loves this and it's hard to get veggies in him!

I made this meatloaf for company and everyone really liked it, even the three 5 year olds! I did make the following (minor) substitutions: used lean ground beef, reduced fat mozzarella, and oatmeal instead of panko. Very moist and flavorful, almost like an Italian meatball. I could have slipped in more than 1 cup of the veggies and my kids wouldn't have noticed. BIG meatloaf as other reviewers have said; probably is closer to 10 servings. While I really liked the flavor, sometimes I just want a basic meatloaf, not a fancy schmancy one. Still, I'll keep this in the recipe rotation!

Outstanding! A new benchmark for meatloaf. Agree with other reviewers: 1. It makes a huge meatloaf, much bigger than the suggested portion for 6 but you won't mind. It's delish. 2. With the addition of cheese and wet vegetables it's very moist and will hold up to a lower fat content in the hamburger (I'd definitely use a leaner meat next time. It was so moist, it was difficult to cut. I baked it on a sheet pan and fat pooled around the edges.) 3. The mustard mashed potatoes were incredible. Will definitely be making them again.

This makes a HUGE meatloaf by the way - much more than the stated 6 servings!

This is a really good meat loaf. I cheated and 'pan roasted' the veg instead of roasting in the oven. I used lean beef (not the 20% fat as indicated) and found the meat loaf was still really moist, probably due to the cheese and veg, so I will use lean beef again next time. I didn't make the potatoes, so can't rate those. However, to get the mustard flavour that the potatoes would have provided I added mustard to the ketchup topping (3/4 c ketchup, 1 tbsp mustard powerd, 2 tbsp brown sugar). Recommend baking freeform to get more caramalized surface, also why I increased the ketchup topping to 3/4 cup.

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe; in fact, I didn't really like meatloaf before trying this. I've substituted all different kinds of meat-- mixing together ground turkey, lamb, pork... all combinations have been excellent. Today, I didn't have fresh rosemary and substituted fresh sage and thyme-- wonderful results! Also try roasting carrots, parsnips or turnips to the vegetable mix. Be cautioned that the recipe yields an enormous hand shaped meatloaf-- easily enough to make two smaller loaves in pans. This meatloaf can be frozen and reheated with no problem.

Been making this meatloaf since it was first published. This is great stuff, not humble meatloaf. Using the Tomato & Red Pepper Relish from Tyler Florence's Dad's Meatloaf makes it, IMO, even better. http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/dads-meatloaf-with-tomato-relish-recipe/index.html It sounds like I make meatloaf a lot, which I don't, but I make and freeze Tyler's relish for this recipe. Use some on top too. :-)

This is a very inspired recipe that holds up to substitutions. 95% lean ground beef, added 3/4 Italian chicken sausage, shredded Comte in place of mozzarella, white wine instead of red, marinara sauce not ketchup, whole wheat bread crumbs soaked in milk for panko. I would heartily recommend shaping the loaf free form for even more carmelization.

My husband usually doesn't like meatloaf. So when I told him that I am making some he wasn't really excited. But this recipe certainly changed his mind. This is the best meat loaf we ever had and we will surely make this again.

Really delicious. In making this again, I think I might either roast the veggies for a little less time or start the peppers and zucchini first and then add the onions. My onions had a lot of very well-done bits. I didn't use a loaf pan because I like more browned bits. 16% fat ground beef was plenty moist.

This was sooooooo good and made me hero with my man! Yes, it is a bit labor intensive, but using a cuisinart to shred the veggies helps. I used whole wheat bread crumbs instead of panko, Trader Joe's 4 cheese blend for the mozzarella, and added some worcestershire sauce, but otherwise made as written. Also, I used 90% lean ground beef, and it was still very moist. I HIGHLY recommend making the potatoes to go with (using whole grain french mustard) and serving with green beans. The flavor combinations are divine!

I didn't much care for this recipe the first time I made it. The vegetables were too chunky and affected the texture of the meatloaf, making it too crumbly. Also, although I love mozarella, it added no flavor and little texture to the recipe. On my second try, I grated the veggies (I also subbed 1 poblano for one red pepper for spice) and sauteed until caramelized. I also subbed in goat cheese for the mozarella, meatloaf mix (1/3 beef, 1/3 veal, 1/2 pork) for the beef, and used a rosemary balsamic tomato sauce instead of ketchup. The result was decidedly mediterranean and delicious.

We made ours with ground lamb instead of ground beef. This caused us to alter our recipe quite a bit, using chopped rosemary in both the loaf and the roasted vegetables. We added garlic to the loaf as well. We also substituted tomato paste where it called for ketchup, since ketchup is something we never eat or buy. To top it off, we made a Moroccan harissa mixture with tomato paste on one half of the loaf and laid bay leaves across the other half. We served it with green onion mashed potatoes and more of the roasted vegetables. It turned out really well!

Excellent meatloaf, very flavorful and moist. I did add some chopped sage, and substituted oregano for the marjoram. I did not use the wine, but added about 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce. I shaped it on a baking pan instead of using the loaf pan, thus no problem with overflowing the pan. My entire family loved it.

I have made this a couple of times. Last time, we used ground buffalo meat. I left out the basil and I didn't miss it. I also added some paste tomatoes to the roasting veggies instead of using ketchup--the flavor is great!! I also added all the veggies in the meat mixture. This is a favorite. We roasted it in our big green egg and the smoky flavor was great!

The roasted vegies are a great suggestion, but a few additional ingredients will make this a much tastier loaf: a bit of Worcestershire sauce, soy, steak seasoning, Dijon, paprika, chili powder and lots of persillade. I skip the ketchup and add 1/4 cup tomato sauce. During roasting, I baste it with a combo of tomato sauce, mustard, brown sugar, vinegar (as suggested in another recipe on the site).

My Family loved this meatloaf. I made samll changes to it, like the recommended tomato topping in additon to the ketchup, tomato instead of red peppers and whole wheat bread instead of the panko. My family requested that I make it again and next time I may try a different vegetable!

you know if a recipe WILL work if it looks fesible on the page. This recipe had good bones to it. Roasting veggies to enhance meatloaf is a great idea. I had everything in the house so it was a no brainer for me. Of course I had a few adjustments. First: What is up with the ketchup. If someone is going to the trouble of roasting, well, throw in a couple of roma tomatoes and presto there is your tomato base, 2nd, if you are going to roast that, you might as well roast a head of garlic, yes, a head. roasted garlic is mellow and adds dimension. Everything else is common sense, how big a baking dish, etc. It took a little over an hour to cook, but hey you opened the wine and i substituted grana padana parm for mozz. and ate a few slivers with a little wine while things cooked. Easy and my husband loved the leftovers. cooking is about adaptation enjoy it!!!

This recipe was fantastic! You've gotta love roasted veggies! I used ground beef with 10% fat, and used part skim milk mozzarella instead, and it still came out moist. I didn't think that it was difficult to make. I would definitely make this again! Yummy! It was so easy to make!

This is a great recipe that we make all the time - my 3 yr old and infant love the meatloaf and it get in a few veggies without thinking about it!

1st. time to rate... It was great! A bit long in the directions, oh well. I thought it was well worth it, so did my husband & son. The only thing I forgot,(opps) was the Rosemary in the meat when mixing,it had enough in the veggies when roasted in oven. As for the rest of the dinner, superb !

"It was digusting, terrible and I'd throw up if I had to eat a ton".....so much for feeding this to kids as this was a quote from my children. And as an adult I'm right there with them. It took forever to make and it was not very tasty.

This is a favorite with my family. I can't make it enough!! Regular breadcrumbs work just as well. Roast the vegetables ahead of time (even the day before) to reduce cooktime.

I've been trying different meatloaf recipes, I think this one is one of my favorites. (I really love the turkey meatloaf from this site.) It's also a great way totget the kids to eat some veggies.

First, I chose to roast the veggies on my grill rather than in the oven. This certainly added to the overall time, but payed off in added flavor big time. I also split the meatloaf into to loaf pans which helped, but would probably use a square casserole dish next time around. This recipe did not stand up as well the second time i made it, as i tried to assemble the loaf a day in advance. This seemed to make is too moist. Overall, i thought this recipe had great flavor and my husband raved about the leftovers for a week.

This was actually better the next day. It did require quite a bit of labor, and next time I'd put it in a 9x9 pan instead of a loaf pan. The loaf just crumbled when turned out. A great dish for a hearty meal and to create leftovers!

I thought this was a great recipe. The only thing I would change is to put more rosemary on the veg and less in the meatloaf -- the rosemary can be overwhelming if it's not mixed into the meatloaf well enough. I also split it into two pans so it would cook faster.

The meatloaf was a disaster from start to finish. It was incredibly laborious (and with no flavor payoff). It was way to big for the pan and consequentially started an oven fire. It was supposed to cook in an hour and 3 hours later it was ready (and, by the way, I had guests!) And when it was finally finished, it tasted bland and greasy. On the upside, the mashed potatoes were good.
