I made this to take to a brunch and it was not only beautiful to look at but also delicious to eat! The only reason I think it didn't get entirely devoured was because it was at the very end of the buffet line, and everyone's plates were already full! Just make the way this is written. Don't cut the fat. I agree with another reviewer, who stated that you don't want the emulsifiers and other nasty stuff in the low-fat versions of everything. How often do you enjoy a decadent coffee cake like this? Indulge! Your palate will thank you.

I made some changes - and I made it Gluten Free. First - no nuts or currants. The first due to allergies and the second just personal preference. I definitely cut the streusel in half and it was more than enough. I subbed equal amounts of gluten free flour mix (to include chickpea, fava bean, sorghum, corn starch, and tapioca starch) for the cake flour. Added 1.5 teaspoons Xanthan gum, upped the salt and vanilla a bit. Baked in a non-stick bundt pan sprayed with Waffle-off spray (available at Williams-Sonoma). Cake came out clean, even though my streusel touched the pan all over the place. Just dusted with powdered sugar - glaze would have been over kill IMO. Delicious and no one believed me it was GF.

Great tasting...the cocoa cut down the sweetness of the streusel. I didn't put the icing one..just sprinkled on some more streusel w/o the walnuts. I had a huge problem w/ it not coming out of the bundt pan in one piece though...I think my streusel touched the sides, so it fell out of the pan in chunks :-P Will have to try again to see if I can get it right...it tastes good...definitely undercook it and check often, but it's hard to get right..part of the inside of mine was still wet so it collapsed like a souffle or popover :-P BTW, be aware that the recipe is for a 12 cup bundt pan. I had an 8 cup one and had to divide the ingredients by 2/3. It still took 50min or so surprisingly...

This cake is something special. The filling is so tasty. I agree with others that there is really too much filling to use - maybe half is about right. This may be the best coffee cake I have ever made. Family went wild for it. Very Very Tasty!

I made this to take to work over a month ago and grown men still come up to me in the cafeteria asking me to make it again. I even made this once and cooked it by mistake at 375 instead of 350 and it was still moist and lovely!

Omitted currants and frosting; used low-fat sour cream;cooked about 5 min. less than specified; used full amount of filling, but was careful to keep filling away from sides as others warned, so would not stick; used a 12 cup bundt pan, greased and floured. Made day before and covered securely with foil. Came out great to rave reviews. Nothing left, but crumbs!

Rating: 4
This cake is excellent. The filling adds a surprising crunch. However, the second time I made this cake it overflowed and spilled out of the bundt pan while baking. I'm perplexed, I did everything the same except the second time I used regular sour cream and the first time I used light sour cream. Do any of you expert bakers have a clue why this would happen?

Agree with others that half the streusel is enough. I also did not do the icing but just sprinkled with powdered sugar to decorate. Really delicious.

I have made this exceptional coffee cake every year for Christmas since the recipe was first printed in 1998. I would discourage cooks from altering this recipe without trying it as written first. What sets this apart from other coffee cakes is the balance of flavors in the filling and the tender rich crumb of the cake. The chocolate in the filling adds warmth and depth without being identifiable. Using full fat sour cream not only adds richness, but isn't laden with chemical stabilizers and thickeners. Organic European style butter gives a full rich taste to the cake. A coffee cake is an indulgence to be enjoyed infrequently. Eat real whole foods, eat sensibly, exercise regularly, and from time to time, have a rich, truly wonderful treat, such as this.

Used non-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Worked well.

This is a wonderful coffee cake! I almost did not try it after reading several of the negative reviews. I am so glad I decided to give it a shot. This recipe is a keeper. I did reduce the sugar a bit since I do not like it very sweet; I reduced the brown sugar in the streusel to 1 c. and the white sugar in the batter to just over 1 c. I used pecans instead of walnuts and dried cherries instead of currants. Also, I used a 9X13 pan and spread the streusel in 3 layers, mixing the top layer with a little butter as one reviewer had suggested. I baked it for 45 mins and it came out perfect. I had no trouble taking it out of the pan either. I skipped the glaze (not too fond of glazes). The cake got devoured really fast! To me, it is coffee cake if it has the right texture and has layers of streusel in it. This recipe fits the bill perfectly. My suggestion to those who found their result really dense or dry - skip the step that calls for beating the batter at high speed for 1 minute. I think that can make most cakes dense. With these minor modifications, I intend to make this coffee cake often!

Rating: 4
I agree with other reviewers that the filling should be halved. There was more filling than cake. I would also leave out the chocolate. I love chocolate but not for breakfast. I added almond rather than vanilla extract and used almonds as the nuts. Otherwise, very good.

Rating: 2
Wow, I was disappointed. With all the glowing reviews for this recipe I expected perfection. It's very, very sweet---there is so much filling it takes over. If, like me, you want to be able to taste cake, and have the filling only as a subtle sweet accent, cut the filling in half. All I could taste was brown sugar.

Rating: 4
Excellent cake. I followed other suggestions and used dried cherries instead of currants. I also only baked for 50 minutes and it came out great. Very moist and yummy. I did not put the frosting on as I was short on time. It really does not need it. I too like others wondered about the coco powder. It was a great addition. I put all of the filling ingredients in the food processor and pulsed for a few times and then put it in the cake.

Rating: 4
This coffee cake is sensational. The only things I changed were substituting pecans for walnuts and I used light sour cream. Absolutely delicious. I had for breakfast five days in a row because it was so good. I think that any coffee cake I make in the future will not be able to compare.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe 4 times. It makes the best coffee cake I've ever eaten. It is important not to cook it more than 1 hour. It will look uncooked, but because of the uneven shape of the bundt pan, you will get a dry top if you cook it until it looks cooked. Testing for doneness is useless. I overcooked it when I tried to wait for a clean knife. A little extra butter is a good idea too. It is very important to arrange the sugar mixture so that it does not touch the sides of the bundt pan. I agree that using less than 1/3 in the first layer will help with distribution. Finally, if you like sweets like me, the frosting should not be skipped as many reviewers have suggested.

Rating: 4
I love this cake recipe. A couple thoughts: I used fat-free sour cream to see if it would change the flavor - and it didn't! I'm thinking you can use egg substitute and applesauce in place of some of the butter and eggs to cut even more fat and calories out of the recipe and still have a moist and delicious cake. Try not to let the streusel touch the sides of the pan - even with Pam, it stuck to the pan so it wasn't as pretty when I finally slid it out. It definitely doesn't need any kind of icing!

This was delicious. I had to make it nut free, so I used a combination of golden and thompson raisins instead of the walnuts.

Made some adjustments to clean out the fridge and WOW! Instead of sour cream, I use 2/3 cream cheese and 1/3 heavy cream (its what I had!) The batter was to thick so I thinned it with some water. Also, instead of vanilla, I used amaretto. I reduced the recipe to 2/3rds of everything and still had too much streussel. I baked 2 loaf cakes and they are superb. I did not make the drizzle for the top-it seemed like too much considering the cream cheese...

Rating: 4
Fantastic!!! This cake is foolproof, moist, with a to- die-for streusel. I prepared the recipe as written and must say the currants and cinnamon balance the intensity of the sugar and chocolate in the streusel beautifully. I wouldn't change a thing. MINI BUNDTS. I baked this cake in two 6 cup bundt forms and it worked beautifully, in spite of the fact that I overfilled one pan to the point of overflow and forgot to adjust the baking time due to the smaller sized forms. The flavor and moist richness of the cake was unaffected by my miscalculation. DRYNESS. Quatsch! Unlike other reviewers, I had no problems with moistness, in spite of the fact that I overcooked my mini- cakes and scorched the top of one of the two cakes, it still came out moist. I used full-fat 20% sour cream and the result was to die for. Stick to the recipe and you won't be disappointed. I will make this cake again and again and again, just as written.

Rating: 3
This was very good. I followed the recipe with great results but I would have baked slightly less (maybe 50-55 minutes) than an hour. I should have checked earlier but it was a little dry with 1 hr baking time. Could be my oven though so my advice would be to test it at 50 min.

Rating: 3
I make this cake without the cocoa or currants. It is lovely as a plain, cinnamon and walnut coffee cake. My only criticism is that the filling is fairly strong -- use less cinnamon if you intend to serve this to children or anyone who would prefer a less intense cinnamon flavor.

Rating: 0
After reading all the reviews, I decided to try this with 2 extra tablespoons of butter to minimize any dryness and used a very fancy non-stick bundt pan sprayed with Pam, added extra cocoa and cinnamon to the sugar mixture. Careful not to overbake, this cake didn't go the full hour. I also did 4 layers instead of three and used almost all of the sugar mixture. Result? So beautiful I wish I had a picture! Came out of the pan with ease, very dense, moist and flavorful. I really would have taken a picture if I could download it. The next time, I will add some orange zest to the sugar mixture for added dimension. I personally don't think it is necessary to put any kind of frosting on this. This will be my son's breakfast birthday cake from his mother, the KitchenBitch.

This is a nice cake. very moist. I made it twice and the first time I put to much batter in the first layer so It was difficult at the end to cover the second layer of streusel. I would recommend using less than 1/3 batter on the first layer.

I've made this 10+ times and am now known for it and get requests from the boyfriends work buddies.

I was disappointed with this cake. I followed the recipe to the letter and had high expectations. The streusel was GREAT; however, the cake was dry. My husband took a big chunk of cake and only ate the streusel, and he loves coffee cake. I hoped that after sitting for a day it would moisten up, but it never did. I ended up tossing it. Maybe I did something wrong, but I'm not interested in another try when there are so many more coffee cake recipes out there. If you try it, I hope it works for you.

Rating: 4
Like almost everyone else, I made one slight alteration. I didn't have enough currants on hand and substituted my dried fruit mix I make up to add to steel cut oats in the mornings. Confession time: I made a GREAT BIG boo boo putting the ingredients together. After the fifth interruption, I realized I added the flour to the sugar/nut mix.. Well, you can't just pick it out! So I went ahead and reasoning that if it turned out terribly, I would put it in everyone's lunches.... I mixed everything together, didn't tell anyone and turned it out about 9 pm. By morning, half of it was gone... They liked it! A lot! This one is a keeper! Goes to show if you use great ingredients, you just can't go wrong ( or almost). HOWEVER, next time I promise to follow the the instructions correctly!

excellent coffee cake. Served it at a brunch to rave reviews. Use all the streusel, careful to insert first layer soon enough to allow for cake between two layers. I used dried cranberries soaked in cherry brandy (heat brandy, pour over, soak for @1/2 hr, drain). Raisins, currents all would work well in this receipe.

I thought that this recipe was delicious. I only made two changes from the original. Like several other reviewers, I used dried cherries instead of currants. I thought that the glaze looked a little bland. I searched through some of my cookbooks and found a brown butter glaze in Classic Home Desserts by Richard Sax. It was delicious and only took a few minutes longer to make than the original. Here it is: 1/4 cup unsalted butter (softened), 2 cups sifted confectioner's sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla extract, 2 tablespoons milk ---Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the butter is nut-brown, 5 to 7 minutes; do not burn. Pour the brown butter into a bowl, leaving any dark sediment or foam behind. Add the confectioner's sugar, vanilla and milk and stir until smooth. Add more milk if you need to thin. Add more sugar if you need to thicken. It should be easy to spread.

This is addicting,I make it weekly with some variations(incorporating coconut streusel recipe from this site). A little too sweet for my taste, so I've reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and white sugar to 1 cup. I use more cocoa powder than required and fill the half portion of the walnuts with toasted flaked coconuts. I also add 1 cup toasted coconuts on the batter at the end. The result is a moist cake with a hint of coconut texture. My husband, who's not a big cake and coconut fan can't get enough of it. Oh, be careful to keep raisins away fron the sides of the pan to prevent sticking.

The first time that I made this I substituted MEJOOL DATES for the currants. The Mejool dates have a creamy butter-caramel flavor, they are nothing like other dates I've tried. Before you snicker at the thought of dates, give them a try. I have made this many times, always to rave reviews.

This was a great coffee cake -- not a dinner party type of cake but a "let's have a few friends drop by for coffee and cake." It was easy and fast to put together.

This was DELICIOUS and won rave reviews from the people I shared it with. I used chopped dried cherries instead of currants, which worked well. It seemed like too much streusel but I put it all in two layers and when it was baked, the proportion of cake to streusal was just right. It only took 50 minutes to bake and I think I even could have taken it out five minutes earlier. It kept perfectly well in the fridge for three days (might have kept longer, but I can't tell because it was all eaten).

It was incredible. I used a "Dr. Oetker" brand bundt pan and the cake just jumped out of the pan. My family loved it. Had no currants so I used dried cranberries and did 3 layers instead of 2. Next time I will save more streusel for the top, I mean bottom. Great recipe!

Rating: 3
Wonderful coffee cake, especially when still warm! The layers look beautiful. I made 3 (instead of 2) layers of streusel, yet still could manage to use up only half of it. Strange. Guess I will have to use it up by making another batch of batter. Yes, the batter was extremely thick and does need to be spooned into place. And I also had to double the milk to make the glaze workable. No problems with sticking; the cake popped right out.

Rating: 3
This recipe will become my staple coffee cake (and 4 forks' worthy) if I can get it not to stick. I think the streusel is what is making it stick. Regardless, it really was very moist and delicious. I cut back a little on the streusel but won't do that again. It was wonderful. Only change I made was leaving out the currents. Wouldn't dream of leaving out the cocoa and may even throw in some finely grated chocolate next time. Scrumptious.

This cake was wonderful and looked very pretty. I was especially looking for something I could make a day ahead and this was perfect. I have two recommendations, however: first, I found that 2 Tablespoons of milk were needed for the glaze to be pour-able. Second, although the instructions say to let it cool for 1 hour before glazing, mine was still warm and the glaze mostly ran off the cake. Common sense should have told me to wait longer, but... Overall a very good and impressive cake that can be made ahead of time.

Should have read the reviews first, as this cake stuck horribly, despite the fact that I buttered and floured the pan. Will try shortening and flour next time.

This is really excellent. Very moist. I used Penzeys chinese cassia cinnamon and left out the cocoa. It was wonderfully flavorful. To those who suggest cutting back on the streusel - DON'T LISTEN TO THEM!!!! I wouldn't cut back a tablespoon of that delicious filling. I made sure to not have the filling touch the sides of the pan, as others have suggested, and it came out of my bundt pan perfectly (even though it was just sprayed Pam).

This cake is AMAZING. I left the currants out all together and for the glaze, I used water and almond extract instead of milk. This added an extra great flavor without the glaze tasting so gritty. Instead of buttering and flouring the pan just put parchment in the bottom...perfect every time. Enjoy!

Great addition to Christmas brunch! Personally I loved the addition of the cocoa in the struesel .... added a rich flavour without being chocolate-y. To help unmold the cake, try not to place struesel next to the cake pan, keep it in the centre of the batter.

What happened was, I added too much batter to the first layer, then I didn't have enough to do two more batter layers and a second streusel layer. So I made just one streusel layer using about half of mix...The streusel really takes this cake the distance, would have been so much better with all of it! Don't make the same mistake I did!

This cake was the best. It was so moist and delicious and very easy to make. The streusal was sumptuous. I especially liked the addition of cocoa. I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it.

I HAVE MADE THIS CAKE BY REQUEST SO MANY TIMES, IT IS SUCH A HIT!!!! I ALSO SUBSTITUTE A SMALL HANDFUL OF RAISINS INSTEAD OF CURRANTS. FOR CALORIE COUNTERS, USE "LIGHT"(NOT FAT-FREE)SOUR CREAM AND 1% OR 2% MILK FOR ICING WORKS AS WELL --IT IS STILL YUMMY. ALWAYS SPRAY NON-STICK ON PAN RIGHT BEFORE YOU POUR BATTER--IT WILL NOT STICK IF YOU DO.

The best coffee cake I've ever made! My house mates all loved it. I'd make it again in a second.

This cake was so easy to make! It looked and tasted delicious...left out currants, used cake flour and light sour cream. No problems at all! Cake slid right out of buttered pan, held together well, and it was anything but gooey. Perfect! Will make again soon!

I don't know what the fuss it about. There is way too much streusel and it was too gooey. The family liked it better than I did, but I have numerous other coffee cake recipes that are much, much better than this one. Not another time.

Great result - Everyone like it and asked for the recipe but I have another cofee cake with sour cream recipe which comes out so much better.

I made this recipe for my family - very moist I too omitted the currants and did not subsitute anything (not needed). My husband and daughter loved it. A great cake anytime - easy to make and "fool" proof. even if you don't bake try this one you can't miss

This cake is REALLY good! Super moist! I made 2/3 of the recipe in a glass 6 cup loaf pan instead and had to bake for about 1 hr 15 min at 350 F but will use the bundt pan next time. I think you can cut the sugar down to slightly more than 1 cup from 1 1/2 cups. And don't think worry about overbaking this cake and drying it out - I don't think that's possible.

This cake was great! I made it for my co-workers, and they gobbled it up. My big boss in the corner office left me TWO voicemails about how much he liked it! It was also easy to make. I left out the currants (they didn't seem to make much difference), and used light sour cream. I also used all the streusel and didn't have any problems. This one is a keeper!

I used a 13x9 stone pan and layered it because I don't have a bundt pan. I use raisins and no icing.Every time I make it everyone wants the recipe. You have to use ALL the streusel, that is what makes it different from all the rest of the coffee cakes!

Fabulous, Based on the reviews I didn't add all the struesel but next time I will.Yum.

I've made this cake twice and have gotten nothing but great reviews. I forgo the currants all together and even cut down on some of the sugar in the struesel and the cake and it came out great. I sprayed my bundt pan with Bakers Joy and it slid right out. This dessert travels well.

Delicious! I used cake flour and the cake was so moist yet light. I also omitted the currants and the glaze. I greased the bundt pan well and had no problems with the cake crumbling or falling apart - it was beautiful!

This was simply delicious. My husband isn't wild about raisins or currants so I substituted dried cherries and it was great. Everyone at our tailgate breakfast loved it. Thanks

I made this cake for a football game tailgaiter. It was great, except I'm a novice and it completely fell apart. Everyone liked it who braved to try it. It did not look appetizing. Any suggestions?? The frosting was a little funky too, any suggestions there???

Absolutely the best coffee cake I have ever made. I used Wilton's Cake Release to grease my bundt pan and had no trouble extracting the cake, it slid right out of the pan. I used ALL of the struesel and thought it was delish! Did not have whole milk for the icing so I used skim and it was a bit runny so I added more confectionary sugar and it was fine for drizzling. Next time, I will use whole milk. Icing was an added "yum" but not needed, this cake is wonderful on its own.

Very very good. I added diced apples mixed with some brown sugar to it, and loved the way it came out. As others said though, there was probably too much filling-- I ended up not even using about 1/4 of it. But the cake was moist and delicious, and very easy.

Rating: 3
Like other reviewers, I thought this cake was yummy, but the abundance of streusel makes it difficult to cut and serve without crumbling. Next time I'll either reduce the amount of streusel, or try cutting in some chilled butter to bind the mixture.

This is an excellent cake. No need for currants or a replacement, such as chocolate chips. I also do not think the icing is necessary, it is plenty sweet without it. I made it in a 12 cup angel food cake pan as I did not have a bundt pan and the 2 layers of filling merged together to make one large one...this did not matter as it still sliced when cooled and disappeared at the brunch. I made it again in a 6 cup fluted cake pan with 1 layer of filling and 12 muffins, also with 1 layer of filling, and I missed the filling though the cakes were still inhaled. Someone could make a fortune selling these cakes...

this coffecake was a huge hit at my boyfriend's mom's birthday weekend. it was eaten both as a breakfast treat and a dessert. definitely too much filling, and be sure to heed the warnings of not putting too much batter into the bundt pan for the first layer. i ended up with not quite enough batter for the end and whenever i tried to pick up a piece it broke off at the bottom layer of streusal. i'm making it again for a brunch i'm giving in a couple of weeks. it's delicious!

This was absolutely marvelous. I made it for a co-worker's brunch party, and she raved about it for days. So i had to make one for myself to try. I substitued the currants for chocolate chips, and it was loved by all that tried it. I make this all the time now. Its one of my favorites.

Two thumbs up...way up!! excellent coffee cake recipe. I think the coca powder gives it that special depth of flavor. I didn't have any problem with unmolding the cake from the pan. I greased and floured a cast aluminum, non-stick, 12 cup Bundt pan. It has a dark exterior, so I reduced the cooking temp by 25 degrees. The cake came out moist and delicious. I omitted the currants and used "all" of the streusel. I will make this again and again and have e-mailed it to all my friends. Thanks Epicurious!

This is the best sour cream coffee cake I have ever tasted. The combination of ingredients makes it unique and satisfying. A great brunch recipe!

This is a marvelous coffee cake recipe. My husband even wants me to make it for his birthday cake next year. Coffee cake recipes don't get better than this. It's a very easy recipe to make. Three comments: 1. I too left out the currents. They weren't missed. 2. Rhiannon Gammill wisely suggested to "add streusel the first layer with a gentle hand or else it will seep through the cake and stick to the pan, creating a holy disaster in what would otherwise be a delish coffee cake." 3. No matter how well you grease your non-stick bundt pan, it is very important once the cake cools to cut around the pan sides to loosen the cake, or you might (heaven forbid!) lose part of your cake to your pan.

I made it with plain whole milk yogurt instead of sour cream and it was delicious. However, it self-destructed when I tried to extract it from the Bundt pan, even though the pan was very well greased. Maybe a different kind of pan would work better

This recipe is a keeper! I brought this coffee cake to my staff meeting this morning - and everyone enjoyed it. I have already had requests to bring it for next month's meeting!

WARNING, add streusel the first layer with a gentle hand or else it will seep through the cake and stick to the pan, creating a holy disaster in what would otherwise be a delish coffee cake. I used 2 8 oz cartons of Low fat Lemon yogurt instead of the sour cream and there was no noticible difference. I would make it again, but maybe in 2 layers, with the struesel sprinkled on top of each layer about 10 minutes into cooking.

I made this as part of a mother's day brunch and it was a huge hit! Unlike a lot of coffee cakes that are heavy and too sweet for my taste, this one was a light-textured masterpiece perfectly complemented by a glass of brut champagne! I didn't have any currants, but they weren't missed.

I have been making coffee cakes for years and this is THE BEST coffee cake I have ever made. I have been requested to make it for a Mother's Day picnic this weekend. I think the cocoa makes the filling. The only thing I changed was I left out the currants. It is so moist. The first time I tried it I didn't use all the filling, as other reviewers had suggested, and the next time I used all the filling. I definitely will use all the filling. It is a favorite in my house and I hope it is in yours too!!!!

This is the best steusel coffee cake I have ever made. I've made it several times and every time it tastes wonderful. My sister said it's to-die-for. I get my cinnamon and cocoa powder from Penzey's spice catalog - I think good ingredients make all the difference!

This cake is absolutely rich, moist, and scrumptious --seems to make a lot of struesel, but swirl it all in there and you'll come out with the most delectable coffe cake! Also works well as muffins.

I made a few substitutions to lower the fat/calories and the cake was still excellent. Non fat sour cream worked fine. I substitued four egg whites for two of the eggs. For the glaze I used about 1/2 c of confectioners sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and enough milk to achieve drizzling consistency. That was just enough to make thin, zig-zag lines on top. People at work gave it a excellent review.

This is a delicious recipe! I think the icing recipe is wrong - needed more than 1 tablespoon - I just added enough to make it 'drizzling consistency'. The cake was super-moist with a wonderful texture, and the streusel has excellent flavor - highly recommended by me and my Mom.

Due to the fact that my bundt pan is only a 10 cup measurement, I used a large square angel food pan. It worked great. I used the entire streusal mixture, as the recipe called for, and everyone thought it was FABULOUS!! The cake and filling tasted like the mall's "CINABON" cinnamon rolls. I added 2 ounces of cream cheese to the frosting and a Tbls spoon of melted butter. The icing is all I changed, everything was perfect!!! YUMMY

On the advice of other reviews, I didn't use all of the streusel mixture, but the whole thing came out of the oven gooey and delicious, almost like cinnamon buns. I halved the recipe and made a smaller bundt cake and it was a huge hit!

Rich, moist. Makes lots of streusel - I had plenty left over to sprinkle on top of the cake (so I didn't need the glaze). I added two tablespoons of instant espresso powder to the batter, omitted the currants, and cut down on the cinnamon.

This is probably the richest, moistest, most scrumptious coffee cake I've ever made! Leftovers tasted terrific, too. I left out the currants and skipped the glaze and the cake didn't miss them a bit. The next time I would reduce the amount of streusel by about one-third. It was almost too rich. All in all, though, this cake's a four-fork keeper!

This cake is delicious and moist. However, no one in my family will touch a raisin, so left out the currants and used pecans rather than walnuts. Also there is an error in the amount of milk you need for the powdered sugar. It should read 2 Tbls instead of 1. 1 is not enough to make an icing that will drizzle. This is a perfect cake to take to church or school functions. If you leave it in your kitchen, it will go very fast!!

I've made this at least five times and everyone always raves about it. The sour cream makes the cake exteremely moist. Keeps well, but best eaten warm.

This is an outstanding cake. It was a hit from the first time I made it. I have had more requests for the recipe then any other cake I've made. Put some of the streusel mixture on the bottom of the pan before you put the batter in and it gives a extra good taste. Mix the ingredients realy well for a even moister cake texture. Outstanding recipe.

I brought this to a brunch & it was an absolute hit. The only problem I had making this was to get the strusel evenly distributed in the center of the cake. But, in any case, it was well liked by all & I plan to make it again this afternoon.
