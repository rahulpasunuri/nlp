Just okay. Not terribly flavorful.

This was delicious - even my picky teenager loved it! Mine needed an extra 1 cup fluid while in crock pot. My crock pot is larger than that noted in the recipe, so I assume it was increased surface area affecting evaporation. No worries, though -- it made a very tasty meal! I served with couscous.

This was a very hearty meal... Great for a hot dinner on a cold winter day! I gratefully took advice from previous reviewers, adding carrots, celery, and potatoes to the onion/garlic mixture (without flour). Next time i will probably skip the potatoes and add bella mushrooms and perhaps garbanzo beans. I used three pounds of boneless, skinless chicken breasts which called for additional liquid, so I doubled the crushed tomatoes (to 28 oz.) and the white wine (to I cup). I also added a teaspoon of garlic salt and a tablespoon of herbs de Provence. Finally, I added a handful of green and black olives and a healthy splash (maybe 1/4 cup) of olive juice at the start of cooking. Then I let ithe whole thing stew in the slow cooker on low for about 6 hours after which the chicken kept its shape, but could be easily pulled apart with a fork. Yummy :)

We very much enjoyed this recipe. I didn't do in slow cooker, but on stovetop in my Staub pot. Even better next day. Used chicken legs and boneless breasts. Served with mashed potatoes. So easy wth few ingredients. A great fall dinner.

Chicken so tender it DID fall off the bone. Flavors were well matched. Dinner that I didn't fuss over. This was very good!!!

Having read the other reviews, I added celery and mushrooms to the onions along with some fresh rosemary (not much) and herbs de provence (1TB). After the tomatoes were added, I included some kalamata olives (about 12). Didn't seem to need as much cooking time in the saute pan as suggested. Definitely take the skin off the chicken! I used thighs and legs. Let it cook on low in the crock pot for about 5 1/2 hours. Served it over egg noodles and served topped with a little more rosemary, a few kalamata olives and a little feta cheese. Yummy!

This was great with some doctoring. Started by browning sliced andouille sausage prior to the chicken. Used dark meat only - thighs and drumsticks, and kept the skin on. Also added carrots, mushrooms, two bay leaves and some freshly ground herbes de provence. Nom nom nom.

I followed the recipe as written (not something I normally do, just wanted to see how it'd work out) and found it pretty blah, not at all like I'd expect from Provence. I would have added mushrooms and maybe sausage if I'd had them on hand, and instead ended up making a pretty delightful curry with it.

This was 3 forks -- not 4. Boyfriend loved it, I thought it was a little bland. I threw a can of sliced black olives into this, per some suggestions, as well as some bella mushrooms with the onions which I think added some flavor. Certainly doable again since its a slow cooker and has good leftovers.

Absolutely loved this reccipe. I made it exactly as stated the first time and it was delightful. The second time I made this recipe, I added carrots, celery and mushrooms while sauting the onions. The third time, I made dumplings... the drop type, perfect. However, this may have removed the "Provencal" feel. Warm, delicious and simple!

I'm amazed how high this recipe is rated. As nearly everyone else, I substantially doctored this recipe and it turned out excellent. I used bone-in-chicken breasts, broth, fresh chopped tomatoes, NO tomato paste, olives, garlic, potatoes and a LOT of herbes de provence. I'd recommend using boneless skinless chicken breasts if you're leaving the chicken in for longer than 8 hours. After that, split chicken breasts will completely disintegrate and you'll spend forever picking out bones out of the mix.

Rating: 3
I used this recipe more as a guideline or starting point after reading other reviewers complaints. I substituted chicken broth for the wine, used fresh chopped tomatoes and tomato paste, lots of rosemary instead of basil and lost the olives. I also seasoned very generously and added three extra cloves of garlic. I threw in chunks of potato too. It was wonderful! I strongly recommend substituting Rosemary if nothing else.

My husband and I both enhoy this recipe. He likes it because he loves the taste of the tomatos with the chicken. Browinging the chicken in the flour before adding it to the slow cooker really gives it a great texture and flavor. I like this recipe because of how "easy" it is to make. There is some prep work. The night before I make this dish, I cut the onion and put it in the fridge with the thawed chicken breasts (I don't use a whole chicken). In the morning, while my 16 month eats breakfast in her high chair, I brown the meat and do the other prep steps. Sometimes I have to pause and entertain her for a bit, but usually I can't do the prep work pretty quickly. Then I put it in the slow cooker, and go to work! I don't use olives, or parsley, or basil most of the time because I usually don't have any.

As written, it is "ok." I loosely followed the recipe, adding herbs and chicken broth and other veg. The quality of your canned tomatoes is very important here. Use good ones - go to an Italian market.

Mmmmm! Made this on our ski trip last week so we'd have dinner ready upon our return to the condo. It cooked a little too long & still tasted wonderful. I prepared as directed - maybe threw in a little more wine than the recipe called for. Didn't have fresh basil but I did include the olives. Served over mashed potatoes with a crusty roll & more wine - delicious.

Very flavorful and tender. Loved the sauce and would not add any extra liquid as you do not need to do so in a slow cooker, and to do so would dilute the concentration of flavors. Will make it again!

Delicious...added some Herbs de Provence, bay leaf, and green olives. Last hour I took the lid off to cook off some liquid. Would be delicious with mash potatoes or roasted potatoes and vegetables on the side. Nice home cooked meal!

I chose this recipe for guests because there would be no work right before dinner. I used all the suggestions from prior reviewers.Tbe Herbs de Provence added a lot but I should have used 2T rather than 1T. Guests were impressed but then again, guests are usually polite. I'm looking forward to seeing if left overs are more flavorful. As per other reviewers the jury is still out on this one.

Rating: 3
I read all the reviews before trying this dish so had an idea of what others thought about the dish and what I needed to do so it wasn't quite so bland. All the reviewers were right on with their comments. I had legs and thighs with the skin on so decided that would add flavor. Didn't dredge them in flour but browned them in oil and put them in the cooker which saved a lot of time. Added way more garlic, lots of herbs and extra tomatoes as well as more white wine. Served it over brown rice and while the sauce was nice, still needed something so I threw on some feta at serving time along with some toasted almonds for texture and crunch which helped a lot. Had lots of left overs so took the meat off the bone, mixed it with the sauce and served it over pasta with grated parmmesan cheese. Worked perfectly.

Rating: 3
I would make this recipe again, but it did need some tinkering. Taking into account the previous reviews, I added herbes de provence, some chili flakes, much more garlic and onion, and used the juice from the kalamata olives in the stew mixture. I also added the olives a good 1-2 hours in advance of serving, which worked nicely. I didn't happen to have white wine handy, so I used red, which made it a bit like a coq au vin. In the end, it was a very nice pot luck dish, served over rice.

Rating: 2
After reading multiple reviews, I had an idea of how much this recipe needed doctoring up. Well, it was still somewhat tasteless; chicken in tomatoes, that's it! I may use it as a starting place, but this definitely needs some beefing up before serving.

Rating: 1
Previous reviews recommended adding more herbs, wine, tomatoes, etc. Thankfully I did that, but still ended up with a bland dish. The basil and olives for the topping made a huge difference, but the flavor should come from the main part of the dish and not rely on the toppings. Will look for another crock pot chicken stew recipe.

Rating: 4
Great recipe - both kids and adults loved it. A few changes - I was pressed for time so I bought skinned chicken parts and did not saute them, I sauteed the onion and garlic and then just dumped everything in the cooker. It was still good and a lot less work. Don't skimp on the olives at the end, people were fighting over them. The chicken is quite moist.

Rating: 3
I will make this again although it did take me a little over an hour to prepare before the slow cooker came in, what with the skinning and cutting of the chicken, cooking etc. I am not the fastest cook but still. The flavor was nice. I used 5 cloves of garlic, an extra can of diced tomatoes and a can of cannellini beans. I also peppered the chicken and added salt to the tomato mixture. I didn't have any wine so i had to use chicken broth. i will try to use wine next time as i think it will really add to the flavor, but still quite yummy! (just a side note, 3/4 cup flour for the chicken is far more than necessary)

Rating: 3
With thanks to previous reviewers, I made several of the suggested changes and what I ended up with respectably tasty comfort food that I will make again. Changes I made: used fire-roasted diced tomatoes in place of crushed; added a 28-ounce can of plum tomatoes w/juice; didn't chop the onion very fine but made sure to get it nice and caramelized (so didn't add the flour to it until after 10 minutes or so); used 4 cloves of garlic (5 would have been fine); used 3/4 cup wine; added 1T herbes de provence to the pot; used more salt. For chicken, I bought 4 breasts and 4 thighs, about 4 pounds' worth before skinning. Cooked for just over 3 hours. Removed the meat from the bones after cooking and returned the meat to the crock pot. Omitted the basil garnish. The olive garnish is a must. I was very happy with the result.

Rating: 3
I did not use a whole chicken, I agree with a previous reviewer that the bones would be unpleasant if cooked so long that the meat "fell off the bones". I added more garlic, caramelized the (sliced) onions well. I also added diced sun-dried tomatoes along with red pepper flakes. I did not add olives only because I had none, I would add good quality olives in the future. Watch the cooking time, especially with boneless chicken to prevent it from drying out. My husband loved it. I'm always looking for quality slow-cooker recipes. Will make again.

I followed all your suggestions here. THANKS SO MUCH! Used flour only on chicken (completely not needed for veggies)), added thyme, plum tomatoes, Herbs, and additional wine. In addition (and worth mentioning) we used a new crock pot (allclad) with bowl okay to use for browning and we must say, it kicks up crock pot cooking a serious knotch. I'm giving this recipe three stars because it did dry out. Next time I'll reduce cooking time by one hour.

Rating: 0
I found this recipe lacking in flavor and too fatty. dredging the chicken in flour added empty calories and held the fat. Basil was not a complimentary herb. I will not cook this again.

Rating: 4
This was really good - it just needed a bit more seasoning as others have said. I salted/peppered the chicken, then put it in seasoned flour. I also salted the onions as they browned, and salted again before the liquid went in the slow cooker. I also added a sprig of thyme, 2 bay leaves, and a teaspoon of dried herbs de provence. It was wonderful! Can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!

I made this a couple of weeks ago and it came out wonderfully. It could have been more flavorful, which is why I didn't give this 4 forks, but you can adjust the seasoning easily enough.

Simply terrible. I even added extra tomatoes, garlic and fresh herbs and it was still tasteless.

This is very good. I made it in the oven rather than the crockpot because I didn't have time to get it going in the morning, and it worked just fine (350 for about 30 minutes). I used four cloves of garlic instead of one, used about 20 oz. of tomatoes and added green beans toward the end. My husband and 2 teenage boys loved it.

This is simple and absolutely delicious meal! When I've got leftover cooked chicken, I shred it and make this, and that only takes about 2 hours in the slow cooker to meld the flavors.

Rating: 3
I thought this was a great recipe, especially with some additions that really enhanced it and gave it some great depth. I added a can of whole plum tomatoes in addition to the crushed, a few healthy dashes of worchester sauce, 1 chicken bouillon cube, fresh sage and oregano in addition to the basil and parsley, and some sauteed mushrooms and zucchini for some added texture and flavor. Also in my opinion 1 garlic clove is not nearly enough - I used about 4 or 5. The additions were awesome and this meal was a HUGE hit with my family.

Rating: 3
I really liked this recipe. It was exceptionally easy and I only made a few alterations. I used dried (I know fresh is always preferred, it was in the pantry. Forgive me epicureans.) parsley and doubled the garlic. Since the parsley was dry I was able to add it in the beginning, giving the chicken alot of flavor.

Recommended changes: * double the amount of crushed tomatoes to 29 oz. or two 14-ounce cans * add 1 Tbsp herbes de Provence * increase white wine to 3/4 cup

This was great. I used Madeira instead of white wine, and fire roasted tomatoes, and a few green beans the last hour. I would definitely make this again.

This was my first dish cooked in a new slow cooker and it's a keeper. I used boneless breast and thighs, doubled the tomatoes (san marzano variety gives a really nice boost) and added some fresh thyme. I put the olives in during the last hour of cooking and served over brown rice. It was nicely carmelized around the edges and had wonderful flavor.

Too many tomatoes in this recipe.

I doubled the tomato portion of recipe and added more garlic (quite a bit more.) I also added a finely chopped Serrano chili for a little spice. I baked a loaf of crusty bread to go with it which was perfect. I do think it would be good with a side of green veg or perhaps couscous.

This recipe is not worth the effort. The chicken does not turn out flavorful at all. Thank heaven for the parsley, basil, and olives....otherwise this dish would have been inedible. Do not want.

I modified this recipe a little by cooking only two chicken breasts since it's just my husband and I, and it turned out great!!! I also used wheat flour instead of all purpose and added a little more salt than recommended after reading the reviews. The results were great, my husband loved it and so did I! What I loved most is that it's extremely easy to make.

Made as described, turned out well. Yes, it is a little bland at first, but with salt, pepper and the garnishes I was happy with the result. The flavors blend over time, and the leftovers are even better.

This is a fantastic stew. There is a bit of up-front work, but it is worth it. I used a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes with basil instead, and I did not use the parsley, basil leaves, or olive garnish. Chicken was falling off the bone after 5 hours. Delicious. I will make this again.

Rating: 1
Two words, DON'T BOTHER! The previous reviews seemed about 50/50 so I thought I would give this recipe a chance. That was a mistake! This recipe took far to much prep and the payoff was disappointing. The flavor was just OK, the olives completely overwhelmed the dish , and the fact that I was picking through bones during dinner was extremely unappealing. Maybe if you used boneless chicken, but I won't bother with this one again. I have made far more delicious and satisfying slow cooker recipes with 1/10th the effort...skip this one, really!

Rating: 2
This recipe was good, but not great. The flavors were very mild (almost blah) and we thought it definitely needed a little more pizazz, something to brighten it up. I little extra salt did help some.

Rating: 3
Very good, easy & healthy. I used slightly less olive oil than the recipe called for & it turned out fine. One note - this was falling off the bone tender for me at 4 hours (with the slowcooker on low). So I would definitely reiterate what other reviewers have said...this is a slowcooker recipe for when you're around to keep an eye on it, not to turn on & then leave for work. Start it late Sunday morning & you'll have good smells from the kitchen all day & a great Sunday dinner. We ate it with some polenta & an arugala salad.

This was yummy! I made it with a few changes. I didn't have white wine so I used red wine and I used fresh chopped tomatoes. I also replaced the fresh herbs with dried because I was out of fresh herbs. I omitted the olives and not everyone in my family likes it. I cooked it for 5 hours. Delicious!

Yummy. Despite the fact that this is called a stew, it is not one big mush of stuff the way so many slow cooker recipes are - at least when we cooked it, it turned out chicken with a wonderful sauce. We used chicken broth instead of wine.

I made this recipe the oldd-fashioned way: on the stove, as we always do in the Netherlands. Could anyone tell me: can you also cook rice in a slow cooker? I live in China, where you can buy rice cookers anywhere. I had never heard of slow cookers before, but maybe I can buy them here, too .

Terrific recipe that can be pulled together either the night before or in the morning before work. If you are looking for a good slow cooker recipe cookbook, you have found it. I have tried several of the recipes in this book and they are excellent.
