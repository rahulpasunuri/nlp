This is a family favourite (once a fortnight at least), although we prefer a different Harissa sauce with the chicken - We give the chicken a 4+ forks though and the pan scrapings are an ideal base for frying onions, nuts etc ready to stir through the cous cous.

This is delectable. The only change I made was to use olive oil in place of peanut oil. The chicken I brined for two days. The Harissa sauce goes with this perfectly. A wonderful dish.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't read the whole recipe and two hours before company arrived, I started to marinade the chicken and realized I was supposed to marinade much longer. I fried the chicken, then poured remaining marinade over chicken before placing in oven. The result--a crispy, crunchy crust and extremely moist chicken. My friends still rave about it 6 months later.

Very nice! As everyone says, the house smells of cinnamon while cooking, and we really enjoyed the dish. I too didn't bother to fry, and I just poured some flour in a large zip-lok bag to dredge the chicken one piece at a time. It was messy going, but worth it in the end. I'm also convinced that the drippings left in the roasting pan would make the basis of a good gravy. I'm going to give that a try next time.

This has long been a favorite recipe of mine, but instead of 1 teaspoon of sugar, I use 1 Tablespoon. It adds a lot more depth to the recipe. The accompanying harissa sauce is perfect as is.

Not crazy about this one. The chicken was ok, and although different, the harissa wasn't for me.

My husband I weren't too crazy about this one. The flavor was good and we love the sauce, but the texture of the skin was not appealing. Next time I will just marinate boneless skinless chicken breasts and saute them. Served with the potato/garbanzo bean paties also from this site.

Chicken was just OK, but the harissa was superb!

The chicken is fine by itself. But, superb with the Harrisa Sauce.

Ok, a little too much of a cinnamon taste.

Easy & different. Great with couscous.

I am going to give this recipe another chance since all the reviews were so positive but I thought it was disappointing the first time around. I don't know what happened but the cinnamon flavour was hardly noticeable even though I marinated the chicken for 2 days and the house smelled like I was baking wonderful cinnamon rolls when I was cooking it.

Made the chicken, didn't have time for the sauce, served it with carrot couscous(epicurious too)and toasted pitas, wished I'd done a yoghurt sauce. The chicken was so good, when you think of the ingredients, some people might think, 'ew'. I sprinkled my chicken pieces with Wondra flour, instead of dredging them. This dish is so easy yet exotic tasting.

I loved this recipe. Made this for a dinner party with another couple and the husbands, who are bonafide red meat lovers, were very impressed. I made it with the lemon-saffron rice and moroccan carrots found here on epicurious -- very good combination. For a starter -- figs, goat cheese and prosciutto. For dessert, fresh oranges in honey cinnamon sauce. I'll be making this again!

very unusual and lovely. all my guests enjoyed it although some were less sure about the harissa. I would recommend serving it with (greek style) yogurt to help soften the heat of the chilli.

I am in the minority on this one, but ... the chicken was interesting, but the sauce took over everything, or I should say the caraway took over everything. I would like to try the chicken with a Mole sauce, as I will not make the other sauce again.

Very flavorful and easy. DH said "this is really good" after every bite. The marinade is so easy that it can be used year around from summer grilling to tagines.

This recipe is excellent and I use it with all kinds of fowl. I prefer to cook the fowl very slowly in the juices of the marinade over a small flame. The harissa sauce is utter superb. I grind the coriander and caraway before mixing them with the other ingredients. I applaud Helen's of Richmond Virginia for this recipe.

Great taste. The sauce does make a subtle but very interesting difference. Kids loved the chicken but not the sauce.

yowsa--fast and easy! we'll be adding this to our weeknight repetoire.

This was fantastic! I made it for my sisters birthday party and everyone loved it. I did not use red pepper in the marinade for the kids. Also I forgot to dredge in the flour,(i guess I was having too good of a time)but it was still great. I used 1/2 the caraway in the harissa as a previous reviewer thought it was too much, and it turned out perfect. This is a unique dish and worth the effort. Wonderful!

I really disliked the harissa sauce. The roasted pepper taste was totally lost, and the caraway taste was overpowering. I also feared the cinnamon would be too much, but it was quite nice on the chicken. The instruction to "shake off marinade...and sprinkle all over with flour" is ridiculous; impossible to get even coating of flour. Better to dredge in bowl or bag. This really smoked in the oven.

Great recipe...really different. I didn't make the Harissa Sauce, but I'd like to try it. This came together nice and quick.

I have made this chicken several times now. I have not made the sauce with it- it's wonderful on its own. I also put the chicken in the marinade in a ziploc bag and freeze it and then it marinates as it defrosts - makes it even easier! The smell as it cooks in the oven is absolutely amazing!

This was interesting and good. I baked it only, to save effort and clean up. It was tender and juicy. I think I will use a blender for the sauce next time as the processor left the seeds whole. All in all a nice change of pace. My mother loved it, and took the recipe home with her.

Easy and tasty. Have made this several times and found longer marinating made it even better. Also tried baking only and found it to be okay but less juicy. Next time, I will reduce the caraway and the sugar in the Harissa, and will thin with water or chicken stock.

I made this for my more adventurous friends, and we all loved it! A great unexpected blend of flavors. I have a Nigerian friend who makes a similar sauce, and I've been trying to get the recipe to no avail. NOTE : I wouldn't serve to my mother who thinks garlic is exotic.

This was wonderful and unusual. I thought the cinnamon might be too much, but it wasn't. I did make one change. Instead of frying the chicken before baking, I just baked it. There was enough olive oil in the marinade to make it succulent and crisp. The harissa sauce is a must and balances the cinnamon perfectly. Served with a starter salad of lettuce with oranges and red onions (recipe on this site) and saffron couscous.
