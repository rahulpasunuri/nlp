Great recipe! Extremely easy to make, and tastes great. The thing I loved most is that the cookies stayed true to shape, even with my tricky small "Christmas Tree" cookie cutters. These stay semi-soft to the bite.

Made a double batch of these - took them to a party. They disappeared quickly. My friends said they couldn't stop eating them. Best sugar cookie response I've had. Made more as gifts - people loved me. Make these cookies and people will love you too. Or be selfish and keep them all for yourself. I don't care. Just make the cookies.

These always turn out fantastic. My go to recipe for every holiday (I have a cookie cutter for them all, and then some {thanks Patricia!}) I cannot get enough of the Dutch influence in almonds/marzipan, so I always omit the vanilla and add almond extract instead. My co-worker Erin is the next recipiant of these cookies - baby boy #3 is almost due!

I have tried many recipes for cut out cookies, and this one is the winner. It is easy to work with and uses all normal ingredients. I use my own icing recipe with it.

I have made these cookies many times. The dough is super easy to work with; much better than other recipes and EVERYONE raves about them. They are always a hit.

A near disaster, averted. The dough was not moist enough, but I added a bit of water at the end, and the dough worked out quite well. Really easy to work with, and the shapes held up beautifully. BUT, I followed the suggestion of a previous reviewer and used just coloured sugars instead of icing (black for bats and green for ghosts), and the cookies were nowhere near sweet enough. My son didn't want to bring them too his school because they were so blah. They looked really nice, but not a great cookie. I was able to save them by putting a variant of the vanilla icing mentioned below on top of the sugars, and then adding more coloured sugar on top of the icing. Now they look and taste good. In fact, now my son doesn't want to bring them to school because he wants to eat them all himself... Bottom line: I think some form of icing is a MUST. The cookies aren't sweet enough on their own.

A really easy and tasty recipe. I made them using mini animal cutters. A real hit for the kids.

I have made this recipe more times than I can count and it comes out perfectly each time. The dough is incredibly easy to work with and the cookies are delicious. I have developed a serious cookie cutter collection since I first used this recipe! To save time, I often just decorate them with colored sugars and sometimes sprinkles (often the decorative type made for cookies and cakes) and they are always a hit. I've only made the icing once, and while it was pretty, I'm not convinced it was any nicer than with the colored sugars.

perfect, I make all the time for showers parties etc. I just finished "As" for my son's first birthday. I like to add a splash of lemon extract. I prefer the icing from CHRISTMAS CUTOUTS WITH VANILLA ICING, which I also like to flavor with a little lemon extract

These were very good. I've made them twice and will make them again. I followed the recipe.
