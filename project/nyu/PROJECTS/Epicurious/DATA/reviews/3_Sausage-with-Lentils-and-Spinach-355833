I saw that earlier reviewers said that this was a little on the bland side, so I added some dried rosemary and oregano to the onions and mushrooms. I also deglazed the pan with white wine before adding the lentils. Turned out completely delicious! Will definitely make again, except maybe next time I will half the recipe as it made quite a bit for 2 people.

This was a great recipe. It was delicious, though I will say that I added marjoram as well as thyme. It came out very flavorful and the broth had a nice earthy quality to it from the musrhooms.

Very flavorful dish! I split the recipe in 1/2 and still had left overs. Loved it.

Bland. Blah. Tasteless. But at about a buck a serving, I didn't feel bad dumping the bulk of it down the disposal.

I really like this recipe. It's fast and hearty. Putting mushrooms in it didn't appeal to me, so I left them out. I actually added the spinach when I announced that dinner was ready, right before I served it, so that the spinach wasn't completely mushy.

This is a very yummy quick and hearty soup. I didn't have mushrooms in the house..i used celery instead. I also added an extra cup of broth and more spinach. I ended up cooking it for about 20 minutes longer than called for and finished the whole thing off w/ a little peccorino/romano. this was a huge hit! I'd totally make this again.

This was really satisfying! I added a few dashes of cinnamon and paprika with the thyme, but think it probably would have been fine without. I don't have a kitchen scale so couldn't weigh my lentils. I ended up not using enough for the amount of liquid used, but we toasted some wheat/nut bread and crumbled it into the soupy dish to soak up the liquid. Very very tasty. Next time I think I'll aim for about 3 cups+ of lentils for the 6 cups of broth.

I loved this dish, a great healthy weeknight option. I halved the recipe and added a little cinnamon and paprika to add some depth of flavor which I think helped quite a bit. I also finished it with a few shavings of parmesean cheese. I would suggest you make this one day a ahead as it tastes better the second day after the flavors really get a chance to meld.

I thought this was a pretty good weekday evening meal for the family - plus healthy. Although my kids only ate the sausage and not the lentils :-)

This was an alright recipe, although being so heavy on the Lentils and Mushrooms it can be a bit bland. If you want to give it a little bit of a boost, I recommend a dash of cumin or paprika. This recipe is also quite massive, so if you're cooking for one or even two cut the recipe in half.

This was very good, and I think my opinion of it is helped a good deal by the ease of preparation and the healthful ingredients. I made half of a recipe and the suggested cooking times were perfect. (Though I like lentils a little al dente.) I used only half of the oil and instead used chicken broth to keep the sausage and veggies from sticking. I don't know that I'd order it in a restaurant, but it's so easy that I know I'll be making it again.

This was a great dish. I suspect that if one thought it was not good that they may not have used a high quality kielbasa. Don't skimp. It makes the difference.

I was completely unimpressed and would not waste my time to make this again. I was hoping that it was one of those dishes that's "better the next day". Yeah, it's not.

A delicious meal-the flavors are layered and provide a depth to the taste that is great for a one dish meal. I substituted turkey kielbasa to keep the fat in check. I did find, however, that at 18 minutes the lentils were underdone and at 50 minutes were al dente. I also used a total of 7 cups of chicken broth to accommodate the additional cooking time. Otherwise this is a great and simple dish.
