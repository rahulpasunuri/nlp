That was super delicious! BUT, I think it's for 2 not 4... And I don't eat a lot either. But just one didn't seem like much and they're not super loaded... Anyway, do try!

The salsa is amazing. I've made it several times and received rave reviews each time. I also used mango instead of papaya, but either way, it's delicious. This recipe has become a standby of mine and I make it often.

OK/good, but I think I would choose something other than basil - it gives the quesadilla a slightly strange sour taste.

I love this recipe, enough so that I've made it twice since it was in the Parade Magazine a few weeks ago. However, I didn't need the entire 4T of lime juice; 2T was sufficient. I also substituted mango chucks for the papaya (minced to the same sized dice as the tomato). Oh, and the 2nd time I made it, I had no basil, so substituted a combo of fresh tarragon and oregano, because those herbs were the only ones that had started to take off. Either way, with fresh basil, or the combination of what was growing in my herb garden, it was great.

Pretty good. The addition of fresh cilantro and basil really added a nice, fresh flavour which makes this unique compared to the average quesadilla. I'm used to having tomatoes and/or salsa inside as well as on top of a quesadilla so I used a little of the salsa inside which tasted good but added a little too much liquid to the quesadilla. I'll make this again with the salsa inside but will do a better job of seeding the tomatoes and not using as much lime juice. Also, I didn't use papaya in the salsa and I don't think we missed much. Finally I found the prep time longer than I expected. I cooked uncooked chicken which added some time and I found that there was a lot of chopping. Next time, I'll save some time but not preparing the salsa seperately but add those ingedients straight to the quesadilla.
