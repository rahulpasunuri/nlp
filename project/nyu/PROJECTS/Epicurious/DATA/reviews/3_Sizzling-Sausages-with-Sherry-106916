I made this for a Spanish Wine Night with some friends, and this dish was a huge hit...and easy!

I made this dish with chorizo while I was studying in Salamanca -- delicious and easy!

This tastes very good, but looks kind of ugly. The sausage meat swelled up and pushed the sausage skin. I decided not to serve it at my tapas party because of its appearance.

I made this as an appetizer for a dinner party. Didn't change a thing and everyone loved it! It's quite a unique way to cook pork link sausages. The sherry gave it a nice flavor --delish!

I used chorizo (sp?)instead of the other sausage. I have to say I didn't have much hope for it, but it was surprisingly good. I'll make it again.

I made this as a main course with rice. It was fast, easy and delicious. I will definately make it again as a main course or tapa!
