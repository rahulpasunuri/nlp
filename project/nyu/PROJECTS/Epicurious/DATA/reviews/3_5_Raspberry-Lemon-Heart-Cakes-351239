delicious! i plan on making this again very soon! i used the lemon curd recipe from epicurious, and it was amazing! instead of putting 1 tsp vanilla extract, i put 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp lemon extract to make the cake a little more flavorful, and it came out fabulous! also, instead of putting powdered sugar on the top, you could put more lemon curd and some fresh raspberries - it adds fresh fruit (healthy!) and a nice new taste to the dish. all in all, this is a great recipe! :)

I made this for Valentine's Day, and used homemade lemon curd...YUM! Needless to say, it was quite a hit, and now a frequently requested dessert.

Ok, made it for Easter in egg pan (12) and remainder in 10 1/2 x 15 x 1 insulated pan and then cut into egg shapes with cookie cutters. The smaller pan actually needed longer to bake than original specified (?? because it was an insulated pan). Anyway it was a buttery ,sweet cake but not much more going for it than that.

Hello All, I have made this recipe twice now. The cake gets rave reviews and, is a very simple recipe to make. I made my own lemon curd and it was delicious. No need to buy expensive store curd. Make sure you mix the dry ingredients well or the salt taste will come through in your cake. Also, I lined both hearts with the raspberry for a little extra goodness. I opted to use 2% milk instead of whole milk and the cake was perfect. This cake keeps well in the refrigerator when covered. Homemade whipped topping with some sprinkled lemon zest topped off my second batch nicely.
