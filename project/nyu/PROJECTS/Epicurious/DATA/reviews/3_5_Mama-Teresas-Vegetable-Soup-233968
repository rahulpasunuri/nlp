Delicious and satisfying! I added a small bunch of chopped Swiss Chard along with the Zucchini, threw in a few cloves of chopped garlic, doubled the celery, and added a can of white kidney beans for protein. It was a little bit salty, but other wise just right!

Very nice and easy. Great way to use up late fall produce from the farmers' market. I skipped the cheese because I had a cold, added chard instead of zucchini, and did about half beef broth/half water. The egg made the sauce very creamy, but it would have melded into the soup better with the cheese. Next time, I won't skip the cheese. Other substitutions were fine. After I added the salt, I was afraid it might be too salty (because beef broth has salt; water does not). Fortunately, that was not a problem.

Simple and yummy. I altered the recipe only by adding a bit more salt.

I agree, very flavorful considering just made with water. Although I did add a clove of garlic and used really nice olive oil.

Very nice and smooth. I didn't have fresh basil on hand so had to substitute dried--I'm sure it would be much better with fresh but not bad the way it was. It would also be nice with shrimp or crab added at the end.

This is a lovely soup and surprising how floverful with the egg and parm. I used regular tomatoes, seeded, a thinly slice carrot, fresh chives and a bay leaf and a little extra of the other ingredients, big appetites, and served with Peppered Irish Soda Bread.
