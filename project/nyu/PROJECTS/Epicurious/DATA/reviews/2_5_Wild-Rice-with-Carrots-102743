Like other reviewers, I agree that the carrot should be added halfway through; otherwise it is too mushy. I used brown rice rather than wild rice. I felt the teaspoon of salt was too much; I'd recommend about half a teaspoon. I also liked the way the onions practically liquified--I'll definitely include them in future brown rice recipes.

I also used chicken broth instead of water -- plus, I took a a hint from risotto recipes and sauteed the wild rice with onions (not just one small one) in olive oil for a while, added some sage, rosemary and thyme (didn't have parsley) then added the carrots, plus some leftover celery, using a bit of broth when the mixture got dry. When the celery and carrots brightened in colour I added broth and brought it a boil, then I thru in about a 1/4 cup pearl barley -- and then more broth to a total of about 4 cups. Simmered for about 48 minutes, then added some granulated garlic while it was cooling. Results were both tasty and healhful.

USed a long-grain wild rice blend, vegetable broth and herbes de provence for a seasoning. The rice blend cooks faster leaving the carrots with some degree of firmness.

Delicious, although like the cooks below, I changed it a bit to make it less bland - adding olive oil and plenty of thyme, and substituting chicken or vegetable broth for water.

I specifically searched for a kid friendly recipe using wild rice and carrots (I'm always looking to work vegetables into things for the little ones), and this seemed perfect. The comments of the previous 2 cooks seemed astute, so I added herbs and put the carrots in after 30 minutes. My husband added hot sauce to his, but the kids loved it.

This recipe IS bland, but that's not the real problem. Putting the carrots in with the rice at the start of the cooking means you get mushy carrots! I liked that the onion seemed to liquify, but I would have liked the carrots to have a little more texture. If I were to make this again, I'd add the carrots halfway into the cooking.

I thought the recipe as posted sounded quite bland, so I fixed it. Added 3T butter, substituted chicken stock for half the water, threw in some fresh thyme and it tasted pretty good.
