Odd recipe name; my adult son prefers to call it an exploded deviled egg. We all thought the vinegar taste was too strong, even using half the suggested amount. We tried it again using sour cream instead of vinegar and liked that. The chopped egg whites need their own layer of salt and pepper. Really tasty tomatoes are essential.

I used tomatoes and cukes from my garden and skipped the ham and peppers as suggested. Also, subbed champagne vinegar with a splash of sherry since I didn't have the right kind and used one large clove garlic. A huge hit--- my husband requested it 2 nights in a row. The 2nd time I put it over a bed of mixed greens just to use them up and that was great as well. A keeper for sure!

Should add to below review that I skipped the ham. It was still fabulous!

This was fabulous, the dressing is to die for and the presentation is great. I actually served this at a small catering event, and it was a hit. You do have to be careful that the dressing doesn't seperate before serving, so that is (unfortunately) more of a last minute thing.

Love! I had a ton of garden tomatoes and needed a different recipe to use them in - this was perfect. Very flavorful, but not so strong that my 17 month old couldn't eat it too. I halved the garlic and actually used champagne vinegar instead. I added a little bacon on top instead of the ham. Delicious! To make it a little more hearty, we had a few servings on a tortilla with melted cheese.

Very Easy - and great flavor I also used the cucumber from my garden instead of meat - the dressing is fantastic - a must for garlic lovers

I thought this was very good, but way too much garlic. I only used 1 clove and it was still strong. Didn't have Sherry vinegar, so I used white balsamic. Maybe I need to find the vinegar. Still a great recipe for summer tomatoes.

I've made this salad many times and people practically lick their plates clean. The dressing is so unusual and so good. I agree with other reviewers to use cucumber and skip the meat.

This was amazing, and so easy. Like others, I subbed cucumber for the pepper and skipped the ham. I thought the special oil and vinegar were definitely worth the investment. Served it with chevre and arugula pesto on baguette slices. The dressing doesn't seem to store well though--we had the leftovers a couple of days later and the vinegar was VERY strong.

Refreshing and excellent. I increased the chopped egg whites (as previously recommended) and subbed cucumber for the bell pepper. A great summer salad for plentiful summer tomatoes.

This was a great summer dish! I added cucumber, which made it for me. I used Shiraz instead of vinegar, and it worked well. I would probably double the egg in the future. It was the main dish for my dinner, and only served 2 as such. Fantastic!!!

I made this recipe to take with me to a friend's house to accompany the paella she was making. It was a big hit -- the dressing is GREAT. I did find the hojiblanca olive oil and the sherry vinegar reserva. Not sure how important the exact olive oil was, but the vinegar was definitely worth the special trip to a gourmet grocery. I did omit the meat and add cucumber, since the meal was already meat-heavy and veggie-light. I'll definitely make it again, possibly with the meat as a main dish salad to accompany a creamy soup and crusty bread for a winter company dinner. It made ahead and travelled well, btw. I made the dressing ahead and refrigerated it, and it didn't separate at all in the five or six hours between making and serving. I chopped the veggies and the egg whites and stored them in separate containers and assembled them in minutes on the salad plates at my friend's house. I did seed the tomatoes and cucumbers before dicing them, since I was cutting them so far ahead, and that was a good move as neither became soupy.

This is a good salad, but also works great in sandwich form: use the sauce as a spread, and the rest as a filling. Like others, I added cucumber and omitted ham.

I made this salad to use the over abundance of fresh tomatoes coming from the garden. It was very unusual and delicious! I skipped adding any meat since this was a side for a grilled meat. I loved the sauce/dressing and it was very easy to put together as well. Will do again this summer, but will also add some cucumber next time.

Outstanding and really different. I resisted this first time around but next time I will add some cucumber just because you can't have gazpacho without cucumber. This is a real winner!

I made this salad for a dinner for 8 and there was not a drop left on any plate. My guests thought it was the most unusual and delicious first course. I used a large white plate for the presentation and it was very impressive. I'm already planning to make it again for my next dinner.
