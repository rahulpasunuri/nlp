gave this four forks for the sauce only; read the other reviews and decided not to make the gnocchi. the sauce, however, was fantastic. served with butternut squash ravioli. yum!

I agree with other reviewers regarding the gnocchi. Mushy and hard to make. I would not even give a fork for this.

This dish took a long time to make, and the gnocchi turned out like mush. Very disappointing.

The sauce turned out tasty but the gnocchi basically became mushy blobs of potatoes. It was a lot of work for something that didn't come out right.I have used the sauce again for ravioli.
