Great recipe with simple ingredients & so easy to prepare. Nothing fancy, but just plain good sauce.

Great kid-friendly sauce. The family loved it. I used a handful each of fresh basil and parsley instead of dry, and 3 cloves of garlic. Otherwise, wouldn't change a thing.

This is my fanily's favorite spaghetti sauce and I make it all the time (also freezes well). My family are meat lovers but even so, I half the amount of ground beef when I make the sauce. Otherwise, I make it to the letter.

Well, like everyone else I felt compelled to muck around with the recipe. Adds: additional garlic (lots), oregano, fresh marjoram, fresh basil (in addition to dried), hints of cayenne and garlic salt, and added some red wine. Deletes: 3.5c water reduced to 2c instead and reduced the cooking time needed. After having created a completely different recipe, I can say it turned out well!

I think this is a very good, basic sauce. The long simmer makes it. I also pump up the spices and garlic, and I use beef broth in place of most of the water.

My family absolutely loves this sauce. And it freezes well too so when I make it I make a double batch and freese some. Yum!

This was very easy to prepare while doing other things on a hectic weeknight, and quite good too. I substituted ground turkey for about 1/3 of the beef, and added some sugar. Next time I'll probably add more garlic and herbs.

Delicious. Did use some extra spices for a little more flavor.

I love this sauce- it really does taste just like a great family recipe that has been handed down through the generations. I use turkey Italian sausage instead of ground beef for added flavor. Also added much more garlic (4 cloves or so) to pump it up a bit. A nice, hearty bolognese.

Just what I expected ... something basic and yummy. Good for the whole family.

Like the others said, nothing too special, but good. The reason some say it's bland is because of all that water. If you're gonna add all that water you also need to reseason it. I also had to take out the big tomatoes after an hour and puree them in a blender.

A very standard pasta sauce but it tasted good. Nothing our of the ordinary though.

OK it's not gourmet, but this is a delicious, basic spaghetti sauce. The long simmering makes this sauce. I added mushrooms, about a tblsp. oregano, and a lot more garlic. Try it, you'll love it.

Easy and a keeper - even better the next day.

This is a great basic spaghetti sauce. I added red wine and fresh rosemary. To make it more special, next time I may take the advice of the other reviewers and possibly add mushrooms and/or italian sausage. But this really reminded me of my grandmother's sauce!

fabulous sauce. All time family favorite. I added finely chopped baby carrots, 4 more cloves of garlic and 1 1/2 cups white wine instead of water. Fantastic... Everyone loved it. Will make it again for sure.

This is an authentic Italian sauce. As Americans, we like it spicier. Add what you like, but use this as your basic. My mother-in law's mother was from Italy, and this is close to her recipe. To me it was very good, but needed more oomph. I added oregano, garlic powder of course, and oregano and bay leaf. How can it not be good if it's authentic? Just flavor it more to your taste. My mother-in law told me that Italians don't go for the extra seasonings, but if you want to, go ahead.Stay with this basic though if you want a really good sauce.

I would agree with Michael from Germany. This recipe was nothing special. I added more garlic and red wine after reading other reviews, and even added additional herbs, such as oregano and marjoram. My recommendation to someone who is considering making this, would be to add one can of tomato sauce rather then the two cans it calls for. Froze remainder for the children.

Having an Italian Grandmother who never wrote down the recipe, I have been searching for the perfect 'gravy'. I really enjoyed this recipe. I left out the meat, used fresh herbs(added at the beginning) along with a dash of red pepper flakes and 1/4 cup Merlot. Yum.

Fairly easy to make if you plan ahead. I used ground turkey instead of beef and was pleased. I will probably try it again with beef and compare the flavors.

I DON'T CARE MUCH FOR SPAGHETTI BUT THIS I LOVED, SO DID MY HUSBAND, I DID ADD GARLIC POWDER, AND A TBLS OF SUGAR, THEN TOPPED IT OFF WITH GRATED PARMESEAN. I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN.

I must have done somthing wrong, everyone else likes this but me. I used 92% lean ground beef, maybe if didn't shrink enough. My sauce was *very* bland.

For a basic, no brainer sauce this worked out well in the "What can I cook with nothing in the House"? catagory. And, like the review below said, there is very little thought or effort--if I had time I would make a more complex sauce. I even only had one pound of ground beef (two would have been better). I didn't have the tomato sauce, but just pureed the equivalent of whole tomatoes and added another can of paste. An Italian American friend said you always have to add water, like this recipe says, to get it the right consistency. Will make again.

I took the other reviewers' suggestions and added extra garlic (3 cloves), crushed red pepper, and 1/4 cup of Merlot, halfway through cooking. My family loved it and there were no leftovers.

Very easy and very good. I will be making this again

This sauce was wonderful!! No one cooks like a Grandmother! Thanks for submitting it. To Michael from Konstance, Germany....your comment was very rude and not necessary.

I thought this was very good for the amount of effort it required. I did follow the additional spice/garlic/wine suggestions that the cook from Kansas suggested, except I did not delete the parsley. I also threw in some fresh sliced mushrooms. My family thought it was excellent. I had gotten into the habit of using "store bought" sauce for the convience and forgotten how good homemade is. I will definitly use this recipe again.

Pretty basic sauce... I had to alter it quite a bit. I used Ital sausage instead of beef, skipped the parley and added 1teas fennel and 1teas oregano instead. I also increased the garlic to 5-6 cloves and added 1/3 cup merlot to the sauce halfway in the cooking process. Lastly, I added red pepper flakes to taste. I like it spicier.

I've been hunting for this recipe for months--I misplaced my clipping of it from Bon Appetit and am thrilled to find it. I've made this for lots of casual suppers with friends, and it never fails to win raves. My compliments to Grandmother!

Oh yeah, the contributor and her grandmother deserve kudos for sharing this recipe!! After trials-and-errors with numerous recipes, this one is the best and I'll be serving it frequently. We prefer a lighter sauce without oregano. One hint, instead of using a fork to break-up the canned tomatoes, just give them a quick pulse in the blender or food processor. Perhaps the reader from Germany hasn't heard of flavor-layering?

This is truly excellent. I prepare it on a regular basis for two people. I freeze the left over sauce that is left for later use and it doeosn't lose any quality. A real winner and easy.
