The first time, I made this strictly as the recipe stated. The second time I used 1/2 an onion (all I had), added a box of mushrooms (sauteed for the last two minutes w/onion and garlic), swapped in cannellini beans, used just one can of chicken broth (all I had), and added several splashes of Tobasco's smoked chipotle sauce, and two big handfuls of baby kale at the last minute. The recipe was good, but I'm pretty impressed with my results the second time through (next time I may substitute navy beans instead).

This recipe is definitely a winner. I added a couple of stalks of celery, a carrot, and some kale although I think I will use swiss chard next time. (The kale didn't shrink as much as I hoped so I ended up with a bowl of mostly kale and a little soup.) I also added a little extra stock since the soup was very thick. Otherwise a winner.

I was a bit apprehensive about making this recipe. However, I was pleasantly surprised in the end! The simmering really does it! It was quick, easy and cheap! I chose this recipe for black-eyed peas because it skipped the bacon.

Delicious and so easy. I used a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes in place of the sauce and 3-4 small leaves of Kale sliced 1/4 to 1/2 inch.

Quick, easy and inexpensive dinner. Doubled recipe. Substitued 1 cup of spaghetti sauce for 2 cups tomato sauce. Used slighly less onion as other reviewers suggested. Added 4 slices of bacon and 2 stalks of celery, both finely chopped. Did not serve with cheese or vinegar. Kids, teens and adults all had seconds - great addition to our winter weekday family dinner repertoire.

Made this soup with soaked beans & veg stock, I also added kale and a bit of salt pork for the base. It turned out great, a definite staple, can't wait to try it tomorrow after it settles a bit.

This recipe is super easy and pretty tasty. It's not anything out of the ordinary but tastes better the next day. I love onions but I agree with another member that the amount of onions is a little much. If I make it again I would cut the onions down to 2 cups.

Very easy to make and tasty.

Very tasty! I added the cayenne individually to mine and my husband's as I was also serving it to my two little kids (who gobbled it right up)! Comforting soup on a very rainy November day.

I liked this for the simplicity of preparation and the use of ingredients likely to be on hand. This soup is ready in a snap! I made half of the recipe and added one strip of cooked bacon and one stalk of chopped celery. I used a cup of leftover marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce. Perhaps adding cumin instead of oregano and tomatoes with chilies for part of the tomato sauce would add zest and improve the taste.

Really good, no leftovers at our house. Greater than the sum of its parts, will definitely make again. Added a little celery, a little bacon and used a little less onion and tomato sauce. Quick and easy.

I Came home from shoeing (horses) yesterday afternoon. It was a wet day in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and getting colder with a winter storm close on my heels; time for a comfort dinner. I threw a chunk of wood into my wood cook stove; found a can of black-eyed peas in the cupboard and went on this site looking for insperation for a black-eyed pea dish to go with a skillit braised chicken. I threw an onion, some garlic, and a stalk of celery into the cuisinart and dropped the results into a cast iron pot; sweated the mixture while I took a shower (a luke-warm wood stove takes a bit of time to come up to heat) and put the rest of the ingrediants in the pot while the chicken was cooking. The result was excellent: The flavors were loud and clear. I even had the black-eyed peas for breakfast, at room temperature. I'll finish off the black-eyed pea soup tonight with manzanita smoked pork ribs -- Don't mess with this recipe. It's good as is; hot or cold.

Start up the burner, heat the oil, add the onions and while they saute, come back to continue reading this review: it's that simple! This is one delicious soup. While I like onions and find them to be an essential ingredient in this soup, from now on I will cut the amount of onions to just 2 cups. Too many onions in the original recipe. This is a flavorful, healthful soup you can make in a snap. Go for it.

Made this for the first time tonight exactly as the recipe says except added a little more chicken broth. It is delicious. The fast and easy recipe is an added plus. Will definitely make this again and again.

This soup is a great easy meal. Like another reviewer, I add bacon. I use a bit less tomato sauce than specified and I use whatever leftover tomato stuff I have on hand, like pasta sauce, salsa, etc-- anything works. The vinegar/ oregano/ cayenne combo is delicious.

I was very skeptical as this was the first time I tried making something with black eyed peas. It turned out to be an excellent choice. The soup was hearty and very tasty, with a definite edge to it thanks to the cayenne pepper. Adding cheese before serving is a wonderful idea; the cheese gives added flavor. I also added a few homemade croutons and it gave the soup just a little more basil and garlic taste. Great soup
