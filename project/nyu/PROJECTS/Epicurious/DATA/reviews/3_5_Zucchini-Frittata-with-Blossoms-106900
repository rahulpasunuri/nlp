We loved this. Like other reviewers found it really easy and delicious. I think we used a bit of feta which is all we had, dried oregano instead of fresh and also skipped the blossoms. Still a wonderful result.

Wow. I did not expect this to be so delicious! I added diced red bell peppers, substituted mozzerella for ricotta salata (that's all I had at home), and also substituted a bit of pesto for the oregano- amazing! And it is so quick an easy- definitely a winnner.

This recipie is heavenly. I have made it twice now for brunches with friends and it is always devoured by everyone. Plus, it is so easy- what could be better?!!!

totally bland. I added 3 times the garlic, (taking a cue from the 1993 recipe) salt, and pepper and still found it tasteless. I guess it could have been the quality of my ingredients (home grown zucchini, packaged, pre-grated parmisan) but I'm not sure. It needed a lot more flavor for me.

I made this with yellow patty pan squash which worked extremely well. I had never made a frittata before and was worried that it wouldn't work. It came out very nicely!

I brought it in for a work pot luck and it was the first thing gone

you can leave the inside of the blossoms in but they taste better when they are removed, less bitter. This is a good recipe!

I'm pretty sure that you have to remove the inside of the blossoms before using! I think it's called the pistles?
