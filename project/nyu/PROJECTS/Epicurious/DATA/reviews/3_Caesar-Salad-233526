It was the best salad I ever had! but the croutons weren't too good so we put them on the side then it was the best

a fan of lea & perrins as an extra ingredient. Take it easy on the mustard. Garnish it with a poached egg and a few whole anchovies for fun. It's pretty decadent.

How could you go against the original. There is a reason why this recipe has lasted through the ages. I think one trick to the flavor is to use a real good extra virgin olive oil since it iwll add a lot more depth than run of the mill olive oil or generic extra virgin.

As other reviewers mentioned, this recipe requires extra ingredients (ie. worcestershire sauce, mustard) in order to bring it from mundane to tasty. Choose another recipe.

Adding a few drops of Lea & Perrins, a 1/4 tsp of dry mustard and seasoning salt adds more flavour and depth to this dressing.

Found this recipe in the magazine and it was selected as their "best" Caesar salad but I found it very bland so I added more anchovy and more lemon to boost the flavour. I'm no great cook but I felt it was missing something. Will try a different recipe next time.

This is a great recipie!!! However, for those who love garlic, an additional clove "kicks it up". Also, a good quality anchovie paste works equally well if canned anchovies are not available and by just using the yolk of the egg, the dressing is richer.
