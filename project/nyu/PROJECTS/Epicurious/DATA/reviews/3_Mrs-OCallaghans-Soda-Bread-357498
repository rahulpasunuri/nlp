This is the Soda Bread my Grandma McKinney use to make. This is real Irish Soda Bread.

YUMMY! Made this for a pot luck dinner on St Patrick's Day. I did do what one person suggested and looked up the recipe on Bon Appettit and added extra baking soda and some salt. It also seemed to need a bit more fluids to make it in a nice dough. I used a bit extra water, maybe 2-3 tablespoons. I baked it for 20 min at 425 F then turned it down to 375 F for 40 minutes. It is was delicious! This was my first attempt at Irish Soda bread, so not too sure if being a bit crumbly was normal for soda bread. For those who like crunchy bits, it was perfect, and the inside was soft and delicious. Now I need to make more for the kids tomorrow!

Really great bread, exactly what I was going for.

I'm surprised at the low stars on this bread. I made it yesterday for St. Patrick's Day and it turned out great! The next time I make it, I'll add a bit of salt. But, it baked up nicely. I love the dense, hearty texture to it.

Ok, I joined epicurious just to write this review. I made this bread last year when the article came out in bon appetite. It does need a little tweaking but it is a deliciously authentic recipe, with few ingredients but great depth in flavor. Everyone raved about it last year. If you go the the bon appetite website they do note in test kitchen notes that some adjustments should be made. http://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/2010/03/mrs_ocallaghans_soda_bread I added 2 teaspoons of baking soda (as recommended) and a dash of salt. Furthermore I baked it initially at 425 for ~ 30 to 40 minutes. Until bread is golden and then dropped the temp to 400 for the remaining ~20 until the bread is cooked through (has that nice hollow sound when tap it from the bottom) If your bread is getting to dark wrap in foil. Happy Baking Folks! And Happy St. Patty's to ALL!

I love this bread! I did have to add a little more buttermilk, but no big deal, especially considering how wonderful it tastes and how easy it is to make! I really like the crunchy top and the moist interior, and that it's not too heavy or too sweet. One thing to note, I have only ever made it with graham flour, which might be responsible for the deliciously wheaty, slightly nutty flavor. Definitely one of the best recipes I've come across so far.

My wife and I worked the recipe exactly as in the magazine and found that the middle of the loaf [and a huge one at that] was not completely cooked. So on the second attempt, we separated into two smaller loaves and at the end of the time, turned off the oven and let them sit. It was served to my Irish pastor the day before St Patrick's Day slathered with Kerrygold butter and received his seal of approval. [That's Irish, catholic pastor; who else?] Try this one, it will not fail you. Someone please thank Mrs. O'Callaghan! :-}

This bread was too heavy and lacked flavor.

Well, that didn't work. I added a little liquid when the dough didn't come together, and added some salt to balance the sweet. My result was dense and doughy and not cooked through. The crust with the dough picked out tasted okay. But, basically, a waste of ingredients.

I forgot to add that I used salted butter as well, like a previous reviewer, so that may have helped with the lack of salt in the recipe.

I didn't read the reviews before making this bread, but another 1/4 C or so of buttermilk probably wouldn't have hurt. Mine came together after some kneading anyway. 425 did seem a little high. My bread was very dark brown and crispy on top before it fully cooked through. I had to leave it in (with tin foil over the top) for another 15 minutes or so. The end result was HEAVENLY. A little crispy on the outside, but the inside was so filling and just slightly sweet. Brought this to a St. Patrick's Day party and everyone loved it. I will definitely make this again- with just a few alterations.

Thank you all for your great comments! I was going to make a loaf this weekend, but instead I'll stick with my own grandmother's recipe.

This bread turned out fantastic for me. I did not have to add any more buttermilk, but I did decide beforehand to use salted butter, since it did not specify and there was no salt in the recipe. It turned out absolutely delicious. I did have to bake it for about 10 minutes longer, which was not a problem. Wonderful bread.

Did anyone try this recipe before printing? Oh wait, I can answer: no! After I plopped it in the oven (after adding more buttermilk and really working it) I thought it just sounded wrong and went after 2 past recipes that were perfect. Basically there is half the butter, buttermilk and soda needed for that amount of flour. Also, the temp is too high and there is no salt in the recipe. So I salvaged it by realizing the temp was off and decreasing to 375 for more time but it was like lead and tasteless. Awful. Shame on you Bon Appetit. I miss Gourmet more than you can imagine- they didn't publish dud recipes!

I wanted to make this the minute I saw the recipe in BA 3-10. I'm glad I checked the reviews here because I'm pretty sure adding 1/2 c. more liquid and some salt saved the day. I also added 1/2 c. golden raisins and @ 2 tsp caraway seeds. I divided the dough in half and made two 8" round loaves. I only gave 2 forks because so much tinkering was required. We actually ended up loving this bread and enjoyed it with our classic corned beef and cabbage early St. Pat's dinner this afternoon.

I also needed to add about a 1/4 cup more buttermilk. After 45 minutes the crust was done and the inside was only halfway done. I turned down the temperature to 400 and had to bake it another 1/2 hour. I think I worked with the dough too much (as it seemed tough) and the taste was only ok. I was disapointed and won't be making this recipe again.

Did anyone at B.A. test this recipe? The first tipoff was that "Mrs. O'Callaghan" was pictured making the bread in a baking pan,not on the cookie sheet prescribed in the recipe. The second clue was that it called for a "medium" bowl, not a major deal, but clearly this was a "large" bowl recipe. The next problem was the size of the round loaf, defiinitley larger than 7". Then there was the baking problem; after 40 minutes it was on the verge of burning on the outside, but the inside was still cold and uncooked. The end result was a good flavor on the outside, but basically a ruined recipe; a waste of time and ingredients. That is why I loved Gourmet, the recipes were always flawless. I will try again making two loaves instead of one and using white whole wheat flour.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. Like just about everyone else, I had to add more buttermilk to the recipe in order for the dough to come together--I'd say about 1/4 cup or so. At 40 minutes the inside was still doughy despite the fact that the outside looked good at that point. I ended up baking it for about 1 hour. In the end the bread was still slightly doughy but acceptable. It's tasty, but I lived in Ireland and this doesn't taste like the yummy brown bread I used to eat there. To me, it just tastes like an average loaf of bread made with whole wheat flour. So, I'd recommend the recipe with tweaks, but this isn't what I think of when I think of true Irish soda bread.

I was disappointed in recipe which definitely needs tweaking - dough was very dry and needed more buttermilk. Bottom of loaf burned at 40 minutes and large part of middle was still doughy. Cut off the entire bottom layer as it was too hardened and burned to eat and also cut out the doughy parts. Did enjoy eating the rest of the loaf. Not sure I will make again, but the final product portion that I could eat was not unlike the homemade brown soda bread I have eaten when staying in Irish B & Bs.

Unlike a lot of the other reviews, I didn't have any problems with the dough being too dry etc. I thought it was really easy to make and came together well. I didn't turn it out onto a surface, just kind of kneaded it in the bowl. I baked it for 40 minutes, and it looked done, so I didn't actually check to see if it was 'hollow'..so it was a little doughy in the center but I think that was my fault not the recipe's. I do agree that it needed some salt, but that can be made up for by spreading it with copious amounts of salted butter!

Something wasn't right with this recipe. The dough was WAAAAYYYYY too dry to work with, and there didn't seem to be enough rising agent for all that flour. I'm a frequent visitor to Ireland and have been to several of the locations mentioned in the article, so I was excited to try the recipe. I've also made several decent versions of soda bread, so it's not as though I don't know what I'm doing. I ended up with a cannon ball. I literally would have made a pothole in my kitchen floor had I dropped this "loaf." The thing must have weighed 15 pounds and was as dense as concrete. I don't even think the birds I threw it out to could peck their way through this thing. Too bad, I was really looking forward to a new go-to brown bread recipe.

Like many of you this did not work the first time because the dough is just too dry. I realized that what I was making was a "biscuit dough" and tried it again, not measuring the buttermilfk but adding until I got the shaggy dough described in the recipe. I halved the recipe and cooked it in a stoneware loaf pan and it came out delicious, rising nicely. For this kind of dough, the less you handle it the better.

The given measurments for this recipe are incorrect. I made the recipe as stated in the magazine and needed to add about 1/3 to 1/2 cup extra buttermilk to get the dough to stick into any shape to be able to bake it. Baking time (after adding the extra buttermilk) was ok at 40 min. The bread does have a slightly nutty flavor but could use a littl emore salt as well. Would make again with modifications (or would just search for better recipe).

Good stuff, my husband loved this with nutella. Did need a little extra buttermilk. No trouble with burning, not baking, etc.

This recipe did not work AT ALL! The dough was really dry, and the bread did not bake. After 55 minutes, the bottom was burned and the middle was 100% dough. I hope a correction is posted, because I was really excited to try it out!

This was just awful. I had to bake it 20 min longer than the recipe said. It is not like brown bread from Ireland. It lacks flavor and needs some salt. I would not make this again ever. Terrible!!!! The article was deceving and made the bread sound so great but they were wrong. Don't bother trying this, find another recipe that is better.

As other reviewers noted, the dough was initially quite dry, I had to add a few tablespoons of milk to make everything stick together. However, it came out of the oven smelling delicious and had a dense, nutty flavor. I'll make this again!

I think we should be expecting this from an Irish bread, wash it down with a Pint of Guiness

As noted by the other reviewers the dough was extremely dry. I added a bit more buttermilk & kneaded the bread slightly to make it all come together. The flavor was very good - I might experiment with using about 1/2 cup less of each of the flours if I decide to make it again.

Rating: 1
Likewise, I could not incorporate all the flour into this dry dough and agree that it does seem to have more flour than similar recipes for Irish soda bread. A very disappointing waste of time, energy and ingredients.

I was enchanted by the article accompanying this recipe and decided to make the bread. Like others have noted, the dough is very dry. I did not add more buttermilk as I had bought exactly the amount the recipe called for, and I had to work very hard to get the dough to stick together. I made a round shape as the recipe specified, though interestingly the slice pictured was clearly baked in some sort of loaf pan rather than on a baking sheet (I wish the magazine would not do that - I like to see how I should expect the recipe to turn out). The final product was quite tasty, though heavier than the typical yeast breads I make. My family especially liked the bread toasted with butter and either cinnamon or jam. I would love to visit Ireland and compare this to the real thing!

I think there is something wrong with this recipe- the dough is incredibly, incredibly dry and very hard to work with. I even tried adding a little more buttermilk, but it didn't matter. The bread came out heavy and bland. I would not make this again. Looking at other recipes, it looks like this one has a LOT more flour than others for the same amount of baking soda and liquid.

Rating: 2
This recipe needs to be tweaked a bit. I did exactly what the recipe states and I ended up adding a bit more buttermilk as the dough didn't come together. Also had to cook it longer-approx 20 minutes. However, after it was cooked and we added butter, it had great taste.
