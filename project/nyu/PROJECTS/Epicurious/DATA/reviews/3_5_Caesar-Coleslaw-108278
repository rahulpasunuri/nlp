it's a good twist, but needs a little more jazzing up. I would add some fresh pepper and possibly some type of sweet vinegar, such as rice wine (mirin) or regular vinegar plus sugar. And next time I'm going to add more garlic. If you like anchovies, go ahead and some more- the taste of the 9 fillets mentioned in this recipe is very mild.

excellent,easy and different. I used a combo of purple and regular green cabbage, fewer scallions and combo lime and lemon juice because I ran out of lemons. Everyone loved it.

Love this slaw. Accidentally used Napa cabbage instead of Savoy and absolutely made the dish. Have made several times with the Napa cabbage and receives rave reviews every time.

this was good, but I don't think it deserves the raves it gets here. Reduced the green onion bc not that big a fan but otherwise made according to recipe. Had to use regular cabbage as savoy not available here. Added in some purple cabbage as well for color.

I was looking for something different than the usual, often boring, recipe for coleslaw and came across this one. I was dubious, but after reviewing the comments decided to try it. I'm glad I did -- it's creamy, tangy and quite delicious. I second all the positive comments. I thought the amounts of garlic and onion OK.

Very nice way to add some fresh flavor to a classic. Still, would tone down the garlic to two cloves and maybe add some fresh herbs, like parsley or basil,to round out the flavors.

I have made this recipe many times and it is always a HUGE hit. I only use half the onions (they can be overpowering) WE LOVE THIS COLESLAW.

My mother sent me this recipe back in June 2006, and since then I have made it many times. As a Caesar salad fanatic with an old family recipe (and another family recipe for a non-sweet vinegar-type coleslaw), I was a bit skeptical about this blend of the two. But it has been a huge hit at our picnics. I agree that it needed a bit more tang, so added a bit more lemon juice. Great leftover on turkey, roast or corned beef, or pastrami sandwiches. The Garlic does get stronger as it sits, but we're garlic-heads! If you eat it at work, be sure and bring some very strong mints or minty chewing gum!! EXCELLENT coleslaw!

We absolutely loved this coleslaw! It is a perfect side for a plain main dish, such as grilled chicken or steak.

This was so easy to make and so good! It really gave a different twist to a regular coleslaw. Served it with homemade burgers and my family loved it. It would be fantastic for a summer BBQ.

What a great change from ordinary slaw. I was skeptical about this recipe, but I'm so glad I tried it. I didn't have scallions, so I used red onion instead. Served with halibut fish sandwiches and lemon-avocado red potato salad for a wonderful Friday night meal.

My husband said "yuck" when told what I was making. He couldn't eat enough after he tasted. I trippled the recipee for a large BBQ. It was a little soupy but tasted delicious! Used Celery cabbage and mixed with purple for color. Will definately make again!

Absolutely Awesome! Will really create a stir at the table. Unexpected excellence from a cole slaw!

An excellent recipe for those of us who don't like sweet-tasting coleslaw and salad dressings. I especially liked the way the cheese coated the strands of cabbage

It was quick, easy, and not too many ingredients. I've made it a couple of times. A good caesar flavor.

If you like Caesar Salad this is a must! Easy and wonderful. A nice change from the norm. Family and guests rave about this one.

I was a bit hesitant about making a caesar coleslaw but am always looking for something different to try. Made it for a barbecue and everyone raved about it. My daughter has never cared very much for coleslaw and she tried it and totally loved it. My sister loved it so much she is making it for her boyfriend's birthday picnic on the beach. Will definitely be "the" coleslaw recipe from now on.

This is a great alternative to regular coleslaw. It was easy to make - I doubled the recipe for a BBQ for 20 people and it was a hit. I might have gone with a few less green onions...

This was fantastic. My mother raved about this recipe so I made it yesterday for the football games. What a hit!! I am looking forward to leftovers tonight after work. Will make it again and again...

This is definitely a keeper. Everyone loved this!

made this for food-picky relatives (including 3 teens) who wouldn't begin to try anything with cabbage in it....figured the caesar would possibly do the trick......and it did! Plus gave me a new recipe I will repeat again with grilled meats or fish for a healthier side dish/alternative to mixed greens

I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GREAT, AND SERVED WITH RIBS, WAS THE BEST! THANKS

My group couldn't get enough of this! The dressing is perfect, I added extra "shredded" not grated parmasean on top and stirred it just as serving, cabbage needs to be cut very fine, it is delicious!

This is a terrific dish to accompany barbequed meats. I took it to a BBQ last evening and it was the first salad to go with lots of requests for recipes. I substitute anchovy paste for the anchovies. I also added more than the recommended fresh parmesan to give it more of a zing. Finally, I combined both Savoy cabbage and red cabbage to add colour and crunch. It was a real crowd pleaser!

Great recipe! Used only 6 anchovies, but did use fresh grated parm, everyone raved about this! I was able to find savoy cabbage (I sliced it pretty fine) and I suspect that may make the diffence between success and failure with this recipe. Also, in making traditional coleslaw, I salt the sliced cabbage, let it drain, then rinse when it's reached the right tenderness level. A stiff crunchy cabbage will not hold the dressing.

Yuk. The flavor was flat and the whole dish just didn't work well. I think that this was another example of the over-extension of the "Caesar" concept.

Delicious. Made this for a BBQ--lots of praise--e.g. I don't normally like coleslaw but this is great! Nice and lemony and don't be afraid of the anchovies. I forgot the cheese but still thought it was really good.

This sounded good, but was a little disappointing. I had to use regular green cabbage, savoy was not available in the area. The lemon was a little strong and the dressing didn't taste a lot like caesar.

We liked this recipe for coleslaw that was a bit different than the norm -- that said, I think my family prefers the norm. I used anchovy paste as a substitute for the filets called for. A warning, the garlic really gets strong if you have leftovers.

Probably would make again. Made this for the 4th of July to go with bbq chicken. Its nice because you can make it a day ahead. I think it needed a little extra lemon and anchovy, but once those were added it had a nice tang.
