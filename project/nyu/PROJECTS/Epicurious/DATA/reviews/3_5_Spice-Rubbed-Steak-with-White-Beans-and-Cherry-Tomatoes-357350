This was a really good recipe. Well except for the part where I almost asphyxiated us with the airborne toxic red pepper flake. Don't make this if you don't have a good exhaust. And REALLY don't make it if you don't have any exhaust. Well, maybe make it cause it was good. And fast. Yet deadly.

This is fabulous just as is. I've also enjoyed substituting chipotle chili powder and fire-roasted tomatoes for a delicious added smokiness.

Like others I did not wipe the skillet clean. Turned out well but for whatever reason my steak was pretty tough. On a whim I took the left overs, combined them into the skillet, added carrots, celery, onion, beef stock and a bit more salt and VIOLA! A delicious stew for tomorrow!

Use a filet or something with barely any fat. I don't know what kind of cut I got but it was awful. This recipe is pretty simple. The seasonings are good. I liked the beans but the tomatoes didn't do a thing for me. The cumin adds a nice, rich flavor.

I'm giving this 4 forks as it's very, very good and extremely fast and easy. Like other reviewers, I didn't wipe out the pan before adding beans and cut the tomatoes in half. I also added a bit of balsamic vinegar with the tomatoes. Love this recipe and will be making it again.

Quite good but be prepared to smoke out your house with spicy chili powder smoke! don't wipe the pan out, and cut the little tomatoes in half. careful of using a steak too thick also.

This is an excellent recipe for a quick and delicious dinner. It tasted much better than I had expected. Like others, I didn't clean the pan before cooking the beans and tomatoes. I used Italian seasoning instead of dried oregano, which works just as well. Also, I added a little extra garlic and cumin to the beans, and threw in some fresh lemon thyme from my garden.

This was a GREAT quick and easy Sunday night dinner. My boyfriend loves spice and took 2 bites and told me how good it was. I followed the advice of other reviews and did not wipe out the pan before cooking the tomatoes and beans. This whole recipe was delicious. I will definitely make it again.

Delicious and easy! I cooked the meat on the grill and separately made the beans and tomatoes. I had some leftover quinoa and threw that it as well - YUM! I'll definitely make this again.

I was worried that I would need to serve with bread...but this is so flavorful, filling and satisfying that it was fine as is. Great healthy dish.

Great for a simple All-American meal. I don't know why you would wipe all of that delicious seasoning out of the pan before you added the tomatoes! Added significantly more seasoning with the tomatoes. Added garlic powder to both the steak and tomatoes. Used flank steak. Fast and easy.

This is my boyfriend's new favorite meal--and he's a SERIOUS foodie! It's quick, easy, and relatively healthy--perfect for a weeknight. I took other reviewers' advice and made the following changes: used only 1t chili powder, 1/2 t red pepper flakes, and added 1t garlic powder to the spice rub. (Yes, open a window before you cook the steak!) I didn't wipe out the pan after cooking the steak, and that gave the beans a little extra kick. I also used grape tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes. Delicious!

I've made this several times and like the simplicity but you might want to add more to the beans..some rosemary maybe. I used a moroccan rub on the steak instead and it came out great.Clean and healthy...

See, this is the sort of recipe I would never come up with. Too simple. I can hear the foodies now saying "But ANYONE could throw this together. All it takes are a bunch of spices everybody already has in their cabinet..." True enough. And all that oregano, crushed pepper, chili powder and cumin are going stale in your kitchen even as you read this. Besides, sirloin is lean, and you've got nothing but healthy ingredients. Will smoke up your kitchen; plan accordingly.

A delicious, savory recipe. I took a cue from some of the other reviewers and cut the red pepper flakes down to about 1/2 teaspoon. The result was pleasantly spicy--a nice amount of heat without being overwhelming. I have to echo one of the other reviewers that my apartment was incredibly smoky afterward, but overall the results were worth it. I kicked up the amount of garlic in the beans recipe and they were delicious and satisfying. A great low-key Monday night meal overall.

We love this - have made it several times with beef and the flavors and textures are so satisfying. Last night, I rubbed chicken breasts with the spice mix and grilled them separately. Next I heated olive oil, garlic, cumin and chili powder in a skillet, then added the tomatoes and beans a cooked for several minutes on med-high. I served the chicken sliced over the beans and tomatoes. We've been trying to eat a little less red meat and this dish has so much flavor, we didn't miss the beef at all.

I loved this meal! It was spicy and simple. I used fresh oregano from my garden. I also used crushed tomatoes as I didn't have cherry tomatoes on hand. That made more of a sauce which I thought would be *amazing* paired with whole wheat pasta - it is! Using one pan made clean up a breeze!!!

I followed the suggestions to cut the chili powder because my family doesn't like spicy food, and so used 1 tsp cayenne pepper powder and 1 tsp garlic instead. It came out great!

I actually made this with pork chops and cut back the chili powder to 1 t as other had suggested and added a bit more garlic. I used grape tomatoes and sliced them lengthwise and we loved it. Can't wait to try it with beef.

1 tsp crushed red pepper isn't that much, those of you complaining about spicyness...you sure you didn't use 'ground' red pepper? That would be a totally different experience.

Really good, quick weeknight meal. We used flatiron steak because we're not big fans of sirloin.

My husband eats very spicy food and hardly blinks. He thought this was delicious, but very spicy! I would cut back on the amount I put on the steak next time. I cooked the beans first because I served them to a vegetarian as well. The beans were yummy and helped mellow out the flavor a bit. I used a cast-iron skillet which worked beautifully. The only bad thing is that the air in my house is so heavily spiced that we all keep coughing!!!

This was pretty tasty and very easy. We used flank steak in place of sirloin. The only thing I would change next time is to cut back on the red pepper flake! Whew! Spiiiicy!

Very quick and easy. SPICY! My hungry boyfriend scarfed it down! My suggestions: less red pepper. More garlic/salt pepper to beans... Also, I used an electric, flat-top surface stove to cook this, the med/high heat was too high for the sauté of the tomatoes, and they were popping and splashing the hot oil. Remove from heat while tomatoes being to sauté and the electric top cools.

Very spicy mix...worked ok on the steak (Grilled Porterhouse), but found the beans to be rather plain. I did add the spice mix to the beans and that spiced it up a bit. Had leftover chicken from a prior meal and mixed that with the beans (with extra spice mix added)...that was delicious.

I made this using leftover sliced london broil. Did the tomatoes in the skillet with olive oil until they were soft and giving off liquid, added garlic and spices and simmered. Cut up an orange pepper that wasn't getting any younger, simmered a little more. Then added the drained beans to heat. Topped with the steak, turned off the heat just to warm it, then served it all on a bed of salad greens. Yummy! A good way to stretch a small amount of meat by adding the beans for protein.

Despite an apartment full of smoke, this turned out much better than I expected given the ingredients list. I think it helped that I got a high-quality steak from the organic butcher. The crust on the steak had a nice zingy flavor, and the tomatoes and white beans gave a nice contrast in texture and taste (even if they lacked subtlety). Served with an arugula salad

Very quick and easy! The pan became so burnt we only did the steak - sliced it up for tacos (with the usual sides - avocado, onions, tomatoes, cheese).

Very tasty! I decreased the chili powder and cayenne to suit my family's tastes. I also added 1 cup of frozen corn and 12 oz of mushrooms to make it more of a complete meal.

This was a great, EASY, FAST, and relatively healthy week night dinner. I made a few substitutions - 1 tsp garlic powder for one of the tsp of chili powder, canola oil instead of olive oil, and grape tomatoes. I think all helped. Will definitely make again - too easy and fast not to.

We thought this was great! I used T-bones and added a couple cloves of minced garlic to the steak seasoning, but otherwise followed the recipe. We liked the heat of the chili powder, maybe the garlic helped balance it. Served this with a simple arugula salad. Great.

it was okay. pretty tasty; i placed all of it on a bed of greens to give it a little more substance. I agree with A Cook a bout the chili powder. Probably could have used a little less chili and a little more of something else. I did add the cumin to the beans, it was pretty tasty.

Rating: 2
The flavors of the steak were disappointing. The spice combination was dull, definitely needed garlic and less chili powder -- I'll make my own mix next time but follow cooking method. I left the cumin out of the beans and did not wipe the skillet clean. They were flavorful and good.
