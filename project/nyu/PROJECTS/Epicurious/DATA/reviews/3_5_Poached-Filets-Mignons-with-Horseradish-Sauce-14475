Good stuff - Seems odd to poach red meat (especially a nice cut), but it was well received by all, and i would definitely make it again. A really good fit for a weeknight. We actually served it with fries and some microwaved peas. Simple pimple.

I'm confused- one is supposed to use an entire cup of demiglace?

I make this recipe fairly often. It feels so decadent to eat filet mignon at home, and this recipe is so easy. I was afraid the horseradish taste might be overpowering, but it was perfect.
