This was delicious. I used arugula (personal preference) and added chick peas. Will definitely make again.

Delicious! I changed it up a little bit by using romaine lettuce instead of spinach and fresh basil instead of mint (that's what i had on hand). I also put it on a while wheat wrap instead of a pita. Yum!

I made this for lunch today and absolutely loved it. So fresh and easy and yummy! Perfect on a hot day. The filling alone makes a nice salad, but turning it into a sandwich makes it more filling. Can't wait to make this again!

Not good. I was very disappointed with this. The cucumber salad was soggy and the vinaigrette didn't taste good. The yogurt dressing was alright.

Good and slightly spicy but I found the spinach a little dry. It's very little oil and vinegar for 6 ounces of spinach.

Excellent! My husband and I followed the directions exactly and had a quick, easy, fabulous lunch. I can't wait to make this dish for friends and family.

I have made this sandwich again and again. It is filling and very diet-friendly. It tastes so wonderful, you don't for a minute think that you are eating low calorie. I have also made it with fat-free feta and it is great that way too. With fat-free feta and one whole wheat pita it is only 4 weight watchers points. Made as above, it is about 5 and a half points. Give it a try, you won't be dissapointed.

Yum- really fast and good to have around. I don't love sundried tomatoes or cucumber but this was an awesome salad, nice and light. You can even spice it up by adding shrimp in the summer

This was absolutely great and satisfied my desire for Greek food, namely feta cheese. I added more feta than was called for and my husband suggested that we add some grilled chicken the next time around. Any type of meat or even salmon would be fine with this. Easy to make as well. I only used half of the yogurt mixture in two pitas cut in half.

easy to make & great tasting. Instead of the cayenne pepper, I used a lemon-pepper mix (i think Lawry's). I also lined the pitas with the baby spinach instead of mixing it in with everything else. I'll be making this again on many hot summer days!

Loved it. Warmed pita bread in microwave between paper towels instead of turning on oven. It was great. Have shared it with many friends.

Yuck. I thought it would be a nice little Greek salad in a pita, fine, but it turned out to be just odd-tasting. My husband has a more adventurous palate than I and is usually too polite to refuse to eat something, but he took two bites and left the rest on the plate. We ended up ordering a pizza.

delicious, have made these several times with great feedback from those who shared them with me. Not neccesary to change the recipe in any way.
