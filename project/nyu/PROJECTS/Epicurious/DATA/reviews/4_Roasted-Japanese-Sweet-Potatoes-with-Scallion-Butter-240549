I'm in agreement with everyone - this scallion/miso butter is to-die-for!

Really good. I'd also like to experiment with more miso as others have suggested.

Beyond reproach! The miso-scallion butter is just perfectly delicious and pairs so well with the sweet potato. Couldn't get Japanese sweet potatoes so used regular ones and didn't find anything lacking. FYI - there was a delicious spread at the dining table and this combo stole the show!

Sublime. I used this on regular, large, orange-fleshed sweet potatoes and I can't say enough about how well the flavors paired. I had red miso on hand, so used that. Highly recommend this recipe.

Japanese sweet potatoes are one of my favorites and the miso scallion butter is a great addition! Made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!

So easy and so good. The miso is very subtle, but it definitely makes a difference. I might increase the miso next time as an experiment, but it was fantastic as is. The miso really balances out the sometimes too sweet nature of sweet potatoes.

I made these for Thanksgiving last year as a departure from the traditional sides. They were great! I wanted to put that miso-scallion butter on everything in the house. Will definitely make again!

Very simple and delicious recipe! I can't wait to make this for my family. Who would have thought there was a better use for sweet potatoes! My daughter and I love roasted sweet potatoes!

This is an excellent side to the Sesame Chicken Skewers and Asian Slaw. Both recipes are fabulous.

I couldn't stop eating this. I used just 2 extra-large japanese sweet potatoes, and while it took forever for them to bake, the result was still delicious. I eyeballed the amount of miso and scallions and it still worked. The scallions really add a subtle tang.

What an unexpected way to use miso! I also used regular sweet potatoes. This is a great recipe, though I think next time I may up the amount of miso paste. I'm looking forward to finding other uses for the miso scallion butter.

will work just as well with good, old-fashioned bright orange yams (my sister taught me that at our easter brunch). not only will i make it again, i'm counting the days!
