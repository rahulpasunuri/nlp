To the salad add 1 chopped red onion. To the dressing add juice of one lemon, salt and pepper, a tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp horseradish. This came from another reviewer.

i dont know how fair it is for me to rate this recipe since i really changed it up. i definitely found it to be a great springboard for some leftover corn on the cob i had. i combined shrimp, corn shaved from the cob, cherry tomatoes (halved), roasted red peppers, diced onion, fresh parsley and toasted cubed chunks of bread (bc just shrimp and veggies would never fill me up) for the dressing i pureed together shallots, olive oil, lemon juice, grilled tomatoes i had leftover i tossed the entire mixture together and served. it was ridiculously delicious, light and fresh tasting. a great summer dinner.
