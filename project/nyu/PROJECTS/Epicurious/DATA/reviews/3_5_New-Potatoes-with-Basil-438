This was delicious. Be sure to liberally sprinkle on the salt. If you use a cast-iron skillet, use a slightly lower temperature so as not to burn the potatoes.

I used a bit more butter (shoot me), and subbed green onions and yellow onions I had on hand for the shallots. Delicious. I'd never think to mix basil and potatoes, but these were just great. When I'm conserving bites of potato while there's a perfectly grilled steak on the plate, you know them taters are good.

This is a great, simple and flavorful recipe...and it tastes even better the second day. The flavors really work well together. I didn't have shallots, so I used yellow onions, minced and it turned out well. I made the potatoes to accompany a pot roast...mmm mmm! Delicious. I will definitely make item again.

I had high hopes for this recipe but it was quite a disappointment. There is a far superior recipe for new potatoes on this site called "GRILLED NEW POTATOES WITH PARMESAN AND HERBS" - it's absolutely divine. This one pales in comparison.

I have enjoyed this recipe for years. It goes well with a number of different dishes. I have served this at several parties and always received compliments. I tend to increase the amount of basil because it enhances the flavor.

This recipe was so easy to make, and very tasty! I couldn't find potatoes as small as the recipe suggested, so I cut my 2-inchers into quarters and turned them with a spatula. Had to keep the heat a little lower to prevent over-browning, but they cooked much more quickly than keeping them whole and were absolutely delicious!

This is a simple and delicious recipe! I made mine on the grill - and it was heavenly.
