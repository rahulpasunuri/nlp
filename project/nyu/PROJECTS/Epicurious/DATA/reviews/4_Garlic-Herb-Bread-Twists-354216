I made the pizza dough from the link, adding minced rosemary and smashed garlic to the dough prior to rising. Froze the other half of the pizza dough, unspiced. A few of my breadsticks overcooked on the top level, probably left them in a minute or two too long. Others look great, taste pretty good... Second batch in the oven being watched much more closely!

really fantastic! made these for a gathering with friends and everyone raved about them. made them exactly to the recipe, but next time i'll try adding a little garlic to the herb mixture inside.

Due to a miscalculation on my part, I ended up using one pound of store-bought plain pizza dough and one pound of homemade herbed pizza dough that I had in the freezer. Both came out well, though I thought the store-bought dough produced a more tender breadstick. The taste of both was wonderful, but my only minor complaint is that the breadsticks seemed to toughen as they got to room temperature. Perhaps this could be side-stepped by reheating, I haven't experimented with that yet.

These were wonderful. The changes I made were as follows...used whole wheat pizza dough, used fresh rosemary as the only herb and put 4 cloves minced garlic inside the breadsticks with the seasonings.

I used the pizza dough recipe link, which came out great. I used lemon thyme, savory, and rosemary. My husband and I ate almost half of them before dinner was even finished cooking. Great as a next-day snack, too!

Made these for friends over the weekend with minor changes -- sage instead of thyme, because that's what was in my herb garden and an extra dose of garlic in the pizza dough I had made for grilling. They were great -- looked good and lots of flavor. I did not have any to taste the next day, but I can't imagine why they wouldn't warm up well in a toaster oven. I also plan to make them through the initial baking and then freeze them for last minute hor d'oeurves.
