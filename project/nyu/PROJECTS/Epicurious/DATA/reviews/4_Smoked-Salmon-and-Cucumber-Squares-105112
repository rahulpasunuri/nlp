Good thing I tested it before serving to a crowd...The pumpernickel overwhelmed everything. Then the sauce was too runny - so I wound up using sesame flatbreads, flavored light cream cheese and spirals of cukes on the top. Disappeared fast. The pumpernickel bread went in the trash.

Tips for the sauce since others found it too runny-- FIRST: 'drain' the sour cream by placing it into a colander lined with a piece of paper towel. Let sit for about 10-15 min. Some extra liquid soaks up and makes the sour cream thicker (similar to the technique for making yogurt cheese). Scrape the thicker sour cream into a bowl and proceed. SECOND: prepared horseradish sauce is very watery. Consider squeezing away extra liquid, not just draining. These tips make a sauce that is nice and thick, spreads well and does not need to be refrigerated for an hour before using (as others have suggested). Used the suggestions of others as well--love the tip on draping the salmon over the cucumber ribbons, so they don't fall off. Topped with a small sprig of dill for color--that sticks nicely to the salmon. Everyone raved.

We both enjoyed this but the cucumber sour cream, etc needed to be in the refrig for an hour first. It was GREAT after that.

Tasty hors d'oeuvre you can make in a pinch. Also used a vegetable peeler for the cukes instead of julienne. I sliced the salmon and the cukes and made the sour cream spread the day before, then took everything to Easter brunch and assembled on the spot just prior to serving. Easy crowd-pleaser.

I was looking for a recipe using smoked salmon that didn't require putting it on bread. I took the cucumber and peeled it, then sliced it thick on the diagonal. I patted the slices down with paper towels. I used fat-free plain yogurt instead of sour cream and lots of horseradish. It definitely needed salt and pepper for seasoning. Then I simply put a layer of the sauce on the cucumber and topped it off with a piece of smoked salmon. I prepared it about an hour ahead of time and the only downside to using the cucumber as the base was that towards the end of the cocktail hour some moisture had drained from the cucumber onto the plate. The dish got rave reviews!

I took another reviewer's advice and just peeled and chopped the cucumbers. I also layered the bread with sour cream, then the cucumbers, and topped with the salmon. The salmon on top made it much easier to eat. Fabulous! Thanks, Jenni, for passing this along to me from your recipe box!

I used a vegetable peeler to make cucumber "ribbons" and topped each piece of salmon with that. It was a really easy recipe to prepare.

I made these for a party. I was short on time and help so I diced the cukes (without seeds). I sprinkled a few on each canape and topped with salmon. They looked great, and tasted even better! Perfect combination of flavors, and very elegant in presentation..

I made this for a small wedding shower, and my guests loved it. In a romantic vein, I used a small heart-shaped cookie cutter on the pumpernickle bread. Very good and easy recipe.

I couldn't find any p bread at my local grocery, so I used sourdough bread squares, lightly toasted. I was using fresh smoked salmon in large chunks (we get a lot up here in the Pacific Northwest) so I chopped it up a bit more and threw it into the sauce. Tasted a bit "fishy" so added more fresh pepper, rosemary, and some lemon pepper. Put about a tablespoon on each square with the cucumbers laid across in x's. Very good. Quick and easy.

I made a few of these at a recent cocktail party, and they instantly disappeared from the platter. My guests kept asking where I hid the wasabi. I informed them it was simply horseradish, but what an idea! Has anyone tried substituting wasabi for horseradish? I might try it, and use long strings of cucumber tied in a knot so it looks Japanese.

These were a hit at a recent tea party. One guest commented that they reminded her of sushi rolls. I didn't have a problem with the cucumber going limp...I used a very fresh, firm english cuke and they held up quite well. My local market was out of cocktail pumpernickel, so I tried cocktail rye instead, which worked out fine.

Made this dish to pass before a lunch party last week. Turned out great; simple to prepare and well received. The cucumber spirals (created using a vegetable peeler) looked fabulous, however, they came out quite limp. I might dice/chop cuke instead to create a contrasting "bite." I sprinkled mine with chopped chives from the garden which worked well.

A spin on a tried-and-true flavor combination. Very good, but nothing that new or unusual. I found using a potato peeler to make the cucumber strips was easy and looked the best.
