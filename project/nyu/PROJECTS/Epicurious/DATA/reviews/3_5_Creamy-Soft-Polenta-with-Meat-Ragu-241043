I have tried polenta a number of times, and I have never really liked it. This polenta recipe is fabulous. Admittedly I did not make the ragu, but the polenta was yummy.

This recipe is off, ratio wise. It made something resembling soup. There is all so no way that a ragu needs 2 cups oil. Awful

Well, this is exceptional! The amount of mushrooms is nothing to stress over I thought. Used 1 oz dried Porcini. The flavor was amazing. Of course there is a mistake with the amount of oil but that's easily solved. This is so very delicious and the bonus is how easy it is to prepare. A great recipe for a special dinner. Impressive!!

Made this to take to a Christmas Eve dinner. It was great. Made almost as written but agree with some of the other cooks that it was a bit thin. Added a tablespoon of paste. Also used half and half instead of cream in polenta. Very good! Making it again tonight for the book club ladies! Perfect for our cold snowy weather!

This was a very easy recipe to follow and to make. In true fashion,I altered it a bit though. After the polenta was made, I added some pancheta which I had pan fried. I also chopped up fresh basil and added that as well. Then I baked it in the oven on 425 for 30 minutes. I took it out and let it rest for 20 minutes before serving in squares along side a filet with truffel oil and crimini mushrooms that I had made.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I made this for my dad and I when I came home from college a few years ago. We could not stop eating it!

Agree with everyone below that the portions were WAY off. Do not make this with two cups of olive oil! I also could not find the dried porcinis so I just used fresh mushrooms (about 6 oz) that I diced. I forgot to brown them before adding, but I would brown them with the onions and garlic next time. I also felt that 3 pounds of meat was a little excessive, and as my boyfriend and I pretty much only eat poultry, we modified accordingly, using about 1.25 pounds of hot turkey sausage with a little italian chicken sausage too. The ragu was a little more liquid than I wanted (unsurprisingly), so I added a can of tomato paste, and then it was perfect. All in all, I thought it was very delicious and a great recipe for winter -- warm, hearty and filling. My boyfriend also loved it; think it would be a very popular dish for men. That said, it was a bit heavy and I would probably use some leaner ground turkey next time -- or a mix of lean ground turkey with the sausage -- heavily seasoned, and just make the polenta with broth for a little lighter of recipe.

With the adjustments to quantities that other reviewers have already noted, this dish was delicious. My boyfriend could not stop raving about this dish and he gets excited whenever I say I'm going to make it again.

Loved this recipe, but made some adjustments. I used half and half in place of the heavy cream and cut the meat in the sauce by half to save on calories. Was tasty none the less.

I only made the polenta part of this recipe to pair with a pork tenderloin I made. I used 2 cups chik stock and only 1 cup of half and half and it cooked perfectly in LESS than 10 minutes. My husband and 2 young sons gobbled it up. Can't wait to try the other part of this recipe!

This is delicious, but requires some adjustments. Agree with previous reviewers that proportions/quantity of recipe are way off. I went with the 2 cups of olive oil against my better judgment, then ended up draining out quite a bit halfway through cooking. I used 2 oz. dried porcinis and thought that amount was absolutely adequate. I used instant polenta and had terrific success with recipe. All in all, very tasty and I'm looking forward to my next attempt at making this with some tweaks.

I call shenanigans on creating creamy, soft polenta from scratch in 10 minutes. I was skeptical when reading it, but thought perhaps using 1/2 whole milk or cream might somehow affect the cooking time. At 10 minutes I still had very grainy polenta - not at all appealing! Upon review, nearly every recipe I've seen requires 30 minutes. So should this one!

First off, let me just say that this recipe is very poorly written. I'm giving this 4 forks with some modifications. First, you do not need 2 cups of olive oil. This cannot be right. All you need is enough to cover the bottom of the pan before you brown the meat. Second, you don't need the quantity of mushrooms asked for; I used half as much (because I was doubling the recipe and they aren't cheap), and it turned out great. Keep in mind that 1 oz. of dried mushrooms (which was how they were sold in my store, by the ounce) equals 4 oz. reconstituted mushrooms. So by my estimations, this recipe calls for 3 oz. of dried mushrooms, or 12 oz. reconstituted. You could get away with 1.5 or 2 ounces in this recipe. In terms of flavor and texture, this dish is awesome though. And the polenta was amazing. I wanted to drink it!!!

I could be wrong, but the printed measurements for this recipe are off. 3/4 of a lb. of porcini mushrooms would cost a fortune and overwhelm the dish (unless you are considering making it a vegetarian version). Also, 2 tbs of olive oil is more than enough to cook the meat (as opposed to the listed 2 CUPS!). The dish was amazing - with the previously listed changes.
