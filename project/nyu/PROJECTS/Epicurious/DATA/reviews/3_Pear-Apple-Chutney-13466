I doubled the recipe and followed the slight changes made by other reviewers. Cranberries instead of raisins gives a nice tang but requires a bit more sugar. Red wine vinegar and red wine, cinnamon stick, and ground mustard all good suggestions. Now I need to serve it to others for the real test!

Great, but I did a lot of tweaking based on what I had in the house: 3 pink lady apples (peels on), a handful of dried purple figs chopped instead of the pears, red wine vinegar instead of the rice vinegar, an additional 1/2 cup of red wine, and ground mustard instead of the seeds. The sugar and cinnamon stayed the same. I also cooked it for closer to 20 minutes. This turned out great, and I got a ton of delicious feedback!

This really is just nothing special. It tastes fine, but not worth effort. Not something i would make again.

I liked this recipe a lot. I was perfect on a baguette with very stinky cheese. My family said that it tasted like canned apple sauce, but I don't believe them. I didn't peel the fruit, and I think that it came out fine. I also cooked if for longer than the recipe called for because I wanted the fruit to be more broken down. When the recipe was just finished and it was still hot, I tasted it and thought that it was inedible. However, I put it in the fridge for a while and the flavors mellowed nicely, so I would probably suggest making this a little bit ahead of time.

This was very good. A wide range of people enjoyed this. - We peeled the skin before we made it. Cooking without the skins is a less colorful, but eliminates chewy peels. - Excellent balance of flavor, tasty, but not overpowering.

I really liked this recipe! I used a Red Delicious apple, a Granny Smith Apple and a pear, swapped the raisins for cranberries and used a cinnamon stick instead of cinnamon. Using three pieces of fruit instead of four yielded just the right amount--even so, I added a little more vinegar and sugar. I also cooked it for longer so the fruit would break down a bit more--I would definitely make this again.

My family loved this chutney. I used it as a much easier alternative to the apple chutney in the recipe for crostini with chutney, goat cheese and roasted garlic, and it was superb. I didn't peel the fruits and it still looked and tasted fantastic. A keeper.

I thought this recipe lacked flavor complexity and was rather ordinary. Wish it was more memorable!! The colors looked beautiful with the unpeeled skins of the apples and pears.

Please also comment on the sliced vs. chopped on the fruit! I don't see a reason; did you do this, and is there a logical consequence?

TO PEEL or NOT TO PEEL? The recipe does not state whether to peel the pears and apples. I am assuming they are not since it is not clarified. For those of you who have made this recipe, would you please post your suggestions? Thanks!

I thought this was very nice. I used more vinegar also, a total of 3/4 cup and a bit more mustard seeds. I only had green Barlett pears so rather than golden raisins I used dried cranberries for color. Served it with a grilled pork tenderloin.

Just as good as more complex chutney recipes. Super on goat cheese!

I love the different tastes in this recipe. I used ground mustard powder and currants instead. I also added a little more vinegar, about 1/2 cup. I used apple cider vinegar. Delicious!

This is a very good chutney. It got rave reviews both with our Thanksgiving meal and the tailgater party the next day. Try it with a soft cheese & bread for some extra zing
