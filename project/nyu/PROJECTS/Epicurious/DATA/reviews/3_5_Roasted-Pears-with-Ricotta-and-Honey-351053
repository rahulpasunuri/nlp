Have not made this specific recipe, but I make a very similar dish - great as an easy yet elegant appetizer - and even simpler than the one here: I use small seckel pears, slice them in half lengthwise (if possible, slice through the small stem so each half has its own little stem intact), and scoop out core. Brush each cut side with butter and roast, cut side down, at 375 until the cut side has a bit of golden color and the pear is just tender when pricked with a fork (roasting time varies based on pear size and ripeness). Flip pears over and fill each half with good quality blue cheese. Put back in the oven (under the broiler works as well) for 2-5 minutes until the cheese softens. Arrange pears on plates, two per serving. Drizzle with honey and sprinkle with toasted chopped pecans or hazelnuts, or toasted sliced almonds.

This is one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had. The layering of flavors is incredible. I did have some trouble with the caramelized almonds--it turned out very soft. I was out of almonds so tried it again with pinenuts and cooked it longer and turned out great. Any suggestions on the almonds?

A very nice, light desert. Easy too. I used ricotta left over from making lasagna. 1/4 cup maple syrup is too much, the almonds swim in it, so next time I would use just enough to flavor and coat the almonds. Otherwise, excellent, and I will make again when I have leftover ricotta.
