My four year old and I followed this recipe for opening and grating a coconut and it turned out great! I didn't drain it beforehand, so I didn't experience any drying out. We just baked it, let it cool, drained it, and cracked it open and shredded the meat in my food processor. Easy and very fun.

My son just experienced his first coconut. It was a very easy process. We first punched a hole in the soft eye and drained the water. Then we wrapped the coconut in plactic grocery store bag then we put the wrapped coconut in another grocery store bag. My son went out side and holding the handles swung the bag on to the concrete steps. The coconut broke in to manageable pieces and much of the meat popped off the shell. We then dumped all pieces into a colandar and washed to remove bits of shell. This was all very easy and very safe and great fun for an 8 year old!

Thank you so much for that comment. I thought it sounded a little strange to bake a coconut. I'm glad not to have tried it. How would you prepare the shreds for the cake then?

I have NEVER heard anything so atrocious for grating a coconut.....bake it?! Go into an asian / Indian store and buy a coconut grater. They are also available online. There are the more traditional kind available where the blade is attatched to a wooden platform...or the more updated version where the plastic base holds onto a flat surface with a suction cup so u can grate easily. Get the first kind and have someone in the store show u how to use it. The modern version...well the suction cup keeps giving way and makes the whole process very laborious. You do not bake the coconut....it dries it out....u might as well get the dessicated kind. The idea of using the fresh coconut is that it is mist with the coconut juices and the oils have not been brought out.
