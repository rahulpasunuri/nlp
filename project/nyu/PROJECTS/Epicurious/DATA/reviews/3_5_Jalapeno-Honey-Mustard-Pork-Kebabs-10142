These kebabs were great but probably would have been even better had I remembered to reserve some of the marinade to baste the kebabs with. The meat would have been more moist but we really enjoyed the flavors. Almonds work just as well as walnuts in the couscous recipe too.

The only thing we did is keep the seeds in from the fresh jalapeno because we love hot food. Other than that, loved it! I can't wait to share this recipe at our next BBQ it's going to be a hit.

Very good, very easy. We loved the marinade compostion. I followed the recipe even made the recommended couscous (which I would not do again). We overcooked the pork in about half the suggested grilling time - so beware.

I've made this several times for family and guests, all of whom have loved it. However I have only made it with Rosemary Mashed Potatoes instead of the couscous. The fresh rosemary is a perfect compliment to the kebabs. Next time, I plan to try the couscous.

Made this almost exactly as written (I used more jalapeno), with the couscous. I was somewhat skeptical about the two recipes together, but it was the perfect compliment. Awesome and great leftovers.

Excellent! I added a bit more jalapeno.

I made this with pork medallions instead of skewers, and it was lovely. Tried chili flakes instead of jalapeno, and it added just the right amount of heat and color to the dish. Super easy and healthy too. A definite success! Lemon and mint cous cous on the side was a perfect compliment.

Made the kebabs only with a boxed pilaf (it was a weeknight - forgive me) and they were quite tasty. I recommend mincing the jalepeno very well. Ours was a bit chunky, so there were pockets of lots of heat and pockets of none.

I have made this twice and it really is very good. I made it once with a tenderloin and once with center cut pork chops, both worked great. My only change was to the couscous recipe. I put the walnuts in a skillet with a little sugar to bring out the flavor and candy them lightly. Then I added just a bit more sugar to the couscous, the sweetness took it from blah to fantastic.

This was REALLY good... including the couscous recipe! Followed the recipe exactly and thought it was wonderful. Was a lot of food for two (served with sauted spinach w/ garahm masala), but somehow we managed to eat it all! ;-)

This is a great receipe! Instead of doing the kebabs I use my grilling basket quicker and easier for every day family dinners.

This was really good. I cheated and used 2 tsp of jalapeno puree which worked great. It had a nice kick. I served it with puttanesca over brown rice. I doubled the recipe for four people and found it was a bit two much but the left overs were great!

Very good - enough marinade for 2 tenderloins, which I left whole rather than cut into kebabs so the meat was more juicy. Took 20 min or so for medium/well. Increased the marinade time to over night and substituted red pepper flakes for the jalapeno just because I was out and it was fine (will try the jalapeno next time)Served it with orzo due to reviews and what was in the cupboard. Leftovers were great!

This was a really good way to grill pork tenderloin. I marinated the pork for about 4 hours. It was so tender and we all loved it. The couscous was just okay, will look for something better to go with the pork next time.

Made this last night and it turned out really well. My only advice is that I cooked the kebabs for a total of about 12 minutes and they turned out great. It just seemed that up to 20 mins for small pieces of pork tenderloin was too much time on the grill.

The kabobs were very easy and fast to prepare, and though they don't marinate long, the flavor really gets into the meat. Very flavorful and fresh tasting. Will absolutely make this dish again.

Delicious kebabs! I don't like the texture of cous cous, so I made Spanish rice instead. It's an easy recipe with great results.

Very good recipe. Easy & quick. I doubled recipe for family of 5. My 8 year old doesn't eat much and thank goodness, because there wouldn't have been enough. Absolutely no leftovers! Great flavor, I added red onion, cherry tomatoes, and red peppers to the kebabs. Great summer dinner.

I forgot to oil my grill so my kebabs didn't look so good. However... they tasted great! My husband especially liked this dish (and he doesn't usually like pork). I plan to make this again. I may also try the marinade on chicken The couscous was soso.

I used the stated ingredient amounts for marinade, but used a larger 1.25# tenderloin for kebabs, marinated for a few hours. I also used dried red pepper flakes instead of jalapeno since that was what I had on hand. We thought the pork was wonderful. I substituted jasmine rice for couscous and finished with pecans and currants instead of walnuts, the flavors were great. Also served steamed asparagus with lemon butter. An excellent meal, four forks.

This recipe is lovely -- simple and delicious. I've made it twice already, both times for guests, and each time enjoyed success.

The marinade/sauce is not a very good combination of flavors. It made me cringe when I smelled it. Too much mustard.

This is a wonderful recipe. The pork is moist every time!

Great! I made these along with the Sweet and Sour Pork Kebabs also on this site. My husband and I loved them both.

This was really good, fast and easy! My husband loved it. I also made it without the jalapeno, because I forgot to get it and it was still very good.

Sooo yummy! Tried the orange zest substitution and it was a huge hit! So easy that it has now become a weeknight favorite.

Perfect dishes for summertime outdoor dining. We've made the pork & cous cous several times, liking it best with pignoli rather than walnuts. & next time orange zest will be used instead of lemon. This dish is a definite Pass Along recipe!

I've been making this since the receipe appeared in Gourmet. Easy and fabulous!
