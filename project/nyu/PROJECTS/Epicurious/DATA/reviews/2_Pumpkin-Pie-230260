For a low calorie pumpkin pie. Not bad. I used a regular pie crust and prebaked it. I added about a tablespoon brown sugar also and a few more spices - cloves and allspice. My husband did not think it was good, but, like I said, for a low calorie healthy sweet, it was not bad. If you're having company though, please make a real one.

This is a great alternative for folks who can't eat dairy. I used two whole eggs, substituted the canned pumpkin for fresh and didn't have allspice so used 1/8 t cloves instead. I put it in a regular pastry crust and it turned out wonderful! made it w/ my 3 yr old's daycare class. the kids and teachers all raved over it. Thank you!

Pretty awful... guests ate some to be polite until I destroyed the evidence. Perhaps pumpkin pie was never meant to be low-fat and it got its revenge.
