I made these for friends and we loved them. I didn't see the note about chilling the chicken mixture so my meatballs came our flat on one side:( I think the success of this recipe is with the BBQ sauce that you use. I had Stubbs and a bottle of Trader Joe's that I combined and it was great.

I wish I could give 3.5 stars for this or qualify the 4 stars. Man these are good. They are the perfect game day food. Dude food. Delicious, lick the bowl clean food for a laid-back setting. I've now made these twice, both times for mostly guys. The first time was for a college football game and they were inhaled. The second time was for my boyfriend's fantasy football draft at our house - this time I doubled the recipe and served with toasted buns on the side -- the bowl was wiped clean. The meatballs are really tasty on their own, I topped them with Bone Suckin Sauce (the best!) - the hot flavor. Granted, they might be a little messy for a more sophisticated setting, but for hanging out they are spectacular. I got rave reviews - will make again and again. My only notes are that they are definitely tricky to ball up, so as others have recommended, I would definitely chill the meat so it's more solid. Yum!

We liked these a lot. I made them with a friend who does not like onions, so we substituted garlic. We used a homemade barbecue sauce. They were easy and delicious. Recommended!

Good but not great. Fairly bland. Also, add about 1/3 extra cup of bread crumbs for proper consistency.

Made these last year and they were a hit. Have made them a few times since and have referred friends to this site and they also love it. Making it for Rosh Hashanah as an extra meat dish next week. First time I'm reviewing a recipe.

These were great. I made them for my teenaged sons and their friends for a World Cup gathering. I baked them instead of frying (omitted the olive oil), and coated them with bottled Buffalo wing sauce instead of barbecue. Everyone loved them, and so much easier and tidier than making Buffalo wings!

Great alternative to ground beef! I have used this as a base recipe and altered it with Italian seasonings and used it in pasta dishes as well!

My fiance and I love eating these as sandwiches served on warm flatbread with red cabbage slaw and feta cheese. Yum! Nothing earth shattering here, but they are very good.

very wet mixture, added more crumbs and had to chill it to make them hold any shape at all. But in the end, quite good.

I can't believe this is my first EPICURIOUS review... I had something similar to this in Tucson last week, but the sauce was smoky and the meatballs were quite firm. I skipped the applesauce (I'm not sure why you need it) used extra breadcrumbs, substituted cayenne for the chili powder, and skipped the bbq sauce in favor of salsa. Perfect for Cinco de Mayo tapas!

I followed the recipe exactly and these came out delicious. I made them for my office holiday party but my roommates loved them so much I had to make another batch for dinner.

I really liked this recipie but instead of using the bbq sc which i thought would just make it tooo sweet we used buffalo sauce and they turned out great, perfect for football sunday or as an appetizer ...I tried itwith the bbq sc and wasnt impressed but sub it with buffalo sc and it was great !

super easy to make! I doubled the recipe and used 2/3 cup of bread crums and 2/3 cup of cream of wheat to give it a softer fluffier texture. DELICIOUS!

Great addition to my Halloween party. I used ground turkey. What's up with FreshCope? Lonely perhaps?

What usually binds meatballs together? Egg, of course.

Any suggestions on what to sub the apple sauce with?

Gruesome. Appropriate only for the cocktail weenie and Buffalo wings set.

We made these for a party and served with tooth-picks... I was nervous because it didn't seem like a very elegant or gourmet dish (and the rest were...) but it was a huge hit. We didn't cook all of them that night and so made the rest the next day for a new group of people who also loved them.

These meatballs were absolutely delicious! I tripled the recipe and had leftovers the next day and my family is asking for them again already!
