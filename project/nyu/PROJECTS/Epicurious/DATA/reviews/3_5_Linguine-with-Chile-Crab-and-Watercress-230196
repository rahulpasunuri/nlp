I love this recipe, but I use a pound of fresh crab in it. Watercress is hard to find for me, so I tried a big handful of arugula and it worked well. Not sure what kind of chile the recipe really calls for, but I look for a red jalepeno and if I can't find a fresh red chili, I'll just use a seeded jalepeno.

I have made this a couple of times and it is easy and delicious. Bought canned lump crab at Kroger and it was good. If you don't have a red chile, red pepper flakes are a good substitute. Omitted the watercress last time and served sauteed spinach on the side.

Great tastings, easy to make dish - all it takes is boiling pasta water, and the sauce is just mashed together in a mortar/pestle. Fantastically quick, and a great one for summer - the lemon gives it a zing and freshness. I added some extra lemon oil, and garlic, it would be even better with a touch more chili next time.

The amount of salt added here seems crucial -- not too little, not too much. Didn't use watercress (why would I buy watercress?). The combo of parsley, salt, and lemon zest was very tasty. I could (hypothetically) eat staggering quantities of this very happily.

I was worried when looking over the ingredients this would be bland--turns out I was correct. Used fresh crab, salvaged the dish by adding some homemade pesto.

This dish was incredible. Delicious, easy, quick and the leftovers are even better the next day. I was a little nervous about using canned crab but it actually worked. I would use fresh in season. You must try this one!

So yummy! Easy, inexpensive & delicious. This is by far the most impressive dish of its simplicity that I've ever made. I'll be using this one on guests, when I want to wow them (and also have fun at my own dinner party - the prep is quick). I used *fresh spinach* linguine, instead of dry linguine... great results. My husband and I love this dish. Vegetarians could use finely chopped artichoke hearts instead of crab! xox lis harvey
