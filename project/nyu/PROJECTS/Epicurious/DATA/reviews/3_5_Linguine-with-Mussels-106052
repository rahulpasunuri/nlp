This recipe as it is is a good start. I would reccommend that you add the things you like to make it great. I was looking for something with shallots and pasta and something quick and it did the trick. I added wine in place of the water and next time I might roast the shallots with olive oiland add some lemon with additional garlic. Overall its a decent quick dish.

I liked this recipe but I think it would be better with a little fennel added for flavor. I did use wine instead of the linguine water which adds flavor but still lacked the spices.

I made this for mom's day brunch and it was a big hit with everyone, even with the non-mussels eater amongst us. Very easy and quick to prepare, too!

Very simple yet flavorful dish IF you use white wine instead of water and toss in some grate parmesan. I dont even know why it was posted that way.I have made several shellfish pasta combinations that take forever to prepare and the results just arent worth all the work but this one sure changed my mind. Perfect for weeknights and at least in New England mussels are SO CHEAP. I was a little worried putting the mussels in with such little liquid to cook (just the butter) but I was amazed at how quickly they cooked and the vegetables werent sticking. Definitely making it again tonight.

Awesome and versatile. I've made this on several occasions. Once with mussels, another time with clams, and most recently with shrimp and crab. I also used white wine instead of the pasta water.

Absolutely awesome. Kids loved it so did the company. I added white wine instead of the noodle water just for extra pizzaz.... ENJOY!!!

The recipe is very good as it stands but, I experimented a lttle. When cooking the shallots add 1 cup of sliced fennell (about an 1/8th of an inch slice. Omit celery. Before adding cream add 2oz of Pernod. Follow rest of the recipe.

I've made a dish similar to this but with an italian flair,ie; tomatos, onions, basil, etc... To complain about the sauce for any dish would say that my experience cooking is not all that great, but come on folks, if its watery simmer until reduced. If its dry you simply add more water and I use the pasta water to aid in the sauce. Then proceed with the main ingredient, the mussels. Which is what the whole recipe is about.

The good thing about this variation on mussels with sauce poulette is the pasta to hold the sauce, but it needs more flavor. You don't need shallots AND garlic, but you do need stronger herbs (thyme, oregano)and a little white wine to cook the aromatics in before adding the mussels. I also added a level teaspoon of potato starch at the beginning to make sure the sauce would not be too runny.

Good basic recipe but needs help. Recipe needs dry white wine, salt, more garlic, a touch of hot pepper flakes and a sprinkle of herbs such as basil, mint or fennel depending on your taste. A drizzel of extra virgin olive oil and a squeeze of lemon takes it over the edge!.

Easy weekday dinner. Quite filling served with crusty bread. Use the larger amounts of water as this dish is not very saucey.
