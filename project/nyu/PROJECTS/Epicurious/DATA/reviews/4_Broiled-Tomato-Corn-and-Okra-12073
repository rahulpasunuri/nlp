As suggested in previous reviews, I also used halved grape tomatoes, frozen corn, and added a sliced yellow onion and a chopped poblano pepper. I would echo everyone's surprise at how delicious this quick and simple recipe turned out to be.

I also added a hot pepper, onion and minced garlic, and I broiled an ear of corn next to the pan to brown it, adding it later. My tomatoes were not soupy and the dish came out the right consistency. I would not, however, recommend adding the basil. As much as I love the flavor, it "Italian-ized" the roasted vegetables in a way I'd rather keep for another dish. Instead, I agree that Cajun seasoning would work well with this.

Quick and easy side dish using in-season produce. Very tasty -- though I did add thinly sliced sweet onions and minced garlic. Slid this into the oven after roasting a chicken and it was done by the time the chicken was carved. Am enjoying the cold leftovers and plan to serve it as a salad sometime.

Forgot to mention that I left out the tomatoes, so no soupiness for me.

I normally don't rate recipes that I make changes to, but I'm sure the way it's written it would be great too. However I do make the following suggestion as some reviewers said that the okra didn't cook properly: Broil corn and okra on low heat on the middle rack for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until both corn and okra are tender. Then turn up broiler to high for 3-5 minutes, until the okra turns slightly brown and the sliminess is gone. Keep a close eye on it, as it will burn quickly. Other than that, I added sliced garlic, a bit more oil, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, salt, black pepper, and chopped parsley (no basil). I like okra in general, but this was over the top delicious! Served it with a tomato salad and grilled lamb chops. This will be a weekly summer dish from now on.

Super simple. I used all fresh ingredients from the farmer's market (I think quality of ingredients is key for this dish). I had some small zucchini, so I added them, but otherwise followed the recipe. WONDERFUL.

Very easy to make and a great use for summer vegetables. Should have taken previous cooks' advice and used grape tomatoes rather than bigger ones. The bigger tomatoes turned into more of a chunky stew. My okra did not cook all the way, but I never have good luck with it. Recipe tasted great, and would definitely try again with cajun seasoning!

I make this every year... Fresh produce is key to this dish! Often I toss in some garlic, onion and fresh jalepeno or red pepper flakes. Scrumptious!

Enjoyed this a great deal. We often toss a chopped poblano pepper in with the corn and okra and it adds a great dimension to the dish.

Very tasty and easy. I used red and green heirloom tomatoes, added some onion, garlic, and a hot pepper, and subbed fresh thyme for the basil. It was a little soupy, but real tasty and fresh. I served it with grilled chicken sausage. Great way to use some of my CSA produce!

Forgot to add that I used frozen corn and okra as it is neither corn nor okra season. Dish still came out great.

Loved this...per others' suggestions used halved cherry tomatoes and added garlic and onion. I also used Cajun-esque spices instead of the basil to turn the dish into an oven-blasted version of stewed Okra: dried thyme, cayenne pepper, and put in a handful of fresh chopped parsley as well as some shakes of Tabasco just before serving.

I added sliced onions and garlic, also replaced the sliced large tomatoes with grape tomatoes cut in half. That way I tossed everything in EVOO then broiled all together. Saved time and energy.

Not sure why, but this is one of those recipes that don't sound that great but turn out awesomely. Very good. Husband loves it. I make it a lot when I need an easy veggie side and when okra is in season.

Seemed too simple to be really good, but definitely is a keeper. The okra has a great texture - not too slimy. Added a little extra black pepper. A great way to use extra summer produce. Will definitely make again!!

Very good, and a definite keeper. Even my mother (whose first reaction to learning the ingredients was 'I hate okra') took some home with her after dinner.

This dish is wonderful. I was looking forward to eating the leftovers for breakfast but my family already had!

Wow! Didn't sound like it would work; I was afraid the okra wouldn't cook. Was I mistaken. Was so delicious, we gobbled it up. I added sliced Vidalia onion and chunks of a skinny eggplant.
