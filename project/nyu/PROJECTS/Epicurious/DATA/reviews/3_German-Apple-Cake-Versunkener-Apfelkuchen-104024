made as Christmas dessert for German Jewish friends.I found ihe batter very dense,even adding 4ozs yoghurt and 3/4 c milk. I topped with 1 c crushed walnuts and 24 carmels melted in 1/2 c whipping cream poured over top and down the sides. The cake was heavy and needed the extra sweetness. I used Granny Smiths. If made it again I would mix the apples.

I made the cake the other day it was delicious however it was a little dry on the bottom half of the cake so my I poured whisky on the bottom of the cake and soaked it for awhile and it was delicious. Next time I will add a little more water.

This cake is delicious, but I do add 1/2 plain low-fat yoghurt to the batter along with the milk. After peeling and coring the apples, I run them through the slicer on my food processor, which makes the slicing a breeze. I don't think it's that sweet (and I'm not a fan of super-sweet desserts). It would also make a great coffee cake, too.

Excellent pound-cake like texture. I make it every year either at Christmas. The almond extract glaze is great. A family favorite. The only thing is that it tends to stick to the pan if the pan isn't greased really well.

I'm not sure what happened, but the cake fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pan. What a mess! This is the first time I have been unable to recommend a recipe on Epicurious.

In order to give this delicious cake a better shape, fill bundt pan about half with the dough. Cut apples into thin wedges, stick wedges into dough diagonally in concentric circles, starting from the outset. Sprinkle top with brown sugar when finished Dough will rise, covering wedges more completely, leaving out very nicely goldened tips forming a beautiful pattern. Cake should be more convenient to cut this way. Instead of apple wedges, try quince wedges or halved apricots. Cake will be just as wonderful.

We have a hobby apple orchard, so around this time of year I am always looking for new twists to my apple repertoire. An older family friend learned how to make Apfelkuchen in Germany, and always remembered us when she baked it with some of our apples. I have been trying to replicate her dough but without much success, this recipe (as written) included. She made it in a large rimmed cookie sheet so all the apples fit in one layer, and her dough was soft, on the verge of crumbling, and almost the consistency of pie crust. But oh so flavorful! Apfelkuchen is an everyday cake  served for breakfast or with coffee - not so much for company or special occasions. I think a photo would have helped with the somewhat unrealistic expectations that the kuchen dough would have a chiffon or pound cake- like consistency. This recipe is unnecessarily complicated; it tries to make the cake something its not! Bundt cake pans work better for rich yeasty doughs, so consider a 10 deep dish cake pan. I incorporated the eggs whole, as there is no significant benefit to the extra step of whipping egg whites. I used only 5 apples, but had more on deck ready to pinch-hit if needed. Our friend used no spices in hers, so the rich taste of apples came through. My mother dipped her apple slices in lemon water to prevent browning, and carried the lemon theme through by incorporating 1 tsp. freshly grated lemon peel into the dough. It worked well. Apfelkuchen is a kitchen classic, and I do urge you to try some form of it. An internet search for Images of Versunkener Apfelkuchen provides some great photos for presentation ideas, and there isnt a middle layer of apples in sight.

My 15yo grandson made this for his German Class project last year. The teacher asked if she could take home the leftovers. We will probably make it for Rosh Hashanah this year.

I didn't read the previous reviews before I made this, but it didn't turn out too bad. The cake did not fall apart, but there were too many apples on the top (if you follow directions and split the apples). I'd recommend if you follow the recipe, only use 2 lbs of apples, put 3/4 of them in between the layers, and then just one layer of apples on the top. The almond glaze was a great addition.

Fairly easy to make (be sure to include extra time as peeling/dicing eight apples can take a good bit if you're working alone). Tastes great!

I make this all the time for my german class- If I don't make it or bring something else in everybody gets dissapointed. This is a great recipe, and try the 3/4 milk 1/2 vanillia yougert, works a lot better !!!

I followed the recipe exactly, using a combination of apples and adding brown sugar/cinnamon/white sugar to the top. I noticed that the batter seemed a bit dry but I trusted the recipe. I baked it in a bundt pan with a removable bottom. It came out great - exactly as described - but it took at least 45 minutes longer than the recipe called for so be prepared for that. Also, it makes a lot of cake.

This is a great cake and is very good with coffee.

This cake was very heavy. I used less apples than called for and still it was too dense. I added cinnamon and nutmeg - and used the brown sugar glaze. When cut the cake fell apart at the middle layer...tastes better than it looks.

This cake tasted wonderful but didn't look very aestheteically pleasing. The batter looked very dry, so I added extra milk. THIS MADE THE BATTER TOO WET! When I took it out of the bundt pan, it collapsed. Asided from this cake's looks, it was delicious, but a little too sweet. It kept well in the refrigerator and seem to get better as the days went by.

After reading the reviews I decided to increase the milk to 3/4 cup, and added about 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt. The batter was just that...incredibly light and smooth. I also spiced up the apples with nutmeg and cinnamon, and sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top, since I too thought it was a bit odd that there were no spices called for in the recipe. Next time I might try some streusel as well, but it was absolutely fabulous just as it was. A definite keeper!

I modified the recipe based on some of the reviews I read. I used less flour, more milk, and even added some cream (didn't measure exactly how much) to soften the batter before adding the egg whites. In addition, instead of using only apples, I used apples, pears, and plums. The cake was incredible and received rave reviews from some very discriminating eaters.

After reading the reviews I've used 2.5 cups of cake flour instead of 3 cups,increased milk to 3/4 cups, and finally instead of a kugelhopf or Bundt pan, I've used a 10"X18"X3" pan and it turned out so well that it was vanished instantly. Definitely I'll be using this recipe.

I should have read the other reviews before I wasted three pounds of apples. I thought the 'batter' seemed awfully thick and it completely crushed the egg whites. Half of it stuck in the pan, of course, due to the middle layer of apples that did not adhere to the dough. It wasn't too bad eating it out of the bundt pan with a spoon, but I think my addition of cinnamon, nutmeg and 5-spice powder helped a bit.

I'm glad I forgot that Epicurious recipes have reviews - I didn't check first & made this recipe, which I wouldn't have had I read the reviews! I definitely agree with ALL the reviewers, though - truly bizarre recipe to make, but great results! I'm the pastry chef at the inn my husband & I own & I wanted to use up the many apples we've got on the property at this time of year. My problems with the recipe were 1) trying to fold whipped whites into wet-cement-like batter, as mentioned elsewhere, and 2) trying to evenly layer what seemed like twice as much chopped apple as batter. I greased & floured the bundt pan pretty well, so no problems sticking, and mixed the apples into the batter a bit, instead of just layering. I also thought it was odd that there were no spices - added just a pinch of cloves, cinnamon, ginger. We served the cake warm with homemade caramel sauce & homemade cinnamon ice cream - huge hit!

I agree with the reviewer who said something must have been missing in the recipe. My batter had the consistency of cookie dough, and the egg whites were destroyed during the "fold"; it did not come close to a consistency that could be poured into a pan. On the up side, I think the flavor was good, and if it hadn't stuck in the pan I might actually have served it!!

Excelent. I took this cake to a Church Missions Dinner, It was a big hit and I was asked for the recipe. I will surely make this again.

I believe that there must be a missing fluid ingredient (oil perhaps) or an incorrect quantity (not enough milk, too much flour) called for in this recipe. When I made this, I ended up with a dough instead of a batter. I salvaged my apple cake batter by adding approx. 1/2 cup milk and about 1/4 cup oil and stirring before adding the beatened egg whites.
