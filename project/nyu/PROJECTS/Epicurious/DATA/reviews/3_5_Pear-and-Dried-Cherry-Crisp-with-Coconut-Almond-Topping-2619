Delicious! My topping never got to the consistency described, unfortunately, so I added extra flour and almonds to it. I also added about a TBS of milled flax seed, and it could have taken more. My guess is there is a little too much butter in the recipe - I'll reduce it next time and see if the topping comes out better. Once it was all cooked, though, it was perfect. I recommend using more pears than suggested and doing it in a deeper dish, as the topping was a little overwhelming. Oh, and if you're a lazy dishwasher like I am, you'll like this. I lined my cassarole dish with wax paper and didn't butter it at all, and my clean up was practically nonexistent.

I love this pear crisp recipe. It is a nice change from the traditional Apple crisp with oat topping. I used the cranraisins and it was great.

This crisp was so delicious! The topping was very good, but I added a bit of kosher salt to balance the sweetness. Made with Craisins instead of cherries.

I have made this dessert every year since it was published. I love and everyone else seems to also. Since the beginning I have substituted dried cranberries (Craisins work extremely well) for a bit of tartness. I have even used this topping for other crisps throughout different seasons...peaches are great also!!

I followed the suggestion of a couple of apples because I was short on pears. Otherwise, I followed the directions and we really enjoyed this dessert. It is one of the few cooked pear desserts I've truly enjoyed.

I made this recipe for thanksgiving this year and it was a big hit. Even my mother-in-law pronounced "this is better than a bakery sheet cake!" (Her highest compliment.)I also added a few apples in with the pears, and served it with whipped cream made with vanilla, ginger, and cinnamon.

I made this recipe last Thanksgiving,when pears seem to be at their best! I always serve several desserts since we normally have lots of family. The baking dish was scraped clean! This was so delicious with the dried cherries and coconut topping! Like another reviewer I also added a couple of apples.

This was a big hit at a recent family reunion dinner. Everyone was so happy that the cherries were cherries and not raisins. So much more interesting!

This is my favorite dessert. I use Green apples with the pears and make coriander ice cream (with honey so the texture is rich and smooth) to serve on top. Sometimes the pears are too sweet, or flavorless, the apples help.

This was good, but the nutmeg flavor overwhelmed everything else. If I made it again I would decrease or eliminate the nutmeg. The dried cherries are an interesting addition.

This is a very tasty crisp recipe that I have made twice with great success. The topping is especially good.
