I read the reviews before making it for the first time. Because I am at high altitude, I put the potatoes in for 20 minutes at 380F, then added the chicken (and some carrots) and cooked for another 40-45 minutes. It was fantastic and great with a white wine.

Made this as directed except I left the chicken in the olive oil/garlic/thyme marinade for a bit before roasting. Also, added carrots @ 40 minutes into cooking time. All came out crispy, carmelized and yummy. This will be added to the roasted chicken rotation!

As others have learned, the potatoes need some extra time, at a higher temp, to get all crispy crunchy blackened oily delicious.

This was just ok for me. Because my family only eats legs and breasts, I did 6 legs, 2 breasts. At the end of the cooking time the breasts were close to dry and the potatoes were not crusty, though they were tasty. I removed the chicken, then blasted the potatoes at 500 degrees to crisp them up a bit. This helped. I think the whole thing would be better on a rimmed cookie sheet. Better browning of chicken and potatoes.

I have made this dish many times and it is a no fail. The timing is perfect and the chicken and potatoes come out perfect. Great for a dinner part.

Simple and effective. A little problem with the temperatures, as we here in the UK use Celcius, but much enjoyed by my typically ravenous Friday night family...

We love this one - so delish. Be careful on the cooking time though - I cook for 50 minutes, remove the chicken to a platter and cover, and then continue to cook the potatoes the remainder of time. Very, very good...

Already a favorite! I used red potatoes & carrots also added fresh rosemary & paprika.

This is a great tasting and really easy recipe. Family and guests love it. The only addition I make is to add fresh rosemary and tuck some sliced garlic under the chicken skin. Delicious.

yum!... easy to do... and very low maintenance... thought it would be good to leave chicken in the marinade for about an hour or so, before roasting... chicken skin slightly crispy on outside...so were the potatoes...

I loved this recipe and to speed it up I sometimes substitute small red potatoes with skins on and they work great.

I loved this recipe and have made it again and again. I did add the following, added some additional extra virgin olive oil, cut up one onion, some garlic powder, salt, perpper and paprika with the potatoes mixture and put it on the chicken as well. The potatoes and the chicken came out nice and crispy. It's easy to prepare. Put it in the oven, set the timer and just forget about it until the timer rings and dinner is ready.

This was a very easy and fast recipe to prepare. Great to throw in and forget about while busy with other things. It was a little heavy on the oregano so that I will reduce the amount next time. It reminded me of the flavor of chicken cacciatore sans the tomatoes. Make sure you use a large roasting pan to give the potatoes the chance to crisp up and crust over, otherwise they will steam.

So much to like about the recipe (the ease and the delightful smell of garlic baking were two big ones) and yet the overall product was disappointing. My potatoes definitely didn't get crusty and the taste of everything was underwhelming. I am tempted to try it again with smaller potato wedges to see if that makes a difference, but with all the fabulous looking recipes still to be tried I'm not sure when I'll get around to it. Curious to see if future reviewers have better luck!

Very easy and tasty. I particularly enjoyed the potatoes. They were nicely flavored by the chicken juices.
