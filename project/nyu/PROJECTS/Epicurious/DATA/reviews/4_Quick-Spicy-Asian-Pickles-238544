These were really good. I used equal parts of red pepper, cucumber, red onion and carrots as I was looking for a bit more colour. I'll be making this again, again, and again.......

Oh man, these are so good! I call them "quickles" since I don't have to wait weeks to eat them, but the longer you wait (say, 24 hours), the better they taste. I have also pickled zucchini and carrots with this recipe. Sweet and spicy!

I just made these and they are so flavorful and easy! As per other's suggestions, I doubled the red pepper and added a clove of chopped garlic. Will surely make again.

My variation of this recipe includes adding fresh minced garlic. the garlic adds a tremendous extra flavor to the pickle. I use this to pickle radishes and carrots. They work really well. I use baby carrots for pickling. I personally love to eat these pickles with a bowl of rice and maybe pickled meats as well.

Wow, Fast, and packed with flavor. I like it spicey so I added extra pepper flakes. Next time I will cut a thinner batch for topping burgers etc. And even nicer - They ARE ready in an hour!

Easy, fast and delicious! We do add just a little more red pepper, but we like spicy.

I've made this many times now. I loved it the first time, but now use about double the red pepper, which I warm in a bit of sesame oil for a few minutes. Gives it a nice kick.

This is a great easy recipe and the flavors blend into a delicious slightly spicy highly flavored sophisticated pickle
