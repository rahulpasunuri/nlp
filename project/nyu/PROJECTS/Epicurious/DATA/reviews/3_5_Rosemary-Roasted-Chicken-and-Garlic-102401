I think the chicken was 2 forks, but the sauce was 3 1/2 forks! My husband reduced the sauce far more than 1 minute. He cooked it until it was just a glaze, and it was outstanding! The chicken alone wasn't anything special, but, with the sauce, it was great. I had to cook the chicken about 10 minutes longer than the suggested time and I broiled it for the final 1 or 2 minutes of cooking. This is such an easy, quick dish, I would certainly make it again.

A very good and easy to make dish. I do add a little lemon juice at the end.

Did not like this at all. It was very boring. Should have read the reviews before making this (though I was not the cook, my husband was). Some of the suggestions might have made a huge difference. I don't think we will be trying this again.

A great roasted chicken recipe. I've made it as is, or sometimes I change up the herbs, going with fresh oregano and sage, or fresh tarragon. Whatever I have on hand. I often serve it with the Spaghetti Squash with Mushrooms and Herbs, also on this site.

This recipe is a good base. Granted, I used boneless, skinless breasts, but I did rub them in olive oil and added some salt as suggested by other reviewers. I would make this again, but I would make a paste out of a couple of the garlic cloves, salt, and rosemary to rub on the breasts then quickly sear them (with or without skin) on the stove top before putting it in the oven. Also, after the wine boiled down I added 1/2 Tbs of butter to bring the sauce together. An easy weeknight meal.

Rating: 3
Really good recipe--perfect for weeknight meals. I use different fresh herbs each time (lemon thyme, basil). Roast some seasonal vegetables alongside and add a green salad. Easy dinner!

I was impressed with this dish - the chicken was incredibly moist. I rubbed lemon underneath the skin and added minced garlic and a touch of butter underneath the skin before cooking. I would like to try it again with something else other than the white wine as I found it too bland. Maybe sherry?

This is so delicious for the little work it requires. The only change I made was to add some freshly squeezed lemon to the last 5 minutes of cooking.

A very easy and tasty dish. After chicken was done, I made a gravy with herbs, poured over chicken and then returned to oven for about 15 minutes. The chicken all but disappeared at my dinner party.

Sooo delicious. Very easy to make. I didn't have chicken breasts, so I used thighs. I served it with a side of couscous and steamed broccoli. I poured some of the sauce on the broccoli. Very tasty, will definitely make again.

This is a good basic recipe. Like many others, I made some tweaks to make it work better for my preparation - the GRILL. I ignored the chicken broth altogether, and just substituted a good amount of olive oil (sorry, I didn't measure). I also didn't have white wine on hand, so I used a nice red. I used way more fresh rosemary, and way more minced garlic. I also added some dried thyme and just for kicks put some Penzey's chipotle powder to give it a little kick. I liked the fresh smell of the marinade without the chipotle powder, but giving it a tiny kick would probably be for the best I thought... It worked quite well. I think it's a good - "Hey do you wanna have grilled chicken tonight? Sure!" recipe. :-)

I loved that this was quick and easy! Especially for a new cook like me that gets confused over technical recipes.

I love this recipe, I modified it a bit though. While the chicken is first cooking I half-cook some orzo pasta. When I add the chicken broth I add the orzo as well as a can of diced tomatoes (strained). When everything is done just use a slotted spoon to get the orzo/tomato mix and serve the chicken on top of it.

I'm usually a pretty decent cook, but have not had much luck with cooking chicken breasts in the past (always too dry!). I was encouraged by the other reviews and decided to give this a try, and mine too turned out very juicy. Even after I cut into the chicken part of the way through cooking to test, it still turned out great. It needed 10 more minutes than the stated time. I added olive oil and salt and pepper under the skin as other reviewers have suggested, and a touch of cayenne pepper on the outside as well. Had some carrots in the fridge so I cut them up and tossed them in the pan with the garlic. Great low fuss weeknight dinner.

Very juicy and flavorful chicken. I'll add a bit of cayenne next time, but it was great as written.

This was a very easy recipe and it was wonderful. I used cubed small, red tomatoes and roasted them in the pan with the chicken. It was excellent!

very easy and with few ingredients. i also roasted sweet potatoes alongside the chicken-- they went together very nicely.

Rating: 3
I thought this was a good dish. I've never experimented much with rosemary and thought it gave the chicken a great flavor. Like some other reviewers I also added chopped sweet potatoes around the chicken and garlic in the pan and drizzled the wine/broth sauce over them when cooking was done. I would definately make it again.

Rating: 3
A delicious way to re-vamp that boring old "rosemary chicken" dish. We made this per the recipe (though doubled) with sweet potatoes roasting along in the dish...all was perfect. One note: as our chicken was quite large, we increased roasting time for at total of 40 mintutes. Yum.

Rating: 3
Very easy, very quick. My boyfriend and me made this last night after an exhausting day. It hardly took any effort. We didnt have low-salt broth, still equally good. Cracked pepper gives a nice texture and great taste. If you are low-fat conscious, keep the skin while cooking, and don't eat it, as tempting as it looks.

Rating: 3
Simple and yummy. I used skinless chicken and my skillet on the gas range instead of in the oven. We enjoyed it, and my 4-year old ate his whole serving (instead of negotiating how many "bites" will "earn" him dessert).

Rating: 4
This recipe was an excellent solution to my sparse pantry. i used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, as opposed to the breasts called for, and added some finely chopped veggies with the broth. i also didn't have any white wine on hand, but my room mates and i were amazed and delighted none the less.

Rating: 4
A very quick and easy recipe, I made it with sauteed spinach and roasted red potatoes that I cooked along with the chicken. My husband loved it and it's quick enough for a weeknight dinner.

Rating: 3
This was simple and very tasty. I either use leg quarters or a whole chicken split in half instead of breasts (same temperatures only longer). Also, I used to make this with the wine but I rarely have it in the house anymore--believe me, it's still very good without it. If you don't feel like messing with the rosemary then just grab yourself a nice batch of Herbes de Provence (available from Penzy's). Crush several cloves of garlic (I use about seven) and a mix with a few tablespoons of olive oil then add a few tablespoons of the herbs. Mix in coarse salt to taste and you should end up with a relatively thick paste. Smear that under the skin and bake! Yum!

This a weekly and favorite dish at our home and with roasted potatoes and carrots makes an easy but delicious dinner.

i've been making this regularly since it was first published. those of you with bland chicken, i've generally add more salt as well as more rosemary. and it does take a bit longer to cook through. still, it's one of my favorite things - i've made it as a quick dinner for me and my beau, and i've made it for friends - all have asked me to make it for them again and again!

I made this dish today for the first time, and after reading all of the reviews, i decided i'd add a little extra salt so i didn't get bland chicken. In addition to rubbing the rosemary under the skin, i put olive oil and salt. I also cooked potatoes, onions, and mushrooms along side the chicken (on that i put olive oil, salt, garlic powder, and rosemary) Everything was absolutely delicious. The chicken took a total of about 45 minutes to cook. I would definately make this dish again, my husband loved it!

This is a wonderful dish! I have made it several times. The key is "fresh" rosemary. It has always been a big hit.

I've made this three times now, and it does not disappoint. I think it's in the freshness of the ingredients, since there are so few. Try it with organic free-range chicken (got mine at whole foods, Rocky brand) and fresh rosemary (I have a plant). The chicken is super tender! I used Clos Du Bois Sauvignon Blanc with great results on the reduction, and as the table wine with dinner. Put red creamer potatoes in with the chicken and steamed fresh farmers market spinach on the side. Will keep making this excellent dish, Thanks!

I fixed this chicken dish for dinner tonight and it was just ok. I used boneless breasts, so that might have made a difference. The chicken was moist and the recipe was easy to make, but my husband and I both thought it rather bland. In hindsight, I would have served it with mashed potatoes or rice to be able to use more of the sauce. However, I don't think we will make it again.

Rating: 4
The comments about blandness bothered me so I mixed olive oil, salt, and pepper with the rosemary and stuffed it all under the skin. Then I salted and peppered the bottom of the chicken. I also increased the garlic. This is a wonderful dish for week nights. Easy, fast and delicious.

This is the best roast chicken!!! I'm usually skeptical of cooking times for chicken breast (a minute too long and it gets dry and stringy!) but the recipe is PERFECT. I used cooking spray instead of the oil for the garlic - delicious! I found the savory sauce perfect over white rice and served it with a nice salad and glazed carrots. Not only is this chicken juicy and delicious, its FAST AND EASY - working full-time, I wish every recipe were like this one!

The best thing I ever ate, much less cooked. The sauce is a must! I've done a half recipe for one serving, too. I like the yams and chard or spinach as the sides. So easy, even I can't screw up!

Garlic lovers delight. Works well with skinless, boneless breasts or tenders as well. I haven't tried the sauce yet. After roasting, I leave it on the stovetop, covered, on low heat to keep it warm until serving. Have served with garlic mashed potatoes, green beans, corn, fresh bread. Definitely a keeper!

Delish! My husband and I rarely eat chicken and we both thought this was great (and not just great for chicken). I roasted more than the 10 cloves (2 heads!) and we ate up every bit of it. The sauce didn't do anything for me, but I'm not uspet about the failure of the sauce as it only took an addition 2 or 3 minutes to make.

I've made this dish many times (it's a favorite of my mom's and my mom-in-law's!) It always turns out perfectly, although I have to increase the cooking time to 45 minutes because the chicken breasts I use are larger. For more flavor I sprinkle with season salt, cayenne pepper, garlic and onion powder. It ALWAYS gets rave reviews and I'm constantly giving out the recipe.

I tried this recipe out for a friend's birthday dinner. Since I'm a novice cook my husband and I tested it out before the 'real' night!

I have never been a big chicken breast fan because they are usually too dry when I have been out to dinner or tried making it at home. This recipe proved me wrong. It was delicious. The chicken breast was tender and full of flavor from the garlic, rosemary, olive oil and the wine sauce. My partner was pleasantly surprised. I will use this one again for the next dinner party now that it's tried and tested. Fantastic and easy to prepare too.

Very elegant autumn mid-week dinner. I served it with wedges of roastd sweet potato tossed with garlic, rosemary and melted butter and red chard sauteed in a little olive oil, butter and garlic with a splash of Chardonnay at the end. The deep green of the chard and orange of the sweet potato combined with the earthy rosemary scent evoked thoughts of colorful fall leaves underfoot. A definite keeper. Only change I made was to sprinkle extra chopped rosemary on top of chicken.

This quick and easy dish is absolutely superb! The chicken is moist and the garlic is almost candy. The chicken breasts here in Minnesota must be larger than average because I have to increase that 15 minute cooking time to 30 minutes for the chicken to be done. Also, if you can find jewel sweet potatoes, you do not need to butter them. I have passed this recipe along to a bunch of friends already!
