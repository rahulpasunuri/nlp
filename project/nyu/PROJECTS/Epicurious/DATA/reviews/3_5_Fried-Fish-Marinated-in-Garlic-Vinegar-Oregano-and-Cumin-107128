I had no fresh thyme or oregano and I had no flour, so I made this with garlic, dried oregano, bay leaf, and cumin only, and fried it in olive oil after dredging in white corn meal. After several hours of marinating in the fridge, and fried quite a bit longer than suggested in the recipe, the thick chunks of grouper I used were absolutely delicious: crunchy and flavorful. I will make this again.

I am suprised by the reviews that say the fish did not hold the marinade. I have been fixing this recipe for years and love it. I suggest using good quality spices, Penzey's for the cumin. I sometimes use dried spices if fresh is not available, also very good. Some may prefer the dried spice, a bit more punch of flavor if you don't have good quality fresh. Fries well in olive oil.

Very tasty and a nice change of pace from battered or fried fish, did add salt to the marinade and afterward and fried it with rice flour since aim gluten free, will make again We used frozen cod loin. Minimal effort, good flavor, something different

I have no idea why some found this recipe to be not so great. I thought it was absolutely delicious. I used wild-caught Alaskan Halibut (frozen and thawed in the refrigerator) and followed the recipe exactly - except I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt to the marinade. I used Sherry Vinegar for the wine vinegar and allowed the fish to marinate for 4 hours. The fish was full of flavor and had a delicate crispy crust. I fried it in the olive oil, using a cast iron skillet. Served at a tapas party and people RAVED about it. Totally worth the effort, which was pretty minimal.

Fish did not hold flavor of marinade well at all -- although the fillet of fish itself was perfect. Basically, it wasn't worth the small amount of trouble it was to make. I've never marinated fish before and this has turned me off to the idea. I'd rather cook the fish in with the flavor ingredients, as in Cooking Light's Grouper Veracruz (December 2002).

It really didn't hold in the flavors very well. The mix smelled great but seemed quite blan after the frying. However easy to make, may not be worth it.

The marinade was perfect for halibut, alowing the taste of the fish to come through while adding a wonderful Italian flavor. I served this with mushroom risotto, which turned out to be a great combination. I reccomend this highly.

I had halibut fresh from Alaska (never frozen). I regretted using it on this recipe. It would probably be OK for fish that you were trying to cover up the flavor on. The taste was OK, but I would not make it again.

This is an excellent way to prepare fresh fish! I have been searching for years for variations on pan-frying fish dredged in flour, and this is certainly the best I've come across. I tried it with both red snapper and rockcod, and it worked perfectly both times.

We spent 4 months in Seville and this dish takes me there in 15 minutes. It is to die for!

I have made this twice. Each time I used catfish. Forgot to marinade it the second time, still turned out good. My husband and I enjoyed will make it again.

This was an excellent recipe! I used x-lite olive oil for frying. I made it for a tapas party and everyone loved it. I follow reader ratings This had not been rated when I made it. Unfortunately after the one fork another reviewer gave some people might not want to consider making this. Please try it you will like it, over 25 people did.

My whole family was very disappointed in this dish. One family member said it tasted like dish detergent. I made it as part of a meal with several of the other dishes from the original article, and they were very good for the most part. This one looked attractive when finished, but had NO flavor, and the texture was chewy and mealy. I had to use grocery store frozen halibut, which probably didn't help, but there was no flavor evident from the marinade.

To be perfectly honest I hate frying--especially fish--but this was so tasty I will certainly make it again. Everyone loved it.
