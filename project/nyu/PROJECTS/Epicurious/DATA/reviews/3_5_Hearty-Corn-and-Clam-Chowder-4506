Where oh where did I go wrong? I followed the recipe and while it was certainly simple enough, the soup was bland and not "clammy" enough. A Chef with whom I work suggested that I use a bit of clam base next time, which I think I will try. Other things I may consider would be to reduce the amount of Thyme but one half teaspoon. I would also do the following: Use half creamed corn and half regular corn and saute the corn with the bacon to deepen the flavor. I would also add a bit of garlic and to give the soup some more body, add a bit of blonde roux. It was very thin which is ok, but adding the corn and clams at the last moment does not allow the flavors to meld. I will definitely try it again with some adjustments.

This was very nice. We enjoyed it much. I did make a couple of changes after reading some of the reviews. First I cooked the bacon until crisp. I added the bacon crumbles as garnish before serving. I was unable to find cream corn, so I took a can of corn, using my mini processor, processed the corn with a bit of milk. Lastly, I added lots of pepper and a little bit of cayenne. It turned out lovely and I would not hesitate to make this dish again.

I used fresh corn instead of creamed corn and put it at the same time as the rest of the vegetables. I would cook the bacon til it's crispy next time instead of just until it starts to render. My guests all cleaned their bowls, and I thought this was a really good chowder!

Okay. There are probably better recipes out there but this one served its purpose.

I wouldn't make this if I were entertaining, but it's definately good enough for a week night dinner. I followed the recipe exactly and found it very simple and quick to prepare. Unless you like clams that have the texture of hard rubber, don't bother saving the leftovers.

This is a great chowder! I brought it to a clambake in October for a college get together and everyone raved about it. They all wanted the recipe.Definitely a keeper!

This is a great chowder. I used 2 cans of whole baby clams, and used the juice plus chicken broth instead of the 1 cup of clam juice. I also added another can of creamed corn. Hubby used to hate clam chowder, but askes for this.

I made this dish when it first appeared in Bon Appetit and was surprised with the outcome. The Thyme adds a new dramatic twist to this chowder. Better yet, leave enough for the following day and reheat, this is one leftover to look forward to!

We enjoyed this Chowder. I followed other reviews & chopped the veggies small. Next time I'll cut the potatoes smaller, too. I used whole milk. After the potatoes cooked about 20 mins., I added another cup of milk as I thought there were more veggies then broth. It was perfect. The color & sweetness of the corn was wonderful, too. The bacon is a must! I'll make it again & again. This was EASY.

I don't know what I did wrong, but we didn't like this recipe at all. We found there were far too many vegetables for the amount of liquid. I made it exactly as the recipe stated (except added half-and-half instead of milk) and it was awful. BLAND. Way too chunky. Ended up adding another cup of half-and-half and still had to add milk on top of that. Salt, pepper and a good amount of hot sauce to give it some zip. This is the only recipe I've made in the last little while from this site that I wouldn't make again. I'm still looking for a good clam chowder recipe.

This chowder is fantastic! I substituted a large red bell pepper for the carrot and also added tabasco. I strongly recommend the bacon - - it really gives it a nice flavor. And, I too used half and half. If it seems too think add a little cornstarch/water mix to thicken it up a bit. Delicious soup!

A great & easy recipe. Doubled this recipe for a dinner party & was a big hit. Followed other reviewers advice, used 3/4 cream & 1/4 milk. Also used frozen corn because that's all I had. What little we had left over was even better then next day!

This chowder was terrific. I substituted half and half for the milk and used frozen corn. I'll make this recipe again.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was very good....I didnt have clam juice...I used homemade chicken stock in place of it...also since I used just regular canned corn instead of creamed I used about a tablespoon or so of light karo syrup and it added the perfect balance of sweetness...I also added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it a bit...Oh and insted of milk...I used heavy cream..this is a keeper

This chowder was very simple to prepare and everyone in my family enjoyed it very much. I used 1 3/4 cups half-and-half instead of milk, and two fresh ears of corn in place of the cream corn. I thought the thyme could be reduced by half or so.

This was an excellent chowder and very easy to make. I substituted corn I grilled on the grill and sliced off the cob in place of the creamed corn. I also used heavy cream instead of milk.

This is a great comfort food dish for the winter, and fairly easy to make when all the chopping is done. I used three cans of chopped clams, half and half instead of milk, and plain canned corn instead of creamed. Good stuff.

Easy and delicious. A family favorite.

This was an excellent chowder. Next time I would use plain corn, not creamed. It made it a little too sweet.

Delicious! This was a great success and perfect hearty food for the unexpected snow we've had recently. Per an earlier reviewer, I doubled the amount of clams and used half milk, half cream. Big hit in our house, and as delivered to a family with a new baby. We'll make this again.

This was a good, but not great chowder. Being from New England, my family's standards are pretty high, but the chowder was gone by noontime of day two. If I made this again, I would double the amount of clams, and use more cream than milk. Overall, very easy to make and good to eat.

I Bought extra Thick Bacon, and included a couple of ham hocks. I also used half milk and half heavy cream. The soup is incredible! Try making some french loaves and serving it in a bread bowl!
