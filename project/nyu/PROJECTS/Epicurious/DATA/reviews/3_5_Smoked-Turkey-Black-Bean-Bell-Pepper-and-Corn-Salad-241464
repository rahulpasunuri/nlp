Featured this recipe at a luncheon and it turned out to be the most sought after recipe there. Have to admit did not use Arugula. I have also used this salad dressing as a marinade for tougher cuts of meat making a perfect summer fare from the grill.

PERFECT weeknight dinner. It's easy and adaptable, which is perfect for when you need to use up odds and ends.

after reading the reviews I pulled way back on the mint, but somehow the garlic fully overwhelmed everything. A tablespoon was WAY too much. Hubby couldn't even eat it. I'd set some aside without the dressing, and he ended up eating that with parmesian and ranch dressing. Oh, and it was over spring greens instead of arugula. I would make it again, but not the dressing as written.

Yes, the corn should be raw. It adds a sweet crunch. I also like to cut back on the mint, it can be a little overpowering.

Not a review, but a question.. Is the corn really supposed to be fresh, sliced off a cob, uncooked? I'll probably try this next weekend, it sounds really good and great for taking to work for lunch. But I've never made anything with raw corn before.

Lovely salad! A great way to get some summer flavour in the midst of February. I left out the turkey but otherwise made it as written here - maybe with less mint. + I added some cilantro and curry leaves as well. Almost backed out of the dressing but glad I didn't - the flavours really play off one another. I'll make this again for sure!

I loved the salad, but I did not really care for the mint in the dressing. I found it overpowering. Maybe it would be better with another fresh herb or if the mint was reduced.

I actually loved the dressing. This salad is super tasty as it is. It was great the next day as leftover as well.

The dressing was so-so - not awful. Otherwise it was a great dish. I added avocado, but too bad I forgot the jalepeno - that would have been yummy.

I thoutht the dressing was awful. I ended up warming the leftovers and serving them over rice the next day for lunch.

I made this for lunch during a weekend get-away with friends and all guests raved at how delicious this recipe was. You could add avocado to it as well.

This is wonderful and very filling. I like adding chopped Jalapenos to mine.
