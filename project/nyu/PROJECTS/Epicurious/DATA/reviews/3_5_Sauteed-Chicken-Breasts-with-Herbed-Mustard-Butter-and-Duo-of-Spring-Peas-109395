This is a great spring meal. I was lucky to have fresh English peas and sugar snap peas from farmer's market for the dish. It is definitely for taragon lovers. I will definitely make this again.

This was fantastic. I used less butter but otherwise made the recipe as indicated. You must like tarragon because the flavor is strong in this dish. I loved it, so fresh and Spring-y. It tastes like a gourmet, sophisticated meal even though it is easy to make. This is not a good leftovers or next-day meal because of all the butter; it gets soggy overnight. So have everyone eat it all up right away. Shouldn't be a problem!

So refreshingly different! Easy, springtime or anytime, the combination of the chicken and tarragon butter was equisite. Will make this a keeper!

This was a very easy and tasty dish. Pretty good as a leftover. I served it over rice which soaked up the sauce!

My first dish from this website! It was delicious! The tarragon was anise-like but oh, so good! Especially with the herbed mustard butter. This is a fun and easy dish to make!

I'm not much of a cook, but found this very quick, easy and delicious. The terragon was a nice flavoring; I added a bit more dijon mustard than called for and it came out nicely. Served with the glazed baby carrots with balsamic vinegar. A superb combination!

Flavor was great and this dish is very easy to prepare. I did not have any dried tarragon, so used fresh for entire recipe and served it with spaghetti squash.

Not to crazy about the tarragon spread out over the dish. Did not go well with Sav Blanc. Maybe skip the tarragon for mint or thyme in the peas. A Sancerre or Chablis might go better due to the french influences of this dish. NZ S Blanc is way too overboard on the citrus element and takes away from the elegant flavors in the dish.

Outstanding recipe. This one has the WOW factor built right in. The flavors blend wonderfully together and the mustard is just right while hidden with the herbs and butter. Goes great with Wild Rice with fresh herbs.

This was an amazing chicken dinner!! Too bad there wasn't a photo because it's so "Springy" with the different shades of green. Mustard doesn't play as big a roll as the recipe name would suggest - but that's fine - the tarragon flavor is great! I've made the peas several times now as a side for other meals.
