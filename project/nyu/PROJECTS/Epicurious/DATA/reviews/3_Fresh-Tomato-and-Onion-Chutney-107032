This is a really good chutney to perk up chicken. Not the Major Grey variety of chutney, more like a creative salsa. I used green onions and skip soaking them in salt and seeded and deveined the jalapeno to reduce heat. I followed all the rest and really enjoyed the result. I'm sure the soaked onion is a winner in this too.
