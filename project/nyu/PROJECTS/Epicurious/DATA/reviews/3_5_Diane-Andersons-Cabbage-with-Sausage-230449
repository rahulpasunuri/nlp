I thought this was a really easy recipe to make - just some chopping, caramelizing the onions, then throwing everything into the pot. I thought I had ruined the dish when I left it simmering while I hosted a church meeting at my house. Halfway through the meeting I went to check on it and discovered that the bottom was all burnt and stuck to the pot. I turned it off and just left it covered, thinking that I could salvage the top (i.e. unburnt) part for our dinner. When I checked it an hour later, the moisture in the pot had loosened and caramelized the burnt part, which made for a rich deep flavor, that might not have been there except for my inattentiveness!

I did not rate this recipe because we made modifications and I didn't think that would be accurate. STILL, we used ground pork instead of kielbasa which should have made the recipe LESS salty. We could have misunderstood something but I am fairly sure that despite some minor modifications, something is too salty in this recipe for our taste. I would not attempt this recipe again.

I used this recipe as a starting point for what I had on hand - I know, not a "real" review. I used excellent quality free range pork sausage (can't get kielbasa where I live) and browned separately. I browned the onion, added the cabbage and browned for a few minutes then put back the sausage with two apples cored and sliced into eighths. I used dry apple cider instead of beer (only had really dark stuff) and braised in the oven as I had it on for something else anyway. It turned out really well! Served with mashed potatoes. I would like to try beer but what kind? Also, I would like to add a little herb flavoring but what?

Found this recipe online during the winter when I was looking for a tasty, hearty meal on cold night. This recipe was perfect! My husband and I enjoyed it tremendously. This recipe went into "My Favorites".

This ended up tasting like vegetables soaked in beer, which could be good if that is what you are going for. I even added bacon and caraway seed to try to bring out some better flavors. I definitely would not waste a good Kielbasa with this recipe, it would be better boiled in water.

Dear Kalamazoo cook, given our current economic crisis in the US, this definitely fits good cheap eats. the beer definitely makes the dish (and I don't drink beer), with or without mustard. try it again with beer. its good provencal comfort food. i have made it several times over the last 3 years. my family requests it when they want "down home" food.

This was easy to make, and maybe has potential. I used chicken stock instead of beer. The veggies and sausage were very tender, and the dish is comforting to eat, but it didn't have much flavor, although the mustard helped. When I asked my boyfriend how many forks he would give it, he said "that depends on what kind of crisis your country is going through." On the other hand, he finished two servings, so take that for what it's worth. As for me, I probably wouldn't make this again - but maybe the beer is a key ingredient. Who knows?

Very good one-dish meal. Rustic and hearty.

So easy. I substituted Tofurkey's veggie kielbasa for the real deal. Not that spectacular, but so easy that I would probably make it again.

Great taste, EASY, just needed a good hearty loaf of bread to soak up the juice.

It was easy and was okay. If I make it again, I'll use a pilsner rather than a lager and buy the keibasa from a Polish deli.

I made this recipe omitting the butter (used olive oil spray) and the sugar to comply with our low-carb lifestyle- it was still delicious! I would definitely make again.

Very Good and very very easy - more than what I expected from the ingredient list. Great for a weeknight supper! Would definitely make again!

I made this dish a few weeks ago because I had a bunch of cabbage on hand and I am not a fan of slaw. I am am member of a community organic farm and I never know from week to week what will be included in the share. Not knowing what to expect, I made it. It was fabulous!! I used turkey kielbasa--significantly lower in fat--with no loss of flavor. It was fabulous. I am making it again tonight! It appealed to my meat and potatoes husband and to my need for unique flavor. I agree with the other reviewers, the dish has significantly more flavor than would be expected by perusing the ingredient list. YUM!!

My compliments to Diane's grandmother. This was excellent, and easy. I didn't feel the need to change anything. The mustard was a nice addition. Don't toss the liquid--sop it up with some crusty bread. Way to go Granny!
