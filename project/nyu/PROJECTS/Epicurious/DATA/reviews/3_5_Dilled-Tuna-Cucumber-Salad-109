This recipe was terrible! I added an extra tablespoon of low-fat mayo and it was still as dry as a bone. Also, I like dill but this was overkill! Way to much dill. Will NOT make this again. :(

Forgot to mention: really squeezing all moisture from the tunafish, by hand, is another key.

We used this as pita stuffing, and really loved it. I cut and salted the cukes, then laid them out on a papertowel, before I prepped the rest. This eliminated any wateriness in the finished product!

Didn't think much of this. It's relatively healthy and has protein, but not really a leg up on any other reduced mayo tuna. I won't make it again.

Watery, fishy and dilly--unless you really are trying to cut the fat, I do not recommend the nonfat yogurt. Might be fine to eat as soon as it's made but texture and flavor (not enough fat to carry the stronger flavors) will not hold up for the next day.

Definitely a keeper! Substituted soy yogurt and 2 tsp. dried dill; cut cucumber in half and chopped it tiny; and put it inside a pita. Yummy!!

I completely forgot about this recipe. (Obviously was searching for tuna salad.) This was a huge hit with family when I made it last summer. Followed the recipe. Fresh bakery buns & lettuce. Yum.

Simpy delicious and delicously simple! Have made this many times and it is always a treat either as a sandwich filling or a salad served atop mixed spring greens. As another reviewer suggested, I also add chopped hard cooked eggs and am generous with the dill. Bright, fresh flavours that elevate tuna salad well beyond the ordinary!

I prepared this the night before. I think that really enhanced the flavor. I added a pinch of salt. It was light, healthy, and very good. I am definitely changing my old recipe. I will make this over and over again.

I really loved this recipe, I served it in whole wheat pita bread with lettuce. It does get watery when it sits but just stir it up and don't make the sandwich until you are ready to eat it. (I took one for lunch the next day-too soggy!) Delicious anyway, will make again.

I used a whole-grain mustard which gave it a very nice bite. So glad to find use for the left-over dill in my fridge! I always end up with ten times more than I need. From now on, I'll turn to this recipe to use it up...

Absolutely Awesome. Best tuna salad ever! I made it exactly as recipe stated and it was perfect.

This is very much like the Garbanzo-Tuna Salad on this site, with the light mayo, yogurt and Dijon. I think you'll find it's not the cuke that makes it watery. The yogurt should be drained. Try using avocado on top, and using an olive spread on the other slice. DELICIOUS!!

Great idea. Since I did not have green onions or dill, I subsituted it with chives and parsely. Make sure to seed the cucumbers, if not it gets to watery. I also added the half of Granny Smith Apple finely diced to it. Due to not having mayo, I needed the kick, the apple did the trick.

This had no flavor until the next day and then I could see why everyone was raving. If you like this one try the "Halibut Salad Sandwich" on this site it's really incredible and you can substitute canned tuna too.

A very good tuna salad - good on bread or on lettuce. It was a hit.

Wow! Tastes even better than regular tuna salad but without the fat! This was my first dish since my switch to healthy eating and it was definately encouraging. I can look forward to finding foods that are exciting and delicious....and HEALTHY! The only thing I would change about this recipe is using pita bread rather than whole grain toast. It was a pretty messy sandwich due to the fact that it was spilling out over the bread.

It makes an awesome sandwich on toasted whole wheat! I was looking for an easy way to make tuna that isn't high in fat/calories. The salad came out a tad bit too watery, probably from the cucumbers, so next time i think i'll cut down on the yogurt/mustard/mayo combo.

This did not even make it to a slice of bread. I ate the first batch right out of the bowl. Will make this again and again. The only variation I used was red onion and less yogurt. Fantastic - a great summer dish

This dish is so very easy to make, and it is delicious! I had this recipe in my "online" recipe notebook/cookbook, and I really wish that I had tried it sooner. It's perfect for a quick weekend meal. I used a whole cucumber with it, but then again, I really like cucumbers.

This makes a lovely sandwich filling I think made even better with the addition of 2 chopped hard cooked eggs. Made with wholegrain bread with flax and it was a delicious variation of good old standby tuna sandwiches. So fresh tasting.

A great find. Very simple, and, w/ the fresh dill and cucumber, tastes light and fresh.

this is now my favorite tuna recipe because it is so simple and flavorful! i didnt have yogurt, but it was still good without it.

What a wonderfully delicious salad. The cucumber, dill and dijon really kicked up the tuna! It disappeared very quickly!!!!

This is very good tuna salad. Skipped the yogurt and just used extra mayo instead. Really liked the dijon in the salad. Served mine on a bed of greens with hard boiled eggs and tomatoes and olives. Also good in sandwiches.

This is our new favorite tuna recipe! Fast, easy and great for lunch over an avocado.

This is a great tuna salad and well worth the extra trouble (as opposed to just throwing together mayo, relish and tuna). I did go a little heavier on the dill and dijon because I like a bit more bite, but the recipe would still be great as written.
