This pie is great! The crust has a little bit of saltiness and is very crisp, almost like a shortbread cookie. The filling is very dark and rich, but you can vary the bitterness with what kind of chocolate you use. The combination of the crust and filling creates a great flavor balance. I did not make the praline though. However, this is an easy recipe and definitely going to be a staple.

A friend who's favorite dessert is chocolate cream pie said this was the best one he had tasted EVER. It is a very pretty dessert, and though it requires several steps, each step is surprisingly easy. Definitely take the time to make the shortbread crust - the salt/chocolate combo really makes it. Although I buttered my pan well, it still stuck a bit; perhaps next time I'll try a baking spray. The recipe makes lots of praline, which is a delicious bonus! I used cocoa nibs, but they were hard to find and expensive. They taste like bitter chocolate - - I think ground chocolate covered espresso beans would be a fine substitute.

Love, love, loved this. It will be in my regular rotation from now on. I also made a raspberry/Kahlua sauce to serve with it. Overall- it's an easy recipe that tastes anything but simple.

Crust was delicious--very much like a shortbread. I sprayed the pie plate with a bit of oil, and had no problem with the crust sticking. Could not find cocoa nibs, so I substituted chopped chocolate-covered espresso beans. They were a delicious substitute! Makes a lot of praline, so I set it out for guests to eat as a candy brittle. Chocolate pudding was delicious, hard to keep from digging in with my spoon! Overall, a great pie, and a delicious addition to my 4th of July lineup!

Made for a dinner party to rave reviews. I might pare back on salt in both crust and praline next time I make it.

This is excellent when made exactly according to the recipe. If you skipped the crust, you really missed out. I had no problems with the crust sticking or breaking.

Husband-eaten, husband-approved! "This dessert is perfect!" To those who substituted a regular pie crust (even home-made), you are doing this recipe a disservice -- the crust in the recipe is basically shortbread in pie crust form, and that teaspoon of salt called for makes a wonderful contrast with the extra sweetness of the praline. Yes, it is rather a bear to slice, but if you butter the pie dish I cannot imagine it sticking. Rather than serving the whipped cream as a garnish, I added a bit of gelatin (3/4 tsp : 1.5 Tb water) to stiffen it up and covered the whole pie, thus making this The World's Greatest Ever Chocolate Cream Pie. Roughly crushed the praline (confession: could not find nibs, so doubled pecans) and tossed a generous amount on each serving. OMG, this truly is to die for.

This is a rich and delicious chocolate pie. I used all organic ingredients, including organic dark chocolate bars for the chopped pieces. My butter was salted, and it turned out fine nonetheless. I was short on time and long on laziness, so I substituted Trader Joe's frozen pie crust and praline pecans for the crust and cocoa nib praline. Shortcutting those two steps made it a very quick and easy recipe for a potluck.

My praline burned - I think maybe 16 minutes would have been enough time.

I give this four forks because I used a differnt crust. I made a classic pie crust and blind-baked it. The filling was wonderful and the praline was even better! The praline would make a lovely holiday gift.

Solved the crust problem by spraying a little Pam in plate before pressing in crust. Also added Amarula to the whipping cream. It's a South African liquer that tastes like a caramel Bailey's. Wow, what a great contrast to the wonderful depth of chocolate in the pie.

This was delicious, it got rave reviews at a New Year's Eve party. Unfortunately, the crust stuck to the pie dish so badly that it was destroyed by the time anyone got their slice out. I'm sure this was due to something that I did wrong. Luckily, it was fabulously delicious and no one minded.

I changed up the recipe a bit. I have given up on making crust and use Safeway pre-made crust. Trust me no one knows the difference. I used semi-sweet chocolate instead of dark in the pie. I added cocoa powder to the whipped cream which was a hit. The Praline was very good. Guests were eating it as candy when the pie ran out. I did learn the difference between wax paper and parchment paper. If figured it out when I could't get the first batch to crack. The melted wax made them very bendy ooops. ( I was cooking 3 different types of pies @ once and had a blond monent.) A little wax never hurt anyone though. Pie was better on the 3rd day.

The pie was delicious however I didn't feel that the praline w/cocoa nibs added much to it. I have made the pie several times and the most succesful was when I didn't make the praline and substituted crushed peppermints and some peppermint whip-cream. It got rave reviews.

Overall delicious, however the crust technique was strange and very difficult to work with - tasted good (especially with the kosher saly) but looked terrible. Next time I'll keep the ingredients the same and use a classic technique for the crust.

I would say this was 3 1/2 forks. It was a big hit at a christmas get together and the cocoa nib praline was a hit on it's own as well. I didn't have any problems with the crust.

This pie was great! I made the pie 1 day ahead of serving and experienced none of the crust problems reported by the other reviewer. It was easy to make and delicious.

I made this pie for Christmas dinner. I was a bit worried about the crust since the recipe/technique seemed a bit odd. The filling came out just fine but the crust was hard as a rock and refused to come out of the pie dish in one piece. If I make this dessert again, I'd use a standard rolled pie crust, blind-baked and then do the rest of the recipe as written. Or, I might use a cookie crust instead, made from vanilla cookie crumbles or Oreos. Note that the praline pieces can be sharp and shouldn't be served if you have young kids trying to eat the dessert.
