@by A Cook: Your definitions are inaccurate. Almond paste is made from ground almonds, water and sugar (in Britain it includes egg white as well) and is cooked and cooled. Marzipan has a higher ratio of sugar to almonds than does almond paste, though there is no strict definition of when the mixture becomes marzipan as opposed to almond paste. There is no sugarless almond paste; the closest equivalent would be almond butter. Commercial almond paste/manufacturers have access to bitter almonds, which are more fragrant and floral than the almonds available to the home cook. A bit of almond extract can mimic the quality of almond paste made with bitter almonds, but in my experience it is not quite as delicious and it is often difficult to match the smooth texture of the commercial product.

I followed the recipe exactly and I ended up with about 40 tea cakes, and one large Braeburn apple was actually enough to cover the top of each tea cake with about 4 small cubes. The almond and apricot flavors are wonderful together and I wouldn't add any other flavors to it. These have a great texture and are not too sweet. I only dusted a portion of them with confectioner's sugar, a few I drizzled with a vanilla glaze, and the rest I left plain. I actually prefer the plain, sugarless ones.

@eeblet - I challenge you to actually do some research to back up your claim; pure marzipan is sugarless almond paste, sometimes referred to as almond meal, which actually makes it the same thing.

Almond paste and marzipan are completely different ingredients. I don't think I'll be trying this!

this was very tasty, but next time i would improve it by adding more flavor and texture; such as apples, maybe some walnuts, and a little dash of nutmeg.
