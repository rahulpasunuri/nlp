This was a great dish - it was so simple to make. This would make a great side dish to a roast chicken. We served it as a main dish, and it was very satisfying. I did wait until the last 10 minutes of roasting to add the fresh basil, that way it wouldn't lose it's punch by being in the oven so long.

This was okay but nothing great. It was easy enough to throw together but I wouldn't bother making it again.

Good but not great recipe. Did not try it with cheese. Will give it a second try.

Tried this recipe "cold turkey" for a 4th of July get together and it was very popular.

Don't be fooled by the simplicity! It's really a wonderful, good blend of veggies. The key is the celery, which truly is underrated for adding flavor to a dish. The beauty of it is most of these veggies are always around the house. The first time I made it, I thought, "This is it?" but it turned out great. Even without cheese on top, it's tasty.
