I made this specifically for the cilantro pesto. Amazing! Eating it right now over quinoa and grated raw veggies. A great alternative to traditional pesto.

This is SO good. I made it this evening, and both my husband and I thought it was superb. Great flavor in the coriander vinaigrette!!! I did not have white balsamic so used white wine vinegar + a pinch of sugar. The beets are lovely, pesto very nice. Everything just comes together well. It's super flavorful and tastes healthy and light. Served it with fish tacos and Qupe chard/viognier. Great combo.

Note: I am reviewing the pesto only... AMAZING! DELICIOUS! DIVINE! And that's just doing a taste test. I can't wait to actually apply it to other foods. What an insult to declare it a condiment; rather like calling caviar Power Bait.

Very good. Great combination of flavors. A good bit of work. Used extra pesto for pasta.

I borrowed this cilantro pesto recipe to add to sweet potato, kale, and black bean burritos (my own recipe) and it was fantastic! A great "salsa" for tortilla chips as well.

This is my new FAVORITE recipe! I have fed this to my husband so much that he say's he is turning RED. - A note about that- Beets do turn your urine red if you eat alot of them, nothing to be alarmed about! The pesto is so good that I have found many other things to serve it with! My daughter put it on her Turkey on Thanksgiving!

I only made the beets (chiogga and golden) and roasted them, then drizzled with the pesto for a great colorful side dish. I didn't have any mint handy and used a thai bird chili instead of the jalapeno (one very small) which gave it a nice peppery flavor. Great versatile recipe - next time I'll try the whole salad.

I made this a couple of times and really liked it. I served it for a large dinner party (17 people total) with a pacific rim theme. The somewhat bland dressing balanced the spicy flavors of the lamb w/ Chu Chee sauce and Lemongrass Chili Risotto. Everyone raved about the food and took generous helpings of the salad. I think this recipe does need the spicy main course, otherwise more vinegar would be needed.

I thought the vinaigrette was a litle lacking. Followed exactly. Garlic couldve been in longer and my family found that they were adding a small dash more of the white balsamic. I think I still prefer regular balsamic to white when dealing with beets. Many better recipes out there for beets,

The cilantro pesto is especially good and goes great with pasta

This was very good. You do end up with too much pesto, but for me that's never a bad thing. I found the pesto too salty for my taste, If I make this again I'll start with half the amount and add to taste. Also I managed to find the 'white balsamic' but think any sweet white vinegar could be substituted without much difference. The coriander dressing is great.

I've never liked beets, but this changed my mind to baby golden beets! Loved them! Did this recipe for a dinner party, my guests were very impressed, except that the coriander dressing wasn't too exciting, would have liked something more fruity; plus you ended up with way too much pesto. Well, I used it up as a sauce on meats and tossed it with pasta.

This was a very good salad- time consuming but impressive and a great combination of flavors.The recipe makes a lot of pesto. I used some of the extra pesto and made a delicious hummus .

This is without a doubt THE best salad I have ever made. Made it for the first course of Christmas Eve dinner - people would have been happy just with this!
