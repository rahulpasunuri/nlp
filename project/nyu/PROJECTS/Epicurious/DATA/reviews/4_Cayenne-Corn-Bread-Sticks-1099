Didn't feel like dragging the cast iron skillet out of the cabinet, so I just baked this in a 9" square and it turned out great. Baked it a couple extra minutes to account for the greater thickness in the middle and it worked really well. My husband ate the first piece of this out of the warm pan and his eyes popped. He loved it so it's a keeper.

Very easy and very yummy! Made exactly as written (with the exception of baking in a triangular-portioned cast iron skillet) and turned out great! It was very well-received. I might try again with other reviewers suggestions of pepper jack cheese or habaneros just for fun! But this was good - light heat that you noticed but didn't overwhelm. Will definitely make again!

This is excellent cornbread. I also made it using milk and vinegar, since I don't keep buttermilk on hand. I did it in a cast iron skillet. It was delightful. I will definitely make it again soon.

I used a cast iron frying pan instead of a stick pan. Delicious, and so easy. Will make again.

Great cornbread recipe! I had to make a couple of changes - used whole milk plus a little vinegar because I didn't have buttermilk, I added a couple of handfuls of canned corn, and cooked it in a skillet at 425 for 18 mintues. The corn added a nice texture & flavor, so I will add that plus the aforementioned pepperjack next time as well.

I LOVED these and all my guests did as well....and the cheese kept it nice and moist without imparting a real cheesy flavor. I made these with beans and ribs. Next time (as suggested by another reviewer) I might try nixing the cayenne and trying pepper jack instead of the cheddar!

I've amde this a couple of different ways and both tunred out great. First, I made the recipe as written; The second time, I cut the cayenne, and traded out the cheddar cheese for pepper jack. I made it in my cast iron skillet. It got rave reviews at my Cinco de Mayo dinner party. Even my two year old loved the leftovers. Great flavor/texture on this. Please try it.

Hot! Hot! Hot! (spicy as well...) Super Bowl Party contribution - we made these into mini muffins. The spicy taste from a substitution made this the perfect dish. (2 whole habanero peppers chopped in the food processor. The peppers had been frozen since summer. Removed the stem, not the seeds). The muffins were browning in the paper cases (425 for 10 minutes) so we reduced the oven temp to 350 for 12-15 minutes. Used a 2" heart shaped pan for the remaining 12 muffins to add to the presentation. Interestingly enough this final batch turned out the best in terms of rise, consistency and size for the "surprise" spice.

I made these in mini muffin tins. I only thinned the batter to normal cornbread consistency-- pretty thick-- and they baked for about 10 minutes. The flavorings were surprisingly subtle. They have a noticeable cheddar aftertaste, but not much cayenne bite. I think I would increase the amount of pepper next time. I served these alongside the sour cream and scallion corn muffins, also from this website, which got such rave reviews from my guests that I think these yummy little muffins went largely unnoticed. A note on preparation: they mean it when they say that the buttermilk should be at room temperature! Mine was still cool and my melted butter hardened instantly when I added it. I had to stick the mixture in the microwave to melt the butter again... fortunately I hadn't added the eggs yet.

I added some finely chopped green and red peppers and a hot pepper to give it some colour. They turned out marvelously! Definitely a keeper!
