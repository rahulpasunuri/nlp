Having just returned from a trip to Greece and Turkey where I had fabulous honey yogurt ice cream, I thought I would try this recipe. It is fabulous and so reminiscent of what I had in Greece. I think when I make it again I will leave the figs whole so all the seeds do not come out into the sauce. I removed the peel and cinnamon and cloves before serving.

For all the effort it wasn't worth it. (& I didn't even make the creme, used vanilla ice cream instead.) We ate it all, but it had wasn't great. And I love figs!

My personal version of this recipe (much easier!) -- grill fresh figs for a few minutes -- then top with goat cheese blended with honey and lemon zest ... what ever else you might like. Not quite the same flavor, but a great weeknight, healthy dessert -- and no reason you couldn't make for company -- it looks gorgeous too.

My husband really liked this dish, but I didn't care for it too much. The honey creams were lovely on their own, but the sauce was definitely too sweet, and I even reduced the sugar called for in the recipe. I think this sauce would be great over a nice dense tea bread in the winter. As my husband said, with all the mulling spices, it smells "Yule-y".

I'm allergic to figs; can anybody suggest substitutions? Thanks.

You can use half-fat creme fraiche and/or low-fat greek yogurt to make this recipe lower fat.

Cool-whip or Reddi-whip definitely won't work but fat-free half and half might.

I have to modify recipes to reduce fat. Can anyone tell me if a low-calorie substitute for the whipping cream would work? I mean something like Cool Whip or Reddi-Whip? Thanks.

I made this dish for a greek-themed dinner party. It was very easy to make. I did the sauce 2 days in advance and the yogurt one day in advance. I was nervous since I had not made anything like this before. It all came together perfectly and was loved by the guests. The recipe does not say to remove the orange peel, cloves or cinnamon stick from the sauce, so I just spooned the sauce and figs from the bowl, hopefully leaving the other things behind. I did manage to plate up one clove and it made for a surprising bite. These flavors remind one of the holidays and would be a very special treat for a Christmas or Thanksgiving meal.
