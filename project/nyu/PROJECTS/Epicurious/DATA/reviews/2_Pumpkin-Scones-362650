If you want pumpkin scones and are too nervous to try this recipe given the shaky reviews... so was I. I had great results with the recipe from a blogger who posted a recipe supposedly for Starbucks pumpkin scones-- and this review is for that recipe. Crazy but hopefully helpful. I hate McStarbucks because I'm a snob (wink) but these turned out very well and the photos the blogger provides of the (easy and beautiful!) scone formation were very helpful. These are sweet and the texture is good. I added pecans, flax seed and wheat germ because I'm a texture girl. I hope this helps! Here's that blog: ******* http://www.recipegirl.com/2011/10/27/starbucks-pumpkin-scones/ ********

I'm a professional chef and and avid home-baker of scones... I hope I can help untangle some of the problems with this recipe. I suspect the erroneous quantities came from the fact that commercial bakeries make very large batches, so the cafe's recipe likely calls for cups of ginger and tablespoons of vanilla. At home, that's nuts. If you want a LESS-CAKEY crumb, you need more sugar. Up it to 3/4 c-- sugar caramelizes as it bakes, somewhat, and less sugar means a more cakey consistency. Bakers have noted already that it's way too much liquid for a scone with so much pumpkin, but it's also a very high quantity of butter that causes excess spreading in the oven (as the butter melts). Try a stick of butter and 1/3 c. of buttermilk-- or better, yogurt-- and only a teaspoon of vanilla. I hope this helps. I rely on good reviews too!

Even after adjusting measurements per others' comments, the consistency was more like bread and not a scone.

I used this recipe as a base to make something a bit different. The scones were delicious, but more cake-like than scone like. It was what I was looking for and it worked. I can't really say what the original recipe is like but as a base recipe it worked with the following changes: I added 1/2 cup oats I substituted one of the cups of flour with cake flour I used 1/4 t. ginger instead of a 1/4 cup I omitted the cinnamon I used 3/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup yogurt, instead of buttermilk I added 1 T. flax seed meal I used 1 cup roasted butternut squash instead of pumpkin I skipped the glaze entirely.

I am giving this recipe 3 stars because, once modified, it is delicious, and b/c Alice's Teacup was one of my favorites when I lived in NY. I never had a bad scone there. I altered the recipe as follows: I increased the sugar to 1/2 c, and because I prefer my scones sweet, would probably increase it more if I were to omit the sauce. But with the sauce, 1/2 c of sugar was perfect. As other reviewers suggested, I used 1 tsp each of ginger and cinnamon. I'll probably up that to 1 & 1/2 tsp each next time. I used 1/2 c of buttermilk, which was perfect, and 2 & 1/2 tsp vanilla. I made the sauce exactly as directed, and it was DELICIOUS, but it made way to much. I recommend cutting the sauce recipe in half.

I hope they correct the spice quantity on this. I've shared the reader-modified recipe with lots of friends and it's been a great success for everyone. I substitute 1/4 yogurt for the buttermilk and use butternut squash instead of pumpkin. This also addresses the consistency problem. I also just blob these onto a cookie sheet covered with parchment and it's much quicker and fluffier. I have done many substitutions using this recipe as a base. You can sub in anything for the pumpkin really. I've used this to make savory scones for my picky toddler - omitting spices & sugar and adding lentils, quinoa and carrots - in place of the pumpkin. It comes out delicious and grownup guests eat them too!

I am so happy to know that a lot of other people had trouble with this recipe. I thought these looked so good, but they were tasteless, except for the caramel sauce. I followed the recipe to the letter and they were too wet to roll out, I did use all of the spice and they still were tasteless.

I just made this in anticipation of a tea party for next weekend. I used the reviewer suggestion of 1/4 cup buttermilk (I substituted milk/yoghurt), used a tspn of ginger and cinnamon and they came out wonderfully. I believe a scone is not meant to be overly sweet and this is not, a nice light texture...and we thought no need for a glaze. My very picky daughter age 4..."yeah I love this". We'll be preparing this for her tea party/birthday next weekend!

I have not made this recipe, but have the Alice's Tea Cup Cookbook and this is the exact same recipe (curious quantities and all) that appears in the book. So epicurious is not at fault here. I'm happy to have these reviews as I'll be sure to make note of them in the book so I don't spend time making these. Hope this helps.

This recipe is not "Okay" as 1 fork indicates. I am really furious. I always read reviews before making a new recipe...except this time, of course, because I emailed the recipe to myself. I just wasted a bunch of ingredients. The site should have fixed the recipe, since there is clearly an error. And frankly, I feel like the company supplying the recipe purposely gave a bad recipe so their product wouldn't be replicated. Maybe their scones are really good, but I'll never know because they aren't getting any business from me.

Since the spice is obviously an error and several people have pointed it out why hadsn't it been changed? I am an inexperienced baker. I follow instructions to the letter. So this recipie sucked and made me waste about $10 worth of groceries. FAIL!

I was alarmed by how much spice was called for in this recipe (I'm guessing a typo), so I read through some of the other reviews, and I'm glad I did! I compared the solid-to-liquid ratio to another of my favorite scone recipes, and as a result decided to greatly reduce the amount of buttermilk used. Here are the amended quantities that I used for this recipe: 1 tsp. ginger 1 tsp. cinnamon 1/4 cup buttermilk (or, substitute skim milk and yoghurt for 1/4 c. total) 2 tsp. vanilla extract. I skipped the glaze, feeling it was unnecessary. I also reduced the oven heat to 400d. The scones came out great, with a delicately delicious flavor and great texture.

Tried his recipe tonight... I'm not sure that I would call them scones as much as cakey-cookies. The pumpkin was kind of lacking in flavor and nothing really stood out. It wasn't a bad taste, but it certainly wasn't anything I'd make again. Without the sauce, I don't think it would've had much flavor at all. From the start the amount of liquid seemed like too much for scones... they still came out edible, but I think I'll look for a different recipe next time.

I'm not an inexperienced baker and I've made tons of scones in my day. My British aunt taught me to make cream scones as a child. I followed this recipe to the letter, though I was suspicious of the amount of liquid listed. I went ahead with the recipe because my family had a really fantastic breakfast at Alice's Tea Cup the last time we were in New York. I highly recommend a visit the next time you're in NYC. It's a great place. For this reason, I am sad to give the recipe only two forks. The dough was extremely wet (1-1/4 cups buttermilk + pumpkin + vanilla is a lot of liquid for a single batch of scones). The dough was AT LEAST if not MORE wet than an average muffin recipe. The flavor was good and the glaze tasty, but everyone who ate these said they were cake-like in texture & lacked the moist-yet-flaky-crisp balance that scones should have. Also, it would have been impossible to roll these out per the instructions, because the dough was as wet as oatmeal. I had to spoon them out into sopping blobs onto the pan, and boy, did they spread into one another in the oven. The flavors of spice and pumpkin were enjoyed by all, though please DON'T follow the recipe and put 1/4 cup of cinnamon and ginger in these as the recipe mistakenly states! 1 teaspoon is perfect. The glaze was buttery and sweet though some in my crew did not like the addition of the lemon in the glaze; some found it cloying. The glaze was very thin, dark, and translucent. I was thinking it would have more body and would become dry to the touch, but we had to eat these with a fork because the glaze was wet like maple syrup. Maybe if I'd left them for an hour, the glaze would have dried? But then the scones would have been stone cold. We had already waited the required 20 minutes until these cooled sufficiently to glaze. All in all, yummy taste, but on the basis of texture, my family had one thing to say, "They ought to be called SCUFFINS!"

Obviously there are issues with the amount of cinnamon and ginger in the recipe. I added 1/2 teaspoon of each and also reduced the vanilla to one tablespoon. The dough was very sticky, so I dropped the dough onto the pans instead of cutting them out. The pumpkin flavor is very mild.

I haven't made this either. In response to lafinnegan, one of the reviewers of this book on Amazon made the recipe from the book (also with the 1/4 cup each spice) and was not pleased with the results. She called Alice's Tea Cup and found that they use 1 teaspoon of each.

I can't really rate this recipe, as I haven't yet made this...but that is because I have a difficult time believing this recipe, as it calls for 1/4 CUP ground ginger 1/4 CUP ground cinnamon I'm guessing these should both be teaspoon?
