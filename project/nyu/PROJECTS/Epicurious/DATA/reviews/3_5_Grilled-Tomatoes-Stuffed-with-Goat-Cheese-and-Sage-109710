Awesome side dish. I used tomatoes on the vine. I let the tomatoes drain upside-down on a paper towel for around 10 minutes before stuffing. Otherwise followed the recipe except I baked them in a 375 degree oven for around 20 minutes, instead of grilling. Be sure to salt & pepper the tomatoes before you stuff them. Yes, it is watery. Yes, it is gooey. Yes, the flavors are mild. But this is a side dish -- it's not supposed to steal the show.

These were really nice. I used basil instead of sage. They are really good with a piece of crusty garlic toast to cut the richness of the goat cheese.

I'm fairly certain this was one of the best things I've eaten all month. Simplicity at its finest! Will definitely make these again soon.

An excellent way to serve tomatoes when you have an abundance of them! Simple to prepare and very tasty. One guest refused to leave until I gave her the (very easy) recipe. I have also done this with basil and parmesan (mixed with a little cream cheese).

Perhaps a few too many ingredients, which takes time and complicates flavor. I've made many stuffed tomatoes and these are okay, but time- consuming. I probably won't make again.

Excellent, easy and quick to prepare. It adds beautiful color to your plate. I cooked it for a crowd of twenty and everyone loved it. I used a vegetable pan purposely for vegetable grilling and it worked like a charm. Tomatoes were nestled into it and consequently easy to remove from the grill. Will definitely make again.

This is not only delicious, but it adds a nice splash of color to the plate. Definitely a summer keeper!

used tomatos on the vine hollowed out and grilled for 10 minutes, but stuck to the recipe otherwise. The fussy eater boyfriend loved this from the first bite, and coveted my share! Definitely a make again.

This was very delicious. Be sure to cover while grilling (so the cheese gets good and hot). The tomatoes will be delicate so take care removing from the grill. I used basil instead of sage and the white part of the green onion instead of shallot.

Actually, I have not prepared this recipe...yet. I would like to offer this as an appetizer, anyone have any thoughts on using cherry tomatoes? I think I'm going to try; I may be back later this weekend with a real review.

Was tasty, simple and pretty. Nice smooth, rich flavor with the goat cheese.

Absolutely wonderful. I followed the advice of others and seeded the tomatoes otherwise i followed the recipe as written. A great side dish time saver for summer company when you are grilling.

Delicious! After coring, I extracted all seeds and juice with my finger and put upside down on paper towels to further reduce wetness. I prepared cheese mixture ahead of time and refrigerated it, thus was able to put it together easily before grilling.My guest's and husband loved them.

We love this as a side dish to grilled meat and chicken. As a short cut I use flavored goat cheese, or just add herbs and seasoning that I think would go well with my menu. I also take out the tomato seeds and drain the tomato on a towel before stuffing with the cheese. A definite keeper especially during tomato season!

Great side dish to grilled roast pork loin. Will make again and try toasted pine nuts as others suggested.

Oh, dear. Not very nice at all. I drained the tomatoes like others suggested and followed the recipe as written. The ingredients are ones that I love, but the end result was soggy and bland. Not a keeper.

These were tasty and easy to make. Be sure you drain the tomatoes upside down on paper towels for about 30 minutes before you stuff the cheese in. Fresh sage is a must!

These were SOO YUMMY!!! I added some toasted pine nuts as others suggested. Served as side w/ GRILLED MONSTER PORK CHOPS WITH TOMATILLO AND GREEN APPLE SAUCE. Am going to try to get smaller tomatoes and serve as appetizers at next party.

I forgot to say, I also drained the tomatoes first.

My daughter is a veggie and she loved this dish, she says she would definately have this again.

I drained the tomatoes and added pine nuts as others have suggested but agree with Jenncarr from RI that these are not bad but not great either.

Excellent, I agree with others on draining the tomatoes a bit to cut down on excess juice

Way too quick and easy to be this good. I, too, had to use tomatoes on the vine, so I cut in half and removed some of the seeds and liquid. I also took the pine nut suggestion. Will make again... and again...

Not bad, but not that great. I'd leave the tomatoes on for ~10 minutes, or core more out of the middle.

This is a great recipe-different and very tasty. Easy too! The first time we made it, I think we could have left the tomato on the grill just a bit longer. Will make again tonight and try the pine nut suggestion. Sounds tasty!

This was an absolutely wonderful dish. I used tomatoes on the vine since unfortunately we don't have home grown tomatoes and I didn't have heirloom ones. Next time I believe I will try cutting the tomato accross and put the stuffing on top. I cooked the cut off tops with fresh sage dusting and garlic salt and we ate these also. Baked them in a 350 degree oven for about 20-25 mins since we weren't grilling tonight. I plan on trying the stuffing for cherry tomatoes topped with fried sage but unbaked as an appertizer.

Delicious! Savory, juicy, and creamy all in one. Use an heirloom tomato if at all possible.

These tomatoes have been a real hit this summer. I didn't have any sage so substituted fresh basil and thyme to be mixed into the cheese. They can be prepared ahead of time and just popped on the grill at the last minute - so easy on the cook!

These were easy and excellent! Instead of making them as a side dish and using the entire tomato, I cut slices of tomatoes and put the goat cheese mixture on top before grilling them. Then, I used them an appetizer. Yum!

We love this and to make it really quick and simple, buy flavored goat cheese. I have made the tomatoes in the oven too - when it started raining on my BBQ.

Delicious. I thought this amount of sage would be overpowering, but it was perfect. Made this twice and the second time used a blend of goat cheese and halloumi (Greek sheep cheese)which held up a little better against my husband's grilling technique.

We loved this recipe. I should have used fresh tomatoes from my garden, but they are still ripening. I will make it again as soon as they are ready. My husband pre-grilled the tomato and then we added the filling. Loved the fried sage!!

Absolutely delic and so quick and easy. Served along side of grilled pepper-crusted steak with worcestershire-glazed portobellos. (july 2004)Yum!!!

Fresh basil was used instead of sage, and I added 1/3 cup of toasted pine nuts (chopped). A mellon baller makes it easy to scoop out the top of the tomato, and leaving them upside down for 5 minutes lets some of the juice run out so they don't go to mush on the BBQ.

I made with the hard flavorless grocery store tomatoes and this recipe was good. In all fairness to the recipe, use fresh tomatoes when they are in season. My husband loved it.
