The peas were obstinate and did not respond to quick-soaking. I used canned white kidney beans instead. Then, more sherry and triple the mustard. That's better.

great flavor - i used canned black eyed peas and added them at the end with shredded rotisserie chicken. thickened it with a butter/flour paste. I also added cooked wild rice and used bacon instead of the oil. REALLY good. second time I made it I used canellini beans and used spicy chicken sausage instead of the bacon - super good again. I agree not so much broth - i used maybe 3 cups.

I'm not rating this because by the time I was done it really wasn't the same recipe. But it was good. First, no beans. Don't want to be around the hubby after beans... Didn't have any sherry - used white wine which I like better anyway. No heavy cream - used low fat sour cream. How could I be out of dijon mustard? Just threw in some dry. And used thighs, whole, rather than chopped up breats. Yum. Try it!

I made this with lima beans as did some others and really liked it...used marsala, a type of sherry. Will definitely make again. My kids also loved it.

Used lentils (green, orange, and french) (quick soak: covered in boiling water for 15-20 minutes) instead of peas, chicken thighs to go with the breasts, and herb de provence instead of thyme. Nice comfort food for a rainy fall night.

hmmm. only ok - had to keep the peas a little undercooked soas not to overcook the chicken. peas had been soaked overnight, they were well rehydrated so that wasn't why they weren't cooking - they didn't add any flavor - pretty boring

What a lovely light dinner for two on a Sunday evening in early spring, and an almost-one-dish meal at that. We served it over noodles and it made delightful lunch leftovers. No cooking tips, except that we used baby spinach; the recipe is flawless.

I really liked this. It's light and healthy. I love black eyed peas but this would also be good with other kinds of beans.

Great flavor, easy to make, and healthy. But not at all stewy. This had tons of liquid. I did not use the mushrooms, but I can't imagine they would absorb as much liquid as I had left over. However, the balance of other flavors and textures was excellent and I will make this again, with less broth.

This recipe is a family favorite. I have also made a variation using pork tenderloin instead of chicken, and lima beans instead of black-eyed peas. Delicious comfort food that is perfect for company.

We make this dish frequently and love it. I think lima beans or cannellini beans would be better substitutions for the black eyed peas.

Made the peas as a side for Cajun grilled pork chops on New Year's. I actually liked the peas better before the introduction of the spinach. Agree that a splash of hot sauce would be great. To have peas and greens together, this is a good dish, but I can't wait to try the peas by themselves or with dark meat chicken and hot sauce.

I've made this a few times now, and definitely agree that the mashed potatoes as an accompaniment are a MUST! I used brown crimini mushrooms instead of the white, and actually have found both to be delicious, but the white mushrooms have a better texture. It is much better drizzled with just a bit of Buffalo brand hot sauce. Otherwise, I'd recommend spicing it up a bit with some red chili flakes and a bit of extra garlic (garlic powder seems to work well). Also, the recipe doesn't seem to call for the typical seasoning of salt and pepper, but I usually use low-sodium chicken broth, and it needed more salt in the end. This recipe has become my traditional New Year's Day meal, and I make the whole thing in my crock pot. Enjoy!

i usually try to stick to recipes exactly the first time, but this was an exception. I do not like black eye peas. So I substituted a can of rinsed black beans. Not sure what the recipe was like with the peas, but with the black beans it ws really good. It gave it a southwest flair. I also used baby spinach because it was less work. Because I used black beans I served this with rice and plan to serve it with spanish rice sometime.

This was delicious. Will definately, definately make again. I am looking forward to the experience already! My non chicken loving husband had to admit this works and he loved it and wants it again.

Didn't know what a fricassee was, but we were looking for a black-eyed peas dish and this was awesome!! For richer flavor as suggested by others, I used thigh meat instead of breast, brown instead of white mushrooms. To make it even healthier, used nonfat half and half and nonfat chicken broth and it was still very tasty. A keeper.

I liked this one very much. The flavours are just right. I only substituted Irish whiskey for the Sherry which I didn't have on hand. The next time I'll increase the amount of peas and decrease the amount of chicken. I was even thinking of entirely leaving out the chicken and turning it into a vegetarian dish. I'd say with the mushrooms and the peas there's enough protein in this dish to make it a complete and wholesome meal. The mashed potatoes are indeed very nice as an accompaniment, especially with mustard and spring onions in it.

I have made this dish twice -- both times I loved it and my husband thought it was "okay". I used bone-in chicken thighs the second time I made it and thought it was much better than with the boneless chicken breasts. I also preferred crimini mushrooms to regular white mushrooms, they gave it a much better flavor. I must confess that I used canned black-eyed peas both times due to time constraints and they were just fine. (If you liked this dish you might also like the "Chicken with Baby Onions" from this site, it is so delicious and so under-reviewed.)

Very easy to make. I served it over buttered noodles one night and garlic mashed potatoes the next. Both were very good. It serves much more than 4 servings. More like 6-8.

Great dish. Great use of soaked peas from making fritters. I used the whole chicken for more flavor and served it over short-grain brown rice. This dish was quick and tasty - it's one for the recipe file.

When I looked at the recipe for this, I wasn't really intrigued, and would have skimmed right over it if not for the great reviews it got. I had some fresh black-eyed peas and a whole chicken, so I thought I'd give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised. My husband raved about it, and I loved it. It was really good. I used dried porcini mushrooms, rehydrated, which was all I had on hand, and I used a whole chicken-cut up into large pieces instead of using the smaller skinless breasts and it was much more like a genuine fricassee that way anyway. Definitely I will make this again.

Though I generally don't like when people review a recipe with all their changes, I just had to tweak this recipe a bit to give it 4 stars. I used chicken thighs and legs, cut in bite-size pieces (breast meat can be too dry, and is not as flavorful)used fresh thyme, and used crimini mushrooms. Any wild mushroom would be good, as white button mushrooms are tasteless. Also, the black-eyed peas took much longer to cook than the recommended 20 minutes. I served this with goat cheese mashed potatoes, recipe from this site. Excellent.

I have made this recipe a couple of times and found it was better with mash potatoes that rice, but... it was very bland. Needs something to kick it up a bit.

I loved this! I also cut the amount of spinach in half and served it over puffed pastry instead of potatoes.

I, my husband, and my five year old son loved this!!! I thought the mustard was going to throw it all off, but it was great! I also served it with (not on) mashed potatoes and with some hot, crusty french bread. My advice: Don't even think of serving without the potatoes!

This was a great tasting recipe but I couldn't believe that it called for one pound of spinach cut up - that was entirely too much spinach and way too time consuming (unless I misread it). I cut the amount of spinach in half and used baby spinach so that I didn't have to cut it up. I also used sliced mushrooms instead of having to cut up whole ones. The next time I will use wild mushrooms for an earthier taste. I also used fresh thyme (2 tbs) instead of dried because I like fresh herbs better. The rest of the preparation was very easy and the whole house smelled wonderful. My husband loved the black-eyed peas. I served it over mashed potatoes as recommended. We will have this again.

I wasn't sure about the combined flavors, but this was really quite nice. The sauce was rather runny so next time I will use more thickening agent. A little more mustard might also perk this up a bit more.

Great recipe, great flavors. Just as good decreasing the amount of chicken or leavng out entirely. I serve with mashed potatoes or rice.

I used mixed fresh mushrooms and lightened it up with fat free half and half instead of heavy cream. Served it over mashed potatoes. It was a hit. I will make it again.
