This dish is sublime! I made it for my bridge group, and there wasn't a morsel left. The brioche is lovely, and I would like to try it on its own. However, since the gaga filling is so heavenly, I don't know that I'll ever be able to find out. I'm looking forward to experimenting with the gaga filling. I think it would go well with other ingredients besides mushrooms.
