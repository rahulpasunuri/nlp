Looking for something rather inexpensive for a treat at the end of a cocktail party, these were good and presented very well when the whipped cream was piped on to the cake and then a couple of berries placed on each one. Strawberries and blueberries with the whipped cream make it look patriotic even. Important part is browning them after cutting them. Costco sells pound cakes pretty cheap too.
