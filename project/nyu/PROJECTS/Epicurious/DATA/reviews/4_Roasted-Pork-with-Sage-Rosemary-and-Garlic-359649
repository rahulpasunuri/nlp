This was a very easy and delicious way to cook pork! Big hit with the family. I didn't use the pan juices as it was mostly grease, but the meat was so tender it didn't need a sauce.

This is stone-cold simple, and sooooo very good. It's easy for pork loins to be dry and boring - this is the opposite. I bet this would be great on the bbq grill too... I'll make this lots, I'm sure.

Very good dish and very easy. I made it with a huge piece of meat and just split it in half and tied it with string to roast. I also added some breadcrumbs to the herb mixture to give it a little more heft. Making it again for this Easter.

I made as set in the recipe, although I doubled it to serve eight. Everyone at the dinner table had been to an expensive steak house the evening before, and all agreed this dinner outshone the other tenfold.

Yum! Very tasty! I added peaches on top and cooked them in the oven.
