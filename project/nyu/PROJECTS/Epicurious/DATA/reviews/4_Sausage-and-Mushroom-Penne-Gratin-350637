Super easy & delicious. Great option for a weeknight meal.the only ingredient I'm not guaranteed to always have on hand is the mushrooms, but this would still be great w/o them I think. My husband loves it do much that he was forgiving (ie had 3 servings) when I made this even in the dead of summer (moving and limited ingredients on hand to make something else). Great.

What's not to like about sausage, mushrooms, garlic and cheese coming together in a cream sauce spiked with a bit of crushed red pepper? Due to what was on hand, I used light cream, whole wheat pasta, Al Fresco chicken sausage as well as some peas. Avoided the water, figured I could thin if necessary - was great without. Also, don't have a working oven, so omitted the mozz and bypassed the broil, but this was delish. Total cold weather yumminess.

Made this with half and half and turkey Italian sausage, flavors were great and it wasn't at all too heavy. Was a big hit, and will definitely make again!

No rating... just a new version of the recipe. I didn't want to use cream so I added a cup of frozen peas and couple of fresh chopped tomatoes to the final mix before adding the cheeses. Instead of using sweet Italian sausage all I had was chorizo, so I added that in, chopped. I also chopped a bunch of scallions and threw them in with a tablespoon of hot chili pepper flakes... quite a bit of spice but it was good. I heated it for 30 minutes in a 350 oven.

This was very good. Added some peas and did not put the sausage back in the dish when making the sauce. Really looks appealing on the table with the browned mozzarella on top.

When not using full-fat cream, milk tends to curdle when heated; to fix this, I put about a cup of milk in a jar with about 2 Tbsp flour, shake it well, and put that in a warm pan with a little butter or oil. That makes a simple sauce that won't break! I added peas to this, and topped mine (not friend's) with chopped tomatoes to cut the richness - it was quite good. I think the mozzarella may be a little superfluous. I nearly doubled the sauce. The whole thing would feed about 8 people for about $15!

Very simple, creamy, and tasty. I added some onions and didn't bother to melt mozzarella with the broiler because I was in a rush (I did mix it in to the hot pasta), but it was great anyway.

My husband loves this dish, mostly because he says it tastes like a pizza. I use half and half instead of heavy cream to reduce fat and cut back on the mozzarella. Delicious and fast to make!

I made this following the recipe exactly, with the exception of using spicy sausage instead of sweet. It's a fine, simple dish but I think it could be executed better. Putting the sausage back into the skillet before adding the cream is superflous and just makes it harder to stir. The sauce is also too thin, and basically give the dish moisture, not flavor. If I make this again I will add the mushrooms and sausage to the pasta, then separately boil the cream down with a flour/butter paste to thicken it. It would also be a good idea to add herbs to the dish, and possibly a vegetable or two. It's true that it could use more cheese, more sauce if one desires an exceptionally rich entree but for everyday eating the amounts given are sufficient. My two fork rating is more for the inadequacy of the recipe than it is an indication that the flavors are faulty.

Oh sorry! I also halved the dry penne, using only 2 cups, and sausage. It was way plenty for two people.

Rating: 3
Is good! I did add some onion when I sauted the mushies, used half & half, and wilted in a 9oz bag of fresh spinach into the mix just before dumping into baking dish. But it was very easy and quite tasty. Hubby who thinks pasta can only be eaten with a red tomato sauce, also liked it.

Rating: 0
This was very tasty. I made it as directed, except that I forgot to save the pasta water so just used plain water. I think I will try using half and half, because it was really rich. I also didn't add any oil to saute the mushrooms because there was enough from the sausage. I think I need leaner sausage next time!

This was yummy, hearty comfort food for a cold winter night. Like others, I used part-skim mozzarella and half cream and half skim milk. I also added chopped spinach and some Italian seasoning herb blend along with some hot red pepper flakes. I'm looking forward to the leftovers!

Rating: 3
This is a tasty simple dinner, and the leftovers were great the next day. Definitely recommend using half and half and skim milk mozzarella, as well as shallots, and I added a little finely chopped hot pepper.

Rating: 3
This was really good. I added a finely chopped shallot along with the garlic and mushrooms, and used an extra 1/2 cup of cream rather than the 1/2 cup of cooking water. It was still a fairly thin sauce, so I was glad I made that change. I used cremini mushrooms, which have SO much more flavor than plain button mushrooms. Delicious. I think it would be even better without the meat ... unlike my husband, I am not a big italian sausage fan.

WOW, I made this for my in-laws and there were no leftovers. Everyone raved. Very easy

This turned out great. I made it a little healthier by doing half cream and half milk. I also used skim mozzarella which melted just as well as the whole-milk kind. I did add another garlic clove and shallots in with the mushrooms they added a nice depth of flavor to the dish. I felt that it made more along the lines of 6-8 servings not 4-6. Unless you are feeding 4 starving large men, LOL.

Fantastic and easy. Used spicy Italian sausage links sliced and topped each serving with some warm chunky apple butter also on epicurious. Quite a complementary flavor. Will probably keep this as a special occasion dish for winter nights; it's too rich to eat very often.

Easy and very yummy. I used veggie sausage instead of regular sausage. My fiancee couldn't even tell! I also used 2 cloves of garlic. This dish tastes like a lot more time and effort went into making it than actually did.

Rating: 3
That was so easy and really good. My 6 yr old loved it too! I added another clove of garlic, some red bell pepper and used 1/2 cup skim milk in place of the pasta water and a touch of dried basil. I was suprised how flavorful it was. I think browning the sausage & mushrooms and then adding the cream really gave it a boost.

Rating: 4
I served this as part of a luncheon the day before Easter. My guests really flipped for it and begged me for the recipe. I used cremini mushrooms rather than white just because I wanted to. I like the earthy color and slightly richer flavor of the cremini. And as usual, I upped the garlic amount to 3 or 4 cloves. Can there ever be too much? I encourage you to do the same.

This recipe is on the menu at least once a month. I use a chicken mushroom sausage (Trader Joe's) that I chop up in small pieces and use half & half instead of cream. Then I add some basil and garlic as well. A definite comfort food!

Like most reviewers here, I rarely make a recipe as written. But I did this time (with the exception of making half the recipe), and it was very good. I agree that a little more sauce would be nice, although it was fine as written. I served it with the Endive and Escarole Salad with Mustard-Orange Vinaigrette in the Dec. '08 Gourmet, and it was a nice complement.

This was delicious and very quick and easy! I cut down on the fat by using half-and-half instead of cream and also doubled the garlic, as I tend to use a lot of it. Everyone loved it!

I halved this recipe and made it mostly as written except that I doubled the garlic, as suggested, and used chicken andouille sausage for half the sausage (it's what I had on hand.) I also probably use somewhat less sausage than called for since I simply use two links. The recipe was easy and delicious. Even though I halved it, I still needed a 2 quart baking dish. I was surprised to find that it was not too terribly rich and the sausage amount was not overbearing.

We loved this! My husband doesn't like mushrooms, but I do, so I added 8 oz of cremini mushrooms and 5 oz of spinach to give it a little extra something. It was delicious!

There are never any leftovers when I make this. One change that I have made is to minmize the oil at the beginning and add a 10 oz. jar of Basil Pesto sauce when I toss everything together. My family really loves this little addition.

This is very nice and quick, but please do increase the amount of garlick, cream and parmigiano. Next time I will definitely add onions and I think also some finely chopped thyme. A very conforting dish for cold evenings! It should be glorious with freshly picked parasol mushrooms.

Four forks with some modifications - I used a mix of wild mushroom, added 1 onion, 1 shallot and parsley. Only had 10% cream, which was fine - added a bit of flour to thicken the sauce. Agree re: more parma. Bring on the comfort food as the temp dives!

I made this recipe for my in-laws when they came to visit. Everyone really enjoyed it. It's nothing fancy, but rather good comfort food for a chilly night. I doubled the garlic and was glad I did. I served it with some zucchini, garlic bread, salad, and nice wine. I would make this one again.

My guy and teenage girls really enjoyed this basic dish. I used turkey italian saugage, 2 garlic cloves and extra cream and cheese. This is a an easy recipe and is a great comfort food. I will keep the recipe for whenever we can afford a very high fat meal.

I just made this and it was ok, but totally unremarkable. I'm really surprised by the high fork rating so far (3.5 forks at time of writing) and just re-read the recipe to make sure I didn't accidentally omit anything. I added broccoli, which was a good addition, but otherwise followed it exactly. Since it made a ton of leftovers, my girlfriend and I just spent 15 minutes poking through the kitchen cabinets trying to find something to add to liven up the rest of the dish. If I made this again, I'd double the parmesan cheese and add tomatoes and flat leaf parsley to finish.

"This so-called recipe is stupid. And even more stupid is the use of meat alternatives. by FreshCope on 11/14/08" ...AND THE STUPIDEST THING OF ALL HAS TO BE THAT REVIEW (or is it the reviewer?) By the way, my 13 year old cooked this for the family last night (adding extra cream as suggested) and we all loved it.

My husband and I found this recipe to be very good. I also threw in sun-dried tomatoes like another reviewer (but the fresh dry ones not the type marinated in oil) this added a nice taste. I would make it again for sure, however you have to double up on cream otherwise it gets very dry. Were not the type to have things swimming in sauce, but the amount the recipes calls for is definitely not enough - you'll see. Also I used half and half instead of heavy cream to cut down on fat a bit.

I veganized this! I used Tofurkey Italian sausage, Silk creamer, Soysation parm and mozz. It was really good!!!! I also used whole wheat rotini and added some broccoli. I only used half of the required pasta but still used the required amounts of everything else. So good and creamy, it's been a long time since Ive had something like this. YUM!

I made this recipe with my 9 y.o. son! It was delicious! I made some revisions and it was still very good: I used chicken sausage and LF half and half. Next time, I would double the half and half and add the parmegian cheese in the sauce before adding it to the pasta. I topped the whole thing with sundried tomatoes (in oil). It added a nice sweetness to it all!

This is a nice easy dish and I really liked that it was something different to do with pasta. I overcooked my pasta and bought hot Italian sausage by mistake (I actually used Turkey sausage), but it was still yummy. I'll definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
Tasty and easy...I made the mistake of cooking pasta before sausage (instead of at the same time as advised), so the noodles cooled a little in dish until the sausage was ready; the brief time under the broiler wasn't enough to heat it through. Everyone still enjoyed it though.
