This is NOT Arrabbiata sauce AT ALL you should not be posting recipes when you do not know what it is and what it contains. Italians take pride in their foods Giving other wrong information is like Italians cooking from a prepared box of ingredients. This posting should be removed

Not the best recipe for arrabbiata sauce

A little boring for arrabbiata. Since it's August and I have lots of tomatoes, I made it again; this time, I browned a little pancetta in olive oil, removed the pancetta, and browned some shallots and the garlic in the same oil before adding the tomatoes, etc. I added the pancetta back at the end, with the basil. It gave it a richness it lacked before, but of course added some fat to the recipe.
