Thank you, THANK YOU, Epicurious for reminding me how much fun homemade frozen pops are (and I agree: sucks-boo to the crabby reviewer -- play nice)! These recipes are a wonderful place to start -- basically, now I just add booze to my favorite smoothies! I just invented a Tequila Sunrise pop...and I intend to try a White Russian pop next. What fun!

This recipe is delicious and fun. Thank You. What a great idea, serving "adult" popsicles at summer bar-b-ques and picnics ~ Why should the kids have all the fun?? I for one love any and all kitchen gadgets and appreciate recipes that give me the opportunity to use them. As for all the sniping going on in the reviews ~ what a shame this wonderful site is being abused by a few grouchy & rude readers.

I want to try some of these ice pop recipes, but I only have cheap popsicle molds that work very badly. I want to purchase some good ones, but I can't find reviews of most of them online. Those of you that own molds, can you e-mail me with your opinion of your molds? Do they release easily? I'm especially interested in the following molds: Donvier, Martha Stewart, Crate and Barrel, W-S molds (the pop-up, twin pops, and space pops). Thanks!

I love this recipe and I LOVE my W-S ice pop sets! If you cannot afford to splurge on some fun retro ice pop molds then you should not be wasteing money on an internet connection! Buy some style and taste miss dixie cup!

I made these once over a year ago and I still dream about them! (I lost the recipe) Well worth the trouble.

There is no need to go out and buy molds to make popsicles! Especially from such an expensive store as Williams Sanoma! Simply use dixie cups with popscicle sticks! If you must have your sticks straight then cover each cup with foil and put stick through middle. Popscicles easily come out of cups when warmed up woth your hands or run under water. You dont need a fancy recipe either, any fruit juice makes tasty frozen treats (no sugar needed!)

Just what the family and friends needed for this very hot summer. All the ice pops were gone in the same day.Didn't use any kind of liquer,only some orange juice and 1/2 cup sugar. It's fresh healthy and deeeeelicious.

I disagree with the last reviewer, pop molds are not what I consider "special equipment". I purchased a set from W-Sonoma at the end of last summer on sale for what I considered a very reasonable price. When compared to all the cooking equipment most people who cook for a hobby have, this is small potatos. Would you like some cheese to go with that whine?

This is getting ridiculous. Six or seven recipes centered around things that require special equipment, and that people likely won't try. If the fact that no one has reviewed one of these ice pops recipes is any indication, I'm right. Gourmet has precious few recipes these days-- to go and print a whole slew of these is ridiculous.
