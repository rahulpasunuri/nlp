I had to double the ratios of liquid and fat in the recipe to get it to hold together enough to divide properly. I swapped out black pepper for caraway seeds and they came out fine if not a little too dense. Probably wouldn't try this recipe again.

The bread is good, but more shortening/butter is needed for 4 cups of flour. I doubled the shortening and used buttermilk instead of regular milk and it turned out great.

Frank from Alabama, you are correct, this is not true soda bread. Someone from CIA should know that.

This is not a good recipe. You need something like buttermilk to make the baking soda really work. The dough was way too dry and it didn't rise enough. Use one of the many other recipes on the site.

This bread is really easy to make and turns out to be great. The only thing I changed is adding a little bit more butter than the one in the recipe. Everyone loved it!

The soda bread that I ate in Ireland had neither nor fruit nor sugar. It was plain white or brown soda bread. When fruit is added it is often called "Spotted Dick". The recipe book I bought in Ireland also did not call for the use of caraway or dried fruits in soda bread.

Seeds are a problem for some. I grind the caraway and use that for my current soda bread. Measure 1 1/2 tspn and grind that for an equitable amount. Jim Komar, The Nutritious Gourmet
