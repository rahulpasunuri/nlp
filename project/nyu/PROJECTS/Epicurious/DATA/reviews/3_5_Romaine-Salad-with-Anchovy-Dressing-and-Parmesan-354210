This was super good and super easy. Served it at the Oscar dinner with my husband and my parents. Turned out great.

Whoops, I also used a meyer lemon, which are much less tart than regular lemons. Nevermind, lol.

I was going to say I made this as written, "which is unusual for me", but then remembered I added half a large minced shallot. Also use rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. So be it. Not too lemony for me, and I've had that issue with other dressings, for me the cheese balances it out.

I'm a sucker for any recipe that calls for anchovies, e.g. marinara sauce (it's that time of year again to make a batch), but agree with the sanctity of using a 3:1 ratio of oil to acid. So, wanting a larger portion and after making the recipe as called for, I made another using 3T lemon juice, 3t sherry wine vinegar, 4 garlic cloves, and 3/4 C olive oil, and 15 filleted anchovies (in oil).

This a very good and easy to adjust recipe. Do not apply too long before serving as romaine will wilt.

should be 'ratio' not 'ration'

Oil to acid (vinegar/lemon juice) ration is off, should be 3 to 1. So I would recommend adjusting accordingly. Also, if you want to make this even yummier, add a tablespoon of creme fraiche to the dressing. If you have diners who don't like anchovies you can mix it in the blender and they won't even notice.

Too much lemon. I didn't love this, but could be tweaked to good results and pretty easy.

Anchovys canned in oil work well. Anchovy paste would also work if you can't find the canned.

What type of anchovy fillets is best for this recipe? Canned, fresh, or frozen?

This is my new favorite salad. I've made it with rack of lamb for a special dinner, and with spaghetti with meat sauce for a quickie weeknight. Sherry vinegar works nicely instead of the wwv if necessary.

Really yum recipe! So easy to add cucumbers, grilled chicken, or even green apples. Great staple.

I love caesar salad, but I find it to be a pain to make sometimes. (the recipe I use calls for coddled egg yolks, and while it's not hard, I appreciate that this recipe doesn't have that) This is about a zillion times faster and just as tasty. I'd replace my usual caesar recipe with this one.

I made this recipe as part of a large event. I tripled all of the ingredients and it was still fantastically delicious. If you did not know that there were anchovies in the recipe, you would never guess. The flavor is deep and complex, and the combination is absolutely refreshing.
