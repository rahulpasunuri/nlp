One last note: You cannot re-use the rocks for a year after they have been heat for a bake! I know this sounds weird, but I was taught by one of Cape Cod's best bakemasters (thanks, Hutch!) and this is gospel. I also know of a lobster bake pit lined with iron ship ballast and it can be used over and over. Don't know why this is, maybe moister slowly saturating the rock causes it to hold the heat better.

I am a Bakemaster from Massachusetts & the pit is much deeper and eloborate than we use in MA! A pit that is 12 - 18" deep (including the layer of babyhead size rocks) is plenty deep, as the "ingrediants" are mounded and then covered with the damp tarp. I use an onion on a corner as a temp guage, but a potato works as well, I guess. Ditto on the chowder while the lobster bakes....

I am a bakemaster in Rhode Island. Your technique is too complicated. We always use a potato to check when the bake is done. Never heard of using an egg!! Using a potato on bottom edge of tarp it is easy to use and you do not lose heat by uncovering bake. If you uncover a bake and it is not finished, you just "lost it". Additionally, it is obligatory to have "chowdah" while waiting for the bake. If you can, avoid a sandy beach. Too easy to get sand in the food.

This was awsome! I use to live in New England and I really missed a good New England Clam Bake. Not trying to be a spamer but I used www.sagamorelobster.com and had my lobsters shipped to me

This should be left to the experts--incredibly labor-intensive! I'm a caterer and have been hired to do many clambakes but would not touch this technique. It certainly is authentic and I'm sure the food is to die for but I don't want to work that hard!
