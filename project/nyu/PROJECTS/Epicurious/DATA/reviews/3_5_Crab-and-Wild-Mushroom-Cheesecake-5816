This is one of my standard big party recipes. I split this into two cheesecakes and have great luck freezing them. I also spice it up a bit by adding a spicier pepper.

Sounded too good not to try, but complicated and too big, I also read all previous reviews and modified as follows: divide all ingredients by 4 except crab, use two 6 oz cans, skip crust, butter a mid size ramekin or quiche dish, skip the saute part - allow cream cheese to soften then mix all ingredients togeter with hand mixer, pour into dish, set in 400 oven for 20-30 mins, until it bubbles. Garnish with some chopped parsley and touch of paprika and serve warm with crackers or french bread. OUTSTANDING. p.s. I used plain mushrooms and left out the red bell pepper. prep time 10 mins.

I catered my own wedding (a terrible idea, for anyone considering doing that themselves), and this was one of the dishes I made for the buffet. People raved; I hadn't expected it to be the standout, but it was. It's a beautiful, incredibly rich dish, and tastes just as good cold as warm. Use only jumbo lump crab meat for this recipe; if you try to save money by using anything else, you're cheating yourself. The big lumps of sweet crab are essential to offset the smokiness of the gouda and meatiness of the mushrooms - it's a dish that lives or dies by the way in which the ingredients interact. I think lobster would do well in this, too - perhaps with fewer mushrooms to overpower the milder taste of the lobster meat, and some sherry to round out the flavors. Bottom line - this is not a quick and easy recipe. But having your cream cheese and eggs at room temperature save some time by making the mixture easier to blend, and gives a more evenly-baked result.

I have been making this for almost 10 years, I bring it to parties and it is wonderful I tend to add a wee bit more crab....and I make tons of toasted baguettes, I usually use about 3-4 loafs...I am making it again tonight

This is a wonderful party dish, I used a "smokier" spanish style red pepper and some wild mushrooms. The peppers gave it some extra "heat". I also froze some leftovers...and it held up well.

Crust is good. I made it up the sides of the pan. I add two eggs, substitute sour cream for whipping cream. Works well as a base for other savory cheesecakes with lobster, shrimp and chives instead of crab. Didnt use any gouda. Saute some shallots, then add everything else while the cream cheese and dry ingredients are going in the mixer. I add the eggs, one at a time and try to incorporate a bit of air, then fold in the warm ingredients and bake. This now makes a nice firm cheesecake that you can serve warm with a small salad of greens and a slice of cantelope

I was disappointed with this. I have had better savory cheesecakes and much better crab appetizers.

I think I'm still partial to my mother's crab cheese cake recipe which I had hoped this would capture. It did not. What a waste of quality ingredients. It was ok but it made SO much and after one or two bites it was too rich for me. Over 3/4 of it went to waste as no one could stomach to eat any more of it. (And by the way none of the people eating it had ever had my mother's version so they didn't have anything to compare it too)

Agree with reviewer somewhere below ... it's a great Super Bowl dish. Feeds a lot; very popular; crab makes it seem special. But fundamentally bland and pedestrian.

Wonderful! Made it for a Spa day with my 86 year old Mom and sister. I added rosemary when frying the mushrooms and chives and cilantro to the cream cheese mixture. I also doubled the crab and the used my convection oven that cut the time by 1/2 an hour. As other reviewers said it sure makes alot, but I sent some home with my parents and sister and still had some let over for my hubby and I.

I've actually made this recipe twice, substituting 8 oz smoked salmon for the crab (don't add any salt), and substituting 3/4 cup minced sun dried tomatoes for the red peppers. Both got rave reviews. I think the next one will be meat-free for the vegetarian friends. The only problem is the name. Some people just can't get their head around a savory cheesecake. I've taken to calling it a torte.

I took this to an Fall tailgate party--huge hit! Although this is a huge rich cheesecake, I had none left over because people from other tailgates came over for a taste. I used both smoked and aged guda. Next time I'll use some cayanne and garlic, and I'll try baking in a water bath as the inside of the cheesecake was creamier and skip the crust.

I feel a little silly given all the 4 fork reviews - but this was really MEDIOCRE!my husband, father and father-in-law can clear a plate during our weekly Sunday afternoon cocktails and they really didn't eat much or have many compliments. It's missing some flavors. i don't know if adding some fresh herbs or a different cheese would help - but I wouldn't make it again according to these ingredients.

Awesome, that's all I can say. I don't recall what I was looking for when I found this, but it got bookmarked. The only thing I changed was the breadcrumbs (used Portugese bread instead of Italian), and probably closer to a full pound of crab. This one is going in the "wow them at the Church Potluck" book, for sure!

I made this wonderful cheesecakelast week for a big cocktail party, and everybody loved it. When I took it out of the springform pan, it was fine, but just didn't look very pretty..so I softened a block of cream cheese, added a little whipping cream, and frosted it. Then I sprinkled some of the grated smoked Gouda on top, and added a few sprigs of parsley around the base so it wouldn't look too much like dessert. It looked as good as it tasted and was a highlight of our buffet table!

I made this for a cocktail supper for 24 on Feb 12, and even though I've served it before, I was amazed at how it flew off the plate. I followed the additions suggested, with extra crab, smoked goouda, and the Old Bay, and they made a good recipe even better. I also discovered that if you find a special on good fresh crab that's packed in little liquid, it will freeze well -- I took advantage of a sale a couple of weeks before the party, and the crabmeat looked as good as the day I bought it. I've already had to share the recipe. Enjoy!

This was a big hit at a neighborhood party. Do use extra crab (up to a pound), but not extra smoked gouda, as it will overpower the crab. Add a little cayenne or Old Bay, and people will devour it. It does make a lot-I had 30 people (and a lot of other food) and they ate 3/4 of it. Don't worry, it's delicious left over. Some of the other reviewers left off the crust, but I thought it made the presentation more interesting, plus it was good. We liked it best at room temperature or only very slightly warm. Yum!

I've been making this recipe for years and it's always a hit, just made it again for my annual New Year's party and it was devoured. I've found that if you use a parchment circle in the pan, it's much easier to remove. I also double the cayenne and add a little extra crab. Definitely use smoked gouda, it makes the dish. The only issue I have is that it always takes longer to cook than the recipe states. I've also made a smaller version using 1/2 the recipe in a 5-inch springform for smaller gatherings.

Rating: 4
This is now a family tradition - and always a hit! HOWEVER... unless you are feeding an army, half the recipe. Also, forget the crust (not needed). Also, I think it is better w/out the crab and double the mushrooms. I also added cayanee pepper both in the mixture as well as sprinkled on top.

Made this, along with several other appetizers, for our annual holiday party. This was the most labor intensive and most expensive dish on my buffet and NO ONE TOUCHED IT! I took a scoop to get things rolling, but it didn't help. It was bland and unimpressive to the palate and I through the entire thing in the garbage the following morning. Terribly disappointing.

We've made this 4 times. We love the recipe. It's endured the cooling, freezing, thawing, reheating. We've omitted the crab when unable to find fresh, added more mushrooms, & halved the recipe. Family & friends all enjoyed the results each time. The parmesan crust is a little salty, but no complaints at all.

This was very involved to make. Glad I read the previous reviews because I didn't prepare a crust and in turned out fine. The only thing I didn't like about it was the fishiness taste it had.

I make this dish all the time and I've failed to have anything but great comments. If you're making it for the first time, and reading mixed reviews, let me offer some advise: 1. To conquer "bland" - add more gouda (I always do) and be sure to use smoked gouda. Adding red pepper is a matter of taste but you can add more of that too. 2. Yes, you can use artificial crab meat and most people won't notice but the real stuff gives a nicer consistency (I typically use 1/2 of each). 3. Cooking time is always estimated. If a cheesecake comes out more "like a spread" you DEFINATELY "did something wrong". For those of you not comfortable with the "cheesecake shake" method, test it like you would a cake - insert a skewer. If it comes out clean you've overcooked. If it comes out with moist, fluffy bits, you're good. If it comes out like cream, keep cooking. Cooking is the only time when it's acceptable to "play with your food" so add your own personal touches and have fun with it!

i made this for a parry, and everyone thought it was great. i made it without the crust, and had a lot of trouble getting it off the pan and onto a platter. i really preferred the cake while it was warm, just have to find a way to keep it that way next time.

This was a huge hit at thanksgiving. Great colors inside and out. I made a few changes to keep it in-line with a cheesecake (minimal working of the cream cheesee to avoid working in too much air also, tweeked the cheese to egg ratio) and the texture came out great. Will definitely make this again.

I made this today, as an appetizer for our Thanksgiving Dinner. I was disappointed, there are better uses for crab. I didn't make the crust, and still found it somewhat salty. It didn't go over to well with my family. This recipe does yield a lot of "cheesecake". Mine came out more like a spread. Maybe I did something wrong.

This became one of my signature dishes after making it for my mother-in-law. She asked that I do it again and again. I started doubling the recipe, and then she would cut the second up in quarters and freeze it for later use--this worked very well. A single batch makes a huge cheesecake--and it is quite a time consuming recipe--but worth the effort.

This was amazing! My boyfriend heard the word cheesecake and his face perked up but when he processed the words crab and mushroom in conjuction with cheesecake, he was more than a little unsure. However he promised to try it, and was he glad that he did! He couldn't stop eating it the night of our party, and neither could the other guests. Even given that, I still had about a third left over - and we had 25 people over. If you're expecting fewer, you may want to cut in half. I did make the following additions to the recipe: 3 cloves of garlic, 1 shallot and substituted 1 teasp. cayenee for 1 of the salt. I didn't make the crust since I wanted guests to spread it on baguette, which worked wonderfully.

WOW!!! What a hit this was for the holiday party! I had endless requests for the recipe! It was surpassingly easy to make and the crust was absolutely delicious!!

I sent plenty of servings home with family and friends and still had a large portion left over for myself. Serves 20-30 from my experience.

I really liked this one, but in hindsight, I agree with reviewers that the crust is unnecessary. Especially if it's spread on bread or crackers anyway. Yes, it's better warm. And no way would I replace fresh shitake and oyster mushrooms with boring old buttons. Honestly, my guests seemed a little intimidated by the sheer size of the thing. Those who ate it loved it, but I still had TONS of left overs. Next time I'll definitely cut this recipe in half. Suggestion - if you're going to make the whole thing for a cocktail party, try baking in two smaller springform pans - presentation might be more inviting if it's a little smaller.

Wonderful! I made this recipe for a Christmas gathering and it was a definite hit. I too used "real" crabmeat, and followed the recipe exactly as printed. Next time, I will eliminate the salt as I found it much too salty (and I am even for a salt lover) and might even try to halve the recipe and make it in a smaller pan. It does make quite a lot. Also agree that it is better when it is a little warmer.

Absolutely delicious! Following previous reviews, left off crust and served warm - the only way to serve it. Unless it was only appetizer available, would halve next time. Added garlic to the saute and substituted cayenne for half the salt. Also added dash of tobasco. MUSTS: real crab, rich flavored mushrooms - Shitake, chantarelles, etc.

I made this for a dinner party and it went over quite well. Next time I might make it without the crust (I thought it was a bit salty and not really necessary)and halve the recipe. It does make quite a lot! I also agree with the others that it is best a little warmer than room temp.

WONDERFUL! Made this for a friend's late evening get together and it was a huge hit. From an avid and accomplished cook follow this.... The past reviews that stated no taste must have used either canned crab or immitation crab as well as the ever popular "no taste" cheap dried herbs. You must buy the REAL crab for this dish and not skimp on the fresh herbs. Use real ingredients and this will come out superb. Another hint: It was better warmed just a bit and it did serve a lot. One recipe I will be making again!!!

I found this cheesecake to be too dense. I didn't care for the consistancy of it at all. The flavor was just OK. Although I added more crab than it calls for I couldn't taste the crab. If I were to make it again, I'd definately spice it up and serve it warm.

We really enjoyed this - very rich and decadent. I did take some reviewer's advice - didn't make the crust, halved the recipe except for the crab and mushrooms (used only portabella) and decreased the salt. I added a chopped shallot when I did the mushrooms. Since presentation wasn't important, I just baked the cheesecake in a lightly buttered casserole dish for about an hour. It was delicious right out of the oven.

I've made this cheesecake a few times and it has always been a big hit. I have substituted some ingredients to save time and money including prepared breadcrumbs, canned crabmeat and prepared parmesan cheese. I also add extra spices because the original recipe is bland. The last time I made it I added garlic and it was excellent. I've served it warm and cold. AFter making it the first time, I omitted serving it with baguette slices. It is enough all on its own. It is great to serve as parties and it is a great alternative to serving quiche.

I made this last New Years Eve because of all the rave reviews and was very dissappointed. I found the combination of cream cheese/crab/mushrooms without much spice to be extremly bland for my tastes.

Actually, I am not exactly reviewing this recipe. I did everything except I substituted smoked salmon (which I had) for crab (at $24 per pound) which I did not have. I think I used a little too much salmon and the result was a dense but very delicious "pate" which my guests and I thoroughly enjoyed. (also increased the amount of smoked gouda). Sometime I should try it with crab. I think it would be great.

This recipe was printed in our local paper, so I didn't have the benefit of reading the other cook's comments. I made it for a large group, and it was very popular. I couldn't get the dish off the bottom of the pan either, so I served it that way. I put in 13 oz. of crab and that seemed like plenty. I also agree that regular button mushrooms could be used, and a little cayenne would make it even better. I will definitely make this again. It looked beautiful on the table.

This is a great appetizer for a large crowd. I took this to my garden club meeting and everyone raved about it. I would definitely leave the crust out next time. This dish really improves with flavor if it is warm. I also used green onions as recommended. This is one of Emeril's savory cheesecake recipes. His recipe for shrimp and andouille cheesecake out of his cookbook New New Orleans Cooking is to die for! The crab and mushroom recipe is also in the same book.

I made this recipe for a friend's baby shower after reading all of the rave reviews and was sorely disappointed. The recipe was expensive and the flavor of the mushrooms was not apparent at all. I agree with previous reviewers that one could use regular old mushrooms rather than the gourmet mushrooms called for in the recipe. Although some of my guests seemed to enjoy the dish, it was by no means a hit like other recipes I've made from this website and I personally didn't enjoy it at all. I would recommend serving a different appetizer.

I made this dish the first time for a party and it was a hit. Yes, the dish is expensive to make and it is time consuming but it feeds more than 20 people.

This recipe is great and with a few changes I made after the first time, it was even more wonderful! Use a non-stick springform pan and eliminate the crust, double the amount of crab called for and add small bay shrimp equal to 1/2 the amount of crab used. Chopped scallions give it a little more definition and taste, as well. I've made this three times already for parties and have learned to have copies of the recipe printed and ready for hand-out!!

Execeptionally good and so easy to make. I used only 1/3 real cream cheese to 2/3 neufchatel cheese to minimize the fat content and accidently left out the "extra" 4 oz of cream cheese (not clear why the amount of cream cheese is listed in 2 pieces).

This is one of the most magnificent dishes I have ever tasted! I used some of the tips from the other readers - I doubled the crab (canned) and didn't make a crust (although the cheesecake still stuck to the pan even though I used parmesean cheese to coat it). It was excellent. The peppers didn't overpower the cheesecake at all. The flavors blended nicely. When it came out of the oven, we didn't even wait for the bread - we just used forks and ate it out of the pan. I got rave reviews for this one. It is definately a keeper!

I've made this recipe twice -- but with several substitutions -- and both times, it was a big hit. I made it crustless -- just sprinkling some grated parmesan into the greased pan to assist in release. I prefer the cheescake without a crust. Peppers don't agree with me, so I eliminated them. I used a combination of cremini mushrooms, and reconstituted morels. When sauteeing them, I also added some chardonnay. I used 1 lb of crabmeat, which added a good flavor.

Serve warm! It doesn't taste nearly as good as it does warm. The crab gets "lost" in the cheesecake . Try adding more crab and less bell pepper. Also, crust stuck to the bottom of the pan. I would use parchment paper or non-stick spray eventhough I had a high-quality non-stick pan.

Guests at our dinner party did not devour this as I like to see happen with a dish requiring this expense and effort, but my husband took the ample leftovers to his office and everyone loved it. I liked it too, but am also not convinced the wild mushrooms add much distinctive flavor.

Made this as a side dish for Christmas dinner. One word to describe it- Outstanding. Best served warm. Be sure to thoroughly clean the crab meat since this is easy to "inhale".

This recipe had a lovely appearance and was easy to assemble, but the flavor was a bit bland. I took it to an "appetizer party", and the response was pretty tepid. I agree that no one would know the difference if regular button mushrooms were substituted. Next time, I'd add a bit more red pepper to give a bit more flavor.

This was one of the most delicious dishes I've ever tasted. I went all out, and added extra crab meat (the real thing is a must) and used local gourmet cream cheese instead of commercial cream cheese. I left out the red bell bell pepper, as I find they usually over power delicate flavors. It was a huge hit at my party.

This was a good recipe, but not great considering the amount of time and money spent on it. I think if I were to make it again I'd substitute the flaked artificial crabmeat and use regular old button mushrooms since I honestly don't think anyone would be able to tell the difference.

I HAVE MADE THIS TWICE FOR TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE. THE RAVES WERE UNBELIEVABLE. COOKING AND PROCESSING PER RECIPE IS A MUST. VERY GOOD!

I made this recipe for the first time and served it to my guests at a Christmas party my husband and I hosted. It was fabulous. Since I waited to the last minute to buy the ingredients, I had to use artificial crab. No one knew the difference. Give yourself some time for preparation. It takes a while but it's well worth it. I would definitely make this again. I'm no longer the world's worst cook.

I made this last Thanksgiving and lightened it up by using lowfat and no-fat creme cheese. I too thought the crab would be overwhelmed so I substituted w/"whitefish krab" and it turned out wonderfully.

My guests loved this. I changed it a bit. I used green onions, brown mushrooms, chipotle chilis and white cheddar. I also change he crust to 1C ground Wheat Thins, 1/2c ground toasted pecans and 1T butter.

I saw all the reviews so I decided to give it a try. Honestly, I cook all the time and don't see why this recipe has generated so much attention. It's an okay dish but the mushroom and crab flavor are overpowered by the cream cheese. People like the dish, but it's not outstanding.

I can't say any more than what everyone else said other than this recipe was most delicious. I used my cuisinart to chop the mushrooms, using white and cremini. Everyone thought it was wonderful. I think I would have enjoyed it on toasted baguette slices better than the fresh cut, next time.

I made this for 15 people on Thanksgiving, we were only able to eat 1/3 of it! It was wonderful, but so rich. The flavor was anything but bland (a previous review), the smoked gouda added a wonderful flavor, as did the red pepper. I used ordinary white mushrooms, and the flavor was excellent! Thank you for the person who rated this, recomending it can be halved and cooked in a smaller springform pan. I had to come back in to find her recomendation, my Mother has requested it for Christmas Eve!

Although time consuming, this dish was EXCELLENT! Feeding a group of discriminating tastes, I was concerned about the recipe because I'd never made it before. Tastes better served warm or room temperature, and I chose not to toast the bread because I knew the bread would harden after sitting out. Everyone loved it, and there was none left at the end of the party! I used canned crab meat, which worked just fine. Excellent recipe -- a sure favorite at your next party!

I really went out on a limb when I made this recipe for a holiday party. I never serve anything that I haven't tried first myself, but I kept reading this recipe saying---"There's nothing that could go wrong with this" AND I WAS RIGHT !! This is one fabulous dish and my guests spent a lot of time gathered around the platter. I did not toast the baguette slices, though, as it is a room temperature dish, I figured the bread would stiffen up plenty as it sat around being grazed over ! Also, I would line my springform pan bottom with parchment because I couldn't remove the bottom of the pan from the cake, and I was afraid a knife might scratch up the pan bottom while folks were lopping off hunks of cheesecake. Go ahead, try it, it's luscious !! :)

I used half no fat and half low fat cream cheese and it turned out perfectly.

I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving and practically had to drag people off to eat the turkey! One teaspoon of salt is enough, though.

Made this for "girls wknd" - blew crowd away - really needs to be at room temp or cheese taste is lost - EXCELLENT IF WARMED SLIGHTLY (as in brunch leftover type thing)

Not only would I make it again, but I am making it again. I had thirty guests raving about it last Christmas so I can't let them down this year! I had marriage proposals over this dish!

Very tasy and easy to make. Next time I will cut the recipe in half and perhaps use a little less onion and red bell pepper so that I can taste more of the crab.

This was a big hit at gourmet dinner club and bridge. Just had a neighbor call for the receipe. Makes alot so have plenty of friends over to enjoy.

Fabulous recipe! I made this for a Wine Tasting of 30 people and it was a big hit. I lightened it up by using 1 8 oz regular, 2 8 oz light, and 4 oz. fat free cream cheese. I also used evaporated skim milk and reduced the amount to 1/3 cup. Next time I will even lighten it up more. It is a big recipe so make it for a crowd or halve it.

This recipe is fabulous! A word of caution - make sure your cookie sheet has sides. Mine didn't and it atarted to slide off. It didn't look so pretty since some of it fell but it made us taste it warm. It's just as delicious warm, spread on some crackers. It makes a lot. I cut the recipe in half and use a smaller cheesecake pan when it is for a smaller group.

Iasked my mom to cook this for me last christmas and it was a great hit, it does not take much to fill you, up, so i sugguest making it for a lot of people rather than a small group

i haven't yet made this, but would like to make it for an upcoming bridal shower. i would like to do it as tartlets, not as one big cake so they can be passed. not sure if it will lend itself well to that form, and how to change the cooking time. any suggestions?

Made the cheesecake for an afternoon wine tasting party and it received rave reviews. A word of caution -- it's rich so don't make the entire recipe for a small crowd unless you want a lot of leftovers.

I have made this for two different gatherings. It was very well received each time. I found it fairly easy to make. We cut it into very small pieces sinc it is very rich.

This dish (served cold) was a huge (!) hit at a recent pot-luck! Preparation wasn't nearly as time-consuming as I expected (just under an hour). Watch out for dripping fat from the springform pan. I nearly set my oven aflame the next day!

I was a little dissapointed given the amount of time, rave reviews and expensive ingredients. The overall flavor seem bland to me. I might have served it at the wrong temperature (slightly above cool but not room temperature).

Made this dish and substituted 8 oz smoked salmon for the crab- the smoked fish complimented the smoked gouda yet was not too much. Serve with a full-bodied red wine!

Heaven. I halved the recipe and made it in a mini spring form pan (3 inches) Which was still enough for about 6. Reduces the cooking time to ~1/2 hour. Also, had more filling than crust so I used the excess to stuff a portobella mushroom. VERY good.

Wonderful recipe. It should be made for a large group, though, as it is VERY rich and a little goes a long way. This is a keeper!

Terffic! I've made it twice and both times a big hit. If you have any left try it on an onion bagel in the morning!

I think this is Emirile Legasse's recipe. It is wonderful. He also has a recipe for a somked salmon cheese cake. I have taken this recipe and added 1/2 lbs. of smoked salmon to it. Talk about heaven. Fix this recipe when you want to show off for friends.

Excellent but time-consuming. Incredibly rich. A centerpiece for special occasions.

it's a very good recipe and the only thing i would do differently is use plain gouda or try a different cheese and maybe play around with it.
