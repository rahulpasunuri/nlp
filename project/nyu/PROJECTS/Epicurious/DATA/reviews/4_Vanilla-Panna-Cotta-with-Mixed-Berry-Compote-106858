Super easy to make! Made a few changes just because I had ingredients lying around needing to be used. I added white chocolate and Greek yoghurt to the Panna Cotta, which really made it whole lot better. I also used Gelatin leaves instead of powder, no water was added, and the mixture was really smooth & creamy. The compote I used frozen berries, added a splash of peach schnapps, cranberry juice, water and rose essence with cinnamon sugar. The compote kept getting so much compliments!

Delish. Totally refreshing. But I would not add more gelatin as other reviewers suggest; I took that advice and did not like the results...it was more like jello than a pudding. Too stiff. Otherwise, perfect summer dessert.

This was soooo good!! Easy yet very elegant! My guests were very impressed! I followed the advice of others and decreased the gelatin by 1/2 tsp and the texture was perfect!

Easy and delicious. I used peaches and berries. A great way to use seasonal fruit. I made several times last year and am looking forward to it again this year!!

I've made this a number of times and get rave reviews each time. It is simple to make yet elegant to serve guests and family. My wife has asked for it again this Mother's Day Dinner Party. A Cook in Cabo San Lucas

I made this again tonight as I still had some berries left over. I didn't have all the whipping cream I needed, so I used some 1/2 and 1/2 and cut the gelatin by 1/2 tsp. Still great, lighter, and less firm, which I like. If you use the whole amount the texture is like jello.

Got rave reviews from my Italian friends for a dinner party. I would cut the gelatin by a 1/2 tsp and only use 2 as it was a little firm for my liking, but otherwise, great flavor and sooooo easy for such an elegant presentation. I used a bag of frozen mixed berries, put them in a bowl with the sugar when I made the pudding and they were perfectly macerated and ready by the time I served it. I did half with the moscato and 1/2 without, both were great. Will definitely make again, this is a forever keeper!

This is really wonderful. I poured the pudding into my silicone muffin pan and (carefully) popped them out onto plates for individual servings. They got rave reviews, including from a couple that had lived in Italy for a while and really KNOW food, if you know what I mean ;)

This is a wonderful panna cotta! I served it with the cranberry-raspberry compote from this site and it was a beautiful holiday dessert. This is definitely a keeper!

What taste and presentation! Great for impressing guests. Next time, I'll make less. I ended up with way too much compote and I hate to waste expensive berries.

Rating: 4
Incredible texture; amazing flavor. Very, very well-balanced acidity and alkalinity from the berries and the cream. The flavors develop on the pallet easily and clearly. GREAT!

Strangely, my panna cotta failed to firm up despite more than 6 hours of chilling. It was a watery curd.For the compote, I substituted Grand Marnier for the Muscat and ended up with a stronger flavour. Loved it.

Delicious and so easy to make! My guests and husband couldn't stop raving. I used a split vanilla pod (infused with the cream and sugar) instead of vanilla extract. The specks of vanilla seed looked good in the dessert. I divided the mixture between small bowls, left it to set and then unmoulded them onto dessert plates by briefly dipping the bowls into boiling water. Spooned the berries around the base of each panna cotta. Beautiful presentation.

Excellent and easy to make. As several reviewers have noted, two packets of gelatin is way more than the recommended two and a half tsps. I used 3 measured tsps and the consistency was perfect.

New favourite dessert from the first spoonful.I'm usually a chocolate person, but this was heaven! It was so silky smooth and the compote was a perfect contrast in flavour and texture.I used big glass goblets and had enough for six, I wouldn't have made the portions any smaller either because it was so good everyone gobbled it down. I only wish I had some left!!

Made this for a dinner party and everyone raved! I followed the recipe exactly and the consistency was perfect. Soft and smooth with the right amount of sweetness from the sugar and tartness from the berries. A big hit!

This is an excellent light dessert after a rich Italian meal. The advance preparation is an added bonus and the presentation is beautiful. I served it with the Muscato wine used in the syrup. Delicious!

At last! A tasty and light dessert after a big meal. My guests loved it! so incredibly easy to prepare and looked so elegant in martini glasses. Will be making this again

This is one of the tastiest and easiest desserts to make for a dinner party. It's easy to make ahead of time and then just pull out before serving. When I've made a syrup out of the berry compote (smushing and straining the berries) I put it on top of the partially set panne cotte and it soaks in to the top and adds extra flavor. Delicious!

I made this dessert for my son's birthday. He is not a sweet eater and he found this (as well as the rest of us) to be an excellent dessert. Nice presentation. I took note of one of the ratings regarding the gelatin measurement and I too found that 1 envelope had measured out to be 2 1/2 teaspoons. Glad I measured :-) It wasn't a huge task to put together. Definitely will make this again.

A lovely light flavorful dessert that got rave reviews at a dinner party....presentation was impressive...I served it in martini glasses and put a thin layer of syrup from the compote on first and then berries on top....Would definitely make again....so simple and great to make the day before!!

This was amazing! I'd been looking for an eggless custard recipe because I hate eggs and my whole family loves custard. They like this more. Thank goodness we'll be having this for Thanksgiving instead of custard!

Made this dish for guests last week - it was the perfect ending to a heavy Italian meal. The portions were just right, and the flavors were light and fun. We all loved this.

I thought the amount of gelatin to use was two packages, not 2.5 teaspoons measured from two packages, so it came out too firm. I just tried one - tastes yummy, jsut way to thick. I hope no one notices howhen I serve it tonight.

Easy and beautiful - what more could you want??? I served the panna cotta in martini glasses and put a small layer of the syrup in each glass, and then the fruit. An eye catcher!

I don't think I've ever made something so simple and have it turn out so delicious!! I did use sparkling white grape juice instead of the wine. Turned out very nice.

Very easy to make and very good...the texture is silky smooth....my taste bud felt like in heaven. (I only used one package of gelatin, which equals to 21/2 tsp.)

Mmmmm... I made this for a company luncheon - tripled it and served it out of a big bowl already topped with berries. A delicious hit! Next time I may try substituting some milk or yogurt for the cream to reduce the fat content, but in its original form this dessert is divinely indulgent - definitely worth making.

Delicious!! Not only did I top with the berry compote but also some hot fudge (it really kicked it up a bit!!)

Wow, it doesn't get much easier than this. What an impressive dessert for the minimal effort involved. A light elegant ending for the Italian Christmas feast we enjoyed this year, even though the lightness is deceptive considering the calories in this one. Blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries for the compote. Hope I can add strawberries next time, because, for sure, there will be a next time.

my husband absolutely loved this recipe...for me it tasted like something i've had a hundred times before...but it did end the meal nicely...instead of the vanilla essence, i scraped a vanilla bean into the cream including the pod, while it was still simmering...it leaves that smattering of black powder in the finished product but i don't mind that rustic, real quality to food...i think i would dilute the cream with some milk next time...it was just a wee bit rich (and sweet) for me...for the berries, i used a beautiful muscat in the syrup...delicious!

This is a great recipe; they serve a strawberry compote version of it at Howard Johnson Hotel and Convention Centre, Prince St., Truro, NS, Canada. I love it. Their version of it is called Strawberry Lucien; it is served at their buffet on Sunday night and their Friday mid-day Roast Turkey buffet. Thanks for the recipe; it is my all-time favorite.

Delicious and one of the easiest recipes I have ever made. Really pretty presentation. I served for an outdoor dinner, so I used disposable champagne flutes.

Loved it - the only advice I would give is to cut the amount of fruit compote by half. You end up with way too much....but then again, it is so easy you can just use it as an excuse to make more panna cotta. That's what I plan to do!

mine had way too much sugar. I decreased the recipe by a third. and I only added a quarter cup of sugar, and it was almost too sweet to eat. That being said, it was still incredibly good. I drank some before I let it set, and it tasted fine, I guess something must have happened in the setting process

Simple to make -- divine results. Looks and tastes like you slaved all day. Definitely a keeper. The leftover Moscato is the perfect quaff to go with it.
