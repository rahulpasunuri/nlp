With all the raving reviews I was a little disappointed with this one. I followed the recipe exactly as instructed, but it was missing something and a little too hot. Maybe if I had boiled the tomatillos & jalapeño and added some onion and garlic per another reviewer...I might have liked it better. Sorry, 2 forks is all I can do.

By far, the best recipe for grilled fish. The "salsa" is so fresh and bursting with flavor - I added a small clove of garlic - combined with the diced pineapple, just delicious. I disagree on the pineapple issue. Other reviewers said canned pineapple was fine, next time I will take the time to use fresh. Really quick, great after work recipe.

Excellent! I don't understand the reviewers who gave this one fork (if you don't like avocados or verde, then this isn't the recipe for you). The salsa is basically a creamy avocado--very accessible, with a nice cilantro taste (not too powerful). As per a traditional verde sauce, I boiled the tomatillos for about 10 minutes along with an entire jalepeno before blending. Even with a whole jalepeno, I didn't find it very hot (will include seeds next time, perhaps even another half). Added 1/2 cup of onion before blending (again, as per a verde). I used canned pineapple, which was fine but next time I will dice them very finely and mix them with the avocado sauce. The little spurts of fruit make a really nice addition to each bite. Very tasty, refreshing, and light entree.

Our grown children loved it as well as my husband and I. We wondered why one person rated it so low. It was very gourmet and my family loves to eat fresh and natural with a gourmet touch.

Really disliked the avocado with the fish. The salsa, processed in the food processor, is more of a puree, whose texture--despite the nice chunkiness of the pineapple--was too like the delicate fish instead of contrasting it. Avocado flavor also dominated. Stick with a tomatillo-mango/pineapple salsa WITHOUT the avocado.

As my first epicurious recipe I must say that this dish was excellent. Make sure to add the pineapple as it balances out the salsa.

This was excellent! You HAVE to have a good piece of fish. The salsa is fantastic. I used canned pineapple chunks drained and diced and 1 whole seeded jalapeno. I served this with Almond Rice Pilaf out of the box.

First time I've used tomatillos but the salsa was great

Can I just say that this dish deserved 5 forks?! Wow. I made this over the weekend for a dinner party and met rave reviews. The salsa is unbelievable ... a little too much for the dish itself, but the leftovers were definitely used! Excellent for chips, sandwiches or any other kind of grilled meat. Definitely give this dish a try, you WILL NOT be disappointed.
