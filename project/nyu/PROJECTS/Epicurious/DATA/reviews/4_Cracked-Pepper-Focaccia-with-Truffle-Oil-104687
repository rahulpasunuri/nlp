This turned out perfectly, and it was my first time making focaccia. As many reviewers have stated, the time for it to be cooked is more like 23-26 minutes at 450. My dough did not require the full 4 3/4 c. of flour. It was more like 4 1/4 c. (But I had to use all purpose, not bread flour.) I baked it on a Silpat instead of oiling the pan, and the bottom turned out wonderfully. I used regular, not quick rising yeast, and still did the quick method. This will definitely be made again in my household.

I made this recipe (quick version) just as directed. The bread rose nicely as it said it would. But everything seemed off about the baking process. After just 15 minutes, the top of the bread was dark and getting hard. Inside was mostly done, too, so I turned off the heat and let it set in the warm oven a few more minutes. The bread tastes okay (not much truffle flavor, though), but has a dense texture and is hard on both the top and bottom. I think baking at a lower temperature may be the way to go. I'm going to try to save this bread by topping it with goat cheese and caramelized onions and warming it up. Hope that will do the trick.

I was expecting great focaccia but thought this was only okay. The pepper was a little too overpowering. It was easy enough to make but did not think it was that great..just ok.

Delicious. I used a tablespoon and a half of truffle oil (instead of the two tablespoons) because I was worried the flavour would overwhelm- I may just use one tablespoon truffle and the rest olive next time (perhaps mine is quite strong!) This is really easy to put together - I made it yesterday and cooked it today. I skimped a bit on the herbs- but I'll use the full amount next time. Which may be tomorrow because this is just so good!

I made this for my sister for her birthday recently and she loved it! I used a little less pepper, but it tasted fine with a tablespoon. I would definitely make this again.

I have been making this focaccia since the recipe first came out. It is fine without the truffle oil -- I made it that way for years before I developed a (expensive) taste for truffle oil, but it is even better with. It comes together easily -- I throw it together when I get home from work around 5ish, grade a few papers, and it's done rising, throw it in the oven while the rest of dinner cooks. The quick rising (or bread machine) yeast is the key. I add a little more flour so it's not quite so sticky, and as others have noted, the cooking time is usually shorter. Sprinkle herbs de provence on top before you bake for the best flavor combo. I probably make this a dozen times a year or more. Leftovers make great croutons.

This was fantastic! I'd used another recipe from Epicurious for focaccia and it came out really dense. This is light and fluffy, and even better the next day. Will be making often.

This was absolutely delicious! Very easy to make. I put shallots and garlic on it in addition to the thyme and rosemary. I also used a garlic infused grapeseed oil in place of the truffle oil. Yum! Will definitely be making again!

My 8 year old daughter and I LOVE this recipe- we've made it with olives and roast garlic - easy and fun to make!

A really easy focaccia recipe. 3 batches all successful. I like to whip a quick batch for company by mixing in my cuisinart. Makes working with a wet/sticky dough easy.

As a regular bread baker, I consider this just an ordinary focaccia recipe. Cooking time is way off - mine was done in 20 minutes, not 30. Herbs wouldn't get toasted (and retain more flavor) if they were inside the bread rather than on top. There are many focaccia recipes that deliver better flavor and texture.

This was amazing. I substituted olive oil, a coarse-grain sea salt, and fresh thyme. I used it to dip in an apple-wine havarti fondue. The coarseness of the salt with the creamy sweetness of the fondue was outstanding.

The other reviewers were right, this focaccia was wonderful! The texture of it was delicious...crispy outside and soft and chewy inside. I only baked this for about 22 minutes because I wanted to retoast it later for sandwiches. I didn't use truffle oil because I didn't have it on hand and used dried herbs instead. I also added about 2 tsp garlic powder. This was so easy to make...I didn't need my kitchenaid at all, it was so easy by hand.

Delicious and foolproof. I cut back on the truffle oil as another reviewer mentioned it was overpowering, but next time I'd use the full amount.

Simple and quick, with great results. Next time I'll add more herbs, but other than that, no changes required.

This was my first try at Foccacia bread. I made it by hand as I don't have a mixer. It came out excellently crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Perhaps didn't need to bake it the full time.

Great recipe- I have tried several other focaccia recipes and this is my favorite- and the least time consuming (no kneading!). I used my Kitchen Aid to mix the dough- came out perfect. I am really glad to have found this one!

I made this with my sister for a girls'night dinner. It's a great company recipe as you can put it together before and then have the scent of fresh bread wafting through the house when your company comes. We used olive oil only and it was delicious. Next time I would make 2 smaller breads instead of one really large one for an easier presentation. We served it with olive oil gently heated with fresh rosemary and garlic, delicious!

Used the black truffle oil which left a very distinctive aftertaste. If you like the taste it is great, if you are not crazy about it, the taste is pretty strong.

P.S. I always make the dough in a bread machine, using the lesser end of the flour recommendation.

I've made this a few times and don't think I'll ever tire of it. It is wonderful with the truffle oil, or even with half the amount and the rest made up with olive oil. I've always used dried rosemary rather than fresh herbs and don't miss them. I tried using bread flour rather than all purpose last time and will keep doing that. Although all-purpose makes a fine focaccia -- the one that got me hooked on this recipe to begin with -- bread flour takes it to the next level... More toothsome and a little less cakey after it has cooled, more like it came out of a professional oven.

I've been trying to find the right focaccia recipe as well and this is great. Made it exactly as written and it turned out well. It didn't rise as much as I expected, but the upside is there's no yeast aftertaste like another recipe I tried. I'll double the herbs and maybe cut back on the amount of salt next time...it was a tad too salty when I used kosher salt instead of sea salt...

I am so excited to have found this recipe. I have been "experimenting" with focaccia for a few weeks and my results have not been so good. Recipes always call for alot of kneading and after all that work, I was disappointed with the results. Well, this recipe not only makes a beautifully fluffy focaccia but with NO KNEADING!! Wow. Couple of observations: When I put the dough in the bowl to rise, I thought I had not put enough flour in...it kind of blopped in and was very shiny and lacked much form...kind of a glob. Then, it didn't rise alot..it grew, but did not rise like I had seen other dough rise. But, I slid it out onto the baking sheet and followed the directions and it rose in the oven while baking and was wonderful.

This is fabulous focaccia bread, although I overcooked it slightly. I used a dark colored non-stick baking sheet which I wouldn't recommend as the bottom of my bread was almost burned. I also noticed that the dough didn't double in size- it grew only slightly but this did not seem to affect the end result at all. I also doubled the amount of fresh herbs and it was delicious.

Wonderful and extremely easy! I've made it twice so far, each time to rave reviews. It has wonderful flavor using only a good quality olive oil. Just make sure to use lots of fresh herbs on top.

I gave this 2 forks because I thought the pepper was over the top. Also, this bread is best made ahead. It tasted much better the second day. This was my first attempt at focaccia, so I will probably make again, but not before I experiment with other recipes.

This was the first time I have ever made specialty bread, and it was SO GOOD...not too oily, not too crusty. I filled it with grilled veggies in garlic, olive oil and some balsalmic vinegar...topped it off with some mozzarella and baked it. My roommate went batty!

I have never baked bread before besides banana bread and this was easy and excellent. Such a wonderful flavor! The sea salt is an amazing touch to the top of the bread.

I make this bread about once a week. It is so delicious, sometimes it's all my 3 year-old will eat. I've made it with and without truffle oil, with porcini oil and with other flavored oils and it's always amazing. I do it in my stand mixer and it couldn't be easier. I've also tried it with both kinds of yeast and have found no noticeable difference in the finished product. Finally, I'm happy to say it requires no tinkering for altitude (7000+ ft) or really low humidity (though it didn't suffer when I experimented).

I waffled between 3 and 4 forks, only because I don't know that it's a Dish Beyond Compare (like it says next to the 4 fork option)...It didn't change my life or anything. However, it is the most wonderful focaccia I have ever tasted. The texture is absolutely heavenly, and the flavor of the truffle oil is divine. So I chose to give it 4 forks. I will make it again and again. I also made the dough in the bread machine, and then just stretched out the dough in an oiled pan. It was so easy that it seems a crime not to make it every time we have people over. Come to think of it, maybe this bread HAS altered my life a little-- I never even contemplated making bread for company on a regular basis, and certainly never outside the breadmaker altogether. I am convinced now that it's doable and worthwhile.

Mmmm...I could eat the whole thing! I made this in the bread machine (dough setting), then formed, raised, and baked in the oven. Used white truffle oil, which doesn't really come through, although there is an earthy richness to the flavor. Perhaps black truffle oil would be more distinctive.

I put all the ingredient in a bread machine, set it to dough and turn it off when it starts the "rest" cycle (right after mixing). Let it do the first rise in the bread machine. Have arthritic fingers and this helps alot.

I can't even count the number of times I've made this -- and many variations of it -- so i thought it was finally time to give credit where due! It's so easy and quick -- quicker than the "quick" focaccia elsewhere on this site -- and i vary it with different oils, herbs, and flours (1/2 or all wheat), etc. Basically, it's THE basic focaccia receipe I use almost weekly.

My favorite focaccia recipe yet. Didn't get to use truffle oil, but I love olive oil so it was fine, even added a little extra. Recipe makes quite a bit, so cut in half for 1 loaf or don't change for 2 loaves/1 big one. I topped mine with roasted red pepper and onions.

This was so fast and soooo delicious! I cut the recipe in half for just my husband and I, also, sauteed garlic as one cook suggested and loved the flavor! Served with bruschetta and fresh mozz with roasted red peppers and red wine- the perfect Saturday night meal a deux!! In fact, am making it again today for a friend.

I altered this recipe a bit and it was delicious. I used half unbleached white flour and half whole wheat flour. I used all olive oil instead of the truffle oil and I topped the focaccia with rosemary and onions, baking for 25 minutes. Everyone loved it.
