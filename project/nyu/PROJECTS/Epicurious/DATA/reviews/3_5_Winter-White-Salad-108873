I was very unhappy with this recipe. The veggies were coarse and bitter. The dressing was much too vinegary, while being otherwise bland.

I too did not like the taste of the dressing and added creme fraiche, a touch of honey and a few tablespoons of good evoo. Also, I cut down on the amount of heavy cream.

Great alternative to a traditional greens salad. It looks beautiful and has a wonderful taste - not too overwhelming. I only had yellow mustard and it was very tasty with just that, so I'm excited to make it with the whole-grain mustard. Perfect, unique salad for the colder weather!

Have made this three times now, and everybody asks for the recipe. Also, it's a pretty salad to serve to company. Try it!

I was underwhelmed by this salad. The dressing does not stand up to the blandness and the coarse texture of the vegetables. Only after boosting the dressing with celery salt, roasted garlic, a seasoning mix for garden vegetables and adding some buttermilk did this salad become palatable.

A perfect Christmas dinner salad - or any other time of year, and positively addictive! It was superb.

VERY EASY and a surprising presentation. Entirely white 'greens' speckled with mustard seeds in a very pleasing dressing. MUST be served on/in a dark dish (blue, green, etc.)
