I have not yet made this, however after making strudel dough once in my life, I can tell you that it is not worth the aggrevation. Buying it ia a no brainer and it's still hard to work with.

My husband loved this. I used puff pastry as it's what I had on hand, and I think it worked well. It's not a favourite of mine as I find the cheese a bit too strong, but that's just my own preference. Anyone who loves blue cheese will adore it.

I have not tried this recipe; however, I make a similar one using sliced pears, not cooked, sprinkled with toasted chopped pecans and then sliced chunks of Maytag Blue cheese. That's it! I live in Newton IA, where Maytag is made.

I made this for my wine club and it was a huge hit (just like the country pate from the November BA!). I used the phyllo and actually made the strudel Sunday, left it unwrapped in the micro overnight, and took it to the wine club last night (Monday), where I warmed it briefly in a 300-degree oven before slicing & serving. I would definitely make again, but can't imagine making the dough when phyllo is perfectly acceptable.

I was kind of disappointed in this recipe given all the great reviews. Maybe if I'd served it warm instead of room temperature? The dough was kind of soggy on top and the pears were too mushy (and I used not very ripe ones). Maybe if I hadn't cooked them first?

Don't kill yourself making the phyllo. Just but it at the store and it's a snap to make. I've made smaller versions and cut for hors d'oeurves too. Delish!

Our lunch group found this to me a delicious appetizer. Phyllo was used with success. The first attempt was made with pecans and judged to be too sweet. Black walnuts were used the second time through. The components should be made the day before wrapping in the phyllo. It was suggested to sprinkle the nuts on top of the pears rather than combining.

This was the hit of our wine tasting dinner this weekend. The flavors were perfect. I found the dough did tear, but I used the table cloth as was recommended and the tears didn't really matter as the filling was rolled in the dough so many times. We served this with a German Auslese and it was heaven.

The combination of flavors in this dish are nice but the dough is the worst I have ever worked with. It completely tore and I ended up just throwing the broken dough on top of the filling and basically served a pile of pears.

This was a delicious combination of flavors. I made it as an appetizer to rave reviews. I did use store bought Filo dough. It was still very good.

Delicious! I used phyllo to save time (an alternative described in Bon Appetit). The pastry cut well; thinner slices served as a side dish fed well over 8 people! Also, I used a somewhat milder blue cheese as suggested by a local cheese vendor, and next time I might dice the pears a bit smaller. I would definitely make this again!
