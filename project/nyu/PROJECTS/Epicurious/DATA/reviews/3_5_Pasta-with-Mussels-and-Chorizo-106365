I made this recipe exactly as instructed but it fell flat on flavor. It is rather bland. I tried to up the flavor by adding red pepper flakes but it still is a boring dish. Usually I am please with Epicurious dishes but this fell flat. I love cooking with mussels and have made many successful recipes with them, but this dish did not bring out the best in the mussels as stronger flavors should be married with such a wonderful ingredient. Do not waste your time on this dish.

I added diced red pepper for color, and it was delicious. I also served the sauce with fresh saffron pasta from Rafetto's. It was devoured.

This was good, but I wished the sauce had a thicker consistency to stick t the pasta. Much better with the crusty breas, as some reveiwers suggested. Make sure you use the cured Spanish chorizon- the other doesn't give the right flavor.

I went for this recipe purely out of necessity -- I had 2 lbs. of mussels and a large chorizo link in my fridge needing to be used -- but the recipe is easy and delicious. The combination of the shallots, wine, lemon and especially the cilantro made the dish; so did removing the chorizo from their casings and letting them crumble, rather than chopping them. Like other reviewers, I added some mussel steaming liquid rather than pasta water, which imparted much more flavor. My only complaint about the recipe is that the mussels get kind of lost amid the other flavors, despite how many I used. Next time, I'll either leave the mussels out completely or steam them in garlic, shallots, pepper and herbs rather than just wine and water to give them more flavor. In any case, the dish is wonderfully flavorful despite its few and basic ingredients.

Very good and very easy. I made it as earlier reviewers suggested: I omitted the pasta and served it with crusty bread; and I substituted strained liquid from steaming the mussels for the pasta water. If I were making this for company, I would leave some of the mussels in the shells as a garnish.

Delicious! A new favourite! Made a few changes so that this was a seafood-with-crusty-bread-to-sop-up-the-juices dish instead of a pasta dish. First: no pasta. Second change: omitted shallots and used an onion instead. Third change: Added a chopped red pepper and 3 hot chilis for some spice. Fouth change: Serve with crusty bread and white wine. Enjoy!

This is a great recipe to use a small amount of leftover chorizo. I used the raw version, rather than the cured Spanish variety, so I crumbled it instead of slicing it. Also used the mussel steaming liquid in lieu of pasta water. My husband declared this recipe "a keeper".

This was very delicious and so easy. I made it myself, and my wife, who had Italian cooking lessons when we lived in Rome, pronounced it delicious and "bella figura". Everyone loved it and there was nothing left over! The only thing I did different was to follow the advice of previous cooks and used the strained mussel liquor, and used small shell pasta instead of the campanelli. Definitely will make it again.

This is a keeper! I use clams and mussels, and I leave them in their shells and toss them with the pasta. Like others, I use the broth from the shellfish instead of pasta water. I also toss a little diced green pepper and tomato in to add colour.

Made only 1/2 recipe. Used dice onions in place of shallots, and sliced spicy portugese linguisa instead of chorizo. Definitely use mussel liquer from steaming, instead of pasta water. Plenty of freshly chopped cilantro, and lemon juice are a must. A great tasting mid-week meal. Quick and easy to prepare. Will make again with chorizo.

Great recipe, the mussels and chorizo complement each other perfectly. Cut the chorizo into larger pieces, it adds more flavor that dicing it in smaller pieces as the recipe calls for. Definitely use a 1/2 cup of mussel juice instead of pasta water for the last step, it adds a whole new sense of flavor. A perfect pasta dish that is not too heavy, with a great medley of flavors!

I have often prepared mussels similar to this way. Mussels are difficult to come by here, and are always a treat. Simple substitutions in this recipe will not change the intended flavors much, such as using spicy sausage instead of chorizo, and beau monde instead of some other spices. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a hit with my family, the first meal that ever resulted in "no left overs". I did modify it slightly, first I used a left over hot Italian Sausage, since I did not have any Chorizo, and secondly, instead of usng the pasta liquid, I used the mussel liquid, from the steaming step. Otherwise, I did everything else as indicated. Also, steaming & shucking the mussels first, made the meal more enjoyable, not handling all the shells. All in all, a fabulous meal with white wine ...
