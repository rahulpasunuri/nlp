Too bad there is no picture for this recipe. I felt like a French pastry chef when I saw the results of this easy recipe. WOW - yum. Will make again and again. One sheet of puff pastry can make four tarts then the size is just right. I just realized I left out the vanilla bean and it was fine.

Well, I don't know what "mkrasteva" was thinking!!! This is a WONDERFUL recipe which turned out JUST FINE for me, and they were VERY DELICIOUS indeed. They were quick and easy, and my whole family JUST LOVES them, so there! The pastry was light and crispy, and the fruit topping was just gooey enough to be PERFECT!!! I LOVED this recipe!

This didn't turn out as good as I thought, the tart base was too soggy and the tart itself was nothing to write home about. The fact that I used a combination of red and black plums instead of the apricots probably didn't help much either. I tried to compensate for the slightly more bitter taste of the balck plums with more sugar but it didn't help in the end. A better cook might be able to make something of this recipe - I wouldn't recommend it.
