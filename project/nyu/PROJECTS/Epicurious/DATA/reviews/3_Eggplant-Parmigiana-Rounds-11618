Simple, but a solid recipe open to personalization. I cut out fat by broiling, rather than frying, the rounds. Just dredge with flour, egg, and crumbs then place on a baking sheet sprayed with pam (or an equivalent). Put under the broiler until browned. Flip over, brown other side. Then put on sauce/cheese and place back under the broiler. Delicious, tender, and a bit healthier.

I have made a dish similar to this for years. For a simple yet delicious sauce, I use one small can of tomato paste thinned with red wine until the desired consistency. Add 1 or 2 cloves of crushed or minced fresh garlic and some dried oregano...... delicious!

If Olive Garden is your point of favorable comparison, you might want to get out of the Italian food business altogether.

This is a simple and great recipe; those who didn't think it compared with the Olive Garden perhaps could try this. Rub coarse salt (I have used plain old salt) on the eggplant rounds to draw out the moisture. Let them drain (I put them on cookie racks) for 30-60 minutes. You'll see the water and salt beading up on the rounds. Then pat them dry with paper towels, taking some of the salt with the moisture. Then dredge in flour, etc. and follow the recipe as written. This serves to make the eggplant more tender and delicious! Also try slicing the eggplant thinner. I've made eggplant parm this way to rave reviews from many friends. Sprinkle freshly chopped parsley on top before baking for extra pizazz and flavor.

A basic recipe is only a starting point to something great. The sauce was the downfall here. Make a simple sauce with equal parts of quality crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and a little tomato paste. Add fresh herbs of your choice and simmer for at least an hour. Now proceed with the recipe. I alternated 5 pounded chicken breast and 5 eggplant. Top with 1# of grated mozzarella, 1/4c. each of parmesan and romano and baked uncovered for 20 mins. @ 350F, using convection. Let rest for 10 mins. before serving. Now thats good eating! Served with roasted brocciflower tossed with minced garlic, and EVOO.

Very good. If egglant transformation is what you seek, you'll find it here (much better than Olive Garden, I suspect). Beware of burning breadcrumb crust at skillet stage, but if "over done", do not renounce (better than underdone egglant).

I guess if I really wanted Olive Garden caliber food, I'd just go to Olive Garden. Ok for the kids - very simple. But my husband and I were not at all impressed.

Have tried this a couple of times, my husband loves it, I didn't have any mozzarella one time but did have string cheese, peeled some of those and spread them around, tasted great.

Easy and delicious.Chicken breast (pounded thin) can be easily substituted for eggplant, as another cook suggested. Everyone loved this dish, will definitely make again.

Delicious and incredibly easy. I added grated Parmesan to the bread crumb mixture (nicer flavor) and skipped the flour part (crumbs, egg, crumbs again)...turned out great!

I adapted this recipe and instead of using eggplant, I used boneless chicken breasts, pounded very thin. The finished product is a 'dead ringer' for "Chicken Parmigiana" as served at The Olive Garden! Excellent!!

Do you like zucchini or mozzarella sticks? If you place the fried rounds on paper towels to drain [pat the tops lightly with paper towel too] and salt them - this is really a yummy snack. I was lazy for once and used just 2 bowls for breading - one for crumbs [ground in the food processor from left over stale french bread] and beaten egg. I dipped in the crumbs, then the egg, then the crumbs again. Turned out as well as any I ever did with flour, egg, and crumbs!

It was very bland, I thought, even though I added spices, etc to the tomato sauce. Maybe spaghetti sauce would have made this more taste

Just did not like this. Broiled eggplant with provalone is a FAR superior and simpler recipe(found on this web site). Don't waste your time with this one.

This is incredibly easy for something so good. The recipe makes more than enough for 2...I had enough to freeze some.

Used this dish as my contribution to our Ethnic Night dinner (we meet four times a year and this time was Northern Italian). It went over very well and there were NO leftovers.

This reminds me of a dish my father used to prepare. Now my family likes this one too!!
