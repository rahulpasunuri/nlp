Boring and Bland. First recipe that I have made from Epicurious that I did not give 4 forks.

Rating: 3
Lived up to its quick and easy status --tasty too. Needed 1/2 cup more broth for creaminess and more if you want to serve it as soup. I added a bit of fresh oregano at the end with the parsley. Delicious, fresh and nice way to enjoy the individual flavors of beans and toms!

I enjoyed this recipe but like the other reviewers, I made due with limited ingredients (no celery, 14.5 oz can of tomatoes). I added 2 more cups of chicken stock and minced one chicken sausage for some protein. It turned out pretty well, the cheese was great melted!

delicious, and perfect for a cold winter night!

I very much enjoyed this recipe however I did need to spice it up a bit. I wanted to be sure to have fresh flavors so I added fresh oregano, thyme, and Rosemary. I also made the soup with fresh beans. I took the suggestions of others and added 1/2 cup of sherry and a bit of white pepper. I also used more chicken broth than recommended. I know it seems as though I changed the recipe, I think it was a good jumpingoff point. I served this at a dinner party and had to triple the recipe but it still worked well and everyone loved it.

Just what I have been looking for our "empty nest" meals. Hubby asked me one time why I just couldn't make "a little soup" in stead of 12 servings soup. Habit. This is excellent! And a great diving board for vegetables that need to be used up. I had Italian sausage that needed to be used up. Also added few red pepper flakes for our taste. I doubt if anyone has made this as written. But that's the way it is supposed to be! Any good Italian cook will tell you that--use what you have.

Very good. Nice and quick although, another 1/2 cup to a cup broth would not have been problematic.

If you cook the beans with some bay leaves, instead of using the canned beans, the recipe is better. Also try to ad well cut zucchinis, it's perfect for veggies lovers! ;)

awesome taste! I altered the recipe a bit - I added 1/2 cup sherry, 2 tablespoons white vinegar, pinch hot pepper flakes, pinch ground white pepper, Mediterranean bail and a dash of Sicilian blend of spices (I purchased from Chef Central awhile back) and salt and pepper to taste. I also sprinkled parmesan on top. I tried the Parsley but I would prefer leaving that out for next time. Not to toot my own horn ,but my boyfriend said I can win a cooking competition with this recipe.

This is one of those recipes you can build off of if you don't have the exact ingredients at hand. I had black-eyed peas and crushed tomatoes with a pinch of sugar (I only used one cup). No bacon, but I did have some bacon grease. I used dried basil. Didn't have carrots or celery, so I added fresh green beans. I was low on chicken broth, so I added a bit of poultry gravy mix to the water. Instead of chopping the onion and garlic, I grated it. And I had tiny shell pasta on hand. Oh yes, I have the parmesan...I ALWAYS have parmesan. It's April and it snowed last night. This is going to be perfect tonight.

Wow - this was fabulous! I didn't have celery or carrots, but that didn't seem to matter. I used fresh basil instead of parsley, which I think is a must! This was definitely one of the better soups I have made and is much easier than most - will definitely make again!

Rating: 3
Just as good as the local restaurants in our state with a big Italian community! "Pasta FaZhool", as they call it - I'll have to keep the right size cans of ingredients on hand, since it's such a quick, easy soup. No seasoning necessary, but definitely a half cup more chicken broth would help...

This was easy and delicious! I was able to throw it together after a long cold day, very quickly! So easy that my 12 year old daughter is making it tonight again!

Yummy... reminded me of the real kind I used to get in NYC. Great flavor and despite all the steps pretty easy. Mashing the beans gave the broth a great depth. The bacon was a key ingredient regarding the flavor (no surprise!) I'm definitely adding this to the weeknight rotation.

Comfort food at it's best. This was yummy. I had larger pasta and added more than 1/3 cup, so I ended up using another can of chicken stock. Some of my red wine also slipped in there! All in all, a lovely recipe with things I normally have on hand.

For such a simple recipe, this soup was exceptional. I used turkey bacon and replaced the parsley with fresh basil and rosemary. I also added a squeeze of lemon juice at the end. Yum! I'm definitely going to put this in the recipe rotation for make-ahead lunches.

I made this for the first time and was very happy with the results. Added basil, oregano, salt and pepper. Blended some of the carrots and tomatoes to make it a little thicker and then added water. My husbands review said it all... After he was done he gave me a hug and said marrying me was the best thing he ever did! I definately will have to make it again!

Excellent. Prepared as directed except used pancetta instead of bacon. Let simmer longer too, about one hour or more. Cooked pasta separate as it soaks up too much liquid. Nice and thick, and very flavorful. Added fresh rosemary to simmering stage. Delicious

This is an excellent and versatile recipe. I used it almost exactly as called for int he recipe but used an extracup of chicken stock and since I only had crushed tomatoes, used them. Even my 9 YO who loathes vegetation liked it. A definite keeper and next time I will try some of the other member modifications.

There isn't an Italian bone in my body, so I was shocked when this dish came out so delicious! I tripled the recipe and added a little extra liquid but otherwise followed the instructions to the letter. Easy and delicious, and with some nice bread and a salad this is a perfect meal!

Rated this recipe 3 yrs ago and needed to print it out. Saw Olive Garden recipe so used that with variations..used 4 slices turkey bacon,(sauteed before adding ground beef) couldn't find 12 oz V8 so used 12 oz water and "Just like Boullion-chicken" 1 1/2 tsp-try this-it is amazing and all the restaurants use it instead of chicken broth for sauces. The soup is very flavorful. I will use this recipe from now on!!!

soo good i cn't hardly believe it. and so quick and easy and cheap. love it. will make again and again and again, without doubt. Added only crushed red pepper for spice (+ salt/pepper). everything else w3as excatly as laid out. as yes, vegetarianism is so much better with bacon! :)

This is tasty, easy comfort food. I used Morningstar Farms vegetarian "bacon" and it worked great. It's a really good product, but I had never tried cooking with it before. It added a nice smokey flavor to the soup and now I can try all of those recipes I had always dismissed because of the bacon. Anyway, I also used veg. broth and upped the garlic to 3 medium cloves. It was delicious. Even our toddler ate some. Will definitely make again as weeknight staple.

Made it two days ago and am making it again, plus more for the freezer. Very simple, easy to prepare, tasty, and great for a winter evening. You can jazz it up with this and that, but it is very good as is, just add s&p to taste and MUST HAVE parmesan cheese at the table!

I actually made the Olive Garden recipe suggested by njbaker2 from NJ on 11/15/04 in the review section of this recipe. I added about 1 1/2 cups water to make it more soupy. It was very good.

To those of you looking for the "Olive Garden Pasta e Fagioli": 1 lb ground beef, 1 small onion, diced (1 cup), 1 lg carrot, julienne (1 cup), 3 stalks celery, chopped (1 cup), 2 cloves garlic, minced, 2 (14.5 oz) cans diced tomatoes, 1 (15 oz) can red kidney beans (with liquid), 1 (15 oz) can great northern beans (with liquid), 1 (15 oz) can tomato sauce, 1 (12 oz) can V-8 juice, 1 T white vinegar, 1½ tsp salt, 1 tsp EACH oregano and basil, ½ tsp EACH pepper and thyme, ½ lb(½ pkg) ditali pasta. Brown beef in a lg saucepan over med heat. Drain off most of the fat. Add vegetables and sauté for 10 mins. Add remaining ingredients, except pasta, and simmer for 1 hr. About 50 mins into simmer time, cook pasta in 1½ to 2 quarts of boiling water over high heat. Cook for 10 mins or just until pasta is al dente. Drain. Add pasta to soup. Simmer for 5-10 mins and serve. Serves 8.

Instead of bacon!! Go to your local butcher shop and ask them to save the end of a parma proscuitto for you. Boil the proscuitto end in a pot of water until the water reduces 3 times. Keep adding water until you get a pork broth. Once it reduces the third time use this as your stock. Then in a side saute, start your onion, garlic, carrot, celery. Follow recipe above, once you have added all your beans, and veggie saute, then add your chopped prosciutto back to your soup. Do not add the pasta until you are ready to serve, sprinkle Peccorino romano instead of Parmesean. The procuitto gives the soup a hearty pork flavor without the fatty bacon greese. I make this soup every winter and serve with crusty bread. Oh.... I am going to make it right now!

I made it vegetarian (olive oil instead of bacon fat; vegetable broth instead of chicken) and it came out great. Easy to make and very filling.

Like a lot of people, I was trying to find a recipe that was like the soup at Olive Garden (don't scoff, food snobs--it's divine!). To make it approach the restaurant's version, take the suggestions from A Cook from Canastota. I doubled the recipe and browned 1 lb of ground beef instead of bacon and cooked the pasta separately and added it back in last. I also added more water, about 3-4 cups more. It definitely needs spicing up too: I added about 1 tb black pepper, 1 tsp white pepper, 1 tsp dried oregano, 1 tsp dried basil, and 2 tsp salt. Pretty darn close to OG's!

Rating: 3
This is a great basic recipe. I add alittle zip with a pinch of cinnamon, and a couple of sprinkles of red curry powder, 1/2 tsp oregano and 1/2 tsp basil. It added an excellent undertone. I used fresh great northern beans and let them cook before adding the pasta. I also used more bacon than required about 4 slices.

Tasty - not especialy complex, but good for a quick recipe. Most of the flavor comes from the bacon. Taking the suggestions of other reviewers, I added some dried fines herbs which was a nice change of pace and gave the soup another layer of complexity.

A decent recipe for pasta e fagioli when you add some other touches to it. Ie:spices and herbs of personal preference. Some reviewers recommend rosemary, but I found it especially overpowering, at least dried rosemary is. In my opinion, a little basil, oregano, salt, pepper and garlic salt works very well. If you want to make this as a main course, substituting ground beef for the bacon makes it much heartier.

I made this dish as printed the first time and found that it was missing a few little things. This time I made some modifications that made it a raving success at my dinner table. I used pancetta instead of bacon. It's a little bit expensive but you can't beat it for taste and texture. I also added 2 bay leaves, some fresh thyme and rosemary. I used the ditalini pasta and the cannellini beans but that's just a personal preference. I did have one major problem the first time I made this dish. I boiled the pasta in the soup and it soaked up all of the broth. This time I boiled the pasta separately and tossed the cooked pasta into the soup right before serving. The changes I made were strongly endorsed by my family who sampled the dish both ways.

I made this recipe for extended family members to go along with hot ham and cheese sandwiches. Everyone loved it, and there wasn't a drop of it left in the bowl. I doubled it to go along with the sandwiches for 8 people, so for a crowd definitely triple it. I used about 4 slices of turkey bacon because that was all I had and I mashed one whole can of beans to make it thicker. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Very good!

Rating: 3
I really liked this. I followed some of the suggestions below, including using a handheld mixer right in the pot for half of it instead of mashing the beans separately, and adding basil and oregano. I also added lean browned ground beef to make it heartier and used almost 2 full cans of chicken broth plus the juice in the can of tomatoes. It came out great.

Since finding this recipe, I always keep a can tomatoes and beans in the cupboard. This is my favorite last-minute dinner. But I generally skip the carrots.

Love this recipe. I doubled it, added a little more broth, used the juice from the canned tomatoes, and added the thyme, rosemary and oregano as suggested. Before adding the pasta, I used my braun handheld mixer right in the souppot and blended about half of it.(you won't have to mash the beans as in recipe) Made for a creamier texture. I also tried fresh basil instead of parsley. You will need to add water the 2nd day as the pasta absorbs alot of liquid. Great recipe!! Will try cooked chicken in it next time!

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe, and what's especially nice is that you don't have to be so exact on the ingredients or the amounts. Made on the spur of the moment, I used things I had on hand: an 18 oz. bag of Roma tomatoes from the freezer, a 24-oz jar of Randell's Great Northern Beans, and 2/3 cup ziti pasta. When it seemed too thick at the end, I just added more chicken broth. I added salt and pepper, but we didn't use any of the other spices suggested below, which I had on the table "just in case." We liked it just as it was, and I'll certainly serve this soup/stew again soon.

I used this recipe as a springboard and doubled the recipe. Instead of tubetti, I used farfalle (bowtie pasta) and it turned out wonderful. Instead of bacon I substituted a fourth of a roll of mild pork sausage to give it a meaty body. This recipe is a great starter, but by playing with it you can come up with some great meals.

I thought this was very good for a weeknight dinner. I doubled the recipe and used ditallini and put in extra, to make it less of a soup. We forgot about the Parmesan Cheese but it was still delicious and we have more for leftovers tonight. I added some oregano and dried hot pepper flakes with salt and pepper for an extra kick. Also used a whole can of peeled Italian tomatoes, with the juice and it was just fine. A real keeper, served with salad and crusty Italian bread, husband really liked it on a cold blustery evening!

There are so many variations of this recipe, but this is a good place to start for the amateur who wants to impress friends and family. This is a standard suitable for Super Bowl parties and there's always a pot of it on the stove at the ski-house.

I'm a rank amatuer in the kitchen, but my wife was out of town so ---. Anyway I made it exactly as directed -- I'm an engineer don't you know.

My husband has had this at restaurants many times. He said that this version was not good. I hought it was just so-so. The tomatoes made it taste a bit sour. Maybe it was the brand of tomatoes and not the recipe. Still, I would not venture to try this again.

Excellent, easy weeknight meal. I used 1/2 lb of ground beef instead of bacon, which stretched it to 4 generous servings rather than two. I used bagged, pre-shredded carrots which cut the prep time further. I also used beef broth instead of chicken broth. Very good; wholesome & filling!

We prepared this for a gourmet wine club and it was a hit. We did substitute finely diced proscuito for the bacon and sauted it in a small amount of olive oil. Also, before adding the chicken broth we simmered it with a couple of sprigs of rosemary for 15 minutes, or so. We will definitely have it again. A keeper.

This soup was really good and really easy to make. There seemed to be, however, something missing and i cannot place my finger, or my tastebuds, upon it. I have asked my sister to also try the recipe to find out what is missing, but so far she has not tried it. In any case, it is a wonderful soup. I love the fact that it does not make enough soup for an army. There is only my husband and i, and it makes just enough for us to have just a little left overs.
