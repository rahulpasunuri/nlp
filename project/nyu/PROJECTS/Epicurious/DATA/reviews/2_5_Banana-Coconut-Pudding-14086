This is definitely an asian dessert, which to me would seem out of place in a non-asian dinner. But with an asian meal it's a nice finale. I followed the recipe exactly and didn't have any trouble with the pearl tapioca cooking. The 1 hour pre-soak apparently did the trick. However, next time I would use regular coconut milk. I used Trader Joe's light coconut milk and the result was a bit more watery and not as coconutty as I'd like. Also, my pudding was quite runny. Will try 2T instead of 1T.

i've made this a few times, but used about 2.5 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of tapioca, and it's delicious. fresh and not too sweet, great combination of flavors and textures.

Not a habit of mine to rate a recipe I haven't bothered to follow nearly as written, but since the reviews were so-so I will. I used 1/2 tsp ground dry ginger and 1/4 c. sugar instant tapioca and sliced the bananas. It's a nice change of taste! Yes, even delicious and worthy of 3 forks. Tuck it in your recipe box.

I've made this a few times. I prefer using a little vanilla instead of the ginger, and I try to use apple bananas. Very simple and tasty.

Idon't know if it's just the combination of ingredients that makes this not work, but it's consistency and flavor aren't appetizing. It will just sit on the counter if you make it. No one eats it all.

I agree that the ginger flavor was overpowering, and the pudding too sweet. I also found the bananas gave an unpleasant sour flavor. It sounded much better than it turned out.

I found the amount of ginger to be too overpowering. The pudding was also a little too sweet for my taste.

This was really yummy and easy to make. Make sure you leave lots of time for it to chill in the frige.

There's a big error in this recipe--pearl tapioca needs to be cooked for an hour or so, until it is enlarged and transparent. If you cook it in the coconut milk before you add the banana, the pudding is delicious.
