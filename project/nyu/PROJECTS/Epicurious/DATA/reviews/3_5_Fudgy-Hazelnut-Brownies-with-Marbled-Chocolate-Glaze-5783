I'm surprised by the poor reviews. I've made the recipe at least 10 times and each time it comes out great. I use walnuts instead of hazelnuts and I leave out the glaze and they're delicious! A few suggestions... I use a bain marie for the chocolate/butter mixture and when heating the egg/sugar mixture. They only take 15 to 20 mins to bake since I use a convection oven.

I found these to be very good and cut into small bites made for a great snack to take to work - everyone loved them. I followed the recipe as presented and did not have any problems with dryness. Would make these again and again.

This was the worst chocolate recipe I've ever made. I could elaborate, but it's not even worth it. There are so many better recipes out there!

Delicious, my husband and other lucky recipients raved about these, even though it flopped a bit (my fault; having forgotten the vanilla in the cake, I decided to put it in the chocolate glaze even though I KNOW that melting chocolate seizes if water touches it.) A tip regarding the white chocolate: The easiest and least messy way to melt chocolate for drizzling is to put the chocolate in a sandwich bag and put the bag in a bowl of boiling hot water. The chocolate melts almost immediately and you can then prick a hole in the bag and drizzle. Convenient and no clean up!!

These were very attractive. They were also tasty; however, I felt the very sweet chocolate glaze detracted from the hazelnut flavor of the brownies. If I make these again, I think I will try making just enough chocolate glaze to cover the brownie layer, and not the amount the recipe calls for.

Good, but didn't seem much better than the typical brownie, except for the elegant marbling presentation. I'd like more hazelnut flavor -- maybe a hazelnut extract would help? I also found the topping slightly too sweet and would use bittersweet next time. Cutting through the brownie topping straight out of the fridge was no problem with a good knife.

These brownies were wonderful, although I'd experiment with different chocolate in the topping (a little too sweet I found). In any case, I'll be making these again - soon I hope!

Based on the reviews, I splurged and used really great chocolate for this recipe. What a waste -- baked for only 20 minutes, these turned out dry and overdone. The topping was good, but next time I'll put it over my favorite brownie recipe -- Mark Bittman's (from How to Cook Everything). Also: melting white chocolate is a very delicate process. Follow the melting instructions on the bag of chips you buy, and follow them to the letter. Otherwise you may end up with a clump of white chocolate that won't melt no matter what you do.

This are very rich and the recipe and makes a lot of them. I used them to make brownie sundaes and everyone loved them. I toasted the hazelnuts in the microwave which worked well.

These were the most incredible brownies I have ever eaten- and I've eaten a lot of brownies before. These definitely needed to be cut into small pieces- they were so rich it was almost like eating fudge. I brought them into work and they were devoured- I also had to give some co-workers copies of the recipe. I made them a week ago, and I cannnot wait for the next occasion when I can make them again. Exquisite!

It was an instant hit with my guests. Some called the next day, hoping that there's some left over, but sadly, there's none left. It's dead easy to make, and makes you look good in front of your friends.

Best brownie recipe I have made. Very simple recipe. Freezes well, too. Just remember to take frosted brownies out of the fridge 30 min. before cutting or topping with shatter.

These brownies are amazing! My friend's mom loves them and asks me to make whenever they have a dinner party, and likes to serve them just warm (she pops it it the microwave). They are definitely very rich and fudgy, everyone just raves about them. I always use Ghirardelli chocolate chips, tried using a different brand once when I ran out of them but it wasn't the same. This one's a keeper!

This is my "when I have guests over and want to wow them" recipe. It is perfect when you need something extra chocolatey to go with your favorite red wine. Highly recommended, but don't be counting fat grams or calories on this one!

Excellent soft, moist brownie. Do yourself a favour, however, and try to find hazelnuts WITHOUT their skins- as removal of the husk is time consuming! But...after a few bites you'll say it was worth it!

Rich and wonderful! The reviewer who claimed to like brownies out of the box better than these must prefer cake to real brownies.

This recipe was easy enough to prepare, but the results were nothing special. Really. I like the brownies from a box better! These brownies are so fudgy, it's as if they weren't baked, as if they were actually fudge. They were extremely rich, no one could actually even finish half of one. Maybe if they were cut like fudge they would be better to handle...

I've made this recipe three times now, and it's gotten rave reviews with everyone everytime. When I tasted the batter before baking the brownies, I knew they would come out great. I highly recommend these.

This is one of the best brownie recipes I've ever tasted. I had to substitute walnuts for hazelnuts, but it was still great. Try it, you won't be disappointed!
