I made this amazing Turkey for Christmas Eve this year. I substituted Chorizo for the Italian Sausage and used twice the Oregano called for... There were 6 Guests and myself; and I saw the Turkey completely disappear... everyone said they'd never tried a more tasty and moist Turkey. All wanted the recipe. Amazingly good.

This is now my annual way to prepare turkey for Thanksgiving. It made for an exceptional bird. Take your time spreading the membrane between skin and muscle, coming in from the top. This will keep the butter from draining out while it cooks.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and that was my first attempt ever at preparing and cooking a turkey. It turned out nice and juicy and had a wonderful flavor. My guests loved it and I will definitely be making it again this year!

rather nice texture, it absorbed the gravy nicely. stuffing was delicious as well, a lot of flavour thanks to the added oregano. Will definitely do it next year. great success

I made this recipe last Thanksgiving and intend to make it again this year. The herbs didn't overwhelm the taste of the turkey and the meat turned out juicy. The star of the dinner, however, was the gravy.

I made this entire recipe (gravy, stuffing & turkey) for a dinner for 9. Everyone raved about it, my boyfriend said he'd never had skin this good, people ate till they had to lie down! The consistency of the gravy is downright velvety. The turkey is flavourful (I brined mine, so it was quite juicy), and the stuffing is decadent. The only change I made was adding a decent amount of sage to the stuffing as it just doesn't seem right to have a stuffing without stage. I hope more people give this recipe a try, it's fabulous and not at all difficult or fussy to make.
