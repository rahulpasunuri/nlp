I come back to this wonderful summer soup time and time again. Easy and quick to make, just some chopping and blending and chilling and you are ready to go.

I loved this! It is a perfect hot summer day delight! I used a yellow tomato as well as red and used hot sauce as I did not have any tabasco.

Found this to be incredibly bland, as written. Added lime juice, lots of extra tobasco, and more salt than I though I should have needed. It did, however, taste better the next day.

LOVE this recipe. Made it three times in the last 10 days. My only change is instead of 2 dashes of tabasco I do 4 dashes of Worcestershire.

I thought there way too much red wine vinegar. I'd recommend starting with 1/4 cup and adding more to taste.

Maybe I'm just not a gazpacho fan but I didn't think this was as good as the reviews said. I followed the recipe exactly but didn't find it to be something that I like. I'm not planning on making it again.

I love this recipe. I cannot wait until summer when the tomatoes are perfect so I can make it. I make it exactly as stated, but don't add the olive oil, it doesn't lack without it and it makes it 100% fat free. Delicious.

I added half a green pepper, 3 small cloves of garlic and cilantro. I served it to my friend who had never tried gazpacho. He liked it but asked for chips and said it tasted like salsa. I don't think I pureed as much as I should have...only two cups. I put a chunky container aside and added more cilantro for the leftover "salsa" and blended a bit more for the gazpacho. I have tried many gazpachos from different restaurants. I loved this one! Left chunky, it makes a wonderful salsa too.

Faied to read this recipe in advance and did not have time to let the flavors ripen. To give it that bold punch, I added diced fennel, 3 crushed garlic cloves, worcestershire sauce and a little sugar. That seemed to do the trick. Got the ideas from Mom's Gazpacho recipe on this website which looks awesome but a little more involved.

I made this last night and took it to work today. Everyone really enjoyed it. I put the onion on the side and cut back on the vinegar (used about 1/3 cup), and I was out of Tabasco so I used a little cayenne. Served it with cheese straws. Will definitely make it again.

WOW! Just perfect; exactly what I was looking for. Used heirloom tomatoes, and the garlic and cilantro as suggested. It's definitely restaurant quality. I served it with lime wedges, and lime basil that I was fortunate enough to have acquired from a friend the day before. I also used the crouton recipe from the following: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/foo d/views/Spring-Onion-Soup-with- Garlic-Croutons-11691 A fantastic use of summer vegetables!

I really loved this recipe. I did add a few ingredients that I think add to it very nicely. I used 1/2 spicy v8 juice a bit of lemon juice, fresh garlic, chives and fresh parsley. wonderful.

I added garlic and parsley. It was delicious.We grilled skewers of shrimp on the side and it was a yummy meal. Enjoy.

Very good recipe. I added fresh parsley, minced garlic, worchestershire instead of tabasco sauce, and red pepper flakes to suit my taste. For a terrific appetizer, I add the juice of 1 lemon to the gazpacho, pour the soup into shot glasses and top each glass with a grilled shrimp. My guests love it.

Very good basic recipe. I adapted by adding a garlic paste, cilantro and croutons, and did not use the tabasco. Here is my revised version of the recipe http://naturalchefshoshana.blogspot.com/2009/06/recipe-classic-tomato-gazpacho-with.html

This is a great recipe but definitely doesn't need 2 cups of tomato juice. When putting 1/2 the mixture in the blender then add 1 cup tomato juice, and add 1 cup seasoned croutons for a more Spanish style gazpacho. The other half doesn't need the extra liquid. Mix the 2 parts together and sprinkle a little vinegar and oil on top with croutons when serving.

This recipe was great! I've been searching for a recipe to mimic the flavors in my local soup shop's gazpacho. This was spot on! I added celery, garlic and red pepper flakes to suit my personal tastes.

Easy and very refreshing. I used 1 cup tomatoes and 1 cup water (pureed) instead of tomato juice just as suggested by another reviewer and it was perfect.

Excellent. Did not use tomato juice but instead substituted more fresh tomatoes to make 2 cups, pureed in processor. This made the soup a little too thick. Next time: substitute 1 cup of fresh tomatoes and 1 cup water.

Easy and quick. Delicious! If you don't have the tomato juice, don't fret - it still works fine with a small amount of added water, some salt (I used garlic salt) and an extra few seconds in the blender. Fresh garden hebs add a nice touch as well.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe! I didn't have any Tabasco sauce, but I added a lot of red pepper flakes and it gave it a nice kick. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious and SOOO simple! I used sherry vinegar to add a bit of punch to it and added 1 chopped green pepper to add some color to it.

This is a fabulous fresh tasting gazpacho. I'm making it again today after just having returned from Yarnick's Farm. My husband loves it and it is a real keeper.
