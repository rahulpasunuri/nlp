Excellent recipe, go easy on the chili powder and poblano chili. Easy to make.

Such a hit with me and my husband--simply melts in your mouth. I used a 20 oz bone-in Porterhouse instead of NY strip. Served with spinach with mushrooms and shallot with truffle oil. Perfect dinner, perfect combination. Heaven.

Excellent recipe! My husband and I both enjoyed it. Didn't have cilantro so don't know what it would be like with it but was fine without. I also substituted jalapeno peppers. Next time I think that I would also add sliced mushrooms.

Had no poblano so subbed jalapeno and added a few thickly sliced mushrooms. Very tasty indeed. Had to add more water than stated, has anyone else had that problem ? Baked russets seemed perfect with this.

This is great! Very fast if you do the chopping ahead of time. Never had poblano chilis before & completely regret waiting this long. They add such terrific flavor to the side. Husband also loved this and he doesn't like his meat drowned in flavor. This one lets the meat stand out on it's own. Will definitely make again and again.

This would rate 4 forks on simplicity alone, but the flavor really knocks it out of the park. I used red onion and skipped the chile as I didn't have one on hand. I look forward to trying this again with the chile. Just yummy! I had this with a Columbia Crest Two Vines Cabernet Sauvignon. Nice match.

Yahoo! Round up the posse! Great technique -- and flavorful! We loved the technique, and used ingredients we had in our pantry and refrigerator instead of a couple called for in the recipe. We used good paprika instead of chile powder, and used sliced green pepper instead of the chiles and we think it brightened up the dish. We served it with large warm flour tortillas -- and everyone made their own fajitas.

Wow! We loved this. We started with good meat -- a nearby butcher sells prime meat -- then sprinkled the chili powder rather than rub with full amount thus letting the meat's own flavor remain forward. The poblano/onion side dish was just terrific, followed recipe exactly. It made up very quickly - I'd done the chopping, measuring beforehand so could keep visiting with our dinner guests. Served with cooked carrots and new potatoes tossed in olive oil/dijon/Italian seasoning and roasted in oven. Would DITTO this combination.

This is a good, simple recipe. I made a few alterations...I cut down on the cilantro to about a teaspoon... the hubby and I both feel that just a little cilantro goes a long, long way. Also, instead of the poblanos, I used fresh roasted Nu Mex green chiles. It's chile season here, and it was hard to justify just using plain, old, no-heat poblanos, when we have such a great local crop. Other than that, it was a simple, easy weekday meal I'd recommend.

This is a very flavorful meal. I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with it. The only thing I would recommend is using a non-stick skillet. I used my regular skillet and now I get to spend the remainder of my evening trying to keep it from joining the black-bottom skillet graveyard.

The steaks were very good and the side of onions and peppers was excellent. I used onions,poblano and red bell peppers and 1/2 pound of mushrooms because these are what I had on hand. Poblanos have a pleasant smokey kind of flavor that is more mild than medium in heat. I made a side of the lemon creamed spinach on this site and that was a very good cool to the heat in the onion mix. I made 4 steaks about 6.5 ounces each and did not double the onion and chilis. This balance worked great for my husband and 2 teen-agers.

I thought this was a wonderful weeknight recipe that would work well in a rotation of simple American dinners. I love steaks with olive oil and herbs, but this is a delicious and fun alternative. I like especially that the onions which are a side dish, really, are cooked in the same pan. Good flavors, esp. the wealth of fresh cilantro. I might add a little lime next time!
