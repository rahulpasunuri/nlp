I 3 chimichurri, but I feel like this recipe is lacking something. I've made it a couple times and can't figure out what it is...

Great and easy recipe that works great on flank steak, London broil and even did it on lamb. It was amazing!

Wow was this amazing! Exactly the flavor I was looking for. As a marinade on the flank steak, it was so good and I did not taste the cilantro (I am not a fan). I will make this again for sure!

Really great marinade for those not so great pieces of beef.

The marinade made the skirt steak taste great after a 24 hour soak. The red wine was a bit overpowering as a condiment for the tacos. I started to hand stir everything but used food processor to combine at the very end to really blend the oil and vinegar before starting the marinade.

Yum! Not everyone likes cilantro- so if you don't, this isn't for you. The only substitution I made was red pepper flakes for the chilies.
