Very nice, but rather bland. Substituted habanero chilies. Now THAT worked and made it a little spicy.

This is like a really light hushpuppy recipe. I could see substituting the peppers for many different vegetables (especially onions or peas) and serving these with fish. I deep fried mine in sunflower oil; it's just what I had around at the time. I think it left the fritters with a cleaner taste than vegetable oil might have. This was drama-free deep frying all around.

Thought these were good and pretty easy, I thought there was a little too much of the corn meal batter, it was more jalapeno hush puppy than jalapeno popper. Will probably try some variations on this.

Made (and tested for quality control) these for a Hannukah/Christmas celebration. Even though recipe doesn't give make ahead instructions, I'm hoping they well re-heat well tomorrow. Had not made fritters before, but found it easy to do, if a bit time consuming and certainly messy. Definitely add the extra salt -- and lots of it. Will serve w/ salsa and sour cream. Very spicy, some will probably find it too much. I liked it, and was especially pleased with the texture: crispy on the outside, soft inside.
