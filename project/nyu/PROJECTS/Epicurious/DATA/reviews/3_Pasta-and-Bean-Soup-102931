Terrible recipe. I had to use broth instead of the reserved liquid to give it some flavor. Very bland.

A fantastic soup. Thick and delicious. I used dried rosemary and tinned tomatoes and it was still excellent. Will make again.

This is a great, hearty recipe. It definitely needs the salt and may require more, to taste, in order to bring the flavor out.

did you follow the recipe to bring the beans flavor out right.

Yuck! Did I miss something? This soup looked pretty but had no flavor whatever. I tried adding chicken stock and some garlic but still yuck. Alot of work to throw in the trash.

This was very good, but the best pasta e fagioli comes from Naples. Northern Italians just don't "get it" when it come to tomatoes.

This soup was fantastic! The rosemary adds a fabulous flavor which I have rarely found in other soups. In reviewing the recipe, I was concerned that five cups of water might make it too bland, so I revised that by using two cups of chicken broth and three cups of water. I also used white kidney beans as opposed to the cranberry beans, but that was simply a personal preference. It was not too salty at all. The family loved it and are clamouring to know when I'll make it again. There's none left!

There is no expression for the taste of pasta and bean, you have to eat it, it is healthy for you in many way, specially for your heart.
