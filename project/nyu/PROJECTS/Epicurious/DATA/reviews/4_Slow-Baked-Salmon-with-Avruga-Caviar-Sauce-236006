Made this last night. No stores knew what Avruga was, so I ended up with the cheap lumpfish stuff - I must say, I got a lot of comments when the food coloring in the caviar turned my sauce a wonderful shade of teal. Very strange indeed. The dish itself was good, and the wilted greens were a very nice touch. BTW, I could NOT get the fish to cook at 250 in 35 minutes, and ended up bumping it up to 350 for the last few minutes.

Marvelous way of serving salmon. The slow cooking makes for a juicy, flavorfull fish, and the caviar sauce matches it perfectly, making it unnecessary to use anything else on the salmon (not even the usual salt and pepper!). Serve with potatoes and fresh salad, and you have an effortless first-rate dish!

My guests were screaming this dish is so good! Easy, yet sophisticated. I've used Avruga before. It's relatively inexpensive and tastes great. I also loved the texture of salmon; almost creamy after cooking in a cool oven for a half hour. You will not be disappointed. I did not have creme fraiche handy, so I used the alternate of equal parts sour cream and heavy cream. Quite delicious.
