I was a little worried about peeling the chickpeas but it went faster than expected. I used parsley instead of mint. Simple and delicious. I can't wait to make it again.

OMG, shelling the chickpeas took forever! not sure it is worth the effort, as the shells never concern me when I make hummus from canned chick peas. I wouldn't bother next time. Used roasted garlic, as recommended. This was good, not spectacular.

Flavors here were subtle but wonderful. It was easy, but shelling the chickpeas was a little time-consuming.

To the last reviewer, honey is not vegan. It is an animal product, so should not be used for those who follow a vegan diet.

I made this as an appetizer for a vegan potluck with toasted honey sesame pitas, and everyone was after me for the recipe. Despite not being vegan or even vegetarian myself, I managed to convince even staunch meateaters that vegan dishes are not always completely tasteless. I added more mint than asked for, and letting it set for several hours really enhanced the taste. Skinning the chickpeas was more labor-intensive than I was hoping, but it was well worth it.

This is a great recipe. Even if you don't have fresh herbs, dry herbs work just fine. It's great with pita bread. This recipe has truely become a family favorite.

I tried this recipe as published the first time, but the second time I substituted roasted garlic and the texture and flavor profiles were greatly enhanced.
