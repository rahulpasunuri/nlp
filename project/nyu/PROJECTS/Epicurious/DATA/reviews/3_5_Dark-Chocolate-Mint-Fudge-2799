Hadn't made fudge in a long time, so felt like a beginner. Made this three times in a row, all came out well. Had a thermometer and the timing worked the first and third times, but the second I had the heat up a bit more and it got to temp in about 7 minutes, so do pay attention to it being medium high after it boils. I made it with half the peppermint as other suggested, but found it not as strong as I like, so if you like peppermint, go for the whole amount! I added about a cup of chopped toasted walnuts to two of the batches just before putting them in the pan, worked great.

I, too, hate those people who swap out every ingredient and then complain that the recipe didn't work, but dangit, I didn't have enough cream! Sour cream to the rescue... NOT. The gods of substitution did not smile down upon me, leaving me instead with a dry, grainy heap of non-fudge. So, heed this cautionary tale and do NOT substitute anything for the cream.

This was simple, easy and fast. I whipped it up in less than an hour and only had the opposite end of my savory wooden spoon to stir. No candy thermometer needed, just go by the 9 minutes it suggests and be sure to turn down the heat a bit if you see the mixture start to get too high (I had to use a 2.5 quart pot instead of 3). Outstanding taste -- came out perfectly and my friend/coworker who asked that I make him some fudge said it was divine (and he didn't really want mint-flavored).

This is a great recipe! I've tried several others and had trouble with graininess, and the mixture breaking into an oily mess. This recipe came out perfectly and gave me beautiful, smooth and creamy fudge. It did not even take 2 hours or any chilling to set to a perfect consistency. I think the amount of mint is perfect, but that is easily adjusted to personal preference. Very easy, a great result and easily customizable with different extract flavors or add-ins. This will be go-to fudge recipe from now on!

This real easy and very tasty. I cut the peppermint in half because the full amount was a little too much. I also covered the top with smashed candy cane bits.

I made this last year and it turned out well, no thermometer needed. This was my first fudge attempt ever and I'll make it again this year!

I used mint chocolate chips instead of the six ounces bittersweet or semisweet chopped chocolate and omitted the peppermint extract. Candy-making is always a little tricky for me because I don't use a thermometer, but it turned out fine and the fudge disappeared very quickly.

I make this every year and everone requests it. This was the first fudge recipe I ever tried and I found it to be very simple and straightforward. Be sure to use a candy thermometer to get the right consitency.

I made this last year to bring to a Christmas family reunion near San Francisco, Ca- they traveled well and were THE hit out of all the other holiday "treats".. I'm getting requests again for this year! I didn't bother with the violet thingies, too much frilly foo foo for me and nobody seemed to be looking for them anyway because they went so fast.. ;)

If you have never made candy before and don't know what to look for, this is NOT a starter recipe. After hours of labor & untold fortune spent on chocolate, we had a 10-pound pile of pudding. Pursuant to hyena-like laughter from well-meaning candy experts, and after a stiff cocktail, we regrouped and re-cooked the already-chilled fudgepudding for a second go-round. The second cooking proved to be the effective one, and now we have a caramellic version of what we would like to call "Twice-cooked fudge". Not for the faint of heart. Cocktails highly recommended.

This was so easy! I've never made fudge so was a little apprehensive but vigilant about the temp. It set up fine while I was scooping it into little gold foil candy cups. The mint flavor is present but not overwhelming (unlike the smell, boy my nose burnt pouring it into the bowl!) It's like a really, really REALLY good after-dinner mint. These are going into my cookie tray for gifts this year and I''m glad I found the recipe!

Came out too dry to form into a fudge so the temps and times may need to be adjusted. After "fixing" the problem, the flavor was wonderful. Willing to try again, but not the easiest of fudges for a beginner.

this was pretty good but make sure you use peppermint extract and not just mint. I did that and although it still tasted pretty good i think peppermint would of been better. This fudge set up within minutes. It was my first fudge and it was an easy starter fudge.

Awesome Fudge! Worked as is at high altitude (boiling took longer though). I did cook the fudge to a 235 temperature, not by design but due to distractions. This recipe is a great foundation for other flavor fudge too. Swap out the Peppermint for Orange extract etc.

Was very yummy. I had to make this for quite a few people...300, and this recipe did fine being more than doubled. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

(Oops, accidentally erased my previous review, which is what the cook from Charlottesville was referring to.) Very disappointing: fudge didn't set properly even after two DAYS in the refridgerator. I couldn't serve it; in fact, it was so soft I couldn't even remove it from the foil with a scraper! Five minutes after removing it from the refrigerator (i.e. while I was trying to cut it), fudge melted into a sticky mess. Flavor was okay, but with the soft texture, it reminded me more of canned frosting than fudge. I did use a candy thermometer (which I've calibrated) and followed the instructions. I have also made other fudges before, so I'm well aware of how delicate candies can be. Suggestions, anybody? Especially disappointing as I'd planned on giving it as a gift after all the wonderful reviews.

An excellent, very creamy fudge, with great flavor. The best recipe I have tried, and I've made a lot! Mine set up perfectly after 2 hours. Those having trouble may not have cooked long enough, or may have left the temp. too high. Be sure and use a candy thermometer and follow the heating directions exactly-candy, especially chocolate, is very sensitive to temp. To make plain chocolate fudge, substitute vanilla extract for the peppermint.

I've made this as a gift and for holiday parties. People often ask for the recipe. It's very creamy, and the amount of mint is just right.

This is an easy recipe. I would like to try it with a light or milk chocolate next.Also I would suggest using an 8X8 pan so that the fudge is not so thick.
