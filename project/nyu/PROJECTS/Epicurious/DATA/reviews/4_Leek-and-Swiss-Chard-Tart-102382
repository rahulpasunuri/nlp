Turned out splendidly! I used russet potatoes. If you can find Danish Creamery butter in your local grocery store, you should definitely consider buying it for this.

great recipe! It came out well the first time when I followed it closely, but even better the second time when I made some modifications. I use two pre-made pie crusts, whole-wheat. Add two bunches of swiss chard or other greens, and then followed the rest of the proportions. It came out heartier and healthier. All of my picky eaters were happy with this one, including my 2 year old. Great way to sneak some chard or other greens into their diet, they wouldn't have eaten them otherwise.

Loved this recipe! I used a Pillsbury pie crust, and I added a head of roasted garlic to the leek & chard mixture before combining it with the egg mixture and my husband & I ate almost the whole thing in one sitting. Making it again tonight with the addition of some goat cheese and roasted beets.

I made it in a precooked pie shell and it was tasty. The thyme taste was a little strong. next time I would use less. I wish I had added cheese as suggested by other reviewers. Anyone who says that it is runny, it is due to substituting half and half or milk for the whipping cream.

Very nice tart. I blind baked the puff pastry crust first and added 2 oz of fresh goat cheese to the egg mixture. I used the very expensive Dufour puff pastry (10.49 per sheet!) and it was just ok. I will use the Pepperridge Farm pastry from now on. Served as a first course with each wedge accompanied by a frisee salad with toasted walnuts and a walnut vinaigrette. Quite a hit at the dinner party.

This dish was AMAZING. I was sort of blown away, actually. Made it exactly as shown, except we used skim milk instead of cream for the healthfulness factor; it didn't seem to thin it out at all and if it affected the taste, I couldn't tell. Also (and this is small), we only had about 1/4 tsp of thyme left in the container so we supplemented with dried oregano. Only needed 10 minutes on the second cooking. Delicious as leftovers. Would make this again in a second.

O.K., so I turned this recipe into a quiche. I just added a little freshly grated parmesan and gruyere cheeses and used a ready-made crust and it was divine! I will put this into my personal recipe collection and make it again and again.

Everyone loves this tart! Make my own Pate Brisee for the crust...only takes a minute in the food processor. I prefer to substitute skim milk for cream...tastes just as good and you save a ton of fat calories. Usually saute a couple of sweet Italian chicken sausage links (1/2 lb) before the leeks and swiss chard and add walnuts or roasted red peppers. Great basic recipe to play with and make your own!

I really liked this dish. the only modifications I made was to add some garlic, and use only a cup of cream. the crust was a little soggy, but the flavors were delicious!

Rating: 4
Great recipe. I used my own pie dough since I had some in the freezer. Only change to the recipe was to substitute the cream for half and half. Typically I have no issue with making this substitution for tarts, but in this case, it did make it too runny despite cooking an extra 10 minutes. Flavor was fantastic, especially considering it has no cheese in it.

Excellent and easy. The first time I made this recipe I used cream, but now I use milk and it turns out just as well, with a fraction of the fat. I was really surprised the puff pastry made such a great crust. Yum!

Rating: 3
Rich, but very tasty. It reheated nicely in the oven the next couple of days. I love leeks, but have always been "meh" on swiss chard, but this is definitely my favorite way to prepare chard so far! I made no modifications, and we thought it was a great vegetarian main dish.

Made as directed (except used rainbow chard). The puff pastry got stuck to the glass pie dish & was difficult to slice when reheated. I might try using a removable bottom tart pan instead next time. Overall a good dish, but not spectacular.

This was easy and delicious. Instead of using frozen pastry, I bought two small Tenderflake crusts. I also downgraded to a less fatty cream.

I made this in quiche form with some pie dough left over from the holidays. Parbaked the crust. I used 2 medium-bunches of Chard, because we love Chard, otherwise didn't change a thing and it's a new favorite.

Easy and decadent! When we received both leeks and swiss chard in our CSA farmbox, I stumbled across this recipe that highlights the fresh ingredients perfectly. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully. I definitely will be making it again in the future.

Yummy. Fine with regular mile rathar than cream. I save 4 forks these days, though, for recipes that taste with good but without needing cream and a buttery crust.

Wow, surprised me completely. I used half and half, didn't have whipping cream, took about 30min longer to cook. I'm still eating the leftovers, can't believe such simple ingredients could produce something with such rich flavour! Will make again.

This is an excellent recipe. The tart comes out rich and delicious. People are always surprised that this has no cheese in it. Needed to be baked for about 10 to 15 minutes longer than indicated. Also, I used a pie crust instead of puff pastry (I didn't realize that was a seasonal item for Trader Joe's!), and it still came out excellent.

Rating: 4
This is a delicious recipe. I made it as directed. Don't let the puff pastry intimidate you as it often does me. I finally dove in and worked with it and it really was a simple component of the dish - an element to the dish that makes it even more light and fluffy. The custard filling is also a light filling and despite the high calorie ingredients. It was really hard to stop eating. My partner and I easily had a couple of slices each and were still ready to have more. This is a keeper and will be made many times more now.

Rating: 4
Great recipe and easy to adapt. We don't like leeks or onions, so I doubled the amount of chard and left the leeks out completely. I also added 1/2 cup of fresh grated parmesan. I used frozen pastry puff dough and just stretched it to fit the pie plate, so all in, the prep time was about 15 minutes. Quick, easy, delicious!

Rating: 4
Fantastic. I ended up using phyllo (I know, not the same as puff pastry), and used full fat everything. Cheese might be nice, but it really doesn't need it. I did add fresh sweet corn (two ears, but I would recommend one), and added, as per someone else's review, a cup or so of chopped chard stems. This is a solid recipe. Don't go low-fat anything. You'd miss the point. (And fat's good for you.)

This was very nice. I made it w/Pillsbury crust, so I'm rating the filling. Very basic. I, too, added some parmeggiano, the real stuff. I also sprinkled some pine nuts on top. That was good.

Rating: 4
Delish! My 3 1/2 year-old and I made this together to use some of our wonderful CSA veggies. We used full-fat cream and farm-fresh eggs - can't imagine that this would be half as yummy without that combo. We also halved the salt and added 1/4 cup of grated parmesan. This was the first time my son knowingly ate chard. We'll be making this again soon!

This is a fabulous recipe, virtually foolproof. My husband (a French gourmand) loved it. I added smidge of finely grated parmesan cheese for fear of it needing a little oomph. It probably didn't, but mine turned out perfectly. This is a winner.

Rating: 3
i loved the taste, but even though i cooked it an extra ten minutes, it was a bit runny in the center. i can only guess it is because the veggies were mostly in the middle. make sure to distribute the leeks and swiss chard well in the egg mixture.

This is a wonderful recipe and a great way to use summer's bounty of chard. A few notes: you could also use the brightly colored chard stems, up to nearly 1 cup, chopped and sauteed with the leeks. The chard itself can be replaced with kale or any hardy green. I'd also halve the salt. Cheese, up to 1 cup grated parmesan or gruyere could be added, which might be another reason to decrease the salt. As written, it is GREAT and there's a lot of flexibility to the recipe.

veggie quiche: a great idea for using swiss chard! i've made this 3x this month, and will be making it again this weekend. i haven't tried it with the leeks, though - i haven't had them on hand, so have used onions instead. this recipe is foolproof.

Rating: 3
I would definitely be sure to bake longer next time, at the original 425 degrees setting. I would also double the salt/pepper, and add more fresh thyme.

Rating: 4
Wonderful and easy. The only change I made was to use kale (black Italian variety), which I had on hand, instead of the kale. I doubt it made much of a difference. But I loved the subtlety of the flavor and the lightness of the overall dish. It will definitely go into my fall favs and I may even try adding the sausage as a nice variation. Either way, it would be a fantastic brunch dish or light dinner.

fabulous dish! As a college student, I try to make food that 1)tastes excellent 2)is healthy (at least when consumed in moderation) and 3)will last a few days as leftovers! This was perfect. I made the crust using Mark Bittman's flaky pie crust recipe with whole wheat flour, added a locally produced sausage (for protein, yes!), and used kale instead of swiss chard and it turned out perfectly. I will definitely make this again.

I agree with the last guy/gal. When I lived in France, NOBODY worried about skim anything - they ate lots of fattening foods - just in proportion (i.e., not THREE pieces of quiche, but ONE). They do NOT have the weight problems that we do. When are we going to learn as a society that it's all about balance??

I have not yet made this...tonights the night...but I felt compelled to address comments about using skim milk. For those of you who do not know this...the vitamins in leafy greens are FAT soluble, which means they NEED to be eaten with fat in order for your body to assimilate the vitamins. It's no wonder that in this fat-phobic country that we have an obesity epidemic. This less fat people eat the larger they seem to become. Fat is a vital nutrient needed for good health, just eat in moderation and avoid processed fats like toxic canola oil (please research this if you do not know where this comes from) and vegetable oils. Use butter and olive oil, the least processed and most natural fats there are available. Clarify the butter for sautéing and use olive oil when it wont be heated to get the best benefits. If still you cant quite bring yourself to make this with the cream&use evaporated milk instead, it wont be as yummy, but it will set up better than using skim milk.

I don't know why people insist on making dishes lower in fat by substituting inferior products and then expect something to taste the same. Skim milk is mostly water, so of course it doesn't have much flavor! This dish was quite flavorful made with cream. I also used fresh thyme which I highly recommend. Subbed an all-butter crust for the puff-pastry. I didn't find the texture to be much like a quiche. It is lighter and reminded me a bit of scrambled eggs, but not in a bad way. Very rich and addicting. Would make a lovely brunch dish.

Rating: 4
Extraordinary, subtle, yummm. Takes "quiche" to another level, with its beautifull puff pastry crust and richly savory insides (the healthy swiss chard, thankfully, lowers the guilt level felt over consuming so much cream). I can only guess that negative reviewers made substitutions for the heavy cream, which is key to the whole experience, (e.g. one used skim milk...ughhh...no wonder results weren't "4-fork"!).

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful tart, I've made it three times, most recently for a luncheon and most people had seconds. The flavor is great, but it is a subtle taste. A lot of people think it has artichokes in it. Using the puff pastry makes this a really easy alternative to a quiche.

Rating: 3
I was disappointed to find the tart to be rather bland and tasteless despite the fact that I added pepper, salt and nutmeg as instructed. I even used fresh thyme about three quarters of the way through cooking the leek and swiss chard. I suspected it would need something extra, but I'm not sure what. However, I did find the tart to be quite airy and fluffy unlike a quiche which can tend to be heavy. The puff pastry as well added another interesting layer of texture. Comparatively speaking I would say this is much lighter tasting than a quiche, but does not have the same punch in flavour. While it turned out quite nicely, even when I used skim milk, I'm not sure I would make it again. Perhaps I would find another recipe and experiment with different spices and herbs.

My kids even love this one; they call it "dinner-pie." We serve it as an entree, with a big salad so we don't feel so bad about the fat content.

Very yummy. Was a little confused by using sheets to line a pie crust, but the results proved that it was fine. Do more than coarsely chop the leeks -- i decided that the texture is better when the leeks are chopped finer -- about 1/2" squares.

I used a pre-made crust and replaced the whipping cream with half and half. I ended up with more filling than could fit in one crust, but it tasted fine. I didn't have thyme, so I used Herbs de Provence instead.
