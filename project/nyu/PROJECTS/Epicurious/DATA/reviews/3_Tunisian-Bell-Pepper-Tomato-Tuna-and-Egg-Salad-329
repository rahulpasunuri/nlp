I make this regularly, and it is a favorite. I have one person in the family who doesn't like tomatoes, so subsitute grape tomatoes (fresh) instead. The rest of the recipe works perfectly! My sister-in-law, who thinks that capers are God's gift to man, loves it.

I have to say that even though I myself did not make this recipe...I had it when I was in Tunisia and it was wonderful !!! The only difference at all was that they chopped the tomatoes up instead of cutting them into wedges.They sat a plate full of this on the table and also a big basket of breads which we then tore off pieces and used it to pick up bites of tuna,eggs,olive oil and all the rest of the ingredients.It was so delicious.I plan on making this very soon now that I have the recipe.Yummm !!! lol

Being a tunisian, I did not ry this recipe specifically, but i can tell you it will taste good. -in my hometown, mahdia, ew have some variation to it: 1) we grill 2 or 3 garlic gloves with the pepper and tomatoes 2) we use the long and spicy bell peppers not the this ones 3) tomatoes can be boiled instead of grilled 3) 1/2 tsp of ground carawy seeds is a must to the recipe 4) once all ground or lightly pulsed, add the olive oil and mix.. no lemon is needed 5) you can decorate with hard boiled eggs, tuna, capers or anchovies. nothing is a must..6) the best accompagnement for this is char grilled fish spiced with (salt, turmeric or saffron, little cumin, coriander, papprika, little olive oil to mix)

I served double-portions of this as a one-dish dinner. It was a good, simple weeknight supper, and we both like the mild flavors and textures.

Out of 7 ingredients, Singapore, you lacked 3! You're right - you shouldn't be reviewing the recipe. As is, it is fantastic - colourful and tasty.

I made this dish as written. It was OK. seemed to be missing something for the WOW factor that I was expecting. I love all the ingredients. Maybe The whole thing would taste better over crunchy romaine? Maybe with some fresh mint? It could be great as a sandwich.I think I miss the freshness you get with normal salads.

Having lived in Tunisia for many years this is and remains one of my favourite dishes. Best for lunch or for a light dinner during the hottest times of the year. Delicious with flat breads.

This might not be a valid review as I slightly changed the recipe owing to a lack of a few ingredients (eggs, tuna, capers). I substituted olives, chick peas and chopped parsley, and it was so delicious, and healthy! I ate it on its own for a quick lunch, but I think it would go well with barbequed/grilled lamb. It looks good too with all the different colours.
