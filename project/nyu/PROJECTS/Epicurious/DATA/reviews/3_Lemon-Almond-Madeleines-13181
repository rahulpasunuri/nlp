I have a silicone Madeleine 'pan', and I am finding they are taking a bit longer to bake than 10 minutes...but they are so good! They will be gone fast.

Outstanding recipe. I add a package of marzipan in place of the ground almonds and reduce the amt of sugar.

These are delicious and easy to make. I used 1/2 cup of blanched finely ground almonds instead and they turned out perfect.

Hmmm. I was disappointed with this recipe. I love madeleines, so I was surprised I didn't care for these because of the texture. I didn't like the looks of the ground almonds nor did I care for the texture of the almonds. IF I were to make these again I would use blanched almonds and grind them with the sugar in the same as I do when making macaroons. I buttered the pans and put them in the 'frig as others suggested and they still stuck to the pan.

This is my favorite madeleine recipe. One trick to get the butter to absorb smoothly is to take a half cup of the batter and mix it with the warm buteer and then fold all together.

I have made these many times, they are always a hit, and I love them myself.

I made these madeleines for a birthday and also for a Boy Scout meeting and they turned out wonderful! They come out best when you refrigerate the molds with the melted butter so that the butter hardens. I love the tint of almonds and the lemon rind! I would definitely make these again.

This is a very good recipe with a really good taste of almonds with the lemon. The consistency is very moist and light, as it should be. They should be consumed within two days, which was no problem.

I am still trying to figure out what a madeleine is supposed to be like. It should be firm enough to dip in your tea but these seemed a little dry. Also think there is a typo where it calls for "minced" lemon extract. Is there a missing ingredient here?
