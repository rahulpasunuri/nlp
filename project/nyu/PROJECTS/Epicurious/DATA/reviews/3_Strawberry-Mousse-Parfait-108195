Not interesting and not worth the time and extra dishes to wash. To get the same flavor, just serve your sliced and sugared berries with real whipped cream layered like a parfait. Just as good and much easier.

This mousse was a great success as a cake filling and got rave reviews. I made it and filled the cake 48 hours ahead of serving, but that's probably about as far as you can go...I will admit that it had lost its freshness and was a little "wet" at that point. The chunks of fresh strawberries (from the mashing, not from the diced strawberries, which I didn't add) had begun to weep a bit by then. I don't think I would make this more than a day ahead in the future, but it was delicious, very pretty, and held up well within that window.

I didn't bother with the parfait aspect; I made the mousse as a test filling for a cake I'm planning. So far, so good. It really is delicious--very similar to good strawberry ice cream, and even better the next day. It is firm without being rubbery, and so far, no weeping. I think I might cut back on the lemon juice a tiny bit next time, and it did seem to need a bit more sugar. Superfine sugar makes this even easier. And yes, why wouldn't you (at least) double the recipe? I'll post again after I make the cake but I think this will be a success as a filling.

I like this recipe except I must have done something wrong because the gelatin did not dissolve properly. Make sure you follow the recipe very carefully when you make the mousse.Otherwise, it tasted nice.

This is a great light summery dessert. I couldn't find butter cookies (????), so I just bought butter wafers and served the mousse in a martini glass with the wafer stuck in. Very pretty!

Straight-forward, classic strawberrie parfait. Very nice summer recipe, my only hint is do not mix cookies and parfait until just ready to serve, or the cookies will get soggy.

Did not like the way recipe written. What's with 1 1/3 c. "from" 6oz? gelatin "FROM" 1 envelope? Glad I measured; envelopes I had held more than 1 1/2 tsp; who cares where the gelatin came from? Also the flavor was not impressive; whipped cream seemed to overpower the strawberries (maybe mine weren't sweet enough?). I maybe would have used strawberry jello. Too much fuss for the result.

This was OK. I don't understand why they would write this recipe for ONE serving. Who would go thru the trouble of making this for only one person? And if you were only making it for yourself, wouldn't you want some for tomorrow too? Anyway, the sweetness of this is HEAVILY dependant on the sweetness of your strawberries. If you have tart berries, add more sugar. Also, definitely sweeten the whipped cream for the top. If you double (or quadruple like I did) this recipe it will take longer to set the mixture in the water bath, so plan on a little more time. And lastly, I used way more butter cookies to get a solid layer rather than just a sprinkling. Try the Key Lime Parfaits from this site. Even easier to make and way better! (Maybe could be adapted to turn into strawberry parfaits?)

Note:recipe as given is for ONE serving. I had to double it for the girlfriend and myself. A little tricky, but not bad. Only complaint is that I would sweeten the whipped cream top layer a bit. Strawberries with unsweetened whipped cream was good..a few teaspoons of sugar would make it lovely.

I made this dessert (in clear plastic cups) for a picnic at a horse show. It was so easy to prepare and a light, not too sweet way to end the meal. And, as it turned out, it travels well!
