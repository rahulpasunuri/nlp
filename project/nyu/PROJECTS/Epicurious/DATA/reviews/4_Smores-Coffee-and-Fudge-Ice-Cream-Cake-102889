I have been making this dessert since 2000 when I first saw it in the magazine. It is one of my favorite desserts. I make it every year for Christmas and enjoy the leftovers! It is easy and everyone loves it.

This is an outstanding dessert! Everyone LOVED it and wanted the recipe! I used whatever ice cream flavors I had in the freezer and made sure that the ice cream got very hard when making it...some brands don't harden up as much as others. Make your own sauce...it makes it even more special!

I made this cake for my Boyfriend's birthday. Everyone LOVED it. When I made it I rushed a bit and did not allow the layers to set in the freezer, when it was finished it had a slight marble look when cut. It was so good I am making it again for a July 4th BBQ!!

I made this cake for my son's birthday and it was a huge success! The adults enjoyed it equally, if not more, than the kids! Next time I will allow more freezing time between layers. The taste was incredible! Starbucks coffee ice cream had a great consistency.

This looks complicated to make, but it really is easy and it's a showstopper when you cut into it. Super-sweet and super-rich. Try it.

i made extra graham crackers because i like a thicker crust and thought it came out nice, but the marshmallow is hard as a rock when eaten again. are you not supposed to have leftovers? Are you supposed to put it in the broiler each time you are going to eat it?

The kids who ate this ice cream cake, could barely indicate their thanks for the dessert as they were too busy licking their lips. The adults seemed to enjoy it too, but I wouldn't serve at anything other than a casual barbeque.
