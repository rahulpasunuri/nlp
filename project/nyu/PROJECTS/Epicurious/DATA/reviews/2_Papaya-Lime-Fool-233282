I liked this recipe. I used a perfectly ripe fresh papaya which has much more flavor than a supermarket one and only half the sugar. I garnished with fresh mint. The fool had a delicate velvety texture and was a lovely finish to our meal. It was incredibly easy to prepare. I'll definitely make it again.

This was not great. It was kind of bland and dull, really lacking in flavour - and I don't think this was due to cooks' error! Won't be making it again.

This was pretty good. I had a left over papaya from making papaya brie quesadillas (SO MUCH BETTER use of papaya). It's basically a papaya flavored heavy whipped cream you eat with a spoon. Fun to try, but I don't think I'll be making it again.
