I too have been making this for years. All of my friends mourned when our favorite deli closed and took along their house made tapenade. Now we all agree that this one is even better. My favorite way to have it is with a soft mild goat cheese on seeded baguette slices, or sliced English cucumbers. Wonderful! P.S. yes, skip the anchovies if you're vegetarian, but otherwise, they add a ton of flavor.

I skip the anchovy fillets and use lemon zest instead of orange. Use dried thyme. It always turns out delicious.

I first made this recipe about 4 years ago for a party. It was a hit for people who love tapenade and for people who weren't sure they ever wanted to try tapenade. It always disappears quickly. I do add a little bit of orange juice along with the zest to give it more oomph. The combo of the flavors is truely inspired, as another reviewer said. The orange adds a definite brightness and makes this the best tapenade I've had, EV-er.

this is fantastic and will be made many more times. i did it for a party this past weekend and made it two days ahead of time. the flavors blended together very nicely that way -- i would really suggest doing this. i also left out the anchovies because i'm a vegetarian, and although i have no frame of reference it still came out really nicely. several people asked for the recipe.

We loved this!! I used half Kalmata, half regular black olives and threw in some green ones just for fun. Used Anchovy paste and omitted the orange zest --- everyone loved it. I will make this again and again.

OMG! Best tapenade I have ever had! The orange zest is an inspired twist. Easy, easy, easy, and so delicious - served with croutons, yum!

Delicious! I made the recipe using half calamata olives & half California black olives, to cut down on the salt. Also used about a 2" strip of anchovy paste instead of tinned. Served with melba toast made from a thinly sliced baguette.

Wow, this is the best tapanade I've ever tasted - in fact, I had no idea tapanade could even taste this good. And it's got to be one of the easiest things to make - about two minutes from start to finish. A perfect appetizer on mini-toast or croutons!

Very good... one of the best tapenades I've had. I doubled the recipe (for gifting purposes) and used three kinds of olives; cutting the kalamatas with some other type makes it a little less salty. Anchovies, orange zest make this recipe!

The best tapenade I've ever had. Used lemon zest instead of orange. Used Moraco oil cured olives which I rinsed first. The result was salty but not overwhelming, just right. Really fantastic, pungent and briny, great with a martini!

Followed the recipe exactly, except for leaving out the orange zest. Pitting the olives was a bit time consuming - next time, I'll buy them pitted. People couldn't stop eating it; just don't tell them it has anchovies in it!

This is great with goat cheese as a nice, bland foil for all that salt (and I agree, by the way, that tapenade is supposed to be strong and salty--a friend of mine calls tapenade the "human salt lick." But a little does go a long way). The touch of orange zest is unusual and good.

Excellent! Made this without anchovies for my vegetarian friends - they loved it. Very easy and fast to make.

Used anchovy paste instead of the whole filets, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Served it, along with some goat cheese, over roasted asparagus, then made bruschetta with it a couple of days later. Incredibly veratile and SO good. Will definitely make again -

I have made a few olive tapenades and this is one of the best. Despite having soaked the anchovies, I did find it was a quite salty (even accounting for the saltiness of tapenades)....but it wasn't so much so as to not make it worthwhile. One day I mixed it with cream, fresh parsley, and pecorino with pasta and it turned out well.

I loved this for its authenticity.Yes, tapenade is salty. But it's a condiment, meant mainly as a spread on toasted baguette slices, or crackers, or to season grilled meat or fish. Used sparingly on foods that are unsalted, it tastes just as it was meant to.

I made this recipe a few nights ago to accompany some grilled grouper. It was wonderful. The only change I made was the addition of one tablespoon dijon mustard. I did not find it too salty. Tapanade is always very strong. We have been eating the leftovers on everything since. Grilled chicken, roast pork, brushetta, etc. I think I will keep some of this on hand in the fridge to liven up anything from now on.

Suspecting that this would be much too salty as written, I made a few adjustments: used tinned California black olives(much milder and less salty than Kalamata and I DO LIKE THEM for selected recipes despite the negative comments in the taster's notes, however, each to his own!), only used 2 anchovies, reduced oil by 1 tbsp and added 2 tbsp. fresh lemon juice. The resulting tapenade was lovely served with toasted/garlic rubbed baguette slices and pre-dinner champagne.

Mixed feelings here. Follwed recipe almost to the letter.Soaked anchovies in milk, patted dry. Rinsed (kalamata) olives. Finished spread way too salty for almost everyone but me. I liked it. Will make again, but will leave out 1 or 2 anchovie fillets and consider a less salty olive.
