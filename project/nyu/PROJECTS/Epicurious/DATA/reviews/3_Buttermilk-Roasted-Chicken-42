I had left over buttermilk and wanted to marinade chicken with it. Using this recipe I must thank the reviewers for mentioning additional ingredients. I just poured some soy sauce, dijon, and some minced garlic into the mix; no measuring, just til it tasted good. This is yummy, and great with white rice and green beans. So, we can thank this recipe for getting us started!

Nigella knows: In her HOW TO EAT cookbook she does a version of this with Dijon mustard, garlic and soy sauce. It is by far the best roast chicken I've ever made and return to it time and time again.

simple recipe. I put plenty of fresh cracked pepper and sea salt and that gave the chicken sufficient seasoning

Well, marinating in buttermilk certainly makes chicken juicy and tender but does almost nothing for the flavor. I love ultra-simple recipes but this one is a bit too bland.

Not at all impressed. I wish I had looked at the reviews and done it Nigellas way.

Incredibly bland, even though I added fresh, minced garlic, hot sauce and thyme to the buttermilk. Amazingly tender... but, IMO, a waste of an organic chicken. Will not repeat.

I went with the suggestion of an earlier reviewer who included a few additions from Nigella/NYTimes: > Husband raved. The chicken got very brown early on so I tented it with foil. Juicy and fragrant.

Nigella published a version of this recipe in the NY Times last summer. But the buttermilk marinade was 2 C buttermilk, 1/4 C vegetable oil, 2 cloves garlic, 1 TBLSP ground pepper, 1 TBLSP salt, 2 TBLSP fresh chopped rosemary and 1 TBLSP honey. I love the taste of the herb and garlic infusion. My family has enjoyed it equally roasted and grilled. Steph

Marinated as Nigella suggested. The Chicken got very brown after 33 minutes, so I tented with foil. I baked potatoes in the same oven. Plan to make the twice baked potatoes with goat cheese (from this site) to accompany the chicken. The chicken was a lovely brown, very juicy. I agree that it may need a bit more zip, but I will keep experimenting.

Like the other reviewers, I also added to the buttermilk. Herbs, some honey and pepper. I let sit for two days. Drained, patted dry and rubbed a little compound herb butter under breast skin and over the top. Outstanding and fool proof.

The cook who recommended Nigella Lawson's recipe is right--that recipe has got it going on! The chicken needs some spices to marinade in other than the buttermilk, for love's sake!! I used the rest of the carton of buttermilk to make delicious biscuits to serve with the chicken--yummy!!

Use Nigella LAwson's recipe: Butterfly the chicken, use 2 C buttermilk, 1/4 C coarsely chopped rosemary, 2T honey, 1/4C oil and 1T crushed peppercorns. The herbs,honey etc. make it absolutely delicious. The only way I will make roast chicken going forward.

Surprised it was not better. Have marinated chicken pieces in white vinegar before, which is great. For better roasted chicken, I will just stick with my plain chicken with heavy salt and pepper before roasting.

The chicken was wonderfully moist. I added a sprinkling of herbs on top but be sure to tent the chicken with foil so the herbs do not burn.

This is an ok recipe, the chicken is very moist, but needs some herbs to add to flavor.
