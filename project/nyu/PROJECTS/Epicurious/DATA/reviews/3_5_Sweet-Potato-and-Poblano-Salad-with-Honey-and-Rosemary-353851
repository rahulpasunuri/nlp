I love this recipe--have used it multiple times for many dinner parties and just for my family. It is absolutely delicious--I do not grill the sweet potatoes, I roast them after cutting them up in chunks just because grilling is more of a hassle for me. They turn out great. I have even added quinoa to this and it adds wonderful texture.

This is very good; even better than I thought it would be. I forgot fresh rosemary at the store and substituted with dry - fresh would have been much better. Tossed the sweet potatoes wedges with olive oil and a little salt and pepper, roasted at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, turned them, roasted another 15 minutes. Used 2T of oil in the dressing as taters already had some oil on them. Roasted and peeled the poblanos, would try fresh next time to see what that's like. They were spicier than I'd expected - used two 6oz poblanos, would use total of 8oz next time as recipe recommends (my dude is not so big on spice).

Fabulous salad and everyone at the table raved! Such a nice change from regular potato salad. Next time I will grill the poblanos for more of a roasted flavor. Otherwise, will do everything as written.

Would not make again

Didn't go over well with the crowd - made double. Lot of labor boiling then grilling potatoes and hard to get good cross between mush and too firm. Flavors were interesting but a it weird together for our taste.

I had sweet potatoes in mind when i was ready to cook tonite and wanted a healthy way to make them. This fit the bill. Made it with jalapeno pepper and we like the crunch with our softer potatoes. Based on the reviews we are looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow. Didn't have time for the refrigerator part but it was not an issue. This will be a regular part of our summer dinner plans. Loved it!

I made this yesterday the flavors were great. I also roasted the pepper. I served it with a grilled pork roast. Everyone loved it.

This was delicious! Everyone liked it. The second time I made it I doubled the recipe. I couldn't find poblanos so I substituted jalapenos.

If it was just me I'd give it 4 forks, but my daughter wasn't thrilled. I am making it as a staple regularly instead of potato salad for lunch. It has low starch content and high nutrition!

Yummy! I roasted the sweet potatoes instead of grilling. I also roasted the pepper. The dressing was so good. My husband doesn't even like sweet potatoes and he enjoyed this dish. Great flavor overall. The honey/rosemary combo worked very well in contrast with the poblano. I will be making it again.

This was so good. My husband doesn't really care for sweet potatoes, but went nuts for this. I made double the recipe as suggested, boiled the potatoes partially, then finished them up on the grill. I also grilled the chile. Excellent.

I should've paid more attention to the reviews. I wish that I had roasted the poblanos. Even though I diced them the crunch that they gave to the salad was too distracting for me. I roasted the sweet potatoes and switched out parsley for cilantro. The honey-rosemary thing is delicious. I'll make this again with revisions. I think it's going to be a keeper.

Got back from my family reunion...this recipe is a keeper. Everyone seemed to like it a lot!

This recipe was nice, but maybe next time I'll just roast the sweet potatoes rather than grill them. I didn't have any poblanos so I used one jalapeno pepper instead. This is a nice side dish...I liked the way the sweetness of the honey and the rosemary worked together. Bringing it to a family reunion...I liked it...we'll see if anyone else likes it!

I liked this better the second day but that may be because I squeezed fresh lime juice on it. Also, roasted potatoes in oven instead of grilling, and used cilantro instead of parsley. Didn't grill poblano either, just cut it up and threw it in. This way it was much less work than others say and not bad overall.

This salad rocks and is totally worth the effort. I grilled the poblanos along with the potatoes. No need to peel. I was out of green onion and used purple the second time..still great! Didn't have parsley the first time...still great! Make it the day ahead, make the dressing before you grill the yams. Put the yams in the dressing warm, chill overnight...it's just as good if not better the second day.

I can't believe I'm saying this about anything that has sweet potatoes in it, because I love them, but I thought this salad was just average. And way too much work for the final product, which I thought was tasty but not worth making again.

This is sensational!! Just the right mix of sweet and tart. I followed the recipe precisely except that I also charred the poblano on the grill and removed the skin before adding the pieces to the salad; make sure you do not overcook the potatoes when you boil them and they will hold together fine on the grill.

This is a tasty recipe. I oven-roasted the sweet potatoes, tossing them with evoo,a dash of liquid smoke, and salt and pepper. Also roasted the poblano and only used one in the salad. Added some chopped cilantro. Tossed it all with the dressing and it was delicious!

I made extra dressing, sprinkled the potatoes with cayenne pepper before grilling and cut the potatoes into a bit smaller chunks than the original recipe called for. I grilled the peppers as others did. I believe this all added to the flavor of the salad that others perceived as otherwise a bit bland. It was a lot of work, but tasted delicious and something different to bring to a bbq! I would definitely make it again.

an interesting and tasty side dish. eqch of the flavors comes across cleanly; my family loved the dressing. we always have a ready supply of grilled poblanos in the summer, so used those.

This salad was delicious. I too, grilled the poblanos and green onions for added flavor. Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make this again..maybe with the addition of some fresh corn and cherry tomatoes.

The overall taste was not worth the effort. The dressing was very good but the chilis did not add the bite I was expecting in this dish. I would not make again.

The dressing was amazing; the salad: so- so. I was expecting more, but even with grilling the pablanos along with the potatoes, I just was expecting a little more.

Excellent variation on potato salad - did not feel poblanos added much but may have been better if they had been grilled as suggested by others. I would also add the importance of mixing dressing onto potatoes while they are still warm so they will soak up the flavors! Other additions to consider: halved cherry tomatoes, corn, green beans, bacon and/or roasted red peppers or poblanos.

Delicious! HUGE hit with the family and the kids were fighting over the leftovers today.

Made this for Father's Day along with the Coffee-rubbed burgers. Wow! Great meal. The flavors all worked so well together. This salad, however, would go well with most summer meals. I made this the night before. There was just the right amount of dressing. It added some flavor without overpowering the flavors of the veggies. The poblanos also added a delightful crunch.

Forgot to mention in my previous review that I threw the poblanos and green onions on the grill with the sweet potatoes. I think this enhanced the sweet, smokey flavor and would definately do this step again. Enjoy!

I really enjoyed this. The flavor was smokey and sweet, with just a little heat. It was a great summer alternative to the traditional mayo-based potato salad. When you toss the dressing with the warm potatoes, they will absorb the dressing and all its flavors, which are fantastic. I took it to a pot luck B-B-Q and everyone raved. It was a bit time consuming, but I'd do it again!

The sweet potatoes absorbed all of the dressing. The salad had very little flavor. Grilling the potatoes took time. All in all it was not that great.

Rating: 2
Not worth the effort. The salad really did not have much flavor and it took some time to make because of the grilleing of the potatoes.
