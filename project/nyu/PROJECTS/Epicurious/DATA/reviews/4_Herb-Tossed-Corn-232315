This is delicious and simple. I decreased the butter a bit but also added some cumin to give it depth.

Served this with pork mango fajitas for my mother's birthday dinner. I used lime instead of lemon. It was excellent - very refreshing.

Big hit at 4th of July party. Was assigned a vegetable & it traveled well.

I liked this recipe and thought that it was a good, weeknight-friendly way to serve corn as a side. I used basil because that's what I had on hand, but I would use cilantro if I was serving Mexican food. We thought that it was missing something, so the addition of some corriander helped. Toasted cumin seeds would have been nice, as well. I agree that the corn you're using should be very good.

This is an awesome recipe. I've made this twice now and plan on making it all summer. Gives the corn another dimension of flavor.

I make this three or four times a week in the summer. No one can get enough of it. It is simple and perfect.

Awesome recipe. Make sure you have good corn to start with, makes all the difference. And you don't need to worry about keeping long sections of corn together, tastes just as good with individual kernels!

Excellent recipe. I skipped the lemon juice, and used fresh tarragon instead of cilantro. I would recommend mixing in the tarragon right before you serve the dish.

Made it this weekend and it was a big hit with everyone. We grilled the corn instead of boiling it. Love that extra flavor.

A simple but nice summertime dish, when the corn is sweet and fresh! I love to serve the freshest seasonal veggies to guests, but corn on the cob can be kind of a mess (and cobs aren't a very customizable portion size!) Cutting the kernels is a labor of love (it's like cooking for a crowd of kids with braces), but the results were very nice side, that won't upstage a main dish. I cut down a little on the butter. Lime would work well instead of the lemon.
