So so salad - good vinaigrette and snap peas are always tasty. Don't go out of your way to try.

This was one of the easiest, best tasting salads we've had all summer! I doubled the parsley, omitted chervil (didn't have any) and blended the herbs into the dressing. I also thinly sliced the endive spears, tossed them and the peas with the dressing before topping with the extra cheese (We served the dinner family style). There were no leftovers, I can't wait to make it again.
