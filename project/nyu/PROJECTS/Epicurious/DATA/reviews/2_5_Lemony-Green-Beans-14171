I loved this recipie thought I tweaked it somewhat. I cooked the beans for about 2 minutes longer with the oil and lemon zest, and I served it with lemon salt. Very simple, and good.

I liked -- not loved -- this dish, but it was so easy and perfect for a summer meal that I would definitely recommend it.
