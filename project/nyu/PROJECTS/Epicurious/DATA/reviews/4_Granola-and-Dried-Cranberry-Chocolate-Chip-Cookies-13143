This is the 3rd year I've made these for Christmas. I put them in Christmas cellophane bags and give them for gifts along with my husbands beef jerky (Alton Brown's recipe using a box fan). I add 1/2 cup flaked coconut to the recipe since I'm a coconut fan. The recipe is easily doubled. They are absolutely delish!

These couldn't have gone together more quickly or turned out better. I had a bunch of "granola dust" (Trader Joe's Vanilla-Almond) that wasn't getting eaten so, despite being a bit concerned that it was too much "dust" and not enough "chunk," I went ahead and made these. I skipped the cranberries and chocolate chips and instead added Heath toffee bits (about 1/3 C.). I used my 1.5 Tbs. ice cream scoop and pre-scooped 15 large cookies onto parchment paper, smooshed the tops down a bit then chilled them for a few hours to avoid too much spreading. They baked for about 16 minutes and are a perfect thin, chewy, golden, crispy-on-the-edges, 3 1/2"-4" cookie. Next time I'll double the recipe and use up all of the granola dust!

Great recipe that has become my standard for chocolate chip cookies! I prefer the cookies as they are (crispy and chewy), but my recipients like softer cookies, so I increased the baking powder to 1/2 tsp. In addition, I used this recipe as the basis for maple nut cookies by using maple brown sugar granola, substituting 1 tbsp maple syrup for the vanilla extract, and adding 1/2 walnuts instead of the cranberries and chocolate chips.

I made these cookies for my daughter to take to Burning Man. I always make a few pounds of my home-made granola for her to take. This time I made my granola and use it to make these cookies. I used a convection oven and make and baked according to the recipe here. I baked a test cookie at 350 in this convection oven. The temp. was too high. I made another test cooked and pressed down the dough before baking and baked at 320 and they came out nice. Chewing in the center. I prefer crisp cookies but my daughter and her friends likes these. For me they were too sweet. I would reduce the amount of sugar next time.

A great twist to the chocolate chip cookie. I used toffee granola from our local organic market and used dried cherries instead of cranberries. Next time will use a few more cherries and a little less chocolate. I only got the tangy cherry bites once in a while. A big hit among my picky friends.

Really good. I made it with a pecan cranberry granola and caramel-milk chocolate ships. Yum, yum!

great cookie. it is like a chocolate chip and an oatmeal wrapped up in one. chewy and crisp! i love it

So great! I used chocolate granola and I think I could have reduced the amount of chocolate chips. I also used bittersweet chips, which I prefer to semisweet. I used parchment paper on my baking sheets instead of butter and the cookies baked perfectly.

I skipped the dried cranberries just out of personal taste, and the recipe is great. I would probably use less chocolate chips next time or make some more batter. I also used maple pecan granola which went really well with the brown sugar flavor. Very tasty!

I used vanilla- almond granola and a bit of cinnamon and cardomom. i also used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white. Couldn't tell the difference, I think because there's so little batter! I made the cookies small and pushed them down a bit. For anyone that has trouble with them sticking- invest in a Silpat- it will change your cookie baking!

Lovely combination of ingredients, but my cookies spread in the oven like mad, and then I could barely pry them off my buttered cookie sheet. The ones that I could successfully chip off the sheet tasted ok. Believe it or not, I will probably try these again and will add maybe a litte more flour or consider using 1/2 veg. shortening or something to combat spreading.

I love these cookies and make them all the time. Note that "granola" is a pretty wide category. Sometimes I make them with a coconut/almond granola that I get from the bulk bins at Whole Foods and the oats are more separated (but still crunchy). Other times I use a more traditional granola that has small crunchy clusters. There are all kinds of granola flavors, and so far I think they all work! Yum.

i just finished making these, and they were delicious! i only used about 1 cup of granola and 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. perfect balance of salty/sweet and soft/crispy. the boyfriend loved them too! will be making again!

Great cookies with or without chocolate chips. It only took 10 minutes in my oven.

Yum! I doubled the cranberries and used mini-chocolate chips. Next time (probably today!) I will do half the chocolate chips. Otherwise perfect.

These were wonderful, but I couldn't get the chocolate to melt enough to drizzle correctly. Can anyone give me any tips? I tried both white and dark chocolate.

This recipe was great. I liked the combo of chocolate and cranberries better than I thought I would. They turned out chewy and delicious. Made exactly 10 big cookies.

These were so good! What a great way to use up granola - or any cereal for that matter. I was worried because there was so much "stuff" that there was hardly any dough - but they turned out really well. Still soft in the middle and oozing with chocolatey goodness....mmmmmmm It's a small recipe so double it if you have a big family.

The best cookies: Tollhouse Choc chip recipe (on the back of the bag); replace the nuts with oats, and add 1/2 to 1 cup of dried cranberries. Heaven!

I used a combination of the crunchy cereals I had available--Meusli, Just Right, and light granola, and it was wonderful. Not too sweet at all, especially with the less sweet cereals.

These are great cookies, I have made them for many years and everyone loves them. People here really love the dried cranberries. I usually leave the chocolate chips out as I think they make the cookies a little too sweet.

Rating: 3
Very easy to make, although the texture of the granola in the cookie was a little hard. The cranberries are barely noticable; you may want to add a bit more cranberries, if you like a fruity bite. These turned out decent; not sure if I'd make again.

I substituted whole wheat flour for half the flour. The cookies held up wonderfully, and they taste great, too!

I love finding a new recipe I'm confident adding to my files. This is a great one! All flavors stay true after baking. I too am going to work on possibly adding more flour (?) to keep the edges from getting too thin...but really no other complaints. I took these out of the oven when the edges were just barely light brown - and that was perfect timing.

Excellent cookie. Very good flavor, although I imagine it can vary quite a bit depending on the granola you use. My local Whole Foods has a whole wall of bulk granola choices, so I went with a coconut almond version that worked really well in these cookies. They do come out very thin -- I wonder how to modify the recipe to make them a little thicker and chewier?

I felt it was fate that I found this recipe on the same day I made granola! It's so easy. I use dried blueberries in my granola but I didn't really taste them in the cookie. The first batch didn't spread much so I made the second batch a bit larger and I only got about 24 total. I don't think these will last long!

This is a great recipe. It's very simple and fairly foolproof. Like the others, I was careful not to overcook them (it only took about 12-13 min on 350degrees). I also used generic granola and they came out wonderful. I highly recommend this recipe. Enjoy!

This easy cookie has become a staple around the house, everybody that tries them loves 'em! I don't skimp on the granola, cranberries, or chocolate...throw in a handfull of chopped nuts too, why not? The dough may seem to dry...but they'll be just fine!

This is a great, easy cookie to make. I made these cookies for a bake sale, and they were the first cookies gone. I'm going to try them once without the chocolate chips, for a healthier and different taste.

The cookies turned out awesome, they weren't too sweet and the combination of the tartness of dried cranberries and chocolate chips resulted in a great flavor. They were easy to make too!!

I liked this a lot. I used low fat cinnamon granola, raisins, and only 1/4 cup of chocolate chips (but used dark chocolate.) I also cut the butter in half and added same amount of applesauce instead. Came out great!

It was so easy and very delicious! The only comment I would make is when you mix the brown sugar and butter if it's not fluffy don't worry about it, it will still turn out great.

Made these for my dad for Thanksgiving ... :o) He loved 'em ... but what's not to love? Chocolate, crunchiness and a burst of tart cranberries. Took less than 15 minutes to mix 'em up. They're great!

This is a very delicious and easy recipe. I use low fat granola and substituted dried cherries for the cranberries.

These cookies were simply delicious. They had a wonderful texture and offer a great alternative to the regular old chocolate variety. Next time around, I will add a little more cranberries than directed.

These are a nice variation on the typical toll house cookie. I do think it's a bit oversweet, next time I'll use unsweetened granola, that should help. A great cookie that doesn't last long at our house!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I was surprised that these cookies didn't have much flavor. However, I baked these cookies for about 20 minutes, because they look doughy when they baked for 10 minutes. As a result, I could of dried them out. I also used a no name brand of granola.

this is a very good cookie. I made them a bit larger - about 2 tablespoons - and it took about 19 mins to cook. The bottoms didn't burn though.

Try it with white chocolate chips--it's delicious that way. If you substitute dried cherries for cranberries, use dark chocolate chunks.

These cookies were too good! I made them so that my dad and uncles could take them on their rafting trip, I was truly bummed to have to give these away. Be careful with your cooking time, mine only took about 11 minutes to cook. I would imagine that these lovely morsels could burn and dry out easily. Take 'em out of the oven when you see the bottoms just starting to turn brown. Also, I used dried cherries instead of cranberries.

This was a nice version of a Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe. I made 2 batches and found that for the 2nd batch I used less of the Granola and a little more (1/2 cup total) of the dried cranberries. Also the cooking time is 12-15 minutes, not inches... just a typo.

This is a nutritious and very flavorful cookie. I will make it again for sure.
