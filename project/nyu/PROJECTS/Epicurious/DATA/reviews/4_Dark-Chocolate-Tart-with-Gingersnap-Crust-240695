Everything about this recipe as written says that it ought to be amazing, but we found it rather ho-hum -- fatty without the mouthfeel and flavor we wanted.

After reading the other reviews about it being too "boring," I loaded ground ginger (total of probably 2 tsp) into the chocolate mixture along with a few shakes of cayenne pepper. It was really zippy a few hours after coming out of the oven but mellowed out after 24 hours. I paired it with some homemade passionfruit ice cream and homemade blackberry sauce. DELISH!

Just as delicious if not as edgy to omit the most of the ginger and all of the pepper. Texture is wonderful and my god there is ample chocolate in that thing! Bananas, caramel and/or cardamon whipped cream would also complement the tart well.

I'v emade this twice and both times there was liquid on the pan when I took it out of the oven. Not sure what this was from but it sure is weird. Tart was delicious.

I have made this tart several times (with a few variations), as it is easy to prepare, and good. Also, it freezes exceptionally well, which makes it ideal if you are trying to prepare for a party in advance. The variations: I use both crystallized ginger, and Maldon salt on the top of the tart, and I add hazelnuts to the crust. (I prefer to use Anna's Ginger cookies for the crust). The recipe is great as is, but I prefer more flavor contrasts.

Suitable for guests and relatively easy. Used choc and gingersnaps from Trader Joes as had been suggested.

This was tasty but not amazing. The chocolate filling doesn't taste like anything besides chocolate, which is obviously still delicious but not as exciting as I'd hoped. The crystallized ginger does make for a delicious contrast and bite with the chocolate, but I'd rather spend less time and money to make something combining these flavors.

Bad presentation. The crust falls apart. Extremely expensive to make. It tastes ok, but this is a given if you use good chocolate. I couldn't taste the pepper at all, it just tastes like whatever chocolate you use.

Very nice recipe. Used Trader Joe's gingersnaps...I think they really make the difference do to the crystalized ginger in them. Very pretty presentation. Was a big hit. Very easy to make...will make again.

A note on how many gingersnaps are needed for the crust: If you use the relatively thick gingersnaps, i.e., Nabisco, the recipe's proportions are perfect as is. If you use thin gingersnaps, i.e., Anna's, you will need to add at least 50% more (but don't need more butter).

I have made this recipe three times now and received rave reviews and requests for the recipe each time. It is simple and easy to make and looks and tastes like you went to a lot more trouble than you actually did. I use just slightly less sugar than the recipe calls for, removing about one tablespoon of sugar from the quarter cup measure. I like this type of dessert just slightly less sweet than the recipe calls for. I use the ginger wafer cookies from Trader Joes (they have the candied ginger baked into them) and the crust is excellent and their sweetness against the less sweet chocolate is perfect. I uae El Rey or Callebaut bittersweet chocolate from Whole Foods and have found them both to be "no fail". Enjoy and be prepared to share the recipe when they all ask for it.

This tart made an excellent Valentine's Day dessert. Because a number of reviewers said there wasn't enough ginger, I grated about 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger into the cream, heated it and steeped it for about 30 minutes, then strained. I thought the ginger flavor came through, although my husband said that all he could taste was chocolate.

This was amazing and devoured with ecstatic groans by everybody at a dinner party last night. Followed recipe exactly except for making half again as much crust - perfect amount (thank you other reviewers). Next time I would add a little more pepper (couldn't taste it at all) and I think I'd pulverize some crystallized ginger in with the crust to add more tang to it. I will definitely be making this again - heavenly!

Made this for Christmas, substituting raspberries for the crystallized ginger. Awesome, and easy! Next time I'll add a raspberry drizzle.

This was the most beautiful and delicious holiday dessert, and so easy to prepare. The black pepper made it extra good, and a little whipped cream garnish made it perfect.

For a Christmas dessert, substitute crushed candy canes for the chopped ginger. Whipped cream is a must with this dessert!

The tart is fantastic by itself. The ginger was subtle (I used Trader Joe's uncrystallized) and the chips and ginger did fall to the bottom of the tart but one bite still provided all the flavors. The coffee taste was not evident but I didn't make the whip cream or the pears. For a party it would work to make the tart in muffin tins for bite sized desserts.

Rating: 3
The texture was nice as was the crust, however I felt the crystalised ginger competed too much with the other subtle flavours.

Rating: 4
this tart is sooooooo good! as good as anything you'd get in a restaurant, and quite easy to make. the filling is super rich and creamy, so some whipped cream on the side works well with this. i also used trader joe's triple ginger cookies for the crust, which gave it an extra kick. yum!

A friend made this last Christmas, sprinkling dried cherries on the crust before adding the filling and omitting the ginger on top. It was heavenly!! I made her variation this Christmas and it was a big hit again. I would definitely make this one again!!!

I first made this recipe for a last minute gathering requesting a "chocolate" dessert. This was so easy to make and tastes like a true gourmet dessert. It is decadent.

Not a chocolate eater myself, but took these to Christmas dinner party at friends....was told they were good! Instead of 9" tart, I used tartlet pan to make individual bites, which then yielded over a cup of extra sauce - which has been frozen to be used over ice cream or other dessert at a later date. Next time, to yield 24 tartlets, I will use same recipe for crust, but cut sauce in half.

I served this to my family for Christmas and it was a hit! I omitted the ginger, opting for raspberries around the crust instead. Their tartness and texture played well off the intense chocolate. This tart will easily serve 16... just a little sliver is really all you can handle! Doubled the crust and it was just enough.

This is a phenomenal dessert to serve to a group of chocoholics... It flopped when I took it to a dinner party at a friends, however, because the meal before it was so rich. The tart has a rich, dark, chocolate flavour. The consistency is similar to slightly chilled butter. A very tiny sliver is all anyone could possibly stomach and one guest barely made it to his second bite... Delicious but proceed with caution. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to give it a more Christmas like feel and I thought it paired well with the ginger.

Excellent recipe. Easily 12 servings; maybe even 16. So rich that a side of whipped cream is a must.

Very very good. Used Trader Joe's Triple Ginger Gingersnap cookies and their Uncrystalized ginger. Really well received. OH - I made one and a half times the crust --- really glad I did.

Delicious! I used Anna's Ginger Thins, which are spicier than most ginger snaps, and substituted unsweetened chocolate for about 2 ounces of the chocolate.

Wonderful recipe! The pepper and ginger offer a unique twist on the traditional chocolate dessert. I agree with the previous post on versatility - you can omit the pepper and ginger and add any other flavors you like. I'd recommend shortbread cookies for the crust with a hint of mint in the chocolate filling.

This is really easy and good. Very chocolaty and rich... almost too much if there is such a thing. You'll need a big glass of milk with this! I loved the crust just the way its written.

This tart is easy to make and tastes fantastic. The candied ginger and ginger snaps are a good counterpoint to the rich chocolate.

Ingredient tips: 1. Trader Joe's Pound Plus Bittersweet Chocolate Bar for the filling 2. Trader Joe's Triple Ginger Snap Cookies for the crust

This is a very nice recipe which is extremely versatile. You can omit the pepper and ginger and it's a blank slate for all your chocolate dreams. I've tried it with a shortbread cookie crust with 1/4 t cinnamon and toasted hazlenuts on top.

This was fabulous! Very smooth and velvety - impt to serve at room temp. I, too, added more gingersnaps and butter for the crust; would have liked a stronger ginger flavor in the crust - maybe I didn't use good gingersnaps. Next time I will use more crystallized ginger - wonderful conterpoint to the rich chocolate. Couldn't detect the pepper at all. I may also try a ganache topping next time as suggested by other reviewers. This is definitely more than 10 servings - very rich, can only eat a sliver.

Perfect for entertaining: simple to prepare (ahead of time); looks impressive to serve; and tastes amazing. If there are any leftovers, you're going to need to bring them to work to get them out of the house (unless you have far more willpower than I do). I made as directed, with high quality chocolate. Great flavor combo, especially for a fall/winter meal.

I made this last night for a group of friends and they all asked for the recipe. It was delicious -- very chocolately and rich, but not too heavy. I would definitely make this again, possibly with more gingersnaps in the crust.

A fabulous, relatively simple and very impressive dessert that I made for Christmas Eve dinner to round off the whole menu in the December issue of Bon Appetit. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and multiplied the crust by one and a half. Everyone loved the tart although some brushed off the ginger (and I polished off those pieces!). I will definitely make this recipe again.

One of the best chocolate desserts I've ever eaten. The chocolate and crystallized ginger combination with the gingersnap crust is EXCELLENT! Make sure that you're using crystallized (sugared) ginger. And it makes for a beautiful presentation, too.

I made this tart for dessert on Christmas day. Everyone loved it. It was very easy to make too. We served it with Peppermint ice cream. I did skip the crystallized ginger. I will definitely make this again.

This was very rich but delicious. I increased the amount of cookies and butter used for the crust as suggested by another reviewer and was glad I did. I also added a thin layer of ganache to the top of the baked tart before adding the candied ginger and thought that added alot as well. My family didn't care for the candied ginger...I think it is totally a personal preference thing. All in all, a great, easy, and elegant dessert!!

Will definitely make again. One thing that both myself and my guests commented on, were that the crust could be thicker--will add more cookies next time. This tart received rave reviews--I had to make copies of the recipe for my guests.

Great ingredients, but a taste that just didn't work. Maybe the chocolate and the ginger canceled each other out because the taste was bland. I was embarassed to serve it.

I made this for a dinner party. I am not a huge chocolate or ginger person, but this is FABULOUS! Very yummy, and great for winter. Serve a little warm (not too warm or it will melt!). I upped the ginger to 3 tbl, and it was still only mildly gingery-not overwhelming at all!

Very good. I served it at room temp per the recipe instructions and that was just right. Velvety texture. Was a little disappointed in the ginger flavor. Next time I will add some ginger to the filling for a more intense taste. Will also increase the black pepper a little.

Very good, but very chocolaty. Almost too much. You need to serve only tiny slivers. I'll might make it again, but it would have to be for chocoholics.

And another thing! It's very dense when cold so be sure to bring it to room temperature before serving. I thought it was best when I gently warmed a leftover slice in the microwave.

This was great! I drizzled a ganache over the top to help keep the candied ginger in place. Be generous with the ginger, it livens up the heavy chocolate. Next time I will try it with toasted hazelnuts instead of ginger for a new twist!

Wow! This is a wonderful and quite rich dessert. Tiny slivers were a perfect way to end a meal.
