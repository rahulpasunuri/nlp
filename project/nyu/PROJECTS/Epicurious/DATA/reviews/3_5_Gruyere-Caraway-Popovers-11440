Buggy recipie...no butter in Ingredients. What do you do with the other half of the batter?

Like the last reviewer the write up on the recipe is missing information. Food-TV just re-printed this recipe. The recipe calls for 1 tablespoon melted butter. It also states to "divide half of the batter among the tins and sprinkle 1/4 cup of Gruyere and whole caraway seeds over popovers. Then top with the remainder of batter." I baked these using a convection oven and they turned out well. They got rave reviews and I will definately make them again, a keeper.

I think something is missing here. The recipe calls for butter but none is listed in the ingredient list. I looked at other popover recipes and tried to adapt this. Mine turned out small and heavy, but had good flavor.

I have made these popovers numerous times over the years and they are still consistently the absolute best for a special meal.
