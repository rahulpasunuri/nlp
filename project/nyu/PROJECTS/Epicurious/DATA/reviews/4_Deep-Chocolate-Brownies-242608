To say these brownies are decadent is an understatement. They are SERIOUSLY rich. Nevertheless they are phenomenal. Possibly the best brownie I've ever had. Moist, dense and *intensely chocolatey* ... A little goes a loooong way. Highly recommend.

Made these once following the recipe and while they were very good when I made them again I made a couple of changes. I didn't have bittersweet chocolate the second time around so used semi sweet chocolate instead and decided to give adding some chocolate chips a whirl to see how that affected the taste. I used dark chocolate chips and added a cup to the prepared batter. Increased the cooking time just a bit and boy were they good. Took them to a ball game and I think they were gone in about 10 minutes. You can't cut these very big, really rich and decadent.

Delicious! Moist, fudge and cake-like all at the same time, I love these! I made these last night for a BBQ adding 1 cup of chopped walnuts. I will definitely make these again!

Delicious brownies. Took them to work for a morning tea and they received so many compliments and lots of people came back for second (or third) helpings. As previously reviewers mention they are very rich and moist with a gooey fudge consistency and a little bit of crumble. I will add chopped pecans or walnuts next time for some variation, but they're also great exactly as written. I baked for 30 mins exactly.

Love this recipe. Perhaps the best brownies I've ever had. Agree with the previous reviewer who advised letting them cool all the way. I tried to cut them when they were still a teensy bit warm, and they were a little gooey. When I let them cool completely, they were dense and fudgey, but not sticky. I used Baker's semisweet chocolate, which I think is around 54%. I didn't want to go over the 60% recommended in the recipe, but next time I'll try the Scharffenberger 62% semisweet and see what that does for the recipe.

I thought this recipe was a great guideline for me. I bought 4 oz of bakers chocolate and 4 oz of toasted cocoa beans from an indigenous community in Bocas Del Toro, Panama. Oreba chocolate. They give great tours if you ever want the experience! Since it is 100% cocoa, I could not find any recipes that recommended that. Most recommended using chocolate with only 60% or 70% cocoa. I added an extra 3/4 cup of sugar and only used those 8 oz of chocolate. I grated the chocolate block and broke up the toasted beans as much as possible. Then I used a double broiler to melted as much of the chocolate as possible. I added the melted mix to the batter and baked it. The toasted beans melted in the oven to give the brownies a nice texture. The brownies were really rich, even with less chocolate, and the toasted nips gave it a slight crunch (like a chocolate chip.)

We have tried many, many brownie recipes and IMO, these are the best if you like fudgy textured brownies. I made three pans recently for a friend's party and I am still receiving compliments.

I have mixed feelings about these brownies. Called "magnificent" by one man and devoured by others, they are sooo rich, really too rich. Never thought that I would say that. Must be cut into small squares and better served cold. These really are more like fudge than brownies. Used Scharfenberger 62% choclate and Droste cocoa. Easy to make, baked 30 minutes. For a truely orgasmic brownie, try the one listed on this site from Gourmet, February 2000. Think they are called fudge brownies. Interestingly enough, the ingredients are more over the top than this, but oh my God, they are wonderful. When I bite into them, I go ooh, ah. My all time favorite

I made this with dried cranberries and toasted pecans. The pecans added a lot the cranberries did not. Everyone raved about the brownies. Next time I am going to try dried cherries (instead of cranberries) similar to another recipe I have seen.

I made these to take to a party and they were quickly devoured. Everyone loved them. The key really was in getting them out of the oven at just the right moment. Just a lovely chocolatey brownie.

These brownies are excellent! I followed the directions exactly but I added 1 cup of dried cherries and 1 cup of walnuts to the batter. Moist with a nice texture--between cake and fudge. I brought these to a party among other desserts and these brownies went the fastest.

This was a great brownie recipe. I did find that a little less flour might have given a more fudge-y brownie, but honestly, so good as written.

Not so much. I followed the recipe except took suggestions to reduce the sugar. Good result but the texture and flavor are not to my liking. Very light texture. I like them dense and chewy. Also I don't recommend reducing the sugar.

Rating: 4
SOO GOOD! Made as directed. Very easy. I think it's important to let them cool completely, as hard as that is! I cut them a little too soon and they didn't seem cooked all the way thru and I was disappointed, but the next day they were perfect!

Excellent brownies! My mouth literally waters after eating one. I cut the sugar in half and used half semisweet/half bittersweet chocolate to play it safe since I made these for work. I also put powdered sugar on after the brownies cooled to make it more fun. I will definitely use all bittersweet next time.

These were excellent! I used regular Hershey's powdered chocolate since I didn't have Dutch-process and they were still wonderful.

This is the one if you're a true chocolate lover! A snap to make and the result is rich, fudgy and wonderful. I halved the sugar and used a third of a cup of brown sugar with two-third of a cup of white. Otherwise followed the recipe precisely. Wonderful.

great basic brownie recipe. I added pulverized strained chipotle, some smoked paprika, a dash of cayenne, cardamom and cinnamon and they were fantastic. the texture is definitely very fudge -- smooth and dense. I will make these again with different additions!

Modified the recipe a bit (only 1 cup of sugar and added 2/3 cup of 60% baking chocolate chips at the end with the flour instead of the chocolate powder). Got thumbs up from kids and adults alike so this will be my best brownies recipe for a while...

Rating: 4
This was decadent and so sophisticated in flavour. I halved the sugar as others suggest. I made about 2/3rds of the batter in a 9x9 pan for a friends BBQ, and put the rest in muffin cases to make about 5 cupcakes (2/3rds filled each case - still chewey on top)

awesome brownies! these are the first brownies i've made that i can say are better than the box. i made them in two 19.5 cm pie pans, since i couldn't find a 9 by 13. the top crisped a little, but overall a gooey, cakey brownie. and super easy to make!

These are the best brownies I've ever had. Rich deep chocolate flavor, definitely a sinful treat. I used 70% bittersweet chocolate and they came out great. Served with some coffee ice cream at a dinner party and folks were raving. They did take a little longer to cook than the recipe calls for. Use the tooth pick test and you'll be fine.

These are fine, but frankly, for all the chocolate, they did not strike me as particularly delectable. I would not make them again. Taste like everyone else's brownies.

I was well into making these when I discovered I had only 3 eggs. As a substitute I used some homemade applesauce, about 1/3 to 1/2 cup in total. Used good old grocery store Baker's semi-sweet chocolate with a tablespoon of cinnamon for complexity and half white/half light brown sugar. These turned out to be the fudgiest, yet ever so slightly cake-like brownies I've ever made. I don't know if they'd be to everyones liking but my kids and I love them. What a happy accident!

If you are one of those people who actually prefers box brownies to homemade, try this recipe. These brownies are intensely chocolate, rich, moist, and still good two or three days later. Quick and easy, too! My husband requested that this become the "house" brownie recipe.

I've made this recipe twice now and each time have gotten rave reviews. The brownies are the perfect blend of super fudgy in the middle with a crisp outer crust. One note - I had to bake mine for much longer than the recipe called for - - be sure to use the toothpick test!

These are FANTASTIC - dense, rich and moist. Not your fluffy brownies from a box, people. I didn't have bittersweet chocolate, so I used 4 oz. unsweetened Belgian baking chocolate and 4 oz. semi-sweet chips, and they turned out great, just the right balance of that dark chocolate-y earthiness and sweetness. These are even more delicious (if you can believe it) the next day.

My granddaughter says, "Grandma, I LOVE Chocolate! Grandma, I just can't get Chocolate off my mind!" These are the real deal. Rich, chocolatey, and the real deal. Not a quickie recipe, but the truest Brownie in that chewy wonderful chocolately way. If you have stress, you won't know it while eating these. They clean the brain of all things but JOY!

Great brownies! Who would use a box mix when you can get these in the oven in 10 minutes? I used quick release foil and had no trouble getting them out of the pan. Also, cut down sugar by 1/2 cup. I liked the richer chocolate flavor. One time I added 2 tsp. instant espresso. While delicious, with the reduced sugar, a little too strong for little kids. My oven, 25 min. exactly=perfection. Positivly at the top of the brownie rotation...for now :)

I didn't find these exciting. They are fudgy and tasty so long as you use good chocolate, but they're very thin as the recipe is written and not remarkable. I'd even suggest they have too little chocolate for that many eggs. I'll go back to my old standby fudgy brownie recipe on the back of the King Arthur Flour package- much better, thicker, denser and fudgier!

OH MY WORD -- very yummy brownies! I made these for my husband for Father's Day because he is a total choc-o-holic and he LOVED them! They are perfectly moist and chewy without being doughy. My oven required the whole 35 minutes to complete the baking. I took the advise of another reviewer and lined my pan but instead of foil, I used wax paper and not only did the brownies come out flawlessly, clean up was a BREEZE! A tip for extra yummy chocolatiness -- I sprinkled extra dark chocolate chips on top of the brownies once I spread them out in the pan before baking. Double-yum!

I actually combined this recipe with the 'triple chocolate fudge' recipe to make one awesomely fantastic brownie extravaganza. However.... I had 5 very athletic lunky teenage boys over for a baking party, so I added more sugar to make the chocolate a little more bearable for the vast amounts of the confection they would consume. Next time I would add a little more sugar (I split between brown and powdered) and treat the recipe like an actual recipe for fudge, adding the extra eggs and flower to make the brownies set up, but trying to get a very very fudgy, thick batter.

I have made these twice in one week. This will be the brownie recipe that I use now. They are easy to make and come out great. The first time I used Droste Dutch process cocoa and the second time I used Sharfenberger cocoa powder which is not Dutch process. I definately preferred the Droste. The Sharfenberger brownies came out much lighter in color, they did not have the deep fudgy color, the flavors were comporable but I still preferred the first batch. Like the other viewer I sprinkled them with powdered sugar and they were delicious!
