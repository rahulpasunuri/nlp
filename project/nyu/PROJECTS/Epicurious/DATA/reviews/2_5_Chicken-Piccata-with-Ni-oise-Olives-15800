I thought this was very good and very simple and a nice addition to a basic picatta recipe. I'm not sure why people didn't like it--it turned out just as I'd anticipated.

Not nearly enough lemon juice, sauce just didn't make it. Cooks' Illustrated has a good one on their site that uses 1/4 c of juice and it's superb. To the cook that "substituted" olives for parsley...WHAAAA??? I guess next time I'm out of eggs, I could just sub ground beef...same logic.

This has been the only recipe from Epicurious that absolutely didn't work for me. I ended up throwing it in the trash! The sauce had a strange taste to it, and there was not enough of it. My husband is a huge fan of chicken piccata, but could not even eat this. Next time, I will try a more traditional version of the recipe...what a bummer.

I didn't have any parsley on hand, so doubled the amount of Nicoise olives and it still came out yummy. I cooked it slightly longer than called for--about 2-3 minutes each side and it turned out slightly browned and tender in the middle. Very simple to prepare and a great way to prepare chicken if you're an olive fan. Served with Carrots Vichy--also on this site

One of the tastiest chicken entrees I've ever had, much less made. It's a family favorite and elegant enough for guests. Pitting and chopping the nicoise olives is labor-intensive but well worth the time, but this could be done a day or so in advance. I've also substituted calamata olives which are faster to prepare and almost as good.
