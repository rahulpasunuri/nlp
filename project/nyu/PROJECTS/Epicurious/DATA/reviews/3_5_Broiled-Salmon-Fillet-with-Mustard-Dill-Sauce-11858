This is my "go to" salmon recipe...serve the sauce on the side for those who may not care for it. Both hubby and I enjoy this, particularly in the winter when broiling is the better weather option. Sorry for those who did not care for the sauce...all those whom I have served it to raved! 2% milk or half and half work nicely...adjust other seasonings to taste.

The Salmon was wonderful. I was very generous with the soy. However, the mustard dill was awful.........a good dill sauce doesn't need sugar. I will try it next time the Creamy Caper Sauce from a crab cake recipe off of your site.....excellent!

This has become a staple in my regular dinners at home. The easiest, quickest ever. The soy sauce adds a nice, pretty looking texture. I like to pepper well for "blackened" Served with aspargus is a perfect and health dinner

Made this recipe for a small dinner party, everyone enjoyed. I served it w/ oven roasted brussel sprouts and a spinach/strawberry/roasted pecan salad. Perfect casual dinner and would make again. I also think think the mustard dill sauce would be good on salmon cakes.

This is a fabulous and easy recipe when I don't have the time to spend hours in the kitchen making something more complex. My husband grills the salmon on a cedar plank for additonal flavor. It's always a hit!

The sauce had great flavor and went well with the broiled salmon. I ended up using creme fraiche instead of heavy cream and it turned out better than I expected. I usually just do a garlic-ginger marinade for salmon, but I will add this to my recipe box for something different.

I loved this recipe -- super easy, but absolutely delicious. I'm making again for our dinner tonight at home during the week, but it would be an easy and elegant dish for entertaining as well. Absolutely recommended!

this kind of recipe i like to refer to as a "french fry" type recipe;1)cook salmon 2)add mustard dill sauce....um...Duhhhhh!Maybe do a little research and include an actual sauce recipe if it's not too much trouble.Or else i might submit my famous "french fries con ketchup" recipe!

Very good! Broiled salmon is a crowd pleaser. We'll make this again for sure. The mustard dill sauce was a nice addition.

Very good, and very easy! (I have to admit that I didn't use the mustard-dill sauce in the recipe -- I just added mustard to some leftover sour cream & dill sauce from another meal earlier in the week. Which just shows you how versatile this dish is!)

Very nice and eazy to make. I will make it often.

Excellent starter. I divide the salmon before broiling into individual pieces and serve over the mustard dill sauce on small appetizer plates, usually accompanied by 2-3 thin asparagus. Easy and delicious.

I didn't bother with the soy sauce. I just brushed the salmon with olive oil and then added salt and pepper. The mustard-dill sauce was a great accompaniment.

This is a great recipe. Not only is it great with a LITTLE of the dill sauce, but it's also great without...especially if you don't have time to make the sauce. Just serve it with baby red potatoes, asparagus and garnish the whole thing with some fresh dill.

I'm not a fan of salmon, but my husband picked it out at the market and I found the receipe. It was wonderful!!! Will surely try it again. The mustard dill sauce was great!!! I did half the receipe because it was only the three of us, and it turned out to be sufficient. Yum!!

Watch the timing on the Salmon, my over would have burned it using the recommned temp and time. The sauce is very powerful, so a little is all you need. Very good dish.

Rating: 3
Good for a weekday family dinner or very casual dinner party. "Quick and tasty". I halved the sauce recipe and used whole grain mustard, and only 2t. of sugar. I believe that 4t. would have been overly sweet. Sufficient amount for 3 filets. Served with steamed baby carrots, and green beans.

This recipe was GREAT. I made it for Christmas and it was a hit. I'm tired of giving out this recipe. The sauce was PERFECT. The only change I made was cooking the salmon a bit longer. The appearance of the cook salmon was no too pretty, but I poured the sauce over the salmon and voila!

Made this recipe with a fantastic boneless, skinless BC salmon fillet this past Easter, and the people I served the dish to think I'm a culinary genius. The mustard dill sauce matched up wonderfully with the fish. This has become, for me, an instant 'special occasion' recipe.

This recipe WONDERFUL!! My picky eaters (11 and 8yo) loved the fish. I followed suggestions and reduced the sugar and used a little less dill, and it still was very tasty. Adding this to my menu.

So simple, but oh, so good. Perfect option for our household because my "blandman" husband could have it without the mustard sauce. Quick prep time means that I'll choose this recipe again & again. I have been poaching salmon fillets , and this was much tastier. Also, much less messy than salmon on the grill. Beautiful presentation, so good for company.

A good salmon recipe and the mustard dill sauce is a nice accompaniment. Our dinner guests loved it as did my husband and I. Also, I used less sugar in the sauce than recipe calls for, however, I used coarse-grained dijon mustard which is already on the sweet side. I garnished the salmon with fresh dill flowers and it was a nice presentation.

This is a delicious salmon recipe that is very easy to make. I cut the sauce recipe in half for two 10 oz. fillets and had plenty to spare. I also took some reviewer advise and used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was still fantastic.

This salmon recipe is a staple in our home. It is my absolute fail-safe favorite way to prepare salmon. The sauce is outstanding, and everyone who has had it here totally loves it. It is a recipe I have passed on many times.

Salmon was excellent - I altered the sauce used plain yogurt instead of water, oil and cream - only 1 tsp of brown sugar - much better.

I'm not a very good cook, so when I say this came out deliciously, it's really saying something. The dill sauce was especially good and impressed my friends because it looked so much more fancy than it was to prepare. I cheated a little on the recipe, however. Didn't have soy sauce, so just sprinkled the salmon with rough-ground sea salt and some of the fresh dill. Was great.

Rating: 2
The sauce sounded so delicious while reading the recipe but I though it was just okay. My husband loved it and he usually likes his salmon grilled plain and eaten with just a little lemon juice. We had leftover salmon and sauce so we snacked on it the next day and the sauce did seem better. Perhaps I'll make it a day ahead next time so the flavors can blend. Unusual flavor but worth a try.

Paired with steamed rustic rolls, asparagas and wild rice pilaf, this makes for a perfect date or entertaining meal. It is easy, impressive, and can be made largely in advance and with minimal preparation and kitchen time. Recommended!

Add me to the list of dissenters. I made this dish last night and we did not care for the mustard sauce at all... a very strange combination of flavors that tasted somehow "off". I used half and half, as other reviewers recommended. The salmon was nice by itself however!

My family loved this dish (and they are mighty picky eaters)!!! The mustard dill sauce was very tasty but lacked body. I whisked in 1/4 cup of sour cream at the end which thickened it up nicely and gave it a bit of tang! I recommend this recipe!

The Salmon had a beautiful color after "grilling" and the mustard sauce is absolutely divine. Will definitely make this again.

I cut the recipe in half and used 1/2 and 1/2 which turned out fine. It was delicious!

Delicious! So easy, so elegant, the perfect summer dinner, I will definetly make this again. I did not use as much sugar (just a sprinkle) and I used half and half. And I cut the sauce recipe in half because I only used two pieces of salmon. The broiled salmon is a lovely color, and the sauce tasted good on the asparagus, too! The was the first time I have ever made salmon at home and it could not have been easier.

This recipe is excellent! I substituted basil for the dill and it was delicious on both the salmon and also on chicken! I have made this recipe many times now and friends consistently rave about how good it is. And it's so easy! I have also substituted half and half for the cream and it tastes just as delicious. I think you definitely have to be a mustard fan to truly appreciate this recipe though.

Salmon was good, but the sauce wasn't. I used very good ingredients (French coarse grain mustard, organic heavy cream), and I measured them. I did omit water because of the consistency. Nobody liked it. The mustard overpowered the dill.

This was a wonderful recipe. I have a hard time making fish that doesn't taste the same everytime no matter what kind of fish it is. I love epicurious, it has made me a gourmet in minutes.

Salmon was lovely, but nobody liked the sauce - unusuall combination of flavor that just doesn't "do it" for me. Won't see it again on my menu.

Incredible bang for very little effort I used 1% milk instead of the cream I used 2tsp sugar instead of 4 and it was still a little on the sweet side next time I might skip the sugar.

I made this last night and we both loved it. It was quick and easy and used what I had on hand. My variations: Seeing the reader comments and trying to cut calories, I used fat free half and half, no sugar, no water and half the olive oil. Still great. Also, I used two ~8-10 oz skinless fillets and broiled for less time.

The best thing about this recipe is it's quick quick quick. It's tastes great, too. Although, next time I think I'll leave the sugar out of the sauce, and maybe increase the mustard a little.

Really excellent and very easy. I made this for a New Year's brunch and many people asked for the recipe. Following another commenter's advice, I used half and half instead of heavy cream in the sauce, which worked well. Although I doubled the recipe (i.e. I used 2 salmon filets), I found that I didn't need to double the amount of sauce.

Very easy and tasty. I would suggest closer to the twelve minute cook time if you have a gas broiler. I over-cooked mine just a tad at 15 minutes.

Served this with the ginger garlic asparagus and rice to rave reviews. Everyone wanted the recipe! The sauce is sooo easy but sooo yummy and makes for an elegant presentation. I will definitely be making this dish again.

This scores big points for its simplicity alone. What could be easier than rubbing a salmon filet with soy sauce and broiling it? The sauce also was incredibly easy to make. I used half-n-half instead of cream, and it didn't seem to lose anything. The fish came out wonderfully. My guests didn't leave a bite behind! I served this on a dish with roasted garlic couscous, which seemed to make for a nice complement.

The Mustard-Dill Sauce used in this dish is wonderful. (And I never met a salmon I didn't like!) For my sauce, I skipped adding the water, since the sauce seemed just the right consistency without it. I added two dashes of Tabasco to liven up the flavor a bit, too. Several people requested the recipe. So easy and divine.

I cooked this delicious salmon recipe on my gas grill surrounded with smoking wood chips. First, spray a layer of heavy duty aluminum foil with non stick coating or rub with butter. Then lay the salmon that has been rubbed with soy on top of the foil. Close the grill top and cook on medium heat until salmon flakes. The soy sauce gives the fish a wonderful glaze. This is a wonderful company dish.
