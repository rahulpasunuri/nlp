I was attracted by the combination of spices - wasn't sure I'd like the cloves or fennel with the carrot/cumin standby. But instead of sauteeing in lots of OJ and oil, I thought roasting the carrots sounded better. I used only 2 cloves (a bit cautious), just a small amount of olive oil, and the juice from one orange. Mixed all together, tossed with the carrots and roasted. My whole family thoughtis was delicious.

I can't tell if there's a typo in the recipe or what, but it made more sense to me to saute all the ingredients except the orange juice and zest in the hot oil for a few minutes before adding the juice and zest. With that modification, and plenty of salt and pepper, very tasty!

I must have messed up. I made the sauce the night before and thought it was so gross. As a chef, I know the cumin and carrot combination as an old standby, but this just did not work for me. I think it was the cloves, but you know, I could have just bombed somewhere. Who knows.

i used only half the oj based on others' comments and it made for a decent glaze consistency. However as someone who rarely adds fats to my veggies, I expected better flavour for the 3 tbsps of oil. I'll probably make it again just because i have a big bag of fennel seeds to use up...

I have made this recipe many times using baby carrots and quite enjoy the different and unique flavour. The only problem that I have, is that the orange juice does not boil down. I like my carrots to be on the crunch side, so next time I will only use 1/2 cup of juice and see if that works

This is the best carrot dish I've had. It was probably the first carrot dish brought to our fanily Thanksgiving meal. Next time I'll opt for baby carrots for less manual work though.

We made this sidedish for 15 family members as part of our Easter dinner and it was a big hit. We received many compliments and questions about the exotic smells and flavors and in the end didn't have enough to satisfy everyone's desire for seconds. I accidently added more orange juice than was called for so we ended up removing the carrots when they were just crisp-tender and then reducing the remaining juices before dressing the carrots with the sauce. It was excellent.
