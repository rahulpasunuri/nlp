450 degrees is much to high. The chayotes were dark brown on bottom when I pulled them out after 1/2 hr. I turned them, added the garlic, turned the heat down to 375 and cooked only an additional 10 minutes. They were tasty but garlic was still overdone. So I'd cook this at a lower temp and a shorter time. But if you like the gently sweet flavor of chayote, this is not a bad choice.

This was revolting. Although I love chayotes raw, and eat one almost every day sliced thin in a green salad with balsamic vinegar and olive oil (delicious), this was my first (and last) attempt at roasting them. The texture and flavour was stomach turning. Inedible - I threw the whole dish out. Never again.

this was my first time ever eating Chayotes. i thought they were very interesting. the recipe came out exactly as i thought they would. i'm not sure why the gloves were recommended. i did not use any and i did not experience any discomfort. i would probably make this again as the chayotes are alot cheaper than zucchini. although my kids would not eat them :(

Meh... Cheap and easy way to add variety to your vegetable rotation but nothing I would feed company. Maybe I sliced chayotes too thin, but even after 40 min instead of recommended hour they were too mushy. The flavor is pleasant enough but nothing special. Oh, yes, and anyone who recommends adding chopped garlic to anything in a 450 degree oven and cooking it for another 30 min has never seen inside of a kitchen. On the bright side: they did tell us to wear gloves and please do!

Wow! This was awesome. A great new way to use the ubiquitous chayote. Only two recommendations: cut the chayote wedges thinner than 1 inch -- 1/2 inch came out perfectly in my oven. And do take the previous reviewer's suggestion and add the garlic only 15 minutes before the end, or you will end up with a lot of blackened former-garlic slices.

I've made this several times, and friends and family always ask for the recipe. Although chayote can be found in almost every grocery store in Chicago, I'm surprised at how many people have never tried it. This is a perfect recipe to spring on chayote skeptics. Sweet, tender, light and rich with flavor all at once. My only variation is to maybe add the garlic a little later - as sometimes, some of it gets a little too toasted (i.e. burnt). Also, don't be afraid to make this in smaller quantities for smaller crowds. Peeling all those slippery little guys gets a little tedious, and the juices can cause a mild skin irritation that usually goes away within a couple of hours.

To answer CT's question, from this website.... "Alternate names: Cho-cho, christophene, mango squash, mirliton, pear squash, vegetable pear, choko, pepinella, pepinello, xuxu, xoxo Characteristics: Pronounced "chai-YO-teh," this lime-green gourd vegetable looks like a tight fist and is about as big as an apple. Although the flavor is nondescript (a cross between a potato and a cucumber), its taste is quite versatile. Look for chayotes that are firm and without wrinkles or blemishes. Treat the vegetable like a squash: Eat it raw in salads or cook it however you'd like. In southern Louisiana, chayotes are called mirlitons and are usually served stuffed with a seasoned beef mixture." I've had them in Costa Rica in a cream sauce. Delicious!

Delicious! Roasting brings out the sweetness; garlic adds an earthy complexity. Best chayote recipe.
