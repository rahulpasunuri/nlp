I did enjoy the raw turnips, and the fennel salt was tasty, but overwhelming. I think there may have been too much fennel seed in the fennel salt, though, as my mouth was sort of licoricey numb after a few bites. I'd make the salt again for just turnips, but it was too much fennel for me.

I served this for a coctail party, with a few other items, and people were surprised and delighted with the different flavors. If nothing else, it can be a conversation starter.
