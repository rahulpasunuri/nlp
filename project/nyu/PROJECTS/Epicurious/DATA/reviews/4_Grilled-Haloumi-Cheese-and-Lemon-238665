I have been making this recipe for years, a hit every time. On the other hand I grill the lemon slices, and I place them on the cheese, squeezing them but throwing them afterwards since they can be hard to eat. Also, I now grill the cheese in a pan avoiding burnt cheese or cheese falling through the cracks of the BBQ.

My experience with this recipe is ab analgamation of the others. I was fearful of grilling cheese directly on the grill, so I used a grill pan for all the components, but would have been better off to grill the bread on the regular grill. The cheese is salty, but otherwise fairly bland, so the recipe is tasty but not fantastic. Overall, not worth all the effort, but might try it again.

These were delicious, but we really only got a small taste of the cheese as it started melting and falling thru the grill of the bbq within about 60 seconds. What was salvaged tasted great. Next time I will cook over a griddle so it cannot fall thru.

Tried this tonight, on a little charcoal grill and brushed the extra dressing on the thin slices of baguette before grilling them. Very good. Do use a metal spatula and watch closely.

Incredible. We suggest pan cooking the cheese until it is golden on each side instead of grilling.

An excellent and very different appetizer or light snack. We prepared it as written, all on the grill, and it was easy.

This is a really delicious and relatively easy appetizer. I have made it twice and people loved it both times. To make it a little easier, I grilled the bread and did the cheese and lemons in a grill pan. Haloumi can be a little hard to find but if there is a Whole Foods in your city, they will have it.
