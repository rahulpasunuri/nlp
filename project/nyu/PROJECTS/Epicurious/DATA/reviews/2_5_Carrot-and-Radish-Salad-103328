I like everything individually, but for some reason this just didn't work for me. It tasted like an air freshener smells, but adding more salt just made is taste like a salty air freshener. I should have just had some carrot sticks and radishes with veggie dip.

Another very simple recipe that was very tasty. Was curious so I tried it and was surprised at how good it was and how simple it was to make. I did use baby carrots instead of regular carrots.

This was a nice, light salad and went well with the roasted spiced chicken breast, with which it appeared. I shredded the carrots because I didn't feel like dragging out the mandoline.

My spouse and I both really liked this. Definitely don't skimp on the salt--I used about 1/3 tsp (looks like more than it sounds like); 1/2 tsp probably wouldn't have been too much. I also used extra lime zest and juice. The sweet carrots mellow the harsh radish flavor; the radishes add crunch that wouldn't be there if it were just a carrot salad. Yum.

Not bad. but not great either. It's probably good-for-you and would go with most summer grill cooking.

We found this to be a delightful salad and like the last reviewer fresh taste of the vegetables are delivered with a perfect accent of light flavors.

I have made this salad several times, once for guests, and they asked for the recipe. We enjoy the fresh, light flavors. This is a keeper for me.

Boring, bland and blah. I actually like carrot salads, I like radishes and lime is one of my favorite flavorings. For whatever reason this salad did not come together for me. You will need more salt than you think in order to enhance the flavor. The juice from the lime I squeezed was apparently very tart, I had to add a couple of pinches of sugar in order to take the aggressive bite off. I also let it sit for a couple hours to see if the flavors would "pop" or come together, they didn't. There are so many other great carrot salads out there, this one really isn't worth the time.
