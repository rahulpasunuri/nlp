If you have ever lived out in the South West you will love this recipe. It is the genuine thing .

Actually, I found that simmering it for hours took it from chopped chiles to something that felt and tasted much than the sum of its parts. ymmv, but my friends and I will definitely enjoy this one again.

This is terrific, but is it really necessary to simmer it for hours? I don't think so.
