I just made this for my family of four (two kids under 10 yrs old). We are open to food adventures and enjoy ethnic food on a regular basis. This was so incredibly easy to make and was so very satisfying. I wouldn't change a thing. My daughter stated that it as a bit too sweet for her (I didn't have prunes so I could only imagine how much sweeter it would have been with them). This is definitely going into our regular rotation.

Interesting idea but terrible execution. If you follow these instructions, add two hours to simmer time in order to cook sweet potatoes through and get ingredients to stew. I would also recommend nixing the green beans and a few other ingredients of your choice. Way too much stuff in this. Finally, spices are so low compared to the amount of tomatoes that you can't even taste them. At least double, maybe triple the listed amount if you want this to taste Moroccan and not like My First Vegetarian Recipe. For an experienced cook this is an interesting base recipe, but it needs a lot of help to come out palatable.

My family loved this. Nice spice, just a bit of heat. Added chickpeas near the end of cooking time. Very hearty and flavorful.

I have made this dish a number of times with great success. The combo of flavors is excellent. Once everything is chopped it is a quick and simple meal because you just throw it all in the wok and makes so much food there is plenty of leftovers to take for lunch. I use extra firm tofu and fresh green beans

Absolutely horrible. We dumped the whole thing in the compost and ate something else. What a disappointment. I also agree with the previous comments regarding the soy chunks. That's what I used.

Well, we like Moroccan, so decided to try with a bunch of changes: Marinated sliced chicken breast in cumin, olive oil and lime for a bit, and started the dish with browning those in the onion and garlic. Substituted chopped carrots for the red pepper, and garbanzo beans for the dried green beans (??). Not sure what the soy chunks were, maybe tofu? Had that, but decided against adding it since we had enough protein in the dish. I let it simmer & meld for a bit longer than recommended ... added lemon & almonds at the end. My 4 kids enjoyed & there sure wasn't much left over. I'm sure it will be good for breakfast. I view this as "clean out the frig" moroccan stew ... pretty basic dish to put over rice, couscous, pasta, bread, cauliflower, etc.

Maybe during or after step 5 since that's where it appears in the ingredient list?

also, where does the juice from the lemon come in? step 2?

Are soy chunks the same as tofu?
