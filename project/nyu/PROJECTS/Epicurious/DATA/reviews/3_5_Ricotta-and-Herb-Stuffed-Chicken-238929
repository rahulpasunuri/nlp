Wasn't a fan. To be fair, I only used 2 huge chicken breasts with this recipe, made extra gratin and incorporated some of the review suggestions like some thyme and chevre. Bake according to recipe. But the chicken and gratin were both dry. Flavors weren't stellar either. Will try to make a casserole from leftovers..

I thought this was a nice chicken dish. Had the butcher remove the backbone but for the life of me couldn't figure out how to tuck the drumsticks into the incisions. So I just tucked them under - it worked out fine. I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the garlic and added thyme. Used lots of salt and pepper on the skin and didn't find it bland - it's just a more delicate dish. Very moist.

Made this recipe as directed, only diversifying by using herbs de provence (our oregano is sharp and spicy this time of year), and using salt and pepper in filling and on skin. The flavor of the ricotta was delectable. However, the flavors did not infuse into the chicken, which was bland and wet after roasting. The dish lacked cohesiveness and was also very awkward to eat. Only half of servings were eaten, will not make this again.

great dish to dress up the ordinary chicken. i used chicken quarters so that its easy to serve and came out great. the filling is just delicious!

I adore this recipe. It is relatively simple, inexpensive, and always impressive to guests and family alike. I use about 50% extra garlic and herbs in the stuffing, and I season both sides of the chicken liberally with salt, pepper, and granulated garlic. I have never been able to figure out tucking the knob of the drumstick through the slit of skin, but the slit is useful for sliding the stuffing in. I like to start the chicken at 400 degrees for 30 min but then turn down it down to 325 and roast until it reaches 165-170, about 50 min. It comes out moist and delicious with crispy, flavorful skin. Yum!

i couldn't decide between 3 or 4 forks here. the recipe as stated needs a LITTLE tweaking, but is such a great jumping off point, that i feel like exposing yourself to it is worth the 4 stars. i used HALF the amount of ricotta as originally stated and still had plenty for the oven. i used thyme instead of oregano, and i used a 1/2 cup. same with parsley. i also added lots of salt and pepper... this may be the real reason some people think the recipe is bland. the recipe calls for no salt! i also used chicken parts rather than a whole chicken and roasted it over cut up chunks of stale baguette. i rubbed the chicken skins with more salt, pepper and olive oil, squeezed some lemons juice over the whole thing, and then laid my squeezed lemon halfs on top haphazardly with some extra lemon slices thrown on top for good measure. ok, so i guess i changed a LOT, but it was AMAZING.

Honestly, I love Epicurious and use it for most of my dishes and love everyone's comments and find - most of the time - that they are right on. But, this one I have to say following the directions completely.. We both found this very bland and we added more parmesan to give it more flavour and it still didn't quite cut it! Sorry...

This chicken was a hit in my house. I have to admit that spatchcocking the chicken was tedious (my first time). I also added marscapone, rosemary and thyme. Basted it several times during cooking. Boy this a moist chicken. My husband says it's the best i've ever made. Let's hope he feels the same about the Jerk Turkey that I'm going to attempt at Christmas.

Succulent, easy, beautiful. The chicken roasted nicely. Used half ricotta and half chevre. I also added sauteed spinach, tomato, and onion to the stuffing. I really loved this.

This was so easy! I used dried oregano, but otherwise..pretty much as directed. I stuffed as much of the ricotta mix under the skin as I could. The chicken was very moist and delicious. The leftovers heated up well too.

I thought that this recipe was delicious, and I don't think that it was nearly as much of a pain as some people made it out to be. Some of the people who review recipes on this site seem like they're used to dumping things out of boxes and calling it cooking. In any case, the chicken came out very moist, and the extra cheese did not go to waste. I like the idea of adding feta, and you could really add any herbs you like. Overall, I think this recipe is worth a try.

The flavor was excellent as the finished product. It was however a bit of a pain to make, but the moist creamy meat inside and the crispy skin made it worthwhile. I will make this again, but next time I will cut back on the amount of stuffing as I did not know what to do with the left-over.

This was fabulous - the chicken was perfectly cooked. I did four breasts and two legs and the cooking time was great. I also added the zest of a lemon to the ricotta mixture, which added a great zip.

The ricotta and herb stuffing was nice, but not great, especially considering the amount of work that went into it. The chicken itself was moist, but didn't have a lot of flavor. I won't be making this again.

This was delicious. We made a few alterations - using chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken, and we added roasted orange and yellow peppers with cooked spinach. We also used herbed dipping oil to brush the outside. We will definitely be having this again.

This was a great dish. I had the butcher butterfly the chickens for me, and the stuffing process wasn't as messy as I thought it would be. The chickens make for a dramatic presentation right out of the oven -- my guests were impressed -- and the meat was moist and delicious.

This was delicious and easy to make! I made the stuffing ahead of time and kept it refrigerated until I was ready to stuff the chicken. I used chicken breasts rather than whole chickens, which was fast and easy. The extra gratin / stuffing is so DELICIOUS! I used fresh oregano but dried parsley and it was still fantastic. I will definitely make this again.

This is wonderful, and very easy. I used a combination of whatever fresh herbs I had on hand: thyme, basil, rosemary, and mint. Spatchcocking the birds was easy with a pair of kitchen shears. The meat came out very jucy and flavorful. I will definitely be making this again - next time I'll add the feta, lisaweh; that sounds great!

This was great, and easy to make,,, the stuffing was wonderful and a crowd pleaser,, we made for 12 people and had to transport to another home, we cooked bird to 155degrees and wrapped in foil, then placed in a 200 over for over an hour,,, everything was great

Wonderful recipe for roast chicken. Stuffing was great and bird was succulent. I usually just rub the bird under and over skin with pesto and roast, but this recipe is worth the effort (maybe 15 mins of prep).

A little time-consuming. I changed it to skin- on chicken breasts to save time, and it still turned out delicious. I also added some chives to the ricotta.

The high fuss factor makes this just okay recipe not worthy of repetition. However, the ricotta filling is very good and can be used in many other ways.

This was awesome. I added feta cheese to the mixture and it made it even creamier. I wish I would have doubled the recipes as it was better the next day.

I made the stuffing by itself, then roasted boneless, skinless chicken breasts smothered in olive paste to serve together. Served with quickly sauteed baby tomatoes with fresh basil. Was a hit!
