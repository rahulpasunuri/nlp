The custads make the dish so don't skip them. The soup was OK, I think the flavor was a litle watery and it would have used some more herbs to flavor it up more. I will make again though.

Very mild and not very exciting. I had mixed reviews from the dinners. I liked the creative use of custard and soup but this was underwhelming.

Would give the custards a 4+. They make the dish. The soup (I left out the water) is bland and next time will look for a different recipe for the soup, hopefully without cream, or add spices or something.

Delicious flavor, but I too found this soup too watery once I strained it.

Please, do yourself a favor and make this soup! Add it to your recipe box right now! Next spring you can gather the freshest and best ingredients and fall in LOVE! I like to 'glue' a decorative bite to the bottom of the custard ramekins with butter, when inverted the truffle slice, asparagus spear &/or morel will be on top. I didn't even know white pepper existed, now I couldn't live without it... This recipe is now a standard in my repertoire. Beautiful, impressive, easy...

I made the soup but at the end I added spinach and pureed the soup then added shelled edamame -- just stirring it in. Instead of the parmesan custards I made a jalepeno cream -- 1/4 cup of jalepeno's, 2 tablespoons fresh squeezed lime juice and 1 cup of lite sour cream. I spooned a heaping tablespoon in the center and topped it with a sliced lemon. Yum!

A huge hit and gorgeous. I made the custards to use in fresh spring pea soup. I made them a day ahead and used silicon muffin pan. To make sure it worked out, I unmolded the custards the day before. Just before serving, I zapped them in microwave for 15 seconds. Then placed in soup bowls. I garnished with crispy pancetta.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used frozen asparagus because it's out of season (I just couldn't resist this recipe). The consistency was perfect--I used a rather coarse strainer for the soup and pressed until all the liquid was strained through and only solids left behind. The parmesan custards really made the recipe, and they are easier to remove when chilled completely. I will definitely make this again when I have guests.

Made this year for a vegetarian seder. Very easy and turned out well, and nice change from matzo ball soup. Did not add vegetarian stock since the only vegetarian stock kosher for Passover is a powder. Soup has subtle, I thought, rich taste. Made the custards in a cupcake pan, set over a pan of water. Made them 2 days ahead, put them on parchment paper-covered cookie sheet, and then reheated them gently in the oven. Will definitely make again.

I found the soup to be watery and bland. Perhaps the asparagus I used was not fresh and flavorful.

This is the best asparagus soup I have ever had. The custards really aren't that much work, as they bake themselves, I must admit I definitely squeezed as much of the cheese through after the steeping and it was wonderful flavour. For soups I make my own broth following Chef Paul Prudhomme's recipes, only using carcasses from BBQed Beer-can Chicken, which gives a much richer tasting broth. I also grilled the asparagus before chopping it and adding it to the simmering broth/leek mixture, letting it simmer only 5 minutes till tender. Grilling vegetables brings out a sweetness, and putting that into the blender, the soup was fantabulous!!!! Thankyou! oh, yes, also, only used 2% milk wherever it asked for the cream, both in the custards and the soup, and we did not miss the richness, increase the 1/4 c.cream for the soup to 1 cup milk. So, very low in calories and high in flavour!

This is a great company recipe. Made the soup a day ahead and used a silacone muffin pan for the custards and had no problem with removing them from the pan. My guests loved it.

Rating: 3
As I am cooking for one, I didn't make the custards (though I would certainly make this again and try them if I have it for a dinner party...) The soup part was extremely simple and tasty and came together quite quickly. My one suggestion would be to only add the extra water if you think you need it--if the consistency is too thick. Mine came out rather thin and watering it down doesn't improve the taste at all...

Excellent soup. Parmesan custard is delicious and that's what makes the recipe special. I made custards 4 hours in advance (let them cool more than recipe suggests before unmolding, when they are too warm they break easily) inverted them on to the serving plates and lightly heated the plates with the custards in the oven before serving the soup. Great effect!

This soup was absolutely delicious. I served it for Christmas Eve first course and got rave reviews from very picky eaters. Definitely use parmigiano-reggiano, makes a definite difference. Also made the custards, what a delicious additive to the soup.

soup is excellent. used milk instead of heavy cream. custards lacked flavor, but looked lovely. i will definitely make the soup again, but just shave some cheese on top, as others suggested.

This was an absolute hit at our recent dinner party. The dish turned out exactly like the picture, and was delicious. It is very easy to make, and although the soup would be phenomenal without the custard, our guests and I LOVED the depth of flavor that the custard added to the dish. This will be a go-to recipe for my dinner parties.

Rating: 2
The soup was delicious but way more labor intensive than I expected. I don't think the parmesan custards are worth the time. They look beautiful until they sink and they made the soup a little too rich for some of my guests. Next time I would just shave fresh parmigianno reggiano on top of the soup. On top of that, the strainer didn't work. I ended up using the cuisinart on the first round to puree the soup (a mistake) and then tossing everything in the blender, which did make the consistency lovely. I also managed to make a gigantic mess, which was my fault but had to spend a lot of time cleaning up. Next time I will definitely let the soup cool before messing around with the puree part. Knowing all this, I would make it again, because it would be much easier the second time around.

This is hands down the best asparagus soup I have ever eaten let alone made. I used half the amount of cream and added too much chicken broth by accident, but it was still just amazing. The combination of leeks and shallots give a special undertone to the asparagus, and the cream does contribute a more substantial body to the silky finish of the puree. The first time I made it I didn't make the parmesan custards, but just added a little parmesan directly to the soup, and it was simply delicious. But for guests I made it with the custards, and everyone was blown off their feet. It also freezes really well. This is a keeper!!!

Probably the best soup I have made to date. A real taste of spring time and what a presentation! The custards are so rich and flavorful; use only real Reggiano for the best flavor.

This was just wonderful! The custard turned out perfectly. I may add truffles to the custard next time. I used home made veg stock instead as I didn't have enough time to make chicken stock. I think I might sprinkle a fine tiny little brunois of red bell pepper around the custard next time. All in all, a great soup that I will make again.

This soup was delicious. I'm a vegetarian, so I used homemade vegetable stock instead of the chicken stock, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The soup is simple and elegant, and relies entirely upon the quality of the asparagus and the stock. The custards were a fantastic combination with the soup -- worth the time and effort -- but if you're in a rush, making some parmesan croutons would probably work, too.

Made this delightfully elegant soup as the first course of our Christmas dinner. Very, very easy to make. I used a muffin tin to make the custards. Made the recipe exactly as written. Let the custards sit at room temp for about 90 minutes. Before our guests arrived I plated the custards into the bowls and garnished with asparagus spears. When all were seated I poured the very hot soup around the custards using a measuring cup. Got rave reviews!!

This custard has become my standard for impressing and satisfying guests. (There are custards in the oven as we speak.) I love the asparagus soup and I have adapted the custard to other soups as well. Add truffles, mushrooms, herbs, etc., to marry the flavor to the soup. Yum!

Rating: 3
I made this soup without the custards and floated the Parmesan Crisps from this site on top, instead. I added a few diced cremini mushrooms to the saute at the beginning because I had them and used a combo of cottage cheese and yogurt (once the soup cooled a bit) instead of the sour cream. The flavor was great. For serving I mounded some chopped mint and avocado on top of the parmesan crips, which got some "oohs" from my friends.

This was not worth the time or effort (or expense). The soup was thin after straining it and had virtually no flavor. The custards were problematic though once I got them out of the molds, I could re-mold them so they looked presentable. All in all a very disappointing dish. My feet still hurt after standing and monitoring its progress!

Don't even bother with the custard cuz this soup is amazing. I used plain yogurt because I didn't have cream and it was great and much healthier.

We made a different asparagus soup that we knew we liked (also from this data base) called "Asparagus Soup" (from Bon Appétit, March 1994) and made the custards from THIS recipe for our 2005 Easter Dinner and they were "to-die-for" good... everyone clamoured for the two extras, so we divided them up between everyone and had the last drop of soup with them. We made them a day ahead and they kept wonderfully well. We warmed them in a low oven in a water bath while the rest of the meal cooked, which made for light work... and it was very easy. The velvety texture was amazing! Yum! Yum! Yum! Another keeper!

This is now part of my personal tested recipe collection. Any cook who reads the coup recipe can tell you that the outcome will depend on two things, the quality of the asparagus and the quality of the chicken stock. I served this at a dinner party on Saturday. In preparation I made my own chicken stock at home on Thursday and made the soup Friday. It kept beautifully in the refrigerator for the Saturday party. This is one of the great joys of serving soup as a hostess, it actually gets better if refrigerated for a couple of days, the flavors blend and develop. I very much prefer a formal first course of really good homemade soup, than the usual greasy and fattening finger foods frequently served as appetizers. Besides using my own homemade chicken stock, I used a slightly different technique with the asparagus. I steamed the asparagus, then pureed it in a food processor, then added it to the chicken stock and leeks in the soup pot. The food processor does such a good job of pureeing the asparagus that I didn't need to strain the soup to remove stray pieces of asparagus stalk. The flans seemed to be a big success with the guests. I followed the recipe exactly except that I left out the pepper since I didn't have any white pepper on hand. I found them creamy smooth with a delightfully subtle cheesy flavor. Note that when I was straining the milk, cheese and cream mixture into the egg mixture, there was alot of hard cheese chunks in the strainer. I ignored them and threw them away as noted in the recipe. Don't let this worry you, the flans turned out great. Although the flans were very tender and fragile, they did reheat quite well in the microwave. I think my guests really liked the soup and flan presentation. If you take advantage of the fact that the soup can be made several days ahead then frozen or stored in an air tight container, the dish is very good for parties. I will definitely make this again.

This is the recipe I've been looking for!!! I've made it twice now and had my family fighting for the last few drops. Will make ahead and try the muffin pan idea for custards next time. I don't use any water just chicken broth (the nice boxed stuff now available in most markets), add a splash of sherry and sprinkle some fresh tarragon over the top. You can also add a very small amount of fresh ground nutmetg to custards while cooking be careful as too much can kill the dish.

I followed the recipe to the letter with one exception - I cooked the asparagus an additional 5 minutes and cut the spears into smaller pieces prior to cooking. This eliminated the need to strain the soup after it came out of the blender. Also, the third time I made this, I made mini cheese straws as a floating garnish rather than making the custard. This worked well also. If you have the time, indulge in the custard. It is worth the effort! The soup itself is the best on this website.

Not only impressive presentation but also delicious! Made this for Easter Dinner and everyone loved it! Don't be afraid to make the parmesan custards the day before. I needed to double the recipe and did not have enough ramekins so I used a cupcake tin. After letting them cool (I left them right in the tin), I covered them with plastic wrap and refrigerated. To reheat, I put them back in the oven at 350 degrees for about 10 min in the hot water bath. I was able to gently lift them out of the cupcake tin with a thin rubber spatula without any difficulty - they stayed intact. Also made the soup the night before but only change I made to the soup was just before serving, to add evaporated milk instead of heavy cream, but first I thickened the evap milk as you would a cream sauce - with a Tbsp melted butter and Tbsp flour. Whisk a little soup into the cream sauce before adding it to the soup, then whisk the sauce into the soup. May sound complicated but it is not; the taste of the soup combined with the silky texture of the custard is worth it! Enjoy!

I usually agree with most of the reviews. The custard was very tasty but the soup was awful. Why would anyone add that much water and then strain it. I know that I followed the recipe to the letter and it was runny and a waste of good asparagus.

Really delicious. The custards are so smooth and creamy and peppery with the Parmesan cheese. Lots of extra cracked black pepper is nice, but then we like extra pepper on everything. I did not strain the soup and it was a little thick. But I think strained would be very thin. Hmmm.

A real show-stopper! Sophisticated, elegant and very impressive in presentation; sublime in flavours; velvety smooth in texture. Made the soup in the morning and reheated - added a splash of sherry just before serving. Made the custards 2 hours ahead; cooled to room temp then sealed each surface with saran and let stand on the counter; removed the saran and microwaved at medium power for a few minutes all with no problem - the custards popped right out. I did reserve some raw asparagus tips for garnish and quickly steamed just before serving. This is a gorgeous soup that is sure to wow even the most discriminating diner. For another outstanding starter, please try the Gazpacho Sorbet with Apple Aspic also from this site. It is recipes like these that keep me coming back to Epicurious over and over again!

It truly is an easy recipe to make. I tested it prior to serving it at a dinner party, and it came out wonderful! I always like to have things PREPARED IN ADVANCE, and so I did the custards 3 1/2 hours in advance, and simpy heated them up in the microvave for a few minutes when I was ready to serve. As far as the soup itself is concerned, I have done several cream of vegie soups in my life, and they can all be prepared a day IN ADVANCE, and reheated the day of the party. They ALWAYS come out A-OK! So if you want to try this soup, do not hesitate. It's sophisticated, gorgeous-looking with the flan, asparagus tips, and parmesan curls. Your guests will definitely be impressed!!!

This soup is quite easy to make and does make an elegant presentation. I did get good reviews from guests. I was nervous about the custards but they turned out just fine.

This is an excellent and easy soup recipe.... to add some extra flavour I added a pinch of cayenne pepper, a tablespoon of finely chopped flat parsley,60g of English cheshire cheese, and 50ml of cooking sherry.(all added after you puree step.)

A truly sublime combination - the creaminess of the custard with the hearty flavor of the soup is great - will bring ohs and ahhs as it looks as impressive as it tastes.

This was outstanding. I did not have the correct size ramekins but I did have individual dome shaped fluted aluminum jello molds. I greased them with butter before adding the custard ingredients. They were so pretty but more importantly so delicious.

The presentation says it all! And for the custards, if you line the bottom of your ramekins with buttered parchment paper, you can even refrigerate left-over custards and easily de-mold them for use. Alternatively, bake only what you need, and reserve the custard mixture in the refrigerator.

My husband made the custards (but paired them with a different Epicurious asparagus soup). Since we don't have a sieve, he did not strain the steeped cream/parmesan mixture, and the recipe did not suffer one bit. The Parmesan taste complemented, but did not overpower, the mild soup. These custards added a lot of flavor and were such a nice presentation!

I have to take exception to all the four forkers' raves about this recipe. It looks very lovely but the sharp saltiness of the parmisan custard overwhelms the asparagus. A blander custard, corn or carrot, would work much better.
