Delicious. My tarragon died, so I substituted oregano. Had an abundance of beans and asparagus so I doubled those ingredients and will add even more the next time I make this. My daughter ate this - even though she won't eat other salads with vinaigrette.

I cut some ripe Bose pear and added to the salad. This is amazing too!

This salad is delicious. It's also easy to make. I will make this over and over again. We get stuck in a salad rut sometimes- when I made this, everyone at the table couldn't stop talking about how much they loved the salad. Wonderful every day recipe.

This probably deserves four forks, but I didn't have fresh tarragon or thyme and used dry. That being said, two of my three kids ate the asparagus and the green beans (when they say they hate asparagus and only like beans roasted)and one of them grabbed the salad bowl to finish it off!

This dressing is really, really good. I will definitely make it many times in the future.

Fabulous salad! Go lightly on the dressing because it is VERY flavorful and tangy.

Added Shrimp and Calamari instead of the green beans & asparagus (which I didn't have) and minced red onions. Will add minced garlic next time to give it a stronger taste. My boyfriend loved it. If you like/love Dijon mustard, you'll enjoy this simple recipe. Great for warm nights.

I've made this several times and highly recommend it. I usually increase the asparagus, green beans and tomotoes. Excellent!

I thought this salad was ok for everyday, but nothing more.

Delicious, quick and easy. Only change I would make is using the entire bag of mixed baby lettuce since this dressing is very flavorful. Will definitely make again.

I made this for a potluck. Doubled the recipie and used 4 cups of mixed greens and 4 cups of baby spinach. Easy and delicious. Many people requested the recipie.

Great recipe! - - Especially love the dressing - - it is out of this world! To make a little 'fancier', I mixed 1/2 of the dressing with the vegetables and let them 'marinade'. I served them ontop of the salad greens and drizzled a little more dressing all over.

I apologize for committing a big boo-boo by not having tried this yet, but to the previous cook, the oil quantity is smooshed together with the green beans due to a typo. Hope that helps.

Gradually whisk in oil. How much oil? None mentioned in the list of ingredients.

Wonderful dressing. I didn't use the green beans or the asparagus spears and used spinach in place of the lettuce.

This had good flavor to it- it looked beautiful and I liked that the dressing was slightly sweet and a little tangy.

What a fabulous salad! I made it as a dry-run for an upcoming dinner party for gourmet club. My husband and I devoured every morsel. We also tried it with Parmesan cheese, as suggested. It is my opinion that the cheese competes with the wonderful flavor of the herbs. I would serve it as is and not change a thing in the recipe.

I found this recipe literally at the last minute. I had everthing but the fresh herbs! I took a chance with dried. Fridge'd it for an hour and a half as I prep'd everything else. It was still pretty good. I am definetly going to do this again (the correct way with FRESH herbs) very very soon!

All 3 couples at dinner last night agreed this is the best green salad we have ever had. My husband isn't much of a lettuce eater, but he cleaned his plate to get the last bit of the wonderful dressing.

I added 1T tarragon by mistake and really liked the flavor it gave. I also added some shaved parmesan for extra umpf! Salad is a definate winner and will be made over & over in my household.

I made this as one of my contributions to our family's Easter Brunch this year and everyone LOVED it. I love recipes that make me look good, (especially easy ones)and this had me shining. I bought and forgot to add the tomatoes -- no loss, no one missed them. The one thing you DON'T want to forget is fresh herbs, even though thyme is my least favorite herb to harvest off its stem. Certainly the dressing would be perfect with beautiful spring lettuces alone.
