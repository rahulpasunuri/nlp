I give it three forks - nice and delicate flavors. I substituted some mushrooms instead of cauliflower, which didn't, when thinking of flavors, make too much sense. Added more wine, and upped the salt and pepper. Nice and simple. Served with a side of steamed, quartered Brussel sprouts ... a better choice, in my humble op.

It was ok, but not very tasty. I liked the saffron, but there was something missing. Suggestions?

The only fish I had was tilapia, I used it and I really loved the results.
