I didn't have oat bran so I used only wheat bran. Instead of spelt flour I used 1 1/4 cup all-purpose wheat flour and 1 1/4 cup whole-grain wheat flour. I used almond milk instead of soy milk, dried blueberry-flavored cranberries instead of blueberries and I accidentally made the pancakes really big. It was wonderful! I'm definitely going to make this a staple breakfast food.

I had high hopes for these. Not sure what happened. I used 1/4 cup ground chia instead of the oat bran and also used almond milk instead of the soy. Had to add ALOT of extra milk to even get a pourable consistency, which was expected due to the chia. But cooking these in the frying pan took forever...after 10min per side these were getting to be leathery on the outside but still gooey in the center. Not even burnt?? I used med high heat. Any thoughts?

My go-to pancake recipe is usually Isa's buckwheat pancakes (on this site), but this is a really nice, nutty and hearty alternative. I did add cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, and some blackstrap molasses to the batter before pouring. And I used wheat germ in place of bran. My whole family, including my toddler, gobbled them up.

This is a good basic healthy pancake recipe. I made it the first time, it was a bit dry. The changes I made to the basic recipe were as follows: I added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 cup of agave nectar and 3 tablespoons ground flax seed, which added moisture and fiber. It turned out great. For the holidays, it'd be nice to add a 3/4 cup of pumpkin puree and a pinch of nutmeg or allspice. One could make apple pancakes by adding 3/4 cup of apple sauce. It's a nice basic recipe, but Moby seems like he enjoys plain food, this is not meant to be mean, I just like a bit more flavor in my food. :)

First off, I don't like pancakes. This sounded interesting and healthy, so I gave it a whirl. I used what I had on hand, not the exact recipe - wheat germ for oat bran and almond milk instead of soy. SO GOOD. I want to make them again and again they are that good.

I absolutely love this recipe! Instead of as pancakes, I've been treating them like breakfast biscuits - they are absolutely great with peanut butter!

These are filling, but I have dietary restrictions which made wheat bran a no-go...so I doubled the oatbran. I wouldn't do this next time. I used soy milk which was good. The blueberries 'made' this recipe good. It was good that they are filling. I did the boo boo and shouldn't have put double oat bran to make up for the wheatbran I didn't use on purpose. slowcooker72

These are freaking awesome. I try pancake recipes from Epicurious allll the time; this recipe is one of my faves. I used the EdenBlend and also added a little organic brown sugar. I love berries, so added a ton straight to the batter rather than pressing in cake by cake. Topped with a mix of maple syrup and honey. Delish and filling!

Question: Will this recipe make waffles in an iron as well?

Wowza! I added pecans, and am super happy that I now know how to make great pancakes, that are filling and good for you, and inexpensive too!!

Delish! But I substituted whole rolled oats for oat bran, and textured vegetable protein for wheat bran. Still delicious! Had to add sugar though- stick with brown sugar.

It's an awesome recipe, but I wish that epicurious wouldn't pass it off as an exclusive. I saw this in a handful of magazines a few years ago.

Finally, a good vegan recipe that is outside the box! This tastes really good and we loved the variety among all the flours! We tried the original and it was fantastic! Then we used wheat bran and wheat germ and it was just as good.
