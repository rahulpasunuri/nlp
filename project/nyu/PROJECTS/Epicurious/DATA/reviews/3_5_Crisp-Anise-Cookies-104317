The recipe is very good; in Italy (Lazio) we have cookies very similar to these, they are ring-shaped (they seem small donuts), with anise seeds. The italian recipe have only flour, EVOO, sugar, white wine and 1 tbls. of anise seeds. If you want to compare recipes: http://www.academiabarilla.com/recipes/lazio/aniseed-ring-cookies.aspx

Really a nice, easy to work with, sugar cookie. But not the best anise cookie. I did almost double the aniseed (which, by the way, the seeds are a really nice touch), but I think you really need to slip a little anise extract into these to get any real flavor.

These cookies are somewhat boring. I made them and shared them with three honest people, and two forks was the highest review amongst them. I would not make them again. Though, if I did make them again I would increase the Anise a bit (maybe even double it).

These cookies remind me of the anise cookies I had in New Mexico a few years ago. They are delicious and very easy to make. The best thing is that they are not too sweet, and they go extremely well with a cup of green tea!

These sound so similar to a cookie my mom made at Christmas and I had lost the recipe. I will give them a try. Do they spread a lot during baking?

My family loves these cookies; they are not overpoweringly sweet. I roll out the dough, cut the cookies and then sprinkle with sugar. Excellent.
