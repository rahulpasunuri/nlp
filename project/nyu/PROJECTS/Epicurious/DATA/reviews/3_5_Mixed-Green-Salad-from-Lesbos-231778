I just made this for easter dinner and everyone really enjoyed it. I chopped the vegetables an hour before and did not use borage or a substitute. It's really refreshing and a lovely change from a regular salad. Will definitely make it again. Also loved the story about how the people buy the ingredients in Greece.

I may have found this salad as long as the 10 years it has been on the site. It is always on my Easter table, and I love it. No, I have never found the borage, and have made it with and without the cucumbers, to good effect both ways. I find the tiny cucumbers at my local market, so that may be why it is not too watery. Also, I have chopped the veggies ahead, and it was fine, I have also sometimes cut the fennel bulb not so fine, and that was ok too, though I do prefer it chopped fine.

A very nice salad, although the instructions to chop the vegetables at the last minute makes it somewhat impractical for a single cook. I wonder how preparing the vegetables in advance and adding the dressing at the last moment changes the taste? I took the previous reviewer's advice and didn't substitue cucumber. Has anyone found the borage and used it in the salad? If so, how did it taste?

Cucumbers will make this recipe too watery. Better to not substitute. Just ommit the borage. The salad will still retain its spring-like flavor, and believe me, all those green vegetables carry the aroma of spring. I am not a fan of vinegar. I like to use lemon juice, or a combination of lemon juice and vinegar. This is a very refreshing salad.
