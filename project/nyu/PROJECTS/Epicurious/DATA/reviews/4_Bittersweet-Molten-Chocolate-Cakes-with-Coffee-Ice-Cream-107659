This is AMAZING! Made this for a dinner party last night and it was compared to the Molten Cake at Roy's Restaurant ....... I was told mine was even better! Prepared it in the morning kept it in the fridge brought it to room temp before I baked it. Served it with vanilla ice cream and fresh raspberries and mint leaves for garnish. Will definitely make this again

Very easy, and a guaranteed hit. We make it in advance and leave it covered in the refrigerator until just before dessert time. For an entertaining wow, it doesn't get any easier than this.

I didn't make the ice cream but did make the chocolate cakes. I cut the recipe in half and used 1 egg and 1 egg yolk -- I also used a scant tablespoon of flour to insure enough structural integrity. Served with whipped cream on the side.Husband said it would be good with raspberries (which it would). Would also be good served with raspberry beer :-) Am planning to have this as dessert on Christmas Eve.So simple to make. The sugar on the ramekins helps the souffle/cake to climb so is very necessary -- they also separated from the sides beautifully.

I made this recipe for 2 people and cut it in half (used only 1 egg and 1 egg yolk) and three ramekins. My brutally honest food critic (my husband) told me these were to die for. He devoured two of these lovely cakes and was in chocolate heaven. What a great recipe and the coffee ice cream goes perfectly with it. A definite keeper!

Rating: 4
it is just amazing how easy and wonderful this is. and the best part is that you can make it the night before and it comes out just as good--takes about 15 min before you are ready to serve it (including prep time) and you're done. so delish every time.

Rating: 4
My first attempt at making souffle - and it came out great. I used aluminum tin cups instead of the porcelain and it was very easy to remove the souffle when cooked. The only adjustment I would make next time is to reduce the amount of sugar sprinked in each cup... the sugar adds a pleasing texture but it is a bit too sweet. Be very careful not to overcook: a couple were cooked through and there is nothing worse than opening a steaming souffle and not seeing the chocolate middle ooze onto your plate.

Rating: 1
I thought this was going to be a sure thing. I figured the few reviews that were negative were because they had done something wrong. The flavor was fine, but the texture was not. I had the soft lava in the middle, but it was the texture of the cake I didn't care for.

OMG!! Easiest dessert ever & a big hit with my friends. YUM!

Rating: 4
Oh my goodness. This was so, so delicious! A few notes: First, make sure not to over-bake - the center should look very runny - almost pudding-like. Second, use good chocolate. I found Ghiradelli semisweet baking chocolate bars to work well. Finally, these don't rise too much, so you could probably get away with making only six ramekins from this recipe in order to have a taller cake when you turn them out on the plate.

This was wonderful, and perfect for a dinner party as you can prepare most of it in advance, then just pop it into the oven when your meal is almost over. Did not serve with icecream as I didn't think it needed it.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I did not get the result I was hoping for. Perhaps I cooked the cakes too long, but my oven is usually slow, so I did not check before the 13 minutes. The cakes were tasty, but rather small, and did not rise as much as I expected. I did beat the eggs/egg yolks a bit longer as 8 minutes did not thicken them. I am glad that I tried this on my family and not at a dinner party - I would have been a bit embarassed. I would like to find a recipe for lava cake that is not temperamental; any ideas?

This was my very first attempt of making anything in a souffle dish and to serve a warm dessert. Super easy to prepare, I even melted chocolate in microwave. Everyone loved it, is a keeper.

Based on another reviewer's suggestion, we baked at 400 for 11 minutes, and it came out perfect. Beautiful, rich flavor, molten inside. Surprisingly easy! Used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate bars. Buttered ramekins very well and they came out smoothly. Did not use (or need) ice cream.

Some of us can't stop improvising... No taste difference in substituting Splenda for the sugar. Sprayed the ramekin & dusted with cocoa, no problem in un molding. I added 1 tablespoon of expresso powder to the melted chocolate. I also added a frozen truffle to each for a true lava experience. [Source: Alice Medrich's Bittersweet.]

This a great recipe; and so easy. I change the ice cream to match the season. At Christmas it is great to pair it with peppermint ice cream and strawberry or mint ice cream in the summer

This is a general desssert with a general recipe. Its no fail. I am a pastry chef and use molten cakes at my restaurant. You can make the batter ahead of time and even store them while already in ramekins. I use vege spray and cocoa to coat my ramekins. Never fails! The sides pull away if you coat them well. Good luck and cheers!

Very good, the secret is to use a good quality of chocolate.

This was a smashing success. Tested it last night with friends before Valentines Day dinner party- everyone loved it. The one thing is coffee ice cream is sort of lost on it. We were thinking maybe mint or vanilla because the chocolate is so powerful it gets a little lost. Also maybe some cayanne pepper in it for some kick.

Rating: 4
Great ease of prep to quality of output ratio! Beating the eggs is the only time consuming elelment, and that's less that 10 mins. Use a larger spoon or rubber spatula to fold in the choc for greater efficiency. Served in the ramekin, which missed the oozing visual, but kept them hot to go with cold ice cream.

This recipe is almost identical to my favorite by Jean-George. Here's the link to his molten cake recipe: http://www.leitesculinaria.com/recipes/cookbook/warm_choc_cake.html I just made his molten cakes and I think the key to an easy release from the ramekin is his suggestion to twice butter and dust with flour or sugar. I cooked my cakes at 450 degrees on a cookie sheet for 8 minutes and they were perfect.

Rating: 4
very easy to make, batter was quick to pull together. I made them in silicon baking cups, and one batch filled 12 cups. I baked them 7-8 minutes. I did not grease the cups - there was a delicate balance. The ones that cooked longer came out easier, but the ones that had more molten lava filling did not come out of the cups well.

I made this for a diner party, and my friends said things like, "Oh my God, this is the most incredible thing I've ever eaten" I used to work at a prime steakhouse that I think had a better version (because yes, it's trendy, but so what), but this is great for an at-home version. I learned at said steakhouse that one of the keys to turning this dessert out (I do agree that it's key to present it that way, even though the recipe doesn't say to) is to REALLY generously butter the souffle cups. They're not kidding when they say that. It also helps to slide a sharp, pointy knife around the edge, and it helps to let them sit for a couple minutes. I let mine sit for a couple minutes, and most came right out. I had one that I though was stuck, but after I let it sit upside down for a couple minutes, it slid out easily. I doesn't hurt to make a couple extra in case you break one, and you may find, like I did, that some of your guests would like to eat more than one. I disagree with the people who said that it's too rich to eat a lot of. I also disagree with the people who say that vanilla ice cream is as good with this dessert as the coffee ice cream is. I think that vanilla is common, and the coffee ice cream lends this dish an element of sophistication. I made my own coffee ice cream, and if I do say so myself, it was the best coffee ice cream I've ever had. (It was Ben and Jerry's recipe) Thirteen minutes is too long-10 is about right, and check them at 9. One more tip-the restaurant that I worked at used large coffee cups with rounded bottoms to make this dessert. I think that the presentation was better that way, but it's probably not worth it for most people to go out and buy 8 round, ceramic coffee cups. Just an idea, though. Also--you don't need the sugar in the ramekins. Overall, this recipe is easy, delicious, and will impress your friends (unless they're jaded food snobs and think that lava cakes are "too trendy.")

I MADE THIS AFTER A ROMANTIC DINNER AND IT WAS SO FLUFFY AND DELICIOUS!!! I SERVED IT WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM AND RESPBERRIES DUSTED IN POWDERED SUGAR. HOWEVER I THOUHT ALL THE SUGAR ON THE BOTTOM WAS UNNECESSARY , NEXT TIME I WOULD GO WITH ONLY 2/3 OFTEASPOON. I CANT WAIT TO MAKE IT AGAIN

While I overcooked them by a minute or so, they were still delicious but not molten. I had trouble getting them out of the ramekins so I served them straight out of the oven.

I wanted to make this for "two" so I used 1/3 the ingredients and 2 ramekins. They were perfect after 13 minutes, and they were exceptional. I think the key is the chocolate - I used Valrhona (hard for me to find - finally found it at Williams Sonoma), and they were really delicious & decadent.

This was fantastic and so easy! I made them in mini muffin tins the day before and then popped them in the oven for about 8 mins (convection oven) right before dessert was being served. They came right out of the muffin tins and everyone at the party loved the little lava cakes topped with whipped cream. It made about 35 mini lava cakes.

This recipe is fantastic! And ridiculously easy. I left mine in the refrigerator until I baked them and they were fine. I had larger ramekins (7 oz) and baked them for 14 minutes. They were perfect. I used a melon baller to serve the ice cream so the sizing was right. The coffee ice cream was a nice change from usual rasperry coulis/fruit-based accompaniments. My guests loved this and it's now one of my go-to desserts.

Just made these for Valentine's day. The flavor and texture were perfect, the cooking time was right on, even at 5400 ft. However, they did not turn out of the ramekins well. I buttered them and coated them with sugar. I will try more butter next time? I'm fine with the idea of leaving them in, but then how do you manage the ice cream part? I used vanilla ice cream. They were delicious.

I am planning to make this recipe for a senior men's cooking class that I teach monthly so I did a practise run tonight by: * making 1/3 of the recipe * baking them (4 in total) in disposable foil cups (1/2 cup capacity cups used 1/3 cup of batter in each) and they were excellent. I checked them after 8 minutes and ended up baking for 10 minutes then let them sit for 5 minutes after removing from oven. Somehow they are light tasting but rich at the same time. If having a heavy meal making 12 portions in 1/2 cup containers instead of 8 in 3/4 cup containers works well.

This is one of my very favorite recipes. I make it all the time and always get rave reviews. There's hardly anything you can't do with this: I make them ahead and keep them in the refrigerator for days, or even freezing is no problem! Sometimes I insert a homemade cream truffle in the center before baking. I sometimes also make them with special chocolate suitable for diabetics, since my dad is diabetic. Recently I had one cake leftover after a party, and I reheated it in the microwave the next evening. It wasn't quite as gooey in the center anymore, but it rose up very nicely and tasted just as chocolatey as the night before! I don't know anything comparable, either in simplicity to prepare, nor in taste.

I have made this recipe many times and always get rave reviews. I love making it because it is so fast and easy and tastes great. The key is to not overcook the cakes -- they need to ooze when you serve them. It is tricky turning them out but buttering the dishes well and putting the dessert plate on top of the ramekin and then turning it over helps.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times with mixed results, from great to WOW. The secret to getting the cakes to turn out consistantly is to really butter the cups well, use the full 1 1/2 tsp sugar dusting and let them sit for two minutes before turning them out onto a plate. I skip the coffee ice cream, for decadent I turn it out into a pool of cream anglais and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. There was one time when the center was not very oozey, the oven was too hot. To prevent that from happening again, I may place a chocolate candy in the center of the cake before baking. Everyone whose eaten this has loved it.

This was very tasty but you can't turn it out onto a plate. What a mess! You need to plan to serve it in the warm dish. Also, it didn't come out with a soft middle, but my oven is tricky. I'll try again although I prefer the Winter Spice Molten Chocolate Cakes also on this website.

Well foodies, with all of the comments and variations in time, I had to conduct a scientific experiment. All samples were made in souffle dishes. My oven was claibrated properly.

I had no problem getting the cakes out of the ramekins... maybe because I used the sugar to dust the inside of the ramekins? It sounds like some cooks are just putting it in the bottom of the dish, I read it more like using the butter and sugar instead of butter and flour that most cake recipes call for to prepare the baking pan. Try swirling the sugar around inside the buttered ramekin so that it's coated evenly with both. This gives the batter something to climb and should make the release easier.

To Philly: I think the question should be, "why would you serve them IN the ramekins" (if you are entertaining). Most molten cakes are served "turned out." It is much more attractive, and lets the diner appreciated the semi-liquid center (that's the whole point!) Eaten directly from the ramekins is like eating some sort of cakey pudding. Sure it'll taste good, but isn't that only part of the whole experience?

I read every single review, printed them out, and followed every tip etc., amd I was totally embarrassed at the end of the meal. I even went to the extremes of buying the as suggested Trader Joes chocolate, timed them 10 minutes, wouldn't come out of the cups. 12 minutes, still no luck and then I finally didn't give a duck's ass and just plopped them on to the plates; tasted great- appealingly sucked but by then no one gave a rats ass.

Thanks to previous reviewers' suggestions, including using bitterwsweet chocolate (I used Trader Joe's), reducing baking time to 10 minutes, unmolding the cakes from the dishes, and serving them with vanilla instead of coffee ice cream and with raspberries, this dessert was just perfect!

So simple! So yummy! People think you're a complete professional when you serve them this excellent chocolate dessert. Echoing several other reviewers--use PREMIUM chocolate--take the cakes out of the oven at 10 minutes--NO LONGER. Let them sit 2-3 minutes and invert them on a dessert plate. Vanilla ice cream is just as good, but not better, and raspberries look pretty on the plate and taste lovely with the chocolate and ice cream.

This was really easy. The fact that you can make it the night before and bake it as you eat dinner is a definte plus. I couldn't get them to come out of the dish however, so we ate them from the cups. I liked this recipe and the coffee ice cream accented it perfectly.

I made this for a small dinner party (fabulous!) but only baked four of the eight. The next day, I just stuck the remaining four ramekins, covered with foil, in the freezer. I wasn't sure if this would work, but about six weeks later, when we had family visiting, I took them out of the freezer, thawed them in the microwave on power level 1 for about 5 minutes and then baked as directed. They were just as great as when I first made them! This really increases the versatility of this recipe.

I've made this three times now, and here are the lessons I have learned. Definitely use bittersweet chocolate. I made it with Scharffen Berger and it was perfect. I tried with Ghiradelli Semisweet and it was much too sweet. Also, definitely undercook this if you want the molten center - I baked it for 13 minutes the first time, and it was the same texture all the way through. The second time I tried it at 9.5 minutes and it was perfect.

Rating: 4
I can't add much to all the other raves, except to say that my company was bowled over, and to offer a few hints: First, if you're a novice wondering what to bake these in, and don't have or want to invest in little souffle dishes, just use the cheap little Pyrex custard cups that are sold in the supermarket or Bad and Bath. They are just the right size and shape, and since you are going to follow all the good advice here and invert the cakes onto plates, the looks don't matter. Second, the glass will be very hot, so use tongs to flip over the cups--my cakes slid right onto the plate, no sweat. Also, these will overcook in mere seconds, so be sure your oven is calibrated properly and do not leave them in beyond the 13 minutes, no matter what. In fact, you may find that even that is too much and have to lower the time for the next round, which no doubt will be very soon! Finally, the coffee ice cream was declined by several at my table--some people just don't like it--so next time I would stick with sweetened whipped cream and a few rasberries on the plate for color.

Rating: 4
Looked at the comments and unmolded the cakes, & served with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce (frozen raspberries pureed with lemon juice and a little powdered sugar). Was incredible. Have experimented with timing and still have not had the insides come pouring out like sauce, which some other molten recipes suggest will happen. My middle was more puddinglike--though the taste was so incredible I didn't care. Type of chocolate is important because when you look at the recipe, that's most of what is included. Used Trader Joe's pound plus Belgian.

WOW! There's a fine restaurant I go to, only because I love their Godiva Dessert-which is just like this recipe. I'm pleased to say, this recipe is better! Very good! Used Lindt, but next time I think I'd try a different chocolate. Definitely worth the $$. I cut the recipe in 1/3 since it was only for 2 of us and we ate one on Saturday and one on Sunday. Time to go to the gym.... :)

Use good chocolate, it is worth the price. I couldn't imagine how 1 tablespoon of flour would result in a cake but it did. So wonderful and easy when the eggs are beaten with a stout mixer. Yum

Has anyone living in high altitude made this recipe yet? I made it last weekend without very good results and I'm wondering if the altitude played a part. Any hints would be appreciated!

I loved this recipe! It was very easy and was melt-in-your-mouth good. It is for chocolate lovers. 8 ounces of choolate!

Simple and delicious - and always impressive to your guests (like those rice krispie treat commercials). I used Ghiradelli's bittersweet chocolate and baked for 10 minutes. I prefer this recipe to the earl grey infused cakes also on this site.

I made this a day ahead and it turned out great and was so easy! Instead of ice cream I made up some whipped cream and added a little creme de menthe syrup to it (beautiful pale green) and piped it on with a pastry bag. It got rave reviews from my guests!

We are having a dinner party and I tried this receipe last evening to critique it. Absolutely WONDERFUL!! I think using "good" chocolate and not overbaking (I baked this for 11 minutes) are the keys. EASY! I made a raspberry puree sauce, spooned approximately 3 tablespoons on the dessert plate, place molten cake on top, sifted powdered sugar over cake and topped with a small scoop of coffee ice cream. You could definately use vanilla also. Garnished with mint and fresh raspberries. Beautiful presentation and I will definately use this receipe for entertaining and also for my family too!

Served this last Saturday evening for a couple of friends. Halved the recipe as I only had 3 eggs in the house and I really only needed to serve 4. It was wonderful!! Received rave reviews from our guests. Can't wait to make it again this coming week for a party of 8. Used Perugina bittersweet chocolate - terrific!

I made this for a St. Patrick's Day dinner party and served it with Bailey's ice cream rather than the coffee. Guests were unanimous in their praise. I'd made other molten cake recipes previously, but one guest mentioned she liked this one best, in part because the sugar sprinkled on the custard cups gave it a little crunch.

AMAZING! I made it for a dinner party and wowed all the guests! I prepared it in advance and refrigerated it, which was great b/c it gave me more time to concentrate on making the actual dinner the day of. I've made it a number of times since and the quality of chocolate DOES matter, so get the best!

This was wonderful and very fast and easy. I would definately make this again for friends and family. Using good quality chocolate is key.

Fabulous! I made these in the morning with bittersweet Vahlrona & stored in the fridge until dinner party. Baked for 13 min. straight from the oven & inverted onto serving plates. Served with vanilla ice cream. EXTREMELY easy to make & great that they could be prepared ahead of time. I would recommend checking these after 10 min. as oven temp. may vary & these are best served underbaked. Thx!

One word of advice: After putting these in the oven, setting the timer, and accepting a phone call, DO NOT rely on your hubby to tell you when the timer goes off! Mine had black tops but were still good even if I was exploding like a volcano and exuding more "molten" than the cakes were!

Rating: 4
Hands down, my favorite dessert! Used Trader Joe's Pound Plus chocolate (excellent in this), and drizzled homemade raspberry sauce on plate before inverting cakes onto plate. So easy, and so impressive. A huge bonus is it's so easy to make ahead and store - ready to bake.

There is no doubt I will make this again. It is unbelievable, especially when you take into account how easy it is to prepare. Used Callebaut chocolate and topped with whipped cream, which melted and incorporated into the dessert. Yummy.

Outstanding! I made this recipe two days in a row: The first time, I used super high quality chocolate. It was perfection. The second time, I made it with Toll House chocolate chips. Believe me, use the good stuff! I also had better luck when well-chilling the cakes & moving them directly into the oven. If you bring them to room temp, they ware way too runny...

This is a GREAT dessert.....easy to make, with excellent results. I inverted them onto each plate with raspberry coulis and then topped with vanilla bean ice cream. Definitely a keeper!

These were heaven!!! As far as the type of chocolate, I had on hand a bar of Lindt 85% Cocoa (so dark, it's barely edible!), which I cut with a bar and a half of Lindt milk chocolate, and it was perfect. I baked these all at once and was worried about how to reheat them (there were only 2 of us!), but one minute in the microwave perks them right back up - they aren't gooey like they are from the oven, but they are still VERY moist and delicious. Word to the wise though, don't cook them any more than 13 minutes - I added a minute thinking they weren't done yet and some of the edges burned! Also, inverting them onto a plate is a must. Very easy to make!

This was easy to make and the end result looks and tastes much more complex! I followed the directions exactly. I served it with a swirl of chocolate sauce on the plate, strawberries and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I sprinkled powdered sugar on the top for an elegant presentation.

Rating: 4
These were amazing!! I couldn't find the chocolate they mentioned and just used Baker's semi-sweet and the result was just delicious!! Definitely empty the cake out onto a plate, break the center with a spoon, to let some of the chocolate ooze out and then scoop the icecream next to it, great presentation. Will make many more times to come!!!

Although the high quality chocolate can be hard to find, it is definitely worth the effort. Very elegant dessert. My friends raved!

Rating: 4
I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. I made it ahead and allowed it to get to room temperature before baking (like it says) and thought it was just o.k. The next day I tried it again and baked it while it was still cool, and the center was much creamier and more gooey. I'm so glad I didn't just throw it out the first day from frustration...

To previous Cook from Houston: Scharffenberger is 70% cocoa solids, not cocoa butter. Most chocolates don't list the percentage of cocoa butter, but you'll do fine with any high quality chocolate like Scharffenberger, Valrhona, or Callebaut.

Rating: 4
Good recipe! but What chocolate are you using? The recipe says "For best results, use a dark baking chocolate with high cocoa butter content (about 30 percent), such as Valrhona or Callebaut." These are hard to find. But on the other hand My Scharffen Berger Bittersweet is 70%!

This recipe was excellent, elegant and so easy. I served this for a dinner party and everyone raved.

This dessert has it all - it's quick, easy, delicious, and impressive - the perfect end to a dinner party. The only problem is that I kept having to beat my friends away from the batter! Next time I might add some liqueur to the batter, but it's lovely the way it is.

To Cook from Nashville: I agree with the Cook from Houston about the simple raspberry sauce. Add a few tablespoons of seedless blackberry jam when you puree the berries if you want a little thicker sauce. Beautiful, delicious and works with strawberries too!

This gets a 4 because of its ease and great taste. I took 4 souffle dishes to a dinner with 4 people, and wished I had brought all 8 - several of the guests could have gone for 2nds, and this was on top of lots of appetizers and a great dinner!

I am not much of a baker, so I was very pleased at how easy this recipe was to make, and how impressive the outcome was. I inverted it and topped it with mocha almond fudge ice cream, and sprinkled godiva semi-sweet chocolate powder around the plate; will definitely make it for company in the future.

Could anyone please tell me how to make a raspberry sauce that would go nicely with this?

If you love the little chocolate cakes you can get in some better restaurants for dessert, the kind with the slightly liquid center, then this is the resipe you have been searching for! Definitely invert onto a plate and serve with ice cream, straw/rasp sauce, or whipped cream. I added about 2T Kahlua to the chocolate after it was melted; I believe coffee flavor enhances chocolate flavor. Can definitely be made one day ahead, with perfect results. I used Girardhelli chocolate from the grocery store, 1/2 bittersweet, 1/2 semi-sweet

By far my favorite and easiest dessert recipe! Trader Joe's Belgian Chocolate works wonderful for this also and is very inexpensive. This is great with a raspberry sauce and/or powdered sugar too!

I prepared this dessert this morning and decided to taste test a single serving...WOW! This desset is extremely easy to make and the results are sensational. A chocolate lovers dream! Thank you to the cook who recommend inverting each cake. The presentation is much more impressive that way.

My wife says this should be rated a four + four. This was so simple yet so good. It can be made ahead and heated just befor serving. It also keeps so you can heat it the second day. While rich the texture is relatively light. Absolutely the best we have tasted from this site.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! But I have a serving suggestion to offer. After removing the cakes from the oven, let them sit for 2 to 3 minutes (to set up slightly and thus prevent breaking). Then, invert the ramekins onto the serving plates. The cake is easier to eat this way than if you serve it in the ramekin. Plus, when you break into it with your fork or spoon, the gooey filling will run onto the plate. Much more dramatic than the original serving suggestion.

A friend brought this and it was absolutely delicious. Make ahead, can be taken and baked.

I have been trying to duplicate a budino we love from a local restaurant. This recipe has come the closest. I added warm caramel sauce and candied almonds and hazel nuts. The result received rave reviews.

Rating: 0
To the cook on 2/14; the photo shows the cake served in the ramekin, with ice cream on top. I think it would detract from the combination to cool them (warm, gooey chocolate and cold coffee ice cream....yum!). The butter may just be to make it easier for the diner to eat it out of the dish. (To view the photo, click on the camera icon next to the recipe title)

Are the cakes supposed to be removed from the ramekins before serving? Isn't that why they are buttered? Cool first?

Rating: 3
I have made this several times. It is very easy and has the advantage that it can be prepared in advance and baked at the last minute. It is very, very rich, I made my last batch in a larger ramekin and was sorry because no one could finish their portion - too much of a good thing. I usually serve it with a raspberry or tart strawberry sauce. The contrast between the ice cold sauce and the molten chocolate is great.

I made this dessert for Christmas dinner and served it with a drizzle of chocolate brandy sauce. It was so easy because I made it a day ahead and baked it while we ate. This recipe is a keeper.

Rating: 4
This is a simple, elegant, delicious, make-ahead dessert that will "wow" guests. I used ramekins that area a bit larger than the 1/3-cup size referred to in this recipe, so I was only able to fill six of them, rather than eight. I baked the cakes for an extra five minutes, and they still turned out perfectly. I substituted vanilla ice cream and served coffee on the side. I will definitely make this again!

I first tasted this cake at a very memorable meal in Paris and was on a mission to replicate it. This is the closest recipe so far and it is very good. I used Callebaut chocolate and served is with Dreamery Vanilla ice cream and a bittersweet chocolate sauce
