This is a pretty basic recipe, but a good guide for making fried potato chips. I second @justinic about patting the potatoes dry. If they're wet, the oil will spatter and they'll burn, or reach a dark brown faster. Used up a lot of paper towels just trying to drain them. Other tips?

I love this ! I do in fact have to slice my own potatoes therefore some are larger than others - It is a good idea after the first 10 min to watch closely, I took the thinner ones out while cooking the larger ones a little longer - But they turned out GREAT !

I love this recipe. I use parchment paper and they don't stick at all. Also, after about 15 minutes, I start taking out the ones that are cooked and leaving the others that need more time to cook for a few moments. That way the chips are all perfect. Great with hamburgers!

The chips turned out just OK. They were a bit too greasy.

This was very simple! The taste was good, but did have to cook them much longer then noted. I think it was almost 20 minutes, but they are a nice side item or snack.

Sounded like a great idea, but the little chips baked onto my pan like gum on blacktop. Hard to get off. Maybe I need new pans....

This is a great-tasting recipe that is fairly quick to prepare. A great way to change up your potato side for a weeknight. I like to make these as a side for a gourmet sandwich, but is also flexible enough to be used as a side for pork chops. Here are a few tips...make sure you cover each slice with oil...otherwise some chips turn out perfect and others are burned to a dark brown. I use a drying rack to bake these on...you will use less oil than you would on a baking sheet and they come off the rack better. I sprinkled these with salt/pepper before and after baking. I also used smoked paprika after baking...tasted great. These also seemed better tating when they were cooled to room temperature! This is a great fact so you could make them earlier than the main or side.

One thing that you should always do before you make these, is after you've sliced them, PAT THEM DRY. This is essential anytime you want something to have a nice crisp to it.

The chips are hit and miss. Some are crispy while others a bit soggy. Either way, they're still pretty tasty.

I followed the recipe except I found the potatoes took a little longer than 12 minutes to cook. I took them out at around 20 minutes and let them sit for a while and all I got was potato slices. They weren't crispy at all. It tasted like I baked potatoes in olive oil...nothing special. They weren't bad, we ate them, but they weren't what I was looking for.

this recipe would have been a four-forker had the instructions overlooked one key step: OIL THE BAKING SHEET GENEROUSLY. perhaps i should have assumed, but didn 't. anyway, could be great but don't miss this crucial step or you're fried!

Great flavor, just watch how much oil you use. My first two batches were too oily, but still tasty.

I used too much oil in the first batch, but the second batch (when I followed the directions) was great. Also, remember to set the timer, they burn quickly.
