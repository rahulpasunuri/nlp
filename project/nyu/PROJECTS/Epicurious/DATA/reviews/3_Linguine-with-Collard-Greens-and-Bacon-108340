I made this tonight, but a few modifications given what I had in the fridge. I had collard and kale from my CSA and used both. I also used whole wheat linguini and sauteed spicy sausage instead of the bacon. I don't think the tomatoes are necessary. The richness of the sausage balanced with bitterness of greens. The tomatoes didn't add much and were two sweet.

First time to have cooked Collard Greens and it was actually pretty tasty. The recipe seemed too watery towards the end, so I left it all simmering for about 5 minutes uncovered to help cook off the water. The only other change would be to go lighter on the oil and let garlic and shallots simmer with the greens longer. Will make again, just not part of a standard rotation. C+

Good. I needed something to do w/collards I got from my CSA, and this fit the bill. I did not have pine nuts so used chopped walnuts, and substituted leek for the shallots.

This recipe was very tasty! Collard greens have a very strong flavor and the bacon and pine nuts mixed with it very well! However, this dish does not store and reheat well - the collard greens become more potent over time in the fridge.

Wonderful! I had kale and spinach in the fridge, so that is what I used. Made two changes: fewer pine nuts and much less water. Even tough greens cook in very little water if the lid is on tight. This made for a very intense flavor and nicely textured greens. I don't like soggy greens!

This is a great way to use up extra collards from the garden. I loved the flavors in this recipe. My only semi-criticism is that this ends up being a very heavy dish. It would be great for guests though because it only takes a little to fill you up.

Bitter from the collards, hot from the red chiles- DELISH. (Use collards, I can't imagine how this dish would suffer if spinach or other greens were substituted.)

I also used Swiss Chard and thought the flavors were perfect together. There's a great recipe for Chicken and Swiss Chard Enchilada Casserole on this site--a great use of the roasted chickens you can buy at the grocery store for a quick meal.

I used swiss chard instead of collard greens and we loved it!

This is a superb combination. My son needs substitute for calcium and I always look for good recipes with dark greens. A good variation of it is to thin slice the collard greens, sautée in olive oil and garlic. Steaming the greens eliminates the nice crispness coming from sautée method. Also it takes just a few minutes to prepare as you can eliminate the step requiring steaming for 15 minutes. We can also substitute bacon with a good sausage (with no sugar added) and it brings a wonderful flavor. Try it for yourself!

I don't know where the writers got the 50-minute figure for preparing this dish--it took easily twice that amount of time for me to prep and cook this. Actually, I'm angry about how much time it took--I'd never have bothered with this rather mediocre pasta dish if I'd realize I'd spend the whole evening making it. The collards take quite a while to cook down--much longer than the recipe indicates--and chopping 3 lbs of collards takes a long time. Since there are many good recipes with collard greens on Epicurious, this dish was not worth the effort.

Oops - meant 3 forks instead of one.
