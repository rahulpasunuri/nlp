Wonderful. Most reviewers seemed to complain of a flat flavor. I sure fixed that...added a few tablespoons of fried crumbled bacon. Perfection!! We loved this and will definately make it again!

Just a tip, folks... This recipe could be greatly improved by substituting white wine for any portion of the milk in the sauce. Vermouth works best, but any white wine will do. It will add an elusive level of refinement.

Wow!!! Even my picky children loved this one!! I used extra nutmeg, plenty of salt and pepper and added quite a bit of parmesan cheese to flavor the cream sauce a bit more. DELICIOUS!

Bechamel is bland unless you make it NOT bland. I made mine with sliced onion (sweated in the butter before adding the flour), fresh thyme and a bit more than called for of freshly ground nutmeg, let the onion and herbs steep a while, then sieved it and proceeded with the recipe. I also added a whole clove while cooking the onions and peas. I used sugar snaps, it worked just fine.

I used small white potatoes, added lots of salt and white pepper and added the parmesan like suggested by earlier reviewers. I served it with salmon, salad, whole grain bread, and steamed broccoli. My co-workers (all men) said it was delicious.

Wonderful way to use up the new potatoes from hubby's garden! This one will get made throughout the year. Nice recipe!

I made this to accompany the Crown Roast of Lamb with Rosemary and Oregano, so I didn't want strong flavors that would compete with the lamb. I did add 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese and thought it was just right to go with the lamb. However, I agree with the other cooks that it is a bit on the bland side and will try adding gorgonzola for more flavor another time.

It's true. When I initially read this recipe, I knew from experience that it would be bland. White sauce being one of the blandest things I know. One tip with white sauce of any kind is to salt salt salt, and use fresh ground pepper. I loved the gorgonzola tip, and added about 1/2 cup, crumbled in at the very end, so there were still chunky bits and when it is heated, you get the occasional burst of melty bleu cheese flavor. I also used fresh pearl onions and sauteed them well in butter, some of the skins flaked off and got crispy, which added to the texture. We had to transport it to someone's house, so I put it in a casserole and didn't stir it very well, just left it in a non combined state, heated it when we got there, and then transferred it to a serving bowl, which completed the combining process.

The last guy was very right. This is bland, but if you add some parm cheese (i added probably a half a cup like he said), it's pretty good. in fact, i can't imagine eating this without it. this seems like a good base recipe-- something you can experiment with...next time i might add gorgonzola or something.

Disappointing, especially after such good reviews. The cream sauce had no flavor even though I added a generous scraping of nutmeg. My family wasn't so thrilled either. The white sauce is lacking something, it just tastes like warm cream and flour - not too appealing. I would omit the nutmeg and put at least 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese and one egg in the sauce, then it would be much tastier and more satisfying.

I am not sure if I should credit beginner's luck or a good recipe but this dish is fantastic. It was my first time making a creamy sauce and it turned out smooth and delicious. I thought I was eating in a restaurant.

Creamed potatoes are a favorite of my fiances family, but I had never cooked them myself until making them for a family Easter dinner. When I went to the store to buy the baby red potatoes they weren't any in good condition so I ended up buying new baby white potatos and these worked just as well. Long after people were complaining of being too full from dinner they kept finding room for one more spoonful of potatoes and peas.
