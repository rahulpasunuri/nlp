Easy, Heathy, & Delicious! I serve this as a side for Chicken Tinga Tacos. I add a little extra cumin because I like bold flavors.

It was good. Super easy and quick. Will probably make again without the mashing.

I had the classic kitchen experience of prepping all the ingredients and then finding out that there are no black beans in the house. I am happy to report that this recipe worked very well with kidney beans. I will cut back on the broth the next time as I left my beans unmashed and it took too long to boil down - ended up adding a squeeze of tomato paste to thicken it up a bit and will do that again the next time I make this. And I will of course make this recipe with the main ingredient - black beans!

I made this without ingredient changes but did not do much mashing. It definitely needed a while to boil down to a thick enough consistency. Oh, I did use vegetable broth because of vegetarians in the group. Some very discerning diners commented that these are some terrific beans! I'm printing this for my recipe collection...

Easy and delicious. I find the results can vary quite a bit from one batch to another, no doubt depending on the quality of the garlic and other ingredients. Whenever I make this dish, I leave the jalapeno unseeded, increase the cumin to 1 tsp, and reduce the stock to 1.5 cups or less. I often increase the garlic, and if the final dish lacks punch, I add a couple of tsp. each of sherry and red wine/sherry vinegar.

Doubled this recipe for a party of 8, everyone ate it and I got some positive reviews! Guests also had fun helping with the mashing - could be a fun, healthy recipe to get kids involved in. :) I would go easy with the chicken broth: I only put 1/2 of it in and still had to boil it down for a bit after mashing, so it wouldn't be so soupy. Next time I will put all the ingredients in, adding broth as I mash the beans until they reach the right consistency (just like mashed potatoes). Bon appetit! :D :D :D

Lovely simple dish. Left out the jalapenos and used a few good swigs of Tabasco Chipotle sauce, which gave a slight smokey flavour.

These were liked by everyone at a dinner party - as a side dish to fajitas. I did end up adding another cup of beans as otherwise they would have been too soupy. Very easy to make.

I made this to go with carnitas tacos and rice. Per previous recommendations, I used the amount of spices listed with 1 cup of broth and one can of beans. My husband absolutely loved it and I thought they were OK. Next time I won't mash the beans, as I felt that they were dryer because of it.

These are the absolute best black beans I have ever had! Following some of the comments, I put in a bit more garlic and cumin than the recipe calls for. I also put in a hefty dose of lime juice. They were quite successful at dinner tonight. I will definitely make these again and again!!

This was great. I made what my friend and I call burrito bowl - basically just rice and beans and all sorts of great toppings: corn, bell pepper, onion, cheese, toms, etc. Cheap, quick, pretty healthy(if you dont load it down with sour cream) Will be taking to work for the next few days.

This is my go to beans recipe. I allways use 6-7 cloves of garlic and Im very generous with the cumin. One time I had forgot to use the lime and it just wasn't the same. So now i always use the lime. I have also substituted veggie broth for vegetarian meals. Enjoy! Oh and I normally make a double recipe. They allways go fast. YUM!

This is a simple recipe with an amazing flavor. I'll make this on a Sunday evening and use them for easy lunches during the week. Just heat and throw in a tortilla with cheese, sliced quacamole and a little salsa...awesome!

I really love this recipe - I've made it several times now. It's easy enough to make for just myself (it's good left over) and good enough to serve to guests as a side dish. If I'm making it for just myself, these beans and rice make a complete meal. I start with cooking 1/2 minced onion in the oil. I use 2 jalapenos, cayenne, ground chipotle and 1-2 t. cumin. I put one can of the beans with some chicken broth in the blender before adding and leave the other can whole - much easier than mashing in the skillet. For me what really pushes this stuff into deliciousness though is the lime juice added at the end. It thickens quite a bit as it cools, so turn off the heat when it still seems too watery. This recipe has become a real favorite of mine. It's cheap to make, healthy and absolutely delicious.

I love this recipe! It is such an easyside dish-flavorful enough, but still simple. The beans taste refried, but they're not as heavy and fattening! I served them with enchiladas and corn and radish salad for a yummy mexican feast!

Rating: 4
This is a new favorite of ours. Quick, easy and tastes fabulous. I have made this at least 4 times and I believe the amount of stock is exactly correct. However, if it isn't thickening quickly as it should, then you may need to mash it more thoroughly. I think the more you mash the more starch you release and the thicker the beans get. Also it always seems to get thicker as it cools. One last note - if you love cumin (as I do) be generous; I add at least 1 - 2 teaspoons and it tastes great.

Rating: 3
So easy and so tasty. Had to use canned chipotles in adobo as I didn't have a jalapeno. Tasted great and everything was right there in the pantry. The amount of broth was just right - even added a bit more at the end as the mixture really thickened up after mashing.

Rating: 3
This is good, but not outstanding. I added onion to mine and only used 2/3 of the chicken broth. I'm going to experiment with the spices and see if I can't make it just right. Still, a very reliable basic mashed (semi-refried?) black bean recipe.

Rating: 3
Great side dish for a mexican meal, nice flavours and easy to make.

Rating: 3
I felt the recipe was quick, easy and delicious. Reviews suggest adding more beans, or reducing the amount of chicken stock used, but I felt the amount was perfect because when boiling the beans with the stock (after mashing them) I boiled long enough to let the stock reduce and the mixture thickened (it took longer than the suggested 10 minutes). It also thickens while cooling. Mmmm...

Rating: 3
Great concept, but I think you need to half the chicken stock, otherwise, I found it to be more a soup than a side dish. I didn't have fresh jalapenos, so I used the jarred version and then added some red pepper flakes to add some spice. I also kept about 1/2 cup of the black beans for the end, rather than mashing them up. It added to its appearance. I would make it again, but with those changes...

Excellent beans - I followed the recipe except I added a little more cumin and garlic. I didn't mash the beans but did cook them longer than stated which resulted in thick deliciousness.

These are delicious. I mashed about 1/2 the beans and left the rest whole, which ended up breaking down in the cooking process. Cooked them about 40 minutes, to cook off all the liquid. Would have even added more garlic, jalepno and cumin, but i like LOTS of flavor. I will be making these MUCH more often!

Very tasty beans. I've made it a few times and my favorite method is to mash some of the beans and leave the rest whole. The mashed beans release their starch and help with the sauce consistency and the whole beans present nicely.

This was delicious - the best mexican beans I've ever had (even better than Charro Chicken). I took other reviewers suggestions and didn't smash the beans and added a lot of lime. In addition, I also added half of the Chicken Broth and the beans were still really saucy. Very tasty!

I love black beans and this is the perfect recipe. I even forgot to add the lime juice at the end and they were still great. I did modify the recipe slightly. I added about 2x the amount of recommended garlic and some crushed red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit more. I also cooked longer than recommended at a lower temp and only mashed a portion of the beans. I will definitely make this again, curious how great it is with the lime juice added!

Fantastic. I served it alongside flank steak fajitas and a fresh corn salad. The only thing I did differently was to add more cumin and garlic(beans are bland by nature) and to slow cook the beans for about an hour so they wouldn't stick to the bottom of the pan. An easy, tasty side dish.

This is OK but nothing to rave about. Next time I make it I will saute the garlic, chile, and cumin with a slice of bacon instead of oil to bring up more flavor.

I rarely give 4 forks, but I can't imagine how black beans could be any better than these. My husband, not a bean lover, actually went back for seconds of just the beans! That is saying a lot. I wanted to sit down with a spoon and just eat a big bowl of these beans. Delicious. Followed recipe but added a little extra garlic and used vegetarian veg broth. Served with green rice and fish tacos and crumbled queso seco on top of beans. Can't wait to make these again.

I hate to be one of those obnoxious Epicurious reviewers that writes a review of a recipe to which they've made so many changes it's unrecognizable. However, I kind of did that here, as I was out of all sorts of ingredients. They were still great. Used water instead of broth, and a little lemon juice instead of lime-the lime would've made them fantastic, I think

Follow the recipe. These beans were delicious. Go ahead and mash the beans, it helps them absorb the broth. They won't be pretty, but unless you're serving toddlers, your guests should be able to handle it. If you let the beans really boil they should thicken in the 15 minutes indicated by the recipe. Enjoy!

I didn't realize a healthy black bean recipe could taste as good as or better than a refried black bean recipe using fat. I loved these, and 2 adults and 1 child easily wiped out the 6 person servings. I forgot to add the lime juice, but look forward to using it the next time I make these.

This is a good, simple recipe. I took a suggestion not to mash the beans, and I think it is better, plus it looks more appealing. Use lots of lime juice for a fresh taste and I would suggest low or no salt beans for better flavor. Great with Crispy Pork Carnitas

These beans are great, you just can't follow the recipe exactly. After putting all of the ingredients into the sauce pan let it really simmer hard for up to an hour, keep stirring often and don't burn them. You will love the flavor, and the uses once these are made are endless!

Made this last night as part of a mexican theme dinner. The idea was great, but the liquid didn't absorb! It was on the stove for about an hour while the enchiladas baked, and it still didn't thicken up. We used it as a black bean sauce for the enchiladas, very tasty, but better as a soup or sauce. I will try it again, the flavor was great, but maybe with half (or less) the chicken broth.

This is a good side dish. It took longer than 10 minutes for the liquid to absorb...probably almost 20 minutes. I continued smashing the beans and they did thicken up. I added feta cheese to the top as another cook suggested.

This is so much better than the 20 other from scratch black bean recipes I've tried over the years. I double the cumin. When I'm in a hurry I shorten it by boiling one can of beans in it's liquid with cumin until most of the liquid is evaporated and I don't mash them. I'm serious these are better than most restaurant versions and couldn't be easier. You won't believe how good these are!

This is absolutely my FAVORITE black bean recipe. I make these "refried"beans almost every week and serve them in a variety of ways. They are great on open faced tostadas and also as a side dish along with fresh tuna steaks. Sandwich a hot tostada between the black beans and the tuna steak and you have a delicious meal. Do allow 20 minutes for the bean liquid to cook off.

Delicious! Great "refried" black beans with a wonderful taste. Takes a lot longer to cook off the broth/stock than 10 minutes--more like 30, but well worth the time.
