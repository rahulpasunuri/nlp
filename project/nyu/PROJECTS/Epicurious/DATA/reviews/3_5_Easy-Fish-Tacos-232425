Good salsa. Probably should marinate the fish or dry season it in advance. Or use a fish more flavorful than halibut. We couldn't really taste the fish. Husband suggested crema instead of low-fat sour cream, but that would of course change its value for dieters. It doesn't taste very Mexican. Husband said he would rather use a different recipe. I'd do this again with modifications because it's so easy.

I really liked this recipe because it was very easy to make and it tasted delicious:)

I forgot to add that the salsa was definitely the best part, and that I didn't put the refried beans or cabbage in my tacos since the beans didn't seem like they would complement and I had no cabbage on hand.

This was delicious! I found this recipe when I was looking for something to do with my leftover tilapia, and did everything the recipe asked for except a couple of things: I left out the sour cream, subbed cayenne for chili powder, and used soft and hard corn tortillas instead of flour. I served this with black beans simmered with bacon, and corn,onions and cilantro. One of my favorite taco meals.

The salsa is really the star of this meal, since the fish itself turned out a little bland for me even after I upped the chili powder to 2 tsp and the fresh lime juice for the fish to a whole lime, and I marinated for a half hour. Maybe I'm just not a fish taco kind of guy? My local supermarket just happened to have some very ripe, juicy mangoes, which really added a sweet "wow" factor to the mix. I also added a ripe avocado to the salsa, the creaminess of which I thought balanced out the sweetness of the mangoes and gave the salsa a little more "heft," and a little salt just to bring out all of the flavors. Don't be afraid to put the juice of a whole lime in the salsa...it can handle it. I warmed up a can of low-sodium black beans for the side, but will just add them directly into the salsa next time, cold. I will definitely make the salsa again, just to have on its own!!

We used leftover whitefish from last night's dinner out... what an amazing use of leftover fish! Since the fish was already cooked, we just warmed it in the toaster oven. We sauteed the onion just a bit with EVOO and the chili powder and then added that to the salsa ( I added some green onion to the salsa). Combined the fish, salsa and monterrey jack cheese in a whole wheat tortilla, then warmed it in the onion-sautee pan to crisp it up and melt the cheese. Served with corn bread muffin. Amazing!

I marinated the fish for a couple of hours too before cooking it. I also took the advice of others and added chili flakes to the marinade. I pan cooked the fish which worked out really well. I decided to add cucumbers to the salsa and it was excellent!

The first time I made this recipe, I thought it could use more "gusto" so after a few attempts, I've found that adding chili flakes and 1/2 of a minced jalapeno to the fish marinade as well as letting it sit in the marinade for an hour or so really helps it out. I've also made the recipe with a fish/shrimp combination with great success!

Edible, but definitely not good. Dissapointing, and pretty tasteless.

Great taste and presentation with little effort. Couldn't find fish in freezer so I used chicken (cubed and marinated for an hour in the oil/lime/chili powder)then stirr fried with a little fish sauce. Salsa is so easy and so good!

I used the recipe as a base- but ended up using Chili Flour tortillas, threw in some cheese and olives and rolled it up like a wrap. Tasty!
