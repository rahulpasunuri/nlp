I used fat free half and half to make it a bit lighter. Amazing taste, though a bit spicy since my peppers seemed to be extra hot! Added much more half and half, which cut the spice considerably.

Love this soup. I added 1 tbsp of diced cooked pancetta at the end for a heartier flavor.

The cilantro was overbearing on this recipe. It made the soup inedible. Next time I'll try it without any cilantro.

This soup was fantastic. Just the right amount of spice and consistency. I added a slice of monterey jack cheese to the top of each serving and put it under the broiler. Next time I'll shred the cheese.

I haven't made the recipe yet, but I just have to add that poblano peppers ARE NOT the same as pasilla peppers. They are very different variants and incorrectly called "pasillas" in California.

This soup was very good and had just the right amount of heat. I prefer a more hearty soup so I added some shredded chicken to it. Wonderful!

Most talked about soup I've ever made. Delicious! Poblanos vary in heat strength. I happened to get pretty hot ones. I added more cream but the roasted pepper flavor was excellent.

This was delicious! Personally I'm a dave's insanity sauce person but people thought this was spicy? Poblanos? I ended up putting some cayenne in mine.

This was really good but a bit too spicy for my taste even tho I added more cream. I agree with other cooks that it's not a stand alone but is a great first course. I won't make again because it seems to take too much time.

Awfully nice of them to show you how to double the recipe, but maybe someone should tell them it's easier just to multiply by 2...

WOW. This was great. Followed the recipe to the letter, couldn't be better. Did serve it with a little grated monteray jack cheese as a garnish. Mmm good.

An excellent dish. I could eat it as a meal by itself

This was unbearably spicy for us (even those who love heat). Next time I'll taste each pepper so that I'm aware of how hot they are. I had taken a small bite of one and it was more fruity than spicy so I assumed the rest would be too. Big mistake! You could really tell it would be delish if it wasn't so horribly hot! I dumped in as much cream was in the house trying to tame it, but it didn't help much. Will try again though!

This is a great soup - hearty and filling - I used half and half instead of cream and cut up venison smoked sausage and jarlsberg chesse as condiments at the table.

This is just a great soup! I didn't have mint or parsley so added extra cilantro. I added a medium russet potato and made sure it was very, very cooked (falling apart), then pureed with imersion blender. I bet I didn't use the 1/4 cup cream...more like 1/8 cup. Potato helped add creaminess. Try this...I bet you'll like it.

I found this soup very elegant and a great starter for my dinner party. A good Sauvignon Blanc complimented it very nicely. The poblanos I used had good flavor - a little heat but not too much.

Like the previous reviewer, my poblanos were slightly on the bland side. To perk it up a bit and bring it up to the level of 'delicious' I added corn, and topped the soup with cheese and chopped serrano (seeds included...I like it spicy). Served it with toasts topped with a little bit of cayenne and cumin. Mmmmmm....

I thought this was a very elegant, smooth first course. Even with the sour cream finish, I dont think this is hearty enough to be a stand alone. My peppers were extremely mild, which was slighty disappointing.

I used Anaheim Peppers roasted otherwise made it as shown. This was fantastic! To kick it up a notch I added some Emeril's Essence - Super! My husband had two bowls and said, this is a keeper!!! I buy roasted peppers at my farmers market so it saves a lot of time. I would definately make this again and again. I did like the idea of the sour cream that would be good. Had a drop left for the next day and it was even better.

With a lot of alteration this soup was very good. The caveat at the beginning of the recipe (in the Feb 2001 issue) regarding the varying spice of the Poblano peppers needed to be in bold print! The recipe as it is printed was not edible as a soup, but made a very good (very spicy) sauce. To save the first course I removed about half of the original amount of soup the recipe made. I then added 2 full cups of cream and another 3 cups of chicken broth and about 1/4 cup of honey. Lastly, we served it over a large dollop of sour cream with lime wedges on the side. When our guests stirred in the sour cream, it made all the difference in the world. If I made this again, I'd use a half pound of Poblanos and perhaps some of the other additions I mentioned as needed.
