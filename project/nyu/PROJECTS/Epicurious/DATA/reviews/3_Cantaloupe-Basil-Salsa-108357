Although I love all these ingredients, I don't think they work together. I was very disappointed and sorry that I wasted such a yummy lope.

This was yummy. I made due with what I had - some red onion, and added a touch more basil and some extra herbs - mint and pinapple sage. I also threw everything unchopped (well, the cantelope & onion were in very large chunks) into the ole food processor. I am sure that the texture suffered some, but when you have two screaming kids - texture or sanity, texture or sanity. Sanity and speed won. The flavor was cool, salsa like, but slightly different. Great with chips. Will make again when I have another monster-size cantelope I need to get rid of, but not sure it will go into my all time fave collection. Great idea though!

Absolutely hated it! I did not want to see salmon for at least a month. The vidalia onion was too strong (and a bad mix) for the cantaloupe. The cantaloupe was too bland with the fish. Try making with mango and very little onion.

It seems weird to be giving a salsa "dish beyond compare" but this one really deserves it. Spicy, refreshing, delicious. Don't skimp on the basil.

this was surprisingly delicious and easy. i made it with red onion and red pepper flakes, it was still excellent and the color combination makes it a very attractive summer side dish. i will definitely make this at my next party.

Delicious with lamb kabobs!! Would work with any grilled meats. Definitely a keeper.

Just had leftovers of this for lunch with some prosciutto; great combination.

This is terrific! It has become my absolute favorite way to eat (grilled or roasted) salmon on hot summer evenings - and I eat a lot of salmon!
