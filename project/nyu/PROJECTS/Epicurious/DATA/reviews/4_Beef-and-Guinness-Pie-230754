I made this for St. Patrick's Day and served it with the Baked Cabbage with Bacon and the Irish pub salad (both from this site). The meal was a huge success. I was able to make everything a head and all dishes worked well together. the only change I made was I used store-bought butter puff pastry. I will make this again and if I have time I will make the pastry myself

Wonderfully tasty entree - very eye appealing as well. It received rave reviews from my Irish guests and picky husband. I served it with colcannon for the perfect St. Patrick's Day dinner.

I braised the mixture in a thermal vacuum cooker from morning until evening when this was presented with corned beef & cabbage. OMG. I have to admit, this is my second attempt at this recipe so I had better success this time around, but this is one of those recipes that just has to be experimented with until that perfect balance is found. Talk about FUN! A few suggestions to enhance the flavor of your meet....since you're braising/thermal cooking/slow cooking, choose a well marbled cut of steak/bison. If you choose bison or organic, REMEMBER that these meats are lower in fat per pound than regular steak and you may have to keep any eye on the meat frequently. I experienced approximately 1/3 less cook time than recommended with organic beef/bison. I attempted a twice as thick puffed pastry this year and it still turned out DELICIOUS and CRISPY CRUSTY! It may be worth it to leave your crust with a little more thickness than is recommended. MORE EXPERIMENTS NEXT YEAR!! THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!

The flavors of the stew are delicious. The green peppercorns did add a little something and I will use them in other stews from now on. I did not end up with much liquid from this recipe. I might have cooked it too long.

This was excellent! I skipped the peppercorns but followed everything else exactly. So delicious! My husband absolutely loved it. Definitely something I would serve to guests and a perfect alternative to corned beef on St. Pat's Day.

Loved this. I used a pie crust and put puff pastry strips on top. Wonderful. I just extended cook time about 5 minutes or so. I also had added i leek and 1 carrot for a bit more vegetable substance. Reduce the beef stock by half if using the pie crust, and it produces extra for another small pie.

This is a fantastic recipe and the Guinness enhances it quite a bit. It does take a long time so I did have to try a shortcut version that ended up being incredibly delicious as well - here it is: http://www.neurotickitchen.com/2013/03/weeknight-shortcut-beef-and-guinness.html

I made this last year for St. Paddy's Day and it was such a hit I am doing it again this year. I doubled the recipe and transported the stew to a friend's, and didn't want to deal with ramekins and pastry for 6 people, so served it over mashed potatoes. Agree this stew is delicious in its simplicity so planning sides of cabbage and carrots.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe as written. Very rich has others have mentioned. I braised the meat longer and slower than the recipe called for. 4 hours at 300. I also tripled the recipe as it does reduce down quite a bit. Using 7 lbs of beef I ended up with 8 large individual ramekins which I put in the freezer. Half the ramekins I filled to the top and then will add the pastry back on top once thawed. The other great way to use this stew is to top it with mashed potatoes like a sheperd's pie.....then pop it back in the oven until the potatoes puff up and get a nice golden brown crust....absolutely delicious alongside a nice fresh salad to brighten the meal up. Will definitely always keep a batch of this in my freezer....company worthy.

This is awesome! Made this to celebrate our return from a trip to Ireland, and everyone loved it. I do not use the water or the tomato paste, and I increase the Guinness to 2 cups. Although the brined green peppercorns are optional, they really add something to the recipe. I like to substitute pearl onions for the coarsely chopped onion - Simply parboil them for a minute to skin them and then add in the last 30 minutes. I like to add 1/2 pound of small button mushrooms at this stage too. I don't always make a crust - only for special occasions - and then I use puff pastry - so much easier! This freezes beautifully.

My husband's Canadian family has meat pie for Christmas Eve dinner. I knew there had to be a better, more flavorful recipe than the one they've used for generations. This is it! Any really good stout works. We used Tallgrass Brewing Company's Buffalo Sweat. Mmmmm. Can't wait for Christmas.

Rating: 4
Delicious but incredibly rich. I made the stew as written (except for the peppercorns) but skipped the crust. It does cook down a bit, but a small serving goes a LONG way. The sauce has a distinctive irony bite from the Guinness. I served it with crusty bread, but next time I will either add potatoes to the stew or serve it atop mashed potatoes or noodles - it needs a starch to cut the richness a bit. A keeper!

Rating: 3
Totally agree that this make a scant serving for 4. Next time I will 1 1/2 or double the recipe. To avoid frostbitten fingers from grating the butter for the pastry,I'll grate the butter with the grating blade from my food processor, then stick flour and butter into the freezer for a while to get it cold again. Puff pastry is really good, much better and less expensive than store bought, and really not difficult to make.

I agree totally that this is a scant amount for 4 servings. Next time I'll 1 1/2 or double the recipe. That aside, it is delicious. The puff pastry is wonderful, so much better than store-bought.Grating the butter completely frostbit my fingers, so the next time I'll use the grating disk on the food processor, then stick grated butter and flour into the freezer before beginning the rolling process.

I agree with the Philly chef who says stick to the integrity of the recipe and save the carroty stew for a different night. This was a thick, rich wintry night treat for St. Paddy's Day. I transported it to a friend's so opted out of the crust, but won't skip next time. A note that by the time it cooks down, it makes scant servings for four with no leftovers. Double the recipe!

I tried this for St. Patrick's Day and it was a huge hit. It has great depth of flavor. I've made it again since and added carrots and potatoes (the latter 45 minutes before the end of cooking) and didn't find they detracted at all from the dish. I also cooked it at 300 degrees, based on experience with other stews, and found it came out fine after 1.5 to 2 hours. I also made it the day before the first time to help blend the flavors, and found it had a layer of fat that could be removed before reheating it. I also didn't make the pastry, but served it with rustic bread. I've made other pot pies and the dough isn't as good in my opinion as a good French or Italian bread. This will be my go-to recipe for beef stew from now on.

Rating: 4
I make this regularly, without the pastry, and we love it. I've tried many of the variations and have to say I find that it's best sticking to the integrity of the original recipe. And I strongly caution against the use of carrots, they completely change the taste, and rob it of it's richness! I also recommend serving with your favorite mashed potatoes, if time permits, rather than adding potatoes to the stew. Not sure the reason some are subbing ketchup, but the tomato paste gives it extra depth, where I think ketchup would be like adding sugar... Making it tonight for our St. Patty's day company tomorrow - it is even better the second day! Slainte!

I made this using a combination of both beef and venison top round. The venison really brought out the flavor of the sauce and stood up better to the strong flavors as well. I followed the ideas of adding potatoes, carrots and mushrooms and it's a one-dish meal.

This is such a fantastic stew! My husband spent time at University in Edinburgh and said it reminded him of being back in Scotland (except for the pastry part). I followed the recipe, but did add diced potatoes and carrots to make it heartier. I also added extra liquid (beer) because I cooked it longer to help bring everything together and the meat more tender. Used frozen puff pastry and it turned out beautifully. Absolutely delicious! Especially on a snowy night :) Will be a staple this winter.

This was amazing. I doubled the recipe, added a bag of frozen sliced carrots and a container of baby Bella's sliced in half. I also just used store bought puff pastry. Finally, I served it over *gasp* seasoned tater tots! It was perfect. I am having a dinner party in a few weeks and will be serving this. Enjoy!

This is wonderful. I just made it as a stew, skipping the pie part to save calories, and I think it is the best beef stew I've ever had. Husband loved it. Didn't have any green peppercorns, but otherwise followed recipe pretty closely. Added some carrots and potatoes at the end. The only thing I didn't like was the texture of the sauce because of the chopped onions. Next time I'll either use chunks of onion or puree the sauce before serving.

Rating: 4
This is my absolute favorite recipe. I have made this a few times and it always comes out wonderful and is a big hit with my boyfriend. I've added potatoes to it midway through cooking last time and they came out just perfect. I actually use this recipe without the pastry dough sometimes and it makes a wonderful stew all on its own. :)

Rating: 4
This dish was very yummy! I added carrots, green pepper, mushrooms, and peas into the stew to add more texture. I cooked the stew in the crock pot, which saved lots of time. I added more Guinness and some curry powder to make the flavors come out. I also cheated and used frozen pastry dough. The only thing was that some of the beef was perfect and tender, but then other chunks were rather chewy. I suppose that had to do with it cooking in the pan beforehand.

Rating: 4
Like many, I cheated and subbed as necessary, but held true to the basics and found this delicious and very easy, thus the four forks. Based on suggestions, I added carrots and potatoes to make more of a stew, but I would advise against that. I think the beef/stout flavors would've held their own and been best served with potatoes and veg as true sides. I couldn't find brined peppercorns, so just added some crushed black pepper...may try the caper sub next time. There will definitely be a next time, it was fab!

I made this last night for our British-themed dinner for friends and I should've taken a picture because it came out exactly like the picture shown. It was very yummy. Next time, however, I think I'll add a little more to the braising liquid like the other reviewers did - maybe mushrooms or even carrots. Overall, very good. Will definitely make again - a good Sunday meal.

I give the recipe as-is a 3 but with my own alterations... of course it's a 4 fork recipe! My changes mirror the previous; No ketchup or tomato products, no peppercorns, vegetable broth rather than beef broth. I added potatoes and carrots to the stew and added 1 cup water and more importantly a FULL PINT of Guinness stout! The added beer gives a savory, startchy flavor that I really like and paired with the puffed pastry (store bought) it really is yum!

Purists will say that I killed this recipe, but I like the changes. Hold off on the tomato paste (per commentary) and also pulled both peppercorns and pepper (allergy in family). I substitute mexican chocolate and curry (or garam masala). Pretty good stuff.

great cold weather food. I was suprised it doesn't include vegetables so I add some peas and mushrooms that i quickly sauted before adding. Also per suggestions I nixed the tomato paste and replaced with half ketchup half dijon mustard.

The recipe was time consuming but not difficult. I took tips from some other reviewers in that I A) used ketchup instead of tomato paste and B) used a mashed potato topping. The ketchup substitution turned out fine but I would have preferred a pastry crust as the recipe was written. My potatoes were delicious and this "stew" was delicious but the potatoes kind of melted down into the sauce and I thought both were worse for the mixing. All in all, the flavor was very good. I loved the incredible flavor the green peppercorns and Guinness added. It was really rich and complex, better than an average beef stew.

AWESOME recipe!! I admit...I cooked this on a Sunday, where liquor stores are closed in the Southern US, and had forgotten to get any Guinness...so I pinched some of hubby's lighter beer. It still had an incredible taste, though, and I will definitely try it again using Guinness as called for! After reading some reviews that dissed the addition of tomato paste, I added the same amount of ketchup. Yah, sacrilege! But I thought maybe it'd give it a little depth of flavor that wasn't as overpowering as the paste seemed to be. There was no overwhelming tomato flavor, yet overall (I hate to keep saying it) AWESOME taste! Will absolutely make this again - family loved it, and it could be a one-dish meal if you added other veggies.

I also added potato, carrot and mushrooms and used half venison and half beef. The venison really reflected the complex flavors and brought out the richness of the Guinness. Using frozen puff pastry and a single casserole is wonderful.

For starters who picked this photo,it looks like someone got sick. Drop the tomato paste and go with a nice sundried tomato bloomed in Guinness then chopped. When browning the beef place beef in bowl add oil toss until coated then brown in small batches, add flour mixture then liquids. Where is the flour for the pastry.

This was fabulous! Since our children are grown and this was a "good" weekend our family celebrated St.Pat's a little early this year and I made this as a first course for our St.Patrick's Day family dinner. I omitted the brined peppercorns--could not find them at my local grocer. I added green peas to this, and in the future may substitute pearl onions and add mushrooms too. Although I keep an herb garden, my fresh thyme is a bit dull this time of year, so I used dried instead. The whole family loved this. I will make this again and perhaps try the recipe for the 'rough' puff pastry dough instead of the store bought version.

One day I will make puff pastry from scratch, but this weekend it was not to be - Pepperidge Farms worked beautifully. Other than that, I didn't change a single thing on this recipe, and it truly was exceptional. We do have individual bowls and found that to be a really nice touch in serving. We doubled the recipe for 4 adults, and served the additional stew kept warm - it's gone now! With a simple green salad using hearts of romaine and a walnut vinaigrette, it was a lovely menu over which to plan a trip to the Edinburgh Festival.

This was delicious. I made this for St. Patrick's Day, but I will make it again without waiting for March 17. I had a group of 8 to feed, and doubled the recipe. It doubled very well. As I did not have eight suitable bowls, I made it in two casserole dishes and simply covered each with the pastry. This worked well, and cooking time was not affected (though as I was pressed for time, I did not put them in the freezer, as the recipe instructs. Had I done so, I am not sure if the cooking time for the larger casserole dishes would have ended up being longer). Initially, when I saw that 2 pounds of beef were being allotted for four people, I hesitated, thinking it would be too much meat per person. In the end, however, I decided to double everything for my group of eight, and was glad that I had done so - not a bit left over. I served it with mashed potatoes and veg. Also, I had initially toyed with the idea of omitting the green peppercorns in brine, as I thought I would have difficulty finding them. They were at my local grocery store, however, and I am glad I used them, as I think they really added to the flavour. All in all a great hearty, flavourful meat pie.

This is rich and yummy! My Irish husband was in hog heaven! Used our favorite piecrust recipe which I baked in big sheets, then served the stew in bowls with piecrust pieces on top. I added celery and carrots and will probably include mushrooms next time. Would be good over roasted potatoes, noodles or rice too, instead of pastry. This one's a keeper!

This pie will definitely warm you on a cold Irish night but next time I will leave out the tomato paste - not necessary nor the dominent flavor I was after. I think the broth, beer, w. sauce, maybe a splash of marsala, would be a better flavor combo. The tomato paste made this a bit on the 'Irish Chilli' side. but still very good!

FAANTASTIC! Instead of ramikens I baked this in one large souffle dish, and also cheated and unrolled a crescent roll tube as the pastry top. Worked swell!! My only tweaks to the body were adding celery and turnips, which was yummy if you like turnips - - strong flavor. But this recipe is SO forgiving, and VERY versatile. Mushrooms, peas, shredded cabbage, sweet or white potatoes, even chopped butternut would be utterly incredible in this. Great, cozy dish for winter, and definitely a winner Irish dish for St. Patty's!

Double- triple the recipe. You'll wish you had leftovers. Use peppridge farm puff pastry- too easy. I would watch the pastry though, maybe my oven is running hot but I almost burnt the pastry. Mine should of been in the oven about 18 min. I add peas and carrots before baking. Would also make this as a stew. I served this with the St Pat's menu. The Guisness fondue was also great. Really fun. Everyone enjoyed very much.

Although it takes some time to complete, the steps are simple and well worth it. To get a truly deep beefy taste (a requirement in a pot pie dish), use a large tablespoon of "Better Than Bouillion" (beef paste). I added green peas for color and texture. Plenty left for stew and biscuits the day after.

Not only is this recipe super easy, you can make the stew a couple days in advance so it only gets better and better.

Making that stuff by hand is not worth the effort :)The presentation is so cute and fun and the family scarfed it down in minutes!

Great flavour, and easy to make. I have yet to add the pastry, since I'm making it in advance for another day's meal, but the stew filling is delicious. I keep going back to steal pieces of meat as it cools and find that they get more tender the longer they sit. I did chop one large carrot and a handful of mushrooms, adding them right before it went in the oven, but only because I thought all meat might be a bit boring. It's absolutely delicious, even just as a stew. I'll definitely make it again.

This was lovely! Great presentation and taste. I made in small dishes but if you were to make in one large - would a pastry "bird" help? I call it a pastry bird because I don't know the proper name, you put in the middle of the pie, it holds the dough of the filling and lets out the steam, mine is shaped like a bird. One teeny small pet peeve - it really isn't" St. Pattys Day" if you are going to abreviate it's St. Paddys Day - Paddy being the diminutive of Patrick, not Patty. It makes it sound like a female saints day. I don't mean to be petty but St. Pattys drives me up the wall :)

So delicious...used regular stew meat, a crock pot, and puff pastry -- all the shortcuts. You definitely need the peppercorns as called for. Added carrots and mushrooms and fresh parsley. I'm sure the homemade pastry is delicious but the puff pastry got the "wow" factor and didn't have to spend then time. Also, used any oven-safe bowl I had 5" or less on the top, even used small ramekins for smaller servings as it's a rich dish and it worked great. A new St. Pat's tradition for us.

Fantastic. I cheated with store-bought puff pastry (you can get a decent one made w/butter at Whole Foods). Made the stew a day ahead (highly recommend this), with 5 lbs. of beef, and tripled the gravy/sauce ingredients, except for the Guinness, of which I added even more (3 15-oz. cans, which seems to be the only way it comes nowadays). I added half a dozen Yukon gold potatoes, three or four carrots, and about half a pound of cremini mushrooms the second day, cooked them through in the morning, and had the stew cooled (this is essential) for assembly. These proportions fed 12 enthusiastic diners. This is a really delicious stew, I like what the beer does much better than the traditional red wine--it's mellower, and rich. I thought this might turn out to be a gimmicky St. Patrick's Day-only dish, but I'd make it any day. Everyone loved it.

Fantastic recipe! After reading the comments, I used a sirloin tip roast, purchased frozen puff pastry, and increased the Guinness Stout to at least one full bottle. I usually double the recipe and freeze the unused beef mixture in ramekins so that all I need to do is defrost and bring to room temperature, add a little Guinness, the puff pastry and I am set for another fabulous dinner. The champ, also featured on this site, is a perfect accompaniment along with perhaps honey-glazed carrots and plain green peas. This dish is as visually stunning as it delicious. Well worth the effort!

This is one of our favorite dishes. Absolutely delicious, and bursting with deep, rich flavor. We've made it with beef, but prefer using lamb. Oh, and we've never added the brined green peppercorns and still love this recipe. It's very easy to double; just make sure you have a big enough oven dish to fit it all in for the initial baking to tenderize the meat. My teenage son made this recipe the first time in our house, so it's not that complicated. Just give yourself several hours to complete it--there's lots of cool-down time and extra prep time needed to put the small individual pies together. The individual pies might seem like a hassle, but it's really worth the extra effort. The smaller portions keep the puff pastry off the stew so it rises beautifully in the oven. Wow, what a terrific meal!

Rating: 3
I've made it both with and without veggies and I honestly think it tastes better without...just eat them fresh, on the side! Found the peppercorns at Ralphs, next to the capers. Also, made it with the puff pastry first, second time just put a dollop of mashed potatoes in the bowl with the stew...both the spouse and I preferred the latter. This is very delish and makes very good leftovers.

I gave this only 3 forks because it was missing something, I felt. I will admit that dopey me didn't realise that capers are NOT, in fact, brined peppercorns so perhaps that is why the flavour wasn't as gutsy as I hoped. I will try this one again with the real ingredient. Otherwise, it was a wonderful heart-warming bit of comfort food and my family enjoyed it.

Because I didn't have time to put it in the oven for that long, I left it on the stove and allowed it to slowly simmer for about 45 minutes. Perfect. Then I used store-bought phyllo dough and constructed my own design. Worked well, but I bet sticking to the recipe on that part makes it better.

This was the perfect thing for a crowd on St. Patrick's day- everyone LOVED it! Here are my tips: 1: trim some of the fat/connective tissue off of the chuck. 2: make the stew the day before and let it sit in the fridge- the fat will rise to the top and solidify, and you can skim a good portion of it off. I tasted it when it first came out of the oven and it was really oily- I thought it was so much better after skimming it. 3: add some veggies- I used carrots and parsnips, and added them about 1 hour into the cooking time. 4: make SURE the puff pastry doesn't touch the stew, or it won't puff. I doubled the recipe and made it in two large dishes, and one of them was too wide- even after putting the dish in the freezer, when I placed it in the oven the middle of the pastry sagged into the stew didn't cook throuh. I just cut off the uncooked portion and used the pastry from the edges that had turned out beautifully. 5: This dish worked perfectly with the other menu options I chose . . . served it alongside steamed swiss chard & spinach dressed with just some salt, olive oil and lemon juice and the most fantastic mashed potatoes (and I know my potatoes) from Emeril- Potato, onion and pea champ. Find it here, at foodtv: http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,,FOOD_9936_21976,00.html. For dessert we had oatmeal apple crumble (also from Emeril) made with Irish whiskey and served with vanilla ice cream- YUM! Happy cooking!

We cut up and roasted some carrots and potatoes. We also added 2 sliced leeks to a small onion and the garlic. Increased the Guinness and broth to full cans and a little extra thyme and tomato paste. Couldn't find the green peppercorns, but soaked dried ones in some salted water--would like to find the others, as so many people seemed to think that added a lot. Used store pastry, which worked fine. If you are willing to surgically remove some of the connective tissue on the chuck, it tastes fine, otherwise you may want to try a more tender cut. This was fabulously flavorful!! Next time, I'd like to try the mashed potatoes broiled on top, as others have suggested, though my boyfriend thinks this was perfect just as we made it. I'm all about potatoes though! No need to wait for St. Patrick's Day for this!!! Oink!!!

Absolutely divine. The sauce was rich and silky, the puff pastry perfection. Next time I make it, I will follow the advice of the other raters and add some veggies. It needs just a little something,

Very tasty! I appreciated other reviewers' comments and ideas. Since I was cooking for five, I used three pounds of beef and adjusted other quantities accordingly. I used 2 cups of beef stock and an entire can of Guinness (in retrospect, would have let it thicken a bit more at this point before transferring to the oven). Also, after one hour in the oven, I added 2 cups each chopped carrots, potatoes, and mushrooms and 1 cup frozen peas and cooked another 15 minutes (should have done 30; the potatoes could have used it). Since I didn't have enough bowls, I consulted a friend about how to avoid soggy puff pastry (I used store-bought.) when placing it directly onto the stew in a large dish. Solution: chill everything as much as possible. Since my dish wouldn't fit in my freezer, I popped it in the fridge and the (rolled-out) puff pastry on a cookie sheet in the freezer. Cut slits in the pastry to let steam escape. Puff pastry can bake up fluffier than this did, but it was still crispy, attractive, and fully cooked. This will be a great make-ahead dish.

Rating: 3
I loved the flavor of the Guinness with the beef, and the puff pastry was easier make than I thought it would be. I'd recommend it highly- flaky and delicious. The only thing I will change when I make this again is to add more veggies. This was pretty heavy on the meat and needs something to balance it.

Hubby INSISTS I make this dish again. I used phylo dough since that is what I had. Similar to the NY chef, I thought to add potatoes and carrots though 1st time out, followed the recipe. Delicious

Really delicious, and I haven't even put it in the pie yet. I'm not even sure it will make it there! I doubled the sauce ingredients and added carrots and potatoes, cooked for 1.5 hours and then added sauteed mushrooms. I cooked it on the stovetop too, because I forgot to put it in the oven. Haven't noticed a difference. This would be good with any cut of beef - a real keeper.

I've made this dish several times for guests. Everyone I've made it for has loved it. I found the brined peppercorns in my local supermarket...I think I got them in Whole Foods. Instead of making my own pastry dough, I used store bought puff pastry which worked out very well. This tastes very similar to a stew I had in an Irish pub in Copenhagen that I had been trying to duplicate. Try it. It is easy to make and delicious!

This was wonderful. I added the whole 12 oz bottle of Guiness, and a whole can (14oz)of beef broth. Then, because I really did want it to be a one-dish meal, I added four potatoes and 4 carrots, all diced, and cooked it 30 minutes longer. There is no reason to bake this; you can "braise" it just fine in a stewpot on top of the stove. And, the best thing: you can make this the day before. Thirty minutes before serving you can dump it in a two quart baking dish, slap a square of thawed Pepperidge Farm puff paste on top, and have dinner ready in 30 minutes. I will make this again and again.

Rating: 3
This was yummy. Nothing super-special, but the Guinness does give a great rich flavor to the stew, and the puff pastry makes it look and taste fancier than it is. Like other reviewers, I added mushrooms to give it some more dimension. When I bought the meat for this, the butcher tried to convince me to use sirloin tips instead of chuck, and next time, I think I'll take his advice. Chuck has great flavor, but too much connective tissue for only an hour fifteen minute cook time. (In a slow cooker, I think chuck would definitely be the way to go.)

The stew was excellent. I did double up on the guinness as others had suggested. The pastry was a lot of work and not that great, so I will skip it next time and just make the stew.

This was SO GOOD! My husband loves a steak pie, and he was ever so impressed with this one. I made it almost exactly as written, just doubled up the Guiness as recommended, and did not make the pastry. I used crescent roll dough as one reviewer suggested, and it worked well. The green peppercorns added such nice flavor, seriously I would not change a thing. I deliberately did not add any veggies, as my husband has always loved a straight meat pie, but he did say next time I should toss some carrots in there, and there was certainly enough gravy for that after adding extra stout. I liked it just the way it was, with buttered carrots and peas on the side. :p Will make this often; just delicious!

I made this as just the Guinness and beef then served it with steamed baby potatoes. I did not include the tomato paste, but did substitute 4 thinly sliced, sweet grape tomatoes and also included 1 finely chopped, large brown mushroom. I ended up adding an additional 1 cup of beef broth and 1 cup of Guinness. The result was a thick, rich, tender entree that was welcomed with rave reviews. Perfect for St. Patrick's Day dinner!

Loved this receipe. I added 2 med potatos, 1 1/2 cups carrots & 1 1/2 Cans of Guinness (drank the rest). Best of all, I bought Puff Pastry Shells by accident, so I just baked them in the oven & spooned the stew over them. Delicious & EASY

I found this to be an excellent recipe and would definitely make it again. Next time I might even add the crust. This time I made and served it like beef stew... slow cooked it on top of the stove. I think the vegetables would be a nice addition but I liked it as is also.

Rating: 4
Great recipe, the Guinness makes it! I did use more as others recommended. But also bear in mind that if you are going to add potatoes, carrots and mushrooms you need to increase the fluids than recipe calls for or there isn't enough! Add more stout! Also more thickeners...more tomato paste and I also sauteed the mushrooms at the end with some flour. Recipe is designed for Le Creuset cookware, add the water with onion/garlic stage....that releases the browned bits. Although I sauteed the onion/garlic in a wee bit of oil first before adding the water. For the green peppercorns, if you can't get them in brine just use regular green peppercorns, you can soak them in water for 30 minutes before hand or you can even soak them in your own homemade brine...either works. Capers are a good alternative but I find the taste different and not appealing for a beef stew.

Rating: 4
This is one of the best beef braised dishes I've tasted. Every time I make it, I get requests for the recipe. I tried the carrot and the mushroom versions. Very tasty! I have also prepared both the rough puff pastry recipe and store bought crusts. The rough puff pastry is better than any mass produced product on the market. I'll be making this recipe throughout the year.

i followed the advice of previous posters and added cremini mushrooms, blanced diced carrots and frozen peas. would highly recommend adding veggies, i don't think i would have liked just a plain meat and gravy filling. i had to add double the broth, the gravy dried up quite a bit in the oven. flavor of the filling was quite good, although i'm thinking that red wine would have been a better addition than guinness... not sure. i did make the puff pastry. it was SO time consuming, but tasted amazing. it was hard to get it to not touch the filling, the parts that did touch did not rise, which was frustrating. overall a great recipe, though next time i will just use frozen puff pastry.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. I doubled the amount of Guiness as suggested by another reviewer. I also cooked some mushrooms down and added them during the last 15 minutes or so. The peppercorns added great flavor although it took some effort to find them. Don't bother making pastry. I used store-bought puff pastry and it worked great. I served the leftovers over cooked egg noodles and that was great too.

What a flavor! I didn't bother with my own crust, and used packaged Puff Pastry instead. I also made it in one large casserole; for a dinner party, the individual pies would be more festive. I would like a bit more gravy, and might up the gravy ingredients a bit; otherwise, this was a fine dish, and quick to put together.

SBC1023: I have made this recipe a couple times. The last time I followed the recipe up to the point of re-introducing the meat and juices to the pot for final cooking. At this point I put it all in the crock pot with additional veggies; ie; carrots,potatoes etc. and served it like a stew. It was excellent and the meat was very tender. I also froze some to turn into pies later. Really flexible recipe.

This was incredible! I added mushrooms and used more Guiness than recipe because I like my pie with lots of broth and I find they get a bit dry after baking the pastry. I was a little intimidated by the pastry so I made it the day before; it turned out terrific! I wouldn't however drape it over the sides of the dish because I found the draped portion burned before the top was cooked. I made it again and used the ramkin to cut the pastry to fit perfectly - no burning - excellent!

This is the first recipe I've made of Epicurious, and it was a doosy. As I had to feed 10 hungry people, I used 2.5 times all the ingredients and made a stew instead. It's dead simple and I ended up with 10 people who couldn't eat dessert! The only real modifications I made to the recipe was that I used double the proportion of Guinness. After about 1 hour of braising, I added the carrots and potatoes and let it cook for another 15 minutes, then sit for 6 hours or so. I added mushrooms upon reheating (about 15-30minutes). Everything was done to perfection - no mushy potatoes or carrots!

The stew portion of this is rich, hearty and delicious. However, the dough was not worth the work. I will make this recipe again but will try serving on top of whipped potatoes or with vegetables instead. The crust doesn't add anything to this.

Mmmmmmm! Intoxicating! This dish is a total knockout. I made it in one dish instead of four ramekins. My only advice to anyone considering making this is to allow plenty of time to make it. I thought I had, but I ran out of time near the end and did not have enough time to let the stew cool completely; therefore, the pastry sagged and melted a liitle in the center. Otherwise, it was SUBLIME.

Great recipe. The only change I made was to add mushrooms. Triple the recipe because you will be disappointed that there arn't leftovers. Make sure that they are taken out of the oven at least 10 minutes before serving because out of the oven they are too hot to eat.

This was fantastic. I made the dish exactly as stated, except I couldn't find the peppercorns so I substituted capers as well. Personally, I wouldn't add a thing. This is a BEEF pie after all - why mess around with it and add silly veggies! This is perfect for those people who think the highlight of any pot-pie is the meat anyway and find the veggies just a nuisance. Two people managed to eat the entire pie by the way, so I would definitely double if you want this to be a main course for several hearty eaters. Making the puff pastry was not difficult, but I did manage to shave off a bit of finger during the grating of the frozen butter. Damn those microplane graters - they're almost too sharp! If you have the time I would make the puff pastry - it's time consuming waiting for it to chill, but it's not hard and it's very impressive. I was quite proud of myself. I will definitely make this again - it was a huge hit at our house!

This is delicious! I added crimini mushrooms, but did everything else as called for in the recipe. I think it is worth the time to make the pastry dough, I was able to do my prep chopping for the stew during the chillings. The pastry turned out wonderfully, buttery goodness.

Didn't seem that much different than the stew I make w/red wine instead of Guiness. Added some baby bellas and carrots. Puff pastry wasn't that difficult, but I had one that puffed and the other three did not-must have touched the meat/gravy per other review. Used capers--didn't seem to add much. Took a lot of time and work. The one that puffed made a nice presentation, but I didn't think that the taste was all that special.

Rating: 3
A nice recipe, but not a brilliant one. I thought the tomato paste was overpowering, so I had to double the guiness (not all together a bad thing) and the stew would ave been nicer with some more 'stodge' to soak up th delightful beef and guiness flavors. Overall, it was tasty, but i think youre better off adding guinness to a good stew recipe rather than trying to rely on this one.

To the cook from Berkeley...to use packaged puff pastry, just thaw a sheet of it at room temp for 30-40 minutes. For two pies, I cut the sheet in half diagonally, draped each piece of pastry over the stew-filled ramekin, and trimmed it so there was just a little overhang on the edges. Seal to the dish with a little egg wash. Also, be sure that the pastry is not touching the stew or it will be a little soggy and not puff as well, and make sure the stew is completely cool before you put the pastry on.

I made the filling one night ahead of time (it smelled so good while it was cooking that I almost couldn't hold out that long). Then I just brought it up to room temp, topped it with some purchased puff pastry, and baked away. Scrumptious! I added a full can of Guinness plus about 8 oz. sliced button mushrooms, a cup of diced carrots and a cup of diced potatoes. Also couldn't find brined peppercorns, so I subbed capers, which were great. I'll make this over and over in the wintertime, with and without the pastry.

Reminiscent of the pub food I love, but better! The green peppercorns provide a wonderful kick. I used gourmet, prepared puff pastry and just made it as one pie in a large gratin dish. I served it with smashed potatoes and buttered carrots, and there were no leftovers (much to my dismay!!)

This was a fun recipe to make. I knew I was not going to have the time to cook last week, so I made this on a Sunday and kept it in the fridge. I wanted to keep the English tradition and decided to skip all the fuss and just do a classic Yorkshire Pudding (see http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/102308). I cooked it low heat for 2 hours on Sunday, and reheated it on low heat (thanks to teenage child who was home and is actually learning to cook) for another hour on Monday evening. I arrived home, whipped up the pudding and served it. It was very good. I did increase the broth and the beer as I figured that prolonged cooking and overnight sitting would need extra. Otherwise followed it pretty much as is. As other reviewers have suggested, adapt it to taste: I would add more thyme, and perhaps some brown sugar and a dash of allspice to mellow out the dark hefty ale. The brined peppercorns were perfect in this.

That only 57% would make this again is very misleading!!! This was really good and I, of course, customized. I will make it again with the pastry, but this time I served it over egg noodles to lighten it up a little. Mashers would be good too. I used a little less meat and increased the guinness and broth for more sauce. Love the flavor of thyme and felt this recipe did not call for nearly enough. I will also adapt this for the slow cooker. Don't pass this up because someone couldn't find the link to the pastry recipe.
