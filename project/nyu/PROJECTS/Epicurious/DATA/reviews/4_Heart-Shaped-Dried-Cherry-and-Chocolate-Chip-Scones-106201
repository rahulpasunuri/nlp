These were delicious. I made these for a ladies tea and took other reviewers' suggestions by using dried cranberries and white chocolate. I kept my dough in the fridge overnight and baked these for 15 minutes on 385. Perfect! Also I just cut out circles using the top of a juice glass and I got 20 scones.

This is my secret weapon recipe when I want to impress someone... I invite them over for "tea", then whip out these bad boys. Jaws drop. I think I've perfected them- here are my tips: - put butter in freezer for a few minutes so it gets nice and cold before dicing - I use sea salt instead of table salt - leave out orange peel - leave out almond extract (just use 1/4 tsp more vanilla) -I use dried cranberries snipped into bits instead of cherries (it makes for a more dynamic scone) -heavy cream is fine to use instead of buttermilk - handle the dough as little as possible (it's okay if it's barely mixed and super crumbly, they turn out great) - I form dough into a ball then cut into pie wedges... that way you don't have to handle the dough too much - I don't bother with the milk glaze or sugar sprinkles bonus points: - I get these all ready on their cookie sheet the morning I'm having guests over, stick them in the fridge, then pop them in the oven 10 minutes before everyone arrives. So that the whole house smells like heaven and the scones are coming out just as everyone's sitting down. - When the scones are baking, I whip a cup of heavy cream with a pinch of sea salt together with my electric mixer... voila! homemade butter to serve with the scones!

Hmmmm. Too much going on in these for me. I only put in a scant 1/2 C. chocolate chips, and I'd cut that further, or even leave them out. Did not care for the almond extract flavor, and would consider cutting or even eliminating the orange zest. These were good, and the scones that I actually made bigger/thicker had a much nicer texture than the 3/4" thick small heart shaped scones. Needs work, and I will definitely try again! love most cherry scones.

I bake quite a bit, and this has become one of my favorite scone recipes. I've used cranberries, chopped dried apricots, and even dried blueberries in place of the cherries at times. These scones always get raves and are always requested by friends, family, and coworkers.

This recipe has become an all time classic here at my house and among my friends. It's caused me to buy more scone pans (both large scones and mini scones) than I care to mention. I use dried cranberries and white chocolate chips, which seems a nice combination. Everyone loves how soft they are, and even if they are a few days old (or longer) they still taste great. tom K.

Best scone recipe! I've substituted fresh cranberries and white chocolate chips... wicked good and makes the dough a nice pink color which is great for the holidays!

We all loved this one. Really. And it was very easy to make too...Baked it on a Sunday morning(double recipe) and it was gone by evening.

These scones are truly an expression of love, even if you don't make them heart-shaped.

These were surprisingly easy to make, but they turned out so light, fluffy, and overall more muffin-like than I expected for a scone... good, but not amazing.

Rating: 2
I did not like these scones that much. Too much going on, and in particular, I thought the 3/4 cup of mini chips were overwhelming. Hands- down, the best scone recipe on this website is still the Cranberry Orange Scones. This base recipe can be used for endless variations, depending on what you like.

I was trying to find a recipe to use up some buttermilk and I'm so glad I found this one. I did not have cherries, so I used small toffee/skor bits and they turned out GREAT!

These are awesome. Super easy to make. I'll definately make them again!!

These are delicious...and I generally don't even like scones! Something about this recipe, though, made me want to try it (maybe the chocolate-cherry combination?). Made a few tiny modifications: added cranberries and cherries, white and dark chocolate chips, and didn't use milk to glaze the scones; only sprinkled coarse sanding sugar on top and they were still GREAT! I ate these warm out of the oven...Yum!

These were fantastic and so easy to make. Instead of making heart-shaped or circular cut-outs, I cut the formed circle into eight wedges. They came out great!

I made these for a tea party for my daughter. They were very easy to make and everyone raved. I too substituted cream for the buttermilk (that's what I had on hand). I wouldn't change a thing and will definitely make them again and again

Better cooled than warm. I thought a little moist for a scone but delicious.

I made these exactly as is and they came out wonderful. Moist, flakey, and just a little dense. I LOVED them. Then, I made them a second time, not changing anything, and they were more cake-like, spongey, almost like a muffin. They still have good flavor, but I am not sure what caused the change in texture. Any ideas?

I made these for a 50th birthday tea-- they were a hit! Since I had leftover buttermilk, I decided to make two more batches and took in Valentine treat bags to my work friends-- they all really enjoyed them. Scones were yummy-the only change I made- didn't have almond extract so I used Amaretto. It worked out well. Dough was easy to handle,flavors were great!

This is a nice light scone recipe. Most of the others I have tried seem very dense and tasteless.

By far the best scone recipe I have found. I substituted cranberries with orange essence for the cherries and put slightly less orange rind in it. Next time I will use raw sugar on the top for extra crunch. I highly recommend this recipe!

This is a superb recipe for scones- they come out light, buttery, and with bottoms that are crisp and just pastry-like... a great starting point for adding in anything you want. My husband does NOT have a sweet tooth, but I made these more for myself. He went positively bananas for them- even declaring them the best scones he's ever had in his life. Given that he's from Ireland and has eaten *many* scones, I consider that a compliment in the highest order. One of my rare 4 fork ratings.

This was my first attempt at scones that worked. Others were "crackly". Instead of chocolate chips I used a mixture of dried tart cherries, dried bing cherries, and dried wild blueberries (all from Trader Joe's) and a 2 inch round cutter. The scones were superb. I would use a larger cutter next time as they were very small, but had 21 scones.

I like my scones a bit more rustic so I use half regular flour and half whole wheat flour. I used cranberries instead of cherries the second time, added chopped pecans and everyone raved. A very decadent breakfast!

I made these for an Easter brunch and was very pleased with the scones. I made them the night before and followed the directions for baking the next day. These were by far the best scone I've ever tasted. I used cherry flavored cranberries and only used vanilla extract. These were better than the ones you get at fancy teahouses.

Really good scones. I made a few minor changes--I didn't have almond extract, so I just used all vanilla. I used regular-sized chocolate chips. And, I cut the scones out into circles because it is October, not February. : )

To the cook in Monte Sereno: What is this about milk being healthier than buttermilk? I think there's some confusion here.

This recipe is wonderful! Everyone at the office loved them. I had never made scones before, but I will definitely make them again! For one batch, I substituted dried cranberries and white chocolate chips, and left out the orange peel. Delicious!

I've used a 2 in. biscuit cutter and gotten 18-19 scones from the recipe. They aren't much to look at but they are tasty. However, I agree with a previous reviewer - they are busy in terms of competing flavors. The almond flavor is overwhelming when fresh out of the oven - they're better once cooled to room temp. and briefly rewarmed in a microwave. I used a lower temp. (375)and placed buttered/floured parchment paper on top of the buttered cookie sheets to prevent the scones from sticking and darkening on the bottom - but my oven thermostat is off.

Use your 'biscuit' making techiniques when preparing these and they turn out great. I cut in the butter and folded them a few times on the counter before cutting. I thought they were fantastic. Served them as part of a Valentine's breakfast.

I'm not sure why so many people found these cakey or the dough hard to work with. I refrigerated the dough overnight, and they were VERY easy to make in the morning-- and incredible while they're warm :)

I'm surprised by the high marks for this recipe--I found these to be too "cakey", not at all like traditional scones. The dried cherry buttermilk scones on this site are much better, in my opinion.

These were soooo good ! I made the dough the night before and cooked them in the morning. I made half with the sugar sprinkled on top and the other half with just the glaze. I preferred the ones without the sugar but both were good. I also used a round cookie cutter since my heart shaped ones were either too big or too small. I will definitely add these scones to my breakfast repetoire. They are outstanding !

This is a lovely scone recipe . . . they come out very moist and tender and delicious! Perfect as a snack or breakfast with tea. I used naturally cherry-flavored dried cranberries because my supermarket doesn't carry dried cherries (and they tasted like cherries), and I omitted the orange zest because I forgot to buy an orange. They were nonetheless delicious, next time I'll try with the orange zest.

3.5 Forks :-) I made these for a family tea and they were a hit! Definitely a little sticky, but adding a smidge more flour helped enough to form them. I personally found them slighty too busy, flavorwise, but I loved the hint of almond--I might try them again but leave out the orange peel. Or take out the cherries and add slivered almonds. Yum!

I made these scones for my mom on Mother's Day 2002, and she loved them! The only trouble i encountered was with the sticky nature of the dough (nothing that a little flour won't cure). They were a definite hit!

Rating: 4
FABULOUS! I made them the first time as directed and pressed out the round to cut out the hearts. The other cooks are right, it's too sticky. I ended up adding about 1/4 cup more flour to get them to shape easier. The second time I made them - two days later - I left the dough sticky and dropped them into large spoonful mounds on the baking sheet - much better! Rave reviews from all my guests - these will be a regular staple at our house.

I found the dough a little sticky for forming, so I used an open top cookie cutter and filled it with dough. Worked like a charm. I didn't have time to pop over to the co-op for dried cherries, so I used cranberries. A little different, but very tasty. The next time I made them I used some lemon rind and kept with the cranberries. Right after they came out of the over I spooned some hot sugar lemon syrup over them. EVEN BETTER. Get creative! This is a great base recipe.

I made these for a Valentine's Day breakfast ... my first try at scones. I was nervous, but the recipe was a snap. And they were fantastic (way better than any scone I've ever had at a coffee shop). They were a bit more moist than I was expecting -- maybe too moist for a traditional scone? But very flavorful, tender, and just plain good. Even better the second day. I plan to make them for the office next week (though I'll probably skip the heart shape). This is definitely a "keeper."
