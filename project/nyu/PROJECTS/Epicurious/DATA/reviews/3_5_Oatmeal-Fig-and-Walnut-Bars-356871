Sorry I forgot I also used pecans instead of walnuts

Absolutely awesome with fresh figs - I just left out the water, used real butter, and followed the rest exactly. I had a huge crop on my tree this year, made two batches, and will make another 2 to freeze for desert with ice cream in the winter!

Decidedly underwhelming bars. I substituted dehydrated sugar cane to make these truly vegan. I decreased sweetener by 4 T. and they are still overwhelmingly sweet. Might consider eliminating sweetner in filling. I use Earth Balance all the time, but in this recipe it leaves an off flavor. Might consider using coconut oil instead to stay vegan. The crust texture is unpleasant Might consider grinding some of the oats to refine the texture. Will not make this again, personally.

Absolutely delicious! My coworkers and friends loved these. I made this using some reviewers' recommendations: I cut down on the butter and the sugar. Also, I used fresh figs, because it's fig season 'round these parts. Yum.

We loved this recipe; and I didn't change a thing. I brought them to work and everyone really enjoyed this good, healthy snack. I've been searching my recipe box trying to find it so I can make it again for the holiday weekend coming! Was so glad I did it will be a permanent recipe in our house.

DEFINITELY reduce the sugar - I would only use 2tbs for the fig filling as figs are already sweet, and reduce the brown sugar to 1cup. These are much better after firming up in the fridge, but are still on the sweet side.

These were delicious - big hit, nice change from date bar. Agree very sweet. Made recipe as is and used black mission figs; well actually I should say I used real butter as that's what I had on hand! Very good crust recipe - just remember you need vanilla ice-cream! Ice-cream or frozen yogurt on these bars would have been awesome!

We all really like this recipe. We've made it twice and substituted dates for figs both times.

I wanted the flavor of the figs without the cloying sweetness, so I used only 2 T sugar in the filling, as the previous reviewer suggested and I halved the sugar in the crust. I subbed 1 cup orange juice for the water, which gave the filling a nice tang. Next time, I'd add some grated lemon zest. Omitted the powdered sugar completely. A keeper, with some modifications to accommodate a far less sweet tooth.

I used dried tart cherries and dried plums for these, and left out all but 2 tablespoons of sugar in the filling. They were perfect....not too sweet. Next time I'm going to try some of my own dried apricots.

Loved these - but I like a gooey date bar and would bump up the filling next time. Also used most of the crust in the bottom in favour of a lighter and crispier top. For something a bit different - substituting 1/3 peanut butter and 2/3 butter worked well for the crust also.

I made this exactly as described and froze them. They held up beautifully with a crisp crust and chewy fig filling.

Very tasty and nutritious! I did not use the powdered sugar and I also subbed 3/4 c of the flour with whole wheat flour, mixed half figs & dates and also used reg. butter. Easy to tweak, 2x easier to eat, yum!

I know that many folks don't like to hear about substitutions, but I liked this recipe & customized it to what I hand in the house. I used a mix of dried fruits (apricots, plums, craisins & cherries) which was a little too loose so needed just a pinch of cornstarch. Also used a mix of toasted nuts (almonds, pecans, pistachios & walnuts). I also used regular butter. They turned out quite delicious. Next time I would make just a bit more filling & bake additional 5 minutes. Really tasty little sweet bite for dessert after a hearty dinner or a tiny little breakfast treat. A great base recipe that I will vary & use again & again.

I, too, did not have enough figs on hand so used half figs half dates. I also thought there was not enough filling but it spread well. I used 4 cups for the bottom crust and the rest for the topping. I baked it for 40 minutes, was afraid it would burn but was not quite firm, so left it in turned off oven for another 5 minutes. Cooled and cut into 1x2 bars. They were crumbly but delicious. I put them in the freezer to bring to my Vegan daughter later in the week. I did not dust with powdered sugar as they are sweet enough. The other change I made was to use gluten free flour as we are wheat intolerant. Next time I will bake them longer and try the hint another reviewer gave of baking the crust first.

This is so good! The only change I made was to use butter, will definitely make this again and again.

Made with half prunes and half dates for the filling since I didn't have any dried figs, and that was delicious. I made the crust in my food processor, and had no faith that is was going to turn out (didn't look like it had enough butter -- and yes, used butter), but poured ~2/3 crumbs in bottom, patted, and dumped the rest on top. Miraculously held together and very tasty. I also put the toasted nuts on top of the filling rather than mixing in. Didn't have any lemon as one reviewer suggested, but sounds like a good idea. People loved these and relatively healhty; will make again.

i also used half dates/half figs, absolutely delicious, just the right amount of sweetness with a little confectioner sugar dusting

This recipe was simple, quick, and absolutely delicious! I made it with real butter, and the oatmeal base was deliciously rich and crumbly. Since there are so few ingredients, using good quality cinnamon, vanilla, and brown sugar makes all the difference. I made a batch for home, but I will definitely make another batch to share with my co-workers.

Too keep the bars from being too crumbly (and to add a little sweetness), I drizzled on a glaze of confectioners sugar, almond milk and water. I took these bars to a party and they got rave reviews.

I actually made this recipe twice in one week (once just for friends and once for a dinner party served with lightly sweetened whipped cream). Everyone was moaning about how much they loved them! Both times I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts (my preference) and because I'm not vegan - actually used real butter (I know, naughty!) One of my favourite epicurious recipes!

To A Cook from Atlanta: yes, many white sugars are processed using a bleaching method that involves animal bone char. However, this recipe can easily be made vegan by substituting your basic 99 cents/5 pound bag sugar for organic cane sugars such as Florida Crystals, Sugar In The Raw, or even the house brand from Whole Foods or Trader Joes.

I used half figs, half dates because that is what I had on hand. It does look like you wont have enough filling, but it seems to melt and even out really well. I had no problem eating the whole tray by myself over the course of a week, and was even persuaded to share a few with friends. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was easy and tasty but my vegan friend tells me the white sugar rules it out for many vegans, because white sugar can be processed using meat products.

Just like a date bar only with figs. Use 4 cups of crumbs on bottom and the remaining on top. Top crusts was heavier than bottom by using 3 cups. Sweet enough even without the added powdered sugar.

I used half dates half figs, because I didnt realize i wouldnt have enough of the figs. The combination is quite delicious. When I was spreading the filling over the crust I initially regretted not making double the filling. But when it came out it was very well balanced. I too put more on the bottom than on the top. I also re baked the bottom ten minutes and added lemon juice to the filling and reduced the sugar in the crust to 1 cup. Pretty damn delicious for a vegan recipe.

Just like a date bar only with figs. Use 4 cups of crumbs on bottom (not 3 as listed)...too little on bottom and too much on top--otherwise, very good.
