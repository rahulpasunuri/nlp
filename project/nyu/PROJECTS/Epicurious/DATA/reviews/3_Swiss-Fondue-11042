Awful recipe. The cheese will NOT combine with the wine using this method. I saved it by making a roux, adding wine, and then slowly incorporating the separated cheese & wine mixture.

I have given this recipe a rating of zero. It's unfortunate that this recipe is on this site. The amount of wine is far too much (as stated by another reviewer) and the amount of kirsh is obscene. I am disappointed not only that I wasted my money and cheese on this recipe but that I also wasted my time. Save yourself the trouble and do not try this recipe.

Good traditional Swiss recipe. I like to use all Gruyere rather than Emmenthaler and Gruyere mix, but both are good. I would vote against "Swiss" cheese from America. Get real imported cheese - you'll taste the difference.

epicurious - please proofread these recipes before they get posted. what a mess.

I can't believe nobody else thought this was twice as much wine as necessary! I luckily had double the amount of cheese as was necessary, so I was able to make it less liquid. This recipe seems like a bad translation to me. What about melting the cheese before it is added? All very disorienting as my dinner guests watched me try to figure it all out. Turned out fine using twice as much cheese as was necessary.

I use 1/2 Gruyere, 1/2 Emmantaler, whatever the total amount to be made. Rub the bowl very well while pressing the garlic, and add the grated cheeses gradually to the heated wine, stirring pretty much constantly. In a restaurant in Quebec I discovered the key ingredient for a smooth, lovely fondue -- use amoretto or almond liqeur rather than kirsch. Add nutmeg to taste and maybe a pinch of white pepper, thicken as needed with cornstarch.

As a Swiss, I can confirm this is very close to the recipe I use. A couple of suggestions: add some "Vacherin Fribourgeois" - it helps make the fondue creamy. If you don't like kirsch, you can also use some lemon juice. I always mix the cheese, wine, lots of roughly chopped garlic, and lots of herbs (chopped chives, parsley) several hours in advance. Some reviewers reported problems with getting everything to melt. You need some patience, and if things aren't working, turn up the heat a bit. I have made fondue for up to 24 people and always have good results.

Sorry I meant, only a few ingredients.

After living in France/Switzerland for over a decade I offer a few tips. Always use very good quality STALE bread. It is best if the bread is cubed and dried out a little for a couple of days. If the flavour of the kirsch is overpowering, dont use it. This was a traditional dish made out of necessity in the cold winter months when there was lots of wine and cheese in the cellar, and a need to use every scap of food (ie stale bread). This dish IS boozy in flavor obviously, and that is part of its charm. Corn starch is not necessary if you have the patience to stir the cheese into the wine slowly. Like a good risotto, fabulous fondue can be made from only a few recipes and lots of love.

This recipe can be very good. You can use a combination of Swiss and Gruyere cheeses. If you have a problem getting the cheeses to melt, mix the cheeses with the cornstarch so it won't stick together and make certain that the wine is very hot. If the wine taste is too strong for you, you may mix the wine with some chicken stock to enhance the flavor a little. It won't be a true Swiss Fondue but it will have a great flavor. Leftovers warmed up the next day, if there are any, are great too. It can also be used as a cheese sauce over different types of meat or pastas! Sometimes I make this and just use (clean out) all the cheeses I have left in the drawer (except blue cheese - too strong).

Yum! We had this for the new year and none was left after the new year! We'll make it again!

My friend and I thought it would be fun to celebrate the new year with fondue. This was the worse recipe ever. I too the advice from the Atlanta chef...and wow this was very bad. After tasting it we had to get rid of it. This was a total disappointment.

Gruyère and Swiss cheese are fine but you should also try to find some Beaufort, which is found in just about every fondue made in France. Other good cheeses to experiment with include Appenzel and Tomme. Also, I use a Chablis (which is strictly NOT a French way) but it always gets rave reviews. Lastly, another French tradition: crack a couple of fresh eggs into the pot when you get to the last of the cheese, scramble them and pass out spoons - it's delicious!

Others had mentioned that the alcohol was overwhelming in this dish so I used less alcohol, 1 cup white wine and 1/8th cup kirsch, and it was fabulous!

PLEASE use 2/3 ld. Emmenthaler to 1/3 lb. Gruyere and shred or cube. BEFORE adding to wine (Fendant is good but a nice California riesling is fine, toss the cheeses in a little potato flour--it will make a nice smooth fondue. ALWAYS rub the fresh clove of garlic in the wall of the fondue pot or casserole and toss the clove away--it does NOT go in the fondue! Stir in a figure 8, adding the kirschwasser (cherry brandy) after the cheeses are melted. If the fondue becomes too thick, one must add a little of the wine-NOT the kirschwasser. Be sure and try the fondue with small boiled potatoes in their jackets and cornichon (tiny pickles). The French bread should be a day old to make good cubes. The cheese that crusts in the bottom of the pot is a delicacy and should be shared. The person who loses their breadcube to the pot must beg a kiss from their guest.

The cheese melts much easier when you add a handful at a time I found. The smell was very strong from this type of cheese. Very tasty!

Alcohol a bit overpowering on the cheese but we added a little nutmeg and the flavor was balanced... The wine cheese mixing thing has to do with the acidity of the wine. Cheese needs a higher acid wine (aka- DRY) to bond well. When lack of bonding is observed try adding a little lemon juice for substitute acid.

Cube the bread several hours or even the day before. Use half Ementaller and half greuyer cheese.

It seemed the flavor of the cheese was overpowered by the alcohol. If I made this again, I would try to balance the amount of wine and kirsch with the cheese.

We thought this fondue was amazing! We had the same issue with the cheese not combining very well with the wine, but we used a wire whisk and it seemed to turn out better. DEFINITELY a keeper!

I must be doing something wrong. I've made it twice with only marginal results. The first time I added the cheese too quickly. It never really combined with the wine and kirsch. The second time it was better (add a handful, stir until it melts and then add the next handful), but still not as good as what I've gotten in Switzerland. I'll try another recipe next time to compare.

This was a huge crowd pleaser, but the directions were a little messed up. Obviously, you can only add the cheese once. After the wine is warm, add the cheese in bunches. Also, stir in a zig-zag motion to avoid making a big ball of cheese. Hope this helps to ensure your fodue doesn't become a fon-DON't!

We made this recipe in preparation for our fondue extravaganza in Switzerland. It is a simple and delicious treat! We have made several times and it can't be beat on a cold day.

Standard (and very tasty) fondue recipe!
