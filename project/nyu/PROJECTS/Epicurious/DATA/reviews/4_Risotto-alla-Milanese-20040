This came out great. Served with osso buco. I used about 6c of broth. This recipe is a classic, but the broth amount is incorrect, and also it does not tell you to heat up the broth.

A great recipe for a classic consistently amazing risotto. I've made this many times with frequent changes. One of my favorite adds is to add thinly sliced scallions at the end (once removed from the stove) for a great color, texture, and flavor add!

Yum! Increased stock to about 7 cups and added fresh chives at end! Increased parm to about 1 cup and used lots of saffron.

A really GREAT and easy risotto with no doubt about the extra stock needed. A sure crowd pleaser!

Wonderful recipe. Agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer below about the amount of stock needed. 3 cups just won't get the job done. I've usually used a minimum of 6, and sometimes more. It's always better to have a little leftover stock and perfect risotto!

I laugh every time I see a risotto recipe calling for 3 (or more, what does that mean?) cups of stock. I have made a few risotto's in my time. This recipe is solid except for the amount of stock. First timers take note - always have AT LEAST 8 cups of stock on hand when making risotto. You may not use all 8 cups, but you will use more than 3 if you are making it right. There are too many variables (quality of rice, level of heat, dryness of your kitchen) to determine exactly how much stock you will need, but having enough is a lot better than not having. Towards the end of the cooking time, test it, looking for an al denete texture.

Love love love this recipe. I made it with the marrow, and a generous amount of saffron, but without the truffles. I used 2c of the water I poached the marrow in, 2c of chicken stock, and then I boiled the marrow bone and had to use that stock also ... 3c my ***. I was well over 6c of stock. But it was so nice and rich and creamy that I have no complaints.

Risotto should be on everyone's list for ease of preparation and *wow* factor. I agree that adding 1/2 cup of liquid at a time is best.

This is my tried and true risotto recipe and I love it! My boyfriend has stated that it is one of his favorite things that I make. So many people think that risotto is hard and you have to stand by the stove the whole time, but this recipe is so simple - yes, you have to be near the kitchen to stir every few minutes, but keep it on a low simmer with a lid on and it will make the rice softer and creamier. I normally have to increase the liquid to closer to 4 cups and have used all varieties of stocks and tomato juice for the liquid, all varieties of cheese (from the traditional parmesan to sharp cheddar to even brie when I happened to have it) have used vermouth instead of white wine when I didn't have that . . . the list goes on. This recipe never fails me and as long as I have the main ingredients (can use pearl rice when arborio is hard to find) this is a stunner. Serve with shrimp, grilled pork loin, chicken, steak . . . anything. Yum!

I've heard risotto milanese compared to "a grownup's version of mac and cheese," and it's definitely true. Very rich, very subtle taste. I would recommend serving it with a simple green salad. I have made risotto many times, and I usually add only about 1/2 cup stock at a time. However, I followed the recipe exactly and added 1 cup at a time, which I wouldn't recommend, as the rice was slightly underdone.

this is the 2nd time i've made this recipe, and each time, it's been out of this world!... if you're a risotto lover (as my wife diane and i are) this is an excellent, simple, yet extremely flavorful dish.... the last time i made this was with osso buco.... and just this last weekend, i made this as a complement to lobster thermidor.... what a combo, and what an awesome result!...

This was simple, and superb. I followed the original recipe, and stood in front of the stove for a good 35-40 minutes. Served it as a side dish to baked chicken and tomatoes.

I omitted the Saffron and added garlic and we loved it! I have made this with fresh mozzerella, tomatoes and basil for a twist on the "caprese" salad. Some nights we just have Risotto as our main dish others, its a side.
