Wow. This is really, really good. Just go easy on the mayonnaise, I find there's a bit too much for the quantity of shrimp. Otherwise, it's just perfect!

This was such a hit, I barely set them about and they were gone. Marinade would be great with any number of things. I made it as is, but a little sesame oil might be a nice addition. Easy keeper for sure!

This is a keeper! Super easy to make and my guests were 'over- the- top' impressed. I made this exactly as is - didn't change a thing. I will be making this again and again.

Made this tonight and it was really good. I made some substitutions based on what I had in my house. I used seasoned rice vinegar versus unseasoned. I also used some chardonnay I had open versus sake. Worked perfectly and was delicious. Served over jasmine rice and steamed spinach. Poured some extra marinade on the rice. Will definitely make again!

A nice recipe to serve plated, giving it a little extra glamour. I followed the suggestion of surrounding the rice mound with arugala, then shrimp on the arugala and aioli over everything. No problem with too salty, although I did use low sodium soy sauce. I did have trouble with the mayo and ginger in the food processor. Just not enough volume and not liquidy. Everything just splurted onto the sides. Next time, I'll mince the ginger and mix it into the mayo - no more work, better results, less cleanup.

This is one of those rare recipes that is a breeze to make but gives the impression it took hours. I like to serve on bed of arugula with some steamed rice. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!

Made this for dinner last night YUM!!! I served it over jasmine rice with sautéed snow peas on the side. I'm grilling chicken tonight and will serve the leftover aïoli over it.

I have been making this since the first month it was first published in Bon Appetit. I have never had anyone say it is too salty. Shrimp should never be marinated more than 30 minutes because they will start to breakdown. This may be part of the problem with the reviewers who thought it too salty. I make exactly as written except 1/2 sauce is plentiful. Mound Basmati rice in the center of the plate, surround with shrimp and alternate with steamed broccoli that I drizzle with lemon juice and grated lemon over the broccoli. I drizzle a little of the marinade over the rice. I cannot tell you the number of guests that have requested the recipe! It is so easy. And my presentation is a wow!

Made this for a Labor Day pontoon outing snack. EVERYONE loved it. Used low sodium soy sauce and sesame oil and marinated for about 4 hours. I just used a really hot skillet with no extra oil to cook. These were really yummy!

Recommend LOW SODIUM soy sauce. It was very salty but otherwise the taste was great! Next time I will use a microplaner on the ginger to get more flavor.

I served this as an hors d'oevre at room temperture. I used dark rum instead of the sake. Some may find this VERY salty. I grated the ginger and stirred it into the mayonnaise for a dip. Adding the concentrated marinade would have been too salty.

wonderful- quick and easy mouthwatering tastes, great meal

This was really excellent. My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed it. Served with brown rice. I will definitely make it again. We didn't have a mixer (new place, it's in a box somewhere) so I didn't think the aioli would work when just whisked together, but it did.

Definetly a different way to make shrimp. The whole family enjoyed it. Will make this again for sure, but not as a regular meal. Kind of a lot of work for the weekday. Nummy left overs too :)

My family really enjoyed this--they tend to be soy sauce fans. It is different from the rest of my shrimp repertoire--we will probably have this from time to time. It's a nice change of pace.

Rating: 2
Very simple and nothing was lost by using non-fat mayo and cutting down the oil in the marinade to 2 1/2 tbl and putting very little oil in the pan to saute the shrimp. My boyfriend liked this way better than I did so that's why I'll make it again. It duplicates a lot of recipes that I already have. Served it with bok choy and oyster sauce with the rice and that made a nice meal.

the flovors are great and this is an easy weekday recipe for a hurried household. I serve it with suishi rice and a big green salad.

Awesome hors d'oevres. It's easy to make, can be made ahead and looks pretty when plated. I served the shrimp on a platter with the aioli on the side as a dipping sauce. No rice. Only change -- next time I might use a little sesame oil, either in the marinade or to saute the shrimp with.

Made this recipe for a dinner party and it was so easy because all can be done ahead and only the fast cooking shrimp at serving time to finish. This was a major hit at the party and all had second helpings! I have already made it again and will in the future.

Really good - with some major renovation. 6 T olive oil, 3 T soy sauce, 2 T rice vinegar, 1 T Reisling (no sake or Sherry), 1 T brown sugar, 3 garlic cloves and 2 green onions, minced. Marinated a chicken breast and some scallops for an hour and grilled them, served with extra marinade over brown rice.

Rating: 3
Not really sure if I'd make this again. It is definitely very salty, even with having used a bit less soy sauce (and low-sodium soy sauce at that). But its also tasy. Thanks to the previous reviewer, I just drained the marinade and boiled that, putting a bit in with the ginger aioli (which *definitely* needs a lot more ginger than called for), and then just adding the shrimp, eliminating the need for additional oil. The mayo does help with the saltiness some, and I served it over sauted spinach, which helped too. My husband loved it. I liked it, but with reservations.

We like less salt/oil & more seasoning in our food -so these were our changes. Decrease soy, use light soy. Decrease oil (use good olive oil) and increase sake. Add more ginger to the mayo. We drained the marinade and brought to a boil, then cooked the shrimp in the marinade (eliminating the "cook in oil"). Then added about 4 T. of the marinade to the mayo mixture. Topped the rice w/the shrimp (added some marinade to the rice) and then drizzled with the mayo mixture. I had originally been searching for "shrimp w/peanuts" and misspelled the peanuts and ended up with many great recipes, this being one of them. However - I had dry roasted peanuts on hand, so we topped the dish with the peanuts and chopped green onion. My husband suggested we might top w/ coconut and/or raisins also. The coconut might overpower the ginger, however.

My husband was raving about this dish before I had even sat down to eat. I made the recipe as written except used shallots since I had no green onions in the frig and probably use a bit more ginger than called for. While I wouldn't change a thing, my husband thought it was a bit salty so I'll use low sodium soy sauce next time. I served this with green beans and drizzled the beans along with the rice with the marinade and aioli. Delicious.

Rating: 3
This was quite good, but my dinner companion as more impressed with the dish than I was. The marinade was excellent and could be useful for other seafood, fish or chicken. As suggested by another reviewer, I added a pinch of hot pepper flakes to the marinade. I wasn't overly impressed with the ginger mayo, even though I added more ginger and marinade to it. I'll make this again, perhaps, but not often.

I used 1 tsp brown sugar because I don't like sweet dishes. It was very delicious and easy to make. The ginger aioli was fabulous with the shrimp.

Rating: 3
Easy and delicious weeknight dish. I made it for family to rave reviews. I added enough marinade into the aioli to make is 'drizzle-able'. My family kept adding it to left over rice once all the shrimp was gone! I made the sesame asparagus from this website to accompany the dish.

Excellent and easy - next time will heed the advice of others and add something green to the plate. Served it with the Mango, Corn, Jicama Salad on this site - yum!

Excellent! We used low sodium soy sauce and onions in place of the scallions/green onions in the marinade. The aioli was outstanding and would be wonderful with other shellfish and crab cakes. We'll try the marinade with boneless chicken.

Served this as an appitizer. Went over really, really well with my guests. I did cut the marinade in half and only used 3/4 cup mayonnaise. After adding the 2 T marinade, it was the right consistency. The aioli complimented the shrimp perfectly....we were all practically licking the plates. Definately a keeper

Rating: 3
This is a winner! I made it on a week night after work, so only marinated for 30 minutes. It was fabulously tasty, especially given the ease of preparation. Maybe with the minimum marinating time, it's less salty (as referenced by other reviewer's) because I thought it was perfect. Forgot to buy the ginger, so didn't do the aioli but will do so next time. Was great over rice with blanched snow peas on the side.

Rating: 3
Oh yeah. This is some kind of good. Used reduced-sodium soy sauce and didn't have any problems with the saltiness. My aioli was also quite drizzleable as I processed it quite well and added a touch more marinade. Had plenty of leftover aioli and plan to use it on tuna burgers tonight.

Rating: 3
I also thought this was a little salty and will cut a touch back on the soy sauce. With the addition of the boiled marinade to the ginger aioli, I found it just the right consistency to put in a squeeze bottle and decorate the dish.

I served the shrimp over mixed greens, which helped cut down some of the saltiness. Next time I will adjust down the soy sauce. Very tasty and simple.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! And so easy to make. Instead of white rice, I used brown jasmine rice and wilted spinich as a bed for the shrimp.

Absolutley delicious. Very easy and quick. Will definitely make this time and again. The Ginger Aioli is wonderful! To the ones that said it didn't really drizzle. I left it in my food processor for a couple of minutes longer than normal and gets more liquified and stays that way even when refrigerated.

Very very good. I didn't marinate at all (didn't have time) and still it was delicious. Have made it twice, with fresh shrimp from North Carolina!

I just made this for dinner and it was a huge hit, even with my son, who is so picky it's not funny. We all had seconds and my husband volunteered that this was a keeper. I'm glad to have extra aioli; i know it will be delicious on something.

Super easy to make with ingredients that are easy to find. The leftover aioli will definitely motivate you to find other uses for it. I served this with a mango-red chili salad and rice and the combination was great. Definitely try this

My husband and I completely loved this and were upset there were no leftovers! There was leftover aioli, however, which was yummy on sandwiches the next day. This recipe will surely be in our recipe rotation!

This was pretty good, but the finished product lacked color (the green gets mostly cooked out of the green onions). So, consider serving a green vegetable with it, or garnishing with herbs. Also thought this would be better with some crushed red pepper, or something to add a little heat.

This was fabulous! The combination of the soy, sherry and ginger was great. I agree on cutting the aioli in half and marinating longer. Yum!

The longer you can marinade the shrimp the better. Aoli was very good but not a consistency to drizzle. Unless you like to dorwn your shrimp in it, you can cut aoli recipe in half.

This was very easy to make and quite flavorful, maybe a little too flavorful. The marinate/sauce was very stong. Rice was the perfect starch because it helped ease the intensity. I will make this again but will modify the ingredients.

Very tasty and quick recipe using ingredients always on hand. Marinated for just over 1/2 hour. Cut the oil in marinade in 1/2 and just coated non-stick pan with a dab of olive oil. Used fat-free mayo for the aioli. Must say that the aioli didn't turn out to be the consistency to "drizzle" as the recipe said, but very good anyway. Don't think it had anything to do with using fat free mayo. This dish will be made again.

Excellent!! Followed recipe exactly. Served with basmati rice and steamed sugar peas in the pod. Used large fresh (never frozen) Gulf shrimp from Fabian's and marinated for 35 minutes with no texture problems. I think the problems mentioned by the Canada cook might have had more to do with the quality of the shrimp than the recipe. We loved this and have added it to our file of favorite shrimp recipes. May try grilling the next time. Also, probably could cut saute oil in half if making on the stove.

Rating: 2
This was very tasty and I loved the aioli. However, my beautiful big prawns had an unpleasant soft/mushy texture which detracted from the dish. I did not overcook, but suspect the marinade time was too long (3/4 hr.) which led to a breakdown of the protein in the prawns. Next time I will only marinate 15 min. and may drizzle a little marinade over the prawns while cooking to achieve increased flavour. Otherwise, this is a very good recipe, so do give it a try.
