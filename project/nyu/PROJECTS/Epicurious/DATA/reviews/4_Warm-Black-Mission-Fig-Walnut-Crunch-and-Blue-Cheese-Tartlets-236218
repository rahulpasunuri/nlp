This recipe was wonderful. Everyone loved it. However, the execution was a bit troubling. The walnut crunch wasn't crunchy in the finished product. The sauce was very thin, so the finished product was a bit liquid. I'll definitely make it again to see if I can correct my problems.

I had several texture problems. My figs kept sliding off, my crunch was too soft and my syrup was too sticky. Despite all the work involved in producing a fairly disappointing end product on this first attempt, I'll try it again---the flavor is excellent. Next time I'll pay more attention to the guidelines concerning caramelization--- "begins to turn golden" for the syrup, "deep golden brown" for the crunch. I'll also follow Snickers512's suggestion to bake the puff pastry first (with a sheet pan on top) and then pop the assembled tarts into the oven for another two minutes; hopefully this'll to prevent sliding.

I used this recipe for my plated desserts class at culinary school and my chef loved it. I did however make a few changes. First, I didn't assemple the tarts then bake them, I baked the puff pastry alone with another sheet pan on top to keep it from rising too much. For the figs, I sauteed them in the caramel/butter mixture for a while before adding the port then I continued sauteing them until they were close to being completely cooked. I then baked them until they were completely cooked. For the walnut crunch, I added a couple ounces of cream to make it a soft caramel rather than a hard caramel. After all the components were completed, I assembled the tarts (I put 5 figs on each tart), minus the bleu cheese, and reheated the whole thing. Then I sprinkled the bleu cheese on top and drizzled the syrup and honey over them. I think doing it this way kept the figs from falling off the tarts.

Made for an important family celebration, excellent, worth the steps.

I changed this recipe up a bit and it was fantastic. I used goat cheese instead of blue and put everything on a crostini...much easier! It was very good. Rave reviews. I would definitely make this again.

Many in our party liked this dessert. The unique flavors seem promising. However, it involved too much preparation for such a mediocre dish. For example, the brittle is beautiful, but after making it, you sprinkle it on the tarts and bake, so it all ends up as caramel syrup. My pastry puffed up and the brittle/syrup & figs kept falling off during baking. Pastry was tough on bottom, but maybe due to overbaking? There are too many other spectacular recipes out there.

This was a bit of a let down. A lot of work and I was somewhat disappointed. I would prefer a straight cheese course followed by dessert

Incredible dessert. I did not, however, think they reheated well when made ahead (they came out very chewy and hard to cut with a fork, sort of like baklava). When I made the port syrup, I wound out with some sugar chunks that just wouldn't dissolve, so I just ran it through a sieve and it was fine. I used dried figs soaked for a while in hot water and they were great. The flavors of this are amazing, and its good even without the cheese for those not inclined to blue-type cheeses.

I served this at a dinner party to rave reviews. The pairing of blue cheese, sweet port and fig beat out even chocolate to end a sophisticated evening. This recipe is going to be used again in the future when I want end a meal with a WOW!!

This is an absolutely incredible dish...the kind where people at the table take a bite, pause, start to smile, and begin looking around at eveyrone else at the table, who are all doing the same thing. Then the "wow's!" begin. Stop looking for a dessert to make for your guests. Make this!
