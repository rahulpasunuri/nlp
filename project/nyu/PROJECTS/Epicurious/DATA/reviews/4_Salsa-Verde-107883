Definitely a keeper and exactly what I was looking for. I have avoided salsa verde for several years after having (and made) many that were way too tart or didn't taste fresh. I recently found a local restaurant that served a great verde which inspired me to try one more time. I rolled up some pulled pork (saved without any bbq sauce and made with a rub that included chili and cumin)in some tortillas, poured a bit of this over, topped with cheese and served with tomato, onion, sour cream, avocado and more sauce on the side. Mmm mmm good!

I've been making this for years now, with two variations: we leave out the cilantro which everyone in my family finds utterly and absolutely disgusting and we use fresh Anchos (poblanos)instead of the Anaheims. It is still wonderful - delicious on so many things. As others have said - please don't skip the bit of cream. It smooths things out and adds silkiness and great depth of flavor. A touch of salt doesn't hurt either to meld flavors. Enjoy.

I used a different salsa verde recipe from epicurious - the roasted salsa verde so I can't comment on this one. The roasted is very good. The Ancho Chili Sauce is strange. It looks like my cream almost curdled, although absolutely nothing was even warm when I pulled it together - it is not a smooth, creamy sauce at all and the taste, as others have noted, is not all that great. I'd love to see a picture of what that sauce is suppose to look like. There is lots of spice in this recipe so make sure you and your guests like hot!

I used Hatch chiles, skipped the serranos and tomatillos altogether, and instead of whipping cream I topped with sour cream. So flavorful and delicious and HOT!

I used to order the Salsa Verde at our favorite Mexican restaurant when we lived in SC for years. Then I got the bright idea to make it myself. This is as good or better than how I remember theirs. We have trouble getting serrano and Anaheims so I have to substitute with either the little red Thai or Birds Eye, whatever I can find. It's still excellent!

This is delicious. I'm one of those people for whom cilantro tastes like dishwashing liquid, so I left that out. The only other change I made was to use poblanos instead of anaheims - and 4 instead of 2. I also put in a bit more cream to smooth it out. Everything else is as written - and wonderful. I can't get enough.

Made this recipe and instead of any of the chiles used 1 canned smoked adobo chile and a tsp of sauce and it turned out very good. The heat was medium and even enjoyed at room temp with tortilla chips. Would be wonderful on enchiladas

Unbelievable...A huge hit with everyone, young and old. I wasn't sure that adding the cream would be successful, but please, do not eliminate this step. The cream adds a silky texture that is to die for. Great recipe...bmo

Oh, God, this was incredible -- and to my mind better with the fabulous corn, cheese, and chili tamales than the more complicated tomatillo-avocado salsa.

Very tasty. I made it to go with the Santa Fe chicken --instead of bottled taco sauce. I also made a huevos rancheros with it and it was wonderful.

We (my family & guests) loved this salsa. I enjoyed it on scrambled eggs the next day.

Not particularly good served with salmon. Not particularly good off a spoon. Waste of ingredients.

I thought this salsa was excellent. Went very well with corn pudding. I used pablano peppers instead of the anahiem because that is what I had. I will make this again.

This salsa verde recipe is excellent!!! The flavor is outstanding. I could use a little more heat. And if you feel the same way, keep more of the pepper's inside membranes in the salsa. That will make it hotter, not the seeds as commonly thought.

Although this recipe is fairly straightforward, it does require a bit of prep, and takes me about 1 1/2 hours to complete. It's a great thing to make on a lazy Sunday. I did make a few modifications the 2nd time making this. Instead of whipping cream, I used half-and-half, and I used about 2tbsp at that. I also used 2 medium-large poblano peppers and 2 medium jalapenos. I chared them under a broiler, removed the skin and seeded them. I increased the cilantro to about 1/2 cup and even put a little parsley in to thicken up the consistancy a bit. This is a great salsa to put on chicken or pork.

This is an easy and delicious recipe! I substitued sour cream for the heavy cream, and stewed chicken breast in it, then served it with corn tortillas and Spanish rice. Undoubtedly, this is a new favorite of my family.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it was a hit! Very tasty and perfectly spiced for my group. I wouldn't change a thing and I'll certainly make it again. I served it as a salsa topping over pork tamales. I barely had a cup left when dinner was done. Yummy.

We loved this recipe and it's very easy to make if you have the ingredients on hand. I did not really like it over eggs, but we are eager to try it with chicken enchiladas or possibly with pork. I did not add the cream (lactose intolerant) and did use the lime juice. No serrano chiles were available, so I used a very large jalepeno and retained part of the ribs and seeds to give it a level of heat similar to a seeded serrano. Make this recipe - you won't be sorry if you like salsa at all.

Worthy of 5 forks. This recipe makes a lot of salsa (about 2 cups), and the remainder can be used on just about anything. So gooooooood!!!

Absolutely delicious! If you dont' like cilantro, I think you can leave it out and it's still good.
