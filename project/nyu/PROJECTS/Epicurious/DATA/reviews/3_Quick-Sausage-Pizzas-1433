This is a great combination of flavors! I love the zucchini, goat cheese, kielbasa combo. Servings are VERY generous.

Great pizza topping ideas. I used pita bread (what I always use for pizzas), Tofurky keilbasa instead of the meat version, garlic, onion, and red pepper flakes. Great combination of flavors.

We thought this recipe was ok...we really do not like Boboli crust so that may be the reason we didn't like it very much.

Although I had no dried tomatoes and used Italian sausage the recipe turned out wonderful. As good as any restaurant pizza I've eaten!
