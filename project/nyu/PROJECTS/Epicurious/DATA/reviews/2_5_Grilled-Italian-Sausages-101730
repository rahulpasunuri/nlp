I poached in chicken broth like the Lee's Summit's cook suggested. I used chipolatas because that's what I had. It was OK but I don't think I'll bother next time. I'll just chuck them under the grill straight away.

Poached in chicken broth for 15 minutes and then grilled. The broth mellowed the sausage and it tasted great. Poached in white wine, we didn't think the flavor was as good as the broth.
