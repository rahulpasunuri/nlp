The dish came out absolutely delicious, and was the star of the Thanksgiving meal! I added a little tad of water and some olive oil so that the oven wouldn't burn them. The only issue was that they were sharing the oven with the turkey, so the cooking time was lengthened because of the lower temperature. I had them in there for over an hour at 350. When the turkey was finally removed, I raised the heat for another 20 minutes and covered them with foil for the final 10. Delish!

I made this for Thanksgiving and was banned by the family of ever bringing the yams again! So, I fixed this again for an adult dinner party and added a little more brown sugar, some cinnamon, allspice and cloves and 1/2 can of cubed pineapple and half the juice from the can. I also cooked this in my electric skillet on low rather than the oven. I received rave reviews and will make this again.

Meh, I was not impressed with these sweet potatoes. I did double the sauce recipe and added ground ginger, allspice, and cinnamon as well as use about half the butter per recommendations of other reviewers. I found these to be a bit dry and it's impossible to prevent the sauce from burning and drying up. Won't make again.

This recipe is easy and delicious! I substituted half the butter for vegetable oil, and it turned out great. We had it with meatloaf and a green salad--a perfect cold-weather meal.

This was a hit with the family for Thanksgiving, even with picky kids and those that typically prefer family recipes - super easy. I reduced the amount of butter to 1 T, was definitely enough.

First time making this dish for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I actually doubled the sauce except for the butter. This dish is the perfect blend of sweet and savory. Can't wait to make this simple dish again.

I made it as instructed and it was a hit even for my picky little sister! This will have to be an addition to our Thanksgiving tradition.

I was sure I'd love this, but I found it lacking something. Maybe it needed more balsamic vinegar, as they were a little bit dry. Since I love balsamic vinegar and I love sweet potatoes, I gave it a two-fork rating figuring I would make it again at some point.

I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. It was really easy and tasty. I left the skins on the potatoes. I'd definitely make this again as just a weeknight dinner side dish.

These are awesome! I leave on the potato skins and add a red onion quartered. Perfect for week nights but special enough for nicer occasions.

This recipie has the perfect blend of sweet and savory freeing everyone from the traditional sweet potato casserole! My family insists I make this every year for Thanksgiving!!!!

These sweet potatoes were really delicious. I made them just like the recipe, and found them to be very flavorful. Used stonewear baking sheet with no burning/sticking. Served them along side a pot roast, and all raved!

This recipe is good but far away from being delicious. I decide to follow it without adding any other spices but next time I will try a suggestion of another review and add ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves. As others, I used less butter and 1 tbsp was enough. Don't forget to put foil at the bottom!

This is really amazing. But I've used half the butter the recipe calls for and it comes out just as good!! And you can cut the sweet potatoes thinner if you are pressed for time. At about 1/2 slices - it's done in 15 -20 mins in the oven.

This turned out very very yummy. I definitely recommend putting foil at the bottom of your pan, as the balsamic and sugar concoction will burn. Also, next time I'm going to put less butter in - it was a little too rich to pass as "healthy." Very good, though - I will make again.

Loved it!! I like very intense flavors, especially those from reduced vinegars, so I at least double the amount of balsamic. I served these at Thanksgiving last year and they were a huge hit. We like them even better the next day when they were reheated.

Am always amazed at reviews that indicate a recipe as being bland. If one is a cook one knows what a combination of ingredients will taste like before cooking. Add additional seasonings if suspect may be "bland" for your tastes.

We added just a pinch of some spices -- ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves -- which added some flavor. Delicious!

My family was delighted with this recipe for sweet potatoes. Be sure to fix plenty. We ran out!

Great recipe! Definitely the best way I've made & eaten sweet potatoes. It's pretty simple, but just delicious. Will be making this for Thanksgiving.

Fantastic. Ultimate comfort food. I served with the BBQ pork sandwiches with pickled onions from this site. I could see this being a great side for dinner roasts, but was simple enough to prepare for our late Sunday lunch.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was yummy! (and easy to make)- Even my youngest son who is not much of a vegetable eater loved it and had seconds.

Bought sweet potatoes for a different dish that I didn't make. Found this recipe and my husband who doesn't like the "candy sweet" Thanksgiving type of sweet potatoes loved them! Will cut them thinner to allow for more carmelization - which was yummy and perhaps add some fresh rosemary. They were great!

I love this recipe. And it's fun to watch the "I hate sweet potatoes" crowd scarf it up. Will make it over and over again!

Very good and very easy recipe. Soft on the inside and caramelized on the outside with a delicious flavour from the vinegar. Good for weeknight meals or for guests.
