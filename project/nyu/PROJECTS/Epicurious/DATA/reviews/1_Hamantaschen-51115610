This was a very time-consuming recipe, but I had poppyseeds that I wanted to use and love anything with a prune filling! I made the dough and refrigerated it overnight, rolling and baking the cookies the following day. I ended up running out of all-purpose flour so used about 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour in the dough. The cookies took about 30 minutes to bake, much longer than the recipe says. Perhaps because I had chilled the dough overnight? Once cooked, the pastry certainly wasn't dry, but it was a bit greasy instead and had no flavor. A disappointment since the raw dough smelled really good with the lemon zest. I have never made these types of cookies before so maybe this is how they're supposed to taste, but these were a disappointment and I will definitely not make them again.
