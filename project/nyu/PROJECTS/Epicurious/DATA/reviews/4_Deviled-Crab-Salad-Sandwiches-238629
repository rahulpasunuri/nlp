I made this recipe and tripled it. I also used my own mayo. I used just 3/4 cup mayo per batch but it was way too much. Next time i will use like 1/4-1/2 cup and add it gradually. The salad was fantastic. Also, a double stack was too much for my taste -- a normal single stack was easier.

This is awesome!Used TJ's can crab and it was super easy. Served with shrimp pumpkin bisque from this site. A hit!

This was a crowd pleaser. Interesting flavor and a little unusual, but very tasty. Because it's flavorful, I found that it tasted better with a rather thin layer of the filling, so that it wasn't too strong and you had the right ratio of bread to filling. Also, the boiled egg is a must. I also cut the mayo to 3/4 a cup with no problem.

I used chives instead of scallions and I love it, I used the ingrediants from celery up and put it in a tortilla with plenty of left overs :-)
