This soup was mediocre. I have this cookbook and it has some great recipes, but this was lacking in flavor and was a horrible dull brown color. Perhaps the key is making it with chicken broth to boost the flavor a bit.

Delicious with the recommended garnish ricotta. I'm not a vegetarian so I cooked the soup with chicken broth. Yummy

I love this cookbook, but this recipe was very mediocre. It smelled great until it was time to add the water, which killed the flavor. If I make it again, I won't add the water towards the end.
