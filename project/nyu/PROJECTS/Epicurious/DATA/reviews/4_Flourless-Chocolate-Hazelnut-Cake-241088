Following the suggestion in reviews, I made this without the hazelnuts. The cakes turned out perfect--baked in mini silicone loaf pans. I discovered that making one-third of the recipe is perfect for four people. I do add a little sugar to the whipped cream and fold in the chopped nuts. (I used toasted pecans.) My co-worker, who doesn't eat gluten, has been making a third of the recipe every weekend for the past month. She told me it's equally tasty with Kahlua.

This cake is so decadent! Loved the hazelnut flavor. Will make again and again.

I made this for christmas eve dinner and wanted something that would knock the socks off my guests. no socks knocked off- it was just ok. next time, i would leave out the ground hazelnuts for a smoother finish. it was also done in only an hour and although it's forgiving, it was a tad overbaked. a few people commented that it tasted like a brownie. on the plus side, it was not too sweet or too salty.

This is a very delicious cake. Loved the look of the cake but it is very difficult to slice. Does anyone have a suggestion for cutting the cake as when I used a slicing knife the cake was so dense that it left jagged edges and was not very attactive on the dessert plate. I also tried a serrated knife and it didn't slice evenly either.

This cake was such a hit at Passover seder that I have to make it every year. As a non-Jewish person who loves to bring desserts, it was a real challenge to find something that was not made with Matzo meal. I cannot tell you how many people asked for this recipe and still ask for it.

Turned out amazing! This is one of my "go-to" recipes for entertaining. It always comes out great! I substituted Amaretto liqueur for the Hazelnut.

Loved this! I didn't bother with the whipped cream the second time we ate it as leftovers.

Question: I've got a similar recipe (ground almonds instead of hazelnuts) and I bake it in a loaf tin rather than in a spring form in water. I don't have a spring form thingy but I'm tempted to try it in my tin. Any advice? I guess, I have to try it huh...

This was a first attempt at a gluten- free cake for my sister who has celiac sprue and it was a big hit. I followed the recipe exactly and the only change I would make next time is to reduce or eliminate the frangelico in the whipped cream. If using it add it after the cream is fully whipped.

A huge hit at a family reunion - we were 7 adults and 4 children, and ate all but one slim slice. We had no suitable liquer, and so I subbed the same amount of Orange Juice, and served with a Blood Orange Salad and no cream.

This cake is faily heavy and very very good. And recipe is easy to make. Even for a guy!

I wanted to make a gluten free dessert for my daughter, because she has Celiac Disease and does not tolerate gluten. (wheat). I used bittersweet chocolate with 70% cocoa, I could not find one with 60%. Turned out fantastic. Not at all salty like other reviews. Maybe the hazelnuts had been salted? Will make this cake a holiday tradition. Also, loved the whip cream.

I made this cake for passover. Everyone loved it. I cut it into 18 wedges and they were still very rich! I used unsalted butter and nuts and I did not find the salt overwhelming as other reviewers did. I also used parchment paper on the side of my pan (not just the bottom) and made it ahead of time. The whipped cream is divine.

I made this for Passover but used Khalua instead of hazelnut liquor. I got rave reviews. I used Kosher salt and it was not too salty. I toasted the nuts but may not do it again. I think I over baked and it was a little more dry than I would have liked but I would make it again.

This was an amazingly, rich and chocolatey dessert. I brought it to Easter Dinner and everyone raved about it. I agree the addition of the Frangelico made the whipped cream even better, would make again.

This was incredible. I made it the first time and new it was going to be one of those permanently in my file. Brought it to an Easter Celebration yesterday and was loved by all.

I made this cake for a birthday andit was great. The subtlety of the hazelnuts and the richness of the chocolate really worked well. I used choc. from Trader Joe's and it came out great and allowed it to be more affordable. The frangelica in the whipped cream was a great addition

incredibly rich...and perfect with red wine

I was excited to make this since I am a fan of flourless chocolate cake. But it was not sweet enough for most (even with the whipped cream) and too rich to eat more than a couple of bites. Won't make it again.

I too loved how easy this cake was to prepare, including to chill it overnight. If I made it again, I might leave out the nuts to give it a smoother consistency - the Frangelico alone gave it a nice flavor. Whipped cream is a must, to soften the rich flavor of the dark chocolate and fudgy consistency.

Amazing, easy to make, very sophisticated dessert...was loved by all and gone within minutes of serving.

I love dark chocolate and hazelnuts so I thought this cake would be heaven. Wished I had read the reviews before I made it -- it was too salty. It tasted like it was made with salted nuts. I thought it was a super easy cake to make and loved being able to make it ahead of time. I think I will try it again sometime but greatly reduce or eliminate the salt (and I did use Kosher salt).

I made this cake for a friend who has to have wheat free and dairy free food. I replaced the butter with an oil based butter substitute and only put in a pinch of salt. It was great and was well received by all. Thanks epicurious....

For the dark chocolate/hazelnut lovers I served this to, it was heaven. The Frangelico gave it a "grown up" taste even though I'm sure the alcohol had cooked out. It was slightly sweet, but not very sweet. I used half a teaspoon of salt, due to comments below. I am wondering though, if the folks below used kosher salt? 1 tsp might have been OK as long as you are using kosher salt.. Because of the coarseness, 1 tsp of Kosher salt has much less actual salt than the same amount of regular table salt. But anyhow... Me, I am more of a sweet dessert/milk chocolate kind of girl, so this dessert didn't do it for me as it did for others. The consistency was amazing though, as a reviewer below mentioned -- Almost like eating fudge! I highly recommend this for folks who enjoy dark chocolate and a grown-up sweet, but not-too-sweet dessert.

This was divine, and very very rich. The texture was even better the second day--like the best fudge. Be sure to grind the nuts to almost a powder.

I love this recipe. It is a must-try for chocolate lovers. The preparation of the pan is essential, otherwise you will wind up with a goopy mess. Make sure to use heavy duty foil! Also, for those who thought it was too salty, you must have used a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon OR used a very rounded teaspoon. The dish is not salty at all if prepared correctly. Rich and bittersweet!! As for the whipped topping, my guests and I thought it was a bit strong using 1/4 cup frangelico. If you are looking for just a hint, try using less.

I made this for guests on New Year's Eve and it was incredibly salty. I think the only ones who enjoyed it were my wheat-free friends excited to see a dessert they could actually eat. Others, not so much.

Delicious and incredibly easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly as written, except for the cocao content of the chocolate (I could only find 70%). I wonder if it freezes well?

I made this cake for a family dinner and followed the recipe to a "T". The only thing the keeps me from giving it 4 forks is that mine turned out REALLY salty! I will make this again but make some adjustments to the salt amount.

I don't like chocolate cakes and I loved this and so did my family. I am allergic to hazelnuts, therefore I used almonds. It was delicious and had a subtle taste of marzipan. I served in small pieces after keeping in the fridge for 5 days (wrapped in plastic) and my guests' eyes went wide as they took a bite. Excellent!

This is a great and easy recipe. I used milk chocolate instead (I forgot the recipe when I was at the supermarket). The cake is very dense and tastes like restaurant quality. I wanted to test it out since I am not a very good baker. The most challenging part is following the steps to actually bake the cake. It is worth it. I would definitely make this for company.

I'll admit, I didn't like it right out of the oven (I know, but I couldn't resist!), it tasted too much like a brownie, which I'm not a big fan of. After sitting in the fridge for a day, however, it was delicious!

This cake was incredible! I splurged and used Scharffen Berger 70% bittersweet chocolate. Recommend making day before since there was quite a bit of prep, baking, and cooling time. I also slightly warmed each piece before serving. Unbelievably yummy and decadent! Wow!!!

This is delicious! Loved that I could make this cake 3 days ahead. A seriously rich, dense and decadent cake.

This is a fabulous recipe! I had a similar recipe for a flourless chocolate w/ ground almonds - but this recipe is much simpler b/c you don't need to separate and whip the egg whites - no mixer is necessary! It's quick, simple and DECADENT! I used about 14-oz semi-sweet chocolate/bitterswee t chocolate to make it a little more dense. I used heavy-duty aluminum foil folded in half to wrap around the spring-form pan and it cooked beautifully. (I've made it twice - I found it took an hour and 40 minutes to cook in my oven). I decorated it with chocolate- dipped strawberries and it is a "showstopper!" This will be my new fave! Thank you! (ps - for one of the cakes I accidentally put in 1/2 cup Frangelico and it was fine - it's a very 'forgiving' cake!)
