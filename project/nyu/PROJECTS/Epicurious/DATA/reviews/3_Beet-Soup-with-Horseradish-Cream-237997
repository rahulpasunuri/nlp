I can never make a soup without stock, so I started with some turkey-neck stock, added in a carrot, and processed the cooked soup with an immersion blender to yield a smooth, brilliantly colored soup. The flavor was good, much enhanced by a sprinkling of chives, which add a beautiful color contrast. Nice but not spectacular. I'll try it again, maybe with a little grated ginger, to see if that helps.

This was the highlight of our Seder. Since other reviewers said it was dull, I made a quick vegetable stock for the 8 cups water. I also blended the soup so that there weren't the annoying chunks people mentioned. The horseradish cream was an amazing addition to the sweetness of the soup (we had a vegetarian meal). Everyone wanted the recipe!

Insipid. Real borsch is made with pork, sorry (you can always call it white steak like they do in Israel). Adding horseradish to the cream gives it some welcome punch but the soup itself is dull. Toying with traditional recipes can work, but not this time.

This was good, though I ended up with too much horseradish cream left over. I was also bothered by the onion chunks that I could distinctly taste - I think this soup would be better if it was processed in a blender or a food processer - it would be more like my grandma's old recipe of the cold summer borsch with grated beets that we added fresh chopped cucumbers, radishes, and hard-boiled eggs to. Very refreshing on a hot summer day!

The recipe does call for non-dairy or soy sour cream. that would make it acceptable, am I correct?

This recipe can't be used for a sedar. Although it does look delicious, passover sedar is not a dairy meal. Can anyone suggest a way to top the soup while avoiding dairy?
