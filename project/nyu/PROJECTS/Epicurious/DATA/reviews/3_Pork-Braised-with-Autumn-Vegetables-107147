I also marinated my own pork loin and halved the recipe on the meat side, but actually increased the veggie side by adding a carrot, and a turnip. I also cut an onion in chunks in place of petite onions. I browned the tenderloin in the hot frying pan with a little oil on each side and then moved it to a foil covered plate after about 5 minutes. Cooked the veggies according to the recipe and when they were close to done and most of the liquid was gone, I put the tenderloin on top of everything and put the uncovered pan into a preheated 350 degree oven for about 12 to 15 minutes. Removed from oven and cut the meat into 1/2 inch slices and mixed in with the vegetables and served. Meat was medium rare, root vegetables were soft and the mix of flavors permeated the meat for a delicious dish.

Very delicious. I marinated my own pork tenderlion and used carrots, turnips, sweet potato and zucchini. My advice is to remove the veggies when they are tender but leave a few behind to cook in the sauce as it is reducing. Then mash them into the sauce for even more flavor. Reminds me of a pot-au-feu. Yum.

We loved this receipe. My boyfriend is quite the cook and is usually "kicking up" the flavor in most receipes. He didn't have to with this one. We used a mustard marinated pork tenderloin and spicy grey poupon mustard. The sauce was excellent! We also enjoyed the autumn vegetables, which neither of us had ever eaten before. This receipe is a keeper!

Absolutely delicious -- we LOVED this! I used a pre-marinated (garlic/onion) pork loin from Costco and because it was a thicker piece of meat than a pork tenderloin I never removed it from the braising liquid (I did turn it to allow for even cooking, then removed the lid for a few minutes to allow the liquid to reduce). I used baby onions, butternut squash, diced celery, baby carrots, sliced mushrooms and peas, as well as about 1 additional cup of chicken broth. It was so easy and thoroughly delicious -- the butternut squash added a lovely and delicate sweetness to the sauce. I served it with some good crusty bread and we had a lovely, cozy meal. I will definitely make it again!

I am not a mother, yet, but I found Tulsa's comment below to be annoying--it is not worth getting offended over. Is she saying that all full-time parents, past and present, who bothe(ed) to serve their kids fresh meats, sauces, veggies, AND help them with their homework, pick them up practice, are bad parents? Well, naturally. Smack! Maybe my parents should have bought a Hormel Roast Beef A Jus instead of making roasting a chicken (SO hard!) so they could prance around and spend time on this site bragging about all the time they save and what grrreat parents they are! Why does she need to justify to a bunch of strangers that she is an accomplished cook? By the way, Gourmet does not have a "Too Busy to Cook" section akin to Bon Appetit's- they only have "Gourmet Everyday" --there is a big difference between the two.

So, just because I like prepared foods and shortcuts means I can't enjoy Epicurious?? Are you serious?? Puleeze! Talk about food snobbery! I subscribe to Gourmet, Bon Appetit, Cooking Light and Cooks Illustrated as well as Food and Wine. All of these magazines have involved, "gourmet" recipes. They also have recipes for cooks short on time such as the "In short order" and "too busy to cook" sections. I am actually a very accomplished cook. I can whip up some the most amazing recipes out there. I have mastered Peking Duck from scratch, excellent Beef Wellington, the lightest soufflés and some pretty amazing desserts just to name a few. I even tried my hand at making a turducken. I just don't choose to cook like that all the time. Life is too short and lets face it food is just fuel most of the time. My family and friends are too important to me. Some of the best nights we have as a family are inviting close friends to dinner, throwing a pot of pasta on the stove. Add to it a bag of ready-made salad, a good loaf of bread and some excellent red wine. The kids get to help out, it's easy and so is the clean up. The food is fine but the laughter and time spent together is more important. And to the person who thinks that they "can do it all" I can't wait to see what your kids have to say in 20 years

I am not fond of the premarinated pork loins, so I just brushed with dejon mustard and som honey and prepared the recipe. There are better things to get angry over than premarinated meats. an ounce of pretention is worth an ounce of Bull S***. Many people like these premarinated stuff and ate least they are eating dinner at home. Have you thought that people are try these recipes are just starting to cook? be nice, dont discourage. the recipe was good, but my family gets this funny look when I serve squash. My son refers to it as a large salad and 3 rool night.

Just like the meatball recipe, I LOVED this one too. Any shortcuts I can take are welcome and I find no difference it quality. Food is fuel most of the time. Life is too short to spend all your time in the kitchen. Why not spend that time with your family and friends instead? A few of my other favorite things: ready made rolls, luncheon meats, boxes of pre-cooked appetizers etc. They sure make life easier. Puhleeze, what do I want my to kids remember most- "gourmet" home marinated pork loin and mom too tired from working all day and cooking all night, or the fact that mom was always available to play with them and have fun!

to the Cordon Bleu student: Thank you, thank you, thank you for bringing a voice of reason to this site. I'm always suspicious of radical food snobs--for one thing, they seem to be able to suck the joy out of anything. While I think we should always aim for high-quality ingredients and preparations with integrity, the occasional convenience product is not a crime, and can actually produce a pretty good meal.

I am a student at the Le Cordon Bleu culinary academy. I enjoy reading the debates about purchased vs. homemade foods that are so bountiful on Epicurious of late. Many of the cooks who claim to oppose "convenience" foods on moral grounds would be startled to know the extent to which a professional kitchen relies upon such things as frozen meatballs, pre-prepared sauces, and premarinated meats. I was shocked myself to see some of the things that the pros keep in their larders. That said, let's follow their lead. Every cook should certainly know how and why a marinade works, and how to concoct a simple one and plunk a piece of pork down in it. Every cook should understand how to put a good homemade "from-scratch" meal on the table, from the stocks to the breads to the fancy flaming desserts, if that's where your heart lies. BUT! No one can be expected to do this every night. Finding a good deli that stocks quality premarinated meats is a blessing, and there are many top-notch vendors of good and tasty "convenience" foods out there. We would be fools to ignore them, and the line between "food enthusiast" and "food snob" is very thin--especially, it seems, on this website. P.S. To the previous reviewer, a parsnip is a root vegetable that looks like a lumpy white carrot. It tastes sweet, something like a carrot/potato hybrid. And best of all, you can buy it, all ready to go, in stores!

I made this as written. It was ghastly. The marinade ruined it. I made it again, using plain fresh tenderloins, and it was very good.

I actually did make this recipe, and I thought it was quite good--really simple too. I also used tenderloins that hadn't been pre-marinated, and I added carrots. I found the sauce really tasty.

Yes, I would make this again, yes I used fresh pork because I like fresh, no I'm not going to cancle my subscription! I like to find new ideas and combinations for cooking as much as just new redipes period. If you're so hung up on fresh-fresh-fresh, maybe a health food subscription would suit you better! And this is coming from someone who uses two knives to chop her beef for "hamburgers", so get a life and get over it. It's time to grow up and stop whining!

Okay, here is a tip for making your own marinade for ANYTHING: Start with something acidic (wine, lemon juice, vinegar), add something salty (salt, broth, soy sauce), add a pinch of sweet (sugar, honey), add some oil (olive, canola, vegetable), add spices (pepper, dijon mustard, garlic, ginger, basil, whatever you have on hand). Voila! Marinade!

Rating: 2
I don't care for premarinated meats, so the recipe as is, is useless. However, it is easy to marinate a pork loin; something acidic + some salt and herbs, wait a few hours and ready to cook. The concept of the recipe is fine and would work well for a sat or sun meal, when you have the time to incorporate the marination time. To all of the evangalists out there, lighten up. Opinions are fine, venom turns people away and alienates them from what you are trying to express.

I find pre-marinated meats to be too "artificial" tasting, so I made my own marinade, using Dijon mustard, a bit of chopped garlic, some thyme, and some dry white wine. I used turnips and carrots in addition to the squash, onions and parsnips. It was easy to make, and my kids (who are very picky eaters) devoured it in no time! Thank you for another great recipe to add to my collection.

To NY: Do you always have trouble with comprehending the written word? Why would we "Yahoos" take the time to try pre-marinated meats when we know they contain unwanted chemicals? You are what you eat!

Rating: 3
To the YAHOOS who feel it necessary to sound off regarding this recipe even though you haven't taken the time to try it: PLEASE STOP! I visit this site to find good recipes and I try to take other reviewer's comments seriously; I'm happy to report that most of the time I am not disappointed. However, your diatribes on the evils of pre-marinated meats are messing with my groove. If you feel compelled to make your opinions known, check out the recipe for salted boiled water. I'm sure you'll find fault with the ingredients there as well, but hopefully you will, at some point, have tried the recipe!

Rating: 0
My response to the reviews is: At what price to we use pre-marinated, chemically treated foods. I've recently returned to the US and am having a hard time finding decent fresh meat at the the grocery store. The fresh meat section is getting smaller and smaller. If the chemicals used to mariante this meat were in your kitchen you wouldn't use it. The receipt sounds great and quick, but we have lost the ability to choose what ingredigents go into our food even though we have unlimited choices.

I truly love to cook, and I do like to receive other reader's evaluations of the recipe. What I do not like is a snobbish attitude toward those who take short cuts or buy pre-packaged foods. My attitude is that if I can find something which tastes almost as good as I can make it from scratch and the cost is fairly close to home-made, I will use it in a tight and feel absolutely no guilt. Neither will I look down on others who take short cuts. Yes, I even use Pillsbury's Refrigerated Pie Crusts at times -actually, most times. At one time, I made all my meat and vegetable stocks, corned my own corned beef, spent hours on elaborate desserts,breads, etc.I have more of a life now, and I spend it doing exciting things. Cooking a great meal is a special pleasure, too. My husband splurged $75.00 over 40 years ago to buy me a lifetime subscription to Gourmet. Yes, it has changed over the years. Yes, I do miss some of the features, but I have changed, too. Younger women usually do not have the time to spend hours on each meal. Therefore, I applaud Bon Appetit and Gourmet for making tasty, attractive food recipes available to all kinds of cooks. Let's share our love for cooking and leave the sniping to hunters. I'd like to learn from each of you, for I can tell there are a lot of great cooks here. Bon Appetit! (or Gourmet) for that matter. Nita

Update: yes, I did make this last night and thoroughly enjoyed it. I made the changes as stated below and it was a hearty and delicious dinner. Made my own mustard marinade, added fresh thyme and rosemary from my garden, used home-made chicken stock and added a little light cream to the sauce which was rich and very tasty served on mashed potatoes. A good, comforting dinner on a wet and blustery evening. Initial comments: Hey, I agree about the pre-marinated pork - much better to make your own marinade, quick and easy and infinitely better tasting. However, with a few changes I think the rest of the recipe sounds very good. I would sub rutabagas for the squash and fresh pearl onions for the frozen onions, and add carrots, some garlic, fresh herbs, and lots of pepper and maybe some white wine. No, this dish is not gourmet dinner party fare, but it sounds like good down home cooking to me! What is not to like?! Not every recipe needs to have copious and exotic/expensive ingredients or a complicated cooking method to produce good food. Very often, the simpler the better! Think I'll go to the market right now and get what I need to make this dish!

Did any of you actually make the recipe? Hey, if you don't want to buy premarinated meat (which I did not), then don't. Enough said.

I liked the use of seasonal veggies and I'm always looking for one recipe meals that make my life much easier. And for those of you who use these recipe reviews as a gripe forum, maybe next time you could just reserve your comments for recipes you actually made. Thank you.

I agree with those who cite recipes such as this as evidence of the "dumbing down" of Gourmet (even though this recipe is cited from BA). I also ended a decade-plus long subscription because of the change (remeber when there were artists' illustrations in the restaurant reviews?). I believe it is the effort to broaden the mag's audience (which means lowering standards) as well as luring more lucrative advertisers (packaged and processed food conglomerates) that has decimated the quality of the magazine. Although I must admit that I am sometimes tempted to subscribe again when the adverts arrive in the mail, all I need to do is look at the current Saveur and I remember what it's all about.

This type of recipe is precisely why I cancelled my 15 year subscription to Gourmet. It's the dumbing down of cooking in America.

The pre-packaged pre-marinated pork tenderloin was awful, excessively salty, with metallic overtones. If I were to try this again, I would go with fresh pork tenderloins, to which I would add marinade made using either of two recipes on this site: pork with gorgonzola sauce or garlic and rosemary roasted pork. The five extra minutes are well worth it.
