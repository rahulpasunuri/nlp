Way too much work for too little reward. Wrapping, dipping, coating and frying is a messy, awkward process.

More like 2.5... I made this with 3 medium-sized regular purple top turnips and prosciutto instead of pancetta. The texture is great, but on the whole these are rather bland, despite the best effort of salt & pepper. These reheat well, and as-is, go well with spicy ketchup. I would make this again, but would use bacon/pancetta rather than my substitution. Alternatively, I would not fry the prosciutto onto the turnip, instead wrapping it uncooked over the turnips after baking them, to maintain the meaty flavor.

Suprisingly, these are rather simple and turn out every time I've made them. I use procuitto instead of pancetta.
