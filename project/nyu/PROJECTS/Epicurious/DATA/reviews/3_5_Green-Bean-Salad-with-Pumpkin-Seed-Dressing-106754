My husband and I loved this salad, I added cucumbers and made the dressing with roasted pistachios. My husband could not stop "um umming" while eating.

This was a decent dish, but nothing exciting. I would suggest using 1/2 of the dressing. There was way too much for my taste. Probably won't make this again.

Exceptionally delicious. I'm looking forward to using this sauce in several other dishes; the leftovers from this time will go on grilled fresh corn.

I have made this recipe numerous times and am always asked for the recipe. I usually make the full dressing recipe (with pumpkin seeds and omitting the tomatoes), but use 1 1/2 - 2 lbs green beans. This has become a summer staple for us.

I have been looking for healthy, non-bland veggie dishes and good ways to use up my excess cilantro. this recipe did both! i made it with pine nuts and really enjoyed the sauce, although next time I will cut it in half as my beans were positively swimming.

I think the key to this recipe is to imagine the dressing as a pesto or sauce rather than a typical vinaigrette. I doubled the lemon juice and added more water and it was great. It's also delicious on potatoes, pasta, sandwiches etc: that is, I used it any way I'd use pesto

The dressing was gloppy, overpowering, and heavy. This dish is a bad idea.

My husband made this using pine nuts. Like other reviewers, there was too much dressing for the amount of green beans, but we enjoyed the leftovers mixed with a little vinegar on salad greens. I'll definitely ask him to make it again. Maybe tonight!

I have made this recipe 3 or 4 times exactly as is and think it's great. I wouldn't change a thing!

I really didn't enjoy this. The sauce was good but too thick and its just not how I like to eat green beans.

I thought this recipe bombed. The dressing is very thick and heavy and overpowers the delicate flavor of the green beans. I won't make it again.

This was yummy! We used half pine nuts and half pumpkin seeds. Although, it makes too big a batch and we had so much dressing left over. I think you could cut the dressing recipe in half and still have left overs. What happened was, it was too vinegary, so I had to add more oil to compensate and the recipe kept growing. I would skip the vinegar completely as the capers and anchovy add enough zing. In fact, make the recipe with no vinegar, then taste it. You might want to add a few drops of vinegar or lemon juice. That is my only complaint. This is a beautiful dish - red and green colorful! It was a perfect match to the mild Corn Spoon bread in the same story. We served it with grilled steak topped with a powerful herb sauce. The left over dressing will be good with other vegetables or salad. Warning: The dressing is rich and thick because of the nuts and seeds. Since it is a hearty dish, serve it with other things that are lighter.

Excellent recipe, though my dressing turned out a little heavy and thick--it's very rich. But turns out to be a lovely flavor combination with the simple green beans and tomatoes. Very simple and quick to make too.

This recipe was fabulous. I did make a few changes to adjust to my own preferences. I was a bit heavy on the garlic, used pine nuts instead of pumkin seeds (could not get them), and was very heavy on the cilantro. Next time I make it, I will make extra dressing. I expect that it would also be good over asparagus, snow peas, or sugar snaps.
