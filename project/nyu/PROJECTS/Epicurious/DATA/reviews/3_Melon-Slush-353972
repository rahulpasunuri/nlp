Eh. It was like drinking cantaloupe instead of eating it. I'll return to this when i can't chew my food anymore. It definitely needed more acid (lime juice?). Maybe my cantaloupe was too ripe...is that possible?

Taste was awful. Consistency was gritty. Even my kids did not like it.

Hubby doesn't like cantaloupe, and he called this "Fantastic!" Thanks ShowyChef2, light rum is terrific in this.

I crushed my ice beforehand, but the color didn't come out so orange, more like a sorbet. The vodka tip was good. And in the end I added more orange juice for a better flavor.

I just served it on-the-rocks with orange vodka and a mint garnish...yum!

It's also great with vodka! I will be serving this with a red curry tonight.

I used 2-3x as much orange juice and was surprised at the bright, fresh flavor. I also tried adding egg white protein powder and soy protein and it was still great.

This was good but I prefer using white grape juice instead of orange juice - keeps the cantaloupe flavor. It is also good with Honeydew and the white grape juice. I usually freeze the juice and use it as ice cubes.
