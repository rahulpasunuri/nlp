This dish is a real hit in my house. I have made it several times and it always comes out perfect. Last night I substituted red wine for the white and it was excellent. Turkey is a healthy choice as it is low in fat and high in iron (and you can't beat the price). My guests were surprised that it was not Veal! I should never have told them!

I made this recipe as written with turkey thighs and it was quite delicious. The house smelled great while it was cooking. We had leftovers but no one touched them. I think turkey does not refrigerate well and takes on a different flavor from the original, just made taste. I would recommend that you make just enough to finish.

We loved this dinner for two, with these modifications: " two turkey thighs, skinned and deboned, cut into cutlet-sized pieces " instead of 'marinara' sauce, used two cups canned Hunts tomato sauce and flavored it all with dried oregano, basil, thyme, and sage " simmered 1 hour in oven (using convection bake setting) " served over buttered farfalle.
