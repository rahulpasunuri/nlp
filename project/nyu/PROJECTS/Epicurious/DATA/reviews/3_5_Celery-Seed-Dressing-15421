This is a variation of a great recipe in Joy of Cooking. I use 1/2 cup sugar, eliminate the paprika, and use 2 tsp celery seed dressing. Try it on a fruit salad with lettuce, grapes, oranges, kiwis, even avocado. Delicious. Don't worry about the onion juice -- just pop 1/4-1/2 onion into the blender when making it. Presto! fabulous dressing!

This is a good -- but not fantastic -- dressing, if you, like me, are in to retro salad dressings.
