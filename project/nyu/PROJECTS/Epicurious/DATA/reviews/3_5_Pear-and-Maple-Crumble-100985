This was delicious and extremely easy to make. I didn't have the ginger on hand so went without. Also, I suggest using less flour in the crumble, as it did taste a bit too "floury". But great and simple dessert!

This was terrific especially with some of the changes I made based on the comments from other reviewers. I used 60% of the maple syrup and 60% of the sugar. I also substitute pecans instead of walnut which can overpower the pear. Perfect

I really liked this recipe. I made it as a dessert at Thanksgiving and used fresh whipped cream insteadof sour cream, which I forgot to buy. I also substituted dreid berries for the raisins. I really like dthis recipe but would try it with a mix of apples next time to give it some strength. The pears were over powered byt eh crust to my taste but fortunately the crust is excellent.

I liked this dish enough that it helped me get rid of my pears. I also liked that the maple was muted by the end of it all. But i think it needs some greater spice or heat to offset the sweetness, more than just the ginger. perhaps chinese 5 spice of even freshly cracked black pepper.

Great combination of flavours. Did not use the ginger and cut amount of maple syrup in half, will be a favorite for long time to come.....

This was truly incredible, as well as amazingly easy. I did not find the fruit too sweet, but I probably would have had I not cut down on the sugar in the topping. Perhaps those who found it too sweet did not use pure maple syrup, which is a MUST.

My mom's pear treee was overloaded and so was my fig tree -- so I combined the two for this crumble with great results. Using the pears and figs, instead of raisins, I also used pecans instead of walnuts. I used a smaller, square pan and as a result didn't need all the topping. For whatever reason, it needed an additional 20-plus minutes to reach that brown and bubbling stage. We ate it with vanilla ice cream -- I could have devoured the whole pan in one sitting but made myself save some for later. I am making it again this week for my mom!

This was the second time we made this dish and this time we made a few changes. For the Thanksgiving season, we added dried cranberries. Also we found that leaving the peel on the pears did't adversely affect the final product and saved us some work.

This dish was a big hit with my family. I made it with some changes, based on previous reviews. I used half the maple syrup and sugar that were called for in the recipe. I used whole wheat pastry flour in the topping and I used dried cranberries instead of raisens.

The fruit filling was jaw achingly sweet and lets face it, good as they are, pears don't have an intense flavor. I would suggest using perfectly ripe fruit as firm pears do not get any softer with 30 min of baking time. I baked for an additional ten min and that one very firm pear nearly ruined the dish, in my estimation.

This was a tasty dessert, but VERY sweet and VERY rich. If that's what you're looking for, then this is your thing. Personally, I like my fruit desserts to really taste of fruit, but found that the sugar and the maple, and even the walnut, really control this dish. I added extra ginger and traded raisins for cranberries. I might try it again with less sugar and syrup...will report back if I do.

Very easy and very yummy! I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins as another reviewer suggested, and I served it warm with some cream. I can't wait to make it again!

This was comfort food at its best. A very mellow and rich dessert. Great by itself or with vanilla ice cream.

Yummy; everyone loved it! I did make a couple of changes. I too, don't like raisins with pears so I used sweetened dried cranberries. They were perfect. I served the crumble with the new Dreamery ice cream, Dulce de Leche--just right. Why bother with the Cruisnart when the topping can be made with pie crust blender and then used instantly?

This is a wonderful recipe. One of my all time favorites...flavors are very subtle and somehow rich. Sour cream is a great addition (I use reduced fat). Have taken this to several dinner parties to rave reviews. Excellent dish for the fall--and great for pears that are near the end of their "life cycle".

Wonderfully rich tasting dessert. I'll definitely do it again.

A very respectable dish, good to use up leftover pears. Skip the raisins, though--don't see how they belong in this dish. Overall, very good, and not too sweet--to me this feels healthy enough for a weekend breakfast.

What a pleaser! Had a basketful of pears ready to become deceased, just clicked on pears, and found this gem. Thank you Epicurious!!!

This is a great dish. I didn't have enough pears so added some granny smith apples. Delicious.
