We made the scallops for a Christmas party. They disappeared quickly! Many people asked for the recipe. We didn't have any cayenne, substituted ancho chili powder.

Made this for a neighborhood dinner party and got rave reviews. I only used half of the curry because I was afraid it would be overwhelming. I would make this again in a heart beat!

My MIL made these & they were very good, but a bit too spicy for me. She was delighted b/c the bacon actually cooked. I will definitely be making them.

Used proscuitto as suggested by another review and these were delish! I did not use the curry and cut the cayenne as my guests did not like alot of spice. Will add next time as I love spicy food. This can be prepared a couple hours in advance.

These are very easy to make and very delicious ! We have made these several times, even as a light main course. Cut the pepper in half, because if made as written they are very spicy hot. Also, we substituted prosciutto for bacon skipping the bacon steps which makes it an even easier dish. The prosciutto produces a finer taste. Enjoy!

Wow! Great taste. I used Neuske's smoked bacon and half the cayenne as my husband is not fond of hot. Only had enough bacon for half the scallops so I used the sugar mixture to coat the remaining scallops. Everything was delicious.

A kind of ramake updated version. I added a water chestnut for crunch.

Great flavor, need to sear at the end to get a good crisp

I thought it was fabulous! I used Costco maple bacon, which is thick bacon and large sea scallops. We had it for dinner! Easy preparation....!

I made this for our gourmet party last night with just one tweak: I substituted half the curry powder with the same amount of Garam Masala. It gave it a slightly more complex flavor and it was a unanimous hit. Awesome and so easy. I had really huge scallops, too, so I cut them in thirds rather than in half. The hostess wants the recipe for her Superbowl party next weekend.

Really fantastic and very simple - a marriage of bacon and scallops has always been good but this is like they have gone on vacation to an exotic island! Loved the flavors and didn't change a thing (unusual for me!).

So many compliments on this dish. I doubled the recipe without any trouble at all. In fact, friends wanted to get in on the fun assembling them!! I am planning to make them again this weekend!

We thought this was an excellent recipe. Simple and full of flavor. We may try to grill them the second time around.

This was great! I didn't have cayenne pepper handy, so I used chili powder, and that seemed to work. The predominant flavor is sweetness from the brown sugar, and this is a much tastier dish than regular bacon wrapped scallops. Perfect for a party!

I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the results. Instead of an appetizer, I served them over wild & longrain rice for dinner. It made a quick and easy weekday dinner. Delicious!
