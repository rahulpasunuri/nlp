Made the basic stuffing last month during the heavy rains and winds of Hurricane Sandy before the power went out. Froze the stuffing until the day before Thanksgiving when I added the eggs and broth. Very rich, very delicious, and so easy! A Thanksgiving keeper! Only modification, I used two 12 oz. bags of potato bread cubes, the only stuffing ingredients I could find in October. B.J. Harrick

This is the one stuffing everyone in my family can agree on. I have several vegetarians and make this with veggie sausage and veggie broth. I also replaced the currents with chopped hazelnuts, which adds a great crunch. The amount of broth needs to be increased if you are making dressing rather than stuffing. I doubled it.

I'd give this stuffing 3.5 forks if possible. I don't like stuffing. But this was great: it came across as a "traditional" stuffing without being too heavy. It was actually quite light and VERY flavorful. I made according to recipe, except substituting dried cherries for the currants and I used a hearty asiago/herb bread. I don't like chicken liver either. It grosses me out. But I used it, and I think it's important. I had my butcher trim and cut it for me so all I had to do was dump it in the pan (also ordered the sausage meat uncased) - so it was easy. I did spend some time chopping all of the cooked meat finely before adding it to the bread mixture, which I highly suggest. Finally, I think a lot of the flavor developed as the bread/herb/cooked meat mixture sat, covered, all afternoon. I highly recommend mixing things up ahead of time and letting it sit. This may become my yearly Thanksgiving stuffing.

I love it. I add chard or spinach and skip the currants. Just personal preference.

This is the new family standard. Reading the reviews I am SHOCKED how many people omit the livers. Why? Does NOT taste like a mouthful of liver. It adds a rich mouth feel. I don't love livers but it's not the point, it adds something intangible. Keep them in American!

Advantage - make a day ahead! Cubing and baking the slices of white bread was time-consuming. Surely there is a better way to create the breading for the stuffing. Italian sausage was delish in the dish, but suggest skipping the livers. (I like livers, but not in this recipe) Makes for great leftovers, too.

I've made this every year since it came out. My family won't let me make anything else. Delicious. Definitely needs the chicken livers.

Fixing this for the 4th time for Thanksgiving. I do not put in the liver, but 1.5 lbs of Itialin sausage instead. I use dried cherries and 2x the amount of broth for more moistness. The family requests this EVERY year. Even my parents (80's) prefer this recipe over the traditional stuffing. Bon Appetit'!!

This recipe was wonderful when I used it for Thanksgiving last year. My family had no idea that it was homemade. The flavors were great!

Delicious! Great change from my traditional dressing recipe. However, I am rating this with changes. I used whole wheat bread, spicy italian turkey sausage, and omitted the chicken livers. I also made half the recipe (except the broth) and it was plenty. Will make again for sure!

Love this stuffing recipe! I omit the chicken livers and decrease the celery.

My Italian mom had a similar recipe. Her mom brought it with her when she can from Italy 100 years ago. One less onion, 1/2 pond ground beef instead of chicken livers, and 1 package of frozen spinach, defrosted, adding at the end. Of course lots of garlic cooked with veggies, 4 or 5 cloves. You dont need to use chicken broth. My mom did not use raisins. It has been a hit with friends and family as long as I can remember. Its not Thanskgiving without it. The best part, use it on turkey sandwiches the next day.

Delicious!

Hands down the hit of our Thanksgiving. Had to add more broth than called for. The only complaint that I heard, was there was a bit too much black pepper. This instantly became a must make recipe for future holidays. A++++

A meal by itself! I have made this several times and I can't find a better stuffing recipe. If you make a smaller batch watch that it doesn't burn on the bottom.

This is the second year I've made this stuffing for Thanksgiving, and it confirmed its place on our "must have" list. I omit the chicken livers and currants, substituting extra sausage. This recipe is also a keeper for anyone who likes to do the majority of T'giving cooking a day or two in advance.

I made this stuffing this year for the second thanksgiving in a row. It was loved by all and proclaimed as the best part of the meal by some. Though, I am not often one to stick to the same recipe, this stuffing is destined to become a thanksgiving tradition.

My family refused to let me make any other stuffing on Thanksgiving.....this one is fantastic! This is the fav dish of the meal.

Being Asian, we never ate stuffing at Thanksgiving until one year when I made my parents buy a Pepperidge Farm mix, which we've used ever since. We always thought that was adequate; but when I served this, I got rave reviews from everyone, including the Americans dining with us. Don't leave out the liver, it adds a key depth of flavor with the currants; but since this tends to be slightly dry, I'd modify the recipe by adding a generous amount of pan drippings. It's not the same comfort food Stove Top is; but it's certainly an elegant upgrade.

This stuffing was not bad. Might make it again, but it seemed to be a little dry. Loved the smell. Might be better with a little bigger fruit.

This was a Thanksgiving hit! Best stuffing I have tasted. I made it in advance according to the recipe and the results were perfect.

I have never been a stuffing lover, however this is definitely going to be added to my Thanksgiving recipes. My teenage daughters also loved it. I used hot Italian sausage as suggested by another reviewer and it added an extra something to the recipe.

This was my first attempt to make stuffing and chose this due to the comments others made. It was great! I made some changes to the recipe though by adding golden raisins rather than currants, chicken apple sausage instead of Italian and cut out the liver and used less bread. Will definitely make it again!

This recipe was excellent. I didn't use chicken livers at all. I just substituted the livers for hot sausages. I also couldn't find dried currants so I used dried cranberries instead. The dish was easy to make. This is coming from someone who has never cooked dinner in her life. I would definitely make this again. I don't even like stuffing but this was great.

Fabulous! Everyone wanted seconds. Like another reviewer, I left out the livers and used half regular Italian sausage and half hot Italian sausage. This one goes in the recipe box!

Yum city,.... but no way can you not taste the liver. I hate liver but put it in because a previous reviewer said she couldnt notice it... i sure did. yechhhhh. BUT, man, this stuff was good, loved the addition of currants. For me, all stuffing should have sage in it, as this one does, but this also has a twist to it, so i'll definitely make it on Thanksgiving.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was great - really well rec'd. I did not follow the recipe exactly as printed here, added more seasoning (fresh rosemary, ital parsely and sage) and carmelized onions and fennel. Dotted the top with butter before baking - delicious. Use the chicken livers, they add a depth of flavor that you cannot get from sausage alone. Also used bulk italian sausage (combo hot and sweet).

This recipe is fabulous! Had to make it without the liver and dried fruit due to some picky eaters but everyone loved the stuffing. I also substituted hot italian sausage for sweet which really added great flavour. Several guests even requested the recipe. I definitely recommend it!!

I added the liver and thought that it enhanced the flavor of the stuffing. I think that instead of currants next time I will use dried cranberries. maybe dried cherries -- the currants seemed to get lost. Very good recipe.

This was the best stuffing ever. I made it exactly as read. Like posters below, I might leave out the livers next time, even though I really could not taste them. I agree that it could use a little more sage. The currents were a good foil to the other flavors.

We left out the chicken livers, but changed nothing else. This was a great recipe; everybody raved about it. Hardly any leftover, which is different from previous years.

This recipe is delicious. I have been looking for a good stuffing recipe for years and I have finally found it. I made this recipe just as it is.

Made this as the stuffing for this years Thanksgiving. My only changes were no added liver and no currants. (My kids would not have touched this with the currants or liver) It was easy enough to make and the taste was good however next time I would add a bit more sage and some apples.
