Excellent! Just left out the onions since we aren't fans of them.

This was so very tasty! For those of you looking for a better option for a crust,i found one at Whole Foods called Rustic Old World Crust(organic).I also used a combination of oyster,shitake and baby bella mushrooms.I will add some thinly sliced Romas next time.

I used the 8" Boboli thin crust and baked the piza on a metal pizza plate (the one with all the holes int he bottom) Whether it was all the liquid in the spinach or the pan, my crust was very soggy and I didn't like that part. The topping is good though I'd perhaps add something with a little salt in it next time - like feta or Greek olives.

This is great! I have made it several times! Very tasty! I substituted feta and mozzarella for the goat cheese. I also substituted sundried tomatos for the roasted red peppers. I felt this gave it a little more of a kick! One of my new favorite dishes!

A great blend of flavours with the bell peppers, red onions and goat cheese. I dislike pre-made pizza bases, so used the recipe from epi's Pizza Bianca with Goat Cheese and Greens. Superb! Everyone loved this pizza.

This was very pretty. I would have given it 3 forks ("delicious")if the crust had not been a Boboli. It was very easy to make.

Made (2) of these for a party last night and there was nothing left. I have to say I love how simple and quick it is to make,and the goat cheese and other toppings are a great combo.

This pizza is delicious but was slightly dry. The next time make it I would add fresh sliced tomatoes and than it could become a 4 fork recipe. It was visually appealing.

This is a deliciouus and elegant pizza. I prepared this for an annual cookoff party (this year's theme was pizza) and I won first place amoung 15 or entrants. A great recipe....I wouldn't change a thing.

This pizza was phenomenal! I used yellow peppers because that was what I had. My meat eating boyfriend put salami on his half and he loved it.

This dish was great! The only thing I changed was the amount of spinach, because after I saw the amount I was to use, I couldn't imagine having that much of anyhting on a pizza. I halved the amount of spinach to about 1.5 or 2 cups, and it came out great!

I didn't have basil or muchrooms and it was still delicious. I'm sure the addition of these things would only improve the pizza. A nice sauteed portobello wouldn't hurt.

This was just delicious. The store was out of fresh basil, so we used dried basil and added some dried oregano as well. I will definitely be making this again.

This is an excellent and quick weeknight dinner, and is perfect for my vegetarian sister. I used a flatbreat seasoned with garlic for extra flavour and it turned out wonderfully. Great recipe!

We loved this pizza, it is very healthy and tasty. I halved the recipe and used a mini boboli (5 ounce) and used portabella mushrooms, cut into cubes. fresh basil is a must, and the roasted red peppers add great flavor. i will definitely make this again - and serve it with a good wine to enhance the flavors.

Yummy, had to make a few changes like no mushrooms because I didn't have any; half canola oil because I ran out of olive; and I happened to have feta cheese instead of goat. Also I didn't measure anything and it smelled like an all-garlic pizza! I used a Boboli whole wheat crust and added some fresh chopped tomatoes. Pretty healthy-tasting and satisfying stuff, first time I made a pizza without tomato sauce. I thought it would be strange but we all enjoyed it.

The only thing I leave out when I make this is the mushrooms (I'm not a fan of them). It's a delicious, easy, and surprisingly healthy meal. It always turns out great!

I made this as written and brought it to an outdoor potluck where it was very well recieved. It's easy, healthy and delicious. I wish I knew of another pre-made pizza crust other than Boboli. I think their product is tough and pretty flavorless. Next time, the only change I'll make is using a homemade crust, though I like the ease of the premade.

I made this for a holiday party and have been getting requests since. It is delicious and fairly easy to make. Using the pillsbury pizza dough, I modified the recipe slightly by adding a thin layer of mozzerella and a sprinkling of parmesean and romano cheese to the top.

This is my new favorite easy-late-night-meal recipe! I keep a stock of frozen crusts on standby (gluten-free ones from Whole Foods) and use mozz and freshly grated parm when I'm too cheap to buy goat cheese. The parm gives it a nice "zing". Also, this is fab with portobello mushrooms. More substance.

I made this using goat cheese and didn't care for it. I didn't think the flavors melded together. I like all the ingredients, and what a healthy meal but if I make it again I will try it with a different cheese.

Made this exactly as written ans was quite pleasantly surprised - the flavors were delicious together and very refreshing and warming at the same time. Had this with an Australian chardonnay and it was a great chilly weekend afternoon light lunch! Definitely a keeper.

YUM!! This was so good and so so easy. I will make this often. It's really easy to adapt this recipe and add anything you might want in addition to or in place of the other ingredients.

Found this recipe back in September and have made it at least 5 times. Very simple and delicious. Wasn't sure the first time with all the spinach, but was pleasantly surprised.

Wonderful! This pizza comes together quickly and easily, and tastes soooo good. I used Greek manrouhi (sp) cheese that I picked up from a local Whole Foods; the cheese is sort of a cross between goat cheese and feta. It lent an awesome flavor. A keeper.

I came home from a trip and threw this together for my boyfriend and me. It was incredibly good. I wasn't sure how the uncooked spinach and mushrooms would turn out, but everything cooked and melded together beautifully. This is a real keeper.

Simple. Time saving. Another good way to use a pre-cooked pizza crust. Hubby liked it and he is a meat lover. I will certainly make it again because of the simplicity and fresh ingredients. However, I am not so thrilled that I would "crave" this dish.

I made this pizza for myself and my husband over the weekend. I followed the recipe to the letter and thought it was phenomenal! The best part is, my husband loves spinach, so this will definitely be on our dining room table again!

I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted mozzerella cheese for the goat. I made four different pizzas for my friends and this one was voted as a tie for first. Very easy and delicious!

Great, easy recipe. Unlike the previous reviewer, I used all the spinach and feta, but just brushed the pizza crust with 1 tablespoon of the oil mixed with the garlic. I also don't like mushrooms, so substituted halved cherry tomatoes. It was wonderful.

A very tasty pizza, especially if you are as much of a goat cheese lover as we are. We bought the same size pizza crust as suggested in the recipe, but only used 2 cups of spinach, which seemed to be the right amount. As it happens, we also only used 4 oz of goat cheese, but that also seemed to be *quite* enough. We used all of the oil suggested, but found the result to be pretty greasy. If we do it again, we'll sprinkle less on top.
