Fabulous. Made according to the recipe other than used blueberries and only used two cups (purchased four, but thought it was too much when it came time to assemble). This is thinner than a mousse (more like a silky pudding) but was delightfully light! I was able to serve 10 and served in antique champagne glasses (about 2/3 cup per glass). Sad to see such a great recipe has only had 11 reviews since 2001. This will be a regular on my entertaining menu!

This is majorly delicious and impressive. I did exactly as recipe states and served it in martini glasses, I put a tiny blob of whipped cream on top of the sauce and then added a little mint sprig. Divine!

This dessert is fantastic and very easy. I used raspberries and it came out wonderful! I cooked the egg yolk mixture about 5 minutes.

The presentation was nice but it seemed a bit bland. My niece loved it.. so I will make it again and maybe try a different berry.

I've made this twice and it was scrumptious, I'll make it again.

It was pretty, but not much of a return for the effort.

This tasty dessert was a perfect ending to a ladies luncheon I catered today. Used raspberries instead of blackberries. Seemed as if egg yolk mixture needed to heat longer than 3 minutes though.

I got confused between the folding, whippng, dividing but maybe it was too much going on as I prepped for for our Christmas dinner. Wound up mixing the whipped cream and the chocolate together which, duh, wouldn't whip. Threw it out and started over again. Looked really nice in my grandmother's gold rimmed goblets but one fell out on the floor when I opened the fridge door. Bah humbug. Nevertheless, it was excellent albeit pricey and I will make it again.

a little too "alcoholic" for my taste, but my guests enjoyed it.

This was TO DIE FOR!@!@!Having never made it before I was a little dubious but it was incredible. I'm definitely going to add it to my repetoire, so to speak. I did take the advice of the second reviewer and whipped/beat the cream to within an inch of its life! The consistency couldn't have been better. I doubled the recipe, served it in a trifle bowl, layering the blackberries and topped it all with white chocolate curls. A beautiful presentation if I have to say so myself.

I have made this dessert for two dinner parties and on each occasion my guests raved about it. I used Cointreau instead of Grand Marnier, and, on the second occasion, I used blueberries rather than blackberries. I thought the blueberries were better. This is a great dish, and one I will definitely use again and again.

This was a good dish but it didn't come out as thick as it should have. Everyone who had it at my dinner party loved it despite the consistancy. Next time I will beat the egg whites longer and hope for a thicker consistancy.
