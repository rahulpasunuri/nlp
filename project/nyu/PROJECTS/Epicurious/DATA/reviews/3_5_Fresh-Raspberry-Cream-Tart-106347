this recipe came together in a snap. I like to bake with my 9 year old daughter, and this recipe was perfect. She loves anything with an Italian ingredient and this was easy to follow and the measurements were large enough for a child to handle. We skipped the orange peel and almond extract. Came out perfectly!

An excellent, easy to follow recipe. It really fell together just like the recipe says, which is not always my experience! It was well-received and a special treat.

It was okay. Not exactly a classic tarte tart- more creamy, hence the name. This tart should be called almond tart with raspberries, because the raspberries seem more minor than the recipe lets on. The cream has a almond taste similar to marzipan, which is good for marzipan but no so good for the tart. The taste was bizzaire.

This was very good - everyone gobbled it up! I made it with strawberries since I had a lot in the house; however, next time I would make it with raspberries, as the recipe indicates. As you would expect, the strawberries were a bit too large and more naturally firm than raspberries. Since the dough was very soft when I mixed it together, I also refrigerated it for 5 minutes to firm up before I put it in the tart pan. I do recommend this recipe!

Great Recipe, very easy and fast to do. I used 8 ounces of cream cheese and I used the graham crumbs. I used 1 1/4 cup. It is also a very refreshing dessert.

I followed this recipe exactly- I want to think. The crust and filling both had weird textures. The crust was crumbly and the filling felt frothy in the hatch. It looks better than it 'feels' in your mouth and the flavor is good. Of course, I'm one of those freaks who can't stand the texture of an avocado. I'm sure I'm confusing you all. The other Cooks seemed to really enjoy this one- confirmation that I'm just a weird-O.

We made this tart filling for thanksgiving (we made a chocolate pastry from another recipe). It was not 'to die for' but it was better than bearable. The family LOVED it-but can you trust them? The orange zest was a bit overpowering for the raspberry lover (on the go). However, we do have a lovely suggestion for topping the tart: if you want to go the extra mile, we suggest that you dip raspberries into dark and milk chocolate. Now this is not for the faint at heart. In fact, Sur La Table sales associates insisted it was not possible, but we were able to handle it. We suggest adding kiwis to compliment the chocolate- covered raspberries. In sum, the presentation got an A+, the chocolate pastry got a B+, and finally, the filling got a C (but with our suggested improvements could receive a A-).

What a delicious, seemingly light, dessert. I topped my with a spoonful of whipped cream and a sprig of mint for presentation. The combination of the rich marscapone and the tangy raspberries entertains the tongue. Wash it down with some champagne and you would almost want to serve it as your entree. I would make a suggestion to avoid the tart pan and use a springform pan for easy serving.

This was delicious and v. easy to make. I too had trouble cutting and serving it, though, so it didn't look as pretty when I dished it out - the crust crumbled too much. Ah well.

I served this to guests and they loved it, even their little boy. The crust is similar to a shortbread and therefore should definitely be pressed into the pan, not rolled. I did find the pie slightly heavy, yet delicious anyway! I will make it again and will try strawberries.

If you have to refrigerate the crust, it turns into a brick! The cream filling is too soft and gushy. The flavor was good, it just was a texture disaster.

I made this for a dinner party last weekend and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe to a "T" and it turned out fabulous with a beautiful presentation and was pretty simple to prepare. I agree with the reviewer who thought the crust was a little heavy - I'd say thick but all-in-all a big hit.

I made this over the weekend! Besides having to go to an Italian market to get the cheese, it was really easy! My crust was a little crumbly but it was awesome. I have requests to make another one asap. I used blueberries instead of raspberries. I also didn't use preserves but 8oz of canned blueberries (drained). The cheese itself is delightful, I'll have to try it with other desserts.

My book club groaned over this. I substituted blackberries/blueberries and lemon peel for the specified ingredients. Unlike others, I appreciated the crust's slight bite, apparently brought on by the cornstarch. Next time I will likely return to my standard short crust, however, because this was too brittle for cutting and so made presentation "iffy". Still -- a definite keeper.

This was pretty good, but not great. The large amount of cornstarch in the crust gave it a strange texture. Also, there was too much almond extract.

Delicious!!! Very summery: the zest makes the dish. Easy and simple. Worked out fine the way described in the recipe. I got rave reviews last night!!! I will definetely do this again!

I made this tart for a wedding shower last weekend, and what'a hit! I agree, the crust is tough to handle, but DO NOT try to roll it out! There is way too much butter and not enough flour to hold it together..it was very gummy. So, I followed the recipe and pieced it together with my fingers in the pan. It worked perfectly. I garnished it with sprigs of mint in the center of a large berry and around the edges. A truely delicous tart and not too difficult to make!

This tart was wonderful the two times I've made it. I used seedless black raspberry jam, and wow--perfection. If you're in a real hurry, you can use a prepared shortbread or graham-cracker crust, but the tart shell recipe given is top-notch.

fanastic!!! I made it for Father's Day to great Dad's. The only thing I did different is whip cream seperate from the mascapone, then folded in. from a previous review. Great!!!

I had some difficulty getting the dough for the crust evenly into the pie plate and then pushing the sides up after it was in the oven. The spoon didn't work and using fingers on hot butter is not a lot of fun. But it tasted great and my guests loved it. I think next time I'll use a rolling pin and roll out the dough to fit the plate.

Flavor was Ok, but I have to say I had a very hard time taking the tart out of the pan, so it practically crumbled and the presentation wasn't the best. I used lots of butter in the pan, so why did this happen? Also, the filling was good, but it really never set (is this supposed to set, or is this more like a cream?).

This was my first tart - made for a bridal shower. The crust is very easy to make, and very flavorful due to the zest. I followed past advice and beat the cream separately and then folded it into the rest of the filling. This seemed to work great-- the filling set perfectly.

Outstanding! I have made this twice to rave reviews. After reading everyone's comments, I whipped the cream and then added the mascarpone and other ingredients - worked fabulously. This dessert goes in my top five.

I think the filing and the berries are divine. I wasn't too thrilled with the crust. I found it very heavy, where as I would prefer a lighter flakier crust.

Awesome and EASY dessert...perfect for the spring and summer. I live in a rural area and Mascarpone is not readily available so I substituted cream cheese and it was equally delicious. Even tried it with the low-fat variety and couldn't tell the difference as there were so many flavors. I used an assortment of fruit--blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, kiwis--while still using the raspberry jam on the crust, and it made a beautiful presentation. The almond extract really sets the taste. Raves from around the table and requests for more!!

My 9 year old and I made this tart. He did most of the work. Easy, quick, excellent results. Used frozen raspberries and no almond extract. Will definitely be on our short list for potluck desserts this summer !

I am not a big fruit tart fan- usually looks better than it tastes. THIS WAS FABULOUS !!! It was much easier to make than I thought. I left the almond extract out because I'm not an almond fan. The orange zest made the desert. I am catering my friends wedding in June and this is on the menu !!!!

Any substitutes for the mascarpone? Although I love it, I live in small town and it is not available. Just like the 'Asian Style Dressing' of oriental salad controversy! Perhaps try this with, creme anglaise or a yogurt filling. Let you know.

I made this for our Easter dinner and it was enthusiastically received by all the guests. I had read on the site that someone felt the almond extract was too intense for the raspberries, so I was careful to use a scant measurement for all of the extracts, and I did not feel that it was too much. It was quick and easy to make. I did have to use a spring form pan, as I didn't have a tart pan, but I had no difficulty removing it from the pan. I made it the night before.

This is a delicious spring recipe. I made it for Easter and it was enjoyed by everyone. My filling was not runny at all; in fact I was worried it would be too dry. It must be the consistency of the mascarpone. Definitely add the orange zest to the crust; the taste comes through beautifully.

I don't generally eat, let alone prepare desserts. And I especially don't like making pastry. WELL, this was a hit, and I enjoyed a slice! It was easy to make, and unlike other chefs reviews, I beat all the filling ingredients together for 2 mins. exactly. Perhaps for the cooks who had runny filling -- I purchased the mascarpone cheese (imported from Italy) from my grocery store, and when I opened the container, found the cheese to be very firm and smooth. I did not have a tart pan, so I used a Pyrex pie dish, and it was DELUXE. Fresh berries are a must, and I enjoyed reading the other reviews with your variations in berries.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! My Easter guests loved it! A COUPLE NOTES on the dough for the crust: I had to make the crust twice. (Completely my mistake, it was my first tart.) So, I will let you know what I learned. The "large clumps" form almost immediately after adding the flour & the flour should be added all at once. Do NOT pass on the crust, the orange in the crust is a wonderful complement to the orange in the filling. As for the reviewer with the filling problem, I just kept everything chilled and added it to my Kitchen Aid as directed. It could NOT have been any simpler. The taste and the compliments were well worth the cost of the dish! Enjoy!

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I heard a tip on the Food network this weekend regarding whipped cream. Tip: Melt one large marshmallow in the microwave for 10 seconds. Add this mixture to your whipping cream. Whip cream as usual. This supposedly makes your cream whip easily, and the cream will stay firm for a very long time.

After reading the reviews, I felt compelled to add a comment about the instructions in the recipe. Of the reviews I read about 90% of the respondents had a problem with a runny filling. I was shocked, myself, when I read, "add Italian cheese (mascarpone), cream, sugar and other filling ingredients, mix together, and pour into prepared crust." I can't imagine that combination, in that order, ever gelling. I would suggest for your readers and chefs that the cream and sugar be beaten together until firm, then fold in the mascarpone, gently, and other filling ingredients (my mind has drawn a blank and I don't remember if there are other ingredient combinations or other filling ingredients to be mixed in), but if there are, they should be folded in now. The filling will be firm before it begins to set, which will allow for a firmer more secure presentation when serving. Adding all those filling ingredients together and then mixing will allow much more chance for failure. Cream is not as delicate as many other whipped foods. Once it is whipped, it holds its form. Folding the other ingredients in will not change the consistency, once the cream is firm. I hope this helps those chefs who had such a terrible time getting the tart to set. l_dinardo@hotmail.com

Very good, the second time I made this I sprinkled a few mini chocolate chips over the warm jam and spread them around. The slight addition of chocolate was very nice. As to the annoying ads, unfortunately, they are the price of this "free" website.

Made this for Easter dinner & it was a hit. Couldn't get fresh rasberries without taking out a mortgage so I used frozen blackberries, rasberries & blueberries for the topping. (Thaw with a sprinkle of suger to keep berries plump.)Everyone loved the tang of the grated orange peel in the crust & filling. RE comments on mixing the filling: I whipped everying but the cream until it was light & then added the cream & beat agin until light & fluffy. Worked fine!

This is such a great recipe - Easy to make and a wonderful presentation. I did omit the almond extract and doubled the vanilla. I did not have a problem with the filling - I let it beat for longer than 2 minutes and it held its firmness. It got rave reviews.

Simple yet delicious tart. Great crust. The flavour of my raspberries was not up to par, so that impacted the overall sensation. For the chef whose mascarpone mix turned to butter: I mixed the cream ingredients together first - MINUS the whipping cream - until well blended and soft, then added the cream and beat for about 30 seconds to one minute. Will definitely make again with better raspberries.

I made this yesterday for today's Easter feast. The crust turned out well but the filling is just so-so. While waiting for the crust to bake, I prepared the filling and put it in the fridge until the crust cooled. By the time I filled the pie, the filling had become runny. It needed to be rewhipped (yes, you can do that) to give it more body. It's definitely edible, but I won't make it again.

Decided to make this for Easter due to the favorable reviews, and thanks for the tip about the spring form pan. Am in the process of making and so far delicious. Went to check recipe and noticed to my shock that the rating dropped to 80%. To the "cook" who gave it one fork, I believe the mixture was beaten for too long. Presentation is going to be lovely. Plan to glaze top with a little seedless preserve and garnish with fresh mint.

This is a very frustrating recipe. I followed it e*x*a*c*t*l*y and the mascarpone/cream mixure turned to lumps of butter! I was able to salvage it (I hope) by whipping more cream *alone* and then adding the "mascarpone butter". It's very soupy, but tastes okay and will hopefully firm-up when chilled... My Easter guests will be the judges...ugh...

This was very tasty and lovely to look at - it would be perfect for a summer dinner party/cook out dessert. I didn't bother making the crust - I just used a pre-made graham cracker pie crust which made it a very easy dish to prepare. My only change would be to lessen the amount of almond extract - it was a little too much for my taste and it overwhelmed the raspberries.
