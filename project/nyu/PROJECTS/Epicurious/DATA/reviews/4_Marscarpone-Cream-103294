I added vanilla and layered this with sugared sliced strawberries. I added a layer of lady fingers too. So good. So easy...looks lovely. Perfect do ahead summer dessert.

Very easy and very yummy. I made it to pipe into strawberries and figs for the 4th of July. Big hit with the crowd. I might try flavoring with a hint of extract but definitely good the way it's written.

Excellent topping for fruit crisp, fruit pies, pound cakes. The possibilities are endless. I served mine with about 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Delish!!!

So easy and so good. I used half the sugar and used confectioners instead of granulated. Then I folded in chopped fresh strawberries. Couldn't have been easier.

Big Yum. Added vanilla and served over mascerated strawberries. A big hit after a tuscan dinner.

This was absolutely delicious! It got stiff within about 15 seconds of beating, however, and I barely saved it from becoming butter. I had to add about 1 cup of milk to thin it (or more) plus I added juice of 1/2 lemon and lemon zest, which tasted wonderful. People just raved!!

Delicious and easy. A great alternative to whipped cream on my chocolate torte.

I made the marscarpone cream as a filling for a Christmas Panettone. I added more vanilla than called for as well as vanilla paste (sold at Trader Joes) which tinted the mixture a light tan color and infused it with flecks of vanilla bean. It is really wonderful! I'm chilling it and assembling the cake later at the party. I whipped the cream first then added the sugar and vanillas and finally the cheese. Will definitely make this one again.

I love this, especially with a fruit sauce on top. Kids like it, too so it's a good, elegant all-round dessert!

Yum! I filled chocolate dessert shells with the cream and topped with berries and chocolate. I used "superfine" sugar and this really made it very creamy!
