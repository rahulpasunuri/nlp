The pie crust worked well for me. I made the gingersnap crust recipe as written and baked it in a pie plate. I used 4 Tbls. butter as noted and only a light film to butter the pan. I pressed the crust down with the bottom of a measuring cup before baking. The crust did not shrink. Afraid it might slide down the sides after baking, I lightly pressed the crust again with the bottom of a metal measuring cup after removing from the oven, though I'm not sure this was necessary. I haven't eaten the pie so am reluctant to give it four stars at this time.

I have no problem with the ingredient ratio, but I never butter my pie plate first. There is enough butter in the recipe itself. I use a 9" deep-dish Le Crueset pie plate and the crust never sticks.

WAY too much butter, I had to sop it up with a towel. Very disappointed with this crust.

What a HUGE bummer! Cooked a gingersnap crust, doubled the recipe for a 9" deep dish AND added more cookies than called for to make up for the obviously too much butter. Crust melted and shrank to the bottom of the pie pan and sides crumbled over. Disappointing and a huge inconvenience the day before Thanksgiving...

It was fine with the pumpkin cheescake pie, but it did take time to soften up enought to not be emarrassing to eat.

I doubled recipe to make a larger cheesecake. I used a very large springform pan and doubled the crumb crust recipe also. The butter melted, ran out the bottom of the pan, filled the bottom of the oven with melted butter which burned and smoked requiring me to clean the oven. During the time the cake was in the oven baking the house filled with smoke and set off the detectors. When looking at the recipe and checking it with other crumb crusts I have made, I believe the butter amount was too much.
