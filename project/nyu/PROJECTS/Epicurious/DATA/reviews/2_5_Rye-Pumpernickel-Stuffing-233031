This was a perfect new version of stuffing for my Thanksgiving feast. If you love rye and/or pumpernickel bread, try this recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving last month and it was great. I couldn't find the marbled bread, so substitued dark rye and crusty white bread for the cubes. I also did throw in some ground sage at the end. It just didn't seem right to make bread stuffing without sage. I mostly chose this recipe because I had turnips in the house, and I was surprised how much I liked the turnips in it. Other people mentioned earthiness, which I think is a good description. I could not stop eating this stuffing - yum. I did stuff it right in the turkey, so it did not dry out, and what was left I heated up in a covered casserole.

To correct the chicken recipe typo ...classic blasted chicken...not balsted...sorry!!!

I have to admit, the combination of flavors and the texture would be the reason to make this again. This dish has a rustic flavor. The combination of the slightly bitter turnip with the robust texture of the marble rye truly complimented each other. I would not make this for a potluck or for a family thanksgiving, but just for us to have, because we enjoyed how different it tasted from the traditional. Many ingredients can be added to this to enhance the flavor, but I chose to follow the recipe and see what the possibilites would be after that. Will make it again. I cooked it right along with a chicken following Sara Moulton's classic balsted chicken recipe from the food network.

Although the bolder taste of the pumpernickel bread was good, it still tasted too bland. I added sauteed mushrooms, thyme and sage. In addition, I felt that the 450 degree temp sounded too high (perhaps that is why others found it to be dry). I baked it at 375 degrees.

I couldn't find the marble rye (and I live in San Francisco!) so I used a sourdough rye and it turned out ok. Not my favorite recipe but it didn't suck.

I feel like this recipe is missing moisutre, it was way too dry, could have used at least another 3 cups of broth. Would probably be ok with more moisture.
