A recipe I instantly committed to memory--ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!! I used a cherry-chocolate coffee bean from the bulk coffee section, and 1 TBSP each heavy whipping cream and whole milk instead of actual "half & half". Thankfully made a double batch the first go-around so there was enough to share with friends. . . I've been getting requests daily for more ever since!!
