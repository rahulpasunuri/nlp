It was a bit of effort to make for pretty normal french toast. I didn't make the streusel topping because it was just too much sugar. Should have done as other people suggested - grease the baking sheet. My french toast was stuck and needed to be scraped off! A decent recipe but next time I'll just make it in the pan.

Initially I was worried that the streusel topping would be too sweet, but no need to worry, came out great (used natural maple syrup). Also, since I was using what I had on hand, I didn't stuff the bsnanas in the bread. And nxt time I would only coat 1 side of toast with almonds - a bit too much otherwise. Overall delicous, quick & easy.

This was a big hit at Sunday brunch - most took 1/2 a piece it was so "big" - I only put the almonds on one side, I did add the extra egg, it baked up beautifully. Relatively easy to do, just a bunch of steps. Will definitely make this again, and again.

Flavor idea is a good one. Caramelized bananas stuffed in a pocket of bread soaked in egg batter and baked served with maple syrup. I added an extra banana when I realized the suggested amount was a bit conservative. The egg mixture was VERY generous. I thought the almonds would stick to the batter dipped bread but they do not. They have to be placed under the bread slices and sprinkled on top. The streusel was unnecessary to our tastes. The almonds was enough texture and the topping does not adhere anyway. I would make again w/ out the streusel and reduce the egg batter by 1/3.

I made this for brunch and everyone loved it. I used raisin-cinnamon bread. I also increased the banana filling as other reviewers suggested. Next time will make a couple changes - fewer eggs and less milk needed. Also, I had trouble making the pockets without tearing the bread so think I will use thinner slices, dip one side in egg mixture; then in almonds and put filling between 2 slices, attach with toothpicks then bake. This way seems easier to me and the filling can be more evenly distributed. This recipe will be used over the holidays for sure!! Impressive and decadent!!

I just made this for Father's day brunch. Everyone asked for the recipe. I used sourdough bread. I liked the almond crunch which was different. I agree we needed to double the banana filliing. I added some rum and vanilla to the bananas and the eggs for an extra flavor kick. It did take awhile to make, but not difficult, and if the bananas and almonds are done ahead, not much different than regular french toast. The streusel didn't do much for me, but I think I will add some cinnamon/sugar sprinkled over top next time. Butter the baking sheet! Also because of the size of the pockets, I think 1/2 piece is enough per portion! It's filling!

This recipe was great! I loved the caramelized bananas.I used challah bread instead of egg and served the bannanas on top instead of stuffed to save time. Next time, I won't encrust both sides with almonds because it stuck to the baking sheet (or maybe I'll grease the baking sheet with cooking spray). I also served with warm maple syrup. Definitely a dish I'll make again!

A great, decadent breakfast or brunch. I agree with other reviewers, it could have used more banana filling. My only complaint is that this was pretty time consuming for breakfast prep work and my planned breakfast turned into an early brunch. But worth the wait, or so said my kids.

Made this for a brunch and thought it was DELICIOUS! Got lots of rave reviews. I doubled the banana filling and added fresh blueberries too to break up the flavor. Wonderful combination. I also dipped the Challah in the egg mixture BEFORE adding the filling- couldn't see how I could transfer it if I added the filling first. Definately spray the baking pan first. As for the dry oatmeal topping, I made it ahead of time, sprinkled it on top right before baking and drizzled melted butter on top to make it brown. Very easy and sooo good. I am not usually a fan of French Toast but loved this recipe.

I made this dish as a "Happy New Year Brunch" dish and it was DELICIOUS!!! Have decided to make this a new year tradition. Even our 2 year old loved...

Great brunch dish. Very filling, so don't over prepare. If my guest knew how easy this was, they surly would not have raved the way they did.

Delicious, if extremely rich (most people ate only half a slice so I had way too much.) I omitted the almonds.

This is an excellent dish for company -- easy to make once you've tried it once, and looks & tastes impressive! I've had great reviews when served. Your guests need to have a bit of a sweet tooth though!

4 forks if you love french toast, which I do. Omitted the streusel topping and no one missed it. Used challah loaves with great results.

it was fabulous. I really liked it and i love french toast i have it like every morning and i had to make it for my family of 6 and they liked it.

It was great but I fudged the recipe a bit. I always keep sliced frozen banana in the freezer for smoothies so I used those instead. Once the banana had thawed, I added this to the melted butter without the sugar and water. I also didn't put sugar in the egg mixture or make the streusel topping and I used ciabatta bread. Maybe it's not the same recipe but it was still great stuffed french toast.

Wow! What more can I say? This recipe was phenomenal. It was rich and decadent, but definitely worth the extra trips to the gym. I made my own bread for the recipe using the Golden Brioche recipe from the February 2003 issue. The little loaves were perfect for stuffing. Also, the banana stuffing portion of the recipe has become a staple in my kitchen. It is wonderful to sweeten oatmeal, for example. I will definitley make this again.

This is an awesome dish, more like a desert. I omitted the almonds, doubled the vanilla, and cooked it for a total of 32 minutes to crisp it up a bit. You should bake it on parchment paper if you want any chance of it releasing from the pan.

Yum Yum. I played around, and made a couple with small slices of milk chocolate in the middle with the bananas. To die for. No left overs!

I made this several weeks ago, and I can still taste the melt-in-your mouth flavors. My children of course, couldn't get enough! It was indeed very rich, and my husband and I barely finished our slices. I may have sliced the bread too thick, because I had to bake it much longer (about double the time suggested) before it started to firm up and feel "baked" (when the suggested baking time came and went, the bread was still quite soggy feeling...not a texture I prefer). I think next time I will lightly spray my cooking sheet with oil or use a non-stick sheet, because they stuck and were tricky to get off without shredding. I made everything exactly as written, and altough it was tricky to assemble (slicing the pocket and stuffing the bread..it wanted to fall apart with every movement), I look forward to having it again. It's a show-stopper in presentation and taste!

This was fabulous. I made it for a crowd (9 people) along with the other suggested menu items (Orange Blossom Oranges and Sausage) and it was quite a nice meal and presentation.

Very good. I made this as more of a layered, rather than constructed, dish, since I was doubling the recipe and making other dishes for a New Year's Day brunch I threw for 24 people. I used toasted chopped pecans rather than almonds, but otherwise didn't change anything. Mine was more like a bread pudding than a French toast, but is a delightful dish.

I love this recipe, but for those who think it's too sweet, I have a suggestion. I transformed the recipe into what I call "Baked Elvis" by spreading a little peanut butter in the pocket of bread before stuffing it with banana. Don't knock it 'til you've tried it!

This recipe was delightful! My children and I just gobbled it up ("too sweet" said my husband, yet he ate every bite). I can't wait to try this for Easter brunch! I used left-over french bread with great results. Highly recommended, but it is sweet and rich.

This was impressive for overnight guests, but definitely too sweet. (The women tended to like the sweetness more than the men.) I'd make it again, but leave out some of the sugar in the banana filling. It would be even more impressive with thick challah slices instead of the thin baguette I ended up using. It wasn't as much trouble as some claimed.

As a company brunch dish this was impressive. However, for the amount of work involved in preparation, I felt the fruit was overwhelmed by so much bread. I used fresh peaches. Next time I will make the size of each piece somewhat smaller.

A very good recipe! We didn't double the bananas as one review suggested, and we thought the french toast was sufficiently banana-ed. We substituted a pizano loaf for the egg loaf, and we enjoyed the results. Definitely will make again!

Great recipe! I made it for a Mother's Day brunch and it was a big hit. I substituted Semmifreddi's Cinnamon Toast Bread with wonderful results. Especially loved the streusel topping.

This was a fantastic recipe! I used fresh strawberries, instead of bananas, the second time I made it and preferred the strawberries. I've also tried it with different breads: a cornmeal brioche and a vanilla challah. Both worked very well.

We enjoyed this dish a lot .. much more than just the standard french toast you might make in a fry pan - the almonds and struesel topping really made it different. I agree with some of the others who say the bananas filling needs to be doubled - otherwise, you'll surely run out! And although we enjoyed the bananas, we thought this also might be tasty with a different fruit filling - pre-cooked apples or blueberry pie filling might be some suggestions. It felt like there was *a lot* of prep that went into it, but it was definitely worth it in the end. We'll most likely make this again .. definitely when we have overnight guests .. it was a great way to start the day! But be prepared .. whoa!, its filling!

I tried this recipe under difficult conditions. It was a family weekend outing and I had Sunday brunch in a weekend cabin oven. I made it the night before, let it sit in the pan overnight in the refrigerator, baked it to be ready at 8:30 AM, kept it warm in a 200 oven and when the last teenager finally staggered in for breakfast at 11 AM, it was still good! Everyone gave it an A plus from the toddlers through to Grandma. I used the egg bread and found it easy to prepare. My only mistake was forgetting to bring the flour for the streusel, but it worked out without it. I had no problems with soggy almonds, myself. I heartily recommend it!

Those of you who loved this recipe must love bananas and to work a lot harder than the taste allows. According to the ones who loved this recipe, I doubled the banana part- but when it was done it was very bland-not sweet enough and very banany. The streusel didn't do any thing for it and we wasted our money on the almonds because they got soggy. My vote is DON'T BOTHER-find something easier and better tasting for your time.

Excellent. The banana stuffing needs to be doubled, but once that was done, it was great!!! I've already made this 3 times and every time was a hit!!!

EXCELLENT - the only improvement would be more bananas. I could not find unsliced egg bread so I made do with potato rolls and it still tasted wonderful.

You definitely need the almonds on the side sitting on the pan, or there is a serious sticking problem. I cut in the butter a little too much on the strusel topping and it got creamy. I'll know better for next time! Took this for a company breakfast - they asked for the recipe.

This french toast was absolutely delicious! It worked well for a large group since it was baked. I subsituted french bread, and because this french toast is so rich, the size of the slices was just about right.

Excellent French toast ! I cut the recipe in half, but used the full amount of banana. Also, no challah was available, so I substituted an Italian loaf. Once baked, the crust became pleasingly crisp; a perfect counterpoint to the creamy soft inner bread. The streusel topping is enough to put you in sugar shock ! I served it on a pool of warm maple syrup, dusted with 10X, and garnished with a grape cluster and strawberry. Freezes OK. An elegant breakfast for guests or your family... or just for you.
