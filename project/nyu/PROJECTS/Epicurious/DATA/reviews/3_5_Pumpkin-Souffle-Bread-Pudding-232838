Recipe steps are not well written. Not a souffle-like at all, but very dense.

Outstanding dessert. It serves at least 6 people, rather than the 4 indicated.

This dish was a smash. Took the previous poster's advice using challah and cayenne. Baked it in a 9 in souffle dish for approx 1 hr and it was divine.

this gets requests over and over. it's the first thing gobbled up at thanksgiving and the first recipe people ask for. instead of brioche, i use challah and i leave the crusts on. i also like to add a dash of cayenne for an extra bite. but this is one of my absolute favorite things to make!!

To get into the spirit of Halloween, I made this delicious dessert for my family last night. Even my brother, who claims to dislike the flavor of pumpkin, ate an entire serving and was craving for more. I added 2 tablespoons more sugar than the recipe called for and about 1/4 teaspoon of ground clove and 1/8 of ground ginger. The flavor was very nice and rich, but I'll add more sugar, nutmeg, clove and ginger next time. Definitely a fall dessert...lovely and light!

This turned out to be much better than I expected. It was delicious, light, moist, attractive and will defn. make again. However, in two different areas, it says to add sugar, but I had already added all the sugar during the first time it says to. It didn't seem to effect the outcome, but it confused me.

This is just fabulous! I made it in individual souffle dishes for Thanksgiving, and followed New Orleans' tip by making whipped cream with rum. The proportions can be adjusted a lot; I used double the pumpkin, condensed milk, more brown sugar, added ground ginger (it made a really nice warm aftertaste, just don't overdo it!) and nutmeg, etc. If your creative, use the recipe as a general guideline. I used stale Italian bread with crusts on, and it was perfect, not too tough at all. I did use more liquid, though. This is not a souffle, and shouldn't have the word in the title. I don't know why the previous cooks' "fell", though. We ate perfect leftovers for days.

This is amazing...made 1 1/2 recipes and baked it in a 9x13 pan. It's just great and doesn't need anymore than a little whipped cream. Thanks

I don't understand how a souffle can be made in advance. The dish (served in both ramequins and a 13x9 pan, since I doubled the recipe for 8 people) came out beautiful from the oven, like a souffle, but fell during the two hours before dinner. I would make this again, but double the sugar and add more cinammon and spices. I added extra sugar this time and it wasn't enough. And I would prepare everything in advance and pop the dish in the oven while the starter course is being served.

It was perfect! I made this recipe times one and a half for a 9 x 13 pan. I would lower the baking temp only slightly and cook a little longer to ensure doneness in the middle. We're originally from New Orleans, and there's no way we can serve a bread pudding without a fabulous sauce to top it off, so I used a cup of heavy cream, warmed just enough to gently melt about a half-cup of white chocolate morsels (more for the texture than the flavor!) and added 1/3 cup bourbon to create a Bourbon Cream sauce. Poured over lightly it accents the flavors in a delightful manner! Quite decadent--you'll be the star of the evening at any dinner you take this to. It makes ahead well, sits in the fridge until you're ready to pop it into the oven and take along in a beautiful casserole dish. You can't go wrong--not too sweet, not too heavy--just perfect!
