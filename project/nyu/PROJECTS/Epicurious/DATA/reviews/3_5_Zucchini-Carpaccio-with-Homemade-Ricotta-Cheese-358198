I'm not sure how homemade ricotta would make this any better, but this dish is delicious! I used store bought ricotta and followed the suggestions of other reviewers and I couldn't love this any more. A great way to use up zucchini that seems to just multiply in the garden.

I bought fresh ricotta at the Italian grocery store near my house and served this dish at my house warming party. It was delicious, beautiful, and healthy and I got tons of compliments. People couldn't believe how easy it had been to make.

Enjoyed this dish very much. I used a knife to slice and while more time consuming, perfectly doable. Serving @ room temperature on an Easter Feast buffet.

This was a beautiful, delicious and fresh tasting salad. I used the 1mm slicing disk of my Cuisinart so the zucchini was almost translucent because it was so thin. Also tossed the zucchini with the dressing beforehand and let it sit for a few hours. The homemade ricotta was extrememly easy to make . . . who knew?? !!

I really enjoyed this dish and actually followed the recipe (I never ever do). My husband though who loves zuchinni didn't care for it. He felt the same os some others who prefer it cooked. It's fresh and a nice alternative. Definently let it set up though- it needs the time to come together.

Made this for a 4th of July picnic and used what I had on hand - garlic scapes and scallions, fresh mozzarella instead of ricotta, and seasoned them well. Let them sit in the marinade while I was transporting them - delicious! A great summer dish.

this is so delicious! i've made it twice now for dinner parties and everyone loves it. i think it's really important to slice the zucchini as thin as possible and to use fresh ricotta. if your ingredients are good this recipe shines.

kind of gross. zucchini is much better cooked, here it is just a watery, tasteless vehicle for homemade ricotta (which is really good).

Made the dish according to the recipe but only used one zucchini as more would have been way too much. Everyone liked the flavors and as I am always seeking Zucchini recipes, I believe that this is a keeper.

I loved this and made it just as directed. BUT, I felt like the zucchini sliced paper-thin was a LOT. I did find that the dressing coated evenly when I tipped the dish a few times and then let it sit for a half hour before serving. Also, I used the reciped from Gourmet on Epicurious for Homemade Ricotta - use it all the time and it is amazing. That makes the dish. This was very well-recieved at a buffet (once everyone realized it wasn't cucumbers!) and will absolutely be a new staple.

Agree with the cook from Redondo Beach. I think it might be a better idea to toss the zucchini with the lemon and olive oil first, to evenly coat the zucchini, and then display on a platter...otherwise the flavor is very inconsistent.

This was kinda blah. I had to add extra lemon juice, garlic salt and thyme to get some flavor any flavor.

My husband and I really liked this-- I've made it twice in two weeks. I used a good quality ricotta from Whole Foods, and sliced the squash with the 2mm blade on my food processor. Although that isn't "paper thin," it was great for ease of preparation. This dish looks really beautiful, too!

Thought this recipe was very good. I used a mandolin for both the zucchini and the onion and it worked out well. I also used cilantro as a substitute for the basil and it worked well as well. I didnt bother making my own ricotta (who has the time) and found that a local riccota brand worked just as well.
