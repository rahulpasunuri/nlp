A BIG FAT ZERO!

Use hot sesame oil instead of vegetable oil - replaces that "something missing". Great basic dish if you do this. Also - use a cheap cut of meat.

This is not "Chinese" in any way. I ought to know since I cook CHINESE in New Yorks China Town East (Flushing, NY). Take this "recipe" off your "to do" list and you won't be sorry.

Unfortunately, there was no rating lower than "just so-so", because this recipe was a COMPLETE failure. Doesn't anyone taste and test these recipes prior to their inclusion to this gourmet site??? I know my Chinese food well, and in spite the addition of numerous spices as well as a hefty dose of Chinese 5-spice powder, this dish was beyond redemption. I was really annoyed at the waste my time and ingredients!

Wouldn't this be kind of a waste of beef tenderloin?

You might give this to your kids as a learn-to-cook recipe, but there is no other reason for it to be listed

This was quick and easy but not that great. * Mary Laurie*
