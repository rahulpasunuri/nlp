I had a lot of trouble with the crust from this recipe and the caramel took much longer to make than it suggested. The texture of the pie was amazingly smooth, but I think the flavor was lacking for the effort necessary for this particular pie... I think a more straight forward, simple version of pumpkin pie would be sufficient next time.

I had no issue with the crust. No issue with the caramel. Mixed the filling with no changes to the recipe. Texture, great! Taste, not good at all! It tasted off and bitter. We had Apple pie, Flan and this pie, everyone tried it, not one person liked it. A whole pie in the trash!

What am I doing wrong! Try as iI might I cannot get this crust right. I am an experienced baker but this crust shrinks so much that I cannot get it to retain it's shape and it shrinks down to half the height. I chlll the dough, don'tstretch it, etc and yet it always shrinks. Solutions?

I just adore this recipe! I make it every holiday season. This recipe errs on the side of being less sweet, so I add more sugar to the whipped cream for a nice balance. It's also a fabulous custard you can bake in individual ramekin.

oh- and I added salt to taste to the filling before I mixed in the cream.

Fabulous! I followed reviews advice and didn't pre-bake the pie shell, and adjusted down the ginger and up the nutmeg & cloves. The filling was a great texture and the crust was perfect. I got a 2" fluted pan just for this recipe at Sur La Table and it was worth it.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed, including my own crust. It was a bit labor intensive. I made the crust one day and the rest of the pie the next. The caramel sauce was not nearly as difficult as I expected it to be. I was delighted with the caramel accents and so were my guests. Served it with simple whipped cream with vanilla and sugar. I will definitely make this again.

I have to say, I'm a big fan of this pie. I can see where the negative reviews might come from, but I'd say most of them are coming from people who have never made a caramel or a pie crust from scratch. I would definitely not recommend using this recipe as your first time making caramel or crust, especially with something as temperamental as a caramel. The Achilles Heel of even the most seasoned pastry chef! That being said, I felt it was worth the effort. Followed some review and added 1/3 a cup of brown sugar. I actually didn't make the crust (no time), but next time I will. My biggest regret was using a store bought.

This really was a delicious pie, mine came out a deep dark color, very pretty, actually! I used a different pie crust recipe, but otherwise followed directions to a tee. Silky texture to the pie that everyone loved!

Oh and I also baked this in a standard pie dish, and did not have any of the special equipment the recipe called for. It wasn't an issue at all. I had a little extra dough and filling since the quiche dish is bigger, but I just used a muffin pan and baked a few mini-pies as testers.

I was a little scared to make this for thanksgiving because some of the reviews said it could be tricky, esp. the caramel and I had never made a pie before. But it was not: I followed the recipe and it turned out amazing. The caramel flavor was subtle, but it brought the whole pie together. Best pumpkin pie I've ever had, and it was a huge success with everyone else.

Rating: 2
Hit or miss. The first year I made this recipe, it came out wonderful. The filling was a soft, silky texture with a wonderful hint of caramel. Absolutely fantastic! I decided to make it again this year, but the pie turned out just average. This year, I had a difficult time getting the caramel to a deep golden brown color so rather than letting it burn, I decided to add the cream early. The pumpkin filling was off too. There was no smooth, creamy texture, just a typical course pumpkin pie taste. If the pie wasn't so delicious the first time I made it, I wouldn't attempt this recipe again.

As the description says, this pie has a sensuous richness and an amazing lightness that you just don't get with your standard pumpkin pie. I have been using the James Beard recipe for years and this is so much better. If you are expecting a pronounced caramel taste, you may be disappointed. But if you want something that get rids of the "vegetably" texture and taste of the standard pumpkin pie, this is IT! For those who said it tastes burned...yep, you overdid the caramel. Just for the purpose of commenting here, I timed the sugar from boil to the right degree of deep gold and, for me, it was about 5 minutes. Not a second more. Terribly time consuming? Not at all. One tiny additional step from the standard pumpkin pie. The pie dough handles like a dream!!!

This review is for the filling only. It's totally worth the time! I was skeptical about the work of making the caramel, but it was totally worth it. The texture and finish is so wonderful. If you've never cooked sugar before, be careful not to burn the sugar; it turns dark quickly once it starts to caramelize and you want it a medium brown. My differences in preparation were that I used roasted fresh pumpkin puree and tripled the recipe to make a bunch of pies. I didn't feel like making crusts, so I bought them. Because this recipe makes a deeper dish pie that the typical 9inch pre-made pie crust, you could make two pies per batch of the recipe. My tripled recipe made 4 pies+ a bunch of extra (another pie or two worth) that I just baked custard-style.

Rating: 2
This recipe from start to finish takes forever. The pastry (which took the bulk of the time) was flaky, delicate and just so slightly buttery and I would use it again. The filling, however, wasn't really worth the extra effort. Maybe it's because I'm at altitude, but I just couldn't get the sugar/water mixture to turn deep brown and the caramel flavour didn't come through. Also, the filling tasted slightly egg-y. Too bad - most other reviewers were so happy with the recipe!

Rating: 4
Tasted great. Next time I will carmelize the sugar even more to get more flavor. I just let it get golden-colored.

Rating: 2
I made a different pie crust, so my review is only for the filling, but I don't think this filling is worth the extra time or effort. If I hadn't told my guests this was something "special," they would not have known. This took me two attempts ... making a caramel/candy whatever it is is a lot trickier than this recipe makes it sound. It's not impossible, but it takes more direction than this recipe gives. It is very easy to burn the carmel part, and then you'll need to start over. But, I don't think it's worth the extra effort in the end, even though this was a tasty pie. I'm not sure about the crust, but I used a standard pate brise, and it was excellent with this. I also baked it in a standard tart pan, to give it a nice presentation, which looked pretty. I had extra filling, which I put into ramekins. Also tasty, but not worth the extra effort of carmelizing the sugar.

Rating: 1
The filling tasted burnt to me, my husband couldn't even eat his. This was terrible, threw out the whole thing. I can't see how this recipe got such good reviews. Maybe they let the carmel get to a light brown instead of the dark the recipe calls for. I however don't inted to find out. I won't make this again. There is plenty of great pumpkin pie recipes out there. Thankfully I made another pie and this saved Thanksgiving dinner! It was the spiced pumpkin pie with rum. Now...that's a winner.

Made this for Thanksgiving turned out GREAT...I add 1/4 cup of brown sugar to mix...I would bump that to a 1/3 next time.....I also used 1 1/8" x 11 tort pan and it worked great..BTW I think its was better out of the Refer the next day...flavors seemed more balanced chilled

The filling was wonderfully creamy with just enough spices to really bring out the pumpkin flavor. The caramel is what takes this pie to another level. The flavor is very subtle, as other reviewers have noted, but adds that extra bit of complexity to the pie. As a firm believer in all-butter crusts, this crust was perfect! I used a 2" tall molded tart pan (of Alton Brown apple pie fame), but found that the crust shrank a little during pre-baking, which left me with extra filling. I ended up baking a separate smaller pie that was perfect for taste- testing without digging into the real pie. Some of my guests didn't seem enjoy it as much, but I think it was because it wasn't the usual overly- spiced and super sweet pumpkin pie filling in a pre-baked crust. I will be making this for Thanksgiving for years to come.

I love pumpkin pie and have made many variations over the years. This was definitely a favorite. It was very close to the traditional recipe but with an enhanced flavor. And the crust came out great. I used a food processor. I've heard that you can easily process dough too much so don't go to the point of the dough actually sticking together and forming a ball within the processor. I used a regular pie plate and used only half the filling so I figure you could get two pies out of the filling and it was still very good. I'm always a little nervous with caramel and freaked a bit when I poured the cream into the hot caramel. It turns into a big clump of hardened caramel but it melts gradually.

Rating: 4
I cannot believe that anyone would think this recipe was awful! (Although I think this recipe is not good for those who have little experience with making caramel or caramelizing sugar.) I have made this recipe for 4 years in a row with constant rave reviews, even from self-professed pumpkin pie haters. Obviously, if this recipe did not come out great, it really is not the recipe's fault. It is the fault of the cook/baker. Sorry, but that's the truth. I'm a pastry chef and baker for a living, so I know. Even the best chefs in the world really can't bake. So if you claim you are an excellent cook, it really has no bearing on how you bake. They are indeed two separate things.

Rating: 4
This was amazing and will be on the table this Thanksgiving. Subtle caramel flavor, the crust is like a tasty shortbread perfectly complementing the sweet filling. I have never liked pumpkin pie but this is amazing. I used the tart pan I had which was maybe an inch deep so I as well had leftover filling but I'm going to bake it in some smaller tart pans without the crust, like a creme brulee.

Rating: 4
This is THE recipe for pumpkin pie. I agree with others that the caramel notes are subtle- but that's the excellent thing about it. If you want more caramel flavor, just make more in the beginning. I didn't boil the caramel as long as the recipe stated as it seemed to reach that deep gold much earlier than expected and it still turned out well, although I ended up with a little extra filling.

Rating: 3
I would like to give this 3.5 forks, but that isn't an option. I split this recipe in half and made two smaller custards, sans crust, to test the recipe. One I made as directed (just half the size) and the other I made with about 2TB bourbon added to the caramel before adding the cream. I tried the actual bourbon pumpkin pie recipe on this site, but didn't like how raw and boozy the flavor was. I thought that by adding the bourbon to the hot caramel, it would reduce down quickly. Also good (Woodbridge) bourbon has caramel notes in it, so it seemed like a good pairing. The recipe did work with the bourbon addition, and would probably work the same way with any other alcohol you care to experiment with (Amaretto and Scotch come to mind). I did like it better than the recipe where it was just added in with everything else and baked. In the end though, we preferred the cleaner caramel notes of the recipe as written, so this is what I will be making for Thanksgiving this year. I also really appreciate seeing a recipe scaled for a deep 10" pan. I always bake holiday pies in deep 10" pans and I can't be the only one. It's irritating that big magazines with dedicated test kitchens don't include 10" recipes more often, especially for holiday offerings when a 10" pie makes a lot of sense. It is a little silly for them to specify a 2" deep quiche dish--can those really be more common than 10" pie pans?--but I suspect the proportions will work out.

Same reviewer again...I forgot to say that I used just a regular pie pan and it came out great...but did have lots of leftover filling. No need to buy a special pan unless you want to.

Everyone at Thanksgiving just loved this pie, said it was the best pumpkin pie they had ever had. It did have a very light fluffy texture which was nice, less dense than traditional pumpkin pie. I felt like it was a lot more work to make than traditional pumpkin pie. I did not taste a strong caramel flavor and was slightly disappointed because I thought caramel and pumpkin flavors would go great together. I did not pre-bake my pie shell (have had too many bad experiences with shrinking crusts!) and it turned out beautifully.

Funny-- everyone raves about the crust but actually the filling was what I thought I was really good. My crust came out very chewy and took FOREVER to make. Admittedly, this was my first pumpkin pie. For all first timers out there, there is a video that demos how to make the crust-- I watched it after the fact of course, but I think I have the hang of it now.

delicious recipe, I think I found the holiday pumpkin pie for my holiday dinners! I made a small change and put the pie in a tart pan which decreased the amount of crust and made for smaller slices which is nice after such a large thanksgiving meal. I used the left over pie filling and made mini custards

Excellent pie! I didn't have a fluted tart pan that was deep enough, so I used a spring form pan instead, which worked just fine. I also followed one of the other reviewer's suggestion and added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the filling. It turned out beautiful and delicious! I'll definitely keep this recipe around!

Good gracious, that's a delicious pie crust. I mean, the pie as a whole was great, but that crust.... I don't know right offhand what was different from my usual recipe (maybe a little more butter?) but it was among the flakiest I've made, and I'm a professional baker. As for the filling (to which I added a 1/4c brown sugar for a little extra sweetness -- good decision), I didn't get a lot of the caramel coming through. But it was by no means bitter, as some previous reviewers said. And knowing it was there I could detect subtle caramel hints... just nothing that really screamed CARAMEL! Next time I think I might try putting a small layer on the bottom in addition to mixing it into the filling.

I used fresh pumpkin and this pie was light and not too sweet. I did read a few reviews prior to making it and added two tablespoons of additional sugar and slightly more spices than the recipe called for. I made this on three different occasions during the Thanksgiving holiday. If you like desserts really sweet, adding fresh whipped cream will do the trick.

The pumpkin part of the pie was delicious, light fluffy texture, not too sweet, spiced well. The crust took a lot longer to achieve "golden" in my oven than specified, and the butter taste was overwhelming (is that even possible?) so the pastry was not my favorite.

Well, I followed the following suggestions: 1) Not blind baking the crust, 2) changing the ratio of cinnamon:ginger. I also added 2 tsp vanila. I have to say, it was a great pumpking pie. Without the need to blind bake, the crust was very easy to work with and it didn't take very long. I like to roast my own sugar pumpkins, so this was probably the most arduous step in the process. As is typical, we had an inordinate amount of desserts (apple pie, apple tart, rice pudding, pumpkin ice cream pie, & pumpkin cheesecake) and this was the only thing to completely go!!

I agree. This was a fabulous recipe and a step above a standard pumpkin pie. I didn't have a deep quiche so I used a large flat tart pan and it was perfect. I also used rice (don't have pie weights) and that work fine as well. I won't make pumpkin pie any other way from now on.

All those people saying the caramel was wrong or the pie had an off taste are nuts.

I have made this recipe three years in a row (even though it says 2006 it was in an earlier mag.) and my family loves it. While making the caramel is a little more intensive than most recipes it makes the pie that much better. Also I haven't ever used a tart pan, a simple pie plate is sufficient.

My family & Ioved this pie. The only problem for me was locating a 2" deep tart/quiche pan. I finally did locate one at either cooking.com or chefscatalog.com. There were no issues with the caramel. All went smooth & the pie baked beautifully. I am planning on making it for a family gathering again in a couple weeks... menu planned, this one's in!

I hesitated to make this because of the bad reviews, but I'm glad I did. It was delicious: light, creamy and flavorful. The caramel was a wonderful undertone, and the spices were just right. I did have some shrinkage of the crust, though--either I have to buy more pie weights, or I'll try the cook from Charlottesville's idea and not pre-bake the crust. My pre-baked ones always shrink as well, and I have a ton of pie weights. :) As far as the caramel being "off," mine was perfect. I don't think the problem was with the amount of water called for in the recipe, as the water will just boil off anyway. I think it had to do with the darkness of the caramelized sugar--the darker the color the more bitter the caramel. I've been working with caramel for years, and I still have my disasters, but one thing I did do to help was buy a copper pan, which is heavy and heats evenly. My caramel was uniform in color and tasted nice and sweet. The other thing I did was made sure I watched the caramelizing stage like a hawk. With just a moment of inattention, the whole thing can go south pretty quickly. I hope this helps others try this pie, as I think it is definitely worth the time and effort.

Add me to those surprised by the negative reviews. I made the pie as is apart from baking it in a 10-inch glass pie plate instead of a quiche pan. I also didn't bother with the pre-baking of the crust; I've never had one that didn't shrink in the process. Everyone enjoyed it and no one thought anything was "off." One person especially liked the fact that it wasn't too sweet.

I tried the pie again and was much happier this time. I reduced the ginger to 1/2 tsp. and increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp. I also added 2 tbsp. brown sugar to the filling. It had a wonderful flavor and a very pleasant light texture. The crust was also delicious and it was a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner! I'll definitely do this one again.

I too am surprised by the poor reviews. This was very good. Maybe it was too light in texture for traditional pie lovers, but it was a big hit at our Thanksgiving. Adjusted the seasoning a bit, but all was great, including the crust, which we placed in a 10" deep dish glass pie plate. Would definately make again!

I'm surprised at all the low ratings for this pie, which was one of the highlights of my Thanksgiving table. Everyone, especially those who aren't usually pumpkin pie fans, praised the light texture and delicate flavors. The deep tart pan was indeed VERY hard to find. I finally found it at kitchenworksinc.com. The crust was gorgeously flakey -- I'm glad I didn't have to resort to a regular pie pan, since judging from other reviews here, it seemed to make a difference. I'll definitely make this one again. Several of the other Nov 2006 recipes were winners, too, especially the cranberry-apple-walnut conserve!

I belive I may have found the problem with the "off" flavor to this recipe. While reading one of my culinary textbooks, I realized that the caramel sauce recipe is off. A basic recipe has 1 C sugar to 1/4 C water (if that much). I tasted the caramel before adding it, and it was not a sweet caramel (the culprit for the bitter off flavor). I also used only 1/4 tsp. of ginger and added about 1/4 C brown sugar (to offset the bad caramel) Hope this works for others!

I had to comment to offset all the bad reviews. I tested this pie out before Thanksgiving, and will definitely make it again. I didn't have the pan they called for so I just used a deep-dish glass pie plate. The crust sort of wilted, but then I'm not very experienced with pie crust making. But the filling was delicious. I used fresh pumpkin. Maybe that made a difference. But I don't know what the rest of you did wrong. :p

This pie was disappointing. The crust and texture were fine, but the filling had an off taste. The caramel tasted fine on it's own so I'm still trying to figure out if it needs more sugar overall or possiblly less ginger. I plan to attempt it again with some variations in the filling because it makes a very nice large pie.

I was very disappointed with this pie. The crust was fine and I expected the filling to be great, but it was just off. The texture was good and it smelled great while baking but it was just missing something. I don't like overly sweet pumpkin pies and I thought it may need more sugar though I realized after comparing to other recipes that the amount of ginger is rather high. My husband thought it was "bitter". I like the idea of a large pie so I only have to make 1 for Thanksgiving, so I may try it again and adjust the spices and add a little brown sugar to the filling. I would recommend tasting and adjusting the filling before baking.

To cook in Las Vegas: I work as a pastry chef in a restaurant and always use fresh pumpkin (or substitue butternut squash). It's easy to do, but takes a little time. Cut the pumpkin or squash in half, and scoop out the seeds. Sprinkle with a little salt and roast until soft. Scoop out the soft, roasted flesh and tie in cheesecloth. Let hang overnight in the refrigerator with a bowl underneath. Use equal amounts of roasted pumpkin as pumpkin puree listed in the recipe.

I prepared this pie just as the recipe stated; no substitutions or additions. The caramel dominated the other flavors. The recipe called for very small amounts of ground cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger, so the pie was very bland as a result. The texture was light and fluffy, but that isn't enough to induce me to cook this recipe again.
