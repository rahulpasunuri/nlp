I have been frying eggs this way for 50 years, PERFECT.

There might be four forks because the staff of epi found the recipe to be deemed as such. Chances are they wouldn't have added this recipe to the index if they didn't feel it worthy of some attention. I wanna try it, just to see what it does. Who knows, may have found a near perfect egg.

why does this have 4 forks when no one has rated it. I haven't made it - too weird of a way to make....duh, fried eggs. There should not be any forks assigned to this until it is actually rated people who have tried the recipe. Personally, I wouldn't bother and don't know why it's even listed. Although the Frend Oefs Au Plat ("eggs on a plate") makes it sound interesting - it really isn't!
