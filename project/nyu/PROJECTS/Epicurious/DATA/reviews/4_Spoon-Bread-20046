This is the way my mother used to make spoon bread. It's been a hit with my family and guests, I wouldn't change a thing.

Easy to do, could be a little undercooked, I over cooked at 40 min and it was a little dry the first time. Everyone I had served it to has asked me for the recipe and I copy one from here.

My family liked this recipe. I am going to try a few variations that I think my family will enjoy, also I would like to try a couple more eggs in the recipe to see if lighter is better. I think it is one of those recipes that you can have fun with and consider as a great compfort food. great family fare and not that complicated to prepare.
