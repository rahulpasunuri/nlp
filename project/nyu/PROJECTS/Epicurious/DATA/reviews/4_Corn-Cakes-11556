I make these and take them to work with some healthy homemade soup or chili. They're helping me to lose weight. I replace the butter with canola oil. I used regular corn meal the first time (all I had), and since then I've used the stone ground. I really prefer the regular. Next time I'll try without the cheese. Always delicious, whether I follow the recipe faithfully or not.

These were great. I made some minor substitutions, set out a platter of toppings(avocado, chopped bacon,shredded cheddar, etc), and they made a tasty and fast dinner.

I've made this twice now. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe said. It was a bit bland, but better when smothered with honey. The second time I added some chopped rosemary and Mexican chorizo, and also cooked the cakes in the chorizo oil. They turned out absolutely amazing. I highly recommend!

I followed this recipe almost to the letter, using canned corn instead of frozen, and using raw red pepper instead of roasted. These cakes were easy to make and more flavorful and interesting than I expected. These went really well with BBQ and braised mustard greens. I hate buying buttermilk because I can never find something to do with the leftover. Next time I might try using regular milk with a splash of cider vinegar thrown in.

Truly excellent. I used fresh corn and some chopped chipotles (from one of those cans where they are packed in adobo sauce. Served it with salsa verde. Great.

Making these smaller made for great appetizers along with salsa & sour cream. They went like hot cakes! :)

This recipe was really good. I didn't use any of the "add ins" like corn or onion but could imagine that they would only add to an already great base. The cakes cooked up pretty fluffy, like pancakes. I think that I was looking for a thinner batter (somewhat of a cross between a pancake and thin crepe). For that, I think the batter could be thinned out a bit with more buttermilk (or water). Really easy and definitely recommended!

I omitted the jalapeno and red pepper, and put in five strips of chopped bacon. Fried them in the bacon grease instead of butter. Delicious, absolutely hit the spot!

Made it for a late Sunday morning breakfast with a side of honey butter and some smoked sausage. Wow, I loved it. I substituted the butter with vegetable oil and don't think the recipe suffered for it at all. Also, substituted half the onions with equal amount of carmelized onions for more flavor. Yumms.

Excellent recipe! Very quick and easy to make. We had them as a side dish with Black Bean Chili, which was a nice change of pace from the usual cornbread. I can't wait to make them again with some of the other serving suggestions here!

Made this as a base for Christmas Morning Eggs "Benny". It was great,the batter keeps well for a few days- as I've found out with the leftovers-made "tostadas" with it. I used 1% buttermilk and ommited the hot peppers.

We thought these were great. We used frozen roasted corn, and frozen roasted red peppers, both from Trader Joes. I sauteed the onions and jalapeno a little before adding them to the batter, and we used cheddar rather than jack cheese because that's what we had on hand. Thought these were a great accompaniment to our "cincinnati" chili. The kids really loved them, too.

doubled the recipe....cooked up half and put other half in freezer last night. Husband and 2 teenage sons gobbled up every speck on their plates. Boys up early to hit the beach and when i went down to kitchen to start the day, the griddle was in the sink and the reserve of batter had disappeared from the freezer. The vulchers did manage to leave a note for me that said..."You Rock Mom" and "Corn Pancakes Rock too"!!! Its a rare morning b4 they leave to go surfing that they'll want to take time for breakfast of any sort!!! I'm relieved they have found something besides left over cold pizza that is deemed worthy enough for them to want on any given morning!... These cakes are better than great... follow the recipe without substitution and you won't/can't go wrong!!!

Excellent recipe. Full of flavor. I used fresh uncooked corn since it's in season.

I wanted a different side dish to serve with a grilled flank steak and these corn cakes filled the bill. Easy to make and very good. Both of my daughters made a point of telling me that they liked them and what makes that amazing is that one of them hates anything with cheese in it -- she did not detect the cheese at all. They were not greasy; I fried them on a griddle and used maybe a tablespoon of oil to fry batches of 5 at a time. They kept very well in an oven at low heat. I do recommend the jalapeno, which makes them very tasty and compliments the sweetness of the corn.

We made it without the hot peppers since we didn`t have them on hand. The recipe was really delicious. We were looking for a mazareppa recipe but this was so good we plan on using this instead. We use it to compliment fish. Excellent fare.

My guests enjoyed this recipe quite a lot -- although they were unsure of what the ingredients were. There's absolutely no hint of the cheese. In terms of the cooking process, they absorbed a great deal of oil and tasted pretty oily immediately after cooking. However, I froze them and reheated (350; about 10 mins. on each side) and they were great.
