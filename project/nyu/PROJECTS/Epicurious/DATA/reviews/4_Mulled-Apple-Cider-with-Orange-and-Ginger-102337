I made this for a friends wedding outdoor fall wedding, it was amazing. I love all the flavors but I added some vanilla extract and it did big things.

I made this for an Autumn Harvest Open House party tonight and it was a hit. So delicious and really easy to make in a slow cooker vs. the stove. A few hours before party time, I put all the ingredients in and turned to high; when the cider was hot, I switched to the warm setting. It was perfect. I doubled the recipe and it came out great. Served dark rum on the side for those adults wanting an extra kick. Can't wait to make it again for the holidays. Highly recommend!

I can't drink apple cider any other way now!!! ...And wouldn't change a thing about it (except to make more)!

Absolutely marvelous! Even better for a holiday/seasonal party. Put it all (multiples) in a large Coffee Urn. The Percolation process warms and steeps everything, keeps all at just the right temperature throughout the day or evening. (Did this for the office. Nothing gets people in the mood like this smell.)

This is the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. After a long day of sledding and bunny-tracking, it is the perfect way to curl up and snuggle in. As I write this, I am drinking this exceptional cider and already planning to make more as soon as I'm done with this cup.

This is a nice recipe, and adding 2 cups of cranberry juice makes it a great one. I agree that adding more spices (or letting it simmer longer) improves the flavor.

This is just a wonderful cider. We make it every year starting at Thanksgiving and through the rest of the Holidays. Everyone raves about it.

This was a delicious addition to our annual Thanksgiving Brunch. The flavors were terrific and the aroma scented my whole house. A great way to kick off the holiday weekend.

Hadn't made mulled cider in years but really liked this recipe. The fresh ginger makes it. I warmed the cider in a crockpot and it only got better over time.

After the first batch, I started doubling the spices, then adjusting. I now use at least 4 times most spices, depending on what I have around the house. Yum.

This is a very easy, tasty, and aromatic drink. It's a hit.

This is a handy recipe to have for the holidays, but I added lots of extra cinnamon and cloves for more spice. Next time I think I'd add even more ginger, as well. But overall, good and yummy. (I used regular old apple cider, from the grocery store.)

This was delicious and easy, what more can you ask for? My only problem was I couldn't find unpasteurized apple cider, why does it have to be unpasteurized?

Mulled cider doesn't get this easy. The taste is wonderful but it can become satiating. Great for parties!

This is an easy and VERY delicious recipe. It made my whole house smell wonderful. I wish I had made more...my pot emptied quickly.
