I made the baked casserole version from the cookbook and couldn't even eat it, it was so bad.

I made the Sephardic version (the following review).

I made the Pumpkin Patties. I thought they were really good. Autumn is the perfect time of year to make pumpkin recipes and the spices in this were just right. Good with a meal or make for breakfast and drizzle a little honey on them. Fantastic treat!

Just so-so is being generous. No where worth the effort nor the cleanup. I made the fried version. I used my own pumpkin mash which I was very careful to keep as dry as possible when preparing. My wife handed me the recipe and I neglected to look at the reviews. She also handed me the bulghur. It was kernels. Not ground at all. Fine probably means like flour. Something that would soak in warm water for 30 minutes and soften. Mine, I almost had to boil and soak for an hour and it was still chewy. Then while mixing in the processor I had to add large amounts of flour. It lost any spicyness it might have had and I overdid it on the spices. I dispensed with making patties with floured hands because it was still too loose and I didn't want to add any more flour. I used to spoon to drop it into the oil. 2 minutes a side? Hah? Try 5? I kept the oil bubbling and I kept the patties as thin as possible so they'd cook. More healthful than American Pancakes? How? Because there's a little pumpkin and ground up bulghur. Give me a break! Another specious claim by an author. Its fried flour. Get over it. I can cook my pancakes in an iron griddle with a 1/4 tbs of butter to season the griddle. BTW. They were made palatable by dollops of yogurt. I won't be making these again and I'll certainly check the reviews next time.

I made the baked variation and it was bland, under cooked and boring. 45 minutes was not long enough, but I didn't know until I took a serving. Or maybe it should have been mushy, it doesn't say. Frying it might have been better, but the flavor of the underbaked one was tasteless.

We made this with a baked cinderella pumpkin, a short-wide reddish pumpkin varietal that's on the sweeter side. A little extra added cumin balanced things out nicely for us.
