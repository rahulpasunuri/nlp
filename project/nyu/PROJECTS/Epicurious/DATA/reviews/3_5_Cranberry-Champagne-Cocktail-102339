I agree with LucyCanCook, there is a better recipe on this site called "Cosmopolitan Champagne Cocktail" -- if you do a net search for it, it's the first result, on Epicurious.

This was a very easy, tasty and festive cocktail. Just served this at a holiday party. Served in a champagne flute with 2 to 3 frozen cranberries as a garnish. Guests enjoyed!

There was a similar recipe that Epicurious used to have, which is no longer on the site for some reason --- try this variation: 1 1/4 c. Cointreau or Grand Marnier 1 1/4 c. Cranberry Juice 1/2 c. + 2 TBL fresh lime juice 3 TBL. superfine granulated sugar 4 c. chilled Champagne or other sparkling wine Stir together Cointreau, juices, and sugar. Chill, covered, 2 - 6 hours. Just before serving, divide among 10 flutes and top off with Champagne. Makes 10. Is absolutely divine. Amazing!

Delicious and really refreshing! Served yesterday for Valentine's day with a lobster appetizer and my hubby loved them! The flavors are subtle and not too sweet, like kieroyals can be sometimes. I also added an orange twist, which I would highly recommend.

So yummy! I made this with Cristalino Cava (inexpensive yet highly rated sparkling wine) and it was absolutely delicious - a huge hit with everyone on Thanksgiving.

This was a big hit. I used it as a cocktail before Christmas dinner for 18 people and again for a tea for 20 women and it was hugely popular both times. Festive, pretty, easy and yummy. I added a tad more Grand Marnier to my own glass and thought it made it even better.

Very light and not to sweet. Added a bit more Grand Marnier for those who liked it sweeter.

Perfect for pre-Thanksgiving cocktail. Just the right touch of cranberry, not too heavy or sweet. The bubbles make this extra festive for the holidays!!

A very refreshing drink, and not as "heavy" as a mimosa. I substituted amaretto for grand marnier and liked the combination equally.

A nice alternative to standard mimosas particularly if you prefer something less sweet. My husband, however, prefers mimosas.

Great alternative to mimosas! Perfect for the holidays.

This has been a holiday favorite for several years now. Simple yet very festive!

I made this for a cocktail party and it was a huge hit, particularly with the women at the party. We had to keep running out for more champagne because it was popular! Don't go overboard on the Grand Marnier: 3 tablespoons should be sufficient.

Boring. It needed a little kick or spark. It might have been good with a splash of lime juice, but I'm not going to bother making it again just to try that.

Beautiful and tasty! This cocktail was a tremendous hit and went well with the parmesan crab canapes & scallop puff appetizers. I put the champagne cocktail in a pitcher filled with cranberry icecubes. Place a small orange or lemon slice in each ice tray and fill with cranberry juice. This gives the cocktail a splash of surprise. Enjoy!
