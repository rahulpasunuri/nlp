My family loved this !! The only thing I did to make it as a main dish is I added cream,corn starch to thicken it and added some linguine noodles ....followed by chibatta bread....perfection

We really liked this recipe! The sauce is delicious, as promised. I shelled the shrimp prior to sauteing out of deference to persnickety family members, and it turned out fine. I also found that the dish held quite comfortably - in other words it doesn't need to be hot-hot-hot to be good. I paired this with a caesar salad, and enjoyed the echo of lemon and worcestershire between the dressing and the shrimp sauce.

I give this 3 forks as the recipe is written, but I think with modification it can move to 4. The only challenge is the spice level. I increased the cayene pepper to over a tsp and added a pinch red pepper flakes as well and people still thought it needed more zip...and that's from Minnesotas if that tells you it needs more spice! I think I'll try the tabasco recommendation. Other than the spice factor people really enjoyed it.

I did this recipe with the following tweeks which I recommend. Follow the recipe through the "saute shrimp" step. At that point remove the shrimp to prevent over cooking. Deglaze the pan with a small amount of white wine, reduce until slightly thickened and then incorporate the additional butter. It won't take as much butter as the recipe calls for to achieve sauce consistency.

Excellent as-is; I doubled just to increase sopping sauce for bread. Yum.

This is a fabulous dish. Have had it at Mr. B's in New Orleans and made it several times at home. It's luscious, rich and messy.

Awesome... really messy ..but really, really good! Ladies.. make this for the guys one nite..sure to please!! Have tons of crusty bread and napkins at the table and lots of ice cold beer!! This is almost the same recipe as the "BBQ Shrimp Appetizer" at Cafe Nola on South Street in Philly (RIP).. although Cafe Nola closed in the early Ninties.. the spirit lives on in this Recipe! Might want to consider adjusting the amount of lemon juice depening on your tastes!

I made this for a Fat Tuesday celebration just as the recipe called for except for switching out some of the butter for olive oil. What a hit!! I served over rice with french bread for dipping and it disappeared. Super simple and super delicious!

Very good. I added a bit of Turmeric as well. Loved the color and flavor. Shelled the shrimp. Makes a great Po Boy or you can have over rice or pasta.

Loved this! Made as directed except added about 1/4 Stella (which I was drinking at the moment). Next time, would use peeled shrimp. Perfect after a day of gardening and errands; easy peasy and satisfying and goooood......oh, served with artisan sourdough baguette. Yum. Sandra McNally Calgary/Panama/Edmonton

One of my favorite recipes from Epicurious. It never fails to please a crowd. Love the spice and make sure you have bread to soak up all the buttery sauce!

Rating: 4
Yum! This is so easy and delicious. I used less butter and some white wine and it was great. I think that 5 tablespoons is more than enough butter or else its oily. And I love my butter. For a main dish for 2 people, buy 1lb of shrimp, or buy more and have some leftovers! I peeled and deveined the shrimp but left the tails on. Served over rice with crusty bread and corn on the cob.

This is easy and excellent! I reduced the amount of butter but replaced it with some olive oil for dipping... The dipping was as good or better than the shrimp. I even impressed my wife on this one!

very delicious and easy to make recipe - I used half the butter and had the same taste results as the full amount - lots of calories - so think before making this for a dinner of weight conscious girls though (as I did!).

Rating: 2
I haven't had a four fork recipe fail me yet, but I have to say I was disappointed in this one. Followed reviewers' suggestions to add only about half of the butter, to increase the cayenne, and to use peeled shrimp, but the flavor just wasn't very exciting, and it was still way too rich/oily. One positive is that it couldn't be any quicker and easier to make. (I know it's a completely different flavor direction, but we LOVE the Epicurious "Spicy Sichuan-Style Shrimp" recipe - it's a regular for us!)

This was great. I changed the recipe to reduce the butter but think it would be great as written. I added a ton of cayenne (we like it hot!) and I cut the butter in half and added dry vermouth in it's place to make sure we had a good amount of sauce.

Rating: 4
To the cook below - you can choose to peel or not peel the shrimp beforehand to suit your preference. My favorite thing to do is leave only the tails intact; that way everyone can use their fingers in the more casual way the recipe suggests but without all the mess of having to pry open the entire shell.

Rating: 4
I am not changing the fork rating, because I have not made this yet. However, I read the reviews and everyone PEELED the shrimp. What turned me off about the recipe is the fact that the shrimp are NOT peeled when the sauce is added thus making a messy eating. Did anyone actually make it as stated? I know my hubby well enough to know that if he has to go to all that trouble to eat it, he may not eat much.

Rating: 4
i would recommend using fresh shrimp, and boiling them using zataran's crab boil. it gives the shrimp that added kick ...and for those who like things spicy it helps out!

loved this recipe. My husband and I breaded the shrimp, which gave it a nice consistency. will definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
Fantastic! I, as always, made a few changes. First, I marinated the peeled shrimp in old bay seasoning & extra garlic powder. Then I sauteed minced garlic, chopped onion, dried thyme & rosemary in a tbsp or two of butter. I then added a bottle of beer and the shrimp shells and let it simmer. Seperately, in a very hot pan, I cooked the shrimp in another tbsp of butter until they were nice & crisp on the outside but still moist on the inside, adding another tbsp of butter at the end (note: there was some serious smoke in my small apartment kitchen). Then I removed the shells from the broth and added the broth to the shrimp/pan making sure to scrape up the brown bits in the pan. I know this version is different than the original recipe, but to be fair I made it as is first and liked this version better.

Rating: 4
I am not experienced with cooking shrimp, so this very simple recipe was ideal. It was quick and packed in a lot of flavor. I made it as instructed but I followed another reviewer's advice and cut WAY back on the butter and used white wine instead. I will prepare this again, but I will adjust the seasonings to add even more heat to suit my preference.

I followed a Cook from Texas' advice and added olive oil and wine. I also omitted the worcestershire and made more of a spicy scampi which I served over linguini. The crowd loved it!

Excellent. Cut the butter by half or more. Use some olive oil aand white wine to make up for the liquid. Definitely needs more cayanne. Serve with a lettuse/tomato/onion salad with Italian dressing. Grilled corn on the cob would be excellent.

I love this recipe. So easy, so fun, so tasty. I've tried the suggestion to cut back on the butter and add some half-and-half to finish off the sauce, and that works really well and gives a great consistency. This is a great dish to serve if you're having people over casually or just for the family. Yum.

Very good. Used half of the butter called for and it came out perfect. I also added more cayenne to make the dish more spicy

Very good, but my family prefers the "Grilled New Orleans-Style Shrimp" recipe on this site over this one. This one's a bit easier because the shrimp are sauteed in a skillet (v. cooked on the grill).

This was a great, easy little dinner. As other have noted, I would definitely recommend more than a "pinch" of cyanne pepper. My girlfriend and I both would have preferred the dish much spicier. Still, it had a nice flavor. Served with warm french bread, wine and a ton of paper towels for a fun, easy weeknight dinner.

I have made this both as an appetizer at a Mardi Gras inspired party and as a main course on a weeknight. I upped the cayenne, peeled the shrimp before cooking, and served with bread. There wasn't any sauce left in the bowl or the pan.

I use peel the shrimp and toss them in this seasoning mix then hubby grills them. I practically never use the sauce, although it's yummy. The shrimp is delicious by itself. This is my favorite grilled shrimp recipe.

Classic New Orleans style recipe! I've made these several times and have been a hit each time. If serving these for guests I always double the amount of sauce as everyone always wants to dip bread in it. When SO is travelling I cut the amount of shrimp and make the regular amount of sauce minus a bit of butter.

Rating: 4
Love this recipe... always a hit with the husband :) I use peeled shrimp (just be careful not to overcook) and leave off some of the butter, while adding a splash of cream and tabasco at the end. Serve with a crusty loaf of bread and a fresh veg or salad (a cooked veg just doesn't seem right with this to me) and you have a winner for sure!

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a big hit. I recently made it for Easter dinner and the relatives went wild!

Very tasty.. not at all hot, and I took the advise of others and added more cayenne. I must've had the heat up a bit too high during sauteing the garlic. My sauce was a bit too reduced and "oily". Good for soaking up with bread.. wish I had bought some!

This receipe is an absolute keeper. As good as any we had at restaurants in New Orleans, if not better. Spices are just right. I used large freshwater shrimp so had to cook them 3 minutes per side. They were succulent. Not a lot of sauce but it was good and tangy.

I, too, have rated this before, but I found an easier way. I put the shrimp (peeled, with tails left on) in a gallon-sized zip-lock baggie with the dry ingredients (rub) overnight or do it in the morning before work, and then complete the recipe when it's time to eat. As always, it's great! Especially if you make your own Cajun spice -- you control the heat and salt. One thing I found works: when making creole spice, substitute some of the cayenne with hot Hungarian paprika. It isn't as fiery, but it is more complex, somehow. Good stuff.

Rating: 0
I've rated this before (excellent) but I tried a different way to make this on Easter and thought I'd share. I peeled the shrimp and marinated them in the spices overnight. I then made the sauce on the stovetop but grilled the shrimp and poured the sauce over the hot-off-the-grill shrimp. Very good and worth a try. Enjoy!!

Rating: 3
Very tasty. I did not have onion powder so I used 1/2 tsp. onion salt instead (omiting the 1/2 tsp of plain salt.) Also, I shelled the shrimp first and let it marinate for 2 hours. Used slightly less butter in sauce. And finally, I sauted in olive oil rather than butter. Served the shrimp and sauce over white rice that had been cooked in chicken broth. Very easy and delicious!

Great and easy! I used a total of 2 tbspns butter, not the 7 the recipe called for and was very satisfied with the result. I also used alot more shrimp - probably almost double and only added a little more Worcestershire and lemon juice to get enough liquid to cook the shrimp. It was a huge hit!

This was easy and very good, in spite of the fact that I ran out of Worcestershire sauce and only had 2 tbsns. of it, I don't think it made any difference. I served this over polenta and it was excellent. Next time I might add more cayenne for more of a kick!

This recipe takes only a short time to prepare, and the ingredients are ones that I had on hand--no special trip to the grocery store.

GOOD GOLLY MISS MOLLY!! I added more cayenne & cut down the salt; also used 1/2 butter & 1/2 olive oil and more chopped garlic. Worked great with PD jumbo (16-20 ct) shrimp with their "tailfeathers" still attached to pick the shrimp up by. Not for the faint of palate! Served with a cool cucumber salad.

This was great!! I served it with Panfried Black Bean Coriander Cakes - a perfect duo! And although it looks like the two would take too much time for a weeknight, my husband and I got the meal together in 45 min. after getting home at 7 p.m. My 11 yr. old son loved it, too.

Mmm! I always have Emeril Lagasse's 'Essence' seasoning on hand which I used to coat the P&D shimp. I remove the Worcestershire and toss this dish over 'Angel Hair Pasta in Garlic Sauce' and serve w/ 'Cheese-Garlic Biscuits' (both from Betty Crocker's WWW). ALWAYS a hit my guests!

This was wonderful!! I made the dry rub using at least a teaspoon of cayenne rather than a pinch. (We love spicy food!) Then rubbed it into chicken quarters (leg&thigh) rather than shrimp. I let this marinate in the fridge for about two hours. Then made the butter mixture by using the basic ingredients and adding a small chopped onion and three cloves of thinly sliced garlic and included the juice of a lime. I grilled the chicken and basted with the butter mixture. WONDERFUL! The dish was served with steamed veggies, and scalloped potatoes. Yum!

This is a great dish! The sauce might more appropriately be called a "spicy New Orleans style BBQ sauce" instead of a creole, for this is not tomato based. I prepared the shrimp without their shells and served with tortellini, which made a wonderful meal. This sauce is incredible.
