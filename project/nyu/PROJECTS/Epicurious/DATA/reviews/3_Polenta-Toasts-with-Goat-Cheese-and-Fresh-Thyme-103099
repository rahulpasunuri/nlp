I did not serve mine (although, i did not try the goat cheese topping) as the polenta was completly flavorless

I have made this recipe several times. Once for a fundraiser, in which four people doubled the recipe for three hundred people. It was a hit! We changed two elements of the recipe. First was to roll the dough a little thicker, which made the toast more substantial. Second, changed the herb. I julianned deep fried sage for the top of the goat cheese. It was perfect!

I had no success with the wet rolling pin - wet work surface method suggested in this recipe. Instead - I poured the warm polenta out onto parchment paper and spread it with a wet butter knife. I expedited the cooling by letting the polenta cool on a cookie sheet over an Icy Cools mat I bought at the container store (life savers). The polenta then cut beautifully with a wet cookie cutter. I took the advice of other cooks and added a pesto mixture (minus the oil) to the milk (i prefer over water) before adding the cornmeal. While everyone raved over the results (I used my own topping) - I don't like realizing that a recipe doesn't *quite* work while company is waiting.

I was not impressed by these. If I ever did make them again, I would stir some grated cheese into the polenta, cut the polenta slices thicker, and maybe fry them. I might also stir the herbs into the polenta instead of putting them on top, as they gave it a weird mouthfeel & were too strong. As it was, I probably wouldn't make this recipe again--there are too many good ones out there.

This dish was delectable -- my new favorite party recipe. I added black pepper to the polenta, cut it into triangles instead of rounds, and used goat cheese with garlic and basil. Yum -- just perfect.

Don't discard those scraps..save them and deep fry or saute them, dusted with flour and serve them as croutons in salad or soup.

A friend of mine made this for a party. It was FABULOUS!!. He added some extra garlic to both the polenta and the goat's cheese mixture. It was just fabulous.
