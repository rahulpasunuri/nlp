I make all kinds of fried pies If you sub home made crust with Pillsbury already Crust you can cut the preap time to 1 hr .I am from Arkansas and belive me they are just as good.You will need 3 crust to get 12.

I didn't have dried apples and did not want to make my own pastry so here's what I did instead: used 3 fresh apples 2 1/2 tblsp brown sugar lemon zest 1/4 tsp cinnamon about 1/4 cup cider 2 pre-made pie crusts (cut into 6 circles each using a martini glass) sliced apples thinly and put into a pan with the dry ingredients, zest, and cider until apples were soft (but not mushy) and liquid was gone. Filled each circle with enough filling to still be able to fold over, wet edges, and crimp shut with a fork. I had some filling left over. used a deep frier for about 7 minutes sprinkled with raw sugar when they were done (i might add more granulated sugar to the filling next time instead) My family loved them and it was so so easy to make.

I don't know why you use the dried apples, but you should. That's how they're always made, and they just don't taste the same with fresh apples. My husband's grandma makes them with biscuits, which I don't like. My grandma makes a similar dough to this recipe, but uses all lard, which makes them super flaky (lard has 1/3 of the calories and 1/3 of the cholesterol of butter, thanks). I'll probably make this recipe...I'm craving these, and I don't have time to go up to the mountains to see how my grandma makes them (she never measures or writes anything down).

This was good, but I ran out of filling with 1/3 of my dough left. I used homemade plum jam as filling for the rest, which was almost as good (but not quite). In addition, I'm not entirely clear why I had to use dried apples when I more or less reconstituted them... thoughts?

Can't give this particular recipe a review, but I'll bet it's terrific. My family has made them forever. Instead of making pastry I roll out refrigerated buttermilk biscuits, and I fry the pies in a cast iron skillet vs. deep frying. Easy and delicious.
