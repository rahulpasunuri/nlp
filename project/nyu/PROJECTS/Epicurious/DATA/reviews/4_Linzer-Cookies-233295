These are delicious and look beautiful, but as other reviewers noted, the dough is a pain to work with. I made two batches. On the first batch I followed the directions to the letter, on the second I just rolled all of the dough into a log, refrigerated, and sliced. I punched out stars in the middle of half the slices and baked. The result was just as pretty and took about 1/16 of the time.

After a few days of sitting the cookie soaks us some of the moisture from the preserves melding the flavors. A totally different taste and texture from the cookie on day one! I used the hazelnut flour and broke the dough into 1/4 instead of half. Those suggestions made this an easy recipe for a non-cook like myself. Will make these ahead for holiday meetings.

This recipe was a big hit! I will add it to my arsenal of Holiday cookies. Can't wait to make them again for Valentine's Day.

To make this cookie for nut allergic person, try a recipe for imperial cookies and add almond flavouring if possible. The nuts add a fineness to the dough, which would be lost if more flour was added.

This is one of my favorite Christmas cookies! I replaced hazelnuts with almonds, but I kept everything else the same. The dough can get a bit soft as I cut the cookie shapes, but adding some flour helps and it's worth the work. The aroma of toasted almonds combined with the tartness of the raspberry jam is delicious! Can hardly wait to make it again this December.

These cookies are worth the fuss. They do need to be at the right temperature to roll and cut, and then I find it works better to refrigerate them on the sheets briefly before baking. I make them each Valentine's Day, cut into tiny 1-inch scalloped circles with a teeny heart center cutout. Each is a single sweet bite. Heaven!

Question: I'd love to make a cookie inspired by linzer cookies for someone who is allergic to nuts. Obviously, it would be a totally different cookie, but would it be possible just by substituting flour for the ground nuts? Any suggestions? Again, I realize it'd be a completely different cookie, but I thought it'd be worth a try. Thanks!!

I made these as a gift for my boyfriend's family, and while they really enjoyed them, they were the biggest pain in the arse to make. I don't care how much they liked them, I'll never make them again. The dough is just insanely hard to work with. Even if you chill it properly, after a couple minutes it just comes apart in your hands. I had to make all my cut outs, chill it for 30 minutes and then work as fast as I could to get them away from the extra dough and onto the cookie sheet before they started coming apart again (which took about 2 minutes). They looked beautiful at the end, but were way too much trouble to ever make again.

Fantastic recipe! I make these cookies every Valentine's day and everyone loves them. My grandmother thought I had bought the cookies because they look so good! I think it's a good idea to split the dough in quarters instead of just halving it. Since I'm a perfectionist with my cookies, it takes me a little longer to roll out and cut, and the softer the dough gets, the harder it is to work with. Also, before assembling baked cookies, I dust the top cookies with powdered sugar. I use raspberry preserves with the seeds as well. I find they taste better and look a lot prettier/natural with the seeds. And the cookies do taste better after a couple of days while the flavors meld. Can't wait to make these cookies again!

Made for the first time and followed recipe to a T. Absolutely delicious and a VERY FORGIVING dough. If it gets too soft, put it in the fridge. If it gets too cold, let it soften a bit. I had a pastry scraper to help transfer the cookies to the sheet. Not one cookie broke! In the 70s, my mom made a Scandinavian version with almonds (we would have to buy whole almonds with skins - it would be my chore to boil the almonds and "pop" the skins). Believe me, toasting hazelnuts and rubbing off the skins in a kitchen towel is much more gentle on the fingertips! My mother would assemble the cookies only hours before presentation. And that's what I do. I keep the cookies in a tin and assemble only as many as I need. My daughter loves the ritual of "making" her cookie. My second batch is in the fridge and I will be rolling out tonight!

I swapped the hazelnuts for pecans, which was what I had on hand, and these came out beautifully. Would also recommend reducing the jam so it sticks better.

This was a simple and elegant cookie to make. I brought them to a Jr League potluck and everyone raved about not only how beautiful they were, but how good they tasted. I prefer the hazelnut instead of almonds or pecan nut that other recipes call for. A few tips I'd suggest: 1) Use a silpat on the top and bottom to roll out the dough - it made it a snap. 2) bake all fronts or all backs together b/c the front cookie w/ the cutouts bakes a bit faster 3) make sure you dust the fronts w/ powdered sugar before you made the sandwich :-)

I make these every year for my cookie exchange, I make the dough a couple of weeks ahead and cut out the shapes, then freeze the unbaked cookies and bake them the day before I need them. After the 2nd rolling I cut out mini cookies from the scraps and bake them and dust with powdered sugar, they are a cute addition to the package. My local store now carries hazelnuts without the skin, saves a lot of time. These cookies hold up well and even the assemble cookies freeze well.

Just like I remembered from my childhood! I took the advice of one reviewer and chilled the dough in four seperate disks inside plastic gallon bags. It made it so easy to roll out!

These cookies were a huge hit! The only change I made was to use 3 oz almond flour instead of hazelnuts. I split the dough into quarters and dropped it into gallon-sized ziploc bags before chilling. The dough is very temperature sensitive, and I think working with smaller quantities made it easier. I rolled out the dough in the ziploc bags, which saved me from having to add additional flour (same concept as wax paper, but even neater and easier to pop back in the fridge when needed). Next time, I would make a few more tops than bottoms - some of the tender tops broke because of the cutouts.

I make this recipe every year for my boyfriend on Valentine's day (they're his favorite). I make the recipe as directed. My only word of warning to people thinking of making this recipe is that de-skinning the hazelnuts can be time consuming and tedious. Also, just pulsing them in the blender leaves some nut chunks, which adds a bit of a rustic texture, but might not be the refined texture you're looking for. This year I might try to find hazelnut flour as one user mentioned. My last bit of advice: get nice natural raspberry jam is key because it's flavor is so much richer and texture is thicker than that Smuckers stuff.

I made the recipe exactly as written and found the dough very soft even after refrigerating for 30 minutes. I tried rolling between waxed paper but had some difficulty with the very soft dough. I ended up rolling out on granite with lots of flour and brushing excess flour off. I combined the tastes from the Wolfgang Puck recipe, upped the cinnamon by 1/4 t. and included the following: - 1/8 t. cloves - 1/8 t. nutmeg - 1 t. grated lemon zest It added some complexity to the flavor.

I used this recipe for my first attempt at Linzer Cookies, after having bought a great linzer cutter set from C&B, and the cookies are amazing!! Instead of using hazelnuts I used 1/2 cup of Bob's Red Mill Hazelnut Flour, and I also used 1/2 cup cold butter and 1/2 cup toasted hazelnut oil. I put everything in the food processor and pulsed until the dough barely came together. It rolled out and cut fairly well when right out of the fridge, but there was no hope of re-rolling the scraps, so I concur with other reviewers that you really must keep your idle dough refrigerated and roll batches in tandem. But it's well worth the effort, the flavor and texture are amazing!! Highly recommended!

This yielded delightfully flaky, buttery cookies. Dough was very easy to work with as long as it's thoroughly chilled. Flavor and presentation were outstanding--and they were not as difficult as the recipe first appeared. Will definitely make these again, and maybe with a lemon curd filling.

I am thinking that because I used walnuts and didn't toast them is the reason- but I wasn't impressed with these. I grew up on these in germany and this recipe didn't capture the proper melange of flavor.

I've made these for family, friends and work, and they're always a hit. A quick tip, if you want to change it up a little, is to melt some dark chocolate (not baking chocolate), spread a thin layer on the bottom cookie and let it set for a few minutes in the fridge. Then spread a little bit of raspberry preserves, put the top cookie on and chill. I find they're better the next day. The kids like it with a little dark chocolate and fluff. I also don't put sugar on top. Not traditional, but they seem to like it.

Won a blue ribbon at the state fair this summer with this recipe. Have done this twice. Once with ground almonds purchased from Trader Joe's. Loved it both ways. Using a chilled piece of granite as a worksurface helps extend the time you have to work with the dough while cutting out shapes.

I have made these at the holidays for the past 3 years and they are always delicious and always a hit. you might not think a jam cookie could be so tasty, but they are incredible. the only drawback is that they take a long time to make, partially because there's so much butter in the dough-- I found it very hard to handle. What I now do is chill the dough a little, then roll it out and chill it again before i cut the cookies, which makes cutting WAY easier. Also, I dust mine with confectionary sugar as the photo shows but the recipe does not include. Make sure you use fresh nuts-- I've had hazelnuts get rancid on me pretty quick. I never bother trying to get all the skin off the nuts, either. One more thing, I've also frozen this dough and baked it months later and it was still fantastic!

Its true that these are extremely time consuming, but its a fun kind of time consuming. I made these as Christmas presents for some kiddies in my family, and they loooovvved them. I glazed the tops with part jam, part water to make more confectioner's sugar stick, and the mixture of the sugar and glaze created a pretty light purple color. Aesthetically pleasing + delicious : )

I made these cookies for a New Year's get- together and got rave reviews from everyone. I'm surprised so many people had trouble with the dough; I don't know what I did right but was able to roll out the dough without any problem. I followed The Cook from PA's suggestion to put the "idle" dough in the fridge while I was busy cutting and baking. Used raspberry jam for the filling. Delicious.

These cookies were so delicious, but definitely a lot of work for the amount of sandwich cookies it yields. The dough wasn't bad to work with, I just kept alternating between dough portions and throwing the idle dough back in the fridge. Great taste and texture, and lovely presentation--almost too pretty to eat!

Crispy, buttery and very good - but I felt like they were a lot of work for a cookie.

After reading the reviews regarding the super soft dough, I tried freezing the butter and cutting it into the flour mixture as I would for a pie crust. I used my food processor as opposed to doing it by hand. I rolled it between 2 sheets of plastic wrap to avoid using additional flour. Then I put it in the freezer to harden before cutting and baking. Because of the additional steps involved, I made this over 2 days, doing the cutting and baking on the second day. During the holidays, I make several batches of dough, form balls, flatten into 1/2 inch thick rounds, wrap and freeze. Then I can roll, cut and bake at a later date.

I made these cookies for my daughter's wedding reception and they were delicious! As a girl, my family would travel into New York from time to time and inevitable we would stop at Zaro's and enjoy a Linzer tart! Yum! This recipe is just as good! It does take some time to complete, however they keep very well as the recipe says!

this was a waste of my time and effort, the dough was uncooperative, refrigerated, froze, tried all tricks, still to sticky to cut. Added more flour, no luck. Finally rolled in balls and made thumbprint cookies, not all that tasty. They were okay, but not worth the time and effort. Much better thumbprint cookie recipes around.

I felt that the cookie itself was a bit too dry. I'm an accomplished baker, can't think of a thing I did wrong, and may feel differently after a couple of days; most bakers are in agreement that these cookies improve with age. I will try them again.

This isn't as laborious as many would have you think, plus the taste is fantastic. I rolled the dough right out of the mixer between two sheets of plastic wrap, stuck it in the freezer for 5 minutes on the metal cookie sheet, then in the fridge for 5. It cut perfectly and cooked just fine. Try this once and you'll make it again.

These are easily the best cookies I ever made, but they are really time-consuming. It's worth it to toast and grind your own hazelnuts (it makes the dough delicious) but if you can find pre-skinned ones, get them, because removing the skins is highly tedious. Also, rolling the dough between two silpat sheets works better than wax paper, because they wont tear. Amazing cookies, and so pretty.

Made a great presentation for my friend's bridal shower! Found it very important to keep the dough chilled so it wouldn't break apart while rolling. Also, I cut heart centers out directly on the baking sheet and pulled the dough out immediately...this kept the edges clean. Will make these cookies again but only for special occasions due to the production time.

Loved the flavor combination, but these cookies were a lot of work, primarily because the dough got very soft, very quickly, even though I rolled it out on marble. Had to chill after cutting so I could transfer to baking sheet. Might cheat next time: I rolled the leftover dough into balls and made depressions in each, almost all the way through, then topped with a generous dollop of the raspberry jam after baking: delicious, and a lot easier (though not as pretty, I'll admit).

Loved the recipe--the cookies filled with jam do improve over a few days. I filled a few with chocolate (a few chocolate chips melted with a bit of heavy cream) and they were also wonderful! The chocolate is not classic--but is great with the hazel nuts!

Very tasty. Get roasted hazelnut flour from King Arthur to make life easier - rolls out well, too. Also, if you use the wild strawberry jam (chefshop.com) you'll be in for a treat, too.

I thought the hazelnuts were a wonderful addition to the cookie dough. Mine did not overpower the other flavors. I loved these cookies, and would like to try this recipe again using other flavors of jam to see how it tastes. But it would be hard to top the raspberry.

Rating: 3
Great cookie if you like hazelnuts, for some reason they overpowered the flavors. I might have roasted them too long, they do take a while to make. My dough was a little too soft even after refrigerating for 2 hours, therefore when I tryed to put them on the cookie sheet they didn't keep their shape. so for the second batch I rolled the dough out on between two sheets of wax paper, cut the cookies out, removed the extra dough and left the cookies on the wax paper, placed them on the cookie sheet & baked them. Next time I'll try them with a shortbread base.

Great!!! A little bit labour intensive - the dough was quite sticky. After rolling out the dough, I put it in the freezer for about 5 minutes. The cutouts stayed together much better - the dough didn't tear when I tried to remove the shapes from the rolled-out sheet. These get better the day after! To respond to the previous question - dust w/sugar before sandwiching (keeps the jam center clean).

do dust with powdered sugar before or after sandwiching together?
