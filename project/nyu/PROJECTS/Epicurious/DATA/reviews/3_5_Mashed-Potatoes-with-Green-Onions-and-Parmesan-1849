Good, but not very sexy. Definitely needs more butter/milk/sour cream to make it creamier.

This recipe is now our holiday staple. My daughter asks if I am making the "cheesy potatoes" every time. Company raves about them also and requests the recipe without fail and are surprised when they see how easy it is!

Made this for the second time tonight and have never reviewed it before. Needed to triple the amount of milk called for (used 2%) to 1/4 plus 1/8 cup (6 Tbs.) for a nice consistency. Perhaps that is because I only mashed the potatoes (don't have a food mill) and used 1/3 cup of canned grated cheese instead of the 2/3 cup of freshly grated. Next time I may try adding some chives and fat free sour cream (to replace some milk) as other reviewers have suggested. A very easy and mildly flavored mashed potato recipe. YUM, YUM.

Good, easy recipe. The cheese does not come through as a very strong flavor which surprised me.

This is simple, basic and so good. I added about 2 tbls of sour cream as well and used a mixture of green onions and chives. I used a ricer and after mixing together, put it in a ceramic dish and in the oven to keep warm on lowest setting. They ended up sitting in the oven for awhile and the flavors really melded together. So Yummy!!!

I made this dish for my husband who loves plain old mashed potatoes, and he ate the whole batch! These had a wonderful flavor, and we'll definately make these over plain potatoes from now on!

This was great. I confess I used mashed from the dairy section but I doubt I will ever have plain old potatoes again, It was fast and delicious.

I don't give many 4 fork ratings, but I loved these potatoes. I did use chives, as I have fresh in my herb garden. Absolutely wonderful! I served this dish with cornmeal-crusted chicken breasts and it was really, really good.

These potatoes were easy and delicious. Everyone at the table, loved them. It's a great way to serve mashed potatoes, especially if you are serving a meat that doesn't have a sauce or gravy.

This dish was very easy to make and delicious. I cooked the potatoes in chicken broth instead of water and then used the potato water to make a sauce for my pork loin. It was great!

This was a very simple recipe and I had the ingredients on hand. My husband raved over this dish.
