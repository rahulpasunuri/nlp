I cutted down the amount of cheese by half, and it is good and easy to prepare.

This stuff is soooo good. A little bit goes a long way in the snack department because it is quite rich, so get ready to have leftovers.

This is a different, but tasty pate. Easy. Next time I would increase the thyme and brandy to help balance the blue cheese. Make sure to serve at room temperature so that the flavors come through. I froze leftovers in thick slices. You can thaw in the fridge with excellent results.

Just ok. I am a huge pate fan and was really looking forward to this one. I used high quality imported blue, 12 year old McCallan instead of brandy and made sure to caramelize the onions but the result lacked depth and complexity of flavor I expected from all these great ingredients.

This was awesome! I was short of brandy so subbed in some Marsala. The blue cheese doesn't jump out at you, rather it is a subtle back note, which just kind of lingers on the tongue. We served this on toasted garlic baugette slices and drank with a Zinfandel. Outstanding flavors! Making again soon!

I made this for a group of friends yessterday and it was quickly devoured. It is so simple to make and I didn't/wouldn't change a thing. i used Treasure Cave blue cheese. It has a very sublt blue cheese flavor.

This is easy & delicious! After unmolding it, I covered it with chopped candied (and peppery) pecans. It disappeared quickly.

Super easy tp make and was a big crowd pleaser. Great consistancy and flavor, the blue cheese does not overower as I feared. I highly recommend this one for the pate lover.

Huge hit! Highly recommended. Personally, I loved the flavor. However, the next time I make this for a party, I would cut back the amount of blue cheese a bit, just in case some of the guests don't care for blue cheese. Oh yeah, I used cognac instead of brandy.

Delicious! This was easy to make, and unmolded beautifully. It serves 12.

This was absolutely delicious and super easy to make! I wondered about the combination of liver and blue cheese but the strong flavors were very harmonious. Didn't have brandy so I substituted bourbon and that was fine too. Leftovers make a lovely sandwich spread on crusty bread with sweet onion.....

Excellent pate! We had been using an earlier recipe and at first thought this would be too rich with the blue cheese, but it was just right. I would still add a teaspoon or so of lemon zest to brighten the flavor a bit. Made it for Thanksgiving to rave reviews and made it again (a double batch) for this Christmas!
