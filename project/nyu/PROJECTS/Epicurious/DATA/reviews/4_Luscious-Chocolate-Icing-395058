This is a typical ganache. I made the icing for my own chocolate espresso bundt cake. I used a combination of a Hershey's Special Dark chocolate bar, Trader Joe's Organic dark chocolate bar, and one small Hershey milk chocolate bar. Very dark chocolaty & rich. Easy to pour if not too thick. Refrigerate until firm and you can make truffles with this recipe. Definitely will use this recipe again.
