As Chrissypoo said, if you want more garlic flavor mince the garlic. Mincing distributes the garlic flavors throughout the oil mixture. I added just a dash of fresh lemon juice because it perks up the flavors. The idea is not to add lemon flavor but "dial up" the smoky paprika, garlic, and pepper instead of using more salt. The chicken breasts I used were very large (about 1/2# each) so they needed to roast a bit longer. Not a problem at all for the rest of the ingredients. Consider pan-roasted asparagus to add some green to the plate. Here in the Pacific Northwest we love our asparagus in spring!

Delicious ...I made this recipe with a few changes. I chopped up 3 garlic and pressed 2 . I used 6 legs and thighs instead of chicken breast. I added cabbage to add some more nutrition.I didn't have yogurt so i I omitted that step, i just left the spice mixture as a whole . Placed chicken in a deep skillet and rubbed with 2 tablespoons of mixture, then seasoned with adobo(instead of salt) and pepper. Didn't use tomates. I added the beans, half a head of cabbage ( it looks like a lot but it will cook down) , 1/2 the cilantro and an extra 1/2 teaspoon of smoked paprika to a bowl and mixed well and seasoned it with adobo(instead of salt) and pepper. I then poured the mixture around the chicken and cooked uncovered in the oven at 450 degrees for about 40-50 mins stirring the cabbage/bean mixture every 15 mins to make sure it all gets the flavor of the sauce and cooks all the cabbage evenly. I also would check to see if the chicken was done , my chicken didn't take 20 mins as the recipe stated. When the chicken was done, I spooned the mixture over black rice and sprinkled with the cilantro. I didn't miss the yogurt at all. Delicious !!!! Don't forget the cilantro it takes this dish from great to excellent. This is now one of our weekly dinners.

great recipe, really easy. sauted onions, jalapeno , and poblano pepper and added to chickpea mixture prior to baking, also doubled the chickpea mixture. Found the yogurt mixture slightly bland so added a few cherry tomatoes and cilantro and pureed in "magic bullet". was also really good.

Fabulous. We added a couple of small zucchini, diced, to the tomato/chickpea mixture for a one pot meal.

I rubbed this oil spice mix on a small whole chicken and roasted it with the beans and tomatoes plus some onions in a Dutch oven for about an hour. Holy Happiness, Batman. This was delicious, easy and so flavorful we found we didn't even need the yogurt sauce. (I ate it later as a snack with pita chips.) Served this with buttered orzo and biscuits. (I think this longer cook time may have mellowed out the pepper - I did not find this too spicy as some other reviewers did) We will definitely be making this recipe again.

SOOOOOOO good! Made it exactly per the recipe, but did have to increase the cooking time -- maybe it's just the gigundous Whole Foods chicken breasts I used, but no way was 20 minutes going to be enough -- I took them out at 35, and they were still JUST slightly underdone. Juicy and absolutely delicious, though. Please do yourself a favor and do NOT used canned tomatoes!!! Seriously, it's LESS work to use fresh grape tomatoes, and the roasting makes them so super sweet. Will definitely make this again.

This was so easy, tasty, and satisfying. We used skinless, boneless chicken thighs and served with naan and some feta on the side. Next time I would let the chicken marinade a few hours beforehand. It was great but probably won't make it to our weekly rotation.

This is seriously good. My husband just asked that it go into rotation, and that doesn't happen often. A couple of things - I salted the chicken breasts and let them sit for about twenty minutes while I put everything together. I also rinsed the beans to get that gross canned bean slime off of them. Again, this recipe is a keeper. It's easy enough for a weeknight, good enough for company, tasty, and healthy. It has it all. Way to go, Epicurious.

This was fantastic and easy! I will most definitely make this again. Of course - I made a few changes. Replaced the garbanzos (only because I don't like them) with hominy, used fat-free Fage yogurt, and made twice as much of the tomato mixture. The yogurt sauce would be good as a dip for vegetables or little cocktail potatoes.

When I first started making this, I took an early reviewer's advice and substituted ras al hanout for the smoked paprika, which was fantastic and I've continued to make the substitution. Also usually use canned tomatoes which doesn't seem to lose anything. Served this to a visitor recently just getting familiar with ras al hanout, and she immediately asked for the recipe. It's a regular in our house now.

Easy and excellent. I doubled the recipe (and tripled the tomatoes.) The yogurt sauce is really delicious - next time I'll make extra. (FYI, I found the smoked paprika at Whole foods.) I rounded out the meal with some steamed broccoli and sprinkled it with the yogurt sauce - the flavor of the sauce is unique and it has a great smoky taste. (It would be great with fresh vegetables as an appetizer.) For a healthy and quick dinner, it's hard to beat this recipe. My husband loved it!

I doubled only the garbanzo beans/tomatoes and used canned tomatoes. Will try fresh this summer. Also used boneless chicken breasts because other was not available. Delicious. Next time will also try adding a bit more spice to the doubled sauce.

i just made this for the third time, and i used boneless, skinless thighs. it was great, though i have to say that i really like the texture and flavor of the skin when i use bone-in breasts. if going skinless next time, i think that i will marinate the chicken for a few hours in the spiced oil with a little salt in order to really let the flavors get into the meat, as others have mentioned. other than that, what a great dish all around. can't wait to eat the leftovers today for lunch! :)

This dish is delicious! And the recipe is forgiving (was out of grd cumin so I used adobo; also messed up with the yogurt--mistakenly dumped it into the bowl of seasoned oil...had to scrape as much out as I could but it didn't cause any problem!). When it came out of the oven, I squirted some fresh lemon juice all over it, seasoned with fine sea salt and then sprinkled with the remaining chopped cilantro. We loved it (I couldn't stop eating the garbanzo beans and tomatoes.) I may add more cherry tomatoes next time...they were sooooo good.

i used smoked paprika as is called for and for crushed pepper i grind some chilies in the mortar and pestle, which always makes things 10x hotter. We love spicy food and it really delivered. I don't think the spice blend lent itself well to the yogurt however. I would have liked something cooling, but that was not it. kind of odd-tasting.

Rating: 4
This is a recipe the whole family raved about and will definitely enter rotation. It was simple to prepare, but the sum was definitely greater than its parts. I didn't have smoked paprika, so used a 2:1 ratio of California sweet with half-sharp. I also skipped the crushed red pepper for the toddlers; while the husband and I would have enjoyed the added spice, the paprika was enough flavor for the kids. We had fresh bread from the oven to mop up the oil and sauce. The only minor thing I noted was that while this is a 4-serving recipe, it's four small servings and not enough for a whole meal. One definitely should make something else on the side to round out a meal.

Excellent new addition to the repertoire - Such a simple recipe, but a little bit out of my normal routine of flavors and combinations. Was afraid the chick peas would dry out in the hot oven, but they just got a great toasty crunch. I did add one carrot, chopped small. Served with sauteed kale and thin-sliced cauliflower. Need to remember this one!

This has become one of my all-time favorite weeknight recipes but it's tasty enough for company. I use chicken thighs (increase time to 40 minutes or so) and the cilantro is optional (have used cilantro-in-a-tube and it's fine). Serve with cous cous and some kind of sauteed green. I keep having to make bigger batches because I can't stop eating it!

Great for dinner, even better leftovers when spices have melded. Quick and easy and delicious, will definitely make this again. Used bone-in breasts, next time might try thighs.

I have made this (or variations) several times and it is always delicious. I like to add crushed (canned) san marzano tomatoes so that it is less dry and more "saucy." Also, lemon zest, lemon juice, or preserved lemons add a wonderful flavor, and I always add olives as well--kalamatas, cracked greens, or a mixture. I usually finish with fresh parsley rather than the cilantro, because I consider the rest of the ingredients and spices to be Mediterranean, and I think the parsley works better with that.

Rating: 4
Yum! Added cubed carrots and a bit of lemon juice, used small white beans instead of garbanzos and more garlic, plus, my own sweet 100 tomatoes! Loved it and decided it woud be great for company, especially for those that are lactose intolerant (no sauce). My house smells amazing!!!

Best part of this meal is how easy it was to make and clean up. I chopped chicken breast into large chunks and tossed it with all the other ingredients in a large dish, then baked. I feel this gave the chicken more flavor and cooked a bit faster. Next time, I may cut back on the oil just a tad. For dinner, we stuffed into whole wheat pitas and topped it with the yogurt (made with fat-free greek)... delicious! Served with a side of baked sweet potato fries.

So good! I used skinless and bonelwss thighs and seasoned them in the morning. We really like roasted cherry tomatoes so I used almost double. Cooked in 35 min. LOVED how the tomatoes were soft and bursting with juice while the chickpeas got a bit crispy. And it is a 1 pan meal, so not much cleanup. Actually I used 2 pans-it goes great with whole wheat couscous or quinoa.

My roommate and I couldn't believe how great this turned out. So far, the highlight of our week. The chicken and vegetables stayed incredibly juicy and sopped up all the flavor of the generous amount of spices, but all blended perfectly. However I did make a few changes. Like others used chicken thighs from the freezer, pinto beans instead of chickpeas, and added carrots and a little bit of tomato sauce to the mix. This became an instant staple.

I used chicken legs and it took 40 mins. I stirred it a couple of times to keep the chickpeas moist. Mine was a bit too hot because I used a hot smoked paprika as well as the dried chilis.

This recipe may look a little intimidating at first, but after you make it one time (and have all the ingredients on hand), it is so wonderful and easy to make! My husband always asks for me to make this dish, and even made his own nickname for it so it's easier to remember/ask for. I had read the reviews on this before making it, and I would definitely agree that you should double all the ingredients. I've always just used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and we thoroughly enjoy it. Our favorite part are the leftovers :) Also, the yogurt sauce, though a little different at first, is a DEFINITE MUST! I can't imagine this dish without it.

I loved the way the flavors all combine in this dish. Unless you hate cilantro, don't skip the addition of it to the final plate along with the yogurt sauce, it really makes the flavors all work perfectly. I halved the recipe to make it for 2 chicken breasts but they were so big I think next time I might make the full recipe with just 2 breasts or I might try skinless, boneless breasts.

Wow!!! This recipe is amazing and one that I will make over and over again! I doubled the veggies (heirloom cherry tomatoes and grape tomatoes w/ the garbanzo beans) and doubled the sauces. I rubbed the chicken w/oil mixture about 3 hours before cooking. Cooked 6 split bone-in chicken breasts alone for 10 minutes, then added veggie/oil mixture and cooked another 30 minutes before it was done. The chicken was juicy, the colors amazing. I served with toasted pitas and plain couscous which was perfect for soaking up the wonderful juices. Friends and family all raved about it and had seconds. The yogurt sauce is a wonderful accompaniment! Just perfect!

i'll admit i don't cook much buT this reciepe was very easy and tasty. as per some of the other reviews i made twice as much of the spiced oil and i marinated the chicken in lemon, salt and smoked paprika for 30 min and then 2-3 tbsp on the spiced oil mixture. i also cooked the chicken half way and then added the tomato garbanzo mixture. it turned out great! the chicken was seasoned just right and the yogurt sauce is great too. i did add a little more spice as well as some salt to the yogurt but overall excellent reciepe that i'll be making again.

This was quite good. Nothing incredibly memorable, but absolutely yummy stuff. I do wish I had used a combination of both chicken thighs (a little more fatty can be a good thing) and chicken breast meat, but live 'n learn.

I love this recipe, and my family did, too--it is fast, healthy, simple, and combines the Mediterranean/Moroccan flavors I love. I doubled the yogurt part and mistakenly added cilantro to it, but would make it the same way next time. Important to use the smoked paprika, which, fortunately, I had on hand. I used skinless boneless chicken breasts and it was fine. A very tasty and healthy dish. I served with steamed broccoli with a little olive oil and salt.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and regular paprika. I made up the spiced oil and yogurt sauce a few hours ahead of time to give the flavors a chance to mellow. I doubled the beans and tomatoes as suggested in previous reviews and I was very glad I did. It was simply amazing! The aroma of this dish cooking made my mouth water. By the way, I completely forgot to add salt and did not notice till I was nearly finished with dinner. The spice combination was ideal for anyone who is limiting salt in their diet. I will try smoked paprika in the future.

The secret of this dish is in the SMOKED PAPRIKA. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. The meat was marinated before cooking. This is key!The marinade consisted of the spices in the recipe plus a store bought marinade-'garlic and herb' flavor. Marinate for at least one hour. I mixed the chickpeas with the spices and laid them out under the chicken in the baking dish. I also drizzled sone of the spice mixture on top of the meat.Cover the dish with aluminum foil to seal in the juices. I served it with rice and sauteed Swiss chard. I left out the yogurt sauce, will make some next time. For vegetarians, you can make it sans meat. Very tasty and delicious!

Easy and delicious! My foodie family ate this up. I roasted the garbanzo beans and the tomatoes until they were good and roasted. Added to the flavor of the dish.

Definitely agree with a cook from San Francisco that flavorwise this is probably not really a full 4-fork, but it is so ridiculously easy and visually appealing that it gets 4-forks from me, too.

This will become part of our regular rotation.

This has become a staple in my household, and I've found several variations that work well (pesto and white beans, Indian spices substituted for the paprika). Try a different spice mixture to suit your taste!

I made this with a whole, cut-up chicken and will definitely make it again. However, I won't be using the chicken breasts the next time since the chicken thighs and drumsticks were much tastier. I am sure that the chicken breasts would make great pita filling the next day, but no one in my family is a white meat fan. Also, next time I will really nestle the chicken on top of the chickpea mixture to add more flavor to the chickpeas and keep them from getting dried out. I am not normally a chickpea fan, but these were great.

This was delicious and very easy! I used boneless breasts and served it over brown rice. It was very colorful and the beans were crunchy and tasty. Can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow in a wrap!

We enjoyed this very much! definitely not quite enough tomatoes and beans for 4 pieces of chicken, but i'll take care of that next time. the tomatoes just pop in your mouth. sooo yummy. i did not have smoked paprika and it was still good so don't let that stop you! we ate this on top of soft polenta and the salt from that made up for me forgetting to salt and pepper the dish before cooking. i also used fresh cilantro for the top of the dish after cooking and used the cilatro you get in a tube and keep in the freezer for cooking. It was possibly not as pretty but for flavor it worked out great. Enjoy!

Somehow this dish did not come together as expected. I followed the directions, and in the end, the chicken was still pink inside. Yuk! After finishing cooking the next day as I reheated, the chicken was okay at best.

Delicious recipe - I've made this several times to rave reviews! I agree with other reviewers that the garbanzo bean/tomato mixture should be doubled. This recipe is just as tasty the next day in a pita wrap. We always make this along with the caramelized cumin carrots recipe that's also on epicurious and it's a nice combo. Definitely 4 fork

Would have given 3 forks because the flavor is good but not great. Instead gave 4 forks because recipe uses simple ingredients, quick to make and clean up, and tastes good. A safe choice that would appeal to most palate. A keeper that I will make regularly.

Delicious! We just finished dinner and it was a HIT. I left out the chicken at no cost to the flavor. My boyfriend helped himself to heaping seconds and licked the plate at the end of the meal. I also upped the garlic, opted for roasted and ground cumin seed over store-bought cumin powder, and experimented with adding 1-1/2 tsps of roasted and ground sesame seed to the oil. Otherwise, I followed the recipe closely. My boyfriend is wandering around the living room in a bliss coma.

While I didn't read all the reviews, glad I took the time to read the first couple of pages! Upped the amt of garlic and crushed red pepper and let the chicken marinate about 2hrs prior to cooking. They were huge breasts, so roasted them alone for about 30 min, then added remaining ingredients; didn't have enough tomatoes,so added can of diced tomatoes with juices and roasted another 30 min, so a little juicier than intended, but since DH likes it that way, not a problem! Served over whole wheat cous cous. Planned to make salad or some green veggie with it, but didn't need to. Would use smaller breasts or cut them in half if I was serving company. Loved the spiciness but may go a little hotter next time, and there will be a next time!

This is an exceptional dish with no substitution necessary. Loved how the chickpeas were just a bit crisp after cooking. Matched well with the sweetness of the tomatoes. I used 2 large chicken breasts but kept the rest of the ingredient amounts as is. Agree with previous review...veggies might not stretch enough to serve 4. Chicken breast came out perfectly moist and cooked through. Can't wait to share this with friends!

This is definitely going into the rotation. For just me and my husband, I used 1 good sized boneless skinless breast but left all the other portions the same, and it was plenty. I made the oil mixture in a 9.5 in. Pyrex pie dish, marinated the chick in it for a bit, and then stirred in the tomatoes and beans for less mess. Used cayenne instead of crushed red pepper, and definitely more garlic and perhaps a little more salt next time. 20 minutes @ 450 was just about right, the pan was crowded so I gave it a couple extra minutes. Served it with spinach salad and couscous as the previous reviewer suggested, and it was a perfect combination. I am surprised the tomatoes and chickpeas go far enough for 4 servings; we had a little leftover, but I would lean towards increasing those for 4. I still can't believe how easy it was. Simple and delicious. I've not had smoked paprika before... it was really flavorful but not overpowering to the other ingredients.

What?! I had dinner on the table in record time (30minutes??!), and it was DELICIOUS!! I used boneless skinless breasts and made sure to coat them really really well in the marinade. 20 minutes was perfect for them - though I can see how going much longer would cause the chickpeas to get a little harder than you'd like. Served with a simple spinach & feta salad and Israeli couscous made with just sauteed shallots, chicken broth, and chopped cilantro (oh, and a little butter...just a bit!) Four forks not because it's smashingly gourmet, but for what it is: Great flavor, healthy, a refreshing take on chicken, couldn't be easier (or quicker!). Definite keeper.

This is so delicious! I served it with some garlic naan, yum! The only thing I would suggest is cooking the chickpeas a little beforehand, because they were slightly hard. I think I will boil them in their liquid next time before I roast them.

OUTSTANDING FLAVOURS in this recipe when made precisely as written, but you'll wish you made extra as taking the leftovers to work makes me *almost* look forward to Mondays. We prefer bone-in, skinless chicken breasts, use grape tomatoes (less watery than cherry tomatoes), and like to spread the chick pea mixture out to develop crispy bits (so if you double the pea mixture use two pans.) This concoction is definitely crave-worthy.

Rating: 4
Agree with previous reviewers about doubling tomatoes an chickpeas. I also added an orange bell pepper which was AWESOME! We really enjoyed this recipe, but I made one mistake and didn't cook it in a large, shallow enough pan so it took about an extra 15 minutes. I served it with a spinach linguine sauteed in garlic, EVOO, and fresh lemon juice. We also found that we could use 3 BNLS breasts by cutting them in half. All the extra chickpeas + the pasta made 6 servings this way and resulted in making it with organic chicken more affordable.

This is a very easy and versatile recipe. I made it as-is for my cooking co-op and served it with a spinach salad and pitas. There was plenty leftover for our family of 4. We chopped up the chicken and served it in a wrap the next. We also mixed it with leftover chipotle macaroni and cheese a couple days later and it was still delicious. The best thing about this recipe though is the little time it takes to make it.

Loved it. So easy, and was amazed to find that Safeway carried smoked paprika. Next time I'd double the chickpeas and tomatoes, absolutely, and I'd probably use skinless boneless breasts to reduce cooking time. I thought yogurt sauce was necessary to kick the dish up to 4 forks. Next time I'll try marinating the chicken in a bit of the oil first. A keeper.

I REALLY like this dish. I do double the chickpeas and tomatoes, usually add about another 1/2 of the recipe for spices/oil. DO use bone IN chicken breasts on this recipe, boneless skinless get too dry and they have less flavor. My father in law is diabetic and my mother in law likes this for his diet. It's VERY yummy and easy. The greek yogurt is a nice touch but not strictly necessary.

This recipe exceeded expectations. Easy and delicious - can't agree with some of the so-so reviews. Plenty of garlic is one key, the other is to make sure you use smoked paprika. The breasts I used looked like mutants, so 2 sufficed with the same amount of tomatoes, sauce, etc. I actually liked putting in the tomatoes and garbanzos from the start. The tomatoes became wonderfully caramelized and the beans took on a pleasant, nutty flavor. Definitely a keeper.

This was good. The store I went to had both smoked hot paprika and smoked sweet paprika - I went for the latter owing to kids. I agree with others that bone-in chicken will take more than 20 minutes - I went for closer to 30 but added the chickpeas and tomatoes only for the last 20 per the recipe. Overall, the dish is good, not super-great. I found the chickpeas had a strange texture cooked this way. Might play around with the recipe a bit next time with different veggies etc.

I made this once for my husband and I, and we both LOVED it! I served it for dinner with friends, with a side of zucchini risotto, and received great compliments. Made recipe as stated, with greek yogurt sauce. The flavors are warm and comforting, and it was easy to put together. Will make with boneless breasts next time, bone in pieces took longer to cook. Definitely recommend this recipe!

I was looking for a comfort food that leaned toward the healthy side, and this was perfect! I substituted bone-in, skin-on thighs for the breasts (because, really, who wants to be too healthy?!), and they were amazing.

This is a super-easy and quick recipe that is great for a weeknight meal, but impressive enough for company. I usually double the garbanzo beans and tomatoes and often add chunks of seeded red or yellow bell pepper before roasting, too. Usually tone down the spice on the kid's portions. Have made the sauce with yogurt, as listed, or with low or non-fat sour cream if that's what I have on hand. Our whole family loves this (even the two-year-old!) and we have it every couple of weeks now.

Outstanding for an easy, quick meal. I used a variety of heirloom cherry tomatoes, boneless/skinless breasts, and doubled the beans/tomatoes as suggested. The smoke of the paprika and the kick of the cumin/red pepper blend was great -- especially in contrast to the yogurt sauce. My 3 year old loved it; this was definitely not too spicy as written. Looking forward to the leftovers!

I made the recipe as is, except for the cilantro (because I don't like it). It was really good and I would make it again, but there is no way that 4 bone-in chicken breasts are cooked all the way through in 20 minutes. I used a meat thermometer and had to cook them almost 40 minutes. The chicken was very juicy and I served this with orzo (in keeping with the quick and easy theme).

I will be making this again and again. Lovely and fresh, lots of simple flavor, and so quick and easy to prepare. Love the baked cherry tomatoes.

Made this for the first time and it was great. I had 2 bone-in and 2 boneless chicken breasts. At that temparature, the boneless were done in 20 minutes - I removed them and let the rest badk an additional 8 - 10 minutes. Would definitely double-up up the beans and tomatoes for left-overs, or make them without chicken for veggie dish. I would also make extra yogurt mixture. Leftovers were great the next day stuffed in pita with cucumber and yogurt.

This was a very flavorful dish that I will definitely make again. I found the chicken cooking time to take a little longer than the recipe said, but altogether it was a low-prep dish. I used two chicken breasts instead of four, since it was for two adults and two kids. The nice thing about the big chicken breasts was that I could cut off pieces of chicken for the kids that had only a bit of the sauce on it, so they still got to taste it, but it wasn't a turn off for them. The extra yogurt sauce was tasty, but pretty unnecessary. Next time I will again only use two breasts, and I will double the beans and tomatoes -- they were delicious. And this was a really pretty dish too -- nice enough to serve for guests.

Great - made the recipe as described except I used boneless skin on chicken breasts and took them out of the oven a few minutes earlier. I can't imagine not using the smoked paprika (I used pimenton) so try to get your hands on some if you can. I served it with whole wheat cous cous to which I stirred in some of the cilantro and added some chopped chives. Next time I am going to make a cucmber yogurt sauce for fun and a little more contrast. Finally, I used yellow and red tomatoes - it was very pretty with the cilantro garnish.

This is a terrific, flexible recipe. I made it with as many ingredients as I happened to have in the house, which unfortunately didn't include yogurt. It was still very good. I served it with an impromptu brown rice pilaf made with shallots, fennel seeds, white wine and half a chicken bullion cube. Also served some sliced cucumbers on the side for a refreshing crunch. Used canned chopped tomatoes and threw some chopped shallots into the mixture with the garbanzo beans (not sure if this made a difference in taste, but it sure didn't hurt). Chicken breasts were boneless, and I made sure to coat them well. Came out surprisingly tasty, and was definitely easy to prepare.

YUM. This was so good. My kids (teens) and I loved it. I didn't realize I was out of cumin until I had added the paprika, so I used curry powder. I had just bought mini grape tomatoes, which worked great. Didn't bother with the cilantro (OK, I didn't have any of that either) and probably went a little overboard on the spices. I put the sauce as a bed under each breast (I used boneless) and scattered the chickpeas and tomatoes around them, then served couscous on the side. It was easy and delicious!

This was a great recipe...I loved how easy it is AND the healthy factor. I used bone-in, but skinless breasts. They were perfect. I didn't have any issues with greasiness and using the bone-in cuts helped keep the meat moist. I followed the advice of some previous reviewers and doubled both the beans and tomatoes. Glad I did, because it would not have been nearly enough otherwise. Great recipe and terrific the next day, as the flavors melded together wonderfully. Will definitely make this one again, in fact it's already in the meal plan again for this week!

Quite good for casual company. Quick and easy. Chicken is moist and tender. Do use smoked paprika, it really makes the dish.

This was a very nice addition to the chicken rotation. I made this with boneless skinless breasts, and without the cilantro, but otherwise followed the recipe.

Very good recipe, but not quite the BEST on the website. I didn't have smoked paprika, so I did about 90% paprika you get at the store, and 10% chili powder. For the sauce, I was sure to use Greek Yogurt. It was a lot more expensive ($2.99 for 7 oz), but was a great touch. It was very thick, and not sweet. Also, I used boneless, skinless breasts. They were very juicy after 20 minutes, and the vegetables were done perfect. No extra fat on the pan to absorb in the veggies. You could add some onion or root veggies to add texture, but overall, a very unique, easy dish. Leftovers are great, too. A must-try!!!

I'm in the minority here; I thought it was only OK. Actually, it smelled great and looked good. But I thought the yogurt sauce was not good at all and the taste didn't compare to the smell.

I would make this again but only with some significant modifications. The chicken and the spiced oil mixture were very good (I marinated the chicken in it for several hours prior to cooking). And my husband liked the yogurt sauce. However, I did not like the way the garbanzo beans turned out. Because they cooked with the chicken, there was chicken fat (? boneless skinless breasts) all over the beans. They were soggy and had a funny texture. Next time I would cook the garbanzos separately and add some onion and red peppers to the mixture. You also need to increase the amount of garbanzos/tomatoes for 4 people. This was really just enough for two.

I don't remember if I wrote a review for this recipe or not. Tonight as I am reprinting it for the tenth time for family I started reading some of the less than stellar reviews by some members. When I first started making this I could not find smoked paprika so I used regular paprika and red pepper flakes and the cumin. It was good but once I found the smoked paprika it was a whole new expierence. We like a lot of spice in my family so adjusted it to our tastes. I have never used chicken breasts, only chicken thighs (family prefers this) I always double the yogurt sauce. I can make this quickly when I get home from work. Our favorite though is to make the the yogurt sauce and store, marinate the chicken overnight in about two tablespoons of the sauce. I also never use cherry tomatoes, grape only and I double the amount of the garbanzo beans and the tomatoes. This is one of my husbands favorite dishes

we thought this was an easy, delicious meal! perfect meal for a weeknight. We paired it with sliced zucchini cooked with similar spices in a super hot cast iron skillet. Next time, though, I would remove the skin from the chicken breasts. It didn't really get crispy enough to lose its chewy texture, so I didn't eat it, and it prevented the spices from really penetrating the meat.

Delicious, easy and different! I personally would give it 4 forks, but my husband didn't "love" it, so... I actually think this would work well as a make-ahead and bring to work lunch...

Hardly even okay. This was my first real tasteless recipe from Epicurious. Tasted just like chicken, tomatoes, chickpeas, and paprika. No nuance, no nothing. No more than the sum of it's parts. A real bore. Save your chicken from this uninspired end.

I LOVED this! We doubled the spices, did it with a whole roast chicken instead of the halves (so didn't add the beans etc. until the chicken had been cooking at 400 for 30 mins), and ate it over brown rice cooked in bullion water. Delicious. Such an interesting medley of flavors - I never would have thought to roast the garbanzo beans. The ONLY problem is that the chicken, as is the case with most roast chickens, doesn't particularly pick up the flavors of the rub. The yoghurt dressing (a good substitute for gravy) does a lot to address this, though.

The beans and tomatoes are fantastic! Served on a bed of couscous, with the yogurt sauce on the side. the chicken is good, but I could split a breast with my husband and eat twice as many beans and tomatoes. Big hit for both of us. My kids, on the other hand, weren't too thrilled with the spicing, but you know how kids are!

I think it tastes fine--I've made it twice now, and you get a good yield based on how little time it takes to prepare. But the best thing about this recipe is that it multiplies well. Just had a party for 40 people and this was such an easy main dish to make for that many people without sacrificing quality or flavor.

Lovely, clean flavors. The chicken breasts I had were supermarket and large so I started them first using the Cooks Illustrated recipe as a guide (butter/salt mix under the skin and well peppered underside) and then the spiced oil (definitely use the smoked paprika - Penzey's is good) over the skin. Roasted about 20 minutes before tossed in the garbanzos and tomatoes. Then continued as written. After the chicken rested, I cut it off the bone and plated with beans/tomatoes as base, chicken sliced and fanned out over and yogurt sauce drizzled over all with the cilantro garnish. Served with rice tossed with pepper and cilantro and formed in a custard cup. This, with a hearts of romaine salad and toasted country bread drizzled with olive oil and rubbed with garlic, made a simple, yet impressive weeknight meal for some good friends.

i made this once and it was totally 'meh,' but intrigued me. So this time i marinated the chicken with the oil in fridge for 2 hours and crisped the skin/browned the breasts before i put them in the oven. i also used grape tomatoes, not cherry and they were way sweeter.

Found this to be only OK. Not sure why we didn't like this as much as others did. But we generally found it uninteresting. Perhaps it is because I sub'd regular paprika for the smoked paprika?

This was definitely underwhelming, given the reviews. Though my father liked it more than my fiance, nobody thought it was spectacular. I would agree with ceylon22 about the raw spices in yogurt, and I found that parts of the chicken dried out far before the center was done enough to be safe (and far before the 20 minutes were up).

Made this last week for the family and we weren't really impressed. I thought it was ok, my brother liked it more than my husband did and my kids wouldn't touch the chicken. We did not particularly like the taste of raw spices in the yogurt. For an even easier recipe, substitute harissa sauce (I always have the Wild Thyme brand on hand) for the spiced oil. Won't be making this again.

This is as simple and delicious as it gets. The only thing to chop was the cilantro. I used boneless chicken breasts.

One addition: I forgot to say that I used nonfat yogurt, to cut the fat. Also, I was worried it would be too spicy for my kids, who are 13 and 10, but they loved it!

This was delicious and incredibly quick and easy to make. It took me about 45 minutes, start to finish. I didn't have smoked paprika, but it was delicious with the regular stuff. I used boneless breasts cut in half through their thickness and cooked them for a little more than half the recommended time. The oil rub seals in the juices. My teenage son, who normally prefers dark meat, kept remarking how moist the breast meat was. I cooked it in a pyrex baking dish and brought it to the table right in the pan. I served it with couscous, pita, and a green salad with feta chunks and kalamata olives. I did eat it as a sandwich the next day, with the leftover salad stuffed inside as well, and it was wonderful. I will definitely be making this again--and again.

Im not sure this even counts as cooking because all I did was chop some garlic. This is such a simple and great recipe.

Tasty combination of interesting flavors. Substituted with regular paprika, boneless chicken breasts and doubled the tomatoes, using half grape tomatoes and half fresh local heirloom beefsteak type (chopped). It made the heat a lot less, which I and our guests enjoyed, although my husband likes it hotter. :) We have made it in the past with canned tomatoes and loved it also.

Rating: 4
Oh wow, this is going to be in regular rotation! I love the way the tomatoes complimented the paprika! Modifications were as follows: - Accidentally used 6 garlic cloves - Doubled the crushed red pepper - Used 16 ounces of grape tomatoes because roasted tomatoes are amazing - Cut the fresh cilantro from 1 cup to 1/8th cup of dried cilantro

Rating: 4
Easy, delicious, and prepared from ingredients I already had on hand. I substituted quartered tomatoes from my garden for the cherry tomatoes specified in the recipe. I also drained the plain yogurt through a coffee filter to get out some of the excess liquid; the resulting sauce was creamy and rich.

I used chicken breasts that were too large to soak up the flavor, and would also try to rub the marinade under the skin (in direct contact with the meat). Next time I try it, I will marinate it for a couple hours to see if the flavor penetrates better. This was delicious as a pita sandwich the next day!

Very good with extra points for how easy it is & how few fresh ingredients you need! I was not impressed by the sauce, until it was paired with the dish & it was all delicious. I am a veg but the boyfriend isn't & we both loved this served with lemon- almond brown rice & a medit. salad. Next time I will add zuchini or maybe onion to the veggies. I did notice some of the chickpeas got a little hard, anyone know how to avoid that? Try this, you will love it!

Leftovers? I don't think so! Yum! I loved the bean and tomato mixture and will double them next time; delicious with the sauce. The chicken was very moist, tender, and flavorful. I did rub the chicken with the flavored oil about 2 hours before cooking and then popped it in the oven 25 minutes before I expected everyone home to eat; it was very flavorful and tender. I served it on couscous with steamed veggies. Excellent!

Great recipe for moist and very flavorful chicken, even better the next day. Husband loved it, and he can be very picky about his chicken. I marinated this for at least 1 hour. The garbanzo beans and tomatoes where a nice addition. Maybe potatoes and onions next time. The yogurt sauce was kind of blah.

Truly fantastic recipe. I threw this together in 10 minutes and used drained diced tomatoes instead of the cherry and it was excellent. I would even try rubbing a whole chicken and some potatos with the spicy oil.

fyi, you can make greek style yogurt with regular nonfat yogurt - just set a few cups of yogurt in a sieve with cheesecloth, and let rest for about an hour. voila! thicker, creamier yogurt! other than that, the recipe was fantastic! would definitely make again.

The texture of this chicken was outstanding! I let it marinate for about an hour before roasting. Also, it couldn't be simpler. I discovered that smoked paprika is not to my liking, so I will try regular paprika next time, or maybe just use a little less.

Even better than I thought it would be! I also used only two boneless skinless breasts but kept other amounts as written. Everything was incredibly moist and flavorful. I didn't like the yogurt sauce when I tasted it on its own, but it was a perfect compliment to the rest of the meal. Next time I'm going to double the amount of sauce. This one is going into regular rotation.

This is an amazing dish. My sister made it for me last week and I had to have it again! Made it last night for my fiance and I and made some modifications/additions based on what I had. Had chicken thighs and breasts attached with bone in and chicken came out nice and moist. I did not have crushed red pepper so just used cayenne pepper. Also added sliced black olives, summer yellow squash and zucchini. Served over couscous. Delicious meal that was easy and relatively healthy! DO make this one!

I've already made this 3 times now. I prefer it with boneless, skinless breasts and have never had a problem with them drying out. I use a ton more garlic and always double the amount of sauce AND double the amount of the chickpea/tomato mixture. I typically serve this over plain bulgur pilaf (bulgur cooked in chicken broth). In fact, the beans/tomatoes are SO good that I made them alone--without the chicken--and they were fabulous for a vegetarian dinner. This is perhaps my most favorite recipe in recent months.

I loved it. The flavors were great. I used sour cream instead of yogurt and thinned it out with milk, since that's what I had on hand. I also cooked it for a bit longer to give the beans a more nutty flavor.

This recipe is great and I will add it to my rotation. I changed the recipe only slightly: used 2 boneless chicken breasts instead of 4 with bone. Added double the amt of crushed red pepper. I think I added a bit too much cilantro, so will cut back on that. I also used greek yogurt for the yogurt sauce and it was very good. My husband who is very picky loved it. Did not have a problem with the chicken drying out either. I served it with basmati rice and took the extras for work the next day. Co-workers commented on how good it looked and how good it smelled!

The beans and tomatoes were, for me, the best part of this. The yogurt didn't do much for me. I think next time, if I bothered to make it again, I'd use chicken thighs - the usual drying out of the breasts (even with the skin and bones) happened for me, unfortunately.

Fantastic and easy! I doubled the recipe and cooked on two sheets. I also used a mix of heirloom cherry tomatoes. Made sure to spread the beans/tomato to one layer, that probably helped with uneven cooking mentioned previously. Definitely smoked paprika is important, if you haven't tried it, do, it is VERY different. The yogurt sauce tasted bland and I almost added salt but thought to wait until trying it all together - glad I did. On its own the sauce is "eh, whatever" but once combined with the flavors of the chicken, perfect. While everyone loved the chicken, the surprise was everyone LOVED the garbanzo beans and tomatoes. This is officially on the rotation!

INSTANT FAMILY FAVORITE! Wonderful recipe. Works well if you assemble everything in advance (several hours or all day), which allows the flavors to marinate and makes for a perfect dish for entertaining.

Made this for dinner last night and thought it was really delicious. I was wondering about using regular paprika but went out and bought the sweet smoked paprika instead and it made the dish.

This was great! I made a few minor changes: used 2 boneless chicken breasts, 12 oz roma tomatoes cut into cherry tomato-sized pieces, and added 2 sliced carrots that I microwaved for a couple of minutes so they would be completely cooked. I only had hot smoked paprika, so I used the full amount and only about 1/8 tsp. crushed red pepper. Everything turned out fantastic; perfect amount of heat, everything cooked just right (in 20 min), and just enough leftover veggies and yogurt for a lunch pita the next day.

When I found smoked Paprika - there was hot or bittersweet - which is correct here? I bought hot - but it was SO HOT that I used 1 tsp of it and 2 tsp of regular hungarian paprika as I didn't want the dish to go too spicy (and we like spicy!). Next time - I might go 2 tsp hot and 1 regular. WE LOVED IT - even the 2 year old. mmmmmmmm - the house smells wonderful now too.

i make a one-pot stew/dish with somewhat similar flavors - and a much lower ratio of chicken to everything else, for budget reasons mainly, but it's good for the environment too :-). i saute 1-2 onions, lots of garlic, 1-2 tsps tomato paste, and herbs/spices (crushed red pepper, def.; a greek tinge w/ oregano is nice; i've also done cumin and cinnamon to go moroccan). then add 3/4 lb of cut-up chicken thighs, brown them; then add 1 can garbanzo beans, 1 can diced tomatoes, 1 cup or so of brown rice, and 1 can- plus of chicken broth/water and let it all stew together till cooked. it's no-fail, really. this sounds good too, but it's amazing how the meat- to-everything-else ratio is so lopsided in this recipe!

Instead of the yogurt sauce I used Trader Joe's Tzatzki sauce and it was perfect. I served the chicken with naan and the entire meal had such great flavors and the chicken was extremely tender.

I made this with only 2 boneless skinless breasts, fat free plain yogurt, and omitted the 1/2 cup of cilantro at the end (I couldn't imagine using more- perhaps if you used the full 4 breasts in the recipe??). My husband who likes spicy food found this to be pretty spicy so I think I would leave out the red pepper flakes next time and use only 1/2 tbsp of paprika. I will try using onion instead of chickpeas next time as the chickpeas got pretty dry. Otherwise tasty and easy, yogurt sauce was great!

Great ingredients and spectacular presentation when coming out of the oven. I would definitely make this again only I would double the tomatoes, garbanzo and cilantro.

This is a great issue. I've tried 3 recipes within the week and they're 5 star's. I love cilantro in this recipe only next time I'll double the ingredients. The chicken smelled yummy and the presentation looked fancy coming out of the oven.

This was surprisingly tasty- my only comments would be that next time I would double to tomato/c'pea/sauce mixture- and my chicken took 30 mins vs. 20 in a fairly powerful Viking stove. Also, it sounds like there's a collective dislike for cilantro, but I found it really added to this dish.

Loved this dish. I followed the recipe with the exception of only using two chicken breasts. They were boneless skinless and turned out great. I liked the amount of beans and tomatoes and would most likely make it this way again. Very quick and easy.

why does everything have cilantro in it? is there something else to use? I can't stand the stuff.

Garlicky, spices are great, and easy, easy, easy...Yogurt sauce is a delicious complement. Of course, I had garlic breath the whole next day, but it was so worth it! Leftovers even better than the first day.
