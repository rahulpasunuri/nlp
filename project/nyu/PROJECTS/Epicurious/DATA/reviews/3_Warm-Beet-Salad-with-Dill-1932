Omit the leaves and you have a great recipe. Roasting beets is so easy and yummy - any simple dressing will do, but I especially like the dill with the vinegar & oil. This is the only way I make beets now!

I thought this dish was just okay. The beets and onions were good, but I didn't care for the beet greens -- too bitter for me. If I made this again, I think I'd use spinach instead.

Sometimes simple dishes are best, as shown by this great salad. I doubled this recipe using red and golden beets--prepared them separately and made a beautiful display.

I made this recipe for a barbecue lunch and it perfectly matched. The taste of roasted beets is surprising compared to the coocked one. I sprinkled everything with fresh grind black/white pepper and did not use onion.

This salad was so easy to make. The only change I made was to add a little salt and pepper. Next time I'll lower the oven temp a little and roast a chicken while the beets are cooking. A keeper. I also like the roasted beet salad with spinach and ginger vinaigrette on Epicurious.
