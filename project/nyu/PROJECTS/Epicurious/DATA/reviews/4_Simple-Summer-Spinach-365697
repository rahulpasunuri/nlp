Yummy and quick. I left the garlic in and also added some red onions. Use lemon juice sparingly as it can be too overwhelming. Great side to any meal - just ask Popeye!

This was so yummy. As I don't have any kids I didn't bother to cut up the spinach. I also made it into a lunch by adding chickpeas. The lemon juice really made is something special.

Nice light side dish. I placed the spinach on top of wild rice and added a few pine nuts to it for crunchiness.

My new favorite sauteed spinach recipe.
