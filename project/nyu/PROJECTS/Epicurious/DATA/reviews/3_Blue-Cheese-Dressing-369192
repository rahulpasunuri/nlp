This is basically a good recipe. It needed a little more and I added about a 1/2 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. It should be refrigerated for at least an hour after mixing the ingredients to get it to firm up a bit - otherwise it was too runny.

This was perfect - they nailed exactly the taste I imagine when I hear "blue cheese dressing." Used Maytag blue with a generous hand and 1 tsp salt. It could probably use more salt, but we're trying to take it easy on the salt over here.
