This was delicious! I used lemon balm straight out of my garden. I never know what to do with that stuff. It seemed like a lot of oil to put in the pesto, so I used 1/2. It turned out very well that way.

Very good! Just be careful not to overcook the green beans, as they go from perfect to mushy in no time flat. Remove smaller ones first, as they will cook faster.
