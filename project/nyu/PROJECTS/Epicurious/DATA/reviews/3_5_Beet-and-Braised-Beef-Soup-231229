I am not Jewish, Middle Eastern, Asian or whatever. That being said, I have no problem stealing good recipes from any culture on earth. If your cultural or religious laws demand something, fine, follow them. This is an excellent soup. Just omit the ingredients that you object to. You'll still have a damn fine soup.

We love this recipe at my house. I often make vegetarian borscht so this was my first meat-based one and it's delicious and warming. I tend to add more vinegar than called for. I also sometimes leave out the beans. Even with soaking, sometimes their skins come off and it's not visually appealing. As far as cooking time, I find if I do salt the meat ahead of time, it cooks faster. I also over the years have cut back on the amount of meat. I add closer to 2lbs...If I don't have the parsnips on hand, I don't seek them out. Basically, this recipe is a great baseline to improv from and the recipe for the dressing that goes with the salad on the menu is amazing...

For us, the really was a pretty feh meal, particularly for the expense and time involved in the prep. I used beet cooking liquid as suggested by the cook from PA. After much tweaking with salt, pepper, and dill, the broth got some body (I can't imagine what would result from the use of plain water). It certainly is healthful (we used fat-free sour cream) and hearty (have some black bread on the side) but in the main, I won't make this again. I wonder what, if anything, "went wrong"?

P.S. I also make the soup without meat (vegetarian), and it is also DROP DEAD. However, I usually shred the beets, but from now on, I will dice them; it's better somehow. I also forgot to mention that all the prep work is well worth it.

I have made this many times over the years, and it is always a hit. However, I don't use plain water. Instead, I clean the beets,put them in a pot and cover them with water. After simmering until tender, I take them out of the pot SAVING THE LIQUID and peel the beets. After all the prep with the meat, etc, I use the beet water for the liquid for the soup. This makes the soup very rich. In the past, I have used a large can of sauerkraut but used the cabbage this time as per the recipe. Both are great. Next time, I will use more liquid, because with all the ingredients, there isn't much soup. Anyway, whatever, the end result is DROP DEAD DELISH! There is so much, that I'll have it for the remainder of the winter.

Just made it for Hanuka dinner. Everybody liked it and the sour cream is a worthy addition (I'm not religious, so I don't care). My main comment is that it takes much longer to cook. About an hour longer. After that, the meat was falling off the bone, the beans were sweet and almost breaking apart and the beats were very tender. Excellent meal for a rainy day.

I thought this recipe sounded delicious so I gave it a try for Chanukah dinner (latkes and the salad with black radish on the side), but I was disappointed. I'm thinking that maybe I used too much water, because the broth didn't have much taste. I added some vinegar at the end, but not alot - maybe 3 Tbsp. for the whole pot. Used sour cream and dill as garnish which was good and I think I would really like this recipe if the soup part was more flavorful. Any thoughts?

I am planning on making this, but could use other opinions as to when and how much red vinegar to add. Thank you.

I made this in 2006 and froze it. Had the last container last night and was reminded how fantastic it was. I didn't use sour cream, but for extra zing added some Liquid Aminos for saltiness. Even my 6-year old ate it all up.

I have made this dish with variations many times, however, my comment about some of the comments is this: Tradition is wonderful to hold on to but don't get crazy vit da trrradition! If u don't like sumting, don use it! Simple...

OK. I changed it again and upped the forks. Hubby insisted I "redux". Still brineing in Asian spice mixture, still incorporating some shortcuts:If it ain't broken why fix it? New changes: used canned beets(yeah I know the heresy of it all BUT it worked; nice way to use up those staples that make ya wonder why o why did I buy this?!;)). Added 2 med.sized leek whites just cause I had 'em. I could see adding potatos if only I wasn't doing lo-carb. Used gandules this time but think I'll stick to a meatier/starchier bean next time.BTW, using creme fraiche instead of sour cream is luverly for those without dietary concerns of whatever kind.This is definitely a " Ya don't have to be an orthodox Jew to love Levy's" moment. My only question: Does anyone think that this can be frozen (perhaps minus the beets)? Would love to keep this on hand for company when rushed.

Lovely dish for fall or winter. Changes I made: I brined the meat overnight which meant I did not add additional salt in cooking. Also I coated with flour and browned meat in bacon fat for additional flavor and color. Used 1 lb. of meat and doubled the veggie amounts. Replaced 1.5 cups of water with a combo of red wine and port.No dill used- brineing liquid included Chinese 5 spice powder.Replaced cabbage with sauerkraut. The recipe as written doesn't say when to add red wine vinegar or amt. As I used sauerkrautI omitted the vinegar. Where I to use fresh cabbage I'd add approx. 1.5-2 tsps to pan glazing.Finally in addition to 1 hr range simmer, braised @ 350 for 2 hrs in oven. The meat fell off the bone. Lucious.The final result was more stew than suop. I'd make this for company in a heartbeat.

This was a great dish. It took me a long time to make it, but it was certainly worth it. Note to other reviewers: you don't have to be Jewish to make this dish. Besides, sour-cream is just for garnish, you don't have to use it.

I'm not jewish but this recipe sounds interesting to me

As a non-traditional Jew, I have made variations of this recipe. It's a real crowd pleaser. For tradition-observing Jews, don't use sour cream!

Rating: 0
I agree with the first reviewer. A person recommending the use of sour cream with a beef-based soup, is not an authority on Jewish tradition. This recipe would not be acceptable to any tradition-observing Jewish cook, for any occasion; certainly not for Hanukkah

I wouldn't even CONSIDER trying this dinner. Anyone who says that a beef soup for Hannukah should be garnished with sour cream has no credibility whatsoever. Moreover, Hanukah without latkes would be like Thanksgiving without turkey! Downright depressing! Some traditions are there for a reason -- they're yummy!
