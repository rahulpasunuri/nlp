Excellent flavors and a good way to cook grass-fed beef. I used this recipe for my first attempt at cooking grass-fed beef and it turned out well, though I cooked a little longer so that it wasn't as rare. Follow the directions and you can cook it without overcooking it.

Bravo to Chef Jay for this delicious recipe. I cooked the steak according to the instructions and it was absolutely perfectly done,medium rare. The sauce was aromatic and exotic. Fantastic!I applaud the use of grass-fed beef as both healthful and ethical.
