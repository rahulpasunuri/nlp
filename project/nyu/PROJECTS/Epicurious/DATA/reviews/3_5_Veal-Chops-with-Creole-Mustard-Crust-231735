Not sure who mysonvaughn is (no review by that name is still in the history here), but if it makes him/her feel any better, this works great with pork chops as well. Actually, if I think of it, maybe better--I'd think this would overpower veal a bit.

I love the tasty tender baby-cow and mysonvaughn has no idea what he is missing.

The allspice was a revelation, and the cooking method really good. But the amount of topping was far too much. I'd cut it by a half or two thirds.

I didn't care for it.

Fabulous! We doctored some Maille Mustard with Worcestershire and Tabasco and used chives from the garden instead of scallions. Served with red rice (the Lee Brothers) and baked okra with onions (Edna Lewis)

We have made this recipe twice, both times it was wonderful. We are planning on making it for a large dinner party we are having. We will let you know how it goes.

My Family loved this recipe. Be sure to make the bread crumbs from scratch as recommended. I also used a high end creole mustard which made a big difference. I doubled the garlic and added chives with the green onion. A winner!!

I haven't made the recipe yet but I had to rate it four forks nonetheless to offset the politicized one-fork rating of mysonvaughn.

John Avizienius also mentioned that the veal was 'effin delicious and him being a carnivore was nature's plan.

This was such an easy recipe. The chops were tender and very flavorful. My teenagers loved them too!
