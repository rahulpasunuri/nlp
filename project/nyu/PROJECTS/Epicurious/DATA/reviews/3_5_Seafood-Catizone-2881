Added the white wine as suggested by another reviewer. Perfect using just scallops! A regular dish in our house and good for company.

It was my first time cooking with shrimp and scallops at home, and it turned out excellent. Super quick and easy too. Based on comments from other reviews, I used 1/4 cup white wine, more grated parm, and backed off on the fennel (I used ~1/2 tsp). I really enjoyed the subtle fennel flavor, and plan to use closer to 1 tsp next time, as listed in the original recipe.

I will preface this by saying I have never rated anything 4 forks here on Epicurious, that is why I rated this three. But this is a very fast, easy and really tasty pasta dish. Following the advice of other reviewers, I added 1/4 c white wine, and approximately 1/4 c half and half to the shrimp. I also omitted the extra 2 TBS olive oil (as per other reviews). Also, I used only about 1/4 tsp of fennel seeds, and those I chopped very finely, as we are not big fennel fans. It was very good, very easy, and I will definitely make it again!

Super easy and tasty! I used fresh basil (about 3 tablespoons) and added some white wine (about 1/4 cup). Did not add the additional 2 tablespoons of oil in the end. Also, I only used shrimp as it was the only seafood I had on hand. I followed the rest as written. This will become a regular!

This was quick, easy and delicious - a little different than scampi, thanks to the fennel. I eliminated the last 2 T of olive oil, used angel hair pasta and did add a splash of white wine to the shrimp, but otherwise made this recipe as written.

After assessing the ingredient list, I always scroll past the instructions on how to make the food turn a different color to the reviews, which are too valuable to ignore! We tried this recipe with a wee dash of cream for the sauce - it's a keeper!

This was so easy to make and everyone raved about it. I used a little less oil and butter and skipped the fennel and added more fresh basil.

I use only 2 Tablespoons of olive oil as well. Either way, it is delicious

I've made this dish countless times and still love it. I only use two tablespoons of olive oil. It's a regular at dinner.

This made a wonderful light summer supper. I substituted sweet basil (dried) in the dish and sprinkled each serving with fresh basil (good!) I also did not use as much olive oil as called for (about 2 tablespoons total) and I used about 1/4 teaspoon of the fennel seeds, as not to overpower the sauce. I used freshly grated parm and romano cheese (double the amount) and have also made it using white wine and it was equally as good.

AS A NOVICE CHEF, THE SIMPLICITY OF THIS RECIPE WAS PERFERCT! I ADDED A 1/4 CUP OF WHITE WINE, OMITTED THE FENNEL AND DOUBLED UP ON FRESH PARM. I SERVED IT WITH A RICH & BUTTERY CHARDONNAY, A SPINACH SALAD WITH GOAT CHEESE AND VIENNA BREAD;I PREPARED IT FOR THE NEW MAN IN MY LIFE, AND THE RECIPE DEFINATELY LIVED UP TO THE OLD ADAGE, "A WAY TO A MAN'S HEART IS HIS STOMACH..."

Great fast dinner. Added white wine and little neck clams. Should have used fresh basil. Omitted the fennel seeds. So easy and great tasting, can't go wrong! A little crusty bread and a glass of wine and you've got a super simple meal!

Lovely! I served it with sauted artichoke hearts, avacado fruit salad, and foccacia. Even my kid sister loved it. Came out a little too watery, but was still marvelous.

Quick, easy and delicious - what more could you want? I am fortunate enough to have a fresh seafood market close by - this recipe was worthy of fresh sweet scallops. My family loved it too. But beware! the taste of the fennel is addictive!

This dish was delicious! I added a little extra of everything just to make sure there was enough sauce for the pasta. I cut back on the fennel and basil just a bit and used homemade parsley/parmesan linguine, doubled-up on the scallops and skipped the shrimp. Fabulous turnout!

Wonderful low fat recipe. Have made many times. When tossing the pasta, we add lemon juice for extra flavor. This will be a "keeper" recipe in our home.

This dish was okay. I probably overcooked the pasta, thus it stuck together and made it difficult to "toss". The sauce had wonderful flavor, I just wish it made a bit more to coat the pasta better.
