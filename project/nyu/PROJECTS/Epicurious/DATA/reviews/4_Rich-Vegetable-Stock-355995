I have made this several times in the last few weeks and agree that it is great. I always double it and agree with the reviewer that you could -- and I will next time -- add more water because it is indeed a rich flavor.

This is by far the best vegetable stock I've every made. Very rich and robust... an excellent base to use for soups, stews, bean dishes. Simply delish!

I doubled the water quantity and that resulted in lots of flavourful stock to keep on hand in the fridge. The intense flavour can definitely hold up to the extra water. An excellent recipe!

An extraordinary, flavorful stock. I used it for the Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie and for a lentil soup. It made both dishes fantastic

This makes a delicious and deeply flavored vegetarian stock. The wine flavor is pronounced. I used Cabernet Sauvignon. I haven't decided how I'll use the stock yet, but I think it would be excellent for a French Onion soup or something along that line. Mainly I wanted to post a comment to warn anyone planning to use this to make the vegetable pie, as recommended in the magazine: I followed the recipe slavishly, including covering the stock for the 45 minute simmering period, and only ended up with 2-1/4 cups rather than the 3-1/2 they say you'll get (and which you need for the adjoining recipe). I would either double the recipe or just add more water to the existing recipe. The rich flavor would probably survive a little thinning.
