I made this recipe for a Valentine's Day potluck that called for pink and red food. I'm gluten free and thought this would be the perfect dish. I soaked the radicchio in icy cold salted water for about half an hour before putting it in the recipe to take some of the bitterness out. It seemed to work great because I don't find it bitter at all, although everyone's taste buds are different. I would definitely make this again for myself.

We enjoyed this. I had a HUGE head of radicchio from my CSA. I didn't use quite all of it, and I increased all the other ingredients by 50% to match it and feed more people as an entree. Yes, radicchio is bitter, but it mellows somewhat in the risotto. We always love risotto, but remember the flavor is often simple--only two or three flavors. So having the radicchio dominate was okay. I did add about 1/2 tsp of dried thyme. This will definitely be our go-to recipe the next time radicchio comes home in the bin.

I wanted to love this recipe. I made it as written -- but it really steered me wrong. I guess I didn't know what a "large" head of radicchio would look like and went to Whole Foods and chose one of the larger ones that weighed in at one pound. It completely overwhelmed the flavors of the risotto and it was inedibly bitter. Oh well, waste of good ingredients. At least the seared sea scallops and the roasted baby carrots (from this site) were great!

good stuff. i can't see serving it as a side since the flavour is so assertive -- i think it works best as a first course on its own.

While in Montepulciano, Italy, I had this wonderful and interesting radicchio risotto and so when I got home wanted to find a similar recipe. This is it! Easy, delicious, and a nice change from usual risottos. We serve it often with marinated flank steak and grilled asparagus.

Great--I added frozen spinach and carrots to add sweetness, and it was delightful

Very very nice. I had a leftover radicchio and wasn't sure what to do with it, then found this recipe. The risotto was tasty and easy to make. Made it with roasted peppers and it was a lovely and delicious meal.
