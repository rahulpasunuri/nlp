I made extra sauce so there was a lot to baste with and there was sauce when I served the chicken over cous cous (my choice). My chicken breasts were quite large and cooked an extra 10 minutes. Next time I will add dried apricots to the sauce.

OMG - this is such an easy and delicious recipe. This is now one of my "go to" meals for dinner parties. DELICIOUS. I highly recommend good quality kosher chicken breasts. Also, Trader Joe's whole grain mustard is excellent. Omitted the butter. It was completely unnecessary. Don't skip the broiling step - it really helps the sauce bubble up and carmelize. Also, be sure to remember that if they're thicker breasts, you'll need more cooking time.

I've made this lots of times and was just thinking about making it again tonight. The flavors are well-rounded with the sweetness of the jam, the tangy bite of the mustard, and the toasted nuttiness of the almonds. Yum. My favorite side dish for this is mashed potatoes. I love how they taste with the sauce and almonds.

I would probably go to 2.5 stars but cannot round to 3. Very easy but the sauce has very little oomph. I will try it again but with a spicier mustard.

This recipe is quite good and very easy to fix. It's a good dish for a crowd because the preparation is minimal. Do not overcook!

This was so good and so easy! Great weeknight meal. Used 1-1/2 tsp instead of 1-1/2 tbsp per other reviewer's advice.

I was a little worried about this recipe after reading some reviews on here. Still, I made it, following the advice to replace the mustard with ginger powder (just a pinch) and reducing the soy sauce (to 2tsp.) I served with orzo and steamed vegetables. It was a very simple, tasty meal!

Rating: 3
I fixed this for a large gathering (x6) so I used a lot of soy sauce and I believe that's the problem. I plan to make a single recipe and use a lot less soy - could it be a misprint and be teaspoons instead of tablespoons?

I really like these even though I'm not a chicken fan. May try next time with chicken thighs or I'm thinking pork chops. Sauce was absolutely delicious and I plan on doubling next time to pour over side dish of rice.

I served this for guests and got rave reviews. It was pretty with the toasted almonds and super juicy! I would definitely try it again.

Rating: 2
At first I wasn't impressed by this chicken -- the sauce was much thinner than I predicted (although I spooned the sauce which pooled around the chicken back onto the chicken prior to broiling, which helped), and the sauce did not have as much oomph as I expected. But putting things in perspective, this is a snap to prepare, I usually have the ingredients on hand, the chicken was juicy, and the almonds gave it a lovely touch. So I would make it again.

I made this recipe the first time as written and liked it well enough that I decided to try it again and play with it. The hot Chinese mustard idea from a previous reviewer was a good one, so I ran with that: I carmelized about 1/2-3/4 C sliced onions in butter (just enough to give the sauce some additional body and flavor) before adding the preserves, soy sauce and hot mustard, and threw in some powdered ginger (since I that was all I had on hand -- some fresh ginger would be even better, I'm sure). The rest was prepared the same as the recipe indicated and I served it with rice and mandarin salad. An easy dish that you can dress up or down as the occasion calls for it!

Very tasty and a refreshing change from most chicken preparations. When pressed for time it is a great recipe.

I used raspberry jam as I didn't have apricot preserves and it turned out great. Also skipped the mustard and added a bit of ground ginger instead. Don't skip the almonds if at all possible as they add great texture and visual appeal.

I think I would rate this dish 2.5 forks. It's good, but it's not amazing. It's good for a weekday meal and serves the basic purpose of being quick to prepare and tastey. The sauce can be played with lots. I highly recommend adding the juice of half a lemon and 2-3 sliced green onions to the sauce. Next time I'll try adding curry powder or chicken powder.

This is a simple tasty dish. I took the advice of jenavira from Livermore and added fresh lemon juice to the sauce . Used Smucker's 100% Fruit Apricot spreadable fruit and did not find the sauce too sweet. We'll have it again.

Great weeknight meal. Very quick and easy. I would make more sauce for next time to dip and serve over rice.

This was not very interesting to me or my family. Followed recipe, but sauce lacks something. Just a plain chix breast with a sweetish topping.

This recipe is easy enough to make on a weeknight, but it is delicious enough to look forward to! I used sugar free apricot preserves, which worked out fine. I will probably skip the butter next time, and although it will add another step, some chopped parsley would make it look prettier. Don't skip the almonds, or the few minutes under the broiler which browned the top a bit. Good and simple!

As someone mentioned below this recipe is missing something, in my case I felt like a little citrus could be added to it considering it came out very sweet. It did come out though very moist.

Really nice, my family loved it. Only suggstions are to make a bit more of the sauce to pour over the chicken and to make sure to use a high end apricot preserve as opposed to a supermarket brand.

YUM! Served this with the jasmin herbed rice and green beans with lemon and oil also on the site, and all were hits! Leftovers the next day were equally fabulous. This probably goes without saying, but watch the almonds carefully. They burn.

I thought this was one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had. The chicken came out of the oven moist and tender and the sauce was wonderful. I didn't have soy sauce so I used worstechire and I also substituted spicy chinese mustard. It came out with a bit more of a kick, but it was appreciated all around. Will definitely be making this again!

I won't make this one again !!! I followed the recipe step by step, it may be easy but not worth the time saving. The chicken came out very dry and generally very very bland except a too sweet taste.

Rating: 3
This is so good it's hard to believe how easy it is to make! I overcooked the chicken the first time so I decreased the baking time and just checked the internal temp before broiling and it was perfect. Loved it with the Watercress, Pear & Walnut Salad w/ Poppy Seed Dressing and sauted asparagus. Yum!

Rating: 3
Very quick and easy after a long day of work. Children and husband alike loved it. Note: I forgot the recipe and was preparing from memory..For the sauce I used Apricot preserves, lemon juice and soy sauce. poured 3/4 sauce over while baking skinless boneless breast and the remainder when removed from oven along with toasted almonds. YUMMY!

Rating: 3
I have to give this one a 'thumbs up' as it met all my requirements of being quick, easy and the family liked it! I had to substitute the apricot preserves with pineapple-apricot as that was what I had in the pantry. I will definetly make this one again and again!

I followed this recipe exactly as written, and my end result was just mediocre. It wasn't horrible, just so-so. I will not be making this again.

I used pecans instead of almonds, because that's what I had on hand. I thought it tasted great and will make it again, although I think next time I may reserve some of the sauce and cook it down to serve with the chicken.

This recipe was quite good an easy addition to a weekday meal. I would add a touch of curry powder to the preserves mixture in future to add a bit of kick, I would also up the mustard by at least 1/4 tsp. I also added one sweet potato to the balsamic roasted potatoes suggested as an accompanimentwhich was really good tasty.

Usually I get a little irritated when folks prepare an Epicurious dish with so many substitutions that it doesn't remotely resemble the original--I know cooking is all about tweaking, but people really get crazy! But Here's what happened: I set out to prepare this dish thinking I had apricot preserves in my fridge only to find that I didn't, even after I defrosted my chicken (which, by the way, were skinless bone-in breasts). So I made due with what I had, which was spicy mango chutney. Other than that MAJOR difference, I left the recipe alone and really liked it. I highly suggest this change to those who thought this recipe was bland and that the sauce was too thin!!

No thanks. The apricot mixture slid right off the chicken pieces and onto the pan where it burned and made a big mess. I have other apricot/chicken recipes where the chicken is braised with apricots that were much more succesful.

Really easy, really really good. We both loved it, and my husband does not really care for apricots. I too would have like a thicker sauce but found it delicious all the same. We almost forgot to add the almonds, but luckily did not as they really made the dish. Served with the balsalmic roasted potato wedges (same page in Gourmet mag) but was not as excited about them.

A simple weeknight dinner, quick to prepare, and leftovers reheated well. Would've liked the sauce to be thicker and coat the chicken better, but it still tasted delicious.

Don't be mislead by the low-ish rating! I think this is due to confusion about the apricot component, when people responded without "dotting their forks." True, a few people didn't love this but I thought it was excellent, and really didn't tinker (for once!). About the only thing I did differently was to toast the almonds in a skillet where I could more easily keep an eye on them.

I was amazed at how easy this recipe is! It took less than 30 minutes to get dinner on the table and everyone absolutely loved it. In fact, we loved the sauce so much that we made it again and used it to baste a boneless pork tenderloin on the grill the next night!
