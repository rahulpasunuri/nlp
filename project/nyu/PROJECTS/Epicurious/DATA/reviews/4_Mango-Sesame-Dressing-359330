I used Trader Joe's mango chutney with ginger. Excellent! I used it all for the Asian Chicken Noodle Salad.

Delicious! The perfect blend. I used a peach chutney I had made, and it turned out great. Will definitely make this again.

This salad dressing was devine. A reviewer said a ginger mango chutney worked great. I've thought the peach chutney I made needed more ginger (peach tree in yard), so I added some fresh ginger. As suggested, I reduced the oil to 1/3 cup and used the sesame oil. We used this on lettuce, chicken, green beans, tomatoes, black olives and avocados. Yum!!!!!

Amazing! Great with Chicken or shrimp and maybe even salmon. I made it for the Grilled Asian Chix & Veggies recipe. Tonight I'm doing the salad.

I made this mango sesame dressing to top my chicken. I found it absolutely delicious. Great and has many uses for asian foods. However, I did make a few substitutions i really recommend. First, a family member is allergic to mango, so we switch the mango chutney for a combination of peach preserves and apricot chutney. It was amazing. Also, I added about 1/4 cup more peach preserves than was recommended. Gave it an amazing flavor. Overall, it was fabulous.

I made this dressing to top my chicken. It was absolutely delicious. Since a family member is allergic to mango, we swapped mango chutney for a mix of peach preserves and apricot chutney. Still AMAZING!

Great dressing, I used mango/ginger chutney I had on hand from TJ's. Everyone loved it.

I too loved it! I used apple cider vinegar in place of the rice vinegar, and it came out just fine. I can see using this not only on the chicken but also salmon,shrimp, and maybe even a pork loin. My summer has just gotten a bit zingier!

Loved it! I loved it on the chicken and made the noodle dish recommended for leftovers and loved that too. I think it would be really great on shrimp. Will be making this again in the near future.

Deeeeelicious. I used olive oil instead of cooking or canola and it was really good. Also, I used seasoned rice vinegar and it also worked out just fine. For those that may be worried that this dressing could be too sweet or mango-y, don't worry. It was savory and tangy, and I did not find the mango to be too 'in your face'. It was great - highly recommended!
