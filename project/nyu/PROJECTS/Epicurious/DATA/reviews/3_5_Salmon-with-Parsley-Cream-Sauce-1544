Liked it, but didn't love it. The sauce is ok, but not worth the effort or calories. Sauce was runny, and did not present well on plate. Could have probably achieved same taste w/ out the effort by making a simple evoo/lemon vinaigrette and adding parsley and wine! Sorry....

I substituted cilantro for the parsley - it gave it a great flavor. Everyone loved it with the grilled salmon.

I was not prepared for how GREEN this sauce is. I served this with asparagus (and rice) and pretty much everything on the plate was a shade of green! Which made me wary of eating it. I would serve this dish with a non-GREEN vegetable. The dish itself was good but a little bland.

My fiance loved this dish, the salmon was perfect. I used half milk and half of the whipping cream. I accompanied it with stirried asparagus w/red onion and garlic.

Easy to prepare and just wonderful! We serve with some steamed asparagus and a wild rice & long grain rice w/pecans for a side. Just great.

I have used this wonderful salmon dish again and again and it always receives a 4 star rating from my guests. It is a beautiful contrast of colors as a presentation as well.
