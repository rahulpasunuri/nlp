We prepared this for a Thanksgiving dinner where some of the guests were vegan. It was perfect -- we roasted some in the bird, where it picked up those flavors, and just roasted half in a casserole. Everyone loved it!

For all the work it took to prepare, the result was disappointly bland. The subtle tastes of those expensive mushrooms were washed out by the stronger flavors of the other ingredients. Not obnoxious, just "blah," and too much time and money.

Not sure what the reason was, but this dish disn't have the right consistency for me. I loved the flavour combinations - apple, raising, cinnamon, orange, plus the veg's - but I found this recipe to be too demanding in deviating from the script (the carot/parsnip/mushroom mixture definitely dried out, I ended using way more than the suggested water) and when it was all assembled I just didn't find the whole to be more than the sum of its parts.

My husband and I tried this last night and loved it. The flavors are wonderful! Very warm and cozy--perfect for fall or winter, but healthy and without being too heavy. There was a lot of chopping, but it's necessary for all the layers of flavor. Next time we make this, we will cook the rices separately then combine them since our wild rice was not done when the white rice was, even though we followed the recipe directions.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was excellent. It has a very mild taste. I brought it to a dinner party as a side dish and it was well-liked. I don't know if it would be much different using regular mushrooms. The wild ones were expensive.

I took one of the reviewers advice and made this with the Pork Tenderloin with Balsamic Cranberry sauce. It was delicious. It took a REALLY long time to prepare - so much chopping with 1 lb of mushrooms, etc. but worth the effort if you have the time. Instead of doing wild and white separately, I had package of a mix with seasonings and it came out fine.

This is almost like the recipe I made up soon after I married in 1948. My husband is allergic to wheat, so I made a risotto with onions and garlic, and added apples and mushrooms, and a little white wine. I have given this recipe to my daughter-in-law and many friends.

A little bland. It was definitely not worth all of the effort it took to prepare.

Served with boneless pork loin apple sauce and butternut squash. A great combo for company with no last minute work.

This is a quintessential fall recipe. This dish nicely complimented the Pork Tenderloin with Balsamic-Cranberry Sauce recipe. It features a good variety of flavors including the irreplacably earthy parsnip. A little on the mild side overall.
