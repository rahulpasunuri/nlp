So, I rated this recipe as "Good"... I did make some changes, but I REALLY want SIMPLE ingredients to speak for themselves, so with this recipe, you are not looking for complex flavors. It is VERY reminiscent of Italian cooking. The focus of this recipe is the pasta and sauce. It cannot get much more Italian than that. With that said, IT NEEDS modifications. I did the following. In sum, there are THREE ingredients that SAVED this dish from being bland: lots of garlic, plenty of kosher salt and a generous sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes at the table. (If it did not have these three things, I would not be making it again.) In addition to those items, I used 6 garlic cloves instead of 4. Double the herbs and added 1 teaspoon of thyme. I also added 1 teaspoon of kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. At the end, I threw 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese over the top and served it in the saute pan at the table.. For its simplicity and ease, I WILL be making this again. It is not exceptional, but it is good and my family (including my 3 year old) did enjoy it.

Needs more stuff. I used bulk spicy turkey sausage, can of black olives (sliced in half), some mushrooms (if you like them), RED wine, red pepper and CRUSH some of the garlic into the sauce. I did 2 lbs of sausage and used very little pasta. It was like a mild chunky chile - everyone loved it!

Good, simple weeknight recipe. I used extra ground turkey and grated lots of parmesan on top. It could use some spicy sausage or veggies to give it more pizzaz.

I agree with the other cooks, it is a good base recipe that needs a little extra kick. I added some onion, bell pepper and mushrooms and a splash of cream and a pinch of cayenne. Also turned it into a casserole by baking in the oven with lots of mozza cheese. Very nice!!

Tried this recipe because it was rated kid friendly - and indeed it was!!! After reading the previous reviews, I also added onions and mushrooms, and instead of crushed tomatoes I added diced tomatoes (canned) with sun-dried tomatoes, and also a little bit of chicken broth (instead of white wine). Didn't add salt, with the broth didn't need to. My 21-month old grandson, usually a picky eater, loved it and even had seconds!! Will definitely make this again.

This is a good dish, not great, but really easy. It needs a tremendous amount of salt, and I use a lot of garlic. It's a great weekday dinner. My kids like it.

I've made this many times but agree with the others -- it is bland as written. I usually add salt & pepper and some crushed red pepper. I shared the recipe with a cousin, whose husband is a heart patient, and they love it because they can't salt anything.

I made this last night for dinner on a whim. I wanted to make traditional meat sauce, but my store did not have ground pork and only ground chuck. I bought ground turkey & figured I'd be creative. I followed the recipe plus I added a large white onion, a container of baby portobello mushrooms, a can of whole stewed tomatoes and several shakes of tabasco. It seemed watery towards the end, so I added a can a tomato paste. My husband loved it & could not believe it was ground turkey. I had enough sauce to freeze two small freezer bags full of sauce, too.

I took the advice of the others and added some veggies (small diced onions, celery, and carrots). I also added some extra garlic and sugar (secret Italian sauce ingredient). I made it in a large chicken fryer/skillet which made it easier to cook and then I sprinkled some Parmesan and cheddar cheese on top at the end and it ended up like a skillet pasta casserole. Personally, I thought it was a little boring and almost tasted like Hamburger Helper or something. My family on the other hand loved it. Its one of my dad's new favorite foods and wants me to make it for his birthday. I guess it depends on what you like. I think the recipe title is a little misleading. Its not like a spaghetti sauce recipe, it is definetly more like a casserole. I really think it would do well baked in the oven with lots of cheese on top.

"As is" this recipe is very bland. I added crushed red pepper and garlic salt to spice it up a bit. I used dried parsley and oregano and I am sure fresh spices would make a world of difference. Next time, I would add an onion as well. This recipe serves as a good starting point and you can get creative from there!

Excellent dish, low in fat and very tasty! I added some fresh zuchini and tomatoes from the garden also some onion. Even my 2 year old loved it!

4+ for ease, although next time I make it, I'll add more vegies (ie mushrooms, a little onion) and I'll cook the sauce longer than the prescribed 30 minutes. I like my sauces to absorb the herbs and the 30 minutes just wasn't enough.
