Well, it's perfectly edible. I followed the other reviewers' advice to add garlic and balsamic, so perhaps I shouldn't blame the recipe, but the flavors were...almost unpleasant. Won't make again.

I marinated the tri-tip for about 5 hours, 2 hours at room temperature. I added garlic and balsamic vinegar as suggested. This was so good! Juicy and flavorful.

Wonderful - it was a big hit in my house!!! Everyone was a member of the clean plate club - even my 7 and 4 year olds - with requests for 2nds all around. Full of flavor (I added the balsalmic and garlic). I served it with a quinoa salad. I will make this again soon.

This was so easy and delicious! I marinated it for 2 days before I got around to cooking it, and cooked it whole instead of cutting into cubes. It would be great sliced and wrapped in a tortilla, and I'm going to use it on deli rolls for sandwiches.

Delicious! I actually substituted the soy sauce for braggs liguid aminos and doubled the recipe. The were a crowd pleaser at the bbq:)

Be warned, this is insanely good. Followed others' advice and added the balsamic vinegar and garlic. We ate much more than should have, which (sadly) meant no leftovers the next day. Making this again tonight and we're going to try hard to leave some for tomorrow.

Simple, easy, and tasty. I added whole mushrooms and dunked the mushrooms, tomatoes, and onion in the marinade immediately before threading on the skewers. Served on a bed of red bib lettuce...very lovely!

Did not think flavors worked well. Would not make again.

I use this as one of my barbeque staples, especially when you don't have the finest meat for grilling. I do suggest adding the balsamic and garlic (since every reviewer has suggested this, maybe they should change the recipe!), and I marinate overnight and have had good results. The recipe lends a creative element to beef grilling, which is usually only done with barbeque sauce in most households. Anyway, I like the recipe.

As per some other reviews, I mixed this up a little bit, and it came out wonderfully! Try adding a couple tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and olive oil and a clove of minced garlic. They really made the marinade rich, but it didn't overpower the meat at all. The beef was juicy and tender, and we'll definitely be having this again.

I didn't jazz this up at all and found it very boring, as is. The flavours didn't really blend - I could still taste lemon, salt and cumin, and the sum wasn't great. My husband desperatly needed red meat; I ate one cube, he finished the rest. After his initial hunger passed, he downgraded his rating to "don't bother to make again"

Delicious meal with so little effort. Kebabs were juicy and tender. Had 2.5# tri-tip so I adjusted ingredients by 2.5 times. Used tamari in place of soy sauce. Also added 2t. of finely minced garlic, and 2T. extra virgin olive oil. Marinated beef for 2 hours at room temp. I'm thinking that to marinate overnight would overpower the beef and make the texture mushy fron the lemon juice. Served with grilled portebello mushrooms brushed with the marinade while grilling, and a "quasi" greek salad with cucumber, cherry tomatoes, sliced red onions, and kalamata olives. I squeezed the juice of 1 small lemon over the top then lightly spinkled with red wine vinegar to taste.

I added fresh chopped garlic and 1/4 cup of Balsamic Vinegar. I allowwed it to marinade for 24 hours. Everyone loved it. I did not use kabobs but sirloin steak instead. I am making it again, for the 4th, for a different crowd.

The flavor of the marinade was yummy. To counter the spice of the cumin, I also added pineapple chunks to the skewers-- along with onion, green pepper, and grape tomatoes. We also added some chopped garlic to the marinade. Turned out pretty tasty!

This was a great meat dish served with rice pilaf. The entire gang said it was a 'keeper'.

This recipe was ok. It wasn't all THAT great.

I made this Friday as part of an outdoor concert picnic meal and everyone raved. Because I immediately wrapped the skewers in a ton of foil to keep them warm for the show they continued to cook so next time I would undercook them a bit if it were for the same occasion. Definitely use the low-sodium soy and definitely marinate them for 2-3 hours. Superb!

It was yumm-tastic!! (But it took my mom a long time to skewer the stuff)

This is the first recipee I've tried on this site that received good reviews that I didn't care for. My husband didn't really like it either. Maybe we're just not fans of cumin and didn't realize it. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't make it again.

Unbelievably delicious! I kept telling my husband that I hoped it would be good because it was so easy and it was great. I will make this again and again.

Great flavor -- much better than my usual vinaigrette-type marinade. Used red pepper, onion, zucchini rounds and mushroom caps which I tossed with roasted garlic olive oil and a little garlic salt. Served over white and wild rice. Followed another reviewe's suggestion and marinated at room temperature for 3 1/2 hours. Definitely a keeper!

Easy and tasty. We're with the previous reviewer, and added vidalia onion and red bell pepper to the skewer. Served this with sundried tomato cous-cous -- Terrific! I'll definitely be making this one again -- my husband though it was fantastic.

This was great and simple, something you could make easily any night of the week. I used red and green peppers as well as white and red onions with the tomatoes on the skewers and served it with white jasmine rice. I also marinated all the vegetables for about 15 minutes just before cooking and then added a little olive oil to the leftovers for basting on the grill. Delicious. Tip - we marinted top sirloin for three and a half hours at room temperature - in case you don't have all night to wait.

This was a great dish and will become a summer staple. Easy to make and my guests loved it. I served it with plain white rice and a cucumber, pineapple, and cilantro salad. Any other side dish ideas?
