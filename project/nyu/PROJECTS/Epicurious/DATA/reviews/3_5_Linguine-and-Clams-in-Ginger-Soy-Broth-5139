Eh, pretty ordinary. Easy to make, but nothing amazing flavor-wise. Rice noodles might be a good substitute for linguine.

I love this recipe not just because of the great flavor, but because you can customize it because each package is unique. One of your guest's hates cilantro? Leave it out of their packet. Kids don't like spicy? Put the extra chiles in yours! Someone doesn't like clams - substitute shrimp. . . This is a great one for a dinner gathering with guests with different tastes!

This gets it's 4 "forks" from me for two reasons: I've made this regularly since it was first published in 1998 and it still packs a wonderful flavor surprise every time. Secondly, my guy fell for my cooking largely based on this recipe, then fell for me! Nine years later and still going strong...something's working here!!

I didn't use low sodium chicken broth or soy sauce...big mistake. If you will use both low salt alternatives, you will most certainly have a tasty treat. As it was, we could tell that it would be very good had we gone the low salt route. The little neck clams were adequate, but next time (and there will definitely be a next time), we will use mussels or another seafood. However, my guests were very intrigued by the packets and it makes for a superior presentation.

I have made this recipe for years and it is always wonderful. At times I have even added shrimp, mussels and scallops. I also like to increase the liquid ingredients, so that there is more sauce. It is always a hit with friends.

From Morocco: clams here are quite small so I tried this recipe with trout and seabass and it works beautifully with large fish. Excellent!

as an Italian and a great pasta eater, i would suggest to precook linguine until barely done (they must get just pliable) and close them in foil with the other ingredients. Cooking all together should enhance flavours and at the same time soften them - for the cooks that found this recipe too salty - because the pasta would absorb lots of flavourful juice. Buon appetito :o)

I have reviewed this recipe once before but am coming back again. My grocery store was out of cilantro so I just used green onions instead. Actually, I bought some salmon and braised it in this sauce for maybe, 7 minutes or so. I added a lot of ginger and splash of sherry. This was SOO AMAZING with salmon. My fiance and I don't like the taste of fishy fish and this took it away. I made a cucumber salad and a bowl of kiwi on the side. A really incredible meal with lot's of flavor, no fat, and fills you up without making you feel bloated afterward.

We love intense flavor, but this was too intense even for us, and too salty. I wouldn't make this again without increasing the amount of canned reduced-sodium chicken broth or, more likely, adding some water. Interesting technique, the foil packets.

A little too much cilantro and ginger for my taste, but I would definitely make it again and just revise the amounts a bit. Very simple to prepare and it looks (and smells!) wonderful when served.

GREAT recipe! We love it and have made it several times although I cut the cilantro in half. Too strong a flavor for out liking...

Very delicious recipe, assembly was fairly easy too after all the ingredients are prepped

This recipe is easy but tastes like it is hard to make. Delicious!

I cooked this dish in a covered pot on top of the stove, cooking the red pepper and the scallions in the broth. I added tomato ginger chutney, the recipe for which had been in an earlier month's bon appetit, and also added salmon filet for my husband who does not care for shellfish. We both really enjoyed this dish.

A delicious, interesting twist on regular linguine with clam sauce. I will make this recipe again and again...

We couldn't find clams so we made it with mussels instead. It was great. Can't wait to make it again!

Fabulous, high-impact flavor in such an easy, healthful recipe! Combination of flavors is inspired. I've made this several times, and have also substituted mussels and shrimp for the clams. Both have worked well. Cold, crisp Sauvignon Blanc is a good companion. Tonight, I'm trying with scallops...:-)

For the reviewer who called this dish 'disgusting'...I could think of about 100 other dishes that I would serve someone who'd been in the hospital rather then one that includes jalapeos, garlic, soy and ginger. Next time try to go a bit more mild!!!

I have made this dish at least 15 times. It is low-fat and full of wonderful flavors. It is a great recipe to make for one or for guests. Easy, quick, and tasty.

I made this dish especially for my dad, who'd eaten nothing but hospital food for a week and wanted a treat. I figured it had good components and would be heathful. It was absolutely disgusting. Never before have I cooked something so inedible. I felt absolutely awful that I had to throw it all away including $25 worth of clams.

A very tasty seafood and pasta dish, particularly for low fat dieters like myself. This will become a regular for me.
