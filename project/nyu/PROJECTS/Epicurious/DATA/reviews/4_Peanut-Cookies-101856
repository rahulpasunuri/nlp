This is the 2nd time I made this recipe, today, courtesy of Hurricane Sandy. I think the following alterations improve this cookie. - 1/2 cup of roasted Hazelnuts (forgot to buy peanuts!) - 2 tbsp on Peanut butter - 1/2 cup + a smidge of brown sugar - 1/4 cup of white sugar.

This was very easy to make and delicious. I am not a big fan of things that are very sweet so I would cut down the sugar a bit. That said, if you are the average American sweet tooth, these are just fine.

These cookies were a very positive surprise. First, they were incredibly simple to make. I spent less than 10 minutes preparing the dough. The end result made the fast and simple prep work even more surprising. The combination of salted peanuts and the sweet cookie was divine. I did use the recommended chocolate, and the addition of the chocolate brought this from a 3 to 4 star recipe for me.

These cookies are great! I didn't get that many out of the recipe - maybe 20, so next time I will double it. I used big, salted gourmet Virginia peanuts - they tend to be less oily than cocktail-type peanuts. I kept them whole instead of chopping - the texture contrast was nice that way! I agree that these are also good without the chocolate glaze, though I did use 70% dark chocolate on them which was great - a pretty sophisticated taste combined with the salted peanuts. I didn't add the recommended peanut butter - I'm sure it's good that way, but I also think the cookies are nice as-is - with just the peanuts and chewy cookie dough around them. They did spread a bit - but having whole peanuts kept the texture interesting. I might add 1/4 C more peanuts next time, and I think semi-sweet chocolate chips would be a nice alternative to the glaze! Will definitely make these again, and definitely recommend them for a grown-up-ish peanut/chocolate cookie!

These are yummy. The sweet/salty combination is awesome. I had trouble with the melted chocolate - it was to thick to drizzle. Maybe next time I'll try adding choc. chips.

Very easy to make. Everyone loved them; and thought they were a gourmet treat rather than the simple recipe that they are. I will definitely make them again.

I have made several attempts at making these to give away but they usually disappear long before I get them out of the house... With or without the final drizzle of chocolate they are by far my favorite peanut cookie recipe.

The dough was delicious, but the finished cookie was less impressive to me. Each batch spread more than the previous. (Try chilling?)and I thought they tasted better uncooked! I like the idea and may adapt to another cookie recipe. I used salted butter and opted not to drizzle with chocolate.

I made this cookie at work and was pleased with the yield. At first I was afraid I wouldn't get enough from the recipe, but even portioning these cookies with a "small" (in relation to my "regular" scoops) produced very big cookies. They spread much more than you'd guess. Drizzling them with chocolate made them very visually appealing. Nice flavor - make sure you like the quality of the peanuts as it will be the primary flavor - even with the chocolate.

I made these cookies for Valentine's Day for my husband who is a peanut lover. He, and everyone he shared them with, loved them. I used roasted peanuts and followed the recipe precisely. It was easy and absolutely a keeper. Delicious!!!!

Fantastic. So easy. The best cookie I have tried in a long time.

Zowie! I made the recipe as directed, but sneaked in about 1/4 cup of natural peanut butter. Then I used the cookies with a chocolate fondue. It's an incredible, peanutty, cookie, easy to make, and a new staple in my recipe box.

These cookies are fullproof if you follow the instructions - I have made them at least a dozen times and they always turn out beautifully. I add two level tablespoons of peanut butter as suggested and chop the peanuts (use blanched salted peanuts)in the food processor to break them up a little. I have received many requests for the recipe and everyone who has tried the cookies goes nuts over them (no pun intended!)

These cookies did not come out for me at all. They came out so greasy that they left puddles on the cookie sheet and soaked two rounds of paper towels. This recipe might be very sensitive to butter temperature or creaming--my butter was softer than it usually is when I make cookies and I didn't cream the butter and sugar (for most cookie recipes I've found that this isn't a problem). In any case, I'm not going to try this touchy recipe again.

I didn't have peanuts...so I added 1/2 cup of peanut butter and 2 cups of chocolate chips. I slightly undercooked them and had to wait for them to cool to remove them from the pan. The results were a delicious peanutty-chocolate chewy delight.

This recipe was absolutely scrumptious! We didn't have any peanuts, so we added 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter. It worked out perfectly! We didn't add the chocolate as well, but, WOW! were these cookies good! The dough was incredibly easy to work with, and tasted good too! A must make!

I searched for a recipe to use up 10 bags of Planters peanuts I got on clearance at a store for 50 cents each. Since its summer it is way to early for peanut brittle. I really liked this cookie. It was very easy to make. I did drizzle the top with chocolate...yummm... definatly do not leave off. You do not have to grease the cookie sheets. I also refrigerated the dough in between batches which made it easy to work with. My cookies did spread out a lot. But it made the texture delicate and lacy. Definatly a cookie to make when your in a hurry.

Very good, will definitely make again. This is a three fork recipe that gets a fourth fork for being so darn easy. As suggested, I used a couple tablespoons of peanut butter and instead used dark brown sugar as well as bittersweet chocolate on top (no butter). From start to finish, cookies were ready in under 30 min. Wow.

I thought this was a good recipe, although not out of this world or anything. Also, the dough was too soft, as the batter spread out to form very large flat cookies. I added about 1/4 cup or so more flour and thought the consistency much improved. You'll also need to add some butter to the chocolate if you intend to drizzle it on top of the cookies (I did). Adding peanut butter to the cookie dough sounds like a good idea, too. All in all, a nice variation.

Fantastic recipe. I did not top them with chocolate. And, I did add 2 scant Tbsp of peanut butter.
