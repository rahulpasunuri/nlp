I give this 4 forks because it is so easy and tasty. I use hot italian sausage. Usually I use red and yellow bell peppers (no green).

I love to cook and consider myself decent. This recipe filled my apartment with the best smell of any dish i've ever made. Bravo!!!!

I made it with lower-fat turkey sausage and it was great and not as greasy as pork sausage. The best part is, it didn't taste low fat.

Easy and delicious! I had to use a yellow pepper in place of the green pepper because my grocery store was out(!) but it was still delicious. We will make this again.

Delicious and easy! Prep and cook time total under one hour. Also super convenient because you don't need a paella pan. Made a few changes - doubled recipe, added more arborio rice (unsure how much more - until I felt like there would be enough rice for me to enjoy) and also added small bay scallops. Turned out great!

I have been making this recipe since it first appeared and love it! I sometimes add a clove or 2 of garlic and usually use red onions and diced carrots, too. it's great!

My husband loved this meal. I found it very easy. I was surprised that the risotto turned out perfectly and didn't require constant supervision. I used a can of diced tomatoes to save time.

Rating: 4
Wonderful! Couldn't be easier, just use great sausage; I had fresh salcissa and used an heirloom tomato instead of canned. Simple and delicious.

Rating: 4
This gets 4 forks because it was delicious, easy, fast and had minimal clean up, all vital for a weeknight meal in our busy house. Perfect for the first really cool night of fall. Only changes I made were to use more veggies, chicken broth instead of water and add some garlic and cilantro. Next time I might add some chciken or shrimp.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe and would give it 2.5 stars as is-- 3 stars with the addition of chopped olives. I highly recommend making this dish though because as a concept, it's inspiring! Which makes sense, given how many reviewers had great success with their own versions. Next time I'll do half sausage and half chicken breast, add corn and some cilantro. Might skip the wine-- use chicken broth instead. Possibilities are endless.

Rating: 4
Great, I added more seasoning like other reviews commented on. Also added green beans and forgot the tomatoes but it was still excellent. Make sure you add lots of white pepper and lemon rind at the end. Also added a but of cinnamon! I alos used extra lean Italian sausage.

Rating: 4
Totally exceptional because of the lovely flavours and ease of preparation. Delicious quick weeknight dinner. I used a cup of tomato juice from the canned tomatoes with 1/2 c of stock in place of the water. Half a bag of frozen bay scallops addded in right before it went in the oven was a great addition. Paella isn't paella without a little seafood!

Delicious. Didn't have wine, so substituted 1/4 water and 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar (to dilute). So easy and quick.

Really great...with help. Switch water to chicken broth, add oregano and a dash of cayenne and 2 cloves chopped garlic. YUM

My husband is on his third helping as I write this review. My 4 yr old, who hasn't eaten so much as a sliver of pepper his entire life, ate a huge bowl. So this is a keeper. Having said that, I did tweak it a bit. Doubled the recipe, used 2 and a half cups chicken stock instead of water, tossed in a half bulb of fennel and spiced it up - 2 lg cloves garlic, 1 tbls each dried oregano & basil and a tsp or so hot hungarian paprika. i think it would have been a little bland without the spicing up so I'm really glad I read the reviews first.

Rating: 3
This is a nice quick and delicious dinner recipe. I made it with a lower fat chicken Italian sausage that I had in the fridge and increased olive oil to 1.5 tbsp. I also cooked it for 25 mins stovetop only -- 20 mins covered at a simmer to cook the rice then uncovered 5 mins to evaporate some liquid. Doubles really well too.

Rating: 3
This is a great, quick dish with tons of flavor. I didn't have any white wine (though I'd like to try it in this paella) so I used chicken stock for additional flavor. I've also made it with chorizo, very good as well.

Rating: 3
The rice is a little dry if for various causes. I find many brands to vary in the amount of liquid need so you need to consider that when making this recipe. The brand I use calls for just over dble the amount of liquid to rice. I use chicken stock and this next time Im going to try adding roasted peppers instead. This recipe also needs a little more seasoning.

Rating: 3
Yum. I doubled the recipe. If you do this I wouldn't suggest going over 2 1/4 cups of liquid. I used just over 2 cups and it was a little bit dry. I had to add in a bit more at the end, cover, and pop back in the oven for 5 minutes. I added garlic, used Italian seasoned tomatoes and threw in some red pepper flakes for good measure. We topped with fresh parm and there was nothing left at the end of the meal

Rating: 3
I made this recipe exactly as stated. It was quick and easy to make but it wasn't something that I thought was great. I will probably make it again because it was so quick and easy.

Rating: 4
This is just delicious, and could not be much simpler. I followed the directions as listed here, with the excepetion of substituting chicken broth for water, and it came out just perfect. My husband loves this so much he wants me to cook it for his family. High praise, indeed!

I use 3 hot Italian sausages and like others said, use chicken broth in place of the water. Emeril's seasoning and some garlic powder kick-it-up! I prefer all green bell pepper rather than the red. My husband LOVES this!

Rating: 1
Too tomatoey for us. Like a glorified Spanish rice. Wouldn't make again.

Rating: 2
Too much trouble to make again. I had to make way too many modifications to even begin to make this tasty - even based on other reviewer's comments. The rice was hard - I had to add 1/2 c. of water after 20 min. of cooking and put the lid on. I subbed the tom. for the water. Maybe that was part of the problem. I then had to add a boat load of seasoning to it. I finally just dumped in some Emeril's seasoning and topped w/parmesan and ate it. The person who added the shrimp and let it sit for 5 minutes was a genious! Good tip.

Rating: 4
Excellent dish and so easy to make. I substitute one large can of canned crushed tomatoes for the combination of tomatoes and water. It's delicious!

The reviews were very helpful. I used 4 hot sausages, 1 cup rice, the juice from the tomatoes, chicken broth, garlic and fresh oregano and thyme. This is a simple, yet delicious dish. I made it last week and my boyfriend is already requesting an encore!

This was fabulous, easy and just as wonderful as previously discussed. True, use chicken stock instead of water..added chicken breast with bone in and used Rotel Italian diced tomato can...easy, one pan wonderful meal.

Quick and Delicious! I used 2 mild and 2 spicy Italian sausages, and added garlic and a jar of marinated artichokes (w/juices) and 1 cup of rice to accomodate the extra liquid. I took the advice of previous reviewers and did not drain the tomatoes and substituted chicken broth for the water. Yumm!

I really enjoyed this dish. It was simple to prepare however, I did make some changes. Added Chicken stock and garlic as recommended but also added Chicken breast pieces and shrimp also artichokes. It was even better the next day.

I made this recipe as written. I thought it was bland. I would recommend the other reviewers' suggestions to use broth instead of water. Certainly no "wow" factor in this dish. I give this recipe a rating of "ehh". There are much better recipes for similar dishes on this site so I won't be making this one again.

Rating: 3
I thought this was good but maybe just a little bland. It was very easy so I will definitely make this again but next time I will use chicken or vegetable broth instead of water and add some spices (maybe a little garlic, oregano, and fennel seed). I think it would be very bland without the white wine. I did include some diced fennel bulb which I thought worked well in the dish.

Rating: 4
This recipe is fantastic and very easy to make. It is easily expanded to make extra if more people are present (cooking time may take longer). I subsituted some chicken stock instead of 1/2 of the water and added some garlic with the wine, and it was even better.

This is a great recipe because it is easy, fast and full of flavour. I made a few changes to the original recipe: used spicy Italian sausage, added squid, mussels, shrimp and scallops. substituted the water with chicken broth.

Mmmmmmm! This recipie is a keeper. Made it with turkey sausage, added a head of fennel to the veggies, and doubled it (plus an extra sausage or 2) so we would have leftovers for lunch the next day. Also, added some oregano, crushed red pepper and cayenne for a kick. And substituted the water with 1 part tomato sauce left over from the canned tomatoes and 2 parts chicken broth. Arborio rice gives this dish a nice glaze.

Rating: 4
Outstanding recipe. Easy to make with a delicious outcome. Definitely use chicken broth instead of water.. A sprinkle of Emeril's Essenceis an excellent way to kick it up. The All-Clad braiser is the way to go!!! A great dish to make when it is zero degrees outside.

Rating: 2
Needed more sausage and fresh herbs for flavour. I didn't drain the tomatoes either, so I can't imagine the dish using just water. I will definately make this again with the changes.

Rating: 4
This was so very good and easy to make. I did double the recipe in order to serve as a main dish for 3 adults and to have leftovers for lunch. I used beef broth instead of water just because I had some in the fridge. I will redo this one very soon.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! This is definitely a 'keeper' recipe. Wonderful flavor and so easy to make! Like one of the other cooks suggested, I used the juice from the tomatoes in the recipe. Using plain water would probably make it more colorful by keeping the rice white, making a greater contrast with the peppers and tomatos; using the juice makes the rice sort of nondescript-colored but it tastes good....

Rating: 4
Excellent! Easy to boot! I cut the sausage into "coins" & browned. Made it more like paella instead of rice hot dish. Also added garlic & red pepper flakes, chicken boullion instead of water & 1 cup of wine by accident. Also added a whole 14oz can of diced tomatoes with the juice. No sense in wasting them. Added 1/2# of shrimp when the rice was cooked. Covered for 5 minutes & the shrimp were perfect. Going into the permanent file!

Rating: 3
This is a really simple but delicious meal. I used hot italian sausage and was afraid it might be too spicy but the rice absorbed alot of the spice and it was just perfect! I was not happy about throwing out all the juice from the drained tomatoes so I used some of it in place of part of the water - about 50/50. I will be making this dish again very soon!

I've made this twice now and will make it a regular dish. I used a shrimp stock I made from the pumpkin and shrimp bisque recipe on this site. I used italian turkey sausage and added 1/2 llb shrimp in the last 5 minutes. It was very tasty.

I made this and the entire family just inhaled it! Even my 7 and 3 year old ate it, and they only eat hot dogs and macaroni and cheese! I made a few adjustments to the recipe. I used sweet turkey sausage, the arborio rice that was already mixed with saffron and seasonings in a bag, and I substituted chicken broth for the water. About 15 minutes into the oven baking, I added some raw shrimp to the dish and stirred every 5 minutes or so. It came out absolutely perfect! I will absolutely make this again!!

Loved this dish but would double it next time so there would be leftovers! Took the advice of others and added crushed garlic, doubled the sausage, increased the rice to 1 cup and subsituted chicken broth for the water. Quick, easy and delicious! Can't wait to make it again.

I also added extra sausage, crushed red pepper, garlic and yellow pepper for additional color. I substituted orzo for the rice and adjusted the liquid accordingly. An easy to prepare one-dish meal. Delicious and a definite "make it again" dish.

This was fabulous and easy -- what more can one ask for?!! We took into consideration other people's suggestions:added garlic and peas, increased the amount of sausage, used Italian herb chicken broth in place of the water and a full cup of Arborio rice. Had some Asiago cheese on hand, so grated & added that right before serving -- the perfect final touch. Because prep and cooking is so easy, it's a great weeknight/Friday night dish. Highly recommended!!!

My comments duplicate everyone else's. This dish is visually appealing and refreshingly quick and easy. It just needs some tweaking because it's somewhat bland. I would double the sausage, add garlic, increase the wine, replace the remaining water with regular chicken broth, add spices/herbs. Thyme may be a good choice.

The further into the bowl I ate the more I loved this dish. I followed the advice and browned the veg quite a bit, added some red pepper flakes, and some tiger prawn tails at the end. I also added some Fresh Tarragon as I am in love with it at the moment. Delicious.

When I put this on the table, my boyfriend said "This is the kind of food a person likes to eat!" and scarfed down 3 bowls. I put in some shrimp a few minutes before the end of cooking, and added peas as well.

I keep making this in larger and larger quantities, and guess what the leftovers are never wasted. Try it with shrimp added.

One of our all time favorites. I make it with Italian turkey sausage, which cuts back on the fat and add a generous sprinkling of cayenne. Other than that I cook it as specified. One hint, it tastes better if you allow the peppers and onions to begin to turn brown or carmelize on top of the stove before putting in the oven. An additional bonus is the quick prep time.

This was great - I added chicken and it was so yummy - a terrific meal. I made it with Portugues Stone Soup, french bread and some sangria! Par-tay!

Rating: 3
This is a great dish, and especially gratifying for new cooks with its simple prep and single-pan cooking method. I went south of the border by swapping the italian sausage for andouille and adding spices: three cloves of garlic, some saffron and some sage. Also added a little less than a 1/2 teaspoon of salt, which it sorely needed. I slight increased the measurements as I was using an 11.5 inch paella pan. Loved it.

This was really great and quite easy to make! I added a lot of garlic, fresh parsley, thyme and sage, plus I used saffron flavored rice, which really added a nice kick. It's an easy recipe to play around with and add whatever other ingredients you like.

My entire family loved this recipe. Reminded me of a favorite recipe my Mom made us when we were kids. I made a few changes as did other, including cooking on top of stove the entire time and stirring during cooking time. I added more garlic, deleted the wine, and water and used 2 cups of chicken broth instead. This gave it a wonderful flavor. We're going to have this again tonight since it's raining and chilly here in Chicago and we're looking for some good Comfort Food.

Rating: 4
Delicious! One of my favorite quick comfort foods. I definitely agree with many of above suggestions, including more garlic, spices, and chicken sausage. I also do not have a ovenproof skillet, so everytime I've made this I've just kept it covered on the stove until most of the liquid evaporates. It comes out wonderfully!

A new family favorite. We beefed it up on the spices quite a bit -- added mega garlic, pepper, salt. Otherwise it was a little bland. We love it!

This is an excellent party dish. You can get it ready, then pop it in the oven when the guests arrive. Its colourful and always goes down well! I added chicken thighs to the sausage meat to bulk it out a bit, and added a bit more spice.

My husband loves this. I use chicken sausages instead of pork. I never have any white wine around the house, so I just double the chicken stock instead. I also add a can of diced tomatoes with the liquid. I also doubled the about of peppers, because I love them!

love this recipe! have made it many times. i use hot turkey sausages (at least 4), up the wine, decrease the water, and use the packaged spanish rice for some spice & kick (like the near east best, use 1/2 packet of seasoning) love the shrimp idea-will try that next!

Loved this recipe! Have made it many, many times but have changed it by using Rotelle canned tomatoes (med.), chicken broth instead of water and using one hot & one sweet sausage. The last time I used the roasted garlic chicken broth. Good!

There are a few things I would change. For instance I wouldn't put the vegetables in until much later and I'd chop them in larger chunks. They were overcooked. I served this with a bottle of red wine I had brought back from Madrid. It was the right touch and everyone enjoyed the meal.

I used hot italian sausage and it was highly thought of by family. I also added 1/2 lb. of peeled and deveined shrimp, marinated in 1 tbls. garlic flavored olive oil on top 5 minutes before done and turned the broiler on for the remaining time. My husband thought this made the meal. With this addition, the portion easily serves 4.
