A great way to use any excess eggplant from your CSA etc. As when I make hummus I heat all or part of the garlic for 10 to 15 seconds in the microwave in the oil in the recipe. It gives that great garlic flavor without the the bite that many people find objectionable in raw garlic. I also add just a bit of adobo from the jar of chiptole that I keep in the fridge. A dash of any ground pepper or hot sauce would work as well.

perfect as written - the best recipe I've found for baba ghanousj.

Wow. Very good. I did not remove the eggplant skins nor did I add cumin (didn't have it). Sooo yummy. Wow! I grilled the eggplant on relatively low heat, turning often, but I forgot to pierce the skin. Seemed to work out just fine.

delicious dish, well worth the preparation. be wary of the salt content. the first time i made this spread, i used the least salt called for and found it unacceptably salty. the second time, i only lightly salted the eggplant before patting dry and broiling, and did not add any of the other measured salt. this worked well.

Outstanding! I grilled the eggplant whole (with 4 slits) on my gas BBQ (low heat, covered - that would be 350 degrees) for an hour, (with no oil or marinade) and, following the advice of a reviewer for the Baba Ghanouj in the Sept 2002 issue of Bon Appetit, this site, I cut off the stem only, and processed the entire eggplant. Don't even try to do this in the blender. I started off that way, but switched to my food processor, and it was a snap. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and - oh my - it is beyond delicious. If you like Baba Ghanouj, look no further. This is it.

Charred the eggplants over a gas flame, then transferred whole to 400 degree oven with the garlic, unpeeled, alongside. Peeled them when I put it all together. Subbed lime for the lemon and didn't have parsley on hand. Still delicious, and the best baba ghanoush I've made. Can't wait til more of my eggplants get ripe!

This one's a keeper! I made the recipe exactly as written, except I baked the eggplant instead of grilling it. I thought my guests were going to lick the bowel it was so good. Can't wait for an excuse to make it again.

I made this several years ago and it was so memorable that I had to look it up again when planning for another middle eastern style meal....the smoky flavor of the grilled eggplant is superb.

Delicious treat. Creamy consistency, thanks to the tahini, which Iove. I do love garlic, but found it overpowering. Will tone down the garlic and the cumin (just a smidge) for the next batch.

i peeled, cubed and steamed the eggplant instead of grilling. i also used 4 cloves of roasted garlic instead of the garlic paste. it was delicious!

To save time, I peeled, cubed, and steamed the eggplant for 10 minutes. I then pureed everything with a hand mixer. It was well received by all. Will try the real way to compare!

Just okay. I love eggplant and felt the taste was overpowered by the tahini.

Very easy, I made half quantity as I only needed enough for one occassion. I cooked the eggplant over the gas burner until it charred, then stuck it in the oven for another 15 minutes to cook it all the way though. I did remove some of the seeds before I put the eggplant in the food processor. Tastes absolutely wonderful and I'll be having it on everything I eat until it runs out. Steak with eggplant spread, sandwiches, vegetables, grilled chicken ... yummmm!! (does have a fair hit of garlic so don't eat before going out to impress someone!)

OH MY GOSH - this was delicious. I had just picked 3 very large Japanese eggplants from our garden. Since they didn't weigh in at 2-1/2 pounds, I halved the recipe. My only regret...that I didn't have 2-1/2 pounds of eggplant to start with!!!!

If you don't have a grill: make small slits in the eggplants and then bake them in the oven at 350F for one hour, let them cool for 30 minutes, and then follow the recipe from there. As others have noted, this is an authentic recipe, unlike a couple other baba ghanouj recipes on this site. It's nice to garnish this dish with black olives and pomegranate seeds, in addition to a little parsley and extra virgin olive oil. Yum, indeed!

Yum!!!!!!!!! Used Japanease Eggplant a friend had dropped by. I eye-balled the amount of tahini by taste and roasted about 6 eggplants (cut in half skin side down.) Wish I had roasted more eggplant now. This is a keeper...enjoy

as someone who has lived in the middle east, i can assure you that this is authentic tasting and absolutely delicious! Grilling vs. broiling really makes the difference & BE SURE TO STAB WITH FORKS 1ST AS THE OTHERS SUGGESTED.

This was a good recipe. I used baby eggplants and roasted them on the grill. I wanted to add that I attended a cooking class at Williams-Sonoma recently and the instructor recommended removing the seeds whenever cooking with eggplant to prevent a bitter taste. I will try this modification next time. She made an eggplant caviar that was divine (very similar to this recipe but without the tahini)

I have had this served in many restaurants and was so excited that I was able to duplicate it. It was delicious. To make it look pretty I topped it with the chopped parsley, olive oil and lemon zest. Served with pitas and lentil soup with mustard seed/tomato/chive topping.

We loved it; very garlicky, but my teenage daughter enjoyed it. Good olive oil drizzled on top is important, along with the fresh parsley.

This is almost the same recipe i've been using for years. I usually only use one tablespoon of tahini rather than 1/4 cup as I find it is overpowering. This is delicious with veggies and hummus though!

I have made this recipe a number of times. It is delicious and I highly recommend this recipe. I agree with the other reviewer, you need to prick the eggplant all over with a fork before broiling. I believe that grilling over an open fire improves the flavor of Baba Ghanouj.

We found this to be too bland! I spiced it up with pepper flakes and more garlic. However, we did not like the appearance of this dish nor the taste. (and neither did my neighbors)

This is a fine recipe. Cooks should be advised, however, to prick the eggplants all over before grilling. They can explode if they're not vented (I speak from experience).

I just made this and I am very pleased. The eggplants grilled in under 15 minutes. It needed a little more lemon and cumin but is very easy and yummy. It is tempting to skip the EV olive oil to cut down on the fat especially since the consistency is a little wet, but don't! The oil and parsley really finish the dish nicely.
