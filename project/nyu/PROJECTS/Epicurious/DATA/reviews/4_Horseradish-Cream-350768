This is a wonderful condiment for beef. I added a clove of pressed garlic and some fresh dill. Pure perfection! This also made a good spread for leftover sliced meat sandwiches the next day.

I halved this recipe and it made more than enough for our christmas dinner. Went great with our prime rib.

So simple, yet so good. I made this to go with the standing rib roast featured recipe, instead of the gravy suggested. A very nice light fresh accent to the meat.

I also add a grated Granny Smith apple. Guests loved it.
