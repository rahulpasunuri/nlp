Very good on sandwiches--the taste recalls the relish on New Orleans muffuletta sandwiches. Not so good if you're pressed for time, since there's a lot of chopping and mixing (also, it's better to make it a day or two ahead to give the flavors time to ripen). Everybody loves it, and dieters are especially grateful. Great stuff!

My daughter is a vegan and I make this every time she visits. It lasts in the refrigerator for days and even freezes well. Full of robust flavor. For speed I have used the fresh-frozen cubes of garlic, basil and parsley. The outcome was an even more robust flavor, but a slightly less red, more green color.

This is a great relish/spread for vegetables and bread alike. I had a Mediterranean dinner last night and used this as my main appetizer - everyone loved it. I had a number of vegetables and some toasted focaccia (which I preferred). My husband wants me to make him a sandwich for lunch today with the leftovers. Definitely a keeper with or without other Mediterranean dishes.

this was very good, simple and delicious. but one question ... who would make bruschetta with BUTTER FLAVOURED PAM???? did you have spray cheese from a can along with it ?

I enjoyed this recipe. It is a healthy appetizer with fantastic flavor. Instead of the crudites, I decided to serve the relish as a bruschetta. I took a loaf of french bread, cut slim pieces on a diagonal, sprayed all pieces with butter-flavored Pam and toasted in the oven at 350. Cooled the toast, then topped each piece with the relish...fantastic!

It was very good with baguettes, not as great with crudites. Still, very good.

Excellent relish. I can't wait to toss this with pasta!

I've made this several times now, each time with rave reviews. I prefer it with baguette slices, and like another review, add the pine nuts just before serving. Try the leftovers warm on pasta, it's fantastic!

This is delicious and great as a low-fat dip. I serve it with French bread. I add the toasted pine nuts at the end, so they still have some crunch.

This is a great and healthy alternative to a standard mayo or sour cream based dip. It is very fresh tasting with terrific textures, and works well with pita wedges and veggies alike. This will be a new standard in my hors d'oeuvres regimen,

This is really good! I wasn't expecting it to go over as well as it did because it's so different. I would also serve it with pita chips or something like that next time - maybe even crostini. It has a wonderful, fresh flavor and was easy to make.

It was good, but is wasn't as well recieved as other things I served for a party. I served it w/ pita crisps (drizzled w/ olive oil and sprinkled w/ kosher salt). I think it would have been better spread on toasts. I also used sun-dried tomatoes from the produce section instead of the oil-packed kind. They worked fine. It does taste like pizza.

Yum! This tastes like pizza. It was great on veggies or pita paired w/ hummus, but next time I would spread it on baguette toasts. I made it before Xmas dinner w/ my brother because he's vegan. Plus it's light but it tastes rich. I agree that it's best at room temperature.

Everyone loved this recipe - it was a real change!

Yum, yum, and more yum. Such a nice depature from more traditional sour-cream based dips. I would definitely recommend putting out some bread (pita, baguette, focaccia) along with or in place of vegetables -- it's very hearty.

Great recipe, I served this at a dinner party as an hors d'oeuvre and my family absolutely loved it. It does have alot of ingredients but it is worth the effort. I served it with pita bread instead of vegetables.
