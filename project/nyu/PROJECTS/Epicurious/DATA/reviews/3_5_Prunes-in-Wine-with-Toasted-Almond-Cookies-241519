I didn't make the cookies, but I did make the prunes. They're dangerously good, and incredibly easy. I paired them with an orange-scented creme fraiche ice cream, and they were beautiful. Perfect if you want a quick, sophisticated dessert. I will make these over and over again. HIGHLY recommended.

Happened to have dried figs in my cupboard and used those. This was very good! It's very easy to make and yet flavourful and elegant! Had it with vanilla ice- cream. Dusted ice- cream with some cinnamon. Didn't make the cookies. Am thinking this might be good with the goat cheese fromage blanc I have in my fridge right now.
