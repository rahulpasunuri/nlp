The flavours of this cake was lovely, however, for a round layer cake I would suggest doubling the cake recipe as my layers were very thin and there was too much frosting for the cake in my opinion and I'm a lover of frosting!

Love the flavours however would have doubled recipe with only 1 extra egg for two 9"x 2" round baking tins or used two 8"x 2"

I made this for my birthday instead of my usual carrot cake and everybody loved it. My dad, the perennial dieter, had 3 pieces. This isn't a terribly sweet cake (even with the addition of golden raisins), and it might make good muffins. I used salted butter, so I omitted salt from the frosting--don't think it made a difference to the taste. I'll certainly use this frosting on other cakes. I bought what I thought were large parsnips. They turned out to be gargantuan, and I only needed 1 1/3 parsnips to get 2 cups of (tightly) packed parsnips. If you're using this as a birthday cake, it pairs really well with raspberry and mango sorbets.

I also used toasted pecans rather than walnuts. I almost never use walnuts -- tend to find them too bitter, whereas pecans have a lovely sweet, rich taste.

I also subbed some freshly grated ginger for some of the dried. I baked it in 2 8-inch round pans. Then used a filling between the two layers of 250 grams mascarpone cheese mixed with 3 Tablespoons of dark maple syrup, just before serving. Delicious!

My cake turned out a bit dry. I liked the taste ok. However, the frosting is incredible! I'm a ginger lover and I have used the frosting recipe for other cakes, including pumpkin.

With the exception of the rather laborious grating of the parsnip, this was a really easy recipe. I substituted cardamon for the allspice and used light cream cheese for the frosting. The cake was very moist, and the spice notes and toasted walnut bits really added to the flavor profile.

I made this cake with a 4year old friend. He had a great time helping and even though he initially said "yuck" at the prospect of parsnips, he ate 2 big pieces in the end. We did not have cream cheese so I used plain whole milk yogurt with confectioners sugar to make a glaze. Not sure how much sugar we used- I tasted as we went. The glaze had a nice tang and not too rich, which I often find with cr. cheese icing. A great snack cake. I work as a personal chef and today I am going to try this out on a family with fussy kids. I am betting they'll eat it up!

Yummy! Followed the recipe exactly except I only used about 1 3/4 Cup sugar for the frosting. Received rave reviews! Will probably try with fresh ginger in the cake next time around.

Nice and moist cake. The amount of spices is just right! And the ginger in the frosting adds fresh note, too sweet though if to use all the sugar indicated in the recipe. It tasted excellent with just 2/3 cup sugar for the cake and only 1 cup powdered sugar for the frosting.

Sounds freaky, tastes terrific. Minor tweaks: 3/4t cinnamon, 1t cloves, replace the powdered ginger with grated fresh ginger, bake as two round layers, make 50% more frosting!

I can't find parsnip in my area so i made it with turnip and it turned out excellent. Now i'm going to try it with carrots.

Cake tended to be a little dry, but I slightly over cooked it, probably my fault. Flavor the kind I like. If you like a bit of spice this is the cake for you. For me parsnips are an old comfort food from the farm.

This cake was just delicious! The frosting is a must- my husband and a friend couldn't stop eating it from the bowl. I can't imagine anyone saying it's too dry. It was definately very moist. I am making it again for Easter. Tried it out on my side of the family previously and got rave reviews.

I love parsnips, BUT one word describes this cake - YUCK!!! Followed the recipe and the cake was dry, bad combination of flavors, and by no means a substitute for even a supermarket frozen carrot cake.

I made this with a different cream cheese frosting recipe, so I can't rate that, but the cake was very tasty. I really liked the the strong spice flavor. It could have used just a touch more moistness, possibly more oil or steaming the parsnips for a short time to soften them. The kids liked it too.
