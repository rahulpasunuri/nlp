the onion in the dressing is too strong, I used 1/3 red onion - they didn't like it.

Great salad! Used 1/4 cup onions. Served as a dinner side salad with bacon and hard boiled eggs. Put hard boiled eggs through the potato ricer. Big hit!

Made minor modifications to the salad (i.e., red onion instead of scallions, no mushrooms) but the salad is fabulous. I make it every month and we haven't tired of it.

I didn't read the reviews before making this. I used a 1/2 red onion (relatively large), and the onion flavor was completely overpowering. Because the dressing in this recipe is pureed in a blender, the 1/2 onion is way too much, in my opinion. I will try this again because it seemed promising - but I will try with just a sliver of onion in the dressing. I will try to remember to update.

So easy it's criminal, and wonderful. I used balsamic vinegar because we didn't have the red wine vinegar. Came out great.

Excellent salad! Dressing is tasty, maybe a tad bit too sweet, so reduce sugar next time. Season with salt and plenty of freshly ground pepper to counterbalance the sweetness also. Had a mustard oil in my pantry from Indian market so I subbed for half of required amount. Also increased the Coleman's dry mustard to give it more of a "kick". Don't care for water chestnuts so ommitted those. A definite repeat with a few minor tweaks.

Made for guest day at Preschool--the ONLY salad that went completely--kids and adults alike loved it. Left out the sprouts, water chestnuts and sunflower seeds and doubled the hard-boiled eggs, added 2 extra slices bacon (to make it more kid-friendly.) Teachers asked for recipe, and requested I make for next class/parent event!

I know that people on this site tend to bash the creative cook who strays from the recipe, but that's what I love about cooking-- the opportunity to invent! Anyway, I didn't make this recipe as shown, with the exception of the dressing. My salad was a coronary disaster-- cheddar cheese, chopped egg, and crumbled bacon over baby spinach. I have some very picky friends who would NEVER go for water chestnuts. As I said, I made the dressing exactly as directed, and it was fabulous. My pickiest guest went back for fourths! I used an immersion blender, which worked very well for emulsifying the dressing. You could use this dressing over any leafy greens and have a delicious salad, regardless of the toppings.

I was very surprised (based on all of the prior reviews), but it was the unanimous opinion of my family that this salad was mediocre and not worth making again. We especially didn't like the egg and sunflower seeds. I've tried a number of other Epicurious spinach salad recipes recently, and they were all better than this one.

This salad was so delicious. I made it for a party of 6 and everyone really enjoyed it. I could eat it every day!

one of the best salads I have ever had!

Very good. The only substitution I made was using 2 large-ish shallot bulbs in the place of 1/2 onion. I find that shallots (even thought they are onions)have less of a pungent flavor than most ordinary onions. I used alfalfa sprouts since it was left open as to what kind of sprouts to use. The dressing pulled it all together and I have already made this salad several times! Enjoy....

This salad is really super - not only super delicious but also super easy to make. I only used 1 tsp sugar and added a bit more mustard as I like a tangy sauce.

12/02:Excellent! Served this with the prime rib recipe, Yukon gratin potatoes, carrots w/tarragon and Yorkshire pudding for our Christmas dinner. Everyone raved about this salad! Am glad I prepped everything the day before. Clean and prep the spinach and put in baggie, measure and bag the other ingredients. Just before you're ready, pop everything into the salad bowl. 12/03: UPDATE! Made this again but with a beef tenderloin instead of prime rib. Followed Patty's suggestions and added the extras. Everyone raved about it again and wanted the recipe. Definitely a keeper!

Beautiful AND yummy. I used baby spinach, thinly sliced red onion, thinly sliced fresh mushrooms, craisins and toasted almond slivers. I made this for a beach party for 40 (about 4 lbs baby spinach) and everyone loved it...not a leaf leftover.

Super Salad!! I don't care much for green onions so I eliminated them. Will definitely make again.

Pretty good, though I thought the dressing was similar to french. I agreed with the other reviewers that 2 tbls. of brown sugar was enough, and I kept the onions as it was too sweet without.

Made as a side, so omitted the egg and used less bacon. Also whisked the dressing and omitted the onion. I read the reviews before I made it and used less brown sugar. I added fresh sweet onion to the salad instead of green onions. I am not sure that isn't too many changes to assign forks, but it is so good, I am giving it 3 forks anyway. It was a great way to use some leftover bean sprouts.

The whole family loves it!! My husband, who doesn't like spinach, loves it! This salad is always requested by our family and friends at gatherings. We like to double the bacon and egg (we're hearty eaters), but besides that we leave the recipe exactly the way it is. Weight Watchers 12 points per serving -- that's the only bummer part.

I've been making this recipe for years with the following adjustments - decrease sugar to approx. 2 tablespoons as previous reviewers suggested. Omit water chestnuts and bean sprouts, add toasted pine nuts and halve small mushrooms. Increase bacon (definitely use real) and be sure to toss in the egg. I've used both prepared dijon and dry mustard depending on my mood - both are great. And I keep the onion amount in dressing the same, using red onion, just saute very briefly before making dressing. I also omit the green onions depending upon the tastes of the diners expected. Try adding some thinly sliced grilled chicken to make this a summertime main course. Whatever you do, just try it.

Soak the cut-up onion in water for 10-15 minutes before putting it in the salad, that will make it a bit sweeter and less overwhelming. :)

I'm rating this recipe 4 forks the way that I altered it. Sliced mushrooms, baby spinach, diced cucumbers for the salad. For the dressing I used 1/2 of a Walla Walla sweet onion, omitted the ketchup, and used olive oil. My guests asked for the recipe. It was divine. Next time I'm adding sunflower seeds.

One of the best spinach salads I have tried. The dressing is very good, but be certain to use part of a SWEET onion. I also increased the bacon to 1/2 lb. Will definitely make this one again!

Everyone raved about this salad. The only thing I would change is the type of onion I used. I would go with a sweeter tasting onion rather than a basic white. Maybe use less too. My husband loves the recipe the way it is (he loves onions). I would certainly make this one again!

As the rest - this one is a keeper - I thought the onions were fine - if you like onions . . .

I too used less onion in the dressing and it was GREAT!! I omitted the chestnuts, sunflower seeds and the onions in the salad, but followed the rest of the recipe. One of the best salads with homemade dressings I've made. Will be eating it again tonight (leftovers) and I can't wait.

I made this dressing with the changes noted (less sugar and 1 TBLS onion) and served it with my regular spinach salad. It was wonderful! It would be great on an Iceberg or chopped salad as well.

Great dressing to be used on all varities of spinach salad. Defintely take the advice to reduce the amount of brown sugar. I decreased the amount of onion to half and added a tsp. of chopped shallots. I also eliminated the green onions -- no need for them with the flavorful dressing. I used toasted slivered almonds in place of the sunflower seeds. Delicious!

Wonderful salad in a snap - throw in a few walnuts for some autumn crunch, add some good red wine and crusty bread and you've got a top notch fall dinner.

Excellent - i agree with the other reviewers regarding the modifications to eliminate the onion and reduce the brown sugar in the dressing. I added sliced red onion to the salad itself instead. I brought this to a July 4th gathering and it was a big hit. Everyone went back for seconds!

Ditto to all the suggestions (i.e. 2 T. sugar, etc.) It was very good dressing.

This is a great spinach salad--it adapts well to lots of different ingredients (I used radishes, carrots, etc.), but what really makes it is the dressing, which coats beautifully and tastes great. I used less oil, and also decreased the amount of mustard and onion, and it was fine.

One kick butt recipe!!!!! Left out the bean sprouts water chestnuts and sunflower seeds and my husband thought it was the best salad he has ever had!!! Used only 2T brown suger and 1/4 onion. The dressing is killer. Make it soon!!!

The reviews definately aided it this salad being a winner the first time! Took the advice of lessening the brown sugar and onion in dressing. I still only used 1 1/2 tbl of brown sugar, was plenty! Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added a bit more baby spinach than called for. Definately make it again!

Made it twice. The first time I didn't have the bean sprouts or sunflower seeds and substituted the bacon with baco bits. I also used baby spinach. The salad was delicious, the dressing makes it!! The second time I had all the ingredients except for the sunflower seeds and it turned out great. This is a keeper!!!

Loved the salad. I thought it had a bit too much sugar so I cut it down to 2 Tbsp brown sugar. I also substituted Gouldens brown mustard for the dry mustard. As far as the onion, I used sweet Vidalia onion and added it to the salad instead of the dressing! It was a great salad! Everyone ate it - even my son the former spinach hater!
