good texture but back down on the salt- I'd lose at least a teaspoon

Wonderful! My first attempt at gnocchi; the recipe was easy to follow, and the results were well worth the effort. I used a ziplock baggie with a snipped-off corner instead of a pastry bag+tip. I served the gnocchi with sauteed mushrooms and squash. Everyone raved.

Delicious! Instructions are easy to follow and result in soft, tender gnocchi. Can be made with any combination of herbs you have on hand - i used parsley, basil, thyme and chives and it was great. It is time consuming, but to me it seems easier than making the traditional potato gnocchi and the results seem more consistent.

I modified this recipe and used a gluten free flour, since my children are gluten free. It was delicious! Definitely a keeper.

This was my first time eating and making gnocchi. I didn't have all the indgredients but it was still delicious. I excluded; chervil, chives, tarragon, Dijon mustard and the cheese. Instead to flavor it I used chopped garlic, kosher salt, cracked peppercorns and chopped parsley.

I made this a couple of months ago and it was fantastic. Time consuming, but you can make a ton and freeze them for later. http://cookingboucho n.blogspot.com/2008/ 03/gnoocchi-la- parisienne.html

One of the best gnocchi recipe's I've ever made. They come out soft and tender and so flavourful. I made double the recipe so I could freeze some and we just ended up unfreezing it the very next day.

Discussing this recipe with my Italian mother in law, the first thing she says is: "Those aren't Gnocchi!" She was however very intrigued to try them, so I'm bringing a batch to her this weekend - I'm sure she won't care what they're called after tasting them. In a word, this recipe is exceptional, an absolutely delicious savory treat.

Gallon ziplock for piping works well. I made a half batch, subbing basil for all the herbs listed, omitting the mustard, and adding 1 T minced lemon zest. I finished by drizzling the gnocchi with lemon juice. It was very, very good: especially considering that my b/f and I don't like Italian food! These gummy, yummy little pillows are a real treat.

This is THE best gnocchi recipe. Great with the mushroom/butternut squash recipe too.

Would love to have the recipe for the herb gnocchi. It doesn't seem to be there. If you could send it, that would be great. Sounds wonderful!!!!

Excellent recipe just as written. They gnocchi were so light and tasty!! I didn't have a 5/8 pastry tip so I used a heavy duty 1 gallon zip lock bag and cut a hole in one corner. Also used his tip of having an inverted taller pot next to my boiling water. A real help since the cooking process takes a while

This was my first time making gnocchi like this and the outcome was excellent. I much prefer these to the Italian potato dumplings. The combination of gruyere, mustard and tarragon is incredible. The recipe is flexible to add whatever herbs and cheese you would like. You could even try sun-dried tomato, asiago and basil. The recipe is very simple, straight forward and capable of so many changes. A great new recipe for gnocchi.
