I made these for a New Year's Day get-together and I thought they were wonderful. Not unlike hush puppies, but more tender. They came out very crispy outside and fluffy inside. I certainly didn't peel the peas and they came out fine. I agree with the reviewer from Philly that said the relish was way more than needed. You'll be perfectly safe halving that recipe. The relish is great. I could see blending leftover relish with some almonds and Parmesan to use as a Romescu-like pasta sauce. A keeper - could become part of my New Year's day traditions.

This recipe was...fine. It wasn't remarkable, it wasn't anything but mildly interesting because I had never made anything with raw beans soaked overnight, pureed, then fried - interesting technique, boring finished product. The relish was...also fine. I would give the recipe two forks on a scale of four, but one fork means okay, two means good...it was just...okay. A deep-fried bit of something with a decent dipping sauce - nothing you can't get at any mediocre restaurant.

Also, use the peas skin and all. It does not affect texture. And way healthier with skins on. I've made this twice already over the last week or so. Yesterday used them like falafels and put it in pita pocket sandwiches with avocado butter (just mashed avocado). last night ate them with hot sauce (off bottle) and drank w/gewurtztraminer. good tgif snack. I used peanut oil to fry; any other cooking oil will do.

Easy, peasy. Did exactly as told in the recipe. And it worked 100%. Ama..... zing!!!! Brilliant easy recipe. I don't know what the fuss is about it being tricky. I did not need so much oil either.

I sort of combined this recipe with the other BEP fritter recipe on epicurious. I added 1/2 cup peanuts to the food processor, which really goes well with BEP flavor. I also added thyme which was very good. When it came to peeling them, I got half of them peeled and then got tired. I don't know if it made a difference. When it came to frying them I used part coconut oil and part canola oil. I tried deep-frying them in a small pot and it began foaming and foaming and the oil spilled over.So the warning is that they make a lot of foam in the oil - be careful. After cleaning up the mess I ended up frying them in a pan with enough oil to submerge half the fritters, and then I would flip them. They came out WONDERFUL. They were so crisp and crunchy on the outside and had great flavor.I feel the peanuts added flavor and texture to the crust. The sauce ended up being 2 bell peppers and 4 tomatoes (the numbers got mixed up but I was happy with this ratio in the end), salt, 2 serrano chiles and spicy smoked spanish paprika. It also came out delicious and complimented the fritter well.

So I bought a can of BEP, and then read these reviews. I got very nervous that it wouldn't work, due to my canned beans. I found a solution, and the recipe worked REALLY well. Don't use an egg, use two egg whites. The egg whites will stiffen up the mixture. As well, I used about a 1/4 cup of bread flour (the italian "00") so that with mixing, enough gluten would form and again, help with consistency.

The recipe calls for dry peas which is why they require an 8 hour soak. The recipe does not work with canned peas. I usually remove the hulls, but the fritters are delicious either way. I have also served them with french onion dip as well as the relish and have received rave reviews every time.

These things were great. I tripled the recipe for a fundraiser for an African charity my sister's working for--we kept frying them and frying them and the amount in the bowl never seemed to diminish. We served them hot. I omitted the peppers in the fritters but kept them in the relish so that people could choose how much heat they wanted. They were a big hit! Relish was a bit watery though--next time I'll cook it down a little longer.

Made this for a Hannukah party and the fritters received rave reviews. I simply followed the directions, and they came out just fine. However, I felt that there was more relish than fritters. So either halve the relish or double the fritters.

I made this last year for New Year's Eve and it worked out wonderfully--at first I thought there was something amiss since the black-eyed peas weren't cooked, but that is the secret to the recipe. I think the reviewers who had problems might have used COOKED black-eyed peas which destroyed the texture. Delicious!

Made this for an appetizer for a special Christmas dinner... people couldn't get enough of it. Everyone asked for the recipe and I will definitely make it again. Probably would only cut back on the jalepenos slightly.

Utter disaster. I used canned beans (1 can) and canola oil heated to 360 checked with a thermometer. The fritters turnd into a million little bits of burned up bean paste, nothing worth retrieving. I added 1 tbl spoons flower and had the same result. I'm still interested because the relish was good but can't reccomend this recipe.

utter disaster. The fritters didn't work at all - very possibly my fault and the use of vegetable oil instead of peanut oil. Relish was great, though had nothing to serve it with.

I was absolutely delighted to find this recipe again. As a young child, I traveled to pre-Castro Cuba with my parents every winter. These fritters were my favorite street food. I remember them being called bollos. Back in the US my mother would often make them for me, including the very spicy relish, as a special treat. We always rubbed as much of the hulls as possible from the soaked peas, but now with the luxury of food processors this would not be necessary. I am pleased to see this traditional delight being passed on, it is too tasty to be forgotten.

Fantastic! I added the extra egg for the fritters and didn't put in any water at all, and the fritters came out beautifully. I tried to take the skins off the blackeyed peas but only about a third of them would come off, so I processed the heck out of these and had no texture problems. Probably wouldn't bother again next time. The dipping sauce was FANTASTIC too! I didn't have any fresh habaneros, so I used a single dried one for both the fritters and the dip. It was the perfect amount for the fritters, but some folks might find the kick too much in the dip. I did cook the dip for a lot longer than specified in order to get the right consistency. I would make this dip again to use with fresh veggies, chips, other fritters, chicken wings.

Remarkably good and really quick to make. I used frozen black eyed peas (defrosted) and didn't take the peels off, and I didn't have any texture problems. The batter will seem a little watery, but that makes them really light and fluffy. I saved the oil from last night's dinner party so I could make another batch today!

I have made this twice and it was very good both times, the relish is also very good and tastes better the next couple of days. The first time I did not peel the BEP's and had problems with consistency, 2nd time peeled and made them much better, it took a long time and was frustrating, so in a bit of a rush I just started putting the beans between my two hands and rubbed them together, it's efficient and I suggest trying that

This is a fairly authentic recipe for Akara. The only caveat is that it dosn't tell you to peel the black-eyed peas. I wonder if some of the people who had problems with consistency had too many skins left over from the black-eyed peas. It is best if you remove all skins before pureeing.

This was delicious. I LOATHE black-eyed peas, so I was searching for a better alternative for New Year's Day. My consistency wasn't quite right, so I added a bit of cornmeal -- these were quickly gone! (Also, I hate frying food, but these were worth it)

The Red Pepper Relish was excellent (4 forks) and I've made it countless times for other things (including pasta -- add a little heavy cream). The fritters were also excellent, but I did add more salt and chopped scallions for a little more zest.

I ended up double dipping them in the flour and egg to make them bind, as well.

There's good news and bad news about this recipe. I recently made it for a family celebration and it was the hit of the menu. However when made as directed, the fritters fell apart. I added additional egg and bread crumbs until they held together and fried them in about 1 - 1 1/2 inch of oil in a heave cast iron skillet. The salsa is wonderful and makes a lot.
