I think I found the (my) answer to the issues brought up here on this thread. For the issue on presentation: I added finely chopped red peppers. For the issue of "blandness": I caramelized onions and bacon with a dozen little necks in a separate pan and poured the whole thing over before serving. Delicious!

The flavors ARE very subtle, yet if prepared with quality ingredients, they are also VERY rich. You can't skimp on any of the components; each flavor is essential and needs to be at its best. Nor can you expect this dish to be what it is not: It's Barry White, not Michael Jackson

The finished fish lacked a little taste. I would suggest putting the vegetables over the fish. The best part of the recipe was leftovers! Take all the ingredients and put in food processor to chop roughly. Add one egg, 1/4 flour and make a Cod Cakes. We had plenty left over and made small 4 cod cakes. Flour cake and fry up in oil for a really tasty treat. We used these Cod, Potato and Fennel cakes on an english muffin topped with poached egg and bernaise. Yummy yummy

I would agree that this is a weekday dish, rather than a "company" dish. Not much to look at, but not at all bland in flavour, and I will make it again.

No mystery here, tastes just like it sounds. Bland.

I agree with many other reviewers who describe this dish as a good weekday meal. Easy to make but the flavor is mild so be generous with the seasoning.

this is a very simple and tasty dish but don't serve it for guests as sometimes it can look really bland and kind of gross as the potatoes grey up a bit. i usually add a sliced onion or leeks.

I absolutely love this recipe. I've made it 3 times now. I find nothing bland about this recipe (except the color!), and it is quick to prepare. The way the garlic, fennel, and olive oil complement each other with the mild cod is so tasty! I used a kitchen mandolin to thinly slice my potatoes and fennel, and I tend to prepare more of the veggies than the recipe calls for, as they are a great left over side dish.

Lovely subtle flavours. I used a good quality Italian olive oil and fresh, crunchy fennel -- perhaps this made a difference. I plated the dish as pictured accompanied by Epi's Balsamic Zucchini and a grilled tomato half. A sprinkling of finely chopped fennel fronds on the margins of the plate completed the presentation.

Nope. Very bland and tasteless.

I made this with sweet potatoes (as that was what I had on hand) and it was really wonderful - a huge hit for something that is very easy to make and doesn't require a lot of attention

I'm a little slow in posting how much we loved this dish - made it last March. I agree, not the best looking presentation, but what wonderful flavors! Served with a L'Ecole No. 41 '05 Chenin Blanc - great match.

I agree with the comfort food review. This dish is delicious, but rather unimpressive on the plate. Altogether a good week night standby.

My husband and I loved this dish. A way to have true comfort food, but in a healthful mediterranean way. And so easy! The fennel and garlic added just the right touch to be subtle and yet still give a punch. The cod was cooked to perfection, meaty and flaky. Never thought I would consider fish comfort food at its finest, but this dish is it!

I'll try this with haddock. My man doesn't like cod. Thinks it has worms. There is no cheese as far as I can see!

I was surprised to see a recipe that incorporated cheese and fish but I along with my dinner party were pleasantly surprised with how great it tasted. I made this dish for Thanksgiving 2 years ago in 2004 and I now have a personal request for it for Thanksgiving 2006.

This is really good and a breeze to prepare. I would not hesitate to make for company. A keeper.

This is a fantastic recipe. My husband, who is fairly borderline on fish in general, loves it. This is a weekday regular at our house. Easy to prepare and all you need is a salad to round out the meal.

Everybody in my family hated this meal. I am deleting it from my recipe box.

bland, bland, bland. But it is a good recipe for how long to cook cod.

This was a huge hit for Valentine's Day. I had a cold and I only chose this recipe because it was so easy - Wow was I surprised when it was so yummy. I should have know that the potato fennel combination would be incredible because of the Creamy Fennel & Potato Soup recipe on this site. My husband was running late so I had already cooked the vegetables for 30 minutes so I just let them sit on the stovetop covered for 30 - 45 minutes. The fish market ran out of halibut so I used sole fillets and rolled them up like a sleeping bag and drizzled them with a little olive oil and sprinkled with fennel pollen. Yum. I served them with roasted asparagus and thought the combination was great! My husband was moaning while he ate!

Oh so easy and beautiful. A wonderful weeknight meal and the kids all had seconds! It's elegant enough for entertaining, as well.

Oh, I love this recipe, too. It is simple, but with very good olive oil, it's just lovely. I tried it with turnips in the winter. Yum. It's so great to have a fish dish without dairy. Very rustic and satisfying.

This dish has become a staple in our home. Similar to dishes we've eaten in Italy. I like to add the fennel fronds as well as a little bit of vermouth on top of the fish. Good with tilapia, haddock or any other white fish!! Buon appetito!

My husband and I really enjoyed this meal. I took the advice of some other reviewers and added shallots and some white wine to the potato/fennel base. It added a nice level of flavor that I believe would have been sorely missed if not done. This is a good recipe to play with and I think there are a number of ways to dress it up. Some fresh herbs, a little cream, maybe some fresh ginger...have fun with this one!

Delicious, healthy, easy and fast. And the kids liked it. A perfect mid-week meal.

This dish is excellent and healthy and tastey. Those who say "no flavor" forgot the garlic or fennel. And this comes from a cook who really likes spicey, flavorful foods. You will not be disappointed unless you cannot follow instructions. Bon Appetit'

This is a great easy dish but Atlantic cod is overfished so check your fish source first. Also I added about 1/2 cup wine when I added the cod. I might consider adding olives next time. It is a versitile recipe that can be altered so many way by adding different herbs, etc.

Was very easy, but also very bland. The previous reviewers suggestion for lemon at the table is probably a good one. I think something else in the potato fennel bake, perhaps shallots.

easy as can be. i used the 2mm slicer disc on the cuisinart for both potatoes and fennel and took no time at all. needs a lot of lemon at the table to spice it up.
