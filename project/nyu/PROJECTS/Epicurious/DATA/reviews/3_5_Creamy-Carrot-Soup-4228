The quality of the carrots is really important. This is a subtle soup. I used 1/2 cup evaporated milk for extra creaminess. We make this often, serve with omlets.

Very good,mild, which is what I like and looks great with some chives and a little sour cream that smooths the taste too. Also cooked it quite long about an hour which I think improves the final result.

This recipe was already, but it was lacking a punch and creaminess. I added more spices and some butter to give it more taste.

I gave this recipe 4 forks only because I seriously added to the the recipe itself! Just from reading it, I knew that it would not be seasoned enough for my palate, so I did alot of modifications to it. Nevertheless it is a great "base" for a carrot soup. My additions: -I first browned a big tablespoon of curry in the pot with some olive oil. -after 2 mins I added to the curry: cumin, nutmeg, smoked paprika, oregano and fresh garlic, salt, black pepper. -browned the above spices for another 5 mins and then added green onions (scallions) and fresh thyme to the pot. Browned those for another 5 mins. I followed the recipe after this except I did add yam pieces to the carrots for creaminess. after puree-ing the mixture, I added 1/3 cup of maple syrup to balance the curry seasoning. Honey would work well to. Just adjust to your taste buds. -I didnt need to add any more cream to the soup because the yam made it creamy enough. The soup with the above changes was/is absolutely delicious!

Left out the beans (renders soup bland) and milk (so lactose-free). Added curry with the allspice. Very nice variation!

The soup was delicious. I added a few spoonfuls of dark brown sugar, and used potato instead of beans. It was sweet and creamy, alot like sweet potato soup. I served it alongside toasted garlic bread as well. Everyone loved it! From a family that hates the thought of anything slighty unfamiliar, their approval meant tons!

I'd really like to give this 2 1/2 stars. I thought the seasoning was a little bland but that was easily fixed - I added ground ginger and maple syrup, and replaced the fresh thyme with dried thyme. As a healthy, easy and fast carrot soup however, this is an excellent starting point. I can see using this often and varying the seasonings.

Wasn't impressed with this- too delicate for my tastes I guess. Served this at a dinner party for 8 and only one person liked it. I had just bought the carrots from the store but maybe they were old b/c the only thing I could taste in the soup was the beans.

I just made this soup for lunch, looking for a new version of carrot soup that my kids would still enjoy. So easy, quick, tastes great! Had no beans so I used potato instead- worked like a charm!

Very good. Prepared as written. Fooled everyone as they all thought it was squash. Had a great time making designs in the cream that we poured on top as a garnish. Will definitely make again.

This was great. I added 4 garlic cloves and used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 for the milk. Great recipe for the weight watchers program less than 2 points for a 1 cup serving and very filling. Thanks for the recipe I will be making this again.

YUMMY! I used regular salt chicken broth and added cumin instead of allspice. Also used leaks and fresh ginger instead of a regular onion and stirred in chopped cilantro at the end. VERY GOOD and easy to do! The whole family loved it.

A really good light dinner! Definitely needed salt, though. Didn't have any allspice so used cinnamon and nutmeg--worked great. Agree with the other user who said to really puree the beans well--they made it so creamy, my husband said he'd never guess it was beans and not cream itself!

Easy to make, with a mild, delicate flavor and a pretty bright orange color. I used vegetable broth and white kidney beans, and the beans were completely disguised in the finished product. I'd give it three forks for flavor, since I prefer things with a bit more punch, but everybody else here says to give it four. This soup makes a nice light meal with a hearty bread or works well as a starter.

I love this recipe. It has a very nice texture using milk, but a special velvety results if half and half is substituted for the milk. I use it both ways and usually serve cornbread muffins and fruit to complete the meal. My husband loves it too!

I have just finished making this soup, and we thought it was just delicious. I followed the recipe and added a little more thyme. I plan to serve this with a little cream drizzled on top with a few fresh chives for appearance. Served with a fresh salad of mixed spring greens, and away we go!

Very easy & tasty. I made it for my brother-in-law who just had jaw surgury and he raved about it. He enjoyed his thru a straw but we equally enjoyed ours with a spoon.

a very quick recipe and very good! great starter! I recoment to mix some fresh chopped parsley into soup just before serving.

Defintely needs some salt and pepper. Make sure to run the soup through the blender or foor processor long enough to really puree the white beans - otherwise the texture is not as pleasing.

This soup was really good. We made it with vegetable broth instead of chicken. It has a pretty orange color and looked nice garnished with chives.

This dish is nutritious and easy to make. I found the flavour of the beans somewhat strong. It was a good choice for a winter lunch.
