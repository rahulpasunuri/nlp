I am not a fan of vichyssoise but when I saw asparagus in it I had to try. I loved it. The mint in the cream adds a fabulous aroma and freshness to the whole dish. The cream adds to the texture and it is essential to make the soup full of different notes. It is simple yet sophisticated.

I've made this recipe multiple times to rave reviews. Use "No-Chicken" Broth to make it vegetarian.

Delicious...the essence of spring. I followed the recipe to the dotted i and crossed t EXCEPT...the cooking time of the asparagus will depend solely on its size. The bunch I purchased was pencil thin so they cooked up very quickly. My son, vegetable-hater, inhaled it without so much as a whine. He wasn't sure about the cold part, but he liked it. Perhaps being cold, the flavor wasn't so intense to his anything-healthy-I-hate taste buds.

I've never had better vichyssoise! The white sauce made a beautiful presentation but was not necessary and did not contribute to the overall satisfaction brought by this soup. This will be a popular dinner starter in my home, minus the cream.

I just thought the soup was okay. I think I'm just not a big fan of chilled soups. I would have just rather eaten the asparagus and ditched the soup idea.

I loved it. I did not make the cream topping, but instead just topped with chopped fresh mint. Very Spring! Made it for my ladies cooking club.

A little heavy on the asparagus, but otherwise delicious.

Very easy to make...the hardest work was chopping the veggies and the pureeing. The flavor was pretty good...not the best soup I've had, but considering its simplicity I'd give it 3.5 forks. The cream w/the salt and mint adds a very nice contrast and worth the minimal effort to put together.

Easy, fresh and delicious. Lovely and light with enough substance. Served alongside little rounds of bread with smoked salmon, onion and a caper. Perfect for lunch with Mum.

So very good, and so very EASY. I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth, I probably went a tad light on the asparagus, and I left off the mint cream because I'm lazy. It was delicious and light, and so incredibly simple. I will be trotting this recipe out throughout the summer.

Delicious! I was lucky enough to have fresh asparagus and leeks from the farmers market, and a sunny warm day to enjoy this on. The texture was very smooth and the taste was earthy and almost nutty. I used the whip cream and mint and everyone agreed that it added a nice extra element, although I might try creme fraiche or maybe yogurt next time.

This is so delicious! It tastes creamy even though there is no dairy in the soup. I found the whipped cream and mint drizzle to be superfluous. This was simple to prepare, didn't take much time and came out beautifully.
