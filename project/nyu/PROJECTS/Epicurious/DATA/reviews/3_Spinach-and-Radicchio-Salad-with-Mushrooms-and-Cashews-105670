Lovely salad, although I changed it a bit based on what I had at hand. Per the earlier reviews, I happily substituted red cabbage for the radicchio which added such a lovely color and crunch without the bitterness of radicchio. I also added crumbled feta cheese and beautifully ripened grape tomatoes. I didn't have any balsamic vinegar so I whisked a bit of dijon mustard into the Newman's Own Balsamic Vinaigrette that I had in the fridge -- it was wonderful and obviously easy. I served the salad alongside a grilled herb-marinated flank steak and garlic bread. This meal was so delicious and quick to the table.

I made this salad as a side salad for a baby shower and received great reviews. The cashews add a unique flavor and crunch. I didn't think it was bland or boring and would definitely make it again.

This was a nice side salad. I used red cabbage instead of radicchio as I had it on hand. It added a nice crunch and beautiful color. Balsamic dressing is standard at my house so it was nothing new but definatly tasty. I had no trouble with wilting. It's just important not to dress it till the last minute.

I was pleasantly suprised by how well this salad went over with my guests. Thanks to reviewer Gini who suggested subbing red cabbage for the radicchio.

If you wish to be totally EMBARRASED by taking an unproven salad to a gathering of friends characterized by a BLAND dressing, overpowering BITTER radicchio & REEKING green raw onion, then THIS is the salad for YOU. Pick another salad.

Great salad. Easy to make and very unique. I'd make it again, but cut back on the amount of dressing (had too much left over)

I found that the title and picture of this salad were more impressive than the actual salad. It was good but not terrific.

My guests really liked it. The colors looked beautiful together. My market had run out of radicchio, so I used red cabbage. It didn't have the bitter complement, but it was still awfully good!

This salad was extremely easy to make and really impresses people since it is a hybrid of your typical spinach salad. My dinner guests loved the salad and wanted seconds!
