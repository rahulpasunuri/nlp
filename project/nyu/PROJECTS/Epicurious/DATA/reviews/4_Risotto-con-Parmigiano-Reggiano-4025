Love this recipe! It's the perfect side for any meat dish. Very simple and easy to make, but very yummy and satisfying. Note: is very sticky and filling. Do not need to use all the cheese.

I just cooked this recipe and it is absolutely delicious!! The only thing I changed was that it was done with regular thick grain rice (I didn't go out to shop ingredients... I used whatever was available at home), and at the end I used some chopped basil instead of the parsley for decoration (also scent and taste).... the result was amazing... creamy and wonderful... Great Recipe!!!

After reading the reviews, I added about 2 cloves chopped garlic when the onions were almost done and 1/2 c. white wine after sauteeing the rice. I ended up with about a cup of broth leftover and it only took about 20 min to cook. I found this to be a very easy risotto and will definitely make it again.

Made this for Valentine's Day with Pork Chops Saltimbocca from this site (also really good). Very creamy and tasty and they went perfectly together. Had the leftovers with a fried egg for lunch the next day and a simple mixed green salad. Soooo good.

I loved this recipe and followed a few of the reader reviews as well--adding garlic, white wine, and taking the risotto of the heat before adding the butter and Parmesan. To those concerned about too much cheese: I've made this with freshly grated parmesan and store-bought grated cheese (it was what I had on hand). One cup of freshly grated cheese is perfect but 1 cup of store bought grated/powdery cheese will give you that overwhelming cheesy taste. For best results, go with freshly grated cheese but if you don't have that, I would add your already grated cheese 1/4 cup at a time.

Totally luscious. Per other commenters, added about half a cup of white wine after I'd tossed the rice in the butter for a few minutes. Crushed a few cloves of garlic and cooked those with the onions to start. Otherwise, cooked exactly as instructed. Used really good parmesan, freshly grated, and fresh, flavorful flat-leaf parsley. Whole process, from start to table, took nearly an hour, but I wasn't rushing. And worth every minute!

Hi. Honestly, I would make this again as written. Ok...here is the "however"... I made this tonight, with diced cooked chicken breast, white pepper, and another 1/2 cup parmesan, AND... my "Adkin's diet loving" husband said, after having eaten 2 bowls, that he wished he wasn't full...

I just tried this recipe, and love the results. I added about a half TBSP of garlic salt (omitted regular salt), and about the same amount of red pepper flakes and it turned out outstanding. Not overly flashy, but so easy and so much better than a boxed rice option. No real excuse not to try this. I'm sure some of the large qty would freeze okay, although most won't make it through the week in my house.

This recipe definitely does NOT need all of that cheese. I put it in to taste, and had almost 1/2 cup left. Doesn't need any salt either, since you get that from the parm.

This is the best risotto recipe. Everyone I have made it for has loved it. Really tasty and delicious.

Some of the best risotto I have ever had. Added a little wine before the broth based on previous reviews. Next time, will reduce the onion by a slight amount.

I've had risotto before, but this was my first attempt at cooking it and it was fantastic. High end comfort food, I followed the recipe but halved the parmesan, used my own homemade vegetable stock and tossed in some julienned sun-dried tomato. This was smooth, creamy and rich and satisfying! I did wind up using about 8 cups of stock, but I think my heat was too high.

Too gooey and too strong of an onion taste. I did not like this one at all.

Rating: 4
Fantastic recipe. As suggested by other reviewers some minced garlic is a nice touch and adding some wine before adding the broth is an absolute must. Also at the end take the risotto off the heat when adding the parmesan and butter. Stir it in and then leave the dish sit, covered, for a minute or two. This little touch will make the risotto lovely and creamy.

My first Risotto! And it turned out fabulous. Very basic and easy - really pics up the Parmesan flavors at the end - so use the best Parm you can find! Will use this as a base to make other varieties. A Keeper.

I agree with other reviewers: this makes a fabulous side dish. Just add a little warm wine right before adding the broth and it comes out amazingly. Makes a perfect accompaniment to salmon and grilled asparagus.

what a creamy wonder for a side dish. this accompanied a beef tenderloin with port- balsamic sauce. yum!

Very good. I added a little white wine before adding the broth, it added a little to the flavor. Paired it with "filet mignon with truffled mushroom ragout". EXCELLENT together. Will make it again paired together. Both are fairly easy to make and it makes you look like a 5 star chef to anyone who eats them.

For all those new cooks out there, a previous reviewer said you could use "Better than Bouillion". NO YOU CANT it is much too salty

Perfect! Very simple. A great alternative to a potato side or pasta. I doubled the recipe for a dinner party of 12 and it was perfect. Also, don't leave out the fresh parsley. The nutty warmth of the risotto and parm is freshened and brightened by the parsley. My guests were asking for the recipe as they left.

Before adding the first bit of broth, add a bit of white wine to help deepen the flavor. Also like the others said less cheese would be better.

Wonderful risotto. I paired it with balsamic briased duck and the combination worked perfectly. The risotto was brought to another level by just a tiny drizzle of reduced balsamic. It gave the dish a bright, sweet flavor that was mellowed slighty by the rich parmigiano-reggiano.

This risotto was easy and really good. I used a combo of parmesan, fontina, and asiago, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. so damn good! will make this many times.

The truly classic risotto. Try toasting the rice a bit after cooking the onions, and deglaze with a touch of white wine before adding in the broth. Add it a half cup at a time, stirring constantly, and it'll come out perfectly. Experiment with different hard cheeses. Parmesan is great, but try asiago. I really love it with pecorino al tartuffo (pecorino with black truffle shavings), it adds a bit of decadence, great for a special meal.

I made this with pot roast and garlic bread. It was so creamy even though I made it with long grain white rice. If it's just the two of you, make half the recipe.

My first try at risotto, and it was very good, though we realized at first bite that the amount of cheese should have been halved (I neglected to read all of the reviews first . . .)Not only did my 9-year-old son love eating it, but also had a great time helping me make it --

A great basic risotto so I gave it four forks to help bring it to the top. Use good ingredients-don't use cheap chicken broth or low quality parmesan! Although I insisted my family sit at the table just as it was done, it was actually very good reheated for lunch the next day.

An excellent basic recipe. I'd always had a fear of making risotto because of the potential for disaster, but this was simple and came out great! I've since experimented with slight modifications such as adding wine or tomato sauce to the broth and/or wedges of brie at serving, and always have excellent results.

very easy and wonderful. i use all 5 cups of chicken broth and i takes about 30 minutes to absorb....but it's so worth it. it's the extra broth and time that give it that tender creaminess. this is my favorite comfort food!

I made this recipe as a test run for a similar recipe that I was making for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and it came out great! It turnedout MUCH better than the one I ended up making a few days later. I added some truffle oil and it was HEAVENLY! I am making it again tonight!

This came out very good, but its the first time I've ever made risotto, and I've only tried it once, along time ago and at a restaurant. I think I needed a little more stock than the recipie called for, it came out a little heavy and and too sticky, the taste was great, but I'd probably let it absorb more liquid. Other than that it was fantastic definitely saved to my recipe file.

Excellent !!! Unlike the above review I had to use all the stock to end up with a perfectly creamy and tender risotto. I added 1/2 cup of julienned shitake mushrooms and 1/2 cup of thinly sliced cooked bacon ! SOOOOOO GOOOOD !!!!

I served this as a side dish with salmon and roasted garlic. Perfection!

This was my second attempt at risotto and it came out MUCH better than my first. Slowly adding the stock instead of all at once and letting it be absorbed made it cook much more evenly for me. I found that the recipe called for too much stock (I only used about four cups), but overall it was very good. I added grilled chicken and it made a great dinner for me and my boyfriend.

Rating: 4
A wonderful side dish, with so much room for variation. I used my own stock which makes a difference. Also, I carmelized shallots instead of onion, which made the dish slightly sweeter, and sauted the arborio until lightly golden for a nutty flavor. All in all, this was a perfect compliment for our main course.

Rating: 4
I make this dish at least every other month--it is a perfect risotto recipie to start from. There are SO many variations--add a little wine with the chicken stock, add mushrooms, spinach, or others for a variety of tastes and textures. And I love to top it off with some grilled chicken, pork or beef. Personally, I usually add a little garlic in with the onions, and I usually leave out the butter at the end to lighten it a bit (and I find I don't miss it).

I'm a vegetarian so I substituted veg broth for the chicken. I think that may have been a little strong for the recipe. The recipe was also too rich, even for a risotto; it had that kind of flavor that one tires of easily.

Rating: 3
So incredidibly easy and delicious. I found this product called "Better Than Bouillion" at the store; it's basically concentrated stock and you add hot water to mix it up. So much nicer than lugging giant cans of chicken broth home from the grocery store, or making your own when you have the time. I like to add about a half-glass of white wine to the rice before any stock (I'll open a bottle when I start to cook and finish it off as the night goes on, ha ha). Experiment with adding other ingredients...I like a bit of crumbled gorgonzola and a small handful of toasted walnuts. Proscuitto or bacon and sundried tomato is nice too!

Rating: 3
I used low salt chicken broth when preparing this dish, but I wouldn't suggest doing that. It ended up being very bland, so I had to add some salt. I love garilc, so I minced and sauteed a few cloves with the onions. This is a very delicious and filling dish.
