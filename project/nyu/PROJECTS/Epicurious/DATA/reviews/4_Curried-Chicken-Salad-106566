We made this recipe for tea sandwiches for a girlfriend's baby shower. They were delicious- easy to make and tasty. We reduced the red onion a bit. Cashews and grapes gave great flavor.

I have made this many time when mangos are in season. It's always a hit and super easy to make. Usually, I just buy a cooked chicken as it's summer and I have too many other fun things I want to do. This cuts the time down to about 10 minutes from start to finish.

i have made this before and enjoy it every time. tonite subbed a red apple for the fruit, added some diced celery and used sliced almonds toasted in some butter for crunch instead of cashews. equally good and i think i may prefer the almonds.i have made this for my book club and all liked it. i used the chickn i poached to make soup stock as this is economical.

I love this recipe. Have made this many times now. Close as I could get to whole foods, and better. Used chopped toasted almonds instead of cashews, little less curry, Greek yogurt, less mayo, no grapes but added currants, 3/4 of a mango. Winner!

Very delicious - I also included some fresh lime zest. As others have noted, it's easy to make variations - today I used 1 stalk of celery, dried cranberries and green onions.

I'm not gonna lie: this is truly a lot of work (the 35 minute time estimate is way low). But, for special occasions and picnics where you want to show off your spread, it's totally worth the time!

This is an incredibly easy and DELICIOUS recipe. I had chicken and some grapes. The grapes were on their last few days of being edible. No worries because this salad won't make it that long : ) Next time I make it I might omit the mango and add an apple for an extra crunch. I would highly recommend this fast and easy recipe.

i have made this recipe and variants several times for my book club. i think it is really special. some variants included or substituted raisins, nectarines, apple, celery. will try trader joes mango chutney. i used chicken salad from fairway and just added the yogurt no extra mayo. this was easy tasty pretty and just exotic enough. i did use less curry as i wasnt sure if the ladies liked it but will add more in future.

This is an excellent curried chicken salad. I used fage greek 0% fat yogurt, halved the red onion, and baked my chicken instead of poaching it in broth. I will be making this again and again. Also, I felt the 5 tsps of curry powder were fine--they made the salad very flavorful.

Rating: 2
I used low fat greek yogurt in place of the mayonnaise/yogurt mixture to make it healthier and left out the red onions because neither my BF nor I like them, so I added an apple instead. I thought it was bitter at first, but got better with sitting. Next time I would use some light mayonnaise because I think the fat would cut the bitterness. My BF didn't like it because it had fruit in it. Go fig - I thought the fruit was the best part. Still very promising, but only if I make it less healthy ):

Delicious! I made quite a few changes. I added vinegar instead of lime juice, apple instead of mango, golden raisins instead of grapes, and smoked sliced almonds instead of cashews. Awesome!!!!

SO good! I only had a pound of chicken, so I reduced the onion, cashews and grapes by a third. I used the full amounts for the sauce though, and the consistency was lovely. Also, I left out the mango, because I don't care for it. I served the salad on cucumber slices, which added a nice crunch.

Rating: 4
Totally delicious, though I modified with GREAT results. I used 2.5 tsp curry - plenty. Instead of mango/red onion/grapes, I used dried cranberries/green onions/red pepper/jicama. The jicama gave it just the right bit of sweetness/crunch and the green onions were just milder. YUMMY.

I have made this chicken salad at least 10 times and I never wrote a review. I thought it was time. This is by far the best chicken salad I have ever had. I follow the directions to the letter except one user suggested using some celery - so I used celery. Just terrific!! I get compliments on this recipe all the time and now when summer comes I am always asked to make it. Some users thought there was too much curry but I think it is perfect. I don't find it hot at all and I am not a real spicy food lover. Perfect summer salad!

Love this! There is a gourmet deli near where I work and when I go there, I always get the curried chicken salad sandwich, which is just awesome. I have tried in vain to recreate it until now!! This is such a wonderful recipe and my husband, who is not a curry lover, thought this was fabulous and has requested me to make it again often. I too decreased the curry powder to 3 tsp. and it was perfect. I also used Greek yogurt and it worked well. Just a terrific salad!!

An all-time favorite! Everyone in my house loves this recipe; I've served it at several parties and it's always a crowd pleaser. Love how the sweet of the grapes blends with the slightly tart mango and the spice of the onion. I try to cut everything into small pieces so that each bite contains some of each! This is my favorite recipe on Epi so far!

Easy. Mouth-watering. They rave...I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, reduced the curry powder to 1 tablespoon, used liquid honey (solid doesn't mix in well), fresh ginger, toasted almond sticks, and green grapes. I also added fresh chopped coriander just before serving. A classic, worth making often.

This has been a favorite recipe of mine since I discovered it. I make it a day ahead (if I can wait that long), that gives the curry time to bloom in the dressing, I use cashews, dried cranberries, and raisins, green onions as well. I also put celery in for added crunch.

Love this recipe and make it all the time. Make sure to use good quality curry powder and even then, add as you go as it can be overwhelmingly salty.I often add golden raisins and I love to add small pieces of chopped apple (any type but red) for an additional sweet and sour crunch!

Rating: 4
Wow, this is exceptional. I made about 1 1/2 times the recipe and used 1/2 Maharajah and 1/2 Rogan Josh curries from Penzeys as I knew the Maharajah for the full amount would have been overpowering. I love that the subtle layers of flavor with the sweet of the honey, grapes and mango, the underlying freshness of the onion,the hint of lime and the nice salty crunch of the cashews all without taking away from the poached chicken breast. I can't wait to see how all the flavors meld for tomorrows picnic at the jazz fest!

Easy and Very Tasty! I just used a rotiserrie(sp?) chicken from the store. Use all the curry called for! It seems like a lot, but so flavorful! Also, omitted mango because I couldn't find a ripe one. Was not missed at all. Served as sandwiches with fresh croisants or with big green leafy lettuce as a base or to wrap the salad in. Mmmmm!

I've made this dish a few times now and it has quickly become one of my favorite chicken salad recipes. I prefer grilling the chicken instead of boiling it. I also omit the mayo and used all fat free plain yogurt--the other ingredients are so flavorful you won't miss it! So simple and tasty!

Fabulous, easy, tasty chicken salad! I followed suggestions and added chopped celery, slivered toasted almonds, golden raisins, mango chutney (I didn't have fresh mango) and some ginger preserves. Also, as I was using "sweet" curry (not hot) I added the full amount the recipe listed. I also added a few dashes of cayenne for heat and the chicken salad was perfection.

We make this all summer long at Sido's House. It's a perfect salad for a romantic picnic and is lovely on little toasts or crackers -- or on a bed of salad greens. Depending on what's at the market or in the cupboard, I've switched out the fruits using dried apricots and sometimes golden raisins.

Rating: 4
Exactly what I was looking for. I've had this type of salad at several health food stores, and this turned out great. I picked up a little bitterness which leads me to believe next time I'd probably minus 1 tsp. of curry. Also, I didn't see a reason to dilute the chicken broth so much with water - I even used a cup less and the chicken came out boring. It wasn't as big of a deal once mixed in with the flavorful mayo, but you could just go with straight broth...mild point. Being a bachelor, this is a great recipe to make ahead and throw in a wrap or sandwich or just on a bed of lettuce. I'll definitely come back to this one.

Rating: 4
205 reviewers can't be wrong I figured. And they weren't. This is fast, simple and overwhelmingly good. I reduced the curry slightly to 4t based on other reviews and upped the mango to two. I doubted the chicken prep but boiling it worked just fine. It was a huge hit at a picnic. No leftovers and many requests for the recipe. I think it would work well served in pitas too. I'll be making this a lot more.

The best! The perfect dish to make ahead and take to the beach. I double the recipe and cut back on the curry because 10 teaspoons is a lot, 6 is plenty. Also use low fat mayo and it's still creamy. It's perfect on crackers as a snack as well.

This is an excellent curry salad, but if you use 5 teaspoons of curry powder, it's going to be very hot. I used only one tablespoon and it was still too hot for me, and I like things medium spicy. I'll cut back to 2 teaspoons next time and add more to taste if needed. Using less curry and adding some celery for more crunch were the only changes I made to the recipe.

i made this twice now and this is going to be a keeper. hubby loves it. great for a make ahead meal for the week and is oh so easy to make. the second time, i didn't have grapes or mangoes on hand so i used granny smith apples and raisins instead, which worked fine too. am planning to make it for our summer road trip to keep in the cooler.

I've always tried to make up a curry chicken recipe but failed every time. This recipe is definitely a winner. I used 3 teaspoons of curry powder, no mangoes, substituted green onions for red, greek yogurt since that's what I had on hand, and added jicama and walnuts for crunch. Great curry taste and the variations are endless. I plan on having it on a sandwich and doing a salad to. Next time, I might try it with celery.

i made this recipe for a bridal shower. i served it in mini pitas. i cooked the chicken the way it said to, although i was hesitant. it turned out perfect! i substituted lowfat mayo and nonfat yogurt. i used 3 tsp. of curry instead of the full 5. i used green onion instead of red onion, and used celery instead of the cashews because i didn't know if there would be anyone with a nut allergy attending. the celery gave it the crunch it needed! this salad was a HUGE hit with my family and i will be making it again for mother's day tomorrow!!

Made this for tea sandwiches for a baby shower. Omitted the fruit since it would be too chunky in the bread and I used canned chicken (Costco Kirkland brand). Put the chicken salad on raisin bread. Everyone loved the sandwiches and asked for the recipe. I would definitely make this again and do the full version for over a salad for a summer dinner or lunch.

This recipe has potential. I would not use red onion - too sharp - but replace with green. I like the idea of using 1c. mango chutney instead of trying to find a perfectly sweet and ripe mango. Next time I will add apples, raisins and celery.

I chopped everything finely, stuffed it in hollowed mini dinner rolls and served them at a cocktail party. My guests snarfed up every last one. As an aside, when I was growing up we called green bell peppers - mangoes. It's a very regional term and will be understood by most older people in northern Indiana. At a dinner party in San Francisco, a guest laughed about a holiday Jello salad that contained mango. She was shocked when I guessed she was a Hoosier, and she really meant green bell peppers.

Instead of the mango, lime & honey, try 8oz of chutney, a chopped apple and a cup of chopped celery (or jicama) for texture. It's delicious as soon as it is made, and even better the next day or so, as the flavors commingle. Serve w/ toasted naan and cucumber slices. Groovalicious, baby!

Wonderful basic recipe. I substituted green onions for the purple; golden raisins plumped in hot water & sliced almonds for the cashews, grapes & mango. I used 2 1/2 t. curry powder, but I think that 2 t. would have been enough for us. I didn't even look at the directions for how to cook the chicken (just cooked it the way I usually do), but I'll try that next time. I'm not sure how much yogurt & mayo I used. I just put what looked like about 1/3 cup yogurt in and added mayo until it looked like enough. That worked just fine.

I've make this a number of times and it's always been a hit. The only modification I make is to serve the cashews on the side so they don't get soggy if making a day ahead or if there are actually leftovers.

I can't enough of this! I also modify it a bit - I adjust the mayo/yogurt ratio to use less mayo and more yogurt. I probably also use less curry powder, and I add cranberries instead of mangos and grapes. But it's so versatile, I often just use what I have on hand.

I've been craving curried chicken salad ever since the local restaurant took it out of rotation. This recipe here is a delicious, but is missing a little something. I might try adding cilantro and/or a little celery...possibly a dash of cayenne for a kick. I do, however, agree with previous reviewers about the slightly excessive amount of curry powder (I found 4 tsp to work well).

Rating: 3
This is an easy and very tasty chicken salad. Personally, I thought the amount of curry powder was excessive. I cut it back to 3 teaspoons and it still burned my mouth. I also like cutting back on the calories a bit by using yogurt with mayo. Next time, I'm going to try adding some cilantro--I think that would be a good addition.

Delicious, memorable chicken salad! I made some substitutions based on our tastes - scallions (white and green parts) rather than red onion, chili-rubbed dried mango from Trader Joe's chopped into pieces, golden raisins instead of grapes. I also added a splash of white wine to loosen the dressing before tossing with the chicken. This is an excellent version of curried chicken salad. Even better than my favorite from Whole Foods. Enjoy!

We LOVED this salad from the 1st time we tried it ! I was a bit hesistant to cook the chicken the way it's described but it gave the most incredibly moist chicken one can dream of ! It's now definitely a keeper. The perfect balance (with a little less curry to our liking) in nuances of tastes and textures, the lightness of the dressing, etc... It's the PERFECT salad for hot summer lunches when you just don't know waht to serve ! ;-) Thank you !

This curried chicken salad is great! The chicken breast was flavourful and tender. I ate it for breakfast this morning after serving it at our family dinner last night. I would caution other cooks to start with 4 teaspoons of curry powder and then add more if necessary; also, you might want to only use half of an onion. The mangoes are a must, but I omitted the cashews and the salad was still excellent! I feel like making this recipe again this evening!

I made this on a day I didn't have anything in the fridge and had to make a lot of substitutions, but it was still delicious.

I do not know how anyone could give this recipe a bad review!! If i want some when i make it, i have to make a double batch as my husband can't stop eating it! I make my version with leftover chicken from the grill. Hand shred it and it's perfect. I've found that most of the curry powder i buy has salt already in it, so be sure to taste before adding that extra salt as i find it's too salty if you add in the extra.

Ever since I was a little girl I have dreamed about preparing the food for my own (small) wedding, and over the years I have made adjustments and additions to the menu in my head.

Simply delicious! This was, I think, one of the best chicken salads we've ever had and certainly the best I've ever made! We skipped the mangoes and added dried cranberries. The next day I used the leftover sauce on more chicken I grilled and added in toasted almonds and crans. If you like curry, you will LOVE this! It gets better after it sits a while, so it's a great do-ahead.

This was a good variation on a curried chicken salad that I normally buy (gasp) from a local high end grocer but I think I'll take the hints from this and doctor the store-made next time.

Very very good, and easy. Because of the heat wave and not wanting to turn on the stove, I bought a rotisserie chicken, which made this even quicker and easier.

Ran out of ground ginger so I used garam masala, which was wonderful.

Easy and very tasty. I made the dressing exactly as written, and at first thought it was a little too sour without much of that sweet/curry flavor that this salad usually has in restaurants. However, after sitting an hour it was very good. I did not have mangoes or cashews so subbed green apple and almonds; I think the texture of the apple was better, though I love the flavor of mango.

Rating: 3
This is a good recipe for those hot summer nights when you want a light meal. The red onion I used was unusally hot, so next time I will probably try green onions instead. The mango seemed to "disappear" somewhat, so I will probably use two next time, and cut them in bigger chuncks. A nice alternative to the cashews would be toasted almond slivers. All in all, a nice recipe.

Took the serving suggestion from Modesto and used the mango halves as bowls. PERFECT!!!!

I love this recipe! The only thing I would suggest is that it makes a great presentation if you halve the mangos and serve the salad at each plate inside a mango half. (don't forget to slice a small bit off the bottom so the mango stays put). Makes for a colorful and tasty side dish. Enjoy!

Love this recipe! Mango (my favorite fruit) was available, but I would have used peaches if I had to substitute. I did toast some pecans instead of using cashews, and about 3 tsp. of curry powder seemed to be plenty for me (taste as you go). Went nicely with broccoli quiche, if you want to serve something warm as well.

This has now become my favorite chicken salad recipe (replacing a walnut-apple-dill recipe I've made for years) and everyone I've fed it to has loved it. Adding a spoonful or two of Mango chutney is a nice touch. And sour cream works as a substitution for the yogurt in a pinch.

Good recipe - have made it a few times. I like to let the chicken sit in the cooled cooking liquid for a few hours and then dress the chicken well before serving to absorb the dressing. Toss the rest of the ingredients right before serving - as to not get soggy. Do not use overly ripe mangoes - they get soggy and do not have the proper consistency. Good served on a bed of greens (baby spinach). Here is the deal with the quantity of curry to add: All curry is different. Some blends spicier than others and some that have sat in your closet for 3 years have lost much of their kick. I've used the prescribed quantity with commercial curry and it was mild, I've also used 1/2 the amount of curry, but with freshly ground curry powder and it was firey hot. Thus know your curry or start with a little and add accordingly.

I make this dish a lot! Just made it again yesterday for a lunch gathering and everyone wanted the recipe. Everyone who's ever tried it loves it. I usually make it according to the recipe, but have also substituted when I didn't have all the ingredients on hand: light sour cream for yogurt, fat free mayo, different onions, leftover roasted chicken. I often serve the chicken salad at room temperature along with warm sticky rice. Sounds weird, but it's a nice combo. Warm crusty bread is also a nice accompaniment.

I have made this a couple of times, last time didn't have mango and used regular yellow onion instead of red, added celery as some suggested, still delicious. My kids all raved over it (all 4), and it is extremely easy to make! Recommend this highly to anyone who likes curry!

Excellent! I added celery and scallions, substituted walnuts for cashews and fresh ginger for powdered. Also, as suggested, I used 3/4c plain yogurt and 1/8c mayo and reduced the curry to 2T. So good!

A delicious recipe that takes little time or effort. The curry really makes this dish pop, so I would recommend using the best curry powder you can get for optimal flavor. I substituted fat free yogurt and reduced fat mayo and still got intense flavor.

I don't know why people rate a recipe and then go on to say that they substiuted apples for grapes, green for red onions, almonds for cashews, left out the mango and mayo - added raisens, celery and the kitchen sink - and then procede to announce that it is or isn't a good recipe. This is an excellent recipe. If you don't like mango, leave it out but don't substitute oranges. If the chicken breasts are poached you will have a delicious, flavorful, moist chicken - not to be compared with a store bought, overcooked dried out chicken. If you prepare the dressing seperately you can taste as you go to get the right amount of curry. Dressing can be stored overnight to let the flavors meld then combined with the chicken mixture the next day. ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.

EASY, DIFFERENT, AND FLAVORFUL This was a great chicken salad recipe - not the heavy mayo laden version you will find at supermarket take out counters. I too added the mango chutney instead of the fresh mango and I shredded the chicken instead of cutting it in cubes; this gave the chicken salad a more organic texture which i think was considerably better than the traditional route. This dish made it's debut at a party and it was very well received - i have already sent several people to this site!

This was FANTASTIC! But. I felt the mango was not much of an addition, it is still SUPERB without it. If you are looking to lighten up this dish, BY ALL MEANS completely replace the mayonaise with the plain yogurt, you can't tell the difference at all. Also, I used a store bought rotesserie chicken to save time. yum yum.

As stated by other reviewers, "Phenomenal Recipe!" I too used Mango Chutney to taste instead of the fresh mango, added 1/4 cup of coconut milk and substituted 1/2 Granny Smith apple for the grapes. I also baked the chicken as suggested by another reviewer but will boil in chicken broth according to the recipe for the next time. Chicken breasts have a tendency to dry out when baked.

My husband was never a fan of curry but WOW!!! He can't get enough of it. This salad is amazing. I agree with leaving out the mango. You can pretty much play with the veggies in this chicken salad and still be a star!!

I loved this! Oh my, it's good. Some changes I'll make next time: nix the mango - don't like the texture and with the curry dressing on it, you really can't taste that it's mango. You think you're getting another chuck of chicken, but instead you get something mushy...it's a texture thing. Also, I would use whole cashew halves for more crunch instead of chopping them. I added celery, used green onions instead of red, and added lime zest to the dressing. My husband who is not really a chicken salad fan and definately not a curry fan ate 1 1/2 sandwiches. He did say though that he much prefers the chicken salad with grapes and walnuts from this site. It's really great too.

Yes, make it! I made it for my Supper Club group and it got great reviews! I did not use the mango but that's the only change I made.

Fabulous. I love to make this dish for others - it always wows them. I cut the curry to 3 tsp, 1/8c mayo and 3/4 of yogurt, and substituted apple for mango. Left out the grapes entirely, and used green onions (or skip the onions if I don't have any). Definitely hold off on those cashews till serving time and don't overchop (I just broke them by hand). Terrfic on pita. Every time I serve this people ask for the recipe. Success!

Have made this many times, it is definitely a keeper and a GREAT summer salad. Although I had a two jars of curry powder opened and wanted to condense them so ended up using Hot Curry powder in the recipe this time and didn't enjoy it nearly as much...too much kick (and I love spicy foods), but with the red onion it was just too pungent and strong and not as refreshing as it is w/ a less spicy curry powder. But again, a great chicken salad!

After several tries, I finally got it perfect for our family. Here are my "tweaks": 2t curry powder, half a red onion, 1 1/2 t of honey, and a small handfull of chopped fresh cilantro. Delicious -- even my picky 5 year old ate it!

Very delicous. To save on time I used already cooked chicken. Recipe good as is and was a hit.

This dish is for those folks who really love the savory / sweet combination in dishes. I made only small changes. I roasted the onion slices first as I don't care for raw onion in salads. I also added a diced apple, about a half cup of golden raisins and nearly doubled the curry as the brand I had was extremely mild. I took to a community association board meeting potluck and got raves. Will definitely make again.

I baked my chicken breasts at 425F for 20 minutes after marinating them with salt pepper, a drizzle of olive oil and honey. The chicken turned out great! I used walnuts and toasted them in a pan; an apple instead of a mango; a regular white onion instead of a purple onion; raisins instead of grapes; and I added a 1/4 cup of canned coconut milk for extra flavour-- Superb tasting! I served this on a bed of green leaf lettuce with the balsamic vinegar and butter glazed carrots (recipe found here at Epicurious). Tasted healthy and very summery! It was excellent!

Have made this many times. Always serve on a bed of baby greens and it never fails to please. This is a great salad as written, but it also adapts well. Depending on what I have on hand, I have added or deleted ingredients: green and/or black grapes rather than red; papaya instead of mango or a combo of both; sliced kiwi, pineapple chunks, celery and raisins instead of mango or papaya; toasted almonds or pecans in place of cashews; a sprinkling of pomegranate seeds or shredded coconut - all are great variations. I always add lime zest and finely grated fresh ginger to the dressing, and cook the chicken in broth only. Since one is only poaching and then steeping the chicken, and not boiling/stewing it for a prolonged time, I never understood why the recipe asks for 4 cups of water in addition to the chicken broth. Seems entirely unnecessary and I think the water will only draw flavour out of the chicken. Perhaps someone has the rationale behind all that water???

This is fantastic. Definitely agree to start with 2 or 3 teaspoons of curry and taste your way to more. I used green onions instead of red, and used less mayo and a little extra of lowfat yogurt. Absolutely wonderful. One of the best recipes I've tried from epicurious. Excellent on thick slices of toasted 7-grain bread with lettuce.

This was good, I was skeptical about adding the mango but then added it and I am glad I did. It was slightly sweet, I also used vanilla yogurt, not plain. Because it had grapes and mango the vanilla tasted fine. It was aten up fast.

A few suggestions after reading all fabulous the reader's comments: 1. Curry is a blend of several spices so its intensity will vary depending on the blend you buy. Season to taste UP to the 5 t. suggested in the recipe. 2. If substituting flavored yogurts, like pina colada, check the label for high fruitose. It's NOT healthy. Neither are aspartame sugar substitutes so don't substitute sweetners for honey. 3. Bottled lime juice cheapens all your good efforts. Buy limes (lemons too)when they're on sale. Squeeze and freeze the juice in pre-measured increments in zip-lock bags and note the quantity and date on the bag in permanant marker. Freeze flat so it's easy to break off a frozen chunk when only a small amount is called for.

It's mango season and 2 of us showed up at a luncheon with Mango Chicken Salad. While people politely ate the other salad, they gobbled this one down. One woman got caught eating it directly out of the salad bowl before she moved the bowl to the other end of the table. I followed the recipe exactly and added a bit of fresh cilantro as I thought it could use a bit of green and, cilantro, mango and curry blend nicely.

We thought this salad was great. It lends itself to a great many variations. I substituted dried apricots and toasted almond slivers for the fruit and nuts, added some celery for additional crunch and substituted scallions for the onion to make it milder. I split a large foccacia and spread the salad on it, and cut it into wedges for a party. It disappeared in a flash and there were rave reviews.

My grandmother used to make a dish similar to this but it was hot and served with rice. So to re-create it i ommited the mango and used apples, mixed it all together added the chicken and warmed it up in the oven in a caserole dish until the apples were tender, it blended everything so nicely! And i served it with coconut rice (used the leftover broth from the chicken to cook it in along with coconut milk)

This is a great recipe! However, I did change a few things... I got chicken breasts with bones and baked them in a caserole with white wine at 400 for one hour. Instead of mayo, I used all yogurt. I didn't use mango and instead put in crushed pineapple. Instead of the celery, I used diced red bell pepper. It's prettier and I like it better. I am lucky and have a source of great homemade Indian curry powder - so it was a tad spicey, just the way I like it. Yes, I made a few changes - but I try to make due with what I have at home and it turned out great anyways! It's a great recipe - easy and with lots of veggies... would also be a great way to use up leftover turkey! My friend who swore she didn't like curry was surprised when she liked this... I'm definitly making this again.

Readers make the best suggestions! I substituted 1/4 C. green onion (instead of red), half of the curry which is plenty, used apple for the fruit, and raisins (instead of grapes). Using the rotissary chicken from SAMs saved time. Add cashews right before serving to keep them crunchy. So yummy! I plan to serve this to my supper club in a few weeks!

This is my new favorite cold summer salad. I took the suggestions of previous reviewers and used green onions for red, mango chutney (available at Trader Joe's) for fresh mango, and added curry powder to taste. I also didn't have plain yogurt and subbed creme fraiche. This dish is best made the night before to let the flavors meld.

Rating: 3
Very good, and I'm not wild about curry. In the future I might use cold fried chicken or deli chicken, because the poached chicken didn't really add anything. Even though mangoes are my favorite fruit, in the future I think I'll use either a mango and a crisp chopped apple, or just apples. Tip: no matter how tempting, do not mix salad with your hands, my nails are now bright yellow

This is a very tasty, very easy-to-make summer salad. I made exactly as the recipe states and thought it was just the right amount of everything. (To the cook that thought there were too many onions, I wash my chopped onions, makes them less onion-y). Would be great for showers, brunches, etc.

Wonderful,served at a luncheon at my home, everyone loved it! Made the following changes to the receipe: 2 1/2 teaspoons of curry (instead of 5 teaspoons),raisins instead of grapes( I used baking raisins which are much more moist than regular raisins) scallions/green onions instead of red onions and nonfat yogurt in place of reg yogurt.I made it the day before seving, and added two stalks of finely chopped celery and 1/2 cup of toasted almonds ( instead of the cashews) just before serving. Served it on a bed of mixed greens, with a bunch of red grapes on the plate as well as a homemade orange muffin. Looked great, tasted even better!

This was really good. I'm doing low carb so I used all mayo and no yogurt. I used chopped scallions instead of red onion. I agree that you should start out with less curry, then taste and adjust. Two of my friends at work tasted it and said they were going to make it the same day!

I used left over rotisserie chicken, probably not enough, which is probably why it was pretty mayonaisey. Ialso didn't add yogurt. But I really liked it and my husband even thought it was pretty interesting. Good way to use up leftover chicken.

This is a fantastic recipe. I do skip the mango, but use all of the curry powder called for, and increase the grapes. I have made it a number of times with no mayo (only yogurt), and a few times w/ a little mayo and a little more yogurt. Works well both ways, but is MUCH healthier with yogurt. The best way to serve it is in Syrian bread, or pita, when the chicken is still a little warm. YUM!

Great curried chicken salad recipe! Followed recipe very closely, just substituted 1/3 cup golden raisins for grapes. I think a chopped cilantro garnish would enhance the presentation and flavor and I am planning to get some to use with the leftovers. Served it with homemade Indian naan from this site.

I'll add my raves to all the others. This is a keeper! I, too, used deli chicken, the whole thing, light and dark meat. I couldn't find a mango so I used chutney. I, like many others, used scallions instead of the red onion and added some almonds as well as the cashews, mainly because they stay crunchier. But the result was delicious and all loved it, even my daughter who "hates" mayonaise. I fibbed a bit and told her it had a dressing made with yoghurt, and she loved it. I did use more yoghurt than the mayo--just a bit of the latter for flavor.

I tend to read recipes then go on my own - did it that way and made too much dressing - took another cooks advice and added pasta to soak it up. I've made it about 6 times each times with RAVE reviews and the winning recipe to date is: pasta, green onions for red onions, added pineapple, canned oranges, even removed the chicken once for a vegetarian salad.

I prepared the dressing the night before so the flavors would blend better then substituted a supermarket rotisserie chicken (mojo rubbed), decreased the curry to 1T, upped the honey to 1T and substituted raisins for grapes (I was concerned the dish might be too wet and possibly slimy otherwise). I served it on a bed of field greens and reserved half the cashew and sprinkled them over the top just before serving. The end result was delicious with a nice blend of contrasting flavors and textures. Very easy and I'd definitely make it again.

This was a great mid-summer treat! I doubled the recipe, other than the curry powder (which I left at 5 tsp), substituted green onion for the red and a can of pineapple chunks instead of the mango.

This was great to make for a summer picnic in the park!! Not being an onion fan, I replaced it with a cup of jicama and also added a chopped jalapeno for kick. I thought the amount of curry was fine and I heated the powder up in a skillet before adding to dressing. It really helped bring out the flavor.

This is so good and really easy. Used only yogurt and didn't miss the mayonnaise a bit. Don't make the same mistake I did and overchop the cashews otherwise their flavor gets lost. Agree with adding a little more lime juice - somehow I think it enhances the flavor of the grapes and mango.

I made this for a baby shower (quadrupled the recipe) and almost didn't get to taste it. It flew off the table.

This is a great salad for the summer. Since I love curry, I use the entire amount called for in the recipe. However, I can see how a lot of people would want to cut it down. If you substitute fat free yogurt for the mayo, it makes this a healthy, heart-happy meal!

Just wonderful with a few changes on my end. I added a large can of mandarin oranges in place of the mango. I used Vanilla Yogurt instead of plain, and used more than the recipe called for because I added pasta. I used Fat Free Miracle Whip in place of the mayonnaise, and this was great because it is a sweet recipe. I majorly cut down on the curry powder and used scallions instead of red onion. I also added chopped celery, and used slivered almonds instead of cashews. I used red grapes as well as green grapes. I added half of a chopped green apple and half of a chopped red apple for more color and crunch. I also added a cup of fun shaped pasta to stretch it out. I have 5 little boys and they could not get enough of it! I had croissants for them to use, but they were eating it by the spoonfuls out of the bowl! They also had fun dipping crackers in it. It was a fun, refreshing, light spring treat for them. I don't think the kids knew how healthy and good for them it was. I had them eating so many wonderful and healthy foods without even having to twist their arms! I planned for it to last 2 days, but the family had it gone the first day. Hooray!

I used chicken thighs which gives a better texture,even though they are not the traditional choice , and substituted light sour cream for the yogurt, and scallions instead of red onion, which works more subtly in this dish. Also I substituted green for red grapes, and left out the mango, putting yellow raisons in instead so that it would not be too moist. I used the fresh mango as a side dish, along with chutney. The cashews I used were not salted. This is a very flexible recipe, and I think most changes, if not out of 'character' can work very well, as long as the basics remain. My rating is for the recipe WITH changes.

I liked this a lot, but I would also cut back a little on cumin next time. I used green grapes instead of red which were fine. I like red onion, but I agree with another post that green peppers or scallions would work well equally for those that don't like the strong taste of red onion. I am taking it on a picnic tomorrow and I think I'll serve it with baby romain leaves and eat them like a lettuce wrap.

I liked the idea of this recipe but I would alter some things next time. For one, I would lessen the amt. of curry. I thought it was a tad strong. I also didn't really like the red onions.

Definitely a keeper! I used Vanilla yogurt (didn't have plain) and I 1 TBSP of honey. I added the mango, but couldn't really taste it--also added a Granny Smith apple (nice crunch, taste and flavor). I was serving it was salad, so I added penne pasta and it made a really great and more filling meal. I also added a little more curry sauce (since I added the pasta) and used salt and pepper to my taste. My friends thought it was delicious! And also easy and quick to prepare.

Super dressing. Everyone I've served this to has eaten every morsel; today my ladies' French language group. The mango may be superfluous. I think the grapes could simply be increased as a substitute, or, as some others have done, apples used in its place. I followed others' advice and made it the day before, adding the fruit the next day. Nuts could be increased if you like more crunch. Definitely a winner.

I used hot curry powder for added bite, substituted granny smith apple for the mango, halved the onion & replaced with diced celery, used slivered almonds instead of cashews, and added cilantro at the end. It was so good I'm going to double the recipe next time so I always have some on hand in the fridge.

yum, yum, yum! I also substituted green apple for the mango and it was absolutely delicious. A perfect summertime sandwich. I don't usually eat much chicken, but I just loved this recipe - I can see this becoming a regular.

When I first tasted this salad, I thought the curry to be a little overpowering. We did not eat it until the next day, and what a difference! Allowing the flavors to marry is the key here. I used more of the red grapes than called for and substituted the mango for green apple. I also doubled the amount of chopped cashews, added 1/2 cup chopped celery and the different textures were wonderful! I disagree that the amount of red onion was too much, it was perfect! I can't wait to try this out on friends at our next get together.

This recipe is superb! I prepared to make it the first time using all ingredients as listed, but decided as I mixed to cut the quantity of grapes and mango in half for each. (I made mango raita with the leftovers.) Perfect. . . it's for dinner again tonight.

I served it on a bed of leaf lettuce and added a sprinkle of coconut on the top. Next time, I'll add more honey than the recipe called for. Even with the fruit, it needed a little more sweetness.

Definitely a show stopper!! I had 30 people for a luncheon party in which I served serveral salads dishes. This one was gone quickly. I had many requests for the recipe. Fabulous texture and taste combination.

I tweaked this a bit to suit my taste utlizing some of the suggestions below and some new ones - it was EXCELLENT! I wrapped the leftovers in lettuce leaves - it makes a great cold spring roll! I used a combo of light and dark meat, used "light" mayo and upped the yogurt a bit, used a TBSP of honey, cut the onion in half and added a chopped large rib of celery, substituted a granny smith apple for the grapes and used more nuts.

this was an excellent chicken sald recipe. I too left out the mango and thought the taste was perfect. I served it on a bed of greens for an outdoor luncheon and everyone raved about it.

This is great! I cut down on the amount of red onion, and used more like a tablespoon of honey in the dressing, but otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter. Served it tonight with grilled garlic cheese bread. My four-year-old daughter gobbled it up, and my SO asked me to be sure and buy some pita bread tomorrow so he can make a sandwich or two with the leftovers. I will definitely make this again.

The dressing is delicious, but next time I would cut the onions in half and add celery. Also I think the grapes and the mango together was a bit too fruity -- I'd just use one or the other.

I haven't made this, but the curried turkey salad that is posted on Epicurious is awesome!

I tried this out first on the hubby who loved it and then made a triple batch of it for my sons graduation party and had great reviews, teenagers and adults wolfed it down with a rice salad on the side and warm french bread. It is a great dish to make for a summer gathering. In England this dish would be called "coronation chicken"

Good summer evening dinner. Not too heavy. Comes together quickly.
