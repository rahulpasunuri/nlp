Delicious! Served with the asparagus lemon pasta. Toasted the bread rather than grilled it.

Actually, 3 1/2 forks would be fair. The next time I make this I will use a combination of basil and arugula to achieve the taste I'm looking for. Also, I prefer the traditional fresh mozzarella rather than smoked. Be sure to use a good quality bread, and the rub of garlic and brush of extra-virgin olive oil are a must.

Have to say that while everyone loved this and I even grilled the bread, I was unimpressed with it. I actually think the smoked moz. was just not right. Next time I will just go with the tried and true fresh moz. but will still add that arugula to keep the bruschetta nice and peppery.

This was a big hit at the party I brought it to this weekend. Make sure you serve it with the grilled or toasted bread rubbed with garlic. We ran out of the toasts and used crackers as a base for the last few servings and it wasn't nearly as good. Rubbing a garlic clove over the toast makes all the difference!

This was awesome! I had a ton of basil available, so I used that instead of the arugula - huge hit. I make it at least once a week now. I also made garlic olive oil and brushed the grilled bread with that before topping it. DELISH!

Make sure you chop everything really fine - otherwise, it tumbles off of the bread. The flavors are wonderful, it's a very nice summer hors d'ouvre.

I'd make this again but with some additions. I added chopped fresh basil and some grated parmesan to the mix to add to the flavor. I also added onion, which I definitely won't do again. Even though it was just a tiny bit, it took over the other flavors.

This is quick, but I thought it was a bit bland, and no show stopper. It's just OK to me

This is yummy. I do go a little lighter on the smoked mozzarella as it can be a little overpowering. I have made this a couple times for neighborhood get-togethers and people love it.

Took these to my book club party and they were a big hit. Went well with red wine before dinner. Definately heat them up before serving as that does make them better. Cleaning and picking through the arugula, and seeding and chopping tomatoes did take some time but it was worth the effort.

We loved this recipe - we added home made pesto to the bread before putting the arugula/mozz mixture on top - that was a nice touch that helped keep the crisp bread a little bit soft - easier to bite into. Everyone raved about it. Heirloom tomatoes and homemade organic pesto make this a four fork recipe - definitely.

Seasoned properly with salt and pepper this dish is very good. Do not melt the cheese.

Can't figure how this one gets such high ratings when there are so many other, much tastier bruschetta recipes on this site--e.g., the roasted yellow pepper recipe is great. This combination just didn't do it for me.

Perhaps it was that I decided to shop for ingredients on a Sunday, but I could not find smoked mozzarella in either of two supermarkets. I opted instead for smoked gouda and was not disappointed. This is a great recipe made better with home grown tomatoes!

This is wonderful, particularly when served warm after broiling. You can also toss this (discovered the trick with left-overs) with hot cooked pasta & extra olive oil for a wonderful main course.

Excellente! The argula really makes it!

I have made this recipe time and time again. It is fast and easy and a great appetizer for guests. Sometimes I make it for an entree for my husband and I on a hot evening. Do not use fresh smoked mozzarella...does not do as well. Use a great olive oil too, makes all the difference.

Just made this for a belated holiday office party and we all loved it. I never thought bruschetta was anything great till I had this. Easy & quick. I lightly broiled it as suggested by other reviewers.

Oh my goodness! I (and my guests) loved this recipe, fairly easy and soooo delicious! Definitly a keeper!

There is a lot of chopping with bruschetta! So leave enough time for it. It was great & everyone loved it. The smoked mozzarella is a must.

Fairly easy recipe--the most time consuming part is chopping, but you can do everything ahead of time. I topped all the bruschetta a couple hours in advance and it didn't get soggy at all. When guests arrived I popped them under the broiler for a minute to melt the cheese. (Seemed to taste a bit raw without broiling.) One recipe will go farther than the 12 pieces. I'll definitely make it again.

A great recipe! The garlic rubbed on the bread was a great touch. I would definitely make this again as I made it for three others and it was gobbled down instantly. I would substitute nothing...if anything, I would make more!

I have made this recipe at least a half a dozen times in the last few months, and everyone raves. It is sooooo easy to make (the hardest part is rinsing all the dirt off the arugula) and a breeze to serve. I skipped the oil on the toasts and just drizzled. Also, I made it several times with smoked Gouda and it was fabulous! All those delicious summer tomatoes will be put to good use...

A great appetizer! I agree that this should be broiled for couple of minutes before serving. I also mixed the olive oil directly into the mixture - instead of drizzling on top. My company raved about this - and it was so simple!

I made this bruchetta for a music jam session for about 45 people and it was snarfed! A great appy with a different and wonderful taste. I will certainly make it again and many of those at the party have requested the recipe too.

This is a great tasting dish and is very easy to prepare. I used smoked gouda and regular mozzerela and it tasted very good. It is better with the topping warmed.

What a perfect combination of flavors! The bread toasts very quickly, so watch out. I also broiled them at the end to melt the cheese. Surely the recipe must have intended for them to be prepared that way?

This was delicious and easy. I couldn't find the smoked mozzarella so I used smoked cheddar and smoked monterey jack. Excellent!! I took it to my sister's 40th birthday party and everyone asked for the recipe

Make sure you don't over-toast the bread!!

Loved it. the cheese gives it an excellent flavor, the arugula contrasts the cheese's smoothness nicely, and the tomatoes round it out. a perfect combination. i broiled them at the end to melt the cheese. excellent.

Delicious, fast, and easy! I made this for a dinner party and it received rave reviews. The smoked mozzarella gave it a very nice flavor.
