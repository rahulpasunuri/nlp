I agree with the user who said the ingredients are overall great, but it totally does taste like straight-up mayo unless you add more capers and add lemon juice and some cayenne, which also helps make it look a little prettier, too. I made this tonight to dip onion rings in.

This recipe gets 3 stars only because it provided good inghredients; made as written it was almost like straight mayo. I added at least twice the amount called for: especially capers, mustard, vinegar and Tabasco, tasting as I went. After the juice of 1/2 lemon, it was delicious and well received by guests.

I made the recipe as written and served with a fresh veggie platter for baby shower and it was a hit.

This just tastes like mayonnaise. Double to triple everything except the mayonnaise, and you'll have a pretty good tartar sauce.

Delish. Added a bit of lite sour cream, used 2 tsp red wine vinegar, subbed Sirachi & added a little more, added a tsp of ketchup. Used lite mayo. The whole family loved it.

Great recipe. I use it for dip for grilled artichokes and would be good for any vegetable. Very versatile.

This was a great remoulade. I used the Lite Hellman's and white balsamic as I didn't have any tarragon vinegar. Next time I'll try it with lemon juice and add chopped tarragon. I also omitted the green onions since I had none on hand. If it called for parsley, I omitted that also on general principle, I hate parsley.

Good with crab cakes, great the next day with blanched julienne of celeriac. I did add extra mustard seeds.

Lacking tarragon vinegar I added about 1/2 tsp minced fresh tarragon. This was very good with crab cakes. Tomorrow the leftovers will go into celeriac remoulade.

We served this with the Sauteed Soft- Shell Crab recipe on Epicurious - just delicious! We are looking forward to serving it with crab cakes too!

This is a superb recipe. I have eaten my fair share of Remoulade Sauce in New Orleans, and this is a winner! Add a tbs. of ketsup for color and flavor. Our guests have loved it!

We had a remoulade sauce with a grilled artichoke appetizer at Bandera last night. It was so good I used it on my prime rib as well. Had to find a recipe after that. I'm going to try this. I think it's probably good with EVERYthing!!

Delicious. I quartered the recipe, just eyeballing it - used red wine vinegar, no tarragon, no parsley, and minced onion instead of scallions. It was awesome served with crab cakes.

Excellent recipe for remoulade sauce, I didn't have any tarragon vinegar so I used red wine vinegar and added about a tablespoon of dried tarragon, also chopped up a chipolte chili instead of the tabasco which gave it a nice smoky layer of taste.

This is good as written. But I think it is much improved if you substitute red wine vinegar for the tarragon vinegar and then add a tablespoon or two of fresh tarragon. Also, I leave out the salt. Great with crab cakes.

I used fresh tarragon with balsamic vinegar instead of tarragon vinegar. Add some catsup 1 tablespoon if you like your sauce to be less dry and more colorful.

Very good! I added extra capers, green onions and Tabasco. I did not add any salt, as it didn't need any.

This recipe is awesome. We make it all the time, especially for parties. Usually for shrimp cocktail or crabcakes. It is always a huge hit. It really tastes good with any seafood, cold salmon, leftover fish. And it is easy to make.

Good. Very much like a tartar sauce, but much tastier and more interesting. Served it with crab cakes and everyone liked it.
