My boyfriend is Austrian so he asked me to make--had never heard of it. Didn't realize what I was getting into. Took 3 hrs to complete. I baked this at altitude (6800 ft)and added 1 egg and 1 tbs. flour to compensate--came out very nice, though as many have said, it is not a "pretty" cake. Cooked it at 375 for 40 mins. and it didn't burn and it held together through all the steps. Also, as others have said, the video is much better than the recipe. Followed everything else pretty closely except I used double the amount of the apricot glaze. Added sugar to the Schlag--really made it! Great reviews from my dinner party members.

This recipe is good but is more difficult than I expected. The cake was tricky and did not rise as much as I expected, or as I think it was meant to. The baking time for me was way off -- took it out at about 38 minutes in the oven and it was burnt when I pulled it out; managed to save it by cutting off the burned parts, but I would recommend watching closely starting at 30 minutes. The glaze is terrific -- both the apricot and the chocolate. I would recommend not skimping on the glaze in the middle layer, and also making the full recipe for the chocolate glaze instead of small batch, even though you likely won't use it all, i used almost all of it, and the glaze really was the best part.

This was easy to follow and make but I found the cake starting to burn at the edges at around 25 minutes. I pulled it out and was able to scrape the burned edges. Check your oven and keep and eye on the cake.

This was tasty, but not chocolately enough and sweeter than the real thing. I will give it another go with really dark chocolate. I also found that 35 minutes was enough.

A great recipe. The notes are correct that using quality ingredients is key to authenticity. I used standard semi-sweet + unsweetened baking chocolate in a 50-50 ratio to approximate what I thought would be "bittersweet" chocolate. The cake (still yummy) was sweeter than I remember eating in Vienna. I also liked how a couple of Viennese bakeries serve the side of whipped cream unsweetened. I recommend following the procedures in the helpful video over the written instructions for the chocolate and apricot glazes. The chef visually demonstrates the precise consistencies you are after. (My candy thermometer and my application of the written instructions had things too thick.) After a passable first attempt, I will know just what to do next time. This cake is fantastic and brings back wonderful memories. Thank you for providing a good recipe!!

Made this the other day and it went down a treat! Made a chocolate ganache instead of the glaze recipe, and although it doesn't create the same smooth look as traditional sachertorte I personally found it complemented the cake much more as it really brought out a nice chocolatey flavour. I also followed reviewers' suggestions to bake for 30-35 min and I'm glad I did because any longer in there and it would've turned out very dry! The sides cooked a little faster than the middle but it still tasted lovely all the same. Next time I'll do what some other reviewers suggest, and try baking at a lower temperature.

I used butter substitute and followed the recipe to make the Torte. I ended up needed the whole 45 minutes. At 30 minutes, the center was still liquid. I did not have time to cool the torte and put the glaze on while it was still warm. For the glaze I looked for a jam that did not have high fructose corn syrup in and the only thing available was raspberry jelly. So I did not have to make a glaze but spread it on directly. I did not follow the recipe to the letter but the finished product was moist, not too dense and delicious!!! I made it for Valentine's Day and we loved it.

I made this for my best friend who is an exchange student from Austria. She says it tastes just like the real thing! It was absolutely delicious, although I would recommend making the whipped cream just before serving because it tends to fall. YUM YUM YUM.

I made this recipe few days ago for a Christmas Eve dinner and it worked perfectly. Since I am coming from Europe, and was visiting Vienna many times and having Sachertote in the town I studied at every corner, I was very curious if this will taste authentic. I must admit I struggled a bit with apricot and chocolate glaze since I am not really into cakes and baking, but it was successful at the end. I did not bake torte for 45 minutes, but around 30-35 minutes, trimmed the top off but didn't make it very straight. Since I didn't have rum at all, I used water for apricot glaze, and it took me forever to get it thickened. Also, I was not very happy with my chocolate glaze part while I was cooking it, it took me very long time to get what I thought was the correct consistency. At the end, torte tasted and looked perfect: not very sweet, not very dry, very authentic and everybody loved it. Definitely will make it again.

could underbeating the egg whites remedy the dryness? my egg whites would not peak. i used them anyways--firm but a bit wet. after 30 minutes in the oven it looked and felt just right. the cake lost volume but the texture was denser, less dry and the flavor was more concentrated. it was tall enough to bisect. the layers did not break when cut.

I made this for an "after concert" party, to go with the Viennese theme of the programme, and it was a smash hit. Do not worry when it comes out of the oven looking awful - once trimmed it is fine. Be VERY generous with the Apricot glaze - that saves it from being dry, and insist on everyone having some whipped cream with the cake - there is a reason that it is the way to eat it in Vienna. I did not use the Chocolate glaze, and subbed a simple chocolate ganache (50/50 dark chocolate/buutter) which was fine.

My husband and I love this cake! It is quite dry and not very sweet (very different from the typical American style). Serving it with a generous helping of whipped cream counteracts the dryness, though. If you would like to try authentic Austrian sachertorte, this is the recipe for you. I recommend using very high quality chocolate.

I just made this recipe and I thought it was excellent. I used two 8" pans instead of the one and I added 2 Tablespoons Meyer's Rum to the apricot preserves. Stain the preserves after heating. Instead of the glaze suggested in this recipe which I thought would be too sweet, I used Ann Amernick's, "The Art Of The Dessert," chocolate glaze recipe. It was much less sweet and better balanced the cake. I baked the cake for only 18 minutes to adjust for the lesser quantity of batter in the two pans however, even that was too much time. I can only imagine how awful the full 45 minutes baking time would have been! Next time I will bake it for only 15 minutes. This cake is very susceptible to dryness and my guess is that 15 minutes will insure against that happening. Here is Ann's recipe for "Chocolate Glaze": Combine 1 cup heavy cream, 1/4 cup sugar, and 1 teaspoon corn syrup in small saucepan. Cook on very low heat stirring frequently with a wooden spoon until sugar is dissolved @3 minutes. Remove from heat, add 8 ounces high quality, chocolate. (I used 2 oz. Lindt and 6 oz. Valrhona) and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Let mixture sit for one minute to allow chocolate to melt then stir until smooth. Allow chocolate to sit for another minute before pouring on cake.

I lived for 5 years in the center of Vienna (edited a book on the city) and ate more than my share of Sachertorte. For those who question the process, there's a great video and pictures of the prep at this website (in English): http://www.sacher.com/en-sacher- photos.shtml The cake is neither moist and tender nor very sweet-- if you want the real thing, that's what you get. Most Europeans find our American desserts 'way too sweet for their tastes.

To "Crimson Wings from Switzerland" To prevent your cakes from cooking to quickly on the outside and being underdone in the center all you have to do is wrap your cake pans with something called "Magi-Strips". These are insulated ribbons that you moisten and then wrap abournd the cake pans. This keeps the edges of the cake from cooking and therefore not rising as high as the center of the cake. The effect it two-fold: a cake layer that is flat and not "domed" and edges that will cook at the same rate as the center. If you can't find these strips in Switzerland you can also wrap folded strips of aluminum foil around your cake...not perfect but it will help.

i made this a couple days ago, and it is fabulous. but next time i also will make a ganache of chocolat and cream for the glaze. also 45 minutes is too long to bake, next time i'll watch closely. also one reviewer said that it was too much glaze, but it does say use the small recipe (also too much). the cake is spectacular, and my son said it is as good as the one we had in Salzbourg.

I have made this cake about 2 dozen times and have tried it in Vienna. Rick Rodgers offers an authentic version here. I decided to lessen the sugar to half the recommended amount for the torte, and I changed the glaze as follows: add 1/2 C hot full cream to 200 g dark chocolate bar finely chopped. Cool, then pour over cake. You have a shiny surface, a chocolate taste and much less of a sweetness. I sold this in my coffeehouse, and people commented on it often.

Baked less than time suggested but dry, dry, dry (even with glaze)! Looked pretty, but tasted underwhelming. Would not make again without significant recipe alternations.

I actually made this cake for a student's birthday, and this student happened to be, shall we say, extremely well-placed in Austrian "society". The student's comment was "you nailed it, Ms Powell!". For my own part, I usually don't like chocolate cake, as it tends to be boring. This was one excellent chocolate cake! Having never done a glazed cake before, I learned that all the moving around of the cake (from pan to plate, etc.) should be done IMMEDIATELY after the glaze has been applied, or it will crack.

My boyfriend begged me to make this (his favorite) cake for his birthday. I read the recipie and was very hesitant -I'm not an experienced baker- but I'm glad I finally made it, tastes like authentic Sachertorte! I followed the recipie exactly and I was careful with the baking time, as suggested in the reviews, but the sides cooked way faster than the center, so they came out a bit dry. Next time I'll try to bake at a lower temperature. Other than that, the cake is a hit.

I made this recipe for some friends from Germany. Everyone loved it especially the German couple. She said it was very authentic. I also agree with the bake time so watch the cake the last ten minutes or so! Enjoy!

45min to bake the cake is to long. It got burned. I would suggest 35 minutes. The family like it--their main complaint was that the cake texture was not right--too dry. I was not impressed. While the ingredients were superb tasting (I used the D'Arbo preserves and Valhrona chocolate), I would have liked a much richer, more moist chocolate cake. I also didn't like that of the 10 oz of chocolate that was poured on to the top of the cake, maybe half of it actually stayed ON the cake. I'm not sure how to make more of the chocolate stick. Anyhow, I would love to hear the comments of other bakers...Unfortunatly, I have not had a true Austrian sacher torte so I have nothing to compare to, but I didn't find the torte that impressive.
