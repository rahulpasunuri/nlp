Quick easy addition to "green gruel" for Halloween dinner - awesome presentation and as tasty as your caviar!!!

This was quite yummy and very easy, especially compared to the results. Of course good caviar will make it better. And in Denmark we have good creme fraiche, so that helps as well. Inspired by other caviar and toast recipes on this cite, I added chopped chives to garnish, and used salmon caviar as well as the black. Perfect for new years eve with a glass of bubbly! :)

I made this thinking that it would be a "quick and easy" appetizer for a dinner party. The cutting out of the toasts definitely took a while, though. The key is to splurge a little bit on the caviar; getting the $5 1-oz. jar is definitely not wise; you'll end up throwing it out! My guests much preferred the $22 caviar. I used creme fraiche. Although the toasts looked pretty and festive, I don't think my guests liked this enough to ever make it again. I should have just stuck with the imported cheese.

While this may be a very simple dish it is very much a classic dish. They key, as someone mentioned, is not to use too much sour cream. Black lump fish works just fine and is not that expensive at all!!!! There's also nothing more classic than black and white together. I do believe the picture shows a parsley garnish in the background. I, however, just like to place these with bits of parsley placed around the plate. You don't want to place these ON the parsley as the toast will get a bit soggy. These went FAST!!!! They were wonderful and extremely classic. I am making them again for Christmas Eve. I like the idea of red AND black - I'll do that next. I might also serve these unmade and also have the option of placing a small piece of nova salmon on the bottom. I might try the creme fraiche this time - nice idea!

A Cook From England is marvelously tactful. I do agree this recipe lends itself to variation. Not all of us can afford caviar!

The cook from California might try a glass (or two) of the wonderful California wine.

Why not use creme fraiche instead of sour cream?

i didn't make this dish, but I have a suggestion. I love caviar, and this little Hors d'Oeuvre looks like it would be wonderful with some brie cheese. you be the judge.

These didn't knock our socks off, but we liked them well enough. A quick, easy appetizer with "OK" eye appeal. Not for a "fancy" dinner party, but nice for a quiet evening for two at home or a fun evening with friends.

You want simple and tasteless? This recipe is for you. I think they could have added some more ingrediants to make in have a more inviting and colorful flavor. Plus who ever made this recipe never heard that you eat with your eyes meaning that this is no very appealing looks wise.

We have cooked and entertained quite a bit, but never had the nerve to have caviar. We made this for our engagement party and it was definitely a hit! Our guests loved it, it looked pretty, and was a very simple way to start using caviar

I made this appetizer for a large group of friends before serving a heavy dinner. Everyone "ooh and ahhed" over this every easy first course. It was a perfect beginning to a big dinner party and the presentation was wonderful.

I made this for my New Year's Eve party and it was a big hit. I alternated red lumpfish and black whitefish caviar on my moons which gave the plate a nice variety. Yes, I agree with spreading the sour cream thin. My guests loved this dish.

Sorry but when someone says "boring" it is an opinion, which is what some of you take offense to. Even if it is a basic recipe for beginners it can be labeled as boring which this recipe certainly is. Not even a garnish. Black on white???? If it deserves to be published as a recipe it should contain these things and then you can do what you want to it. Sorry if you're so sensative.

A classic - caviar on toast. I just used a regular old round cookie cutter and it was fine. I also used the (cheap) lumpfish caviar - I figured that if the caviar is getting put on top of sour cream then why was $60 an ounce caviar - it worked fine. Just make sure not to use TOO much sour cream or the flavor of the caviar gets lost.

I served star shaped caviar toasts for my Christmas party this year. They were a hit!!! I served them on a silver plater covered with black beans for contrast, it looked like a million! It might not be news but it sure works.

What I like about this magazine is that they remind us about simple and classic recipes. As an experienced cook, I sometimes get too caught up trying to create "new and different" dishes. These little recipes, like Caviar Moons, are a wake up call that sometimes simpler is better. I like the idea of using a fanciful cookie cutter to add a new look to the basic caviar with toast. In my rush-rush life, this is something that I would not have thought of doing.

How fun to use moon shapes! I love to give my guests the moon and the stars, hee,hee! Used a star cookie cutter, what a festive look. I also agree that less expensive caviar works well...even salmon roe. Great idea, definitely will do this again. Thanks

A Classic! Light sour cream works well as does less expensive cavier. Great for a festive holiday party.

In reference to the rude comments: you have to remember that not everybody has experience in the kitchen and some people are learning the basics. I think this site is great for newcomers and experienced cooks. Merry Christmas

from New England chef with Danish roots: It is called a classic! Food this pure could not and should not be attempted to be improved. This classic never fails and is fun with a new shape.
