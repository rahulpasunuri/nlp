This was delicious with the lemon zest and bread crumbs. I put it over some roasted potatoes, used parsley instead of time, and sprinkled a little sharp cheddar over the top.

Nice! I eat this as an entree, using less salt and substituting part of the butter with olive oil.

Very nice. Although I must admit I cheated: I added potatoes on the bottom and sliced the zucchini. I think that made it a bit more hardy and enough to make this the main dish.

Delicious and super easy. I squeezed some lemon juice to the zucchini for added punch and found that you can sub pretty much any fresh herb for the thyme, if you want. (Basil worked beautifully.) The recipe definitely calls for too much breadcrumbs, but I just saved the extra (minus the herbs) for next time, as I plan to make this again soon!

This was really good. It kind of reminded me of the fried zucchini fingers my mom used to make. I used 3 medium sized zucchinis and found that there was way too much breadcrumbs and so I will be making only half of the breadcrumb mixture next time (didn't have a scale for the zucchinis so not sure how much they weighed) also sliced the zucchini, I like the texture better. served 2 adults and have enough for at least 1 leftover. used dried thyme leaves. my 10 month olds enjoyed as well!

The flavors were very good - the lemon zest in the bread crumbs was refreshing and the thyme was also good. I sliced my zucchini instead of grating it and only used half the bread crumbs (and could have used only half of what I used).

I halved the recipe. I love Penzey's spices,so I used their Fox Point seasoning with the zucchini. I sauted with evoo, and not butter, plus garlic in the bread crumbs. A nice twist on standard zucchini.. Served with a grilled filet mignon with sauteed shitakes, and a simple green salad, finished with a peach blackberry crisp. Perfect!

We really enjoyed a new way to eat zucchini - the crumb topping is delicious.
