I have made this a number of times and never the same way twice, depending upon what I have in the refrigerator. It holds up very well in the refrigeratorthe vegetables stay nice and crisp and the dressing doesn't get watery the way it would with a mayonnaise-based dressing. I always use a red or pink apple just because the color contrast is pretty.

Very good, especially with the addition of chopped hazelnuts/filberts. I also substituted a dash of Stevia for the sugar and reduced the olive oil to 2 T. Tastes fine!

I don't like the taste of anise, so I was a little hesitant to make this. But fennel root is not the same as fennel seeds. I served it with the Spiced Pumpkin, Lentil, & Goat Cheese Salad. It was a huge hit. A mandolin is a must!

Thought this was a fantastic accompaniment to pork ribs. Great crunch, super easy (julienning the apple, is the only effort), and even good omitting the tarragon (just added extra fennel fronds instead). Definitely make a few hours ahead and chill.

Very nice and very easy. This was a refreshing salad with the chicken and potatoes for dinner. I only used one tablespoon of olive oil and a little extra lemon and no tarragon as I didn't have any fresh. This will be a new regular salad!

This is a tasty salad. Everyone loved the crunch and it went well with ham. I did everything as stated, but did not use tarragon because it makes my tongue numb.

yum yum yum. so fresh and crunchy! i didn't add tarragon but only because i don't prefer it. i used a perfect pink lady apple and just thinly sliced everything- i don't own a mandolin. maybe i should. oh, and use a really good EVOO. it makes a subtle but important flavour enhancement. i will absolutely make this again (i nearly ate the whole bowl in one sitting) as it is a great change from the usual summer salad. i served it with medium rare seared salmon and crusty french garlic bread.

Nice one this. Reall health freaks will even enjoy without the dressing, but it is dressing that makes it very good.

Very good. Tasty but a little too anise-like.

I made this last night and it was amazing. I just could not get enough of it. My husband liked it but did not rave about it quite as much as I did. I served it with cold meats and pate, and the slaw was very refreshing. A few notes: I did not add tarragon as I did not have any, and played with the dressing a bit (only because I accidentally added way more lemon juice so had to adjust other ingredients; I tried to stay true to proportions however). I used my mandolin slicer for all ingredients, it worked fabulously.

I made this last night for a small dinner party. I omitted the celery leaves as they tasted bitter to me. I added finely shredded cabbage, julienned some snap peas and jicama. It came out really good, everyone loved it.

Loved this. Refreshing and light. The second time I made it used half walnut oil and half grape seed oil and it was equally delicious. I also julienned the apple with an OXO julienne gadget that looks like a vegetable peeler with great success.

Loved this! It was a huge hit at a large party we had. It's refreshing and delicious. Different without being "weird".

Nice crunch, I used it as the salad course. I left out the celery leaves but use the fennel frond as a garnish. Julienne fennel, celery and apple (good practice!). Increased the apple vinegar a bit and added a pinch of ground anise. Present on radicchio leave. Main course was salmon bulgogi, soup was cream of parsnip, desert was pear upside down with a carmel sauce. Great evening!!

My browser was not allowing me to give this 3 1/2 stars, so I have to write here that this is a recipe worth saving, with some notes. I made this according to the directions with a Gala apple. This is a tricky recipe, because the amount of sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, salt and pepper (white pepper, please), and tarragon vary depending on the flavor and acidity of the fennel/celery/apple that you use. I was trying to stay true to the recipe. I thought the fennel/tarragon flavor was a bit strong. Anyway, it was received rather well at a pot luck dinner, so I will make it again. I think it would certainly benefit from being made several hours in advance.

My guests and I all really enjoyed the salad. Couldn't get fresh tarragon so I used 1 tsp. dried and used the finest slice setting on the food processor to get a nice thin slice of fennel and apple. Let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before serving with grilled chicken and pork. A nice light alternative to regular slaw.

Simply divine! Wonderful flavors and very refreshing. Wouldn't change a thing.

I didn't love this but my guests did! The tarragon + the fennel does make for a verrrry strong licorice flavor. I did make the following improvements:1. 1 small fennel bulb instead of 2 bulbs (if u like fennel use the full amount though)2. a little less fresh tarragon than called for. 3. used a mandoline to thinly slice the celery, granny smith apple, and the fennel. 4.added craisins. 5.used white pepper instead of black pepper to prevent adding black to the pretty green salad. 6. made the slaw in advance and let it sit in the fridge over night. This really helped all the flavors meld together!

Outstanding flavor. Need to try again with fennel sliced more thinly. A bit overpowering in large chunks.

Winner, winner, winner! I absolutely loved the flavors in this salad! I made it as written except for the celery leaves since my celery stalk didn't have any (didn't miss the leaves). Be sure to use a mandoline to slice the fennel paper thin. This recipe is defintely going into my 'keeper' file!

Excellent, had many complements. Added crasins, plus blue berries and some arugula cause I was serving a larger group. Really tasty will do again...

My guests loved this! I couldn't find celery with enough loose leaves, but we didn't miss it. I used a Gala apple, which worked well.

Excellent as is. Will definitely do it again.

As with some of the other reviewers, I enjoyed this new combo of flavors. I found it a refreshing change from other familiar favorites. I too added dried cranberries. I also put about 3/4 of the mixture into the food processor then folded in the remaining so it was "slaw-like" and rather I think, very interesting .

this was just ok for me. The crunch was great but there was something missing. Maine - love the idea of craisins (wish I saw your comment before I made it!). The dressing was a bit too acidic as well - maybe not so much vinegar next time. Maybe a spoonful of creme fraiche or yogurt to help it cling, instead of pooling at the bottom of the bowl. Not really sure there will be a next time though (wish "maybe" was a choice).

This was great - I made it exactly and loved the flavors - next time I will add some dried cranberries for some additional sweetness and color.

Crisp, light, delicious. Made large batch for big party. Was huge hit. Had several people ask me for recipe. Was great alternative to the boring, heavy mayonnaise coleslaw you usually find at cookouts.
