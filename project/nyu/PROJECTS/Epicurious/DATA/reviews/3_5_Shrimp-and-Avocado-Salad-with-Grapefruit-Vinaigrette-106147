This is a satisfying salad for the post holiday diet. To make it more low cal, I eliminated the shrimp and increased the spinach. I also added some sesame oil and more ginger to the dressing. It was great! The whole combination worked well. The sprouts added a nice texture, the avocado added creaminess and the nuts added crunch. We used ripe Texas Ruby Red grapefruit which are in season right now which added sweetness to both the dressing and the salad. Both the grapefruit and the sprout help to lower cholesterol. This will be a staple as my husband has borderline high cholesterol.

This is the perfect salad for summer dinner. I serve it with a Riesling and crusty bread. I make the vinaigrette and prepare the grapefruit ahead of time and chill. I also add more spinach to the recipe and leave out the sprouts. Note: The grapefruit is easier to peel and remove the membranes than you might expect.

Great light summer dinner or starter salad for entertaining. Recommend doing the following: -add a little cayenne and sesame oil to the dressing -add a little cayenne to the shrimp -use tiny shrimp to better distribute the flavor -add honey to the dressing -take the leftover butter from cooking the hazlenuts and use that to cook the shrimp in. adds a great hazlenut flavor to the shrimp

I make this every year on New Year's eve along with crab cakes. Very fresh and light. Delicious. Someone always asks for recipe. I do omit nuts due to allergies.

Amazing!! Made this last night as a first course and it was a huge hit! The flavors are light and refreshing and pair beautifully.

I didn't like this dish. Ingredients sounded lovely, but end result was bland. Even with added honey (as suggested) the dressing was very bland and the ginger taste was not very pleasant. Lovely presentation, though.

I was intrigued by this recipe--it seems really good. However, I was a bit confused when I read the proportions in the dressing. 1/4 C. plus 2 t. acid to 1 T. oil? Isn't it ususally about 2:1 oil:acid? Does anyone else find this strange?

My husband and I loved it1 We've made it again and again. We love grapefruit, and it's possible other reviewers have not been able to get the wonderful, sweet grapefruit we can. I know a of grapefruit can be bitter, but we buy very juicy sweet ones locally. We found the dressing nice and refreshing. To make it simpler we just slice the grapefruit across the membrane and cut the peel off - very fast.

Yes, there is something terribly wrong with a grapefruit dressing. Needs sugar and rice wine vinegar or something. Way too bitter.

There is something terribly wrong with the dressing. I had to work long and hard to make it palatable, and even then, it was just an OK salad. Won't make this one again.

I also served this for a bridal shower. I substituted asparagus for the spinach (taking the idea from a Crab/Asparagus/Orange salad on this same website) since I was serving another spinach salad, and used twice as much shrimp - both ideas worked very well. The combination of flavors was delicious, and everyone enjoyed it.

Excellent warm weather salad--I made this for a bridal shower lunchoen and it was very appropriate and delicious. The dressing was just a tad bitter, so I added about 2 tbs. of honey as suggested in other reviews, I also added a little honey to the nuts before I toasted them. I used enough shrimp to put 8 on each salad (double what the recipie called for). Lovely Presentation.

This is a very nice and elegant recipe with wonderful complementary flavors; however, I made it for a Sunday lunch with 12 people, so therefore tripled it which created quite a bit more work, particularly when preparing the grapefruit. Also, there was just too much juice. If increasing the portions, I would recommend that when you put the dressing on, toss and and taste as you go. Also, I disagree with getting rid of the nuts--they add a lovely, crunchy texture, nicely balanced with the softness of the avocado.

This salad is delicious in summer time. Instead of nuts I added roasted sesame seeds and it complemented the dish very well. I would also recommend to add a touch of honey or maple syrup to the dressing to take out some of the bitterness and acidic taste to it. I will definitively make this recipe again.

DID NOT BOTHER WITH THE NUTS. FLAVORS DID NOT MISS IT! ADDED THINLY SLICED PIECES OF COLD LONDON BROIL AND PUT AROUND THE BOARDER OF THE PLATE SALAD WAS SERVED ON. ADDED A NICE FLAVOR FOR THOSE WHO MUST HAVE MEAT WITH THIER MEALS!

I have made this salad several times. It is always a big hit. The dressing is light and does not over power the flavors in the salad.

Very tasty and easy to prepare. I found that the hazelnuts were battling for taste with the shrimps and the avocado, next time I will omit them.

This salad was a big hit at Easter! It is delicious and easy to make. Great recipe!

agree with previous reviewers. The vinaaigrette needs vinegar and the hazlenuts are more bother than they're worth. I used toasted pine nuts.

Sigh. All of the ingredients appealed to me. The result, however, was underwhelming.

The vinaigrette needs some love.
