This came out more like a salsa than a dip and even at that, there are much better salsa recipes. I made this as a dip for jumbo shrimp and, as a backup, made regular cocktail sauce (ketchup, horseradish, lemon zest). Boy, was I glad I did. No one liked the Spicy Island Dip with the shrimp. It completely overwhelmed the taste of the shrimp and somehow just tasted wrong for shellfish.
