Great cornbread, with lovely maple flavor, and super quick-and-easy to make. A little on the sweet side, but in a yummy way. My husband, who is not only one of those strange creatures born without a sweet tooth, but also says he does not like cornbread, thinks this is delicious. Made it for stuffing last year, now a household basic. Quantity is immense, better suited to a 9x13 pan. For general eating (vs. stuffing), I cut down by about a third. Flavor and ease give it 4 forks.

I was glad that I tried this before making it for company. The bread was just okay. Not bad, but not amazing. I like the recipe on the side of the cornmeal box better! The flavor was nice, but the consistency was weird, dry and sort of mealy.

This is the best cornbread recipe I've made, although a little on the rich side if you're being careful what you eat. (That's what you get when you bake with lots of eggs and butter!) I substituted a combo of milk and yogurt for the buttermilk. I was very pleased with how well the maple flavor comes through well. Wonderful fresh from the oven, also tasty the next day, toasted, with (more) butter and honey, for breakfast. Yum! This makes a thick slab in a 9x9 pan, I might use a 9x13 pan next time. The only reason I didn't give this 4 forks is that I did make it to use in stuffing, and the end result was a stuffing that was far too sweet, and the maple flavor didn't survive being paired with onions and spicy sausage. So, a big thumbs up for "eating" cornbread; but for stuffing, I'll go back to a basic, less rich, less sweet cornbread next time.

Extremely disappointing - syrup gave it an odd color, which I can dismiss, but definitely something missing -- more salt, and something else. Boyfriend crumbled a bit in the corn and cheddar chowder (elsewhere on this site), but nothing really can save it.

It has been a hit with my family every time I've made it.

Made two cornbreads for Thanksgiving this past year - this one was a smash hit! So good I made another batch the next morning to go with leftovers. Had a little trouble getting the center done before the edges burnt - until I realized that it is better with the middle almost done and moist. Maple flavor is wonderful.

Am I the only one who thinks this recipe is delicious? Did I do something wrong? I used it for the New England Sausage Stuffing (which was wonderful) and have since served it on it's own. Mine was moist and just a little sweet as we like it that way. It has enough texture so it doesn't fall apart. I'll certainly keep on making this one.

Hard as a rock!!! Very disappointing recipe. Use as a base for stuffing instead.

Heavy as lead with a mealy texture - the clue should have been that it was the base for a stuffing receipe, there are so many better stand alone corn breads!

Easy to make. Very nice color and appealing to look at! Mildly sweet.
