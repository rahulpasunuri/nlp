The only thing you are missing is a little bit of harissa in it and some lemon to squeeze! Very traditional recipe here.

TOTOALLY worth the trouble. Even after a fail, once you get the shape of the briq going its the best looking and tasting Tunisian dish from my/your kids childhood. Use bread to soak up soft egg yolks off a plate with olive oil and harissa. Recipe note: Although Tunisians use olive oil in 99% of their dishes, the briq should be fried in peanut oil because olive oil can't handle the high frying temperature.

This is a slightly more elaborate version of a very common Tunisian hors d'oeuvre. The "street version" usually doesn't have the onions and the parsley but is every bit as tasty. Authentic Tunisian briks are made with a thin pastry sheet using semolina flour; however,the spring or egg roll wraps do nicely as a substitute. One thing I would recommend is that they be eaten as soon as possible after they come out of the oil as they tend to lose their potato-chip crispness quite rapidly, even in a warm oven. Also no Tunisian would ever eat his or her brik without sprinkling it with a liberal amount of lemon juice and topping it with a dollop of harissa, the Tunisian national hot sauce. And as an aside, to the reviwer from Chicago, somehow equating a "tuna salad" to a properly made Tunisian brik is like comparing a can of Campbell's tomato soup with a bowl of Mediterranean bouille baisse. To each his own.

This was a fantastic way to use canned tuna, and something very different than the ordinary. Easy to assemble and quick to cook. I used egg roll wrappers and it still turned out well, and I definitely recommend using medium eggs.

My husband is a huge fan of eggs, tuna and anything fried - this combined all of those things in a suprisingly delicious and satisfying way! It will definitely become a staple. Very moist and the capers add a lot to the taste. I strongly suggest that you get medium eggs, not large as they will overflow and make the process messier than it needs to be!

I made this with my dinner club when we did an "egg" theme - it was very different from the more traditional egg dishes out there. And when I was cracking the eggs into the center, I had an audience - everyone thought it was so clever. I was pleasantly surprised at how fluffy the eggs were and quite tasty in the center of the crunchy, fried wrappers. All in all, a fun tasty appetizer!
