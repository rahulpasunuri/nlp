I have been making this recipe variation for 15 years and it is always a hit. The original recipe came from the Silver Palate Cookbook using a spicy tomato sauce, which adds the punch to this meal.

Yet another "Italian" recipe with no herbs for flavor (I don't count parsley because it has almost no flavor). Add some oregano, rosemary and basil to this for a real treat.

I prepared this mostly as directed and it was quite good. I reduced the olive oil to 2tbs and used lean sweet italian chicken sausage (6g fat per link). I also used fresh spinach and egg pasta. As prepared, I felt that the sauce was too runny. I will fix this again, but will reduce the sauce further and possibly add mushrooms. Overall very easy and quite good. I will prepare it again.

I doubted the calorie count as well, but I made it with 3 mild italian trukey sausage links and 2 pork hot italian links (I could not find the turkey variety "hot"). We enjoyed it. I also made it with wheat linguine, but would maybe try spinach next time. Easy and quick, and hearty enough for the cool weather ahead!

This is a great recipe, it is very simple to make and ok if you dont have to watch Caloriesi gave it a three fork for the massive calorie and carb count,along with Cholesterol,and Sodium. I tried a taste of this recipe as written and it was excellent, not having a chem lab in my kitchen to analyze the ingredients,i made it with lean ground Italian seasoned turkey,and wheat Linguine it had a little different flavor from the wheat pasta but if you are use to eating wheat products it is a great dish with way less calories and carbs and cholesterol. salt is minimal but can be increased to tolerance or taste.

This was fabulous. I made it with the garlic bread and zucchini salad that were in Parade magazine with this recipe. The bread and salad were fabulous as well and went together nicely. I was able to use all vegetables from my garden, so it was also economical.

You can call it what ever you want. It's just the ordinary Rhode Island Italian sausage, peppers & onions over pasta. Leave out the pasta and it makes a good sandwich on a crusty torpedo roll. You may want to throw in some sliced mushroms.
