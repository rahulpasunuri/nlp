otherwise good, but far too salty! Should not use salt in the filling and half as much in the rice.

I used arborio (risotto) rice instead of long grain, and used my judgement when adding seasonings. When serving, I added a drizzle of aioli (blended with some cream to make it a little runnier) and a dollop of marinara sauce on top, and served them with a great salad. The final result was just gorgeous. It would be really easy to put different fillings in, to mix it up a little. Will DEFINITELY make again!

The arancini had a very tasty meat center, but the rice was very, very salty. I would cut that in half next time and try using risotto instead of rice for a better flavor.
