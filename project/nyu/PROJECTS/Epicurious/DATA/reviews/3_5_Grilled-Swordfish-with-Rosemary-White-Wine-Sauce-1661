This recipe made multiple non swordfish eaters into believers! I made this for New Years Eve and didn't tell my guests until dinner time. My husband and sister were not thrilled and said... no thanks. However one bite and they were "hooked". Yummy.

I made this with red onion instead of shallots, and added 1 tsp of Thai fish sauce to add the saltiness others said were missing, and 1tsp garlic as recommended. It came out really well!

Very simple and easy to prepare. Delicious. The sauce enhances the swordfish. Will definitely make this dish again.

Turned out wonderfully. Took the advice of different reviewers and reduced the shallots, increased the rosemary, added garlic and used some green onions. Used more wine too (I always use more wine than recipes call for). Delicious!

I pan fried the fish for about 5 minutes on each side. The sauce is heavenly!! Note: I would have a white wine with this meal, not the red recommended by the website.

A little less butter and more rosemary would make this dish 4 forks.

I thought the sauce with this dish was a little overwhelming. I would recommend using a lot less shallots (and I love them usually.)

I read all the other comments before making this recipe. I added a garlic clove to the sauce but otherwise made it as directed. I found it pretty bland. At the end, I added about half a teaspoon of capers. The capers added a salty dimension to the sauce that made it excellent. I would make this recipe again.

This was really delish!! The sauce compliments the fish well. It was easy and quick to make. I did follow another reviewers suggestion of adding garlic. I added 1 clove chopped to the shallots in the sauce. Nothing else needed tweeking as the sauce is amazing. Another key, I believe, is not to over grill the fish. We had a fairly hot grill and 3 minutes per side was perfect for a 1 1/2" thick swordfish steak. I would highly recommend this dish.

My husband and I enjoyed this sauce very much. We served it on Ahi. Too much butter ???? NOT ! Garlic.......bring it on ! Very easy and delicious with corn on the cob !

Delicious! I used regular onions and added garlic to the wine mixture, then strained before adding butter. It was plate-licking good!

this dish is amazing. and quick. and easy. the sauce boosted it from regularly good grilled fish to 4-forks superb. perfect for spring, or summer as i'll find out. served with grilled cauliflower and salad. definitely a keeper.

Absolutely delicious! I used frozen swordfish (completely thawed) and cooked 4 min on each side in a copper bottomed skillet. I used green onions instead of shallots with great success. The sauce was delicious. My husband agrees this is a keeper.

This was excellent. The taste was outstanding. I got rave reviews!!! If you like swordfish then this is the recipie to try!

This is excellent and easy, made with fresh swordfish either on the grill or using a grill pan. One small change made: Before adding the butter and rosemary, I strained the sauce to remove the cooked shallot pieces. Then I returned the sauce to the pan and continued by whisking in the butter and finally adding the rosemary. It made for a more elegant presentation when plating the swordfish.

We thought this was delicious. I think the fresher the fish, the better the result. We grilled with gas 8 min at 450, turning over halfway through. I only had half as much shallot as recommended but it still was a delicious sauce. Used sauce for corn on the cob; it was super!

I accidently added too much lemon juice and under grilled the swordfish. I'll attempt it again but probably not for a while.

My guests loved this recipe. I substitued thick tuna steaks which went really well with the sauce.

Everyone really liked this dish. I will definitely make it again. Our guests even asked for the recipe, which I gladly gave them a copy of.

I've made this dish twice, cutting the butter down to one tablespoon. It still received rave reviews. The second time I used red onion in place of the shallot and it actually made an excellent presentation. Served it with sauteed garlic spinach. It was delicious!

While in Barbados, we had this recipe with pink king fish (local fish). Absolutely wonderful. The sauce was outstanding. We will definetly be making this again.

I wondered about this recipe after the so-so comments, but the sauce is fantastic. It was a big hit with my husband, and I would make this for company any time. I modified the sauce proportions (more wine so it could cook down more).

We found the recipe very good and will be making this again.

This meal was not very well like by guests I would not make this dish again. There is too many conflicting tastes.

This was a nice reicpe to try, but won't be a keeper for us. The butter was not overpowering in our opinion and the rosemary makes the sauce rather attractive. The directions on cooking the fish were 'right on'.

Great recipe! Thought the butter would be overbearing but was perfect!

This was a fabulous recipe. I don't know whether the other reviewers were able to make the recipe as stated because I would not change a thing. Maybe what they didn't lack in skill, they did in taste.

We used Orange Roughy Filets and grilled them, also cut down on the butter, added chives, and garlic. Actually got an 11 year old to rave over this, even though it was not deep fried! He actually asks for it now.....

The fish was very moist and flavorful, even though we don't have a grill and had to cook it in a cast-iron skillet. This is one of the best recipes for swordfish we've had!

Absolutely delicious! The combination of lemon, good white wine, fresh rosemary, unsalted butter and scallions in the sauce was awesome. We served it with rice pilaf, and roasted asparagus. For starters we had a Goat Cheese Souffle with Greens salad. Bob Appetite! My friend said my kitchen smelled like a 'fine restaurant'

This is tasy, but the butter is bit much. I cut it in half and the sauce was fine. Perhaps more wine too. Not much sauce to go around the way the recipe reads.

Rating: 2
The swordfish itself turn out fantastic on the grill, but I will never make that sauce again. It was WAY too strong, the combination of ingredients sounded good, but it ended up tasting too strongly lemon and rosemary, they didn't blend very well.

My first attempt at grilled, or any type, of swordfish, and it was a HUGE hit! Delicious. I will definately make this again. It was easy and quick as well.

Rating: 3
Very good dish. I doubled the sauce because I was serving 6 people. Next time I would cut back on the shallots and the lemon. I served it with stringbeans which had been steamed 3 minutes and then placed in ice water before sauteed in olive oil and whole grain Dijon mustard seeds. Wonderful dish (except for the exploding seeds!)

I made this the other night and got rave reviews. It is easy to prepare, very quick and could definitely be served for a dinner party. A keeper!

This dish was a great addition to my vast receipe collection. I have to say it's the tastiest meal so far this summer and I plan on preparing it many more times. My vegtable was grilled asparagus with a squeeze of lemon right before serving and a almond rice pilaf. I would also recommend Biltmore estate sauvingon blanc. ( If you can find it where you are)DON'T SCROLL PAST THIS EXCEPTIONAL DISH.

This recipe is excellent. We have made it twice now, once for ourselves and once for a dinner party, and our guests just loved it. I would suggest placing the lemon on the side rather than incorporating it into the recipe though. Some thought the lemon was a bit overpowering.

I made this for the 1st time last night for a dinner party. Everyone raved about the sauce and are asking for the recipe. I decided to use a smaller amount of the shallots & rsoemary - and it came out just perfect.

Rating: 2
I'd make it again, but maybe without the shallots. They're a substantial enough ingredient that without them it'll be a different recipe, but it'll be better. They add an onion-y flavor that would be better left out. Otherwise, the wine, lemon, and butter are great -- maybe with parsley instead of rosemary. It needed too many substitutions when I made it.

The dish was very delicious. I suggest rice and asparagus as a side dish. I will cook the recipe again.

This is a really quick and easy recipe. The best thing about it, though, is that it's absolutely delicious.
