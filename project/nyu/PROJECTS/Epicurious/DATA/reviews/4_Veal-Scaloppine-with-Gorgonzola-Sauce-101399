very good. added about 1 tbsp of fresh lemon juice at end to cut thru the cream. also had to go with regular blue cheese rather than gorgonzola cause thats what was on hand

This was absolutely scrumptious and easy to make. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce is delicious! It's going in my recipe box!

Rating: 4
I can only echo the other positive reviews. I used slightly less cream and cheese and slightly more tomatoes (since it was 30C out) and it still tasted fantastic. It was rich but also fresh and not at all overwhelmed by the Gorgonzola. I also agree with another reviewer that the veal only needed 1.5 minutes per side.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutely delicious! I put it over capellini. I will make this next time with shrimp and penne. Definitely try it!

Made this for my family of picky diners. I pretty easily did a low carb version (breaded with low carb bread crumbs), a no sauce version and a regular version. Everyone loved it. Other modifications: Used turkey tenderloins pounded flat, skipped the broth altogether, added some freeze dried red onion to the pan of olive oil. Served with pasta and lots of good bread to soak up all of the sauce!

Made this for last nights New Years Eve dinner. HUGE HIT. I doubled the sauce - sauteed prosciutto, the tomatos and some roasted garlic in the veal pan drippings. Then added the stock, etc. Didn't add the tomato paste either.

this was delicious!!! We had this dish tonight and my husband an I just loved it.....I followed the directions and didn't change a thing.... will make this for company. Maybe with chicken because veal is expensive...but delicious!!!

Wowed my husband with this one!!! Served with angel hair pasta which was great with the sauce. Delicious as is - and easy to prepare. We drank a Shiraz with it which went very nicely with the strong gorgonzola.

After having this dish at the restaurant in Scottsdale, I was pleasantly surprised to find the recipe here. I've made the recipe several times and it's wonderful. My husband and guests always love when I make it.

This recipe is fabulous! We have served it time and time again with raving reviews! We serve it over penne pasta and use chicken instead. Fantastic for impressing guests.

You know how you try a new recipe and it isn't quite right, but it is still quite tasty? I'll continue to make this and while doing that, try to tweak it for my family. That said, the overall flavour was rich and the quality of the cheese matters, I think.

Rating: 4
excellent... made chicken scaloppine instead of veal, and combined this recipe with a potato gnocchi and gorgonzola side that was out of this world... the gorgonzola was surprisingly understated - it was truly a rich blend of flavors that i can't wait to replicate for friends...

Rating: 2
I am the odd woman out. This recipe is much more work than it's worth, not to mention expensive! I followed it precisely, but couldn't get the sauce to thicken! Finally added cornstarch, then a flour paste. It's also way more sauce than needed for the veal. Served it with tortelinni, which saved the meal. Next time, it's back to Wienerschnitzle!

I made this dish with "cheap" gorgonzola and it was good. I can only image how good it would be with a higher quality cheese.

I didn't have gorgonzola but had cambazola cheese. It was an unbelivable recipe!My husband who has been in the resturant business said it was the best veal dish that he has ever tasted!

Phenomenally scrumptious just as it is written! I've made this several times now and will keep on making it, it is just wonderful!

This dish turned out fabulous with a few adjustments. I used chicken and then I roasted a head of garlic and two red peppers. I processed the peppers and half the head of garlic and used that in place of the tomatoes. What a nice sweet sauce.

Delicious... Served with some linguine that I drowned in the ample supply of sauce the recipe yielded... making it Veal Scalloppine w. Linguine, sorta just rolls off the tongue.

My boyfriend licked his plate, the sauce was so good! I used chicken instead of veal, but honestly I think this gorgonzola sauce would taste great with anything.

Absolutely fantastic!

Excellent recipe and I made with fat free half & half! I was worried about the gorgonzola being overpowering, but that was not the case. Served with whole wheat pasta. A keeper! (I think I rate tougher than most people, I've only given two "4 fork" ratings in my life.)

It's hard to find a recipe that is suitable for company yet relatively easy to make. This dish meets both criteria. It tastes phenominal and makes a lovely presentation.

Rating: 4
This is delicious! For such an easy sauce to make, it tasted wonderful. Make sure to scrape up the veal bits when making the sauce. I served it over angel hair as others suggested. The second time I modified the receipe because I had some chicken I needed to make. I made the sauce again, but this time grilled chicken, put some prosutto on it and some fresh mozarella. I broiled this, sliced it, and served it over fettucini with the sauce. I didn't add the extra gorgonzola on top, I thought it might be too much. My husband loved it!

Rating: 4
This was so easy and yet so Gourmet! Absoulutely loved it. Served with Gemilli pasta. The chicken option sounds great too. Will try that next time. Thought there would not be enough Gorgonzola in it but it was just right. Any more would kill the taste of the other ingredients.

Rating: 3
This is a keeper guys. I served it with the Fontina & Parsley mashed potatoes. Awesome sauce. I deglazed the pan with some white wine. The only problem I ran into was during the cooking of the veal. Had to use *quite* the hot pan to give the veal any color, which caused alot of oil splattering which was not too fun to feel, or to clean up. Also, the gorgonzola did not seem to want to melt in my sauce. Still, I really liked this one and got great reviews on it.

Rating: 4
This was a great recipe. I thought it was easy to make and it was delicious. It is definitely a keeper. I didn't have enough cream so I used 1/4 cream and 3/4 cup regular soy milk. It is healthier that way and is still wonderfully delicous.

I have been making this recipe for dinner guests since I found the recipe here over a year ago. It is a delicious combination, especially when served over pasta. It is easy to prepare and always makes a beautiful presentation. Excellent dish!

Great sauce. Family loved it. However, suace was a little over-powering for veal. I'll try chicken as other reviewers have suggested, or maybe filets w/ a touch more gorgonzola? Thanks for all the reviewer tips!

GREAT! Husband asks for it all the time. I have made it w/chicken and veal (prefer the veal) serve over angel hair pasta. Tastes like four star resturant. Thanks!

An absolute winner gourmet dish and easy too! Made it with veal last week but will try it with chicken this week (that's how much it was loved!) Mashed potatoes are truly decadent with this recipe. Add extra tomatoes and diced sauteed chicken over fresh gnocchi for a hearty pasta dish.

I made this with chicken and froze two smaller servings -- one I gave to a friend. He had it with mashed potatoes and he can't stop talking about it. Heavenly!

I made this for a dinner party (with chicken), and took the suggestion below about the angel hair pasta (Thank you!). I actually tossed cooked angel hair pasta with a sun-dried tomato pesto. Plated the dish with the angel hair pasta and the sauteed and nicely pounded, dredged and browned perfectly, chicken cutlet on top with the sauce (decadent sauce btw.) Garnished with a scattering of grape tomatoes sliced in half and tossed with more of the sun-dried tomato pesto. On top of the chicken I placed a fresh large basil leaf with a small slice of gorgonzola and another grape tomato slice. Was an incredible presentation and huge hit at my party. Thank you for the idea. Great recipe!

Awesome! Made this dish for my husband my parents. They loved it. Took the advice of previous reviewers and served it on angel hair pasta. It was a great suggestion. My husband rated this dish a 10 and said it was one of the best meals he's ever eaten. He said he felt like he was in a 5-star restaurant.

My mother who doesn't like veal even liked this. The sauce was delicious and could easily be served with any meat or on pasta. I used half and half instead of going full fat with the cream, and it didn't suffer at all. Try it, you'll like it!

Make with pasta and feed 6. Used concentrated tomato paste from a tube... reduced the sauce for 12 minutes to the point I was satisfied. Got lucky and found a bottle of La Poja Monovitigno Corvina, 1992. What a match!!

Simply delightful and easy to make. The sauce needed to simmer a little longer than 5 minutes to reach the correct consistency, but was truly satifying!

Fantastic dish with excellent sauce. Restaurant quality taste and satisfaction. Made veal and chicken both were amazing.

Rating: 1
Well - this was a bit disappointing, especially for a gorgonzola lover like myself. The sauce took a long time to reduce, hence sacrificing the cooking requirements for the pasta and accompanying vegetables. The most negative aspect was how salty the sauce tasted - perhaps a blue cheese/stilton may work better. Not sure I'll bother with this rich, salty mess again.

I loved this recipe! I also used this recipe to develop another. I substituted the veal with a pesto parmesan ham (you can purchase at a specialty store) thickly sliced (1/4") and then cubed. I serve recipe tossed with farfalle pasta. Both recipes are great for company.

My family loved this dish. It is very rich. I tried serving it over angel hair pasta and it was okay. The pasta is too thin for such a thick sauce. Next time I will use linguine or fettucine. Wonderful flavor! M-M-M....

We have made this dish many times for company and always with rave reviews. One benefit for company is that the sauce may be reheated without breaking, so you can make it in advance.

I loved this, and so did everybody else wow!!!! My husband thought it was the best sauce he has ever tasted. I can hardley wait to mahe it again. The only thing I changed was I added some red wine after I removed the veal. I am hungary just thinking about this dish.

One of the best recipes for veal I've had, and very simple to make.

Excellent recipe. I substituted veal chops. I find working with scaloppine with a large crowd doesn't work as well as chops. I first served bruschetta with arugula, smoked mozzarella, and tomatoes (also in recipe file). The bruschetta was enjoyed while guests took turns at stirring the risotto with spinach and fresh basil. This was followed with zuccotto, a stuffed, rum-soaked pound cake. Excellent meal!
