My family and friends love this cheesecake. Take to work potlucks, and have shared the cheesecake and recipe with many friends and associates since 1997! It is easy to make and so worth the effort and water bath method. The taste is wonderful, not too sweet and pumpkin taste is great. Never lasts the day after THXG. Even our kids request this every Thanksgiving!!!! Thanks

This tasted bad. Had no flavor bland, waste of ingredients.

The folks at work ate it right up. I like that it has a pumpkin pie flavor--but richer. I added the extra spices as recommended by the 12/05/08 reviewer. And also cooked it not in the pan of water but with the pan in the shelf below. I have had leakage problems with water baths. The shelf below works great-- no cracks. Even with that, I do find the crust to be a bit wet. Maybe less butter next time. This recipe make a LOT of batter. I siphoned some off and made little ramekins (good for freezing). Those, I cooked for just 45 minutes.

I am so disappointed! I have made the bourbon pumpkin cheesecake as well as the other spiced pumkin cheesecake in the past. I recieved rave reviews on both from friends, family, and colleagues. This year I decided to try somehting new. Bland and unspectacular. A total waste of money and time, if I had more pumpkin I would throw this in the garbage and make one of the other two. I actually might be too embarassed to serve this as I am known for my desserts. Please don't waste your time - try one of the others!

Love this recipe. I added 1/3 cup more sugar because amount of sugar recommended did not seem to be enough with all the cream cheese and pumpkin called for. I've made this cheesecake 3 times within the past couple of months. It will be a holiday staple from now on.

I first made this cheesecake just as the recipe specified and the texture was really good, just missing a bit of flavor. The next time I used walnuts and Ginger Kat cookies from Trader Joe's for the crust and added a bit more spices as a previous reviewer suggested and o my was it good! Absolutely try the recipe as is but it's even better with adding more spice!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! Instead of adding cinnamon and ginger, I added two teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice. The flavor was great, and not too much like pumpkin pie.

This is the most wonderful cheesecake I have ever tasted. It rivals The Cheesecake Factory pumpkin cheesecake. I love it, and would probably not be able to fit through the door if I ate it as often as I'd like to. I stick to making it just once or twice a year, and dream about the event for months in advance!!

The best cheese cake ever. Smelled so good it was hard waiting to eat it. Used trader joe's ginger cats for crust. Cut pumpkin in half and roasted like squash. Scooped it out and processed it with spices. Spiced with lemon zest, minced ginger, and nutmeg. Easy on the sugar.

I made this for a dinner party and had a quite Bridget Jones-espe moment...when I took it out of the springform the outer edge of the cheesecake was green! I think it might have been a reaction to the aluminum foil, which I did not take off until I served it. Next time I'll remove it after it comes out of the oven. Thank goodness the lights were low - I scraped off the green and no one noticed. They all loved it and complimented profusely!

i have made this cheesecake 2 times, both it has come out with an excellent flavor. both times i have made it the cream cheese has not fully combined w/ the pumpkin no matter how much i mixed al that this did was make it so that there were small bits of white (cream cheese0 in the cake after it was cooked, still the flavor was awsome and the creamy texture was great. i would deffinatly make this time and time again.

I make this cheesecake for Thanksgiving and even sell them to my co-workers! I finish the cheesecake by adding a dark chocolate gnoche over, decorated with pecan halves. The genoche adds a complexity to the flavors that the cake alone can not pull off.

Made this for a family of non-pumpkin palates who insist on traditional pumpkin for T-day. Was amazed to see them flying off the plate (I made mini cheesecakes for ease of serving and speed of cooking - 20 min is perfect...) beating out the apple pie and nearly keeping pace with the chocolate pecan. Even a fussy 3 year old ate one. Used gingercat cookies from Trader Joes in the crust and garnished with whole pecans. Most surprising... My brother in law modified his Christmas list with a special request... forget the gift... make more cheesecake! A definite keeper!

Ooh la la -- this cheesecake is delish! It baked without cracking, and the texture was creamy and smooth. After reading the other spiced pumpkin cheesecake recipe and various reviews, I played with the spices and came out with a very good balance: 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. ground ginger, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 2 tsp. vanilla and 1/4 tsp. ground cloves. Finally, the pecan and graham cracker crust really pushed this cheesecake over the top! Yummm.

Wonderful, easy, pretty. I added more spices to the batter and it was so tasty. A great ending to a Thanksgiving Dinner.

Also in response to the question about the water bath: I've never used one either, and I didn't with this. I also only put the crust on the bottom of the pan (not sides)... I like to be able to remove the outside of the pan to make serving easier. One other note: this could be my particular oven, but the top was starting to crack after only an hour, so I turned down the heat for the last 45 minutes. Turned out great, everyone wants the recipe!

In response to the question regarding wrapping the cheesecake and submerging in water....I've been making this cheesecake for years, and found that wrapping it caused the crust to be soggy. Instead, I put the cheescake on the middle shelf in the oven and a roasting pan of water on the bottom shelf. It comes out great!

a question, not a rating on this one: is it imperative that i do the double wrapping and cook it in the roasting pan of water? this seems like a hassle to me, and my other cheesecakes are always fine just being baked the "regular" way. let me know, please. thanks. evasivemaneuvers@gmail.com

I love this cheesecake. It was the first one I ever made and I didn't read ahead and realize that cheesecakes take longer to bake - I was bringing it to a family gathering and had to take it out half-way through baking and drive 30 miles. The result was a very ugly dessert - but I was quickly vindicated when several people asked for 3rds!!! I agree with using Ginger Snaps in the crust instead of just graham crackers.

Rating: 4
This was a wonderful, creamy, professional looking cheesecake that I will make anytime I want to impress people! There were no cracks, the cake was high, perfectly textured and tasted like a dream! I had to make 3/4 of the recipe, becuase I only had 3 packages of cream cheese, so I used an 8 inch pan instead, and it was perfect!!! I have decided to go into business to rival The Cheesecake Factory Restaurant!

I first had this cheesecake at a work function about 5 years ago. It was the first cheesecake I had ever tasted. I was immediately in love and have made it every year since for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I've never been a huge fan of pumpkin pie, so the subtle flavor is so wonderful and the texture is so creamy. For those who end up with a soggy crust, just double wrap your pan. I constantly get requests for this recipe and am not shy about sharing it.

Rating: 4
All or fforks in our tent in the woods, but if you don't have a leak-proof springform pan, don't despair - use a large enough (note I said LARGE ENOUGH) piece of tin foil to cover the pan and up to the level of your water bath. This should eliminate any leaks of water into the cake. No, it doesn't taste quite like a pumpkin pie. It's not supposed to.

Rating: 4
Supreme taste and texture. Make this one! Tastes even better the next day. Water bath is essential, the top was a beautiful color- not a crack. Bought a leakproof springform pan w/lip from Kaiser la Forme ($40.) and think it had a lot to do with my success.

Very good. I needed to add more butter to the crust, but otherwise it was tasty, rich, and wonderful. I added about 2 tsp. of maple syrup to the mix and it was great. Much easer to make the a pie and looks better too.

This was wonderfully cream and delicious! It had just the right combination of cheesecake flavor and slight pumpkin taste. I followed the directions exactly regarding the water bath. It baked up beautifully without one crack!! My guest raved and raved how creamy and smooth this was. Definitely a repeater. My new Thanksgiving dessert!!!!!!!!!!!

Rating: 4
This is one of the most delicious and satisfying cheesecakes I have ever tasted. I have varied the recipe - added more spice to give it a richer flavor and use a gingerbread crust. I also beat the egg whites until extremely fluffy as it tends to make the cheesecake "lighter". One may thing that with this much creamcheese it is of a denser consistency, however is amazingly smooth, creamy, and light. It is so good guests are coming back for thirds!

A very nice cheesecake, though not as "pumpkiny" as I would have liked. I added more spices after tasting the batter. But overall it's moist, creamy, and not too sweet. A great fall dessert.

To Vancouver (and a few others): I'm wondering if the folks who say the pumpkin flavor wasn't strong enough are expecting this to taste like pumpkin pie. The "oddly sour" taste you describe, well - that's cheesecake! I'm making this for the fourth year in a row, and I can't recommend it highly enough. But you can definitely add more pumpkin and more spices - it's great either way!

Rating: 3
I followed this recipe the first time around, and it was good.. but it seemed more like orange-colored cheesecake rather than pumpkin cheesecake.. i roughly double the pumpkin, spices and alcohol, with the addition of nutmeg, white pepper and a touch of clove. to assure proper texture, i add an extra egg, and a teaspoon or two of cornstarch. i let the batter sit in the fridge for about 2 days, bring it to room temp, bake it in a water bath, and it is ridiculously good. i sell this version for my catering company... it hasn't failed me yet!

I made this cheesecake soon after it appeared in Bon Appetit in 1997. Love at first bite! I have made it at least once every fall since then. My birthday is in October, and this is my "birthday cake." I replace the water bath with a pan of water in the bottom of the oven, add a teaspoon or two of pumpkin pie spice and reduce the baking time to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Don't understand why the recipe says to bake the cake until it cracks. Who wants that? I turn off the oven while the cheesecake center is still slightly jiggly, leaving it in the oven to finish cooking and slowly reach room temp. The result is a luscious, moist (uncracked) creamy pumpkin delight. Garnish with pecan halves because they complement the flavor and hint at the chopped nuts in the crust. When I serve this cheesecake, guests always request the recipe and I happily oblige.

I just made this cheesecake again for a Halloween party. It was fabulous. The only changes I made were to use all vanilla wafers for the crust, and about one quarter cup maple syrup. Baking in the water bath makes the cheesecake incredibly creamy. Everyone loved it.

Rating: 1
Although I did receive quite a few compliments on this cheesecake (including one person who used 'extra-orgasmic' as part of the description), I don't think I'd make this cheesecake again. The pumpkin flavour just wasn't that strong - perhaps needs additional spices (allspice, nutmeg, more cinnamon, etc.). It tasted oddly sour to me. Also, in the past I have tried recipes that use the water bath technique and always had a soggy crust as a result (ick!) So this time, instead of the bain-marie I used a large pan of hot water underneath the cake which preheated in the oven. I also decreased the temperature to 325F and baked it only for 1.5 hours - there were no cracks but the crust was still soggy, unpalatable and when sliced, stuck in clumps to the plate. I served it with a caramel sauce made with golden sugar, butter, cream, salt, rum & bourbon and toasted choppped pecans - which was actually the highlight of this dessert. Too bad as I had high hopes for this one. Have tried the marbled pumpkin cheesecake several years ago and was disappointed by that one too. Again I think I would only bake pumpkin cheesecake if I were selling my house as the smell is amazing. My search continues...

This is a late review as I made this for Thanksgiving 2002. Everyone loved it! I used Penzey's pumpkin pie spice. The only thing I never do with a cheesecake is place the springform pan in water while baking. Ruins the crust. I lowered the temperature during the last half of baking time and it didn't crack.

This is the third year I have made this for the holidays, and it's a huge hit. I use ginger snaps instead of graham crackers for the crust, and I absolutely do the bain marie. I have tried to bake it without, and it was a cracked mess. This is my family's favorite dessert. I couldn't make something else if I wanted to!

I made this for the first time, and found the recipe to be easy to follow and the reviews extremely helpful. I upped the spices and added 1/4 t. nutmeg, and 1/8 t. cloves. I might upping the amounts again, but keep the cloves the same at 1/8 t. Also, I am not a big "nut" fan, so next time, I will either use alot less pecans or take them out all together. I found that if you don't like nuts, you won't care for the crust. The amount of pecan pieces seemed a bit much. Maybe just 1/4 c. would be sufficient, and the other 3/4 c. to gingersnaps or graham cracker crumbs. Besides that, the cheesecake came out nicely baked, it comes out brown on top, not light or white. AND it didn't crack! :-)

Served this for today's family Thanksgiving meal, and it was enjoyed by all. It's hard to compete with the traditional pies, but this one gave those pies some big competition. Highly recommend the nice presentation touch of a warm carmel/pecan sauce on the top each each slice. I kept waiting for it to 'crack', so baked it an extra 25 minutes. Still no crack, but the result was perfecto!

Fabulous. I took the advice of the other raters and doubled the amount of spices and added a couple of pinches of nutmeg. I used ready made pie crust to save time and did not set the crusts in a roasting pan. Instead, I put put some water in a pan at the bottom of the oven. This recipe is definentaly a keeper!

Made this last night for my husband's 50th Halloween birthday and it was a huge hit.

Superb! A big hit. I suggest adding 3-4 times the recommended amounts of ginger and cinnamon. Also go for the ginger snaps instead of the graham crackers. I skipped the 1/4 inch bath (too fussy!) and instead just put a bowl of water on the bottom rack (which I do for all my cheesecakes to help prevent cracking). Perfection!

We loved this cheesecake! I was inspired by "A Cook from SF Bay Area" - made half the filling (don't have a springform) and baked in a 9" glass pie pan. I did use the whole amount of crust. It came out perfect baked for one hour - no water bath. I also upped the spices a bit and added a pinch of nutmeg. Everyone agreed that it was better than traditional pumpkin pie! We've never rated anything from this site a 4, but my husband declared that the crust pushed this to "a dish beyond compare"!!!!

i made this for thanksgiving and was satisfied, but not that impressed - the reviews were so glowing that i was expecting something amazing. it's creamy and yummy, but i prefer denser cheesecakes. and i think the pumpkin flavor could be more pronounced - it seemed a bit wimpy to me. but the crust was great, and the preparation really easy. i would make it again, but i'd like to try some other recipes.

I make a cheesecake similar to this one except it has maple syrup in the recipe. But the really good thing is the caramel sauce that goes with it. It is 1 cup whipping cream and 3/4 cup maple syrup boiled rapidly for 15 - 20 minutes, until the sauce thickens. Then add 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Serve the sauce warm with the cheesecake. It is so wonderful.

QUICK TIP: I've been making this cheesecake with chocolate cookie crust for 3 years and get nothing but rave reviews. Pressed for time, this Thanksgiving I decided to use 2 Oreo pre-made crusts. My devious intention was to transfer the crust to my springform and pass it off as my own (GASP!). However, a small disaster forced me to divide the batter between the two crusts and bake them in the factory aluminum tins. (ditched the water bath and baked for 1hr) OMG! What a pleasant surprise. Although aesthetically this approach is pretty dismal, the thinnner denser cake tasted even better than the traditional approach. And though the best looking prize went to someone else's cranberry lattice cake, my ugly little foil cheesecake got voted "best dessert" from the food snobs we dined with.

This cheesecake was so easy (I'd never made a cheesecake before and it really was easy!) and soooo delicious, you should decide right now to make it! I used ginger snap crumbs instead of nuts, since I'm allergic. All I can say is...YUM! Make this for dessert. You'll feel so proud, I promise! Everyone at Thanksgiving gathered around and talked about how good it was, even though I made many other desserts. I would really like to taste a bit more pumpkin flavor and more spices, but everyone else said no. So, make your shopping list now. Thanksgiving is over, but this will please everyone any time. Make it!

Experiment with spices for a more powerful taste. Even a perfect clutz like me got this recipe correct! So what are you waiting for? Get the ingredients and go for it!

I used 1/2 less of an egg the second time I made this recipie, and it was much fluffier. Also, make sure NOT to over bake the crust, it will taste a bit burned.

Made this cake for Thanksgiving, in lieu of the traditional pumpkin pie, and it was a big hit.

I brought this cheesecake to work and everyone loved it. I'll definitely make it again but I might halve the filling recipe because it's a lot of cheesecake!
