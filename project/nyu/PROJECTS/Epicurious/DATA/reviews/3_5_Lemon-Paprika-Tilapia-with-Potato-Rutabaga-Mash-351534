I did not have any rutabaga, so I served the tilapia with regular mashed potatoes. The tilapia was delicious! I made it as directed using smoked paprika as other reviewers suggested; I also doubled the sauce because we like sauce in our house. To serve, I put the tilapia on top of the mashed potatoes, then the sauce over that, which gave it a very nice restaurant-quality presentation. My husband has asked that this dish be in regular rotation, an honor he rarely (if ever!) bestows on seafood dishes. This is likely to be my new go-to dish when company is over.

Perfect for a Sunday evening meal. I modified the recipe to avoid a grocery trip interruption to my laid back Sunday. I did not have rutabaga so I used parsnips. I used regular paprika but added a hint of cayenne pepper. No whipping cream so I used evaporated milk as well. Despite all these switches it was very delicious! Also something I very much appreciated was that it could be scaled for one person serving. I am saving the extra potatoes for dinner later this week.

Good flavors. Recommend using the smoked paprika as mentioned by others. Very quick and easy to put together.

First, I only made the fish part of this recipe, but as I ate this I just kept thinking, "this is DELICIOUS!" Made more so by how easy and fast it is. I made some VERY minor changes: 1) used smoked paprika, 2) used smart balance margarine/Pam in place of butter (I know, a bit of a sacrilege, but we are watching our fat intake!). But! I did use the cream, so we aren't being THAT crazy! I HIGHLY recommend the fish part of this recipe. Absolutely fantastic!

Cooked this for dinner last night and it was delicious! I actually made the mash a few days ago and reheated it at the last minute. I boiled the rutabaga for 15 minutes, then added the potatoes for 15 minutes. And the rutabaga was still hard to mash. But very good nonetheless. And the tilapia was awesome! The flavors are great, and the dish is beautiful! The fish has a burnt red color on the outside (from the paprika), the sauce is bright orange with green specks (parsley), and the mash is yellow from the rutabaga. It's really a good looking dish. BTW I cooked the fish first, then the sauce, like the recipe recommends. The fish didn't get that cold -- I just tented it w/ foil.

Wow. Really didn't feel like fixing dinner with friends just arriving in town but I'm totally glad that I did. Had to make a couple of changes as we are in Panguitch which is a town of 1,200 in central Utah. While there are probably 50 families in town that grow rutabagas in their gardens finding them in the town store is a no chance so we substituted turnips and they gave the dish a great flavor. Would definitely start the turnips earlier next time. The fish was incredible, just right. Cooked exactly as directed and it was perfection. Probably went a little heavier on the paprika but if I'm not baking I gave up measuring a while back. Also did the fish first then transferred to the warming drawer to hold the temperature while making the sauce. Had no problem with the temperature of the fish. Best investment we've ever made. Three hours later drinking wine and (personally) suffering through American Idol we and our guests are still talking about dinner. That's a sign you've hit a home run.

I took the advice of previous reviewers and... 1) boiled the rutabaga for 15 minutes, then added the potato and boiled both for another 18. The result was completely smooth and delicioso !!! 2) made the sauce then sauteed the fish. The sauce ended well but I had to tweak it considerably as I had slightly over-reduced the wine on the first try. My husband really loved this dish.

I really liked the fish...I would make that again without the sauce. The rutabaga mashed potatos were also good. My boyfriend wasn't a big fan of the rutabaga chunks...I couldn't really mash them well because I made this at his place without a potato masher.

The fish was good but the rutaba and potato mash was wonderful! I used fat free evaporated milk instead of whole milk and cream - didn't miss the fat a bit!

I loved the potato-rutabaga mash - it was light without being watery. The fish could have had more flavor, but it's possible my paprika was a little old. There are better tilapia recipes out there

This came out way better than I expected! I'm a big fan of tilapia, but tried with cod, and sauce was a great match for it. Per other reviews, give extra time for rutabaga to boil before adding potato. Also, cook sauce before fish. Smoked paprika was a good choice.

I actually liked the potato-rutabaga mixture, though I'd use an electric mixer on it next time. The tilapia was okay; I had a sweet Hungarian paprika that I usually love and it really just fell flat. The sauce needed to thicken quite a bit more but was delicious!

I thought this was very good. I also took the tip of other raters and made sauce and fish seperately. I did not use the whipping cream and was surprised to find I did not need it. Just let the sauce reduce down a bit more. It was very lite and fresh tasting. I served it with rice which I put some of the reduction on first and then laid the fish over it with the remainder of reduction. A salad on the side finished it all off. Husband who is a picky fish eater, liked it very much.

Tips from reviewers were VERY helpful - AGREE - make sauce first- then fish (or other meat) doesn't get cold. We used the Smoky Spanish paprika (be sure you know what it tastes like-we happen to like it). We thought the lemon sauce was very nice. This is a simple sauce. We served it with Near East Couscous Parmesan mix (can't imagine potatoes and rutabaga with white fish). Sauce was excellent on it. We are fortunate to have an outstanding local seafood store so we had the sauce with a very fresh piece of sole and the lightness of the sauce allowed the subtlety and fresh taste of the fish to come through.

substituted carrots for the rutabaga, and breaded the tilapia, putting the seasoning in with the breadcrumbs. also made the sauce seperately. worked very well, everything was served hot and my five-year-old cleaned his plate!

Eh. Just ok and the preparation was not smooth. Reducing the sauce took me more than 10 minutes, so the fish got cold while I was preparing the sauce (I was following the directions as written). If I ever make this again, I would start the sauce in a separate pan before cooking the fish, and then start warming the fish pan as I add the whipping cream etc to the sauce. That way, the pan will be ready for the fish when the sauce is done and two-three mins later the whole thing is finished and nothing is cold yet. Also, whoever wrote "rutabaga adds an appealing, slightly sweet flavor to the potatoes" was totally lying. Rutabagas, as we found out, are really not sweet or appealing. They are, however, a-peeling.

This was good. Nothing spectacular, but good. Served with sauteed green beans.

I used a smoky spanish Paprika and it was very, very good. Definitely a keeper recipe for tilapia.

I always thought of Talapia as bland, but this is a surprisingly tasty combination. Needs a salad or something. The mixture of potatoes and rutabaga are known to the Scots as "Tatties and Neeps." Start boiling the "Neeps" 15 minutes before adding the "Tatties", otherwise you won't be able to mash the "Neeps."
