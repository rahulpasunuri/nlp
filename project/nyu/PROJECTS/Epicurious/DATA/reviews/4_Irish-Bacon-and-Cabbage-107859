Love this dish! Made it a couple years ago for St Pat's and again tonight. I put the cabbage and carrots in with the pork so they finished together. Tender, flavorful. For the cook from South Carolina- you don't need to peel each clove of garlic. Just cut thru the entire head of garlic to expose all the flavor. With the long cooking time, the garlic mellows and softens, as it does when roasted. I didn't serve the garlic but the flavor it lends is terrific! When you pull out the meat and veggies the papery garlic peels stay in the pot. Will put much of this in the freezer and can't wait to make some tender pork sandwiches. Yum.

A good dish but there are better recipes that you can find on Epicurious. I also agree with the other reviewer about the pork being greasy the next day.

Outstanding!! My husband is from Ireland and is VERY picky about his Irish food. I almost didn't try this because I've had so many failures making this simple Irish dish that I had pretty much given up on getting it right. The salt brine is the missing link for me. I have since found out from my in- laws that the pork they buy in the store in Ireland has already been brined. This just isn't available here in the South. This is absolutely delicious!!!!

This was very good. I had my doubts. The meat was perfect. I just didn't care for the texture when it was cold the next day, almost greasy (hence the 3 forks). I followed others' advice and added veggies to pot rather than taking out the meat.

This recipe was a big hit with all of my guests. Though it takes a lot of (inactive) time, it's wonderfully simple and enormously flavorful.

My husband judged this "probably the best ham" he's ever eaten. My only complaint is that it completely fell apart after 3 hours' cooking. And I wasn't sure about the instructions on the garlic -- do you separate and peel each clove after slicing the head in half before putting it in the pot? Is it meant to become mushy bits? Did I overcook the whole thing?

This recipe is just how I make it, except I use beer to cover meat when cooking instead of water...

"Bacon & cabbage" is everyday traditional food in Ireland, and it's been a long time since the average rural household cured its own pork! Potato is an essential part of the meal, and the cabbage and carrots are cooked separately, their cooking times being different. Actually until rather recently, the amount of bacon per person would be small in relation to the amount of vegetables ."Julia Child and Company," from the 1970s gives a good recipe for corning for your own beef, which is like New England style corned beef--that is, gray, not red, because NE style uses salt, not the saltpeter which produces the red. "A Cook from Sale" has the chronology a bit off: the salting of beef in America preceded large-scale Jewish immigration. The corned beef and cabbage meal that some have in USA for St. Patrick's Day is the same as what is called New England Boiled Dinner, which has been around a long, long time.

I cooked the veggies including potatoes at the last and all came out great, will make it again. Love the cabbage!

My daughter made this for XMAS eve dinner without the cabbage. We had other sides. The pork was moist, flavorful, juicy and tender and considering the price of the meat, this was amazing. I am definitely going to make this pork again.

I wouldn't change a thing. A crowd-pleaser.

Haven't had a chance to try yet. I'm in Britain now and nobody here heard of corned beef ( had to buy salted beef and pickeling spices) so I investigated and found it was Irish bacon until the Irish went to America and couldn't get the same thing so adopted the Jewish salt beef....hence Americans having corned beef and Irish having pork.

My Irish husband couldn't understand why I would be making pork for our St. Patricks Day celebration. He's a very traditional sort of guy. I on the other hand like to try new things. I was a bit worried that the guests would be disappointed to see that corned beef was not on the menu. But I decided make it anyway. I live in Miami and the pork here is abundant. Anyway, no one complained and my husband was quite happy. I liked it even better the next day. It made delicious leftovers. I added some leeks to the vegetables. I was going to make Champ but ended up making the recipe on this site for mashed potatoes and leeks. That menu item changed when I found a bunch of delicious looking leeks at the grocery.

I just made this for a St. Patty's Day party and everyone loved it! I entertain quite often and was told this was one of my best meals yet. I served it with the Champ mashed potatoes and the the Chocolate Guinness Goodness. I find I can't go wrong when everyone gives these recipes four fork ratings! Try it ... you'll like it!

All the previous reviews are absolutely correct - this was fantastic! I made it for St. Patrick's Day (also with the parsley mashed potatoes). The leftovers made the absolutely best pulled pork sandwiches I've ever had - moist, tender, juicy. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!

This was so delicious! The pork was melt in your mouth tender. The veggies I put in about the last 15 minutes of cooking and they were perfect. I served it with the parsley mashed potatoes on the same page, it was wonderful. I will definately be making this one again.

Better than corned beef and cabbage. Served this with Champ (mashed potatoes w/ green onions), Guinness, and soda bread. I made a custard and apple pie for dessert. Made a wonderful St Pat's day meal. Don't overcook the cabbage.

Great recipe! Meat was very tender and moist. I only used 1 head of garlic - 3 heads seemed like it would be too much. My husband absolutely loved it!

This was a very tasty recipe. I know went I read it and seen 3 cups of kosher that sounded like a alot but it was very good and it wasn't salty and the meat was very tender it almost full off the bone. The only thing I would do I would cooked the carrots first in the juice and then add the cabbage and I would add a little more peppercorns.
