I love this. Raspberries and rhubarb are two of my favorite foods. This is so simple it is foolproof. We have it with yoghurt in the morning and with icecream for dessert. If you are concerned about sugar I have substituted Splenda and although it changes the taste slightly it is still fine

This is a delicious and simple sauce that we prefer, now, over strawberry sauce on shortcake. If you like rhubarb at all, you will love this AND it keeps in the refrigerator much longer than sugared strawberries.
