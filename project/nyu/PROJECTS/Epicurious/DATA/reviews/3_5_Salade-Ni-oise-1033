This is such a refreshing summer salad. It is simple, and it allows you to utilize fresh vegetables and herbs from your garden. I have made this a few times, and my family loves it every time. It is great with a homemade baguette which can be used to soak up the dressing.

WOW! I used Starkist olive oil and garlic marinated yellowfin tuna, and oh-my, this is one of the tastiest salads my kitchen has ever produced!

We love this salad! We use Starkist tuna from the foil packets and mix in a little olive oil to moisten it. It's great with whatever vegetables we have on hand :-)

The recipe does not specify but I think you should use oil-packed tuna. I used water-packed and felt we needed more dressing to compensate. The dressing is quite good with bits of fresh baguette dipped in. A tasty and light dinner.
