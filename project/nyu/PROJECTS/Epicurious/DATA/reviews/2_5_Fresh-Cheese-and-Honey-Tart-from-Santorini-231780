We all enjoyed this Greek version of a cheesecake this Easter! The flavors are subtle but delicious. I served it with strawberries that were chopped and mixed with sugar, lemon & basil, which was a nice accompaniment. My only complaint is that the crust is VERY bland. I think next time I'll add a tbsp or so of sugar to the crust - I did enjoy the texture of it, never having had an oil crust before. Good recipe!

I have to say this was the WORST dessert ever made by my gourmet club. We have been meeting four times a year for the past ten years and I have never been as disappointed in a dessert as I have been with this choice (and I chose the recipe!)

I just made this tart tonight and had my first piece. Absolutely delicious. The honey undertones were great with the spiciness of the cinnamon and the creaminess of the cheese. In an unconventional twist, I sprinkled some crystallized ginger over half of the tart, and it was amazing. The flavors came together perfectly. The crust was great (coming from someone who usually butchers an oil crust). I'd make this again in a heartbeat!

This tart is ok, I did follow the directions to a T. However did anyone else really think that the dough needed salt? It just didnt have that rounded out flavor. Subbed Mace for the mastic, as I was unable to find it and ran out of time to get to the spice shop. Made the individual ones and presentation wise they were lovely.

I was disappointed by the filling. I drown practically everything in honey (toast, yogurt, etc) and found the combination in this recipe extremely unappetizing. The crust, however, had a lovely flavor.

It is really delicious and even though I come fom Greece, none of my friends knew this recipe. I have done it once, and I'll do it again...

The filling is really delicious. We make our own honey, and this delicately flavored filling really showcased the honey flavor wonderfully. The crust was pretty bland, and there was way too much of it. I would make this again, but I would reduce the amount of crust and increase the amount of filling.

Interesting texture and flavors. I'm not a huge fan of oil crusts, but all in all I really liked this. I liked the simplicity of the flavors -- one could really taste the honey undertones, but it wasn't overpowering.

from the longer article about Greek Easter celebrations: Mastic, the crystallized sap from a wild shrub, is available at Middle Eastern markets. "For this recipe," says Kremezi, "the finely grated zest of half a lemon makes a fine substitute."

What is mastic?
