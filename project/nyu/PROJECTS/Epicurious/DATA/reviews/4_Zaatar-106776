This has become my favorite spice. I sprinkle it on pita or flat bread with EVOO and a personal mixture of salt, pepper and garlic powder. Then I toast it in my convection oven until it gets a bit brown around the edges. Sometimes, I add some crushed olives & onion on it with some mozzarella cheese. Yum! It goes great with Old Moon Zin from Trader Joes. Try it, you'll love it!!

If I could give this 5 forks I would. I made this and Muhammara (equally as easy and delicious) as a 2 part appetizer. I used a flat Tandori bread, but pita, and naan would work just as good. I then sat a dish of olive oil out and after a little dip-dip... smiles all around. Also try this on a garden salad with blue cheese dressing. It adds a nice tang to the salad.

This was awesome. I made it in about 5 minutes flat. We just had it as an appetizer with garlic ciabatta dipped in olive oil and then dipped in the mix. So flavorful and different... I can't wait to use it at a dinner party.

Quick, easy and tasty; I never make hummus without it!

Easy and tasty! We used the yogurt/olive oil idea, and could not get enough of it. Cucumber slices were the favorite dipper. Nice appetizer for a Middle Eastern-themed dinner.

An easy spice mix, with a nice crisp taste. Great sprinkled on tomatoes, eggs, and veggie salads.

We use this to make a delicious Lebanese snack called "Manooshi". The best way to make it is to use refrigerator bread dough, like Bridgeford, roll out pieces of dough to make 6" rounds (like pizza crust)and brush the olive oil and zaatar mixture on it - then bake. The raw dough takes up the flavors better than pita, and the aroma is wonderful. Stack them on a platter and eat for breakfast. Better at room temp.

This recipe for za'atar is so good! It's better than the jumbo package I've bought before and easy to make too. I doubled the recipe as suggested and put it on pita brushed with olive oil and warmed in the oven yum. Ground sumac is available online from ethnicgrocer.com.

My mom always made this, I'm miles away from my mom so I can't have her cooking much. The recipe was really easy to make and it tasted almost like my moms
