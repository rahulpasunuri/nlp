I have no idea why people need 3 hours to cook this, as prior reviews suggest, so long as you are cooking the right sized lamb. Following this advice, I cooked longer. But at the 2 hour point, I was at 165F internal. The principal criticism of this recipe, I suppose, is the lack of punch in this dish. To me, lamb needs something serious to it -- this is why lamb and mint is a classic. I thought maybe the wine with the herbes de provence would be enough, but it wasn't.

I didn't have a meat thermometer, so I just went by the suggested timing and the roast was perfect! We plated the lamb slices with some of the juices in the pan which not only helped keep it warm, kept the meat juicy. Wonderful!

I made this recipe for Easter this year too, but I changed it so much can't say it was the same. First I used 2 fresh rosemary sprigs. 1 for the lamb and the other for the vegetables. I only had a 3.5 lb lamb, and I think it took about 1 hour and 25 min or so. It came out pink inside, very juicy. I also flipped the lamb over after 30 min. The fatty part was on top for the last half and it got a nice crusty layer. I used the same amount of vegetables, and I added 3 turnips (peeled and quartered) which was a good addition. I might try yukon gold next time. I also added some lemon juice after the first 30 min. It probably took longer than it should have because it was a bit crowded and there was a lot of juice. When the juice was reduced it was not too heavy. Problem is, how do you keep it warm without cooking it more?

Althugh I am a huge fan of Epicurious and the great menus, this recipe was a big disappointment. I did a large leg of lamb about 10 lbs, it took almost 3 hours. Very difficult to time the meal, when you expect the meat to take half of the time. There was very little taste to the meat and the jus.

I made this recipe for Easter, yesterday. My husband and I both felt that it was a nice recipe, but not a wow. The 5lb lamb turned out cooked perfectly to medium rare, with the directions given, and the meat was juicy. I did add extra chopped garlic to the herb mixture when coating the lamb. The lamb itself just did not have a nice crusty exterior that one usually gets by roasting the meat, without foil. The taste of the herbs with garlic, as well as the juicy meat, was nice. The veggies were tasty. I followed another reviewers comments and when removing the lamb and jus, I then placed the pan with veggies back into the oven to roast for about 15 minutes longer. All in all it was a nice dinner. It is just our preferrence to have the meat more "rostie' on the outside, with the pink to red interior when it comes to lamb.

This was the first lamb roast I have cooked. The lamb was from Costco and it came out very well. It is 4* comfort food. I would definitely make again. As everyone else says it takes longer, almost 3 hours for us (but I used a small roasting pan with lots of root vegetables, so the meat was crowded).

My husband declared this one of his favorites. I only used onions, garlic, and celery when roasting and it was great./

I made this for Easter dinner and was very pleased with the results. I made the following changes: *substituted several celery stalks for the celery root *used a full 2 cups each of wine and stock *pulled the lamb out when it reached 130 degrees and drained off the liquid for gravy while returning the veggies to the oven to continue roasting another 25-30 minutes *reduced the gravy for a full 40 minutes *added several tablespoons of heavy cream to the gravy just before serving. The gravy was heavenly and the lamb and veggies very good too.

This was a nice and easy dish for a large dinner party. I'm not a very experienced cook, but this was pretty foolproof, and my guests loved it! I didn't bother with the jus, just served the lamb and vegetables. I left it in longer, as well - almost 2 hours.

Turned out very well, but timing according to recipe came up very short (unless you like lamb extremely rare). I used parsnips as the celery root was not available, and increased the amount of vegetables, and was glad I did, as they are delicious roasted/braised along with the meat.
