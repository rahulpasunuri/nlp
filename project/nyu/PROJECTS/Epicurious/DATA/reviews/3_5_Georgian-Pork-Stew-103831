I was very excited to make this recipe, based on all the positive reviews; however, it was not that good. I even bought the fenugreek seeds which was supposedly very important. Unfortunately, it was underwhelming!!

outstanding; I served with the epicurious recipe for kasha with onions and walnuts, which adds a whole new dimension of texture and flavor to this already multi-textured dish. Also recommend 1 hour in 350 degree oven!

Best dish I've made in quite a while...and that's saying a lot! Loved the flavors and it paired really well with some Nebbiolo I had picked up and the suggested cheesy polenta and Georgian salsa. This one's definitely a keeper.

This was fantastic! I wasn't able to find old fashioned grits (just the instant), so I haven't made that component yet, but the stew with the salsa was amazing. I'm definitely making this again.

WOWOOWOWWO. Really super fantastic. Turmeric instead of marigold, pom seeds were totally worth it. Served with the elarji (also great) and lightly sauteed mustard greens. Thanks to the cook who suggested reusing the cooking liquid- REALLY nice touch, although i did skim it and dilute it still. And to all the people who got mad about the comment from Idyllwild cook- I know a lot of people think LA/SF when California comes to mind, but it's a really big state with many locales deep in the boondocks that have an even less cosmopolitan reputation than the American "deep south" does over here. Idyllwild is one such place in Riverside county, a bottom-tier resort city dependent on tourists from socal and an economically depressed, isolated local population. Please instead pity this person.

Very interesting flavors! You have to get the fenugreek (I found mine in the bulk spices section of my local fancy grocery store) that's what gives it the exotic taste. Made it with the Georgian salsa and the cheesy cornmeal pudding on the side. Yum!

After reviewing this recipe myself I took a 2nd look at the previous reviews. Out of the billions of recipes online why the hell would someone chime in about a recipe they have not made nor intend to make?? I know these particular reviews are 10 yrs.old but ive seen it before on other recipes. No one dish is for everyone, but to denounce a foreign flavor because you cant get it at Wal-Mart is ignorant. There's a whole world of culinary "gems" and "turds" beyond North America.I'll shut up now.

Ive made alot of international dishes off this site and this..so far..is my favorite. 4 forks for the first time. I used 2 jalapenos instead of 4 for the Ajika. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I had to look around a bit for the Fenugreek but it was worth it. I served it on top of garlic mashed potatoes with green beans on the side. Its a keeper.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. I am a long-time fan of Georgian food, and I'm always glad to try new recipes. If you're looking for more look up badrijani or satsivi, you won't regret it! And as someone pointed out earlier: fenugreek is an ingredient in many curries, which is useful if you're trying to use up a whole package.

This recipe hit the spot! Definitely comfort food. The ingredients were balanced and I found this stew easy to make. In the first part of the recipe, it asks you to simmer the meat until the juices have evaporated. I had a cup of juice left and instead of simmering it all down I saved it and added it back in when the recipe calls for a cup of water. In regards to all the snarky remarks made by earlier commentators about the spices; if you have not made the recipe and all you can do is making silly and uneducated remarks about spices that are commonly used in most of the world you really have no place to leave this type of feedback on an epicurean site such as Epicurious. Instead, just keep cooking your hamburgers and hotdogs.

Great blend of seasonings. Be careful with the salt. I used two large jalapenos instead of four, because my kids were eating this. The salsa recipe makes about four times too much. Otherwise it's a go.

Rating: 3
Absolutely delicious! If you like spicy comfort food, this is one for you. I couldn't find fenugreek at the grocery store, and didn't have time to swing by the international market. Instead I used about 1/4 tsp of fennel and a few dashes of curry powder (fenugreek is usually the 2nd ingredient after coriander) and thought the flavor was wonderful. I can't wait to try it with the correct spices. With my leftovers, I added some great northern beans. It made it more like a chili, but the beans took nothing away from the flavor of the original stew. Do NOT skip the Georgian Salsa that accompanies this.

This was amazing. I followed the recipe exactly and we loved it. I can't wait to make it again. Thanks Scott - I did toast the spices - the smells started our mouths watering. I did change the order with the relish (cilantro and basil at the end to avoid getting a muddy colour) Also, I served it with polenta because we didn't have hominy grits and the side dish was perfect. The corn polenta was fabulous with the relish.

I thought this was an extremely interesting and tasty stew. The pork shoulder I found at the store was way too fatty so I did a leaner cut and it was still really great. The accompanying spicy blend is a must. I will definitely make again and experiment a little more next time. Yum!

This dish has got to rate in the top ten. It's worth the trip to the ethnic market for the coriander and fenugreek seeds. Make sure you toast them in a frying pan first before grinding. This stew has a fraction of the volume that most stews have, but 10 times the flavor. This is a must-make !! Follow recipe to the word.

this is a great dish. I followed the recipe exactly both times I made it. Everyone liked it from my elderly parents to my 10 year old son. I will make it often the Fenugreek is very interesting new spice that I want to use more of.

I must say, this is one of the most interesting review files I've ever read here at epicurious. Just thought it was amusing that I found this recipe while searching for uses for the fenugreek seed in my cupboard :) Looking forward to making the stew.

I love to see Georgian recipes gain popularity... Georgian food is very unusual and so good... my two godchildren (from Tbilisi) were here and we made this recipe and they said it was very much like home.... there is a Georgian spice, though, that we had brought home w/ us, and we used that instead of the mixture in the recipe... Suneli, it's called, and like curry, every housewife makes her own mixture at the market.... Also, the pomegranate seeds really make it authentic and really are a great sweet garnish...

Made this for the first time last weekend - my kids, ages 9 & 7, who are normally fussy eaters, absolutely lapped it up, even dipping their bread in the delicious sauce. The flavours were sublime, the blend of spices subtle yet flavourful. The elarji was a great accompaniment - I also served with smashed potatoes and steamed crunchy green beans. This recipe is a winner as is, don't change a thing!

This was a wonderful stew - the flavors were wonderful and rich. I'd make a bouquet garni with the herbs & spices next time - I just can't seem to grind finely enough. This last time I made it, I used some leftover pork from the ROAST PORK WITH PORT JUS AND CHIPOTLE-GLAZED APPLES recipe found here at Epicurious. The cumin on the pork was perfect with the coriander and cilantro in this dish. (Another favorite recipe, hey, it's a stew, so I played with it!)

My ajika was VERY hot--not a sauce for the faint of heart--but my family handled it. The stew itself will be even more welcome this winter,I think. I found the flavor combinations intriguing and complex, and heck, even here in way-upstate NY I knew I'd find fenugreek. I served this Georgian dish with American sweet corn and pickled cukes and radishes. Great leftovers, too!

Rating: 4
Superb and exotic, without being overbearing. The spice mix gives it a delightful Eastern flavor without the harshness of some curries. Easy to make (use a large Dutch oven and double the recipe) and a hit with the wife. Freezes well, too. By the way, fenugreek seeds and most other Indian spices and rices can be found for cheap at Kalustyan's in Manhattan (www.kalustyans.com).

I also finished this dish in a 350 degree oven. the meat is very tender and the spicy meat and ajika goes great with the elarji.

Anyone who has ever cooked Indian food would be familiar with the ingredients in this dish. Fenugreek (Methi to an Indian) is a digestive as well as a flavoring and readily available from all Indian grocers, as is turmeric and coriander. Incidentally, if you can locate an Indian store, they usually sell herbs and spices for a fraction of what you pay for those cute little bottles at the grocery store. I found this recipe easy to make and not at all intimidating plus it is well worth the effort. For the hour of simmering, I did this covered in a 350? oven. The pork was fall apart tender and very flavorful This is definitely a keeper and will be made regularly by me as my wife and son loved it.

This dish was excellent! I found the not so common spices at Cost Plus supermarket...it was well worth the search. Would difinately make this again as my family loved it and it also makes good leftovers.

This was delicious, despite the fact that I had no fenugreek (shopping list oversight). I quite liked the method of cooking the meat. It was better than browning first, because there was no need to do it batches and it used less oil. It produced a very tender meat. The mixture of coriander and basil in the ajuki was terrific. Served this with mashed potatoes. BTW, for others from Oz, the only place I've seen savoury here is in a "herbes de provence" mix. I got a friend to send some from Canada ages ago. You might be able to get it over the internet from the US.

HEllo. I was very unpleasantly surprised by the closemindedness of many people who resented amount of spices that they didi not have, length of cooking and even names of dishes...Hello - it's a Georgian dish! and names like ajika etc. are Georgian as well. Trust me, a Goergian would probably questions a name like clam chowder....Please, if it's not american it does not mean its bad - all spices are regularly used for a number of Georgian dishes. Lengthy cooking process brings up the flavor ans texture of the meat, and georgian women devote a lot more time to cooking then most modern american cooks, hence length is not a problem - while pork is cooking they can make another 3-4 dishes to be served for a particular meal. As for Eliri being a variation of Russian grits...well, guess what - many nations share dishes, just call them by different names...is that a surprise? elaji is designed to be served with Souluguni - purely georgian cheese . and since russian and georgian have longstanding relations for many centuries, dishes do get adapted and transferred across the border

Alvita natural tea company packages Fenugreek seeds. They can be found in the tea section of most health food stores. Diabetics use the product to help regulate blood sugar. Dr. Michael Murray explains the use in the Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine.

We agree with the other Adelaide reviewer (have we passed you at the market?) - great, solid, country food! We skipped the elarji and served this with fresh wood-oven baked bread, peasant style. The red pepper salsa is the real crown of this dish - and easy to make. On the issue of ingredients: we had to leave out summer savory (?), stuck with regular salt, and substituted turmeric. We found everything else through Asian food distributors at the city market. It's worth a look.

Found another recipe to use the fenugreek. It's a Bon Apetit recipe found on the site BERBERE-CRUSTED RACK OF LAMB I did like the flavour of the fenugreek so I think I'll try this one.

Rating: 3
Good solid country food. Good with potatoes or noodles, haven't tried the elarji. Easy to make, easier to eat. We're lucky here (Adelaide) to have a market which stocks everything mentioned and a load more. One question, what's kosher salt? And how does it fit with a pork recipe?

I made the stew and the salsa and served it with noodles. I thought it was delicious. But I agree that the method of cooking the meat was overly complex and I'd probablyl simplify it. The spicyness was great and my husband and I both loved the salsa.

Ah, finally a review, and a good one at that. You make the stew sound tasty and interesting. Thank you Owensboro, Kentucky.

I don't intend to make this recipe either, but I certainly encourage recipes that push the envelope. This one just doesn't appear rewarding enough for the trouble. Would love to see an actual review. More to the point, however, for those of you in "lovely" Concord, or whatever, Penzey Spices is an excellent source for spices, herbs, rubs, salad dressings, etc. You can go to their web site, or shop by catalog. They have a huge selection, great prices, and since turnover is high, you can be sure the fenugreek(?) hasn't been sitting on the shelf for years. I buy larger quantities (even cheaper that way), and then give lots away to my family and friends.

Well, I, certainly, agree with all so far. Of course, I didn't make it or its side dishes. But, the name of the recipe sounded appetizing!

FYI, recipes get posted on constant comment if they have been talked about (ie commented on) a lot in the last 30 days, as this one has. It doesn't mean that the recipe is a good one, or even useable... just that lots are discussing it.

I too, have not made this recipe nor do I intend to, therefore I cannot rate it. How did this recipe come to be posted in CONSTANT COMMENT anyway?

What a hoot! Love to check into this section and am still giggling at reviews. Ummm, scuse but what is a fenugreek seed? I live in lovely Concord, NH and I cannot even obtain saffron! Nevertheless, I would love to see an actual review from someone who makes this recipe! A dare to the cook from Onterio, eh? Tell us what it is like and then tell us how we can obtain a fenugreek seed. Hey? I am adventurous, I even have a bottle of Truffle Oil! Let us know if fenugreek seeds work with other recipes.

I can't award forks as I haven't yet made the recipe. But to the folks who have already reviewed, have a little imagination, try something different! Who wants to eat plain grilled/broiled meat and boiled vegetables all the time. Live a little! BTW I have all the ingredients to make this recipe in my pantry, would only have to buy fresh coriander on the day of making.
