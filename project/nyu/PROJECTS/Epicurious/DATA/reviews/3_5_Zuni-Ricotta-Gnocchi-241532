We made these yesterday and they worked wonderfully. We added absolutely no flour to the dough. Be sure to get as much water as possible out of the ricotta before starting -- we had local non-homogenized ricotta that I let drain in a fine mesh strainer (weighted down) for at least 8 hours. Before using it I covered a sheet pan with paper towel and spread the ricotta on the towels and pressed with another layer of paper towel. You want it really, really, dry. Another trick is to stick the made dough in the freezer for 10-15 minutes. You don't want it to freeze, but getting it very cold will make it easier to work with. Smaller gnocchi are easier to shape than large gnocchi. Lots of flour in the pan is necessary. When cooking, a minimal simmer is ideal -- boiling water will destroy the delecate gnocchi.

This recipe is actually wonderful if you use the one in the cookbook...this one on teh site is missing TWO CUPS OF ALL PURPOSE SIFTED FLOUR! Don't forget it or the gnocchi wont work...you will need a little more than that to roll it on a board as well. Try Suzanne Goin's as well...it is very similar and has a fabulous sauce.

OK, a couple of things you have to watch on this recipe. The cook from SF said the "brand" of the ricotta didn't matter, true, but it does need to be FRESH ricotta because getting the water out is difficult with the processed ones. If you can't find it,you can get fresh ricotta fed-xd to you from Gioia Cheese ($6.89 for 4lbs! but the freight will bump up that cost)Gioiacheeseinc.com. I did the cheese cloth overnight thing plus the food mill and did not need to add anything to the dough. I let the gnocchi sit in the 1/2" of flour uncovered for an hour in the fridge and they did firm up. Then I tossed them from hand to hand to remove the excess flour. That helped form them and remove flour. They turned out fine, but I have to say that they were just OK as a dish. I served it with the wilted spinach and the flavor is very subtle and really not that interesting. My family thought they were good, but nothing outstanding. A heavier sauce will mask the flavor completely so I thought this recipe was a lot of work (and cost if you have to fed-x the cheese in) without a big payoff.

I started making homemade ricotta at 4:30 (recipe this site) and wrapped the ricotta in cheese cloth and squeezed till no liquid came out. Then I broke up the ricotta and put the ball back together inside out and squeezed again. (does that make sense?) I repeated until the ricotta was very dry. I mixed the dough (video was excellent) and added NO flour to the dough. I made each gnocchi with a teaspoon and probably let them sit in the flour a bit longer than recommended. Then I chilled the gnocchi for an hour. The gnocchi cooked quickly (probably 1 minute after they floated) and didn't fall apart. I served tossed in butter, spinach, garlic and chilis. We ate at 7:30. It was very rich - the half recipe I made would easily have served four. I am so thrilled with the suggestion to put the ricotta through a food mill. I haven't been a fan of ricotta because of the grittyness and this was lovely and smooth. All of a sudden 'nudi' is really appealing.

I was a bit sketchy on this recipe. You see I made this recipe while working at Zuni 2-4 times a week for a year and a half, making several hundred each time. First I would like to say Congrats to those of you that this worked out for well and it's not your fault to those who struggled with this. I have seen many professional cooks with significant experience and advanced culinary training have these EXPLODE when dropped in water. I have seen this recipe botched so badly the menu had to be changed before dinner at menu meeting (or even during) service. This is a difficult thing to make, make no mistake about it. That said. These are wonderful, delicious, elegant and subtle. One of Judy's best ideas. They pair beautifully with any delicate vegetable and when properly made are truly sublime. My tips...and I should know. We used a fairly off the shelf brand of ricotta. You really don't need anything special. It is IMPERATIVE that the ricotta is drained and PRESSED really well. In the restaurant we would wrap it in cheese cloth, place in a strainer (perforated full hotel pan) and weight the top with two full two liter olive oil containers for at least 12-24 hours...longer is ok. You MUST use a food mill (use the largest hole plate). I have tried using other techniques at home...only food mill works You must use flour. This is where it gets tricky. You want to use at little flour at possible. The more flour you use the worse they taste but it is inevitable that some is necessary to get them to hold together. Start with none and test your batter...it will explode. Add a very small amount of flour. Test your batter. It will explode. Repeat this until they hold together...or you scream and throw the batter across the room; whichever comes first. Admittedly this is easier to do repeatedly when you are making 400 of them. Good Luck. This is a difficult but rewarding recipe. Best advice...be very gentle in all aspects of execution.

This is cavatelli, not gnocchi. Gnocchi are made with potato.

WHAT FLOUR I made this twice and both times they just dissolved. There is no flour in the recipe

Excellent. Technique is key. Watch the video. Can't wait to make them again.

The key to these gnocchi is getting the right amount of flour in the mix. If you have good quality ricotta from a cheese shop, properly drain it, and put through a strainer (unfortunately I do not own a food mill), you should need no more than 1/4 cup of flour in the mix, if any. I add about 1/8 of a cup of OO Italian flour/500g of ricotta - it tends to be smoother than other flours. The more experience you have forming quenelles of very wet batter, the easier it will be, and this is the most important part to getting softest gnocchi. Pity so many ricotta gnocchi recipes call for a cup or more of flour per pound of ricotta...more like ricotta pucks than dumplings. The higher ratio of cheese/egg to flour, the better (think what a souffle would be like if you added a bunch of unnecessary flour). Very good idea to refrigerate too - I like to gently flip them after 30 min to expose both sides to the cold air. Gentle dusting of flour once formed is vital. Such a cheap and tasty meal, can't ask for anything better...

Delicious and easy to make. I watched the video and carefully followed the recipe. The gnocchi came out like fluffy pillows. I used the sheep milk ricotta which is pretty dry. A huge dinner party hit! I added lemon zest and served them in a brown butter sauce with spinach and garlic.

I used drained brousse instead of ricotta. My sample gnoccho(is that the singular?) dissolved, so I added extra egg white, but it was still like putty. I ended up adding almost 1/3 c. flour before they would hold together, but once cooked, they were perfect : tender, flavorful, dreamy. I put nutmeg in the batter, tossed with spinach sautéed in olive oil and a little garlic, and sprinkled lemon juice on top. DELICIOUS.

I don't consider myself a novice cook, and i have never made gnocchi s before. So I bought the best ricotta, drained it over night, whipped the heck out of it and followed faithfully the recipe presented on the four page printout, I even watched the vidio, only to watch my gnocchis dissolve in the water. No where in the four page recipe does anyone mention flower! I finally went to Lidia's Italian to find out flour was needed. Shame on you!!!

I was recently given a recipe for homemade ricotta which I made yesterday morning. It was delicious but a lot so I went looking for ricotta recipes. Since Zuni is a great restaurant I knew this would be good. Even though my cheese passed the paper towel test in the recipe the gnocchi would not hold together. I tried adding egg white like the recipe suggests with no success but found that mixing some flour directly into the batter solved the problem. The gnocchi stayed together and weren't heavy at all. Served them with butter and fresh basil, delicious!

I have eaten these at the Zuni Cafe, and made them at home. They are luxurious, delicate pillows of pasta.
