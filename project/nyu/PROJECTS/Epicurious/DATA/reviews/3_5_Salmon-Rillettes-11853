Made this for a dinner party - totally not worth the time and effort - I followed the recipe exactly and 90% of it was left over after the party. Too bad I don't have a cat.

I made a half portion for this year's Christmas dinner. Dinner was for 9 adults and this recipe was one of several appetizers that graced the coffee table. I brought 1/2 of the amt. I made to the holiday gathering and kept the remainder for my house. It was a total hit with the family and will remain in my special occasion roster. After adding all the ingredients excepting the butter,I too felt a little something was lacking, so I added a tablespoon + 1 tsp of creme fraiche to the creamed butter.I imagine marscapone or sour cream could be substituted as well. Perfect!!! As is often the case with rillettes, pates, etc., it tastes better today than it did yesterday..which says a lot.

This was very yummy. I made a big batch and served it in endive spoons. The presentation was great and it was delicious.

Well, I served the fillets *whole* and *warm* (no chilling or flaking), and had a delicious and easy main dish! Other little alterations: Added veggie boullion and the extra lemon juice (leftover from 1 lemon) to the water before poaching. Sauteed the shallots in olive oil, and warmed up all the other non-salmon ingredients with the shallots. Served salmon fillets with the sauce on top. Wild rice and a dry white were perfect accompaniments.

No trouble with binding. Very nice flavor, guests all loved it. Will happily make again.

I have tried countless smoked salmon-based hors d'oeuvres recipes and always come back to this one. It looks very elegant in a large ramekin dish and is devoured every time. I never worry too much about all the measurements and ratios, but some things to consider: (1) the finer you chop the salmon, the easier it will be for your guests to spread on crackers; (2) if you skimp too much on the butter, it doesn't bind as well; (3) don't overcook the fresh salmon; (4) smoked salmon flavors can vary, so just adjust flavors at the end by adding a little more lemon juice, mustard, etc.; (5) the mixture spread on cocktail rounds with a sprig of parsley makes a great passed appetizer.

I followed the recipe pretty much as written and the flavor and texture was very good. How can it be bad with all my favorite ingredients:) My only complaint was that it did not bind together very well, which is probably why others put in a processor, though I think that would make it too much like a mousse.

Liked this a lot, but it needs more. The interesting thing is how bright the lemon flavor is here. I threw some chili powder in after tasting it. It sure needs something. Prep suggestions: use only half the butter called for; throw parsely, shallots, zest -- everything but the salmon and the lemon juice -- and chop well. Then throw in the smoked salmon and lemon juice. Process, but not too fine. Then combine in a bowl with the poached salmon and mix by hand. You could easily cut this recipe in half. It makes a big rillette.

I tried this recipe because I one liked the name and two I loved the ingredients. To me, 4 cups of anything is too much...so I halved the recipe. After doing that, the recipe did not come together in texture and in taste. I then added more butter, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, capers and brandy. I also added 1 large garlic, coarse salt and fresh ground pepper. I served it on a nice baguette and was pleased with the results. By itself I would have rated this a 2 forks and probably not worth doing again. Don't use a food processor...it is nice seeing the flecks of smoked salmon, caper and parsley.
