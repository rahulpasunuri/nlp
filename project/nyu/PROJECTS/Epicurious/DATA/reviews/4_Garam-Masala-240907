I was halfway through measuring out little bags of the ingredients when I noticed the pre-mixed garam masala in the jar on the top shelf in the grocery store spice section. I took it down and found it was empty, so my efforts on the ingredient front were not wasted. What I just whirred up at home in the spice grinder smells so much better than the remnants in that container! Cheap to make - less than $2 for all of the spices (bought in bulk) - quick, and worth it. I use this for the easy chicken masala recipe on this site.

Garam Masala is very inexpensive to buy, but it's flavor is enhanced with this recipe. Once you make your own Masala, you'll never buy again.
