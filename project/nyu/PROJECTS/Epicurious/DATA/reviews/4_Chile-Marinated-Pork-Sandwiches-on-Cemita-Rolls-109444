Delicious! We avoid gluten so I turned it into a salad. Made pork chops as directed, but sliced them when done frying. Put onto a bed of mixed greens w/added cabbage shreds & spinach. Used the avocado, tomato & onion as added salad ingredients. Found a sour cream and cilantro dressing to use from this site. This does make a lot of chili paste, but it's good so I'll freeze it to use down the road.

Fantastic. Husband loved it, and he is a real sandwich lover/critic. I used scallions instead of onion and omitted the chipotles. This one's a keeper

I really enjoyed this sandwich and it wasn't hard to make, despite the lengthy instructions... My husband said I could serve these to him every month, which made me feel great. His next statement made me wonder though: he said it tasted like a McRib sandwich. Hhhhm. Not exactly in the business of trying to recreate McDonalds cuisine at home. Never personally tasted a McRib either, so I can't validate this comment. McDonalds comment withstanding, this was really good.

careful, the guajillo can be rather warm.

I thought this dish was awesome, the marinade is one of the best things that has ever come out of this magazine, I am saving it to use as a sauce, a dip, almost anything! It adds wonderful, bold, flavor and you cannot beat mixing it with the avocado spread.

Could not find "cemita rolls" but a fresh panaderia roll works great. This sandwich is bursting with flavor with every bite. Every ingredient comes together for one big fiesta in your mouth. One hint, soak the onions in cold water first to tame them. Bravo to the Pueblanos!
