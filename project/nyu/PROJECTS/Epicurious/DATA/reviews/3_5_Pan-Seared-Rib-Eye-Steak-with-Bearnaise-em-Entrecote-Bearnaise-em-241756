I checked this solely for the Bearnaise recipe. I have been making this from the same old recipe for probably 40 years or more, but just wanted to see what else was out there. I haven't followed my JofC recipe and have not use chervil in it so I do nor have that basis of comparison. With all of that said - this is fantastic. Very easy to make and fabulous for my beef fondue party yesterday. People were even spreading it on their bread. A note to anyone new to preparing Hollandaise or Bernaise. A double boiler is NOT required. If you combine your acid and egg yolks in a small heavy sauce pan and then had your COLD butter about 1/2 tablespoon at a time stirring constantly until all the butter is melted you will have a perfect sauce with no curdling. Because of all the comments I have seen, I will try adding the chervil next time. Until then, I highly recommend this recipe.

Outstanding! Doubled the recipe & added a half pound of fresh lump crab meat. Served over rare grilled beef filets with grilled asparagus on the side. My husband is still raving about this dinner!

I have made this many times now, and for the ease and small time commitment required, it is an excellent dish. I've never actually used shoestring fries -- always traditional frites (twice cooked in peanut oil). Anyway, the focus of the recipe is the bearnaise, which I had never attempted before because I had believed it to be so daunting. This is a simple recipe that has worked every time and is delicious. I don't understand some of the complaints that it is too lemony, when the recipe calls for "1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice or to taste."

The sauce was a little too lemony, but overall tasty.

Used only the bearnaise recipe because it looked quick and easy--which it is. Clearly there is lack of depth because chervil, and bits of thyme & bay leaf are missing in the reduction process. Adding these punches it up a bit (although subtly) and makes for a fine sauce. Mixing in a tblsp of chopped tarragon AND chervil at the end is essential as well as authentic. (cf. Larousse Gastronomique, p. 78)

I was very excited to try this at first...but it was too much work for something that didn't work out correctly. The lack of liquid like the previous reviewer said, didn't help. It was a waste of our time.

Very good recipe to celebrate this all time classic and favorite! We substituted vermouth for the dry wine initially and then added an additional 1/4 cup of a good white wine after the initial boiling down to get a good enough amount of liquid. We also used dry tarragon and used half the amount.

This was a good, but to me, not great, bearnaise. It came out nicely. However, it lacked a depth of flavor I wanted for some reason. I used an offdry wine, not sure if that was the reason, but it was a tasty wine. Also, I used a gourmet wine vinegar, which is less acidic, so maybe a cheaper, more tangy version would work better. It also had a tad too much lemon flavor, so I would add a touch less next time. It was good, but not quite what I remembered bearnaise tasting like, it that makes sense.

We really enjoyed this recipe which produced by far the best bearnaise I've every had. Start with a good cut of steak and season lightly, so that the flavor of the meat really shines through. As far as the bearnaise, we also didn't use all the butter and substituted additional milk. It still came out wonderful.

While shoestring fries are great in there own right. They are not "frites" or belgian fries. which are regular sized fries but cooked twice. Once at a lower temp. to cook and then laid out to cool before cooking again at a high temp. to brown. Resulting in fries that are soft inside and crisp on the outside... try them both, either one is great with a good steak...

This was a fun treat. The bearnaise was quite simple to make and was delicious with the skinny frites. I wouldn't make this frequently, but it's definitely a fun treat.

The bearnaise was easy to make and delicious ... and certainly decadent with the steak. I cut this recipe in half for two people. Whisked together two egg yolks and did not use it all in an effort to measure out 1.5 eggs. Did not use all the butter, either. The ingredient meassurements for bearnaise are quite forgiving. Did not serve with french fries as that would been just tooooo over the top.
