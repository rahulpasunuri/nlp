The first time I made this it was fantastic--a hit with everyone. The second time as I cooked the sauce, it turned green. I can't imagine what happened. When One reviewer said maybe an aluminum pan was the cause, it sounded plausible, but I cooked it a larger version of the same pan. Everything else was the same except I ran out of the wine I used last time except for a little bit, so I used that plus a second wine I added. And I didn't keep it at a boil, I turned the heat down to low while I did something else. Any chemists out there? I would love to make this for company but I'm scared I'll get stuck at the last minute.

We live in Panama and got some fresh langostinos - they look like jumbo shrimp, but have the taste and texture more similar to lobster. Recipe was excellent. Cooked the langostinos in pan with just Pam cause the sauce is so rich and worked really well. Added some diced fresh tomato to the sauce at the end and some freshly grated parmesan. Yummy!

Excellent! Use good white wine. I thought this was delicious (and super easy) and I forwarded the recipe to all my girlfriends.

Cut both the butter and the vinegar in half. Recipe was delicious!! Made a big hit - served it over thin spaghetti. A little buttery still for my waistline, but very good.

This is a good start on a recipe. I cut the vinegar back and wish I cut the lemon back a little bit as well. But, this is very good and I think it can be better. I omitted the chives, as I made this on the fly in January. I gave it four stars more for what it can be, rather than the recipe as written.

This was very very good - a little overwhelming but that may be because we tried to eat too many shrimp... I feel the sauce could be used for fish as well. What's nice is that it's super fast - Yum.

LOVED this one...flavors are wonderful and intense. have had several people ask me for this recipe.

This recipe was easy. It tasted a bit too much like vinegar, will probably use less next time. Tasted good over Jasmine Rice and Shrimp.

I've made this twice now, and I think it's great. The only mods are adding parsley to the wine/vinegar/garlic mix at the beginning, and cutting back on the butter. I sauted the shrimp using some of the sauce, then added everything to angel hair pasta. Great weeknight meal.

Too much vinegar. Nothing special about this.

Rating: 3
I thought this dish was delicious. I let the wine reduce for a minute or two before adding the garlic. Then since my daughter-in-law wanted shrimp scampi, I sauteed the shrimp, a bit less, poured the sauce over, then topped with parsley and bread crumbs then put under the broiler. I saved a bit of the sauce to toss with linguini. Delicious. We'll make agian. It was a hit in our house with everyone but the 1 yr old grandson.

This was by far the worst lemon-garlic butter I have ever tasted. Glad I did not try it with company because it was almost unedible.

Just like one of the other cooks, my garlic turned an awful blue green color, and the sauce flavor was awful. I am a good cook, and this is the first recipe that seemed easy , and came out awful. It is also the first that was not even edible.

Loved this recipe and will definitely make this again. Reduced the butter in the sauce and added a little olive oil. No fresh chives and forgot the lemon peel - still spectacular! Served over linguini with a crusty bread.

The kids and husband inhaled the shrimp. Served over simple white rice. Did reduce the butter as suggested. Didn't have fresh lemons (I'm embarrassed), and the recipe was still yummy. I used tail-on shelled frozen shrimp. Fresh ingredients could only make it better.

The sauce had a bitter taste from the garlic; and this is coming from a garlic lover! I tried adding cream as others have recommended, but it didn't help. Next time I might saute the garlic a bit first, before adding it to the sauce.

I used scallops for this, really outstanding.

Rating: 4
Really simple and really delicious! If you have shell-on shrimp, that would be ideal; the bigger the better! I would highly recommend sprinkling in some red pepper flakes for an extra kick, either in the butter sauce or in the saute pan, or both. I used a garlic press for my mincing, but will try thin slices next time to cut back on the garlic a bit. Saute for a bit less than 3 minutes, as pouring the warm butter sauce over the shrimp will finish cooking them.

Rating: 3
This was quite good. I made it exactly as listed and liked it, but didn't have enough sauce to cover all the rice I served with it. I then made it again and added olive oil, along with the butter to lower the fat content and still give more sauce. My husband liked it better the 2nd time and I can't decide.

I think this is one of the most delicious shrimp recipes' on epicurious! The only thing I added was more garlic, more shrimp, and SHALLOTS. I separately added diced tomatoes and blanched white asparagas tips. All served over white rice. I've made it a few times now and will continue to make it, adding different things. Delicious!!!!!

This was wonderful. My mom is on a high protein diet so I served it with wilted spinich. However, next time I make it, I am going to increase the sauce and serve it over pasta.

Excellent! I added a little cayenne with the salt and pepper to the garlic butter sauce. Next time, I think I will add some red pepper flakes while cooking the shrimp. But, I like things spicy. I halved this recipe and it worked wonderfully. My wife loved it!

This is the easiest and most delicious shrimp dish I've made. My five year old loves it and so does the rest of the family. It tastes quite impressive for company too. I use red wine vinegar, because that's all I have, it tastes the same. I like to serve it over Spanish Yellow Rice.

My family loved this recipe. It was delicious and made the house smell great. We didn't have fresh lemons, so I substituted with lime. I also added the cream as recommended by others. We had a red pepper, so I sliced it thin, sauteed it before the shrimp then added it back at the end. I recommend it!

Really liked this recipe. Especially the ease. Used only 1/2 stick of butter and was plenty.

Rating: 3
Really good. Really garlicky. Added some cream (5%) as suggested and only used 1 Tbsp of lemon juice. It still has a nice lemon flavour. I put it in a serving dish in the middle of the table so we could dip our french bread in the sauce. Served with a green salad.

THIS IS A KEEPER, JUST LOVED IT. I BLANCHED BROCCOLI AND PUT ASIDE TILL SAUCE WAS DONE. ADDED RED PEPPER FLAKES TO PAN WHEN SAUTEING SHRIMP,ADDED ANGEL HAIR PASTA TO THE SHRIMP AND THE BLANCHED BROCCOLI THEN THE SAUCE AND THEN A CUP OF HALF AND HALF AND HEATED THRU AND THICKENED UP. CAN'T WAIT TO MAKE IT AGAIN.EASY AND FAST RECIPE AND OH SOOOO GOOD.

Did add the cream as others have suggested and it turned out great--have made this twice in the past month and was a hit both times..

Yum - added the 1 cup of cream during the reduction as suggested - ooh the calories! I blanched broccoli and then sauted it with the shrimp ( added a little Cayenne to the oil) tossed the whole thing with angel hair pasta and then poured the sauce over all -- yikes it was good!

I did not find this dish spectacular at all. Used shrimp and angel hair pasta with grilled asparagus and roasted red bell pepper. Thought the sauce was nothing special. It did taste better the next day, though.

Rating: 3
My family loved this recipe! (except my picky daughter who didn't like the appearance of the chives) The lemon zest really adds an unexpected delicious 'spark' to the dish. Although, I think I will try the suggestion to add cream after the reduction which will help stretch the recipe if eaten with rice.

I made this dish in a matter of minutes. I sprinkled a little paprika for color. This was fabulous. Next time I will try it with pasta again and again. The asparagus idea sounds good too. MMM....

Rating: 4
Made this with a slight variation- added 1 cup of cream after the wine reduction. Then reduced the cream/wine till about 1/3 cup. Then I added the butter pieces. Really great!!! Very creamy and rich- went well with pasta and asparagus! Plus, the sauce held much better over a couple of hours than a straight butter sauce! We will make this again just this way!!!

My family definitely enjoyed this recipie. I served it with fettucini lightly drizzled with olive oil. Easy to make, too.

I added a pinch of red pepper flakes to the shrimp while sauteeing. I also substituted fresh cilantro for the chives and served it over angel hair. Even my persnickety husband loved this dish!

I'm planning to make this for dinner - can't believe we won't like it - so I'll rate later. But while I'm thinking of it, perhaps the cook whose sauce turned blue-green used an aluminum pan. I remember going to one of those in-home cookware demonstrations where the salesman put an acidic liquid in aluminum and after heating the sauce looked awful! Cheap sales trick. I'd say try again in the pan you used the first time and see what happens.

I loved this recipe!! It took me awhile to get everything together and when I did, EVERYTHING turned our so well. My indifferent dad REALLY enjoyed this recipe. I lost the recipe and had to search Epicurious again to get it. Is really good over rice and could be served with scallops instead of shrimp.

I made this dish for my Fiancee and he and I raved about it for days! I served the shrimp and sauce over angel hair pasta. Loved the lightness of the pasta with the shrimp and sauce. I will definatly make this again for him (and me!)

I've made this recipe once, with great success, and it was really delicious. However, I when I made it again some time later, the sauce turned blue-green and I can't figure out why. I threw it out and started all over again, only to see the same thing happening. I used the exact same ingredients that the recipe called for, but I crushed the garlic in a press rather than chop it. The second time I did it, after the first disaster, I used cider vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar, I used a different white wine and I lowered the heat a little, but again, the sauce turned an awful blue-green. What am I doing wrong???

Rating: 3
The sauce is very tasty. I'm sure that it would also work for scallops or grilled fish. I thought that the amount of butter was fine-it is needed to balance out all of the acidic ingredients. I also halved the recipe without difficulty. I would definitely make this again. It was very easy. Serve over rice.

Heavy on the garlic but my husband and my two year-old loved it. I served it over linguini instead of rice and it was delicious. A very quick and easy meal. Perfect for the middle of the week when you're feeling rushed, tired & sick of the same old meals.

I can't believe how easy this was to make...or maybe I'm getting more coordinated with age! I made this for the first time for Christmas brunch. Everyone was happily surprised with the results! I served it as a side dish and it was more than enough for five. I will definately make it again!

This was very, very good. To save me time, I let the butter soften while I prepared the rest of my dinner, then at the appropriate time, put the whole thing in the sauce pan with the lemon juice, covered, and took off the heat. Then I sauteed the shrimp in another pan. Wala! Dinner was served! I would double the wine-butter-lemon juice sauce next time. There wasn't enough for seconds otherwise!
