Even better when coconut milk is used rather than milk. Also substituted red thai curry paste for the crushed red pepper to deepen the flavor. Added a little fish sauce and garnished with cilantro and a squeeze of lime. Yummy!!!

I love this soup exactly as written. I also like it with a little coconut milk. What drives me absolutely bonkers are reviews like the previous review. This reviewer said that they made it as written, but used roasted carrots, added cilantro and peanuts and left out the sesame oil. That is now a different soup. Please review the recipes as they are and then make alternative suggestions. You can{t review something and give it forks if you haven{t even really tried it!!!

This soup was good but not great and might be better the second day. I followed the recipe as written except used previously roasted carrots which provided a nice rich flavor. Also garnished with chopped cilantro and chopped peanuts. Would have added chopped scallions if I had any on hand. Didn't have the sesame oil but then I am not a fan of that anyway. I had to thin out the soup with more chicken stock as it was more like a puree at first. And added the lime juice as suggested by other readers which increased the kick and brought out the flavor of the cilantro. My husband liked it, so that is why it received three forks instead of two.

I make soups all the time and this one did not appeal to me at all!

Rating: 4
Very tasty as written, though I think my one modification in preparation takes it beyond. I find pureeing the ginger with the soup makes for an unpleasant, stringy texture. Instead, I peel the ginger and smash it using the flat of my knife (as you would garlic). I add this to the simmering ingredients and then fish it out before pureeing. This makes the texture velvety smooth. Also, subbing all or some of the milk with canned coconut milk is quite good, and I've always got half a can hanging around the fridge.

Easy to make. But not easy to eat as it tasted awful. (Apologies for being less than diplomatic!).

Rating: 4
Excellent! Easy to make plus perfect for making 1-2 days ahead. A simple reheat is all that is required. The subtle taste of soy sauce and peanut butter give it a different twist on basic carrot soup that keeps guests guessing. Have made it several times--always to rave reviews.

Mmmm!!! This was amazing. Increased the amount of ginger, added 1 T of coriander, and instead of the milk I pureed in a block of Mori-Nu soft lowfat tofu, to make it creamy. The recipe rocks! I served alongside green curry shitakes and seared wasabi tuna. The sweetness of this soup paired wonderfully with the other flavors.

I can't get enough of this soup. I first made it to bring to a friend who just had twins, and I've made it several times since. I use the garlic broth recipe on this site instead of the chicken broth (I'm a vegetarian). I've had to add more broth to this soup to thin it out (my puree is always really thick). The taste is outrageous!

Scrumpious!! Hands down one of the best soups I have ever made - kids loved it, too. (Coconut milk, not cow's milk, makes this soup ROCK! Seems more Thai than Szechwan this way, though.)

Yum, yum, yum! This is a great soup, esp. w/ large homemade croutons (drizzled w/ butter, garlic, chipotle powder) floating on top. This is the perfect way to get my kids (age 2 & 5) to eat LOTS of carrots; they love the flavors that blend together quite well, and the color is, well, hometown-lovely burnt orange...go Horns!

After seeing the ratings, reviews and list of ingredients, I couldn't wait to try this soup. Made it last night, followed the recipe as given, but cut in half. It smelled delicious while cooking. Looked beautiful in the bowl. But after tasting it, my husband looked at me and said, 'you _like_ this?' I had to say no. The flavors just didn't go together, at least not for us. Tasted like a sweetish pumpkin soup with a hint of peanut butter. Ended up throwing most of it out. Very disappointing.

I was trying to duplicate a recipe for Thai Carrot Soup we'd had in a local restaurant, and this is as good if not better! I substituted a can of coconut milk for the regular milk, and everybody went nuts over it. My new favorite recipe!

Having just fallen on the sofa after dinner AND following a late autum harvest of the last of our own carrots I must say.... Do try this one. It is decidedly delicious. It actually tastes very south-east asian to me, which is an interesting mix with carrots! I added a few potatoes and only used sesame oil. The Veridict - My daughter says "be-e-you-tiful!" My teenage son comes home from next door just to eat dinner (said he loved the smell of it cooking!), and hubby is glad its my turn to cook! Try it, you'll love it, Oh, and it's Bloody easy too!

I didn't have sesame oil, so substituted olive oil (recipe calls for only 1 teaspoon), which may account for less than stellar flavor. It was easy to make, and I'll try it again with sesame oil.

This soup is fantastic and flexible. I had too few carrots so used half buttternut squash. Delicious. Also had some tofu in the fridge so sliced some into the bottom of my bowl.. mmm creamy chunky tofu. Sliced scallions on top. Fabulous. DO NOT SKIP the lime juice add on. Brings freshness. Will make again and again.

i was excited to try this soup after all the great reviews, but was disappointed in the result. it's tasty, but tastes like sauce, not soup. i'll enjoy it after it's thoroughly tweaked with noodles, shrimp, mint, or a number of other variations, but as a stand-alone experience i find it underwhelming.

I first made and reviewed this incredible soup way back in Sept/02. It has since become a family favourite and I have also received many kudos from guests/company - everyone wants the recipe! To the changes I noted in that review, the only thing I have added is the juice and zest from 1 small lime - adds another dimesion of freshness/brightness that enhances the other flavours. I make soup at least once a week and this recipe is a two-thumbs-up winner. It is an outstanding way to eat carrots and truly deserves a 4 fork rating! To not make it would be a sin!

This soup is wonderful! I did not have celery on hand, so that was the only change to recipe. Used an immersion blender and could not believe how creamy this is!

I served this soup at a Thanksgiving ham dinner for my sister and mother. Oh, wow, it is so good! I had made it the day before, but wasn't sure how it would be reheated. It reheats beautifully except the bite from the red pepper flakes seemed to have disappeared completely. I added a few more flakes and it was perfection again. I added only a half cup of milk because I like thick soups. Next time (and there will be a next time) I might not add any milk at all. I did not garnish it with sour cream, but used a little chopped parsley on top, more for looks than anything. I really, really, really like this soup.

Wow,great flavor combo!Amazing how much flavor such a small amount of peanut butter adds. I had a cup of coconut milk in the fridge so used instead of regular milk. Soup was extra creamy. The only thing that didn't make sense to me was the sour cream garnish, so I garnished with chopped cilantro instead.

Rating: 4
This recipe has been like a curse--I made it once and now my guests have been demanding the recipe or seconds, or soup to take home. I think I made four recipes worth in 10 days time. I used Adams peanut butter, added a few tablespoons of half & half (since I used skim milk), and generally don't tell guests that it is carrot soup--the flavors blend so well that it is hard to pick out any one ingredient. It tastes as rich as many carrot soup recipes that contain lots of cream.

Rating: 4
I agree....do not omit the peanut butter and sesame oil. These flavours combined with the rest of the ingredients are what make this soup so wonderful. I used about 2 lbs carrots, 5 cups of broth and lite soy sauce. I also sprinkled with black sesame seeds for garnish.

AH!!! This is by far the best carrot soup I've ever had, and I, as a general rule, hate carrot soup. DO NOT omit the peanut butter!!! It's half the point of this recipe.

I made this soup for a Mystery dinner party with friends. They had a difficult time identifying all the ingredients but just loved the soup. For my own taste, I thought the peanut butter was a bit too obvious and will cut it down a bit next time.The good thing was , it was so very easy to make and pureed up in the blender beautifully. A winner in my books.

Outstanding soup!!! What a great way to eat carrots! I increased carrots to 2lbs, increased by one half all other ingredients with these exceptions: 3 cloves garlic, 1"piece ginger, 1/4 tsp pepper flakes, 1 tbsp sesame oil, but kept the soy sauce/peanut butter at 1-1/2 tbsp each. Garnished with sour cream and minced cilantro. Don't be fooled by the deceptively simple ingredients - there is more than enough heat/kick in this soup! The previous reviewer was correct: there is no definite carrot taste, but instead a complex/bold blend of flavours enhance the carrots. Would make a perfect starter for an Asian dinner party - gorgeous colour/silky texture. Not for those who prefer a much more subtle and delicately flavoured carrot soup. Big, bold, beautiful taste makes you sit up and take notice!!! You were right San Fran: it is almost impossible to describe perfection, so that means the rest of you will just have to make this soup and find out for yourselves! Bravo Epicurious!

Rating: 2
Tasted good and surprisingly rich (even though I used skim milk), but be aware that the dominant flavors are sesame and peanut butter and soy sauce, rather than carrot. And yes, it does look like baby food. Since it's a little on the salty side, I would recommend using only 1T of soy sauce. I'd recommend more carrots too.

This soup is SO yummy!! I couldn't stop eating it. I didn't add any milk, but I like my food lighter. The peanut butter flavor was awesome....I almost wanted to add more, but I think that might have thrown off the balance of flavors.

I have to agree with the limited negative reviews for this recipe. I thought the sesame oil overpowered the flavors.

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband loved it. I would prefer a thinner soup and so next time will add more broth and/or half & half (instead of milk). Overall, it has a very complex taste - there are a lot of flavors going on at once - and the spice kind of hits the back of your mouth with each bite. Very good and really easy. I served it w/ chicken and veg potstickers and had a simple Asian dinner. Will make again.

Excellent soup! Somewhat spicy (adjustable according to preference) with delicious flavors. I served this with a dollop of peanut-butter on top with some sliced scallions. I also used cream - hey, it's the holidays. I think you could use evaporated milk that would make it creamy but not too high in fat. This was easy to make, too. I will definitely make this again.

I made this soup because of the peanut butter. My husband and I LOVED it! I left out the celery - just because I didn't have any. I also found that I liked the soup strained - this way you don't bite on little pieces of ginger which overpours the overall taste of the soup. Only when making this soup for guests do I add the garnish. It makes a beautiful presentation. This is a definite keeper.

I would definitely make this soup again. All the elements are very well-balanced. It's so rich that I felt the sour cream and heavy cream garnish wasn't necessary, however, so I chopped a few fresh coriander leaves to sprinkle on top. They complemented the Asian flavours beautifully.

On my first taste of this, I was like, Hmmm. It looked a little like baby food. I added a little salt. By my third taste I was like, Mmmm! It's very good and rich, should really be served as an appetizer soup and not the main course. in autumn. I made it spicier and only used 2/3 cup of milk; also used baby carrots. It looks prettier in the bowl than it did in the blender, especially with garnishes. To the chef who lightened it: There's not really any need-- there are only about 100 calories per bowl.

WOW! Tasty and low calorie and easy. I used one of those in the bowl puree sticks and it even pureed the fresh ginger bits. The 1.5 Tbs. of peanut butter was definitly noticable. Great paired w/ Chinese chicken salad or a light sandwich.

I made this soup for the first time a few months ago. My boyfiend and I LOVED it and I have made it several times since! It is easy to whip up and just deliciou. I have played around with it and substituted butternut squash or sweet potatoes for the carrots...both are excellent!

This was a nice soup recipe. I would use a little less soy sauce and sesame oil to give it a lighter taste next time. I also used fennel because I didn't have celery. I have a better, easier recipe for carrot soup, but it's nice to have a change. I would think you could skip the milk if you were lactose intolerant.

Absolutely fab! This is such a simple recipe and yet, it produces a marvelous soup. The flavour is rich and the texture is creamy. A wonderful blend of savory and sweet. Also, it's one of those recipes that doesn't require much by way of shopping. I added extra red pepper flakes because I like things hot. And, to keep it low on fat, I used skimmed milk and 25% fat reduced peanut butter. Tasted FANTASTIC and very, very rich.

This is a wonderful soup. I did double the soy sauce and asian sesame oil. A note to the Cook from Wheaton - if you're looking for something that doesn't overpower the delicate flavors of carrots and celery - don't try anything that refers to Szechwan again - you'll always get big, bold flavors. Sometimes nice carrots and celery are just a base for something bigger. Live a little!

Undistinguished. The strong flavours of red pepper, soy sauce, and especially peanut butter overwhelm the gentle aromatics of carrot and celery. After checking out of the fridge tomorrow morning, it's 'bon voyage' and off to the composter it goes.
