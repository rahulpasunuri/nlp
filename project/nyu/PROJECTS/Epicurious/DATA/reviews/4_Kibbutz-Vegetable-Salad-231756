I live in Israel and this is THE salad, chopped and served fresh with almost every meal - and you never get tired of it! However, three forks because of the unnecessary addition to a great recipe. Here is the "regular" version, loved and cherished by all, from fancy restaurants to falafel stands to home dinners: 2 tomatoes, 2 cucumbers, 1 small onion, 1 TBS olive oil, 1 TBS freshly squeezed lemon juice and salt & pepper to taste (I like freshly ground 4-color peppercorns). Do NOT let this salad sit for even ten minutes. To make ahead, cut veggies ahead, but season just before serving.

So, I used at least twice as much cucumber as was called for and didn't use the garlic or sumac. This is such a go-to salad for our house. It tastes fresh and the ingredients are always available. Yum!

This is a staple in my house. It's delicious, filling, nutritious, and low calorie. I recently stayed at a hotel where it was out on the breakfast buffet, and you could see the fittest people swarming around it. It ought to have a whole diet built around it. This is a very good version (I've made it red wine vinegar instead of lemon juice for variety, but the lemon juice version tastes "truer"). I especially like it with fresh chopped dill (having some right now) or mint, or lots of parsley. I occasionally add raw chopped zucchini, which is great if very fresh. (The first time I had this salad--on kibbutz--pretty much everything had just been picked.) Grape tomatoes are excellent in this salad.

Always a hit. Also great when chopped green olives are added and/or feta and/or radishes.

I have not tried this recipe, but being Turkish, it caught my attention and I just wanted to add a few comments. The recipe reminds me of two different Turkish salads. One is the simpler and much more common version (called the "shepherds' salad" for its simplicity), made of only tomatoes, cucumber, onion, green peppers, salt, lemon and optional herbs (parsley and mint are the most common ones). The vegetables are cut in bigger chnks in this version. The other is pretty close to the recipe, being a salad specific to the southeast of Turkey. I guess it should be related to gazpacho also, for it has similar ingredients, which are chopped into very small pieces, giving the salad an almost liquid texture. In addition to the ingredients in the recipe, this version has walnuts and lemon juice is replaced by pomegranate molasses. Pomegranate molasses add a slightly sweet taste which goes very nice with the rest of the ingredients, but for a sharper taste, you could mix it half and half with lemon juice. Zaatar is not used in the Turkish version, but sounds like a very good idea and I will definitely give it a try the next time I make this salad.

As stated, this dish is a staple of Middle Easter Cuisine. Mixed with a little set yogurt it can be a variation on Tzatziki. I remember eating this in a Palestinian Restaurant as part of a "Mezza".
