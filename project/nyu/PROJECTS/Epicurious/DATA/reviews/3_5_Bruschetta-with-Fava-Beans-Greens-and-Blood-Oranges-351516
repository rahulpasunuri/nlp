I made this with canned fava beans, and it was terrible (my boyfriend smell-checked the puree for me but wouldn't taste it; it smelled like stomach acid). I ended up throwing it out and making an improvised puree with some chickpeas I had in the cupboard. Perhaps using fresh or frozen beans is key.

This was delicious and a hit at our party! And it's very healthy. Frozen fava beans are hard to find - I ended up getting fresh and peeling them, which wasn't too hard at all. I learned that fava beans are also called broad beans and if I'd known that at the store, frozen broad beans are also in Asian food sections. Also, the recipe did not mention cutting the orange segments and salad pieces, if large, and I suggest doing this to make it fit better on small pieces of toasted baguette. I'll definitely make this again!

these were a colorful and elegant seasonal appetizer that i was able to have sitting ready for guests arriving for a springtime dinner party. shelling fresh fava beans proved a time-intensive task, but worth the taste. i would definitely make again.
