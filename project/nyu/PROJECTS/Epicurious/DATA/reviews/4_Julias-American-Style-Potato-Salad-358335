We really like this salad. So I made it again but with the bacon. I will not do that ever again. The bacon did not retain any crispiness, became limp & chewy and did not add anything to the dish. Just leave it out.

I also had trouble getting the potatoes to absorb the liquid. I assumed the potatoes were not done. So I separated the potatoes from the liquid and put the potatoes in the microwave on high for about 5 min. The potatoes were much more done and absorbed the liqued nicely.

LOVE this potato salad. Of course, Julia knew what she was doing! This has quickly become my favorite classic potluck dish, and I have made six times in the last month. I don't change a thing, except that I sub half sour cream with half mayo.

Very yummy! I used greek yogurt and omitted the bacon.

I love Julia and I love potato salad but I didn't love this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly and thought it was just okay. I much prefer the recipe in Fine Cooking magazine. It also marinates the potatoes which is the key trick.

That Julia! She knows a thing or two about potato salad. I was going to make my standard mustard potato salad but decided to try something different but still traditional. This recipe is delicious. Omitted the bacon as one of the guests is muslim but next time I make this salad will definitely included bacon.

A fabulous "old-fashioned" American Potato Salad... serves and satisfies the masses... thank you, Julia!

Great simple recipe. I made a big batch for lunches all week and it was perfect. I used chicken stock rather than cooking water. The potatoes MUST be just cooked thorough so try to slice them all the same width.

The one time I had a bit of the potato water (actually, I used chicken broth) not absorbed (~1 TBSP) was when I used Yukon Gold potatoes. When I've used waxy red potatoes, every bit of the chicken broth was soaked up. I like to microwave the potatoes whole, not boil them, in order to retain more of the nutrients. I cut them after they've cooled for 10 minutes, covered loosely with the bag I used to microwave them.

I shouldnt try and type on my side on the couch...regarding the previous post..I WAITED 20 min instead of 10 hoping the water would absorb ( what I was trying to say ) butthe liquid never was absorbed.

Okay..after reading all the reviews, I must say that it was pretty good ! My question is this ... did anyone have a problem with the potato water not being soaked in after boiling ? I folloed the recipe EXACTLY but the potatoes didnt absorb the water..I even water 20 min. and ended up straining the excess..now, I wonder, if it was because I dont think my potatoes were cook quite enough ( I was so worried about over cooking them I KNOW I under cooked them ) Just curious ... I will try it again

Great recipe! For alower fat, less cholesterol, version, I substitute 1/2 of the mayo with 0% fat Fage Greek yogurt. This yogurt is extremely light, yet not runny. [No I don't work for them, they simply make the best product sold locally. 0mg cholesterol, 9g carbs.]

I may have made more potato salad this week than in my entire life. I agree with the cook from Malibu. Potato salad in general needs lots of salt and pepper. It may have a bite when first made, but it mellows over night. I have followed the directions closely and used at least 1 teaspoon each salt and white pepper. This time I used some lemon juice in place of the vinegar, and I am using sweet pickle relish from Trader Joe's (NO CORN SYRUP). This is my potato salad recipe from now on!!!

I picked this recipe because it was closest to the recipe my mother used to make, and it turned out very well. I used rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar, and I added some sweet pickle juice and a little bit of dry mustard into the mayonnaise, but other than that, I kept pretty close to this recipe. My guests loved it!

I don't much care for potato salad, but my husband and son asked for this side for our 4th of July celebration. I just finished making it. So delicious! Hard to stop eating, and our BBQ isn't ready yet. I followed the recipe exactly, but I forgot to cook the potatoes al dente. Still incredibly yummy! Julia Child really knew how to cook, the perfect blend of ingredients, deletectable flavor. I don't normally eat bacon, but those little crumbs are a nice crunch and flavor sensation. BTW, I used 1 1/4 tsp salt & 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper. A definite keeper, and a regular for the 4th!!!

I have tried every mayo-based potato salad recipe I've come across, and this one is the best. My search is over. I used dill pickles, the water, and a mix of mayo and sour cream. I'm sure I'll experiment with the recipe, but I'm not sure I can improve on it.

This may be the best potato salad I have ever made. I followed the recipe except for the eggs. Although I like eggs, I just don't care to mix eggs with potato salad. I used extra celery and lots of fresh chives. I used 1/2 dill relish and 1/2 sweet relish. I used an entire teaspoon each of the white pepper and salt. I have learned that potato salad needs adequate salt. I also used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 low fat sour cream. Now it will sit in the frig overnight for a backyard BBQ tomorrow, but I am having a difficult time not eating it now.

generally i'm ambivalent about potato salads, but julia's is worth it, every time. she was a scientist-chef nonpareil, and her exacting, intentional almost lab methodology in the kitchen results in a potato salad of subtle differences in taste and texture that's a delight. my sister-in-law and i just made this again tonight, and hours after dinner is over, we keep sneaking back to the fridge to spoon another mouthful out of the tupperware. mmm. mealy, bland salads need not apply

Typical Julia child recipe-- perfectly balanced. I used chicken stock instead of the cooking water-- it has more flavor. I used baby yukon golds (didn't bother peeling. just sliced them) and bread & butter pickles and used probably 4-5 Tbsp. rather than 2-3. I also did use some sour cream with the mayo, as she suggests. One tip-- taste this once the flavors have had a chance to marry, and then add what you think is needed. American potato salad isn't my favorite, but this one is tasty, and the others at the BBQ raved about it.

I love this potato salad technique! I leave out the bacon, but it would be even better with it.

Absolutely my favorite potato salad! It's even great without the bacon and hard boiled egg, although I like them too. I use the chicken stock, not the potato water.

The most important part of this recipe is the vinegar and broth/water step. Any other way I've made potato salad without that step turned out 'meh'. Extra I added: slivers of radish, shredded carrot, minced raw onion, plus a lil chopped onion in the water when I boiled the potatoes, diced apple and a squeeze of Gulden's spicy brown mustard. Excellent!

I added some sweet red pepper (cut into small cubes). Very good and not very complicated to make -- just a lot of chopping

Awesome! Just like my grandmother used to make. The only modification I made was to use 1/3 cup of shallot instead of 2/3 cup of onion.

OK...but way too much work for just ok. i was expecting more from julia child!

Excellent! The only caution note I would make is that after reading multiple potato salad recipes, I noted that the amount of onion is on the high side, so just be careful to scale down to your taste if necessary.

I must agree with others that this is the best potato salad ever! I followed as written except that I was out of onions, so increased the amount of scallions to a full bunch. Delicious!

FABULOUS! I made 10 lbs of it for a party, and it was gone by the end of the day. Followed the recipe exactly. Time consuming, but oh my gosh it was good.

This is the best-tasting potato salad ever. It may seem old-fashioned or "standard," but, it's nothing like those mushy, bland potato salads you get in most stores. Every time I make it, it's a huge hit with everyone. Follow the recipe exactly and you won't be disappointed. I make this with Hellman's mayo, but, if you want it to taste even better, try it with your own homemade mayo, it's amazing!

Oh, Julia, you would be so proud of me. I followed the recipe exactly as written & it was xlnt! Made it for my 4th of July party to accompany 4 forker ribs. My guests loved it. Suggest you sprinkle some paprika on top for color & add a sprig of parsley.

Delicious! Not bland at all. The vinegar gave it the right amount of zing, but I'd consider adding some Coleman's dried mustard next time. I had only dill pickles on hand, and I think the recipe would taste better with sweet pickles.

Rating: 3
I think I missed something here, this seemed just a teeny bit bland to me. I think I'd add more vinegar, more bacon and more egg next time around as well as a touch of mustard to give it a little zing. It was definitely tasty, but not the best I've ever had. Great recipe to work with though!

This is literally the best potato salad I have ever tried. It has all of the traditional elements, but I think the vinegar really brightens the flavors of the entire salad. Definitely will be my go to potato salad recipe. Of course it's good....it's Julia Child!

A classic, very good potato salad. I left out the hard-boiled eggs, used a little less mayo, used bread and butter pickle relish, and threw in some chopped fresh lovage. I'll do it again.

Delish! Used baby red potatoes, and no hard boiled eggs, Came out fantastic. Also didn't cut the potatoes as described- i prefer a chunky mashed up potato salad. Came out wonderful, great flavors but also very classic. And my irish, potato loving boyfriend approves.

Awesome! Use small red potatoes, did not have a pickle so I used relish, did not have any chives or bacon so I used a bunch of celery tops chopped up and some prosciutto. It was so good. I made a pound for just the 2 of us. Enjoy

I made this with Canadian bacon as it was the only type of bacon I had on hand. I made it for a Memorial Day picnic. It turned out great and I agree with the previous reviewer: "you can't go wrong with Julia."

I made this last night for a backyard BBQ and it turned out great. Wish I'd doubled the recipe so I had some for later this week. One guest commented "I normally don't even like potato salad but this recipe is really good". The fresh chives and bacon add great flavor and the dressing was perfect - not too heavy but not too light. I did use about 2 T. of sour cream. Definitely a keeper recipe....

This is an excellent dish! It's hard to go wrong with Julia! The best potato salad I've ever had. I think the little trick of putting potato water back on the taters is key (and not over-cooking them). The cider vinegar gives a perfect little tingle. Lemon juice would probably substitute fine. The bacon is definitely a key feature. It does take a bit of time to prepare if one person is doing everything, but with a little chopping/peeling help this could go quickly. Best of all - I had 6 of the main ingredients from my own garden or from farmer friends.
