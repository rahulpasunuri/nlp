Blah, bland, boring. If you want salt and vinegar with potatoes, buy salt and vinegar potato chips or boardwalk french fries.

These are delicious! I've had this recipe saved for some time and always passed it by for another potato recipe, but never again--we'll have these often. I used small red potatoes and diced them in fairly large cubes before boiling, leaving skins on. It was then pretty easy to toss with the vinegar, salt, oil and serve. Very flavorful and healthy.

These were just okay, and I will probably never make again. Even though I increased the salt and vinegar, they still were bland.

Very interesting. Anyone who likes those salt & vinegar potato chips should love this.

Definitely use small red potatoes (i.e. new potatoes) and tarragon vinegar. I found that 10 min was not enough time to make the potatoes tender, five extra min in the microwave fixed that. Next time I'll boil them about 20 min, double the vinegar, add an extra 1/2 tablespoon of oil and go heavy on the sea salt. I also added fresh ground pepper and drizzled the remaining mix over the potatoes after they were on the plate. Very delicious, went well with the fresh broiled catfish!

This is a nice new way to do potatoes. I found it tasty, althought I used little red potatoes. Also used tarragon vinegar. I threw in some dried tarragon for that extra kick. I made them for a picnic and found they travel well, too.
