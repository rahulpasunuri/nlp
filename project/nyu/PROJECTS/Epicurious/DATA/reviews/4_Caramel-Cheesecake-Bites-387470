First time I made it, the cheesecake was barely as thick as the crust. I basically doubled the cheesecake part from another recipe: 4 8-oz cream cheese, 2 Tbs flour, 1.25 cups sugar, 1 Tbs Vanilla, 4 eggs, pinch salt. With more cheesecake to crust ratio, turned out great.

Loved this. Couldn't find dulce de leche so I made it. Boiled 2 cans of sweetened condensed milk IN the can for 1 1/2 hrs=perfect. I had extra but it's so yummy, who cares.

Absolutely fabulous! Dulce de leche not available at local grocery stores so I made my own with sweetened condensed milk (found instructions online). Everyone raving about these and making another batch for another holiday party this weekend.
