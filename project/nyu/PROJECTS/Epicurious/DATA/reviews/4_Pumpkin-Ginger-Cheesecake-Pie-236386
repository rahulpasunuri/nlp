I found this pie disappointing. The flavors seemed off in the cheesecake part and the crust was too strong. There are much better cheesecake or pie recipes out there.

So incredibly easy! I just bought a crust from the store (buy a big one, if you have the option). I also couldn't find fresh or candied ginger, so I used 1/4 tsp ground ginger. Not the same, but still delicious. Such a crowd-pleaser! My first cheesecake, and everyone has warned me about them...don't see why, if all cheesecakes are this easy!

Wonderful dessert to bring to a party as it looks harder than it is to make. I have also made this cheesecake with vegan cream cheese and soy milk with great success (for occasions where there is a dairy allergy) - the pumpkin and spices make the vegetarian version still very good and creamy. For a vegan version, skip the eggs and add 1/2 cup soft tofu. For both I used Earth Balance instead of butter in the crust. Awesome, flexible recipe!

This was a big hit, and I'll definitely be making it again. The flavors weren't overpowering, and it wasn't too rich, like most cheesecakes.

Awesome! Not as heavy as a cheesecake, lighter texture than plain pumpkin pie! Used this crust or the one with pecans, epicurious "Pumpkin Chiffon Pie with GIngersnap pecan crust". A keeper!

This recipe is fabulous! It reminds me of eggnog and pumpkin pie. In the remaining 2/3 of the cream cheese mixture, I added Canton Ginger Liqueur and Grand Chevalier Orange Liqueur for added flavor.

This recipe was awesome and stayed true to the text! I brought this to a gathering and it went fast after everyone started complimenting. I was asked not to lose this recipe!

This is a lovely take on pumpkin pie. I followed the directions with just a few changes: I used light cream cheese in place of full-fat, did not have nutmeg but used pumpkin pie spice in its place with an extra dash of cinnamon than called for, and only had skim milk on hand rather than whole. I don't think my changes effected the taste or texture of the pie at all. It turned out to be creamier than the standard jelly-ish pumpkin pie texture, and was absolutely delicious! The gingersnap crust really makes this pie phenomenal. And it was so easy! I will definitely make this again and again.

This is the best cheesecake (well almost) that I have ever eaten. It is light and the flavour is wonderful. I used crystallized ginger and would not substitute the powder. I also doubled the recipe and used a springform pan instead of the pie. I was serving a lot of people and wanted a bigger dessert. This worked fine except I had to almost double the baking time. Finally, I usually put a thin layer of whip cream on top which adds additional lightness to the dish. Yum! Everyone who eats this (even people who hate pumpkin pie) love it and ask for the recipe.

Married to a gluten-intolerant guy, I skipped the crust. Made this in pie pan and also doubled it and put it in ramekins. Both turned out great! He is so worth the bother!

When I found this recipe, I was looking for a super creamy pumpkin pie recipe, since I don't like the texture of traditional pumpkin pie. However, I wasn't sure which of the recipes on Epicurious fit the bill for what I was looking for. A friend of mine had made a pie one year that had more the texture of a pumpkin mousse, and I was looking for something like that. In lieu of not finding it, I found this, which very nearly already had the flavors I wanted to work with. My original plan was to use a ginger snap crust, fresh ginger, and make a creamy pumpkin pie batter spiked with orange zest. I tried this as my base instead, and it was quite lovely. Here are my notes/additions: Every store I went to was out of crystalized ginger this Thanksgiving. So, in desperation, I candied my own. Just put slices of fresh ginger in a small sauce pan with a little water, barely enough to cover, and a few tablespoons of sugar and simmer it till its reduced to about a 1.5-2 tablespoons of syrup remaining. DON'T THROW OUT SYRUP. I finely minced the cooled candied ginger and used that in the recipe in lieu of crystalized ginger. To the remaining ginger-infused sugar syrup, I added the zest of one orange (I used one of those cheese raspers to get just the surface of the orange rind). Then I squeezed half the orange into the syrup. It made about 1/4 of cup of liquid. I used THIS instead of the 1/4 cup milk called for in the recipe. I also added a dash of cinnamon to the recipe. The orange flavor from the juice/zest really gave this recipe some zip, and it goes well with both ginger & pumpkin. I might go a tad heavier on the nutmeg next time, because I like the spice factor, and put another dash of cinnamon. But other than that, this was quite good.

Got RAVES over this one! The snap of ginger is quite a pleasant surprise!

This is just wonderful. Try putting the reserved white cheesecake mixture in a piping bag (or any plastic food bag and snipping off a small corner), then pipe it around the pan in 4-5 circles on top of the pumpkin filling, also making a small dot or circle in the center. Leave equal space between the circles. Using a toothpick, drag it lightly from the center of the pie to the edge, then move around the pie, alternately dragging the toothpick from the edge to the center, then from the center to the edge again. You'll have a beautiful, professional looking result that will really impress your guests.

A big hit with friends and family and now I've been requested to bring this to both the Thanksgiving dinners we're going to this year! This was the 2nd cheesecake I've ever tried to make and was nervous because the first one was a bit of a disaster, but this turned out really well. I did have a couple of issues, mostly I think to do with the recipe amount for the pan I was using. I must have been using a pan that was too big because when I poured the cheesecake mixture in, it was SO THIN! Luckily, I had enough to make another batch of the mixture and I added it in so I had nearly double the amount when I put it into the oven. I watched it pretty carefully while it was cooking and took it out when the middle was wobbly but the edges were getting fairly firm. The consistency was perfect once it cooled, but it still wasn't a very "tall" cheesecake... so watch the size of the pan you bake your crust in! Speaking of crust, I used half gingersnaps and half Nilla wafers and it was delicious! I did have some crystallized ginger and thought it added a nice flavour, although it was pretty subtle. I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of the nutmeg alone. Will definitely be a keeper!

Absolutly a delight to make and serve! Everyone enjoyed the fluffy yet creamy texture of the cake/pie. I also added nutmeg and cinnamon to the pumpkin mixture for some extra fall spice!

I have been making this cheesecake for the past three years during the holidays and everyone that has it loves it. I have made it with both regular cream cheese and light cream cheese and it works well with either. I do use the crystallized ginger that the recipe calls for and don't suggest substituting with powder, as powdered ginger has a completely different flavor. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

This is an easy, tasty treat. My family loves ginger. I make my own ginger syrup and candied ginger [very easy] and I think that having fresh, strong candied ginger really helps any ginger dish. I also get better results using European style thin ginger cookies.

I made this pie for my family and had to use gluten free ginger snaps. Even those who are not gluten sensitive fell in love with it. I will make it several times this winter.

This was a great varient from regular pumpkin pie and cheesecake. The flavors weren't too powerful, but came out great. I'm glad the ginger didn't overpower it, especially since I added powdered ginger like one reviewer suggested, because I personally don't think cheesecake needs to be too powerful. Will be making again. It's a keeper, especially since everyone I know loves pumpkin pie, they'll love this.

This cake was very easy to make. My family and co-workers absolutely loved it. I didn't taste the ginger at all which was a problem for me. Either than that, the cheesecake was good.

As someone who has never made a cheesecake before, this was easy, sunning to look at and tasted complex and delicious. I recommend letting it cool for at least a day to allow the crumbly crust to set. Such a huge hit I'm making it twice in the season!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it got better reviews than the turkey. Will definitely make it again.

A new tradition for our Thanksgiving dessert! There wasn't enough to go around at both family dinner parties even though I doubled the filling recipe. I didn't have crystalized ginger and couldn't justify the expense. I substituted 1 Tablespoon ground ginger and the flavor was a success! I recommend using 3 T butter in the crust and pre-baking it for only 6-8 minutes, it came out perfect! I also put a small bowl of water in the oven while baking and it prevented cracking.

Great recipe. The gingersnap crust was fantastic! Very easy to prepare...will make it again next Thanksgiving!

The pie was good but not fantastic. It tasted somewhat of pumpkin and somewhat of cheesecake and slightly of ginger. I would have liked stronger flavors, but it was a solid pie and looked very pretty. Also, the gingersnap crust was a wonderful addition to a pie of these flavors.

Every year my family asks me to make a pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, and every year I try to switch it up and try a new recipe. This one is a keeper! I didn't find the crust to be too hard like other reviewers did; I used the Archway brand and it did fine. Everyone really enjoyed it! This recipe is the perfect mix between a pie and a cheesecake and I think it is sure to please fans of both.

This cheesecake is absolutely delicious. I have made it twice and the second time made a couple revisions. I find it usually cracks so I mixed all the ingredients (no swirling) and added a sour cream topping. I also did not bake the ginger snap crust ahead of time because it comes out quite hard. I also doubled the filling to make a thicker cake.

I served this to my family, who knew it was a trial and were glad to give their reviews. Best to stick to the recipe on this one when it concerns making it a day ahead. I made mine the same day and it was barely cooled. The gingersnap crust is good but a bit overpowering, perhaps because the rest of the flavors didn't have a chance to set. The recipe was easy enough to make, and I ended up doubling it as I bought larger gingersnap cookies instead of smaller ones. No complaints there! Overall very good.

I followed the recipe exactly except for subbing ground ginger for crystallised since the store was out of crystallised. The end result was just so-so (fairly bland), and odd-looking too. Maybe that was why when I took it to a party, it went untouched! : (

I made this for a family gathering and it was a big hit. I did not find it too sweet at all, though I did have crust issues -- I had a hard time cutting it without destroying the pie, and had to peel the crust from the bottom of the pan. (I did use a tbsp too much butter, and didn't crush the gingersnaps enough, which I'm sure was the issue). Oh well, still delicious and everyone wanted the recipe!

This recipe was fantastic. Pumpkin cheesecake usually doesn't go well with the family at thanksgiving, but this was a winner because it just wasn't as thick or rich as traditional cheesecake. I used fresh pumpkin, so the color wasn't as dark and the swirl thing didn't really turn out, but that didn't matter, the tatste was terrific and the crust was heaven!! I will make this again next Thanksgiving for sure. And is wasn't too sweet as another reviewer had said.

This is a winner. I used gourmet ginger snaps from Whole Foods (Nigella's) and the crust was amazing. The cheese/ginger flavor was just fine for mine and I used regular canned pumpkin. Delish!!

I had high hopes for this recipe, as I love pumpkin, cheesecake and ginger. Unfortunately, I found the resulting pie to be cloyingly sweet, so that I couldn't really taste the cheese or the ginger very well. I wouldn't make this again, but if you're going to try it, you may want to reduce the sugar.

Mine turned out phenominal! I used the gingersnap cookies from Trader Joe's, which are very small and needed to use around 35-40 for the right consistancy. No problems with the final crust, just the right texture and the pie cut and served easily. I made it the night before, refrigerated it overnight and then let it sit at room temp for an hour or so before serving. Everybody requested the recipe!

Nice to have a smaller cheesecake for 6 - 8 people. This was tasty bcause fo the ginger and was quite pretty as well. The resting time is important to soften up the ginger crust so you cut it and eat it without having to bang at it.

It is the best pumpkin cheesecake I ever had! Not too rich, just right. I used 1/2tsp. ginger powder, because I don't have crystallized ginger at home. And I used grham cracker crumbs with some mealted butter and sugar, again because I dont have gingersnap crumbs in hand. Then I baked the cheesecake with a cup of hot water on the side, and it turned out SO good!

Actual pie came out wonderfully but the ginger snap crust was so hard it didn't separate from the dish! I followed the instrustions exactly but the crust never became part of the pie...frustrating. Any suggestions? Should i have used the full 5 tbs butter?

It was my responsibility to bring the dessert to Thanksgiving dinner at a friend's so I brought this pumpkin cheesecake. It was terrible. The crystallized ginger was completely overbearing. Needless to say, I have been fired from bringing the dessert.

Chicagoland, the reason your crust slumped is not that you used a T. too much butter. It is that the recipe fails to tell you to refrigerate it for at least an hour before baking it off. I have a recipe that calls for 1-1/2 c. crumbs (cookie or graham cracker), 1/2 c. sugar, and 1/2 c. melted butter, way more than this recipe calls for, and yet it doesn't slide down the pie plate if it has been properly chilled. This recipe also says loosely press foil onto the crust to prevent scorching, and bake in a 400 degree oven for 3-5 minutes. Then once it's cooled you can refrigerate again. The short bake firms up the crumb crust so it doesn't crumble when you slice into the pie, in case anyone wondered why that step is necessary, since the recipe here doesn't bother to explain that. You're welcome :-)

I love pumpkin cheesecake, but should I make it when I'm not feeling well? I didn't have gingersnaps, so I pulled out a ready-made graham pie crust. I inadvertently reversed the amounts of plain cheesecake and cheesecake mixed with pumpkin. Oh well. It was still great. Would I make it again? Yes, but I think I'm still looking for my "Ultimate" on pumpkin cheesecake recipes.

Quick, convenient. I used a prepared graham cracker pie shell, which worked well. Made a second pie with brown sugar, condensed milk, and 1 cup baked sweet potato (yam). Good, also.

Just made the crust...DON'T OVERLOOK THE NOTE ABOUT USING JUST 4 TBSP BUTTER if making the cheesecake pie. We ended up using 5 Tbsp and when the crust came out of the oven, it slid down the sides of the pie pan!

Brought it to a friend's as a dessert for her dinner party last night. It was the hit of the party! We served it as a birthday cake for my friend's godmother.

This recipe was great..I don't have a food processor, but I heated up the cream cheese a little in the microwave and it all blended together fine. Also, I used fresh grated ginger and it gave the cake a wonderful fresh flavor...be careful, this recipe is very very sweet and you can't eat too much, but i would recommend it for a holiday dessert!
