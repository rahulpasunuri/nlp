I used a cheap round roast, the pomengrante recipe below, and black beer. Good result but not overpowering in the flavors. I will perforate the beef beforehand next time to encourage more mariande uptake.

I attempted this with a Bison Tri-Tip which was my only mistake. Bison is very low in fat and the meat turned out tough although marinated and cooked to recipe. Marinate was very interesting - quite a dichotomy of flavors. Like another reviewer, I broiled the mushrooms and carmelized the onion (use white and red onion) The sauce was amazing. Would definitely do this again maybe with strip steaks.

This was very easy to prepare. I couldn't find pomegranate molasses either so I used the recipe in one of the prior reviews to make my own... SUPER EASY!!! The tri-tip had a nice flavor but the mushroom sauce was the BEST! I also found it a bit thin so I thickened it with just a little cornstarch and it turned out PERFECTLY! So easy to prepare, I'll make it again.

A delicious marinade. I used Guinness, which is what I had on hand. Especially good the next day after the flavors meld. Makes for great steak sandwiches.

I, too, had problems locating a pomegranite molasses, so I just made my own: 6c pomegranate juice, 1 c sugar, 1/2 lemon juice. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat until liquid is the consistency of molasses.

I used this for a camping trip and everyone LOVED it! I also added a basket of regular (cheap) mushrooms because I knew I'd be feeding a lot of people and would have to double the recipe (I had to cut corners where I could!). This sauce is very rich and not for the faint of stomach!

What a lovely sauce! Instead of grilling the mushrooms and onions, I sauteed them in butter with the garlic over med-high heat. After adding the stock/sauce to the saute pan, I also added the blue cheese and parsley, so to better combine the flavors of the pungent cheese and the rich mushroom sauce. The steak, too, was delicious!

I loved this! I couldn't find a coffee porter on short notice so I used a chocolate porter which was delicious. If the souce is too runny try boiling it till it is a nice consistency.

I couldn't find plain pomegranite molasses, but did find a wonderful bottled pomegranite-molasses based grilling sauce in the gourmet section of the market. It had chiles in it as well, so I did not add red pepper. I used a very good bottled stout beer and it was wonderful. Excellent sauce, you'll want to serve it with bread or something to sop it up!

This was just okay. Way too much of the mushrooms and onions and the liquid was too runny for a sauce.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. Although it sounded great it was a waste of good ingredients.

I loved this recipe!! I used a Stone Smoked Porter to marinate the beef and it had a wonderful flavor. I wouldn't change a thing.

Loved this recipe! Very interesting combination of flavors. We first made if for ourselves and like it so much we served it for a casual dinner party. The blue cheese adds an interesting contrast. We grilled some veggies along with the roast. I also made some mashed potatoes because the sauce is so yummy. All our guests loved it too. Very simple but looks special.
