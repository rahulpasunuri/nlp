Fantastic! I use Gulden's spicy brown mustard because I never have plain yellow mustard in the house. Also had to add some pickled okra juice to the dill pickle juice to get the 1/4 cup one time - no problem - still awesome. This recipe is a winner. Tastes great w/ baby back pork ribs too. We've used the rub sans slather on chicken - also tastes great.

Another version of these is with a soak in a red wine marinade and smoking in a real wood chip smoker.

I see other readers were perturbed by the reference to a "cooker". A cooker is simply a barbecue grill, usually with the ability to use wood chips. Chef Paul kindly provided the recipe in the context of a BBQ competition so I assumed he used wood chips! I tried the recipe and was amazed at how easy it was to prep the slather and the rub. I used a new charcoal grill and had trouble keeping it at such low temps. Still, the ribs turned out delicious and I encourage you to give it a try!

These look great, but I don't have a cooker. Can these be made in the oven?

In what way are these ribs considered "smoked?"

What in the world does "outline the bones with a sharp paring knife" mean?

What do you mean by a "cooker"??? Are you referring to a normal electric oven, a gas BBQ, a charcoal BBQ, or a smoker???

To: threedoginn on 05/16/12. I believe from the words "Heat a cooker to 230° to 250°F" and "Oil the rack and ... down over indirect heat", that they mean a covered, temperature controlled Bar-B-Que Grill.
