My guests raved about this. However, I found the recipe hard to follow, the pastry always cracked, and the proportions were off. I ended up having to really improvise with how I served it. Now I'm often asked to serve it again, and people keep talking about it. It doesn't say what size cookie sheet to use, and it seems better to cut down on the mascarpone because it is painfully rich -- a higher proportion of whipping cream is better.
