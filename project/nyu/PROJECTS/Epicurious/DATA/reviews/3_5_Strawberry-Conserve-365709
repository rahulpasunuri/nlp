I've made it twice and loved it. Used it for everything, was really good on ice cream or pound cake.

We made this last year with small local strawberries. It was a delicious way of extending the strawberry season.

I had 3 cups of strawberries so I added some blueberries and raspberries. It was really good. I am going to jar it and give it as gifts.
