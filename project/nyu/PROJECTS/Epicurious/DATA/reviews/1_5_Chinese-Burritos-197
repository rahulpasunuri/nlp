This is edible, but "light and easy?" Miso has a lot of sodium in it. If you do make it, please don't call it Chinese Burritos, which smacks of "all Asians are the same". (sigh) Miso is Japanese, which I'm sure the users of this site are well aware. But why bother with the trouble? Just make yourself a sandwich instead.

This IS NOT ASIAN! I wonder who comes up with this stuff-- definitely not an Asian!!! Do they even run stuff past research? There are plenty of legitimate uses of miso, but this is not one of them.

Did not do to much for my taste buds. There are to many other good things to make. Don't bother!!
