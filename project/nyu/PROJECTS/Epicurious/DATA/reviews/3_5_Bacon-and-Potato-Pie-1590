This was easy and filling but I agree it was bland. Be sure to use a sharp cheddar cheese and feel free to add red bell peppers, something to spice it up. I used smoked chipolte tabasco to liven it up. Will make again but herb/spice it up. Great texture

This recipe was so bland! I added herbs, a little cream, anything to make it a little better, but this is one I will not make again. I understand it's meant to be for the time poor cook, so my suggestion is to heat the BBQ and have a steak instead.

I halved the recipe, added some red pepper and cooked it in decorative pie plate. Served it in slices, like a frittata. Simple and good!

Great recipe! I use thin sliced deli ham and a mixture of cheddar and montery jack cheeses. Added some diced red pepper. I make it and freeze individual pieces for a quick meal.

I found this dish ok, but not great, and definitely too salty. If I made it again I would likely use less egg and more potato.

I followed the directions exactly and it as ok, but nothing to write home about. It was also too salty.

Suprisingly rich!! Though I did the onion ( add garlic) mix in a tiny bit of the bacon pan drippings. Didn't have all the eggs so I added whipping cream. (How can you tell I'm from the Julia Child school?) This is great!!

The versatility and ease of this recipe makes it great for a brunch. I served this as a side dish at a party of thirty (doubled the recipe)and it was a big hit. It's nice to have something for the less adventurous eaters. This dish is very versatile as far as seasonings and add ins and I did not find it greasy at all. Great leftover too.

Used 12 eggs instead of 8, 2 onions, added 1/4 cup chopped parsley and 1 TBS kosher salt. Cooked applewood smoked bacon first, then onions. Delicious, so easy and everyone raved. How could you not like bacon pie?

Overall good brunch recipe - definitely NOT an egg dish. A little bland, added some salt to the potatoes and also mixed in fresh parsley and basil before cooking and as a garnish. Fresh herbs definitely made a difference!

I think those who found this to be a "greasy" dish most likely used regular cheddar cheese as opposed to sharp/aged/old cheddar which is much drier in texture and could account for the difference. (That's one theory anyways). I cooked the bacon a little before adding the onions and although it browned, it didn't "crisp" which was fine. I didn't find it greasy at all. Nor did I find the inside to be "unattractive" as one reviewer suggested. It was just an all-around tasty addition to our brunch.

This had far too much bacon in it which made it excessively salty. I liked the basic concept though and will make it again using 1/2 a pound of bacon or even ham for a more subtle taste.

I added some herbs to this, like marjoram and thyme. The next time I will use some more potatoes and a little less egg, and I will add some cayenne as well to make it a bit more hearty.

Very good. It tastes great, and didn't come out greasy or salty at all, maybe it depends on the quality of the bacon used. It was very easy to make, I used a food processor with grater attachment and the potatoes were shredded very quickly. The only caveat about this dish is that while the top turns a beautiful golden brown, the inside doesn't look nice at all.

Great recipe! I emblished it a little, by making hollandise sauce and putting a drizzle of it over each serving. Everyone asked for seconds and for the recipe. I have also cheated and made this with frozen (thawed) hash browns, tastes just as good, and Jimmy Dean Hot bulk sausage, cooked and drained. Very taste, a must try!

Thought this was a great basic brunch dish, i did however add sliced green onions ( scallions ) and made bread baskets by slightly rolling out 4 crustless slices of bread, and overlapping them in large muffin tins, ( so they look like flowers ) press them down in center and back in 350 degree oven till toasted, then add filling. very nice presentation for brunch egg dishes, especially if you slightly fold down 4 tips of the " flower cups " ... it also eliminates the need for toast or bread .... try it .

The concept is wonderful. Mt execution of it was a bit lackaisadical. The bacon was strong. the AGED cheddar weak and no potato affect.And I needed more onion. When I make it again I will let you know the results. But no matter what, it was a lifesaver!!!!

worked brilliantly ,used ham instead of bacon , passed on recipe to two daughters who also enjoyed it.

Have made this several time for brunch and what a hit! Wonderful flavors and since its a savory dish it pairs well with sweeter dishes like cream cheese and raspberry stuffed french toast. Great for leftovers as well...if there are any

Yummy! I replaced mozzeralla cheese with the cheddar and added a little horseradish cheddar. It came out great.

This was a very greasy and very tasty dish. It is more of a breakfast or brunch dish than anything else though. I would substitute the han for instead of bacon though, ease up on the calories a little.

I LOVE POTATOES RED ONIONS I PUT PEPPERS LEFT OVER VEGGIES

After making this according to recipe once, I have used it as a basic recipe and done numerous adaptions. Bread instead of potatoes. Ham or hot sausage instead of bacon. Swiss or smoked fontina cheese instead of cheddar. You get the idea. When you have one of these casseroles in the fridge, it's so easy to just nuke a piece for breakfast.

Simplifed by using frozen Ore-Ida hash brown potatoes with green pepper and onion. Also ommitted the bacon. Was delicious!

We didn't care for this dish very much. I used only 1/2 the bacon, so maybe that's why it didn't turn out very well. Not worth the calories. I'll stick to Home Fries.

I agree with some other reviews about lack of crispiness in bacon. Next time, I'll cook the bacon first then cook the onions in the bacon grease, draining off about half. Might add some hot peppers, too. Mighty tasty, though!

Drained most of the bacon fat. I should have left more bacon drippings in for flavor. Also added more cheese.

This was quick and easy . . . and received rave reviews from co-workers. I used half the bacon called for, which was plenty, and substituted turkey bacon. I also modified the recipe by subtituting marinated artichokes for the bacon and monterey jack cheese for the cheddar. Add a touch of garlic and salt. Magnificent!

This is a great dish to bring to a potluck. The leftovers are great for breakfast. Am planning to substitute prociutto and gruyere and see what happens...

My husband thought this was excellant. We are even planning a Father's Day Brunch around this dish. Although, this would make a great brunch dish, it would be perfect in the winter with a fruit compote. YUM!

This dish is great - so easy to prepare, transport, and store. It is a little greasy, so be sure to get all the grease off the bacon - I would cook in the microwave on a bacon tray. Also, pat the shredded potatoes dry to get the starch liquid off.

We served this casserole as part of a delicious Easter brunch. Everyone loved it, and I had several requests for the recipe. However, when preparing the dish you should be sure to cook the onion and bacon separately - the bacon will never get crisp if you cook it together with the onion as the recipe implies. Furthermore, the dish is just as tasty with half the bacon.

Excellent recipe!! My family loved it. Great way to add a new twist to Bacon and Eggs. I increased the ingredients slightly to feed a few more people and it turned out great. This is one of those recipes that becomes a family favorite and you can adjust it to make as much as you want. I think it would be great for brunches, fast dinners, buffets, or breakfast on Christmas morning.
