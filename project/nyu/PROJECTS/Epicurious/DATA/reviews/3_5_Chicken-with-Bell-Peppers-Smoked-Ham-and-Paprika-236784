This is one of my go-to recipes. It's easy, tasty and can be adjusted easily. I like to use wine instead of broth for a more complex flavor, but it is also good as it is.

I thought this was very good and my boyfriend loved it. I doubled the recipe for leftovers and guests. I added sliced mushrooms, garlic and seasoned the chicken with some rosemary. Next time, I might use tasso instead of ham, or even some thick bacon, but watch your salt. Definitely better the second day, and serve with rice.

With modifications, this was spectacular. We had chorizo on hand, so used a small amount of diced chorizo in place of the ham. Used a blend of red, green and yellow peppers and added garlic and mushrooms. I used a combination of sweet, hot, and smoked paprika. Very complex, deep flavor - the leftovers reheated were even better! I used bone-in chicken breasts with the skin removed. Will definitely make this again!

Didn't have chicken on the bone so I substituted boneless breasts (3). Only used one medium yellow onion. Thought it was fantastic! It was a bit soupy at the end but since my ricecooker was a bit premature, I just threw the rice in for the last ten minutes. More of a casserole, I guess, but my 12 year old daughter even loved it. Tried it w/o the parsley and it was great. With the 1/4 cup I thought it overpowered it I think I'll try it next time with just a sprinkle of the parsley. No complaints. Very tasty.

Loved this recipe. Only changes: (a) used 4 chicken breasts, cut in half (b) used 1.5 large onions (3) used 1/2 can tomato paste and 3 large cloves of garlic (crushed) per suggestions of previous reviewers. I suspect leftovers will be even better.

Fantastic. I cooked this right before company came so it was a pilot. I served it with rice and one guest said it reminded her of paella. I have cooked this a few times since.

I tried all the suggested add-ins - cayenne, tripled the paprika, tomatoes, etc. Bland and watery beyond description. Never again. I can't think of a single thing to do with this that would save it.

I loved this recipe... you can really add to it and put your own twist on it..I used chorizo hot and sweet instead of ham and I used an already cooked rotisserie chicken to save some time... my guests are still asking me to make this again after months.. and I am doing that .. try it

Used 1/2 cup of Coppa ham; added it during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Used chicken legs, which made for a very rich sauce. Tasty! Served with Mediterranean salad and quinoa (which was great for the rich sauce)

Added lots more paprika, some garlic, and tomato paste. Delicious weeknight meal. Won't go into regular rotation, but will definately make again. Maybe add some sour cream at serving?

I have tried this recipe several times. Tonight I added extra pimenton, paprika, and a little cayenne. I followed one other reviewers idea and used a type of ham with minimal salt. I also added a large can of diced tomatoes. Served it with rice. I am a teacher and we will be eating this for several days. Careful with the pimenton and cayenne together, it could be SMOKIN hot.

I studied abroad in Spain in college, so I was excited when I saw this recipe cause I had visited the Basque country. But, this recipe didn't impress me as much as I hoped it would. I think the particular brand of chopped ham I used was very salty because it seemed to overwhelm the dish. I used breasts instead of thighs as well cause I'm not a big fan of dark meat or bones. I enjoyed it, but it was a bit more complicated than I had hoped, and my boyfriend didn't seem to enjoy it much. I might make it again, but omit the ham this time (which is kind of lame since it's not really Spanish without it.) Really, my only complaint was the saltiness of it. If it weren't for that I'd give it a higher rating.

This was a nice, relatively quick dinner to prepare. Per earlier suggestions, I increased the paprika to good effect. Also, added some diced tomatoes to the sauce (rather than tomato paste). Works very nicely with grilled chicken breast, cut into pieces and simmered with the sauce. A great, different dinner!

So I followed the advice of 2 previous reviewers. I used boneless chicken breasts and I cubed them, I used chorizo instead of ham and added tomato paste and fresh garlic. Served over rice. It was delicous. My family could not stop raving about it and actually took the left overs to work with them!

Easy, tasty weeknight meal. I used about 2 tsp of the smoked paprika, but agree with the last reviewer that a full tablespoon would probably be best. I also like the idea of tomato paste. I served it with some rice but next time will try it with egg noodles.

Delicious & comforting! I added some garlic and tomato paste, and probably tripled the amount of smoked paprika. The sauce is so delicious I could eat it by spoonfuls. I'm definitely going to make this again!

A fantastically good meal that's not too difficult or time-consuming to make. It's in heavy rotation as one of my best dishes! To save time, just buy an assortment of cut-up chicken (I use breasts and drumsticks). I also use chorizo instead of smoked ham. It helps to amp up the spices without being too hot (although might be a bit much for children). Love it!

This was SO flavorful! Not the quickest weeknight meal I've ever made but still worth a look. I served it over rice with steamed green beans. A keeper!
