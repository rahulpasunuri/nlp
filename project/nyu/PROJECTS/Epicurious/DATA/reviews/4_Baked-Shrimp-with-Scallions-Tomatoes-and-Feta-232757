I made this according to the recipe. I used canned whole tomatoes from the garden and basil instead of dill or oregano. Served over rice. Fantastic and SO easy!

I made several changes so I suppose I am not reviewing the actual recipe, but I will share anyway since it turned out so well. I cut the recipe down in size, used very very large shrimp (about 13-15 per pound), and substituted half a chopped sweet onion for the scallions. I added that and the garlic to the pan and sautéed as instructed. Then I used a 15 ounce can of cherry tomatoes in juice, let the mixture thicken and added the shrimp. I baked it in the oven for about 7 minutes, then added fresh ground pepper and goat cheese instead of feta. After about 3 additional minutes I stirred the melted goat cheese into the mixture, which turned it slightly creamy. When I served the dish I sprinkled a julienne of fresh basil on top. The very discerning hubby said I definitely needed to make it again, and I agree! It's company worthy.

I made this recipe because of the great reviews. I liked that this was a quick and easy recipe. I was extremely disappointed with the result. I shop at Whole Foods so everything was organic and top quality. The recipe is "dummy" proof so I know I didn't miss a step or do something wrong. This was very bland. It was very quick and easy but tasteless. I put this on wild rice, like I read in a review. I think pasta may have been better. I also think the fresh dill made it worse. (I had to pick it off) I threw out my plate (and my spouse's) after a few bites and did not save the leftovers. I will NOT be making this again.

My new go-to recipe for an easy Sat nite dinner. 1 T of olive oil is plenty... I use 2-14.5 oz cans Muir Glen Fire Roasted diced tomatoes. Fresh oregano makes this special.

Fast, easy, and delicious. I, like others, added a few sliced Kalamatas and a pinch of crushed red pepper. I also added and flamed 1/4 of ouzo after sauteeing the garlic and scallions. It gave the dish an extra dimension that wowed my guests.

forgot to mention, but I used fresh summer tomatoes (i don't care for canned ones). I used three large tomatoes and I guess that was about 1 28-oz can...not too sure about that, though.

OMG. This dish was amazeballs. I made this with rosemary and a sage leaf instead of the dill because I had no dill. Other than that, followed the recipe to a tee and served with brown rice cooked in chicken stock. So simple and so delicious and I had no idea that shrimp and feta would pair so well. This recipe is awesome.

Ok, I don't give many 4-fork ratings, but this dish deserves it. My novice-cook sweetheart made this for his cooking night (true to the recipe) and it was fantastic. He served this with wild rice, sauteed broccoli, and a fresh salad. As with so many other things in life, it would be deliciously accompanied by fresh crusty bread and a glass of red wine. Bonus: We learned how to de-vein shrimp.

Easy to prepare and tasty. I added olives and red pepper flakes. Served with pasta tossed with chopped spinach and olive oil.

OK, if I really like something, I give it 3 forks--that means it's delicious, right? Well, this truly qualifies for 4 forks--exceptional. I serve it with Barilla Plus angel hair pasta. GREAT taste, super easy, beautiful (I bring it to the table in the skillet, which I NEVER do), and even elegant. After making it one time at home, I was able to make it from memory (NOT my strong suit) while visiting a friend. She immediately demanded the recipe. My teenage sons love it, too.

Loved this dish. My husband liked the clean flavors. Made as directed and served over pasta (for him) wild rice (for me). Both were fabulous.

I made this recipe, but I added Kalamata olives with the feta cheese. It was VERY good and very easy. I will definitely make this again.

Incredibly easy and straightforward. A delicious result. This is a keeper.

I had a taste for shrimp; had a taste for pasta so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. I served this over angel hair pasta and followed the recipe using oregano (not dill). The sauce was nice and light but flavorful. I loved it. It was also very easy to put together -- a no fuss meal. Next day leftovers were wonderful too. Will definitely make it again. Thanks!

Yum! This was so delicious, quick, and easy. I bet it would taste great with chicken too. Perfect with the orzo suggested.

This is one of the best, easiest shrimp recipes I have ever made! Served it over basmati rice and it was wonderful.

Wonderful quick meal ! I served it with rice and a squirt of fresh lemon juice. Next time, I'll try the red pepper flakes as another cook has suggested.

Followed recipe exactly first time and used dill. Fast, easy, and delish! 2nd time didn't have orzo and substituted couscous...terrible! the couscous soaked up too much of the sauce and robbed the dish of its flavor. Looking forward to having this again this week with orzo.

This is one of the easiest, quickest, and tastiest dishes to prepare with shrimp. If you like shrimp and want a very hearty and tasty variation on a nightly dinner (esp. when searching for a quick meal with few ingredients), definitely make this. To kick up the flavor, I added red pepper flakes, paprika, and a little bit of ginger powder. I served it with white long-grain rice, and the flavors just soaked right into it. My husband (a very picky eater) loved it.

For ease of prep vs. results, this gets a 3. There *are* more fabulous things to do with shrimp and feta, but they also involve more effort. I added extra garlic and some red pepper flakes and served over orzo with a Greek salad on the side.

Super easy and fairly tasty. Next time I might bump up the scallion and garlic, and use slightly less tomato. I used light feta this time, and it didn't melt that well, so next time I'd use full fat. But considering the results and the ease, this will go in rotation, and I'll give the book a look.
