Loved this salad as a main course. Added grilled onions with the sausage. Excellent.

This is a nice, fresh salad. Actually good for any season, but I especially liked it for Fall and Witer dinners. We ate it as a main course.

This salad is wonderfully simple and delicious. The fresh fennel makes a crisp and refreshing complement to the sausage.

I have made this salad twice and was enjoyed by all. I started with this salad followed by pork tenderloin and your sweet potato pie.... great autumn dinner.
