A solid beef stew, the olives are a good balance to the rich sauce...but the rum needs to be cooked off a bit with the vegetables, not added near the end, because the taste of the alcohol was still jarring and a bad finish to the flavor. Tapatio sauce worked great instead of Tabasco. Serve this over rice, and you're good to go.

A neighbour delivered this stew to my door when my husband was gravely ill and it was most welcomed and delish! She had added some tiny boiled red- skinned potatoes and increased the olives. I asked for the recipe which she copied from a cookbook It was slightly different in that it did not have any water or stock. This recipe was supplied directly by Ann Spencer from the Golden Lemon Inn itself.

Hmm, definately missing something, and I agreee that it's the stock that's the main culprit. Use home made beef stock, or a good quality bought liquid stock instead of water, and add a tablespoon of mushroom ketchup to this along with the tomato paste. I don't think the tabasco works too well either. Try putting a chopped fresh hot red pepper, (or as many as you want to taste), in with the onion, peppers garlic when you brown them. This gives a more general, overall heat to the dish which I think compliments the beef much better and give the whole thing some body. The olives work just beautifully, and like a couple of others here I doubled the qunatity. I've also done this recipe with fresh peaches cut into quarters instead of the olives, just pop themn in at the same time as you would the olives, and that works just fine too. But if you really want to turn this into a rib sticker forget the rice and serve it with saute potoes - just par boil them, slice them to ¼ inch and crisp them up in very hot oil - goes very well.

I came across this after starting out looking at an old Frugal Gourmet recipe for Beef Burgundy. I would agree with the other comments that the recipe is bland as it stands, however, adding 6-8 slices of a nicely cured, salty bacon into the recipe makes it absolutely fabulous. The other thing I would suggest is instead of mixing water with the tomato paste mix 2T of rum, or instead of that try red wine, honey, molasses, or maybe even red wine vinegar. I frankly feel that "adding water" is giving up on cooking.

I really recommend replacing the 2 c of water with 2 c of beef broth/stock. It makes the stew far richer & gives it a deeper flavor.

I followed the directions, but did add some extra olives and substituded west indian habanero-based hot sauce for the Tabasco. That gave it a little more flavor & kick, but I still found this recipe to be rather bland. Maybe if I were to make it again I would use more garlic, fresh habaneros, less tomato, and some beef stock. I don't know.

Just not very exciting. I made it almost exactly except to double the amount of green olives, and add a dried hot pepper. Still not very exciting.

It just wasn't very interesting. I made it exactly, except that I doubled the amount of green olives (I mean 1/4 cup to 2 lbs of meat - come on) and added a hot pepper.

This is DELICIOUS! It's a great alternative to regular beef stew. I used one green and one red bell pepper and canned stewed sliced tomatoes instead of canned whole ones. Served over coconut rice, this is fit for company.

I made this recipe for a West Indies themed fall lunch, and it got rave reviews. Especially delicious because I served it with Coconut Rice. Added a bit more Tabasco and salt after it had simmered awhile. Olives are key -- used them as a condiment so we could use as many or as few as we wanted. Easy and delicious.

I have used this recipe several times in my restaurant as a special and have always received great reviews. I have even used left over bonless beef ribs and it was a hit.

Nothing special here but it was okay. I did add some thyme though and more rum.

The "cook from Aruba" made me change the flavoring in this recipe. I used the spices in the recipe for BRAISED CHICKEN IN AROMATIC TOMATO SAUCE. Wow! It sure smelled and tasted great! I also used beef broth in place of the water and NO tabasco or sugar.

A nice easy-to-make family dinner - no more, no less. I might make it again because it is so easy and perhaps season it a little differently to make it a bit more interesting.
