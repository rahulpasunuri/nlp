This is one of the best soups that I have ever tasted. This recipe is the reason that every person should plant the perennial plant, Sorrel. I grow min e in a pot on my deck!!

I have always loved sorrel and was thrilled to have a bumper crop in my Zone 6 garden this year. I love vichysoisse too - and the garden yielded a pound of lovely new potatoes & a fat white onion. A heavenly meal on a 92F evening!

After reading that sorrel soup was common in France, I grew some in the garden just to see what it was all about. In the spring, it didn't grow at all. (I live in Zone 17, which is aphid central in the spring.) But I tried again in the fall and now I have tons of it. The soup is scrumptious. Tangy and light in texture, it tops soup made with any other green.

This recipe is simple, elegant and easy to prepare. I used vegetable stock and omitted cream. I put it thru a food ill to remove the chewy sorrel veins. I prefer it served hot rather than cold.

I had a large bunch of sorrel to use, and this soup was a filling and tasty dinner. I did add some peas to sweeten it because I think I overdid the sorrel. And used yogurt instead of cream -

$20 for half a pound? I just bought a full pound at the farmers' market in Cinci for $5.50, and it's not even fully in season yet.

I'd just like to point out that sorrel is very easy to grow. It looks like a loose leaf lettuce and grows like a weed coming back year after year with no help from the gardener. I grow it in pots on a terrace in mid-Manhattan. No need to spend $20 a pound for it! Get plants from an on-line herb nursery or from an herb specialist at a farmer's market. Fabulous too as a sorrel sauce with salmon. (Chop it and wilt it in butter, add cream, salt and pepper, heat through and pour over salmon before serving.)

I am Polish and raised on sorrel soup. This is better than my Babcia's.

I grew sorrel in my garden this year and was looking for a good recipe to use it in. This is really excellent. Even my husband (Who hates green cooked vegetables) loved it. It had a great smooth texture and the flavor of the sorrel really came through. I definately will be making this again.

OK, half a pound of sorrel costs like $20 now. And the resulting dish, while it tastes interesting, looks like split pea soup and smells like grade school cafeteria spinach. For all the cost and effort, little reward.

Because I am of French descent, I am always looking for recipes with sorrel. This is a delicious, cool soup to serve during summer or it is great ladled up warm, too.
