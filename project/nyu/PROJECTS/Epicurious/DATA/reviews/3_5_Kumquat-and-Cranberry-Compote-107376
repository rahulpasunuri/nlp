I tried this recipe to use up some kumquats. I thought it was okay, so did dh, but my guests thought it was awful. It was pretty sour, I must admit.

Added some chopped walnuts at the end. Excellent.

Didn't rate it because I just took the kumquat idea and added it to my favorite cranberry raspberry sauce - maybe next year based on the rave reviews!

My first cranberry sauce was a success! The bowl was scraped clean during Thanksgiving dinner. I used tangerines because I couldn't find kumquats, and they seemed to work fine. I'll be making this again for Christmas, but this time I think I'll use only one star anise - I'm not a big anise fan, and the flavor was a bit strong for me.

Made this tonight for Thanksgiving tomorrow and I think I could finish it off still warm. Looking forward to the cold version tomorrow. I think this would also be great over ice cream.

I'm making this again for Thanksgiving this year because it was so wonderful last year!

This compote is the absolute star of the Gourmet Thanksgiving 2002 menu. It is the sort of thing that makes your tastebuds jump up and dance, and was gorgeous with roasted, stuffed goose. Plus the colour-texture was luscious. And so easy! It is now my official cranberry "sauce" for the holidays.

Very interesting and refreshing. I was looking for a congealed salad recipe but liked the ingerdients here so I substituted star fruit for star anise and dissolved and added 2 packets of gelitan. I made for Thanksgiving and it was popular so I'm doing again for New Year's day luncheon.

This recipe is great as is, no changes needed. The kumquats give a delicate citrus flavor to the recipe and the ginger and star anise are winner seasonings. If you can't find kumquats, chopped oranges and lemons could be substituted.

I would like to play with this recipe some more... I couldn't find any kumquats so I substituted with some tangerines. I omitted the star anise and used only 1/2 of the ginger. It's nice and thick, tart and delicious. I imagine this would be fantastic with cherries, perhaps, with maybe a dash of cinnamon?

Made this last night. I live in Hong Kong, so finding the kumquats this time of year was easy. I skipped the star anise. I chopped the kumquats up a bit more than in quarters, as the quarters were too big. Very easy and tastes lovely. Will make again.
