This is a wonderful recipe but do not be deceived that you will actually be able to cut and roll the pork loin into appetizer "cornets". The concept is lovely but truly not practicable enough to be worth the effort and frustration. If you decide to serve this as an appetizer, slice it thin and serve on a platter with a side of the sauce and thin sliced European/gourmet type bread. Otherwise, serve it as an entree -- which is what I will do going forward. I also substituted dried cranberries for the cherries and loved it.

This sauce is amazing! But I also was duped by the direction- slice into 3/4 slices and shape into appetizer coronets? Also, other reviews said "I couldn't slice the pork thin enough." What direction were they reading? Upon a little research I found essentially the same recipe with the instruction for 1/8 inch slice! Ahh! http://www.newgourmetrecipes.com/appetizers/pork-cornets-with-sour-cherry-sauce/ It also has amazing pictures! Epicurious, can you please correct? I think people would be then willing to try and make this as an app! What an outstanding presentation, and just delicious!

Am I missing something? Why is it hard to cut 3/4 inch slices. Wish there was a picture so I can see the finished product. Do you cut the meat the long way or just across the top..

I LOVE this dish. I have made it several times, it is my go-to pork dish now, and always make it as an entree. I always brine the pork beforehand, sear it prior to roasting and then let it sit tenting while the sauce cooks down. Definitely add the sugar by taste- I've found that I barely need half the amount the recipe calls for; it just gets too sweet. Yum!

I did make the cornets and it's not easy to slice the pork as thin as it needs to be. Still, managed to get enough out of my pork tenderloins rolled and held together with rosemary spears. they look and taste fantastic. Definitely need to make with sour cherries and not sweet cherries. Bid difference in tate. I thought the amount of salt/fennel seemed too much so cut almost in half and got a great little bite of the fennel with the sour cherry. Pretty and delicious appetier

I made this for my Christmas party and it was delicious. I did not bother with forming them into the cones, just sliced as directed and topped with the sauce. I will make this again, will also use this recipe for main course.

My whole family (kids included) loved the combination of flavors in this dish. Really good, especially considering the relatively little effort it requires. I, too, made it as an entree rather than an app. Used a stick blender directly in the pan to puree just a bit, and I did add a TB of unsalted butter off the heat. My only comment is that I found the rub to be a bit salty, even using kosher salt. The second time I made it I halved the recommended salt and increased the pepper, and it was much more to my liking. I will definitely add this one in to my regular rotation!

Like the others, I made this an entree instead of an app. To save some time and make the sauce less watery, I cut back on the amount of wine and started on the wine sauce while the pork was roasting. Then when the pork was done cooking, I simply added the shallots and oil from the roasting pan to the wine sauce till it got the consistency I wanted. I also added goat cheese crumbles to the top when presenting the final dish.

This is an awesome appetizer. It is especially popular with the men. A nice change up from the typical cheesy and dip appetizers.

This was excellent! The sauce didn't seem thick enough to make the cornets, so I just served the pork sliced and poured the sauce over it. I forgot to puree the sauce, so that may have contributed (but I doubt it). And instead of 5oz of dried sour cherries I used 10oz of frozen whole cherries. Next time I make this (and there will definitely be a next time, probably as an entree instead of just an appetizer) I think I'll take A Cook from San Francisco's suggestion and add some butter for a little extra decadence.

This is dynamite. I served it for Christmas dinner--- hot, didn't puree the sauce, and stirred in 1T cold butter (off heat) for a little extra rich silkiness. It looked lovely on the plate fanned over a parsnip puree. Complex, deep, delicious flavors. This will become an entertainment standard for me.

I have served this dish twice now, both times served it plattered and warm with the sauce on the side. works brilliantly. I do reccomend letting the sauce cool some before pureeing in the food precessor. Rather a mess the first time with hot red liquid all over the counter top. Oops. Second time I used a stick blender in the sauce pan with great reslults.

I made this dish as an entree rather than appetizers and it was terrific. After cooking the pork loins, I just set them aside while I made the sauce. Then I poured the sauce over/along the pork loins without pureeing it, and garnished with a rosemark sprig. I served it hot. It looked very festive.

This is a fantastic recipe. Pretty, delicious, and so easy to make ahead of time. I didn't do the coronets because I couldn't slice the pork thinly enough, but this dish looks pretty with the sauce drizzled over it. And I've used the sauce with other meats--yum! Also, I've made it twice, once with just unsweetened regular cherries b/c I couldn't find sour cherries, and it still tasted great.

How do you keep the sauce from falling thru the coronet? Thanks!

Made these for holiday party and they were a big hit. The sauce was easy to prepare and delicious. The color combination with the rosemary sprigs instead of toothpicks made the plate look quite festive.
