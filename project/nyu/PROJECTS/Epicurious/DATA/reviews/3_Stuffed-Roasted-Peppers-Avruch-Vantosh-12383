I modified this a bit. I cut the roasted peppers into wide stips to fit ontop the italian bread. With these indivdual pieces, I spread the freshly chopped basil that I added a small amount of garlic and Ravida olive oil. Then, a slice of the cheese, topped it with strips of sauted prosuitto(parma of course)and a couple drops of oil. Baked it. I sliced and lightly buttered the bread and baked it with the peppers on a separate baking sheet....put them together like a bruschetta.....mmmmmm great!!!

Maybe it is just me because I had never had proscuitto before,but my husband and I both thought this was awful. We ended up not eating it at all. I love peppers cooked this way and the cheese but the proscuitto was very strong and we did not like it at all. But like I said it is more my taste then the recipe. Sorry.

I actually haven't made THIS recipe, but I saw Martha Stewart do something very similar on From Martha's Kitchen on the Food Network. She used rosemary instead of basil, but the whole time she was preparing her version of the recipe, I kept thinking how much I'd prefer basil. (Sorry, Martha!) So, I followed her recipe, using basil instead of rosemary, and it was awesome. The second time I made the recipe, I sautéed whole, thinly sliced strips of prosciutto until crisp, and then crumbled them on top of the roasted peppers. Yum! Martha grilled the stuffed roasted peppers, which is wonderful. Martha also held a roasted pepper with a paper towel in one hand, and peeled the pepper with a paper towel in the other hand. The charred skin comes right off, and I don't end up with shredded roasted peppers. Today I found this recipe online, and I would highly recommend it!

this is so easy and so good! fresh mozz is important. I brushed some bottled pesto alla genovese from italy on the pepper wall before adding the cheese, etc. also good without the prosciutto.
