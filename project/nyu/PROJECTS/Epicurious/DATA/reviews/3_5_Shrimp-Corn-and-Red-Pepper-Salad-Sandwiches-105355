Absolutely Fabulous! I followed the recipe to the letter. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. My friend made it with frozen corn and said it was delicious.

Great summer sandwich. Already had a couple cans of Oregon Baby Shrimp from Trader Joe's in my cupboard which worked perfectly. Used a few chopped piquillo peppers (also sold at Trader Joe's) instead of the fresh red bell pepper. Used fresh dill instead of cilantro. Loved it and will definitley make again. Nice change from tuna salad sandwiches.

Yummy! It was easy to make. I did not use the rolls, I used another bread. I served it with a side of Green Papaya Salad with Shrimp. It was great!

I made this last weekend for lunch, and used warmed pita bread pockets instead of rolls. The neutral pita bread helped enhance the lively flavors of the ingredients, so it worked extremely well and containing the chunky shrimp salad into pockets made it easier to eat without making a mess.

I served it on warmed corn tortillas instead of bread and garnished it with avocado and red onions. This is a great warm weather light meal.

Made this into a salad - added a little more mayo and tossed with bow-tie pasta. Great for a make-ahead dinner.

Kind of awkward to eat. If I make it again I will decrease the mayo content to 1 tablespoon.

I made this twice, once on rolls, once on tortillas and tortillas wins our vote. Used canned corn with success. Nice summer lunch.

This was a fantastic weekday dish -- lots of flavor and so easy! If I'd gone the easy way and bought pre-cooked (or even just pre-shelled) shrimp, it would've taken about four minutes. I put in a little more mayo, cuz that's the kind of girl I am, and more cilantro, and I too thought that tortillas seemed the way to go. It was delish!

This was a quick and delicious alternative to tuna and chicken salads that I often make for quick dinners or weekday lunches. I must confess to making a few alterations: I used more dressing than recommended, which I made with a mixture of lime juice, mayo, plain yogurt, and thai red curry paste. I also used canned corn, which worked fine. I rolled the salad into tortillas with a few leaves of lettuce and some avocado slices. Light, spicy, with lots of flavor. I'll definitely make again.

Absolutely Delicious! Instead of making sandwiches, I scooped the salad into avocado halves arranged ontop of mesclun greens. Also used a small can of corn instead cooking one ear.

I thought this would be an interesting and different sandwhich for a picnic or lunch, but I was disappointed. The spices were a little to strong for me as well as for my family, and after it sat in the fridge over night is became very watery. I will not make this again.
