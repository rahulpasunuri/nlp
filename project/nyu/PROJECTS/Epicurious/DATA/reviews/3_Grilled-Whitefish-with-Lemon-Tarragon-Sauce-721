I thought this recipe was a nice change of pace for preparing whitefish. My husband, however, refused to eat more than one portion - which is very unusual since he is a fish lover. If I did make it again, maybe I would use a different herb instead of the tarragon.

This was easy and delicious, and just different enough to make it special. I made the full sauce recipe for two of us, so we had plenty left to put over grilled swordfish a few nights later. I would add a touch more tarragon next time, or garnish the fish with chopped tarragon before serving (which I did on the swordfish) for an added punch. A keeper.

This is a recipe for people who like the taste of whitefish. It's incredibly simple, and the flavour of the fish dominates the dish. If you want it to be more flavourful, add more tarragon, but we liked it as is. Prep time is practically nil. Serve with rice and a salad for a super-quick, light weeknight dinner.
