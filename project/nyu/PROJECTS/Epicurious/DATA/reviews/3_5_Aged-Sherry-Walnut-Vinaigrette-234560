This is similar to one of my all time favorite dressings. I followed this recipe exactly and it is superb, especially on crisp greens - not good to pair with baby greens. HOWEVER, this recipe demands the best quality ingredients. The walnut oil is bland and the sherry wine vinegar is very tart. That is why the proportion of oil to vinegar, which is correctly stated here, seemed excessive to one reviewer. If the olive oil isn't tasty or the vinegar is not a good quality product you will not enjoy this dressing. With the correct ingredients I love it.

I used sesame oil instead of walnut oil. And I used the exact proportions in the recipe. The vinaigrette is wonderful.

for the vast majority of vinaigrettes, there is a 2/1 or 3/1 ratio of oil and vinegar. Perhaps these quantites need to be switched. Try 1/4 c oil and 3 tbs of sherry vinegar and see if that suits your taste better. I'm sure it must be a mistake as written.

It was pleasant, but not more than that--the sherry vinegar/mustard combo was a bit too acidic, and the hazelnut oil didn't stand out. I love Katy Sparks's cooking though, so I'll check out the other recipes.
