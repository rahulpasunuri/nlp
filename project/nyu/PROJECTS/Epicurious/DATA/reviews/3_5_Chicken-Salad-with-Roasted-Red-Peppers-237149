I really liked this as written, but it lacked a little kick. So when I made it the second time, I made a few changes. I slow-cooked some chicken breasts then shredded them. I used roasted and fresh red peppers, fresh spinach and arugula, and instead of the olive oil, I just used miracle whip. The 120 calories per serving scared me off of the oil, plus it didn't hold too much flavor. I switched to 45 calorie per serving Miracle Whip and used less of it and got much more flavor. At the very end, I added a bunch of cayenne, cause everything is better spicy! As a base, this is a really good recipe. You almost can't put too many veggies in, and it's a great quick snack.

Easy and delicious. I sauteed a pack of chicken breast tenders with sliced red bell peppers in olive oil instead of using a roasted chicken. Then peeled the skins from the peppers and chopped them... cut the chicken into bite sized pieces. I used a couple extra spoons of vinegar and oil...Even my ten year old loved it.

I thought this was a good starting point, but a little bland as written. I added a little garlic salt, ground ginger and cayenne.

This recipe was a delicious alternative to mayo-heavy chicken salad. The mustard/white wine vinegar gave it a nice zing. I didn't feel like taking the time to roast a chicken or head to the grocery store to get a ready-made one, so I poached 2 chicken breasts in chicken broth with 1 bay leaf, 1 tsp whole peppercorns 1/2 tsp rosemary and 1/2 tsp thyme. YUM!
