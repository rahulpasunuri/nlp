This is an excellent recipe. I could not find any creme fraiche so I made it with sour cream instead and it turned out fantastically. I would recommend making a few extra baguette toasts and make it a bit more of a bruschetta. This also make the meal a bit more substantial if you are serving it as a main course.

This recipe is on my 'favorite first courses' list. It's also delicious with seared scallops instead of mussels.

I was happily surprised by this recipe. I initially thought that a gratin recipe would overwhelm the flavor of the mussels. This recipe was not to heavy handed with the cheese. The tomatoes and basil definitely complemented the mussels nicely. To save time time, I used small cherry tomatoes that I sliced in half but did not seed. This turned out to be a successful substitution. The consistency of the "sauce" that the ingredients created when baked worked perfectly to soften the baguette crisps when served.

It looks good. Based on the other reviews, I decided to try it. The flavours didn't come together for me. I ate with great gusto but my family didn't fall for it. They had fried eggs to go with the bread, I threw the dish out.

Almost like a mussel bruschetta made in one dish. The flavors are complex and satisfying, though the "sauce" created from the cream and fresh tomatoes was a little runny. My wife LOVED this dish, and we will be serving it as an first course for a dinner party in two weeks.

Easy to prepare, it does not take the hour that it says. We were fighting over the last of the mussels!

Terrific dish! I made this for an informal party as an appetizer - it was a real hit. Very flaverful and simple to make.

This has to be one of the five best meals I've ever prepared! Incredible subtle melding of mussels with the other ingredients. Served with a dry white wine, incomparable!! A must meal when I have to "show off".

Very disappointing recipe. Flavors just were not exciting.
