I eliminated the cilantro. Very popular at a ladies' luncheon.

A really nice alternative to gazpacho. I used lime juice instead of lemon.

I kicked up (doubled) the spicing and substituted 1 tsp. fresh grated ginger for the dry. I also added 1 tsp of harissa and used more lemon juice. I had frozen coriander stems/roots which I chopped finely and achieved a delicious coriander flavour. I froze the soup to take on a picnic, and when thawed it was cold and exceptionally tasty. My chum had 3 helpings...

This soup is fantastic! I puree it in the blender as well and then skip the lemon juice in favor of a dollop of yogurt mixed with minced garlic, salt and olive oil. The yogurt provides the hit of tartness that sets off the sweet flavors of this soup and the bit of creaminess from the yogurt works really well. This soup is also wonderful served hot--I like to leave it chunky for a hot soup.

I have made this soup since the June 2003 issue of Gourmet arrived in the mail. I and my guests still love it. The only thing sad about it is that there won't be a new issue of Gourmet in June, 2010.

I took a lead from another cook who added zaatar and threw in some sumac, savory and a dollop of tahini. Superb! I've arways wondered what to do with sumac! Didn;t have any cilantro in the house, but I'll try it the next time. Those of you who liked this will like the Curried Peanut and Tomato Soup on this site. Oh, and I threw in a bunch of cauliflower, to give it a bit of chew. Napa would probably go well, too. (You can probably tell that I served it warm -- not much call for cold soups up here in Canada).

As this soup is one of my favorites, I make it all the time. However, an interesting thing happened once when I made it. The soup turned out to be very thick. This is because I burned the onions slightly. Last night, I made it again, with the exact same ingredients as the time before, only I was very careful to not burn the onions. In fact, I undercooked them a little. It is helpful to chop the tomatos as the recipe states ahead of time, instead of as you are making the soup. This was my mistake which burned the onions. Also, the slightly crunchy onions give the soup a nice texture.

This was fabulous and its ease pushed it to four forks. Yes I modified the recipe a bit (but what experienced cook doesn't?!). I followed the advice of others and pureed it. I used a vegetarian soup base instead of chicken stock and yes, I amped up the spices a bit because I love cumin. I also added a bit of zaatar and hawaj (middle eastern spice mixtures) because I like them. Great jumping off point and easy as can be!

This took a lot of work. Not because it was hard, it was actually easy to make, but because I could not get the flavors to really WOW. I ended up adding more spices - MUCH more, plus some fresh tomatos, which in my opinion, saved it. I also added some fire-roasted tomatos, but that did not seem to do much. I served it with homemade lemon-chili oil thank goodness, as it needed some heat, ended up pureeing it. I finally got a product I was satisfied with, once I added the oil and some olive flatbread I made as croutons, but I doubt it resembles the original recipe too much. When I stopped at the original recipe, I was not pleased, so I tweaked and tweaked to get it company worthy. I think I would serve this in the spring, when you want something cool, but tomatos are not in season, it is almost a sin to not get the fresh tomato flavor in the prime of tomato season.

This is my husband's all time favorite cold tomato soup and it is ALWAYS a hit with guests! the mix of flavors is amazing. Such a great break from "normal" gazpacho.

Delicious flavors! Takes it a notch above your typical tomato soup, and it's so quick and easy to make. I didn't bother blending it, but I can see how that would be wonderful as well if you want it smooth. I like the tartness of lemon so I added 2 tsp of lemon juice, and I felt the flavor just came alive all the more. SO perfect on a hot summer day!

I thought this was a good recipe. I served it cold, but it is good hot as well. Also, I strained it and garnished it with mint.

My husband was born in Morocco so made this as part of a Moroccan meal. My mother declared it the best tomato soup she had ever had! We did triple the dry spices (paprika, ginger, cumin & cinnamon) and we used San Marzano plum tomatoes (canned).

This soup is a favorite of mine. I have been making it for years. Although the other reviewers pointed out that it can be served hot, I love it cold. Mostly, I love how the onions have that extra crunch that doesn't seem to be there when it is hot. The flavors seem perfect to me so I did not add any extra spices. As well, I left it unblended as I enjoy the texture of it. It is great on a hot summer day when it is too hot to eat regular hot food. An absolutely delicious, exotic soup!

An unusual and delicious use for summer tomatoes. I froze the leftovers, which went beautifully hot, with a dollop of yogurt, alongside north african spiced lamb chops.

This soup was very easy to make and tasted delicious. I think it would be good hot, too. The only change I would make would be to add some cayenne pepper. I made it as part of a Middle Eastern meal for my family. My son added harissa to his bowl to spice it up.

I don't think I've ever rated a recipe 4 forks before but this soup deserves it. Excellent flavor and just spicy enough. I pureed it in processor til just about smooth rather than leaving it so chunky. Last night I served it as a first course and all loved it. Tonight it was leftovers.. Served it chilled over a scoop of warm couscous, a few sauteed shrimp floating and a generous crumble of feta on top...very similar to the tomato soup served at Boudros on the Riverwalk, which I love.

The flavor of this soup is absolutely delightful! Like others, I used my immersion blender for a smoother version. I love to serve cold soup in the summer in before a special meal...this fits the bill perfectly...with a thin slice of lemon and a small dollop of sour cream, it's beautiful as well as delicious.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe. I used an immersion blender and chilled it, then served it with a wonderful dinner of Pork Medallions with Mustard Sauce; Jasmine Rice with Green Onions, Peas and Lemon; Sambucca Poached Peaches with Ricotta and Pine Nuts; and Moroccan Mint Tea. I found all the recipes, as usual on this wonderful site.

I actually got this recipe from a generous subscriber to wwrecipes.com, my favorite daily recipe ezine. She did credit and reference Gourmet, so I knew just where to come to make my review. Very, very good soup, and easy, too. I used a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and half of my paprika was smoked Spanish and half regular Hungarian. I added more lemon juice, quite a bit more, but that's an individual taste. I used my immersion blender to smooth out the soup, but still left some texture. I served it slightly chilled, but I think hot, warm, cold or in between would be just fine. Today for lunch I'll try a dab of sour cream or yogurt as a topping on the cold soup.

Have made this twice with minimal changes and it is very good! I used a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and a bit more lemon juice. I may try it with hot paprika next time, but I think the subtle spices of the recipe as written are nice. This is one of the two keepers I've found on this site in my quest for great cold soup recipes. The other is the Chilled Carrot Soup with Cumin and Lime. That one is fantastic!

Rating: 3
Based on previous reviews (thank you!), I doubled the paprika, ground ginger and ground cumin. I also used fresh heirloom tomatoes rather than canned. And, I pureed the soup before serving it. Everyone enjoyed it and I would make it again (especially as it's a great make-in-advance dish), but I'll continue to experiment with the spices to get a bit more flavor. Please leave a review if you hit on the magic combination!

I made an even simpler version of this with the ingredients I had on hand. We roast tomatoes in the fall and then keep containers of them in the freezer, so I used those instead of canned. I left out the onion and cilantro and put in a sliced green onion and lemon thyme, but kept the spices basically the same. It's so simple and so good served hot on a snowy evening.

Excellent dish! Not sure if my spices weren't as fresh as they should have been (although certainly aromatic as they cooked with the onion). Thus, my next go around, I'll proably double the spices. Also, will add a few drops of Tobasco or other hot sauce.

I think this soup is delicious! Has a sweet component, and the spices are so flavorful. Soup is very easy to prepare; my husband and I ate it warm the first night and cold the next day.

Perfect alternative to gazpacho on a summer night-- better actually, because the onion is cooked, therefore less pungent, and also there's less overall 'crunching' involved. Used canned organic tomatoes that tasted like fresh. Recipe is perfect as is, but will use more spice next time.

I've made this a few times already, and love the combination of flavours, as has everyone to whom I've served it (except my teenage boys, but their 2-yr. old brother loves it). I once forgot the cinnamon and it was still delicious. I use pre-diced canned tomatoes to make it easier. I find the recipe doesn't call for enough lemon juice, so I just add more until I think it's 'perked up' enough. It's a keeper! Next time I'm going to use the Lebanese 7-spices to see how it tastes.

For a hearty version that's good hot or cold with the same wonderful flavors, try this: Saute three medium red or yellow potatoes, chopped, with one medium onion, chopped; 2 garlic cloves, chopped; and a good pinch of red pepper flakes. Add 1 can chicken broth and cook till tender. Then add all the other ingredients and puree with a hand blender. Great with a salad and the ever-popular crusty bread.

With temperatures reaching 43 degrees (that's celsius!) in Delhi, where I live, we survive on soups and salads in summer. This soup was SUCH a refreshing change from the gazpachos and vichyssoise we've been having so long. Will definitely make it again, maybe for a party.

Really enjoyed this recipe!! Served it as part of a dinner party in Maui - where a chilled soup can be most appreciated. Added more spice than recipe called for and used the immersion blender to smooth out the tomato chunkiness. With the leftovers - I brightened the soup with finely chopped celery, and added a touch more cilantro and lemon juice. This is a keeper!

Neither my husband or myself like cold soup (Soup is supposed to be HOT!) I made this tonight on a lark--we were surprised that it was very good. I did add a bit more of all the seasonings, including the honey and lemon juice. I think that this would also be good hot, in which case I would add some pre-cooked potato cubes when the tomatoes and broth are added to the onion/spices mixture.

Didn't care for this at all. It tasted like diluted canned tomatoes with seasonings. I ended up pureeing the remainder which helped somewhat, but I would not make it again.

Excellent on a hot day. We make a lot of gazpacho in the summer, but it's too early for good tomatoes. This recipe is perfect for when canned tomatoes are better than fresh ones. You can make it early in the day, and refrigerate till serving time, thus skipping the step with the ice. Either way, it's easy and definitely worth the effort.
