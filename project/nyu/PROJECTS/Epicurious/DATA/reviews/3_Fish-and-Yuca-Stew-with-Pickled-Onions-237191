I would make this again. It was delicious! I added way more cilantro, salt and lime that the recipe asked for and that was helpful. My boyfriend is from Ecuador and was pleased with the turn out.

Loved this! Used tuna which was excellent and the onion topping and cilantro added the needed extra flavor.

My husband (So. American) and I loved this recipe, even though I had to make it with a mild-flavored fish (haddock). Do not skimp on the cilantro, & don't be afraid to let the stew simmer a while for the flavors to blend before you add the fish. We liked avocado on the side, and next time I might serve corn bread, too - or arepas even better!

This is a superb dish from coastal Ecuador. It would traditionally be made using a whole fish, which imparts full flavor to the broth. Wonder how Anastacia knows Ecuadorian food so well....??....

I have yet to prepare this recipe, but it sounds to be a delectable fish stew, and so it shall be

I used bluefish (which admittedly I had never tried before), sweet potatoes (no yuca at the market) and skimped on the cilantro (I just killed my plant) and found this stew to be lacking in flavor and non-slimyness. Maybe it was just my substitutions, but I felt it needed a bit more flavor from somewhere. The onions were beautiful and tasty, so I'll use that part of the recipe again.
