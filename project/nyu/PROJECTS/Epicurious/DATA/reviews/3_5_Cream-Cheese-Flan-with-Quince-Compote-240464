The quince compote I could just eat with a spoon! And I love adding cinnamon to everything so the fact that this recipe asks for cinnamon is another plus. The flan is so creamy thanks to the cream cheese! Love it. Real winner.

I'm not usually a fan of flan but this one really won me over. Yum!

4-star rating is for the Quince Compote only. I did not make the flan. The Quince is absolutely perfect and was a hit as a side dish for Thanksgiving dinner. Consider using brown sugar and vary according to the tartness of your quince. Cook longer for texture like apple sauce.

Not bad. It tasted like regular flan, but not as smooth in texture. The caramel overpowered the cream cheese as well. If you want flan, make a flan. If you want cheese cake, make a cheese cake.

I'll admit I'm not a flan expert. I'm a competent cook however, and I can follow a recipe. This was a tough one. The directions for the carmel layer should be clearer. To get the dark amber color I wound up cooking til it was a hard crack stage and beyond. (sugar dissolved, then regranulated as the water cooked out, THEN the sugar melted again and turned dark amber) Eventually I got a dark carmel color when it was cooked to a hard crack stage - which became a thick hard glassy layer on top of the flan. I've read some other recipes for flan and they indicate that organic sugars don't get dark. So if you're using ORGANIC sugar, just cook syrup to a soft ball stage and forget the color change. Secondly,my experience was that 60 minutes in a 325 degree oven is a perfect. (I have a new oven and am using a thermometer to confirm the temperatures are right, so I think the other reviewer might have an overn that runs hot. Third, don't use a silicon baking pan... the flexible pan is too difficult to keep steady. Fourth, the recipe will overfill a (standard sized)9" cake pan, so prepare a couple of extra individual flan dishes for the overage. Hope this helps the next cook avoid some of my difficulties. Best of luck!

the flan was not too sweet, with a creamy texture... did not take as long to cook as indicated, checked on it at 45 minutes and it was already set....beware! making the caramel and adding water will only make this crystallize and a clean up nightmare!! just use the sugar and heat till an amber liquid.
