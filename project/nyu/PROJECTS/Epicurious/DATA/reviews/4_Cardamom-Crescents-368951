Delicious, even substituting almonds, but nowhere near enough butter asked for in the recipe to make the batter into balls. I used maybe a third cup more than asked for--there was no way I was "discarding" the extra nut flour, though it may have made a good crumble crust on something else.

I love these cookies but they fall apart when I pick them up from the cookie sheet or when rolling in sugar. Is it because I am using 1 tbsp as the recipe calls instead of 1 tsp as I think it should be?

Very easy to make. I added more cardomom and more pecans. I also had to add more butter and sugar. They turned out delicious.

Does anyone know if margarine can be used in place of butter for this recipe? I would love to bake these cookies for a non-dairy event I am attending, but do not want to ruin the texture by replacing the butter. Thank you!

These cookies are so great. I substituted almonds for the pecans and the flavor was so perfect. Easy recipe- a little labor intensive with the shaping, etc. but completely worth it. I rolled them twice and then dusted them with powdered sugar before serving to make them nice and fluffy looking. A huge hit at Christmas.

Loved these. They are going to be my go-to Christmas cookie from now on. Everyone loves them, they look beautiful, and they keep for at least a couple weeks. The cardamom gives them a nice warm spice, the nuts give just the right amount of crunch, and the sugar tops it off perfectly with a powdery kiss of sweetness.

even though i messed up...i pulsed the 1/2 cup sugar with the pecans & forgot to add the cup of sugar with the dry ingredients.. they were still wonderful, delicate cookies. love the cardamom.

To skibi: I make a similar cookie (sans cardamom) called almond crescents. I'm not a professional :) however if your partial to almonds I'm sure they'd be just as good in this cookie!

any thoughts on using almonds rather than pecans?

I also increased the cardamom in the dough AND added 1/2 tsp to the powdered sugardip. Very lovely, delicate cookie.

Decided to add more freshly ground cardamom and they turned out perfect! We were planning on giving them as a Christmas gift, but let's just say we will need to make another batch.

I usually prefer spicy cookies, so these were just okay since the flavor was not all that strong. They were pretty easy and quick to make. If I make them again I might increase the amount of cardamom.

A very easy and tasty cookie to make. Recipe says to roll a rounded Tablespoon of dough for each cookie, I believe they mean teaspoon in order to get the yield of 50 cookies stated. Also found the temperature to be too low for them to be done in 15 minutes, I increased it to 400 similar to temperature used when baking Russian Teacakes.

Very simple, very easy to make. The flavor and texture are perfect. This is the type of cookie you can not eat while it's warm- it will just dissolve in your mouth! So just have patience and wait until it cools to room temperature.

The cardamom is a wonderful twist on this pecan sandie and would be great with a cup of tea. I will be making these all year round!

Easy to make with a nice different taste with the cardamom. I froze them after the initial roll in powdered sugar and will re-coat with more after defrosting and before serving.

A lovely cookie to serve during the holidays -- the cardamom gives them an extra somethin-somethin'. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.
