I've made lentil soups just about every way you can, and this recipe is forgettable. I had to add garam masala to give it any real flavor, and in the end it needed a lot of garnish. Plain yogurt, fresh limes, and cilantro worked well. But something is missing from this recipe. A can of coconut milk would probably help. That said, it's very healthy, and it's not terrible. Just forgettable.

It was bland but I used water instead of broth at first, later added one box. I added celery, lots of curry, allspice, cayanne, cajun seasoning, garlic, garlic salt and powder. It was better but not great until I added pot roast seasoning....and 1 package of hot chocolate. Wow! It's wonderful!! I'm going for a second bowl now.

The soup on its own is rather underwhelming. I thought about using a sweet potato then decided against it - wish I had read the other reviews first. About halfway through cooking the soup I tasted it and found it rather bland, that's when I read the other reviews and amped it up with cloves, cumin, cinnamon, more cayenne, and a bay leaf. This also makes a LOT of soup - unless you plan and eating it for a week or freezing part of it, I recommend thinking about scaling back the recipe.

As an ever devoted fan of lentil soup, I found this to be a serviceable recipe. The amount of curry powder is appropriate, although some cooks might wish to punch up the heat. At the end, the flavors were not popping, so I added a dash of vinegar to pick them up.

Made some modifications, used less broth so that it was more stew-like and served it over brown rice. changed the seasoning slightly as my curry powder was a hot curry powder from Fairway Market (probably doesn't mean anything to anyone unless they live in NYC). Cayenne pepper was the second ingredient in the powder so I skipped adding any additional cayenne pepper and instead added cloves, cinnamon, allspice and a bayleaf.

The recipe, though good, did not provide a complex flavor profile. I used Muchi curry powder from Whole Foods. To that I added additional ground cumin and cardamom, a few tablespoons of tomato paste, some chopped garlic, and (the following is heresy) a small amount of agave nectar, some seasoned rice vinegar, a splash of tamari, salt and black pepper, and in the end, some chopped celery. I didn't have a plan beyond adding depth and complexity to the dish. Based on the recommendations of previous cooks, we used a garnet sweet potato rather than a russet - a great recommendation! The resulting soup was quite yummy, with a complex flavor that did not disappoint. So, advice to those who prepare this: make the recipe as written, but be prepared to tweak at the end. Use what you have on hand and trust your instincts.

Made with 1 TBSP hot curry powder, 1/2 TBSP sweet curry powder, and 1/2 TBSP ground chipotle; used a mix of (salted) chicken and veg stock. Overall, a nice dish. A bit too sweet for my taste, but that's what I get using a sweet curry powder. I will skip the sweet curry pwdr. and split the difference between the hot curry powder and the chipotle. Really quick to make; served 2 for multiple meals.

I used really great curry powder, and good chicken broth, and high quality vegetables, but still...meh. I think with lots and lots of garlic it might be more interesting. (Then it's curried garlic lentil soup. Different recipe!) Still, my family seemed pretty happy with it. Not sure whether I'll make it again.

It is a great base recipe. Like others, I diced up a sweet potato instead of regular, and cooked the spices for a bit before adding veggies - increasing the amount of curry. I also added a dash of soy sauce to ad some deeper tones, and some mustard powder. I added 1 14 oz can fire roasted tomatoes, some tomato paste, and 1 fresh tomato. (what I had on hand) Next time, I'll try adding spinach and splitting the broth - 1/2 chicken and 1/2 beef.

Rating: 3
I agree - good but nothing special. I added grated fresh ginger root and cumin. I also used red lentils, and this may be why my soup is more like a stew. Which is not a bad thing - a good winter meal? Next time I would simply use less lentils to make it more soupy.

Rating: 2
Good but not special, a bit bland. I found it improved by pureeing half for a creamier texture.

Great recipe! Like others, I used a sweet potato instead of a russet, and I also added three chopped stalks of celery for color. I accidentally bought full-salt chicken broth, which I considered not using, but in the end I did with no negative results (I just didn't add any salt at the end). Also used red lentils, which got soft in about 30 minutes instead of 45. I'll definitely make this again!

A great recipe - fast and simple and delicious. I used red lentils, which cook faster. I also substituted a sweet potato for the russet potato and added a bag of baby spinach. A great winter soup - yum!

This is an excellent base for lentil soup. My differences: add cumin seeds cook the curry, cayenne and cumin in 2 tbsp of hot oil for 20 seconds then adding it to the veg. It brings out the flavours of the spices much more intensely. Second I added fresh tomatoes with a cup more broth.

I made this last night for dinner and it was so delicious. I took a liberal approach to the recipe, subbing sweet potato for russet, adding extra curry powder, only one can of tomatoes and added a generous splash of half-and-half. I also cut the amount of lentils by 1/2. The soup was fragrant and hearty and yet delicately flavored. I only wish I had found this recipe sooner!

I have a bowl of this delicious soup sitting on the table right this minute that I just made. This recipe was soooo easy! I used a leftover boiled potato and seasoned water since I didn't have any vegetable broth on hand (I'm a vegan so this dish is a wonderful addition to my cooking repertoire) and this thing basically cooked itself. Very little hands on time and I could fix the rest of the meal while this was simmering. Excellent!

I liked it for a change from my old lentil soup recipe from my Dom Deluise cookbook that I have been using since 1988...Wow that's over 20 years. I made it with USED 8 CUPS OF WATER W/ 7 CHICKEN BOULIN INSTEAD OF 3 CONTAINERS OF CHICKEN BROTH. Much less expensive

The better your curry powder is, the better this dish will turn out. I also like to add some garlic cloves, cumin, cardamom, and another tablespoon of curry powder. It's very good with sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes and I also add a cup of frozen peas for about the last 15 minutes of cooking. I find that the dish tastes better the day after it is prepared. I suggest using red lentils to make it prettier.

This recipe was good but it didn't knock my socks off. I think that that has more to do with the quality of curry powder I bought. Overall, it did taste good and was easy to make so I'll definitely make it again.

This is the best lentil soup I have made so far, and I have made many. I was out of brown lentils so I used French lentils, added an extra carrot (for the vitamin A) and a tiny bit of extra curry. Served it with whole wheat pita bread, brushed with olive oil & crisped in a saute pan. This is the best one yet!

I've been making this soup for years and it is always a hit! I use veg broth and subsitute one can of broth for a can of coconut milk. I also add a little more garlic and like many other readers said, cut back on the lentils. High-end or homemade curry powder really seals the deal for this soup. I've doubled and even tripled this recipe and it always turns out great!

This soup was great - my husband loved it! I added spinach, garlic, and tomato sauce (omitting tomatoes) as others recommended. I also made an herbed yogurt sauce to add some freshness and slightly cool the spicy soup. Blend 1 cup plain yogurt with 1/4 cup each of chopped fresh mint, basil, and cilantro. Put a spoonful of herbed yogurt on top of each bowl of soup. Yummy!

This recipe is a good start...but it needs some flavor! Add 2 T garam masala, 1T cumin, some salt and an extra carrot, two cloves minced garlic, 1t salk, and 2T tomato paste. Also, red lentils make it very pretty. To make it vegetarian, substitute veggie broth for the chicken.

Curry, Lentils and Potatoes. It's addictive! I used 5 cans of chicken broth and added celery and 1 T. Sugar. I also increased the Curry to 3 tablespoons and the Cayenne to 1 t. (Hot) and added cumin. My friends loved it but Hot-Ta-Ta! Cornbread was great with this dish. At my house, it could very well become the new chili. Try it, it's extraordinary and easy to make.

Truly beyond compare. This is my favorite comfort food. I prefer fresh tomatoes to the canned kind (use 6-8, depending on size) and add chopped hot dog or cooked sausage to my bowl. I also up the cayenne quotient because I like things spicy. It freezes well too.

This is really superb if you're a little bit creative with how you put it all together: A few fingers full of fresh cilantro, some cumin seeds and ground coriander in the soup is a must. I served this recipe with a generous dollop of Mint-Cucumber Raita in the middle and a sprig of cilantro on top. If served in a modest quantity, it becomes a fascinating and refreshing single course veggie dish.

This soup is bizarrely good. I added some cabbage (the really dark green kind) and it was amazing. In fact, I can't figure out why it is so good-- the ingredients aren't particularly unusual, but somehow, the soup ends up being much better than the sum of its parts.

Yummy! However, as mentioned before this is very thick, and most people would not refer to it as a soup (I think rachel ray would call it a stoup). But nonetheless, it's a great dish, a nice layer of spice and you get to eat a lot of veggies too.

Rating: 3
This was a keeper. I followed the recipe as written, however did not simmer long enough and the beans were a little crunchy. I also blended all the vegetables and it made for a consistent texture and beautiful blend. I'll try adding garlic and spinach next time, and maybe a bit more curry.

I love this recipe and have made it several times. I love how spicey it is and it really keeps for a long time. The only thing is that is is very very thick. Just something to keep in mind - if you are looking for something more "soupy" add in some additional liquid or cut down the lentils.

I love curried lentil soup, and always order it when I see it on a menu. But until this recipe, I could never get it right when I cooked it myself! Definitely something I'll make again in the dead of the winter!

Delicious! Curry is the only spice needed here. Extra veggies (carrots, squash?) provide more broth. Used the crockpot set at low for 8 hours. This was not enough heat or time for the lentils to cook. I accelerating cooking by moving to the stovetop and that did the job.

I probably wouldn't make this recipe again as it is. I found it a little bland. However, the second day, I took the pot out of the fridge and doctored it up a bit. I added two additional cans of chicken broth to make it less thick, doubled the cayenne pepper, and (this is the big difference) added 3 to 4 T. of Patak's Mild Curry Paste. Huge difference. Delicious. Could be eaten as soup or served over rice.

I make this a lot. I have changed it by using yams for the potato and add two chopped jalapenos to kick it up a notch. I get raves every time I serve it. I like the idea of reducing the lentils a little and adding spinach, will try that next time.

this soup is absolutely delicious! i made a couple of adjustments to the recipe... i left out the potatoes and added a 14oz can of coconut milk, 2T sugar and some crushed coriander seeds. i served the soup over jasmine rice and topped it with a dollop of creme fraiche and some fresh cilantro. my family and guests raved about this soup and went back for 2nds + 3rds! i will make this dish again and again!

This doesn't taste like curry! It is wonderful, the curry and broth (I used beef) added great dimension to a soup that can be rather bland... My Texan husband says that it is a bit bland, but the spice level can be adjusted, I thought it was fine. It is a great (and easy!) recipe that I will be keeping in the "make again" pile for a long time!

I made this along with some corn bread ...the curry really makes it...I started off with a different lentil recipe..and I keep tasting it as it was cooking and wasnt that impressed...and I knew that with my kids wouldnt be either...so I looked for some variations..and found this one..and I knew that curry would make the difference...and it did..now..(even though it's still simmering :)) it's perfect!!..it's cold and windy outside right now..and i think this is going to be just the perfect thing to warm us up!!

This soup is delicious and simply so easy to make! It took me no time at all, the ingredients were so few and so simple, yet the taste is complex and sophisticated. The cayenne pepper adds a little bit of surprising hot taste that gave the soup extra kick. Next time I think I'll use a tad less to bring out the curry flavor. I added a bit more broth in the end (it became a little stew-like), but either way it was fantastic and my guests were asking for second helpings.

This is the best lentil soup I've ever made, or had probably, and it was so easy and cheap. I used butter which made it extra yummy, especially the potatoes. I also added garlic and cumin and used slightly less lentils and tomatoes. There is no doubt that I will make this again. I'm already sad because I know my boyfriend will eat all the leftovers before I can have any more.

Loved it, and made the following replacements: habanero peppers instead of carrot, frozen french fries instead of potato, masaman chili paste, and used two cups of dried pinto beans. I also used Shedds Spread instead of olive oil. It was as beautiful as it was delicious and healthy. Served it over sauerkraut. For dessert we had twinkies and kool-aid. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing!

I can't imagine this recipe turning out to be a "soup" if made according to the ingredient quantities specified! I halved the amount of oil, onions, and lentils and substituted Patak's Curry Paste for the seasonings. Also used veggie stock instead of chicken. The results were delicious, but definitely more of stew than a soup. (And, incidentally, it took almost an hour and a half of cooking before the lentils and veggies were tender!) I'll definitely make this dish again, but will reduce the lentils to half a cup next time...and add more curry paste too!
