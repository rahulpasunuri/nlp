This is the first souffle I've made and it came out great, especially given how easy and guilt-free it was. The leftovers this morning are great too. I followed the recipe as written using frozen strawberries for the souffle and fresh on the side. I would maybe add some liqueur next time to boost the flavor.

This is a wonderful, light dessert. I made it as written and my guests raved at the results. Since the four of us at the entire souffle, I was curious about the calorie content. I copied it into my Master Cook software and found that with four servings, the calorie content was 157. Wow, this was great! Delicious and healthy! I agree with previous reviewers that additional strawberries on the plate would be nice but even without them, this light, fresh dessert is a winner. One final note. You can successfully prep this recipe earlier in the day, cook the strawberry mixture; separate the eggs; slice and macerate the berries. Then after dinner, creating this dessert is quick and easy.

Very simply, light and fluffy, it didn't even cave like most souffles. Only thing I would suggest is making more strawberries along side it, we ran out half way before people were done. Also used only a teaspoon of sugar for the sliced strawberries instead of a tablespoon, complimented the sweetness of the dessert.

This recipe was great. We really enjoyed it. My 6 year old helped make it and is enjoying eating it now. A great 'special' and healthy dessert, not too complicated.

Beautiful! I halved the recipe successfully, and not having veg spray, I buttered the ramekins and dusted them with powdered sugar. Served with the strawberry compote, and a little fresh whipped cream.

Great dessert. One of the easiest souffles to make. I did substitute lemon peel for orange. To make up for the lack of orange flavor, I added about a half of shot of orange liquor.

I love this recipe. The only thing that I change is that instead of making one big souffle, I make 5-6 little ones. The cooking time is only 10 minutes and everyone has their own pretty puffed serving. To me, this is the perfect low fat, low calorie indulgence.

I have repeatedly made this recipe over the past years, and always find it light and refreshing. For those reviewers who believe it to be too bland, boost the flavor quotient by adding any orange liqueur to the sliced strawberries and/or the fruit puree. Souffles are intended to be "light" and not a flavor slap-in- the-face . . . and this fills the role perfectly. Oh, and if it isn't stawberry season, it is almost as good with frozen fruit.

need to decide how sweet or not sweet the strawberries are first...think this is why people are coming up with too sweet or not sweet enough. berries vary wildly, test first. I added 2 tsp lemon juice to strawberry puree after cooking. added 1T Grand Marnier each to sliced berries and to the puree. swirled orange blossom honey over top of merinque before baking....turned out excellent, not too sweet, not bland.

I also doubled the sugar in this recipe, based on the recommendation in other reviews, and found it WAY too sweet. I would definitely make this again, as it did puff up nicely, and looked pretty, but I will make the recipe exactly as stated next time.

I made this recipe for the first time with a cooking group anxiously awaiting the results. It turned out perfectly, though I did lower the baking temperature to 350, which is what other souflee's recommend, and therefore it took about 40 minutes to bake. I also added twice the amount of sugar to the souflee and eggwhites. It recieved rave reviews.

I made the recipe exactly as stated - even followed the cooking time exactly. It's not bad, but it's just not very interesting. If you're dieting, this is kind of nice because it's one of those low-cal desserts you can whip up and bake that make you feel like you're getting a special treat - a nice change from the dieter's standard dessert of plain fruit. But if you're not dieting, it's a little boring and bland. I definitely wouldn't serve it to company - it doesn't have any wow factor.

Wonderful! Very easy to make and it turned out perfect. I did add two more tablespoons of sugar to the puree and the egg whites and the sweetness was just right, otherwise it would have been too bland. I ate the leftovers cold with whipped cream in addition to the sliced berries. In fact, the leftovers were even better. This was not as rich or flavorful as regular souffles, but for a fat-free dessert I'll take it anytime! Will definetely make again.

I always end up buying sour strawberries and eventually have to throw them away. The souffle is so easy to make and sour strawberries are not a problem anymore. I added extra sugar in both the puree and the egg whites to counter the blandness some of the other reviewers complained of. The souffle turned out great! I have some leftover. Don't know if i should eat it hot or cold?

I made this for my boyfriend who absolutly loves anything with strawberries. He loved it! He requires me to make it when ever I come over.

really easy especially when there is a bounty of strawberries. it would probably be even better if i actually got a souffle dish instead of the crappy thing i use now.

Easy to prepare but very, very bland.

If you're on a fat-free diet, it would be somewhat of a treat, but otherwise, it's bland and nothing special. Waste of strawberries.

I'd put this in the less than less than 45 minute or do ahead category. It was easy to get the strawberries ready ahead and whip the egg whites and assemble and bake while company was here, and they were wowed. And no egg yolk either. But be sure to take the top rack out of the oven - the souffle rose and touched the rack above.

A spectacular dish for when strawberries are plentiful. Add some Grand Marnier or brandy to the sliced strawberries for extra flavour. This is the first souffle I had made and worked wonderfully.
