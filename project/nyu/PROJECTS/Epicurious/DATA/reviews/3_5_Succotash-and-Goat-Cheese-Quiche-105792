This is a staple in our house. For spped sometimes we use Trader Joe's Soyccotash mix which has endamame instead of lima beans.

Loved this. I used all egg whites and made the crust from scratch. Very tasty.

I forgot- I also added a whole onion and upped the garlic to three cloves, then sauteed the aromatics, tomatoes, and vegetables together before baking them in the quiche.

I made a lot of changes to this quiche, but still found it delicious. I added a cup of dill havarti to the egg mixture and used sundried tomatoes in oil in place of the seeded tomatoes. As recommended by another reviewer, I replaced the lima beans with edamame and used fresh corn. It has been a hit every time!

Really easy and delicious. My husband thought it was the best quiche he's ever had. Used pre-made crust and pre-baked it. Added peas instead of lima beans. Thought there was too much liquid (1 cup of milk to 3 eggs seemed like a lot) and it did overflow while baking. I had to bake for an hour because it just wouldn't set. But once cooled it was more solid.

Very easy. I tried to find succotash mix at the grocery store but they were out. For the veggies I just combined a bag of corn with a bag of baby limas and 2 cans of drained tomatoes with basil & oregano (as suggested by others) to make 2 quiches. I found that this was indeed a little runny and perhaps I should have either drained the veggies better or used less milk. I also tried to find the herbed goat cheese but alas SuperWalmart does not carry it. Anyhow, the overall taste is great.

I made this quiche the other day and I'm eating the last slice right now. Seriously the best quiche I have ever had.

I followed the recipe to the letter and there are a few things I would do differently next time. Use baby lima beans, less garlic (1/2 a clove I'm sure is plenty), more salt, deeper pie dish.

I used a shortcut - Trader Joe's frozen Soyccotash mix. Turned out fabulous, but needed a little extra time cooking to set

As mentioned by quite a few other reviewers, skip the lima beans if you don't like them! I've always left them out and added a bit more corn. The fresh taste of this quiche and the fluffy texture make it a winner in our home.

Every week, a fellow food-lover and I make a different breakfast dish; and this was our selection this week. We made it exactly as written and thought it was definitely a keeper. I can't imagine liking it very much with a frozen pie crust (as other have done), but that's personal preference I guess. No complaints about lima beans - that's what succotash is! Didn't find them mushy at all; in fact, they were kinda nondescript - just added a nice texture. Overall, nicely seasoned. Try it, you'll like it.

After reading the various reviews, I tweaked the recipe a bit - I also used a frozen pie crust and pre-baked it, although I could have pre-baked it for slightly less time than called for on the package. I substituted thawed edamame for the lima beans, as I like their texture much more than big, mushy lima beans (which I detest). Instead of canned or frozen corn, I used fresh sweet white corn that I grilled and cut off the cob, and chopped up about a half a roasted red pepper for additional smoky flavor. All in all, a pretty good dish!

Took a lot of the comments below - used a frozen pie crust (delicious) and a package of frozen veggies - think they needed to drain a bit more after I thawed them though - some extra moisture in the quiche at the end. Also brushed the pie crust with some dijon mustard, and added some chicken-pesto sausage. Used canned diced tomatoes with garlic and basil (omitted the fresh herbs.) Came out extremely tasty, although I think a little pancetta would have been tastier overall than the chicken sausage.

Made my own version. I have many food allergies - made my own crust with Old Bay seasoning sprinkled into the crust for interest. Made the quiche with goat cheese, sauteed shrimp and onion - seasoned with Old Bay again. Omitted the succotash entirely. WONDERFUL!! Would encourage anyone to with food allergies like me to BRANCH out. Take recipies and make them work for you. My alternative was fantastic - really. Good Luck!

Definitely use baby lima beans. This is an easy and healthy meal. I really liked the basil. And use a garlic/herb package of goat cheese - it adds much more flavor.

Fantastic! I think the goat cheese really makes this quiche. Made a few changes... Subtituted one package of mixed frozen vegtables for the vegtables listed. Omitted the basil and oregeno and black pepper and added 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp coriandar, and 1 tsp cumin and baked in a frozen crust (no need to prebake)

There is something that is just not right about lima beans in quiche. The lima beans were too big and chunky and there were way too many of them. Perhaps if the lima beans took a back seat this recipe would greatly improve.
