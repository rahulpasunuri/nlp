Yuck. Inedible. Waaayyy too much mayonnaise. oily. Disgusting. Used it as a way to use up chicken instead of throwing it out but will end up throwing it out anyway but now also wasted almost a whole small jar of mayonnaise. Don't make this recipe!

This has been a family favorite for years. However, I substitute plain yogurt for some of the mayo and add about 1/2 cup of salad olives with pimientos. The olives add [IMHO] a needed kick to the flavor. Is this dish[politically correct these days? Probably not, but you can't live on broiled fish all the time!

This recipe was fantastic comfort food. I doubled the amount of cheese and almost halved the amount of Mayo and it was perfect. I served it with a nice fresh salad and the combination was perfect.

No forks. I had to throw this dish away, it was so bad. First of all.. WAY too much mayo. I even cut it down to 3/4 cup and it was still way too much. The overall taste just was not appetizing at all and the potato chips in my opinion added nothing to the dish but extra calories. Definitely will never make this again!

Chips are a must-have since that's the way my mom always made it when I was growing up. If you have leftovers, simply replace the top layer of chips with fresh ones to crisp them back up.

This is an everyday hot chicken salad which serves 5 people not 8. I added fresh chopped basil, scallions with the green parts, chopped red pepper, dried cranberries and sugar coated walnuts instead of almonds. The additional red and green helped the presentation. Scoop on top of some greens, add some good crusty bread and people who like this sort of dish can serve it for a luncheon.

A homestyle recipe that will please some palates that grew up with this sort of thing. Use a 9s9 inch pan if you don't want the very thin cassarole that the recipe "as is" will yield. Double the amount of cheese for better binding and more intense flavor. Use baked lightly-salted potato chips to avoid oil and salt overload. Don't be afrid to increase the amount of almonds to taste ... they're the salient ingredient that gives this dish its character.Although I've not yet tried this, next time I'll substitute tart plain yogurt for the mayo, and perhaps add a beat egg too. The recipe as listed is not exactly perfect, but provides a decent basis for a simple "mom next door" dish.

Terrible! Not only did the recipe not even yield enough to warrant a 13 by 9 inch pan, but it came out an oily mess! The potato chip topping, while a tasty idea, creates way too much grease and ruins the already awful recipe. Folks - do not waste your time or chicken on this one.

Eh, it didn't melt together the way I thought it was, and mine turned out kind of dry. Maybe add more mayo to be on the safe side? Or just forget the hotness and throw in some grapes and walnuts!

I have made this for many years and it is always a "hit". She's right about the potato chips!
