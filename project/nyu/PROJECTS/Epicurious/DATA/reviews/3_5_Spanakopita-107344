Many thanks to the culinary kitten for her Greek additions. With the addition of the green onions, parsley, lemon juice and egg, this recipe is perfect and authentic tasting. I'd then give it four forks. I love this website, as much for the reviews it contains as for the recipes themseleves.

ditto for below, esp since i followed all of her advice, including wincing at the cost of the excellent feta, doubling the effort involved in the spinach by squeezing out all the moisture, busting out the microplane and the fresh nutmeg, adding a little lemon juice. i also added one egg bc i wanted the filling to hold together jussst a little bit. and you know what? best. spanakopita. i've. ever. had. including the soggy, day old spanakopita that i ate over and over in greece. thanks, culinarykitten!

quick disclaimer - this is another one of those annoying reviews where the person changed the original recipe. that said, i am greek, and i've eaten a lot of spanakopita - good, bad and so so. this is a good, basic recipe, but i'm going to offer up a few key points and additions, because they make all the difference: 1) Use frozen spinach. Thaw it and squeeze every little bit of water out of it that you can. By hand if you have to. This takes time, but is completely worth it; 2) Make sure the feta is amazing to start with. I found some lovely sheep's milk feta in brine that was imported from bulgaria - sweet and creamy with the perfect amount of salt; 3) Use freshly grated nutmeg; 4) Be mindful of your filling to phyllo ratio. Nothing ruins an otherwise amazing spanakopita than not having enough filling in each bite; 5) Additions: sauteed white and green onions, finely chopped flat- leaf parsely, dried dill, the juice of 1/2 a lemon and freshly ground pepper. Once you've seasoned the filling to your taste, stir in one beaten egg to bind; 6) Don't fear the phyllo - with a little melted butter, all is forgiven.

I had so much rainbow swiss chard from the CSA I used that instead of spinach. Sauteed it with pine nuts and garlic, gave it a quick spin in the Cuisinart, then added cheese and 1 egg. Used 1/2 stick of butter then finished the rest with non- stick olive oil spray. Both were equally delicious. A bit time consuming but fun and very good.

This recipe was a good base, but I added a lot to make it extra special. First, I sauteed a clove of garlic, and added that and 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to the chopped spinach. I also added about 3 Tbsp of toasted pine nuts, and the juice of 1/2 a lemon. Once I was happy with the seasoning, I added an egg to bind it when baked. These were devoured by my family this Christmas! They are a lot of work, but you can make then in advance and then just pop them in the oven when you're ready.

These were lovely. Very time consuming as we all know. I added half of a lemon's juice(which really does brighten the flavor) and about 3 tablespoons of roasted, chopped pine nuts. I think using a less salty, good quality Greek feta is important. That's what my Mom always told me when we made this growing up. Huge holiday hit as folks were standing by my oven just waiting to have them come out.

Yum! This recipe was easy to follow (but a bit time consuming with the phyllo layering process). I added a lot more spinach, some garlic a squeeze of lemon, and omitted the nutmeg. Delicious! I like spanakopita best when served with plain yogurt or tzatziki.

Found this recipe to be easy, straight-forward, and absolutely fantastic! Delicious! Easy enough to make a large batch, freeze half, and serve the other half to guests. LOVE it!

These pastries were absolutely delicious and I cannot wait to make them again. I just used water for wilting the spinach, not any butter or oil. I tried to avoid squeezing the water out of the cooked spinach with my hands but it turns out that is the only way to get most of the water out. I added the juice of one lemon as a previous poster suggested and I will do that again. I also divided the phyllo dough into four strips, not six and I was happy with the size of the triangles.

By the way, these also freeze beautifully. I plan to make an enormous batch when I have the time, then pull them out when guests arrive unexpectedly.

Great recipe. I made these last night for an appetizer party. Rave reviews! They were delicious. I will definately make these again. This was my first time making Spanakopita so there were a few things I learned in the process. The next time I make this recipe I would double the filling. I ran out halfway through and had to make another batch. I used cooking spray instead of brushing butter on. I just buttered the outside once the triangles were formed. The phyllo is so delicate and it is easy to rip while brushing. I used one sheet, sprayed, then folded it in half, sprayed again instead of stacking two full sheets on top of one another. I found this to be much easier.

This was so good! And surprisingly easy. I just wish there wasn't so much butter needed, though.

I have made this recipe as written and it is good. I have also modified it in various ways. For example, I didn't have 17 by 12 inch phyllo sheets. Mine were like 8 by 10, I think. Anyhow, I just cut the strips in half lengthwise to make large triangles for individual dinner portions. I've also sauteed and added 4 sliced green onions and 2 crushed garlic cloves and a couple teaspoons chopped fresh dill and black pepper to taste (you don't need to add salt because the feta is salty).

This is surprisingly easy to make & pretty impressive. I will do a few things differently next time for sure... Unsalted butter is a must! I went a little overboard on the feta. Turns out there really can be too much of a good thing. I used about 3 cups crumbled - I'll stick to the recommended 2 cups from now on. I think the nutmeg needs to be toned down a bit from the 1/2 tsp...I found it to be too prominent a flavor (and I used the pre-ground version - glad I didn't go fresh). Next time I'm planning on adding an egg, as recommended by other reviewers, though I'm curious to see if it becomes too much like quiche. Overall though, they turned out fantastic & considering what you end up with, I thought it was pretty quick & easy.

Make it "lasagna style" by laying out the layers, but cut them BEFORE cooking! This way you will not have the flaky mess when trying to cut them. YUM.

This is a perfect party appetizer. Made the recipe as is, with the exception of using frozen chopped spinach. This is the classic Greek recipe - it doesn't need anything else, and if you use a nice fresh feta, there's no issue with the filling staying together.

Rating: 4
Great! I made this in a small pyrex to save time. I used 20 oz of fresh regular (non-baby) spinach and spun it dry in a salad spinner--so much easier than squeezing dry by hand. I also added some ricotta to the spinach and feta mixture, and used an egg like other reviewers suggested.

There are so many types of specialty fetas out there and I think using the right one makes all the difference. I used a Bulgarian sheeps milk feta which has a nice salty zing like a Parmesean mixed with lemon juice. That and the freshly ground nutmeg. Simple and effective.

I made this in a pan to speed things along. Turned out great, but hard to cut. It is best eaten as finger food. I added an egg to the spinach.

To minimize the need to cut the phyllo dough I just butter a sheet and then fold it in half. Works great. Also I augment the feta cheese with other cheese such as ricotta or cottage. good for a student on a budget.

Made a double batch of these and froze them for a cocktail party for 25 I hosted this weekend. Very good recipe, though I thought the filling could have been a bit cheesier - next time I'll try adding parmesan as suggested by others. I also added minced garlic to the filling and brushed the pastries with an egg wash for show prior to baking. Served with a homemade tzatsiki dipping "sauce"

I have made this plate 3 times now and everybody just raves about it!!! The only changes I've made were to double the amount of feta cheese, add a good splash of lemon juice, it really perks up the taste, and a pinch more of salt. And because I am always in a rush, instead of the little trinagles, I've placed the dough in lasagna-style on a rectangular pan. It cuts a lot on prep time, but I am hoping toone day do it as in the photo, the presentation is so much nicer. I have made it once with melted butter and twice with olive oil and really did not taste much difference, but that could be my taste buds plus my hurry-hurry attitude. Perfect people pleaser even for those not accoustomed to "foreign" tastes. Try it you wont regret it!!

Rating: 3
This is a really good recipe; tastes close to the version at a neighborhood Greek restaurant. I did follow some variations posted by previous users: - 1 lb. frozen chopped spinach, thawed. - 1 egg (to keep things together) - more feta, I like this to be really cheesy. - 1/2 - 3/4 cup grated parmesan or romano cheese - 1-2 garlic cloves, minced - only 1/2 an onion, too much overpowers it. I don't cook the onions or spinach before rolling up the triangles since I use frozen spinach. It's much easier and faster this way. Overall a really great treat!

Rating: 3
This was really good -- I used frozen spinach and it worked just fine. Ran out of feta so used a similar dry goat cheese with parmesan and egg and lemon as suggested by other reviewers. I also added some cream cheese per the recipe on the phyllo box. the smaller strips meant I could work with three at a time. I find melted butter gets all over the place so I line my counter with waxed paper so I can just roll up any mess and throw away.

I made this years ago and have been wanting to make it again ever since. To watch the faces of those who devoured them was sheer delight!

Easy to make and tasty. Your guests will think you spent hours preparing them! I find making your own phyllo dough is much easier to work with, and quick and simple to make. I also like to add traditional fillings of ricotta, ground beef, or potato. Egg works well as a binder when using these fillings, but the point is you can be creative and they are fantastic!

Very tasty. I had never used phyllo before, nor had I ever tasted Spanakopita. I used herbed feta with garlic already in it and it turned out just fine. I might add some sauteed onion to the mixture next time I make it, but only because I'm a huge onion fan. Otherwise I thought it was a good appetizer just as it is.

Rating: 1
Where's the dill? The raisins? The egg to help bind it altogether? I make Spanikopita all the time but my recipe calls for raisins (I like Thompson), lots of dill, lots of feta, some mozzarella, and egg, in addition to the spinach, of course. Oh, and onions!!! A MUST. In fact, I use leeks but if I don't have any, I just use yellow onion. Now, think about it for a minute and you KNOW those flavours are wonderful together. Now, I don't know if that is the traditional Greek way of cooking it or not, but if it's BETTER, than who cares, right? ;-)

These were a big hit and not too difficult to make. I added some fresh garlic to the pan when cooking the spinach and added an egg, some oregano and a splash of lemon as the other reviewer from Greece suggested. I'm not a big fan of nutmeg but used a little bit anyway. Very delicious appetizer and very impressive! Yummy.

By spooning the filling into pre-formed phyllo shells instead of layering the dough you will save TONS of time. Thirty minutes tops to prepare and bake - a good alternative to the labor-intensive version. Use frozen spinach and the garlic is a must.

This recipe was very similar to the Spanikopita I ate in Greece. It is a very time-consuming process but a great make-ahead party food. I used 2 packages of frozen spinach, 1 beaten egg, a splash of lemon juice, a wee bit of oregano and dill, 2 chopped onion and 3 cloves of garlic. Do NOT omit the nutmeg...that is the flavor that makes this dish Greek. It is subtle - don't worry about it tasting too apple pie-ish. All in all, a wonderful finger food!

Rating: 4
Loved all the tips and additions I also added basil just because I had it. I found that using a pizza cutter made cutting the strips a dream! I made a larger batch than the recipe and made 80! Will make and freeze another batch for when people drop in. I have always bought the ready made ones thinking it was too fiddly to do your own - WRONG, easy and so much better.

These were so much easier to make than I expected. I used frozen spinach because that is what I had. If you do so, squeeze the spinach dry in paper towel, and delete one egg. Otherwise... very good. I served them as appetizers at a 4th of July BBQ... They were gone before I got out of the kitchen.

Like others suggested, I added garlic, onions and parmesan to the spinach mix. I didn't have fresh nutmeg or time to go get it, so I omitted it. I will definitely use the suggestion to use non-stick cooking spray instead of butter next time, I discovered that at the end of assembly and it made things MUCH easier. A suggestion for freezing them in advance: freeze in a single layer as they are difficult to pry apart once the dough freezes together (and you are supposed to cook them while they are still frozen). My guests loved these, as did my husband who grew up in Crete. However, I will add more jack/parmesan/romano or some other white, melting cheese to the mix (in addition to the feta) to cut down some of the crumbly-ness of the filling. Will definitely make these again!

Just an FYI, nutmeg is the key ingredient here. It will really enhance the flavors. Don't leave it out, you'll be happier with nutmeg!:)

I agree, this recipe is ideal as a starter on a bed of rocket with some cherry tomatoes. I usually add some dill and roasted pinenuts to give the filling a little extra crunch. Instead of making triangles I generally tend to make strudles as I find it easier to roll Filo pastry than fold it! The other great thing about this recipe is that the dish is almost as good cold (save that the pastry does not stay crisp).

I was happily surprised to see this recipe. My husband is Greek and this is a classic dish in my household. Instead of making the small spinack triangles, I usually make a pie. I also always add spring onion, 2tsp of Greek olive oil and mint. Delicious and a great success at dinner parties.

Rating: 4
Amazingly simple and delicious appetizer! Made these for Christmas celebration and they were enjoyed by all. The pastry was surprisingly easy to work with. The triangles were simple to wrap - - I found the trick was to butter each layer well starting with edges first. I was also careful to press edges flat. I froze mine, which was great. Freezing them allowed me to cook according to consumption, so I had no waste. I will save the remainder for future appetizers. I too added parmesan, onion and garlic. Next time I will also add Jack cheese too.

For as easy as this dish is, it tastes great! The benfits are obvious: you can make it ahead and it only takes a few ingredients that are readily available.

I served it for an anniversary dinner, and it turned out to be the crowned jewel of the meal!

I make Spanakopitta often. To save time I use 2 frozen packages of spinach, thawed and squeezed. Instead of making triangles I layer 10-12 phyllos in a 13x9 pyrex, each brushed with butter, then the spinach mixture and again the rest of phyllos. I cut them in squares up to the spinach layer. I Sprinkle the very top phyllo with a bit of water, so phyllo want crinkle and then I add sesame seeds (optional). Saves me a lot of time. Once baked cut re-cut and serve with a wedge of fresh lemon. We love it!!!!!

When I make spanakopita I make them more of a main dish, my boyfriend loves them. I usually chop up a half a can or even a can of olives (we both love them), mix in some roasted garlic and throw in some extra feta, mozzarella and cheddar cheese. It helps make it a super-rich and yummy main course which is pretty delish with a nice greek salad and some garlic bread. I always have a tough time with the phyllo dough, but these are so yummy that it's worth the struggle.

Rating: 4
This was really excellent with the following additions that have been recommended by other reviewers: saute 1 onion and about 3 Tb. of chopped garlic before adding the spinach, and add lemon juice to the mixture at the end. Without those things I think it would have been lacking. I used 3 boxes of frozen spinach to save time - defrosted it and squeezed out all the liquid. I put in more like a rounded Tb. of filling per triangle. Everyone LOVED them.

Loved this! I added scallions, fresh parsley, lemon, and sauteed garlic as suggestsed by others. This recipe was fairly simple, though required a bit of time. I ended up with 36 pastries but still didn't use all the butter. They were far less greasy than any other spanokopita I've tried.

I have made this recipe twice in the last two weeks and both times were a huge hit with friends. Followed other reviewers' advice and sauteed finely chopped onions and garlic and a splash of lemon juice at the end (which added a lot of flavour) then popped them in the freezer and baked just before guests arrived. Served it with some homemade tsaziki - delish! The filo was also easy to handle. Great recipe!

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit. I made it several days in advance and froze the triangles. Just had to put them into the oven when the party began. The time spent preparing everything was worth my free time during the party. I didn't have time to add fresh garlic or onion. Instead, I added powdered garlic and dehydrated onions and it tasted wonderful. I'm usually not a fan of spanakopita but this is a great recipe.

This was a huge hit at a dinner party last night--but it was a bit time-consuming to make! I'd do it again, though. Definitely good pointers to add diced onion and garlic, and a bit of fresh lemon juice really brought it to life. I also sprinkled the buttered, uncooked tops with toasted sesame seeds. My boyfriend ate the few leftovers for breakfast, and said they were even better the next day (though the phyllo became a bit soggy).

Made these tonight for my book club tomorrow so we'll see how they go over. I thought they were a little boring so added some garlic to the second batch. I agree with the other reviewer that they will definitely take 'tweaking' gracefully. As for the phyllo, not too many difficulties even though this was my first attempt at it - but keeping it covered with the damp towel is an absolute must!

I agree it is time consuming but I have fun doing it. Another suggestion, to save time is to cut phyllo sheets into 2 instead of 4 and cut the large triangle in half. Also using frozen spinach saves time. Big Hit Everytime I make it!

Yummy! I mostly used the recipe as a general guideline, and they came out very tasty- I think this is a recipe that can take a lot of tweaking gracefully. As per other reviewers' suggestions, I added some eggs, lemon zest, parsley, shallot, & Parmesan cheese. Would also be very nice with fried mushrooms, crispy bacon, or extra feta-- or all three. The phyllo was a bit time-consuming, but not really difficult. (I ripped the sheets a lot, but since you layer two it doesn't really matter.) I also used frozen spinach, which made them faster & cheaper than fresh would have been (though I bet fresh would be terrific!). Definitely a do-again, and a great appetizer.

Good recipe. These "triangles" are called spanakopitakia ( small spanakopitas ) as spanakopita is baked in a pan and then cut into slices or squares. Original ingredients : Spinach, feta, green onion, onion, dill, parsley, salt, pepper, olive oil. Yoy may add green herbs such as basil, chives, etc...and "Kali Orexi" (Bon Appetite !)

I served this to friends at a post-Thanksgiving party and everyone loved it! I, however, felt that the feta to spinich ratio was somehow off. I would suggest less feta; the taste was a little overpowering. Perhaps a mild feta could be used for those who do not particularly like a strong feta flavor.

Rating: 3
A little time consuming, but the result was absolutely worth it. I took other reviewers' advice and added 1/2 cup chopped parsley, around 1/2 tsp dried oregano and juice from 1/2 lemon. I think these additions really made the dish delicious. Also, the filling was enough for the entire box of fillo, not just the 10 sheets that the recipe calls for. They freeze really well too.

Wish I could give it a 3.5 - there are very few dishes I consider to be in the beyond compare category. These however are great and fun to make. My teenage daughter and her friend and I made them as a do ahead for the first course of Thanksgiving dinner (paired with a tomato basil bisque and carrot & coriander soup). Once I taught them how to handle the phyllo they had a lot of fun making them and baking a sample to check for flavor. Only advice would be if you are making ahead and freezing, put them on some parchment paper on a cookie sheet - mine stuck and I couldn't remove them from the cookie sheet before baking without breaking the bottom sheet of the phyllo. Will plan to make some more just to have in the freezer for impromptu parties/neighborhood get togethers (as the previous reveiwer indicated they will store much longer than 3 days if they are well hidden!)

This recipe will be good, but it could be better. I got a spanakopita recipe from a great Greek restaurant and with mine, you put alot more ingredients in than this one on the site. For instance, add a bit of lemon juice, a few chopped mushrooms, and get creative with spices. Also, these can be frozen for much longer than 3 days. . .like 3 mos. But it is good! And it's alot easier than you think.
