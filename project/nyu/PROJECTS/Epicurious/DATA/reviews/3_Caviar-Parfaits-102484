I thought these were just glorified latkes. This is the first recipe I wasn't thrilled about off this site. The presentation is nice if you copy the picture, but then the red onion is way too strong raw and the the Pancakes weren't good cool. For the second batch I sacrificed appearance for warm crunchy potatoes but the dish still did nothing to warrant the use of caviar. The caviar just got lost. I did like the tip about lightly baking the potatoes before shredding and will do that again....when I am actually trying to make latkes.

I made this recipe for my parents when they came to visit me. They loved it and were very impressed with the presentation. This is what I call a "fancy-schmancy" appetizer. It's not difficult at all, but looks like the kind of appetizer one would be served at a posh restaurant. What I like about this recipe is much of it can be prepared ahead of time. I will be serving this as the first course for my New Year's dinner party.

This was truly delicious and elegant.I served it as a first course at a dinner party with champagne.My guests raved and raved.It is easy to make if you have all the ingredients prepared and chopped ahead of time. The sauce needs to sit in refrig for several hours to firm up before using. I followed the recipe as written except I add only a small dash of horseradish to the recipe so as not to overpower it with the taste of horseradish. I followed the picture, drizzling the basil oil and sprinkling the fresh chopped chives on the plate. Impressive and so delicious.
