WOW! This salad is fantastic! I added a tbls. of fish sauce to the dressing and used mangoes instead of plums. Let the squid completely curl up and then slice - the presentation looks great that way! My guests LOVED it.

I thought this recipe was fabulous. I questioned if my husband would enjoy it and made it more as a salad for him and entree for me. After three helpings - the man who does not eat leftovers was asking for more the next day. Very refreshing light and full of flavor. Can't wait to make it again.

My local fish store was out of squid, so I made this with shrimp instead. It had a nice balance between chili heat, sour lime, and fresh herbs. The grilled plums were great alongside. I also roasted sweet potato chunks with chili powder and lime juice to add some heft. I would proudly serve this for company in hot weather.

We made this for a memorial day bbq and it was fantastic. It pairs well with grilled beef main courses, or works alone for a really light supper.

We liked it. After I made it, I looked at the picture, and it looks like they used a lot less cabbage than I did. I stretched mine out to an entree (and did not use the tentacles, as I had used them in this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=107561&kw=squid+vinaigrette&action=filtersearch&filter=recipe-filter.hts&collection=Recipes&ResultTemplate=recipe-results.hts&queryType=and&keyword=squid+vinaigrette&x=0&y=0 Next time I will water the dressing down a little, or use milder vinegar. It was a little too tart for us. Also, there are no plums in winter, so I used some dried plums that were reconstituted with a little boiling water before grilling. These worked fine, and may be an improvement over fresh ones because they add a little texture.

excellent! add a few limes and a good helping of chile paste. and sprinkle about a quarter cup of thinly sliced red onion on top and a few slices of cucumber. absolutely delicious.

Seasoned rice wine vinegar can be found in the vinegar/dressing aisle of most grocery stores. It is next to the plain or unseasoned rice wine vinegar. I use the brand Marukan in the pacific northwest.

This is a very tasty, fresh salad. I was curious as to whether it might have some particularly dominant, odd flavor, but it was really a wonderful balance. I wouldn't hesitate to prepare this ahead of time and serve it chilled. I bought squid "tubes" (just the body), which made the preparation easier. Taste the dressing before putting it on, I found that it benefited from a bit of extra salt.

I believe seasoned rice vinegar is the type of rice vinegar used to make sushi rice. For this recipe I would use 4 tsp. of sugar and a scant 1/2 tsp. salt. Heat the rice vinegar, sugar and salt, stirring, until sugar is dissolved. Although there are other kinds of seasoned rice vinegar, this is generally what is meant. Seasoned rice vinegar is also available in stores- probably all over in Japan! Tell us how you fared with this interesting recipe!

Having grown up in Kansas but having lived the past 15 years in Osaka, I tend to agree with the first review -- it will be great or gross. The combination of ingredients is queer to say the least, but this only tempts me to try it. Now, can someone explain what "seasoned rice vinegar" is, please? Are we talking seasoned as in aged or seasoned as in flavoured with spices?

I find it strange this aversion to squid. It has a wonderful texture and flavor. This recipe is not for the timid although it is very simple. The most difficult thing about this recipe is finding the ingredients. I am fortunate to have an Asian grocery nearby.

Would someone please make this and give a review? It is either going to be great or totally gross! I don't see my kids eating it either way, but I just wanted to know.
