Loved it. Tasted great with all the butter, but will prob use less and add olive oil instead next time. Think I might use this to stuff roasted veggies or game hens. Agree with previous suggestion to toast the sliced almonds. This recipe makes a TON! Lots of leftovers, but I even enjoyed a bowl of this for breakfast.

Really good and very simple to make. I made a half recipe and added about 5 cups finely chopped spinach with the bulgur. I used the full amount of cranberries, and also added the seeds of 1/2 a pomegranate when I put in the almonds. I ate about a quarter of this straight out of the pot!

Very easy & yummy. Toasting the almonds is key. You can make it a bit healthier by using a tablespoon or two of butter and substituting oilve oil for the remaining fat. Kids even loved it.

I was looking for a way to cut the calories on this, so I halved the recipe - it still serves 6 as a side. Technically, you could reduce the butter a bit as well, but it's really good with all of that butter.

This was very good!! However, it serves way more than 6 people!! I would make half the recipe amount next time. I made it for Easter dinner - I had 6 guests and had way too much (almost more than double) leftover.

This recipe had a really high yield! It was absolutely delicious as a side to salmon. Everyone asked for seconds and I'm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch.

I didn't have leeks so I substituted a combination of yellow onion and scallions. Also, I used dried cherries instead of cranberries. It turned out great! It was so simple and easy to make. I had leftovers so I served cold the next day for lunch and added fresh chopped scallion.

I have prepared this dish for several parties. It is great for showers, small gatherings, etc. especially for groups of ladies. It is filling with lots of great flavor and is perfect if you have vegetarians in your group - you can substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth. This can be served hot or cold, can be made the day ahead, etc. I would be sure to toast the almonds just before you serve so they don't get soggy. I usually serve with asparagus tossed in lemon and olive oil and yeast rolls (I cheat and use Sister Schubert's - they are excellent). I will continue to make this great dish.
