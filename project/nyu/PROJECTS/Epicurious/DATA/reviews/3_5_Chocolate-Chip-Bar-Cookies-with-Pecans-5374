This is a very versatile and forgiving recipe. I use butter - one cup less what is used to butter the pan. I like to add oatmeal (1 to 1 & 1/2 cups) and vanilla. I have even used half of the whole wheat white flour and no one knows the difference. For an easy bar cookie, these are delicious. Thank you to all the comments to help everyone just make these. Wish I had this when my son was in school and told me at 9:15 pm he needed a snack for school or Scouts the next day!

I also used butter instead of shortening, added 1T vanilla as someone suggested. Delish!

great basic recipe

The recipe was just ok. I wasn't particularly pleased with using shortening - I don't think it added anything. They were really just so-so. Certainly there is a better recipe.

I made this recipe with almonds and added about 3/4 c. Skor bits as well as the chocolate chips. (also used a combo of butter and shortening. They disappeared so quickly and now I get requests for them all the time. Bonus is they are so simple to make.

I was able to obtain only about half the amount of chocolate chips, but found that quite adequate. I also used butter instead of shortening. I'd double the pecans - taking care not to chop them too finely - and add some vanilla if I made the recipe again.

I made this without the pecans and used 1 cup of softened butter instead of shortening. This is a very good bar cookie that can be made quickly secondary to the more simplified ingredient list when compared to my other chocolate chip cookie recipes. Next time I may add vanilla. At any rate, these were gone in no time.

Have rarely made a recipe from epicurious that was 'so so' but this one was it. Made it as instructed and it was too thick of a bar and dry after a day or so. I'll stick to the bar recipes on the back of the choc chip bags next time.

This was delicious and so easy to make. I brought it to work and the cookie bars were finished in no time and I gave the recipe out as well. Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe twice -- once with chocolate chips and walnuts (no pecans on hand) and again with peanut butter chips and no nuts. Both turned out wonderfully and got rave reviews at our barbecue. Only change was to use 3/4 cups of butter and 1/4 cup Crisco and rather than melting the butter, I just had it at room temperature. Rich and delicious, though I cooked both batches longer than the recipe said. My 8-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter loved preparing this with me -- and nibbling on the chips! A definite keeper!

I used half butter and half butter flavored Crisco with excellent results. The Crisco makes for a chewier texture than the all butter version. I did make the mistake of trying to stir in the chocolate while the mixture was still warm and came out with basically brownies. The next I let the batter cool before adding the chips and hoopty-damn doo! Perfect butterscotch-y bar goodness! I rock.

I used a cup of butter and broke up a couple of bittersweet candy bars in place of the chocolate chips, and the recipe came out great - moist and scrumptious.

A good cookie bar recipe that's easy to make. I too used 1 cup butter instead of shortening. There's nothing spectacular about this dessert, but it's a good, dependable recipe.

YUM! A giant chocolate chip cookie was my husband's birthday request. I found this recipe and he couldn't get enough of it! I used the 1 lb of butter, as suggested and meant to add the vanilla, but forgot. I cooked it for 45 mins, and the center was still a little gooey, but in that yummy-cookie-dough-sort-of way. It didn't seem like it wasn't cooked or anything. Guests even asked to take a piece home with them! (Hubby wasn't too happy about sharing!) ;-)

Very easy and good bar cookie recipe. I also used 1 cup of butter and I added the vanilla and 1/2 cup of cocanut. I sent these to Iraq to a friend of mine who was there with the Air Force working in one of Saddam's palaces. She said that she loved the bars and so did everyone else whom she shared them with!

Replaced shortening with butter (1 cup)and found this to be a pretty good bar cookie.

My 12-year old daughters love making and eating this recipe. I have them line the baking pan with foil so easy to remove and then slice. We've made no changes and have been very satisfied.

I also used one cup of butter instead of the shortening. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. It was a big success at the meeting where I served it.

A friend made this recipe and brought it too work. I generally don't eat sweets and couldn't resist eating three of these bar cookies. I also asked and have made the recipe numerous times. My friend also added 1/2 cup of flaked coconut which adds a nice twist. These cookies are good warm but taste even better the next day or day after.

I have much better recipes for bar cookies so I won't be making this one again.

A quick and easy recipe that everyone loved - adults and kids alike. I have a six month old and a 3 year old so am looking for more great bar cookie recipes like this one (so much simpler to bake than individual cookies!). Would especially like one for oatmeal-chocolate chip bar cookies. My only changes to this one were substituting a half a cup butter and half cup shortening for the 2/3rds cup shortening that the recipe called for. Also, I substituted a cup of butterscotch chips for the pecans. Very moist and delicious. Will definitely make again!

I used a cup of butter and added a half cup of shredded coconut. It took closer to an hour. Co-workers were offering me money for the recipe. They were excellent.

I make this recipe 3-4 times a month. My kids as well as the rest of the neighborhood love them! I have altered the recipe slightly. I use 1 cup of shortening instead of 2/3 cup. I also use several kinds of chips: milk chocolate, semi sweet chocolate, dark chocolate and peanut butter. I find that they need to stay in the oven an extra 10 minutes or so.

Not a bad cookie and you can make it into individual round cookies as well. Just remember not to put too much batter for one cookie and place the mixture far from each other. They spread like crazy. Took them to a soccer match and they disappeared in seconds!!
