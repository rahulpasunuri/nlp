Would make this recipe again but not bake, instead lightly fry in olive oil. The baking makes the papers crispy but with no flavor and hard -- doesn't add to taste or eating experience. Inside vegetables taste excellent.

I made them with a few modifications. I used a sprinkle of ginger powder, since I don't like the strong flavor of fresh ginger. For veggies, I used green onion, garlic, carrots, yellow pepper, a little spinach and bean sprouts. I also brushed them before baking them with oil. They came out quite nice. Not quite as crispy as deep fried, but definitely a good low-fat alternative. I served them with plum sauce, skipping the sauce recipe.

I was very disapointed with this recipe. I was excited to try a lower fat version of fried springrolls, but they were so bad that I will never stray again. Even with extra oil brushed of the wrappers and extra seasoning in the filling, these were very boring, and the wrappers never really tasted right. Next time I want low fat spring rolls, I will just make fresh rolls, same amount of time for much better flavor.

Delish! My husband doesn't even like vegetables, and this was a hit. Very easy to make... I drizzled a little sesame oil over the top of each roll prior to baking to give it a little extra flavor and brownness.

I love this recipe and must make it at least once a month. add crushed red pepper to the sauce for some zip.

I loved these rolls. I used the advice of one of the other reviewers and brushed them with sesame oil before baking. I made them for my husband and his friend. I will definately double the batch the second time so that we can enjoy them longer. I didn't even try the dipping sauce but used teriyaki sauce.

I made recipe as worded and egg rolls never got crispy at all. I think I must have overcooked vegetables and thus they were too soggy. Keep veggies at crisp-cooked stage!

These rolls were exceptionally crispy and healthful. We loved them very much, however, the sauce left something to be desired.

The rolls are good and pretty healthy. My husband and I thought the sauce was disgusting! We ate them dry. If a good sauce could be found they would be really pretty good. They weren't the best ever but nice to make and get some vegetables in!

Time consuming, but well worth the effort. Got lots of raves even though I substituted for some of the veggies. Brushed a little bit of oil on top of the rolls just before baking to enhance crispiness.

These egg rolls will make you want to never eat the deep fried version again. They are much lighter and more flavorful. I didn't have good luck with the dipping sauce, though. For extra crunch spray both sides of the egg rolls with a cooking spray and turn during cooking.
