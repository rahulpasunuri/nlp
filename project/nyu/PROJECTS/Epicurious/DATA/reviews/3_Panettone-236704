This was good, I used the paper molds. I still think the best recipe was the one from Gourmet, December 2008. Its probably not in this data base because it was in the Kitchen Notebook piece for that month. Thank heaven I cut it out!!

I made the recipe exactly as written but I used disposable panettone molds instead of the coffee cans. They were delicious! However I think I got a little carried away with the flour or something because it came out too crumbly, I couldn't cut a neat slice. That is why I think all bread recipes should be written in weights! Anyways, to comment on the other review with the lemon juice warning: I added it to mine and the rising times were right on. Finally, to those of you want to use good quality citron, I got mine at fantes.com.

Do not use lemon juice in your recipe! I made this twice, following the directions and both times had a heavy result. The recipe is lovely, but lemon juice will retard the yeast's action, so using the zest only is the way to go.

Made citron recipe from this site. A good holiday classic and good bread pudding or french toast from left overs. I baked it for longer then recipe instructed. Home made citron with grapefuit and oranges much better then the cloying store bought atrocities.

1. first and second rise should be a flour/liquid only mixture to get the yeast working. 2. add all other ingredients for the third rising which takes place in the baking pan. 3. make your own candied orange peel - easy and wonderful - keeps in refrigerator for ever.

Not really a recipe, but this made me think of something I just read about receiving a Panettone as an annual Christmas gift (http://www.oneforthetable.com/oftt/stories/xmas-on-your-doorstep.html) - it has inspired me to make one, taking the advice of the commenters on this recipe.

If you're looking for an authentic panettone, look for the December 2008 Gourmet. The recipe does not yet appear here on Epicurious (perhaps it will once the magazine is on newsstands), but it produces the most incredible panettone. A wonderfully dense yet light crumb. The only required ingredient not listed in the recipe is patience. The first rising is 12-15 hours and the second is 3-5 hours!

To the cook who had trouble having it rise in the alloted time, if you were using a metal mixer bowl it might be that the milk you heated up to the right temperature became too cool due to the metal bowl absorbing the heat.

I would agree with the other reviewer, this turned out more like a cake than a bread or the panettone I am familiar with (imported from Italy). I will look for another recipe for next time.

Skip the fruit & try semi sweet chocolate pieces.

I am not a real citrus fan. Has anyone tried making this with cherries or any other fruit?

Ultimately, this recipe can make excellent and delicious panettone, but in my opinion it is not quite right and there a few things not mentioned that you should keep in mind if you decide to try it. I have a jar of Fleischman's active dry yeast that I use regularly to bake whole wheat bread (I don't often buy bread) which is fairly new and works wonderfully and I used that for this recipe. It started fine but then the dough didn't seem to be adding much bulk (as a few others have noted). My kitchen tends to be about 72degF. I consider that warm. However, when I got the dough into an ~80degF environment I started to see some results. Still the first proofing took around five hours total. I was testing this recipe out so I just let it go until I thought it was ready. I was unable to babysit the dough for the second proofing and honestly had sort of given up on it, but it actually came through, even though it took an incredible 12 hours(!) to make it over the tops of the cans. Also I found that the correct baking time is probably closer to 50 minutes . I also had no problems getting the loaves out of the cans and the end result was delicious and not yeasty and just the right texture (even better with a little mascarpone!). I intend to make this recipe again in a day or two and this is what I intend to do differently: 1)use about 1/2t more yeast (often those packages have a little more than 2t in them anyway) 2)work the dough longer. i've read in various other places that panettone dough should be worked at least 20 min by machine or 50 mins by hand. i don't think i'll go that far but i'll give it a little extra time 3)let rise in an 80degF environment. a 12 hour proofing is for the birds and the refrigerator method is right out. good luck and be patient.. don't ever try out a new recipe in a time crunch!

I give baked goods for Holiday presents and thought I'd try panettone this year. I first tried another recipe with about 1/3rd more flour than this recipe called for. While flavorful it was too dense. With this recipe I needed the full three hours for each proofing but got a tripling in size both times. Allow this bread to cool fully, more than 1 hour, before slicing. Cut it too soon and it will tear rather than slice. I thought it was delicious.

This was amazing-- much better than anything I have ever bought from a store. We followed the recipe exactly, except we didn't have Marsala, so we used cognac. It was great. I also didn't have coffee cans, so I made mine in a tube pan, and that worked out perfectly. Definitely worth the effort.

I love panettone so much that I wanted to try out this recipe to see if I'm able to make it at home. This was my first time making panettone. I already had experience making bread before, but I didn't know what texture the panettone dough should be. Mine got very wet and sticky. It was definitely too wet. I should've added more flour to it, but I continued with the whole process anyway. I didn't bake mine in a coffee can. Instead, I baked the whole portion in a 2 lb. bread mold. Well, my dough was so wet that it was extremely easy to deflate. I didn't brush egg wash on mine before baking since touching it in anyway would completely deflate it, but I did brush on a layer after it's been baked and settled for about 10 minutes. In the end, the panettone had more of a cake than bread texture. It wasn't as rich as the kind that is being sold in the store. It was somewhat of a disappointment. I guess I'll continue my search for the perfect panettone recipe...

I made this sweet bread last winter and it was wonderful. I also covered the top with foil to prevent it from darkening too much. The flavor was excellent and it was a beautiful presentation.

I have not made this eyt but am responding to the person who asked where to get the high quality candied citron. I buy mine from the King Arthur Bakers Catalogue. They have high quality unsulphered european candied orange and lemon peel.

I added about 1 extra cup of fruit as well, I like fruit, and the yeast did its foaming thing so I know it started well. But, it never doubled in bulk. Never! At 2 hours I turned the oven on to warm the stove top where the dough sat and at 3 hours it was maybe 1/4 size larger than originally. Instead of putting in the fridge after punching down I left on the counter hoping for it to rise. It did not. I never split the dough because it never doubled and was quite gummy. I am currently in the 70 minute range of baking this bread...twice that recommended. I have covered the top with foil to avoid burning as I bake and bake and bake. I might try this recipe again because there is always the chance I missed a step but at this point I am very disappointed. It looks pretty though.

Although I have no idea what traditional panettone should taste like, but this was really good! I didn't find high quality citron ( I was worried about finding ANY). It still came out well! I also didn't use coffee cans, as I did not have any on hand. Instead, I put the dough in 2 8 in. loaf pans. It came out very pretty and tasty!

This is a delicious recipe and reminds me of my days in Italy. I too used mixed candied fruit from the supermarket and it is fine. I had no trouble with the coffee cans lined with parchment - the loaves came out easily. One trouble I had was the dome breaking away when removing the loaf from the coffee can. After the first batch I covered the tops of the loaves with foil after about ten minutes in the oven and that cut down on the burning on top. The last batch of dough was rather slack and dripped down the outside of the cans so I've made a note to add more flour (if needed) to make the dough a little stiffer.

Where in the world would you find"quality candied citron", Not from the supermarket? That's the only place I've ever seen it and what I used. It was still delicious.

I'm not rating this yet since I haven't tried making it - but I am wary that after all the work making the dough, it will stick to the can after baking no matter how much butter you use to grease the cans. So toss the cans and buy the paper molds that are used to bake this delightful bread. They are available online and in many fine cooking stores.
