This would be my last meal if I had hours to live. I have had it in Thai restaurants as "Tom Yum" . Don't skimp on anything and you will be rewarded!

Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow. I made the chicken stock because, well, once you start making your own stock you never go back. Another reviewer states that doing so means you are making stock not once but twice. True. However, I wanted extra stock for other uses, so I went ahead and wasted the time. The only changes I made to the recipe were substituting tamarind paste for fresh tamarind and using lime peel instead of the kaffir lime leaves. Ah, but I also left the broth plain, and added in julienned carrot and snow peas, fried tofu, chiffonade basil, and cubed (cooked) chicken right before serving. The barely-cooked crispness of the vegetables, combined with the silky broth and meaty tofu and chicken...perfect. Rice would only bog this down.

Excellent. A few tweaks here and there like using lime zest and juice instead of the kafir leaves, and lemon juice and brown sugar instead of tamarind. Also used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and added mushrooms, cilantro and tofu. Used homemade stock from a roasted chicken so all in all, it took three days to make this soup. Glad to have some leftovers. I do think using the brown sugar/lemon mixture helped correct the acidic balance. Got rave reviews from my husband.

Wow - so flavourful and tasty! It was a bit overwhelming at first but I quickly grew to love it. I might add a tiny bit of sugar as one reviewer suggested - my hubby definitely found this a bit tart. A lovely, lovely base.

This is a yummy soup. As you enjoy the soup your taste buds pick up a delightful multi-level depth of flavors. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding mushrooms along with the chicken and simmering the chicken & mushrooms for another 20 minutes. I did not have lime leaves, so I substituted lime zest and lime juice.

I LOVE this soup! I added a can of light coconut milk and served it with some thin noodles. A big "Thank you" to katendesign for the info on buying my own kaffir tree! I just ordered one: ediblelandscaping.com for $20.

This soup was quite good but there are a few things that I would change when I make it again. First, I did make my own chicken stock that was very close to the "rich and flavorful" stock listed here. What I don't really understand is why the second step of the recipe couldn't be combined w/the stock prep. Basically, you have to make stock twice w/this soup. I do suggest making the stock the night before so you can skim the fat off. I cut all the ingredients for the first and second step and feel like I wasted a lot of time since they are just strained out in the end. I recommend leaving the garlic, lemongrass, and shallots in more of a rough chop when you brown them and doing the same for the ginger in the stock cooking. Secondly, this soup is VERY tart when prepared like this. My wife (who is from Vietnam) recommended adding a little sugar to the soup as it was cooking since we tasted it often and found it to be over the top on the sour scale. The only thing that I changed from the original recipe was to use fresh tomatoes in place of the canned ones so that could make a small difference but I highly recommend adding a little (1 tablespoon or so) sugar to the stock as you cook it. Of course, that is an individual taste thing... Over all, this is a very good, fairly unusual dish and I will make it again. I didn't feel like adding rice at the end to my bowl really helped the flavors much but otherwise, I enjoyed it very much!

This recipe is a definite keeper. I browned the shallots and garlic, but then just put everything else in the pot at once. I used lemongrass paste, halved the peppers and then sliced very thinly and minced up ginger so I could follow other reviewer's advice not to strain the broth. Definitely don't strain the broth. The only thing I would do differently next time is to use bonelss chicken thighs rather than breasts. The breast meat was flavorless and dry and did not fit with the rest of the soup. Otherwise, it was fabulous!

I started the day before and made my own chicken stock with all of a chicken except the breast (saved for another dish - this soup was delicious with mostly dark meat). Cooled it to skim off the fat and picked the chicken off the bones. The next day I made the broth with a jalapeno and lemon zest substitutions, though I do grow lime leaves in the kitchen. (didn't sieve but spooned out nost of the solids) and in last 20 min put in 1/2 cup of Jasmine rice and the tomatoes (not very Thai?). Last 10 min, left-over chicken, peas and basil. We loved this soup.

The first time we made this we followed the recipe exactly. It was superb. Solely to add variety, we use this base and add all kings of things; oyster mushrooms, wild rice, juice from fresh lemon and limes, baby bok choy, garlesto (garlic and basil) frozen from the season's end- whateva! It is that good. Sometimes we strain, sometimes not. I grow lots of lemon grass, so I cut several stalks, keep them long and smash them instead of chopping and I just take them out before we add the chicken and etc. This has already become our winter staple, and it isn't even winter yet.

If you can't get tamarind, a good substitute is one fourth cup dark brown sugar, 3 T fresh lemon juice, one half tsp. molasses combined and heated to dissolve sugar. This is from Sheila Lukins All Around the World Cookbook.

Excellent! Especially to knock out a cold. I also left all the good bits in, and only strained out the lemongrass. I love to eat the slices of garlic and ginger.

The tamarind overwhelmed the soup and made it too salty, so i would recommend using less in order to taste the basil. It was ok but just way too salty.

Delicious! I substituted the peeled zest of one lemon for the lemongrass (and sauted it with the first few ingredients) and 2 tbs of fresh lime juice for the lime leaves. Both flavors came through and melded perfectly with the rest. I'll add mushrooms next time.

This soup is delicious and not difficult. I will definitely make it again.

I know this will be delicious and will make it tonight. For all those looking for Kafir leaves go to ediblelandscaping.com and order your own tree. They grow well in pots and the fresh leaves are beyond compare, plus they have very fragrant limes.

I loved this soup. I couldn't find the kaffir lime leaves either (will go to Whole Foods next time, thanks), and substituted lime zest. The only thing I would do differently is to make a double batch of the broth and freeze half. I added some slivers of pepper and some baby bok choi. It was great!

To the reviewer in Philadelphia: I live in Haddonfield, NJ, and I buy kafir lime leaves all the time at Whole Foods. I'm sure they will have them at the WF in the city. If they don't for some reason, they're also available for order on the internet. Good luck! And by the way, I just made this soup--delicious!

The combined flavors of this are amazing. I love Thai food but have never made it. When I saw this recipe and already had fresh chicken and stock I thought I would buy a few ingredients and it would be simple. However, I went to eight (yes eight) stores (in Chinatown, Reading Terminal and Washington Avenue) and none had Kafir leaves and I was finally told it is illegal to sell them here. Hmmm... (If anyone has the name of a place in Philadelphia where I can get them PLEASE let me know). So once I finally gave up the mission to find kafir and got my prep work underway, substituting about 1t. of lime zest for the kafir; chopping the lemongrass very finely, diluting the tamarind, it was very easy. However, I didn't particularly like the chicken with the soup and I took that out and added some shrimp I had in the freezer. I also added some mushrooms and spinach because I wanted more vegetables than the recipes calls for. It was absolutely delicious and I will definitely make it again -- with additional vegetables and without chicken.

Fantastic! I subbed the Lime leaves and used Lime zest. (i could not find the leaves) I will make this all the time! I like the shrimp Idea. I will try that next.

This was really delicious, but I made a few changes that I think could have made a big difference. I added half a bunch of cilantro with the basil at the end, upped the garlic to three HUGE cloves, and halved the diced tomatoes (just didn't seem very Thai to me I guess...) But probably the most important thing is DON"T STRAIN ALL THE GOODNESS AND FLAVOR OUT OF THE SOUP LIKE IT TELLS YOU TO. Why you would strain out the aromatics and vegetables from the broth I certainly don't know. But if you do not strain it, there is one problem. Lemongrass can be quite tough and you don't want to be qchwing on hard stalks as you eat the soup; however, there is a simple solution to this problem. In most grocery stores they sell tubes of lemon grass (pasted) near the fresh herbs (They often sell tubes of pasted garlic and ginger as well next to the lemongrass, but you should definately always buy fresh ginger and garlic). If you use this paste, you won't have to strain the broth. They don't sell tamarind or lime leaves where I lived, so I used long strips of lime zest ad a squeeze of lime for the leaves and just omitted the tamarind. The snow peas were fantastic in this (fortunately the snow peas at the store were fresh and crisp the day I made this)! Overall, delicious!

Delicious! A little time consuming but so worth it. The only substitution I made was Chinese long beans instead of snow peas. Next time I'll try shrimp instead of chicken.

Huge fan of Thai and live near a store where even the Kaffir lime leaves were freah today. So I followed the directions to a tee, using all of the right ingredients. We sat down to a beautiful steaming bowl of this soup and I was so disappointed! It totally lacked the depth of flavor that was promised. I use this site all the time with great success,but this just wasn't worth the time and effort.
