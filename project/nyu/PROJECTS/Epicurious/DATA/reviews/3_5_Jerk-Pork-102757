I forgot to mention in my 26 June review that we grilled the Jerk Chops according to the method described in the Epicurious recipe for Grilled Giant Pork Chops with Adobo Paste. It worked perfectly. Very tender and no burnt paste.

This was fantastic! Definitely going into the repetoire. We used this on chops and they turned out so flavourful and tender! I followed the recipe with the exception of: I used only one anaheim pepper and I added about an 1/8 of a cup of pineapple juice. This is a winner.

Love the concept but the taste is all wrong. I am no master chef but I am Jamaican. I've been catering with my mother for years and even some of the ingredients are incorrect. Its a good taste but its not Jamaican Jerk.

LOVED THIS! I actually cooked it in my slow cooker without marinating. Put all the ingredients right in the crock for 4-5 hours on low, and it was delicious! Shredded up excellently. The only think I will do differently next time (and there will be a next time!) is not to salt. The flavors in a crock pot become very concentrated, which I loved for the other seasonings, but felt it was a little too salty. Next time I will cook the same, but salt to taste when serving. I made this to accompany the black bean cakes, but will be eating the leftovers stand-alone!

I doubled the amount of this marinade (not the jalapenos, though) for two pounds of pork tenderloin. The results were amazing. I think we're using this as a dinner during the Christmas holidays - it was that good and that easy.

Great recipe! If you love flavorful dishes, this jerk sauce is excellent - don't be afraid of using the hot peppers, even WITH the seeds as the pork will absorb the flavors and provide for a terrific dish. I prefer to use pork shoulder, and about 4-5 lbs of it. This sauce recipe, doubled, will more than do the trick. I've made this many times and it is an amazing winner among friends.

I made this rub with pork chops, topped it with pineapple salsa, and served it with sweet potato fries. I also mixed a little pineapple juice with sour cream and put a drop of that on top...all I can say is YUMMY! My husband who thinks that pineapples served with meat should be illegal even loved it...and he took the left overs to work with him for lunch (always a sign of success). It's so easy and tasty...you've gotta try it!

I think this recipe is delicious. We made hors d oeuvre size sandwiches by putting the shredded pork, topped with the scallions on tiny potato buns. I'm about to make it again right now.

First time I've tried a "Jerk" recipe. Maybe I'm just not used to cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg in a meat dish, but just didn't care for this one. My husband, who isn't picky, requestd that I not make this one again.

This is a great marinade. I had do make do with dried nutmeg and no allspice, but it turned out just fine. I added a little olive oil, which helped to keep the tenderloin I used moist. The marinade did burn rather easily, so I only grilled it part of the way and finished it up in a 400 degree oven, then served it as an entre. My family wants it again next week!

Yummy-used the marinade on pork tenderloins and then grilled and they were perfect! Only marinaded the pork for about 4 hours and the flavor was still great.

What a fantastic combination of flavors! I used the marinade on grilled pork chops. I did not puree the marinade - just coarsely chopped the scallion and chiles.

Very good. I marinated the pork for 8 hours, then butterflied and grilled it to serve as an entree. Started with 2 jalepenos, would probably use 3 next time, but that's just a matter of taste.

Pretty good. I liked the heat and the spice, but not an extraordinary dish.

YUM! This was great, and as close to real jerk as I have had outside of Jamaica. We used just 2 jalapenos, it was spicy enough for us. I thought shredding the pork was difficult,it was easier when the pork was sliced into slices thinner than the 1-inch-thickness recommended by the recipe.

This was very easy and really delicious. I doubled the amount of lime juice and the amount of soy sauce, plus I upped the nutmeg a bit - came out great. I ended up marinating it for probably 24 hours, which was fine. Instead of coupling this recipe with the one for red pepper mayo and bean cakes, I just used the meat in a sandwich with some roasted red peppers on top - the sweetness of the red pepper and the spiciness of the meat are wonderfully complentary - I will definitly try the mayo/bean cake portion of the recipe soon.

At my New Year's party, this was the first to go. People passed up much more difficult to make dishes for the jerk pork.

Beautifully tenderizes and adds succulent flavor to pork (also used with chicken and beef). I like to lessen the amount of allspice just a hair, though.
