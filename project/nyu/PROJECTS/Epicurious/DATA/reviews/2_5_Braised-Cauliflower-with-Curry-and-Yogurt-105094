As a weekday side dish, this is really a very good recipe. All I did to give it a kick was to add a 1/2 tsp of ground cumin. However, cook times are quite underestimated, at least for my stove top. I'd allow for more time at each stage.

Not very interesting. Following the advice of other reviewers, I doubled the amount of onion and carmelized them first.I more than doubled the amount of curry powder and substituted dry coriander because I did not have fresh. I also added lots of salt and pepper and even added fresh lemon juice at the end to brighten the taste. Still, just mediocre.

I would just like to clarify the issue regarding heating olive oil (or any oil). Some companies will heat the olives to extract the oil -- which makes the oil carcinogenic. Cold pressed olive oil, or expelled, is safe, even when heated in your pan (extra virgin for example). It's a misunderstanding. So, go ahead and do as the Greek do.

I hate to say it, but this was terrible. Just bland as could be - we were going to have dal as another side and I finally ended up dumping the dal into this and reducing it down to make this edible. Based on the cauliflower curry my bengali mom makes, I think this could be saved by (1) doubling or tripling the onion, and sauting it alone until caramelized before adding the cauliflower (2) doubling or tripling the curry powder and adding a little extra cayenne and turmeric (3) adding some minced fresh ginger and (4) adding at least a teaspoon of salt.

I added some fresh ginger and some grated coconut cream. I also used more curry powder. I had it with naan bread and chicken tikka masala. Truly delicious combo.

Highly recommended! A really excellent way to prepare cauliflower. Even my husband (who doesn't usually care for cauliflower) liked it. I served it with dal and basmati rice for a veggie dinner. As previous reviewers said, I recommend an extra teaspoon curry powder and a teaspoon of salt.

i found this recipe good but like the other reviewer subsituted sour cream instead of yoghurt fordepth of flavour. as for the comment made that olive olil becomes toxic when heated, this is true but only when heated to the smoking point, you should always use vegetable if you are using extreme heats.

This was really good. I used goat yogurt and substituted flat-leaf parsley for the cilantro. My partner went for seconds and that NEVER happens with vegetables.

I'm planning to make this dish, but I'm curious about a reviewer's comment that "olive oil becomes toxic when heated." If that is so, then Spain, Greece, Portugal and many other countries must be overwhelmed with olive oil victims. I'll add a serious review after the kitchen is remodeled, and I can resume normal cooking

I think the basis of the recipe is a good one, but based on other cooks' reviews, I did the following modifications: - use Ghee (indian style clarified butter) instead of olive oil (which becomes toxic when heated) - stir-fry onions and fresh galangal or ginger before putting the cauliflower in - use in 3 equal parts water, a thick bulgarian yogurt and coconut milk instead of just watered down yogurt - use some very good, fresh curry powder (2 1/2 teaspoons instead of 1) - serve with a spicy beef dish and some dahl, to counter the cauli's blandness. Oh, and also some cucumber raita. Namaste!

I agree this was very bland and boring and I added alot of curry. It just was missing something that I could not put my finger on.

I thought this was a very good way to prepare cauliflower. I doubled the curry and substituted sour cream for the yogurt. I didn't think it was bland at all, although it did need a bit of salt. I will defintley make this again.

Extremely bland and boring. I had to bog it down with salt and extra curry powder just to make it flavorful.

I loved it! It was quick and easy. I used more than 1 teaspoon of curry - because I'm a big curry fan. I'll definately make this again.
