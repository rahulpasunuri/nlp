This was really good and super easy to make. The flavors were great. My husband loved it and so did I. I only used one can of beans and diced tomatoes rather than whole, and went easy on the chili powder because I really wanted soup/stew rather than chili. I'll be making this again

Quite tasty and simple to make! I like a more tomatoey flavor in my chili, so used a 28 oz can, instead of 14.5 oz. Also, I only had ground pork on hand, so browned it in substitution for the cutlets--seemed to work well. Recommend this one for a cold winter's night.

I've never tried a pork chili but I had a tenderloin and two chops in the fridge that needed tending to so this is what I decided to make. In the middle of all the preparation I discovered that I had no tomatoes and it is a holiday here in Canada (Remembrance Day) so no stores. I ended up using some ripe tomatoes I had on hand so all the better. I also added moose meat to the pork to perk it up a bit. This is great. I would spice it up a bit more but I have little guys that wouldn't appreciate that. Good recipe.

This recipe was surprisingly good. It was a combination of a stew and a chili. Really hearty, yet simple flavor. My entire family raved about this recipe. I served this simply with cornbread. I did end up doubling the recipe to take advantage of the pork that I purchased.

Everyone I cook this for loves it and wants the recipe!! I've served it with warm cornbread as well as warm tortillas!!! Great after a day on the slopes.

Simple, fun and extremely good- i love it for Sunday lunch, and extending the cooking time allows for a leisurely wait while aromas flood the room.

I had 2 thick pork chops I needed to do something with. This did the trick. Served in bowls with cheese and cilantro, very tasty.

I've been making this recipe for years and years and it's always a hit. Good for a hearty lunch, a nice dinner, and a delightful breakfast with eggs. It all works.

This is a very simple and delicious recipe for a unique tasting pork chili. Will make this again and am already thinking about when. Unfortunately we were unable to taste it the second day as none was left from the first meal. Sooo goooood!

I was surprised that this chili has only two reviews and has been around for many, many years. I have been making this chili ever since the recipe was published and my family loves it. It is a nice change of pace from conventional chili. We always serve it with grated cheese and onion for the top along with warm flour tortillas for dunking!

This is a delightfully different chili. I surprise friends when I invite them over for "chili" and wine.

I live in Edinburgh Scotland, and subscribe to Bon Apetit. The taste of this chili took my husband and I back 15 years to the chili and baked potato meal we had on a skiing holiday in Crystal Mountain, Washington State. I am now going to try the other four chili dishes in The Great Chili Challenge. Definitely a treat in store. Nici Hill www.elmview.co.uk
