fabulous! thought it seemed a little too simple but refrained from making additions until I made the recipe once! didn't have pink pepercorns and also substituted gorgonzola - served it with the pears warm... so yummy

I must be missing something from all the reviews. I thought this was "fair" at best. The store was out of Ricotta Salata, so i used a thick slice of parmesan, which after grilling was a little chewy. I wasn't that impressed with the dressing either and I can't imagine the "pink" peppercorns making that must difference.

This was a reasonably easy salad that turned out to popular at parties. Ive now made it twice. I dealt with this within my limitations of not having an outside grill. I used a stovetop grill and grilled a variety of pearns available since I wasnt sure what would work best. They all worked. I was careful to flip them as soon as the grill lines became brown. It would be easy to burn them. Then I put them away in a container, overnight. Next, I did the same with Minouri cheese which was incredibly creamy and tasty. I had some luck grilling it the first time, the second time it broke up but it still tasted great. With the broken bits, it just looks like crumbled feta, which people liked anyway. I cut corners with shelled, roasted pistatios and mixed in some red leaf romain and spinach with the arugala. I love that it can be mostly made ahead and then served out on a platter for a party.

I modified the execution of the recipe quite a bit and it was still fantastic. I used small pears, sliced in quarters lengthwise and broiled them 4 minutes each side. Then I added grill marks with a wire skewer. I dry pan roasted the pistachios a few hours ahead so they had time to cool and get crisp (they're soft unless completely cooled). I didn't grill the cheese. I was tempted to use less honey in the dressing but stayed true to the recipe. I used Greek Manouri cheese and the sweetness was just the right amount for the subtle flavor of the cheese.

Although I used the use the basic concept it is February and grilling was not going to happen-- great recipe though-- I had a big bag of pistachios and I shelled a cup and broiled them till toasted in the oven, I peeled and sliced the pears and broiled them on both sides about 4-5 min per side (I sliced them using an apple slicer)-and the ricotta salata cheese I slice very thin-- the dressing was great-- I had sliced a bit of romaine to go w/my arugula and put the salad, pears, nuts and a slice of ricotta on top w/dressing and everyone loved it-- I doubled it and it easily feed 10--

I made this for a dinner party and it was excellent. Will do it again. As someone else recommended, I used a nice blue cheese instead of the grilled salata. I grilled the pears on an inside grill (cold out) and they were wonderful. I didn't have the pink peppercorns, which would have made it prettier (although my blue cheese added color); it was fine with black pepper.

Excellent salad!!!! The dressing has a terrific tangy flavor. I substituted a very nice gorgonzola for the cheese, used pecans (didn't have pistachios), and broiled the pears (too cold for the grill). The mix of the cheese flavor with the dressing was very good. I made it for a dinner party to rave reviews, but it was easy enough for a regular dinner too.

This salad was a hit with company. I tossed the arugula with some dressing and put it on small individual salad plates. After placing the grilled pears and cheese on top of the arugula, I sprinkled the salad with lightly toasted pistachio meats and drizzled more dressing on the pears and cheese. Next time I will NOT toss the arugula with the dressing first, but do as the recipe calls for and drizzle the dressing after assembly. I'll also use a dinner plate, rather than a salad plate, and drop a few drops of the dressing around the edges. I used Greek manouri cheese which I had the grocer cut to 3/4 inch rounds, and I grilled it on an indoor grill. It worked out fine. I used Bosc pears and put a pear half on each plate. It might have looked prettier if I had quartered the pears and put two quarters on the plate. I suggest buying pears ahead of time to let them ripen.I think the most distinctive and important ingredient in the dressing was the pink peppercorns. I would not use a substitute for them.
