Lots of chopping and the taste is not great. Will not try this again.

this soup has a subtle taste that blossoms beautifully on the palate. i agree that adding sautéed onions (or shallots) would be an excellent addition. it's also tremendously quick and easy in addition to being delicious.

This soup is really good & tasty! I omitted the water and instead used veggie broth. I also added some thyme, nutmeg, cayenne red pepper...fresh squeezed O.J. makes all the difference too! yummers!

Really good soup. Easy enough to make, kids liked it too. I didn't have sour cream on hand, as I live in Paris, normally I would substitute with crème fraiche or frommage blanc, but made do with yaourt grec (greek yogurt). Would look over the past reviews if I made it again, as people seem to LOVE this soup. Mine was delicious; but not quite exceptional.

I loved this soup and so did everyone I have served it to. I did make some additions however. I added 1 onion, sliced and sauteed with the fennel and garlic...and I used 4 cups chicken stock(Swanson's) and 2 cups vegetable stock (Knorr's) I also added a dollop of sour cream on top of the soup and garnished with the fennel leaves. Delicious!

Hands down, one of the best soups I've ever made (vegetarians, I urge you to try this recipe). But I altered a few things. Here's what I did differently: - I used a large fennel bulb. Even if you don't like fennel straight, you end up pureeing it anyhow, and fennel does this recipe nothing but favors. - I had some fresh pumpkin handy, so I threw in about a cup of that to substitute for a few of the carrots. If you were to double this recipe-- and I would, it was delicious-- you could probably use a whole small sugar pumpkin, pre-baked in the oven. More work, but SO worth it. - I used half a cup of sour cream. - I used my favorite veggie bouillon instead of water. I didn't use much, either, but it really helped and meant I didn't have to salt the finished product. Next time, I might reduce the water amount to 5 cups for a thicker consistency. - I used half a cup of orange juice. Someone said it gets lost in this recipe, and I'd say that might be true with 1/4 cup. With a 1/2 cup, it adds a subtle finishing touch. The recipe says this makes 8 cups of soup? Well, boyfriend and I ate all but 2, which will be lunch today.

This soup was so easy to make and perfect for a summer night. I served it with a baguette w/radish butter on the side. It was far from flavorless, just subtle and delicious.

The concept of carrot, fennel and orange together is wonderful. I'm sorry to say it just didn't work. Often I'll read review and think "they said bland -- maybe the taste is just subtle," but in this case, it was just plain bland. I may try roasting the vegetables and seeing if that works. Also, 1/3 cup of orange juice gets totally lost with this volume of solids and liquids.

Simple yet elegant, this soup makes a wonderful starter or a delicious light summer meal with fresh bread and a green salad. Unlike most of the reviewers, I'd never use chicken broth in this dish; instead I deglaze the pan with a little white wine, vermouth, or even sherry, which preserves the light, delicate flavor of the carrots and fennel. It's been a great hit with my friends, vegetarian and omnivorous alike. Be sure to use sweet carrots (buy with the greens still on so you know they're fresh) and freshly squeezed orange juice for the best flavor. I always garnish with fennel leaves and coarsely ground black pepper.

oops! in addition to other changes i also replaced half the water with fresh chicken stock. still i think the basic recipe is worth the go, just adjust some to your tastes...

we loved this with the fresh fennel from the garden... but i did make a couple of adjustments to the recipe. added a dash of cayenne, a sprig of fresh lemon thyme and 2 slices finely minced candied ginger.... finished as suggested, then grated a tad of nutmeg on top and garnished with fennel fronds.

I made the following adaptations, and really enjoyed this soup: - Substitute chicken broth for water - Add: 1 tsp. ginger dash freshly grated nutmeg dash mace dash cayenne - Puree 2-3 cups of soup and return to pot at end, to improve color and texture The ginger makes all the difference!

Too bland for my taste. If I were to make this again, I would use chicken broth instead of water, and really punch up the seasonings (white pepper, thyme). But, there are so many great carrot soup recipes, this one just isn't worth the attempts.

Enjoyed by all. Easy to prepare and elegant. I added fresh ground pepper and ginger root grated at the end. This added to the flavour.

Subtle, light flavor. A perfect first course in any season (though not really rich enough to match up to a red meat course).

Delicate and delicious flavor, beautiful color.

simple and quick but the balance of orange juice and sour cream to carrot and fennel must be just right - so be careful when making in large batches

I like heavy spices and when I make this again I'll increase them This soup has the feeling of a fine rich cream of tomato soup yum

Beautiful color, unique and delicious, healthy, and easy as pie (whatever that means)! Using a hand-held submersion blender makes it extra easy.
