I liked this with some adjustments, I used sun dried tomatoes, added cayenne to the corn coulis, extra garlic and shallots, and a little white wine. I also added whipping cream instead of milk for a little more richness to the coulis.

Giving this recipe 4 stars even though I would probably never make it without the addition of some spice to the corn coulis. I used A Cook from Philadelphia's suggestion and added curry. Fabulous! Have made it with scallops and with shrimp - (prefer the scallops). I don't strain the corn mixture -and I make twice as much because it is tasty! It's so easy to make and presents nicely - great for entertaining.

In addition to my previous review, I'd like to recommend adding scallops to the Pasta with Lemon Cream and Prosciutto from this site - delicious!

I wanted to love this, but it didn't work. I didn't believe other reviewers when they said the coulis was too sweet, but it did indeed overpower the flavor of the scallops. At $15 a pound, I want to taste the scallops! I will be deleting this from my saved recipes.

Loved it - with some big changes. I had extra corn but no basil. Served with sauteed baby spinach and that added more than the tomatoes, so next time I'd skip the tomatoes. I added about 1 tsp curry powder to the corn mixture (push corn aside and let the powder cook a min before mixing in). Then I simply used an emulsion blender on the corn to get a thick mash, not a coulis at all, but it was hearty and delish. I really think the curry elevated the flavor - try it!! :)

Made this for our date night and thought it was great. I had to cut the recipe to serve two. I used frozen corn for the coulis. I did not force the puree through a fine sieve because I liked the texture the way it was. I have added this recipe to my favorites.

Rating: 4
I agree with some other reviewers - the coulis needs to be spiked with some kind of pepper to offset the sweetness. I used red pepper flakes, but a dash of cayenne would have been better. I also subbed cream for the 1% milk. Almost added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the tomatoes as suggested, but the coulis was so flavorful I didn't think another strong element was called for. Four forks with a little tweaking - and we always tweak, no?

Rating: 3
I very rarely give anything 4 forks, but I wish that I could give this 3 1/2 forks. I made this as an entree with pecan rice pilaf and roasted green beans on the side, and it was wonderful. It was satisfying, but still light and summery. If I was to make this again, I would probably serve it as an appetizer like a lot of other people did. The coulis was probably enough for 3 people as entree portions, but it might not be a bad idea to increase the amount if you have more people. Our coulis was delicious, but it's probably because we had nice corn and added a good bit of sauce. I agree that it's probably not necessary to strain the coulis. I also thought that the tomatoes were a little bit superfluous, but if I made this again, I might try cutting the tomatoes into a teeny tiny little dice and seeing if that helps.

I tripled the recipe and while the taste was good, the presentation was not due to the murky color from carmelizing the corn.

Tasty, but sauce is awefully sweet for me. Great presentation and would be a safe bet for company. I also skipped the straining, it's still a very smooth sauce. I prefer scallops with a little bite, may try some crushed red pepper next time to balance out the sweet.

Rating: 4
This is terrific, and the tips in the previous reviews are helpful, especially (1) the corn can be so sweet as to be cloying so find an older variety if possible (I personally wouldn't know where to begin); (2) make more of the coulis; (3) don't bother straining if your blender purees finely and you don't have company; (4) a tiny bit of cumin is nice but be careful because it can overwhelm the other flavors.

Very tasty scallops with beautiful presentation. After reading the reviews, I added balsamic vinegar and basil to the tomatoes. I also garnished with chopped basil. I used three scallops for a first course. I also skipped the straining process to save time.

Excellent dish. The sweetness of the scallops paired perfectly with that of the basil and corn. For next time, I will skip the parsley and toss the tomatoes with basil instead.

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe because it was so simple and the presentation was elegant. The light yellow corn coulis is beautiful and flavorful. The scallops are lightly seasoned and sauteed, then mounded in the middle. I garnished with a sprig of baby basil, and served it with new potatoes with basil (I had a lot of basil from the farmer's market).

Good and a dressed-up way to serve scallops. However the sauce was not "out of this world"

This dish was excelent. Only missing one thing: bacon. Wrapped the scallops in bacon, the grilled outdoors. Also used fresh thyme instead of parsley.

This dish was excellent. Like others, I did not strain the sauce -- really there is no need. Added a bit of Turkish pepper to give it a bit of a kick. I made the full sauce for just ten scallops. It would probably be enough for 20, but if you were doing 30, I might do a little bit more.

I used this as a first course to a multiple course dinner. It was fresh and light and enjoyed by all. I think I will be trying the addition of basalmic vinegar & garlic to the tomatoes as recommended by others. Still, the recipe is wonderful as written.

Served this for a birthday dinner, downsized, as an appetizer course, with rave reviews. It can be a really impressive presentation. I followed other reviewers in adding some balsamic to the tomato part, and some chile to the coulis. I'm still not perfectly satisfied though, finding it just a little bland even with farm-fresh goods. I'll look for some more tweaking possibilities the next time, and there will be a next time.

Easy and delicious. We loved it just the way the recipe reads.

With fresh, ripe corn, the coulis has a natural sweetness to it that is just fantastic with the scallops and the tomatoes. I got all the produce at a local farmers market, and the whole dish sang of summer. To save time, I didn't strain the coulis - just blended it a little longer. And I served the dish in bowls with 3/4 cup of coulis so it could serve as a more substantial starch for the meal.

Rating: 2
I followed the advice of other cooks in order to spice it up a little (balsamic vinegar, extra garlic). Despite these additions, I still feel as though this dish leaves something to be desired. The coulis was good, but overall, it's combition with the tomatoes and the scallops just left me cold. And after a spectacular soup course, I noted a considerable drop in enthusiasm on the part of my guests, I doubt I'll revisit this one.

Made this as a starter for my Mom's birthday party. It was delicious and looked beautiful. Doubled the coulis and did not strain as mentioned. Also made the night before. Used tomatoes and corn from the farmers' market and put the scallops on the grill. will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
This dish is exceptional! I have made many recipes from epicurious and this one stands out as one of, if not, the best I have made. It is very important to use fresh ingredients. I used Diver scallops from the local fish monger, garden fresh herbs, tomatoes and corn. Outstanding blend of flavors. The presentation was also outstanding. Served with a Russian River Chardonney. I plan on making this as a main course for our next dinner party.

I doubled the recipe and served as the main course for my brother's birthday dinner and everyone loved it. Followed other's advice to add wine before the milk and also didn't strain, turned out great. Used extra basil instead of parsley. Will be making again!

Rating: 4
This is fantastic - looks beautiful and most would think you worked much harder than you did. I tried straining the coulis as in the recipe but it turned out way too soupy. Leaving the solids in is much better - it's been blended so it's not like big chunks of corn. I plan to do this with medallions of monkfish next time.

I did this with grilled shrimp, which I fully cleaned and skewered and bbq'd. The proportions are right on the coulis, but you need more. Make a bunch. Changes-- I used a splash of white wine to get the brown bits, then added the milk and let it reduce a little. Three drops Tabasco. Just blended the heck out of it, straining not required. I seeded and skinned the Romas and thought, how can you not add freshly chopped basil to this part of the dish? Especially when basil is a part of the sauce flavor. So a bunch of that went in the tomatoes, along with some freshly chopped chives from my garden. Resisted the temptation to hit it with Balsamic--there were enough flavors going on and that's what I used for the salad dressing. Used a bit of red onion as I was out of shallots. A nice baguette and a buttery Chardonnay. Yum. It's mine now.

Rating: 3
I like the flavor combo of this dish and the presentation is impressive, however, in my opinion, the corn sauce need a little 'jazzing' up. I use a bit of sherry and a tad of hot pepper flakes. Also, since flavorful tomatoes are very seasonal in CA, I prefer a sundried tomato/basil/basalmic concoction for the center. Minor tweeks - this is definately an impressive starter for serious dinner parties.

I adore this recipe. I substituted 1/2 of the milk for heavy cream and it really made the difference. We served it with fresh greens and a crispy loaf of french bread. Perfection.

This recipe is a keeper. So easy to make and very refreshing. I agree, careful to not add too much herbs, and I used heavy cream instead of the 1% milk. I never have that on hand. Fresh veggies are a must. I would love to try this out on company. I grilled my scallops on the BBQ, very tasty.

Well, I'm not sure there was anything really wrong with this recipe, it was pretty on the plate and tasted fine. I just think there are much better recipes for scallops out there, including on this website. Perhaps the corn taste didn't compliment the delicate scallop flavor like I thought it should. Won't do again.

The coulis needed more, although what I'm not sure. It was a little bland, so maybe a touch of tabasco? Overall, more work than the recipe is worth.

Delicious. Careful with the amount of herbs. I used cilantro and basil, but a bit too much and the color of the coulis was a little putrid. Still, the dish was delicious with the added cumin and red pepper as suggested. Also added a bit of balsamic vinegar to the tomatoes. Yum!

I've already made this twice. It is truly delicious, and economical if you buy only 5 scallops/person. Recipe works great, and not too much work even w/ the sieving of corn. As variation and to accomodate bumper crop of beans in my garden, I served scallops w/Alice Waters' green bean & tomato salad w/ shallot vinagrette. Couscous w/ zucchini & basil also helps diminish garden surplus.

Rating: 0
Fantastic! Quick, easy and healthy too. I made the coulis in a small saucepan and chopped it coarsely with an immersion blender; the coarser, slightly crunchy texture was a nice contrast to the silkiness of the scallops. I was a little short on scallops so I added some shrimp as well and that turned out to be a great combination. For the tomato mixture I halved some super sweet organic cherry tomatoes and drizzled them with a small amount of white balsamic vinegar. Whatever kind you use, really good, ripe tomatoes are key to the success of this dish.

I love scallops and this sauce was a perfect complement to them. Used whole milk cause I had it but still a low-fat winner. Served it with your Ribboned Zucchini Salad and Couscous with Lemon and Herbs. Just the two of us for dinner last night so warmed the leftover sauce tonight and served it with grilled halibut. Delicious!

This was absolutely fantastic -- a real keeper. Fresh ingredients are key -- a little parsley goes a long way. In addition to the tomatoes, I julienned some zucchini and sauteed it with some garlic and olive oil. I made this for 2 and we used all of the sauce, so if you're REALLY planning to serve 6 -- double the sauce recipe.

Rating: 4
This turned out wonderful even with frozen organic corn. I made this is into a pasta dish for two by keeping all other ingredient the same but cutting down the scallops by half. I also used half scallops and half shrimps. The coulis and tomatoes made a nice pasta sauce. Next time, I will use all shrimps since they proved more flavorful than the scallops on top of the pasta. Definitely a keeper.

My two teenage kids and my husband all thought this was just great, like they were eating in a fancy restaurant. And it really only took me 45 minutes. One addition I made was approx. 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar mixed in with the tomatoes which I would do again. Also it was important to use fresh corn from the cob and fresh parsley as you specified in the recipe. Thanks for a great gourmet meal I can make after work!

Rating: 3
Great and easy to prepare. I used a combination of heavy cream (I know, I know) and skim milk and added some red pepper flakes. I did not sieve the sauce. The sauce as such wasn't the prettiest stuff in the world, but it sure tasted great. I prepared with grilled salmon. Would definitely make again.

Maybe I went too heavy-handed on the basil, but my coulis turned a bit green. It tasted very good, but the color didn't exactly shout "corn."

Rating: 3
To echo other reviews, this is easy to prepare. It makes good use of tomatoes, corn, and herbs from the garden. The freshness and ripeness of these ingredients is key. I made the dish for my husband and I and we used about 2/3 of the sauce -- so I would increase the amount accordingly for more people. I used a bit more basil than the recipe calls for. I had a just a few (1 Tbsp or so) black-eyed peas from the garden. So I cooked a little bacon and then sauted the peas in a little of the bacon fat before adding water and cooking them for another 5 minutes or so. After I plated the dish, I sprinkled the peas in the sauce and crumbled the bacon over the scallops and tomatoes. I look forward to making this dish again and experimenting with the herbs.

Gee when I made this recipe there were no reviews yet, WOW! This was an excellent recipe! I didnt know corn paired so well with scallops. I used a fresh heirloom variety of corn from my garden and doubled the sauce. I also used some black krim tomatoes that were seeded and skinned along with some yellow pear and other heirloom roma's. It was beautiful, so tasty, I did use cilantro instead of the parsley and basil, I also added garnishes of thin sliced lime wedges and a dazh of cayenne. Oh My is all I have left to say about this one!

Rating: 3
This is a really good--and good looking--dish, particularly as an appetizer. I use cream instead of the milk, and add a little butter to the oil when searing the scallops. I've noticed the finished product is quite affected by the level of sweetness in the corn used. Much of the corn available in the supermarket these days are "super sweet" varieties (3 to 4 times sweeter than standard sweet corn). Might be best to seek out an older variety at a farmer's market if it seems cloying. Looking forward to tinkering with the basic recipe in the future. Maybe a touch of chipotle and cumin with the corn mixture and cilantro and oregano instead of the basil and parsley.

Rating: 2
This was a very simple recipe. We found the coulis to be too sweet of an accompaniment to scallops. I thought it needed more basil and more shallot. Additionally, the tomatoes were a rather bland addition to the dish, although they did add much needed color to the presentation. I'd recommend adding more parsley and chopped basil to the tomatoes, and perhaps using some brightly colored heirlooms rather than just the red. All in all, an adequate recipe, just far too sweet for our liking.

Fab easy enough Would have been nice to have used a mesh bag, like the kind for mashing fruit to make wine. instead of cheese cloth...but both will work. I used some hot chile oil insted of reg oilve oil. and targon insted of basil. I'm gunna do it again and put it over shrimp and make extra and serve as a soup/ with an spicy oil drizel in the middle with a a few peper bits

I made this dish the other night for my husband and his boss (sounds like a 50s thing but it was fun). I started to sieve the sauce but gave up on account of time. The texture of the corn was wonderful and I wonder if the solids were taken out, whether this sauce would have been such a hit. I also couldn't find scallops so used shrimp and everyone raved about the dish! Definitely part of my repertoire.

The directions for this recipe are incomplete. I have to assume the milk mixture is added to the sieved corn to form the coulis or sauce.
