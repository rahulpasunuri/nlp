I agree with many of you. This is the best pie crust. I used it to make hand-held blueberry-pear pies and they turned out great. The crust was flaky and flavorful. Certainly the best pie crust this novice has ever made!

I've tried *a lot* of different crusts - this one is the best, easy to make and always delicious.

Best pie crust I've made, except when I pre-baked it I didn't follow any of the previous commenters' advice about freezing it first or filling it with beans or pie weights and it shrank a lot. For my purposes this time, that was fine, but I will follow the advice in the future. Since I was making a savory pie I just used a teaspoon of sugar.

I have been using this recipe for pie crust for about two years. It is flawless. The crust is flavourful and very flaky indeed. There is a constant debate among people that prefer an all-butter pie vs people that prefer 50% butter and 50% lard. The brilliance of this recipe is in the fact that it delivers the advantages of both methods. Using exclusively butter, the crust is rich and flavourful. At the same time, thanks to the addition of vinegar, the crust is also flaky. The best of both worlds!

Very flaky and crisp, crunchy. Surprising, unusual, but delicious.

I agree with the majority of the rest of the users on about two things. One: This pie crust is delicious. It is made from all butter and is extremely flaky. Two: This pie crust is easy to make. However, this pie crust is more of a croissant than a pie crust, I believe. I tried to make this pie crust to collaborate with a sweet potato pie, and it did not work out very well. Instead of a crispy and hearty crust, I got flaky and undercooked. This recipe would have been amazing had it included instructions for a Pre-Bake. (Although a previous reviewer posted those) I found that when I did pre bake the crust, the edges burned easily and there were many bubbles at the bottom. Although, beacuse of this, I cannot give this crust 4 stars. ALl in all, good recipe. Here are The Pre-Bake instructions: Though I would suggest brushing the bottom and edges of the crust with butter to reduce the burning, Because THIS CRUST BURNS EASILY. Pre Bake Directions (from friscokitchen/Dallas,TX): Transfer the rolled-out dough to 9- inch-diameter glass pie dish. Fold edges under and crimp decoratively. Freeze crust 20 minutes. Position oven rack in bottom third of oven; preheat to 350°F. Line crust with nonstick foil and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake until crust is set, about 20 minutes. Gently remove foil and beans. Return crust to oven and bake until partially cooked and golden brown around edges, pressing down on crust with back of spoon if bubbles form, about 15 minutes. Cool crust on rack". (Then add the filling and finish baking following the recipe for whatever pie you're making.)

This is a wonderful pie crust! It`s easy, tender and flaky. My search for the perfect crust is over!

Easy to make! Since I don't usually buy shortening and prefer butter, this recipe is great. Also, since i don't have a food processor, I coarsely grate the frozen butter cube (per Cook's Illustrated tip). Some modifications that have worked for me: use all whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose & use just 2 sticks (1 cup) of butter instead of the 2-1/4 sticks.

This pie dough was outstanding! It was flaky, and tasty. I kept the measured apple cider vinegar floating in the ice water. I rubbed the butter in and kept the pieces larger, to ensure it would be flaky. It will be in my recipe box forever.

Surprised at how easy this crust was, considering I'd never made one before. It was a little salty but with the pie I made it worked really well, maybe next time I'll use just a little less salt and a little more sugar (I like my crusts on the sweeter side). Will definitely make it again!

I'm not very experienced with pie crust at all, but I think this one turned out to be PERFECT! It was delicious, and extremely easy to work with. I didn't know whether or not to pre-bake this at first, but I looked for some pre-baking instructions on this site from another recipe, and I just used those directions (shown below) after rolling out this dough. I'm sure that the whole crust pre-baking part is obvious to more experienced bakers, but I definitely needed these additional instructions after rolling out this dough and before pouring in the pumpkin pie filling, so maybe it will be helful to someone else too! :) "Transfer the rolled-out dough to 9- inch-diameter glass pie dish.

Okay. This time I had success! I made an apple pie this time. The dough is very easy to work with. I had a perfect, flaky buttery crust. Rave reviews from my guests followed.

I think my oven was reporting a temperature lower than it said it was. But--had it baked properly, I'm certain this would have been an extremely tasty pie crust. The sides definitely were very flaky and crusty.

I made this pie crust for the Double Apple Pie recipe on this site instead of the one it called for as I really wanted it to be pure french - all butter/ This recipe is easy, as another baker mentioned, a little more water is required, but given that I made it in the winter, not unexpected - with summer's humidity it may not be necessary. Lovely results, nice texture, good flakiness. Will definitely make again.

This crust was amazingly easy to work with and had a great texture and flavor when baked. For my kitchen I ended up adding another tablespoon of water to the dough and it came together beautifully. I highly recommend this crust!

My pumpkin pie is in oven right now. This crust was very easy to work with. I made it 2 days ahead. But, so far the crust has shrunk considerably on the one side. Maybe I should've pre baked it but I have never done that before so didn't think it was necessary. Although, I also have never made an all butter crust. If anyone has any tips for next time that would be great! I will find out in a few hours how it tastes ;)

This seems to be a great recipe from the reviews! However, I do not think that this recipe works in more humid regions. I tried the recipe and it became to moiste. I added more flour and it only became grainy and wet. I recomend if that you live in an area with a more moist atmosphere, to go with an alternative recipe.

For a while I was making the Cook's Illustrated crust that included crisco. Since trying this one I haven't gone back, I really prefer the buttery flavor. For the top crust, instead of a lattice as many recipes call for, I just roll it out thin and then lay it over, cutting a few round holes. Coat with egg yolk & water and then sprinkle sugar over it.

This one is the best! I will never buy store bought crust again. This is so much better than ready made crusts. Delicious! Flaky, buttery, wonderful. I made this crust for a chicken pot pie -recipe on this site- and was a delicious combo. I was always terrible at pie crusts but i have learned a few things - always use cold, UNSALTED butter and ice water. Chill the dough and always roll out on parchment with a floured pin. enjoy.

Great pie crust...I am the worst baker ever, and pie crust terrifies me, but this is so simple and it always turns out great both in looks and taste!

Wow! Great pie crust! I have been trying to find a good butter-only pie crust recipe for some time now, and this is the best so far. I made it in a food processor, it was super easy. The trick, I discovered, is to freeze the butter cubes for 45+ minutes and then pulse them into the flour mixture until the dough starts forming small clumps, then pulse the vinegar and water into the dough until some of the clumps start forming larger clumps and the dough starts mounding along the inside of the processor wall. Even though a lot of the dough pieces will still be tiny at this point, just dump the mixture out into a plastic bag or a large piece of plastic wrap and form it into a ball. The whole process should only take about than 5 minutes. And the resulting crust is super flaky and tender!

I made this for the Peach Lattice Pie and loved it. I have been using the CI crisco & butter recipe for a while and love that for pumpkin and pecan, but this - somewhat sweet and ever so slightly salty - is perfect for sweet fruit pies. I wouldn't cut back on the salt, that was part of the goodness. Maybe if you're the kind of person who likes salt on watermelon and cheese with apples you'll like the salt in this. Everyone I served it to loved it.

Best pie crust ever! Great for pies and great for quiche as well! Highly recommend! Be sure to chill crust after each step as it will ensure a nice flaky crust!

I agree with the Sherborn cook on reducing the salt for a sweet recipe. Otherwise it worked very well with the Peach Lattice pie recipe. [ First pie I've ever made ]

This was really excellent. If you have an older food processor as I do, I would recommend buying a new one first as the ingredients barely fit in my circa 1992 Cuisinart! I'd also cut back a little on the salt, perhaps by a quarter teaspoon, but that's the only change I'd make. This will be my standard sweet pie crust from now on!

This is my new pie crust of choice. I froze the butter and ended up using 9 tablespoons of ice water. The dough was very easy to work with and it baked up very light and flaky. I like the all-butter (no trans-fat) feature.
