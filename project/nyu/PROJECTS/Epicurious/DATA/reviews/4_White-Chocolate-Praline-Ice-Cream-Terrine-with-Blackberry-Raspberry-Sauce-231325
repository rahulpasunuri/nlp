My MIL made this; she doesn't review so I will. My SIL & I thought this was the BEST DESSERT WE'VE EVER HAD. She subbed pecans for walnuts and used more jam, to taste, in the sauce. I will definitely be making it (for a special occasion).

This is really very good and looks a great deal more difficult than it is. I love the tartness of the blackberry sauce compared with the sweetness of the ice cream and praline. Things I would do next time; use pecans instead of walnuts and skip the 6 hour freeze. The ice cream needs to be pliable to mold into the loaf pan, so I think it would be hard enough coming out of the ice cream freezer to do that.

This recipe is incredible. I am planning to use it for a formal dinner party this weekend, so I tested it ahead of time. I am going to try heating the sauce to remove some rather unattractive but small dark lumps of the preserves. I am sure it will be a success.

I would add some sugar to the sauce. Wonderful recipe. My only complaint was that it was melting as I was cutting it. Had to move quickly. Havent made homemade icecream enough to know how to keep it firm. I did let it sit overnight. Would make again.

I made this for Christmas and it was so delicious! I used pecans instead of walnuts (in TX we use pecans) and it was great. The ice cream would be wonderful by itself too!

This is a wonderful recipe, and got rave reviews at a recent dinner party. I did make a change with the blackberry sauce. I sprinkled the mashed blackberries with 1 tsp. of sugar. When adding the raspberry preserves, I put the mixture on a low burner, stirring until disolved, and also added 2 tbs. super fine sugar.

I was amazed at the simplicity in the preperation to wow-factor ratio. It was a huge hit at our Christmas party. Elegant and unexpected.

Delicious recipe. To the cook in Colorado, "pour the custard into the ice cream maker" refers to the egg, cream, sugar, white chocolate mixture which is a custard. The richest ice creams are custard based (egg, cream, sugar).

I haven't actually made this recipe, but in answer to how to make this without an ice cream maker, I have made a very similar dish and not used any form of specialized equipment, but the recipe called instead of sugar and whole milk for condensed milk (which is sweet on its own) and all you need do is fold in the beaten egg yolk, the whipped cream and pour into a pan to freeze. It was simple, easy, and you could make it any flavour you wanted (oreo cookie, candy cane for the holidays, white chocolate as above...)

I made this for a fund-raiser at my church. The only thing I did differently was to double the berry sauce and put some on the BOTTOM as well as the top. If anyone is interested, find a shop that sells fruit/chocolate powders - I combined cocoa and raspberry powders and did a fine dusting all over the plate as a garnish, and the 40+ crowd's reaction gave me goose-bumps!

I made it for Christmas. I choped the praline fine. My family requested I keep this recipe. I had some left over which I melted and used as a sauce on desert crepes on New Years.

Made this dish for the holidays and everyone raved about it!! To answer the previous person's question...I donot own an ice cream maker so I purchased some vanilla gelato, softened it slightly, and added melted white chocolate to it. It worked perfectly! I will definitely be making this again.

Does anyone have an idea regarding a way to make this without an ice cream maker?

Haven't made this, but I have a question-I don't have an ice cream maker so is there anyway to adapt it for someone who doesn't have one? And second was would "process custard in ice cream maker" mean? Thanks!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was really wonderful. It takes quite a bit of time, but it can be done in stages and is well worth the effort. It is delicious and beautiful -especially with the blackberry- raspberry sauce. I agree with the previous cook that I'd chop the praline a little smaller next time. I didn't have a very straight or elegant-looking line of praline across the terrine (no one seemd to mind though)! This recipe is a definite 'keeper' for special occasions.

I made this over the course of a week's time, so the do-ahead factor was nice. My only glitch was that maybe next time I will chop the praline a little finer so the chunks will not be so hard to chew in the dessert. I served it for a ladies luncheon, and could hear loud crunching sounds all around.
