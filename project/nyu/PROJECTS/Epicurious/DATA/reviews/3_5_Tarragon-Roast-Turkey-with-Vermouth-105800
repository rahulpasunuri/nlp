This was easy and a hit with our Thanksgiving guests. We'd definitely make it again.

This will be my third year making this fabulous turkey. It's so easy and so delicious, and gets rave reviews. The flavors combine beautifully with the side dishes, as well.

Oh my goodness! I wouldn't give this to my dog!

Easy to make and a good recipe to satisfy most tastes. A safe recipe for groups with varied palates.

It seemed like a lot of work for not much added taste. (as in it tasted like a normal turkey). We didn't like this recipe, and won't make it again.

This is a great recipe. My husband and I just cooked our first turkey this year and followed this recipe. It was easy and our turkey came out perfectly. The spices were just right - not too much or too little.

There's a typo in this recipe title (turket --> turkey) that will prevent it from coming up recipe searches and stuff like that -- does anyone from the epicurious staff read these comments? for the sake of the recipe this should be fixed. :-)
