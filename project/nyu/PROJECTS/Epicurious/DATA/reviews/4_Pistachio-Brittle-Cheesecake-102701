I've made this maybe four times. It's ridicuously complicated by the time you make the brittle and the white choc topping. It takes an entire day. But, I will say guests absolutely love it. A cook in Cleveland.

Caveat: I made this cheesecake without the brittle. The crust and filling sounded nice enough. However, after making it and sharing it, the consensus was that this is a pleasant, but not memorable cheesecake. The cardamom flavor comes through nicely; however, the pear flavor ought to be more pronounced. Perhaps using a pear puree rather than nectar would help. The crust was nice, but not extraordinary. Toasting the pistachios might have enhanced the nut flavor. Overall, a perfectly fine but not outstanding cheesecake (without the brittle!)

I'm not a fan of cheesecake, but this was really creamy and the cardamom is just delicious. Everyone loved it.

My grocery store was out of ground cardamom and I slightly burnt the pistacio brittle, so the end result of this recipe for me was a very creamy, but not that exciting, cake, with a really yummy crust. I would make this again with the cardamom and another attempt at the brittle. As I made it, it was pleasantly tasty but uninspiring.

I was very pleased with the results of this recipe. It not only tasted great but was really pretty. I did have some trouble with the brittle and found the microwave method worked best. I will make this again. It had a great flavor and texture.

This was ok, not great. The flavors were interesting but odd. The cardamom and pear nectar really came through. So did the sour cream, which I didn't think did much for the cake. I have made better cheesecakes from recipes on this site. Try the Vermont Maple Syrup Cheesecake or the Mascarpone Cheesecake with Balsamic Strawberries.

This is a stunning piece of work. I followed the advice of a guy who reviewed the pistachio brittle and mixed up the sugar and water in a microwave safe bowl and then microwaved on high for around 7 minutes. I could see the sugar turn amber and also could smell the caramel. It was easy and beautiful on the first try... the only problem has been that it is very sticky and melty but it hasn't affected the look of it which is spectacular. As for the cheesecake, I did the whole thing in the food processor before realising that it was meant to be 'beaten.' My only complaint is that it was rather brown on top and when I removed it from the pan it had a brown layer around the edge instead of being white like the picture... Solved that by cutting/scraping away the outside brown and studding the cheese with whole pistachios in a row around the edge... very nice effect. Anyone who looks at this cake will believe you are a genius... and you are because you know that fabulous desserts don't have to take days. Fantastic! Fantastic! Fantastic!

Awesome! Gorgeous presentation and not difficult to prepare in the least. I took it to a Belgian Independence Day barbecue yesterday (made it the night before) and the ooohs and ahhhs never stopped. The hosts called it the showpiece of the barbecue. I had no cardamom so put in few dashes of nutmeg and cloves but otherwise followed the recipe precisely. A definite keeper.

This was delicious! I made it for the first time and it turned out great. No trouble at all with the brittle and everyone loved it. Someone even said this is the only way they would eat pistachios. I'm definitely baking these one again.

I've made this cheesecake at least a dozen times. Using the ingredients called for in the recipe, you'll create the creamiest, freshest tasting cheesecake you've ever tried. It isn't difficult and people always gasp when they see it!

This was a beautiful and delicious cheesecake. I made two for a friends birthday, this one and a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. I cooked both in water baths and substituted mascarpone cheese for part of the cream cheese. Although this one was a real show-stopper, everyone preferred the other. I think it was because the flavor of the filling was not particularly extraordinary (I loved the crust, however). One person kept saying it tasted like pumpkin pie, because of the cardamom. Making the brittle is also tricky and kind of a pain. All in all, although spectacular looking, I won't make it again.

This is the best! I love the salted pistachios in the brittle for that sweet/salt flavor. I also use a water bath which produces extra creaminess. Nice visual with the brittle.

This was a show-stopper. I made it for a Christmas gathering and everyone was highly impressed. We had to insert the brittle into the top of the cake after we got to the party, which made it all the more impressive. Wonderful!

Really delicious!. The flavor of the cheesecake really improves after a few days in the fridge. I recommend that you make it two days ahead of the day you plan to serve it. I found the brittle was more of a fancy garnish than a flavor enhancer (although, it I think it would be good crumbled on top). The cheesecake is great on it's own.

I won first prize out of several deserts at a private dinner party using this recipe. Everyone was raving. Some suggestions, separate the eggs and beat egg whites separately and fold into the mixture - makes a lighter creamer cake. Also the directions for the brittle do not say anything about not stirring. My first try I stirred and then found another brittle recipe which gave better directions. I stretched the brittle very thin in spots which made it very pretty. I made a tower with the brittle. Very beautiful!

Great recipe, although really of course you can take *any* cheesecake and add brittle to the top. 1) The brittle may take a few tries, fortunately sugar is cheap. You really shouldn't even need the water. Do NOT stir while the sugar is cooking, that is a common error. 2) Arrange the pistachios on the baking sheet first to distribute them evenly, pour the caramel over. If you don't have unsalted pistachios, soak them in water and then dry completely. 3) This is the first recipe that called for wrapping the cake in foil while baking. I've seen others where you wrap it but cook it in a water bath (water bath cooking is the secret to creamy cheesecakes). Not sure whether I like the foil method; the cheesecake came out a bit soft but perhaps I should have cooked it longer.

Fabulous!! For the Cook below re: shelled pistachios. You can get them at Trader Joe's, if there is one in your area. Also, many natural food stores will carry them, such as Wild Oats, Boney's, etc. You don't say where you live, so hard to give advice about purchases.

Sumptuously rich and easy to make. The brittle is delicious- but next time around (and there will be a next time, soon!) I'll use more pistachio nuts for a greater ratio of nuts to connective tissue. Pistachios are just too good to have in moderation-pile them on!

This was absolutely delicious. The presentation was so beautiful. I will be making this one again very soon.

Wow-this cheesecake is absolutely fantabulous. I have to say, I didn't find it as easy to make as other reviewers did, but I attribute that to myself and my predilection for kitchen mishaps, not the recipe. If I could have found pre-shelled pistachios, the whole endeavor would have been much simpler. Any ideas about where to buy those?

Great recipe... of course I would do it again. It´s really easy to make, very easy to slice, no crumbles, and very delicious. I truly recommended it.

Made the cheesecake for 4th of July birthday celebration. Presented it on a mirror, studded with tapers of various lengths that had been set into spun sugar "candle holders" made from second batch of brittle (without pistachios). When all the tapers were lit, the light reflected beautifully off the mirror, spun sugar and brittle on top of the cake. It was a show stopper and the cake tasted scrumptious! Thank you for a great recipe.

Since the recipe came out we have made this cheesecake 5 times and are still being asked to make it whenever we go somewhere. It has never failed us once!

I made this cheescake and it was a hit but the first time my brittle was a failure. Then I read more about making candy and just made the most beautiful amber brittle for another cheesecake. The secret to the brittle is to get a candy thermometer and make sure the sugar is totally melted before turning the heat up to boil it. Also having the pastry brush to wash down the sides of the pan is key. Don't swirl the pan or stir it once it starts boiling and keep an eye on the candy thermometer for the right temp to make a "hard rock" candy. It turned out so beautiful. It took more than 1/2 hour but it will start to change into a golden amber color. Good luck and have patience.

A very good (and easy to make) cheesecake recipe. My only caveat is the quantity of cardamom called for in the recipe. I reduced the amount by half, and several of my guests (not an adventurous bunch, gastronomically speaking) commented on the "unusual" flavor.

This was one of several cakes that I made for a bridal shower. It looked beautiful with the brittle on top. It is not difficult to make. I did have to make two batches of brittle. I took the advice of a cook(see under "Pistachio Brittle") that suggested that once the sugar melts stop stirring the mixture and gently swirl it over the cooktop. It was a big hit! I'll make this again.

With brittle that presents an artistic, stained-glass effect, this cheesecake is a showpiece. If you want to impress, this is the cheesecake recipe for you. It's delicious, eye-catching, and really not that difficult to make.

I think the cheesecake recipe was delicious but I couldnt get the brittle to work, I tried twice. I ended up with a big clump of what looked like rock candy, very far from the transparent, caramel beauty of the pistachio brittle of the photo. Any suggestions on the brittle making would be very helpful, thanks.

I made three of these cheesecakes last New Year's as gifts and am making more this year. It is literally the best cheesecake recipe I have ever found, the most moist and perfectly baked. The brittle is a beautiful touch, though it can be sharp as a knife, and "melts" onto the surface of the cake after a couple of hours. The melted "syrup" from the brittle tastes wonderful.

One of several desserts concluding a formal dinner. It was beautiful. My assistant for this dinner was my best friend's son, who is a budding chef studying culinary arts. He was impressed with the brittle and the presentation. I loved the taste, as I really enjoy cheesecakes and liked the subtle flavors in this one. Really good!

I agree with the rest of the cooks on this one. Great presentation and was delicious. It also took me two tries for the brittle. I had never used cardamom before and was reluctant to use the whole teaspoon, so I chickened out and used only 1/2 t. My sister has left it out entirely. I could not find pear nectar so I pureed a small can of pears with their own juice and it worked fine.

This cheesecake was a hit at a neighborhood party. The cardamom gives it a unique taste. I don't normally like cheesecake, but this was the outstanding! You won't be sorry if you make this dessert.

This is by far the best tasting cheesecake I've made. The ground cardamon gives it a very unique flavor. It took two tries to get the brittle right but it turned out fabulous in the end. I had trouble finding unsalted pistachios so I used salted and soaked them for a few minutes in water.

I made this recipe for last New Years. I loved the look of the brittle, similar to champagne bubbles, for that special evening. It took two tries to get the brittle right. When it turns color, it does so very quickly. Everyone loved the dessert! It looks great and tastes even better.
