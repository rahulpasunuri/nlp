This is an easy and delicious appetizer at any time!

Very good but the two layers to make the Napoleon was too much for a mouthful. My guests agreed that just one layer of cheese and quince topped with almonds was sufficient (and those were the ones they ate first).

I got the quince paste and manchego cheese from tienda.com. My guests loved this.
