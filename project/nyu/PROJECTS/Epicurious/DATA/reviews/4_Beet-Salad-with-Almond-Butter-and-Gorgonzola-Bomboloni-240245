I made this without the Bomboloni and just added Gorgonzola on top. I also added a very small bunch of mixed greens. It was delicious!

I made this recipe as is, and it was wonderful, although the almond butter was too thick to incorporate easily into each delicious bite - next time I would add a touch of oil. The bomboloni took a bit of time (mostly resting), but were very easy - and they were fabulous. I would absolutely not leave them out.

Do not...I say DO NOT make the bomboloni...it's terrible. But...do the rest of the recipe...it's fabulous. Perhaps a crostini would have been better?

Although I couldn't get the yeast to foam in the milk, I made the bombolonis anyway, and without stopping to let them rise. I also used a deep fryer to cook them, and had to add almost a cup more flour to get the dough to the right consistancy. However, they were delicious anyway, and a huge hit. I don't even like beets! I also added more vinegar to the beet sauce, and some garlic. But all in all, absolutely delicious!

I couldn't get my yeast to foam despite trying two different kinds of yeast so unfortunately I had to skip the Bomboloni part. I ended up cubing the gorgonzola and topped the beets with it. Even with the omission, it was incredible so I would consider this if you are under time constraints or looking for a more simple weekday option.

Wow - this was good! My almond butter was much thicker than the picture, but delicious. Didn't make the bombolone yet. Simple to make, unique dish to serve. Will make this again.

I've made this twice for two separate dinner parties to rave reviews...even from those who don't care for beets. I love, love, love it all. You won't be disappointed.

I didn't have Marcona almonds, so I blanched regular almonds and dry-toasted them in a saucepan. Since I served this at a bbq, I skipped the bomboloni and just added crumbled gorgonzola to the salad. Even people who don't like beets (like myself) like this salad.

Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful. Amazing flavour and taste.

This is absolutely so good. It is impressive, but only the bombolini require any effort. And boy, are they worth it. The flavors are a perfect fit for each other. Don't worry if the dough is super super sticky and flattens out... it happened to me, but the bombolini were perfect. Also, I used regular almonds and they made a fine, if not as pretty, butter.

I did have to add a lot more oil to get a liquid consistency in the almond butter. Other that that I made it just as specified, including the bomboloni. The gorgonzola complimented the sweet beets and the almond butter gave it a richness. I served it as a first course.

My husband makes this recipe without the bombolone and it is divine. He has served it for a multi-course New Year's dinner,and a casual dinner at home. Both were fantastic and appropriate, and the leftovers were delicious!

This recipe celebrates everything I love about beets...color, texture and flavor. It's so easy to whip up and pairs beautifully with so many dishes. I've served it as a salad course and as a side. As a shortcut, I've used store bought organic almond butter. Served with or without the Bomboloni, it's fantastic!

The almond butter was exceptional, an exquisite pairing with the beet salad. I had to add more oil than the recipe called for in order to get the silky consistency. I did not bother with the Bomboloni.

The almond butter is exceptional and pairs exquisitely with the beet salad. I had to add quite a bit more oil in order to get to the silky consitency, but it was delicious. I did not bother with the Bomboloni.

We really love beets, so during the fall and winter, we eat beets about once a week. This is one of the most creative and unique recipes we've tried, and while it seemed sort of dubious at first, it came out SO good, especially considering how simple and easy the recipe was.
