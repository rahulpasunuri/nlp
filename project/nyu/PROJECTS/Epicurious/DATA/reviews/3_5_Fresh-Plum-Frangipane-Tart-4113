I can only give this three forks. Even though I halved the amount of almond extract in the crust and filling because it invariably dominates, it was still practically all I could taste. Otherwise the tart was very good and very pretty. It took longer to cook than 30 minutes and the middle parts of the frangipane never browned, but I got nervous leaving it in so much longer than the directions (10- 15 mins longer).

I made this in 1997 when it came out in the magazine and a few times since then- always amazing!! Travels well too.

I made this with pluots (a cross between a plum and an apricot) instead of plums and it was incredible.

Very european in flavor and texture. Perfect with coffee in the afternoon. Crust is more like a cookie than a traditional pie crust.

Excellent dessert - travels well, does not have to be refrigerated right away. I made it with pears since plums were not available. Was very popular!
