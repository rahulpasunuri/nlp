Don't even bother making a single batch of this. You'll kick yourself for not doubling it! This is just fabulous. The large amount of fresh ginger gives it a good spicy nip, but not as sharp as cayenne or fresh peppers would, so people who don't like "hot" foods can still enjoy it. It was also quick and easy-- I'm a pretty slow cook and it took me under 2 hours start to finish, including the canning. I made the recipe as written, and it yielded 5 half-pint jars plus a dab for the cook to sample. I planned to give some as gifts, but I might just keep it all to myself!

An excellent chutney recipe. I had about 4 cups of young, green apricots that had to be thinned from our tree that I did not want to go to waste. The green apricots substituted wonderfully for the mango.

Made a holiday lunch for my quilting buddies consisting of indian curry and this recipe for mango chutney. They loved it! My husband and I lived in the middle east and love curries. This recipe is beyond fabulous. You cannot purchase a better chutney.

PS, the mango I used was very ripe, and I forgot that I added a pinch of cayenne.

Fabulous, even if I didn't stick to the recipe. I only had one mango, so used 2 medium apples, left out the red pepper, and used considerably less than half the sugar and raisins. I added Nigella seeds, as they're an integral part of a mango chutney for me, and I added more lemon juice, and even water as the mix got too dry before it had softened. My eyeball-measure says this yielded about 2 cups of what my tongue says is pretty spot on; tangy and sweet, sticky and smooth.

This was very good, but I may not add the curry powder again, or perhaps cut it by half. If you are serving chutney with curry, why would you add curry powder to the chutney? It just seemed a bit strong.

Fantastic chutney! I added 1/4 t Cayenne pepper and 1/4 crushed red pepper. Friends loved it and have asked for more! thank you.

Excellent chutney. I did not read the reviews before I made it. Next, time I will add some cayenne for a little extra kick. Now I am inspired to get the book.

Really perfect traditional mango chutney. I doubled the recipe (12 8oz jars, enough for gifts), added a tsp of cayenne and a 1/2 tsp cloves to the doubled recipe. I also used 1/2 raw sugar - 1/2 white sugar.

Absolutely fantastic! Best Mango Chutney I have ever tasted! I used agave nectar instead of sugar, and only about 3 tbsp.

Amazingly good recipe. Made up and canned a batch yesterday, and am already planning on making many more batches to share with friends and family.

Delicious chutney. I added a little ground Cayenne pepper for heat (1/2 tsp). I made it the day before, and it tastes just fine. I made other chutneys that had mustard seed and garlic, and these other chutneys did not store well (even for the next day).

Very easy and delicious. I used ripe mangoes and was very happy with the results.

This recipe sure does make a lot of chutney! I used a mixture of brown and white sugar to give it a richer flavor and it turned out wonderful. I also added a quarter tsp of red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit. A neighbor just gave me another 25lbs of mangoes... I see myself making this recipe again very soon...

I made this with a group of high school students who needed a mango recipe to share with a class. Everyone loved it! I will make it again as gifts! It is nice poured over a block of cream cheese and served with crackers.

Excellent! I am going to make a big batch & put up for Christmas gifts.

Terrific!! My husband loved it. I used peaches instead of apples as I had a bunch of them on hand. I also used powdered ginger, as I did not have the fresh kind. The results I think were better because the flavor was distributed better. I doubled the recipe and canned some for Christmas gifts. I will make this again.

Excellent recipe. I made it first with mangos. The last two times I made it with 3 peaches (fresh SC peaches). I also cooked it a bit longer until it looked liked and tasted like chutney. I like it so much I ordered The Complete Book of Year-Round Small- Batch Preserving and have tried a few of their other recipes. It is a keeper! It is now my favorite chutney. It is delicious blended with mayo for sandwiches.

I made this after picking up 6 mangos at the end of the day in the supermarket. It made enough to fill two large pans so I think its going to last me a while. It goes really well with pork but next time I think I'll use a little less curry powder.

We made this, ate way too much, gave some to friends, and ladled the rest into ziploc bags and froze. This is a great recipe that can easily be enhanced with other fruits -- whatever you like, as long as you don't leave out the fresh ginger!

Excellent. I have canned this recipe twice. Everyone loves it and I often have requests for it. I love to serve it over cream cheese for a very simple appetizer - or with poultry. Very easy and very delicious. It is becoming a yearly tradition to make this chutney every summer.

Not having ginger on hand, I did not add it to the recipe. But, i still got great results. I made this and served it over chicken. My father remarked "This is the sort of thing that you try and realize you've found something missing in your life."A good recipe. Easy. Tasty. Very autumnal.

This recipe has a great taste and wonderful texture. People who claimed they didn't care for chutney, became lovers of this recipe. I will definately use this again.

Excellent Recipie. Not sure if I didn't chop up the fruits and veggies fine enough, so I put them in the food processor after the initial 20 minutes, and it came out great. The recipie is large enough so that I can freeze this and have plenty whenever I need it.

Excellent recipie. Not sure if I just didn't chop up the fruits and veggies fine enough, so after the initial 20 minutes, I threw it all in the food processor, then added the seasonings and finished cooking it, and it came out fantastic. The recipie is kind of large, but it is tasty, so Iwon't mid freezing this and using it whenever I need some.
