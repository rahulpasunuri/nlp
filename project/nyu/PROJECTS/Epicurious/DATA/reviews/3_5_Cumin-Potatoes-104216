This is a great, simple, un-intimidating way to prepare indian-style potatoes. Really nice with Tandoori chicken and raita.

I would definitely make this dish again, but with few additions. I would add mustard seeds along with the cumin seeds and just before adding potatoes I would add aestifoda powder and then add chopped onions, garlic, green chille (small), and curry leaves. Saute for a few minutes and then add potatoes, lemon juice, salt, and tumeric powder. Cook for a few minutes and deocrate with lots of chopped cilantro. Now this dish is ready to serve with rice, chapati, naan, or with bread. Enjoy, Tejal

I prefer a spicier dish, but the subtle flavor was nice. Just make sure you have something extra tasty to go with it!

as an indian,i would say this recipe lacks in flavour, i would add finely sliced onions once the cumin begins to change colr and and then add a few chopped green chilles and garlic too.now that would be authentic indian food:-)

The dish is easy to make once one sets the potatoes aside. The odor while cooking is better than the final taste. A nice color and a pleasant "look" to accent one's meal. The cilantro and salt are critical to the total taste of this dish. There is only reason that would compell me to make this dish again. To falsely impress an effete snob that I may be required to invite for dinner.
