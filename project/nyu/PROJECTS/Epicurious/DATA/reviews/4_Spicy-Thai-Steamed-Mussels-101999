Fantastic recipe! Quick and easy too. Turned up the heat a bit with some Thai chilli peppers. This one earnes a permanent place in my recipe box. Will try with shrimp next! A Keeper!

Very good but not very spicy at all. Ended up adding 1 Serrano chili when I boiled all the other ingredients. Also added a little salt. Saved and froze the left over broth, with the idea of using it in another seafood with rice dish.

So easy and delicious. Will definitely make again, now my favourite mussels recipe.

3.5 forks! This is a great recipe, very good for a small amount of effort/time but not the 'best' mussels I have ever had. I got 3 lbs for 2 girls and 1 very hungry guy (a few shells were broken, a couple didn't open). I followed the recipe as written and used Thai Kitchen Red Curry paste found at Whole Foods. The flavor was good, but slightly flat.... I will try again, adding lemongrass, thai basil or maybe sriracha/thai chile. The curry flavor is nice, but could use a tiny tweak. All in all, I will make again for an easy dinner but not yet for a dinner party!

Although not spicy, these were amazing. So quick, so easy, so delicious! I substituted a mix of chopped thai basil, mint and cilantro for the plain cilantro. We will certainly make this again and again.

This has to be the best recipe for mussels I have ever tasted. Sopping up the left over liquid with a crusty bread is sooo good. Use this recipe everytime I cook them now. The best!

Made this for the first time today, and it came out wonderfully. Instead of cilantro I actually used a bunch of basil and considered it a nice addition. Also, I added one Jalepeno pepper (thinly sliced) to add a nice spice to the dish. Penomenal!!

Loved this recipe. Made it for 2 by just using 3 lbs of mussels. Tastes just like a dish I had in a restaurant. The sauce is really great. I actually think it could use MORE curry paste, but I like my food very spicy.

3.5 starts. This has terrific flavor for the short time it takes to make. I too would add more curry paste next time. I used light coconut milk, which I think made the broth a little too thin.

This recipe is fantastic with the following additions: 2 chopped lemon grass stalks, 1 1/2 T chopped ginger, 1 large chopped tomato. I use vermouth or dry sherry for the wine. I add extra Thai red curry paste as other reviewers have suggested. Before serving, toss with 1 c chopped basil and 1/2 to 1 c chopped cilantro. I use the Pencove mussels from Costco.

It was good with the Kitchen Thai red curry but we felt it needed more spice. Next time we will do that. We did buy bread to sop up the liquid, which was a great idea recommended by others.

Rating: 3
It was good but seriously needed more spice as others recommended. Used the Red Thai Kitchen curry paste. Added some sliced jalaeno at the end to kick it up a little. I will make this again but will add a little more spice next time. I did buy bread to mop up the sauce which was a great idea, thanks to the others who recommended it.

This recipe has been a staple at our house for many years. I recently experimented with freezing the extra broth and then using it in an thai inspired seafood risotto dish, which turned out amazing! Make your favourite risotto recipe and sub.this broth for stock (may need a little extra low sod. clam juice) add your choice of fresh seafood and enjoy.

We are big on mussels in MTL and I've been to most restaurants and tried most recipes. I have been making this one for a few years now and it's still the best! The fresh taste of the cilantro combined with the hot red curry paste is just amazing. BRAVO!

The flavor was really nice. I guess I'm just used to thai food that's blazing hot. It was a little more mild that I would have liked. Next time I'll add more curry paste.

Fantastic flavors - - my family of 4 (incl 12 and 9 y.o. girls) ate 6 lbs of mussels w/ this recipe. I added thin sliced red onion, diagonally sliced carrots, basil and extra cilanto sprigs to the broth & used slightly less red curry paste - -maybe 1 Tbsp. Served w/ basmati rice - - The only thing I would do differently next time is to serve it big bowls w/ soup spoons to drink the broth like soup. It's SO good. I'm going to save the leftover broth, and make more basmati rice to serve it with.

I thought this was outstanding. It was a hit with my 16 year old son's friends too who gave it a big thumbs up. Last night I sauteed some sliced purple onions, made the sauce again and then paired it with shrimp and scallops ... served it with rice. Really amazing.

Four forks because I LOVE Thai curry and this was supreme! One and a half tbs. of curry paste was too much for my husband, but really good for me, though I found it only mildly spicey. I used New Zealand green shelled mussels. Awesome. Will be making it again with or without DH.

I just finished eating this an hour ago and it was SO GOOD I had to put my review in. I've been on the search for the ultimate mussel recipe for some time now and this is it. I can't wait to make it again. The broth was so good that I was tempted to drink it like soup. My only regret is that I didn't make any rice for the broth. The combination of flavors is wonderful. These were the best mussels I've ever had.

Rating: 3
Awesome recipe! After reading other people's reviews, I decided to make a side of jasmine rice and a side of rice noodles...Half of the guests liked the noodles, and half liked the rice...It was easy to make both, so I'll do that next time too...Very good, very easy, and great for company!

Made this at the beach with a propane burner and stock pot. Fantastic! Used Maseri brand Red Curry paste. Just the right level of heat. The French Bread idea is now an essential part of this dish for mopping up the addictive sauce. Five Forks!

Absolutely phenomenal Thai curried mussels recipe. I added 2 stalks finely chopped lemon grass, juice of 3 limes and a tablespoon of minced fresh ginger. Sherry can be substituted for the wine. This will bring your guests to their knees and to your door. I agree with the other comment that a good baguette, though hardly an authentic Thai accompaniment, will be appreciated unless you want your guests to dip spoons into the scrumptious sauce that melds beautifully with the juices from the shellfish. Also, if you have timid tongues among your guests, cut the hot curry paste in half and it'll still taste fantastic.

Rating: 4
This was a very nice change from the usual white wine / shallot treatment. The complex combination of flavors were delightful. I suspect this recipe is particularly appropriate for mussels, whose taste varies widely with location and season - and can be strong at times. No mussel will overpower this sauce. I had it with crusty sourdough bread, green salad, and a white Bourdeaux. Some minced shallots and extra red peppper went very well with the basic recipe. And the next day the leftovers had mellowed like a good chowder. This was a spectacular dinner and lunch for 20 minutes of work.

Rating: 4
This has to be one of the top recipes I have EVER made. I served it to a table of 8 and the only one who didn't enjoy it was a friend who avoids shellfish. I really was feeling embarrased because my guests were going on and on about how good it was. I whipped up the curry the day before and that really gave the flavors a chance to intensify. I did add 1/2 cup of chicken broth and increased the coconut milk to one 14 oz can. Then instead of just mussels I used 2 pounds mussels and 2 pounds clams. Warning though this was amazing it was HOT! So if anyone is avoiding spciy food be warned. Served it as starter to a grilled lemongrass marinted chicken and spicy noodle Thai salad and cucumber salad. Unfortuantley this dish far outshone the rest of the dinner. This will be coming to our table again soon!

A little bit too lime-y. I'm on a quest for the perfect red curry, but I don't think this is it, either. I'm finding it difficult to duplicate the wonderful red curry we eat at our favorite Thai restaurant.

I have to agree that the sauce turned out wonderful - coconutty, spicy and sweet! I had a problem with my mussels though. Half of them were wonderful, but the other half had a tough inside, and a strange flavor. I think that the next time I try this, I might use the sauce with shrimp or another type of mild fish. Anyone else ever have this problem?

Absolutely perfect recipe! A little over 2 pounds of mussels for 4 as an appetizer was plenty. I doubled the amount of cooking broth, but didn't need to-We mopped up lots with slices of French baguette, and I still had sauce left over. This would make a great light meal all by itself. I used "Thai Kitchen" red curry paste, and we all thought the heat level was perfect. We made plans that night to make the recipe again very soon. To die for!!!

Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmmmarvelous mussels! Amazing flavours and easy preparation. I rarely rate a recipe with 4 forks, but this one should have at least 5! I think the degree of heat varies with the brand of curry paste - I used Thai Kitchen and found 1 1/2T just a tad too spicy so next time I will reduce it to 1T. Added 2 stalks finely minced lemongrass, 2 Kaffir lime leaves, and increased wine to 1 cup. Had a lovely Chenin Blanc - perfect dry white wine for the sauce and in the glass. If you like mussels and you like Thai food, this is definitely a "must make" dish! Enjoy!

very good. i make lotsa mussel dishes and this is definitely a keeper. i kept the sauce at a nice simmer for ~10 minutes to get good richness/thickness. i also added slightly more curry paste than was asked for to tame the strong and sweet coconut milk flavor. i even got people who are squeamish around mussels to enjoy this dish.

I had mussels in Thai curry at a restaurant last week, and liked them so much I looked for mussel recipes on Epicurious the next day. Tried this recipe this weekend, and WOW!! So easy to make, and tasted just like the restaurant dish. I used only 2 lbs of mussels but made the specified amount of sauce, and I thought the sauce to mussel ratio was just right. Will be making this often.

Really a simple and tasty recipe. I used only 2 pds of mussels, reduced lime to 1 1/2 limes and reduced fish sauce to about 2 tsp. After mussels were cooked, removed from broth and reduced broth until thickened a bit. Also reduced cilantro to about 1 cup and served on jasmine rice!! Yummy!! I am going to try it with steamer clams also!

Four forks for maximum flavour for minimum effort. This dish was absolutely delicious served with steamed rice. I couldn't get over how good it tasted for how much effort I actually put into making it. I made it again the next day and added some chopped fresh tomato and mushrooms to the mix. The tomato definitely added to the flavour of the dish. Yummy! I'll maybe add a little diced red bell pepper to it next time for a little colour.

I've made this twice now and everyone has enjoyed it. both times I used two 2-pound packages of the frozen new zealand greenlipped mussels. I arranged them meat side up in a large skillet and let them defrost a little while I made the sauce separately. Then, 10-15 minutes before I wanted to serve them, I poured the sauce over and heated it up quickly. The scent of the sauce is bewitching. It's spicy, but a jasmine rice on the side helps to tame the heat. Using the green lipped mussels (which come on the half shell) works well because the shells catch some of the sauce and it flavors the meat. Great presentation too with the green coriander sprinkled over, the beautiful shells, and the peach and cream colors of the mussels themselves. Fabulous, really.

The recipe was great. One problem - 5 pounds is a LOT! Oh my goodness, I had 24 people over for a bbq so I tripled the recipe. Only 3 pounds of it got eaten. That's including 3 bowfuls by me and 2 by the hubby. I wouldn't make more than 3 lbs for 6 people. Maybe in other places the mussels are sand-laden so weigh more?

I am not usaully a great fan of mussels, but some of my daughters and their guys are, so I tried this to tickle their palates, not mine. It was astoundingly good. The mussels actually take on the flavors in the sauce (I normally find mussels in ANY sauce to remain somewhat flavorless, regardless). When I made it, there was not a mussel or a drop of sauce left anywhere. Really phenomenal flavors!

I don't know about the recipe, but I lived across the street from this Inn (for years known as the Hollymead Inn) and loved it's historical beauty. It has colonial charm that is completely authentic. The Hessians once used it as a barracks for soldiers during the Revolution. I am so homesick just to see this recipe from the Inn in my old neighborhood.
