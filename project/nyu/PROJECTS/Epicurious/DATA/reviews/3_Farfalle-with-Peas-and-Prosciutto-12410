This recipe is pretty good. It is quick and light for a weeknight meal. I wanted to use a lb of pasta so I doubled the recipe. I also made the following changes: added a little extra cheese/mint (cuz I overprepped), a dash of crushed red chili pepper flakes, and a tablespoon of heavy cream. I think the heavy cream was just enough to thicken the sauce without making it a heavy dish. Next time, I will not add as much mint and will definitely add more prosciutto as the pork flavor was somewhat lost in the dish.

This is a wonderful pasta dish for hot weather - refreshing, light, and delicious. It's become a family favorite.

This is an excellent dish- seems like a Faith Willinger recipe- just as good as the asparagus lemon penne in Red White and Greens.

I *love* to experiment with different pastas, but I found this dish to be extremely boring. Not only did *I* find it boring, but no one else ate any of it either! Maybe I'm just partial to pasta with garlic or tomato or cream sauce, but it really lacked flavor. I mean, I'm all for healthy and all, but even with the mint and lemon zest, which I thought would be exciting and flavorful, it was still quite bland. I even used tri-color farfalle expecting a flavorful dish, but no one seemed to care for this...pass the olive oil and garlic please!

What a refreshing change from all of those creamy pasta dishes. No guilt here. Like all dishes that call for fresh herbs, it's the fresh mint that makes this dish! DO NOT SUBSTITUTE DRIED MINT -blah! To speed up the process without compromising taste, I microwaved the frozen peas while the pasta cooked. They end up a vibrant bright green, which adds a nice color to the dish. I didn't end up needing too much of the cooking water at the end of the recipe to thicken the sauce, but I did add 2T butter. Also, when heating up leftovers, I found the recipe to be a little dry, so I drizzled a tiny bit of olive oil over the top before reheating.

Good and I would make it again. Recipe made a lot! I used turkey bacon for the procuitto because I did not have any at home...my husband, who says he does noy like turkey bacon thought this was good!
