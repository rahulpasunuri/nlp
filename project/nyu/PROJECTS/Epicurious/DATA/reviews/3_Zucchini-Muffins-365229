I would like to modify what I wrote previously. I have been enjoying the muffins for the entire week and they have not lost any flavor or become dry. I think it took me a while to get used to them; however, now, I am in love with them.

I thought the muffins were too dense and lacking a slight sweetness that I look for. I was not looking for overly sweet, but maybe the addition of few more tablespoons of sugar/honey/maple syrup would probably take care of it. I wish I made them lighter. That amount of oil makes me uneasy about eating 2 muffins. However, there is a positive to having such a fat dense muffin: they will probably last a few days on the counter - meaning I do not have to make breakfast for a few days! We will be eating them for a while! About the density, I substituted 1cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the all-purpose flour. I am sure this contributed to the density; however usually 2/3 white flour with 1/3 wheat flour usually has little effect on that level of density. The addition of some baking powder might address the heaviness. I would not know how much to add though.

With the addition of cinnamon and/or chocolate chips, it's a keeper. I like the sugar content just fine for a breakfast muffin, not too sweet, although I'm sure the chips help.

It bothers me when people change the recipe and then give it a poor rating. Just use the recipe as is and base your review on that. How do you know that the addition of yogurt or making it a loaf vice a muffin didnt affect the final outcome? ;) If you make changes then submit it as a new recipe perhaps? This recipe is good texturally and taste-wise. I agree a little more sugar may be required.

I admit I made three changes to this recipe. I added a little less than 1/4c sugar based on previous reviews, I added 1/3c. homemade apple butter in place of 1/3c. of the oil (still added 1/3 c. of the called for oil) and used walnuts instead of pecans. It was absolutely wonderful!!! The texture was great and the taste was perfect. I'm going to make more and freeze them for the winter.

did none of you notice that the recipe specifies 1/3 cup of light BROWN sugar? I haven't tried it yet but it looks like it would be good

I made this recipe as specified except I did not add raisins as I"m not a great fan. This recipe is "okay." I agree with the other reviewers that this recipe needs more sugar. Addition of 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup sugar would probably work. On the positive side this recipe holds up well to travel. I packed several and took them on the plane and they did not crumble.

This recipe is alright. The texture of the muffins is great, but they definitely need more sugar. I will try adding 1/3 cup of white sugar as well to the recipe the next time I make it.

I replaced the oil with yogurt to further lighten it and made it as a loaf, rather than muffins. Overall, I quite liked this - good texture, nice mixture of ingredients - but it needs more sugar. I don't even like things that are really sweet but this needs a bit more sugar to carry it. Otherwise, It's good.
