I just made this tonight and went back for thirds. Followed the recipe as is, except for roasting the zucchini instead of grilling it (20 min. at 425 or so). I marinated the garbanzos for at least two hours, and I'm glad I did, because the flavor was great. The cumin seeds add a nice earthiness to the dish, and the ground-cumin-lemony-garlic zing is delicious. Next time I might use less zucchini or experiment with other vegetables (butternut squash?). I'd also reduce the oil a bit, and add a bit more salt throughout the process. So happy to have a new flavorful veg-friendly quinoa dish to add to my repertoire, and I'm already looking forward to leftovers at lunch tomorrow.

This is such a versatile dish, you can substitute just about any vegetable for the zucchini. If it's winter and you can't grill, you can roast your vegetables in a hot oven . I usually amp up the spices if I'm adding more veges, adding a little of the paprika and turmeric to the garbanzos as they marinate is also tasty and I like to serve with some lemon wedges. My family loves this for meatless Monday.

Sauteed zucchini and green onions, but otherwise mostly followed the recipe. Cooked the quinoa in my rice cooker with some chicken broth. Dish came out really great.

Oh my was this good - even better than I thought! I followed the recipes pretty much to the T. If I changed anything it would be adding a little extra lemon juice. I thought the level of spice was perfect so I'm glad I didn't bump it up. Had to buy another spice specifically for this recipe (I hate spending $$ on new spices when my spice cabinet is already overflowing) but I'm glad I did because I will be making this many more times!

This was so super yummy and so easy to make. I went with other reviewers and I doubled the spices and I roasted the zucchini (and added red pepper) in the oven. I forgot about the parsley and it didn't even need it. Next time, I will marinate the chickpeas with less oil, wasn't necessary. Served with a sweet potato and large salad for a complete vegetarian meal.

I went by other reviewers' advice and added more spices to the quinoa, but by 1.5, not double. I wish I hadn't, because it ended up quite intense! Next time, I'll just do what the recipe says in that regard. One thing I will change, though, is the amount of oil. It was a little much. I did use cilantro as others suggested and I thought it was quite nice.

Made this last night and liked it a lot. Used yellow squash, a red pepper and a piece of onion that was wasting away, and did them in the oven rather than the grill. Used hot smoked paprika and cilantro per other reviewers.

This recipe is sooo good -- the smoked paprika makes the dish. Great with roasted chicken. I don't have a grill -- I just put the zucchini on a rack over a pan in a 400 oven and roast until it's gooey. Good cold the next day -- just spritz with a bit of lemon juice and add a bit of chopped parsley to freshen the flavor.

I just made this yesterday, it was fun to cook and it was delicious. Of course I made some changes. Didn't have cumin, but subbed chili powder and coriander. I added 1lb of organic chicken. Cubed and boiled in chicken stock and then used that stock to cook the quinoa in for extra flavor. Reduced olive oil to 2TB and the total calorie count was 340. Ate it at room temperature. Healthy summer lunch!

I was so pleased with this recipe! I'm currently eating vegan and have been dying for some flavor and this delivered. I did use a little extra spice and will probably try next time with the recommended amounts as it was strong, but delicious. I added grilled red pepper to mine and those were my favorite bites. All around a delicious and satisfying vegan dish!

I just doubled this recipe for a potluck BBQ for 16-20 people, and won't be disappointed if there are leftovers to bring home. As previous reviews suggested, I increased the amount of garlic and spices (but only by 1.5x, not 2x) - I also used hot smoked paprika which gave it a little kick, used half chicken stock for cooking the quinoa, and roasted the zucchini in a 450 degree oven on the top rack for 10 minutes.

Rating: 4
Wow! I've only just finished this and it's wonderful...I can't wait to see how it tastes tomorrow for lunch! I added a little extra lemon juice and lots of extra garlic to the garbanzo beans and gave them five or so hours to marinate. I substituted ground cumin for cumin seeds with the quinoa. For the zucchini part, I quartered six medium zucchinis and added them along with a large sweet onion and two small red bell peppers cut into strips into a roasting pan with olive oil, coarse salt, pepper, and the spices. I also replaced the parsley with cilantro as per another reviewer's suggestion. Delicious!

Next time I will put more garlic, and omit the second cumin part.

for this recipe I substituted asparagus for the grilled zucchini (I cut them up horizontally into inch long pieces and roasted them for 7-10 minutes. Probably could roast for 5). I used red quinoa and cooked it in plain water instead of cooking it in water infused with the cumin and turmeric. I separately heated a Tbsp oil, with a 1/-1/2 tsp cumin and tumeric each. then I poured the spice-oil minuture into the cooked and fluffed quinoa and mixed. For the Garbanzo beans I used 3 reg cloves garlic, and let it sit for 30min-hr. Then I added the quinoa, roasted and cut asparagus, green onions and mixed gingerly with a fork. This dish sat overnight and was eaten cold for dinner the next day. I paired it with the radicchio, fennel salad (see below) for a vegetarian meal. This dish got rave reviews. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Radicchio-Pear-and-Fennel-Salad-with-Anise-Orange-Dressing-106146

i followed some of the suggestions here: doubled the spices, added red bell pepper to the zucchini, subbed curry powder for tumeric, and added cayenne for some heat. i also found that it needed quite a bit of added salt at the end. i messed up and didn't have the green onions, and i definitely missed them. i also wish i'd had some cilantro on hand. i didn't feel like the parsley added much. i'll try this recipe again with green onion and cilantro.

It's good with double the spices when cooking the quinoa. Another trick is to marinate the garbanzos for up to a week in the refrigerator and double the garlic. Gets rave reviews even from meat lovers who would never eat a meatless meal. My 5-year-old even eats it.

I made a variation of this dish last night for my boyfriend and his roommate. I don't think either men are much for unfamiliar grains.. and they lapped up their plates. Note: Forgot the chickpeas, added mushrooms, green pepper, tomato (all roasted instead of grilled) some Jamaican spices, lemon juice on everything. Served with prawns marinated in lemon, olive oil, chili peppers, and some Sriracha hot sauce. LOVELY!

Yummy and satisfying. Trying to eat more meatless meals and this was light and delicious for a hot summer evening. It even tasted better cold the next day.

It's avocado season, apparently, because they're going for a buck a piece here in the Northeast (which is cheapcheapcheap compared to the buck- fifty they usually cost). So, I made this recipe with avocado instead of the grilled vegetables. Came out great.

If you want lots of flavor, double the spices, but for the first time try it as is, just to make sure. I also roasted the veggies (added onion and red pepper) rather than grilling. The highlight of the dish was the garbanzo beans and next time I will marinate for 2 hours (and add more garlic)! The end result was excellent, interesting and needed more salt. ;)

OH MAN! this dish was so good, everyone in my house (even the meat eaters) loved it. just recently switched from being a vegetarian to a vegan, and this was definitely my most successful egg- and dairy-free meal yet. like a few other reviewers, i roasted the zucchini and added an onion (turned oven to 450*, it took between 5 and 10 minutes for both to get tender) and then broiled for a couple minutes at the end. also used half parsley and half cilantro, which was perfect. i noticed a lot of other reviewers used this as a side dish for meat but it's filling enough on its own and the recipe made a ton. i will be making this many times in the future...

We really liked this as a side for beef tenderloin. Sub'd 1 c chicken broth for 1 c of the water to add flavor, but should have used even less salt than I did. My quinoa took *much* longer to fully absorb the broth and soften, but I think it may have been old. Next time I may add some nuts or dried fruit, seems quite versatile.

Rating: 3
I took other's advice and doubled the spices in the quinoa. I also used both zucchini and asparagus and roasted both in the oven. Subbed cilantro for parsley as I like it better. With those adjustments, this was a wonderful side to grilled salmon. Both yummy and healthy!

I am trying to cut back on meat and build up my repertoire of vegetarian dishes, and this one hit the spot. I really liked how the subtle seasoning from the paprika and cumin infused the quinoa. I left out the turmeric because I didn't have it. Ditto for the parsley; I substituted a smaller quantity of chopped cilantro which worked well. Next time I think I will add some other grilled vegetables like grilled onions and a yellow pepper along with the grilled zucchini. We had it as a main course but it could be either a side or a main. Will definitely make again.

I really enjoyed this dish. I have to agree with others that they spices need tweaking, but I enjoy adding my own touches to any dish, so I really liked making it. I would say in the future I would not add the zucchini just because it really didn't add much. I will make this dish in the future and try adding new ingredients to it!

Wow, was this great. Thanks to the reviewer who said to double the spices, it's something I can't wait to have again. And we're not even vegans. I found it very easy to just broil the zucchini (turning it once and leaving it broil until it's tender) while the quinoa was covered and cooking. Just a little extra olive oil helps the added spices also, so increase that by about double also. Enjoy!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. I did use roasted asparagus as one reviewer said, but I just didn't think that all the flavors came together without a lot of tweaking.

This is the perfect salad to make on Sunday and take to work for lunch during the week. So tasty and surprisingly filling. I took some of the other reviewer's advice: toasted the quinoa w the spices, added feta, used cilantro and a jalapeno. Also just roasted the zucchini in the oven. Delicious - will definitely be making this time and again.

This is incredible!! I don't even know why I like it. It just keeps getting better and better too. I've made it a bunch of times and I double the spices and also the lemon juice per recommendations. I've decided it's better with cilantro instead of the parley. I crave this. It's even good wrapped in a flour tortilla and warmed slightly with jalapenos mmmm. This is actually easy to make just set the timer for 4 minutes and turn zucchini 3 times rotating the grill pan in between and it's done in no time. The zucchini are cooked enough when they go limp. This is a keeper!

thanks to all the good recommendations, i found this to be a super salad. I cooked up a small onion and garlic with the spices, and i doubled the spices. I also toasted the quinoa before adding the water and added extra lemon juice and microplaned lemon rind to the chickpeas. All took this from a decent salad to great! Lots of flavor and super healthy!

Using *smoked* paprika is key, you need the smokey heat. Because I justy can't follow a recipe blindly...I doubled the spices in the quinoa which was perfect for my liking. Also used 1 additional T of lemon juice and used 2 medium zucchinis and added a roasted red pepper I charred, peeled and chopped. Lastly, no cumin seeds on hand so I added powdered cumin to the quinoa. I thought it was very good with some tweaking. Use it as a starting point and make it your own.

This is a great IDEA, but the actual recipe needs a lot of work. I modified it quite a bit & loved the outcome. The grilled vegetables (I added grilled red pepper and grilled spring onion bottoms) really made the dish. As everyone else has mentioned, you need to significantly up the spice and lemon (but leave out the turmeric on the veggies). Next time I will saute an onion, a little garlic, and ginger before adding the spices for the quinoa.

This was really good and super easy. I took other reviewers suggestions and doubled all the spices (plus some cayenne pepper). I also added a bell pepper in with the zucchini. I did as "a cook" suggested and toasted the Quinoa with the spices before adding the water which made a BIG difference from the last time I worked with this grain (sloppy mess, not pleasant to eat!). It was a hit, the S.O. had three helpings so this will go into the rotation, especially over the summer!

I made served this at a dinner party, and my guests couldn't get enough of it! I'd never eaten quinoa before, but I know I will be eating it again. I didn't follow the recipe precisely as I don't have a grill. Instead I sauteed the zucchini pieces with with a couple of tablespoons of Head Country BBQ seasoning. Leftovers also make a nice dinner with some cheese and red wine.

Had to make some changes based on what I had around- used crookneck squash for the zucchini and left out green onions. I had wanted to use green beans instead and wish I had because the squash got mushy and left the dish without a needed texture contrast, but it was still delicious. Love this method of making the quinoa, I also doubled the spices as suggested and thought it was right on. Look forward to trying this dish with more variations as the summer goes on.

end result was pretty yummy -- i doubled the spices due to concerns of blandness and the result was more than flavorful. This was my first try making quinoa and I had a hard time judging how dry the finished product should be -- as a result I think my dish was a bit wetter than it should have been even though my grains simmered for about 5mins longer than the suggested cooking time.

Overall, I can't believe how good this dish was. I'd told my fiancee that we should get ready to order carry out, after tasting the quinoa while it was cooking. Boy was I wrong: if you are worried about the flavor combo used in the quinoa or on the zucchini, wait until you get everything together. The addition of the lemon and the green onions are fantastic flavors that really nail this recipe. As a note, I didn't have a grill pan big enough for the zucchini and don't own a grill, so I cooked the squash in a skillet with a some oil. It worked out very well.

terrific. heeding some of the comments, I added a bit of Sriracha (chili paste) thinned in lemon juice.

Whenever I cook quinoa, I find that heating oil and adding the quinoa and whatever spices and cooking until it smells nice and toasted, and then adding the water to finish the process, makes a much richer and more flavorful dish. Got the idea from Didi Emmons' "Vegetarian Planet". Quinoa really soaks up flavor, though, so I doubled the spices and seasoning as well.

Wonderful! I changed a few things to give it the extra kick other reviewers felt was missing. I swapped lime juice for the lemon, threw in and sauteed a minced jalepeno (seeds and all) with the cumin seeds, turmeric, and paprika. I also sliced the squash prior to cooking, tossed the slices to coat with seasoning, and then seared the slices until just beginning to brown. Wonderful side dish, and with some chopped steamed chard, could make a great main course.

Wonderful! I changed a few things that I think added the extra kick a previous comment stated was lacking.

I have to caveat this review: I altered the recipe. I didn't have zucchini or green onions so I used spinach, sweet onions and added in some cashews for good measure. My recipe would read : "Meanwhile, prepare spinach. In medium pot add 2 cup water and boil spinach uncovered over medium-high heat. Boil spinach until tender (5-10 minutes), then add ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon paprika and parsley. Add 1/4 cup salted cashews. Stir to coat evenly. Simmer mixture until thoroughly mixed, 5-10 minutes. Transfer spinach to garbanzo bean mixture (keep the liquid from the spinach pot). Add 1/4 cup chopped sweet onion to the pot with the remaining spinach liquid and spices, stir and simmer until onion is tender (5 minutes). Add spinach/garbanzo mixture and onion/spice mixture to quinoa. Stir to blend. Season with salt and pepper.
