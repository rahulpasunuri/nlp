I used this recipe as inspiration for a roasted potato salad so didn't actually have all ingredients called for: no basil (roasted the potatoes with fresh thyme) and no red peppers (but I'll definitely try that next time around). I used 3 garlic cloves because I was afraid of it being to garlicky but it could have used more, roasting the garlic makes it much milder. Added feta and fresh spinach leaves to the hot potatoes, letting hte spinach wilt slightly and the cheese to melt. My guests loved it and I was surprised to be left without leftovers!

I accidentally omitted the balsamic. I added feta and sun-dried tomato. I ate it hot and it was delicious. I can't comment on the cold leftovers because there weren't any. I definitely liked how you could roast everything all at once.

I've been making this for 8 years and it's always a hit. I usually make it a day ahead & the flavors really meld. I add chopped green olives with the dressing, and feta or goat cheese at the last minute. I also use a little extra garlic and sometimes I add bacon, depending on who I am cooking for.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!! I used les olive oil to roast the veggies, and I put the potatoes first and then added the peppers in the last 10 mins only (I don't like them too soft). I used a whole garlic bulb with 1/4 cup of feta & 2 Tbs of chopped pine nuts, it was delicious! I will definitely make it again.

This was really good. I used white potatoes, blue potatoes and a sweet potato all together. It made a very colorful salad. We decided it was very tasty, but with all the different potatoes together, probably didn't need the red peppers. I agree with other reviewers that it could be tasty with some add-ins, like feta. It seems very adaptable, so we're going to try a bunch of different things until we get it just the way we like it. We had a very similar salad at a restaurant called Vasco da Gama in Montreal - they put in pieces of Portugese sausage in theirs. It was so tasty we had to search for a recipe!

I turned the oven down to 425 and the peppers still wound up being charred bits by the time the potatoes were done.

Tuna, pine nuts, goat cheese as the add-ons... great served warm.

Very good, but not very garlicky. Either the garlic cloves we used were too small, or we just needed to add more. I do agree that serving it warm is ideal. We added toasted pine nuts and kalamata olives. A great blend of flavors, and it looked very colorful.

Will make this again. A very versatile dish.

I made this for a party yesterday. It was a big hit with my guests. They were divided over whether they would prefer it warm or room temp, but everybody liked it. I will make this one regularly.

We love this! I keep roasted garlic puree in my refrig. as a matter of basic stock items. So I added it to the oil for the roasting. The garlic flavor was awesome and because I already had the puree made, I was able to adjust to taste. I did have to increase the oil a little, as I added chunks of grilled chicken and the pine nuts to the roasting pan with the peppers and potatoes. Topped with goat cheese and black olives to serve. Left-overs? What's that??

I knew I couldn't go wrong with a recipe containing 6 of my most favourite ingredients. The entire family liked it...except for one thing, the temperature. I think we all would have preferred the dish be hot, or at least warmer than room temperature. The one alteration I made was to add fresh green beans that had to be used...the resulting colour contrast was excellent.

I must be missing the point here, because this dish is fine served hot, but served cold I couldn't eat it. If I do make it again, I'll leave it in the oven longer and add the garlic mixture about 15 minutes before I remove it from the oven...

This is delicious! I did add feta cheese and pine nuts (sauteed in olive oil until browned). I also had leftovers though.

This recipe was recommended by a friend, who said she used it with great success. I tried it twice. First time, I used the recipe exactly. While it looked fabulous, I had a lot left over. I thought it needed something, so the next time I doubled the garlic and added the suggested cheese and pine nuts. Again, great presentation, guests ate what was on their plates, but no one went for seconds--my husband and I ate it as leftovers for days. The roasted garlic is too mild to give it much kick, and although balsamic vinegar is a favorite ingredient of mine and the cheese and pine nuts are nice, I didn't get the positive feedback from guests that other cooks have received. It's OK: good-looking, perfectly edible, but for me it's not the kind of company dish that can be counted on to be a hit and not generate lots of leftovers. Maybe try minced garlic rather than roasted, because I think a more pronounced garlic taste would greatly help, but I'm not making it again.

Great recipe. Very easy and delicious with grilled lamb chops and grilled asparagus. I reduced the balsamic and added toasted pine nuts and goat cheese as per other's recomendations. I also skipped the garlic step and used garlic from a jar to make it easier.

My friends love this salad, I get rave reviews every time I made it. Contrary to previous reviews, I found that the balsamic vinegar mellowed over time, so that by the time it was served most of my less-experienced-with-cooking friends didn't even realize vinegar was an ingredient.

I had this sald at a prty and it was wonderful. It was a big hit. With no mayo it was just the ticket for a summer get together! It got better with time, too!!

This dish was a big hit at two picnics. Since it isn't mayo based, I didn't worry about spoiling in warm weather. I cooked the potatoes and red pepper in aluminum foil on a gas grill (the garlic can be roasted the same way). My kitchen didn't heat up from the oven and clean up was a cinch.

I found this recipe to be extremely overrated. It is easy, but we found that the basalmic vinegar overwhelmed the dish. If you reduce the amount of vinegar, we'd give it a 2. It's ok, but nothing special.

My new favorite potato recipe!! We've dubbed them "insanely good pototoes" at our home. Definitely add pine nuts and goat cheese as others have recommended. YUM! (and very easy)

I toasted the pine nuts before using, better flavour.I used a bit of my homemade Basil olive oil with the regular olive oil in place of fresh Basil leaves. Feta cheese is great. Really yummy!

Definitely a keeper. My husband said they were the best potatoes he'd ever tasted. I used white fingerlings and drizzled a bit of olive oil on the garlic cloves before roasting (because I accidentally pulled the skin off some). I topped it with a fairly soft Chevre cheese that coated the potatoes slightly as it was mixed in. A nice addition, but I think it was just as good without. And I refrigerated the leftovers and they tasted great the next day. I think the key is to just roast them to a golden brown and tender, not crispy. And the red peppers weren't charred, just soft. Next time I might roast some onions in there with everthing. Superb!

This was a wonderful and very different recipe...I loved it and so did everyone else! I topped it with goat cheese and pine nuts, and it was terrific! I am making it again tomorrow for my 4th of July BBQ.

Feta and pine nuts helped make this a hit at a BBQ. Very easy to make ahead of time!

This is a keeper. I doubled the recipe for a large crowd and used two full heads of garlic. I roasted the potatos and peppers in the morning and let them cool on the stove. Once cooled, I mixed the "dressing" and tossed. I kept it in the refrigerator until two hours before serving. Just before serving I added the basil, pine nuts and feta cheese. Delicious! I've had many requests for the recipe.

I took my time and roasted the potatoes and charred the red peppers to perfection, mixed it with the vinegar, and it looked great. I then made the mistake of mixing it then with the goat cheese and pinenuts, and then placing it in the fridge. I served it the next day to a huge gathering and it had the texture of day old french fries. Needless to say there were plenty of leftovers and I was truly embarrassed. Maybe I was supposed to serve it that same day once it cooled to room temperature.

This is a hit every time I make this dish. My husband and I do a rib night once a year for a rather large crowd 35 to 40 people. I was searching for a great side dish and came across this wonderful alternative to a mayo based potato salad on epicurious.com. I use a little more garlic than the recipe calls for and sprinkling with the feta is a must. The great thing about this recipe is I've also made it for just the two of us - reducing the porportions.

I have made this for several cook outs, and it is always a hit. The vinegar gives a nice kick. I usually use more garlic though.

Delicious! I tried this recipe for a small gathering and the guests were begging for the recipe! The pine nuts and goat cheese were a must. Next time, I'll add more garlic and substitute the goat cheese with green olives for a little variety. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

This just didn't cut it for me or my husband. I took it to a bbq and everone "oohed" when I unwrapped the dish but no one went back for seconds. It just seemed to be missing something. I think maybe the goat cheese or pine nuts would help.

Delicious! I took this to a church picnic and had little left over. I added the pine nuts and threw in a bit more oil/vinegar. This is quick to make and tasted great at room temp as well as warm.

This is a great alternative to regular potato salad. I first made this salad when the recipe came out in 1997 and it has been a requested favorite at every barbeque since.

My husband doesn't like traditional, mayo. based potato salads, but he loved this one! It's a refreshing change from the regular heavy potato and pasta salad that always go with picnics. I give it "3-forks".
