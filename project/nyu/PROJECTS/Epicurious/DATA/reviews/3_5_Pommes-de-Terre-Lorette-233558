This originally was in Gourmet's first cookbook, 1985. My kids call them angel potatoes. They are so wonderful, and to keep them that way, I make them once a year at Christmas. Season the potato "paste" very well, and also, we fry them in duck or goose fat for a richer taste, but oil is decadent enough.

My roommates called these fancy tater tots, but they were much more complex. Practically ethereal in their lightness, crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside, these were wonderful. Not having pastry tips on hand, we used the method of just scooping some of the mixture with a spoon and scraping it off with another spoon. I think a small cookie scoop would have yielded more uniform shapes and looked nicer. I'm looking forward to making these again for a special occasion.

Disappointing and not worth the time and effort.

This is the first main/side recipe that my entire family loved. Kids ages 2,5,7 and spouse give it 4 forks. I give it 3 as I have to factor flavor in with effort. Making this is a bit challenging - probably because it was my first try. The dough is a bit tricky to form...

Fill the pastry bag only partly full of the potato mixture. It will take a bit of experience to get the right amount of potato in the oil but it is worth the trouble! Super yummy!!
