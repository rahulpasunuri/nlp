These were absolutely delicious. I was shocked, actually, by how delicious. We christened them "gyoza burgers" as that's exactly what they tasted like. Very moist, very very flavourful. Perfect for a summer day/night.

I have made something similar to this in the winter, instead of making burgers I brown the burger and seasonings in a skillet combining all the flavours. At the end I add fresh spinach and let it slightly wilt and serve it over brown rice with a squeeze of lime!

Awesome, awesome, awesome! Didn't have lemongrass so I substituted lemon rind and it worked perfectly. Kids LOVED them - not too spicy. Tons and tons of flavor and soooooo moist and juicy! I also was pressed for time so I did not let them sit in the fridge for an hour. I cannot imagine these being any better! This has officially been added to the rotation.

I'm surprised more people haven't tried this one since it's been around for years now! I think it helps that this recipe calls for dark turkey meat, which makes it juicier and more flavorful than your typical ground turkey. If you think turkey burgers are zzzzz, try this!

We're having this tonight for the first time. What else should I serve?

This is hands down one of the best turkey burger recipes I've ever had. I didn't even get around to making the lime-juice sauce and they were still fabulous. I used the kaiser rolls. Added a sesame-ginger dressing from safeway on the rolls instead, basil leaves, and avocado slices. This recipe is officially a favorite.

These are delicious! I made all four and froze 2, and they make a great quick meal. I would suggest adding a little salt to the ground turkey and spice paste. I make them on a grill pan in my kitchen and they cook exactly like the recipe says! A total winner!

Great recipe for spicing up a turkey burger. So many turkey burgers I've had turn out bland, this one has loads of flavor. Everyone enjoyed.

I am getting ready to make this for a 2nd time. I chopped mint, garlic, lemon grass (grow it myself, very small and delicate) basiil, and mint and incorporated it into the turkey burger instead of fooling with a paste. I then added some fish sauce, oyster sauce and a dash of red pepper flakes and a smide of dried mustard. Did the glaze as instructed. Much simpler, less production, and absolutely delicious. Be sure and chill well before grilling, and spray your grill with PAM to avoid sticking. Makes good leftovers, too. I may chop one up to use over pasta with peanut sauce.

I used lamb instead of turkey and didn't do any of the topping stuff. Also added an egg, some bread crumbs, cilantro and mint to the meat. It was one of, if not the most, amazing burgers that I've ever consumed.

Made this tonight and made adaptations since i didn't want to go to G-store. My family loved them. Here are my changes: no fish sause, no lemon grass, used "pickled jalopenos", used a half t of janes crazy salt, no other peppers except red pepper flakes. used basil and australian basil - no other fresh herbs, used light olive oil vs. veg oil. awesome! a little residual heat. Make round balls - 4oz a piece and lay on oiled grill (EVOO)- let them heat up and then "mash lightly" to make burgers once the burgers have hardened a little. W/o doing this they will get stuck.

the flavors didn't come together in this dish. I normally love southeast asian flavors and use lemongrass a lot but we didn't like this dish. The flavors actually seemed a bit weak

This is a wonderful and easy recipe. The sauce with fresh herbs is spectacular. I think next time I will make mini meatballs with this sauce as an appetizer. A fun change for burgers.

Quite a few flavour elements to purchase ($) and to taste (good). I followed the recipe as listed, although I found the shallots still in the grocery bag after the patties had been formed, so I sliced them up, carmelized them, and used as a topping (good). Re the herbs, as I had a few leftovers, I added them into the lime vinaigrette prior to storing in the fridge so they wouldn't darken. I ate this as a meal with vegetables rather than on a bun but either would be good. I do have a mini- chopper and I'm not sure I would tackle this recipe without one (mincing lemongrass is a pain).

Made this tonight and my husband and I are indecisive as to we like enough to make it again. I definitely liked the sauce and the herb mix is a must! I really think the herbs and the sauce stood out more than the turkey burgers. Gave it a 3 forks due to ease of making this dish and creativity, but overall taste and repeat, would probably be 2 forks. Sorry!!

I had trouble making a "paste" and so I added a bit more than a tsp. of water. This made the burgers a little too wet and a bit hard to grill. The flavors were wonderful, though, and we both had seconds. Yum, yum!

This must be the best burger I've ever had...! Moist, tasty and almost too simple to make. Made it as recipe is written, but added balsamico marinated red onions as garnish - turned out to be a good idea. Even my rather hard-to- please boyfriend seemed satisfied! Will definitely make this again!

Quite tasty and moist- a good alternative to basic turkey burgers.

Great burger. Made it as recipe is written. The only problem that I had was that the burgers stuck to the grill. I am not sure if it was because I forgot to oil the grill. I would like to try it again but I am afraid! I lost 1/4 of my burger on the grill because it got stuck. I don't think you need to make as much sauce as is called for.

Just made these burgers tonight and they were a big hit with my wife. I followed the recipe virtually unchanged though I only had fresh basil and cilantro, no mint. The fresh herbs and sauce on top of the burger really makes it a 4-fork recipe. We also thought the burgers themselves really had a lot of flavor. No mini food processor here so I had to make due by mincing and then using our little mortar and pestle. Worth the hassle :-)

wow. these were the best turkey burgers we've ever had. it seemed like so much prep work and def. took a little time, but really oh so very worth it in the end!!

Really good!! I must say I was skeptical about the fresh herbs, but they really MAKE the dish. My family couldn't wait an hour to "allow flavors to develop", and loved the burgers just the same.
