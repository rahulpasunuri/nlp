Excellent. I added a cup of raspberries. I toasted and ground 2 teaspoons of anise seed to the topping--truely exceptional.

I cut down the butter in the topping and used walnuts and toasted pine nuts instead. Delish!

So good and so easy! I followed the recipe with the exception I had a little more than 2-cups of rhubarb so I used it all. I also used salted pistachios because I like the contrast of sweet and salt. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

This was awesome! I made the topping in my food processor which made it really easy. Also, I added a litle splash of vanilla extract. Yum!

I have made this several times and it is always a winner. The last time I tried it with Blackberries instead of Blueberries and it was AMAZING! Going to make it again for dinner with friends tomorrow night. I have loved almost anything Rhubarb since I was little but this has to be my all time favorite! YUM!

Excellent! Added 1/2 cup oats to the topping and used pecans instead of pistachios. Served with vanilla bean ice cream. Will definitely make this again.

Made this recipe just about exactly as stated, with the only difference being not really measuring the fruit amounts. It came out really delicious! My partner who doesn't really know rhubarb was completely impressed. This recipe is also a great, simpler, subsitute for making a blueberry pie.

Exceptional. I dropped this off at neighbors before I had a chance to try it myself. TGI did not embarass! (Great chef's have a reputation to uphold) I thought strawberry rhubarb was perfection but now it's has an equal counterpart. As the previous reviewer said, double the filling and 1.5X the topping. No other modifications. thanks epicurious

I have made this four times and I absolutely love this crisp! I am all for short cuts, so I throw all but the butter for the topping in my food processor, blend it then toss in the butter (all at once and cut into Tbs) and pulse it together. One mistake I made, when my brain was absent, was toss frozen berries in with the rhubarb. While you can certainly use frozen berries (and rhubarb if it's out of season), they need to be room temp to bake this or the filling doesn't cook! Yeah I know, duh huh? Since we are at altitude I have to lower the temp and cook longer, however I don't really alter the ingredients (although rhubarb is sour and this isn't sweet enough for my taste...I add a full cup and use stevia powder instead of sugar) and it always comes out fine. I don't care for the written instructions that call for 3/4lb when it later says 2 cups...it's easier to eyeball 2 cups! If you want a winner this is it. Even my snobby "foodie" stepmother loved this.

I really enjoyed this dish and never figured rhubarb would work well with blueberries and cranberries (I used half frozen blueberries and half frozen cranberries plus rhubarb). I found that it wasn't too sweet, partly because I used cranberries. I would up the fruit portions, next time, though! Otherwise, dead on with the pistachio topping...

I made the recipe this morning and on the way home stopped to get ice cream for it, got home and no need for ice cream, it was already eaten by my husband whom normally doesn't like sweets. I was asked to make another one tomorrow. It's a keeper recipe that it looks like I'll be making often. Thanks!

Perfection! I used frozen wild blueberries, fresh rhubarb, and substituted a gluten-free baking mix for the flour. I doubled the recipe and 6 of us ate almost the entire thing. Don't forget the vanilla ice cream!

I have made this recipe at least 4 times this summer and have used a variety of fruit combinations with the rhubarb. I have also changed the nuts and have used toated pecans and walnuts with equally delicious results. Like another reviewer, I add crystallized ginger to the topping, which gives it some extra piquancy. Yum!

Rating: 4
The best there is and so easy! I've made this three times now. I like it best with blueberries. The sugar content is balanced when you follow the directions, but a but less doesn't hurt. A previous reviewer said they missed the salt in the topping. I used salted pistachios and that worked perfectly. My only gripe about this recipe is that it makes such a small amount!

Rating: 0
this dish got rave reviews from others (personally, i thought it was a little too sweet.) next time i will cut the sugar a bit. the fruit combo was amazing and married well together. a nice diversion from the strawberry rhubarb standby. easy to make and looks pretty. especially atop some dense vanilla ice cream.

Rating: 3
Loved the combination of flavors but did not love the topping consistency. It was grainy and greasy in sections. As though there was too much butter and too much sugar. I'll probably make this again using the fruit base but looking for an alternative to the topping.

This was a big hit! I made it with a smattering of Strawberries included. I think many different fruit fillings would be great with this crust/topping.

Very, Very Good! I did add a little more fruit as suggested in other reviews. Frozen blueberries worked great. Good warm or cold.

Unlike the previous reviewer that thought the two fruits didn't "marry" well, I felt this combination was wonderful. I will couple these two fruits together more often. Might use a little less sugar overall next time. Used fresh rhubarb (about 5 stalks) and at least 2-3 cups of frozen blueberries. Let it bake until brown and bubbly. Yum. My finicky daughter ate 2 servings. Great with vanilla ice cream.

Delicious and easy. I used strawberries instead of blueberries and it worked perfectly. I also added a piece of candied ginger in with the pistachios when I chopped them in my food processor. It was a perfect combination of flavors! You could experiment using any fruit.

I made this for dessert for a St. Patrick's Day meal. Easily this is one of my favorite desserts I've ever made on this website and I've made quite a few. I did use both frozen rhubarb and frozen blueberries, and other than that followed the recipe to the letter. This will be repeated anytime I'm looking for a Cobbler or Crisp. Simply divine and especially convenient with the use of frozen fruit!!!

Rating: 4
This turned out really well. It was a hit. We made it with pecan, because we didn't have pistachio and it turned out great. Although no measurements were done exactly because it is a crisp, we used a straight substitution of pecans for pistachios.

Rating: 3
I made this vegan by substituting margarine (Earth Balance) for the unsalted butter. That worked very well, especially to my taste as I need a pinch of salt in a dessert to really enjoy it fully. My only complaint is that the pistachio flavor wasnt as prominent as it could have been. If I were to make this again, I would add a teaspoon of pistachio extract to the topping ingredients, or perhaps better yet serve it with some homemade pistachio soy ice cream. Loved the blueberry-rhubarb combination!

Rating: 4
This is great. I would increase the fruit, as others have recommended, but it isn't too sweet as is. The pistachios add a great texture to the topping. Would definitely make again.

I loved this recipe! Very easy to make- excellent flavor, I added maybe 1/3 c. extra frozen organic blueberries to mine. I did think that it needed the amount called for of the butter to make the "crisp" stick together. Definately make it again!!

Wow! Great combination. I recommend using more fruit, as others have suggested, for a better proportion to the topping. I successfully substituted some splenda and almonds for the pistachios and cut the butter to 4 Tbsp. Try it, you'll be impressed by the great combination of fruit.

The fork stops here ... no need to change a thing about this recipe, it's p.e.r.f.e.c.t. just the way it is. Probably now one of my top 5 favorites. I think my boyfriend's father agrees, as I saw him walking with my pie plate, eating the last serving.

So good! I doubled the fruit but not the sugar and it was still plenty sweet for our taste. Unfortunately I didn't have pistachios but was fine with hazelnuts. Will definately make again but next time with the pistachios.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I made it for a gluten-free friend using rice flour, still great, and used less than half the butter. I would suggest adding a little lemon juice to the fruit mixture, it always pairs nicely with rhubarb and adds an acid to balance all of the sugars. The pistachios were DELICIOUS in the crust.

Rating: 4
This was delicious and easy. Made with strawberries instead of blueberries, which might have cut the rhubarb a little too much. The pistachio in the topping was divine - such a nice variation on the typical crisp topping.

I also used walnuts instead of pistachios. This was easy to reheat- we know it would be delicious with French Vanilla Ice-Cream!

I've made this dish many times, usually doubling the fruit, but not the topping. My husband likes it best with a few apples thrown in to cut the tartness. I've also used cranberries with good results when I'm out of blueberries.

I was not crazy about this dish and I love rhubarb..just don't think the rhubarb and blueberries "marry well". My husband ate it and thought it was ok but did not rave about it..think if I did it again, I would substitute strawberries for the blueberries..used reduced amount of butter which was fine and used hazel nuts which were also fine.

Rating: 3
This was quick and excellent. I also used hazelnuts, as no pistachios in the house, and I liked their flavor a lot (plus, they made this a completely "Oregon" dish, with the local blueberries and rhubarb from my garden). Thought it was a bit too sweet-and perhaps a pinch of salt in the topping would help.

Great! I cut the sugar, because in CA the berries are quite sweet and I did not want to deaden the rubarb. Also tried with hazelnuts instead and worked very well. Kids loved it.

This one's super easy--it only takes about 15 minutes to get in the oven. It's nicely tart too, with the blueberries providing much of the sweetness. I haven't had pistachios on hand when I made this, but slivered almonds (and a little lemon zest) make a decent substitute. I found this tasted about 'a fork' better at room temperature, unless you have lots of ice cream around.

I was a bit uncertain about the pistachios at first but in the end was very happy with the outcome. The flavor was the perfect compliment to the rhubarb & blueberries (frozen from last summer).

I have to go against the grain here. I didn't like this dessert at all, but I do have to say it was easy. First of all, the timing was way off, I think I cooked it for about 20 minutes total before it was bubbling and golden. I am a rhubarb fan and I think it was entirely too sour to go with the sweetness of the blueberries. It was too confusing in my mouth. I LOVE pistachios, but they are the wrong nut to use here. I would recommend walnut or pecan, the pistachio reminds me of baklava and just tastes too strong with this dessert. Finally, if you do makes this, I would agree with previous reviewers and cut down the amount of butter in the topping. 4 tblsp is enough.

I'm always looking for ways to use garden rhubarb, and this one is a winner. In a pinch, pecans or almonds work well if you're out of pistachios. And instead of chopping, I threw the nuts in the food processor.

Loved it! Wish i could have found preshelled pistachios, though! This is from a confirmed rhubarb loathing person- Husband had to bribe me taste it, and i was hooked. i substituted Splenda for the granulated sugar, and used 4 T of butter second time around, and it was just as great.

Wow, this crust ruled. I modified it to make it more pistachio-y and less buttery, using 3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup pistachios, and 2-3 T butter, mixing all in the food processor except for the butter; this turned out great. I also used blackberries and nectarines, squirting the fruit with lime juice, in place of the blueberries and rhubarb. My family went crazy over this. This is a crust to keep in mind whenever deluged with tasty fruit.

Made for a potluck at work and it got a top notch review. Mixed together in the morning and baked it while I showered and dressed. Very easy. Only substituted firm peaches for the rhubarb because I couldn't find rhubarb at my store. Delicious flavor and kept it's crisp. One guy was caught scraping the dish with his finger to get the last dregs!

I made this without the blueberries...mostly rhubarb and a few strawberries...and it was scrumptious. The pistachios are lovely, and don't worry if you only have salted ones, they work just fine. Take the advice about crumblechunking the topping, too. Next time, I'm making two.

Once I started making this (last summer)it became a real favourite as it's so easy - and in winter it's terrific with both frozen blueberries and grozen rhubarb. It's also delicious cold for breakfast, if for some strange reason you happen to have leftovers!

This is an excellent dish for experienced cooks or anyone who is looking for an easy-to-make dessert. I tripled the base and just doubled the topping because I had lots of rhubarb and blueberries and a huge crowd to feed but just a limited amount of pistachios. This didn't hamper the taste though -- it tasted great! I got my blueberries from my uncle's farm so the expense was minimal but think this recipe would taste just as good with less-expensive strawberries.
