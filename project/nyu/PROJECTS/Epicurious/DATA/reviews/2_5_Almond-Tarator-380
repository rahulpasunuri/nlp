I think there is too much bread in the tarator sauce. It seemed gluey. I might make the sauce again but use alot less bread.

I didn't have the chance to make the dish (yet), but one thing that I had found out, is that in the directions for making this recipe, it states adding garlic to the breadcrumbs, water, lemon. Although in the ingredient list, there is no garlic listed. I guess I will just have to guess at how much garlic to use. The dish itself does sound wonderful though, and I hope to try it out soon!

This recipe is for those that love Mediterranean food. The texture is similar to humus and taramasalada. It is exceptionally good with fish. I would dare to serve it as a dip.
