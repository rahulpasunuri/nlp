I really, really love this recipe - use more fennel, it cooks down quite a bit. The broth makes for a very yummy gravy, too.

This is a great sunday dinner! I have a hard time eating chicken. Chicken always just taste like chicken, but not this recipe....

Once again, we used this recipe for Thanksgiving. We cooked two large chickens (for 13 people) and they were fantastic! The meat was so moist and tasty. Nobody missed turkey since the chicken was even better. I can't wait to eat the leftovers.

Oh baby. While I'm not always the biggest fan of anise, this works really really well. For extra flavor stuff as much of the fresh herbs and salt under the skin as possible. We cooked potatoes in the pan alongside the chicken and they also turned out wonderfully.

This was delish! My produce store didn't have the fresh margoram or tarragon, so I used fresh oregano, rosemary, thyme, parsley and some of the fronds from the fennel as well as dried tarragon. I also chopped some of the stems from the fennel to stuff the chicken with. I cooked the fennel in a small amount of chicken broth and saved that for basting. I also cooked the fennel outside the bird and added wedges of sweet onion. The cooking method was great, allowing for a moist chicken. I am no novice to roast chickens and this is one of the better recipes. The fennel was carmalized and sweet!

Wow, this is fantastic! See no reason to parboil the fennel - just tossed it into the bottom of the pan with potatoes.Cavity only had herbs, lemon, onion.

Fantastic dish. Made this w/chicken breasts and fennel braised beneath. Chicken was moist and flavor full. Shitake and leek risotto at this site was a great accompaniment along w/broasted garlic broccolini.

Best roast chicken ever! Used a 7lb organic chicken and frozen chopped fennel from my garden, some inside and out of chicken. Delicious combination of spices and herbs. Also, added quartered potatoes to roasting pan.

The first time I made this recipe, the fennel flavor went down the sink with the cooking liquid. The next time, I cooked the fennel in a mixture of chicken broth and white whine, then cooked that liquid down and added it to the chicken. Bingo! That worked beautifully. The entire familiy loved it - even the teenagers!

Delishhhh! I roasted 5 chickens with lots of fennel for Rosh Hashana. I cook all the time but had never used fennel before. The scent of anise filled the house. The vegetables were tender and tasty. The chicken was juicy and full of flavor. I cut it in the kitchen and served it on the buffet table. It goes very nice with rice pilaf (almonds, olives, raisins and sundried tomatoes). Everybody loved it. Even the kids. I put a whole chicken in a freezer bag once it was cool and froze it a couple of weeks. Then served it for Sunday family dinner and it was again a great success.

Delicious, moist and flavorful. My family likes the addition of red onions.

We've been using this basic recipe for a few years now. The chicken comes out great every time. The first few times we followed the recipe to a tee and were very pleased, but have since been experimenting with our own rubs and seasonings. If you follow the recipe for times and oven temp, you can really play around with this chicken. It's definitely a showy bird, packed with flavor and very moist. We've never been disappointed.

Excellent...some work involved in the preparation, but the flavor was great. Even better the next day. The fennel was fabulous!

This recipe is simple and yummy. I love roast chicken, but using the herbs makes the chicken a little tastier and elegant than just plain seasoning, and the fennel makes it unique. I've made it twice and enjoyed it both times. Last night I used two chicken leg quarters instead of a whole bird since I was only cooking for two. I just placed the legs on top of the fennel mix in a dutch oven and roasted it per the directions above. The result was a satisfying meal.

Great recipe! I used organic chicken from a local farmers market, which made it that much better. I, also, cooked the fennel on the outside. If you like fennel, you've got to add more than the recipe calls for.

Marginal recipe! First time I've gotten a bum recipe on epicurious! The fennel is delicious, but the chicken is just ok, definitely NOT stellar!

I am not the cooking type but the instructions made it simple to prepare and the result was a simply delish dish. My fiance said it was "restaurant quality". The chicken did not need a knife, the pieces just fell off and the fennel & rosemary added an exotic yumminess.

Made this last night and loved loved loved it. I have never used Fennel before and loved the flavor of it braised. Don't let the taste of it raw scare you away

This qualifies as an "ohmygod" recipe. This is the first time I have cooked with fennel, not to be the last. I added quartered red potatoes to the roasting pan, and basted them with the chicken... Don't over think this recipe - just do it.

Sorry. Don't know what the fuss is about with this recipe. It was ok but nothing to write home about. There are much better roasted chicken recipes out there.

My first time roasting a chicken and it turned out perfectly. I used just one fresh 2-3 lb. chicken and so I halved the ingredients, kept the fennel on the outside like others suggested, and stuffed the chicken with a lemon half instead. I couldn't find the suggested wine so I used a pinot grigio. Very moist, sauce is wonderful, everyone loved it. My only problem was that I only made one chicken and it was gone too quickly.

This was a wonderfully moist roast chicken recipe. I substituted fresh basil leaves for some of the spices such as rosemary and which i didn't have on hand. I also only used one fennel bulb since it was priced at $2.00 for one. It added enough flavour and was enough to put inside 2 chickens and spread some on the sides. The fennel that was roasted on the outside of the chicken was absolutely delicious!

The rosemary chicken is delicious and the roasted fennel is beyond compare! A few celery stalks can be added but the fennel will steal the show. I agree with a previous reviewer that most fennels are best kept outside the bird.

Just doesn't get any better than this. Made this for my parents for dinner with the Potato Fennel & Parsnip Mash. Was a huge hit. Did two chickens even though it was only 3 of us as I knew the leftovers would be useful, even freezing some of the cut up chicken and then making awesome stock with all of the carcass and the extra fresh herbs I had on hand. None of it went to waste. This will be a standard.

Absolutely delicious! This is a good example of how once prep is completed with fresh ingredients, it practically takes care of itself. Added root vegetables and squash with olive oil rosemary to roasting pan for a wonderful accompaniment. Don't be afraid to substitute garden fresh herbs, e.g. sage, if you don't have some of the others.

Excellent recipe but be careful with the salt! If you've already generously salted the water when boiling the fennel, you don't need to add as much to the fennel seed/herb mixture. Also cooked the fennel outside the bird and reduced the cooking time by 15 minutes.

I made this with 6 pounds of chicken thighs instead of a whole bird. I followed everything else exactly except used fresh oregano instead of marjoram because I couldn't locate it at the store. It was a hit at a dinner party with Eggplant parmagiana, a pasta and broccoli dish and a green salad. Very moist, with interesting flavor combinations. I sprinkled the lemon juice over the chicken, placed in two large 9X13 pans and rubbed with the herb mix. Tossed everything with the par cooked fennel sections and baked in a 400 degree oven about 45 minutes. It was a great success!

I make this dish using cornish hens. Halving the hens shortens the cooking time, and you can get creative with plating. Garnish with sprigs of fresh thyme! Great dinner party fare.

made it once on my gas weber rotisserie, scrumptious. Making it again tonight on my new infrared rotisserie, I expect similar results. My first recipe using fennel bulbs, I found that the local safeway has mis-labeled it as anise. The food lover's companion lists this as a common error. Anyway, the fennel, garlic, FRESH herb combo is wonderful. This has replaced my lemon, onion fresh-thyme mix as my first choice for roast chicken.

This is a superb chicken dish; moist and full of wonderful flavors. The fennel was a real hit; I stuffed the birds with some of it as called for in the recipe. I served an Aglianico del Vulture instead of the Poggio del Sasso, and it provided a real complement to the chicken. This is a real keeper.

A definite keeper for anyone wanting something new to do with a roast chicken. Very moist, great flavor, and not too labor intensive. Using fresh herbs adds to the taste. The lemon, herb, fennel combination is a winner.

My husband and I enjoy this recipe so much that I now make it every Saturday. I agree with the other reviewers to let the fennel roast outside the chicken. I stuff the chicken with lemon, onion, garlic and rosemary. This is an outstanding recipe.

This dish is fantastic!! I was never a huge fan of fennel - now I am a convert. The flavors of the fennel and herbs in the wine/stock mixture is incredible. I've made this several times and each time it is even better than I remember. Tip: you don't need to cook it quite as long as the recipe indicates.

Nice taste and very moist bird. Took other reviewers advice and roasted without stuffing the fennel, stuffed instead with half a lemon.

Best roasted chicken ever. Rave reviews when served....One odd experience. Halved recipe and it came out to the minute. Cooked 2 birds in a true convection oven and it took 40 minutes longer. Still trying to figure that one out.

This was very good - very moist. We used one 7-lb chicken and roasted it longer, of course. The fennel flavor really came through! We will definately make this again.

This was very tasty & juicy and will definitely make this again, maybe even for guests. The only change I would make is to not stuff the chicken with the fennel & garlic but roast in the pan with the juices - much tastier. Fennel & garlic inside chicken was not sufficiently cooked. That would mean roasting the unstuffed chicken a little less time so it doesn't dry out. The fat-skimmed pan juices poured over the carved meat really adds a great flavor. This was relatively easy to make and I highly recommend it.
