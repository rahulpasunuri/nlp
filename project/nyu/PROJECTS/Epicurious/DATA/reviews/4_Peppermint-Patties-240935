These were a dream. I did one batch in peppermint and a second batch using orange extract, then used various sprinkles to differentiate the two. I also used quite a bit more extract than called for because the batter still tasted quite sweet to me after I used the amount the recipe called for. Anyway: huge hit! Everyone is raving. Success!

These were pretty easy to make, but the filling is super sweet. I didn't expect that, despite the amount of sugar in the recipe, because of how strong mint extract (I only ever use pure peppermint) can be. In this recipe, the peppermint was an after note and only showed up once the candy was almost gone. My fiance said that was his only criticism. I will make them again, but next time I'm cutting back the water a bit and adding more peppermint.

My patties weren't close to being frozen after the recommended 15 minutes. I took the advice of one reviewer and rolled the filling in to small balls and then flatten them. I then put them back in the freezer. My first few that I dipped, melted the patties so they look like clumps. So I tried putting a thin layer of chocolate on the patties and put them back in the freezer. After 15 min or so, I tried dipping again... these looked much better. As other reviewers, I only got 25 patties.

Danish Dough Proofing Guide Danish dough/Laminated dough should be proofed at a temperature of 75-80 Farenheit with an approximate Humidity of 80% Sources: Very good Patty recipe, I use the peppermint extract from AUI (Albert Uster Imports--shipped in from Switerland) For those of you having difficulty tempering chocolate, what the writer of the recipe neglected to tell you was that you need to be using a High Cocoa Butter Content Chocolate, with a minimum Cocoa Butter Content of at least 32%. If you are having difficulty maintaining temperature of your chocolate, Melt your dark chocolate up to 120F them use the seeding method and seed in 1/3 of your unmelted chocolate, and continue to agitate your chocolate until it has reached 80. 80 is a desirable temperature because the Beta 6 crystals in the Coverture chocolate will have set up to create a good temper. The working temperature for the Dark Chocolate is between 86-88. Anything over 90 Degrees will knock the chocolate out of temper, and you will have to start over. I find the best way to maintain the temper/temperature of my chocolate is to let my Stainless steel bowl of chocolate rest on a heating pad that is on low, and to agitate the chocolate every few minutes. This is a stellar recipe, and if Tempering chocolate doesn't sound like its for you, you can always cheat and purchase Confectionary Coating, also known as Coating Chocolate/Dipping Chocolate/Almond Bark. **Tempering your chocolate prevents steakyness or Cocoa Butter/Fat Bloom.

These are HEAVENLY! So far I've fed them to my husband and co-workers, who all gave them rave reviews. I followed the recipe almost exactly (substituted Ghirardelli 60% cacao for the 70%)and did not experience any problems with tempering like some of the other reviewers. I will definitely make these again and again!

I loved this recipe! So much better than anything commercially made. It was so easy I have made 3 batches since reading the recipe. I suggest you temper the chocolate in the microwave-see Barefoot Contessa tips for tempering chocolate. My family loved this candy and I loved it because I controlled everything that goes in and there are no artificial chemicals. I adore Bon Appetite and read it cover to cover every month and always try new foods and have the most beautiful and tasty food. I always credit the magazine and web site and share many recipes.

These candies were just ok. Fun to present to friends but the taste... I agree with a previous reviewer, they are no better than York Peppermint Patties. I had no trouble with dipping and coating each piece and I only ended up with about 30 candies, not the 4 doz it says.

Rating: 1
These were a disaster! I am prety patient, but having to keep the temperature of the chocolate between 88 and 91 degrees drove me crazy. I had only a small window to dip the patties and then it would be too cold and the chocolate would clump up. If I warmed up the chocolate, it would get way too hot very quickly and then I had to wait forever for it to cool down. I ended up giving up on getting the temperature exactly right, which is probably why they don't look so great. They taste good, but no different than York Peppermint Patties, so I don't think they are worth the effort.

I have a question...does anyone know why these need to be refrigerated after they're made? We haven't made them yet -- but would like to -- was just wondering which ingredients/attributes necessitated chilling...? Thank you for any answers.

Chocolate and mint - how can it not be good? There is a British company that makes patties like this but puts crushed peppermint candies (like Starlight mints) between the top of the patty and the dark chocolate. Think I may try that next. Yumm!

Rating: 4
These come out beautifully IF you freeze the rounds solid first. Do not even attempt to dip them into the chocolate without completely freezing them, or they will melt into blobs. I braved the heat and dipped them with my fingers because I couldn't hold them well with forks. They looked great.

Just finished making these, they taste wonderful! I doubled and then some the peppermint extract. I really like my peppermint patties to pop. It was slightly challenging to keep the chocolate at the right temperature, but I use a relic of a stove that doesn't allow for fine adjustment of temps. :( All said, I found that waiting for a count of 10 before putting the ridges on the patties helped define them better. My husband, not a fan of peppermint patties usually, really likes these! They're definitely worth the effort and I'd certainly make them again. They'll provide the "Wow" factor that I need for my holiday gift baskets to the inlaws. I'm shooting for impressive and these fit the bill for sure! Oh, I forgot, I also didn't have shortening, so I used extra fine virgin olive oil instead. Turned out perfectly regardless. Go figure. :)

these were fun, not too much work, and felt like something different. I love the idea of making them for valentine's day. I followed the log suggestion of others and was glad I skipped the step. no trouble dipping--instead of lowering it into the chocolate though, I just threw it in there and fished it out. no melting issues, but my chocolate may have been cooler than recommended.

My 11yr old daughter made these for my Christmas party. They were sooooooo yummy and got rave reviews. She used a decorative cutter, so they were pretty too. There weren't any left. I am making them for a cookie/sweet exchange and my next holiday party. Super easy to make too!

Rating: 3
Just like a York peppermint patty. I doubled the extract and the flavor was just right. Using waxed paper I rolled the mixture into a log and froze it. When the chocolate was ready I sliced rounds and dipped. The hardest part is letting the excess chocolate run off before the patty melted,a couple practice patties (all edible) and it went quickly. Simple, easy and a different twist on candy.

These were fantastic! I think I'm going to add them to my holiday boxes this year. I'll do what I did this time: I divided the filling in half before adding the extract. One half got the peppermint (about 1/4 + 1/8 tsp. because I like mint!), and the other half for raspberry extract and 2 drops of red food coloring. This doesn't use that much chocolate if you make the coating thin, so it's an economical gift as well. I'm going to add a few flavors when I make them for the holidays--maybe a green tea one and an orange one and a lavender one. I'm looking forward to making these again!

These were awesome. My friends who I made them for are still raving over them. I used heart shaped cookie cutters since they were for valentine's day. They only made about half of what the recipe says here, and they were pretty thin-melted a little when I dipped them in the chocolate. I also used about 1 tsp of the peppermint extract, which was so yummy.

Oh man, did I have trouble with these. I swore I'd not make them again, they were so difficult for me. I followed the instructions precisely, but they just turned into weird globs when I put them in the chocolate. However, they were such a hit at work that it caused people to make suggestions on a better way to 'dip' them. My boss suggested the following: Make tiny balls with the peppermint filling, and skewer them on a shish kebab skewer. Freeze, then try pouring over the chocolate while turning. Then freeze again and remove from skewer. I thought that idea had some potential, and will try it next time I make these.

It's the novelty of making your own candy that was fun for me. This project wasn't so time-consuming as to be off-putting. I used Baker's bittersweet chocolate, which contained slightly less the percentage of cacao required, but which was cheaper, easier to divide, and just as good. I, too, found the rolled log method to be a good choice. Had a hard time with the chocolate bath in that it took forever for the chocolate to cool down to 80 and also was too thick. Seemed overly sensitive to changes in heat, so I just went ahead and dipped the disks as best I could, not concerning myself too much with aesthetics. Some came out perfect, others, less than. But all were so delicious...addictive even. I used McCormick's Mint Extract, which is a blend of mints, so they taste different than a York P.P. I might color the filling next time, just for fun. Might also experiment with adding paraffin wax, which I recently used for peanut butter balls and which not only gave the chocolate coating a sheen, but also thinned it a bit. Not sure whether this would be appropriate, but it's worth a try.

if u use peppermint oil it has a much stronger flavor and u only need a drop or 2 have use it my self in place of peppermint extract and it work real well family and friend love it

Absolutely delicious, especially at room temperature; however, what a task! I took 2 suggestions from other reviewers (1) roll mint into a log, freeze and then slice and (2) dip mints into chocolate using chopsticks. Both worked well, but I still ended up with not-so- pretty-patties. For some reason, my chocolate was a little thick also. At the suggestion of a co-worker who loved these candies, next time I might place each mint patty in a pan of miniature cupcake papers and then pour melted chocolate over each patty to cover well. I'm picturing it similar to miniature peanut butter cups. Just peel off the paper and enjoy. This could work.....

These were very easy to make. I did not think they were any better than a York peppermint patty, but others loved them. I would agree with other reviewers that one might want to increase the peppermint slightly. The chocolate did oxidize after sitting out for a little while.

These were really good, though they are time consuming and some of them did get a bit of a bloom, though I tried my best to follow the tempering directions. Like others, I doubled the mint extract as I found the original proportions too sweet and not minty enough. I might even add a bit more next time, as I am a real peppermint fan.

I think these are fabulous. I actually used a star cutter for the shape with great success. They were pretty and festive for the holidays. I think the round would be much easier but the star shape is worth the effort. I love the chopstick idea!

These are pretty good, but upon a side by side taste test with a York peppermint patty, I don't know that they were superior enough to justify the work. I recommend rolling them a bit thicker than 1/4"; I thought the chocolate to filling ratio was a bit high as written. I also added extra mint to the filling and could probably have used even more.

Rating: 4
Hey, so they are not perfect looking but they are so good! The flavor & satisfaction of doing it yourself is well worth the hassle. My biggest problem was getting the mint off the fork after enrobement, I solved this problem by placing the end of the mint dangling off the edge of the fork onto the parchment then turning the fork upside down end over end & the mint reluctantly peeled itself off. The heating freezing cooling heating cooling freezing heating pandemonium was tedious but fun.

I was wary of trying this since I'm not an experienced baker but I love mint. They turned out really well- not as pretty as the photo but pretty darn close. I think the trick was 1) really follow the prescribed temperatures for the chocolate 2) make sure the patties are not cut too thin- the flimsier ones I had did start t melt 3) go ahead and just work on a shift at a time, keeping the other patties in the freeze so they stay cold. I also skipped the fork and used chopsticks- I tossed patties in the chocolate and then pulled them out with the chopsticks which was cleaner, saved chocolate and also gave the patties lines from the chopsticks. Worked for me!

I was wary to try this as I have only successfully made basic cookies and cakes. But i do love mint. I found this quite easy! Beware that when it says to beat the sugar/corn syrup/peppermint/etc until 'just combined'- it can still be pretty crumbly. When you knead it for about 4 minutes, it does really become smooth. I made sure my chocolate temps were as prescribed and the patties,while not as perfect as the photo, are pretty darn close! I think this was pretty easy though it does take time- heating and measuring the chocolate temps to be just right. But they are a very unique treat- I'm going to make more tomorrow.

I'll save everyone a lot of cookie cutter trouble. Roll the mint filling into two logs about 1 inch in diameter, freeze well and then use a good knife to slice into 1/4 inch thick slices. You need to reshape them slightly, but unless you are very talented with your chocolate dipping, these will look a bit rustic anyway. Mine didn't "melt" but I froze them on a parchment lined heavy plastic chopping board after cutting. The cold board kept the filling disks cold while I floundered around with the tempering process. I made these for my dairy/egg allergic daughter using melted chocolate chips from Divvies and they were great treat!

I would love to know what I did wrong. I have been cooking from Gourmet and Bon Appetit for 15 years and this has been my only total disaster. Yes, they taste great, but they are misshapen blobs that I could never present to anyone. I kept the filling frozen firm, the chocolate was tempered and the exact temperature it should have been. I dutifully thunked and scraped the fork and they are still an ugly mess. I expect confections to be a labor of love, but this was an afternoon and some very good ingredients lost.

These are delightful. Mine look very ugly, but that is probably just that I am not used to dipping candy and need a bit more practice. Next time that I try them I will add more peppermint as I like a bit more of a minty flavor.

This recipe is well worth the angst. I agree with the other reviewers that it won't look like the picture, but they were so delicious that I think I'll be making these every year. I had to use 2 T. more water than the recipe called for for the dough to come together. It should be the consistency of fondant icing - if any softer than that, I could see how people had problems with it "melting" when dipped. Once I got the hang of it, though, I flew through the recipe! BTW, I only got about 2 dozen, and my patties were pretty small.

This was such a simple recipe but very impressive. I didn't have any trouble with the mint patties "melting" while dipping them in choclate like other people have mentioned. Also, I skipped making the lines on the top because they just looked messier that way.

They are easy to make and I am not very good at rolling out any kind of dough. So that was my biggest challenge. As the other review say make sure they are cold or it will be difficult. Use a plastic fork and break out the middle 2 prongs and it is very easy to dip. Will be making more this weekend for give aways and my office holiday paryt. The only thing I can add is I did not get any where near the 4 dozen the recipe says it makes

I made these tonight, and after some trial and error, they turned out really well! I noted what a previous reviewer said about them melting a bit, and I left mine in the freezer right up until I dipped them. I just grabbed one or two out of the freezer at a time, and that worked great. They didn't melt at all. My only other advice about getting them to look pretty like the picture, is to make sure you scrape off the excess chocolate on the side of the bowl after you dunk them, and use a seperate fork to make the lines at the top. I kept a seperate fork from the one I dunked with, and kept it clean in between making the fork marks, and they came out great. I'm going to have them for a party this weekend, and put them in favor boxes for people to take home. They are so yummy....I'll never be able to buy them in the store again!

I am making these now. I am having a bit of a time with using the forks to submerge the mints into the chocolate. I have only done a dozen or so but they are looking good. I melted the chocolate in a double boiler but have it on the warmer zone of our oven as to not overheat it. I also used belgian chocolate and I must say these are a treat and we plan to give them to our neighbors as presents.

These are really really good. Here's a little advice, though. 1. Make sure your kitchen is cold when you do this. I made these while I was making lots of other stuff. Even though I froze the filling until it was firm, by the time I got it cut out it had warmed up again and wouldn't come apart in nice little circles. So, I tried my pizza wheel, and that just made lines in it. Eventually I just made little balls and flattened them with my palms, which worked just fine (and made my palms deliciously minty). If you do it that way, make sure you put enough powdered sugar on your hands so it doesn't stick too much. 2. Make sure your chocolate isn't too hot. These candies will *melt* in the chocolate if it's too warm. Not that minty chocolate is bad, but if you've just spent an hour wrestling with filling, rolling it, cutting it, trying it again, rolling it into balls and flattening it (like I did), the last thing you want is for them to melt in the chocolate. 3. I have no idea who can lower a candy balanced on a fork, submerge it, and pull it out so it looks like the ones in the photo. Mine ended up more "organic-looking" which made them no less delicious. 4. Make sure you've got plenty of bourbon on hand (the recipe for the "perfect manhattan" in the same issue works nicely), because if you have the same pitfalls I had, you'll need a stiff drink to make it through to the end. (Maybe this is why I couldn't balance a candy on the fork?) 5. If you've got left over melted chocolate, nobody says you can't dip these twice! Slightly minty melted chocolate is also good on ice cream. And rice krispy treats. All that having been said, these are very good, and I would most definitely make them again, but this time I'm going to take a more laissez-faire approach and not worry so much if they're not pretty like the photo.
