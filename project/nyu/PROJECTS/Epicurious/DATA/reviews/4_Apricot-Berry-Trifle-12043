Made this twice and people devoured it both times. My only quibble-too much liquid for the amount of cake. I've thickened the custard but next time, I will adjust the fruit purees as well.

This really was a lot of work; however, the result was outstanding. My family asked for seconds even after a big Christmas dinner!

The custard, cake and fruits were each excellent before they were combined, but the flavors were lost when they were layered. The whole was less then the sum of its parts, and the enormous effort involved over several days was not worth it.

i agree. the flavor is delicious. however, i made a beginner's mistake. having never cooked pudding/custard before, i worried about burning the milk and removed it from the heat before it reached a full boil. in consequence (i think), my cornstarch didn't activate and my pudding never thickened. any suggestions re: what to do with runny, apricot-flavored cream?

This is the third time this year I've been requested to make this recipe. Thank God it's on-line!!

I've made this trifle twice and both times it was great. It takes a little effort to put it all together but it is worth it. For a spectacular presentation make individule servings in tall stem glasses.

I have made this many times since it first appeared in 1992. It is wonderful. (I often make the sponge cake to use with fresh fruit and whipped cream/homemade ice cream.

THIS WAS EXCELLENT!!! Followed the recipe to a tee. It is a little time consuming but the raves you get from your guests makes it all worth the effort. Don't pass this one up!!

Delicious! Although not a simple recipe (took three days to make the first time around), it always turns out great and impresses everyone!

It's a lot of work to make, but well worth it. I get rave reviews every time.

This is one of the best desserts I've ever made, but it is time consuming. When it's finished it's both delicious and very pretty, so make sure you have a clear glass dish to show off the layers.
