A new favorite way to serve asparagus- works well with green if you're in the US and white asparagus isn't available. I use a little less of the sauce just to cut down on fat and don't think anyone misses it.

I don't know how they sell it in the states - but in Germany white asparagus is much more common than the green kind so it's a staple in spring cooking. Important note. It mus be peeled! And we only remove about an inch off the bottom...

This is to-die-for! Came out perfect and so tasty.

I was unsure what to do with white asparagus and this was a great first recipe. White asparagus does not taste like green asparagus - sort of a mild caulflower taste and firmer. I added some minced onion sprinkled over the asparagus before the sauce. I will also cut the spears in 1" pieces next time as it was hard to serve.
