SO easy to make! The only modification I made was to add some vanilla to the crepes. Definitely a go-to recipe no matter what filling you love.

Fantastic crepes! Fluffy, somewhat akin to "puff pancake", yet thin enough to be true crepes. Very easy to make, and the single-portion recipe quantities make it foolproof in terms of ingredient quantities vs. making one large batch of batter and dividing it evenly among the desired number of crepes. I modified this by adding some nutmeg, vanilla extract and dark rum. It was a bit hit!

I make this recipe all the time. It's actually enough for 5 small crapes. I sometimes use stawberries and bananas, or blackberries and nutella as the filler. Always a hit at my house!

I have only used the receipe for the filling, but have done so about 4 times. It is amazing! What I liked even better was using strawberry instead of orange. The strawberry with banana was excellent. It was also a lot less work than the oranges, and we got the orange flavor from the Grand Marnier! It's a keeper!

We only made the crepes - my first attempt. So I had issues with flipping, need more practice. But the recipe was delicious, my kids loved them with simple butter and cinn/sugar on top.

This was fantastic. Did not use Grand Marnier, just orange juice and warmed the fruit with juice in the pan for a bit. Added yogurt. I never made crepes before and they turned out perfect. Very easy recipe. My 4-year-old twins devoured it!

Delicious! I also made the sauce as filling and doubled the crepe recipe. Made 5 - perfect for 2 hungry people.

Took a spin off of what Anna below here did. I doubled the whole crepe batter recipe. I sliced up banana and strawberry, and the put some strawberries into a food processor. Instead of an orange glaze sauce, I did a strawberry one. Tossed all of my fruit in a pan with the sauce and some cinnamon and let it reduce. Folded 3 crepes in half and layerd them in the center of the plate, put the fruit on each side, a couple scoops of vanilla yogurt on the crepes, and then some drops of the sauce on top of the yogurt. The best breakfast in a while.

I made this Christmas morning, but used the crepe recipe that came with my crepe maker instead, and it was delicious. I used a whole regular banana, and instead of soaking the crepes in the liquid, just used that part of the recipe as a filling. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe and it was wonderful!

These crepes were delicious. Will try them again with other fruits. There was even enough batter to toss away the first crepe as I had just reseasoned my crepe pan.

This was a great light and very delicious recipe. I would very much like to make this for some of my best friends.

This is worth four forks because of its ease and flexibility. I used a different crepe recipe altogether and modified the filling here a bit. Instead of navel oranges, I used Clementines, also didn't have any appropriate liquor on hand so used extra orange juice for liquid. Topped off with a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg and it was very tasty.

I just made the sauce/topping for the crepes, and just used bananas as the filling. The sauce is very good and the orange juice adds a great flavor, even if you don't like oranges that much. I used some French brandy instead of Grand Marnier and it worked well. I would suggest doubling the sauce recipe if you have really big crepes, because the crepes should be soaked completely through. Delicious for making as a basis for any sweet crepes! I filled it with bananas and strawberries and vanilla yogurt and cinammon.

Yum! I added some cinnamon to the orange/banana mixture too, simply because I love cinnamon. Fun and delicious! My three old son loved them too!

Delicious! It was my very first time making crepes and I need to admit that they did not turn out pretty. This recipe gives me enough motivation to keep trying as I would like to serve it to guests. Oh, what I'll have to suffer!

These were superb! I always thought crepes were difficult to make...I proved myself wrong this time. I didnt use oranges-- I used chopped peaches. I didnt have alcohol-- so i substituted with vanilla extract. Don't forget maple syrup when serving :)

I added an additional Tablespoon of flour to the batter. Didn't change anything else. Delicious!! Next time I'll make the sauce separate though, since I'm cooking for a large family, that way as crepes are finished I can continue with preparation and serve immediately.

The crepes look gorgeous in the plates, you will almost feel like you are at the restaurant.

This dish was so tasty. My boyfriend couldn't stop licking his plate. I didn't have pecan nuts so I just sprinkled some coconut powder and I didn't change anything else. Made it for breakfast but would make at excellent dessert as well.
