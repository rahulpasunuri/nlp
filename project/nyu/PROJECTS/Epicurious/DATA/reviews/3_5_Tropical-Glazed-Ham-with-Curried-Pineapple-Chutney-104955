This was very nice. It smelled delicious while cooking. I skipped the lime peel, lemon peel and ginger because I wanted it to be smooth and can't say it was lacking in anything.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving in 2003 and I have been sentenced to make it every year since. It's bursting with tropical flavor. Yummy!

Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum yum!!!! The chutney was to die for. I think next time I'll make twice as much so that there's more for the sandwiches the day after the big meal

This was a good ham, not a fabulous "knock your socks off" kind of dish though. I suppose that's due, in part, to ham not being my favorite main event. The chutney was quite good though and it did add an interesting element to the ham.

I've made this several times and everyone loved it. There are never any leftovers. I use fully cooked, spiral cut ham so I shorten the cooking time by 30-45 minutes so as not to dry out the meat.

fabulous! This turned out perfectly. I made the chutney ahead of time which gave it time for the flavors to blend. Served with roasted asparagus with olive oil and shallots and wasabi mashed potatoes.

I used a FRESH ham and not a fully cooked ham. I cooked it for about 3 hours. It was delicious.

The ham turned out fine, but the chutney was not impressive.

Pat - right below the ingredients and above the instructions there is a link for the pineapple chutney

Maybe I am missing something but the title says pineapple chutney and there is no pineapple in the ingredients. ????

Had my brother-in-law make this for a luau. Also used a bone-in spiral sliced ham to save time. It was really good. Served it with the Pineapple Chutney, which came out a bit thin, but very tasty.

Can anyone tell me, how long it would take a 16 pound bone in FRESH ham, to cook. The recipe talks about a fully cooked ham.

I made this for a large family gathering just before Easter. Guests from young to old really enjoyed it. Served it with scalloped potatoes and fresh asparagus. It was a perfect spring meal.

We also made this for Easter and it was great. I used a bone-in spiral sliced ham to save a little work. Mine also browned a little too fast but that may have been an oven problem. Everyone loved the chutney

I made this ham for Easter dinner. It was absolutely wonderful, and the curried pineapple chutney was to die for. It was really delicious and added a nice twist to this wonderful meal. I will definitely make this a permanent addition to my recipe collection.

I made this for Easter dinner yesterday and my family loved it! The Pineapple Chutney is excellent, and I plan to make more of that for other uses. Mine didn't look like the picture (big surprise!); I tented it with foil when it started getting too brown.
