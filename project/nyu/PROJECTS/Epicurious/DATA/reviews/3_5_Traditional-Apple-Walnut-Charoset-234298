Took this to a friend's seder and was asked for the recipe. Everyone loved it! I followed the basic recipe, with a few tweaks, using Gala, Fugi and Granny Smith apples - hand chopped and sprinkled with juice of half a lemon. I borrowed the idea from another reviewer and added the zest of one orange. I toasted the walnuts at 275 degrees for 25 minutes before hand chopping them. Instead of sugar, I sweetened it to taste with clover honey.

I used galas and granny smiths (good for a little tartness) a combo of almonds and walnuts and no brown sugar. I added a little raw honey and the secret ingredient that brings this to a higher level: orange zest. It brightens the dish and makes it a bit more special. I'd love to eat it with yogurt as another cook suggested, but will have to make more next week since I don't have any leftovers (it was that good!)

I've tried this and found that Granny Smith apples and Golden or Raw sugar combo were more suitable for my guests. Thank you for reminding me the grand time that was had by all at the parties.

Macintosh or Braeburn/Galas - no brown sugar -- raisins!! In the food processor - amazing!!!! Keep for topping in Greek yogurt.

I made this recipe for a Seder this past weekend and it was a HUGE hit! I altered the preparation to suit my preferences, and I used all organic ingredients, which I think makes everything that much more fresh and delicious. After coursely chopping the apples, I put them in the Cuisinart to make them less choppy. I then did the same thing for the walnuts. Mixed them together with about 2/3 cup of sweet organic kosher wine. I also added a tiny bit of water to the brown sugar, which I then heated in the microwave for about 10 seconds, and then poured that mixture over the apples, etc. Something about the heated brown sugar almost carmelized the recipe. It was such a big hit at our family's Seder, and so incredibly simple. I'm sure I'll be using this recipe for years to come.

Great recipe. People asked for seconds (and thirds). I used two kinds of apples, which I think made it a little nicer and added raisins because I did not have sweet wine.

Made this last year but used port instead of the Manischewitz and it was delicious. Making it again this year for sure.

Instead of Fujis or other "modern" breeds, I much prefer the apples we had as kids -- sweet crisp McIntoshes or Janathons. With those and the really sweet Manishevitz Concord Grape wine, there's no need for any extra sweetener, though I usually end up adding a tsp of honey to bind it all...and it always tastes better at the second seder!

Made this and substituted maple syrup for brown sugar as I didn't have any in the house. Also substituted hazelnuts for walnuts as a few others suggested. Found this to be rather boring and thin tasting, added golden raisins for some depth which did the job, but not very exciting in the end.

I agree with the horseradish, but we usually "experiment" with that on the side... For the reallly adventurous (or lazy, like me, who refuse to run to the store) try these substitutions... No manishevitz wine? Use red wine+triple sec+boysenberry syrup... And by the way, add a splash of salt... and a few splashes of cayenne... and a dollop of lemon juice... and a little coconut for more nutty goodness. It's hard to make this recipe go wrong. (You see I tried, and, despite my efforts, it just tasted more delicious.)

This is a good basic recipe, but here in the South, we usually use pecans.

This is a simple and excellent recipe! I substitute raisins for the brown sugar which adds another wonderful texture as well as a natural sweetness.

Just wanted to add that this year by accident I purchased a bottle of Elderberry Passover wine along with all the Concord Grape. I used it for this recipe and it was so sweet and better than usual. I will always use this wine in the future. I add SweetnLow also for some guests or refined white sugar instead of brown sugar. Using hazelnuts sounds like a great idea to try next year. I have a friend who makes this but always adds horseradish to this mixture. I haven't tasted hers but her guests love it.

If I could give this recipe 5 forks, I would. I made it for passover tonight, exactly as written, using gala apples, except that I grated the apples in the food processor instead of dicing them. It turned out FANTASTIC. My guests even told me that I should consider making it to sell during passover for those who don't have time to cook!

I've been asked to make this for Passover 3 years in a row. It's a great, basic recipe. I also substitute hazelnuts as my husband is allergic to walnuts.

As the non-Jewish half of a fairly Jewish household, I've learned a lot + have added my own wrinkles to recipes. I vastly prefer hazelnuts in my haroset to walnuts. Family loves it!

This is very similar to my recipe and delicious. I make it every year and it is a big hit.
