I had bosc pears on hand and was happy to find this recipe to use them for a special dessert. The glaze/sauce was very flavorful and delicious but the components served all together - the ice cream, pear, glaze - presented a much too sweet flavor profile.

Made this for desert for Thanksgiving dinner. It was easy to make, tasted wonderful and the presentation gave the impression I'd worked hours instead of only about 30 min. The cinnamon added a zing to the pomegranate wine sauce that was wonderful and made the house smell very good. I made it in the morning and kept basting the pears after they were out of the oven. The sauce seemed to thicken on its own so I didn't bother reducing it just used the extra to go over the scoop of ice cream served along side the pears.

This dessert is scrumptious, especially in the fall/winter. The pears and sauce are very flavorful, so the vanilla ice cream to balance it out is quite necessary. My mom has been making it for a few years, and I was pleased to find that it's something I can easily make now that I've moved out. This is one of those desserts I'll have to make at least once every year.

An absolutely delightful recipe. Scattered fresh pomegranate on the plates for additional garnish/goodness. So simple to make, so divine to eat. I made this and brought to a lovely dinner party (just re-heated the glaze as the recipe suggests). Dinner guests were groaning with appreciation. Highly recommend!!

Not only is this a very easy dessert that impresses, it is not terribly rich (depending of course on how much ice cream you choose to add to your serving!). To my surprise, my teenage son who is NOT a rich dessert person but whose tastes don't run to elegant desserts absolutely loved this dish. He chose to have his without ice cream but was spotted more than once going back for more.

We loved this recipe! Surprisingly easy for such an elegant dessert. I had French Butter pears on hand instead of Bosc, and I substituted cranberry juice for pomegranate, and it still turned out wonderfully. The pears were easily done in an hour, and held their shape. Next time I'll try the pomegrante! Will definitely make again.

Another keeper - I have served these numerous times and always got rave reviews. The best part about them, they can be made ahead of time, just reheat the sauce at the last minute.

I made this twice. The first time I roasted as directed but had to leave in oven almost an hour and a half before finally giving up. The sauce was caramelizing and in danger of burning. The pears were tough. Since I have a seemingly endless supply of wonderful pomegranates, I prepared a second time but poached as I have done with pears many times before. The result was fabulous and took only 25 minutes.

The first time I made this the pears did not cook enough. I found that if I cut the pears in half, half the recipe and don't reduce the sauce as much I get much better results. It is not as elegant but I get compliments every time.

I made this dish three time following the recipe exactly the way it is writen and got rave reviews. The bosc pear holds it's shape well and the combination of the thicken sauce with the vanila icecream is devine. Do not forget to peel the pears, it will melt in your mouth.

I've made this twice and think it's a fabulously elegant dessert. For the second time, I increased the amount of sauce/glaze to have more to spoon over the ice cream and I roast the pears longer to ensure they're soft and tender. As a result, you don't need to really transfer the glaze to boil down. The roasting time is dependent on the size of the pears and their ripeness. Topping with crushed amaretti works brilliantly.

The pears were delicious. They turned out a bit purple instead of the nice red in the photograph. Sauce was the best with anise/almond biscotti.

The pears took a long time to soften-more than the hour called for in the recipe and should have been more tender. The glaze however was awesome over the vanilla ice cream. I would make that again for sure.

Made this several times for guests, served with vanilla Ice Cream with sauce drizzled over pear and ice cream was a great hit and got rave reviews. Boil the sauce down to 1/2 cup for more concentrated flavor.

This impressed our dinner guests and was absolutely delicious. If you can't find pomegranite juice, you can substitute a mix of orange juice and port.

A dessert with delicious flavors and an elegant presentation to complete a gourmet dinner. It can be prepared in advance but the basting takes a little time. Our company was impressed and cleaned their plates.
