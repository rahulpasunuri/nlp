I'm not from Boston or the NE. I'm from Georgia, originally. We ate the canned stuff and my mom made it from scratch. I liked both. She mixed cream cheese with drained crushed pineapple and gave it to us for lunch when we were children. This recipe here is very flexible with regard to the flours and the dried fruit. Use whatever your family prefers in both. My mom developed Celiac disease as she grew older. She still made the bread with non-gluten flours. Loved reading that someone else had figured that out! Kudos to you. This bread is the bomb!

I just bought 4 ea, 1.25 quart stainless steel "bain maries" plus covers from a local restaurant supply for $3 each. In the past, I've used coffee cans, but they're now hard to find and, since they tend to rust, I only got 1 use from them. I think the Bain Maries will work great. The stainless is non-magnetic and should be re-usable forever.

terrific recipe, I can't believe nobody has mentioned swapping out the milk for dark beer! I use guinness or newcastle nut brown.

I've tried many variations hoping to recreate my mother's brown bread. This is pretty close and good on it's own. I too found that there are few coffee cans out there that are "cans". So I used a large can of pork and beans, it's the same circumference as a coffee can just a bit taller...which doesn't seem to bother the baking/steaming process. Great with cream cheese

You can use a glass Pyrex 2L (or appropriate size) beaker, the kind the chemists use. Problem is, they are on the expensive side - about $25 with shipping online. But I did call Corning and its oven use was good to go. I double the recipe and use 1 c rye flour, 1 c corn meal, and 1 c graham flour. IT IS DELICIOUS. FIVE STARS!

I usually don't "review" items if I haven't made them, but I'm coming on here to ask a question, which perhaps a subsequent reviewer can address. First of all - I grew up in Maine, just up the road from the B&M factory in Portland, and we regularly ate B&M's canned brown bread. I'm back in Maine now, but have lived all over New England as well as in Atlantic Canada, and I've rarely had trouble finding the canned stuff. I'm surprised it was not to be found in the store in Newburyport. We had it in our local Wal-Mart in New Hampshire! I love the canned stuff, but I've been wanting to compare it to homemade (although for most of us in NE, the canned stuff is "authentic.") I have serious reservations about using a coffee can, though, as tin cans are not what they used to be. Many, maybe most cans are now lined with BPA, which can leach into the foods, but my main concern rests with cooking in such a can - I imagine there would be more of a threat there. Some other cans are aluminum and lined with a polymer - also unsafe if heated at high temps. Does anyone have a brand of coffee which has an unlined can? Is it possible to find a plain tin (or steel lined with tin) can these days?

Perfect. I changed the baking method a little. 350 @ 2hr 40 minutes. It was way eaiser that I thought it was going to be to make.

I just made this recipe and it looks wonderful but have not tasted as yet. My question is does this bread need to be refrigerated?

Needed a relatively quick bread to go with my mother-in-law's New England bean recipe (crockpot version) and came upon this great recipe. We love Jasper White, have his 50 Chowder cookbook, and decided to make this one. I didn't have a coffee can (we roast our own coffee beans) so I used a round pyrex casserole dish and a half and half mixture of corn meal and whole wheat flour. The bread came out great! Very easy and relatively quick (compared to yeast breads).

I grew up in New England in a family that ate brown bread (from a can) and baked kidney beans (not from a can) on a fairly regular basis. While car-camping with my brother in West Virginia, we decided to include this family favorite but were surprised to discover that we could not find the familiar B&M can in the local grocery store. A quick epicurious lookup on my cellphone revealed this recipe. We couldn't find rye flour, so we went with equal parts cornmeal and wheat flour. Great recipe! It totally blows the canned stuff out of the water.

I can't say enough good things about this bread! It is fat-free (if you use skim or evaporated skimmed milk), It is nutritious, It is filling, It involves almost no work-time effort, It is freeze-able....Compare that to your average store bought muffin! I try to make this once a month and triple the recipe (it seems wasteful to only do one can when you have the water steaming anyway. I use a standard casserole dish and all the regular cans I can find.) Hopefully that answers a previous poster's question with respect to can size....the "steaming" keeps the bread so moist that the cooking time's ok, even if I neglect to remove the smaller cans in a shorter cooking time. Oh, also, I give a sprinkle of pumpkin pie type spices; cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice, and sometimes orange or lemon zest to the mix. It seems to give more depth and redolence (if possible)to this fragrant bread. Serve with every thing from up-scale hotdogs and baked beans to cream cheese or lemon curd (at brunch)...place some of the sliced rounds at your work-coffee station. Happiness ensues!

For a gluten free version, I'd use a mix of a cup each of rice flour, potato flour, buckwheat flour, cornmeal, tapioca flour and 1/2 cup of xantham gum.

I've successfully doubled this recipe the last three years with no problems. Try dried cranberries when you don't have currants nearby. Works well in a dairy-free context when rice milk is substituted.

I loved this recipe. A quick look didn't show anyone stating how they enjoyed their bread. We open the bottom of the can, slide out a portion, slice using the edge of the can as a guide, lightly butter both sides of the slice and fry in a skillet until the edges are crisp. An AMAZING flavor experience.

Great recipe! I imagined myself back in Boston when I ate it! John J. Russ, where did you ever find a charlotte mold? I have looked for one everywhere with no luck.

Just as a warning to others whose thoughts are similar to my own: I tried to double this recipe, and I used two cans (one was 1 lb, 4oz. the other 1 lb, 12oz) It made a lot of batter, and I used all of it in the cans..... they both overflowed ridiculously while cooking (the batter popped right through the tinfoil!!!) It was pretty scary. So the author wasn't kidding when they said to fill only two thirds full... But I still can't see the flaw in my plan. Why was there so much batter? Why didn't two cans work as well as one? We may never know.

Excellent. And I'm from Boston. To the Cook from GA - Is your caps lock button broken? Otherwise, it's unnecessary to scream like that.

I thought this was a bit dense for a wheat bread, but it was easier than some recipes. For the cook from GA ... remember that wheat flour often has less gluten than regular flour or bread flour ... rye is even lower in gluten than most store-bought wheat flours...if you use a flour that is low in gluten, you need to mix in bread flour or clear flour to balance the gluten. (I would find a different recipe...balancing gluten takes practice and bad outcomes can be heavy like a brick.) Just my opinion.

Can you make this bread in a tin you'd have lying around the house? thanks!

This is a pretty good brown bread recipe. For the previous reviewer-- any combination of flours would work-- cornmeal, rye, buckwheat, spelt...use your imagination. King Arthur Flour is probably your best source...www.kingarthurflour.com Thier flours are unbleached, unbromated, etc, and many are organic.
