I follow the recipie save the parsley because I, like another reviewer, can't be bothered, and this was the biggest hit at Thanksgiving last year. I've made it a couple of times since, and it's gone within minutes! Defintely making it again for this Thanksgiving meal!

My entire family loved this recipe. The sauce on the cauliflower was delicious and I like that the cauliflower case still crispy. YUM

Rating: 1
It may just be me, but this did not turn out for me at all. The cauliflower did not want to slice that small for me and I felt much of the sauce that was not on the veggies burned on the baking sheet, really tainting the flavor of the whole dish. I really wanted this to be good, but i just can't recommend it.

Sooo yummy! I'm usually pretty ambivalent about cauliflower, but this side is fabulous!

This is a lovely recipe. We've made it twice. The first time, we thought there was a little too much lemon peel, so we used just 1 tsp the second time and thought that was a modest improvement. The sliced cauliflower falls apart a bit during cooking and serving, but no matter.

Rating: 4
Super easy and SO good. I happened to have purple cauliflower on hand, and it was absolutely gorgeous prepared in this way. I did not have a ton of leftover sauce. Just about the right amount, a bit leftover to put on some fish I made to go with it.

Rating: 4
Made this for 8. Doubled the amount of cauliflower and still had so much sauce that I tossed the whole thing in breadcrumbs before serving. Rave reviews from everyone. I used half butter/half olive oil (a fruity Italian - it was a great combo). Someone wiped the serving dish with bread to finish off the sauce.

Rating: 4
One small head will never be enough for 6 servings. Maybe 4 servings. I deviated from the original cooking process and put salt and sauce on for the full 25 minutes and it was great. I can maybe see using this as an omelet filling. Kind of falls apart during cutting but tastes delicious.

Made this for dinner last night and we absolutely loved it. Didn't follow the proportions as listed (don't always know how to translate the cups and oz) so ended up using 30g of butter for the juice and rind of 1 lemon and 1 heaped tbsp of mustard. We loved the lemony tang of the sauce. The cauliflower was smallish, but we gobbled it up and it was a great side for left over chicken. Forgot the parsley but will definitely add it next time: cauliflower is in season, it won't be long before we make it again.

Perfect! I'm not a huge fan of cauliflower, but I couldn't help myself from sneaking bites out of the bowl. I cooked it about 2 hours ahead and put it back into the warm oven before dinner. My 7-yr-old also ate it without a single complaint. I will make this repeatedly with our farmers market cauliflower.

abslolutely delicious as written. How can someone review a recipe if he/she uses olive oil rather than butter, leaves out the lemon rind and doesn't use parsley. Then one is NOT reviewing the recipe and no help to others.

This is absolutely delicious and so easy to make. I make it for a large dinner party...and it's great as a dish to make ahead and set aside!

This was the hands-down favorite side dish at my Thanksgiving table last year. The tangy citrus/mustard sauce is a perfect complement to roast turkey and sweeter dishes. It's a lovely golden color, too. This time I'm doubling the recipe! Hint: Make sure there's enough sauce for the size of your cauliflower, and don't skip the grated lemon peel.

Rating: 4
Every time I make this (and I've made this many times) I have a hard time eating whatever the main course is )no matter how good) because this is just so much better. Great flavor combination! I frequently omit the parsley because I can't be bothered, and no one misses it.

Rating: 4
my husband made this for dinner tonight, as a test of this recipe for thanksgiving next week. Aside from using olive oil instead of butter, he followed the recipe verbatim... it was absolutely delicious! the only problem, re: thanksgiving, is that the cauliflower lacked any color, and so just very visually attractive. Has anyone tried a quick broil at the end, or have any suggestions for us?

I'm generally not a fan of cauliflower but I really enjoyed this recipe. Roasting really changes its flavor (no sulphur taste) and I enjoyed the zing of the mustard and the "pop" of the mustard seeds. Nice side dish.

This was just okay. I love cauliflower, and I can think of plenty of other ways to eat this without so much butter!! I used half as much butter and the other 3 tbs were olive oil. It turned out okay.

I tested this recipe before bringing for the Thanksgiving crowd. Made it as written, except sliced the cauliflower closer to 1/2", and brushed on the sauce, so I didn't use it all. I used sea salt and would cut back a little next time. It was delicious. My husband and I ate every morsel. I loved the nutty/tangy flavors. Will try it next time with the tarragon or roasted garlic as others recommended.

Rating: 4
Excellent way to serve cauliflower. I made this and then used it in another recipe from this site. Penne and roasted cauliflower with breadcrumbs (November 2010). Awesome combination. Never would have thought that mustard, cauliflower and pasta would make a tasty combination. I love lemon so I added more juice and zest. Also the panko breadcrumbs on the cauliflower were superb. Make 2-3 heads as you will be nibbling on it before you serve it.

Rating: 4
Easy to make and versatile. I make this all the time now. Sauce is equally good on roasted brussels sprouts. With brussels sprouts, try replacing some or all of the butter with bacon fat. As other reviewers have said, this is way too much sauce for a single head of cauliflower. Halving does fine.

Rating: 3
Delicious and easy. It'll definitely make some regular appearances on my table.

Rating: 2
I thought the sauce was a little un-complex - just tangy. The taste was ok, but it over-powered the natural nutty/sweet flavor of roasted cauliflower. Like others, I reduced the butter to 3 tablespoons and that was plenty. To make this more of a main-course, I roasted a few potatoes and onions and tossed them into the cauliflower mix at the end (the amount of sauce was still sufficient). Adding the roasted potatoes at least added more interest and some sweetness to balance the tang.

Rating: 3
For Thanksgiving Dinner I had to bring two vegetable side dishes. I made this and "Roasted Beets and Carrots" also from this site. Everyone liked both dishes. I followed the advice from other reviewers and reduced the amount of butter to 2 tbsp and mustard to 1 tbsp. I would probably increase the amount of butter to 3 tbsp next time but I could not imagine this dish with more then that. That is the only reason I did not give this recipe 4 forks.

So easy...so tasty. As PacRimPam and others suggested, I cut back on the mustard-lemon butter. It added just the needed zip to the roasted cauliflower without overpowering it. Perfect.

This was quite good, but if you reduce the butter to 2 tbs, I suggest you also reduce the lemon to 1 tb and the dijon to 2 teaspoons and add more as needed. Otherwise, the mustard dominated. Thomas Keller has a dynamite cauliflower recipe in Bouchon you will like if you like this one.

Yummy. I kind of just used what I had so replaced deli mustard with the dijon and it was without parlsey. Would use less butter next time. . . Had it for lunch over curried rice!

Delicious change from steamed or plain roasted cauliflower. Per other reviews, I reduced the butter to 2 Tablespoons and added a little extra lemon juice. I tossed in a little broccoli for color - but it cooked slightly faster than the cauliflower so I would roast them separately.

Rating: 4
Great recipe, but I feel it calls for waaaaay too much butter. I used 2Tbs, and a bit more lemon juice, some freshly ground pepper and it was great. Even supplementing with a little olive oil instead of all the butter would be okay if you're looking for something a little "saucier." Hot, cold, or room temp -- it's delicious!

I've never before commented on recipes on this site, and have been cooking off of them happily since about 2000. This one just blew us a way -- who likes cauliflower that much??? But it is heavenly. I toasted the cauliflower until it was browned, and I couldn't stop eating it.

What a surprise! I don't even really care for the stuff, but the local farm stand had some purple cauliflower and I HAD to buy it. Then I didn't know what to to with it! I only used 2 tbsp of butter and it was rich and tasty and delicious. Forget about the 1/4 inch slices, I just left it in florets and cut the larger ones into thirds. Garnished with cilantro (no parsley around!) and LOVED it! Huge hit!

absolutely divine as is, but I'd make a few changes next time. the kosher salt gave a nice crunchy crust, but the overall result was a tad salty for me (admittedly I'm not a huge salt fan). I used 3T butter and 3T olive oil, which was terrific. definitely double the recipe if serving more than two -- my husband and I devoured it all. we both adored it, but between the salt and all the fat/calories of the sauce, this will be more of an occasional treat rather than a staple in our house.

Rating: 3
This was very good and super easy. I like roasted cauliflower and this is a delicious new version. I cooked two heads, but only increased the ingredients for the sauce by half. I forgot to sprinkle with salt before roasting, probably would have given it a more crisp, crusty texture. Mine looked just like the picture.

This was okay....it tasted good, but didn't have the wow most certainly in presentation that you want...so if you can get past that the flavour was good, and a nice alternative to traditional cauliflower preparation. It was very easy.

This was a somewhat frustrating experience. First of all, do you know how difficult it is to cut cauliflower into 1/4 inch slices? It begins to fall apart! Then, I am not sure I made sufficient sauce, because it didn't cover all the cauliflower. (Next time I think I would toss the cauliflower with the sauce.) When it all was finished, it looked like little burnt pieces of cauliflower -- nothing at all like the picture. And guess what? It was delicious! We devoured it. (By the way, hate the redesigned epicurious website.)

Rating: 4
This is so simple, yet tastes so good. I made it once with dried tarragon instead of parsley, and my boyfriend at the time said it the best vegetable dish he'd ever had. I believe I also put some extra lemon zest in it, and substituted some of the butter with margarine, since that's what I had. I highly recommend trying it with tarragon!

Like others, I winced at the idea of pouring 600 calories worth of butter over a nice healthy head of cauliflower. I went with 1.5 tbsps of butter, and 1.5 tbsps of olive oil, but did not reduce the lemon juice or mustard. This was a mistake on my part: the acid and spice of the mustard and lemon could have really used the mellowing of the butter. If I made this again, I'd make the sauce as written and pour it over two heads of cauliflower, or something with those proportions. (Oh, and the recipe as written is not enough for 6, more like 3-4.)

Rating: 4
This was deeelicious! What a great flavor. it was nice and crunchy and the sauce was so refreshing tasting. My husband practically finished off the whole head of cauliflower and all i got was one measly serving! I have no revisions at all-just make as is-YUM

Rating: 4
We used a premium large head and it was barely enough for four. The combo of lemon, mustard, and butter turns into a different taste that is superb, i.e., you really don't taste the individual flavors. I used ALL the butter ;-) and it didn't seem too much but I would try other's suggestion to reduce or replace part with olive oil. I think this is one of those dishes that will make cauliflower lovers out of haters! (Also, it doesn't really take that much longer to prepare than steaming or other methods and it's hands-free while you prepare the rest of the meal.)

This was so easy to make and tasted so good! In an effort to incorporate more vegetables in my diet, I looked for new recipes. This is a keeper.

This turned out just delicious. My husband cut half the cauliflower in 1/4 inch slices as suggested in the recipe, and did the other half in florettes to see if it worked that way too, since that's the texture he preferes. The florettes turned out just as well as the slices. I especially like the slightly overdone bits that were dark brown! Yum...

I just loved this recipe. I have made it several times. I have cut back on the butter(4 tbsp) and 1/2 tsp salt. I used country dijon mustard since I never found anything that said whole grain. The recipe is also fine with just plain dijon. Make two heads as it goes fast. An entire head serves two easily. Stays well in refrigerator for several days if you don't eat it first.

I've made this at least once a week since I first tried it for Thanksgiving Dinner. This was a hit even with family members who claim not to like cauliflower.

It's quite good warm or at room temperature.

This dish is a keeper! I cut the 6 TBSP butter down to one TBSP butter and one TBSP olive oil, cut the lemon juice to one TBSP and substitute fresh dill for the parsley. If there are any leftovers, I add them cool or room temp into fresh salads and warmed into plain couscous to jazz it up a bit.

My husband and I love cauliflower and I am always looking for something new to do with it. I made this one yesterday. I made 1 1/2 heads of cauliflower and between us we ate it all for dinner. I really did like the tang the mustard and lemon added. I also used Meyer lemons and I think maybe they aren't as acidic. I used soy butter instead of regular butter to make it a bit healthier and since it was our main course I shaved a little Pecorino Romano over the top. I think the suggestion one reviewer made of serving this as a cold salad sounds like a very good idea. I think I will try that in the summer.

Slicing the cauliflower in this way lets all that flavor from the butter sauce touch the most surface area of the veggie and gives it maximum flavor. My boyfriend and I ate the whole recipe.

Finally, a wonderful new way to prepare cauliflower.Put it together at the last minute when I was an overnight house guest and our hosts happened to have all the ingredients. A very large cauliflower was not enough for the 6 of us. All wanted more and also thought it would be a good appetizer course. Cut it a little thicker than suggested and used Meyer lemon.

Fabulous. This will go onto the regular rota for dinner parties - guests were very impressed that cauli could taste so good. Would be interesting to see how it also fares cold as a salad at a bbq. At first i was dubious about the amount of lemon zest, not being a real fan, however I would not compromise on this - it really gives it the extra kick. I am going to try it again using regular florets, rather than slicing, due to the messy appearance when the cauli broke up. Deserves to be seasoned well.

This was a good and easy recipe-though I'm not sure I liked it a whole lot better than plain, slow roasted cauliflower with olive oil and garlic.

Awesome recipe! Made quickly and easily. Lemon is too tart for my boyfriend so I omitted, still excellent!

I also tried this recipe early to determine if it would be worth making for Thanksgiving, and like the other reader thought the lemon was too over-powering. I will make it again, however, either cut back on the lemon or leave it out completely.

Tried this recipe early to determine if it would be worth taking to Thanksgiving. We thought the lemon was too much so made it a second time without the lemon. Much much better and we will be having it Thanksgiving Day and many times thereafter.

This is a fabulous recipe. Simple and very yummy. I wanted to test it before Thanksgiving. It was very easy and even though it was suppose to be for 6 servings three of us devoured it.I followed the recipe to a "T" and have already made it twice and passed it on to friends. A real keeper.
