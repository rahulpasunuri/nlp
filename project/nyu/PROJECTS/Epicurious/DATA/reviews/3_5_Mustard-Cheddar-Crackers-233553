Everybody I served these crackers to really enjoyed. They have a strong distinct taste. Does anyone have anything you would to suggest to serve them with or just serve by themselves?

I make a similar recipe with chopped pecans which people love; but my "eating audience" now prefers these.

These crackers are absolutely delicious, and our guests constantly rave about them. Wonderful bite to them. A perfect cocktail nibble. Great!

This was tasty, but my friends had very mixed reactions. I didn't think it was amazing, but a few of my guests did. It's relatively easy, stores well, and a good way to use a lot of extra cheese.

The "1/4 tsp Dijon mustard" is clearly a mistake. The original 1998 recipe called for 1/4 cup, which seems more likely (though reviews of that one complained that it was too mustardy). I used extra-sharp cheddar and they were very cheese-y, quite yummy. I used barley flour so they would be very delicate--actually too delicate, they tended toward crumbly rather than crisp. Next time I'll try barley flour and a whole egg.
