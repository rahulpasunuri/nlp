I face being drawn and quartered by the ginger-junkies if I turn up at Thanksgiving dinner without this cake! Best gingerbread cake ever! I made my own Autumn Trifle using this cake layered with Pumpkin Mousse and Maple sauteed pears. BIG hit!

This was the most wonderful moist gingerbread that I have ever made. I followed the recipe exactly. I was also pleased that it stored well in the refrigerator. It is great topped with warmed Trader Joes Lemon Curd.

A very heavy cake. Flavor too light.

Interesting. Not loved at my dinner party. It was very heavy. Fun to make once, but not again.

Without a doubt the best gingerbread I've ever made OR had - and I'm a fan! I particularly like adding some brandy to the cream as I'm whipping it, and the compote does indeed taste delicious on its own - try it over fine-quality vanilla ice-cream with a bittersweet chocolate-kahlua type sauce atop... Perfect for the holidays!

Wonderful gingerbread cake recipe and even more wonderful compote! Made this recently for a Fall progressive dinner and it was a huge hit....followed by Stilton and Port, it makes a perfect Autumn meal finale!

I made this for a New Year's Brunch and thought it was the best gingerbread I'd had. The fruit compote is so good it can stand on its own.

The cake was great, very moist and although it had a strong spice and ginger smell was actually quite mild. The compote really made it though. It needed something besides the whipped cream to jazz it up. I didn't have any brandy and it was sunday so I used some apple cider instead and it turned out great anyway.

For those looking for an excellent gingerbread recipe, this is it. The addition of the dried fruit compote makes for a truly superb dessert. Don't be affraid to add several differnt types of dried fruits.
