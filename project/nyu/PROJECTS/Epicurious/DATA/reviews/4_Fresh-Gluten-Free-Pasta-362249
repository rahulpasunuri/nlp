I used this recipe today to make ravioli, and it was fantastic! We were only cooking for two, but it was so good that we ate it all. I had a hard time finding guar gum so substituted an extra tsp of xantham gum.

Question: Has anyone made this pasta and dried it for later use instead of immediately cooking it? Any input would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you for sharing this! I've made gluten-free pasta with a GF AP flour blend and it was disappointing. This is the real thing!

This is the BEST Gluten Free pasta recipe I have tried! It is so fantastic that it is fast and easy to prepare too! I will be making this again.

My husband was just diagnosed with celiac. As an avid cook and huge Italian lover it was ME who was in mourning! I followed the recipe to the tee and it turned out perfectly! I even invited our other friends who are celiac and made it again the next night!I am so grateful for this recipe! Thanks Gluten-Free Girl and Chef!

I made this recipe a while ago when Shauna asked her readers to make some of her recipes We loved the way this pasta turned out. It's perfect. Just be gentle though when you are rolling it out (don't crank like fiend) and you can get it nice and thin.
