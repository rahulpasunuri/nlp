Made this last night with only 1 T of sugar, 1 1/2 cups of cheddar and double the amount of chipotles. Cooked it in a 8 x 8 glass pan about 30 min. Family really liked it! Color was an orangish- red from the chipotles and it complemented our vegy turkey chili beautifully!

This is really yummy!!! I didn't add the cheese and it was great without it. I also made it in 6 large muffin cups and modified the cooking time to approximately 20 minutes...they came out great!!! Very moist!! This is a very easy recipe and it doesn't take long at all. I'll be making this more often.

I made this yesterday to go with vegetarian chili and managed to forget the cheese -- but it was so good, I'm not sure I'd bother with the cheese (plus it was less fattening). Didn't have chipotles, which I love and will use next time, but did add a jalapeno I had pickled. Just enough heat to make the leftovers delicious toasted, but not so hot that it didn't work with the chili.

This is a great cornbread recipe. It's very moist, has a great texture and the loaf was easy to slice. I only added 1 diced chipotle, so the heat was subtle.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it was super simple to make and had great results. Very moist with the right amount of smoky heat.

This recipe is awesome! Excellent balance of sweet, piquant heat and lightness. Make sure buttermilk and eggs are close to room temp so as not to coagulate the melted butter. Perfect foil for a decent chili entree.

I made this with what I had in the house--substituting whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, cottage cheese, and soymilk for the buttermilk. Unfortunately I didn't have any chipotles. I made it as muffins and it was almost too much batter for a dozen standard-sized. They were wonderfully moist and tender but a bit too buttery for my taste. (Maybe the tang of buttermilk would balance the butter?) Addictive even without the chipotles.

I made 4 different flavors of corn muffins to take to a chili party. This one was unique and outstanding in the savory category. I did not have buttermilk or jack cheese on hand. I used sour cream, thinned with some pureed corn and substituted shredded sharp cheddar. At 375 the mini muffins took about 14 min. to cook. They did rise a bit more than my other recipes, so don't fill the cups quite as full. When I tried the first one, I knew this recipe would be a keeper. Just the right amount of heat combined with the smoky overtone. The texture was lighter than other recipes, not dense like some corn bread recipes can be. Excellent!

I love this recipe and make it often with the Turkey Chipotle Chili. Since there are already chipotles in the chili, I usually use fresh jalepenos in the cornbread. As well, I use extra old cheddar, as it has more flavour than the Monterey Jack.

A great recipie. Chipotle adds wonderful aroma, and flavour and the buttermilk and cheese add dimension. I used white chedder cheese for more flavour and reduced fat buttermilk for fewer calories.

very yummy. Everyone loved it. I accidentally forgot to add the butter-- left it in the microwave and found it the next day!-- but it was great anyway.

I am a huge chipotle freak, so this recipe was a natural. I did not find it overly moist -- perhaps I should have cooked it a little less? I even had buttermilk on hand, so that should have helped. Does anyone have suggestions for mincing chipotles quickly? It took me a good 10-15 minutes just to mince the chipotle, including scraping out all of the seeds.

This recipe was very good. I made the corn bread in a cast iron skillet, it cut down the cooking time to 20 min.

This was great, and really easy. I used pepper jack cheese and polenta for the cornmeal (for a more grainy texture). The second time I made it I doubled the chipotles - That bread had some heat! Next time I'll use 1 1/2 times the amount called for. BTW - tripling the recipe will make a 1/2 sheet pan.

I've had alot of corn bread in my life and this one made me swoon!!!! Aye Caramba! Moist, dense, spicy. I used Manchego cheese because that's what I had on hand - similar to Mont Jack. Also used stone ground corn meal (Lamb's brand) because I like the texture alot better. Can't wait to eat the leftovers toasted with a little butter. YUM!

One of the best cornbreads I have ever had. Moist! A must!

Rating: 3
I don't like sweet cornbreads so I added just a table spoon of sugar. 1 C. of cottage cheese instead of monterey jack, 2 eggs instead of 3 and 1 cup of frozen corn that I thawed. With a generous sprinkling of sesame seeds on top. I belive I now have the perfect cornbread. Spicey, moist, not sweet and not a cake.

Great! I made this to serve with a chipotle beef chili, and it was a heavenly combination. On its own, however, I think the cornbread needs a little more heat--maybe double the amount of chipotle peppers. Wonderful texture and easy to make.

I made this bread to take along to dinner at a friend's house. He has a wheat allergy, so I used spelt flour and stoneground cornmeal... The bread is delicious, and it was a HUGE hit. The bread held together well, and the smoky flavor from the chiles was a really nice touch. I think that next time I'll use a mixture of jack and sharp cheddar for a counterpoint flavor, since the jack cheese tends to fade into the background by itself.

Substituted feta for Monterey Jack cheese, and 1% milk for buttermilk, since that's what I had. Still quite tasty. Great smoky heat from the chipotle peppers. Good with chili.

I have made this countless times. It is a tasty twist for the cornbread lover. Just the right amount of heat. Serve it with butter and honey!

Nice and moist with a subtle, smoky heat. Couldn't taste the cheese, but I think that helped keep it creamy. Some corn breads are dry and crumbly, but not this one!

Delicious with just a hint of heat. Add more chipotle if you like it hot.

As I am from the South, I have tried MANY cornbread recipes. This one is my all-time favorite. Although the fat content is a bit high, this cornbread is moist and so delicious. I found it so easy to prepare and not time-consuming as another reviewer wrote. It goes great with chili. I do prefer using cheddar over Monterey Jack.

I think this is pretty good and would probably make it again. I like the smokey spiciness the chipotle chile offers.

Reading the other reviews, I had to double-check to just to make sure we'd all made the same recipe! Contrary to many others, I thought this was just great, and I'd can't figure out how the MA cook decided it was too time consuming.. (You'd have to microwave frozen dinners to find anything much quicker to prepare..) I whipped up the recipe in less than ten minutes, which included shredding the cheese, and I didn't bother to let it cool completely as suggested. It was wonderful warm, with just the perfect amount of heat from the chipotles and a very nice texture - moist and tender. I do agree with the reviewer who stated that the cheese flavor was not noticable - I couldn't detect it either, but it certainly contibuted to the nice texture. Overall, a very nice cornbread that I will definitely make again.

This recipe is too time consuming & too high in fat for the overall results. It's a tasty corn bread, I just know I can do a lot better with less bother.

Turned out great, not too hot might try a wee bit more chipotle chilies. I open a can and put them in a sealed plastic container and they last for months in the refrigerator. Might try cheddar cheese next time to "kick it up a notch"

I used this recipe for a pot luck - everyone enjoyed the flavor. It wasn't as moist as I would like and I'm wondering if the temperature should be lower. I plan to make it again this weekend. I did use the hot/spicy cheese. What do you think about omiting the cheese and adding cream corn?

This wasn't terrible but it also just didn't stand up to the promise for me. The bread was dense even for cornbread, bordering on dry. I didn't get any of the chipotle flavor coming through, although the red flecks they create in the bread are an appetizing touch. Even the cheese failed to stand out, which is especially disappointing given how many extra calories chesse adds to a dish.

Overall, we thought it was kind of tasteless--there was not much cornbread flavor.

This was great! The cheese makes it very moist and the chipotles make it smoky and hot. I want to serve it next time I make chili. I think it would also make great mini muffins.

This is my new favorite corn bread recipe! It is very moist and the chipoltes give it a great kick. I will be making this again soon, and maybe next time I won't have the oven accidently set 100 degrees hotter than recommended.
