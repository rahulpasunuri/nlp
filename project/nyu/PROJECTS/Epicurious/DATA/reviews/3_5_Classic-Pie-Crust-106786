I tried out this crust with my plum strawberry pie. I found it exceedingly difficult to roll out and it kept falling apart. The flavor and texture after it was cooked was very good though and got many compliments. I did replace one tablespoon of ice water with a tablespoon of vanilla extract. This crust looked nice after baking and tasted quite good with the plum and strawberry. I would recommend adding a little more water to make it more cohesive though.
