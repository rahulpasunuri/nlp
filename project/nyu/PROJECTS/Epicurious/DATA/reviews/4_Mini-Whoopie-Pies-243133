Wicked Whisk- look up Moon Pies on Amazon....they are exactly as the previous viewer mentioned. They are all over the place in the South, usually individually wrapped.

I have lived in the deep south my whole life. A Moon Pie is two small chocolate cakes with marshmallow frosting sandwiched in between. I have never heard of a graham cracker version. Although, I have heard of Moon Pies made with vanilla ice cream instead of frosting (yum!)

Moon Pies are a southern treat made from graham cracker and marshmallow covered in frosting. These are whoopie pies. Two different items. Let's try not to get people confused. Us southerners take our snack food very seriously. ;0)

A bit more labor intensive than some other cookies, but what a fabulous result. I used a 100 scoop and think the recipe should read a tbsp of cake batter instead of a generous tsp. We ended up with 41 cookies using the scoop. Next time we'll just pipe out the batter for even faster baking. Might add more cocoa powder next time for a bigger hit of chocolate. I think the chocolate flavor competes with the whole wheat flour (we used whole wheat pastry) a bit too much. Perfect size for adults and kids. Thanks!

These were great. Used pastry bags and piped both the cake and the filling. Definitely made it easier with the filling, and helped to keep the cakes uniform shape and size (though that would've been easier with a larger nib). Sent them in for my second-grader's birthday treat and they seemed to go over really well in her class.

These are popular lunch box treats in my house. After a first try that resulted in oozing frosting, I now use a 7 oz jar of fluff, 1 stick of butter, 1/2 tsp vanilla, start with 2 cups powdered sugar and add more until it is stiff enough. Sure, it's sweet, but since the cookies aren't too sweet it's not bad!

I just made these. They were very easy to make and delicious! I used all White Whole Wheat flour from Trader Joe's and it gave them a nice texture. My batch didn't come out quite as large as the recipe states, so I'll probaby make another batch.

I don't think this recipe belongs in the 'Healthy lunch' recipes. Afterall anything that contains marshmellow cream adn is 146 calories per mini cake is not what I would label healthy.

As a native of PA Dutch country, I implore you to not waste your time or energy on this sub par frosting. Seriously, if you are going to the effort to make Whoopie (the correct spelling) Pies, do it right!

Thought these were delicious and cute-- I substituted soy milk for regular (although i kept the butter and eggs as-is) and they turned out wonderful. My only issue was with the shape-- using a spoon to drop the batter onto the baking sheet resulted in oddly-shaped cookies. i also found the filling very challenging to work with. In the future, I think I would use a pastry bag to pipe the cake batter onto a cookie sheet for uniformity, and then a separate pastry bag for the filling. All in all, a great recipe.

Easy and yummy, I left out the butter (frosting) and added 1 T of milk and 2 T of ground flaxseed. I also used more than half whole wheat flour.

These were a big hit in my family. I made them regular size (approximately two tablespoons batter per cookie) rather than mini and the recipe made about 14 pies. I did notice an error in the recipe. In step 3 it says to add the egg and milk. Later it says to add the flour mixture in two batches alternating with the milk. I think the milk should not be added with egg and added later alternating with the flour. Also, I would suggest wrapping the pies individually with wax paper. They are very sticky!

I made this recipe because my son begged me for these "moon" pies after a visit to a great bakery here in SF that served them. This recipe is pretty easy to make, although I have to warn you that working with marshmallow cream is sticky at best, and mixed with powdered sugar, dusty and sticky! However, it's good recipe that tastes every bit as good as those bakery and fine grocery store versions. Since those places sell these cookies at $2.50 a pop, why not make this for yourself. This recipe can be halved, because 36 is a lot of cookies. This would be a great recipe for a class birthday or other holiday party.
