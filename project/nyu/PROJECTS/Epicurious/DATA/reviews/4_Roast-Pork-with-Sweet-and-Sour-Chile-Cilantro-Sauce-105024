Wonderful recipe, very yummy, looks lovely and is easy. Especially loved the flavor/crispness of bread crumb crust. Used panko for bread crumbs. Used 2 pork tenderloins (unstuffed, had enough bread crumbs left over to cover a third). Following another's suggestion, roasted at 425 degrees for aprox 30 min (internal temp 155 degrees). Crumbs were browning quickly, so tented loosely with foil after aprox 10 minutes. Also following other suggestions, made sauce using 1/2 C honey. Used immersion blender after cooking, & stirred in cilantro before serving.

Didn't think the sauce was very good but loved the breadcrumb coating and will use it again.

We really really liked this recipe. I couldn't find whole coriander seeds, so I used ground. I guessed and used about two tablespoons ground, but will add a little more next time as it adds a nice depth to the sweet/spice. Also had trouble finding caribe, but used about 1/2 cup NM red chilies seeded and chopped. It was pretty firey, so I may use less next time. The dish is gorgeous and would definitely make for guests, as long as they like spicey.

The sauce was tangy, earthy, sweet and spicy - a perfect pairing with the pork (or anything else you put it on!). I used fresh jalapenos, and pureed the sauce - it added beautiful jewel tones to the plate. Note: not all honey is the same! Taste yours before adding it to the pot, and adjust your cooking time accordingly. Since we had chops I skipped the crumb coating and just rubbed the chops with the ground coriander and baked them.

I'm not sure what went wrong here, but the bread crumbs seemed a total waste on the outside. They kept falling off and never really crisped. Are you supposed to remove the fat/skin layer first? But the sauce was fantastic, much better than I had hoped. I didn't have caribe but used mild flakes you'd put on pizzas, and added one chipotle as someone above suggested, then blitzed the sauce before putting the cilantro in. All in all, I'd make the sauce again, but don't see the point of all the work on the roast.

Huge disappointment. The pork itself was on the bland side, and the sauce was treacly to the point of being inedible. A full cup of honey is far too much -- the spicy elements don't stand a chance against all that sweetness. This one gets a giant "DO NOT WANT" note in my Gourmet cookbook.

Too sweet! I would use half the honey. Tried substituting jalapenos and Anaheim chilis, was not nearly spicy enough. I would say overall that it is promising, though.

I loved this recipe! I could not find caribe, but found dried new mexico red chiles and ground them in my food processor - they were wonderful and the sauce is such a beautiful color! I did not have kitchen string, so I "tied" the opening together with toothpicks - worked fine. I think this would be great to stuff pork chops or chicken breasts...

The sause is so amazing and the pork turned out well too. It makes your litchen smell divine but what I love most is that it's seasonless. I made it with pototoes and root veggies but it would easily work with grilled summer squash. I did have some difficulty finding the New Mexico chili, though I eventually found it at Mother's Market.

Great, simple recipe. Pulled out 5 lb. pork loin, had dried chipotle chiles on hand, so substituted for the caribe. Sauce was great - son who refuses all sauces added sauce three times. Extras went to a neighbor who passes us her extras as well. Very filling!!

This is a family favorite. I use a combination of dried cascabel, ancho, and guajilla chilies seeded and ground in a food processor. I usually grind a large amount of the chilies and save themin an airtight container for future use. I have also substitued Salmon for the Pork with execellent results.

Wonderful, but I'd caution against using red pepper flakes as a substitute for NM caribe chili peppers...the latter are not spicy and red pepper flakes are quite hot. Totally different taste.

Rating: 4
Wow - super easy and amazingly delicious. I would be careful with the cooking time once you turn down the temp. In my oven, a three pound roast was done after an additional 45 minutes. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a "t" and it was delicious.

I was a little nervous about this recipe because I haven't cooked pork much, but it was great. It's a forgiving recipe as far as substitutions and quantities go (i.e. roasted red pepper from a jar instead of fresh red bell pepper, red pepper flakes instead of caribe). Try it!

I made this for a simple dinner party and give it 4 forks because it was so easy to make, and simply scrumptious. I live on an island and speciality stores are hard to come by so I used regular red chilli flakes but only about two tablespoons which added great spice and "Kick" without burning your mouth. This is a definite keeper.

Made this recipe with a 1.4 pound pork tenderloin cooking at 425 for 40 minutes and resting uncovered for 10. For the sauce I bought whole New Mexican Chilies at a local market ($1.29 for enough chilies to make double recipe if you wanted), took off the stems and ground up the chilies with the seeds in a spice grinder. There is no need to go through the trouble and expense of ordering "caribe". This worked well and the sauce was delicious. I might have reduced it too much as it became almost jellied. No matter, the smokey taste of the chilies shined through. The sauce, at least, goes into the permanent collection.

Made this recipe on Saturday night with a 4.25 lb roast and it was fantastic! I got whole, dry New Mexico red chiles at a Mexican market and ground them in a spice mill after taking out the seeds.

Excellent. Couldn't or perhaps too lazy to look for caribe, so made this with regular chile peppers. Extremely tasty, will definitely make again.

Great sauce - just wanted to add that you can make your own caribe sauce easily - lots of recipe's on the web - make sure to use New Mexico chilies because the skins dissolve when you puree them to make the sauce.

Sauce is amazing! Had to track down caribe at our local Mexican grocery but it was worth it. Would be great on chicken too.

Definite keeper. Used a pork tenderloin, coated with crushed coriander, salt and pepper, browned in a skillet then 30 mins in the oven at 425 F. Local supermarkets in Southern California carry 'Mojave Foods' dried hot New Mexico chile peppers - worked well in sauce, which was delicious. The chipotle apples mentioned by earlier reviewer complement the recipe nicely. Served with couscous. Easy, tasty dinner.

This was AMAZING!!!! I tried it out when some family & friends came to town and everyone loved it. Since it was my first time trying it, I decided not to order the caribe, but used crushed red pepper instead since it looked the same. I'm guessing that the flavor is different though because it turned out really spicy. Next time I make it I will either go ahead and order the caribe, or put about half the amount of red pepper in. Still, though our mouths were on fire, we couldn't quit eating because it tasted so good. I will DEFINTELY make this again. Beautiful presentation as well.

This dish, especially the sauce, will make you famous. This is the one everyone will ask you to bring to the party. We all loved it and it wasn't to spicy. No one could guess the ingrediants, and real surprise.

This was EXCELLENT! The meat was extremely tender. We used two 2 lb pork loins instead of one big 3 lb. The sauce was perfect and not too spicey.

This was pretty bad. I had no New Mexico chili so I used ancho and this may have been the problem. The sauce was bitter. I did puree the sauce because it was otherwise disgusting looking.

This has become my favorite recipe for company. It also works great with boneless skinless chicken breasts, as individual roll-ups, using kitchen twine.

We first made this recipe for a group of friends on an annual trip back to Wyoming. It was a huge hit and each year our friends anxiously await a repeat performance. We grill it over mountain mahogony (indirect fire). Apple or mesquite would also be a great substitute. Delicious!

The sauce is what makes this recipe sing. I pureed the finished sauce (minus the cilantro) and then passed it through a sieve. To my taste, this made the sauce taste much more cohesive and refined than the more rustic preparation described in the recipe. Try it with grilled pork chops or chicken breast.

YUM! This recipe is so easy (except for having to mail order the caribe - but it was worth it!) I served it for a nuevo latino dinner party and everybody raved! The sauce is so tasty and adds beautiful color. My husband liked it so much, and since we had so much of the sauce left over and the pork was so easy to make, I made it again the next day. It went really well with this site's Mexican Corn Risotto and simple roasted asparagus. Impressive and easy!

My mother and I made this recipe the same night (different towns) and was a complete hit at both parties. I am making this for a family Christmas dish and may now be one of my staple entertaining dishes. I am some what of a novise cook so it was a lot of work for me but very well worth it!!

I hardly ever give 4 forks but this was such a great recipe it deserves them. I wasn't sure when I chose this recipe that I would like it. The corriander with pork was really different but the sauce really made it. I had a little trouble with the sauce. I used other spicey dried chilis and chopped them up in the processor. The pieces remaind big and the sauce was thick. I ended up straining it and adding roasted red peppers afterward and some more lime juice. The sauce was awesome ! loved the sweet / tart / hot flavor of it.

yuuuummmyyy! my guests loved this! next time i'll cut some of the bread crumbs and add some cornstarch to the sauce--it was pretty runny and didn't make for a great presentation. next, i paired this with the chipotle glazed apples and it was AMAZING!

Fantastic! Most pork receipes call for 6 + hours to marinate. I didn't have the time for that. This was easy and the presentation was beautiful. I used ground coriander. I used dried whole caribe chilies and put them in a processor to crush. The flavor of the sauce was incredible. Can't wait to make it again.

This is GREAT company fare! I changed the sauce up a bit by adding a jar of roasted red peppers in addition to the chopped red pepper and then whacked it all to a smooth consistency! The sauce is a must have! Served with oven roasted new potatoes and fresh green beans sauteed with bacon and Vidallia onions. The meal made for a special Fathers Day Dinner.

I didn't have all the correct ingredients, but I thought, and everyone at the dinner table thought the sauce was excellent, will use again for grilled shrimp or chicken!

Well, first I should confess that I used ground coriander and seasoned croutons. I also smashed some garlic cloves and rolled them inside the pork. Also, I forgot to turn down the oven and it was actually done sooner and not dry at all. The pork had amazing flavor, brought out nicely by the breadcrumbs. I put carrots and jalapenos in the roasting pan under the pork. The chile-cilantro sauce is tasty but can overpower the flavor of the pork if you put too much over it.

I absolutely could not stomach the bread-coating; it tasted like coriander-spiced sand. Rather than bread crumbs, I would sear the pork in a skillet on a high-flame, coated with the coriander, then transfer to the oven. The sauce was a delight!

I didn't have time to send away for the caribe chile. I picked up some whole Nex Mexico chile pods and pull off the top stem, cut into small pieces then put in the food processor until they were flakes. When I taste tested the sauce I was worried because it was so spicey and I warned my guest to go light, but after tasting with the pork everyone asked for more sauce. The pork really tempers the heat and the combination of the sauce, pork and very fragrent stuffing really all work great together. Three of my guest asked for the recipe.

The sauce definitly made the dish, allthough the breadcrumb mixture rolled up in the pork loin was a nice addition as well. Did not have the right chiles so I also used chipotles ( in a can ). I also put the sauce in the blender at the end so that it was nice and smooth.Very delicious and easy.

I work in corporate food service and made this recipe for the employees. I didn't butterfly the pork and omitted the breadcrumbs, but used the remaining ingredients to season the pork. The it used chipotles instead which gave it a nice smokiness & heat. The sauce has alot of zing to it but I think it needs to be thickened.

Outstanding! Made it for a Cinquo de Mayo dinner we had. The sauce with this recipe is fabulous and the pork with the coriander/olive oil filling came out very moist. It was a HUGE hit, even with my non-pork liking husband. I would crush the coriander seeds to a medium grind rather than course. I couldn't find the caribe so used whole New Mexico chile pods that I chopped myself. I only used 1/2 the amount of the chile and it was quite spicy but excellent. The sauce would be fabulous over salmon or chicken on the grill. Really, an awesome recipe.
