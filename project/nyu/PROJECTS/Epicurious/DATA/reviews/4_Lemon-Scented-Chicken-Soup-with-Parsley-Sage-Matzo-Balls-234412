I thought this recipe was a little bland. I usually make my mother's chicken soup, which is hearty and delicious, but this was kind of...meh...

i have made this several times... i always like to follow a recipe exactly the 1st time and then make any individual changes... (1)i now use skin on bone in chicken breasts...as it is easier than a whole chicken...and my family prefers white meat. (2)i only discard some of the veggies. we like the sweet potato, carrots(i also use the tops in the broth), etc mixed in. so when i take them out, i pull the veggies that we like and chop them up and then use them as "condiments"...a la thai food...so folks can add in what they like best. (3)speaking of veggies...i always err on the side of more. this time i added a rutabaga as well. (4)my only recommendation would be to budget enough time to do this recipe. the 1st time it took longer than i thought it would...but it was definitely worth the wait!

Thought the matzo balls were really good, but I wish the broth had more flavor given how time consuming it was. It had good vegetable flavor (the yam really sweetened it up) but wish it was more "chickeny". That said, it was good comfort food, and I'll probably make it again.

This is a great recipe. Everyone at our 15 person seder loved it. The lemon is a nice touch and makes it different from the standard soup you get from the deli.

Maybe I did something wrong. It's a pretty simple recipe and I'm a pretty good cook, but it's the only explanation I can find because I followed the recipe exactly and wound up with very bland soup. After allowing it to simmer and reduce for a couple of hours (after the initial 1.5 hour cooking time) and after adding about 3 doses of salt, it was finally tasty. I served it with pieces of chicken and a matzoh balls and it got rave reviews. I would make this again but either with less water or would build in more time to allow it to simmer like I did this time.

Absolutely the most delicious and delicate chicken soup I ever made and ever tasted. Everyone raved about it at our seder! I made it a few days ahead of time and it stayed very well.

I followed this recipe almost to the letter and it was delicious. The small change I made was that I only had time for matzo mixture to chill for an hour (vs. 2 or more). The matzo balls were still light and fluffy "floaters". Will certainly make this again.

I made this for friends from out of town on the theory that it would be "welcoming" and a "comfort food" for travel weary people. They loved it so much they would have eaten it for breakfast the next morning if any were left. FYI, I followed the recipe to the letter.

I found that this was quite a time consuming soup, yet it was quite delicious! I left more parsnips and chicken in it and this made for a heartier soup. I slightly altered the dish by excluding the chicken for a vegetarian soup and it is just as flavorful and delicious.

My first experience making matzo balls, but I will be using this recipe again and again. The soup was great and the matzo balls melted in our mouths.

I loved this soup! The touch of lemon was great, and the matzo balls were delicious. The soup definitely took some time to make, but was worth it. The kids all loved it, too.

This soup is delicious. The sage in the matzo balls is fantastic and the hint of lemon in the broth is nice, not at all overpowering. Based on the article on this site about the great matzo ball debate, i omitted the seltzer (which decreased the matzo ball yield from 32 to 25). I used my standing mixer for the matzo balls and whipped the eggs for a while -- I've heard that's the secret to a tender matzo ball. Highly recommended!
