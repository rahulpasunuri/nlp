Maybe it's me but I did this recipe 4 times, once exactly as published, and three more times with slight adjustments to the percentage of rye flour.....little baseballs every time!

Throw this recipe away. These are just blah. I won't even try making them with more rye. Don't look great either. Lots of better recipes out there. fyi I make rolls all the time.

Did this recipe exactly as written and then did a test with more rye flour based on other reviews. Maybe I'm not world's best baker, I just couldn't make them come out right. Dividing my dough into 16 rolls left me with really small rolls that didn't leave room for much of the chewy inside part I was looking for. The third attempt I divided the dough into 8 rolls, they proofed up huge and the little cracker tops looked silly on top of them. If I have the gumption to do this a fourth time I might consider making maybe a dozen rolls - but really, this takes half a day and has thus far been disappointing.

I think the appropriate recipe name is "Rye" Dinner rolls...less than 20% rye flour?!!

I decided to make these because I love rye, but they don't have nearly enough rye flour to even taste it. Needless to say, I wa a bit disappointed. If I did make this again, I would substitute more rye flour instead of the all purpose.
