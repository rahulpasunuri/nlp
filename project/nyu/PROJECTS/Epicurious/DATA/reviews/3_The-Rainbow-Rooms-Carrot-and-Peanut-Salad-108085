Very easy & delicious. As others have said, add salt & pepper. I also added shallot (vs. red onion) and quite a bit more vinegar...I prefer things more acidic. Will make again.

added chopped red onion, lots of cilantro, chopped tamari almonds, and substituted rice vinegar for the red wine vinegar -served one :)

US cooks - you will need to add more salt to your recipe as US salted peanuts have less than half the amount of salt than British ones do, Nigella is presumably using British ones!

What a fantastic way to highlight those fresh spring carrots! I do not worry about the type of vinegar or oil, it all tastes good.

I made this from the cookbook. I admit I didn't have any sesame oil, but what made this dish good for me was Worcestershire sauce. Not bad!

Very fresh and unusual, less acidic if you add a few drops of honey to the sauce

As others mentioned, I found this recipe needed salt, pepper, and an extra dash of vinegar. After that it was quite tasty.

I was so glad to find this receipe at epicurious. I made it once from the cook book which I had borrowed and returned without copying it. My initial was as those above but once I added alot more salt and pepper it sort of grew on me plus it lasted and seemed fresh for a long time. I like the idea about the red onion and honey roasted peanuts, maybe some cilantro with that?

This salad left me wondering if I had forgotten the magic ingredient. I rechecked the recipe twice! It was bland and unimpressive, but got a little better with some added salt. It was the only dish at dinner that no one went back for seconds of. The flavor reminded me of the peanut butter and dill pickle sandwich that I tried because someone said it was a taste beyond compare -- I didn't care for that either.

For those without a life-threatening allergy to the main ingredient, this is a simple, tasty side salad. I added a little more salt and some pepper.

so simple & tastey. honey roasted peanuts & red onion make for a nice twist on this salad.
