This was a really great recipe. My mother hates lamb and she loved this recipe. It was relatively easy to make, and turned out perfectly!

Well, I found out I don't like tamarind paste. It gives the whole dish a sour flavor.

I din't feel the flavor matched the amount of work involved. I, like others here, estimated the spices and used ground instead of whole; used celery instead of celeriac and made it with both lamb shank and lamb leg chops, cooking the chops for less time. The shank was definitely better, but the flavor of the spices really didn't shine through. I found the flavors mediocre.

I didn't have all whole spices so had to estimnate with ground. It took a lot of prep but my family enjoyed it. I found it needed more salt and a little less brown suger. I also think it had too much liquid so the flavors weren't infused into the meat as much as I would have liked.

I made the menu for dinner and everyone loved it! I did not use the celery root but put 3 sliced celery ribs in with the onions. I also did not boil down the sauce. I served it with the bulgar and greens in soup bowls.

Wow oh wow is this good. I followed the receipe except that I didn't have the right type of lamb or roasting pan so used a crockpot instead. Regardless, the lamb and the sauce taste great. So get up and start cooking!

Incredible recipe without using tamarind & substituting beef for lamb stock, either would add more complexity to this dish. Thought it may be too much salt but it wasn't. Had left overs with sauteed mushrooms and mashed sweet potatoes.
