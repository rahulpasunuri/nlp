I've made this a few times before, but today I got better than average results. I used meyer lemon zest and it was so tasty! Let the butter soften for a long time too - I think it helped make the texture super soft and fluffy. Also made a straighter rectangle by leveling the edges with a bench scraper.

Very simple, I'm a guy and have zero to no baking skills. This was simple and they turned out great. I actually added some semi sweet chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips as well as some bourbon vanilla extract (about a tablespoon full. Wow! I maybe could have added another 1/3 of a cup of flour though as they never really seemed to dry out like shortbread should.

Very easy. I like the softness of the dough. I substituted lemon for the orange zest and added finely chopped basil and then a lemon glaze on the final product and it was quite something.

Thanks to previous reviewers I added a lot more peel (used almost 3 tangerines). It was simple to put together and very tasty.

YUM! I added an extra tsp. of zest which gave it a nice orange flavor without being overpowering. I tsp. isn't enough. I will definitely make again - this would be good recipe for a tea or baby/wedding shower.

These cookies were delicious and so easy to make! I doubled the amount of zest, and that really worked out well. Next time I will try dipping in chocolate.

These shortbread cookies were good, but the orange zest didn't impart any flavor. I would omit all together, or double the amount of zest? These were firm after cooling; they would be good half-dipped in chocolate
