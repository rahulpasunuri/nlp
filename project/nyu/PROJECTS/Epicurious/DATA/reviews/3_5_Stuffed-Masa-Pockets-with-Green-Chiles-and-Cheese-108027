This dish was a hit with my cinco de mayo party also and I also had problems with some of the gorditas not puffing up. My gorditas were thick but still had a couple flat ones. Would definitely make again!

this was delicious- a hit at a cinco de mayo party! Where I live, my only choice was the feta cheese- which was better than I expected. Also, most of my pockets didn't 'puff' as they were supposed to, but now I know to make them thicker to start. Also seems to work best if you don't get the hot oil on the top when you place them in. But the crispy flat masa pockets tasted just as good and worked well for scooping the filling. this is a simple, different, and delicious dish to make.

I made the gorditas and stuffed them with picadillo. They were okay, but not what I expected -- when I've had gorditas in restaurants, they are more dough-y. These were crispy. Also, not all of them puffed up, which made them pretty much inedible.
