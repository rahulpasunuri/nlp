Excellent recipe. I've made it three times. Everyone who tries it ends up taking a jar home. Now I know what to give them for Christmas.

I just made this again yesterday with a few modifications - I reduced the sugar to 5 cups (6.5 cups being too too sweet) and doubled the amount of chili flakes. My only concern with the recipe, or at least how I am executing it, is how long it takes to reach 222 degrees. I had mine on the stove for almost an hour. It gels really firmly too... A jelly should be somewhat soft, no? I MUST be doing something wrong. Maybe it is as simple as the necessity for a good candy thermometre.

Love the taste. I made a mistake in the pectin conversion to metric so it turned out more watery than I would like. It still taste great and fanstastic in cooking chicken, pork, or lamb. I'll definitely make it again next year when the peppers are back in season.

Love this recipe. I have a lot of pepper plants ripening at various times so I cut the peppers and put them in the food processor with enough cider vinegar to cover and chop fine. Then I keep the blend in the refrigerator and add more batches as they ripen until there's enough to make a large pot. It works well. I also use a variety of hot peppers and cut down on the green and red and omit the pepper flakes, but that's just personal taste. I like it hot.

My Family has been canning forever, this was the first time with pepper jelly. We used Hungarian wax peppers that we grow in the garden. We used them in different stages of ripeness, to get multi colored flecks in the jelly. I came out great.

The only thing missing from this recipe is the hot water bath required to seal the jars and ensure food safety. The filled jars (with lids) must be processed in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes (or more if you are at elevation). Home canning means following current food safety guidelines to protect your family from food-borne illness. Botchilism is deadly and does kill about 40 - 50 people per year in the US. Home canned foods are the primary source of botchilism infection in the US. The current USDA food safety guidelines for home canning can be found at http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/publications/publications_usda.html

I just made this recipe today and it turned out beautifully! Very tasty, although I did substitute some fresh jalapenos for a couple of the green peppers, and I added extra red pepper flakes to make it a little spicier (otherwise it would have just been too sweet for my expectations of a hot pepper jelly). I didn't have any problem with it jelling; in fact, I followed the pectin amount exactly and cooked it until the thermometer read 222 (as stated in the recipe), and it jelled *very* firmly, pretty much immediately after I put it in the jars. So, I would definitely *not* recommend adding any extra gelatin. Overall, a great recipe!

I used jalapeno peppers (seeded) instead of green bell peppers and I only used 1 red bell pepper. I omitted the red pepper flakes completely. I used 1 packet of powdered pectin because I couldnt find liquid. I also had trouble getting the temp to 222 but got it to 215 after about 10 min full boil. This came out so perfect! Just what I was expecting flavor wise, and it jelled! Next time I make it I may try to drop the sugar to just 5 cups. It is intensely sweet. The cook from Canada - Louise- you did something weird. Please dont put gelatin in your jelly.

Though I haven't made this particular recipe, my family has been eating red pepper jelly for years. It's utterly amazing on smoked salmon and creamcheese. After trying them together, smoked salmon just isn't the same without it. I can't imagine why the combination isn't more popular.

Tips: Add a packet of knox gelatin. If you don't have a thermometer suggest cooking for 15 minutesin total. Also suggest inverting jars for 20 mins. The pepper bits rose to the top so had to empty all of it back to pot and cook for another 10 mins. Also store in frig after you turn jars upright. Helps to jell the recipe.

I've made this for years. I use jalepeno peppers rather than the crushed pepper. I serve this poured over cream cheese with Carr's round "biscuits" (crackers). It is wonderful

I made this for holiday gifts. Being a first timer at jelly, and new to high altitude baking, I had trouble getting the temp. to 222. But I think it still turned out okay. Not very hot the first round so I added jalepenos to the second batch.

I've made this jelly for years! I make it every year for Christmas at my mother's insistence. We can't imagine a holiday party without loads of this stuff with cream cheese and crackers! I played around with the recipe this year, though, and used roasted red peppers instead of raw. The flavor is intense and delicious. I also used a bit more hot pepper. Yum!

This jelly is wonderful!! We eat it on biscuits and yeast rolls. It's also great as a side condiment with chicken or turkey.

This recipe is simple and tastey. I added an additional 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper for a little more zing and the result was awsome. I highly recommend!

An absolute standard for me...bring it out for sandwiches or the big turkey dinner, give it away as an all purpose gift, wrap the top in parchment and raffia, everyone loves it! I never have enough.
