Added 1 tbsp fresh microplaned ginger to the dressing with plenty of pepper and about 1/3 cup of white wine. Tossed in 1/2 cup sauteed sliced onion and 4 cloves pressed garlic to the sauteed red bell pepper. Also cooked 2 cups julienned carrots al dente, added 1/3 cup chopped sundried tomatoes to the saute and then tossed with broccoli, shrimp and hot pasta. Served as a hot meal with parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. Very good!

Delicious! Per others' suggestions, I added ginger to the dressing and then felt it still needed something...so I added some lime juice, which I thought made it great. I grilled chicken marinated in a similar sauce (in lieu of shrimp) and grilled the peppers too. My guests loved it!

This pasta salad is delicious,especially when you add a lot of soy sauce in the dressing. This salad is irresistable.

Made this tonight,a cold wintry night, and served it at room temperature. It was delicious.And, of course, I made some changes. As suggested I added ginger and reduced the dressing ingredients by 50% except for the sugar and the red pepper. I used Chinese broccoli instead of the traditional broccoli and added chopped raw snap peas. I bet it will taste even better tomorrow.

Loved this! I am going to make this again very soon. I made it exactly as directed - most of the ingredients already on hand. I agree with one reviewer who said that it doesn't need the shrimp. I made it with shrimp - but could easily sub a different meat or seafood or extra veggies for it. The sauce could be cut back - but it was so good, why bother? Also, the only risk with changing up the veggies is ruining perfection!

I agree this is an easy crowd-pleaser to bring to a party. It's not a super-special recipe, but it works. It would be good with lots of different vegs such as sweet green peas, edamame, water chestnuts, bean sprouts, soy sprouts, etc.

Just made this for a party and it is fabulous! I took another reviewer's advice and added a bit of fresh grated ginger and it knocked everyone's socks off. I also used a combination of broccoli and cauliflower; didn't use peanut oil due to allergy concerns among guests but it was lovely with grapeseed oil in its place. Will make again, all summer long!

Very easy to make and very tasty. I used small shrimp and replaced the broccoli with green beans and it was very good. I used as a side salad and everyone loved it!

I made this, as written, for our "salad club" at work...we alternate making lunch for 14 co-workers. Everyone raved that it was the BEST recipe all year! Makes a great entree for lunch or a warm summer dinner! I prefer shrimp in it, but have substituted chicken, as well.

Great summer dish. Tastes much better if prepared and left to marinate overnight in refrigerator. I've made this dish several times and received many compliments.

You're kidding, right? Based upon the great reviews, I made and served this to company. I can't believe how bland it is! There's zero taste. After taste-testing it and before serving, I tried to fix it by adding some flavorings such as garlic salt, cayenne, parsley, etc. -- nothing helped. I wonder if people actually made this or just wanted to post something. This is bland and tasteless - a waste of expensive shrimp. If you are one of the folks who enjoyed this, I'm happy for you. Yuck!!!

Re previous reviewer, marinated shrimp and scallops in dressing. Added bean sprouts and used fried udon instead of bow ties. Added two garlic cloves and ginger to the stir fry. Dressing is fantastic! I was attempting to copy London's Wagamama's style of fried udon dishes - this came really close!

This has a wonderful light dressing to it and the combination of veggies and shrimp was wonderful. I had it at an Easter dinner- I am shopping for ingrediants to make at my house tonight!

Great summer dinner, very easy and very tasty. I added some grated fresh ginger to the dressing and sprinkled the top with peanuts. I used quinoa pasta because it was what I had on hand but may have been better that way because the pasta is less starchy. I would use the quinoa again.s

I barbecued fresh shrimp and scallops on skewers after marinating in the refrigerator for two hours in half of the sauce which I also used to baste. Didn't marinate red peppers but followed the rest of the recipe as written. We thought the salad was delicious. I will make this again.

This is a really good recipie-with a few variations. I used 2 chicken breasts (diced and cooked in water w/ a tsp of ginger) instead of shrimp. For a shortcut,I used about 3 cups of packaged broccoli slaw which contains raw shredded broccoli stalk & shredded carrots and requires no cooking. Also, I used about 8oz pasta instead of 12oz and about half of the dressing (fearing that if I used all the dressing the recipie calls for I would have ended up with "Asain Bow-Tie Pasta SOUP". I'll make this again with in the future.

So yummy! I ended up cooking the shrimp in the marinade (oops) but SO good. Really like it hot or cold. Made it in December but looking forward to making again in the summer time!

This recipe had too much pasta to vegetables and the dressing was bland. On my second attempt I reduced the pasta and oil and increased the crushed red pepper. That helped but not enough to convince me to make this again.

This is an excellent receipe. I've made it about a dozen times and everybody always goes wild for it. Its easy to make and makes a great side dish.

This is a great one to keep in mind for spur of the moment group buffet events. I used chicken. Then I made a great mistake, I marinated the raw chicken and the peppers together (oops). To decontaminate the dish, I put everything on the BBQ for a long, slow cook. The charbroil taste of the peppers and chicken actually added something special to this recipe. Everyone raved about how gourmet it was. I'll marinate them separately next time but will definitely put the meat and peppers on the grill!

I'm not crazy about broccoli, so I substituted green beans. Also used red and yellow peppers (for color) and added water chestnuts and peanuts. All in all very easy and very tasty. It keeps well a couple of days, too.

Excellent! I used whole wheat spaghetti instead of bow-tie pasta and added 1 cup of matchstick carrots. I suggest refrigerating for at least a few hours before serving. A big hit at our neighborhood cookout last night.

This recipe was only ok. Looked great on the table and receive one compliment, however it wasn't fabulous. Straight recipe was pretty uninteresting, so I added purple onion, and crushed peanuts which people seemed to like. It's good to bring to potlucks where the people aren't very discerning.

I liked this recipe very much. Instead of shrimp, I used stir fried chicken that was cooked in olive oil with a touch of sesame oil. I also added one small can of water chestnuts. I thought that it added a little more to the dish.

I made a quadruple recipe for my mother-in-law's 80th birthday party. Talk about having faith in my fellow cooks! The salad was delicious, and really quick to make. I used frozen peas instead of broccoli (saving the effort of the extra cooking), pre-cooked shrimp, it saved my jet-lagged psyche! I too thought there was a little too much sauce, but my sister-in-law had fourths, so obviously it wasn't a real problem. I served it in a big red splatterware bowl and it looked as good as it tasted.

This was a perfect dish for a 90 degree day in Washington, DC! I added red and yellow peppers for color, and I put in water chestnuts and bean sprouts for a little more Asian feel. I was pretty liberal with the red pepper, because we like spicy! It was a great dinner!

I didn't have any broccoli and I detest bell peppers, so I used sugar snap peas and diced roma tomatoes. Everything else was as written. We loved it.

Very good....quick and easy too! I added about a tablespoon of finely chopped fresh ginger which, I think, made this even better! Didn't have any sesame seeds but know that would have been the finishing touch!

Excellent! I used left over roasted red peppers. No broccoli, so I added frozen peas & green pepper strips along with celery, grn. onions & the toasted sesame seeds. I sauted my fresh shrimp in a bit of oil & added minced garlic. I think water chestnuts would be good in this, also. And canned baby corn. The ideas are endless! The dressing is excellent & one I will use many times using other meats, as suggested.

This recipe is terrific. I don't usually make a recipe more than twice, but I get requests for this one over and over. If you use different color bell peppers the salad is really colorful. I add chopped celery and top off the salad with a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds.

This was good, easy to prepare, and healthy. I did not use all of the dressing.

Wonderful and very beautiful colors with the peppers and shrimp and broccoli. I followed the recipe exactly, except a little more red pepper for extra zip. I thought the dressing was the perfect amount, but haven't had my leftovers yet -- but I'm looking forward to lunch! I served this with a variation of the La Brea Tar Pit Chicken Wings (also from epicurious) and the combo was a hit.

Ups! Made a mistake and added 6 white onions instead of 8 green onions! O'well. Perhaps next time I will marinate the red peppers by themselves, before adding the meat. I actually was really pressed for time and added canned chicken! No one could tell the difference at the pot luck! 3 people asked for the recipe! Mmmmm!

I just made this salad for a barbeque. It is very pretty to look at and the oriental dressing is just right. I added raw pea pods. I also added more shrimp than suggested. I highly recommend this as a wonderful alternative to boring pasta salad. Here's a trick: To keep the shrimp from curling, steam them in a steamer. Extend the shrimp and pack them close together so they do not have room to move. They will keep a nice long shape after cooking. Steam for five minutes.
