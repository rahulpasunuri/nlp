I'd been looking forward to trying this recipe for years, but never had the patience to wait for dough to chill or all the ingredients on hand. When I finally tried it today, I could not for the life of me get the dough to come together. Not even to make crumbs--it was more kitchen discord than world peace! I have no idea where I went wrong. I didn't want to throw it out, so I tossed it all back in the mixer with an egg and then it made cookie dough. Changed the desired texture, though. Definitely edible and enjoyable, but not the swoon I was expecting.

I wouldn't change a thing. It's a "sandy" (short) cookie, to be sure, having no eggs, which I happen to favor. Easy, make-ahead, and deliciously chocolate, with the perfect balance of salt against the sweet. Once baked, they freeze well, too.

To namMama - the recipe says to bake at 325 not 425 - maybe that is why yours did not turn out. Try again!

The directions on line are different than as published by Dori Greenspan - who first published the recipe. On this website it says to knead the dough to form a ball - Dori makes a point to work the dough as little as possible - which may be why some people said the cookie was dry or not fresh the second day. Following is from Dori's directions: Turn off the mixer. Pour in the dry ingredients, drape a kitchen towel over the stand mixer to protect yourself and your kitchen from flying flour and pulse the mixer at low speed about 5 times, a second or two each time. Take a peek  if there is still a lot of flour on the surface of the dough, pulse a couple of times more; if not, remove the towel. Continuing at low speed, mix for about 30 seconds more, just until the flour disappears into the dough  for the best texture, work the dough as little as possible once the flour is added, and don't be concerned if the dough looks a little crumbly.

I was disappointed in these--they were dry, almost like a shortbread, and I found them very hard to slice in nice pieces, as the dough was very crumbly, especially if I hit a chocolate piece, they fell apart. I ended up molding them into a flat round shape. They would work better as drop cookies, but too dry for my taste. Good chocolate flavor tho.

These are great! I made them according to directions the first time (delicious!) and everytime after have made them with dark chocolate unsweetened cocoa powder and and have added chopped walnuts as per request of my husband.

Great chocolate cookie. A keeper! And you can make the dough ahead of time and bake later.

With such a promising title, I wanted to love this cookie, but mine turned out dry and bitter, even with underbaking them.

I previously made these from her book and they were wonderful, intensely chocolatly and delicious. Definitely would make again. Emily, from Mich.

I sooooo wanted to love this cookie. I have been eager to try one of Dorie's recipes. This was fine but just not anything special and nothing I would make again. Very crumbly the next day as stated by another reviewer. Sorry Dorie.

So amazing! Used regular semi sweet chips and was out of vanilla but threw in some nutmeg and a few tbsp shredded coconut instead. Turned out fantastic and I had all the ingredients already in the cupboard.

These are pretty easy to make and the raw dough is fabulous! It tastes so wonderful and with eggs, no worries. The baked cookie is good, but did not live up to the expectations from the dough. Maybe it is all of the sugars and no egg, but the texture is grainy which takes away from the whole experience.

I add a 1/2 teaspoon of Vietnamese cinnamon it just INSTENSIFIED the chocolate. WOW

Delicious chocolate cookie, and easy to make. I used Belgian semi-sweet chocolate, and the cookies came out great. A little chewy if you underbake them a tiny bit. This will become a permanent part of my cookie repertoire.

I can't stop eating these!! I simplified the recipe. I totally skipped rolling them into logs and freezing them. I just used my 1T cookie scoop and dropped them onto my silpats. I pressed down the dough before baking so they looked the same as if the had been rolled into logs and sliced. I also used white chocolate chips instead. They came out perfectly! Definitely skip the working of rolling/freezing. They are great drop cookies!

These were really easy and good. Brought them to work and the whole batch is already gone. Used Ghiradelli 60% chips instead. Made them the night before and did not have the time to roll into a log and chill as directed so I simply scooped the dough and shaped them into discs. Also, no parchment so placed them directly onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Still turned out great. Wonder how they would have differed if I had chilled them.

Well, These were 4star goodness straight out of the oven. However, the very next day (kept in a ziploc) they were inedible. Totally dried out and unpleasant. I guess I should have known, since there are no eggs in the recipe, but surely they should have lasted more than one night! Btw, I baked at 425 for 10min.

These are some of my favorite cookies, but the recipe has been all over the internet for several years! After reading the article I was hoping another fantastic cookie recipe was shared. Will make these over and over, and would welcome more cookie recipes from Ms Greenspan.

What a great cookie. My entire family, adults and kids, loved the cookies. I made a double recipe and split the batter, adding 55% cacao to one half and chopped heath bars to the second half. They are going to school as faculty meeting treats and I am certain they will get glowing reviews. To pi3700, I did not use my silpat. I have found that for some batters it inhibits the spread of the cookie. Try parchment next time and it will work!

Just made these and helped myself to a cooling one. They are very nice indeed, though not mindblowing. I added a fair amount of peppermint oil, perhaps half a teaspoon, and it's just detectable, so don't be scared to add more than a drop. For those like me who prefer metric units, here are the measurements: 140g all purpose flour 40g cocoa powder 155g unsalted butter 135g dark brown sugar 55g sugar 150g chocolate

Awesome cookies. Great as written but probably a good jumping off point too. Maybe I'll try to add a little chopped hazelnut, heathbars or even a drop of peppermint oil as another reviewer suggested. Endless possibilities. To Seattle - Mine spread just fine. I used my stand mixer so that's no problem and I doubt the silpat is an issue. I'd guess you forgot the baking soda (or it went bad) ???

Took them to work. A hit. Almost always make a recipe as written the first time and this needed no improvements or changes. Making more again soon.

Help. The dough was absolutely amazing. Total anticipation for these cookies to get out of the oven --- but they never moved from their hockey-puck shape. My oven is trusty so that's not an issue. I did use a silpat instead of parchment, and admittedly when I was mixing dough, the texture was pretty solid, and I wondered if using a stand mixer instead of a hand mixer was a mistake. Any insights appreciated b/c I'm confident these cookies are A++++

They are called World Peace cookies because you would be welcome in anyone's house with these cookies...excellent!

Delicious! Chocolatey and not too sweet. I used 70% cacao and would not go higher - might be nice with something a little sweeter for variety. Makes a thinnish cookie that freezes well.

These are simply awesome cookies, although they go by a variety of names. Make them! I like the higher cacao content...

Fantastic chocolate cookie. Make sure you use a chocolate that you like to eat in bar form as it's critical to the flavour of the cookie. I have made these a few times now and have found that most people prefer them made with a chocolate with a 55% cacao content instead of the more bitter 62% or 72% cacao.

This is truly an exceptional cookie and quite simple to make. Don't be alarmed if the dough is somewhat crumbly when you slice it; it will come together fine when baked. Also, don't over-bake. My son likes these with a mint variation--add a few drops of peppermint extract to the dough with the vanilla. Quite good, especially from the freezer!
