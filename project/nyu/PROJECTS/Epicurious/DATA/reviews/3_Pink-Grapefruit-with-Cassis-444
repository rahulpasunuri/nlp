This is a very simple and tasty recipe. Although the recipe says the mint is optional, it's actually essential or otherwise the dessert looks like plain grapefruit with a bit of juice.

Very light. Good after a heavy meal. Don't use overripe grapefruit as it is hard to remove the pith. I have made this many times. Mix it up and garnish with a maraschino cherry instead of mint. Serve with a plain cookie. It is a very easy and versatile recipe.
