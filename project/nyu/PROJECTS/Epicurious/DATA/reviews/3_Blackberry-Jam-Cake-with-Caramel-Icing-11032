August 16, 20010. Straight-forward to make. Cake flavor and texture wonderful; the recipe makes two nice, high layers. The caramel (or, brown sugar) icing provided a perfectly sweet dressing to the cake: neither tooth-ache-inducing nor bland. I must not have cooked it to the exact correct point, however; the icing spread beautifully, but set grainy rather than smooth. Everyone was happy, nonetheless. I'll bake this cake again. Oh, it's perfectly fine to use seeded blackberry jam--the seeds weren't even detectible. Another thing: I used chopped dates instead of raisins, because I love the velvety texture of dates, and I thought that was called for in this recipe. Good call.

Two 9" cake pans? really?? The batter alone filled the two pans, but I baked them anyway. Took 70 minutes instead of 40, and now I get to clean my oven. And here I thought the icing was going to be the challenging part of this.

Delicious cake. It reminds me of the applesauce spice cake my mother used to make. The blackberry jam does keep it from being too sweet. I found the carmel icing to be a little tricky. I worked quickly to get it spread, but it still got too stiff to make it smooth and pretty. Tastes great though. Not a delicate cake - more substantial.

I've made this cake with and without the nuts and raisins, and I prefer it without. It's like a pound cake with icing. (I've also stopped before icing it--it's great as a standalone pound cake). I love it. A little goes a long way. I find it too heavy to serve as a layer cake, though. I always bake it in a loaf pan, even if I serve it iced.

I used 3 tsp. Penzey's Baking Spice instead of cloves and allspice. Otherwise I followed the directions and it turned out perfectly. Nuts and raisins in cake aren't really my thing, but I wanted to make something to accompany the chocolate cake for a work function. People loved it! I had to come to the web site to print of recipe copies for some of the fans, so I thought I'd leave a review while here.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out terribly. the cake was way too dry, and the icing way too sweet. A terrible disappointment, after all of the time and money for the ingredients. I dont know what went wrong.

Pretty tasty & received compliments from several friends. For the price and effort expended, though I'm not sure that I'll make it again. A word about the icing, though: work quickly, because once that stuff starts to harden it's really a lost cause. I had to make half of an extra batch just to finish the cake.

I made this cake for my mother's birthday and it was a success! The icing took a little long but it was great. It is a keeper!

This is as close to my greatgrandmothers recipe as you can get. Very good. My family and friends love it.

I've just finished baking these cakes and haven't started on the icing yet. It appears the cake turned out alright despite the baking soda not dissolving in the buttermilk. If I make this again, I will definitely throw in the baking soda with the dry ingredients (flour and spices) so I won't have to worry about whether enough soda actually made it into the batter.

This was my first attempt at making a cake which did not come out of a box. Worked quite well and was quite good. I beleive that it was a bit heavy on the cloves for my taste and next time I would cut it back by a third.

I made this cake as the centrepiece of a 'cake and champagne' party for my mother's 80th birthday. Compliments flowed -- the best of which were from those who said "I usually don't like cake, but this is delicious." I doubled the recipe to make (2) 12-inch layers and found that my first attempt (the only one needed)at making the caramel icing was successfully primarily because I have made pralines before. Otherwise, I'd suggest testing.

This is terrific -- I split the layers and spread blackberry jam over two of the layers and used the caramel for top, sides and the other layer. I served this with a rather tart peach ice cream and it was delicious and beautiful combination.

I used only 1 cup of sugar and substitute the blackberry jam for a strawberry jam. It turned out quite good.

This is a moist dense cake. If you are looking for a more flavorful and substantial cake than the ordinary, try this one. I used jam between the layers and the caramel on top. I prefer the jam and my husband prefers the caramel -- both ways work well. It's fairly heavy so serve small pieces.

For a reduced sugar diet or just for a less-sweet preference you can ice this cake with the same seedless blackberry jam.either way it is simply delicious.
