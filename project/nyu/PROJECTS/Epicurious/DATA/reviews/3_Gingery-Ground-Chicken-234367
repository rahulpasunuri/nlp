This recipe is great because it tastes good and freezes well. I typically make a 1-2 pound batch (usually with ground chicken breast, when the chicken is on sale and I can convince the butcher to grind it for me) and freeze portions for later use. The kids love it and it is filling. I typically use less sugar than stated but I also use mirin rather than sake. The recipe is very flexible.

This was good. It is a very convenient "go to" throughout the week and very kid friendly. I didn't know where to find ginger juice in my small nova scotian village so I just microplaned about 1.5 tablespoons of ginger and I didn't have sake so I used the same amount of rice wine vinegar. I served this over egg noodle dumplings and the kids demolished it.

Surprisingly simple and tasty! I added some red pepper flakes and some salt to heighten the flavors.

Very tasty! I added a smidge of garlic and used grated fresh ginger because I have no idea where to find ginger juice!

This recipe is a staple at our house. Quick, easy, delicious. We serve it over rice with a side of edamame

The chicken as not as flavourful as I expected. I added some hoisin, chili-garlic sauce and soy sauce, mixed with cooked rice and baked in phyllo. My hubby made a S&S sauce and it was like eating an asian sheppard's pie! Not bad with a side of slaw.

Very flavorful simple topping for rice. Served with goma ai and topped the rice with bonito flakes.
