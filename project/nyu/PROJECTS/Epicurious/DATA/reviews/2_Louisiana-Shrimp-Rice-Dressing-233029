This recipe did not meet my expectations of a Louisiana shrimp rice. It wasn't too spicy and didn't have the intense flavors expected. I would doubled the cayenne pepper and garlic next time. It tasted more like rice topped with canned tomatoes and shrimp. Not quite what I was expecting to serve at my Thanksgiving table with this dish.
