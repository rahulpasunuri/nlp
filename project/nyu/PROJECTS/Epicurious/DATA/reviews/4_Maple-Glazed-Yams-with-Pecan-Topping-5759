This is a nice recipe. I made a few changes. I boiled the 3/16" slices 3-4 minutes, drained, them microwaved, covered about 4 minutes, with a little water on the bottom. I then added the maple syrup/brown sugar mixture and baked, uncovered 15' at 400. I'm afraid of saturated fat clogging my arteries so I left it and the flour out. Everyone enjoyed it.

This is going to be the only sweet potato I make from now on! Like other reviewers, I doubled the topping amount. I also substituted half of the brown sugar with maple sugar for more maple-y goodness.

If you are already a fan of candied yams, this is a great twist, with a yummy maple flavor that marries well with all the other flavors of Thanksgiving. Be sure to slice the yams about 1/4 inch thick so they cook enough. I followed the recipe exactly, and found it to be perfect as is.

Rating: 4
this was great - i only had 4 people over so i halved the yam recipe and kept the topping amount the same - i would definitely double the topping if you plan to use the whole recipe. I'll probably use the food processor for the topping next time - seems easier than using your fingers.

I've made this recipe several times, it's great. The one thing I'd caution though is try to use several smaller yams rather than the really large yams. Otherwise if you use really large yams they will definitely need more time to cook than the recipe calls for.

This was just too sweet for our tastes. More like a dessert than a side dish.

Rating: 3
This was great! We had it for Thanksgiving, and it was a great sweet addition to all the savory items on the table. We only had half the yams, but we used the regular amount of topping. It was great, but we could each only eat a small amount because it was so sweet. It served 7 and there was some left over.

This is now my holiday yam recipe. It is beloved by all who taste it, and it is quite simple and quick to prepare. I used to swear by my mother's sweet potato recipe (replete with marshmallows on top), but this more subtle, but just as tasty, version has won out. Try this - and the more pecans and maple syrup, the better!

This was a huge hit at my Christmas dinner! It has nice flavors and the topping adds a great crunchy texture. A good alternative to the standard candied sweet potatos with marshmallows or boring mashed.

I have been making this recipe for 6 years now. My family and friends all insist I bring it to every Thanksgiving and Christmas. I do double the topping and everyone just loves it. It isn't traditional, which is fine by me, because prior to this recipe, I didn't eat yams.

Rating: 1
I cut back on the maple syrup and this was still way too sweet. Also, I made the topping just as the recipe says and it came out of the oven looking like it was dusted with flour. Not appealing to look at and not tasty. Lots left uneaten after supper. Disappointing after all the good reviews.

I love sweet potatoes and I'm always looking for the ultimate dish. This is not it, but it's very good and I'd make it again. I left out the pecans and used 2 fewer tablespoons of butter but it was still very tasty.

This is a holiday staple in our house - Thanksgiving, Christmas and Chanukah! I double the topping since it's SO yummy and in this case, more is definitely better.

I cooked the yams in a casserole dish, and then packed them into a small round dish, and added 1/2 cup more of maple syrup. They came out great!

made them for dinner today (thanks giving) Awesome!!! Didn't boil them first, just cut them into chunks, lightly tossed them with oil, salt, and pepper, baked at 375 for 45 minutes, then added the syrup with some grated fresh ginger, topped with the flour, brown sugar, pecans and butter mixture -- baked another apprx. 25 minutes....Fabulous. A new tradition!!!

These were the best sweet potatoes I've ever had at Thanksgiving. The topping seemed a little skimpy, so I tripled it, but this recipe is otherwise perfect. Even my husband and my sister who NEVER eat sweet potatoes could not stop eating these.

A very nice alternative to the typical mushy yam side dish. The slices keep their shape and so add a bit more texture to the dish. I made a little extra topping because I wanted to have a good crust on top. Be sure to use cold butter when making the topping, otherwise it'll all get mushy and be hard to sprinkle evenly. I've added this to my recipe box!

Rating: 4
Made this "much requested" dish again for Thanksgiving and it just gets better & better! For times' sake, I now use canned yams, heat and mash with cream and butter, then 'smooth' into a corning-ware dish and then poke many holes for the syrup and add topping- this variation is the winner with our family!

Rating: 4
Everybody LOVED it!!! Use a little less butter than it says. It is really rich with as much as it calls for. It is also great using regular sweet potatoes. I have done it both ways.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent recipe that has become a holiday tradition. I originally made this for our first Thanksgiving because my step children asked for yams with marshmallows like their mom used to make. Unwilling to put myself in a no-win situation (and since I loathe marshmallows) I made these instead and they were a huge hit with adults and children alike.

Rating: 4
i've made this several times and it's always a favorite- especially among people who swear they normally don't like sweet potatoes. however, having made this exact to instructions as well as with variations, i offer the following suggestions: you can definitely cut back on some of the butter. when i used as much as asked for, i felt it was overkill and took away from the delicious sweet taste. i also preferred using maple crystals (sugar) instead of the syrup. with all the syrup and butter, i found the potatoes to be too sweet and too wet (moist?). the maple crystals add the right touch

I've never made Yams before, but my husband wanted them at Thanksgiving. Luckily, it turned out to be the HIT of the meal. My mom was even a little jealous because everyone raved about them more than her delicous food! I will definitely be making these again.

I was looking for a recipe that wasn't as sweet as so many of them are. This one was delicious and you can really enjoy the taste of the yams without all that goopy topping. I sprinkled 2 teaspoons of grated orange peel over the top after dotting on the butter, and that was a wonderful enhancement.

this was a big hit. My whole family appreciated that it was not too sweet. The maple syrup is definatly the key.

This dish was sooooooooooo good! I like the usual holiday recipes with the marshmellows but wanted something more subdued. The reviews on this were great and I had to give it a try. I made it ahead of time and would occasionally baste the potatoes with the syrup and butter juices. Everyone raved about them! A super yum!

Made these as a side dish for a glazed pork tenderloin and they were great. I was serving these for a very large crowd so I doubled the recipe. Plus, to jazz them up just a bit I added chilled CINNAMON-CHILI BUTTER to the potatoes. The combo was great!

What a great dish!.....I made these as an extra veggie dish for easter as my sister in law is a vegetarian. She devoured 1/2 herself. I was also afraid they would be to sweet, but were just perfect. I boiled and baked the first 20 minutes the night before..then finished baking a half hour before dinner,you can definetly make ahead of time.

I have never made yams before, so this was my first experience since I was asked to bring them to the family Christmas Dinner. They were a huge hit, and everyone wanted the recipe. My brother in law said they were the best he's ever had. I did add extra pecans and brown sugar, but everything else was to the recipe. Great dish - very very easy.

I made this last night with beautiful organic yams and it was wonderful! For the reviewer who said it was too sweet, make sure you use real maple syrup, grade A, not "log cabin" "maple-flavored" syrup that Americans have come to know as maple syrup. I also hate yams that are covered up with sweet stuff especially marshmallows and perfer them baked with butter, but this recipe was so yummy!

Rating: 4
This is an absolutely delicious version of sweet potatoes. In fact it almost reminds me of a dessert crisp--sweet, homey and satisfying. Like the other cooks, my guests came back for seconds; they couldn't get enough of it. I did, however, make a change in the streusel topping; the proportions did not seem correct. I used 1/2 cup flour, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 3 tablespoons butter. I also added a little cinnamon. The texture and taste was perfect. I can see myself making this recipe over and over again.

For Thanksgiving I was asked to prepare "Candied Yams." Because I have always disliked "candied yams", preferring the unaltered yam flavor, I had a dilema. I came to your website to search for inspiration and found this recipe. I was preparing this dish for a group of very picky- eaters who normally would not eat any food that was orange, unless of course it was covered with marshmellows. Well, to my surprise and delight everyone raved about the yams and returned for seconds and thirds. I am preparing the yams for Christmas, too! I will use less sugar and less maple syrup - I thought they were a little too sweet, but still very, very good.

Few people in my family like yams, but I love them! As I was the one making Thanksgiving dinner, I made an executive decision to include yams. The constant comment at the table was, "I don't really like yams, but these are great!" We are going to include them in our Christmas menu.

Very rarely do I not tinker with a recipe, making small adjustments to suit my tastes. However, this is just such a recipe. Don't change a thing - it is perfect as written. You will think there isn't enough pecan topping, but there is. The amount of maple syrup is just right. This is my family's new standard sweet potato recipe. There were about 10 dishes on the table including the turkey and this was the dish that had people greedily eyeing the pan for seconds. If you like sweet potatoes, this is the recipe for you.

This is now our traditional holiday yam dish. I have made it with fresh and canned yams and both are great. I actually made a mistake the very last Thanksgiving and cooked the fresh yams too long (had to make it a whipped-yam dish instead with a little half & half and then poked holes in the top so the syrup could soak in). That is now the big favorite!

Rating: 4
You can follow this recipe exactly OR play with it and it still comes out delicious! Sometimes I like to cook the yams until soft and then mash them instead of keeping them in slices. When serving kids who may not like pecans, I'll sprinkle one side (or the edges - if the serving dish is round) with the pecan topping and the other side with just a flour and brown sugar mix. Those who have told me they don't like yams happily eat these. It's a crowd pleaser!

I have made this dish four times now, and my family requests I make it for every Holiday get together. I use much more maple syrup, brown sugar and pecans than the recipe calls for -- go ahead and use the whole bag of pecans! Oh, and I'm rating this based upon my families response. I don't eat yams!

I made these yams for Thanksgiving this year. Everyone enjoyed them, but I was a little disappointed in how "clumpy" the topping was...Didn't really crumble, so it was difficult to distribute evenly. Regardless of it's appearance, this dish was quite delicious.

A Winner! This will replace my delicious but tired traditional Thanksgiving yam recipe. It tasted like sweet potato pie with the topping. I would add more pecans (not sugar or it would be too sweet) and try lightly toasting them first, as suggested, to make them crunchy. Can even add another potato or two without adjusting anything else. It was even better tasting a few days after Thanksgiving so you can make this way in advance.

This will be a keeper for Thanksgiving. I used a mandolin to slice the potatoes, but will use a Cuisinart next year, as that would be easier. Leftovers were great, so the dish could undoubtedly be made in advance and reheated.

Words cannot express how good this dish is at a Thanksgiving meal. Follow ingredients exactly the first time you make it. I added a 1/4 cup more syrup before baking because I didn't think it was enough and was sorry I had after it had baked up. Glad for the tip not to add more pecans, otherwise I would have because when making topping it does not seem like there are enough. But any more would overwhelm. Can be made a day in advance although I did not add topping until I re-heated it. My family voted to make this a staple at Thanksgiving!

I made this for Mother's Day and everybody raved about the dish. I will be making this, not only for special holidays, but as an everyday side dish. The only change will be to alter the amount of sugar and nuts. I had cut back on the amount of potatoes and used a smaller size baking dish. Because of that, the nuts were a little over powering. Otherwise, this is a great dish to make ahead.
