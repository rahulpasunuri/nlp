This recipe didn't work for me at all. It is one of the very few recipes from Epicurious that I have tried and the end result was a fiasco. The russet potatoes are very starchy, so even though I carefully followed all directions, I ended up with oniony fried mashed potatoes. The dish didn't look appetizing, was heavy, and the flavors were overall disappointing for all the time spent cooking.

Nope. Potatoes fell apart and never formed a pancake. However, I just continued to pan fry them and they turned out fine. To answer someone's earlier question, you can sub butter for the oil. Just FYI, I only used about half of the oil and butter of what the recipe called for. I recognized it was too much while reading the ingredients. You can always add more, but you can't take away!

a great way to use up leftover baked potatoes. i always bake a couple extra and use them the next day for a good hash brown.you have to have the chopped onion in it.it just sets the flavors right up there. i add a little chopped garlic and some chopped fresh herbs also. what ever herbs you have on hand and sounds good at the time.a good start to a special breakfast or brunch. yummmmmmm, your hubby and family will love this. very easy to make

My Uncle Ken cooked in an Officer's Mess for 30 years and reading this I can hear him say "if the potatoes are diced they are not, repeat, NOT hash browns, they're pan fries". I still can't make hash browns as good as his.

Ack! I don't know what it is about Epicurious and their potato recipes (or maybe it's that I don't know about Epicurious' potato recipes and my ability to prepare them -- though I DID follow this recipe to the letter, like it said), but they never seem to turn out quite right. In this case, it wasn't a big mushy mess, but it was a big GREASY mess. The potatoes had a definite shine to them...The boyfriend loved it, but it gave me a tummy ache. :-( ...And if I make it again, it won't be for me... I think I'd have been better off conjuring up my own recipe for hashbrowns.

These hash browns had a surprisingly large amount of oil. Also, they easily came apart when I lifted them onto a plate, and the only way it will hold for a bit is when it burns.

Delicious, yet the process seems a little complicated to me... If I dry the shredded potatoes very well in a clean kitchen towel, they turn out crispy enough in the skillet and I don't need to use the oven. Besides, butter can be easily replaced with olive oil for a result just as tasty and more heart-healthy.

Does anyone know if i can substitute melted butter for vegetable oil?

I followed the recipe word for word and it came out fantastic. Definitely a step above the average hasbrown. Very, very delicious.

I used my trusty electric frypan on 350 f for 8 min per side. I too added some sharp cheddar and diced green onions near the end of cooking. Served with beef tenerloins in a cognac cream sauce* to standing ovations. *another GREAT recipe from this collection.

Great Dish, served with omelets and sauteed mushrooms. I didnt turn it into a cake, but kept the pieces whole and crisped them over medium heat.

One of the several times I've made this recipe. I used turnips instead of the potatoes and I have to say... THIS WAS INCREDIBLE! Definitely a do-over!

Yummy. Added some diced green and red bell pepper with the onions for flavor and color. Double yummy.

I made this as part of a brunch menu for 23 people. For that number making it into a pancake was not practical,so I fried the potato and onions together but all mixed up. It was still very tasty. The only other change I made was I added sweet paprika (just a sprinkle) to the potatoes in the fry-pan then I convection-roasted the hash browns in the oven (350) for about 15 minutes to get them nice and crispy on top, the paprika adds a real nice color to them, and some added zip. I would make this again, but next year may try that recipe from this site for the very easy sounding "hash brown casserole", it sounds pretty betty crockerish but the reviews were really good. After peeling and cubing 8 pounds of potatoes I am wondering how I missed that other recipe!

I loved this recipe, I added sharp chedder cheese to the hash browns before putting it in the oven, it added a wonerful creamy taste. Next time however I won't cook the "cake" for the entire 10 min. on one side, it was a few minutes too long and some of the onions burned. I will definately makes this again!

Use more onions. They shrink way up. Mash the potatoes more than you'd guess. The turning and baking didn't work out for me. I finished them up in the fry pan when they fell apart trying to flip them. I stirred them up, browned some more, and put the pan on low with a plate over it while I cooked the steaks. After all, they ARE "Hash" browns, right? The onion is what makes them delicious.- I can't even imagine how many calories this has, with all the grease in it. But My My My, they're Gooooood!

EXCELLENT !! An excellent "side" dish to the Fabulous "21" burger.

Although I was unable to keep the hash browns together in one piece as a "cake", the taste made up for the less appealing presentation! Worth the splurge in fat calories!

I've been trying hash brown recipes for months - this one takes the cake! Peeling the potatoes takes forever, so do the first half the night before. Definitely use both large onions, don't over-boil the potatoes, and you'll have everyone singing your praises at breakfast!

When I asked my son what he wanted for his birthday dinner, his reply was steak and "21"club hash browns. Highly requested dish in our family and worth the little extra effort.

I have cooked this recipe 3 times in one month and everyone wants it! Unbelievably good. And the smell of the onions cooking in the butter get your taste buds ready. This is a fantastic recipe- 5 forks for it!
