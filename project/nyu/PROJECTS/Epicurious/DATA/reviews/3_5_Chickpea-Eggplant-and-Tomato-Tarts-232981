This just might be my new favorite eggplant recipe! I had a lone eggplant and was desperately searching for some inspiration when I found this. I was kind of 'chickpea'd out' so I substituted white lentils for the chickpeas to keep it hearty. Also used puff pastry and put in individual ramikin dishes with a puff pastry top. Kept it from becoming soggy like most reviewers said and was easier to handle than the phyllo. Also made enough 'pot pies' to freeze for later. Love anything one pot and easy to throw together like this! YUMM

Great recipe! I used two pie shells instead of phyllo dough.I also omitted the parsley (didn't have any) and added 1/4 cup of grated hard goat cheese to the top of each, a few minutes before they were done. They came out perfectly. I think it's key to wait until the filling is quite thick and not at all runny before baking. I also recommend baking the pie shells for 5 minutes before adding the filling. Thanks for the recipe!

It's not easy to find Phyllo dough in Trinidad so I made it with pate brisee and it came out perfect. Great for a lunch by the pool served with a nice green lettuce salad and a nice ice cold mint ice tea.

I'm writing a follow up to my first review in January 2006, because I've made this for pretty much every thanksgiving and xmas since. I think this is definitely a 4 star meal. Cook the liquids off so the phyllo doesn't get soggy - mine are always crunchy and delish. We also make the filling on occasion without the phyllo - it makes a delicious and very quick ragout to just cook with a side of rice or polenta, and is much less work.

I thought this recipe came out very well. I followed the directions as written, but made phyllo cups in a muffin pan. I will make again...

Great recipe! Followed the directions exactly as is and my wife and I think it turned out fabulous.

The filling was amazing - the non-veggies in my party were in love with it! The phyllo didn't work out so well, but that could just be the local supply here...

I have my own take on this. Forget chickpeas, instead use lentils. Forget phyllo, instead bake in soft tortilla spread with butter and black pepper. Smother in cheese, and go to town.

OH WOW!!! This was SO... disgusting. Soft on soft with a little grainy thrown in and then place it in phyllo. This is not a good recipe. Even with cooking the liquids off it was still so mushy. I am a veteran of working with phyllo and I was greatly disappointed with this recipe. The edges had crunch and the center was soggy. I would not recomend this for anyone. The texture and the taste is just not there.

This recipe was wonderful. I made this as a side dish to, "scrod with chipotle butter and black beans baked in parchment". I grilled the eggplant to deepen the flavor. I used puff pastry, cut each sheet into four triangles and placed them into well greased muffin cups. I filled each cup and baked until lightly golden brown. Next time I'll add salsa and sour cream for a garnish.

This dish was so fantastic I could not stop eating it, even when I was full to bursting. I wanted to make more of it immediately! The only minus of this dish is the left-overs the next day aren't that great heated up in the microwave because the phyllo gets soggy.

Couldn't stop eating the filling while I assembled the tarts. Being non-veg, figured things could be enhanced by eliminating the tomate juice and substituting chicken broth plus some extra chicken buillion. Also panseared the eggplant (Asian- no peel, beautiful color), added after reduction. No sauce. Family bought my announcement of "gourmet mixed vegetables". Served with lobster ravioli. I think this would be fabulous as a one-dish pasta meal plus crusty bread.

I made a regular sized one of these as my vegetarian entree for christmas dinner, and made smaller sized ones for guests side dishes. Everyone agreed that it was delicious. It was really easy, the flavors were subtle, but it was also hearty enough to be a main course. I will definitely make this again.

3+1/2 forks really! We decided to make the filling and just serve it as a dish on its own, with fresh pitas and some balkan-style yoghurt (sour-cream like) to dip pitas and/or top filling. I wasn't sure I'd like it but it was fantastic. Unfortunately my husband has already claimed the leftovers for work lunches; I was hoping some would be left for me to enjoy again. Absolutely definitely will make again. Oh yes - I used about half the oil called for and some extra cumin (ground from some cumin seeds I toasted first for extra flavor). Try this!!!

Delicious with pizza dough instead of phyllo - excellent robust vegetarian dish.

My wife substituted frozen puff pastry shells to yield a side dish sized tart that was much easier to prepare than working with the phyllo. Delicious!

The phyllo dough was a bit tricky, but the tarts turned out delicious! The tomato chickpea filling is very tasty. I made sure to cook it long enough that there was not extra juice to make the crust soggy. Definitely made my vegetarian thanksgiving!

I thought the filling was tasty, unique. I think it would be nice as an appetizer dish, served with crostini, crackers...I'm not sure you need the phyllo. But the phyllo makes for a nice presentation.

I did a "pre-Thanksgiving" run of this recipe. I made half the filling with phyllo pastry and half as calzone. We thought the calzone worked better with the heartiness of the filling.

Tasty vegetarian dish. I will make again. Phyllo is always hard to work with, that being said, this wasn't too hard. I added twice as much garlic to the filling, and increased both the paprika and cumin to 1 teaspoon each (also used a whole bay leaf). Make sure the liquid has evaporated, so phyllo doesn't get soggy on the bottom.
