Vegetarian worchestershire sauce (no anchovy) is available, but you will have to go to a health food store or read the ingredients on organic brands at the supermarket. Other notes: I prefer to hand chop everything for a coarser texture, and soaking the red onions (sliced but not minced yet) in water for 15 minutes and then draining well takes some of the harshness out of them. Also, with all those olives, salt is rarely needed.

I made this for Thanksgiving. Too much olive oil and very strong flavor. It would definitely make a good spread on a sandwich. I used it as a toasted baguette spread. Next time I may not puree as much.

I have made this recipe several times over the past three months for summer bbqs and picnics, and it has always been very well received. I use about half the olive oil it calls for and I add a little chopped celery. For the green olives, I use the pimento stuffed jarred olives. This recipe makes a large quantity of muffeleta, but it lasts for a long time. Not only is delicious on cold cut sandwiches, but its the perfect spread for grilled chicken breast sandwiches and (mixed with extra vinegar) as a salad dressing.

I thought this spread was delicious - full of flavor. We used it to make Muffuletta sandwiches for our Mardi Gras party and they were a huge hit. The spread was also good just on a cracker. The only change we made was to cut way back on the olive oil. Yummy.

I used this the past two years for sandwiches for a Mardi Gras party and it was a big hit. I am getting ready for round three.

Try this with this spread: Muffaletta Dip Spread Softened cream cheese on the bottom of a baking dish. Spread muffaletta olive mixture over the top. Then chopped salami, grated swiss and mozzarella cheese. Top with green onions. Bake 5 mins until cheese melts. Serve with wheat crackers.

I made this for my bridge group and served it as a dip,it was given just a so-so review. This probably should be used on a sandwich and not as a dip.

Loved this spread. Followed another reviewer's suggestion of adding provolone, french ham, italian dry salami, and new york pastrami, and it made a great sandwich. Easy to make and guests raved about it.

Delicious! Great as a spread. If you like olives, you'll love this. I agree with previous reviewers, however, that it is not the most visually appealing--sort of a textured, mushy, dark brown. If you're making it for a party where presentation counts, find a way to dress it up. But find a way, because it tastes great!

Personally, I was not impressed, but about half my guests liked it. I served it as a dip, and think the appearance was put-offish, and that it would work much better used as a spread, as suggested. The taste was good, but not zingy enough. Tampering would fix this.

Wow! This was so easy to make (even for 150 people!). It's flavorful and perfect for parties. I served this spread with garlic bruschetta for my wine club members at one function, then with thick slices of sundried tomato bread for a catering. People always hover around the dish, then ask for the recipe. Fabulous!!!!

This is excellent. My husband and I returned from New Orleans and discovered the Muffuletta sandwich (ham, pastrami, salami, provolone and a similar but chunkier olive spread on a huge roll). This was a big hit. I look forward to making the sandwich with this spread for friends.

Great spread! Used it on a large deli sandwich for an office party and even the picky eaters liked it! We were using leftover bread to dip into the spread just by itself. Best if you make it early and let flavors meld, but I think recipe suggests that.

Everytime I serve this, I get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. It's easy and different enough to notice by guests and goes great with cheese and crackers! Try it!!
