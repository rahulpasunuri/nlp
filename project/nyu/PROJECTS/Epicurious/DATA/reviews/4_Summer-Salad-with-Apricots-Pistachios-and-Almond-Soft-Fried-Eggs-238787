VERY delicious, however there is a big warning that yes, this is as finicky as it looks! make sure you're doing a full on 'simmer' for the 6 minutes when boiling the eggs- but its a fine line, don't overcook!! you still want very soft eggs. if the egg whites break during peeling, they're still ok to bread and deep fry, so long as the yolk isn't punctured. getting the flour/breadcrumb mix on the eggs might require some improvisation depending on how delicate the eggs are... eggs don't need to look perfect, they will still look very gourmet if a little out of shape and guests will be very impressed. i couldn't find good apricots so I used peaches and nectarines (2 of each) and they were delicious. good dinner for 4 people, especially if appetizer is served beforehand. great idea for dessert: pistacio or lemon gelato **also, in retrospect, I would have cooked 2 extra eggs in case one or two broke during peeling.

I loved this recipe, I am 15 and don't cook much, but decided to make this salad for my parents anniversary dinner and it turned out amazing. It was Simple and easy if not maybe a little time consuming. All in all delicious and light but filling. I did cut the salt in half which seemed to be fine. For dessert we had a heavier gelato and it topped the meal off wonderfully.

this was spectacular! i had a left over sherry vinaigrette that I used instead of the lemon one but I thought it worked very well. Will definitely make this again.

What a great combination, and well worth the effort. The pistachios were camoflaged amongst the greens, so when my guests came upon them they were happily surprised. The apricots were not overpoweringly sweet and the lemon dressing balanced the palate well. I loved it.

The salad as a whole is delicious, but I really really love the eggs. I make them to go along with much simpler salds too, to dress things up for company. They're a little labor intensive with all the bowls you need, but not too complicated, and they definitely have a "wow" factor.

This is a very rich and tasty salad and is not as fussy to make as it may seem. It made a nice light summer meal for four. You can halve the amounts for the dry ingredients when breading the eggs and you should have plenty; I ended up with lots of leftover breading when I used the full amounts. I fried the eggs in just a half-inch of oil by rolling them around and they still cooked quickly and evenly.
