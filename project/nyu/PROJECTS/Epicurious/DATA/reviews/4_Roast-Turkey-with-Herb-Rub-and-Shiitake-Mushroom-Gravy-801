Ok. Like soooo many others, this has been my absolute go-to turkey/gravy recipe since the magazine came out in 1994. And even though I'm not in charge of the turkey this year, I've been asked to make the gravy. And well, this is THE one I'll make.

Rating: 3
I just made the mushroom gravy. It was very good, make sure you add the cream!

Rating: 4
Like many others we have used this recipe every year we have had control of cooking the turkey (only 2 times since 1994 that we have strayed). LOVE IT! We have substituted less expensive mushrooms for the gravy at times and it turns out just fine. CHANGE: we always grill our turkey on the Weber. One year we did it in the oven and we will always grill it. It takes more time - but it frees up your oven for all the other goodies. AND THE BEST PART is the smoky flavor the turkey has - and we use the drippings from in the grill to add to the gravy - so the gravy has a smoky flavor as well. This will actually make you slap someone it is so good!! Best recipe ever!!

I have used this recipe every year since it was published in Bon Apetit in the 90's. I still have my copy of the magazine. I think it is THE BEST TURKEY RECIPE EVER. The turkey is delish, but the gravy, the gravy, the gravy......it is unbelievable. I always have to make extra or there will not be enough for the leftovers. Would I make it again? YES!YES!YES!

I have been making this since 1994 from my very battered and beaten original copy- i have never stuffed it- any suggestions what cooks well inside this bird with the herb springs?

Not much to add here to the reviews! Still cooking from the original magazine. It is absolutely spectacular! Family would have my head if I didn't make this gravy!

I find it difficult to review turkey recipes because I don't eat the skin which is where I assume you would taste the herbs, for example. Anyway, for the turkey proper, I can confirm this tastes like a turkey. Where the action is, as others have noted, is the gravy. This is a tasty gravy, for sure. Like others, the roux was a bit of a disaster. Like others, I ended up with plenty of roux-dumplings floating around in the gravy, even after boiling for 20 minutes. If you can't find a way around this I still think it's worth it because it tastes so good, and fishing for roux-dumplings isn't the worst activity in the world.

Absolutely fabulous!!! I've been using this recipe since it appeared as the "cover bird" on Gourmet magazine years ago - it's a family favorite. Just follow the directions and it's fool proof every time. It is not our custom to carve the bird at the table and I don't use the pan drippings for gravy. Instead I strain the drippings, discard the fat, reheat to almost boiling, then pour the drippings over the cut meat to freshen up the flavour - then bring to the table. Delicious every time. Enjoy

I have been making this turkey recipe ever since seeing it on the cover of the 1994 issue. The gravy is sooooo good that my cousin actually stole the leftover gravy, put it in her purse and took it home.....lol. The best turkey recipe ever!!!!! Thank you Bon Appetit.

Rating: 3
Three stars for the shiitake mushroom gravy. Very good and rich tasting. I used tawny port instead of sherry, and homemade turkey stock instead of canned chicken broth. I had major problems with the roux. It curdled so badly that I had to use an electric whisk to remove the lumps, and it splattered all over the stove top. I think the right technique is to add hot liquids into the roux, not the other way around. The gravy also tasted better the next day. Next time, I will make it one day in advance, and add pan juices at the last minute. Less stressful.

Rating: 4
This high rating is only for the turkey. The gravy did NOT turn out well and the mushrooms cost a small fortune, so never again on that. But everyone loved the turkey. Used a pre-brined turkey from Trader Joe's and home grown fresh herbs. Used sprigs of sage, tarragon and thyme in the cavity (did not stuff). Left foil on longer then recipe called for, as it was well browned from the start. BEST turkey ever!

I have been preparing this turkey since it was first published in 1994. I have not made the family turkey for thanksgiving since meeting my new wife (4 years) This past thanksgiving I made for the entire family and they now treat me like a rockstar! I always double the fresh herbs and really butter up the bird good before placing in the oven. This was the recipe that really turned me onto cooking that many years ago. Thank you Bon Appetit!

Rating: 4
I made this for thanksgiving this year and it was a big success. I brined and and served it with Corn Bread Dressing with Pecans and Bacon (which I did NOT stuff the turkey with). The grocery store only had a single 3 oz package of shiitakes left so I had to use baby portobellos to take up the slack. With the brining the turkey was just short of too salty, so I'm glad that I didn't stuff the bird. The gravy was to die for, but with the brining it was almost too much salt (I guess because the pan drippings were also salty). Anyway great recipe.

Rating: 4
I'm not a big traditionalist when it comes to holiday meals, but this recipe keeps showing up on our table every Thanksgiving. It's not that I don't scout around for new or different recipes to try; it's that this one is nearly unbeatable. I've been making it for at least 10, probably more, years. The turkey is always moist, even if you overcook it a little, and the flavor of the fresh herbs is fantastic. The gravy is by far the best turkey gravy I've ever tasted. If there is such a thing as a sublime turkey recipe, this is it.

I've been making this since it first appeared in 1994. It is EXCEPTIONAL. Don't even think of NOT using fresh herbs - makes all the difference. I cook my turkey the day before I want to serve it. No more mess in the kitchen. I also brine my turkey and do it in pieces! I then roast the white meat parts and the dark meat parts - each get done perfectly (no more dired out white meat). I then carve and get it ready for re-heating the next day - just place the pieces on a rack over some chicken stock. Cover with foil and reheat for moist turkey.

4 forks for the GRAVY. The flavor combination of the sherry and shiitake is divine. I made it exactly as called for and then put the gravy in the blender. I will be making this every year from now on. The turkey on the other hand wasn't quite up to my standards. This was the first time I didn't brine the turkey before roasting and my family was quick to let me know that they missed the usual moistness and flavor that a brine produces. The herbs for the turkey work well but I will not make the mistake of skipping the brine no matter what the recipe says. The gravy got excellent reviews from a wide range of tasters including some who usually avoided mushrooms.

Made it again for the 14th time yesterday to universal acclaim: "the best gravy I've ever had...I could eat that whole pan right now" or "will you give me your secret, PLEASE?" This time, I used pecan oil for the bird, because we had some, and just a drizzle of blood orange oil for the shiitake-sherry gravy. Used shiitakes and pine nuts in the dressing. Fantastic.

Rating: 4
Flavorful, moist, and delicious! This was the best turkey I have ever made. We cooked it in a bag, which helped ensure we had lots of tasty juices for the gravy (and clean-up was a snap). Also made Nov- 08 "Sausage Stuffing With Fennel and Roasted Squash"...these recipes complemented each other beautifully. I can't wait for leftovers tomorrow, especially the leftover gravy!!!

I have had my copy of the November 1994 magazine for 13 years!!I should know the recipes by heart. Unfortunately it was lost in a recent move. I've used at least 10 thanksgiving recipes out of it and shared them many times. This turkey is a hit every year. It is moist, full of flavor, and the gravy is out of this world! I am so happy to have the internet, I was a little worried. Thank you epicurious.com!

I've made this turkey to rave reviews every single year except one sine 1994. That is the year everyone complained that I didn't make my signature turkey. I use Amontillado sherry: it's nuttier than other sherries, and adds a faint hazelnut/butterscotch flavor to the gravy. Which doesn't mean it tastes like candy: it's just the perfect balance. I make a dressing with shiitakes and pine nuts as well. RAVE reviews every single year.

As with many others, I've been making this turkey recipe since it first appeared in November, 1994. Every year, I read the new recipes, but none of them comes close to the combination of herbs that this recipe uses. I was amazed last year when I read that Barbara Fairchild also rates this as her favorite. The whole house smells like wonderful giving it a warm comfy feeling. A real winner!

I made just the gravy which was great. Unfortunately, I used the turkey joice from a store cooked turkey (the kind you just warm up for a few hours). This juice was super salty. Wish I would have tasted it before creating the gravy out of it. I would have diluted it with lowsalt broth or even water or more cream. Next year, I'll do the whole recipe, turkey and all.

Delicious and simple turkey recipe. I drenched a chessecloth in butter (instead of drizzling it)and covered the turkey, basting often and changing the cloth once. This kept the meat soooo moist. For the last hour or so, I roasted it uncovered and it was golden brown to perfection. The gravy was the BEST! Really delicious. Loved it.

I think I can finally quit experimenting with roast turkey recipes. This is a very good basic turkey recipe. Of course, I made a few changes; adding roasted garlic (& the oil used to roast it) into the rub. Also, I rubbed the herbs in the night before & rubbed them under the skin. The turkey had great flavor! If you stuff the turkey (a must in our house) I would not add any additonal herb seasoning to the stuffing; the herbs from the turkey flavor the stuffing very well. Also, I did not use the whipping cream, thyme or tarragon in the gravy (too tired of reading recipes at that point) and the gravy was excellent.

Friends are hosting Thanksgiving dinner this year and they have requested that I bring it along... it's that good!!!

I've also been making this recipe since it first appeared in 1994 and was pleased to see so many reviewers who feel the same way, especially the one who noticed Barbara Fairchild's comments in the November issue of Bon Appetit, as did I. We've always used dried mushrooms and the gravy has worked wonderfully. One year we even forgot to add the cream to the gravy, and didn't end up missing it. Now we never add it. We also stuff the turkey with homemade stuffing (homemade bread cubed and roasted, lots of sage, onions, celery). The whole this comes out wonderfully. We've also experimented with other Bon Appetit recipes from time to time over the years - for one of the holidays but not both - and always come back to this recipe. It's simply the best!

I have made this recipe for 10 years. I stuff the turkey with quartered oranges, lemon, lime, & rosemary. Cover with foil and do not baste. Take out of oven when temp reaches 165 and let sit for 20 minutes before carving. You must make the gravy, fabulous. Use only fresh shiitakes.

I didn't measure the mushrooms carefully, used reconstituted dried shiitake and fresh crimini. Perhaps I overdid the 'shrooms, but most people at the table were looking for gravy and wondering if that was some weird mushroom soup. It didn't taste badly, just didn't seem like gravy to most.

I've been using this recipe pretty consitently since 1994 although I've experimented with some of your other Turkey recipes. Somehow, I always seem to fall back on this one.

The turkey is always very flavorful and has been a tried and true favorite at our Thanksgiving table.

Don't worry about using shitake mushrooms - any ol' mushrooms will do. I like to pair this with a mushroom,sage and sausage stuffing.

This was my first attempt at a roast turkey. While this recipe tasted terrific, it came out more "traditional" than I expected.

If you make this recipe, make sure you have a good supply of quality chicken stock on hand.

This is the most unbelievable turkey and gravy combo... I am a pseudo-vegetarian who only eats meat on special occasions (like Thanksgiving) to be polite but I am HEAD OVER HEALS for this.

I've made this turkey 4 out of the last 5 Thanksgivings, each time to rave reviews. If you have time, prep & allow herbs to marinate turkey overnight - makes a difference but, the turkey will still pick up the intensity of the herbs if prepped same day. I double the gravy recipe because it's always a hit and used on everything. Shiitake mushrooms are wonderful but, regular white or canned work beautifully and are more economical.

Since I don't have to cook the turkey each year, this review is based solely on the gravy. YUM! We make this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas (and in June for a mid-year treat). My husband is so crazy about it he eats it like soup! My mom used to make her ... er ... gizzard gravy every year. She's converted. This is so much tastier and less ... um ... gizzard-ish. What IS a gizzard anyway? I HIGHLY recommend this gravy! Substitute Zantham Gum for the flour for a low-carb gravy that's just as tasty!

I have made this turkey and gravy every year for the past five years and it has become my signature dish. I use only fresh herbs because it makes a huge difference in the flavor as well as the aroma.

This recipe produces a "perfectly" cooked turkey...crisp,golden skin and moist tender meat! I take the turkey out of the oven when the deepest part of the breast is at 161 degrees farenheight. After the 30 minutes rest period, it will rise to approximately 170 degrees, with the carry over cooking. This ensures that you will never end up with dry breast meat! I took the advise of previuos reviewers and put some of the herb mixture under the skin. This seemed to help add flavor to the meat itself. I couldn't find shiitake mushrooms, so I used baby portabello with great results. I only used a splash of cream to finish the gravy...it was wonderful. This recipe is so good that I often make a 12 pound turkey for a non holiday dinner. Everyone loves it and the leftovers make great hot turkey sandwiches the next day. What a treat!!

The quintessential Thanksgiving turkey! It was beautiful and moist. We loved the gravy and it was very easy to make. It was a treat to have baked an 18 pound turkey for just the two of us. The leftovers were as big a hit as the original meal.

The Ultimate Turkey of Choice. We have made this turkey for the past four years for Thanksgiving, we can't get anyone to leave the table.

I've made this recipe for Thanksgiving for 3 of the last 4 years and always with great success. I don't make gravy very often and I'm a bit unconfident about it, but this gravy always turns out great. As a concession to the children's limited palates I made the gravy without the shitake mushrooms this year and it was still good.

I cooked the Thanksgiving bird myself for the first time this year and it was delicious! The gravy was better than my mother's, and I think that says it all! I would definitely make this again!

Not sure if I did something wrong, but I did not think that this gravy was out of the ordinary. It was good, but not something I would serve for Thanksgiving again.

I made only the gravy recipe. I did a traditional turkey and stuffed it with a bread, sage and onion dressing. We also had mashed potatoes, etc. The gravy did not stand out like other reviewers indicated. It was okay but not special. I may try it again with the turkey. I was disappointed because I love wild mushrooms.

This was my best turkey yet but my modification was to soak the turkey in brine for 12 hrs. 1 quart water, 1/2 cup salt, 1/4 cup sugar, boil with herbs and cool. Put bird in large pot cover with brine, top off with ice water and store in room temp. The bacteria is killed off by the brine. Once cooked it squirts out juice at ya so watch out! I make the sauce with portobellos and served it with a Ridge Geyserville Zinfandel 1997. Cranberry cherry sauce, wild rice w/filberts, and sweet potatoes. I was mobbed afterwards, be careful, this recipe may be hazardous to your health.

Fabulous!!!! This was my first large Thanksgiving since my marriage two years ago - the oven broke down 3 hours into the turkey so had to carve it early and finish it in the microwave - and it was still great!!! Rubbed fresh herbs under skin and used port instead of sherry in the gravy - everyone raved.

First turkey I've ever made -- wonderful. The outside is crisp and the inside is juicy! The gravy is truly out of this world -- I used a sausage and apple stuffing outside of the bird. Great combination of flavors - I did put a bit of the rub under skin on breast and used portabello mushrooms instead of shiitake -- big flavor!

My family would pout if I didn't make this gravy every Thanksgiving! I've been making it since Novebmer 1994! Fabulous!

To get the spices to permeate the turkey, try soaking the turkey in a bucket of salted water with the spices overnight. I know this sounds crazy, but it really makes for a juicy, tasty bird.

I made this 5 years ago for my first annual Thanksgiving dinnerand plan to make it agian this year. I normally try to do new turkey recipe every year but this one is good enough to repeat.

I have been making the gravy for Thanksgiving dinner since it first appeared in Bon Appetit back in November '94. The gravy is always a big hit! I don't use the Roasted Turkey with Herb rub even though it is very good. I love the Roasted Turkey with Grand Marnier Apricot Stuffing in the Silver Palate Good Times Cookbook. Try adding a cup of dried cranberries along with the dried apricots in the stuffing--pretty.

I made this recipe when it was first published. The gravy is a real winner, and every year I can't resist splashing sherry or madiera into my gravy no matter how its been made. The herb combo is a fabulous flavor too. I do agree that the herb rubbing doesn't really penetrate the bird, perhaps I will try stuffing some under the skin next time. hmm I might have to make this again this year...

I make this every year. It is a huge hit. I substitute fresh Portabello mushrooms which cost far less than Shitake. The result is wonderful.

Since 1994, when this recipe was printed, my family makes this every year, no matter who's house Thanksgiving is held at. Fantastic and addicting.

My husband and I made this for dinner tonight using a turkey breast and the fresh herbs in our yard. We followed the temperatures in the recipe's cooking instructions, allowing shorter roasting time for the breast, and it worked just fine. The turkey was incredibly good, and the gravy was truly exceptional. I reconstituted half of a half-ounce package of porcini mushrooms in one-half cup of boiling water to use in the dressing, and saved the strained liquid to use in place of some of the broth in the gravy. Couldn't find fresh shiitake mushrooms, so substituted portabellas. What an awesome meal! My husband had thirds. Tonight's dinner was a dress rehearsal for Thanksgiving, when we have a crowd to cook for, and we will certainly be repeating this again. After thirty years of cooking turkey dinners, this was absolutely the best.

I made this for 15 people at Thankgiving and the gravy was very popular. The turkey was good too, but the comment was that you could not taste the herbs as they did not penetrate the skin. Next time, I'll rub them on under the skin.

Fantastic! During the last 15 minutes of roasting we drizzled maple syrup on the turkey. We will definitely do it again!

Very flavorful, especially when the bird is cooked upside-down. I served it to 19 at Passover to rave reviews.

This was my first Thanksgiving, and I just converted my entire family over to the Shiitake Mushroom Gravy! I didn't even add the cream; I thought it was thick enough without it.

This recipe won rave reviews from a dinner party of 20. There were no leftovers!!!

I've never made this, but my mother has. Deborah is right. This deserves a four-fork rating. Goes REALLY well with dried fruit stuffing (Bon Appetit Nov '97) and sweet-potato/pear puree. Yum. Thanks, Mom!

I took over Thanksgiving when I was 16 with this recipie - It has become a tradition!
