Since this first appeared in Gourmet, the recipe has been an absolute must for all holidays. They are easy to make and loved by everyone, except maybe the vegans & they're just jealous!

sprinkle with sea salt just as they come out of the oven (or before they go in oven?)

I've been making these for years, too. I like to include them with the holiday cookies I give out so if people are getting tired of sweets, there's a savory nibble for them, too. And they look pretty!

This was a lot a work but, fun. They were quite good and kept well from making them the day before. It's easy to over cook these but they taste better if they are a little brown. The folks at the party gobbled them up.- Great vegetarian hors d'eouvre.

I've been making this for 10 years, and it always gets rave reviews. Best baked right before serving. I usually make a couple of these and keep them in the fridge. When company comes we slice off a few pinwheels and bake them right up. Great!

Worth the effort to deal w/separating, kneading and then rolling the doughs into pinwheels. Big hit at holiday party. A bit greasy; had to dab w/paper towel after cooking and before serving. Great w/white wine at a holiday open house.

Great! Very rich. A little extra effort, but nice presentation. I don't have a food processor, so I let everything get soft, and and blended the dough with my hands. Worked perfectly.

I prepared the pinwheels for our Christmas buffet and they were delicious. The pinwheels were worth the time.
