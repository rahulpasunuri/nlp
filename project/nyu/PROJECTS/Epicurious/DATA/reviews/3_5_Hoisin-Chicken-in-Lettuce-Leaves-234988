This is a very flavorful recipe and a fresher way to have Chinese food (i.e. not take out). I made it for a pot luck and everyone LOVED it. It is also a go-to for weeknights because it is pretty quick to make. I add a little extra ginger and scallions because i love those ingredients.

Delicious! I followed the recipe except I added sliced mushrooms. This was my first try from this website and it was such a big hit that I decided to register and try some more recipes.

This is a good base recipe. I doubled it for an entree and used chicken thighs. I liked the sauce better after adding soy sauce and Sriracha. I added some carrot to the mixture and gave the finished dish a good squirt of lime juice at the end of cooking which brightened the flavor. Next time, I might omit the nuts and add another crunchy vege instead. I can't remember what the PF Chang's version tastes like, but who really wants their cooking to taste like PF Chang's, anyway?!

This is a family favorite. I use peanuts rather than pine nuts. I've made it with both dark or white meat chicken depending on what I have on hand with equally good results.

Really very good. I used unsalted peanuts since they were in the house & it came out great.

It just tasted a bit bland and a bit saltier than I expected, despite adding some of the modifications suggested (hot sauce, bean sprouts, cashews instead of pine nuts). Didn't taste like the PF Chang version. Maybe the Cheesecake Factory technique of grilling the chicken and then putting the sauce on would have been better...

Great recipe but do double it if you are making it for a HUNGRY family of four!

This recipe was really good! I recommend using boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts, though--so much more succulent and flavorful (unless you are watching your weight--then stick with the breasts).

I made this almost according to the recipe, but took others recommendations. I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and chopped the chicken smaller than 1/2". A good addition, I think. I also used 2 heaping TBSP of Hoisin sauce (Koon Chun - the best) and added some dried red pepper at the end for some kick. Not quite PF Chang's - but darn close. Husband loved it. Absolutely must have the pine nuts for the crunch, alone with the water chestnuts. There's still something missing, but darn good anyway. It makes 2 main course servings, but would be good for 4 appetizer servings.

Yum! I also subbed cashews and added a bit more ginger, used a good quality hoisin sauce (a recommended one). Fast and easy to make, tastes so fresh. Hubby said it was outstanding.

This is very good. I made it exactly like the recipe said except that I couldn't find scallions so I omitted them. I would recommend using a little less Hoisin sauce; perhaps substitute some soy sauce instead. It was just a little too sweet. It's a very specific recipe and I'd recommend just playing around with it instead of following it precisely. Keep tasting, and add and subtract to taste. The presentation is beautiful, though. And if you are serving this as a main dish, this really only serves two people. I served it in several layers of lettuce as a single-course meal, and it served myself and my brother without any leftovers.

For me, this recipe was decent, but didn't really stand out as far as flavor. If you want to try a more savory version, I added 1 tbsp. black bean and garlic sauce and 3 tbsp. fresh chopped cilantro to the mixture just before serving. You can get black bean and garlic sauce in the Asian section of most grocery stores.

Good recipe. My boyfriend loved it, I think it's ok. It certainly took longer than 10 minutes--about 25 minutes including prep. I added a few dashes of hot sauce, some extra rice vinegar, and doubled the ginger because I feared blandness. I find the best way to eat these is to tear the lettuce into smaller pieces, like 3 in squares, and then serve with a good spoonful of the chx mixture. Otherwise my butter lettuce leaves fall apart and it's both messy and hard to eat

These were really yummy. Followed the recipe, but also added some finely chopped garlic and used canola oil. Will definitely make these again...an easy recipe to make as well.

Yummy! make sure you use a good quality hoisin sauce--it does make a difference. I've used cashews instead of pine nuts. Both are good. And I've used butter lettuce leaves. Really really good.

Good for a crowd because not too spicy but can be spiced up by adding chili oil for those that like spicy. Made this for Christmas Day and we all enjoyed it.

I used mushrooms instead of water chestnuts and ground the chicken breast, and the dish was somewhat lacking in texture. Next time, and there will definitely be a next time, I'll use water chestnuts. I'll still use ground chicken.

Another cashew and green onion adder here. It was an excellent mid week dinner. It make together quickly and very little prep time. I have most of the staples in my fridge so this will be a standard for our house.

So wonderful, and so easy! I subbed mushrooms for the water chestnuts, since my husband won't eat the latter, and put in a tad more ginger. I think it would lend itself to substitutions if one didn't have certain ingredients, but it's really good as is.

Awesome dish, fast and easy to make. The only subs were cashews. The lettuce was too messy for my husband so he put his in a flour tortilla, Much to my amazement it was pretty good in the tortilla. Next time I will make with rice or noodles.

Gross. And some of the ingredients were pricey.

This is a great snack/appetizer/lunch/quick dinner. I've used it many times, and leftovers work just as well as freshly made. I used at least 1/2 the salt (with recommended hoisin), cashews, and added extra sauteed carrots with the mix to stretch it. Also, I used romaine, which seems to work well for most lettuce wraps.

Myself and guests really enjoyed this recipe. I made it with tofu and with chicken and it turned out very well. I have had several requests for the recipe and have enjoyed making it.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe except left out the water chestnuts (my husband doesn't like them) and used a different brand of hoisin sauce. I thought this was a little too salty - maybe it's the brand of sauce I used - but I would skip the 1/2 tsp of salt next time. I used green leaf lettuce and the wraps were a little messy - maybe iceberg would be better?

I loved this recipe - and rarely comment. But this was so good, I can't wait to try it again. Made it as written, but will probably try either cashews or almonds next time.

This wasn't bad. With modifications, this was a solid 3 stars. We added sriracha sauce, julienned carrots and red pepper, omitted water chestnuts because we have a hater in the house, and skipped the nuts because I forgot to buy them. Without the sriracha, it was a bit bland. Next time, I might add more veggies and some cilantro. It was quick and easy, so it's worth a little tinkering.

Rating: 3
This was very easy and tasted great, although I think it could have been better with a better brand of Hoisin (I used the Dynasty Brand, which was not recommended, but it was all the store had). I loved the water chestnuts so much that I will probably double them in the future. Also, Ice Berg lettuce would be best, since the red lettuce I used wasn't strong enough to hold up so we wound up eating this over rice, which was still great. A keeper for sure.

Made exactly as printed and thought it was terrific. Easy, but really good flavor.

This has already been reviewed so often it probably doesn't need another, but I will vote with the folks who use cashews instead of pine nuts (just because of a slightly more assertive flavor). I loved the water chestnuts and the crunch of using iceberg lettuce as a wrap or scooper. The second time I made it I doubled it so we could really pig out and had only one can of water chestnuts so I used a can of bamboo shoots coarsely chopped as the other half of my vegetable and that worked great too. A great quick. light supper.

I just made this last night-- it was so easy and tasty. I added red pepper flakes for some heat, substituted cashews for the pine nuts as suggested, and served with fresh bean sprouts in addition to the lettuce. The sprouts added another nice layer of crunch.

So good and so easy. Made it on the spur of the moment and it was perfect for summer. I did use the cashews like others suggested. We also made a PF Chang's style dipping sauce (chili sauce, tamari, rice vinegar, chinese mustard)

I followed the recipe exactly as written and I'm glad I did. I had dinner on the table in less than 20 minutes(including defrosting chicken) and it was perfectly delicious..far better than Chinese takeout, less expensive and healthier too. I think the flavor of the pine nuts got lost in the sauce. Another reviewer suggested subbing cashews maybe they would be a better option. Will increase the heat by adding some Srirachi next time. I think this would also be good with pork - chopped pork tenderloin or a good quality ground pork. The water chestnuts were absolutely perfect in this. Don't omit them!

Loved it! Quick and easy. Used ground chicken and almonds instead of pine nuts. Next time I am thinking of adding a sliced red pepper, maybe mushrooms and serving it over rice. I liked the lettuce leaves but my carb-loving family needed a little more to make it a dinner.

Both my husband and I thought the chicken was a bit bland. Not sure if it has something to do with the brand of hoison (though I've had no problems using it in other recipes). It needs a bit of spice and more depth. Not terrible, just needs tweaking.

After years of living in NYC and never cooking, I moved to the suburbs and rediscovered the kitchen, with trepidation... This recipe made me feel like a star. My very discerning (i.e. picky) 15 year old step-son raved about a similar dish at his favorite restaurant and asked if I could make something like it. I tried this recipe and he LOVED it - saying it was even better - and asking that I make it a regular dish, which I have. He and my husband take 3rds and 4ths each time, and ask that I make enough to ensure leftovers. I love it too. Best yet, it is incredibly easy to make. I don't know enough to change anything, but to us it is perfect as written.

I followed the recipe exact, and it came out great. It was dinner for three of us, and next time I will probably double the recipe because we were still hungry after. Its a keeper though and high in protien. Served with a side if chili paste to add heat if wanted.

Very Good. Made exactly according to directions, however we served it with a spinache and baby lettuce salad tossed lightly with an Asian dressing. I added a little cilantro and pickeled ginger to the salad. Then let the chicken cool to room temperature and put it on top of the salad. This was a wonderful summer salad for dinner. Do try this. Yum.

I made this with cooked cellophane noodles added and ground turkey instead of minced chicken, which made it super easy! Butter lettuce makes better "cups" due to its shape.

Very versatle dish. . .yup, I made some changes. Used chopped up scallops and shrimp instead of chicken. Forgot to pick-up a can of water chestnuts, so I used shitake mushrooms instead. Very good recipe. My boyfriend couldn't cram them into his mouth fast enough! The only tweak I'd make next time, would be to add a touch of fire (like a few serrano or jalapeno slices) and a touch more ginger.

Wow! I've been a huge fan of chicken in lettuce leaves and order it every time I see it on a menu. This recipe couldn't have been easier, took just a few minutes to make, and was delish! My son who is the worlds most picky eater loved it. I served it with Jasmine Rice and steamed broccoli. Also made an extra 1/4 of the sauce (Hoisin, vinegar & Worcestershire) for dipping/rice, etc. A great quick, tasty, healthy meal and frankly better than some versions we've had in restaurants. This one is a keeper!
