Really good on cold potato salad as the dressing and also great in mashed potatoes. We choose potatoes over pasta with this pesto every time.

We tried this recipe with pistachios then almonds then macadamia nuts. We liked the macadamia nuts the best actually, but the pistachios were good too. You need a more oily nut to cut some of the spiciness of the arugula.

I really liked this recipe. Especially the Pistachio!

This pesto is a good variation on the traditional and while I liked the extra bite that the arugula gave it my guests didn't think it was interesting at all on pasta. Later I tried some spread on grilled veggie sandwiches which pleased everyone much more.

Very good! I've made this a few times for summertime pizza on the grill. It's a great alternative to regular pesto! Be sure to use unsalted pistachios, otherwise it will definitely come out over salted. This recipe is also good mixed with a marinara sauce.

This is exceptionally crazy good. Very lemony and such a wildly different flavor combintation that it really makes you take notice. We tried it many different ways with feta, tomato and proscuitto; blue cheese, olive, and with the carmelized-onion pine nut topping also appearing in this issue. Insane!
