Yummy, kid-friendly and really easy. I posted a photo of this on my blog (sometimes it's easier to cook if you have a photo of the recipe). http://www.feedyourkids.com/2006/11/green_ beans_with_bacon_and_red.html

I started this recipe 3 hours before the dinner party (didn't know how much of a distraction baby would be). Very easy, very fast recipe. Once done, I was VERY DISAPPOINTED with the flavor. All the salt and pepper didn't make a lick of difference to the beans b/c it would wash off into the broth. BUT AFTER SITTING IN THE SALTED BROTH FOR THE NEXT THREE HOURS, the beans soaked up the flavor and was WONDERFUL. Next time, if I don't have the extra 3 hours, I'll season the beans before the broth goes in.

I agree with others. There was nothing wonderful about the taste of this dish. I would not make it again.

This is definately a way to get non-veggie lovers to eat their green beans!! I used haricot verts and they were just great. The flavors blend so nicely and create a wonderful tasting dish. The presentation is gorgeous as well. This is definately a keeper.

Easy and quick, best with market fresh young beans. Added chopped shallots and garlic to ours!

Very very good, and quite easy. I made it a day in a half in advance for easter dinner. After sitting and marinating in the juices that long, it had a very good brothy, bacony flavor. Do not stir in the bacon chunks until ready to serve however. Was great at Easter. Next time, I may leave the bacon bits out all together or just put them on individual plates because the leftovers the next day were a little soggy, but overall, very good twist on green beans. My husband who hates veggies even ate them!

really good way to zing up green beans. Nice smoky flavor. Good with a hot fruit side, too.

This dish is always eaten up so quickly when I make it. I even used canned grean beans instead of fresh ones and they still came out good.

I doubled this recipe for a holiday dinner at a local neighborhood bar and this was a hit! The green beans held up in taste and appearances on the banquet table. A crowd pleaser for sure and I would make this again and again.

OH MY GOSH!! these were so yummy! everyone was picking them out of the bowl and eating them before dinner. I was even told that they were a must for thanksgiving now. way better than the old cream of mushroom soup green beans!!

Quick, easy, and delicious. This uses ingredients that are usually on hand. I made it with garlicky grilled steaks.

Basic recipe is open to variation. Alter to suit your tastes. I added some shitake mushrooms and a purple japanese eggplant, large dice (eggplant takes less time and should be added near the end of cooking).

Trying to cut carbs and add more green veggies? This fast and simple recipe works well with chicken, fish or pork.

Cooks the green beans *perfectly*. I thought the dish was a bit unnecessarily fattening. I think you could halve the bacon and keep the flavor.

It's Christmas Eve and I'm on my way to the grocery store to purchase the fresh ingredients. My sister-in-law now asks for this every holiday. Simple and deeeeeelicious. What more is there?

Loved this dish!This recipe was easy and delicious. I served it with pork tenderloin and mashed potatoes (used the chipotle and orange marmalade sauce found on this website). As my guests were mingling and sipping on drinks, I made this dish. I fried the bacon a couple of hours ahead of time as well. This is sure to become a repeat dish in our house

There's nothing wrong with this recipe, but there's nothing particularly right about it, either. It didn't come together in any particularly interesting way, but then again, it wasn't a lot of work. I remain on the prowl for a great green bean recipe.

This recipe was a hit with the family! It was very easy to make. I substituted the low salt broth for regular broth and it was fine. I cooked the beans a little longer because I don't like my beans too crisp. The only thing that took time was trimming and cutting the green beans. But aside from that, I would definitely make this recipe again!

My wife and that this was great! Made it according to the recipe since we like crunchy beans. Easy and a nice change from regular beans.

I used my own chicken broth that I make up ahead of time and keep frozen in little baggies in the freezer. I added a bit of minced garlic while I was frying the bacon and I too cooked it a bit longer. It was wonderful.

This was a really tasty and colourful side dish. It's a nice departure from boring old boiled beans! I cooked the beans for a bit longer than specified, because I don't like crunchy beans.

The rating is actually a 2.7... it is not delicious but it is good enough to try and presents well on the plate.
