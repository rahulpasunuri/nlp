Not as quick and easy as described. Tasty! Easy on the anchovy and parsley. I will try again minus the anchovy and will add cheese...

This is very easy and doesn't taste bad. It just isn't memorable either. The anchovy paste doesn't add very much to the flavor so don't feel like you need to purchase it if you don't ave it on hand and the seasoning mix relies very heavily on salt to convey any flavor.

Super easy to make and tasty. The presentation is excellent with great colors.

I hate anchovies, but I thought I'd try this anyways. The anchovies give it a nice flavour, that well, doesn't taste like anchovies. Definitely a recipe I'll make again.

Definitely exceptional as far as simple chicken dishes go! very easy, I used a red and yellow tomato from the garden and a little smear of goat cheese. I also deglazed the pan with white wine and added butter for a simple sauce. Made smashed potatoes (recipe available on epicurious) and some steamed broccoli for a delicious meal. I highly recommend this meal for a simple weeknight dinner that is a big step away from simple chicken cutlets. Try it! AND DON'T SKIP THE ANCHOVY PASTE! It's essential!

I used basil instead of parsley, but otherwise made it as written. So good and so simple.

i did not use the anchovy, used basil because i like it, and was sugggested, sliced a boneless cutlet and pounded it, did not overcook as cautioned, and will definitely make it again just like that!! also used toothpicks to keep it together. husband loved it too! used my garden tomatoes

I also like anchovy but thought that this was too fishy. The anchovy didn't meld with everything as I expected. I think I would have liked it more if I sauteed the anchovy, olive oil, garlic mix a little to soften the anchovy flavor then put it on the chicken. Still it was beautiful with my heirloom tomatoes. I will probably make it again but tweak it a little.

Oh my gosh! These were SOOO good. I don't know why people tasted too much anchovy. I followed the recipe to the letter and the only problem I had was that the smaller chicken pieces came unfolded. But I think that was because I turned them too soon. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the pan juices were amazing! I will make this again and again. It was easy, tasty and beautiful. Company would think you spent ages making this when it only takes about 30 minutes.

I was eager to try this recipe as it was simple and chicken recipes are always welcome. I did not have scallopini, so we took regular breasts, halved them width-wise and pounded them thin. They were still somewhat thicker than true scallopini. I also substituted green onions for parsley. The meat envelope held together in the pan surprisingly, and the result was pretty moist with a pleasant brown color. However I could still taste the anchovies, and it was just not that exciting. I'm not sure I'll make it again, except perhaps to use up the rest of the anchovy paste.

This recipe is exceptional! Impressive for company, but fast and simple as well. The anchovy adds a unique flavor that is not fishy or overpowering.

Delicious and soooo easy. After reading the reviews, I switched parsley for basil and it was definitely an improvement. I also used heirloom tomatos and they added so much flavor.

i reviewed this before, but i wanted to say to ktaormina from california that it's essential you use a scallopini chicken breast for this and cook it in the pan, using thighs in the oven is not the same. it's such a great recipe!!

Easy, quick, full of flavor. I topped with feta cheese.

At first I thought the anchovy paste would be over powering. It was not and tasetd very good. I only made two changes I used basil instead of parsley and I BBQ instead of baking . We really liked it

In a word - AWFUL. In another word - INEDIBLE. My husband LOVES anchovy and was so looking forward to having this. To be fair, we live in Baja Calif and boneless chicken breast (heck, ANY chicken breast) is a challenge to find. What they here is spades is the thigh/leg combo as one piece. So, I used that. Must say this chicken is very inexpensive, about $1.80 for 3 big pieces. I chopped up the tomato and added it to the other ingredients, then I stuff all that under the skin and popped it in the oven until done. It was horrible. We chopped it all up and gave it to the dogs for breakfast. They, on the otherhand, thought it was delicious. I would not recommend making this for company unless you've tried the recipe yourself first!

My husband and I really liked this dish. I served it with pasta and used the sauce from the chicken over the pasta. Also, sliced a few extra tomatos and put that in the sauce - yum!

I liked it. It only got an "Ok" from my boyfriend. The anchovie paste gives it a unique zing. I also used basil instead of parsely.

This is a nice easy recipe. I made one change and that was to use Basil instead of Parsley. Also used toothpicks to hold it together: which makes it easier to turn.

A real keeper. I made only minor edits - I used 2 garlic cloves and I deglazed the pan with some left over wine. I agree with the other cooks DO NOT omit the anchovy paste (unless you're allergic) - it blends in perfectly.

Great recipe - easy to make, great flavors - added a little ricotta cheese to the spread - yummy. Will be making again soon.

I made this with Orzo with Everything for my husband tonight and we both loved it. After our trip to Italy I keep finding myself gravitating to Italian flavors. Anyway, the cutlets taste even better when you sprinkle a little crumbled feta inside and substitute fresh basil for parsley in the anchovy paste. I also let a few basil sprigs peak out of the pocket for color.

Excellent--made just as written. I don't like anchovies either, but you don't taste anchovy here, it just adds a layer of flavor. Did not have to use toothpicks, it just sort of stuck together. Oops, I actually did make an addition--I had some pre- sliced thin mozzarella,which I put on top, and stuck in the broiler at the end. A definite keeper.

If you like anchovies or at least don't mind them, then you will probably really like this dish. I, however, do not like anchovies but I decided to try this dish anyway because the introduction gave me the impression that the anchovy paste would subtly enhance the dish without making its presence known, sort of like fish sauce, which I also find gross, but is frequently necessary and truly delicious in many Asian dishes. Not so here. Rather than subtly enhancing, the anchovy paste made itself glaringly known. However, anchovies aside, this was a very nice way to prepare chicken and I will probably try it again without the anchovy paste.

This is a very tasty and easy recipe (and I usually find chicken breast to be bland.) I made one change: I used basil instead of parsley. The anchovy makes the difference. A note for the cook: thread toothpicks through the fold to hold the chicken together. It makes it a lot easier to turn over.

I didn't have roma tomatoes from my garden yet so I took a regular size fresh garden tomato and sliced it. To make it easy to handle, I tied each piece of stuffed chicken with some kitchen string. It made handling so easy. I too was skeptical of how much juice I would have. Surprisingly, it makes enough! This was a great use for my garden tomato and parsley. Don't omit the anchovy paste. You don't taste it but if you omit it, it won't be delicious.

This was really good and very quick to come together. I added a few herbs from my garden to the Italian parsley and next time will be more adventurous with the combination. I used red, yellow and orange tomatoes and the dish looked beautiful and tasted delicious.

This dish has everything you want in a recipe - delicious, easy to make and good visual appeal. Followed the recipe exactly, the anchovy paste makes the dish, do not skip it.

fabulous. i thought it would be dry and tasteless - just the opposite. i used spinach instead of parsley and ground the stuffing, minus the tomatoes which i used as directed, in the mini processor. spectacular and so simple.

If you're afraid of anchovy paste, don't bother. Without it, this is just another sauteed chicken breast recipe. I've been adding anchovy paste to savory dishes (including pasta salad) for years, to rave reviews. Only one other person -- an accomplished cook -- has ever figured out the secret ingredient. So if you've never used anchovy paste, go for it! Just don't tell anyone until after they've finished eating. (And even then, don't tell anyone who can't handle the truth!)

Wow, this recipe tasted as good as it looked and was super easy. Next time I will probably almost double the filling and follow the suggestions for sauce in another review, and maybe even the addition of goat cheese. I thought that it would be too much so I made a spinach salad with goat cheese, which worked nicely.

Very easy & very good. The better the tomato, the better the dish. Looks impressive enough for a party.

This was very easy and delicious, though I made a few adjustments to enhance it. I spread a very thin layer of goat cheese before adding the garlic-parsley filling. (It helped the filling stay in place). Then when the cutlets were done, I deglazed the pan with a little white wine, 1/2 cup chopped tomatoes and 1 tbs. of butter. We like having a lot of sauce! Great meal!

Turned out really yummy. I blended the stuffing ingredients in a small food processor. Turned out great. Followed the recipe exactly and would make again the same way next time.

This was so easy, and so very good! I admit it, I skipped the anchovy paste -- I used garlic paste instead along with the minced garlic and parsley (double garlic!). The timing suggested for cooking was perfect. This was a no fuss, easy weeknight dinner!
