Excellent easy delicious recipe! Fabulous with salmon works with cilantro or basil. I did not have hazelnuts so I subbed with toasted pistachios.Wonderful!

LOVED this!!! Even my nine year old couldn't get enough of it. So easy, healthy, and not as heavy as basil pesto. Made it with halibut instead of char- we're more of a halibut family. Definitely restaurant quality.

This fish was so easy! Took no time at all and the pesto was delicious. I used macadamia nuts instead of hazelnuts. It turned out really well. Oh, and sole instead of char. yum yum yum. 14 min the the oven. I added some more cayenne and sea salt on the top when it was done - I think that made it better - but it was good already.

WOW!! This pesto was dee-licious!! We made the pesto exactly as written, and served it with coho salmon, since char wasn't available. Great dinner!

This dish was excellent and easy to make. I did not have access to a food processor so the pesto was finely chopped and mixed by hand. We doubled the amount of garlic. Fabulous.
