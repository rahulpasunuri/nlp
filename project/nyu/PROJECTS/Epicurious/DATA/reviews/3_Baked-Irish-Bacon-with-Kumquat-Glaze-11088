I made this last year for St. Patrick's Day and it was a big hit. So much so that I'm going to make it again this year. Irish Boiling Bacon is not available here, so I have to order it online. Worked out great. I used my own candied kumquats that I had put up myself, but I've also made the glaze with orange marmalade. It's great both ways

So maybe I'm a kumquat wimp, but this recipe just didn't do it for me. The kumquats had kind of a bitter-citrusy taste. Maybe if someone could think of something to offset this?? I tried jam and white sugar but neither helped.

I made this with canadian bacon. And after searching 3 grocery stores, I wasn't able to find preserved kumquats; I used orange marmelade with a bit of lemon juice instead.
