Very good, modified by using banana instead of apples. Great texture. To the Indianapolis cook, I believe instant oats normally come in the individual serving size brown bag (often pre-flavored).

First time trying this recipe. It is definitely a repeater, with a few mods. Was in a hurry so I didn't read the reviews until after I made them. I used all whole wheat pastry flour and egg beaters for the egg. Increased the cinnamon to 1.5tsp and I think next time I'd add cloves or allspice because you could hardly taste the spices. Needed to thin the batter a little, but what a great oatmeal flavor. I think the apple gets lost with the maple syrup so I'm not sure what to do next time. Maybe use apple butter and decrease the added cinnamon?

Nice cinnamon flavor and moist texture. The apple flavor really didn't come through for me (perhaps the flavor is in all the juice I squeezed down the drain?). I don't know what quick NON-INSTANT oats are (seems contradictory) so I used old fashioned oats. Batter needs thinning with plain milk, and I added chopped walnuts as I often do with pancakes.

These were good--my husband really liked them. But I found the batter a bit too runny.

Followed the recipe pretty closely, and these were fantastic! I assumed they would be on the dense, heavy side, but they were totally light and fluffy! I didn't have a Granny Smith, so I used a Fuji apple -- the apple flavor was quite subtle in mine, so I bet they'll be even better next time with a Granny Smith. I also used regular rolled oats, and couldn't imagine having ground them -- the texture was just perfect.

This pancake recipe was good but i wasn't wowed by it. I don't know if i liked the oatmeal in the pancakes.

Rating: 4
Excellent as written--my husband's new favorite!--except that the taste of baking soda is quite strong. Next time I'll try 1tsp baking powder and 1/4 or 1/2 tsp baking soda. I added a pinch of cloves and a bit extra cinnamon the second time I made it with good results.

Great pancakes. Used 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of the 2/3 grated apple. Hardly noticed the oatmeal in them.

These are nice and moist and tasty. Since I don't keep buttermilk on hand, I sour milk with vinegar and use that. Excellent with sauteed apples on top!

Rating: 3
Very tasty, and a great way to start to cook through the half bushel of apples I picked yesterday! Excellent hearty flavor, but I would've liked more apple taste, I think. Used a Courtland, I believe, and thought the grating and squeezing were important to getting the right texture. Used regular rolled oats without a problem. Very good, and easy to make from ingredients on hand.

i love how tender and fluffy these pancakes are! i made an organic version of this recipe and used yogurt and milk with lemon juice instead of buttermilk. also my whole wheat flour was no good so i used 3/4 C white instead of 1/2 and 1/2 whole wheat. i did not grind my oats and did not find that my pancakes were lumpy at all. my 3 year old daughter loved these!

Rating: 4
Great! Followed some of the modifications suggested - ground oats in blender, increased spices (I added 1/2 tsp cardamom and 1/4 tsp allspice). Since apples were a bit bland after juices gone (used Galas), added zest from 1/2 a tangerine - just enough to punch up the flavor. A definite keeper!

Simple recipe with good, subtle flavor. It's a nice alternative to plain or blueberry pancakes. I used skim milk soured by a teaspoon of lemon. I also used a Northern Spy apple and I squeezed out all of the juice. I didn't the extra step of grating and getting the juice out was a big deal--I think it was well worth it and only took an extra few minutes. The pancakes had a light and airy consistency.

These cakes are an excellent break from the ordinary. I followed the advice of an earlier reviewer and partially ground the regular rolled oats I had on hand. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. I think the Granny Smith apples are a key element, adding a nice tart, crispness.

This has become a staple in my household - everyone from my toddler to my sister who didn't like pancakes LOVE these. I use soy milk instead of buttermilk and all whole wheat flour. Granny Smith apples are a must.

Very good -- light delicious pancakes! I used an Empire apple (it wasn't juicy) and it worked fine. The buttermilk and oats make the pancake especially tasty and fluffy.

Rating: 3
Just made these and they were delicious. Here were the changes made after reading previous reviews: used soured milk (1 t. vinegar in milk as I had no buttermilk); all white flour, large flake oatmeal, less than half the cinnamon, and only butter (tastier than oil). My apple of choice for baking is Northern Spy which was not very wet when grated (only a couple tablespoons when squeezed through strainer)so I had no problems with too moist pancakes.

very hearty, but good. i used yogurt instead of buttermilk and only white flour. next time i'm going to try something to dry them out a little more, they came out a little too mushy in the middle.

This was wonderful and a nice change from our usual Sunday blueberry pancake ritual. Like the previous reviewer I also added a little vanilla and used white flour as I lacked whole wheat. Still excellent and great for autumn.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe at least 7 or 8 times in the last 2 years and everyone raves about it. I add vanilla for a little something extra. The recipe will work without wheat flour, but you loose the "rustic" taste. The MOST important piece of advice is to squeeze as much juice from the shreaded apple as possible. You pancakes will be wet and soggy in the middle if you dont get out all the juice.

Definitely awesome pancakes! We didn't have any quick oats, so I pulsed some regular oatmeal in the blender until I had 2/3 a cup of oatmeal that was powdery, yet still had some whole flakes in it. Also, I use 8T white whole wheat flour plus 4T. white AP flour. We didn't measure the apple, just grated it over the batter (the kids were hungry, and we had already waited for the oatmeal to soak!). My picky kids loved these healthy pancakes!! So did I!

these pancakes were good, i used only whole wheat flour and they were great. however they were not as soft as i was expecting, so i had to add more milk to achieve the right texture. also, squeezing the juice out of the apples reduced the flavour of the apples in the pancakes, so next time i am going to add the apples as is.

These were great, and my hose still smells wonderful. Changes I made were: Didn't read the directions right, so I used all the buttermilk in the beginning to soak the oatmeal. Used a lg granny smith, shredded by the Cuisinart (may havd been a scant more than 2/3 c. Used bread flour instesd of AP. Used 2 Tbls Extra Virgin Coconut Oil from Garden of Life (LOVE,LOVE,LOVE this stuff) in the batter, instead of veg oil, none on the griddle. It made 16 small pancakes, and we ate them all! Served them with organic maple syrup, which really made them extra-yummy!

Scrumptious pancakes which even my mom, who normally hates pancakes, liked. The apple-cinnamon mixture was very flavourful. I followed the recipe exactly.

We had trouble flipping the pancakes, they wanted to fold in half. They cook fast- watch out! I think there wasa bit too much cinnamon and the texture was a little odd.

Great pancakes. Didn't have all the ingredients on hand so we made the following changes and still produced some great pancakes. Instead of buttermilk, we used 1c Whole Milk with two tablespoons melted butter. We pureed the apples instead of grating them. Instead of whole wheat flour we used bread flour. These were simply delicious.

These were delicious! Hearty and fragrant with cinnamon. I used large flake oats, which gave them a real oat texture. I think they may be better with ground oats or smaller flakes.

Delicious! The recipe makes enough for three (two grown-ups and a toddler (who is quite the pancake eater)), but not quite enough for four.

These pancakes were yummy and didn't take very long to make at all. I used almost 2 grated braeburn apples, saving the juice to drink. It tasted like apple cider. I omitted the oil from the batter, didn't brush the griddle and cooked the pancakes on my nonstick griddle and they came out perfectly-no oil needed, didn't miss it. Serve with real maple syrup. Perfect! Also, the recipe says it serves 2 people (6 pancakes each) My husband and I were stuffed from 3 each and have leftovers for another day.

I rarely cook from recipes, but instead use them for inspiration for my own creations. Start with this recipe and try using pineapple and ginger, or bannanas and walnuts. My wife hates this recipe becuase her mother only made Aunt Jamammies. Her loss, more for me.

Lately I have been trying to add oatmeal to my diet, which is hard because I Hate oatmeal. This was very good. I love pancakes, I often eat them for dessert. This was and easy and tasty way to incorporate oatmeal into my diet. I didn't have apples so I used 1 cup of applesauce and it worked great. Try these you'll like them!

This was my first foray into making pancakes, and thanks to this recipe, it was a success! I like that these pancakes are heartier than usual, and I think the flavors work very well together.

I followed the recipe and the pancakes turned out wonderfully. Tasty & nutrious. Didn't need a lot of maple syrup. My husband loved them too. Next time, I may use butter in the pan (just a bit) instead and use the Blueberry Syrup or Peach and Berry Salad as a topping. Will be making these a lot in the future I am certain.

These pancakes are wonderful. I followed Bob H.'s suggestion and substituted 1 Tbsp of vinegar with whole milk instead of buttermilk. Also, I substituted self-rising flour for both the whole-wheat and the all-purpose flours, and omitted the salt and baking soda. These pancakes require a little extra time and effort, but are worth it!

Delicious, even for a husband who doesn't like oatmeal and hates "warm fruit." Also great microwaved the next day.

Yummy! I had to make a few substitutions: whole and white SPELT flour instead of wheat, SUCANAT instead of sugar and clabbered milk (milk plus a splash of vinegar) instead of buttermilk. Oh, and a BRAEBURN apple instead of Granny Smith. My whole family loved them. Do use real maple syrup instead of the usual artificially-flavored stuff. Toasted chopped nuts sprinkled on top would be great too.

Magnificent !!! We have made these pancakes several times and each time they were sensational. We added 1 tsp each of allspice and freshly grated nutmeg. To achieve the right consistency, add more milk. Enjoy !

These pancakes were more work to make than I liked. Although they do taste good I'm not sure that they were worth the effort. I would suggest trying them just for fun, but give yourself some time to grate the apples.

My wife and I made this recipe for the first time on the spur of the moment after my brother- and sister-in-law both stopped by unexpectedly. Everyone loved it! My brother-in-law said these were better than any pancakes he's had at a resturant. We didn't have buttermilk, so I added 1 tbsp. of vinegar to the milk instead; it was fine. One word of warning: consider doubling the recipe for three or more hungry people. We didn't quite have enough.

Talk about raves. My husband and I run a bed and breakfast and our guests have asked us for this recipe twice. And we've only made them twice. I would highly recommend this - no changes, just great the way they are.
