This is a favorite family recipe- we call it "cowboy steak". I generally use rib eye steaks rather than filet mignons- the big beefy flavor stands up to the robust spice rub. The spice mix is also delicious on baked potatoes.

Was browsing for future plans, but decided to throw this combination of spices into my hamburger. Very tasty!

I tried this and we loved it! I didn't have any chili powder so I made some from other spices in my cupboard (garlic, cumin, paprika, oregano & chili flakes). The other change I made was based on other reviews regarding the cooking time. I used this rub on aged top sirloin medallions which I cooked at 400 for 15 min. They were soooo good! Will definitely use this rub again on many cuts of beef!

I agree that using this on filets is not the best idea-I used thick chuck-eye steaks and the rub was definitely perfect for them. More rustic and fatty enough to soak up the rub. Sauce was good. Served this is roasted fingerlings and green beans with creamy tarragon sauce from Southern Living. Yum.

Made this for a mid-week dinner and it was fairly hassle free. I agree with some previous reviewers that the rub may be a little strong for this cut of meat, but it has a nice flavour and my fiance didn't find it quite as overpowering as I did. The sauce is nice on top, and I served it on a bed of wilted spinach which looked and tasted great under the steak. Will try again but maybe with some spice adjustments.

I really liked this recipe, but it was one of the rare occasions that my husband and I didn't agree. I liked the flavor of the rub and thought the sauce was delicious. My husband thought it was too salty (I actually used less than the recipe called for), and he said that the spices overwhelmed the great filet flavor. I think someone else thought that this was too much spice for a good cut of meat. My husband actually thought it would work well on a pork tenderloin.

I made this for my husband and I this past weekend. It was perfect! I would definatly make this again for company. Lots of flavor, not too overpowering, you still taste the delicious meat!

Very delicious recipe. Sooooo good. I'll definitely make this again and again. Don't miss the fact that the recipe is for 4 so if you're making for 2 you can halve the rub and sauce (there's more than enough.)

The spice rub was absolutely delicious. I really liked the roasting of the meat instead of broiling. I, too, would watch the cooking time as it can go from med rare to well done quite fast.

I had high expectations for this, but the recommended cooking time was my undoing. Twenty minutes at 500 degrees was WAY too long, and the steaks were barely pink. A waste of expensive meat...although the rub was delicious. I'll have to try this again, but with a MUCH shorter cooking time and more frequent attempts to check for doneness. I'm tempted to do this outdoors next time, although then I'd lack the drippings to complete the sauce, which was very tasty.

This is my favorite way to spice up filets! Delicious. Flavorful, but not too hot. Just right.

I would say this is one marvelous steak: EASY, FLAVORFUL and could make you a five-star chef in your own kitchen! I have made it twice and it came out great. The cooking method is the based for having a great result(time it carefully) but the spices too, is just that special sparks! For those who love an extra spice, this will give you just what you needed. Since it has quite a bit of spices, I served it with mild carbohyrat next to it. The first time, I served it with spaghetti mixed with cilantro and garlic. The second time, I served it with plain mashed potato. There were no leftovers from my fiance and me!

I actually made a version of this on the barbque with pork instead of beef...my family loved it!

Too much to do to filet mignons. This is more appropriate to dress a less expensive steak, like a sirloin. Soy sauce can be substituted for Worchesteire.

Agree completely with Heather from MN. Have made this twice- the first time used the entire rub, and it was too much. The next time, lightly coated the filets, and it was great.

I've made this dish a few times. This recipe really depends on how much rub you leave on the filets. It is not necessary to use all of the spice mixture, as it can be overwhelming and drown out the flavor of the meat. As with any filet recipe, the key to making it delicious is the right length of cooking.

A bit too much chili and cumin for my taste, but otherwise delicious. Next time I'm going to try decreasing the amount of chili and cutting out the cumin entirely (since chili powder already contains cumin), and perhaps adding other spices to the mix, such as rosemary or thyme.

I first tried this recipe on the grill and it was so-so. Then I followed the recipe, cooking the steaks in the oven and it was spectacular. My husband asks for this rub on everything now. (I did leave out the sugar.)

Just my taste but it was too spicy for me - filet didn't need that much help, kind of overwhelming. Maybe with different spices. I browned for 2 min/side then roasted at high heat for 10 min for med/rare - excellent way to cook it.

Thanks so much for this simple but delicious recipe. I got five filet mignons (hormone free) from the Prather Ranch in California (I got the them at Embarcadero Farmers' Market), and cooked them for my friends. They said it was teh best meal I ever cooked. I served them with the onions from the recipe "filet mignons in merlot sauce". The meal was accompanied by a bottle of Cabernet Savernigon.

WARNING! WARNING! The cook from San Francisco is incorrect. Chili powder does NOT mean cayenne pepper. Chili powder is chili powder, and is excellent in most rubs for the grill. This recipe calls for chili powder, not chile powder......very different.

A Tip: Be adventurous go into that spice rack - open the bottles - take a whiff - if you like what you smell add it to the processor and keep going to the next spice and the next. then add a little oil and a clove of garlic. Blend. I guarantee that whatever you added or in what quantity you will love the results - AND it will keep for a long time in the fridge.

We made it with american chile powder - why would you think they didn't mean what they say? We were set to do this in the oven and our electricity went out. We grilled it outside, and it was superb. And I didn't get to make the sauce. I will next time.

We loved this dish. Fifteen minutes in the oven was enough for midrare though. Very easy to prepare for such a flavorful recipe.

WARNING! WARNING! For non-American English speakers chile powder = cayenne pepper, not the blend of Mexican spices. A very different dish at the quantities in the recipe!

Excellent! Didn't find it as spicy as some of the others who reviewed it. Watch your time; 20 minutes at 500 degrees made our filets medium-well.

I just used the rub and grilled the filets over hot coals instead of the oven. Didn't make the sauce, and it was still incredibly delicious.

I thought the recipe was quite good. A little less chili powder next time and I think it will be perfect. I used good ol' Omaha Steaks, marinated it in the morning and cooked it at night with seasoned potatoes. The sauce was wonderful.

The combined spices for the spice rubbed filet mignon were excellent. The meat was an excellent cut and I rubbed the spices on in the morning and cooked it that evening. My husband really liked the sauce. Very Spicy! Thanks for a great recipe. I served it with fresh spinach mixed with garlic and lemon juice and some red potatoes.
