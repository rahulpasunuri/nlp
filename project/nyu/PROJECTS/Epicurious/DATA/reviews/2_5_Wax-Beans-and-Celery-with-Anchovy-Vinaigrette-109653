Way too fishy!

I scored some fresh wax beans at the farmers market and made this recipe and one other from this site. This one tasted like cooked carrots to me, but everyone else gobbled it up. I thought it was a little bland; maybe more garlic? Vinegar?

Everyone loved this dressing. I made it for some pole beans instead of the wax beans, I will make it again for our green salad. My husband abhors anchioves and enjoyed the dressing very much (he doesn't need to know about the ancioves!).

The anchovies really add a wonderful flavor to the beans. Quick and easy to make!
