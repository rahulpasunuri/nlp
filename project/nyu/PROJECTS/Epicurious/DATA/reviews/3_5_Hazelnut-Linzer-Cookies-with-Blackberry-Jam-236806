Incredible recipe. One bite, and the expression on the face of my Danish boyfriend was worth it all. I had a friend help me with the dough, I'm not good with any dough, and this one took some finesse, had to be cold to roll, yes. It worked fine, and they are absolutely delicious. Definitely my go-to Christmas cookie!

I brought back some ground hazelnuts from Italy and they needed to be used soon, so I found this fabulous Linzer Cookie recipe. I made them and took them to a party, where they were devoured. The hostess wanted the recipe. My husband said these were the best cookies I've ever made (and that's a lot of cookies!). I think the citrus peel makes a big difference in the yummy factor.

I have made these cookies for the past few years, as written and subsequently with changes. As written, it is a flawed recipe in my opinion. Firstly, the baking time is fully 10 minutes off! 12 minutes does it for me, regardless of any other changes to the recipe. Second, the addition of baking powder makes these cookies rise and spread to the point of obscuring any decorative center the cookie might have (I use a linzer cutter set with an angel, star, etc.). So I do not use baking powder, and I use granulated sugar instead of powdered to give the cookie more of a shortbread texture and crumb. I also omit the lemon peel and use ceylon cinnamon rather than cassia cinnamon. And finally I toast the hazelnuts. That done, this cookie is marvelous! The combination of orange, fresh nutmeg and toasted hazelnut is divine. Very subtle, almost floral and just really unique. I've used various jams and jellies to fill and it's always a hit. Definitely worth the effort of rolling the very crumbly dough :)

This is a very fickle but wonderful tasting cookie. I agree with the previous post - make sure that the dough is just about frozen before you start. Next time, I will also separate the dough in two batches so that it does not reach room temp - the dough is hard to handle after that. If you wish you could cut down on the zest but I found it paired very well with the blackbery jam. I also agree with learning curve - be patient. Overall I would make this again and recommend it to people who want to experiment with something a little different.

Addendum to previous post: I brought them to work, and people were very impressed. I forgot to mention that it did not make as many cookies as recipe said.

Wow! Do you have all day to kill in the kitchen? This was incredibly time- consuming with unsatisfactory results. The dough needs to be really, really cold or half frozen to make them come out without sticking and blobbing together in the cookie rings. And the flavor of the hazelnuts was overshadowed by all the zest. You couldn't really even taste the nuts. And of course, watch the cooking time. They burn fast. Give yourself a big learning curve with these. Next time I will try a linzer torte instead. That dough couldn't possibly be as fickle. This was harder than rugelach and not nearly as tasty.

labor intensive recipe but very worth it. This cookie is very sophisticated. I love the hint of citrus. I made them last year for chrismtas and plan to again this year.

I can understand if one cuts holes in both sides of a jam-filled cookie why they might be frustrated with the fallout. However, this dough is INCREDIBLY easy to work with and there wasn't a single person who ate this cookie who didn't rave about it

This recipe merits cancelling my subscription to Bon Appetite. These cookies were really time consuming and high maintenance and were not good. The cooking time is totally inaccurate as they are burnt after 15 minutes. The dough is hard to work with and the recipe is unclear as I cut holes in both side of the cookies which did not hold the jam. I highly recommend against this recipe. Don't waste your time and effort -- they are not good and the recipe is off.

Wath the cookies carefully while baking; at 18 minutes they were burnt. I can't imagine 22 minutes. I found 12 to 15 to be ideal.

great cookie! I didn't have any hazelnuts, so i replaced them with the same amount of ground almonds and seedless raspberry jam and they came out wonderful. Loved the added kick of the lemon and orange zest. Got rave reviews! Permanently added to the x-mas cookie list!

This is an excellent cookie. I have made this recipe twice and am including it in my Christmas Cookie file. There are only two changes I made. The first was to roast the Hazelnuts and remove as much of the skin as possible. Brings out the flavor of the cookies, also I use Currant jelly instead of Blackberry, although I did use some Rasberry the second time I made these cookies.
