Zaaz! Had nothin' in the fridge except a lemon and a half, capers and some condiments. ...OK, plus feta passed its prime, frozen chicken breast & waffles. Anyway, ran search on the meager and found this little gem. Added mustard. Beautiful. Austerity Perfection - 4 stars!!

Good recipe, I followed it as written and it was good. Next time I will flatten the chicken breasts a little and reduce the chicken cooking time accordingly. Great with mashed potatoes or polenta.

simple, flavorful, healthy recipe for a cut of chicken that so often tastes like cardboard. Added garlic cloves and dijon to vinaigrette per suggestions, but see no need for the added fuss and calories of breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese.

So good! Followed the reviewer's comments from July 2006, with a few of my own twists, as follows: made the vinaigrette with juice of 2 lemons, added 2 crushed cloves of garlic, 1 T of honey, S&P, then streamed in 3/4 c olive oil and whisked together. Keep at room temp. Lightly coat chicken (I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts) with a mixture of store-bought bread crumbs and some grated parmesan. Sauteed chicken in mixture of butter / olive oil for about 15 mins total (flipping chicken 1/2 way through cooking time), giving them a nice golden crust. Removed chicken to paper towels and added @ 2/3 C of the vinaigrette and the capers, and simmered till reduced a bit (2-3 mins). Added chicken back to pan, and re-warmed chicken for a few mins, turning twice to coat the chicken. Served with wild rice with feta and peas and some green beans. Oh my -- really, really good. Not as much work as it may sound.

Just made this tonight using what I had on hand. Added honey, garlic and coated the chicken in flour and parmesan cheese. Used white wine to deglaze the pan. It was delicious, moist, and tender. I will be making this again.

Quick and flavorful meal. Used a little white wine to make up for a lemon juice shortage; de-glazed the pan with wine and sauteed spinach with a little garlic. Nice as a side.

This was easy and yum. I added garlic, reduced the amount of olive oil and rinsed the capers - thanks to the other reviewers.

I rated this 4 forks because it is exceptional for a chicken dish. Whenever I make chicken my husband groans. This dish got yum yums from him and miracle of miracles, he ate the leftovers next day. I used a combination of skinless boneless breasts and ones with skin and bones. I browned them very well and added them back into the sauce to cook gently until ready to serve. This process makes for a very juicy, tender and flavorful dish that is easy to make for company.

Made this with all suggested changes (dijon, honey, garlic in the vinaigrette, coated chicken with parmesan cheese first, reduced sauce with vinaigrette as i had no white wine handy). Surprisingly delicious and very very easy.

Rating: 3
Great dish, especially with the modifications (+garlic/dijon/etc) and simplifications (pull chicken from the pan, reduce sauce, put chicken back in to warm) mentioned in the reviews. One note, though, be careful with how tart and salty it turns out. The capers are more than enough salt and it's easy to make this too tart. Definitely pair this with pasta/potatoes/bread to have a starch to balance that out as well.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I made my vinaigrette with juice 2 lemons & added enough lemon infused Olive oil to make 1 cup. I added 2 small crushed cloves of garlic & about 1 TBS of honey, S&P. I coated the chicken in freshly shredded parmesan cheese & some flour. After the chicken browned & sauteed for about 10 -11 minutes, I removed it & used white wine to deglaze the pan & collect the drippings. Then added the Lemon vinaigrette & capers & some green herbs. I cooked this a few minutes then added chicken back to rewarm & coat with the sauce. I served it with pasta & more fresh parmesan. The chicken was moist & flavorful. It was the parmesan coating. Everyone loved the sauce too. They want me to make more sauce next time to use on the pasta. I will definitely make it this way again.

Delicious meal. I would serve this to company. I took other reviewers advice and: coated chicken with flour. Also, added 1 pressed garlic clove, 1 TBSP honey, and 1 tsp dijon mustard to vinaigrette. Once I removed chicken from pan, I deglazed with the vinaigrette then added capers and chicken back to warm slightly. Served with angel hair pasta. My family loved it. I may try deglazing with 1/4 cpu white wine when I make this again.

I thought it was great! Made it for my very gourmet mother and she was impressed. I combined other reviewers ideas including the dijon, the garlic, coating the chicken in parmesean and deglazing the pan with white wine. Definitely rinse the capers and be careful with the salt. Was so quick and easy, great for during the week!

With several alterations, inlcuding those recommended other reviewers, this was fabulous. I did add the garlic and country dijon mustard. But, being concerned about runny sauce, I dredged chicken in seasoned flour, added the vingrtt to the pan to deglaze along with a pat of butter. I also put all of the capers in the pan, instead of into the vingrtt.

I made this last week and everyone loved it so much that I'm making it again tonight. (I've been craving it!) The dish was incredibly quick and easy to prepare and the chicken was delicious. I made the vinaigrette exactly as written and it tasted good, but when I took some of the suggestions from others here it then became great! I added a clove of crushed garlic, a little honey (maybe a tablespoon or two) and approximately a tablespoon of whole grain Dijon. Thank you everyone for contributing your wonderful suggestions!

This recipe was very simple and flavorful. It is one that I will make often. Capers are a favorite of mine so I liked it very much. The only thing I did differently was cook the chicken with lemon juice. The sauce was quite thin and so much of it wasn't necessary so to reduce the fat, I will cut down on the olive oil in the lemon vinaigrette and just drizzle the mixture over the chicken when it's ready to be served. I am actually making it tonight for the second time and I think I will use a bit of garlic like some other suggested.

Rating: 3
Very good - did add garlic. Sauteed chicken as directed. Removed from pan, added more evoo and 1/2 Tbsp butter, sauteed one crushed clove garlic briefly. Added lemon and capers. Placed chicken over sauce, covered and cooked on low for 5 minutes until chicken completely cooked.

I made this dish tonight and my husband liked it and said that he wanted me to make it again. To be perfectly honest, I was not really impressed. I think that the vinegrette was too thin and runny. I used real lemons in the vinegrette, and also accepted the advise of the other reviews and added minced garlic and 1 TBL. of dijon mustard. I also deglazed the skillet with white cooking wine. I rinsed the capers so the juice was not over powering. I forgot to sprinkle the chicken breasts with parmesan cheese but I think it would have been good. If I make it again then I will find a way to thinken the sauce. I think I prefer it that way.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe! A few changes though - For the vinaigrette I used the juice of one lemon and added lemon infused olive oil to make 1/2 c. To that I added about a tsp. of honey and some ground black pepper. Instead of tossing it in a bowl, I added the capers and the vinaigrette to the pan to simmer with the chicken and let it reduce for about 10 minutes. I served it with a side of couscous and it was delicious!

This is one of those recipes that make you think you'll never need to search again for something. It is the perfect Mediterranean chicken recipe that you could change up or pair with a variety of sides. I'll definitely keep it handy.

My 7 year old summed it up best, "Its REALLY lemony!" I took the reviewers' suggestions regarding mustard and garlic. I also deglazed the pan with white wine. The result was nice, but not awesome. I will make this again, but probably not for company.

This dish was lovely! I also heeded the previous reviewers and added mustard (part dijon/part whole grain) and instead of garlic, minced shallot. After I removed the chicken, I added the lemon mixture to the warm pan along with the capers and a few chopped fresh herbs and scraped up all of the drippings, which warmed the dressing slightly and added flavor. Delish!

Very Tasty! Tastes like chicken scaloppine. Quick and easy. One addition, I coated the chicken breasts with parmesan before putting them in the pan. Delicious and a beautiful golden brown color for a marvelous presentation along side some asparagus and a landing of angel hair.

This was so easy to make and very moist and tender. I used just regular olives and rinsed the capers to cut down on the saltiness. This dish is very lemony and flavorful, which I love.

Rating: 3
Use extra-light olive oil, as the extra virgin stuff smokes at far too low a temperature to be useful for cooking chicken. I marinated the chicken for a few hours in lemon juice and papper before cooking; I thought it was an improvement, YMMV. Adding garlic and mustard to the vinaigrette is a MUST. This was a very easy and quick one, with happy happy tasty results. Remove the spamtrap to email me.

I really liked this chicken. I took everyone's advice and added the mustard and garlic, which was great. I heated the sauce with the pan juices after the chicken was cooked, which was good. It was too lemony is my only complaint. I wish I had used less lemon juice or toned it down in the vinaigrette.

Rating: 3
I found this easy, flexible, and tasty as well, but am perplexed by the method a bit; simply mixing the chicken with the vinaigrette, and leaving all that fond in the pan, just seemed WRONG. (So I kinda did it anyway but then deglazed with wine and finished with that.) But still very good.

This is a keeper. Yes, added the garlic and the dijon, and served with couscous and steamed broccoli. My husband didn't pause to comment, just devoured it in record time. Quick and good.

I cooked this dish for a midweek meal and my husband was raving about it! I used 4 tbsp. of light olive oil, 2 tbsp of fresh lemon juice, 1/2 tsp of dijon mustard, 1 clove of crushed garlic and salt and pepper for the vinaigrette, and I also added the capers to it. I coated the chicken with salt, pepper and parmesan cheese before frying and it made a big difference! It was delicious, and something that will be cooked frequently in our household!

This is a fantastic easy, quick dish. I took ideas from the other reviewers and made the chicken with mustard and parmigiano-reggiano cheese (dredge chicken then saute). It was a hot August day so I served over a bed of lettuce that i had cut to bite-size and added chow mein noodles for texture and crunch then drizzled more of the lemon vinaigrette over it and added more grated cheese. My boyfriend and I love this and have it almost weekly now.

Great! I added 1 pressed clove of garlic and a tablespoon of Dijon mustard to the caper sauce. I also finely grated Asiago cheese and coated the chicken with it before I sauteed it. Made it even better! Served it with a side of steamed veggies and it made an easy, wonderful dinner!

I made this recipe 3-4 times within 2 weeks. My husband raves about it everytime. We tried it with salmon most recently. I used a small amount of the vinaigrette to get the juices from the glass broil dish and mixed it with the remaining vinaigrette and capers. Our favorite so far!!!

This was very simple and quick to make. I made only a small amount of the lemon vinegarette for the amount of chicken used and it turned out great. I did add garlic to the vinegarette. Will make this again.

I made this recipe in the past, but wasn't too thrilled. However, I was craving capers and happened to have chicken on hand, so I adapted this recipe with a few changes based on the advice of several revewiers. I breaded the chicken with some herbs and combined the capers with the vinaigrette in which I added a tablespoon of dijon mustard. It was delicious- a nice twist on cooking chicken.

I followed the recipe as-is, and it was great! I used fresh lemons and think that helped it turn out well. It took only about 15-20 mins from start to finish, but it's so much nicer than other weeknight dinners that take so little time.

YUM! YUM! YUM! YUM! This was about as easy as it gets, and SO YUMMY!!! Word of advice: rinse the capers before you put them in. They're pretty salty. I served this with rice & steamed green beans, and drizzled some of the extra lemon vinaigrette on the veggies. That vinaigrette can be used on just about anything. YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS!!!!

Great, easy supper. I deglazed the pan first with a little white wine, then I reduced a little stock in the pan and heated the capers in the resulting glaze. Gave the sauce wonderful body. I added a little white wine to the vinaigrette, as well.

I followed the advice of previous reviewers and added a little dry white wine and two crushed cloves of garlic to the lemon vinaigrette. I also dredged the skinless chicken breasts in a little bit of flour in addition to crushed black pepper and kosher salt. A delicious summer dish that's easy to make. Nice with a glass of chardonnay or pinot grigio.

Liked it well enough, but the boys liked it plenty! Our drink of choice is lemonade, so this was a natural for us. I added about a teaspoon of chopped lemon zest to the marinade (I made it into a marinade for about ten minutes before searing the chicken) and then scraped the stuff off and let the chicken simmer nicely. I also added chopped garlic and two tablespoons dry white wine. Served it over noodles and watched all three boys (5, 3 , 1) chow down. This is an easy make again recipe.

This dish got RAVES! Even my persnickety 10-year-old loved it. I took the advice of another cook and added a little Dijon mustard and a couple cloves of fresh garlic. I also added a splash of Chardonnay, wisked it together and let it sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes while I prepared the chicken and pasta. I cut the chicken into large chunks, stirred it and the capers into the marinade, and them sit for a couple of minutes before pouring all of it over the linguine. Faaaaabulous!

I made this recipe for myself, with fresh lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil. It was easy to make and the chicken breast was crisp on the outside and tender inside. You must like tart flavors in order to enjoy this, although you could cut down on the lemon juice and capers to make it less tart. A keeper.
