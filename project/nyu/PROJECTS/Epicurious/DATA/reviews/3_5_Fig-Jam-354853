This jam is very good, but wouldn't make again. The recipe for drunken fig jam on this website is SO much easier and every bit as good.

Not able to locate any Argan Oil in Sonoma County California. Is taking much longer than 25 minutes to reduce as in 4+ times longer. Smells very good. Making with balsamic vinegar and omitting sherry, am a non alcohol drinker. Yes, i will make it again when figs are in season and i have the Argon oil to use.

The recipe reads more like a chutney than a jam.

I really liked this recipe, but as others indicated I made some changes. I eliminated the sugar and reduced the brown sugar to half. Changed the RWV to Balsamic and added more garlic. I will make it again as it is a lovely spread and matches nicely with some cheese. I will most likely play with the amount and variety of sugar so it isn't so sweet and then I think it will marry more nicely with cheese. I think this would have been terribly sweet had I used all the sugar. I also used only black figs in my recipe.

Great recipe--I used all white figs and since I didn't have argan oil on hand, added a couple drops of sesame oil. Spain´s fig season is short but intense--will definitely make more while they´re abundant!

As it stands, I probably would have given this two forks. But after making it additionally, I made some changes, put it back on to cook, and love it. I removed the cinnamon stick about 10 minutes into the cooking process because I just didn't like the smell. The second time I cooked it, I added some aged balsamic vinegar, which gave it the punch I was looking for and made it a great accompaniment for cheese. I served it with some aged mahon cheese, and it got rave reviews from everyone.

I made it twice, the second time with the argan oil which, I admit, I was reluctant to buy at first because of price and uncertainty whether it would make a difference. I see that some others substituted too. I'm so glad I purchased argan -- (I bought Alili brand). The oil has a nutty flavour, almost like a walnut; unique, completely different than regular vegetable oil. I use it almost every day now, over my salads, so it's getting used up pretty quickly, and it gave this recipe the intrigue that was missing the first time I made it. Hope my comment helps.

I have made the jam three times, the last two times I have added red onion which I think compliments the flavors. I have used the jam on crackers with goat cheese, on pork tenderloin, have rolled it up (again with goat cheese)in chicken breasts cooked in a crock pot and added it to soume soups. So the jam is becoming a kitchen staple.

I am still experimenting with this recipe (until the end of fig season). Despite the garlic, shallot and vinegar, it tastes a bit too much like plain old fig jam. Still, my husband adores it on Greek yogurt. I want to make it a better cheese accompaniment.

Delicious chutney (not a jam, technically). I substituted a dry red wine for the Sherry. One suggestion: If using 2 1/2 cups of water, you must reduce for well over an hour and add a lemon to can this product for storage.

This came out great and has amazing flavor! I didn't have the oil, nor did I use a substitute and it was fine. I also opted not to use the lemon at the end ~ only because I didn't have any on hand. I'm sure it would be a great addition. One note: twenty five minutes is no where near enough time to simmer this down. Keep a nice even simmer and cook until it gets kind of thick and goopy. As it cools it will get a bit thicker so be careful not to go to far. It cooks down to a fairly small amount, but package in small jars ~ a little bit goes a long way.

I included everything required in this recipe except the argan oil. Hopefully, that is the key ingredient because this was a big disappointment. It is very runny and I used a 2 lbs of figs thinking that this would be something I would devour with goat cheese as an appetizer. NOT. It is sitting in my refrigerator and there is little to no interest in it. I will continue to search for a fig jam recipe that tastes better.
