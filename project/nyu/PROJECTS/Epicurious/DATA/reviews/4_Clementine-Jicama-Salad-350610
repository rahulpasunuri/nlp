I thought the recipe was spot on...the NEXT day! I made this about an hour before I served it. It was good, but the dressing was a bit lost in the whole thing. Well to my surprise the next day this salad went from good to great! The jicama had time to absorb the flavors and the vinaigrette just jumped out in assertiveness! I would recommend making this 24 hours before serving.

I followed the advice of other reviews to add pomegranate seeds and avocado. I diced pink lady apples and tossed it with a bag of mâché. You could half the dressing; it made way more than you'll need!

This is so simple, so easy and so fresh tasting. I served it with pulled port tacos and it was the perfect foil to the pork. Just used regular oranges and it was fab.

I brought this to a potluck and everyone loved it. I substituted the cheese for goat cheese, since I can't eat cow's milk, and it was perfect.

I first made this delicious recipe on Thanksgiving as it was refreshing to the palate with all the traditional heavy foods. I now am living somewhere that it is difficult to find Jicama so I substituted that with Granny Smith Apples and LOVED LOVED LOVED it even more than with the Jicama and I really adore Jicama. I just used this recipe for a luncheon side dish and the girls loved it. Enjoy!

So unusual. So good. Served as a first course to blackened halibut with roasted corn guacamole. Delish!

I didn't have fresh cilantro, but added dried cilantro (coriander) to the dressing for the flavor, and served over a small amount of chopped romaine. Then I got the idea to use up the pomegranate seeds I had, so I sprinkled about 2 tablespoons over each salad. Wow! They added additional texture, made the flavors more complex, ramped up the antioxident quotient, and made the presentation even more gorgeous.

Great starter for the beer marinated flank steak, aji sauce and columbian guacamole (also from this site). The crunchiness of the jicama, the nuttiness of the pepitas and the sweetness of the clementines are wonderful together. Big hit all around.

I made this exactly according to the recipe, and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved the variety of flavors and textures, and appreciated the change of pace from your standard mixed greens/lettuce salad. It was a great accompaniment to the Mexican lasagna that my mom prepared as the main course.

Used blood oranges instead of clementines because that's what the supermarket had in stock. Beautiful and delicious

I love this recipe and have made it many times now. I serve over a bed of watercress, tossing the greens with the lime, olive oil and salt (I don't actually make the dressing and omit the garlic) then scatter the other ingredients over top and drizzle more lime, olive oil and sea salt over everything. It looks gorgeous and I always get rave reviews.

Beautiful and delicious salad. I made this according to the recipe with the addition of mixed greens to create more servings. I thought the cilantro was a fantastic element, and the salad was a crowd pleaser. Will make this regularly when clementines are available.

This salad is delicious and refreshing. I left out the cilantro since my husband is not a fan, but I didn't miss it.

A perfect summer salad. Very light and refreshing. I used unsalted pistachio nuts instead of the pumpkin seeds, and it turned out delish. I might add some avocado next time.

Incredible. Fresh, light tasting. Jicama is a wonderful thing - I've never even had it before, but it was lovely. The lime juice really made this recipe. Will definitely, definitely make this again.

Lovely! Just made this for the second time for Christmas dinner. I did not use the cheese but otherwise followed the recipe - except that I used only about 1/2 cup cilantro and I chopped it. It has a beautiful presentation and a wonderful combination of flavors. It was a hit again this year. I'm not sure how the one reviewer made it without the jicama - it's kind of fundamental to the recipe.

Fabulous! I omitted the garlic (for we are not wild about raw garlic, and there was plenty of garlic in other dishes we were serving). I also cut back the red onion to about 1/3 of an onion - I wanted to keep the flavors fresh and bright. Served on bed of mixed greens it was an absolute hit! The small amount that was left over was still yummy the next day.

I'm not a big fan of fruit in my salad, but this salad is just fresh and perfect. I used all ingredients except for jimca. Very yummy. Will make again.

Nice one..happened to have most ingredients on hand after buying the jicama. Skipped the onion and added avocado. My 9 year old loved it!

Great recipe. Super summery and bright and delicious. I made the dressing exactly as the recipe said the night before, and it was great. I didn't use the cilantro or feta (but they'd probably be good, I just didn't have them) and put everything over a tray of butter lettuce. it looks beautiful.

Excellent super-easy interesting refreshing salad!

One more thing: if you are one who, like me, avoids salads containing fruit (because why would you want something sweet overwhelming what should be a savory dish?), take a chance on this one. The clementine adds brightness and acidity, and not too much sweetness, especially combined with the feta, onion, and tart dressing. You won't be disappointed!

Loved this. Made the dressing a few days ahead, and left out the garlic as there was much other garlic on the menu; it was delicious without it. It was pointed out to me that the salad did need more greens, as most people didn't eat the cilantro leaves as the "green" part of the dish; this turned out to be true, as most plates came back with the cilantro almost untouched. Added a bed of bib lettuce leaves the next time, which everyone devoured. A perfect, fresh, and refreshing course as part of a multi-course, wintry dinner!

I made this salad for Thanksgiving. I also thought it might need more greens for my families' taste,so I served it on a bed of green leaf and romaine lettuces. I made the dressing a few hours in advance as the recipe stated, and took it with us to my dad's house. Dinner was later than planned and the dressing held up well. Put it together at the last minute, it was great! My family thought it was really refreshing and I had a lot of rave reviews on my salad selection. I had a lot of requests for the recipe. Thanks Gourmet!

Yummy! A wonderful way to have bright fresh tasting food in the middle of winter. A perfect foil to a heavy meal. I had to substitiute sheeps milk feta, but I leeched it in water for 2 days and it worked really well in this salad. The amount of greens was perfect for us.

A good friend made this for a dinner party. We both agreed that it needed more greens. I noticed that everyone ate their entire portion and we discussed how interesting the textures and flavors were. Only reason for 3 out 4 forks is that it needed some additional greens.

Delicious! I used about half of the olive oil called for in the recipe.
