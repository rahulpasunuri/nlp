I steam cooked the sweet potato (to retain vitamins) used a Fuji apple, and yellow cornmeal. I baked it in a greased, deep dish pie plate. It was good, but too much work, too many dishes. It's very fluffy, unsubstantial, souffle-like. I pan fried slices of the leftovers in olive oil; that was better. The only way I'd make this again is if somebody else was making the rest of the dinner.

This came out really fluffy with a nice crust. I don't have a cast iron pot so I made it in a regular metal cake pan and it was fine.

This was pretty good: subtle flavor, fluffy texture. I posted a photo of this on my blog, if you want to check it out (it's sometimes easier for me to make a recipe if I have a photo). http://www.feedyourkids.com/2006/11/herb_roasted_pork_tenderloin_w_1.html

Tasty enough, and my toddlers (strickly white rice types) actually ate a fair amount. But it didn't taste enough of sweet potatoes and apples, so wound up like eggy cornbread for a fair amount of effort.

I got mixed reviews. I had higher expectations of the spoon bread. I enjoy an almost pudding texture but found it was gritty and dry.

We made this for Thanksgiving and really liked it, even my husband who is not a spoon bread kind of guy. I didn't bake it in a skillet but rather scooped it into a thick walled casserole dish for baking and serving. Worked fine.
