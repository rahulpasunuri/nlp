This was a huge hit a recent dinner party. I strained the undissolved pieces of ginger from the cream mixture to obtain a smooth texture. I also substituted ginger snap cookies for the crust as other readers had suggested.

I have made this a few times now and it is always a BIG hit. I have used both shortbread crusts and gingersnap crusts, both delicious but different. The gingersnap enhances the ginger flavor in the tart for those like me who LOVE ginger. I also substituted mascarpone for the sour cream once when I discovered I had none and it too was very delicious. I like to use Fran's raspberry sauce as an accompaniment to fresh berries when I want a very intense raspberry flavor with the tart. I am always asked for this recipe when I make it. This is an outstanding dessert for meals of asian food. I first found the recipe in Gourmet magazine in a complete asian dinner recipe collection. Just wonderful.

This is a wonderful, very easy, very light, very tasty dessert. Any fruit can be substituted for the raspberries.

I made this for a dinner party and the tart pan was wiped clean. I chose to also use gingersnaps for the crust... I will make next time with shortbread just to see the difference. So good and very simple!

terrific -- not hard at all and a good crowd-pleaser. I would add more crystallized ginger next time; I pulsed it in a food processor with the sugar and the resulting flavor was delicate and subtle, but my guests and I actually love ginger so I think we'd prefer a stronger flavor next time. also used gingersnaps for the crust and they worked great.

A friend made this for a dinner party she hosted, and it was delicious, so I asked for the recipe. I made it 2 days later, and found that it's also quite easy to make. Angd nice to be able to prepare a day ahead.

I made this Saturday for friends and every piece was gone. My son and a friend devoured the leftovers the next day. (I had no problem with the berries looking goopy.) I also used gingersnaps in the crust and chopped the ginger with the sugar in the food processor. I had extra crumbs left over, so I sprinkled some on top. Overall, the presentation was terrific, it was easy, it had to be done in advance (well, in the morning), it was light and refreshing. Hard not to like!

I gave this recipe 2 forks because I thought it was solid and good... but it definitely didn't blow me away. It's certainly easy-breezy to put together, and perfect for summer because of the limited amount of baking. I would make this again, but only to bring it somewhere, since it would be easy to transport and seems to be a crowd pleaser. If you are looking for something impressive to serve to company, keep looking.

This was amazing. My husband said that there was nothing about the title of this recipe that would intrigue him enough to make it. But we were surprized. Made exactly as in the recipe and we all thought it was heavenly.

Beautifully creamy - I minced the crystallized ginger and it gave the entire tart a bite - raspberries weren't in season so I used kiwi fruit - complimented the ginger and sweetness of the tart beautifully

I made this for a gourmet camping trip. It is a lovely, some what delicate flavors. It is a bit of work so I would only do it when I was going to cooking for hours anyway.

Wow! Especially for those who enjoy ginger, this dessert is a delight. While I wasn't so excited about a shortbread crust, I happened across Walker's stem ginger shortbread in the market...and I'm really glad I used those for the crust. The crust ended up being the perfect complement to the filling: buttery with a touch of ginger. The filling was also delicious: light yet creamy, with a ginger flavor that was present without being overpowering. I also pulverized the crystallized ginger in the processor...and to add a bit more zing, added just a little bit of freshly grated ginger. Topped with fresh raspberries, this tart was delicious. Highly recommended.

I really liked this recipe. I made a shortbread crust from scratch instead of using store bought cookies. The filling had a light ginger flavor that went well with the buttery shortbread and fresh berries. I used rasperries and blackberries. I followed the suggestion of previous reviewers and pulsed the ginger with the sugar in the food processor. Although I really liked this and my husband seemed to like it, and we are dessert snobs to some extent, we brought this to a party and it just didn't get rave reviews. I think it looked somewhat like a cheesecake filling and people expected something richer, but I really liked the lightness of it.

This came out absolutely marvellous. It was extremely simple to make, as well as inexpensive. My only modifications were to use pecan shortbread cookies and to run the ginger through a food processor to create an intense (but not overpowering) ginger flavor.

This had a great crust and the filling was delicious. I wasn't as into the little chewy bits of ginger (I don't like tapioca or jello with fruit in it either); next time I'll probably strain it out.

I have made this MANY times over the years and it's always a hit. It is a family favorite and always requested for family gatherings. I finely grind the ginger with the sugar in the food processor for a smoother texture and more even ginger flavor throughout the filling. I recently made this for an afternoon wedding reception and used the mini shortbread tart shells from Sur la Table and garnished each with raspberries and a small mint leaf. Easy, beautiful and delicious.

This was a delicious dessert! I didn't have crystallized ginger on hand but subsituted a fresh ginger candy that I purchased a the farmer's market and reduced sugar somewhat. Worked spectacularly. Friends raved about the dessert!! This is definitely a new favorite.

Really easy and amazing dessert. I used half the puff pastry called for and almost all the ginger cream...I used mixed fruit, berries, kiwi, peaches. Took it to a party. Everyone loved it and asked for the receipe. It looks like something you spent all day on, but really only took maybe 30 minutes of work plus cooking time. I'll definitely be making this again.

From a true chocoholic, I was pleasantly surprised when I made this for a friend. It is very unique and a great change of pace from traditional heavy deserts. I used ginersnaps for the crust and fresh raspberries on the side. This allows the guest to add as many raspberries as they like and prevents the tart from looking yucky the next day.

I made this for my boss one night when she was having people over. A very pleasant surprise, everyone loved it. The crust was delicious and cooked evenly, the filling was very tasty and the tart came out of the pan flawlessly. I topped the enitre tart with fresh raspberries before serving and the presentation was fab.

Agree with reviewers. Very subtle ginger taste. Very mild, but nice and refreshing. Nice acompaniment to a strong flavor dinner. I had it at a dinner party and everyone like it. EAsy to do. Next though I would make crust with the triple threat Ginger cookies you can get at Trader Joes to have a more Ginger taste - if you like ginger

A beautiful dessert. The flavor is subtle, but pleasant. This is a rich dessert--a little goes a long way!

A big success at my large dinner party. A nice flavor to finish of a large meal. Great with any fruit. I like the remaining small pieces of ginger which adds some tooth to the dish that works with the crunchyness of the crust and the sublime smoothness of the cream.

I've been meaning to post a review for a while. I've made this tart several times now and always to rave reviews. I love ginger, so I use gingersnaps instead of shortbread for the crust.

I followed the suggestion of making mini-tarts and had a total disaster. The tarts completely fell apart when I took them out of the pan -- an unsalvageable disaster. But we whipped up an emergency batch of shortcakes, and served those with the ginger cream and rasperries -- delicious.

This was very good, but I wasn't expecting the cheesecake-like flavor and texture. I used creme fraiche instead of sour cream, so maybe that had something to do with it. I think I will try it with sour cream next time. Otherwise, the ginger flavor made for a nice finish to our Asian meal.

I've tried several fruit tart recipes and this is my favorite. The crust is simple to make and delicious. The ginger cream is a wonderful accompaniment to all kinds of fruit. I agree with everyone else about pulverizing the ginger more the next time. I did glaze the top of the tart with a Grand Marnier apricot glaze which finished the tart off beautifully.

I MADE A PATE BRISEE INSTEAD OF THE COOKIE CRUMB CRUST. IT WAS TERRIFIC.

This was a HUGE hit when I served it at a dinner party. Beautiful peaches were on sale at the market, so I substituted them for the raspberries and the tastes went together beautifully. I also followed an earlier suggestion and substituted creme fraiche for the sour cream. One of my guests is a caterer, and she requested the recipe. I also had some ginger cream left after I filled the tart shell, and I just poured it into wine glasses and ate it later in the week. This is a great adult style dessert.

I made this recipe for a buffet, so I made little mini-tarts using a mini-muffin pan. They were perfect finger desserts and were a total hit. I used ginger puree from William-Sonoma with a little additional chopped crystallized ginger. I had some of the cream left over after filling all the tart shells, so I put it in my ice-cream maker - it made delicious ice-cream.

We loved this recipe! Next time I would definitely chop the ginger more finely and maybe even reduce the amount; it was a little too strong for me. I served this with a raspberry coulis, fresh raspberries and sliced kiwi. Delicious!

Made this for a house party with twenty five adults grazing their way through food that we all brought. It was a big hit, and righteously so. Easy to prepare, silky in texture, and subtle in flavour. I pulverised the crystallized ginger, so it dissolved completely into the cream sauce, then sprinkled the top of the tart with raspberries and chopped ginger. Definitely worth trying again. The idea of substituting creme fraiche for sour cream is an intriguing one.

My guests went crazy over this! On a table spread with at least 10 cakes, this was the first to go, and became the talk of the party. Even though I didn't love it myself, the responses convinced me: I will make this again. (used kiwis instead of berries).

To the cook in Richmond : I get crystallized ginger at Harris Teeter, Food Lion, or even Wall Mart in the produce section. It is sold in 3-oz. packages, along with dried mushrooms, dried fruit, etc. One brand is Frieda's.

You can find crystallized ginger at specialty or gourmet food stores. I'm not sure about grocery stores; I've never looked there. I know that Williams-Sonoma sells it.

a very delicious and easy tart. I topped with with blackberries and rasberries. I sub-ed creme fraiche for sour cream, which gave the creme a more complex flavor that was too delicious to describe.

I have made this twice for small dinner parties and my guests LOVED it. Berries are not in season here, so I covered the tart with thin slices of kiwi and it was attractive as well as yummy! Ginger combines well with any tropical fruit so I will try it with mango and pineapple in the future. It was a nice cool ending to the spicy Thai meal I served for dinner.

Delicious!! I used packaged pie crust (Pillsbury) and it was still wonderful. The filling has a silky, subtle taste, rich and good. Next time I will grind the ginger instead of chop. Just a thought, perhaps the filling could also be molded and served with berried in syrup poured over - hmmm... sounds pretty good!

Very light. Perfect for a summer evening on the deck with friends.

This dessert is wonderful and looks impressive too. It's very light and the ginger is subtle. I would disagree with a previous review that you must love ginger; my guests thoroughly enjoyed it and couldn't identify the mystery ingredient of crystallized ginger. Crust was great too. I made it for an evening barbeque, but seems more appropriate to serve with a tea, brunch or light dinner.

Wonderful flavors, smooth , silky and best of all , easy. I added a little powdered ginger to the crust as I adore ginger. Very impressive! Also cheated and used fat free sour cream to save a few calories!
