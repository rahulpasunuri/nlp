Very tasty. I love this on JJ Flats flat breads. I think I will try adding a bit of truffle oil to this mixture next time I make it. I used finely ground fleur de sel salt. I also used a small clove of garlic, grated finely. I didn't want to overpower the porcini. I would make this again. A keeper.
