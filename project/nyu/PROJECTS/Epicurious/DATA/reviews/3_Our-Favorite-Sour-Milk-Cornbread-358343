Didn't like this at all. The eggs rose to the top of the cornbread and made an eggy surface, not a browned crispy top, like I was hoping for. won't be making this again. At least its not for guests - just for us to have with chili.

I baked this version, as well as a sweet version, for a fundraising event. Received rave reviews on both types of cornbread. It is the best "non-sweet" cornbread recipe I have found after years of searching for this type. If your preference is a sweet style, this is not the one for you. If you like the "Williamsburg" style, this is absolutely the best!

Soooo goood! and a wonderful use of sour milk. I tend to go a bit heavy on the butter, and like using salted or adding a tad more salt. It may seem runny while you are making it, but don't correct it, this will make a moist and wonderful addition to your meal. Ummmmm....

I prefer a sweet cornbread. This reminded me of hush puppy batter.

I did not like this cornbread. I used regular baking powder and you could taste it. I would recommend making the homemade powder as instructed. I also prefer a sweetened cornbread so this recipe was just not for me.

This cornbread was simply amazing. It reminded me of momma's cooking the way it just melt in my mouth. I only wish I had made some chili to go along with it.
