I've done this recipe multiple times and it's great. The more impurities you can skim off (scumming) the honey as it boils, the better tasting it will be. I also prepared a half-sheet pan and parchment paper with cooking spray (both sides of the paper) to receive the hot candy. I measured the spices in the palm of my hand - and used the multi-pepper grinder for the pepper. I think I also added allspice and nutmeg. I didn't use the lemon, it's unnecessary. By the time the candy is spread out on the pan, with either a spoon or spatula, and I dipped my hand in cool water each time I touched the candy, it was still hot, but it did not burn me. Let the candy cool, and if it's still a little gooey, cut it into 1" (one inch) squares. Cool them off the rest of the way in the refrigerator and store them in a cool dry place... if they last that long! VIVAT!

You don't necessarily have to cook it to hard ball stage, as it can be a bit gooier of you choose. I spread it onto my silpat sheets with a silicone spatula (no lemon or parchment paper) and let it cool.

A wonderful dessert. Its easier to maneuver and cut when its been cold. It reminds me of peanut brittle... :)

(2 1/4 pounds nuts = about 6 cups) This was easy enough. Spread out on very lightly oiled aluminum foil and it was easy to peel off. Note, the honey is boiled until you get it to hard crack stage (standard for nut brittles), which if you are using a candy thermometer is between 300 to 310 degrees... and it does require constant stirring.

It was served to rave reviews! I wonder, though, if I couldn't make it on edible rice paper instead of parchment? Like the white nougat in those little boxes.

Easy to make. People loved it. I actually added more spices and replaced cloves by cardamom. It doesn't stick if you use the non stick aluminum foils

It was pretty easy to make (although I'd suggest using half the recipe or even less - I made about a sixth). But it stuck to the parchment paper, which was annoying, and tasted only okay.
