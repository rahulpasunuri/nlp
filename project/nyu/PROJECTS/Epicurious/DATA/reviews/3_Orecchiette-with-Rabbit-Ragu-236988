This was my first time with rabbit. I was unsure how to cook it, let alone cut it, but this recipe alleviated my fears and delivered a tender and flavorful dish. Cutting was easier than expected. You can find a video on Youtube. I didn't have everything listed, but the substitutes were minor. I used an off dry Spatlese for the white wine. Instead of canned tomatoes, I used 6 fresh ripe average sized tomatoes, ~28oz by weight. Right before adding the veggies, I added 2 tablespoons of duck fat instead of oil. It took some time, but it was well worth it. The pasta tasted good by itself, and contributed to the flavor of the dish. Also very good as leftovers. I paired the dish with a sparkling rose from Perrrier Jouet.

Rabbit is $8.99/pound; chicken a fraction of that & they pretty much taste the same. Recipe came together fine, but when there is so much great food to make, I wouldn't bother with rabbit again.
