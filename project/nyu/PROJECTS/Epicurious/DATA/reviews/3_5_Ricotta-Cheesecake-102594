Very light texture, not too sweet, and overall good but did not blow me away. I have had better ricotta cheesecakes. I may have over baked mine because the top and sides had a very slight bitter burnt taste (though did not look burned, just browned). I agree with others that it probably bakes faster than an hour so you need to keep an eye on it. I also used ricotta from the plastic tubs, so it was probably worth the effort to buy fresh but I couldn't find it. I thought the zest added the perfect amount of flavor to bring out the buttery crust and light ricotta flavor. I didn't do this but next time will follow suggestions to double the crust, which I loved. Lots of work-- I would say don't bother with average ricotta but based on other reviews, it sounds worth it with fresh!

I have made this cheesecake without the citrus zest. It's very light and yummy! Definitely used a food processor for the ricotta. My husband doesn't eat dessert, but loves this cheesecake!

I just made this cheesecake. Its a lot of work but... its worth it. I made with store bought at the italian deli Poly -O riccotta in a plastic container. I added following 1/3 cup cointreau, 1 tbsp freshlemon juice to filling and used 26cm pan. & put ricotta in processor. made fresh strawberry coulis, it was fab. note if using convection drop the temp down to 350 and if using 26cm pan double the crust. it was very yummy and would definitely make again.

Super light and fluffy. Definitely process the cheese in a food processor (rather than pressing it through sieve). Also added fresh vanilla bean to the sugar/egg mixture and made w/ the homemade ricotta from this site (used vinegar rather than lemon, turned out perfect). Doubled the lemon zest.

Good cheese is critical! I made this with fresh sheep's milk ricotta purchased at a farm in VT. I made the recipe as written, just put the drained cheese in the food processor as another reviewer suggested. The cake was amazing...just as I was hoping. I was hoping to duplicate a cake we used to love in a local Italian restauant. A wonderfully light, lemony but not too sweet dessert.

This was a good Italian style cheesecake and very versatile. 1 tsp vanilla helped the flavor of the filling and I made it with an almond crust. I also topped with fresh strawberries.

Another note, this cooked much faster than the recipe called for, the crust in about 15 minutes and the cake in about 50. Keep an eye on it.

This was disappointing mainly because it had a bland flavor. I even made fresh homemade ricotta from the recipe found on this site. We really liked the consistancy, however, and how light it was compared to regular cheesecake. I will make it again, give it another chance, using more more citrus flavor, pehaps adding some almond extract and rum extract, as another recipe I have uses.

I made this for the first time and it was amazing, I work in a gelatto shop in town and my boss is new to the US and is from Milan and she LOVED it, I am actually making it again this week for Thanksgiving desert.

This was my first cheesecake ever, and what a way to go! Originally, I used heavy whipping cream and it was divine. Either way, it is great. It does help to use fresh ricotta. My twist on this is to make a crust made from Trader Joe's triple ginger cookies. The taste is fabulous with the lemon zest. I have many converts with this recipe, and I now like this so much better than the NY cheesecake.

Put this already outstanding cake OVER THE TOP by using homemade ricotta (see the recipe on this site... SO easy and literally 5 minutes active time!) Top with fresh fruit and glaze (boiled apple jelly, brush on and chill) for a spectacular presentaiton, or simply with berries and berry coulis. This is also excellent baked in souffle dishes, topped with berries and eaten with a spoon for a reduced calorie treat.

This is an outstanding cake, rustic in appearance and delicate in texture. I soak a handful of yellow raisins in rum for 24 hours and add them to the batter. They burst in your mouth with each bite. It's probably one of the better cheesecakes you will ever eat.

This recipe was a major disappointment. The flavor was bland and flat. I followed directions and suggestions exactly but I wasn't happy with the end result.

This was wonderful! I did, however, use a different recipe for the crust (1 cup crushed biscotti, 1 cup of crushed graham crackers, and 5 oz. butter - in a food processor, then pressed into the bottom of the springform pan and baked for 10 mins). I also poached two pears in sugar-water and white wine, then diced them and folded them in at the end. The result was fabulous! My guests even called the next day to ask for the recipe. I agree about beating the ricotta until it's smooth, so it isn't so grainy, but tell everyone not to expect a "cheesecake" texture. A traditional Italian ricotta pie isn't supposed to be that smooth or heavy anyway. Enjoy!

o.k....i got the plan.use a food processor.put in only the cheese,and put it on high a whole 2 minutes.makes it nice and smooth.no grain.also a half teaspoon of almond extract in addition to the vanilla.PUT YOU SEATBELT'S ON FOR THIS ONE FOLK'S!!!

I used 3/4 c. flour in the crust, which made a more prominant lower layer, and added 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the filling. I also baked at 350 instead of 375, for 1 1/4 hours. The result was delicious; the best Italian cheesecake I've ever had. It's important to realize that Italian cheesecake is not meant to be cloyingly sweet like American cheesecake, it's a subtly citrus-flavored, lighter delicacy. If you can't buy fresh ricotta (not the stuff in the plastic containers at the grocery, but *really* fresh ricotta), it's probably not worth making. Often, pre-packaged ricotta is very salty and wet and won't make for a good cheesecake.

Very disappointing. The flavor was fine, but the texture was quite grainy and unpleasant in the mouth. Perhaps fresh ricotta as opposed to store-bought might remedy this, but I doubt I'll give this one another shot.

here's a suggestion, which will make this cake more like a Sicilian cassata (without the spongecake): use anisette (or anise extract) instead of vanilla. Add chopped-up semi-sweet chocolate or chocolate chips (about 1/2-3/4c). If you're really adventurous, find good-quality candied cherries, but not really necessary. Very good recipe, will definitely make again...frankly, it's a bit better than mom's!

This was really tasty. A little different because it's ricotta, and it isn't too sweet, but I loved and so did everyone who tried it. It was alot of work to make it, but worth it. I took the suggestion of making a berry sauce which went well.

I wasn't happy with my results from this recipe. I doubled the crust but had difficulty getting it to cook all the way through. I didn't really like the taste of the ricotta filling. It wasn't sweet at all. I suggest the Mascarpone cheesecake recipe instead. It's heavy but has a great flavor

Excellent. Only one comment: the ricotta could have been a bit more moist. So next time I plan on draining the ricotta for exactly 6 hours instead of ~7-7.5 hours as I did this time.

Definitely a keeper, relatively light and not too cloyingly sweet. I also added some Cointreau to the ricotta mixture, and used the part skim product with excellent results. For company I would serve it with a berry sauce, as suggested by another cook.

A good cheesecake that is light. Very good suggestions from people. I added chopped blanched almonds and orange liquer to cheese mixture. I also add 1/2 tsp. orange peel to the crust.

We love this light and fluffy cheesecake. Yes, double the crust! I've used both whole milk and low-fat ricotta and they're both just as good. And when strawberries are in season, I serve with fresh, sliced berries. When they're not, I make a puree with berries, water and sugar. Yum!

This is a good lite cheesecake for those who do not want the traditional style. I did add more lemon juice to the crust, as someone else suggested. Don't know what size a 24 centimeter springform pan is.....I used a 10" standard size pan. The crust was a little thin. When I make this again, I will double the crust and possibly add some orange curacao to the filling. This receipe is more for a Woman's luncheon.

I added vanilla and Cointreau to the cheese mixture. I also sprinkled candied orange peel on the crust before pouring in the cheese. It made for a wonderful taste.

The 24 centimeter pan = 9-1/2" pan, which is too big. Next time I will use an 8" size pan and not open the oven door during cooking. All this cause my cheesecake to be somewhat flat - but it did taste good. Add a little more lemon.

Fantastic! Relatively simple, delicious, a fitting finale to an Italian meal. I would, however, increase the amount of zests by about 1/2 teaspoon. Also, try some variations--add about 1/2 cup amaretto, some chopped hazlenuts or some chopped toasted almonds.
