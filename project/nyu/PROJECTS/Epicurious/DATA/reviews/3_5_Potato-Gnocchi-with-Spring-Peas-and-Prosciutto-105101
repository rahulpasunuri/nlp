I can't wait to try this! I've read the reviews and I'm ready... My family is doing a "potato dish" contest for our Christmas dinner.

This was very tasty but what wouldn't be tasty coated in cream butter and proscuitto? I think I might have made the gnocchi too big - the kids were helping and I think they were uneven so some were undercooked. also, it's hard to see if they are floating to the top when the water is at a rolling boil since they come up to the surface and then go back down.

I also doubled the sauce with the exception of the butter. (I sauteed garlic and porcinis in butter before starting the sauce recipe). Next time I'll cook the prosciutto separately getting it nice and crispy and then add it to the sauce...might give the dish a interesting texture.

The recipe according to the instructions is wonderful. However, the gnocchi recipe is one to print out and laminate. I've used it many times whenever I want to make Gnocchi, easy and tastes great. I make them with some pesto.

Easy to make and completely wonderful! I made it without the peas since my husband has an aversion and it still turned out well.

The gnocchi was extremely easy to make; I didn't bother making an indentation. I used a teaspoon of the butter to sautee two cloves of pressed garlic and then added the cream. I tripled the sauce based on prior recommedations(but not the prosciutto), but that may have been a little too much. Next time I'll just double it. I sprinkled with parmesan cheese before serving. Everyone loved it.

This dish was easy to make and tasted wonderful! I modified the sauce recipe because there is not enough. I increased the cream to 1.5 cups, peas to 1.5 cups (used frozen), Butter to 9 tablespoons, and left the ham at 1/4 cup. The salt can be reduced to 1/2 tsp (because proscuitto is salty already) and needs to be added to the sauce along with fresh ground pepper. I recommend rolling the dough to a 1/2 inch thick log before cutting pieces otherwise they are too big. Start the sauce a few minutes after putting the water for the gnocchi to boil. Doing so will ensure that the sauce is done about the same time the gnocchi is done. Make sure the proscuitto is heated all the way through (cook in sauce for at least two minutes.) If you have never cooked gnocchi before, I recommend testing a very small batch to get the cooking time just right. I found that I had to cook them longer than 10 to 15 seconds. You can serve with fresh grated parmesean cheese over the top.

I was leary of the gnocchi as I've always read that you must use baking potatoes for gnocchi. But the Yukon gold's worked fine. Added sauteed mushrooms, a clove of garlic and about 1T of fresh basil, minced. Delicious. Eat it up though, the leftovers are a greasy mess. If you don't want to make the gnocchi, the sauce would be good over penne, too.

My first time making gnocchi. Easy and delicious. However, 20 minutes wasn't long enough for the potatoes to get tender enough so I had some lumps in my dough (my fault...no ricer so had to use a fork). Also, the recipe doesn't say what do to with the salt and pepper (is it for the dough or for the sauce?) I used it in the dough based on the ingredient line-up and it was fine. Added sauteed mushrooms. Will definitely make again. Oh, also used less prosciutto based on others comments.

Really tasty. Per earlier reviews, I used 2 oz proscuitto and served with grated parmesan cheese. I also added about 1 oz dried porcini mushrooms (soaked and chopped) and added just a tad of the soaking liquid to the cream for extra flavor. My husband and I both loved it.

This recipe was FABULOUS! I did follow the recommendations of other reviewers by adding parmesan and fresh pepper. Comfort food at it's best. I did however use pre-made gnocchi. Still it was great. I agree with another reviewer that the 1/4 lb of proscuitto is a bit much, so I added about 1/3 to start but sauteed some of it like bacon to sprinkle on top of the dish to add a bit of dimension for presentation purposes. Will definately make again. Thanks epicurious! Thanks Reviewers for your recommendations!

I used premade gnochhi and the sauce from this recipe. It was tasty and SO quick (start to finish it took under 15 minuts to boil the water, cook the gnocchi, and make the sauce). I topped it with a little parmesan and ground black pepper. Next time I might use a little less butter.

This was the first time my husband and I tried making gnocchi. The only ingredient we added was a 1/4tsp of baking powder. The gnocchi were light and fluffy, and delicious. The sauce was wonderful...however, we used about 1/3 of the pancetta, sliced very thin, and that was plenty.

I did not try the sauce, but served the gnocchi with red sauce. The gnocchi dough was easy to work with and cooked perfectly. I attribute this to the proper potato to flour to egg ratio. This is an excellent gnocchi recipe!

Oh, my God!! This is a tasty treat! The gnocchi turned out wonderfully. This recipe made a ton of gnocchi, so I froze half of them on a baking sheet and then put them in a zip-lock to keep for a few weeks. I then dropped them frozen directly in the boiling water--still as light as a feather. Delish!!

I did not make the gnocchi, but just the sauce... I used premade gnocchi to save time. I served it topped w/ freshly grated parmesan cheese. Nice flavor and VERY simple to make. Maybe next time will add a little bit of garlic and/or mushrooms.
