This is my "go to" dessert when I have company. It does not last until the next day! I use more chocolate chips, covering the bottom of the crust. Also,I would suggest adding some bourbon and vanilla to the whipped cream.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year, and it was gone in one sitting. The next day, my guests asked for me to make it again! Needless to say, this is a unique recipe that will really make an impression at your holiday meal. I'm making it again this year, without any modifications. Sooo good!

This is an absolutely delicious and easy-to-make pie. I added more chocolate chips to the bottom because I am a chocolate lover, but other than that, the recipe was perfect as is.

This is a staple for potlucks in our family. It is super easy and takes minutes to make. I do make a couple of changes: 1. Milk Chocolate chips rather than semi sweet, 2. I do not chop the pecans, the mixer does break them up a bit, 3. If we don't have Kahlua we use Tia Maria. I end up baking it just a bit longer - 5 or so minues. Also, if you have chocolate cravers who are into Death by Chocolate, pour a chocolate ganache on top onces it has cooled down. Too much for me but I had friends that raved about it!

I have made this pie for the past 7 or 8 years. It always turns out beautifully and gets rave reviews. Friends and family always request I make it. Make with the butter pie crust on epicurious. Yum! No additions or deletions to the recipe needed although the dark chocolate does sound interesting!

This was a great pie. I made my very first pie for Thanksgiving, it was a chocolate pecan pie from a recipe I found somewhere else that called for so much chocolate that the pie was sludge-like and inedible. We ended up throwing it away. So I found this recipe & wanted to give it another try. I reduced the chocolate called for, mostly of fear, and it was still great! Nice kahlua taste!

Super-easy, and delicious. We use semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips. It consistently gets rave reviews from those who partake.

Rating: 4
I thought this was awesome! The consistency was wonderful and the whole family loved it. The only change I would make is to use dark chocolate and to cut it back to 1/3 cup instead of 1/2. I also placed pecan halves all over the top before baking. Not sure why one review said it was sludgy with a weird taste. He/she must have made an error in the recipe when making it. Would definitely make it again!

This was awesome and so very easy! I'm not normally a big fan of pecan pie, but this was a winner.

Note: I made a a couple of variations of this recipe, not the exact recipe. In both variations, I thought the chocolate was overkill. The next time I make it, I may leave it out. For one of my variations, I substituted hazelnuts and frangelico for the pecan and kahlua. In the second variation, I used an 11 inch tart pan and used a cup of sliced almonds and a half cup of hazelnuts, along with the frangelico. Even with these variations, the pie was really easy to make and really tasty. I'd recommend it, especially for cooks who haven't baked a lot of pies.

I have made this pie 2 years in a row for Thanksgiving and have gotten nothing but rave reviews!! This second time around I made a few adjustments and it turned out even better! Make sure to toast the pecans and brown the butter as that makes a substantial difference. I increased the amount of pecans by a 1/4 cup, used Ghiradelli White Chocolate chips, and used Starbucks liqeur instead of Kahlua (not as sweet). I also recommend scattering some of the white chocolate chips on top of the pie before you bake it. Off to make 2 more on request!

I made this for company and everyone really liked it. I substituted bourbon (Buffalo Trace) for the Kahlua, as I thought the Kahlua would make it way too sweet. The bourbon was excellent! I also add 2 extra Tbsp. of chocolate chips and will bump up the chocolate chips to 3/4 cup total the next time I make it. Also, I didn't have dark Karo syrup so I used light Karo but then substituted brown sugar for the white sugar; this worked out great. Definitely a keeper as it was impressive and extremely easy.

I have made this many holidays since the recipe was published -- always a hit. I make my own crust, add orange zest to the crust and to the pie, which offsets the sweetness/ balances the flavors. I also usually add Grand Marnier to the filling. I have substituted espresso coffee for the Kahlua.

THIS WAS A HIT...I made one Thanksgiving day and felt bad since none of the other pies were eaten very much...mine was gone that night. I have already made another one just for me and my roommates. It is soupy at first, stir it after 30 mins and again one or two more times and increase the cooking time. MAKE SURE AND COVER THE CRUST OR IT WILL BROWN BEFORE DONE. And remember Western Mass. residents...recipes are guides, not the law.

The Kahlua flavor overwhelmed everything else. Had to bake it longer than stated, as it was too loose. It was VERY rich...if that's what you are looking for. I'll stick to the original Pecan Pie recipe on the Karo bottle.

I've not been attracted to pecan pie before, but a friend here in Oz who is married to an American asked us to Thanksgiving dinner and asked me to provide a pecan pie. So I tried this one. Within a week I'd made it twice, exactly as per the recipe and I'm hooked. It got rave reviews from all the guests.

I also used maple syrup instead of the karo and it worked very well. Easy recipe, good flavor. I took some other reviewers advice and added extra chocolate chips, but regretted it after -- too much chocolate, not enough pie! Will try again with less or no chips and bourbon or cognac instead of kaluha.

The chocolate chips and liquor made this pie really delicious and more interesting than the standard pecan pie. The chocolate also made this a nice complement to the pumpkin pie for thanksgiving-- a little different flavor

An amazing spin on an old southern favorite. Being a Georgia girl, I know to brown and cool the butter first (which is a must for true southern pecan pie) and add 1/3 c. more pecans. I have made this recipe every year since 1996 and it never fails to bring joy to the tastebuds. I have substituted Bailey's in the past and either way, this pie is a hit!!!

This has become a Christmas dinner staple! My brother-in-law requests it every year. I poo-poo the idea of using maple syrup (it does not taste the same). It is rich, but fresh whipped cream lightens it a bit. Oh so yummy and heck, I only serve it once a year!

Delicious pie! The chocolate chips were a pleasant surprise in every bite! I did make 2 changes: used 1/4 cup maple syrup and only 1/2 cup dark corn syrup (some guests commented favorably on the fact that it didn't have that strong corn syrup flavor some pecan pies have); and used amaretto (an almond flavored liqueur) rather than kahlua (I just couldn't see coffee flavor in a pecan pie!)

This recipe was a real hit at some of our dinner parties. I've made it several times with slight variations, and everyone raved about it each time! I didn't have Kahlua, so I used Ammaretto, and it was delicious. I also prepared this recipe in 3-inch tart shells for individual desserts, and served it along with butter pecan ice cream. My guests raved! (Even when I accidentally left out the chocolate chips from some of the little ones. No one missed them.) This recipe is already making the rounds, and many guests requested copies. It's a definite keeper!

I just loved the pie but thought the chocolate chips made the pie just a little to sweet. I will definately use it as a stand alone dessert but not after a meal.

What did I do wrong? I bought a 'Nancy's" pie crust, which was fine. Perhaps I should have just used the pecan pieces I bought at Trader Joe's and not have ground them into smaller pieces. Also the pie rose 'way up in the center maybe because I had put foil on the already browning crust. I did brown the pecans and used whiskey instead of kahlua which tasted fine. I think I need to try this again with whole pecans and bake longer at lower temp.

I have made other chocolate/nut pies before and was always disappointed that they were either too dry and/or too sweet. So I was pleased to get rave reviews from this pie with the following minor "tweaks"; a homemade pie crust is always a must, definitely toast the pecans first (7-8 minutes at 400 degrees), needed a bit more pecans (about 1-1/4 cups), and used a combination of semi-sweet and bitter-sweet chocolate.

I make this recipe all the time. Sometimes I use milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet for a simpler chocolate flavor. I also use whatever coffee liquer I happen to have on hand and a little extra vanilla extract. I always double the recipe and freeze the extra pie.

This was also given rave reviews at the last Thanksgiving dinner. I have never been asked for a copy of a recipe so often as I have with this. People are still requesting it. I substituted bourbon (little "airplane" bottle) and used Ghiradelli chocolate. Oo-La-La!!

This was an absolute hit among my guests for Thanksgiving, of six varieties of pies this got the number one rating. I think it was a hit because it wasn't the typical overly sweet/syrupy pecan pie and the chocolate was a surprise addition. I didn't modify the recipe, but did make my own pie crust and took the suggestion of another reviewer and placed some whole pecans on top to decorate and finish it off.

Confession: I grew up in the South and have a SLAMMING pecan pie with brandy recipe. Consequently, I was not as impressed with this recipe as many of the other posters. Granted, it is crowd pleaser -- my friends adored it! But (to me) it was not as "sinfully" rich as the other reviews describe it. Here are some suggestions: *You must brown the butter first on low heat (I can't believe I followed the recipe and neglected to brown the butter). *You should toast the pecans first (either in a deep skillet or in a 400 degree oven). *You should use brown sugar or sugar in the raw; they are richer than basic white cane sugar. *You can substitute 3/4 to 1 cup of white chocolate chips for a more interesting dessert; because the flavor of white chocolate is more subtle, use more chips than called for in the recipe. *Toy with using some of the Godiva liqueurs for a more interesting taste (I was very tempted to use the Cappuccino liqueur but backed out at the last minute).

The comments about using half of the chocolate chips (definitely use the minis) and substituting bourbon for Kahlua are right on. (I use a generous 2 tbsp bourbon and omit the Kahlua.) For the crust I use the one that is given for the Bourbon Walnut Pie. The results are worth the effort of making the crust from scratch. I was very pleased with the results.

I will fully confess that I'm not a fan of pecan pie (too sweet, not interesting enough), so when my dad requested pecan pie I did a search here and came up with this recipe, which sounded good to both of us. I took the suggestion of one of the reviewers and substitued whiskey for kahlua, since neither of us is a fan of that particular liquor. I made two, served them with homemade whipped cream, and they were incredible--a very positive response from the party attendees. The whiskey is subtle but present in taste, and the semi-sweet chocolate is just enough to cut what can be the overwhelming sweetness of pecan pie filling. Oh, I also browned the butter--a nice nutty flavor.

I read the reviews first on this recipe because I wasn't sure about mixing all these ingredients to make my first pecan pie. I used less chocolate chips, added 1/4 cup more pecans, one tablespoon molassas and a little more Kahlua. My friends who didn't fancy pecan pie loved this one. It was a big hit and a great addition to my Thanksgiving dinner. This recipe will stay in my family for sure!

A good variation on a pecan pie, but the chocolate chips overwhelm all other flavors --- don't waste the Kahlua; you can't taste it. I substituted Grand Marnier in for the Kahlua the second time around, and halved the amount of chocolate chips, and the results were much better.

As a professional chef I was impressed with this recipe. Not overly sweet, and with the addition of chocolate and Kahlua you can't go wrong. I used a deep dish pan and the amount of filling was just right. Browning the butter adds a nutty element to the taste. Prior to baking I applied a single layer of whole pecans to the top for a nicer presentaion. People were expecting the usual pecan pie and were ecstatically surprised with the chocolate. Topping it with creme fraiche adds sophistication. Will definitely add to my reportoire of desserts.
