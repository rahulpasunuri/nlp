I thought this was just ok and my husband didn't like it. Roasting the kale was interesting and might be good on its own, if it was seasoned better. The garlic vinegar dressing was kind of strange.

If you have kale on hand, this is a nice way to use it - but nothing special. I followed others' advice and increased potato cooking time and decreased kale roasting time. Used balsamic which was nice.

What a neat way to cook kale! Other reviewers are correct: Potato/shallot mix needs much more time in oven (I had very small potatoes, but 15 minutes was about half what was needed). The kale would probably be good after 10-12 minutes. I used kosher salt and a lot of fresh pepper -- wonderful!

I thought this was great! Used regular onions and added a bit of cayenne pepper. Great way to make kale. I put the potatoes/onions in for about 25 minutes and put the kale in for about 10 minutes at the end (per other suggestions that the cooking times were off)

I love anything with shallots, so this was good. However, like other commenters, I would also cook the potato/shallot/garlic combination at least thirty minutes vs. fifteen. Also, I burned my kale the first time around, because I didn't switch the pan exactly at the halfway part. Great, tangy dressing.

I think this recipe is wonderful, although I agree with everyone else that the cooking times are way off. I put it down to my potatoes being much larger than the recommended size (I couldn't find any that small), and just finished up the potatoes in the microwave when the kale was crispy. The kale was my favorite part; I've never cooked it before, but it was so crispy it was like bacon! I used more salt and oil on both the potatoes and the kale, and I will skip the "dressing" next time. It's great with just salt, pepper, and oil.

I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked the potatoes about twice the time indicated in the recipe and they were perfect -- I left the skins on. I cooked the kale 15 mins. and most of it was completely brown and very crispy. When I stirred in the garlic dressing, the kale really crumbled. My husband and I thought the flavor was splendid -- but I'm going to try a little more oil on the kale and a bit less time in the oven --- so I have less crumbling. Did anyone else have this problem?

This is incredibly tasty! I made it without the shallots, with little yellow potatoes instead of red, and balsamic instead of red wine vinegar. The potatoes took much longer than the reciped predicted so next time I'll nuke them for 7 minutes after cutting them up.

With some editing, the recipe might be all right, but as it stands I wouldn't make it again. The cooking times are off (the kale was almost burned when the potatoes still needed cooking) and even with a double helping of sauce it was still dry and bland. Even though I had high hopes for this recipe (I love all the ingredients) it strikes me as a complicated way of making roasted potatoes--and not as good as my normal recipe.

Roasted kale is delicious!!!! I had never tried it before, and loved its crispiness. I took the kale out of the oven before the potatoes were done as I was afraid it was going to toast too much. Next time I'll roast more garlic for the dressing, and experiment with mixing the kale with other vegetables.

I found the kale too chewy and the dish quite bland.

This was a really good recipe. I took a tip from some of the other reviewers and made a few changes. I doubled the garlic and tripled the vinegar. I cooked the ingredients the entire time recommended in the recipe, but ended up removing the kale and cooking the potatoes, shallots and garlic for an additional 7 1/2 minutes. I also added the dressing over the entire ingredients unlike a couple of the other reviewers. We are introducing kale into our weekly diet. I need to verify that all of the kale nutrients survive the oven. Hopefully they do and this recipe can become part of our normal diet. We served this recipe warm.

This is my new favorite recipe for kale. The crispy kale is so delicious and a great texture for a vegetable with a strong flavor( in my opinion). I used what I had on hand -onions instead of shallots and I added a yam to the potatoes. It tasted great, and I cant wait to try it with shallots.

This is a great side dish and the world's best way to make kale - nice and crispy. Try the kale also in two-inch shreds (a little easier to handle).

I had high hopes for this recipe after reading the ingredients and the other's reviews. But....I was very disappointed. The kale remained chewy and never really incorporated itself nicely into this dish. I also didn't think there was enough dressing in it, making it very dry.

Excellent - good variety of flavors and the kale was a refreshing change!

I thought this recipe sounded very weird and couldn't believe the raves about it, but they were true. I used sweet potatoes and white potatoes which made it quite colorful and I used a fine grade balsamic vinegar which gave just the right touch. I arranged the kale around the outside and mixed the potatoes with the dressing and heaped them on the inside of the plate. Beautiful and delicious! Served with fried plantains and yuca.

I've never eaten kale in my life. I wanted to try something new so I bought the kale and searched for recipes. I really liked the mixture of flavors and texture. The sweetness of red potatoes and shallots with the vingery taste of the dressing was awesome. I forgot to leave the garlic unpeeled but it came out O.K. I recommend for the kale to be left in the oven for about 10 min. unless you want the kale really crispy.

This was so easy and so flavorful. I think I over roasted the kale, but when the dressing was added it softened enough. Everyone just loved them!!
