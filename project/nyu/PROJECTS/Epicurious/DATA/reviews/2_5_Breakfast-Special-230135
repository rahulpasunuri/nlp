A pancake mix?? I don't spend my precious time on Epicurious looking for recipes with ready made mixes and all their "extra" ingredients, names which I can't pronounce.

Lame. Nothing original here. We don't need a recipe that tells us how to make pancakes from a box and eat them with eggs and bacon.

How is this a recipe? This is just how to use pancake mix. And how can it be new if it is from Oct 2004?

This is not a recipe. This is how to use a box pancake mix to make breakfast. Let's differentiate between following directions on a box and a recipe. This is ridiculous.
