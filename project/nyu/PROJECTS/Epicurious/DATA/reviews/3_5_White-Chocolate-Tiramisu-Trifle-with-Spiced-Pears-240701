Yes, this is a long process to prepare and I am still on the fence about it. My mousse must have been overwhipped since it got grainy,too. But how to incorporate the mascarpone otherwise? ANY IDEAS? The pears themselves and their syrup were quite divine. I plan on making them for Christmas dinner served with whipped cream sweetened with the syrup and sprinkled with toasted sliced almonds.

This dessert was not nearly as good as I hoped. For all of the time & expense, it should have been spectacular, and it was just good.

I, too had trouble with the mousse curdling, but it was definitely cool when I added the cream to the chocolate, so must have been the result of over-mixing. I used it as it was, since I didn't want to spend another fortune on chocolate and liqueur to remake it. As another reviewer mentioned, all the components had great flavour on their own, but the resulting flavour when put together wasn't great. I loved the spiced pears - will probably try using them again in a different way. All in all, it was a ridiculously expensive dessert to make and the result was disappointing. I won't make this one again.

Great twist to traditional tiramisu! You don't need that many ladyfingers. I've used hard ladyfingers (dusted off the extra sugar on the ladyfingers) and put the trifle in the fridge for a few hours to let the flavors soak. I've also used soft ladyfingers and served almost immediately because I was worried it would be too soggy. I reduced the white wine to 1 1/2 cup and reduced sugar to 3/4 cup so it wouldn't be too rich. The white chocolate mousse is plenty sweet. Love this recipe with the changes I made and would make again and again :)

When I read the reviews, it seemed people either raved about this or were truly disappointed by it. As I love making new desserts I thought I would give it a go. The first time I made the sabayon it totally flopped and I had to make a second batch in the traditional sense of whisking the eggs over a double boiler etc etc. The syrup was mega sweet (and I have a sweet tooth) - but the flavour of the pears was lovely. However, when combined with the white chocolate, the overall effect was just too sweet. I might try it again if I had the alcohol on hand as it is an expensive recipe. I used Absolut Pear vodka. Pretty average overall, and not quite the showstopper I thought it might be.

I forgot to add that I used Alessi ladyfingers (and I didnt think they were particularly soft. Use harder/crispier ones because the syrup softens them adequately. I also made the mouse, pear syrup, a day ahead of time and it turned out perfectly.

I made this for Christmas Day. It was gorgeous and looked just like the picture (though I do need to practice my chocolate curls). The white chocolate mousse was light and fluffy and tasted delicious though I would use a little bit less Poire Williams because it still had a strong alcoholic taste. The were good - it wouldn't hurt to make extra so that you don't have to scrimp on the pear layers. And it did take me much longer than the indication to reduce the syrup to 1/3ish c. I skipped the cardamom to save $$, but it lacked for nothing. Will make again - it was beautiful!

Total fail. This was the hit of our christmas, in a oh-boy-is-that-bad, this-is-hilarious way. Followed the recipe exactly. It was soggy and boozy. The spiced pears looked exactly like raw chicken breasts. Beware of the Pear Brandy: it completely overwhelmed this dish. Cut it back to 1/4 of what is called for if you try this, and cut back on the pear syrup that you drizzle on the ladyfingers. And, um, maybe sprinkle some cinnamon or something on the spiced pears so it doesn't look like Raw Chicken Trifle...

My God this recipe was expensive to make. Spent a freaking FORTUNE. I made this for four people and everyone thought the alcohol content was overpowering. Which was REALLY a bummer, considering the time and money spent.

Delicious. I did not include the cardamom pods since I couldn't find them and I cut the sugar in the syrup to 1 c. as suggested by others. My pears were not very ripe so I had to poach them for significantly longer (1 hour) but they were still really good. I used a combo of regular brandy and a little peach brandy instead of the Poire Williams, which was totally fine. I don't have a double boiler so I just melted the chocolate in the microwave (30 seconds per session, stir after each session) but didn't have any problem with the mousse being grainy or watery. I also only needed 2 packages of lady fingers and about 1 cup of whipped cream for the top. A big waste to buy/make more. But I didn't think it was terribly time consuming (no more than any other trifle) and everyone raved!

I made this for Christmas Eve this year. I felt like a gourmet cook, because of all the time and steps involved with making it. Being my first trifle, it was a very expensive one. I would have liked an alternative to the pear williams included in the recipe for those of us who don't want to spend $50 for a difficult to find brandy. I made the mousse a day in advance and maybe because of that, the texture changed a bit. It was less smooth and more grainy. Assembling the trifle was fun and easy. I got rave reviews for the taste - it was decadent but not too heavy or sweet. The spiced pears made an extra special treat to the dessert. Overall, I would make this again for a very special occasion.

I made this dessert for a Christmas Eve party and it was a hit! The recipe was easy to follow and it looked beautiful. The only alteration I made was that I added some red raspberries to the layers and for garnish on top with the ginger and the chocolate shavings. I used a couple more pears than what was called for and I used every single slice in the layering. Contrary to other reviews, no one found it too sweet. I was worried about that and I was tempted to alter the recipe but I chose not too and I thought the taste was just right. The mousse was a little grainy when I was assembling the trifle, but that did not translate to any off taste or strange texture in the finished product. I will definitely make this again!

I should have taken a photo!!! No use kicking myself now though, O well! I was one of the most excellent Trifles ever! We had a potluck and it was the first and only thing that actually got polished. In about 10 minutes if I might add, I had to fight for the last little bit. Excellent!!!

This was delicious and beautiful. I made it for thanksgiving last year and it was the hit of the desserts. BUT, I totally revamped the mousse after it was gross and watery from too much liquor. I used more white chocolate and added mascarpone cheese to make it more like mousse texture. I would also at least double the mousse, as I found it lacking. But overall a spectacular dessert - and a nice alternative for those who aren't chocaholics or who are allergic.

Wow! Though time intensive, this recipe tastes as wonderful as it looks! I added a 1/2 tsp. unflavored Knox gelatin to the whipping cream that was used as the toppping. This ensures that the whipped cream will hold it's shape.

Made this for a special Christmas dinner for 10 people and it was truly the hit of the night. I believe this is one of the best trifle recipes I have ever made. The set up was great. The presentation was flawless. The flavor was subtle enough as to not overwhelm anyone's palette, but intense enough to definitely turn heads. Every single person flipped over this dish. I would strongly suggest preparing it explicitly like the recipe calls for and not varying too much. I've begun to experiment with it, but the flavors begin to go off and it isn't quite as good.

I agree with the reviewer who had a puddle in the leftovers. It looked pretty gross and no one wanted to eat it the next day. People usually exclaim over my desserts, but... this one looked lovely before trying it, but no one commented on the taste after trying it. But the poached pears were nice.

This was the most amazing white chocolate mousse I've ever tried! I made this for my book club dinner, to follow a pretty heavy Italian alfredo pasta meal, so it was perfect and light enough to finish the evening with. I took a few shortcuts to save time and/or money: an inexpensive brut champagne left at my house after some party, regular E&J brandy instead of pear brandy, and cream cheese mixed with 1/2 c whipping cream to achieve a mascarpone consistency. I also added sliced toasted almonds in the layering process, to give it more crunch. I couldn't find pear nectar or ladyfingers, so I pureed sliced pears in syrup for the pear nectar (to make 2 cups' worth), and I had to make ladyfingers from scratch. Time- consuming, but worth it, and you can avoid the HFCS found in most prepared cookies. Will definitely make this again!

Rating: 2
I found that this dessert did not go over well with people who had pickier tastes. And although I found it to be so-so, saving the leftovers was a bad idea; all of the liquid had drained out of the layers to create a 2 inch deep puddle on the bottom. If you make this, throw away the leftovers.

I served this at a dinner party last night and recieved rave reviews. I made some changes to the recipe however. First,I didn't have poire Williams on hand, but I did have Captain Morgan Spiced rum. It matched perfectly. I also added some to the poaching liquid. I deleated the sugar in the poaching liquid, but added ground cinamon, ground allspice and fresh nutmeg. The mousse and the lady fingers added enough sweetness and the spiced pears were sweet enough on their own. Also, I made these individualy in martini glasses. Great presentation. I'd like to try tweaking this recipe a little for summertime with fresh raspberries.

I made this for Christmas dessert and it was just right; not too sweet as the fresh pears really came through. I assembled the morning of our dinner so the tiramisu was soft. Its a good receipe to do ahead and looked beautiful.

I used regular brandy and pear juice in place of the water instead of Poire Williams to save money. Also added only 2/3 c of sugar to the syrup based on other reviews. My dessert was not to sweet at all, in fact, I'm not a huge lover of really sweet desserts, but felt it could have been a tad sweeter. So I would say if you are worried it will be too sweet, cut back on the sugar and make sure you use unsweetened pear juice. Anyway, overall I felt it was delicious but I had problems with the mousse as well. For that reason, as well as the overall work involved, I can't give it 4 forks.

I prepared the recipe exactly as written and it was fabulous. I used Bosc pears and pear juice (without added sugar). I had no trouble with the mousse. I didn't use all the syrup or all of the whipped cream and I forgot the powdered sugar. Even after a rich meal, everyone asked for seconds. The candied ginger is a must.

Served this to my gourmet group last night and it was fabulous! Even the non-dessert eaters had some and raved. I had no problem with the recipe as written. I skipped the whipped cream topping--didn't seem necessary and it wasn't. My daughter was concerned that there wouldn't be enough taste to this because it was just pears and boy was she wrong. I will serve it again.

SO so so sweet. Made this for Christmas and everyone else said they liked it but I didn't. I even reduced the sugar in the poaching syrup to 2/3 cup and it still knocked me over in one bite. However, it does have potential, so this is what I would recommend (unless you like to mainline your sugar): Use only about 1/3 c. sugar in the poaching syrup, and increase the spices. Reduce the white chocolate to about 5 oz. and add two egg yolks to the mouse, during the cooking phase--put them in like you're making hollandaise sauce. Definitely watch the temp. on the mousse, keep it just a little warm for mixing. White cake or angel food cake would work better than lady fingers, which get a bit grainy when soaked with syrup. I also would use only about 2 1/2 cups poaching syrup because it goes a long way. This dessert is BEAUTIFUL to look at however, so with some tweaking, it could be a great "blonde" dessert go-to.

What a perfect winter dessert. Everyone, including kids, LOVED this dessert. Three things I will do differently next time: 1. whip the cream until firmer than is recommended before adding it to the mascarpone mixture, so it doesn't drip down quite so much. 2. It's very important that you chill for the 3 hours recommended - I waited only one hour for the first layer and it wasn't firm enough. 3. I will slice the pears a little thicker because I was left with 1 1/2 whole pears.

Made this for Christmas eve but took the advise of the recipe and made this is several steps, starting the day before. It turned out as beautiful as it was delicious and I thought it was just right after a hearty meal. The price of the brandy recommended was a bit pricey...$79 but found another for around $25 but well worth the flavor. I would make it again and possibly try other variations...it would be fun!

This recipe was delicious, and a huge hit. I think the sweetness of the syrup has been blown way out of proportion by other reviewers; I used 1 cup of sugar, and it was perfect. (Desserts are supposed to be sweet.) Like other reviewers, I had a problem with the mousse curdling. I think this may have been alleviated by cooling the white chocolate mixture until it thickened a bit, which I will try next time. It didn't affect the finished product, though. I was unable to find soft ladyfingers, so I used hard ladyfingers, didn't reduce the pear syrup as much, dipped the ladyfingers into the pear syrup rather than brushing them, and refrigerated the trifle for 8+ hours (ideally overnight). Don't be stingy with the candied ginger -- the crunch contrasts beautifully with the softness of the trifle; I used about 1/2 cup. This dessert took a bit of effort, but it was worth it. My guest -- and I -- loved it.

I used pear juice thinking it wouldn't be as sweet as nectar and cut the sugar to 1 cup as suggested by other reviewers. Still the syrup was way too sweet. I forgot to put any syrup on the middle layer and it was by far the best. When I make this again I will omit putting the syrup on the ladyfingers. They are fresh so they certainly don't need it. This came together beautifully and looked just like the cover. As a side note they reversed the layering in the picture and actually had a layer of poached pears under the whipped cream.

This is what I love about the reviews. I've got everything chilled and ready to assemble but the picture shows one way of layering and the recipe says another. I am going to follow the photo...Thanks Kansas City. I'm giving it 4 forks even though I haven't tasted the finished product..just the different layers and fantastic so far.

I made this for my family's christmas eve gathering & while they have not tried it yet, i did & loved it. It was rich, but guess I was expecting it so that didn't bother me. I liked how you could assemble all it's various parts over the course of a few days. The only issue I had was that my mousse didn't set up prefectly. It didn't curdle so much as it was a bit thin...but it still tasted amazing ( I actually think I used a little less chocolate than called for). I did use pear brandy & it wasn't too exspensive (found it on sale at Binny's), but so worth the taste. Despite my one set back it turned out beautifully

I made this desert for dinner last night and everyone loved it. I thought it was easy to assemble and if the directions are followed I think it will turn out great. I did not change the recipe at all. One of the friends that was coming to dinner had brought me a bottle of pear brandy with the pear in the bottle last year at Christmas and I had not wanted to open it since it was so pretty. This recipe convinced me to use the brandy and we were not disappointed. I sent leftovers home with some of the guests.

My new daughter in law accepted my challenge to make this for our Thanksgiving meal this year and all of us were blown away!

This is something very special...and all of us had seconds!

To all the non- believers...you had me very worried. I started preparing the recipe over the weekend in preparation for my company party. On the Tuesday before the event I logged on to epicurious.com where I had a chance to read all the reviews. Unfortunately, while the Tiramisu was not assembled, all the items were complete and not in a position to be adjusted. Note that I too, reduced the poaching liquid to only 2 cups. While there were lots of steps, I found preparation straight forward, attractive and with a wonderful taste. I would like to add that the photo shows (from the bottom up)lady fingers, followed by pears then the cream mixture. The recipe calls for the lady fingers, followed by the cream and then the pears. I followed the photo.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it and thought it was a work of art. It is expensive and time intensive, but worth it for the final product. I had no problems other than trying to find pear brandy, so I used pear liqueur. It IS rich, but it's not meant to be the main meal!!

I made this recipe for a huge party. Throwing it together at the last minute, having made everything the day before. I accidently left out the pear nectar. It was definitley not too sweet. Nothing curdled. Everyone loved the presentation. It looked just like the picture. They also appreciated the demonstration of putting it together.

What a disaster. Curdled cream!, too expensive, too labor intensive, too sweet. When I finally got it to look somewhat like the picture and not be a curdled mess I felt like tossing it! The idea sounded great and next time I'll make it much more like a traditional tiramisu with the beaten eggs to make it mousse-like. Use the pear brandy to sprinkle on the lady fingers.

This recipe is definitely time consuming, but makes a very impressive display for guests. I did not reduce my syrup down as far as recommended and substituted plain brandy with a splash of pear nectar for the pear brandy (which is rather expensive for only cooking with). I had none of the other problems mentioned. The cake was even better the next day.

As soon as I saw the cover photo I knew I had to make this dessert. I read the reviews before making so I only added 2/3 cup of sugar and did not dust the finished trifle with powdered sugar. I used Perugina white chocolate as I could not get Lindt, which is what I would usually use. It was delicious... very rich. Not difficult to make but somewhat time consuming. Next time I make this I will do most of the steps the day before. This is an expensive dessert to make. Now that if have restocked my pantry with the ingredients it will not be so bad the next time I make it... and I will make it again.

Listening to the reviews below, I cut the sugar in half, and instead of using white sugar, used trader joe's organic evaporated cane juice in place of the white stuff. also, used the marscapone at room temperature to avoid curdling the mousse. worked very well. thanks for the tips. also, it's a must using real white chocolate (made with cocoa butter) verses the cheap waxy stuff. lindt is the best i've found and not overly sweet. worked nicely for the mousse and the curls on top. also, the tip at the end of the recipe for using a cheese plane or veggie peeler to make the curls after softening the choc. bar in the micro worked extremely well. it was terrific, and the party I served it for gave it rave reviews. i'm making it again in two weeks for another dinner. terrific! easy and very beautiful.

Ick. I can't believe this was in Bon Appetit this month. And on the COVER yet. For the flavor, you should just serve a beautiful poached pear. It sounds good in an idea, but not in execution. My mousse was fine, no curdling, syrup was fine, etc. But after trying it, I wouldn't even serve it. WAY too rich, and not in a good way. Save the time, money, and effort, and make a cream cheese/whipped cream/sour cream cream trifle with mixed berries, angel food cake, and cream mixture (sweetened and vanilla's). Add a spike of amaretto and you're good to go. NOT WORTH IT.

i made the trifle for a christmas party and it was the hit of the night. the women flocked to the fridge just to look at it. fortunately, it tasted as great as it looked. the part of the recipe that suggests the mousse be barely lukewarm should be observed in order to avoid curdling. i let mine get cool. i cut the sugar for the syrup to 1 cup only which seemed to work. the pear nectar had plenty of sugar so i didn't feel the need to add any more than necessary. i didn't have pear brandy so i used regular brandy and added some to the syrup to cut the sweetness. i also threw in a dash of haitian rum to jazz it up a bit (and to cut the sweet). the ladies at my party said it wasn't terribly sweet and the pears added a nice element. i would definitely make this again.

Here are my observations for what theyre worth (and I consider myself an above-average cook): 1) I also had the curdling problem with the mousse, but was able to salvage it&I suspect the reviewer from NY is correct when suggesting to let the mascarpone get to room temp to prevent this from happening 2) I used Absolut Pear vodka instead of the brandy, which is often a challenge to find and more expensive when you do 3) I only reduced the pear syrup to a generous 2+ cups, preventing it from getting too sweet (although for those of us who prefer savory, its still very sweet) and 4) b/c there was syrup left Ive created a pear cocktail (using this syrup, Southern Comfort and ginger ale) I plan to serve as part the dessert & drinks portion of our progressive dinner. This is definitely a special occasion dessert, but I think well worth the effort! Bon appétit et bon chance!

I made this for my family's Thanksgiving and it was a huge success - everyone loved it so much, the other desserts weren't touched (but made great leftovers...) I agree with some of the other reviews, the white chocolate mousse was a little too sweet, I think next time I'd cut back on the amount of chocolate, but I didn't experience any of the other problems. I'm not sure why some people had issues with the mousse curdling, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully. Definitely a keeper.

i tried to make this dessert for Thanksgiving. My mousse curdled twice, and i had to substitute with my own white chocolate mousse recipe. If you want to make this dessert, i recommend that you let mascarpone cool down to room temperature. This was not specified in the recipe, and i suspect that the temperature difference between the components of the mousse was the culprit in my case. Also, cheese and mousse emulsions curdle when overbeaten, so make sure you fold rather than beat or whip.

The sum of the parts of this recipe are delicious on their own but together not so good. The white chocolate mouse, although tasty and rich, over powers the lady fingers and the poached pears. I don't recommend making this recipe...it's expensive and not worth the time and effort. The pear poaching and reduction sauce are great and simple enough to make and I'll be using that again.

As my guests described this...it was heaven on a plate. We did accidentally leave out the pears from the trifle...so, we actually cut them up and decorated the plate with them. The candied ginger offset the sweetness some. But, still...the white chcoolate mousse definitely made this amazing.
