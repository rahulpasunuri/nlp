Wow. This ice cream is seriously tasty. I was pretty true to the recipe. But I didn't spring for a vanilla bean and just used a tsp of extract...it seemed to work great! I also was in a hurry and didn't soak the pineapple for a full hour. I imagine the rum taste would have been a bit stronger had I managed that last 30 minutes. Unless you have a jumbo ice cream maker, you may have to process this in 2 batches. There was way too much for my little Cuisinart to handle at once.

Forgot to say I only used four egg yolks, too!!

Okay, so I made some changes. But this is incredible, and made as written would probably be even more delicious, so I don't feel bad rating it. I used vanilla extract (1 tsp), 3/4 cup pineapple juice. I only used 1/2 cup sugar. I stirred in 2 tbsp rum after the mixture came off the heat, so it wouldn't be cooked and would keep it's alcohol content, because it keeps ice cream from freezing too hard. The flavors of pineapple and rum may have been more subtle this way, but they were still present, and quite delicious! Served with pineapple upside-down cake.

Simple and very good! It got rave reviews at our dinner party.

I have made it twice now and found that fresh pineapple juice squeezed from fruit made a nice difference. Do not add the fruit too soon as it will freeze to the insides of the churn.
