I doubled the anchovy dressing base, using part of it to brush on the bread (artisinal rustic olive, whcih gave even more flavor)and part as marinade base for seafood, to which I added balsamic vinegar and chopped fresh rosemary. My friend loved it! It was a great, light summertime dish.

I feel badly giving such a low rating when everyone else loved it. First of all, I found the Caesar dressing "un-Caesar-like" as the lemon juice seemed to overwhelm the anchovy paste and the cheese. I've made better Caesar dressings, with more spices and flavourings and a slightly beaten egg to pull it all together. In addition, I found the scallops unexceptional prepared on the grill - I much prefer to pan sear them so that they come out a bit crispy on the outside. All in all, I won't be making this recipe again.

I'm adding this to my weeknight quick fix dinners. We love it!

My husband and I really liked this for a casual dinner. I used all large shrimp instead of combining with the scallops. I also added 1 cup of grilled corn kernels and it was delicious. I'll definitely make again.

Okay. This is REALLY good and really easy. I made it this morning before work with frozen scallops and shrimp, from Costco. I thawed them in cool water for awhile, then removed them and blotted them with paper towells. I heated a cast iron skillet, with butter and oil, seasoned the fish with Lawry's Seasoned Salt and Lemon Pepper and cooked both rather quickly. The browned, carmelized scallops make me swoon. The dressing is wonderful. I packed them all separately for work and then just tossed and blended for an impressive and gourmet meal. REALLY good. I'm making it again tomorrow..Today my co-workers had sandwiches from a deli. Tee Hee I paid less for a much better lunch!

I'm rating this a 4 even though I haven't made it yet, kind of the reverse of making a recipe with ingredients you don't like, then reviewing it a 1 or less. I know it will be wonderful since I just ordered colossal "dry" scallops (8/pound) from Soldotna,Alaska. I don't want anything to detract from the flavor of those scallops!

Oh so good. And I've also cheated with prepared dressings (high quality) perked up with more anchovy and fresh lemon and had very acceptable results. Nothing not to like about this! (well, unless you're one of those people who reviews by starting out, well, I don't like shrimp or scallops or romaine or garlic but decided to try this anyway, based on the reviews.....HA! But that's another story....sheeeeesh.) This, (unless you try to turn it into shrimp louie or something) is great.

Can be served as a main dish. The contrast of textures and flavors make this a deightful dish. Needless to say the croutons must be homemade using a French baguette.

This recipe was marvelous. I would recommend it to anyone who loves seafood.

This is a simple, yet elegant first or main course. I have made this both on the grill and in a grill pan with equal results. While the grill pan is quicker, the grill will provide more flavor. Make sure you have plenty of fresh ground pepper to finish. Recipe can easily be expanded for additional people, but check the dresing as you go.
