This was awesome! The meat was moist, the stuffing flavourful. Very easy to make. My family raved about it. Will definitely make again.

DO NOT RATE A RECIPE THAT YOU HAVEN'T TRIED!!! Everyone who gave this one fork and wouldn't make it again hasn't tried it in the first place. I wouldn't have looked at it myself based on the ratings, but it was the only stuffed pork chop recipe on Epicurious. The people who actually tried it gave it good reviews, and I just needed the time and temperature readings for my dinner. DON'T SKEW THE RATINGS BASED ON YOUR OWN PREJUDICES!!! I'll let you know how it is after I try it.

I needed a basic stuffed porkchop recipe and this was the closest I could find. I followed the cooking directions exactly except that I sauted the onion with a chopped apple and 2 garlic cloves and mixed that with herb-bread stuffing. They came out great. Adding more dried fruit or even the fruitcake version, I imagine, would be tasty. This was the most moist, perfectly cooked chop I have ever had.

I hate fruitcake! But this was the greatest fruitcake I've ever had! Do try it! At least!

You've got to be kidding! I'm one of the few people around who actually like fruitcake. But shoving it into a pork chop?! Please.
