My husband & I recently started on the Mediterranean Diet, & this was a perfect dish for it. I added a can of drained & rinsed cannellini beans, doubled the scallions & kalamata olives & it was a great main course salad. The radishes add a nice bit of heat & crunch.

love the simplicity and the complex flavors from this dish. I'm looking forward to making it again with the remaining radishes from the bunch I bought!

I was a bit skeptical at first, but was pleasantly surprised. The tuna and radish flavors come head to head, I added arugula as well which added an additional depth to it. Doing it again for an office potluck, it's interesting enough and more importantly, simple!

Keeper!! My husband and I loved this, and he is not really a fan of radishes or olives, so I was alittle worried this dish might be to much for him...but he gobbled it up, and said "this is a keeper". I made it as stated in recipe, with the exception that I added a little feta.

I was inspired to find a non-mayo tuna salad after tasting one at a Spanish restaurant. The lemon flavor really comes out after sitting, so don't add too much extra. I was worried about the radishes, but they don't stand out in the dish.

Easy and delicious! Will make this one again soon.

Unappetizing, and way too oily.

A tasty combination of flavors and great salad. I quadrupled the amount of olives and used coriander instead of (boring) parsley. However it's not as good a day later, unless you keep the radishes separate from the start(they get soggy).

I have found lime to be more pleasing to my palette in tuna salad than lemon, so I used it and I think this salad is incredible. Who knew you could make tuna salad without mayonnaise! If you haven't tried tuna (as long as it has been packed in olive oil) in tomao sauce over pasta yet, you don't know what you're missing.
