It was okay, I used fresh mint leaves from my garden. I may not have used enough because the mint flavor was barely there. So I added some peppermint extract and it still wasn't minty enough for me.

I served with with homemade whipped creme, but vanilla ice cream and a thick greek yoghurt work, too!

I made this dessert two days in a row as I had lots of berries. This was super easy to make. I used mint from the garden for the tea. Four of us enjoyed this healthy, light, hint of mint dessert. Greek- style yogurt is important. Must enjoy tartness of berries and yogurt.

Hmmm...Not sure about this one...Black berries are sweet enough by themselves.
