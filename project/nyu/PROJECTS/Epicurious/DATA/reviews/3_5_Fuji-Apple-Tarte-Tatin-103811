This recipe is a keeper as it was easy to make, looked fabulous and tasted great! There were NO leftovers! Next time, I'll make 2! I would follow the recipe and quarter the apples and lay them in concentric rings on their sides, not on their ends. With leftover slices, slice them thinly and wedge in between. I also covered my cake pan in butter, to prevent sticking and add richness!

Mine turned out very tasty, although not very pretty. Looked nothing like the picture as it did not 'unmold' from the pan onto the platter. Oh well, threw some vanilla ice cream on top.

Okay... I really hate to go against the common opinion of this recipe, but I thought it was mediocre at best. I thought this dish's success relied too heavily on a large scoop of ice cream. I don't believe that a dish is worthy of a high rating if it cannot stand alone and still be exceptional. The flavor was extremely flat, although my caramel was very, very dark and stout. I will say that this recipe was very time-consuming, but yielded very visually pleasing results. However, as beautiful as it looked, nobody at my dinner party thought it was particularly noteworthy at all. I'll keep on looking.

I loved making this dish. I didn't even mind peeling the apples after I saw and tasted the results. It makes one feel so, how you say?...French.

This is the only dessert that I have ever made where one of my guests surreptiously lifted her plate and licked it clean. What can I say? It's delicious. Just budget 5 hours so it will be at room temperature when you flip it for serving. Definitely bake it in the pan recommended in the recipe because the presentation is beautiful.

Great recipe! Budget plenty of time, from washing the apples to table it is about 5 hours. My variation is that I bake the pastry sheet on its own and then arrange the apples on top of it. No problems with turning upside down or worrying about the pastry getting too wet. I know, for purists it might be totally crazy, but it cuts the time to 21/2 hours. Also, melted butter and caramelized sugar NEVER blend, I just caramelize the sugar and place chunks of butter over the apples. As you can see, I go for the easy route and my guests love it. Also, try creme fraiche with a few drops of vanilla essence on top.

I made this over the weekend and it was so easy and delicious. No pie crust to make and roll. Next time I might use a tarter apple since it was pretty sweet. A small scoop of the best vanilla ice cream is a must. Not really something you can make too far in advance because it's best warm, but not reheated. I'm skeptical that it would feed 8 people unless they were very restrained eaters. People will want seconds of this.
