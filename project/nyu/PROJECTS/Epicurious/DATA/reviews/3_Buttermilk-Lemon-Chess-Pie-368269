Delicious. Been requested again this year for Thanksgiving. The only thing I would do differently is no par-bake the crust as long as recipe suggests. Or like another review stated, use a different crust. It tasted great but was a little hard on the bottom.

This pie was AMAZING. I used Ina Garten's perfect pie crust with it. One of the best tasting pies I've ever had. Sweet and lemony, but not over powering. Seriously a keeper!

I made my own crust and did not prebake it - didn't seem worth the trouble. I baked it for the whole hour and fifteen minutes. Delicious pie, but not traditional enough for our Thanksgiving table. We always say we want to try new things, but in the end we always get out the old favorite recipes! Got great reviews at my husbands office Thanksgiving buffet.

I found this recipe using my droid on epi, and it had 4 forks. You definitely could get a car off a patch of ice with the crust, but the filling was great! It was requested for Thanksgiving this year.

I am a northern transplant to NC and felt compelled to try this recipe because of its history. Mistake. The crust was rigid and hard as a rock, the filling so dense and sweet it would take the enamel off your teeth. I have baked many pies in my years and Never had to "deep 6" a pie in my life - this was the first - not worthy of my time or the ingredients.
