This is a mediocre side dish. My suggestion would be to heed the advice of all the testers and change the recipe to fit your needs. This is not one I will tuck away in my repertoire.

Nice side dish. In the future I'll add mushrooms or other items to make it more interesting.

this is a great one for doing variations...mushrooms, shallots...and smells great while it's cooking

This was delicious. I used chicken broth instead of water, and ditched the onions and added garlic! What a great combination. A great side dish for the pork chops with mushrooms and very easy to prepare and cook...dinner prepped and on the table in less than 30 minutes. I am looking forward to having the leftovers at lunch.

Our steamer finally died and I thought I would try this recipe as an alternative...very good. The onion added a lot of flavour.

I was looking for something to accompany a pork loin for a dinner party. This dish served it's purpose as a great side dish. Very simple, yet delicious.

Used basmati rice and came out beautifully. Also, used curry powder as suggested and it was a nice touch! I used 2 carrots. The more the better!

This sounded plain, but the reviews were so positive I decided to try it and was really happy with how well it turned out. Delicious! I kept the onions and added 1/2 tsp. curry powder as one of the other reviewers suggested.

I doubled the recipe to serve 8. I had so much left over, I added slivered almonds, currants, rice wine vinegar and a little olive oil..Served as a salad the next day. It was even better than the hot version.

I suggest keeping the onions and adding toasted pine nuts. My family likes rice cooked this way very much. I also add some curry powder on occasion (fry approx. 1/2 tsp until flavorful after onions are tender before adding the rice).

Skip the onion. Instead of water use chicken broth(for 1 measure of rice use 3 measures of chicken broth). With the broth reduced to 50% add the julien carrots and continue to cook until all the broth absorbed.

I agree -- most any veggie chopped fine would work great in this easy recipe. We have this regularly -- the kids eat veggies mixed in with rice better than they do when they are in separate piles on the plate. Use any leftover chopped veggies added in to steam at the end. We also add toasted slivered almonds.

This was pretty and good. It makes enough for at least 3 people, maybe even four. Next time I will omit the butter and onions. Really, you could put any vegetable on top of the rice for a quick steam. This is a very good idea!
