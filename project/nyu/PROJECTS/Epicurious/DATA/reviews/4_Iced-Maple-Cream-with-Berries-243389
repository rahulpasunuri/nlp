followed directions but I was not overwhelmed

I have made this twice now. The first time my friends and I were literally stunned at how good it was. We all sat around staring at the bowls in wonder. "You made this? Ice cream? How?" etc. It is so easy, even with all the mixing. And then it's just ready whenever you want it.

Unbelievably good! Hard to imagine that this is made without an ice cream maker. I'd liken it to a semifreddo...very creamy and rich.

It took me longer than described to get the ingredients to tempurature on the stove...but it was worth the work. My guests RAVED about it and nearly licked the bowls clean. Simple and delicious.

Yuuuummyyy! Made this a couple of weeks ago...never thought I could make ice cream that tasted so good without an ice cream maker. My dad was scraping it out of the bottom of the bowl!

The flavours are EXTRAORDINARY! I will make this again, and AGAIN!
