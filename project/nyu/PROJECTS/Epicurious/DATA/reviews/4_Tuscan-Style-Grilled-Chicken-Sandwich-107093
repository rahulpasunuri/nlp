Easy and delicious. I also do carmelized onions or shallots and arugula, in place of the mixed greens.

I too added carmelized onions and arugula. Divine. Even my 12-year olds loved it.

We love this recipe for a mid-week supper! Flavorful and easy. I make enough for 8, and with our five kids, they are happy! I love this served with a big cut-up mixed fresh fruit bowl loaded with all seasonal fruit available, and it is especially good with mango, pineapple, and sliced minneola oranges mixed with a very light handed honey lime dressing that I have added just a smidgeon of rum.

terrific sandwich and so easy - my husband loves it when i plan this for dinner! i have used a ciabatta roll and found the sandwich a bit hard to hold together, bite into, etc. my only suggestion would be to experiment with a roll that is a bit easier to manage.

We thought this was the basis for a good sandwich, but was missing something as written. Even with the tomatoes and adding twice the pesto, it lacked a high note. Too bland. After a couple of bites, we pulled the the bread tops off and drizzled with a little good balsamic vinegar. What a difference. Next time we'll also substitute the greens with arugula for a little bite.

Made these sandwiches for company who thoroughly enjoyed every bite. We added roasted red peppers, huge hit. Thanks epecurious!

I love this site! Searched for grilled chicken and pesto, and voila! I accidentally bought chicken tenders, and they were the perfect size - no slicing. I had a loaf of artisan Italian bread with garlic and rosemary which was wonderful, grilled with olive oil. And homemade pesto was essential. A wonderful summer sandwich to enjoy on the porch!

DELICIOUS! It was SO good! I made it for my family and they all LOVED it! I would for surely make it again.

What an incredible sandwich! We've made this a bunch of times, and have found it's even better with a few modifications: We use smoked gouda instead of mozzarella and arugula instead of mixed baby greens. We definitely oil and toast the bread, and assemble everything while the chicken is still hot, to get the cheese all melty. Delicious! It's easy to scale up for a crowd, too.

So good & so easy! We don't use the artichoke hearts. You probably should grill the bread, and I'm going to try Fontina cheese + roasted red peppers. So many options with this recipe!

One of the best sandwiches ever! Cant go wrong with extra pesto!!!!

My husband's first words upon tasting this were: "Honey, put this on the rotation". I have made this recipe time and time again, always a much-lauded favourite among friends and family. A just-fine shortcut is to buy a rotisserie chicken.

Good, but not great. Followed the recipe to the letter but if I try this recipe again, the next time I will brush the cut sides of the ciabatta with olive oil, rub in a little garlic and broil for added flavor/interest. I used Best Foods mayo to mix with the pesto but the flavor of the sauce was too dilute - next time I'd double the amount of pesto used. Consider omitting the canned artichoke hearts as they didn't add much of anything in taste or texture. Perhaps the memory of Ina Garten's Caesar Club Sandwich has spoiled me for other ciabatta sandwiches.

Excellent. I didn't add the mayo but it was still delicious. I will be making this many more times.

I made this with homeade pesto & rubbed the rolls with garlic and grilled as the chicken cooked. I served the sandwiches with mixed greens in a balsamic dressing plus thick-cut potato chips - wonderful. weeknight meal.

Served cold for a picnic (assembled when we got to our designated eating spot). They were a little messy due to the holes in the bread (I could not find rolls) but were very yummy. Cooked the chicken in the oven.

So easy, so good. Served w/a side of spinach and celery salad from this website. I used a grill pan instead, but it still turned out great!

Tasty recipe- easy enough for a weekday night and good enough for company. I marinated the chicken in olive oil balsamic vinegar, rosemary and garlic. Served with sweet potato fries (recipe on this site) and roasted asparagus - yummy!

Great flavors and very easy.

This dish was wonderful! I even opted to use leftover hamburger buns (I know...lame) and it was still great. This makes enough mayo-pesto sauce for about four sandwiches so prepare accordingly.

I loved this sandwich! Based on previous reviewers' suggestions, I made a few minor changes. I brined the chicken before grilling it, used sun dried tomatoes, brushed the bread with olive oil, lightly grilled it and then rubbed it with garlic. I served the sandwich with Kettle Potato Chips. Easy and delicious!

A fantastic, easy dish I got on the table in 15 minutes. Bought a fabulous foccacia at the local bakery for this dish, and had a super meal.

I can't believe how good this was. LOVED the pesto mayonnaise (used homemade pesto). I used sun-dried tomatoes instead of plum tomato and toasted the ciabatta bread on the grill before assembling. I will make this again and again, and I don't even really care for chicken

We loved this sandwich! I used foccacia and fresh vine ripe tomatoes. My sister loved it as is, my husband preferred it without the artichokes. I am making it again this weekend for company. It's so easy and can be ahead of time so the cook actually gets to enjoy the party. This time I am going to brine the chicken first. Delish!

A family favorite--I'm making it again tonight! We've made this many times and it's an easy weeknight recipe. Very sloppy but good!

What the heck did I do wrong??? After reading previous critiques, I brined the chicken and grilled the ciabatta, then assembled the sandwiches. We thought they were all right (kind of) but nowhere near wonderful. Not a sandwich I'll try again.

This is a great recipe and the sandwich was very good. But, the pesto mayo blend was fabulous! My husband ate it on everything all weekend long. We will definitely make the sandwiches again, and I believe that pesto mayo is our newest addition to the condiments served in our house.

The pesto mayonnaise makes this sandwich a showstopper. Change the veggies to suit your tastes - I loved the artichokes and tomatoes, but felt the mozzarella got lost in the other families. I used the ciabatta and thought it was a little too much bread for me; I'd like something a little thinner.

Honestly, the best chicken sandwhich we have ever had! This is a classic, and I have added it to my favorites. We used what we had at the house instead of running to the store, so we used French bread, and swiss cheese as substitues and it came out delicious! We brined the chicken breast for 1 hr as suggested by others, and grilled the bread as well. We also added alot more pesto to the mayo so that the flavor of the pesto was prominent. Turned out great!! Thank you for another great, last minute show stopper!

We did not change a thing when making this recipe and it was divine. It is a wonderful marriage of flavours.

This sandwich is delicious! Followed the recipe as is with ciabatta. As good as it was with the mayo/pesto dressing, some of my guests found it even more delicious with just the pesto and no mayo. They said it was more flavorful and I agree but I love pesto. Either way you can't go wrong. It is one of the best sandwiches any of us had ever had.

This has become a classic in our home. Positively, one of the best sandwiches I have ever had!! When we grill on the weekend, we put on a couple of chicken breasts and then during the week, the chicken is ready to go. If you are so inclined, make your own pesto. It really makes all the difference. During the summer months when fresh basil is abundant in the market, I make batches of pesto and freeze in small containers, so whenever a craving for this sandwich hits, the pesto is waiting for me! Fantastic recipe!

My entire family enjoyed this recipe. It was easy to make and had a wonderful combination of flavors. I'm always looking for sandwiches that can be made ahead to bring to outdoor summer concerts or picnics and this one fills the bill!

My husband and I loved these sandwiches! I used ciabatta and store-bought pesto, still turned out great! We will definitely make them again!

This recipe is absolutely amazing. I'm an avid cook, both of fast&easy and gourmet recipes. This recipe is both! I've made it for a church luncheon, executive (office managers) retreat, and family gatherings - all were dying for the recipe and thinking I was the Queen of the Kitchen! My modifications: I put it on sourdough, and added chopped sundried tomatoes. I removed lettuce, and grilled it up like a panini sandwich. Excellent with kettle potatoe chips, or for colder weather - served with butternut squash soup. Makes a LOT, so don't be surprised to be eating leftovers for a few days.

This chicken sandwich was wonderful. I made it for family, when they came into town. Everyone raved about how delicious the sandwich was. Needless to say, it's a recipe I use all the time now.

Delicious sandwich! I never serve anything to company that I have not preformed a test run on, but based on the reviews of this one, I took a chance. The only change I made was pureed sundried tomatoes in place of the artichoke hearts, which complimented the mayo/pesto combination. I also brined my chicken prior to grilling it, which made it incredibly juicy. To brine chicken: For each cup of water, add 1 tablespoon of salt. (You can also add dried herbs to the salted water). Add chicken, cover, and refrigerate for one hour. As several reviewers, I too, grilled the ciabatta bread.

One of the BEST sandwiches my fiance and I have ever had! We don't like foccacia so we used crusty italian bread which made things quite messy (though they would have been anyway) - but man, was it worth it!! We used white sharp cheddar only because we didn't have fresh mozerella, home grown tomatoes and basil to make homemade pesto. Used the extra basil mayo for our regular deli sandwiches we make to work - kicked those up a notch! Would make again with softer roll or ciabata, but not for guests - my man and I were a bit too messy eating it, but if you can't enjoy good food with loved ones, what's the point?!? ; )

This is a very adaptable recipe. I had to use the cheese we had on hand (muenster) but I did have fresh, homemade pesto. I needed to use up some leftover roast chicken, and this was a perfect recipe. My husband and I split one 4x6 sandwich, and it was plenty. The flavors melded wonderfully; we'll make it again for sure.

This is sooo good. The pesto/mayo makes the sandwich. Used Jersey tomatoes instead of the plum tomato. A bit messier, but why use another tomato if Jersey tomatoes are in season? They are the best. Excellent recipe if you are having company for lunch or a light dinner.

I agree this is an awesome sandwich. Like one of the previous cooks I grilled the bread after brushing with olive oil. Then I rubbed it with a garlic clove. It was a worthy addition. I forgot the cheese on the first batch and added it on the second. It was delicious both ways. It will be on my regular meal rotation.

Probably the best sandwich I've ever had! I brushed the bread lightly with olive oil and grilled it too. Can't wait to make it again.

This is just excellent. So full of flavors and textures. I used provolone because I had it already. I sliced a store-bought roasted chicken because I needed it for another recipe. So this was a bonus meal. This makes a big sandwich - I was glad we used a lighter Portugese roll for it instead of the heavier bread. I may try substituting roasted red pepper for the tomato next time.

This was one of the best snadwiches I have ever made. My husband and daughter want it again tonight. I used fresh pesto which I had made and the fresh flavor was evident. I wouldn't change a thing!

I've had this sandwich at The Farm (a really neato place, park-like setting, fun to take kids) and it was delish. Their sandwiches are huge so 2 adults could split one if you're having soup,too.
