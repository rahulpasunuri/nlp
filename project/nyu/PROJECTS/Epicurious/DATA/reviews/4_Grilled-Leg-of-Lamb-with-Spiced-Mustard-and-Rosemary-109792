I made this for my boyfriend who loves lamb. It was the first meal I made for him, and it was a total hit! I marinated it the night before and then grilled it the next day. The rosemary and mustard complemented the lamb perfectly. I'm not a huge fan of lamb, and it tasted awesome. I highly recommend this for a fairly easy, but big impact meal!

This is an amazing lamb dish, and one of the few I have found that do not include garlic. My only disappointment wwas that my vision of leftovers disappeared as the meat flew off the plate! Everyone raved about it...even people who weren't sure they liked lamb. Defintely a keeper.

Wow!!! I am not a huge lamb fan but this was amazing. Prepared this for our annual end of summer barbecue for 25 people and everyone raved about it. Marinated it overnight and it cooked beautifully on the grill, just be sure to keep an eye on the temperature of the grill so it doesn't burn. I couldn't find any Guldens mustard (maybe not available in Canada?) so ended up using French's horseradish mustard and it worked fine.

This is one of the tastiest lamb recipes I've ever made! Good balance of sweet/spicy (I add a little extra spice and apple juice, little less mustard, and some garlic). It can marinate from 1-3 days and pleases anyone who likes food that's not bland.

Absolutely the most tender and flavorful lamb I have ever made. Got raves!

It was an excellent choice. Because I could not find it, I had to substitute the cardammon for a mix of curry and cumin powder, which gave it an incredible aroma, and taste. I did with a Leg of New Zealand lamb (with the bone), and it came out great. The only downside was that the fat flavor was too strong. Next time I will clean it much more. 4/5 Stars...!!

Very nice. Definitely keep track of the temperature and serve rare to medium-rare.

It was a bit sweet. The underlying mix of spices was good, but the sweetness from the concentrated juice was overpowering. We would eat it again, but we have made several other lamb marinades that are superior. I would consider using a similar mi of spices, but would replace the juice concentrate and vinegar with white wine and apple juice. This should reduce the sweetness.

My family claims that this is the best lamb they have ever tasted! It was so easy to prepare and cooking on the barbeque added an awsome flavor to it. I will definitely make it again.

This is the ONLY way to eat lamb as far as I'm concerned. Even my three kids loved it (once they got past the whole cute, fuzzy animal part). A keeper!

This is my favorite lamb recipe to date. I put all the marinade ingredients, along with the lamb, in a zip top bag and allowed it to marinate for 3 days, as our dinner plans kept changing! Everyone thought the lamb was wonderful and I would make this recipe again and again.
