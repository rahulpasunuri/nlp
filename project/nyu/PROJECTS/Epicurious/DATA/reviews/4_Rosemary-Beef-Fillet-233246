WOW!!! I made as directed, takes the meat awhile to come to room temp but its worth it meat was perfect medium rare and so tender and flavorful. I did tie the meat the night before and let it sit salted overnight in fridge uncovered on a rack. Had for Christmas eve with mashed potatoes and english peas. Made a red wine shallot gravy to go with yum!!!

I've made this several times and always to great results. It does take a tad longer than indicated but not much if you make sure you bring the meat to room temp before searing. Easy and delicious

Good recipe and easy to make. I made this over the weekend and all the guests thoroughly enjoyed the meal. After searing I cooked for 20min in the oven and came out perfect. I did not use string but instead pierced the meat with the rosemary which worked wonders. I will be making this again

This is dish is absolutely wonderful! It is my no fail meal for entertaining that gets rave reviews every time! Simple to prepare, delish and elegant. I make it with rosemary roasted potatoes. What is the Spicy Garlic and Lemon Crusted Shrimp dish? I can't find the recipe on Epicurious...

Used a trimmed, deboned rib roast rather than fillet accompanied by scalloped potatoes with rosemary and brussels sprouts with chestnuts. Served with a 1988 Chateau Gruaud Larose Saint Julien. Wonderful meal.

A wonderfully uncomplicated recipe that made a terrific Sunday meal with leftovers for several lunches. One thing that the recipe could emphasize is that the surprising combination of rosemary and mustard works extremely well together.

This was fantastic and easy to prepare. Even the leftovers are a hit! I made two at once and cooked them in the same pan, they were delicious.

This one got rave reviews from my family for Christmas - made along with the Panko Crusted Scallops with Wasabi dipping sauce and the Spicy Garlic and Lemon Crusted Shrimp - all three dishes complimented each other

Phenomenal - For a 3.5 pound roast: If you allow it to come to room temperature, sear the outsides, cook for 30 minutes and let rest 15 minutes per the recipe, the results are outstanding!!! The meat is quite expensive ($92 in NYC), but was among the most tender, juicy, buttery, and most perfect pieces of meat my girlfriend and I have tasted. We would not have raved so much based on the amount we spent if this recipe was not spot on! Maybe the cook in the UK did not allow the meat to come to room temperature, did not sear the meat, did not allow it to rest after cooking, was using the wrong cut of meat or simply mistyped the cooking time tried, but we will make this dish on many a special holiday for years to come

Having done this T-Loin roast many times - mostly on the grill. My father-in-law would test doneness by time and firmness feel (25 Min gets in the ball park)...I use a digital thermometer and shoot for 110 degrees and let rest covered for 10 - 15 or until the family pressure gets to great..

This is to Colincox in the UK: This should only take 25-35 minutes total cooking time. Use a meat thermometer to check for doneness. 20 minutes per pound will give you a burnt mess! Hope you got this note in time.

Even though I haven't tried this yet (I'm going to make it tomorrow for Christmas dinner for the family) I know it's going to work. However, surely the cooking instructions should be in minutes per pound and not just in total minutes since 25 mins is not enough for 3.5 lbs? In my opinion, it is too much per lb. and I'll be doing mine for 20 minutes per lb. for a properly rare result.
