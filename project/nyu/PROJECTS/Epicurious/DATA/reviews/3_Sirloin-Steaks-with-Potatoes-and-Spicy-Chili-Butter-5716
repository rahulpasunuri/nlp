Adored it! I didn't have any jalepenos on hand but cayenne pepper was absoluately fantastic. Make sure to let the potatoes get slightly crispy. All around YUM! I was so sad when it was over.

The potatos were overly thick and somewhat dry although the caramelized onions and parsley enlivened the flavor. I would cut them to 1/4 inch and cook in a mixture of chili butter and chili oil , approx. 5-6 tbsps. total. The syeaks also need some additional punch- perhaps some cajun seasoning for extra flavor.
