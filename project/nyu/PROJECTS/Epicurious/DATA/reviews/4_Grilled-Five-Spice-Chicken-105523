so great! I was gonna skip the dipping sauce but decided to make it at the last minute and boy am I glad I did. The recipe is okay on own but I think the combination with the dipping sauce makes it exceptional. I used skinless breast chicken pounded thin.

Delicious! I used chicken breasts, boneless, skinless and broiled in the oven.

Just made this recipe again this week and forgot just how delicious it is. Have given it to all my friends as it is so easy. I just marinate chicken breasts, skin on, and they are the best. Also the soy- lime dipping sauce is great. I make an asian salad to go with the sauce and chicken.

I was a little skeptical about this chicken after making the marinade ahead of time and tasting it. I feared that the five spice and anise flavors were too strong. But, when prepared, this chicken is FANTASTIC. I served it to guests who all seemed to enjoy it, and several raved and wanted the recipe. The biggest test was my husband, who isn't a huge fan of grilled chicken, but he couldn't say enough about this dish and even opted for seconds of it over the ribs that were also served. The only change I made was using only thighs and drumsticks as I prefer them on the grill. I would not recommend marinating it any longer than 4 hours as I'm betting the chicken skin would get flabby and fail to crisp. The dipping sauce is a delicious accompaniment.

This is one of those EASY go-to recipes for great-tasting chicken (provided you have the time for marinating). We did so for almost 6 hours - I bet it would have been even better if it were longer. I made my own 5-spice powder - never done that before so I wonder if it perhaps need a bit more "punch". I was cautioned away from overdoing this spice. The dipping sauce is GREAT - almost skipped it but it looked so tasty and easy that I decided to make it at the last second. My husband tends to grill the chicken longer than necessary so it was a welcome addition! Will def have this in regular rotation this summer, I'm sure!

Marinated a whole cut up chicken for about 5-6 hours and it was completely fantastic. Definitely worthy of serving to guests. We served it with some steamed chinese long beans. The sauce adds flavor and some nice heat! Make this now.

3.5 Stars Very simple to make and very tasty even tho I only marinated it for 2 hours or so. Instead of using a whole chicken, I used thin skinless/boneless chicken breasts for faster cook time. I grilled on my grill pan 4-5 minutes on each side and it came out perfectly! Moist and flavorful. Served with rice pilaf. Will make again.

I had some boneless chicken thighs that my wife bought. This recipe was perfect for them, with a small substitution of fish sauce instead of the sea salt. I skipped the star anise powder and still got raves.

okay, this was awesome. Just make it. I suggest grilling the chicken over indirect medium heat for 30 minutes, turning once. Slow, even. Also make the dipping sauce.

Outstanding. Served at two dinner parties and guests raved. Don't skip on the soy lime sauce and and marinate chicken night before. Served with a Thai-style salad of cucumbers, carrots, red pepper, jicama, nuoc cham, etc; jasmine rice, and grilled asparagus tossed in some soy, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil.

One of the most delicious, easy recipes posted on this site. The soy lime dipping sauce is a great accompaniment. Just be careful not to splash the chicken marinade on any surfaces - the spices stained my counter yellow.

Try this recipe with flank steak. It is equally delicious. Cross hatch cut the steak, marinate 24 hours, grill to medium rare (2 minutes a side), slice thinly across the grain. Don't omit the star anise!

wow, this recipe is fantastic - since we enjoy spicy food i added 3T of asian chili paste - for a variation, i used whole skinless chicken breast, sliced and cooked it on moderately high heat in a dutch oven - what a great combination of flavors...

Delicious! Unique wonderful flavors. Marinated overnight and used boneless skinless and cooked under broiler. As others I served with coconut rice and asparagus with wasabi sauce - yummy. If you are looking for something different you have got to try this!

This is part of my regular rotation -- even the kids love it! I usually marinate overnite -- it really makes a difference and just broil it rather than grill. Also, I skip the last bit where you coat the marinated chicken with roasted star anise powder. Serve with sticky rice and some lightly steamed veggies.

Rating: 3
This recipe is excellent (eventhough I omitted the anise--a key ingredient). The chicken is full flavored and did not need the soy lime dipping sauce (which I found too tart). I used skin-on breasts and marinated them in a ziplock for the afternoon. Good for a summer party.

Sorry, the vegetable is fennel not celeriac.

Star Anise is a star shaped spice ( a seed pod) that you will find in the spice section of your local supermarket. The vegetable is celeriac and has an anise flavor it is delicious sliced and roasted in the oven with tomatoes or eaten raw in a salad. Hope this helps

Pardon my ignorance, but I asked my Asian grocer about "star anice" and he introduced me to a large bulb with fennel weed growing out the top. Is this what I'm supposed to dry out in 3 minutes and then grind to powder?

I rarely review recipes, but this one was so surprisingly delicious that I had to add my two cents. It has a strong Vietnamese flavor and it's easy to make. I found it refreshingly different from standard western-style grilled chicken recipes. I left the chicken (bone-in breasts) in the marinade for about 36 hours, and it was absolutely fantastic. Served with an Asian cucumber salad and sticky Thai rice with peanut sauce. A real winner.

Always a fabulous crowd pleaser. Everyone raves about this dish. I add a little of the dipping sauce to some oil and vinegar to make a dressing for a side salad. Yummy!

I marinated in a ziploc with skinless thighs. used star anise seeds, added about 30min before cooking in oven convec bake 335, roughly 45 min. served with coco rice, made dipping with kikkoman soy sauce. very good as a meal or an appetizer.

Over the winter I made this recipe using chicken tenders and broiling briefly. Just made on the grill using skinless boneless breasts. Wonderful both times...the dipping sauce is to die for...especially with enough thai bird chiles.....served with coconut rice and asparagus. Both times I didn't use the whole amount of oil for marinade....maybe about half or 2/3. This is a keeper..quick to make (and quick to eat).

Fantastic! I make Japanese and Chinese recipes quite a bit, but this was my first Vietnamese recipe. Now I want to buy the cookbook. Delicious blend of spices. I doubled the soy-lime dipping sauce and poured it over the chicken and rice. My husband adored it!

Rating: 3
This was wonderful. My husband loved it. We didn't grind the star anise to a fine powder and it made a kind of crust on the chicken which we liked. The dipping sauce was just okay on the first day but got much better the next day. I will definitely make it again.

Another 4 stars: Couldn't find the star anise, but everything else was easy to find. I made this on the request of my 12-year old who decided she wanted to try Vietnamese food. We loved it so much, we're going to try some more Vietnamese recipes.

Very good recipe. Chicken needs to sit in marinade overnite for best results. Same for the Soy Lime dipping sauce. I find the flavours combine nicely if made a day ahead.

I took the leftover chicken to a picnic and served it atop curried couscous with vegetables and fresh spinach in a salad. Everyone who tasted it loved it. It's a definite do-again.

This was very nice. I am fond of the grilled chicken at many of the Vietnamese restaurants I've been to, and this really tasted exactly like their chicken! The lime-soy dipping sauce was decent, but I needed it more for the noodles than the chicken. Along w/ the chicken, I made this dish w/ grilled tofu & tempeh (for my Veg. girlfriend)-- both turned out well.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I can't never make an ethnic dish taste quite the same as the restaurant version but this was an exception. I had time to marinate the chicken for about an hour but it didn't seem to matter. I served it with rice noodles and snow peas (poured a little of the dipping sauce on it). Yumm!

This dish was to die for! I marinated the chicken for 24+ hours, addding the star anise from the beginning. We grilled skinless boneless breasts and bone-in thighs and drumsticks, thinking the bone-in would be the best. All pieces were so tender and delicious! It didn't even need the dipping sauce, but the addition of it made it over the top! This is a keeper for sure, and so easy.

I cooked the chicken in a ridged grill pan on top of the stove. It took about 35 minutes, longer than suggested, but turned out well.

This is a very quick, easy recipe with surprising flavor. The soy lime dipping sauce is key. Made again last night with pork tenderloin-delicious.

Wow! So much flavor! I doubled the marinade and used chicken breasts (with bone and skin). The soy-lime dipping sauce was so wonderfully spicy. I took this to our annual block party--we did "celebrate our diversity" and everyone picked a country's cuisine. I did Vietnam (we adopted our boys from Vietnam). I've had serveral families request this recipe!

Incredible combination of flavors. The ginger, lime, garlic and anise worked so well together. I will probably use a little less water (more like 1/8 cup than 1/4) in the dipping sauce next time, but that's just preference. It was excellent.

I read all of the reviews for this recipe and still, for whatever reason, felt a little wary. I was worried for nothing. It was absolutely divine. I had no trouble finding all the ingredients and in the end, my guests raved about the chicken - and the dipping sauce. My only suggestion ... on your table have a big pitcher of icy-cold water with sliced lemons to quench the thirst caused by the salty soya sauce. A real winner!

Unique Flavors. Made for 10 people at a football Tailgate Party. Even the "plain Eaters" loved it. You have to make the dipping sauce. Its what makes this a four forker.

Delicious! I used 4 lbs of thighs for a crowd, and had plenty of marinade to do the job. I broiled rather than grilled, and got a great crust. For the dipping sauce, I used pablano chiles (aboout 1/4 of a large one). I also added about 1 1/2 tbsp minced ginger and ground it in with the paste use din teh dipping sauce.

Delicious, easy, and low fat! Used boneless-skinless chicken breasts, and marinated them overnight. Grilled them 5 min. per side and served them with the dipping sauce, also excellent, and coconut rice. Also served the asparagus with wasabi sauce, only made broccoli instead of asparagus and served it hot. All in all, a wonderful asian meal!

Made with skinned breasts and thighs, this recipe was a hit at a party. The marinade is intense and produces a memorable flavor, even though I couldn't find star anise and left it out! The turmeric adds color as well as taste. I've since found star anise and will make it again soon, as the developer intended.

This was a lot of trouble to go to for an average-tasting dish. The ingredients are too varied to allow the five-spice flavor to shine through. If you are interested in something simpler (and better) all you have to do is to marinade some chicken (cleaned and pat dry) in a mixture of three tablespoons of five-spice and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, for several hours or overnight. Then place chicken on a wire rack and roast it. Serve with garlic-flavored rice. You won't regret it.

This dish was yummy, and my boyfriend really enjoyed it. I'd maybe make it again sometime in the future if the mood struck me, but it will not become part of the "regulars." But worth trying!

Delicious! Like the Stanford cook, I don't often cook the same thing twice; but I'm cooking this for the second time in a month (too many other recipes to try - so that's really saying something!. Last time I served them with (parboiled) panfried Kumara and poured the dipping sauce on some broccoli (the chicken itself doesn't need it). A delicious complexity of flavours that all are sure to enjoy.

I used this marinade on quails (marinated overnight in ziploc bags) and grilled them on a BBQ. I served them with plain sticky rice which turned out to be the perfect thing to soak up the juice. I did not make the sauce which we didn't miss at all. Three generations of very finicky (Vietnamese) eaters gobbled them up. My father even asked me for the recipe (a first.)

Well, I thought this was a fabulous recipe - though I have to admit I adjusted the marinade quantities to suit my own tastes (added a lot more 5-Spice and Tumeric). The Soy-Lime Sauce I doubled, and it all disappeared! This was so easy to make - everyone raved about it, and I would definately make it again! (PS: the flavour develops beautifully, so make more than you need and use the leftover chicken the next day in a salad - absolutely brilliant!)

I had no fresh ginger so I used two teaspoons of dried and the same for dried minced garlic. I did use whole stars. Anyway it was great and my wife who does not eat leftovers went right for them the next day. I'll look forward to using fresh stuff next time. Also we enjoyed the recommended sauce and soaked it up with rice.

I've been experimenting with Southeast Asian cuisine for the past two years, and found this to be a superlative marinade which I've used twice this week with great results - first on skinless chicken thighs and drumsticks, and then on boneless breast. Grilling with long indirect heat (25 minutes) for the chicken on the bone, and quicker (10 minutes) direct heat for the boneless breasts, both versions retained their juiciness and rich flavor. My only modification was to reduce the amound of oil by half, and to use already powdered star anise. We dipped in a favorite ginger-lime dipping sauce from "The Best of Vietnamese & Thai Cooking", but no dipping sauce is really required. Leftovers made a delicious cold salad plate when sliced atop a bed of Thai cabbage salad (also from the aofrementioned cookbook). This has become an instant family favorite,
