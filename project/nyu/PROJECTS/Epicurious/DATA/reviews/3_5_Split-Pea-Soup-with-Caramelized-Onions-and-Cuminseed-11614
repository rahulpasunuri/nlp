I've made this soup following the recipe exactly and it was good, but I decided to kick it up a bit using some of the suggestions of others as well as my own. I like my soup a bit thicker so used 2 cups broth/1 cup water. I added a chipotle pepper which kicked it up a notch. After I sauteed the onions and put them in the blender, I sauteed some butternut squash and new potatoes I got at the farmers market and added them to the pureed soup....it was fabulous!! I served it with a sliced apple, fresh bread and cheese, also from the farmers market. A simple and delicious meal!! My meat and potatoes man loved it.....yay!

I love this recipe! It is so easy to make and it's perfect for when you're stuck without much in the way of groceries. I tried adding carrots to the mix but found it didn't really improve it, in fact it made it kind of bland (everyone else loved it but I found it lacking). The next time I tried it, instead of carrots, I added about 2 cups of corn and it was absolutely amazing! And since this recipe doesn't have meat in it, it's great for vegetarians if you substitute the chicken broth for vegetable broth (still just as yummy!).

This soup is absolutely delicious and very healthy. If you love Cumin, I would recommend adding an additional 1/2 tsp of cumin powder to the onions. I also used fresh basil for a stronger flavor. When I make this recipe again I will double it so that there is more left over!

I'm dumbfounded as to how this is so good. I chose this recipe solely because it did not require leaving the house and shopping. I didn't have a bay leaf on hand, but added just a bit of adobo sauce (that comes in a can of chipotles), and it is so good. Really good. Really surprising. And it must cost about 50 cents to make. Whoo hoo!

I make this frequently and always add a dried chipotle (whole) and carrot, plus extra cumin seed to the onions.

i felt like once i was finished, the soup was an excellent split pea base for any accent spice flavor over it. i went for some minced chipotle chilis, just enough to add background smoky spice. but i like the idea of parmesan that someone else mentioned too.

I carmelized the onions in batches -- half-rings sauteed until almost crispy, with diced thrown in during the last few minutes -- so there was a nice mix of sweet & sharp. Also, added some ham for an old-fashioned touch & a dash or 2 of Annie's vegetarian Worchestershire sauce for a bit of pungency to lift the flavor. It all rounded out quite nicely.

Great easy recipe! Add parmesean cheese if you like it.

I have made this soup several times. The recipe is delicious made exactly the way it is written. The cumin seed gives it a very interesting flavor. I made this again today and added diced ham at the very end. Next time I may take other reviewers suggestions and add carrot.

I found this super-easy to make, and loved the recipe, but with two caviats: (1) I think onions caramelize better over a fairly low heat, especially when you have 35 minutes to bring out their best flavor, and (2) because I like a thicker textured slpit-pea soup, I'd use 1 1/2 cups split peas next time. The base of this soup was on the thin side for pea soup (or, my stock did not cook off enough). The flavor though, was spot-on.

Quite simply one of the best soups I've ever had, and easily made veggie (lazily substituted vegetable bouillon powder for the chicken stock). Didn't have basil or bay leaf, so instead used fresh tarragon and dried thyme. I know it was just a last-minute sub, but I can't imagine any flavor working better than the fresh tarragon -- just divine. Also added 3 cloves of garlic and 2 small carrots to onions, used a potato masher on the peas for a minute rather than bother with the blender and added a knob of butter at the end for a little extra richness. Caught my (carnivore) boyfriend licking the ladle.

The carmelized onions are the reason for making this soup! Add croutons made from diced good bread and you ar set. I made the recipe as written, but I think I would have preferred it without the basil; perhaps thyme and marjoram as another reviewer suggested. Next time I'll definitely use the carrots.

This is a really great recipe. I tossed in some old lentils I had in the cupboard in addition to the split peas, and used veggie broth in place of chicken. It turned out a bit muddy in color, but the flavor is fantastic. Don't skip the onions -- they make the dish.

I'm not a huge pea soup lover, but this was a very good and very easy recipe. I followed other reviewers' comments and used a hamhock and some pieces of ham in the soup, as well as carmelizing carrots and garlic with the onions. Definitely worth doubling and freezing.

Wonderful, hearty soup for a rainy day in Southern California...yes, it does rain here! I made a few changes. First, used a whole bag of split peas, 4 c chicken broth, 2 c water. I love the flavor of smoked ham hock in pea soup, so added that, then took it out at the end, cooled, shredded and added back to the pot. Also, added 2 chopped carrots and 2 chopped garlic cloves to the onions and carmelized. I was out of cuminseed, so used powdered cumin, and rather than basil, I used thyme and marjoram...just a personal preference for split pea soup. This is a thick soup, which I like, but you can thin it with water or more chicken broth to your own taste. Very yummy! Thanks Epicurious and fellow chefs!

Delicious! This soup is so easy to prepare and the result is fabulous. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added a couple of carrots with the onions and deglazed the onion pan with balsamic vinegar. A definite keeper!

I make this all the time for supper on busy nights, both as originally written and with my own variations. I prefer thyme to basil. It even works if you underestimate the amount of peas in your cupboard and throw in some lentils (different but still good, with the caramelized onions being key).

Quick and easy soup that tasted like it had been simmering all day. Definitely NOT watery. I added some carrots and diced smoked turkey along with the onions but it would have been hearty enough without the meat.

I am eating this soup as I write this. From all the other reviewers, I thought this was worth a go and everyone was right! I doubled the recipe (no sense in having no leftovers with soup) and am glad I did. I took a couple of other reviewers suggestions... added 2 carrots to be caramelized with the onions, deglazed the onion pan with some balsamic vinegar, added a potato 3/4 of the way through the cooking and I also added about a 1/4 cup of dry sherry during the last 20 minutes. It's sooo yummy! Thick and satisfying. Defintely try this one.

I'm so glad Epicurious is adding the old recipes. This recipe made me look good 9 years ago when it first appeared in Gourmet when I had no idea what I was doing. I've learned a lot since then and am still making this winner.

Hey Atlanta! Thanks for a great review. You write like a professional food writer. I am going to try this on the strength of your beautiful description!

This was okay, but not very exciting. I usually really like split pea soups, but this one was thin and watery and the flavors just didn't seem to meld. Cumin and onions are big favorites around here, but they were a bit strange and overpowering compared to the watery split peas. We ate it, but nobody was interested in the leftovers. I certainly would not make it again.

As a vegetarian, I was a bit wary when my meat-eating boyfriend asked me to make him split pea soup. I was sure that without the ham cock, the soup just wouldn't be flavorful enough. I was wrong! This is a great recipe--I added a diced carrot to caramelize with the onions, and added a dash of red wine to deglaze the pan near the end of the caramlizing process; I aso used a light vegetable broth in place of the chicken stock + water. But even without these changes, I bet the recipe would be great--homey, satisfying, and with the simple earthy flavor of split peas set off by the sweet richness of the caramelized onions.

This was fantastic! I followed the advice above -added red wine and a dash of smoked chipolte pepper (could not find a dried one) which helped give the soup a deeper flavor without the meat.

This was really very good. I added some ham left over from an office potluck and that made it delicious! I think it needs more pepper, or maybe a dash of tabasco to give it a little kick, and when we did that, it was great! A wonderful soup to come home to after a brisk day outside!

This was really wonderful! I, too, added carrots and a potato and used fresh basil. No need to puree, just let it cook! The caramelized onion added a great smoky flavor.

Wow, this was really delicious. My spouse, who was unenthusiastic about split pea soup (we are vegetarians, and I have made another far less exciting version of split pea soup a few times before) devoured the stuff. I increased the recipe by about half, and we had a surprisingly small amount left over after just one meal for the two of us. I made a few changes - used a quick vegetable stock which cooked while I chopped things for the soup and soaked the peas. I also added a couple finely diced carrots with the peas and a diced potato partway through the cooking (didn't want it to turn to mush). I caramelized the onions in part butter/part oil, and added about 1/2 c. of red wine to the onions after they were partly cooked, which added some richness to the final product. One good addition - a dried chipotle pepper thrown in with the peas and everything while cooking, then removed; this adds the smokiness you expect in split pea soup and a bit of heat which complements the cumin. Finally, I didn't puree the soup - just let it cook good and long (at least 1 1/2 hours) to let the peas break down completely, I think split pea soup is much better this way than pureed. This is just a delicious, easy, healthy soup, and a combination of flavors I wouldn't have thought of on my own.

Great recipe for a easy and quick soup. I added some baby carrots with the split peas for a bit more depth in flavour.

Excellent. The first vegetarian pea soup I've ever liked (I used all water, no broth). Make sure to really caramelize the onions -- cover them loosely in a cast iron skillet to make easy work of it. Also substituted fresh basil, which I added in the blender.

This soup was easy and delicious. I added 3 large carrots diced and caramelized them along with the onions.

For such an easy recipe, this is just too good. I took some advice from another reviewer and carmelized some carrots with the onions. Also, I blended a couple of roasted garlic cloves with the peas for an extra depth of flavor since I used vegetable in stead of chicken stock. The result after pureeing was so wonderfully thick, I thinned it down with more roasted vegetable stock (after adding the onions and carrots) and let the flavors meld for a few minutes on low heat. I have a big smile on my face after having downed more than my fair share and a couple of glasses of wine.

This is a great variation on the split-pea theme. I prepared it exactly as the recipe directs and it was delicious (the caramelized onions and cumin add a lot). My picky seven-year-old had seconds!

It's very important to brown (caramelize) the onion properly. The last time I made this soup I was in a hurry and did not put attention to the onion. It tasted completely different. I also added some fresh rosemary which went wery well with the split pea. A touch of butter at the end (one or two tablespoons) also heighten the soup.

A great variation on the standard split-pea soup. Just as easy to prepare, and the caramelized onions with cuminseed really add a lot of savory flavor. Will make again!

Excellent soup. I too used ground cumin and added lots of black pepper. Don't leave out the onions- they make the soup extra tasty.

This is a fantastic vegetarian split-pea soup recipe. I use ground cumin and add diced carrots with the onions, caramelizing them at a much lower temperature for a longer period of time.

I regularly make this for a light dinner. I enjoy it, but I do have problems properly caramelizing onions. I have read so many technics for this, and this recipe doesn't really indicate how to do this.
