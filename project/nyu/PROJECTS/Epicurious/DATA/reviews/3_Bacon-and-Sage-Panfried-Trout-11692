I didn't wrap any bacon on it at all, I only put bacon on the inside. I pinned the fish together with some toothpicks and fried it with a dusting of cornmeal. I used the bacon fat for frying and cooked the fish on the stovetop (just covered the pan for a couple mins). Effortless. It was an effective use of my leftover bacon.

I don't think I would make this again. Boyfriend made this one night and although it was good, it wasn't spectacular. We thought the recipe was a bit cumbersome. If I were to make this again, we would omit the cornmeal procedure as it just made a mess and we would omit the wrapping the bacon around the trout. I think the bacon filling with the sage gives the fish enough flavour. Instead, we would season the outside of the fish with good salt and pepper and pan fry until completely cooked and omit the oven part.

Boyfriend tried this recipe without reading the reviews first. I definately agree that it is a bit cumbersome for not a very spectacular outcome. It was good, but not great. Using the bacon and the toothpicks made it hard to flip the trout in the pan. If I were to personalize this recipe, I would omit the cornmeal and just season the outside of the trout with good salt and pepper. Probably don't need to bake the fish, as pan frying should be able to cook the trout through in a relativly short time.

I make this dish once or twice a year. It is overly complicated as written. First, wrapping the trout in partially cooked bacon adds mess and makes it hard to flip the fish when sauteeing it. I stuff the trout with bacon but skip the bacon on the outside. Second, the recipe uses too many pans. Like the cook in Houston, I fry the bacon and the fish in an oven-proof skillet (cast-iron, in my case) and put that directly in the oven. If you are making four trout, they fit fine in a large skillet if you cut off the heads and tails. Tastes great. Grilling is an interesting idea. If I did that, I would probably go back to the bacon on the outside to help hold the fish together.

I have tried this one. I prefer to do this one on a grill (charcol or gas). try to use fresh fish and herbs.Yes bacon is FAT.Use a peppered bacon!!! Lightly saute bacon to wrap trout, have it to over-lap. Coat fish with olive oil. Otherwise follow the recipe. You can also enclose this in a foil package and grill for 12- 15 minutes.It's a sure winner! And much easier to do if doing more than two fish.

Very good. This has become a "regular" in our Kitchen. Easy to make, as far as the bacon is concern I use a lower fat no nitrates bacon. Do cut on the amount and choose a good quality bacon the result should be a very good trout dish.

OK so I haven't actually made this dish, but I just had to comment that it sounds exactly like what Tommy Lee Jones' character was cooking in "The Missing". And I thought it looked pretty good when he was making it, out in the wild -- just bacon, trout and sage. That's how I would cook it, easing up on the amount of bacon for health reasons and cutting out the cornmeal.

This just didn't do it for me. It was a little messy and time-consuming for the unexciting product. My husband and I always refer to bacon as a "cheater" ingredient - it makes everything taste so good that you can't claim to be a good cook if all you do is add a lot of it to a recipe. This one proved our adage wrong.

This was a great trout dish. I used the bacon grease from the second frying to cook the trout in and did both the frying and the baking in a seasoned iron pan. I didn't think it was too greasy (though it seemed like a lot of bacon). Maybe the corn meal and skin absorbed a lot of it. Very easy and tasty..

I took others' recommendation and fried the fish in the bacon grease. Boy, was this good. Both husband and I ate every morsel. It's simple and inexpensive.

I thought this dish was perfect! The bacon and sage went great with the trout. For extra flavor, I even fried the fish in the bacon grease instead of the olive oil. I would definately make this again.

The bacon on the outside of the trout made this a little greasy for my taste, and the bacon on the inside didn't complement the delicate fish very well. The sage did go well with the trout, so I may make this again without the bacon.
