I made these and some Ham and Watercress Crepes (also from epicurious) for a party, thinking that the crepes would be the first to go. However, these sandwiches disappeared in about 10mins and I got several requests for the recipe. I salted the radishes ever so slightly and added just a squish more anchovy paste than called for in the recipe. The party was yesterday and I am already bringing more butter to room temperature in order to make this again.

I prepared the sandwiches exactly as directed and these were delightful! Great texture and flavor. They were fine sitting in the fridge for 2 hours.

I didn't want sandwiches so I modified this recipe to be little appetizer bites. I could have used a little more anchovy paste in the butter. I cut the bread into 1 1/2 inch squares. I did this ahead and kept them in a plastic bag in the refrigerator. I also sliced the radishes ahead and put them in a small jar with the juics of two limes. This turned the radishes a pretty shade of pink and added a little citrus taste. Assembly was easy. Spread the anchovy butter on the bite-size bread. Top with radishes. Sprinkle with coarse sea salt and some chopped parsley. Guests LOVED it. Be sure to leave the anchovy butter at room temperature so it spreads easily.

An excellent combination. I added lime juice and salted the radishes just before serving. A fresh, crisp, tastebud tantilizer!
