This is a great simple recipe. I took others' advice and added garlic, thyme and tomato paste. Because I love spicy food, I also added some red pepper flakes toward the end. This is a dish that you can really play with, adding ingredients or completely changing them. I highly recommend it for those wanting a quick tasty pasta dish, especially those who aren't experienced cooks. It's fool-proof!

I also added garlic and thyme along with chicken broth and whipping cream for a sauce. Served on rice which was fine. This is a really good "neutral" recipe...meaning everyone likes it, just simple flavors, nothing too spicy or dominating. Good recipe to vary herbs, veggies, meat...whatever's on hand.

I read the other reviews and added garlic, tomato paste, thyme and oregano along w/ chicken stock and it was very tasty.

this was good--sort of like a fall pasta "primavera" (i realize that's a bit of an oxymoron). i don't usually comment when i make substitutions, but i wanted to agree with the person who suggested tomato paste. i added 1 tbsp after caramelizing the onions and squash, before adding the broth. i also used a little more broth than the recipe calls for to make it a bit saucier. had some grape tomatoes that needed to be used, so i tossed those in with the chicken, and finished it all off with a little grated parm. was good with whole-wheat pasta.

My husband and I liked this and will make it again for a good weeknight dinner, but I am glad I followed other reviewers' suggestions, adding garlic, thyme, basil and a splash of white wine for more flavor. I also recommend finishing it with about 1 tablespoon of good tomato paste.

This was a very good recipe. I agree with other viewers that it needs some more spices. I used bonless chicken breast that I sauted in olive oil and garlic first, removed then cooked squash as directed. I added salt, pepper, and tyme to the squash and onion, and a splash of wine as another review suggested. THe squash adds a sweet flavor to this dish. Different, but a great change from other pasta dishes. I will make again.

I'm cooking for a very health conscious bunch these days... and they gave it a thumbs up! i also threw the broccoli in with the onion and squash, which had 2 cloves of chopped garlic added to it. But the big plus for this dish was using the lo-carb pasta - made from soy flour. i used about half as much as called for, it added a nice pasta texture, very little "bad" carbs and a bit more protein! This is definitely a re-do, and that's saying a lot in this house!

I've been making this recipe since it appeared in Bon Appetit and I love it! The only change I make is putting the rabe in with the caramelized onion and squash (make sure they're well caramelized to concentrate the flavor) at the end until cooked (10 min?) rather than in with the pasta. I think this may make the sauce more flavorful. Sometimes I end up eating it without the pasta like a stew. Delicious!

Looking for something to do with our Halloween pumpkin, we decided to try this recipe. After reading some of the comments, I revised my recipe to include fresh garlic, thyme, nutmeg and ginger, and removed the broccoli rabe; my family asked I serve it over rice instead of the pasta. I also sprinkled pumpkin seeds over it that the kids toasted while I was making dinner. We enjoyed it with these minor changes. Even my ten year old said it was good!

I made a variation of this recipe last night. I used spinach instead of broccoli rabe because that is what I had, I agree with one of the other reviewers, you do have to kick it up a notch. I add two more tablespoons of oil and sliced garlic very thin and lightly browned it and removed it, I used fresh boneless chicken breast because that was what was on hand, I cut into large bite size pieces and browned in the oil, removed and set aside and then added the onions and squash, sprinkled with dried thyme and continued to cook as directed, adding a splash of wine and adding spinach the last 7 minutes of cooking and added it to the pasta and let sit for 5 minutes. My 15 year old raved, he ate two helpings, the garlic really helps!

Broccoli Rabe is also sometimes called Rapini. It's a slightly bitter green that looks sort of like broccoli crossed with asparagus - with longer stalks and looser florets than broccoli. It's not available in all grocery stores - try an upscale grocery like Fresh Fields in northern VA.

Can someone tell me what broccoli rabe is? Forgive me ignorance, but I don't know!

I liked the concept and presentation of this dish but it REALLY lacked flavor. I added tons of cumin and chili pepper and it still was very bland and dry. I would recommend adding sour cream at the end also to give it more moisture
