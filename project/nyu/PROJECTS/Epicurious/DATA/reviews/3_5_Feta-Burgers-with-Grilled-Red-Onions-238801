Memorial day Bbq. These were a huge hit. They even outshined the ribeye's that were grilled. Everyone wanted the recipe. They were lean,juicy, and layered with flavor. I did change it up an put butter on the buns then some garlic, instead of all the olive oil.

We love these burgers and have made them several times. They're great for when you're entertaining when you want something a little different, but simple at the same time. The last time I made them, I realized last minute that I didn't have any feta so I replaced it with herbed garlic boursin cheese. I held my breath, thinking that it would melt out of the hamburgers, but it was surprisingly similar and yummy.

I made these with ground turkey - not all white meat, but the 7% fat kind. Had to cook them to well done, of course, but they were still juicy. Added roasted red pepper to the bun. Quite good, easy and healthy. The garlic oil was a really nice touch.

This is hands down the best burger I have ever had. I (like a lot of other reviewers) cut down on the garlic. I actually used jarred minced garlic and simply brushed the buns with that. I cant think of one thing I would add to this. My husband and I sat trying to come up with something. The grilled red onions make it very moist and even a mayo of any kid would be overkill.

Among the best - if not THE BEST - hamburger I've ever eaten. We used whole wheat English muffins instead of buns, cut back on the oil a bit, and crumbled the feta into very small pieces, and it was amazing. Served with a side of sweet potato fries, and this dish is divine.

I would give this four forks, but I changed the recipe rather drastically. This recipe is for garlic lovers only! The weather wasn't nice enough for me to grill, so what I did was I got about 6 cloves of garlic, chopped them up superfine and pan fried it with oil until it was nice and crispy. I then put 1 8oz package of blue cheese along with the salt, pepper, oregano and garlic into the ground beef. I then cooked the beef over the stove and left the onions raw, but sliced really thin. I toasted the buns and let me tell you that this was the most delicious burger I've ever tasted. Four stars for my garlic lover's version! Try it if you really love garlic.

Fabulous recipe! Even when we don't prepare the burgers this way (which is rare, and only if we don't have these ingredients on hand) we always prep the buns w/the garlic oil...it adds so much, and you NEVER need mayo or ketchup on your burgers!

Made several times over the summer. Absolutely fantastic! Feta keeps the beef moist as it pseudo-melts. Be prepared for a messy grill. The toddler loves these burgers as well.

best i've ever tasted! i recommend adding more feta and leaving the chunks fairly large. used ciabatta rolls for the buns - amazing.

Unbelievable! Maybe the best burgers Ive ever had!!!

Great burgers! Even lots of flavor when 2lbs divided into eight burgers. The recipe-prepared bread and onions are excellent. Mmmmm.

Definitely a crowd pleaser! I'll make burgers this way from now on!

Yummy, yummy, yummy! I used extra feta and fresh oregano. Brush the buns with generous amounts of the garlic oil.

I made these with 2 lbs of venison instead of 3 lbs of hamburger meat. Great! We will definitely make again. I also made homemade hamburger buns from Gourmet (June 2008). A perfect complement for the burgers!

Crowd pleaser. Easy as could be.

The buns (I used kaiser rolls fresh from the bakery) brushed with garlic oil were the best part of the burger. The feta was hardly noticeable in the burger, which did not have the flavor I had hoped for.

These burgers are fabulous!!! I made them for my husband and myself. I cooked them in the oven and they turned out great. I will definitely make these again.

These are by far the best burgers ever! I hit in my house and something people now love coming to our house to eat. I find that you can use more feta and oregano...adds more flavor. Absolutely delicious!

This was delicious and wonderfully different! We don't have a great charcoal grill so I cooked these in the oven-- still very good--and used Vidalia in lieu of the red onions. On a good charcoal grill it could only be even better--this one is a keeper!

Great burgers. I too, added some onion soup mix and it really kicked up the flavor. Highly recommended!

Excellent. Used buffalo meat and added lots of pepper to the outside of the patty before grilling. Definitely worthy of serving to guests.

Just OK, not really worth the effort.

Wonderful!!! A nice change from the usual burger. I added a pouch of Lipton onion and a few tablespoons of water to the ground mixture for a little extra flavor. Also brushed the buns with pressed garlic warmed in olive oil and then toasted on the grill. Rave reviews from guests!

These burgers were extremely easy and delicious. The provided tip of pressing the center to form an indentation works perfectly! I served them on grilled sourdough bread that had been lightly brushed with olive oil and seasoned with kosher salt. I topped them with a creamy cucumber & vidalia onion mixture made with sour cream, golden balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper & a pinch of sugar. Great sandwich! Thank you Bon Appetit!

These feta burgers were great! Nice flavours and very easy and quick to make. Will keep this recipe!

1 inch) burgers that were moist, yet cooked through. Oh, I also ended up using tomato-basil feta because it's what my wife bought. Worked out great.

This recipe was delicous and super easy. The burgers were very moist and you needed additional condiments. I have made them twice this summer.

I was a bit sceptical while putting together the recipe but was pleasantly surprised. I would have to agree with Gatineau, Quebec that there might be a little more veggies to enhance the burger with feta. Great combo. Will say that maybe crumble the feta to small pieces. Some of mine were a little large making it hard to patty. Also like adcarr's idea on the Worsterchire!

These burgers are excepcional. The addition of feta cheese in the patties keeps the burgers moist, and the oregano makes them special. I can't wait to make these again!

I thought these were wonderful - my only complaint was that they fell apart a bit on the grill. Next time I will add an egg white to the mix!

These burgers are fabulous! Authentic feta probably made a big different, worth the extra money. We can't wait to have these again.

We loved these; they were a little large, though. I'd definitely make again but maybe try to squeeze 9 patties out of the mixture.

These burgers were good, but not great. They didn't have an exceptional flavour and weren't as juicy as other burgers I've made. Perhaps using a seasoned feta like the previous reviewer used would help. I did grill some red pepper and zucchini and put those on the burger and that really enhanced the flavour.

I made these burger today for friends and they LOVED THEM. I cut the recipe in half since there were only 4 of us, and I used angus beef. The feta cheese that I had in the frig. was tomato/basil flavored, so I just used it. We will probably make them again since they were such a big hit, and so easy to make.

I JUST made these for my officemates and they were a huge hit. I forgot to put basil in the burgers, but did add a splash of Worcester--maybe a quarter cup or less. We also whipped up a garlic aioli and included farmer's market tomoatoes and basil leaves for toppings. The only thing I would change if I made it again: more feta. Also, my burgers shrunk a LOT, so be prepared for that.

Didn't feel the burgers were outstanding. Probably will not make again.
