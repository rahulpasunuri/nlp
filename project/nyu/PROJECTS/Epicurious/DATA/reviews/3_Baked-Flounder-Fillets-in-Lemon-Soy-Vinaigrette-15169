Quick and easy. Can be used with a wide variety of fish. The cooking liquid has a light, yet distinct taste. If using the scallion garnish, make sure to cut them paper thin so they won't overpower some of the more delicate tasting fishes. Salt isn't needed as even low sodium soy sauce provides more than enough. Fresh lemon is a must.

This recipe is so easy I was able to make the marinade and bake the fish all in less than 20 minutes. I didn't add any salt because of the soy, and I used liquid aminos instead of soy. It came out excellent and I will surely make this dish again.

This turned out ok. I thought it was a little too much citrus but it still was good. I ended up grilling my fish on foil with the sauce and it was a hit.

I fixed this tonight and I think this is a good start for a great recipe. My major complaint is that its WAAAAAY too salty. I would cut the salt waaay back to maybe an 1/8 tsp. Next I would add a couple of TBS of some sort of crushed nuts... probably walnuts or pecans.

This was gross. The fish did not absorb the flavors in the least and the consistency of the fish was wet, soggy and basically disgusting. Don't waste your time with this if you are looking for something flavorful. You will end up disappointed! I couldn't even finish my piece and I felt awful for serving this to my poor boyfriend. I think flounder is a fish much better served pan fried with breadcrumbs and a flavorful coating! First time I have LOATHED a recipe I tried here!

Rating: 2
Definitely leave out the salt. The salt in the soy sauce is more than enough. I added some ground ginger to the vinaigrette (didn't have fresh). It does make a lot of vinaigrette for the amount of fish called for in the recipe, which left me with soggy breadcrumbs except for what some in the very middle of the fillets. I think the lemon is overpowering too, taking away from the other ingredients. With tweaking, this recipe could be really good. As is, not so much.

Soggy,tasteless and gross. I hate wasting ingredients. Will not make again.

I thought this was delicious! Based on some comments, I made a couple minor adjustments. For the sauce, I used 1 T. brown sugar instead of white, no salt, 1 T. low sodium soy sauce, and added 2 t. minced ginger. For the fish, I dipped in egg and then flour with a few shakes of S&P, sauteed for a minute or two on each side, before placing in baking dish. I did 4 fillets. Then topped with the sauce and baked. It was wonderful, not soggy, and we ate it all. I'll make this again and again, something beyond the buttery bread crumbs.

I gave this recipe 2 stars some time ago. This time I added some chopped fresh ginger to the vinaigrette, as another reviewer suggested, sprinkled the fish with panko, baked it for 5 minutes, then finished it off under the broiler for a couple more minutes to brown. 3 stars this time!

I might end up making this one again--it is quick and healthful. But I've certainly had more interesting fish preparations.

It's very easy to overcook the fish in this recipe. 7 minutes may be too long. If you overcook, the fish becomes like mashed potatoes! Try using less liquid, and 5 minutes max on the cooking time.

I love this recipe and make it often, with a few changes. I use talapia instead of flounder and I add fresh ginger (abount an inch). It's quick and easy so it makes a great dish for the family. Garnished with spring onions it makes a lovely dish for company.

This has become a new favorite. Super simple and flavorful... and I ordinarily prefer food very spicy. Like other reviewers, I eliminated the salt because of the soy sauce. As in most recipes, I believe using fresh lemon juice makes a difference.

Very quick and very tasty, this dish was even enjoyed by a fish-phobic 8-year-old.

I should have read the comments here before making this. I made this with low sodium soy sauce, fresh lemon and fresh garlic. We love garlic at our house, but found that the short cooking time left the garlic harsh and raw-tasting, and the dish was WAY too salty. I would try this again, since it's quick and easy, but only with major modifications.

Rating: 2
I made this exactly as written, and it was okay. We ate it with some mushrooms quick-fried in a tad of soy sauce, and the mushrooms were much more of a hit than the fish. There are just better ways to cook fish than this. I doubt I would go for this again.

Very easy and delicious. For those who did not like it -- its all about the quality of the ingredients -- fresh lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil and Japanese soy sauce -- it really makes a difference.

Great simple recipe. I make extra marinade, (use pressed garlic, not minced) cook it and use as sauce. NO SALT needed. Yummy. Serve with rice that soaks up sauce. MMMM. Any type of light fish works quite well!

I don't think I've ever given a one fork rating before, but this one definitely deserves it. While this dish was very simple to make, it was very bland to say the least. I'm not sure what it is missing, but it needed something. I won't be making this one again.

This recipe does not need the salt added because of the soy sauce which already has sodium. If I do make it I would omit the salt entirely. I thought the salt taste overpowered the flavor of the flounder.

This was extremely easy and delicious. I doubled the sauce b/c my boyfriend is a big sauce person, and didn't add salt, but everything else done as directed. Came out great.

I reduced the lemon juice by half as suggested by others. I also reduced the oil by half. I was concerned at first that I might be short on liquid, so I brushed it on, to make sure it had good contact with all of the fish. It worked out fine. Fish had a nice flavor, will make this again.

Used lite soy, and substituted peanut oil because I was out of olive. Husband, son, and I all liked it a lot! One of those things that tastes wonderful, but it's hard to figure out the ingredients. Will make often.

I thought this dish was good enough for a weeknight meal, but not spectacular. It took less than 5 minutes to put together, which is definitely a plus. I found the sauce a little too tangy; I'd reduce the lemon juice next time. Cooking the flounder fillets for 7 minutes resulted in slightly overcooked fish. I would probably make this again for a simple family meal, but not for company.

Very good! I used flounder, and left out the salt. I served it with purchased Japanese-style seaweed salad that was left over from another meal, and ordinary long grained white rice seasoned with some chives I had in the fridge and a little ginger. I put a few sprigs of the salad on top of the fish to give it a little color and topped everything with some toasted sesame seeds. We added a little soy sauce at the table. Turned out to be an easy, tasty, and attractive meal.

First, I would like to thank the previous reviewers for their suggestions. I used Basa filets for this dish, as they are quite mild, delicious, and very inexpensive. I added about 1 tsp. of fresh grated ginger to this, and substituted 1 Tbs. of sesame oil for the total amount of olive oil. Also nixed the salt as suggested. This is one that will have us eating fish more often. I think it's a 5-forker!

Rating: 2
Nice taste, and very easy - I'll probably make it again. I used tilapia which was fine. My mistake was leaving the fish in the marinade too long which resulted in the fillets being slightly rubbery. As did other reviewers, I omitted the salt and used somewhat less lemon juce. Although I use olive oil for most purposes, I believe that a vegetable oil (such as peanut oil) would be a better choice in this particular recipe. Also, broiling might work to give the fillets a bit of a glaze, but that's just a thought.

This is too good to be so easy! Heeding earlier advice, I doubled the vinaigrette (except the lemon juice; I left that the same and eliminated the salt; definitely unnecessary) and did them on a gas grill at 450, lid down, for 6 minutes. Perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exp of fresh lemon juice and I also marinated the fish for a while. I know sometimes you shouldn't marinate fish but my dinner plans changed at the last min! Anyway the results were good. I will make it again and not marinate...

This is an outstanding dish. It's healthy, very easy and quick to make and my whole family loved it. My 5 year old had seconds. I too doubled the marinade and I used tilapia which is what I had on hand. I found it extremely flavorful. Between prep. and cooking this took me about 15 minutes. This is staying on our rotation. A great way to get into eating fish!!
