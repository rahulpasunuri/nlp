I have to agree with those who said theirs "spread out". Given all the mixed reviews, I still decided to give this recipe a try reducing the liquid and adding more flavoring (doubled vanilla, lemon zest & a few drops of Fiori di Sicilia). They turned out looking like muffiny-pancakes. I'm an experienced baker and can understand recipes turning out a bit different than described however, although edible, this recipe should in no way have the word "scone" in the title.

Made these dairy free and a bit healthier. A big hit! Instead of 3 c flour, used 2 c reg flour, 1/2 c barley flour, 1/2 c almond meal. Replaced half and half with almond milk. Used organic vegetable shortening instead of butter. Added the 1 tsp lemon zest rec by other reviewer (would add more next time along with a bit more sugar or agave or something...). Followed main instructions for preparing and cooking. I put the mix in the fridge for about 30 mins before cooking. They turned out great!

I made these scones this morning with fresh blueberries. Did not get blue dough. I agree they aren't really scone scones, but they were very good. I have those cookie scoops and used the big one so they were well rounded.

I rate this as exceptional with the following modifications. Generous 1/3 c. brown sugar, sub 1 1/3 c. buttermilk for half and half, and double the vanilla. I fold in the blueberries (frozen wild berries from Trader Joe's) gently after the oats (otherwise you get blue scones). I also measure in 1/4 c. mounds. I think the modifications make the recipe a great success (How I measure success: I've made them for countless parties and people always eat at least 2 and ask for the recipe.) I also love that they're not too sweet and you can avoid the sugar spike that often comes from overly sugary breakfast food. I'd like to try subbing wheat pastry flour at some point, which I think would taste great but might require a bit more buttermilk.

This is not a scone recipe; it's too cakey and moist. So I rated it "OK," because it didn't live up to what we think of as scones. Also, it was bland. There are other, better scone recipes out there; use those and skip this one.

this is one of the best scone recipes i have ever made (and i make scones frequently). If they are getting too thin during baking, you might be mixing the batter too much. Try refrigerating the dough for a few minutes. This works best with fresh blueberries (no surprise there).

These didn't turn out very scone-like for me at all. As one reviewer said, they spread out and became cookie-like. Toasted the next morning they were still pretty tasty, but I wanted a scone! I also added lemon and orange zest for a little more flavour. I think the re-toasting was curcial because otherwise they were a little spongy and bland.

This recipe is delicious and super easy to make. As scones go, it's also pretty healthy. I reviewed the recipe in detail on my blog http://misschefy.wordpress.com

Great recipe! Forgot to use lemon zest as others had suggested - it would have been nice but not at all necessary. Mine turned out more like giant breakfast cookies than like traditional scones, but that's appreciated as I eat breakfast on the go, and these don't need butter & won't be so crumbly.

I also added a bit extra vanilla and about 1 T lemon zest, and used 1/2c sugar. scrumdidlyumptious! Moist, crumbly goodness. Not too sweet or cakey.

Not bad at all. I was making these with my 10 year old and we forgot to add the salt. Even without the salt they were light, cakey, and tasty. I am actually partial to more cakey items over dry scones. I don't know if it was because we did forget to add the salt, but it didn't have all that much of a blueberry flavor except when you bit into one. I kind of hoped it would have a better flavor, but I know it was part our fault. I will definitely make these again, maybe in smaller scoops to serve a crowd. Either way, they were still plenty tasty!

This scone is delicious, but it does not have the traditional texture of a scone. Most scones are dry and dense--this one is light and fluffy. The individual scones are the size of blimps; they definitely look more like a commercial product (infected with American gigantism) than a homemade one. Given the size of the dough, mixing in the processor was a great idea.

It's Sunday morning and my son and I just finished making these scones for the first time, and I am enjoying one with a latte. He is 2 and a half and is gobbling up his. The only change I made to the recipe was to add walnuts because I adore them. In response to the other reviewers: mine did not spread out at all- they are high and really pretty. You must barely stir after adding the blueberries (I used frozen) to prevent blue dough. They have almost no sweetness to them which is at first a little surprising but is then quite pleasant. They are crisp on the outside and muffin-like on the inside as opposed to a classic scone, which is dense and buscuit-like. I found this nice because you don't require butter or jam on every bite- it's perfect on it's own. Will be making these Christmas morning. Thanks Molly!

I made these to take as a hostess gift, and everyone liked them, some even loved them. I followed the recipe exactly, but will substitute some whole wheat flour in next time. My only complaint was that they were very crumbly. They were definitely sweet enough for a scone.

Pretty good. I zested a lemon into the flour (b/c of complaints that the recipe is a little bland), and subbed lowfat buttermilk for the half and half. I used a smaller volume of liquid than the recipe suggested, (given all the comments that the scones have a cakey, over- moist consistency) using a total volume of 1 1/3 c liquid, made up lemon juice + buttermilk. I really liked it with fresh blueberries. Just the right amount of sweetness.

Made this using the recipe the first time. However, I cut the recipe in half, did not use parchment, and put the pan in the middle of the oven. The scones were bland and a little cakey. Nothing to write home about. Second time, I made the full recipe. However, I doubled the sugar and vanilla and only used 1 1/4 cup half n half. I also cut the butter in by hand. I made them smaller, 1/4 cup, for my son's preschool. They were much better. In fact, they were really good. The were no longer cakey, and they were crispy on the outside. They were flavorful too. They did spread a little, but not bad. I figure this is due to the size and sugar. I can't give the original recipe a good score, but my modified recipe was really good. I would make it again with the modifications.

I love scones, blueberries and oats-in no particular order. So seeing this recipe that not only looked easy but also required no kneading was right up my alley. I prepared this exactly as the recipe was written and they turned out beautifully. My husband, who isnt' normally a fan of scones as they tend to be too dry for his taste, thought these were more on the cakey side which was fine by him-and me! I'll be making these again.

I don't bake that often and found these scones to be easy to make and really tasty! Think I'm going to try them with a lower fat milk next time.

These are good - but based on the accompanying story, I was all set up to be totally bowled over by how incredible they were, so it's not surprising that in the end, I was disappointed. These are fine scones (a little on the soft side), but they did not 'knock my socks off'.

I liked these and will make them again. Next time, I will increase the sugar to 1/2 or even 2/3 cup packed brown sugar. Texture isn't quite as crumbly as other scones I've had, but they came out of the oven crispy on the outside and tender inside. And, I'm sure that with my alterations below, they are quite a bit healthier than anything you would buy at a coffeeshop or bakery. My alterations -- Used 2 cups white and 1 cup wheat flour, 1 stick butter + 3 Tablespoons Smart Balance spread, and instead of half and half, I used 3/4 cup skim milk + 3/4 cup fat free lite vanilla yougurt (I think you need 1 1/2 cups of liquid vs. full 1 and 3/4). I baked between 350 and 375. Stir very gently once you add the blueberries so they don't mush up. I used fresh.

Rating: 3
I thought these were quite good - not too sweet, had a bit of crust, but soft inside. I also used 1 cup of whole-wheat flour and didn't think they were too wet. I'm going to make them again and will try freezing the butter cubes (or freezing the sticks and grating it into the flour) and freezing the blueberries. But I'm definitely going to make them again.

My wife just made these, and they turned out very good. It is a different version of the typical scone, which may be good or bad depending on your preference. I think they turned out very tasty, much lighter and fluffier than a typical scone, which in my book is fine. Everyone has their own likes/dislikes, so judge for yourself on this one.

Don't get my wrong - the were good, just not great... nothing exceptional. I am, by no means, the most savvy baker so perhaps others would fare better, although I followed the recipe to a T. The scones were dense but without much texture, the flavor was rather bland and the blueberries burst resulting in a uniform green color that was rather unattractive. Good luck.

Passable. Definitely an instance where the article prose surpassed the product in delectability. Something must have gotten lost in translation...either from the bakery to the writer, in the writer's hands, or from the writer to BA. Won't make again...there are too many amazing scones out there.

My teenagers made these and substituted 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat. The did not "spread out" and though not as buttery as other recipes we have, they were delicious-we are foodies who are trying to make more healthy food. We will definitely make these again.

I just loved these - and so did my family. They were not too sweet (which I love) and were perfect with butter and jam - the way a scone should be eaten. Going into my recipe box for sure.

My second batch of Blueberry Oat Scones is currently in the oven, and I was surprised to see all of the negative reviews on here. Mine weren't flat at all, and very full of flavour! Definitely one for my regular rotation of breakfast goodies.

I made a few changes, so will not rate the original. But I'd give my version 4 forks. I used whole wheat flour, substituted tofu for half the butter and used 1-1/4 cup 1% milk + 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt (instead of half and half + vanilla). Baked at 375 for about 25 minutes and they were perfect. Not flat. Crispy outside, fluffy inside. Nice buttery flavor. And much less fat than the original.

this was okay-tasting, but terrible looking. flattened out completely as others have mentioned. will not be making again.

These were not the usual buttery scone I prefer. Not enough sugar and texture was too dense. Not going into my favorites.

hmmm...my scones did not spread or flatten...they were beautiful, tender balls of yumminess...so don't know what happened with the other reviewers' dough. I liked these. Although I too don't like overly sweet scones, I think I will add a bit more sugar to this recipe next time.

I was so excited to make these after reading the article in the July issue; however, after two attempts, I am done with this recipe. They are very cake-like, not your typical scone texture. They were almost spongey, so the 2nd time I cooked entirely convection, hoping they would crisp up a bit, but to no avail. I will search for another recipe.

I had such high hopes for these after reading the accompanying story, but they were truly awful. They did spread in the oven and were cakey and tasteless, except for a strange baking powder?/baking soda? taste. Martha Stewart has a far superior recipe.

Blech. These were horrible. The only change to the recipe I made was using a whole pint of blueberries but they still turned out flavorless and dull. For an amazing blueberry scone recipe, try the one from America's Test Kitchen. Now THOSE are some killer scones!

I made these wonderful scones at the request of my Australian mother-in-law, who really misses the kind they make down under. They came out perfectly, and the baking aromas from the blueberry/oat mixture were intoxicating! The crispy outside and the delicate moist interior were truly gratifying. Use your best judgment with the batter and make sure it is fairly thick to get a proper result. I will make these again for sure!

I just made these per the recipe except I used non-fat milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2; they turned out perfectly. I cooked them for a total of 30 minutes. They held their form, I got the crispy outside; I would make again. Not overly sweet so my husband loved them, too.

I made these as the recipe was written and they turned out marvellously. They are definitely not overly sweet so I may add a little more brown sugar the next time.

Great flavor, but too much half and half in the recipe. Next time I'll start with 1 1/4 c. and add a little more if needed. The dough was almost batter like and the scones spread out too much. I'll do smaller scones next time, with less liquid, and higher temp. I didn't get the crispy outside that was described in the recipe.

Unfortunately I second the below reviewer's opinion--I made the recipe exactly as written and was disappointed. I do not care for overly sweet, cake-like scones and thought this would be right up my alley. But the scones spread out and tasted surprisingly flavorless. I usually work the butter into the flour mixture by hand..perhaps that was the problem.

Made recipe exactly as written. I believe 350 is not hot enough to get a good rise and crumbly crust for these scones. Scones spread out and looked like pancakes. The proportion of fat to other ingredients could also be an issue. Better recipes out there.

These were so unsweetened that they really weren't very good. I may try the recipe again with a bit more brown sugar but not as written.

YUM !!! I did use 1/2 cup of oat flour and 1/2 cup of white wheat flour, but otherwise, followed as stated. The half cup drop is a generous serving. I took these to work for a potluck day with some of my strawberry scones and both disappeared quickly. I used fresh blueberries, but would probably opt for Maine wild berries - fresh or frozen next time.

Excellent in every way. The texture is beautiful and they are not too sweet. I'm not generally a baker but these were incredibly easy and as good as any I have ever tasted.
