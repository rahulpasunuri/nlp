Wow, so simple and so wonderful. Really lets the favors of the vegetables take center stage. Made exactly as is and enjoyed every bite.

This has become my standby recipe for evenings when I get home and have very little time to fix dinner for the family. Fresh and tasty and so simple to put together.

Light, pleasant, a variation, but a bit tasteless, needs somethingthing like garlic, capiscum seeds ... I put on some lemon juice, and added a bit of broccoli. Admittedly left out the oil, which I suppose changes everything.

What an incredible dish! Made this tonight after picking up peas and asparagus at the farmer's market this morning. The only thing I might add to the next batch would be a bit of garlic right at the end. But the dish is pretty much perfect as is. We'll be having this frequently through asparagus season.

Delicious! Would absolutely make it again!

I made this last night for a quick dinner. Turned out very well. Added some smoked sausage as well, so I put the peas in a bit earlier than normal, let them cook a bit, then put the sausage and the asparagus both in at the same time to warm through. Finished with some seasoned salt. Nice easy one pot recipe.

This was fantastic! The flvors were bright and fresh, and the dish was pretty as well as delicious. As per epicurious' suggestion, I added chicken sausage to the menu. sliced thin on the bias and then in half, the shape melded perfectly with the other ingredients. Some tips: add the parmesan gradually, mixing as you go (that way it won't clump). Salt & pepper generously. With the addition of the sausage, this served six in my house. Enjoy!

Very delicious and fresh tasting! I did make a small change... instead of boiling the asparagus, I stir-fried them in a small amount of the olive oil as soon as I put the pasta in the boiling water. After the pasta and snap peas were finished and back in the pot, I added the asparagus and remaining olive oil.

I'm always amused when there is such a discrepancy in the reviews of certain recipes. I made this recipe tonight knowing that when you have wonderful ingredients to start with, you have to end up with something tasty. I used orchiette instead of the bow ties, lots of fresh asparagus from my garden, a goodly amount of fruity extra virgin olive oil and lots of freshly grated parmesan reggiano. Yum!

This was sooooo easy, quick and yummy, even the kids would pick the veggies that they liked. It is a wonderful spring-time, one-pot dish.

This was very, very bland and not much better than throwing something together from your freezer. If you want to try it you could add more cheese and fresh pepper to make it more palatable.

After I made this, I appreciated another reviewer's comment that the timing is difficult. For this to work, the vegetables must be blanched til just tender and everything served perfectly hot. Even so, the flavors are mild. If you are looking for a more powerful asparagus and pasta dish, go for the asparagus and pasta dish with bacon and capers dated May 30 on the Washington Post web site.

Very Good! Quick and easy. A wonderful side dish to salmon or chicken. The pasta enhances the fresh, snappy veggies. My guests loved this dish! If you're like me, and like a little heat, add some crushed red peppers.

This recipe was terrible. It was very bland and boring. I think that perhaps with a creamy sauce or maybe even a little basalmic vinegar with the cheese it would be better.

I make this recipe frequently, adding more cheese & grilled chicken. It's very fresh & light tasting & my guests are always impressed.

I made this as a risotto-like dish with orzo for Easter dinner and it was great. I toasted the orzo (in butter with onion) for about 5-8 minutes until browned, then add warm water at double the depth of the orzo (and added more as needed later in cooking). Stir often. Once the orzo was cooked through and the water was absorbed, I added frozen peas, blanched asparagus and parmesan cheese. So easy to make and delicious.

We, on the other hand, did find it boring and bland. The fresh green vegetable flavors were fine, of course, but they may has well have just been steamed. I tried adding more parmesan (it mostly just kept sticking to the serving spoon), added some lemon... Maybe sesame or another more flavorful oil would have helped. There was also far too much to serve it as a side dish. We ate leftovers three times until I finally threw it away. The only time we enjoyed it was when I served it with ginger-honey salmon and there was enough sauce from the fish to stir some of it in with this on our individual plates. I don't know what I was expecting, but I was embarassed to have served this to guests.

This was perfect for Mother's Day. I already want to make it again!! It paired well with the salmon, arugula, caper, etc

Delicious. Thought it might be a little boring but it was wonderful. Timing is tricky but worth it!

Too easy!

Watch the timing on this one...boiling all the ingredients in the same pot can make ofr overcooking either pasta or the vegetables. I used snow peas out of necessity...snap peas would be better. This was easy, fresh and delicious.

This was just great with a little garlic added.

I made the recipe exactly as written the first time and thought it a little bland, but still delicious. The second time I sauteed two minced garlic cloves in the olive oil for a couple minutes and then proceeded as written. Much improved! My carnivorous husband gave it an "excellent".
