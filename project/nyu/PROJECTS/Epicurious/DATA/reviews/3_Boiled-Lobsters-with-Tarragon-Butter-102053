just a point to people who are worried that boiling the lobster live is cruel, it really isn't. if it bothers you though, just take the tip of a heavy knife ( a chefs knife works perfectly) and place it just behind the lobsters head. use one quick, heavy stroke to cut through the lobsters head. this severs its spinal cord without any pain. this is also good to do if you need to keep the lobster meat raw, for cooking in some other recipe.

I love fresh boiled lobster. However, the vinegar and tarragon in this recipe covered up the sweet, delicate flavor of the lobster. Next time I splurge on lobster, I'll keep it simple.

I loved the tarragon butter. I cooked live lobsters (1.5 lbs each) for the 7-8 minutes like the recipe said and they turned out beautifully. I will definately make this one again!

Having grown up back east with lobsters all summer long, I have to warn anyone that might be tempted to heed the cook from Vancouver - this recipe gets the cooking time right.Cook lobsters for 17-18 minutes only if you like eating tires. And ignore the nonsense about frozen lobster tail, unless there's no way you can get live. Even then, you're probably better off not eating lobster at all, at least not prepared this way.

Fresh lobster is 100% tastier than any lobster that is purchased frozen. Always use fresh lobster, and be wary of lobsters that have been sitting in a supermarket tank for too long and look sluggish.

I made this recipe with fresh lobsters and fresh tarragon ... and found that the tarragon overwhelmed the flavor of the lobster. I do like the notion of adding fresh herbs to the butter; I think that next time, I would favor a tiny bit of sauteed garlic and thyme, instead.

Very nice dish. A nice change from clarified butter. Being an "easterner" myself, its nice to have an old classic with a twist. But being an "easterner" I see the advice to use frozen lobster tails and I cringe. It is NOT the same. Use fresh and you will not be disappointed.

Loved the tarragon butter-more interesting than the plain butter I usually use.Will remember the tarragon butter to use on other things. I made 2 pound lobsters and had to cook them about 14 or 15 minutes.

The simple drawn butter is the best. Tarragon is too strong for truly delectable lobster. We steamed the lobster on the advice of an 'easterner'. He suggested if you massage their large exoskeleton it stuns them and they do not respond to the heat. Bizarre but works. Steaming is faster and they are not as watery. Put about 2 inches of boiling water in a pot and plunge them in head down until done (about 10 minutes for 1-1/2 lbs.)

Excellent, with one small change - why suffer and boil a live lobster to death. The frozen lobster tails work wonderfully, especially if you use seasonal ingredients - the fresh tarragon makes this dish. Do try - just skip the effort, mess and pain of boiling to death live lobsters! I made a garlic lemon sauce along with this one and it was a hit at an outdoor bbq celebration.

The tarragon butter was indeed a nice change from the usual lemon butter sauce, and I would definitely make it again. Perhaps other herbs could be substituted for the tarragon, such as fresh thyme leaves, etc.

The Tarragon Butter is delicious!

I don't know how I can hope to be a gourmet chef if I can't help but think of live lobsters as big bugs. Needless to say, with the help of my guyfriend across the way, my boyfriend was extremely surprised and the lobster turned out great!

The tarragon butter was so delicious that I ate it on my buttered noodles, my flank steak and the lobster, of course! I did not have fresh tarragon and used a good quality dried that I purchased from my farmers market. And, used rice wine vinegar. We loved it!! (Note: I was serving flank steak as well the night that I made this so I used lobster tails rather than whole lobster.)

As a tip, you can tell the perfect boiling time for any size lobster by tugging on the antenna. When they break off easily,it's cooked just right. Do not over-cook. I use lots of wine and sea salt in my water, also. Nothing like a fresh lobster right off the boat.

Absolutely perfect! The lobster was perfectly cooked and the tarragon butter was a special twist on our usual boiled butter and lemon!

Having cooked well over 100 lobsters, I question the cooking time mentioned in this recipe. It should be 17 - 18 minutes for the size of lobsters in this recipe.
