I've made this several times and the only time it didn't get rave reviews was when I substituted deli ham for the prosciutto. Plain deli ham was a little too bland. I usually use the full Costco goat cheese log (10.5 oz) and add extra provolone and a little extra prosciutto too.

This was an amazing strata! I made it for brunch at my grandparents. I ended up using more eggs than the recipe calls for. I was a little worried about it being too rich based on the other reviews here but it wasn't too rich. It's very flavorful and was a hit with everyone. I would probably use more mustard next time I make it.

Made this for a spring brunch and it was a hit! Very yummy and rich. Went ahead and added an extra egg and 1/2 cup milk to the custard and it was the perfect amount to get everything moist. Also used sourdough sliced bread instead of English Muffins and the texture was great. The extra cubes of bread on the top are nice because it helps conceal the goat cheese and proscuitto, so the dish looks polished. Overall, it was great dish, though will try non-fat milk instead of whole milk... it was really decadent. Also, not sure the drizzle of melted butter on top is necessary.

I have used this recipe several times for family gatherings and every time this dish has been the star of the potluck. I have used English muffin bread, Whole Foods French loaf, and Ralph's Italian. The English muffin bread worked the best. The last two times I made it, I had to add one more egg and 1/2 cup of milk. Before you put it in the oven, lift the pan to see if the bread is completely soaked through to the bottom. You should also wait until then to put the butter on the top. This past year, I made two stratas for Christmas brunch. I made one with 8 oz. pancetta, sauteed shallots, and dill instead of the prosciutto, green onions, and basil. I made the other one with cheddar, baked ham, and dill. I really thought the pancetta was going to be great; however, it lost quite a bit of it's flavor during baking- a waste of a very delicious, and rather pricey piece of meat. The cheddar and ham strata was so tasty that nearly everyone who tried it went back and got a little more.

I did like the end product, although it was quite different than the original. I didn't have prosciutto, but, I had some salami, blk. forest ham, and already cooked bacon, didn't have provolone, but did have some fresh mozzarella, a little guyere, and some pepper jack, then I thought, hmmm, mushrooms would be nice, and some finely chopped onions, 1 clove of garlic, pressed, and then there you have it...the egg milk and mustard didn't change much..needed to use up some 1/2 and 1/2 so, in it went, and it turned out wonderful...a little rich, but served small slices with some fresh fruit.

Rating: 4
When I realized three hours before the brunch I was hosting that I failed to start this the night before to let it soak, I was a little worried - so I used only one layer of bread on the bottom, and then a thin layer of torn up bread pieces. Turned out AMAZING. I actually think if I made this again, i'd still use less bread. I also used the full amount of egg and it seemed like the perfect amount for the less bread.

absolutely superb. It's very rich, so not a dish I would make all the time, but definitely right for a Christmas morning. Everyone raved about it. I too added more eggs and milk as others suggested. Also didn't have basil and used fresh mint and it was fabulous. My kids couldn't have enough of it.

Good, but nothing spectacular - and for Christmas, I want spectacular. Took it to a potluck, but didn't get one single compliment. I just kept thinking I was eating leftover stuffing. Proscuitto and goat cheese were not cheap, and I can think of a thousand better uses for them where the flavors really shine. Would not make again.

We made this with sourdough bread, roasted red peppers and a mixture of mushrooms (sauted with garlic) instead of the prosciutto. We, too, added more milk, eggs and cheese but had a larger pan to fill. It was delicious and, as mentioned before, reheated very well.

This is fabulous. I used a store-bought potato bread and followed the recipe exactly, and got a beautiful result. It puffs up and browns beautifully -- I didn't have to do the broiling step, and wouldn't want to risk drying out the top. I can understand why others would add a bit more egg/milk -- that certainly would not have hurt my results. And I love the roasted red pepper idea! Something to try next Christmas. I did use prosciutto, but I think it would be great with any thin-sliced or finely diced ham. Diced mushrooms might make a nice veggie alternative...

I have made this recipe for years. I've made it for Christmas morning twice. It is a nice strata and a bit lighter and more sophisticated than the usual heavy sausage and egg breakfast strata. I highly recommend preparing it a day or even two in advance and just popping it in the oven when you wake up. Every time I make it someone asks me for the recipe.

A friend turned me on to this recipe a couple of years ago, and I have since made it many times. It's an obvious Christmas morning breakfast, but I also make it in the summer and serve it cold for lunch. Prosciutto costs a kidney (as does goat cheese) so I use leftover ham or even thinly sliced black forest sandwich ham. It's easy and delicious.

I recommend whole wheat or a good grain bread.

Delicious. It did need an extra egg and more milk. I used ham and chopped it, then mixed it with the onions and grated cheese then layered that with the goat cheese and bread. Don't cook for more than an hour. Used Italian loaf bread. I wouldn't do the cubes on the top again (too dry), and it browned fine in the hour in the oven.

A great strata that was easy to make. My hubby said it tasted like pizza...must have been the basil, provolone and prosciutto combo! I split this into two smaller pans and am freezing one of them to see if it works. I will say that this tasted best after it had cooled a bit.

I've made this dozens of times, always to rave reviews. You can use egg bread instead, if it's easier to find. I also use 6 eggs and 2-1/2 cups of milk instead. An excellent variation (for a great brunch strata) is to use smoked salmon and dill instead of prosciutto and basil.

You cannot beat this recipe for brunch. Assemble on Saturday and it makes Sunday morning a whole lot easier to face. Puffs right up and looks as spectacular as it tastes. And, yes, be prepared with a little extra milk if your bread is extra dry. Sprinkle a bit of parmegiano over it to brown the top sans broiler.

So yummy and easy! I used sourdough bread and left the crusts on. Also used sliced provolone. Added a little bit more cheese, prosciutto, milk (2.5cups), and eggs (7) per other's suggestions. I also added mushrooms and roasted bell peppers. This was so tasty - my husband couldn't get enough! Served with a salad and this made a perfect dinner. Will definitely make again!!!!

I made this strata for the second time this past weekend. Once again, it received rave reviews. It's a GREAT dish for a crowd (made it for a dozen the first time and for 16 this time!). Even the teenagers (generally picky eaters) loaded up on seconds (and in one case, thirds). As we all know, stratas are perfect for brunch because you make them the night before. But this one goes together quickly, too, since for one thing you don't have to cook any meat (unlike a traditional strata). I agree with the reviewers who reduced the number of English muffins used. A couple of other variations: I spread pesto sauce between the layers (had used all of my basil making that the day before). The provolone I bought was already sliced which made it easier (no grating) and worked just as well. And I used Egg Starts the second time which didn't impact the taste one bit.

Made this for a birthday brunch - it was delicious. I used 2 loaves of Acme sourdough bread, 2 1/2 C 1% milk, 8 oz. prosciutto, about 6 oz. provolone, and 7 eggs (otherwise no other modifications). After baking, there was a lot of oil (the melted butter?), so I just drained it over the sink before serving. My husband did not think there was enough prosciutto, but I thought it was fine for a bit of flavor that was not overwhelming. Great dish for a potluck since it's very rich and you really only need a small piece. I am going to make another strata this weekend, but am going to skip the prosciutto and add veggies. I'm also going to try to use some egg whites since this is very high in fat and cholesterol.

I made this recipe exactly as written EXCEPT instead of bread I used slices of Panetone, an sliglhtly sweet Italian Christmas bread. I liked the contrast of mildly sweet with the savory. I baked it for the listed time in my convection oven. That is why it was quite golden brown and set and I decided that it would only get worse if I ran it under the broiler. I'm making it again tomorrow, perhaps with non-convection baking.

This was delicious. I took other reviewers advice and used sourdough bread, upped the milk to 2 1/2 cups, increased the fontina and prosciutto to 8 ounces. I didn't have time to let it come to room temp before baking so I just left it in the oven during the preheat time (an extra half hour).

This was great! I made it for a work brunch and everyone asked for the recipe. I used English Muffin bread and also a bagged mix of shredded cheeses from Trader Joe's (fontina, asiago, parmesan) instead of the provolone. I used the whole bag and I also used 2% milk and increased the amount to 2.5 cups as others suggested and it was perfect. I used 8oz. of proscuitto. Didn't bother with the bread on top or with broiling it after baking, It browned beautifully during baking. I also added chopped marinated sun-dried tomatoes on top and it tasted great and added a nice touch of color. I'll definitely make this one again!

This was very easy, but labor intensive in the preparation stage. That said, it was absolutely fabulous, and a huge hit with all of our friends.

This strata is a great recipe that we prepped more than a day ahead of our planned brunch and it still tasted perfect. After reading others comments on this dish we modified it per a few suggestions. We used sourdough with the crusts removed,increased the amount of procuitto to 8oz, deli provolone to 7oz, skim milk at 2.5 cups,inceased eggs to 8, and sprinkled cubed bread on the top sparingly (adding butter last). Next time I'll leave out the extra salt as it really isn't needed in addition to the flavorful procuitto. We also added a layer of sauteed mushrooms for extra moisture and skipped the broiler step as the top was sufficently browned after cooking for about 70 mins. We also served the Citrus Mint Salad, which was a refreshing accompaniment to the rich flavor of main dish.

I tried really hard to ruin this dish. First, I needed to use two pans and I am not sure I corrected the amount of ingredients. Then my company was late, so it was in and out of the oven twice. It was still delicious. I can't wait to see what it is like when made correctly.

Very delicious and unique. Thanks to the other reviewers who mentioned adding more egg and milk. Both are definitely needed or it would have been too dry.

This strata is extremely simple and delicious (i think anything savory with goat's cheese is difficult not to like). I made a huge amount of it for a weekend brunch for 40 people, so to save time, i simply used thinly sliced provolone from the deli. I added more liquid than the recipe calls for, and didn't bother cutting the crust off basic white bread (believe me, it was very well received). I have made it 4 times since.

This was yummy. Thanks to the other reviewers who recommended more liquid (egg + milk). Next time, I'll try to pay special attention to spreading ingredients all the way out to the edges. I brought this to a brunch and it was all gone. I might try it with just goat cheese next time b/c my husband is allergic to cow cheese. Great make ahead dish. Still tasted good at room temp.

Divine. I couldn't find English muffin bread, so I used sliced sourdough. After reading others' comments, I used 8 oz prosciutto, 5 eggs and 2.25 c. milk. I put a few bread cubes on top - not a lot - using some of the crust. It was easy to assemble, and I loved not having to do anything except bake it in the morning. Took it to a potluck brunch - everyone said it was a keeper.

My back is out (ouch) and so I decided to try this in place of my usual labor-intensive strata. This took less than half an hour to assemble and there were no additional pans or bowls to wash. What a treat for me. I made the recipe as almost as written -- I used bakery Italian bread (crusts and all) and skim milk. I also thought it needed more moisture so I increased the milk to 2 1/2 cups. The dish was lovely and still very rich. Like many have mentioned, the top browned nicely without the broiler step. I did miss the vegetable component of my usual strata so next time I may add a layer of sauted leeks or perhaps some roasted red peppers. A veggie layer would also add some moisture. Definately a keeper.

Fab base recipe. Agree that needed more liquid so I added 1/2 cup more milk and 2 extra eggs. Just fill er up to the rim w/moisture as the bread absorbs it all. Also diced the breadcrusts and put them on top AFTER the milk/eggs, then butter over. Crisped up nicely and no need to broil. Guests inhaled!

just came across this recipe and was reminded of how yummy it was! i make a strata every year for christmas brunch, and this one was definitely a hit. i used sourdough bread, which worked well with the basil and proscuitto. strata is a great solution for a busy holiday because you prepare it the night before, and just pop it in the oven in the a.m.

Made the recipe exactly but added more prosciutto. It turned out way too dry and "bready." Recommendations: (1) Use as a side dish to a main entree, i.e. as a savory bread pudding. (2) Eliminate the 2nd layer of bread and substitute a moisture item such as roasted red peppers, roasted roma tomatoes, sun dried tomatoes and, of course, garlic.

Good, but the recipe as written is too heavy on the bread versus savory ingredients of prosciutto, provolone and egg...the 8 oz of goat cheese is fine. One layer of thinly sliced prosciutto per layer of strata didn't punch much flavor. Next time I will double the amount of prosciutto and provolone and add 1.5 or double the amount of egg for a denser, richer strata.

Made the entire menu as written in magazine(which I usually never do) which included Roasted Red Potatoes with Lemon Citrus Salad with Mint Sugar and Pear and Dried Cherry Frangipane Cake. Whole menu was a hit. Citrus salad was simple and mint an unexpected flavor enhancer to the citrus (wouldn't have thought to put it with citrus). Great menu as is and will make again. Loved the strata but thought the proscuitto flavor was lost behind the more flavorful goat cheese. May try substituting something for goat cheese (perhaps sauteed veggies since I entertain vegetarians regularly).

I prepared this the night before for a Thanksgiving morning brunch to eat while watching the parade. Reviews were mixed; my husband loved it, but I found it way too salty. I like the overall idea, though, of a savory bread pudding prepared ahead, and I think I will experiment with certain variations.
