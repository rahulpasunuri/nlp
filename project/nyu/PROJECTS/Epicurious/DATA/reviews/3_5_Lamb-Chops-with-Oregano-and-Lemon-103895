This is so easy! The lamb was delicious! I also used the additional recipe for the Greek Potatoes with Lemon Vinaigrette. Both dishes were excellent!

Didn't have time to prepare and marinate overnight....still delicious on the grill.

Excellent! Received raves from my meat-eating-loving family. Only adjustment was cutting salt in 1/2. The potatoes that go with this recipe were to die for!

Great recipe. My family went nuts over it! As other reviewers said, balance the amounts olive oil and lemon juice. I also would not marinade too long. I marinated for 8 hours and that was definitely as long as I would want to so that the meat would not be mealy. I used regular oregano and it was fine. It's January so I broiled in the oven on a rack v. grilling outside. I served it with mashed red potatoes blended with sour cream, green onions, garlic and Parmesan cheese (my own recipe.

WAY TOO MUCH SALT! Trying to heed the warning to use "coarse salt" I followed the recipe using Kosher salt. Still seemed like a lot of salt. Thought about it some more a couple hours after preparing and scraped all of the rub off the meat and replaced with mixture that didn't have any salt. Was STILL too salty. May try again, but will cut the salt back to 1/4 of what recipe called for (1 1/2 teaspoons).

Simple and tasty. I was skeptical because I hate to use dried herbs and spices, but I have to admit it was pretty good. Definitely serve it with the potatoes!

We served this last night and were delighted with the results. Everyone loved it. We also reduced the amount of coarse salt to one tablespoon and the lamb was juicy and full of flavor.

I served this to guests over the weekend and they said it was the best lamb they ever ate! I used all the salt but you must use coarse salt.

I used sea salt and cut back to only 1 tlbs. This is the ONLY recipe that I've use garlic powder before and I am pleased with the results. I love the crunchiness of the sea salt when you bit into the juicy lamb. delicious. You MUST serve with the potatoes (although the orzo recommended from a previous reviewer sounded prety good).

Way too much salt. Lost the flavor of the lamb. I cut salt in half and used fresh garlic, thought this would be great, sorry I did it.

Lose the garlic powder and use 2 cloves of chopped garlic instead. I also agree with everyone else, lower the amount of salt. I served this with lemon orzo and a cucmber and tomato salad with mint. OOPAH!

Did not enjoy this recipe, the spices even with cutting the salt way back were harsh and overpowered the lamb. Will not make again.

Less salt, more oregano and cracked pepper. I used the broiler and they turned out juicy with a little char. More char is best.

The lamb was a bit too salty, but otherwise it was wonderful. I will make it again with less salt. Oh, and I had some of the lemon vinaigrette left over after dinner, and marinated some chicken in it overnight. The chicken came off the grill extra juicy and totally delicious, I may make the vinaigrette again just for that!

I doubled the recipe and it was WAY too salty, but I think it would have been this way anyway. Next time I will try it with far less salt. Also, there is something wrong with the quantity: 2 8-rib racks = 8 double chops (16 single) not 4, which allows you to give two double chops (i.e. 4 chops) per 4 plates. This messed me up.

I tried this out for Easter dinner for friends and it was a hit. Very easy and great for dinner parties because most every thing is done in advance. I also made the lemon potatoes and they were also very good.

I used thick lamb chops & not a rack. Came out great.

We really enjoyed this recipe. We cooked it longer than the recipe stated but they were still pink and juicy. The potatoes were fabulous!

We really liked this recipe. The lamb was wonderful although we cooked for about 3 min more than suggested. The potatoes were also delicious. We put some of the remaining marinade on both lamb and potatoes. Great recipe to make for company because you can do most of the work hours ahead of time.
