First of all, I think the recipe sounds great. I have spaghettini on hand so that is what I plan to use. As for the people complaining about the content of fat in this dish, nobody is forcing you to consume this on a daily basis, it's a treat. And what is up with all the cornstarch advise? I'll be back tomorrow to let you know how it worked out.

This is one of my go-to recipes. It's quite easy, and the flavor blend is so delicious. I often put in a bit more lemon zest, onion, and dill than it says, for some extra flavor.

"Fantastic" is what my roommates and friends called it. I used Farfalle pasta (little bow-tie) instead of Angel Hair, and I added a good pinch of salt to the sauce while cooking to bring out the flavors. I will definitely stash this with my other favorite recipes.

My very fussy mother in law liked dinner and so did I. My mother in law likes very bland food. My husband and I like very spicy food. It is very rare that something pleases us both.

quite yummy.. but after reading reviews and ingredients i figured it would be bland so i added a clove of crushed garlic to the sauce, as well as some crushed red pepper for a little kick. I also threw some cut up cherry tomatoes in there. I am quite pleased with how it came out, though i feel like without those additions it would have been too bland for me for sure..

1/2 a cup of heavy cream for 2 servings?? I'll pass.

I substituted grilled regular salmon for the smoked and it was wonderful. This has become a regular in our house.

This recipe is a variation on a standard. Back in 1986, Gourmet presented the basic recipe using heavy cream, white wine, and fresh dill; various French-based recipe collections present a simple sauce made from a reduction of white wine to which heavy cream is added, and the mixture further reduced. A couple of reviewers of the above recipe failed to notice that this recipe requires smoked salmon. One reviewer found that the cream sauce kept the flavor of the smoked salmon in check. Why would one use smoked salmon if one didn't really like the taste of it? Good smoked salmon is expensive! For those who found the sauce runny: use all cream---not light cream, but heavy--- bring it to a boil and simmer for a few minutes. Though I like capers with smoked salmon, I think that they disturb the harmony of well-prepared cream sauce with good quality pasta, good smoked salmon, and fresh dill. Use an Irish or a Scottish type smoked salmon--or the dry-packed smoked salmon from the U.S. northwest (it's flaky but relatively mild in flavor).

Well it certainly was quick and easy, but it was lacking. Too milky tasting, the sauce has no character. I was hoping for more.

Made recipe as is but it was just way too bland. We'll stick to the Fettucine with Smoked Salmon, Goat Cheese, Leeks and Zucchine recipe.

Made this as a valentines dinner ... my boyfriend loved it. Very easy, too!

Awesome. Made it for my roomates and they loved it. I only had low fat milk so I used 3/4 cream and 1/4 milk, and it was great. I will definetely be making this again!

One word for this recipe: YUM! It was very tasty with very little effort. I brought it to a potluck and it got rave reviews! My only complaint is that I, like some other reviewers, found this to be a bit runny. I had to simmer the sauce to thicken it up a bit before serving. And hot damn, is smoked salmon every expensive!!

Very delicious. For something a little lighter I used 1/4 cup whipping cream and 3/4 cup regular milk, which worked out fine.

This dish was very easy to prepare. My boyfriend loved it. I will make this dish again for the rest of my family.... it's just so easy and tasty, goes well with a variety of salads. I like thicker sauces so I used 1 cup of cream instead of 1/2 c. cream and 1/2 c. milk, this worked out just fine!

very light, clean tasting dish. and how easy could it be!? takes about 15 minutes to prepare. made it with tagliatelle cooked very firmly and served it with a tomato, mozarella, and rucola salad. used chives instead of green onions (i always screw up scallions and chives)

My boyfriend and I had this for my birthday dinner. I've never had capers before - interesting but complimentary to the salmon! A great dish to serve a crowd. Delish!

I tried this recipe last night and followed it exactly. Personally, I thought that it was great -- very simple and perfect for someone dining alone. I'm not sure how anyone could find the sauce too runny since once its added to the pasta, you barely notice it. The lure of this recipe is its "light" texture -- no need to thicken the sauce with cornstarch.

I didn't modify this dish at all, except that I used flaky wood-smoked salmon rather than lox type smoked salmon. I think it has a less fishy flavor. This made a quick and delicious dinner. Next time I might try adding some peas to the sauce.

Good and simple recipe, I added shiitake mushrooms to it to deepen the flavor.

Excellent dish, very easy. We're living in Serbia right now and have a very limited kitchen, so it was perfect for a special meal for my husband's birthday since it was great, but not at all complicated.

This was a pretty easy weeknight recipe. The smoked salmon flavor was kept in check by the cream sauce and other ingredients. Very tasty.

I made the recipe as is and it was wonderful!! I wouldn't change a thing. It even reheats well; just add 1-2 T of milk on top of a serving of the pasta, nuke for 1 min, fluff, & nuke for another minute.

I have made this recipe many times and the family really enjoys it. Fresh Dill is a must (was out once and used dried dill-yuck!) I prefer to grill the fish with a little lemon juice and sprinkled with a little lemon-dill seasoning. Very good, even the kids enjoy it!

I, also, thought something was missing, but it could be a good sounding board to do a little experimenting. Since I have lots of dill in my garden, this is something that I will play around with

No need to add cornstarch to this recipe. Simply use heavy cream and light cream instead of light cream and milk. Delicious!! And EZ!!

I don't know, my boyfriend and I both felt that something was missing. I used light cream instead of heavy, and I thickened the sauce with cornstarch. I also used leftover salmon fillet that had been prepared in lime-pepper butter instead of the smoked salmon. It worked better the next as leftovers as the flavors had the chance to blend and because I added pepper, the juice of 1/2 a lemon and three or four tablespoons of parmesan cheese. Still, for the number of calories we were consuming, I'd rather have something that was more of a treat.

Very easy, and very good! We took the suggestion of lettin git sit for awhile, and the sauce didn't seem too runny at all. We added more dill, and next time we would add more salmon too. Would definitely make it again,

Delicious.

This is a simple, delicious dish. I have 2 suggestions: 1) Let the pasta stand 5-10 minutes before serving. The angel hair will absorb some of the cream, and the sauce won't seem so thin. 2) Add the smoked salmon right before serving, so it doesn't accidentally cook in the hot pasta.

This was quick and really delicious. Since I'm lactose-intolerant, I substituted soy milk for the dairy in the recipe and added a little feta for creaminess and body (I can tolerate non-cow cheese). While I'm sure that when made verbatim from the recipe this is incredible, it was still fantastic with the variations I used.

My family loved this recipe. It was so tasty and made such a nice meal that you would never guess how easy it was. I did take the advice of others and thickened the sauce with a tablespoon of cornstarch. Definately a keeper!

Very good. I would make a little more sauce or reduce the amount of pasta next time ( only a little...mabey 1/4). The colors are very inviting.

As a huge dill and salmon fan, I really enjoyed this recipe. It is very simple to make. My only complaint is that I expected a little more from the sauce. Next time, I'll thicken it with cornstarch. Other than that, it was great.

for those of you who like me don't like capers or green onions, this dish is still really good even without them.

Great light and quick lunch or supper. Add asparagus for a change. Serve with rocket salad and crusty bread.

This is an easy, light dish-it's a small amount of cream, quickly absorbed by the pasta, so even if you are rapidly clogging arteries you won't notice. I doubled the capers and onions for a little more flavor but it is delicious the way it is.
