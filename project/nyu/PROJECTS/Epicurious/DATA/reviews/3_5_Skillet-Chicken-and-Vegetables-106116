So gooood.....easy, but of course a few modifications.... Used seasoned butter like the new Land O Lakes to brown the chicken... Made my own broth with powdered low sodium chicken broth...made it 'uber' broth. Used Marsala wine.... Used herbs 'd provence during the cooking process right before I re-added the chicken..

Just dekicious! Easy to make and so much flavor. I also added garlic,mushrooms, tyme, rosemary to it. Also used olive oul instead if veg. Oil. My husband did not even use mayo to this...he always does it, but said the flavor was so wonderful he did not need it. I dont care for cooked carrots, but these were great! Would make it again!

I just left the flour out. My daughter and her "gluten-free" friend enjoyed it.

This is a great weeknight meal. Quick, easy and very flavorful. Kids loved it. Added minced garlic with the onions and carrots. Added herbs de provence to the chicken (used boneless/skinless) before searing. Added an extra tablespoon of flour to the veggies. After adding liquids, baked at 350 degrees for about an hour. Very moist.

Why does this recipe appear under Wheat/Gluten-free when it calls for all-purpose flour?

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe was great, but beware: with the flour, it is not gluten-free (and shame on whoever categorized it as such!). Simple fix: use arrowroot instead and you'll get as thick and glossy a sauce as if you'd used flour. I subbed boneless, skinless chicken breasts for thighs and added three cloves of garlic to the pan with the veggies and about a teaspoon of sage with the broth. My only complaint is that there was barely enough for two servings; I will definitely make this again, but will double the veggies next time.

This recipe came up in my search for gluten free. It is NOT gluten free. All purpose flour??

We thought this was delicious! There was too much liquid though, so next time I'll add less, and then add more if I need to. Or I'll thicken it up with more flour. I also added sweet potatoes, garlic, a little cayenne and salt and pepper. It's like a really comforting chicken stew!

I have made this recipe many times and just love it! I did not have the problem mentioned in the previous review. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added fresh garlic and sage, and dried thyme as it was simmering. Excellent in the colds months!!

I was in love with the picture and not the recipe, and I followed the recipe to pretty much a T, subbing more chicken stock for wine, and adding some celery. I should have added more flour, and not covered while boiling. This was the worst recipe I have made in I'd say a year. The chicken and vegetables had no flavor, and the chicken broth did not boil down at all, even though I could hear it boiling and had it on medium high heat for 35 minutes. I'm really sorry that I wasted 45 minutes, and all the ingredients on this. I could have made something that at least had flavor! Yeah, I know, I'm pretty salty about it.

This recipe is a staple in my house during the winter. I use chicken thighs but remove the skin for less fat. I pour enough broth and wine to to cover 2/3. Everyone likes it, but my son and he's at college now. I love one pot meals. The kids will eat the leftovers too. Lisa

My husband, who doesn't care much for chicken, raves about this recipe. The first time I prepared it, he asked me to make it again the next night. The only thing I changed was a pretty big change indeed: I used 1/2 cup drippings from a roasted chicken and 1/2 cup chicken broth. The drippings keep for a long time in the refrigerator if you leave the fat on it until ready to use. This recipe went from very good to great with this one addition.

Rating: 4
This recipe was incredible after I put my own spin on it. I added 1 tablespoon of butter to the oil to brown the chicken, and then took time to also brown the vegetables slightly (10 minutes). I used drippings and gravy from a roast chicken instead of chicken stock, and plain water in place of the white wine. I added garlic and a little ground thyme and sage. My husband hates what he calls "boiled" chicken, but was ready to have this dish again the next night!

Tasty comfort food. I made the recipe exactly as written, no modifications. My husband loved it, we will definitely make it again.

This is one of those recipes where the cook has complete control over the flavor. The recipe provides a good base, but makes for a fairly bland experience. However, I would consider no spice or vegetable to be out of bounds and they could only add to the flavor of the chicken and veggies. I chose to use herbes de provence and garlic, additional paprika, and even some cumin to spice it all up more. Tasted great.

Rating: 3
As is, this recipe is nice, but it is a bit bland, so I always ad some more herbs/spices to the vegetables to give the sauce some extra flavor. As others have said, add garlic! Also, when tossing the vegetables in the flour, I add any or all of the following: garlic powder, onion powder, herb de province (or thyme and rosemary). All of these are great additions. I ave made this several times. It's a great winter dish and very easy for company.

I've made this so many times and each time found a way to save time in the prep. Use the baby peeled carrots, throw in a bag of frozen pearl onions (if you don't have it, take a couple large onions, peel and quarter). After browning the chicken, add the vegetables, sprinkle additional paprika over them and brown slightly. Add remaining ingredients and BAKE 375 for 1-1/2 hours. I remove the chicken and vegetables when done and thicken the sauce with some flour. Use a big handful of fresh parsley (never use dried) and the result is great. When I make this for company, I bake it in a disposable pan and then serve it on good dishes. Chicken and veggies on one and the sauce in a gravy boat. No reason why this can't be done in a crockpot. Just brown the chicken first.

I made this recipe for my mom and my brother and they enjoyed it greatly. My mom is quite picky so it surprised me that she liked it. I actually did find it bland initially so I put out a little more spices like the other reviews suggested and it tasted much better that way. I put extra paprika and pepper for a kick of flavor. And when I browned the Chicken I did so along with garlic and onions. Any spice you like would work.

I've made this many times, but after the initial time, I've doubled up on the carrots and potatoes, and have thrown in a tomato also. The sauce is always good, but found the portions to be somewhat small.

We enjoyed this but I took so many bits of advice from others that I'm not sure it's the same recipe. Used butter and olive oil to brown skinned thighs, added minced garlic to the vegetables and added lemon juice and herbes de provence and extra flour to the sauce. Question...isn't the chicken amount skimpy or are we just big eaters?

You have to be very careful with this recipe to make sure it does not overcook. Adding the tarragon and the mustard definitely improve the overall flavor, makes great leftovers.

I made this dish based on the great reviews it received, although upon intital read-through the recipe seemed a bit ordinary and bland. I should have trusted my instincts. This was quite boring and I was quite disappointed. I know why most of the dishes I bother to cook include the classics: garlic, herbs, spices, butter and cream. If you plan on making this dish please use some of the suggestions offered by others on this site. It will basically change the entire dish, but only for the better.

Spices were omitted from the original recipe - I added some dried basil and thyme - it certainly made this sauce more interesting.

The name of this recipe was enough to turn several of us off, but I was brave and tried it (or rather, I made my husband make it since I had to work late). What a great combination of flavors - my kids even fought over the leftovers for lunch the next day! It's now a family favorite and I pass the recipe out to all my foodie friends.

Thanks to all the fine reviews of this recipe, I was able to create a winner by adding a tablespoon of butter to the oil, 2 minced cloves of garlic, increasing the paprika to 2 tablespoons, juice from half a lemon, and a generous amount of herbes de Provence, plus additional salt and pepper. I also added an extra tablespoon of flour to the vegetables, which created a gravy of perfect consistency. Next time I will increase all the basic ingredients to make a larger dish.

I just love this dish! I double it when I make it so I can have/freeze leftovers. Added chicken breasts per family request and they came out fine, but I do prefer the thighs. A great fall dish - I served with kasha, but you could have with wide buttered noodles for a quick and tasty companion dish.

This is a good recipe for picky eaters, but not as good as my roasted chicken and veggie recipe which is similar to this one. I prefer the flavor the roasting adds, but it is nice to have all that gravy left over which helps to stretch leftovers. I'd make it again as my hubby and son liked it, but would probably use boneless skinless thighs to cut down on fat and time, but keep the moistness of dark meat that we prefer.

I made some changes to this recipe based on others suggestions (added garlic and splash of lemon). I also used "smokey" paprika and chicken breasts as that was all I had. I added in all sorts of different vegetables (pumpkin, sweet potato, zucchini). Was delicious and easy. Didn't reheat well as the potatoes just went mushy.

Make sure you use fresh, quality paprika. That orange stuff in cans can be years old. Paprika only keeps a little while and should be refrigerated.

This dish was very good, but not very flavorful if you follow it exactly.

I made this for dinner last night and it was just OK. I think, as may other reviewers noted, it just needed something else. I didn't have any sweet paprika but I did have hot. If I make it again I think I would add garlic and some other seasoing such as oregano. and maybe some kind of greens to brighten the dish- fresh peas maybe or green beans

I couldn't help myself, I added two smallish cloves of garlic with the vegetables. I also used about 3 tablespoons of flour and 1/2 cup more chicken broth. We liked it, and I think it would go well with biscuits as well. The chicken thighs had a wonderful taste from the paprika. I used the Hungarian paprika, and managed not to stir in a little sour cream, although tempted.

An excellent weeknight meal -- fast, pleasing and with enough vegetables to hold down the fort. The sauce is very plentiful, so suggestions re serving with rice or bread are good. It could use a bit more flavor, and I think I'll try the tip about herbes de provence. Chicken breasts would complement the thighs.

OH, SO FLAVORFUL and adaptable to improvise depending on what is on hand in the kitchen. I cut up a whole chicken rather than using only thighs, used two onions, increased the gravy, used a dry vermouth, and added some leftover rice to the plate before pouring on the gravy. (Yes, I know that's double starch, but it soaked up the broth perfectly and complemented the dish.) I added this recipe to my family favorites.

Sorry to ruin the 100% 'would make again' rating, but this dish is bland (even with added garlic, thyme and stock) and not worth making.

Comfort food at it's best! To lower the fat, I used a whole, skinned, cut up chicken, and browned it in a small amt of olive oil. Also doubled the carrots and replaced the wine with more chicken broth. Served it with crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce. Wonderful on a cold winter day.

The first time I made this I didn't have any paprika. So, I figured, well red (mild) curry would probably work. I also used cut up onions and served it over rice (although I kept in the potatoes for my non-rice eating daughter). It was great! The next time I added curry to the paprika and it was just as good, but I was able to have more spice to use without it being too hot!

This is a great weekday meal and it has lots of potential for improvising. I followed the tip on using herbs de provence, it turned out great! The herb gave such a mouth-watering aroma. I used whole chicken-cut up into 8 pieces, regular onion chopped, yukon gold potato and added 2 cloves of garlic, sliced. I served it on rice with freshly chopped parsley on top. I can imagine putting some mushrooms, leeks, green peas or even chopped green onion/chives next time.

Made this dish yesterday while watching our 20 month old grandson. It was easy and very tasty. I did not have white wine available, so I used Marsala instead, imparting a slightly sweeter taste to the dish. Our grandson ate all the carrots! Will do it again.

A good "quick and dirty" recipe. I prefer rice with chicken and so substituted sliced mushrooms for the potato (reduce chix stock if you do this) and served the vegetables over wild rice. I also added herbes de provence--my favorite seasoning with chicken. Next time around I will add garlic and reduce the paprika a bit; it tasted somewhat sweet to me.
