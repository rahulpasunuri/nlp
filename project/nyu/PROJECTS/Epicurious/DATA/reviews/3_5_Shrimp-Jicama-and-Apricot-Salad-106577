One of my all-time favorite recipes on epicurious. Simple, fresh, delicious and perfect for summer picnics. I've always made it using mango as a substitute for the apricots and I've made it with and without the shrimp. Also, I always double the garlic, ginger, and cilantro. Today I'm going to make the jicama/mango/cuke salad salad, double the dressing, and serve it over a bed of mesclun mix. Then I'll rub the shrimp with cumin/salt/paprika before grilling and then throw the shrimp on top of it all.

This is an amazing recipe because no one thinks it sounds that great until they taste it. I include myself, but I was just desperate to use the apricot surplus I had (the quantity the recipe calls for didn't help much). Here's the thing. You'll be tempted to try all sorts of variations (I did, added avocado etc.) but it is tasty and satisfying just as it is.

Oh, forgot to add, made once with avocado when no fruit in house and was equally delicious - more creamy.

I substituted very light toasted sesame oil for vegetable oil and added 2-3 drops of chile oil (both oils are asian market staples, and are now found in many supermarkets and health food stores). Salad picked up bit more asian flair with a nice, faint kick. Next time, will try sprinkling some warm, toasted sesame seeds in while tossing the bed of lettuce I use underneath. Can imagine using this recipe year round: w/ citrus in winter, mango, papaya, and oh so many other fresh seasonal choices.

I eliminated the cilantro. Apricot season was over, so I used pluots. The salad is refreshing and so pretty!

We live in AZ whre it's HOT, HOT, HOT. This salad was refreshing and light. We loved it. The only draw back is that it's a bit labor intensive.

Heavenly for summer! I found myself still craving this days after I had made it so I made it again! Would not change a thing.

I've made this recipe three times now. I prefer it with water chestnuts over jicama to add crunch, and have more than doubled the ginger, garlic, and cilantro to add more punch, and used garlic flavored oil for more flavor. It's best with highest quality shrimp, but is fine with frozen shrimp, especially with overnight marination in the vinegar-ginger-garlic-oil mixture. It's a delightful, fresh, light recipe, which is great for dieting! Thanks, Epicurious!

I made the recipe one day my parents had visitors, the salad was a huge success. Everybody complemented that it was fresh, light and with a good combination of flavors.

I made this for the 4th of July cookout and it was met with rave reviews! I took another reviewers advice and used mandarine oranges, and I even used Publix frozen shrimp (deveined, but still in the shell), and it was wonderful! After we cooked the shrimp, we let them cool and we peeled them and cut them in half. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. A light refreshing dish! Thanks, Epicurious!

Left off the shrimp to create a colorful and unusual side dish for a summer bbq. Added extra cilantro, ginger, garlic and vinegar for more punch.

I made the salad today and everyone thought it was boring. Just not enough punch to light up the taste buds. I sounded good. I guess I hoped it would taste more like sunomono, similar to a Japanese cucumber salad. I fixed it up with more rice vinegar and sugar. I think it would have tasted better with Mandarin oranges.

You know, I REALLY wanted to like this recipe. I love all the ingredients in it, and I adore shrimp. I usually agree with the other reviewers, but I have to disagree here. This salad didn't taste like anything. I didn't want to waste good shrimp, so on day 2 I pulled out all the shrimp and just ate that.

Just a late note to cook from Sussex UK re: peeling shrimp: actually it is possible and frequently recommended in recipes to carefully cut along the back (scissors work best) and devein but still leave shell on to cook shrimp, both for texture and flavor.

Excellent salad for a summer picnic. The colors and texture are wonderful, the dressing light, and the oriental overtones wonderful. It's a definite keeper.

This was an awesome salad and perfect for summer! The apricots are definitely the right amount of fruity touch that it needs! Since I love mangoes, I will try it with that next time. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent and easy - even tastier the second day!

This was really lovely; I'll be making again. You could really play around with this recipe--grilled chicken breast in place of the shrimp, mango in place of the apricots. Next time I'll add a minced jalapeno to the dressing. I used cooked shrimp from the fish shop and can't understand why you need to go to the trouble of cooking, shelling, deveining... unless you want to save a little money...

Loved this salad tonight. A few additions; add a bay leaf, a roughly chopped celery stalk and sea salt to the water before adding shrimp to season while cooking. Peel after cooled. Serve the salad chilled, tossing with dressing at the last minute to keep crisp. This was divine; my husband said he'd love to have it again and he's not a "light eater" normally.

My husband doesn't like jicama or apricot, but this recipe changed his mind about both. It was delicious.

I halved the recipe and thus only used 1/2 a pound of shrimp--next time, I would probably stick with 1 lb of shrimp if I decide to make it for a main course as it seemed a little light on shrimp and a little heavy on jicama. Also couldn't find a seedless cucumber, so used a regular one which seemed to work just fine. A nice, light summer supper which I would definitely make again.

In answer to the question about why peel the shrimp: it's because you can't devein them without peeling them!

Lot's of comments, but does anyone like this recipe????

I would second the reccomendation of using a firm Asian pear as a substitute, as jicama has a slightly sweet taste.

Think you could substitute crab for shrimp with good results???

I'm curious why the recipe recommends peeling the shrimp before boiling? They tend to cook up much tougher and also a lot more difficult to peel prior to cooking...

No Jicama is not like horseraddish - it is mild. In Toronto I get it in Oriental markets but our supermarkets sometimes carry it now.

Isn't jicima like a horseradish?

Also, jicama is pronounced HI-CA-MA. You may have some trouble finding it in Montreal. I have easy access to it here in Houston of course, plus i live in an Hispanic area as well. If you can't find it in your supermarket...check for any Latin/Hispanic markets in your area. If you can't find it at all you might experiment with either water chestnuts (of which i am not a huge fan personally) or a firm asian pear.

Jicama is a root vegetable that has a radish-like crunch without the bite of a radish. It is slightly sweet, kind of like a water chestnut. very low cal, high fiber. Takes on the flavor of whatever you mix it with.

What is a Jicama?
