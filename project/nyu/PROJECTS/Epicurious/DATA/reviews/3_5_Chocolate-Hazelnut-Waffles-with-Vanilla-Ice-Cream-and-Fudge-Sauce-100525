Excellent dessert, although it is quite rich everyone asked for more! I used a different fudge sauce recipe from this website which is definitely a keeper! Its called Hot Fudge Sauce from Bon Appétit October 1998.

I served these for breakfast with raspberry sauce. Mmmm! Tastes fine using milk rather than buttermilk.

These are great - finally found a nice recipe for my heart-shaped waffle iron. Did not have hazelnuts so I substituted toasted walnuts. Also served it with fresh strawberries. They freeze well and crisp us nicely - a great brownie like taste. Now what do I do with the leftover buttermilk?

Very simple and elegant. Have made it several times and it is always a big hit.
