I have made this steak for years. I reduced the salt when cooking it for my mom who is salt-sensitive and never missed it. For the reviewer who complained that it was too salty after having first marinated it in worcestershire sauce. Duhh - your worcestershire marinade has a good amount of salt in it!

I have made this recipe for a few years. Reduced the salt and lost none of the flavor. My friends love it, even the ones who overcook their steak to medium! My prefer-not-eat-to-steak friends also loved it.

easy, fast and delicious! Definitely would make it again with less salt, perhaps 4 teaspoons of kosher salt next time.

Steak was WAY too salty. I even cut the salt in 1/2. I first marinaded steak in Worstishire sauce and added a little dash of liquid smoke. When I did the rub the overall flavor was good but too salty. IF I make it next time I would eliminate the salt. Their is enough flavor with the seasonings.

This is a great and bold taste. I have used it 3 - 4 times and my husband loves it!

I first made this recipe over a year ago, and my boyfriend compares every steak I cook to it. Every time I grill he says, "good, but not as good as that cumin steak." It is a little salty if you use regular table salt, but its still one of the best recipes on this site!

Not bad... I think it is a good mix of spices. I added some additional Indian spices to make more of a curry and really blackened the surface of the steak. I think that this spice mix can be altered many different ways.

This was absolutely amazing! So easy and so good. I know I will crave this regularly.

I was looking for something other than my typical steak marinade when I came across this rub. It was incredible! So easy and so flavorful. My guests enjoyed it too. I seared both sides of the steaks on high heat then turned it down to low and cooked until medium rare.

This had to be the best steak ever. I'll make it again and again.

I was a little reluctant about the all spice but it was so easy to make that I thought it was worth a try. It was amazing! Maybe the best steak I've made.

I have used this recipe over and over again. I use it most of the time on any steaks I have. Very tasty and I just love it. I went out and specifically bought kosher salt as I was concerned about it being too salty and with kosher salt, it is jsut right.

This recipe is not too salty if you use kosher salt as indicated and don't use the whole recipe to season two steaks. I've used the recipe three times and it's simple and delicious.

I loved this recipe! At first I didn't think allspice and cumin would go good with a steak, but the results were amazing. The taste of the cumin and allspice was sutle but really gave the steaks a twist.

I've made these several times and think they're delicious -- the spices bring zest to, and enhance the flavor of, the steaks without overpowering. Even my "plain steak, rare" father loved it -- I was worried that he would think I ruined good steak, but only raves from him. Best on the grill; I've done them in the broiler too. Perhaps the other reviewers who gave this recipe the "thumbs down" need to purchase better quality/fresher spices (I buy spices and herbs at the health food store with rapid turnover.)

This completely ruined two wonderful steaks. I have always found it difficult to ruin a steak, but this did it. It is WAY too salty, masking the taste of the meat completely.

I prepared the rub and sprinkled it on the meat, put them in the refrigerator. They were cooked 24 hours later and they were delicious. THE FLAVOR WAS VERY SUBTLE.

Very good!! And very easy

Arggghhhh! I wish I had seen the previous reviewer before I killed 2 steaks with this one. I mean it was ok, but it was just OK. Track down the chili rub rib eye instead.

What is with these previous reviewers? Despite my better judgement, I made this recipe last night. It was AWFUL. I ruined two beautiful steaks. This mixure may seem fitting for those that have to smother their meat in steak sauce, but I will never do this to good beef again.

I am the cook in the family but one night I was preparing to teach a cooking class and my husband made this recipe along with the onion rings. He now is our Friday Night Special Dinner Maker. We loved it including our boys 7, 6,and 2.

This recipe prooves the theory that the simplist recipes are the best! What unbelievable flavor! I used this marinade on a london broil. I will now leave the cumin next to the allspice in my spice cabinet from now on~

I thought that this recipe really added that special flavor to the already wonderful flavor of grilled steak. The spices were not overpowering, yet they were enough to enhance the flavor of the steak. I will make this recipe again.

This is the best seasoning, and it is now the ONLY one I use. Wonderful on pork chops too!

Great taste!!! The secret is really letting the steaks sit after cooking. My wife usally dosen't like rib-eyes, but she finished a complete steak (a first) and finished it before I was even 1/2 way done. We're doing it again tonight but will slice the steak and toss with lettuce & veggies to make a steak salad... yumm!!!
