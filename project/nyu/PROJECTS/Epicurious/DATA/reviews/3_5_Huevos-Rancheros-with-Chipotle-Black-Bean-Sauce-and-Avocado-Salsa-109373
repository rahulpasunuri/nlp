Very fresh and delicious. I made a few changes to the recipe to bring more flavor out. I used Oretega's whole green chili's instead of the chipolte, I added 1 tsp of salt and 1 tbsp of sugar at the very end of cooking the sauce, and I fried the tortillas in 1/4 inch of vegetable oil instead of baking, and I omitted the lettuce. I also used the hot oil to cook the eggs and spooned the hot oil over the yolks (2 minutes). I let the sauce soften the tortillas on the plates to make them easier to eat with a fork. I have never seen my wife clean her plate before, and she asked that I make this again for our neighbors.

I liked the basics of this recipe but tweeked it some and LOVED the results. I used fresh tomatoes rather than canned. After heating the bean mixture, I removed half of it and blended it with a stick blender. I then added it back into the pan, giving the beans a great texture. I used flour tortillas because that it what I had. I toasted them in the oven, spread the beans on the tortillas and then topped that with cheese. I then put it all under the broiler for a minute to melt the cheese. The eggs went on top of this. I didn't have avocados so heated some jarred green chili and ladled this over the whole thing. Topped off with sour cream and the whole thing was to die for!

I liked this. I didn't use chipotle chiles, I instead used a fresh jalepeno. I also used flour tortillas instead of corn, personal preference. Tasted great...will make again

This was sooo good. I did use a whole can of the chipotle chiles instead of just 2tspns - we like things hot!

Great recipe - we double the amount of avocado though. We make it for Sunday night guests, they request it!

I've made this a few times now for guests with rave reviews. I use 4 avocados instead of 1 however.

I made some changes based on instinct with the recipe. Like others I thought it seemed like too much tomato and too long in the oven for the tortillas so I adjusted. I also added some chimayo pepper for flavor.

Its easy and fast, but the toasted tortilla is slightly misleading. The salsa was great in it of itself. I found 28 oz of tomatoes was a bit much to use, so I held back a bit. A jalapeno pepper worked just fine if you can't find the chipotle!

if you like mexican food this is an excellent recipe..however, i would suggest making your own tortillas...they just taste sooo much better! if you can't be bothered to do that and don't want your tortillas toasty or burnt then just wrap them in foil and heat in oven til warm and soft...or you can microwave them for a minute ..

If you like tomatoes on burnt tortilla, you'll love this one. The tortillas turned brown and crunchy in less than half that time. Could have used half the amount of tomatoes -- too bad I didn't follow my instincts on that one. The avocado salsa wasn't as hardcore as I thought it'd be with all that lime juice -- was okay. The amount of onion was also way too much.

This is a great quick & easy mid-week meal. It is satisfying and filling while still being healthy

This was okay--but not great enough that I'll make it again. None of the parts of the whole are difficult, but it is a rather intense last-minute prep for just an okay result.

don't even need to freeze those extra chipotles. They are noxious enough to keep indefinitely in the fridge in a tupperward without going bad.

Anything with chipotle chiles gets my attention! I followed the recipe exactly and was really pleased with the results. If you don't want to make the avocado salsa, it is good with a dollop of sour cream on top, or in addition to. The chipotle black bean sauce would easily feed six. I'll have six for breakfast this weekend and plan on having this dish along with some fruit. HINT: After you open a can of chipotle chiles use what you need then freeze the rest in a baggie for later use.
