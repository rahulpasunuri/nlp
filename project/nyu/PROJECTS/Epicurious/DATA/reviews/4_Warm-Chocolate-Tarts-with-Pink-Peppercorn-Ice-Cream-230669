Excellent - really interesting combination especially with the the ice cream! I only used 3 egg yolks in the ice cream as 7 would have made the custard too egg-y for my taste. Plan ahead as pink peppercorns are not that easy to come by. As suggested I served with Red Wine-Raspberry Sauce (from Nectarines with Red Wine-Raspberry Sauce on this site) and it really added a lot and made for exceptional presentation!

yummy and very straightforward. I made one large tarte, as I dont like too much pastry with dessert, and so have frozen excess pastry for another time. Everyone liked the tarte including husband who isn't Keen on chocolate. Could not fine pink peppercorns so served with plain vanilla icecream, which was a nice variation. Made pastry a day ahead, and the tarte in the morning, giving it a few mins in a warm oven before serving - a very good "do ahead" pud.

This is an amazing dessert. You have to serve it with the ice cream. Everyone was blown away when I told them what the ice cream was made with. I love it so much I am making this dessert for Thanksgiving Dinner.

This recipe was great. I made it for Christmas and it was a hit. The flavors really compliment each other. I added a vanilla port sauce to it for a little something extra, and drizzled bittersweet over the tart to make it prettier. The recipe was fantastic, especially the ice cream!!
