Tasty, but I cut way back on the salt. The recipe says that it serves two, but there is enough for at least three people.

This was easy and tasty, but would have been too salty if I'd used all that was called for. After salting the asparagus and leeks as directed, I left most of that salt in the roasting pan, and left out the salt added to the eggs. It was perfect.
