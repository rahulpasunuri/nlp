I use salad dressing in place of egg and then coat with corn flake crumbs, sprinkle paprika on top and a little melted butter and bake in over for 40 minutes at 350. Much healthier.

This recipe, as is, doesn't belong on epicurious. If you featured an "Easy Starter Recipe" section, well, then maybe. I've been making chicken cutlets dipped in egg whites and then into a mixture of half panko crumbs, half freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese then frying in a combination of peanut and olive oil. A family favorite for 20 years.

Lame. I thought the '50s were over. What's next...lime Jello and miniature marshmallows? Could you please stop dumbing down this site with recipes that belong in The Weekly Reader.

This is every Grandma's recipe! It's great for nubees who haven't had much experience in that it is basic and accurate. Panko is fairly new on the food scene and is my go to crumb as well.

Too much fat with these ingredients. Panko crumbs could be used instead, fake eggs would work and they could be "fried" in a convenction oven with good results. Better for Heart healthy diets!!!!

This is a staple at my house. I use panko, mixed with s/p, garlic powder, parsley and whatever else I feel like, (crushed red pepper!). My flavor trick is to use dijon mustard in place of the egg. It holds the crumbs on beautifully and adds so much flavor. After chicken is sautéed, make pan sauce with chicken stock, more mustard and a pat of butter. My family eats this up.

Generations of most Italian families have made this with chicken, pork, fish...but we just use Italian flavored breadcrumbs (homemade, store-bought or Panko). I slice the chicken thin and don't need to pound them down. It saves a lot of time and they are just fine. I add a cut clove of garlic to the oil as it's heating and remove it when it begins to color to add more flavor to the oil. We squeeze fresh lemon on the cutlets at the table. Cooked, they will keep frozen for a few months for use in other recipes. Pull a few out and put in the fridge in the morning, top with tomato sauce & shredded mozzarella that night, pop under the broiler till golden and you can have weeknight chicken parmesan in less than 15 minutes!

Similar recipe has been made by me for 38 years. I use seasoned bread crumbs and I use boneless and skinless thighs-much juicier.

I've fixed chicken exactly this way for years. Recently, though, I've discovered a variation that elevates the health-quotient with no penalty to the end product that I can perceive. Substitute store-bought egg whites for the whole eggs.

I have made this for over 30 years. The only difference is I use Panko (salted & peppered) instead of bread crumbs or kellogg's. I use the same method with pork tenderloins - absolutely lovely!!!

This is a very blah recipe, that has absolutely nothing special going on, for it. I am floored that Epicurious would give it page space. There are so may yummy - moist, delicious, toothsome - fried chicken recipes out there. This is NOT one of them.
