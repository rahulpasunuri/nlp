Mine did not look at puffy as the picture but they tasted good anyway. I used brie and fig preserves instead of Camember and walnuts inside. But I used the walnuts on top per the recipe. I used a 1.5 round after they baked they were really shrunken and tiny. Next time I'd try a 2 or 2.5 inch cut out. They were easy to make ahead and just stick in then to heat and melt the cheese when teh guests arrived.

I used a slice of brie, added 1/2 tsp. raspberry fruit spread, and finished off with toasted pecans pieces between the rounds. It really did not take too long to make this appetizer more interesting and tasty

Way too much work for the results. Won't be doing this one again.

Yum! Don't roll the pastry too thin and invest in good cheese. Wonderful dish, full of compliments!

No taste and used very good cheese and added salt, pepper, sage, extra nuts. Pastry got hard after first baking, and was difficult to cut. Cheese never really melted properly.

I think I rolled out the pastry puff too thin because my puffs were not as thick as they needed to be to make pulling them apart easy. But I was able to make due, and they turn really cute and tasted great!

i loved this! it wasn't a lot of work at all, once i found the right size cutter! i overcooked the first batch of pastry but the second batch was PERFECT and split apart just right and these were gobbled up! mmmm

Loved these. I had to make them to go so I made the cheese mixture into little balls to stuff later. Next time I will roll the balls in spice mix before baking to melt the cheese.

This is too much trouble to make again. I'd rather have my favorite camembert recipe which is so quick, simple and delicious. It could easily be made as appetizers and is good with beer as we had it in Arles at a little cafe one windy afternoon. Slice camembert, place a slice onto a buttered piece of good french bread and voila!! It's the best as a sandwich on a warm afternoon. Enjoy!

Like another cook, I made some changes to the blandness: to the cheese/walnut mix, add a tsp of very thinly chopped chives and a dash of Dijon mustard. That perks up the taste.

I made this recipe and as others have said found it a bit tedious - especially as it comes up as quick. I tinkered with the idea-better result. Trim the rind from a wedge of brie (freeze lightly first), then whip with toasted chopped walnuts. Fill mini filo tart shells (made by Athenos) and top with good preserves. I like the roasted garlic and onion jam from Stonewall Kitchens. Bake just until bubbly.

These were a little tedious to make and I was cursing as I made them, but everyone loved them!

Easy to make and looks great but it IS bland. Needs more - not sure what though.

Absolutely delicious! It is a little tedious to cut and fill such tiny little rounds but the advantage is that they can be eaten in one bite - eliminating the messiness of flaking pastry. Next time I will increase the amount of cheese/walnut filling - that is where the flavor is. The variations suggested by earlier reviewers are interesting.

I made these small, as instructed, but found them a bit crumbly and hard to handle. Next time I would make them a little larger. This combo of walnuts and camembert works nicely and is good enough, but the potential for different flavor and texture combinations seems large. I'll leave that to all of you, but this was a popular hors d'oeuvre was snapped up quickly and completely by our guests.

I added some chopped dried cranberries and it really helped.

I agree with the other reviews - this was bland with just the cheese. All we tasted was walnuts. Next time we'll spice it up or try a stronger cheese.

i made these a bit bigger, about 2 1/2 inches in diameter and added some fig chutney and a square of prosciutto. the sweet/salty combination was fantastic. i think they might be a bit too bland with just the chesse and nuts.

I'm a novice to pastries but I think the puffs are delightful. The cheese filling was a little bland so next time I plan to add a little white or chili pepper.
