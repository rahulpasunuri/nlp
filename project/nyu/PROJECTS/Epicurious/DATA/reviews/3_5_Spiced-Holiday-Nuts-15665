Not crazy about this recipe. The curry overwhelmed the other flavors. While I love curry, I thought it was too much.

I have made this recipe for years with varying results. The biggest problem I have had is dissolving the sugar and honey without it separating. When I went to make it today I discovered my honey had crystallized. I put it in some hot water to try to melt it and it ended up really runny. I almost didn't use it but I did and the result was amazing! The honey/sugar mix was exactly the right consistency, it wasn't oily at all, and it didn't get too clumpy- just enough for 6-7 nuts to stick together. Perfect!

Even though the honey taste comes through while chewing, these aren't overly sweet and have an end note that's spicy hot. They're delicous and different.

Too oily. I also have had better spiced nuts. The 5-spice pecans, for example, are delicious. But I was out of that spice so thought I'd try this recipe. Disappointing.

Followed the recipe taking into consideration reviewers suggestions about roast nuts first and reducing oil. Recipe was adequate but nothing stand out. I have had better. I was looking for a nut recipe to add to my christmas basket repertoire and this recipe isn't 'it'.

I thought "ok, but i've had better". i did toast the nuts first, and used brown sugar.

Keep it pretty much the same, and your guests will enjoy. I modified it per other reviewers and my cupboard's contents as follows: (1) Use "Misto" to spray olive oil, probably about a teaspoon or two, and you won't find any oiliness, (2) I used garam masala instead of cumin & stepped up the ginger a little bit for holiday flair/flare, (3) I used same amount of agave nectar instead of honey, (4) used brown sugar instead of regular, (5) toasted the nuts first. And some advice: don't make it three days before your party, because people you live with will find these nuts, so you'll be making more anyway. You could also ask someone to hide them from you, but don't trust anyone with these, least of all yourself, because you'll be left with a diminished supply! LOL

These are easy and positively addictive. If you have a store like Central Market nearby, you can by pre-roasted pecans. I used them and it really enhanced the recipe.

Even the kids loved them. Made them with raw cashews too

The recipe as it stands is wonderful, very easy to make. AND if you toast the nuts lightly beforehand, it makes the recipe even better. The nuts come out crisper and their toastiness further enhances the flavors of the spices. YUM!

Wow, these nuts are so good and so easy to make! I doubled the recipe (except the oil) and toasted the nuts before I mixed them in. It wasn't greasy at all. When I make it again, I won't double the cayenne because it's maybe a bit too spicy.

I liked this recipe. It's quick and the aroma from the sauteed spices smells wonderful. The nuts did turn out a bit greasy for me like some of the other reviewers mentioned. I started with less oil than the recipe called for but I must not have cut back enough. It's definitely worth a second shot though.

I doubled the recipe and used almonds, pecans and cashews, because that's what I have on hand. I toasted the almonds and cashews first in a dry frying pan. These were so easy and totally addictive. I'm making them again now and I'm halving the oil, sugar & honey (i.e., I'm not doubling them along with everything else) because I thought there was ample coating and it could go further. This will be great for party snacks and holiday hostess gifts.

These are really good and so easy! I used 2 cups of pecans and I felt that the coating was sufficient. Next time I will increase the spices a bit. I did toast the nuts first which gave them added crunch and flavor. You will love these!

these are really good and easy to make. i have been making them since the recipe was first published in 1998. i have never had the problem that others mentioned - the nuts turning out too greasy. however, i use more like 2 cups of nuts rather than 1.5 cups. i also use spray olive oil on the foil - just enough to keep them from sticking.

The most exceptional "nibble" I have ever made. These are a perfect combination of spicy and sweet--not your typical spiced nuts.

This was delicious and SO easy. I made some modifications-- half the oil called for, toasted the nuts before hand, used brown sugar instead of white, and added sesame seeds. Quick, easy, delicious snack

This was great! Add more cayenne if you want to spice things up.

Very yummy and easy to make. I blotted the nuts with a paper towel before serving and they weren't too oily. The heat was mild; use more cayenne if you like a little kick.

Following the tips here, I toasted the nuts first, used half the oil, and had no sticky/oily mess. I also used maple syrup, more than the recipe called for. And I added some cinnamon. I'm not sure if what I ended up making was actually this recipe, but it was good!

This is a staple at our family Thanksgiving dinner as well as Christmas get togethers. Always a hit.

I have made this for three family gatherings this fall and winter, and it was a hit each time. The typical comment was on the initially subtle flavor and then the "sneaky spiciness". I found them to be greasy the first time that I made them, and the subsequent use of (ungreased) parchment paper made a lot of difference in later preparation.

These were VERY greasy. I blotted them after they cooled then baked them in the oven to dry them out. Better, but no one ate them.

I'd been looking for a sweet and spicy nut recipe and this one is it! It was easy, quick, and delicious. Everyone at the party asked for the recipe. I didn't have any curry or cayenne so I used garam masala and chili powder and they were delicious! I want to try them with rosemary too, I think that would make an interesting addition.

Rating: 3
This was great, and super easy to make. I would suggest next time however, to increase the flavoring, I found that it needed more to coat all the nuts. And I was generous with my salt, it just brought out the flavors more. Lastly, I reduced the oil requirement and found it worked out fine. I put the nuts on parchment paper so I didn't have to oil some foil, and I drained them a bit on paper towels because even after all that, they were a bit oily. Otherwise, great!

I loved this recipe. My mother and boyfriend, however, didn't like the cayenne pepper. You notice a heat from the cayenne at the end and neither of them like spicy foods, so.. Next time I might leave that out. A super easy and tasty snack. Also, I made it with all pecans. I think almonds would be great too.

Awesome. I made this for my Christmas eve guests and it was a crowd pleaser. I actually didn't use pecans; I used walnuts and pistachios. I suggest doubling up on the ingredients to give it more of a spicy and sweet punch.

Marvelous! I made this last night, using just pecans, instead of my usual recipe for our Christmas Eve buffet. It was easy, quick, and my family has enthusiastically requested that we have this again for today's festivities... and to please double, Triple the recipe!!

I've made these for several dinner parties and holidays since November 1998, and everyone enjoys them. I sometimes double or change the spices, and increase the heat, depending on who is expected and what else I am serving. I usually make this entirely with pecans, and whichever nuts I use, I always roast them before starting the recipe--so much nicer.

My mom looks for any excuse to have me make this receipe! The clumps are the best part, I double the brown sugar and honey to ensure that I have lots of them. The first time I made them I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used crushed red pepper instead. Now I use both, I find that it evens out the extra sugar and honey and gives the nuts a nice extra kick. I use the already mixed nuts, it's much easier than weighing out different kinds. Easy and delicious.

Maybe this just wasn't what I was looking for. I made it for a Super Bowl party and they bombed. Maybe wrong crowd, wrong nuts. Don't know. I made it like the recipe said....just didn't love the flavor.

I loved em'! Just the right amount of spice. They only clumped a little, and those pieces were delicious. Took exactly 6 minutes to turn amber. I also blotted off the excess olive oil with paper towels, so they were not oily at all.

LOVE this recipe. Simple and delicious. I first made it for Thanksgiving, and now for friends coming for cocktails. Once, I did not have curry so I substitued garam masala which worked surprisingly well.

I have made this recipe every year since it first came out in '98. It's a holiday favorite with my family!

I think these spiced nuts are terrific, the curry adds an unexpected element to the traditional sweet spiced nuts. Very nice. I like giving these as little gifts at Christmas time.

I find that I can avoid the clumping problems (and use less oil) by toasting the nuts and spices in the oven: Preheat oven to 325. Combine all ingredients in a bowl (I cut back the oil to 1/2 Tbl). Spread mixture on an aluminum foil lined baking sheet. Bake /toast until browned and fragrant (approximately 10-15 minutes...I turn the nuts once or twice to promote even toasting). I've also substituted maple syrup for the honey and cut back on the cayenne.

I liked this recipe, but think it should be only pecans. They are much tastier than the walnuts. I also added a bit more honey and salt to make it sweet and salty and spicy.

Rating: 3
Try these - you won't be sorry!! I look forward to making these for holiday parties each winter. They offer a great balance of heat, spice and sweetness. They do clump easily - using two spoons to separate the nuts on the baking sheet works well for me. To try to remove some of the oil, I make them the day before and store them layered between paper towels.

I make these every winter holiday season, and a few times a year as well. There are several tricks: first off, lower your fire when you add the sugars, so they have time to melt and coat without becoming a mass of (albeit very good tasting) sugar and nuts. Secondly, spread them very quickly to dry. Thirdly, use the best curry powder you can find. Finally, instead of cayenne, use powdered chipotle, and you'll add a nice hint of smoke. One of the best uses for these nuts is to make a mesclun salad, add crumbled blue cheese, raspberries, these nuts, and serve with a raspberry vinagrette. Heaven.

I've made this recipe twice. I essentially followed the recipe but increased the nuts to a cup each with a tad more of each additional ingredient to compensate. Maybe I had my stove too hot but it did not take 6 min. for the honey to turn an amber color, more like 1 min. I loved the spicy sweet flavor of these nuts with cocktails.

Rating: 1
Nice flavor, but mine turned into a gooey clump. Maybe I did something wrong? I was making several batches for holiday gifts, though, and didn't want to waste more nuts so I switched to a different recipe (herb spiced nuts - also found on epicurious.com) and I liked that recipe better. It is easier, less sweet, more savory, and a big crowd-pleaser.

These nuts are sooo yummy. Addictive. You can not possibly stop at one. However, make sure you have plenty of napkins on hand becuase they leave any oily residue on your hands. I tried draining them on paperbag, but it helped litte. When I make these again I will reduce the amount of oil and not oil the foil.

Delicious! Be sure that sugar is completely dissolved - otherwise you'll get sugary spicey clumps on some nuts and not enough flavor on others. Enjoy!
