I'm always on the lookout for easy desserts that don't involve opening a pack of storebought cookies. This was perfect--it uses ingredients I usually have on hand, and doesn't take that long to prepare. However, it is a bit too sweet. I think I'd use brown sugar next time, and less of it, and also a fatter pinch of salt. I also cooked the lime zest with the rest of the ingredients, and it was fine.

I love rice pudding and thought this was a good one. I think it was a bit sweet but I wouldn't change the recipe if I make it again. I love the coconut milk in it. I agree that it probably isn't the best recipe but its a good one and worth making again.

I made this recipe for the second time. I made it in advance, and found that it really thickened up in the fridge. To serve, I will reheat and add some milk to loosen it up a bit. I also reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup, and its still sweet enough for me.

Hi - I was craving a sweet treat used this recipe for used a leftover can of coconut milk and some rice. Really easy i - cooked up nice and creamy - could not believe there was no egg or vanilla in it. I am going to wait until it cools to try some (if I can!) , but think I might add more lime zest to spark it up. Give this one a try!

This was my first attempt at rice pudding, and I thought it went quite well. I added the juice of half a lime. I wish I didn't. The zest is plenty to perfume the pudding. And next time, I'll cut the sugar to 1/4 c. Overall, a really good recipe tho.

This is delicious and so easy. When it's warm it's very loose - like Indian kheer. Haven't seen if it sets more as it chills. I love the bright taste of the lime with the creamy coconut. I did it with skim milk and half light coconut milk and half regular and it seems plenty creamy to me.

I first reviewed this recipe in February 2002 (see below). Since that time, I have made this dessert on many, many ocassions, and it is always well-received. I always make it the day before. I always use 1/3 c. sugar. I have used both "lite" and regular unsweetened cocunut milk - it doesn't seem to make much difference. I make it with soy milk for my vegan and lactose-intolerant friends. I always add the juice of at least one lime and I always, always please my guests with this dessert. It's better than a keeper: it's a classic.

It's edible. I thought it was way too sweet when I tasted it while warm. However, I just had some chilled the following day and it was good and not too sweet. Would never serve this to company and don't think I'll make again.

I thought this recipe was great and didn't find it too sweet (due diligence: there are very few things I find too sweet) or too liquid. I added some kaffir lime leaves while it was simmering which added a little dimension as well.

This was probably the best rice pudding (or close to it) I've ever tasted! I believe I may be addicted! Very different, and absolutely fantastic. Plus, it's VERY easy to make! I'll be making this one again and again!

Really too thick and sweet. Yes, I used unsweetened light coconut milk, and I also added more lime. Just too dense and cloying. Trying "Gonzo" rice pudding next (search on this site) - great reviews!

Rating: 4
Delicious! Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't think this was too sweet at all. I thought the lime zest added a nice hit of tartness! It must be in the kind of coconut milk one uses. Anyway, I used jasmine rice, which added a nice floral taste, and topped it off with rhubarb compote. Scrumptious! After eating it, my boyfriend claimed he fell in love with me all over again.

Delicious -- doubled the recipe and used orange zest and some lemon juice instead of the lime as I didn't have any on hand. Serving with a dollop of lime curd on top. It made 7 servings in 1 c. ramekins.

I tried this recipe when I saw it in the magazine and it was a hit... served fresh pineapple that I had "sauteed" in a frying pan (no butter, just the pineapple juice) and it was a great side to the rice pudding.... thanks for adding it to your website as I had misplaced the recipe and I'm always getting asked to make it again and again

This was tasty- the coconut was good but not overpowering. My only complaint was that it was too sweet for my taste, and I didn't even add the full amount of sugar. Next time I would use 1/4 cup, max. And I'll definitely make it again! Great way to use up half a can of leftover coconut milk.

This is by far my favorite recipe for rice pudding! I've even taken the concept of the coconut milk and lime and turned it into an amazing ice cream! I highly recomend this recipe!

This dish was amazing. Instead of using it as a pudding, I squeezed some lime juice and a little bit of lime zest onto the rice and served as a side dish.

I brought this in for a potluck at work, and never have I been complimented so profusely for doing so little! The flavour is incredible. I made it the night before, refrigerated, then brought it to room temperature for serving. It does not have the usual rice pudding consistency - mine set up enough to make it sliceable - so if you're looking for a loose rice pudding, look elsewhere. It is still creamy, however. Both a Pakistani and a Sri Lankan co-worker told me they liked my pudding more than the rice puddings they were accustomed to, and that's saying something...

I made this recipe tonight and did not like the results. I thought that everyone must be wrong about how sweet this rice pudding is and that I must be the only one who has access to unsweetened coconut milk. Went to other receipes to see about the ratio of sugar to milk to rice. It seems to me that the coconut taste adds to the sweetness. It is the only explaination I can think of. I was still thinking that it would be ok when I added the lime. Wrong. That seemed to make it even more sweet. Also the rice had quite a bit of tooth to it. More than usual. I adore the traditional recipe for rice pudding gonzo and wanted a change. Seems like a waste. Sorry.

Delicious medley of flavors. For extra creamy texture, I had a batch of leftover sushi rice that I had mistakenly doubled the water to rice ratio as I was attempting to half the recipe, so my recommendation for extra creamy pudding is to use pre cooked sushi rice with double the water necessary.( the recipe calls for uncooked) and I also used vanilla soymilk for milk and 1/2 the sugar. A serendipitiously delicious surprise! Great flavor and not too too bad for you!

While I rated this two forks, my husband would have given it a four. I think that this just wasn't to my taste, but I do think it's a nice recipe for anyone who likes a textured pudding. I prefer my rice pudding a little creamier.

Like the cook from San Diego I used less sugar and put into won-ton cups baked in small muffin cups. I brushed butter ,sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the wrappers. My friends were so impressed. This is a great dessert to serve at a open house party.

I liked the cook from Dallas's idea, so here's the version I tried. I added cinnamon and the juice from the limes that I zested, cut back the sugar a little bit and used regular unsweetened coconut milk and jasmine rice. Then I brushed wonton wrappers with butter, sprinkled them with a little grated mexican chocolate and baked them for 5 or 6 minutes to brown them. I put a little scoop of the rice pudding in each cup and topped it with a mango slice and toasted coconut. The little cups were a big hit! And it makes it finger food, easy to eat.

I have made this recipe using basmati, jasmine and traditional long grain rice and jasmine is by far my favorite. For people who like a bit more tooth to their rice I would suggest the basmati. Extremely easy to make with delicious results. I have even started making this as a dessert on our camping trips.

I think this recipe is great! As a Bengali, I eat a lot of rice puddings and this is one of the best recipies I have tried. I did add some Cardamom, which gives it a little taste of back home. I also think it goes well topped with Mangos!

About to make this delicious recipe again, and wanted to post a few words in favor of it. A fantastic combination of flavors, and a wonderful non-dairy alternative to your standard rice pudding. It is very rich -- fresh tropical fruits make it go further and are a great compliment. I'm planning to try it with palm sugar this time for a bit of a different taste.

Easy and delicious..what more could you ask for? A perfect finish for an Asian meal. I followed the recipe exactly except for the recommended addition of some lime juice at the end. I will serve often to guests.

My husband and I loved this. I don't think it is too sweet, either, and I often reduce sugar in recipes. My guess is that those who reduce the sugar in this either prefer barely sweet desserts or they are using sweetened coconut milk instead of unsweetened. I tasted it before adding the lime and think that this would be good either way. Next time, though, I will divide the pudding into to 6 portions as the 4 servings were generous.

Rating: 4
This was SO good! My husband and I really loved it. Neither of us like tartness in our dessert so I skipped the lime altogether and it was fabulous. For toppings I toasted some coconut and I chopped some toasted pistachios. These added a nice crunch. Next time I will try adding some saffron.

(Second review) Since the coconut milk is so good, I tried this recipe again with two cans and just enough milk to keep the liquids in the same proportion -- big mistake! It was coconutty, all right, but very heavy and greasy. Just a warning for anyone who might be thinking of doing the same. Also, I have a question: so many people seem to think the recipe is just too sweet and cut back on the sugar -- are you using unsweetened coconut milk? Please don't anyone be offended by my asking, it's just that it doesn't seem very sweet at all to me with the 1/2 c. sugar, and I usually don't like things very sweet. Comments?

Fabulous rice pudding! - my family can't get enough of it. The first time I made it I followed directions as written, except for cutting back the sugar to one-quarter cup. Now I double the recipe, use powdered low fat milk and, in addition to the zest, add some coconut essence to taste. Still fabulous!

I use this recipe as the basis for my favorite rice pudding ever--I call it Baseball Nut Rice Pudding, in honor of Baskin-Robbins' excellent Baseball Nut ice cream, which has similar flavors. Alterations and additions: lemon peel for lime, brown sugar for white, add a dash of vanilla, use 3/4 c sushi rice instead. Marinate fresh raspberries in ground cardamom and white sugar, then place six on the bottoms of each of six individual custard cups. Top with the rice pudding, then sprinkle toasted chopped cashews on top, and a single sugar-crusted raspberry in the center. Elegant and wonderful!

What a unique and elegant rice pudding! It is probably the best I've ever made, and turned out perfectly. The only changes I made were to add the juice of one lime at the end and to use 1% lowfat milk with the "lite" coconut milk. This is one of my new favorites!

This was easy and delicious. I also added the juice of one-half of a lime after removing it from the heat. I used arborio (risotto) rice, and it was delicious. I will keep this recipe.

Turned out very well .... only thing I might change the next time is to NOT use 'lite' coconut milk as I did ... there wasn't the predominant coconut flavour I had hoped for. Added the extra lime juice near the end as others had suggested and used extra grated lime rind (I like lime!) and it was very good.

Delicious! Serve this dessert with sliced mango, like they do in Thai restaurants. I'd recommend cutting the amount of sugar in half- it was a little too sweet for my taste.

It's different and tasty. I used Jasmine rice, as I like the flavor of it better and also substituted soy milk for the regular milk (lactose intolerant). It did need to be cooked longer than the time on the recipe and adding some lime juice at the end was a good tip.

Rating: 3
I liked this very much. It's a keeper -- great hottest-part-of-summer dessert. Soaking the rice is important, however (I don't think that's made clear in the recipe), and you might want to use jasmine rice, if you can get your hands on some.

Rating: 3
This was a great summer dessert. I am not a big fan of rice pudding, but the coconut and lime are such refreshing tastes that it doesn't seem heavy. I was intrigued by using basmati rice for the pudding and it really comes out nicely. Soaking the rice is very important, don't skimp on the soaking time. I also cooked the pudding about 10 minutes longer and added the juice from half a lime during the last five minutes.

After sending advice to the Cook in Lancaster, I made this dish. I used jasmine rice, soaked it almost one hour, and found that I had to cook it for 35 minutes before it had absorbed most of the milk and was of pudding consistency. It is a wonderful dessert for a warm summer evening. I love the coconut and lime flavors (I added 2 tsp. lime juice during the last five minutes of cooking). My husband is a rice pudding freak, and this is my favorite to date.

I made this recipe TWICE-the first time with Uncle Ben's rice as our stores did not carry Bismati rice. The sauce never thickened; and the rice was HARD - like trying to eat stones. I made it the SECOND time with Basmiti rice (after buying a 10 lb bag at Sam's (the only place I could find it. The sauce still did not thicken (tho it was delicious) and again the rice was HARD. Please tell me what I can do to make this recipe as we love rice pudding, coconut and especially lime.
