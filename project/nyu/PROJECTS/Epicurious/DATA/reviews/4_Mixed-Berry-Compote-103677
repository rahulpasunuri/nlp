Super easy. I barely cooked the berries so they would keep some shape. Had it over bread pudding. Yum. Would be great with pancakes or French toast, too.

One of my favorite things to make for dessert! i pair it with angelfood cake and fresh whipped cream and it makes an easy yet elegant dessert (thats also pretty guilt free too!) i made it the day before ad pureed it with an imursion blender and then strained it for a beautifully colored smooth sauce! i also added about * strawberries that i quartered along with blu black and raspberries

I used frozen mixed berries and organic cane sugar (which is neither brown nor white), and served it with chocolate waffles. I used a bit less sugar than what the recipe called for. Delicious.

Simple and easy. I needed a hint more sugar, as my blackberries were not as sweet as I would have liked.

Excellent and easy. Don't be put off by the recipe using light brown sugar (most recipes call for white sugar)..that is the touch that makes it excellent. I substituted 2 T Arancello (orange version of Limoncello) for the lemon juice. Was easy and excellent.

I made this with raspberries and blackberries, and it's just wonderful. I served it over vanilla ice cream, and my guests loved it. Very simple, too.

This is delicious and perfect as a less fatty dessert after a big meal. We added Chambord and reduced the butter considerably.

Made this for easter dinner to serve with pound cake. Everybody ended up pouring it on cheesecake. Used dark brown sugar, and had more than three cups of berries ... worked great. Everyone loved it.

I made this with all blackberries and served it over Belgian waffles with whipped cream. YUM! I crushed some of the berries with the back of a fork to release more flavor into the compote and to give it a little more body.

A wonderful recipe - so easy, and full of fresh berry flavor. I made it to go with the Raspberry Semifreddo Torte, but it would also be great over ice cream, pound cake or another simple dessert.

Served this over slices of banana-blueberry bread. Yummy and so easy. Used 1/3 cup of sugar and found it just right.

This is a great summer dessert. I served it with angel food cake. I will be making this again very soon.

As I always have an abundance of frozen fruit on hand, I made this up with blueberries. It was a snap to make with an upscale taste. I served it over ice cream and my guests went back for seconds!

I prepared this as the recipe said using frozen mixed berries but with half a cup of sugar in the berries instead of a quarter cup. It could not have been easier or more delicious. A scoop of vanilla Haagen Dazs was the perfect accompaniment.

I made this many times last summer; now I realize it's August already and I am now making it for the first time this summer. This is so delicious and easy...making this is a no-brainer! Usually I serve it with ice cream; this time I am trying it with low-fat sour cream (which puts it in the "snack" realm)
