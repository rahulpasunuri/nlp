Great breakfast 'baked french toast' served with maple syrup instead of sauce given. I made it the night before (adding a handful of assorted dried fruits), and reheated it for about 1/2 hour in the morning. Next time I'll add some cinnamon too.

Excellent! I also made it with cinnamon raisin bread and served it with a locally grown raspberry/blueberry (no sugar added)spread. Raves!

Very good recipe. I also substitute other breads ... raisin bread makes a nice change. It's a good comfort food recipe for a cold evening and the kids love it!

One of the best bread puddings i have ever had. Perfect comfort food dessert for winter.

This dessert is incredible. The simplicity of the ingredients belies the perfection that is Toasted Bread and Butter Pudding. Almost better than the taste is the smell. My kitchen smelled like sugar cookies for hours. The recipe states that it serves 10 - 12, but a party of four ate the entire thing just yesterday...

This is the best dessert I had ever made. I usually don't like bread pudding, but the mild and creamy flavors were heavenly!!
