I don't mean to tear apart someone else's recipe, but this is really horrible. I refuse to believe that the poster has ever actually eaten it... I agree completely with both of the previous posts - cheap no-name Great Value brand pasta sauce is much better (and, incidentally, is disgusting), AND this really isn't even a recipe! Sorry to the person that posted it, but it's really not good at all... :(

disgusting. this makes a jar of grocery store brand x sauce and cheap pasta sound like a feast.

Does something like this really need a recipe? Honestly...
