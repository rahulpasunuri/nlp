I have made this recipe every year, at least once for the past ten years and it has been a hit every time. I have found that you need 2 pie crusts and that it tends to take about 45 minutes to cook but otherwise it is the best pumpkin pie I have ever made/tasted. I usually leave off the candied ginger and add slightly more of the other spices.

I used fresh pumpkin to make this. The filling was too custard-like for me, and didn't have the pumpkin-like density and taste that I like about pumpkin pies. Also, it was pretty bland, aside from the immediate taste of the brandy. It left much to be desired.

Definitely a keeper! I have made this pie at least 4 years in a row and it perfect for fresh pumpkin. Make sure to strain out every bit of juice from the cooked pumpkin. Also, make sure that you have an extra pie shell on hand..this recipe makes two very full pies.

Excellent! The best pumpkn pie I have made. The end result is cremey and still light. Guests even asked for seconds! And that is after a grand Thanksgiving dinner. You can also use rum instead of cognac.

Whoa there partner - great recipe for fresh pumpkin, but it makes WAY TOO MUCH FILLING! (Thank the goddess I had an extra crust.) Made two pies, left out the booze - didn't have any on hand. Used about 1/2 tablespoon vanilla 'cause I felt guilty about leaving out the cognac. The taste was good, however the pies stayed in the oven much longer, and were still too moist. I guess I should have squeezed the extra water out of the puree...perhaps I just had a juicy Maine pumpkin!

The best of all possible pumpkin pies. Made two years in a row; excellent both times.

This is a great pie. Don't leave the booze out, it really makes this pie taste much more complex and sophisticated than other pies. I put it in a ginger snap crust from one of the other pie recipes on epicurious, and it was great. The candided ginger is good too.

This is absolutely The Best Pumpkin Pie I've even eaten, bar none! My family always loved the Libby's Pumpkin Pie (which I thought was just "okay") until I made this one. I wouldn't change a thing and I will definitely make this one again. In fact, I'm emailing it to my best friend. Oh by the way, I didn't have cognac, so I substituted Gran Marnier and it was incredible!

Best pumpkin pie recipe ever

Wow - fabulous! Received rave reviews at Thanksgiving dinner. I've been long searching for my Grandma's famous pumpkin pie recipe and I think this is as close as it gets. Thanks to the feedback of other cooks...I did make a few changes...cut the cloves in half, omitted the cognac, added 3 tbsp of maple syrup and baked for 45 mins instead of 35. We really enjoyed it - hope you do as well.

As originally published in by James Beard in Delights & Prejudices, he states that this recipes makes 2 small pies. This might be the reason that many reviews say they ended up with extra filling.

Too much clove. Overwhelmed the otherwise nice flavors of cognac and candied ginger.

This was delicious and a big hit at Christmas dinner. As advised, I made 3/4 of the filling and it was perfect. I cooked my Halloween pumpkin and mixed in the spices the day before. The crust was par-baked also, so I only had to add the wet ingredients on Christmas. I did, however, have to cook it for an hour. I covered it loosely with foil toward the end to keep the crust from over-browning. (Is that a word?)

I wanted a recipe to use with fresh pumpkin, and was surprised byhow yummy and easy this was. The pie was very light, almost fluffy. I used a graham cracker crust, which worked well. The proportions in my pie I think were heavier on the pumpkin than in the recipe. Ended up with 2 pies worth of filling. Needed extra time in the oven.

Great recipe I have made it twice and everyone loves it. The recipe makes entirely too much filling so you may want to make adjustments.

I had more filling than crust, so I filled 5 custard cups and baked them--a nice pre-Thanksgiving treat! Flavor was good; just sweet enough, although I topped with whipped cream instead of ginger. Next time I'll use my cheap brandy instead of cognac because the alcohol flavor was a little too strong.
