I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit. It was a bit complicated but once I got through it I think the next time will be much easier. It's worth the trouble.

I love, love, love this recipe! I found it a few years ago and I have made it for Thanksgiving ever since. I don't really like pumpkin pie. I find it very heavy and dense, so I was in search of a delicious pumpkin alternative. This fit the bill perfectly - so light and airy, while still providing that traditional pumpkin ingredient. Truly a decadent dessert. It's the star of the show every Thanksgiving!

Delicious. Made with gluten free gingersnaps & rum instead of bourbon for a decadent Thanksgiving dessert. I thought it was going to end up gritty - as I put it in the fridge there was a texture to the chiffon - but after it had set for a number of hours it was creamy & smooth. Followed some of the other advice & put in the freezer for the last hour or so.

Great taste and texture. A nice subtle twist on a classic Betty Crocker recipe! Mine set beautifully, after having to add about twice as much liquid to the gelatin stage (I had a rum gummy bear after it "softened"). Dark rum was very nice with these spices. Be careful not to OVERBEAT the egg whites or cream. . .this is most likely the cause of runny desserts in other reviews.

Nice flavor but very time consuming. The mousse was soupy after a few hrs in the fridge. I put it in the freezer to firm it up in order to pre-slice before serving. Overall the juice was not worth the squeeze. A Baker from Maryland

this was very light and fluffy and I did not have the problem of it being it too gelatanous. I skipped the crust and crumbled the cookies on top instead. wonderful alternative to plain old pumpkin pie. However, it was very time consuming. I would make again but not on again during a holiday when i have a dozen other things to tend too!

Way better than pumpkin pie! A great thing about this dessert is that you make it a day ahead! No fuss on the day of the big meal! I added a tablespoon or two of bourbon to the whipped cream at the end too. Scrum-didly-umtious! My family doesn't really like the dense heaviness of traditional pumpkin pie, so this is a welcome addition on our holiday table!

I have now made this 3 times and it has turned out great each time. I used rum instead of brandy or bourbon. I don't find this recipe difficult or time consuming at all. Not compared to some! Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Yummy! This is incredibly delicious, and way better than regular pumpkin pie--totally worth the extra effort.

I made this dessert to bring to a dinner party. People definitely loved it, and came back for seconds, but next time I would freeze it before serving ... it began to "unset" a little bit and got a little bit messy. I didn't have any bourbon or brandy, so I used Grand Marnier, and it turned out great. Also - when it says to cool the mixture until it is the consistency of raw egg white,s, mine never reached this consistency ... mine was a lot thicker, but the overall dessert was fine in the end. I'm definitely looking forward to round two of this dessert, sometime in the near future hopefully!!

Worth the time to make. Always a hit. I, too, make it in individual servings like cordial glasses or small wine glasses.

This is an absolutely wonderful Thanksgiving dessert. It requires quite a bit of work, but is well worth it. Don't skip the crystallized ginger garnish, it adds quite a bit of flavor.

Too many dishes required during prepartation. Next time I'll try to make individual parfaits, layering the mouse with ground cookies, maybe even using cool whip. The flavor was very good.

I have made this mousse cake two years in a row, and am planning to make it again this year. It is simply the best Thanksgiving dessert I have ever come across/made/eaten. It is light and airy (texture only, it has a lot of eggs and whipped cream) and not cloyingly sweet at all... only a half cup of sugar for this enormous thing. My friends who came to dinner last year are still talking about it, and wondering if they'll be invited to dinner this year.

This puppy was a marvelous creation - the gingersnap flavor infused so well with the pumpkin and spices - it was loved by all. Time consuming, yes, but worth the effort - a perfectly unique Thanksgiving desesrt.

This cake has loads of flavor while being a light finish to a heavy holiday meal. I put a touch of vanilla and bourbon in the whipped cream and topped it with crystalized ginger. Simply wonderful! It has become a family favorite and I plan on making it again next Thanksgiving!

I had never made a "chiffon mousse" prior to this recipe before. I made this dessert for Christmas Day Dinner (2003). I bought a chocolate Bunche Noel so that I'd have variety and no one touched the chocolate cake! This Pumpkin Chiffon Mousse was a hit! I can't even keep track of the compliments I got on this dessert! It was so light that everyone had 2nds and 3rds on already full stomachs! I must admit, at first I was a little skeptical because the gelatin didn't appear to soften in the bourbon; it sort of "GELLED". I would recommend this to anyone looking for a different spin on Pumpkin pie type desserts!

Until making this pie I thougth I didn't like pumpkin.....this was awesome. I happened to be out of ginger but it was not missed. Actually scaled the recipe down to make a smaller sized pie which was consumed so quickly by everyone that next time I'll make the full sized recipe

I made this last Thanksgiving and my family absolutly loved it. I was a bit nervous about how it was going to turn out becuase I was a little intoxicated while preparing it. It came out wonderful though. It was a great change of pace from the standard pumpkin pie. The only thing I would change is the amount of burboun, not use as much or just omit it all together. I was hungover when I ate it so maybe that's my reason. Other than that...splendid recipe.

i make this every fall. it is not too sweet and very light. a nice change from your traditional pumpkin pie. a little more time consuming than pumpkin pie but the results are worth the effort. after you've made this once, it is much easier the second time around.

This looked difficult to me, but it was very worth it. Everyone raved. It is a very different dessert because of the light texture of the pumpkin, but everyone who likes pumpkin pie, liked this better!

This recipe was really time consuming, and we didn't really enjoy it. We found the gingersnap crust to be really overwhelming... We ended up eating the pumpkin out of the crust and throwing the crust away, so if I ever tried it again I probably would serve the pumpkin mousse only...

Tinned pumpkin is really hard to get in the UK, so I used my *last* tin to make this for our sort-of-Thanksgiving meal. It was a bit time consuming, but turned out perfectly (I used 3 tbsp gelatin). I was really looking forward to dessert, but it was such a let down. Sure, it was creamy and light, but it lacked the flavour of a straight-up pumpkin pie. All the whipped cream and egg whites must have diluted all the spices. I instantly wished I'd made a pie or even a cheesecake instead! Everyone else raved about it, but they'd never had pumpkin pie before so maybe they didn't have the same expectations as me. Oh well.

I made this for two Thanksgiving dinners, and boy was it time consuming! It is delicious and surprisingly light tasting and was well received. I like another cook's suggestion to serve in glasses to really highlight the mousse. I will probably make this again but only on special occassions because of how time intensive it is.

Made this last year & it was all gone, even competing with 3 other pies. I made it with a regular homemade pastry crust (use lard!), thereby saving a ton of time. Unbelievably delicious. This is also terrific without the crust (in mousse glasses)with whipped cream garnish. YUM!!! Will make again for Thanksgiving this year.

I haven't made this recipe yet but am looking forward to it. Can this recipe be made the night before? I will need to prepare as much ahead of time as Thanksgiving is very busy.

Haven't made this yet but it looks and sounds great. Regarding someone's comment, "I just wanted to share some information I heard on the news last night - holly, holly berries, and mistletoe are extremely poisonous, if not lethal to people, I would not recommend using these as a garnish for your holiday meals as one cook mentioned they did with this pie," this is very true. I wanted to add that you don't have to give up the holiday look however. Pick up some plastic holly, wash well and use in place of the real stuff for decoration.

Great dessert. Have all your utensils and baking items ready to go before you begin as it is a bit involved but well worth it. I forgot to check that I had ice in the freezer and this is pretty important so pop those ice trays in the night before. Also, one package of your average gingersnaps seems to have the required amount so don't bother buying two packages.

This was fabulous!!! Made it for Canadian Thanksgiving and even my mother who isn't a big pumpkin fan had two pieces! I used 1/3 cup brandy and 2 packages = 2Tbsps Gelitin. It was perfect!

I made this dessert for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful. A friend who hates pumpkin pie tried it then went back for seconds, thats how good this was. I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and used brandy.(substiting rum does sound like it was a good idea,instead of adjusting the amount use brandy) I'm making it again in a few days for X-mas for my big family x-mas, they heard me talk about it for a month now.

Served this at Thanksgiving. Very wonderful and very unique. Most guests said they would never go back to boring old pumpkin pie. Rum overwhelmed the pumpkin a little. Will add 1/2 the recommended amount next time. Enjoy!

This is a relatively easy recipe to make - tastes more complicated. This light dessert is perfect after a Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner

After reading the reviews, I added an extra tsp of gelatin to the recipe and followed the directions exactly. It looked great, but when I went to cut it it was like rubber. A bit too much gelatin I thought. At that moment the dog came rushing in, knocked my leg and the whole thing elded up flying off the counter. Crust and chiffon seperated in mid air and the rubber chiffon bounced on the floor several times. The dog wouldn't stop barking at this alien intruder. My husband laughed so hard I thought he was going to throw up. I would only make it again for the entertainment value.

I did not have the problem with the cake slumping but my crust seemed soggy and not distinctive enough since it was so thin. This recipe took quite a long time. I will stick to pumpkin pie next time.

I made this for Thanksgiving...I am not a pumpkin pie fan. It was fantastic...light, rich and festive. The gelatin amount was confusing and I think I used too much. I am glad I did though after reading the reviews. It was more work than I thought, but worth it!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner as I hate regular pumpkin pie but others at the table still wanted something pumpkin-y. Wonderful, delicious, light, rich. It was all gone that night! I think I probably doubled the number of gingersnaps for the crust, but I used smaller ones than called for. But you definitely need more than 20 of any size, butter amount is fine even with more cookies. I used Cognac and thought it married beautifully. This recipe took much longer than I anticipated. Probably would take less time if you have several bowls to use with your stand mixer- I kept having to wash and dry the same one!

This was one of the desserts I made for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. Delicious and rich, yet light. For the people who had trouble with the mousse being too soft, maybe they didn't beat their egg whites and/or whipped cream to a firm enough stage. I followed the recipe exactly and while the texture was soft and delicate, it didn't collapse or slump. Even the next day, it sliced beautifully. Also, the crust was terrific; tasted great and stayed crisp 'til the last leftover slice was gone. Regarding some people's problems with not enough crumbs, maybe different brands of gingersnaps are slightly different sizes. I used the number called for and it was the perfect amount.

I read most of the reviews before we made this recipe for a catering. The changes are: 3 packages of gelatin, 1/4 cup brandy instead of bourbon, and 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of ginger and nutmeg. For the whipped topping which we piped to the side we used: whipping cream, powdered sugar and some of the brandy, (WOW WAS THAT DELICIOUS!!!) To top it off we sprinkled lightly all over with cinnamon and a sprig of holly in the whipped cream. It was the hit of the party and I would certainly make it again. Just a thought: Wouldn't the crust be extra special with homemade gingersnap cookies!!!

I read the reveiws before making this dessert. I used 3 envelopes of gelatin and increased the 'spirits' to 1/3 cup. The dessert looked as good as the picture and tasted great. I had no problem with it 'standing on its own.' This would be a great dish in the summer - the cool taste of autumn.

A welcome change from the usual pumpkin pie and cheesecake desserts....too bad the recipe was flawed by its inadequate gelatin amount -- someone didn't do their homework. I also felt that serving it with whipped cream would have been "over the top" considering the richness of the filling. A very light dusting of cinnamon and edible gold dust (with a few pieces of crystalized ginger on the side) worked for me -- the presentation was great, until the rest of the mousse collapsed when the first piece was cut.

It was great..we don't like pumpkin pie in our house..but e loved this...I needed more than 20 gingersnaps though

Great taste BUT probably needs a shade more gelatin than recipe specifies -- mousse so soft as to be virtually impossible to cut. Number of snaps is skimpy for pan size specified. But GREAT taste and BEAUTIFUL to look at.

After reading that a couple reviewers had trouble keeping the mousse from falling, I increased the gelatin to 4 teaspoons. It worked beautifully. I think the recipe uses too much nutmeg, but my guests loved it. The dessert is lovely, and the crystalized ginger helps make a wonderful presentation. Another tip: as with all recipies, be sure to read ahead and have all the necessary appliances, bowls, and utencils set out ahead of time, as the last few steps of the directions are in quick succession.

Really enjoyed this, but thankfully read the reviews and compared ingredients with other recipes and think the problem is with amount of gelatin. Two packages would be about 2 Tablespoons not 2 teaspoons. I used 2T and it held a pretty well, but was not hard.

This was one of those recipes that I wasn't sure of, so I kept tasting and tasting again. The actual recipe seemed bland, so I added additional amounts of the spices listed (in addition to plain old "pumpkin pie spice) to taste. On top of that, I added about 2 TBS. of vanilla extract. Then things seemed to be okay. I did not achieve the final part where the pumpkin mixture should take on a "raw egg white consistency", but after really THOROUGHLY folding all the parts in, everything seemed to be in order consistency wise. I tested it on a few people and so far everyone has requested a copy of the recipe. The vanilla, coupled with the additional spices (it's really to taste) seemed to be the key issue here.

This was an interesting...very light and tasty...not very pumpkin tasting for those who aren't fond of pumpkin. The gingersnap crust was a nice compliment to the mousse.

This is similar to a recipe in The Joy of Cooking (it has a standard pie crust). That recipe tends to set up better and hold longer, in my experience. Also, I think it's better without the bourbon/brandy.

Although this ended up being more time consuming than I first thought, it was wonderful tasting. I took this to a family birthday party and everyone is wanting the recipe! The only disappointment was that it was not as firm as I thought it would be (after chilling for 6 hours)and started to "fall" upon cutting.
