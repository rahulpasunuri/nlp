These didn't work so well for me. Tempering the chocolate was no problem but it was really hard to work with the center filling. I let it sit for over 4 hours, but when I tried to cut it with cookie cutters, the cuts melted away quickly. Then, the filling completely lost its shape when dipped in the chocolate. Should I refrigerate the mint filling? Any suggestions?

These are terrific, and easy to make. The key to getting that "cool" classic peppermint patty taste is to use peppermint oil instead of extract (you can find peppermint oil at cake and candy making supply stores). Since the oil is much stronger than extract, start out with a few drops, and add until the taste is right to you.

Next time I'll add more than 1/4 teaspoon peppermint. I used Ghirardelli candy making and dipping chocolate--double chocolate flavor. No need to temper and it set up without chilling. You can buy it at Sam's Club and even Wal-Mart superstores.

The patties were fairly grainy and the peppermint flavor faded very quickly. They were wonderful the first day, but after that they started tasting kind of blah.

Wunderbar! Wow. I made great peppermint patties last year, and this recipe was much better for this year. I didn't temper the chocolate, and they were a bit melty and soft on the outside. I tempered chocolate tonight to make some in the morning tomorrow. A film container is a great round cutter size for the mints. I wonder if you could dry the mint filling in little balls without the chocolate, and use them like Altoid mints? Might be worth a try. These are fabulous. Add more peppermint.

Wonderful! Soo much fun to make, and a big hit at my annual Christmas party. I would definitely double the recipe for any large gathering, as they are consumed quickly. And I added a bit more peppermint extract to give it a little more "bite."

These turned out so cute! A friend and I made them for Valentine's Day, so we cut them out in the shape of little hearts. We also did them two different ways, one with pink insides and dipped in bittersweet choc, and the other with white insides and dipped in pink-colored white choc. Both ways were very cute and a big success! We found that it didn't take 4 hours for the round to be firm, and we added some oil to the melted chocolate to thin it out which made for easier dipping. A really fun, but somewhat tedious recipe. We are thinking of making little Easter Eggs come April...

I made these as a hostess gift for a holiday dinner I was invited to. I used Christmas cutters to make the shapes. They were very good. I used "Merckens Dark Chocolate" from the candy supply store. No need to temper it. Using this chocolate, they were a little sweeter than the traditional "peppermint pattie". I used the size cutter recommended and did not yield nearly as many patties as stated?

These tasted great! I used Christmas cookie cutters for the shapes. I brushed the chocolate on with a pastry brush, let them sit in the frig overnight and then brushed the other side and decorated. I had a hard time dipping the shapes into the chocolate.

I love York peppermint patties, so I thought I'd give these a try. They came out great! I've never tempered chocolate before, and it was quite easy - just time-consuming, waiting for it to heat, cool, and reheat. But the results were worth it. I like the previous writer's suggestion to tint these and use different shapes. (I just patted the peppermint mixture into a square, then cut it into triangles - it's very easy to work with.)

I tinted the peppermint pink and used heart shaped cookie cutters for Valentine's Day. They were very tasty and adorable. The kids really enjoyed making them with me.
