I made these with granulated vanilla sugar, two sticks of butter, and a scraped vanilla bean. I put them through a cookie press and sprinkled with more vanilla sugar. Delicious and perfect with a hot cup of tea or coffee. I recommend a simple cookie press design .

It is a nice little cookie dough to have on hand to bake up and to go with tea or coffee and ice cream. The vanilla sugar was great and is a nice substitution for recipes calling for vanilla extract and sugar. The cookie batter was dry at first so I added the egg white and it came together perfectly.

I made these for Christmas last year. They were fantastic. The vanilla flavor is so intense. Perfect with a cup of tea. They are a permanent addition to the cookies I make for Christmas.

I've made these cookies twice. With the first batch I only had time to keep the vanilla beans in the sugar overnight so I don't think the flavor was strong enough. Then the dough was crumbly and very difficult to work with. For instance, I could not manage the points of the stars to stay pointy and the dough kept pulling apart as I lifted them up, so I ended up cutting "moons" out of the rim of a glass. I dipped the finished and cooled cookies in melted white and dark chocolate. However, they tasted delicious and I had a spousal request for more. I went right ahead and made the vanilla sugar weeks in advance. This time, I also added more butter (2 sticks instead of one and 5 T) and used a sheet of plastic over the dough to roll it. I used a less intricate cookie cutter with the first batch and the second was pressed into a pan like shortbread. A LOT less frustration! Parchment paper is a must for the pans. They came out better in my opinion, than the first batch. If you love shortbread and vanilla, these cookies are worth the effort of working with a delicate dough.
