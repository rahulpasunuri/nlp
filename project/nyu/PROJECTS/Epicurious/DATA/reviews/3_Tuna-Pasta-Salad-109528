I liked this one, but I did add a few extras...I kept out the beans for the reason I'm not a bean fan, but I did add garlic powder to taste, Itialan seasoned crutons (crushed), and a few baccon bits just a sprinkle. Also choped celery would make a great addition, even tho Im not a fan of that either...Its just a thought to kick it up a bit.

I thought this was just ok. It was very lemony but kind of boring overall.

This was really good. I left out the beans, and intended to add chopped celery - I forgot, but do believe it would have been a nice addition. I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/4 cup dijon mustard, and it worked well. The lemon flavor in this dish is excellent.

I'm not in love with this recipe. I'd be good as a light lunch, but I wouldn't serve it as the main dish, as the recipe suggests. I added extra tuna, and my husband and I still felt it lacked something.

This recipe was fantastic with a few minor adjustments: 1/4 c. mayo and 2/4 c. dijon; sprikled dried tarragon instead of fresh basil; for texture, sliced and chopped 2 celery stalks. Before serving, I topped the bowls with freshly grated parmesan - delicious. It got great reviews, and went straight from the table to my cherished cookbook.

Finally, to add some texture I sliced and chopped two celery stalks and added to the mix. It has gone straight from that table to my cherished cookbook.

I made with this recipe with cooked cold rainbow trout. I think it would work well with salmon as well. didn't have the beans at hand so I did without. It was fabulous.

Limited to what I had on hand, but we loved it and this is a keeper. I used lime instead of lemon, tuna in water not oil (added a splash of olive oil, used two cans), lite mayo, blackeyed peas instead of white beans, and dried basil. With the exception of the last, this would be perfectly great as made.

Loved this recipe. My party guests all agreed, even the kids. I added more lemon zest and Italian parsley with the basil, and it was perfect. Make sure you use the tuna in oil so it has the nice flavor. Great summer recipe.

I made two batches and served the next day (stirred in basil just before serving)for a PTO lunch, to lots of compliments. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't think it was better next day; lost its creamy mayo texture to pasta absorption. Better after coming back to room temp, but still not as good as fresh. Still, I'll make it again! Great lemon flavor.

I was surprised at how good this was. Used two cans of tuna instead of one. Next time, I will double the amount of lemon juice and use fresh basil (only had dried basil this time around). My husband, who is not particularly crazy about pasta salads, really liked this one.

One of my favorite lunchtime salads to take to the office.

I love this recipe! I recently traveled to Spain and brought back with me their delicious tuna in olive oil and was so thrilled to find a recipe I could use it with. I followed the directions but used just a little more than half of the cooked pasta and also added some cooked cocktail shrimp. The flavors are superb and I will no doubt make it again. The sauce that the mayo and lemon juice makes is similiar to an aioli I had all over Spain. It's great with all kinds of fish. Love it!

Added in roasted red peppers as someone earlier suggested; also used less mayo and added dijon and balsamic vinegar. Recipe says serve room temp but I think it's better chilled - after a night in the fridge.

I increased the mayo and added Dijon mustard. It did taste better the next day.

I made this recipe exactly as written, but decided to add a roasted red pepper for added flavor and color. I am hoping that this dish will improve overnight. It is incredibly overpowered by all the lemon. Seems that is all you could taste. No one cared for it at my house and I could not even pawn it off on my friends to take home. This pasta and bean salad was a major disappointment. I won't make it again. I think you have to be a real lemon fan to like this dish.

This dish was quick and easy to prepare. It was fresh and delicious. Next time, I'm going to add some red bell pepper for color and taste. As another reviewer pointed out, it was even better the next day.

Great Party/Picnic Salad. I went heavy on the basil, next time I will probably add more lemon zest. Will make again & again.

I was excited to make this recipe since I had all of the ingredients in my cabinet--cheap! When I had it for dinner I thought it was pretty bland but, like most pasta salads, it's flavors really came out the next day. A good choice when nothing else is in the fridge.
