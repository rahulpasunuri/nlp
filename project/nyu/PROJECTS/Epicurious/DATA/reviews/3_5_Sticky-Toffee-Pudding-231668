I was skeptical when I saw that this Sticky Toffee Pudding recipe had only 1 egg, while most others on epicurious had 4. But since I had only 1 egg left in my fridge, this recipe would have to do! I was amazed with the results - the cake portion was light, well flavored and well balanced, and the caramel sauce (which I halved) made the result decadent. When you simmer the chopped dates, they essentially melt into the cake batter, so you don't bite into any chunks of dates after its baked. I baked this in a deep-dish pie-plate and poured the sauce over. This was so easy, and the results so outstanding that I would make it again for guests!

I made this for a family gathering and it went over in a big way. Even people who normally turn down dessert were asking for some. They would have a bite of somebody's (after the somebody insisted) and then came over and asked for a piece. Really delicious. We served it with a bit of vanilla ice cream on the side and covered in the caramel sauce.

Had to make this with gluten free flour as we had a gluten intolerant friend in our group. What a Huge success. I do not like dates but they only enhanced the texture. At the end of the meal as I went to scrape the crumbs left from the serving plate a cry went up from those in the kitchen as they dove to get those last few crumbs!

I thought it was delicious. Has to have either whipped cream or vanilla ice cream and has to be served warm. My cousin also tried the recipe and she said it turned out great.

My son fell in love with sticky toffee pudding while on vacation in Scotland. I was thrilled to find this recipe and even happier with his reaction. It was a hit. Very easy to make and a nice break from the standard dessert.

Delicious! One of the simplest desserts I have ever made but ended up being a crowd pleaser! I put slightly less brown sugar in the cake mixture as I was using very sweet Medjool dates. Also added a few tablespoons of heavy cooking cream to the sauce to make it more of a caramel sauce. I made my pudding in mini loaf pans as i thought this would plate nicer. Served with Vanilla Ice Cream. Everyone licked their plates clean!

Made this for Christmas dessert. It was definitely caramelly (not really a word but... Since I didn't have the time to cook this in the afternoon while my guests were here, I made it the night before and then reheated the pudding and the sauce, combined them then served it. While it was good, not really a rave dessert. Yummy and easy though.

I love this recipe. It's so simple and so good. After reading many reviews, I decided to substitute the water which the dates are simmered in, for coffee, which adds a really nice flavor. This must be served with something like vanilla ice cream, and must be served warm! So yummy.

Discussing, so disappointing. Way too sweet and the flavors are terrible. I made it for a dinner party and was so embarrassed. I wish I had done a test run like I usually do.

NO TASTE WHATSOEVER! The only good part of the "pudding" was the toffee that soaked into the layer. Other than that, because my boyfriend has a big sweet tooth, he enjoyed it (but I think it was because he was very hungry at the time!) I would never make this again!

This pudding is deceptively easy. I used 8 ounces of dates and cooked them in 1 cup of cold coffee. They went to pulp once cooked and there was no need to cut them beforehand. In preparation for Christmas dinner, I made the pudding ahead and prepared the toffee sauce on the day. Everyone nearly licked their plates. Impress your guests and yourself. Simply lush.

I made the cake part of this recipe (I use my own sauce) exactly as written (I assumed the cup of water the dates simmered in was to be added to the mix). It came out rubbery, a half-inch high, and cream coloured. Nothing like the high, soft-crumble dark-looking cake in the picture. What could I have possibly done wrong?

This recipe is very tasty. The only reason it doesn't get four forks from me is that it didn't travel or age well, and by the time we got to it at the in-laws' for Christmas, it was soggy.

This is half of a good recipe. The addition of diluted coffee essence makes a huge difference to the flavor of this pudding. For the sance add cream to the melted butter and some toasted pecans. Now you have a real sticky toffee pudding. Mkae individual puddings in large muffin pans and then invert onto a jelly roll pan. When the sauce is ready pour over the puddings and place uner the broiler for a few minutes -- keep door of oven open so you see if the tops start to scorch.

Have been making this recipe for several years for annual gathering and everyone loves it. I buy whole pitted dates and skip the chopping. Boil date mixture until dates are soft. Cool mixture, pulse in blender and continue w/recipe. I also reduced the butter and use 1 1/2 sticks as found the syrup too oily with 2 sticks.

When I lived in the UK, sticky toffee pudding was my absolute favorite. This recipe is so easy and so good, there's no reason for me to crave it now that I am back in Canada. Friends and family loved it!

This was incredibly easy... I had some dates that I needed to use and had been craving some sticky toffee pudding, and despite the fact that I wasn't being the most attentive cook in the world, it came out perfectly. All the flavors I was thinking of. Mine came out a wee bit crumblier than I anticipated, so it wasn't gorgeous--but the note above the recipe said so, so no complaints here.

Excellent! Tastes as good as the Norm Thompson catalog item that cost $$$$$$!

I added a topping of tart apples caramalized in brown sugar, vanilla, and butter. YUM! This recipe is the one that everyone asks for at potluck events. A little bit will satisfy as it is exceedingly sweet.

Who would ever think that dates could taste so good in a cake? This recipe is fantastic. Very easy to make, and so yummy. Reminded me of the first time I had sticky toffee pudding in London at friend's home. I made this recipe for a friend, and while we both almost went into shock from the high sugar content of the dessert, we couldn't stop eating it. It's so rich and bad for you, but my oh my...so delicious. That being said, why not guild the lily a little more with an ice cold scoop of Haagen-Dasz vanilla bean ice cream on a warm serving of "S.T.P."?

True this pudding is rich, but it is wonderful. My young boys brag to all of their friends when they get to have this speical dessert for dinner.

I really thought this was fabulous. Its terribly rich, and benefits from a healthy dash of salt in the sauce (cuts the potentially cloying sweetness of the dates). But all I have to do is say "Sticky Toffee Pudding" and all my friends swoon. Also very easy and fast.

Good, but I slightly modified it: 1) Add a tablespoon of rum to the sauce 2) Add about 1/4 finely chopped dates to the sauce. This gives it some texture as well as cutting the richness a bit. I'll probably use the sauce this way over other things.

I followed the recipe exactly, but it was disgusting. My family would not eat it, and my husband usually eats anything!

We all really liked this dish, but agreed that the topping you pour on top is a bit much. It just made it too rich. Next time, we would skip the topping and only make enough syrup to pour into the cake and temper the sweetness by serving it with lightly whipped heavy cream.

Unlike the previous reviewer, we all liked this dessert very much and will make it again!

I love steamed and bread puddings and couldn't wait to try this recipe. What a disappointment. If I could rate this a -1 fork I would. This pudding is totally flat tasting, and the texture was not good. Don't waste your time or money on this one.

Addictive, indeed: and buyer beware, 600+ calories made for six servings, and that's before the whipped cream, the ice cream, etc. Enjoy every bite ...

Delicious! And couldn't be easier to make. I fell in love with sticky toffee pudding at the Rose & Crown Pub in Epcot. This recipe isn't quite the same, of course, but it's just like I remember it - addictive!
