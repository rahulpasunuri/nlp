Excellent flavor - tough meat. That being said, the way to go is definitely to braise the rolls,covered, in the tomato sauce, as has been mentioned, for 1-1 1/2 hours at 325. This is what I will do next time with this cut of meat.

I make the Italian version of this dish (Bracciole-"Bra-jole") which doesn't have the olives and capers, just bread crumbs, parmesan, garlic, s&p, parsley, basil, eggs, raisins or currants and olive oil. The key is that after browning the meat rolls, remove from pan, deglaze pan with white wine, reduce, add marinara sauce of choice, put meat rolls back in sauce, cover and cook in oven on low heat for at least an hour to hour and half. allow to cool slightly, slice into spirals (about 1 inch thick) for plating drizzle with sauce. (you can get creative with the filling for this. sometimes i'll add pesto or spinach leaves or roasted red peppers, etc. Also, a stronger cheese like percorino is better than parmesan)

I really can't say anything good about this recipe. The meat was tough, as others have said. The filling was salty and acidic with the capers and green olives. And the sauce was OK. I won't make again. And, really, I look to this site and these recipes to be right as written. If the meat requires braising, then the recipe should say so. To have to "fix" a recipe on this site is a waste of time.

I'm not sure if it was my technique or the beef, but this came out really tough. The sauce was terrific, though. I might try this again, but use pork or chicken. I'd also drop the olive and caper proportions.

Following the advice of other reviewers, I braised the rolls. Also, I added to the sauce: a little red wine, some shallots, etc. Really really tasty. Everyone was really quite impressed. I would recommend this recipe, but only if you read (and heed) the advice of all the other cooks!

I braised them in the sauce for about a half hour, and served the sauce and beef over pasta. I gave it three forks only because it was such a big hit with the rest of the family; I could take or leave it, though. On my own, would give it 2.

This was a great way of using the very thinly sliced steak that is sold here as minute steaks. 1/4" would be too thick, you need something more like a well-beaten veal escalope. I took 2 minute steaks per person and sandwiched the filling between them then tied up with string and cooked for just 1 min each side. My husband doesn't care for slow cooked beef olives(stewed as he calls them)but he would happily eat this again.

Fabulous combination of flavors - how can you go wrong with olives & capers! After reading about some tough beef though, I used pounded VEAL. This was terrific!

I took the advice of other cooks and braised the rolls in (GASP!) bottled spaghetti sauce. I browned the rolls on the stove top, then added the sauce and baked in the oven for 45 min at 350. I served the rolls alongside manicotti dressed with the sauce/meat juice. My butcher sliced a round steak lengthwise so the slices were about 1/4" thick, and it was easy to assemble.

This worked nicely with sirloin, but I agree that top round would have to be braised to make it tender enough to enjoy. The sirloin allowed me to cook it the way the recipe was written and intended to be - medium rare - which made for a nice presentation. Braised beef, while tasty, is nothing to look at!

I agree with the people who say this cut of meat should be a braise or a daube. The meat was a little tough; it was difficult to cook it evenly. As a matter of fact, my cuts started quite thick, but quite thin in width, so getting them into the right size and shape for rolling was no small trick. The filling tasted nice, but it wasn't something I'd make again. dbk

I would never make this recipe as written. It uses a tough cut of meat, and doesn't braise it. That, for at least two hours, should be a mandatory step. If the option were offered, this would rate a zero fork. And I don't have to make it to see the problem. Those who enjoyed it don't know what a true braciole should taste like.

The real name of this recipe is Braciole and has been an Italian staple for centuries. Some recipes called for boiled eggs, either chopped into the stuffing or a full boiled egg in the center of the "roll" (!!!). Not for me, I like the non-egg recipe better.

Most Italian Italians have been making this recipe for eons....and it MUST be cooked (simmered) in the sauce for about 2 hours or till tender unless you use beef tenderloin. It's delicious as an accompaniment to any pasta dish.

This has to cook longer... and I've made it with sirloin. Bracioli get their flavor not only from the stuffing, but from long slow cooking....I make these when I make my sauce....I'm more of a purist.. I like pieces of Romano cheese, parsley and fresh bread crumbs flavored with garlic salt and pepper, brown and then add to sauce. That's it.

Seattle has fresh tomatoes 12 months a year, and everything else you can think of in the food world.

the receipe gave all the ingredients needed but neglected to state what type meat. I've been making this for years and use very thinly sliced top round steak.

I am with Weight Watchers so I made this with chicken and reduced the olive oil in the sauce to 1 TBS Rather than cook in oil, I skewered the chicken together and grilled it instead. Worked out very well. Was very tasty and for those who are interested, calculated 7 points per serving.

I agree with most. The cut of meat was definitely too tough. Filling and sauce were nice. I think I'll make it again, as the others with chicken, or maybe a piece of mild fish or jumbo prawns.

This recipe is flawed. All other beef braciole recipes I've seen calls for simmering the beef in tomato sauce for at least an hour (I've seen up to 3 hours). This quick-cook recipe would work with sirloin, but definitely not with a top round cut.

I loved this recipe!!! The flavors were wonderful and the filling was good enough to eat by itself. February isn't exactly fresh tomato month around here so I used canned chopped tomatoes, 2 14oz cans in place of the fresh. Simple yet wonderful sauce. I also just chopped the ingredients on a cutting board instead of breaking out the food processor, it left it with more texture. I like the idea of using chicken instead of beef, will have to try that out.

Very dissapointing for the amount of work involved. My family was not impressed.

The filling and tomato sauce were wonderful! I will use these again but use chicken instead of beef. I found the cut of beef used to be tough chewy, and tasteless even after lots of pounding.

Rating: 2
We thought this recipe was mediocre and not worth the effort involved. The meat was tougher than we care for - but we aren't very big meat eaters, so take that for what it is worth. The flavors were nice together, I think I would use the filling in the future to stuff filets or as a cracker dip.

This was really good, and I'm not even a fan of Italian food. The sauce is fresh-tasting and delicious, and the olives and capers give the beef great flavor. I cooked mine 4 minutes, and they weren't rare enough. So cook them less if you like them pink. I served the beef with semolina gnocchi, which was a great match.
