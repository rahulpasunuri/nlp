I modified things a bit. First, I used cod instead of cat fish and it turned out wonderfully. Also, I followed the suggestion of others and substitude corn meal for half of the flour and then I added a little bit of baking soda. Made the slaw with broccoli slaw mix and it was very good. The fish turned out crisp and tasty. Would definitely make again.

flat beer is a must with fish batter..... if you use beer with carbonation, the batter becomes mealie, far too light and will flake off the fish..... with flat beer, it's consistent and crispy throughout.... beer is used for the flavor as well as for the yeast, so subbing sparkling water will not work..... unless you want that strange batter, this times sans flavor..... the problems with this recipe are not with the beer-- you need cornmeal and corn flour along with the regular flour if you are doing a beer batter...... different ratios of each offer slightly different variations, but all three should be used-- typically i go 1/2 corn flour, 1/4 AP, and 1/4 cornmeal...... basically, follow the steps from the previous reviewer (i just like the corn flour addition more than straight up AP flour..... less cakey, more crispy) and the heat under the oil is a must..... it's tough to get the oil too hot, unless you're using thick fillets-- over 3/4".... just watch them closely and when they are nice, golden and crispy, pull 'em out! now enjoy!

Recipe OK for a flour try turning oil to 375 will help. Better suggestions use 100% peanut oil, heat to 375 as temp will drop when fish is added. Soak fish in chilled water (NO EGG WASH) just be sure to shake off excess water before dregging. You can go simple and just use equal parts of yellow cornmeal and flour with course ground pepper and salt to taste (recommend a few shakes of tabasco before frying) or use a good louisianna style fish fry mix. But for beer batter use either of the previous suggestions and add enough beer to have a pancake batter consistancy and beer does not need to be flat. For more flavor try using the yellow cornmeal and flour suggestion and add the hot sauce in the batter with the beer along with your own blend to taste of lemon pepper and creole seasoning and/or garlic powder or cayenne pepper.

I followed the recipe exactly. The fish was bland and overly greasy. While the kids enjoyed the slaw, I've made several other varieties I've enjoyed better.

I made this with red snapper filets & fresh beer, & the batter was a little heavier than I thought it would be, but still good (not great). While I seasoned the flour enough, I would lightly season the fish before the floud dusting. When some of the batter came off & the fish eaten by itself, it was bland. Cooking time seemed right. I didn't make the slaw.

excellent recipe. however, if you're not a lover of beer, you can always use sparkling water, as it gives the batter the same light consistency.

The beer battered fish is EXCELLENT! I completely agree with another users comments that fresh beer is better. I used New Castle, and it turned out really tasty.

I have made this batter countless times for many different fish, and it's terrific! I don't use flat beer, but fresh, high quality ale. One night, on a whim, I dipped seasoned, floured slices of green tomato in the batter and fried them.....they were delicious! I've used it on scallops, shrimp and oysters, too. As long as the oil is really hot, the food isn't greasy at all, but crisp and very tasty.

My five year old gets to pick and prepare one meal each week. One particular week she chose "fish and chips!" Ok, no worries, we usually eat healthy but one meal of fish and chips won't kill us! well, out of the myriad of cookbooks I have, including several "cape cod" style cookbooks and several other "new england" cookbooks, I couldn't locate a simple beer-batter recipe! epicurious to the rescue! This is a great recipe just for the batter! It's gooey and messy to make, and puffy and greasy to eat, but we all agreed it was some of the best fried fish we'd ever had. If you're making this big of a mess, make it for a crowd!

This is one of my new favorites. The vinegar slaw is a big hit with everyone, as it is so unusual and not mayo based, so it's safe for potlucks and picnics. (I make the slaw for many such occasions) The flavor of the fish relies heavily on the beer batter, so try a good quality microbrew, such as Red Seal Ale (or even a Porter or a Stout) for tasty batter.

If only this recipe was as flavorfull as it is inexpensive to make. I
