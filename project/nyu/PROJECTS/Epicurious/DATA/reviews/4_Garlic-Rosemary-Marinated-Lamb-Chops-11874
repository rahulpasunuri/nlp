This came out very good. I just added the juice of 1 lemon into the marinade. Tasted great.

Great, easy recipe for lamb chops. I make it with lamb chops from my meat CSA and recently featured it on my blog: http://kitchenbythecove.wordpress.com/2011/05/22/spring-has-sprung-and-we-are-back/

I love this easy recipe. I do, however, add a touch of dried mint and black pepper. To the previous reviewer as to what to do with ground lamb: mix w/ a little ground beef, milk, bread crumbs, cumin, rosemary, garlic, mint, salt & pepper; make meatballs and bake. Then using pita bread find a good cucumber sauce and make gyros.

I was not a lamb lover until I made this chop recipe. Due to a half-lamb in our freezer, I have been forced to find new ways to prepare many cuts. This absolutely won me over for lamb chops! I'm preparing this again tonight for an anniversary dinner. Now, what to do with the ground lamb...?

This is the rosemary and garlic lamb recipe I'd been looking for - somehow every other one I'd done ended up not really transferring the flavor, but this one was garlicy and delicious. Also, the lemon was a surprising and welcome note. This recipe was delicious, easy, and really brought the lamb to life. Good stuff.

Hate to be a downer with all the good reviews, BUT this didn't do it for us. I was looking for a simple recipe that I could just broil and it was simple - as in boring - tasting. Maybe it would have been better on the grill.There are better lamb recipes on this site expecially the lamb with the Asian butter sauce.

I think this recipe is average. The Bon Appetit April 1999 marinade for grilled lamb chops is much better with the addition of basalmic vinegar, dijon and fresh ground pepper.

I rarely give out 4 forks, but this dish is so easy, quick, and delicious! What more could you ask for! I followed a previous cook's advice and added a little lemon juice to the marinade before marinating for around an hour. I served it with the rosemary potato wedges also on this site. I can't wait to make it again!

I love this recipe. The chops turn out great every time and everyone I have served them to loved them. The important thing is to not overcook the chops. I do about 5 minutes on each side and they are perfect.

this was easy, delicious and flavorful. due to a broiler pan that is MIA, i pan fried these for four minutes each side, served with spinach salad and roasted red potatoes it was a prefect quick and easy meal for any season.

This is the most succulent lamb dish that I have every made. It beat out the lamb chops that I was served in London which till now was my greatest lamb dinner that I every tasted.

This recipe is sensational! Fresh rosemary is better than dried here. I was making 6 chops so I increased everything a bit. I wasn't too fussy about measuring, but used a bit extra garlic because we like that. I added a little freshly ground black pepper also. This is our new special occasion meal paired with a decent merlot or pinot noir. I'd like to try this on the grill in future. I think it will be fantastic.

Very easy and very delicious. Use fresh rosemary for the best results. I make this often since it's fast for a weeknight but also elegant when paired with the right sides.

Thank you "Cook from Atlanta, GA." I tried the recipe as you suggested and found that cooking them in a pan was perfect. I'd tried several recipes broiling, but found this method, along with this recipe, much better, much more tender.

I hate to be the lone voice of dissent. I feel i am being generous rating this recipe a 2 and i only do so because the meat was juicy. unfortunately, it was also pretty gray looking. In addition, the combination of lemon rind and rosemary left a bitter aftertaste that made the meal almost inedible. Guess i missed what all the excitement was about. Wont be making this one again.

Yummy Yummy Yummy and soooo easy!!The worst thing about this is I discovered my broiler was broken, and had to pan sear instead. Still yummy!!!

So simple to prepare and the flavor of the marinate was perfect and didn't overpower the taste of the lamb...just complimented it. Definitely a keeper.

I make this regularly and it is always delicious. I prepare them over medium high heat in a grill pan about 4 minutes per side. They are much more moist than when prepared under the broiler.

Great receipe. One of our favorites for Lamb Chops. Very easy to make.

These were delicious! In place of the fresh rosemary I used 1/2 teaspoon of herb de provence. I also added a couple shakes of meat tenderizer. I used the little lamb loin chops and broiled both sides for about 5 minutes. This recipe is quick and easy for dinner party or weeknight fix!

Very good and easy to put together. I marinated the chops about two hours and that seemed to be sufficient time for the marinate to do its thing. We didn't find the rosemary to be overwhelming.

Rating: 2
We were excited by the positive reviews and cut into our chops with great anticipation, but were a bit disappointed. This recipe is good, but nothing special. The rosemary is overwhelming if you marinate it as long as others have suggested - 3hrs. I suspect it would have been a bit better with less time. My husband, son, and I are huge lamb fans and search high and low for new recipes. Sadly, this one is not going into my cache of keepers.

Fantastic! Added jest of one lemon and about 1/2 tablespoon of the lemon juice. Marinated about 2 hours. Broiled in oven using saute pan. 4 minutes a side was perfect. Removed chops from pan and reduced 1/2 cup chicken stock and 1/2 tablespoon balsamic vinegar. Added 1/2 tablespoon butter and blended. Poured through strainer onto plate and topped with chops. What a treat!

I'm giving this 3 forks because I suspect it could have been better, but I mucked it up somehow. My b/f thought it very tasty. Marinated it for five hours, using dried, crumbled rosemary (local shop was outta fresh) and cooked them on aforementioned b/f's George Foreman grill-thingy. They were nice but not as spectacular as I was expecting, based on the reviews I read. Will try again next week with fresh herbs and a ridged pan.

This was absolutly wonderful and soooooo easy to make. I served it with roasted butternut squash and steamed broccoli with sauteed shitake mushrooms. I agree to make extra marinade and to broil for 7 minutes (still pink/red at the bone). Wow!! this is a definite keeper!!!

My wife made me make this and we were both very impressed. We like our lamb almost medium so we cooked under broiler for 7 minutes each side. Double or triple ingredients because it doesn't make a tremendous amount of marinade. Very, Very, yummy. Next time on the grill!

As a novice cook, I was hesitant to try any recipe that didn't come with a box. However, this was extremely easy and wonderfully delicious! Following some of the review suggestions, I grilled the chops after marinating three hours. I also added more garlic and rosemary. YUM!

Loved this simple recipe! I added 1 t. crushed red pepper flakes and 1 t. fresh thyme. Pepper adds to the flavor as well. Grilling is definitely the way to go! We tried using indirect heat on the grill -- middle burner turned off, while keeping the burner above and below the middle burner on medium. Turn up the heat for the last minute or so of cooking on the middle burner to nicely brown the lamb.

Consider investing in a large charcoal grill (if you don't already own one) so that you can begin grilling large quantities of this stuff as your neighbors, led by their noses, wander into your backyard hoping to snare a chop while your back is turned. Yes, it's THAT good. --t

Looking for easy but interesting recipes, my boyfriend and I tried this and LOVED it! Even though I'm clueless in the kitchen, I was able to pull this one off. Didn't have time to marinate for long, but flavor was strong after only 1/2 hour. Will definitely make again!

Magnifique! Guest raved, even those who claimed that they "didn't like lamb". I highly recommend grilling over broiling. I also added more fresh rosemary and garlic to the marinade.

My six year old daughter, on a schoolnight, asked me to prepare "spicy lamb but not too hot or anything" for dinner. I marinated for an hour in our vacuum speed marinater, then we cooked the lamb with boiled new potatoes and asparagus in about 1/2 an hour! Nice dish for a busy night, but I did find I had to quadruple the garlic and rosemary for the marinade.

This recipe is so easy and the lamb chops were very juicy. I marinated the chops for about 3 hours. If you don't want to watch the broiler for the whole time, you can also roast them for 10 min. at 500 degrees and finish in the broiler for about 3 mins (for med. rare).

I prepared these delicious chops stove-top on a teflon circular grill pan. It was too cold for outdoor grilling! They were served with "Crisp Potato Canapes w/Caviar" and a salad of Bibb lettuce, sliced Asian pear-apple, fresh raspberries, crumbled blue-cheese topped with sugared pecan bits and a raspberry vinegarette. This was a fabulous, romantic dinner for two, and great way to ring in the New Year!
