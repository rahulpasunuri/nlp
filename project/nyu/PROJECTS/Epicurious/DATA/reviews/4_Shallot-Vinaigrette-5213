Very tasty, added 2 sprays of Braggs Liquid Aminos for sweetness and umami. Yum!

Excellent vinaigrette, but I changed it to "Shallot-Lemon Vinaigrette" by adding a teaspoon of lemon zest and the juice of 1/2 lemon. Very zingy and delicious!

This dressing is a hit every time I serve it. I only use about a 1/4 of a cup of shallots and I try to make it a day ahead of time so the ingredients can marinade over night. It's great on any type of greens. I like to top the greens with some feta too. Can't miss with this recipe!

I'm not sure the oil is even necessary. I made it with a little extra mustard and no oil, and it tasted even better.

I added just 1/4 tsp of white truffle oil and it just was spectacular!

This dressing is surprisingly tasty for how simple it is. It's definitely joining the ranks of the staple dressings that I keep on hand! Yummy!

This is so easy and so great! Definitely use seasoned rice vinegar if you want this to be special. Used on "ham and spring vegetable salad with shallot vinaigrette" that this was published with but it would be great on just about any salad.

I love this dressing! I made it with mixed greens like endive, arrugula, etc. sliced new potatoes, and grilled tuna. It was easy to make, light and delicious....I will make it again.

This is such a great salad dressing. I've found that for people who like to watch what they eat and not sacrafice taste, this is it.
