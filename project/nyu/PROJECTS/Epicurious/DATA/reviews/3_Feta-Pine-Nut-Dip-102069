Feta Pine-Nut Dip can also be called Christmas Dip because of the vibrance of the green parsley and red bell pepper among the creamy white of the yogurt and feta. I increased the feta to 8 oz. and I added a bit more red pepper (the entire pepper vs. half) and had it really finely chopped. Be careful when toasting the pine nuts, they burn quickly! Otherwise this dip tastes spectacular, looks even better, and I'm expecting it to be a big hit at my holiday party.

I would make this dip again because it has ingredients I love and that are healthy. But I found the yogurt over-powering at the expense of the pine nuts. So, substitutions are definetly in order.

I used a little less yogurt (6 oz) and everyone raved about it. I made it about 2 hours before I served it, refrigerated it. Everyone raved about it. I would definitely make it again.

Rachel Ray who's on 30 Minutes Meals has a great feta cheese dip that she serves with warm pita bread. Add oregano, red pepper flakes, toasted walnuts and a full clove of garlic. Forget the yogurt and add 1/2 cup of milk. Forget the pine nuts as well. Yum!

Good but not great. I too increased the garlic although I don't think it needs more than doubling or tripling. The feta and pine nut taste comes through nicely.

This was a big hit at my Thanksgiving party. It gets better after sitting in the refrigerator. Also note that I used about ten times the amount of garlic the recipe called for.

The dip was very bland. Maybe more garlic might save it. The nuts softened very quickly. This recipe was disappointing.
