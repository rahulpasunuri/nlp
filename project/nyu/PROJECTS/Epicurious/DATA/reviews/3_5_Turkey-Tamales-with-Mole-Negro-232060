I just used this recipe for the dough and then put chicken and a 5 chile salsa by herdez inside. I also used soaked corn husks instead of banana leaves (cheap and easy to find). The dough was great! - I learned how to make these in a north west corner of Mexico. This will be my go to recipe for dough, for sure!
