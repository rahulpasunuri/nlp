This recipe wasn't bad considering the preparation time, but I'd say the gruyere is essential to giving the dish a bit of interest.

Used prosiutto and thought it was great! But next time to make it a little more like cordon bleu I think I will bread the cutlets.

Using cumin and pepperjack cheese makes this ANYTHING BUT cordon bleu. Maybe you could submit it as a recipe, but it's not a review of this one.

I used olive oil, and seasoned boneless, skinless breasts with salt, pepper and smokey paprika. I actually misread the instructions and placed my chicken in the oil, then into the oven on broil. They cooked in about 14 minutes, without turning and had a golden color. Very tender. I added sliced deli ham and pepperjack cheese, returned to broiler for 2 minutes. I served them with green beans which I drizzled with the hot olive oil in the pan. My husband said "write this one down honey" Next time I will add some cumin and garlic powder and make it a "southwestern cordon blue". Yum.

I made this last night. My daughter and granddaughter liked it. It was good, not great. But I couldn't justify spending $8 for 1/2# of cheese, so I substituted swiss. I would like to try it with the gryere, but will have to wait for more plentiful times. I will make this again, it is a great dish for when you don't want to spend the whole evening in the kitchen.

Excellent taste. Simple ingredients and easy to make. I substituted black forest ham and provolone and one tbsp. butter and one extra-virgin olive oil. Enjoy!

Not bad -- certainly a quick and easy weeknight dinner meal. Doesn't replace the real thing in my books though...

This is a very easy, quick meal that is as simple as it is delicious. I used a sharp deli Swiss cheese on top and it tasted very nice.

so easy and truly fast - used prosiutto instead of ham and skipped the salt - fantastic!

I thought this was a great dish. Something simple enough to serve to picky eaters like my meat and potatoes dad, but easily dressed up with a couple nice sides.

Good, quick recipe. I also used deli ham and improvised with the havarti cheese that I had on hand. I cut the chicken breasts in half to cook quicker and used olive oil instead of butter.

Good and quick! Everyone loved it, including my one and a half year old, my three year old and our picky nanny! I added a bit of Horseradish Dijon mustard and used Vermont sharp cheese and i came out super! I will def. add to the rotation.

Very Easy to Make; especially for a week night dinner. I used deli Ham and Swiss Cheese and it tasted great. The cheese wasn't too greasy after heating up. Instead of butter, I used regular cooking oil.

I made this recipe at the last minute and used what I had on hand. I cut out the butter to saute and used extra virgin olive oil. I then used ham (not boiled, yuck!) and swiss cheese. I did not have spinach so after I broiled I added arugula and drizzled with a little olive oil. Very easy and good to make in a pinch!

This is very tasty and easy to make. I would give it 4 forks with tweaking. I followed the suggestions of previous reviews. I sauted my hand full of spinach first (in a tad of bacon grease). I browned my meat in half butter, half light EV olive oil. I used VA baked ham, because I can't understand why anyone would use boiled ham. I substituted grated mozarella and provalone, which is what I happened to have, but they also melt and brown nicely, and taste good! I layered it as chicken, spinach, little cheese for glue, ham, lots of cheese. Note that the ham shrinks in the broiler, so be generous. This recipe looks nice and tastes great!

This was so much easier than traditional Cordon Blue and delish! I did not have the spinach so I subbed in some of my home-made oven roasted tomatoes. I know it took the flavor to a whole other dimension, but it was so good, my husband said not to make it any other way.

I opted for proscuttio rather than ham and was very very pleased! It was a delicious meal. I served it with sauteed spinach (the remainder of the package) and glazed carrots!

good for a quick weeknight meal. i used garlic and lots of dried herbs in addition to the salt and pepper and sauteed both sides of the chicken. didn't used any spinach. also, i didn't grate the gruyère, just sliced it. my family liked the dish.

This is quick and filling, nothing to write home about though. I subbed thinly sliced Fontina for the Gruyere. Next time I'll add some Dijon mustard as suggested by the cook from Santa Barbara.

Very bland, and the Gruyere melted into an oily mess on the bottom of the pan. Will try again, but next time will use a more flavorfull ham (such as smoked or Virginia), will season the chicken with more flavor, and will choose a cheese that melts better--Possibly Havardi. I wuold also recommend a quick saute on the spinache first. That way you can add more nutrition to the dish, and, when the recipe is prepared as written, the raw spinache gives up it's liquid into the botton of the broiler pan, adding to the greasy, icky goo that the cheese leaves.

Quick and reasonably east, but very dissappointing as written. Boiled Ham was very bland and didnt contribute any flavor to the dish, and the Gruyere (I sued a very good quality) was greasy and hard/rubbery after broiling lightly. We will try again, but next time will season the chick a bit more, use a more flavorfull ham like a smoked or Virginia and probably a more attractively-melting cheese...Havardi maybe. Would suggest schiffenade of the spinache and a quick wilt as well, as it gave up it's water in the botton of the pan and contributed to the overall icky look of the greasy cheese goo.

What a great healthy version of my all-time favorite chicken recipe. Also so time- saving, and the flavors are excellent.

What a quick and easy dinner! It was done in no time and was very tasty. Yes, I will make it again.

Very bland. Filling, but flavorless. Better with Dijon mustard.
