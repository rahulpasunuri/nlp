Pretty solid chicken dish. Used skin-on parts and browned first in butter/ olive oil mix. I think that really helps with the flavor. Spooned out most of the fat before adding the onions. Taste and season the sauce at the end. If you salted/ peppered the chicken pieces well before browning, the sauce will likely not need much adjusting. The Meyer lemons were important. They taste different then 'regular' lemons. They are readily available around here, so no need to substitute. Served over couscous that we amended with a gremalota (a little garlic, lemon zest and parsley, minced very fine). Everyone seemed to enjoy, and wanted to take home leftovers (we made two batches). We will definitely add this to our chicken rotation. Will probably use all thighs next time (w/ skin and bone) for even better flavor. That should raise it to 4 forks.

I used regular lemons. I left the skin on the chicken; after removing the chicken from the heat, I removed the skin and the bones and tore the chicken into bite sized pieces. This was easier to eat. Delicious!

I added diced tomatoes, some chopped up dried prunes and golden raisins, and even some canned drained apricots. I sear the chicken off first until the skin is crisp, then peel off and discard the skin, and use the chicken infused oil as the starting oil for cooking the meal.

My go-to chicken recipe! Delicious! Sometimes, instead of olives, I add tomatoes and prunes.

This recipe is delicious if you use meyer lemons as recommended. They are much more mild than regular lemons and are crucial to the flavors of this dish working well. I sliced the olives in half but that really is just a presentation preference. I recommend as others dusting the chicken with flour and browning it lightly before starting with the onion. Sauce is delish. Enjoy!

Rating: 3
Pretty good (not earth-shattering) and easy recipe. I had the milder meyer lemons on hand to use, and I didn't have a problem with the dish tasting sour. I used thighs only, dredged them in flour and browned them in the oil first thing and then proceeded. The result was the sauce thickened up nicely without my having to cook it down. I went a bit lighter on all the spices because I made a half-batch with four thighs, but I kept the spice proportions and none of them struck me as too overbearing on the overall flavor. I served it over rice to get the full use of the sauce/gravy. Pretty, pretty, preeetttty...good!

Very good! I did make it with preserved lemons instead of fresh ones and used chicken breasts only. I totally omitted all additional salt, since the preserved lemons have so much already. It was still very salty--that has nothing to do with the recipe, it's my fault--but the leftovers were much more mellow and really, really good! I'll definitely make it again but I'll use less preserved lemon or rinse it first. Mmmm mmmm good!

After reading several of the reviews on this recipe, I was bit cautious, but tried it anyway. While it was cooking my house smelled AMAZING. I couldn't help thinking "this is either going to be fabulous or inedible." Well, my family (husband & two young boys) LOVED it. There wasn't a morsel left. I opted for bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, which I browned first. But I'm going to skip that the next time I make it and just use boneless, skinless chicken thighs, which will cut down on prep & cooking time, and make eating easier, too. Served it with couscous. Would even make this for a casual dinner party -- I can make it before guests arrive, my house will smell wonderful when they walk in the door, and I can let it cook while I mingle & chat.

this is an easy week night recipe if you have the chicken already cut up and you do as the other reviewers have done in browning the meat first. my boyfriend loved it and he doesn't even like green olives. i did half the amt of cinnamon and added around 3/4 cups of halved olives. served over rice. very very easy.

I have made this recipe several times now, and I love it, with the following modifications: --I peel the lemons and then remove as much of the pith as possible, to reduce bitterness. I use regular lemons and usually cannot get Meyer lemons. --I use half the amount of cinnamon. --I use chicken thighs, not a whole chicken. --I do slice the olives. --I add some flour to thicken the sauce at the end.

I followed this recipe exactly except I did not remove the skin from the chicken and I browned it before I started the onions. We served it over a rice pilaf with almonds and dried cranberries and the sweetness of the cranberries really balanced the olives. It was easy to make and quick enough for a weeknight!

Really liked this. I did brown the chicken before starting the onion, though, and used preserved lemon instead of fresh (this would definitely tone down the sourness some people were complaining about).

Rating: 1
Would not make this ever again! I love the taste of lemon, and I followed this recipe to a tee, but the end result was completely inedible. The sauce was sour beyond belief. Not sure if this is an acquired taste . . . . To salvage the sauce, I added whipping cream, butter, and some sugar to balance the acidity. This helped, but the dish was *still* too acidic/sour for my taste. Very unfortunate, since I was excited about making my first Moroccan dish!

I cannot stop making this dish-it is SO good. I make it at least once every couple of weeks or so because I crave the lemon/cinnamon/cumin/ginger combination. It's so easy, uses ingredients I always have, and has so much flavor. I normally use bone- in chicken thighs that I remove the skin from to make it easier and it's absolutely wonderful. Probably my favorite chicken recipe.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe a few times and it always come out good, my family loves it. I use regular lemons but only use juice of half a lemon (about 1 tbsp) at the end which I think is the perfect amount. Also I brown the chicken a little bit in the beginning, set it aside then add & brown the onions. I love the flavors of this dish, and it's perfect over couscous to soak up the sauce. Any left over is good for brown bagging the next day.

Rating: 4
I LOVE this recipe. I use more lemon than called for sometimes and I still like it, but I can see how some people might not like it so briny-I also go heavy on the cinnamon and cumin. The thing I like most about this recipe is that you get nice Moroccan flavors with mostly common ingredients that I always have on hand. Most similar recipes I've looked up call for preserved lemons or harissa--things that most people don't have in their kitchens. It's nice that this recipe doesn't require buying expensive and less available ingredients. I've made it at least 10 times now and I plan on making it a lot more!

Very tasty dish! I kept it pretty true to the original, but I did sub 1 clementine orange for 1 of the lemons. I also shook the chicken pieces in a ziplock with a little flour to help thicken the sauce, as another reviewer suggested. My daughter (7) helped me make it and she absolutely loved how it smelled AND tasted. We will make this again.

I'm from Moroccan parents and this recipe tasted exactly like my mother's. Yes, there's a touch of bitterness from the lemons but that's how it's supposed to taste. Usually most Moroccan recipes use preserved lemons but i've had it with both and it tastes the same. Very easy to follow.

Rating: 2
I really didn't like the way this one turned out. The chicken ended up with a bitter taste to it, and I used oranges instead of lemons as other reviewers have suggested. I made it in the crock pot, so the chicken was super tender and juicy, but the bitterness took over. Maybe I would omit the citrus altogether if I tried it again.

Rating: 0
This is a great recipe. The changes made it even better. I use boneless and skinless chicken legs, thighs and breasts(cut in 11/2 inches pieces). Before adding the chicken to the broth mixture I use a plastic bag in which I mix 2to3TB flour, some salt and pepper. I add the chicken , shake the bag to cover the pieces with the flour and saute the chicken in olive oil till lightly browned. Add to the simmering broth and cook for 25-30 mn. This will make the gravy thicker and delicious. Serve over couscous

Rating: 4
wow! not too sour for me and I used 1 meyer lemon from my tiny tree and 1 store bought one. I also probably used more than the 2 tablespoons of juice. I used half calmata olives instead of all green. I put a splash of OJ to sweeten it and served it over quinoa This was the christening meal to my "new" '50's o'keefe and merritt 6 burner double oven stove. I wouldn't have it any other way! I had chicken tagine at a fancy london restaurant last summer and this was better. It makes me want to go out and buy a tagine.

This is a really nice go-to recipe for me. I've made it twice and both times have been really pleased with the result. I don't usually make a full 4 servings, in which case I just get some legs and thighs instead of the whole bird!

This recipe was very good, and easy to make. I used lemons from my friend's backyard, which are sweeter than store-bought, but not as sweet as Meyer. I used cut-up chicken thighs (with skin) and breasts. Instead of sliced onions I pureed them (I just prefer the texture better), and added sliced mushrooms with the onions. The mushrooms really soaked up the flavor, which I enjoyed. I only used 1 tsp of cinammon (as I ran out). I did not read the comments in time to remove the white parts from the lemons, but I added a pinch of demerara sugar at the end, which sweetened the broth just a touch. I would definitely make this again, but I would love to try Meyer lemons, and serving with couscous.

I thought this recipe was pretty awful. I made it as described, got great chicken and olives - although did use regular lemons- and just found it bitter to the palate and lacking the sweetness and complexity of Moroccan food I have eaten in restaurants. Very disappointing -I would not make it again.

Rating: 4
Amazing recipe! I took heed to the other reviews with regard to too much lemon. Instead of any lemon, I used two clementine tangerines. My kids went CRAZY for this. I served it with basmati rice since I was out of couscous, and added saffron and chicken broth. Will make this again and again!

Followed suggestions from other reviewers and used the crock pot. The flavors on the chicken were great but the sauce did nothing for the dish. I threw out the remainder of the sauce (along with the recipe) and will finish the chicken.

Rating: 4
I followed this recipe almost to the letter, with the exception that I cooked it for about 50 minutes to tenderize the chicken, and I broiled it briefly (5 minutes) in order to get a browned outside. I also added the chicken back into the sauce after it cooked down a little, and then allowed the whole thing to cook down further until it was almost a gravy. This allowed the sauce to stick to the meat more. Using Meyers lemons, this dish does not come out too lemony, although I can see how using regular lemons might do that. The nice thing about the dish is that you get a lot of flavor with very little fat. I served this over whole wheat couscous with some toasted sliced almonds feta cheese.

Rating: 4
This was a fantastic and delicious, EASY dinner! Great combination of flavors, even for those who don't typically prefer dishes with a lot of unusual spices. I cooked this using thigh and drumstick pieces in my slow cooker - I just love the tender, meat-falling-off-the-bone result that cooking style imparts. I made the recipe as- stated with a few minor exceptions, the first of which was to use 1.5 cups of vegetable stock (didn't have any chicken base on hand) and a half cup of dry white wine, instead of 2 cups of stock. I followed another reviewer's lead and browned the chicken in a saute pan in olive oil first, then added it to the crock pot, followed by the saute'd onions, lemon wedges, and stock/wine. My husband does not like the texture of even thinly sliced onions in his food, so I pureed the onions before sauteing... this also had the added benefit of helping thicken the sauce nicely while cooking. Cooked for 2 hours on high, then added in all the spices/garlic and cooked for another hour or so. I also added a few good pinches of saffron to the blend. To finish, I removed the chicken pieces and broiled in a preheated oven for 4 minutes (to crisp up the skin perfectly), while I added a few slices of salted butter, the lemon juice, and the olives to the sauce. Served over basmati rice that I made in my rice cooker, to which I added a few dashes of turmeric, a few cardomom pods, and a pinch of saffron as I was preparing it. My husband and his hungry friends (with great timing) who stopped over for a visit absolutely loved it, as did I! :)

This is an absolutely fabulous recipe I have made many times already. I have made a slight addition to the sauce. At the end, I reduce the sauce by half, then whisk in 4 tablespoons of butter. Served over couscous it is positively divine. Give this one a try, you won't be sorry!

I thought the chicken was wonderful but the sauce was too bitter and acidic for my taste. After reading all the other reviews I have a feeling I must have done something wrong.

Rating: 4
This is a similar dish to one that my grandmother would make and has remained legendary in our family though no one has been able to reproduce it. I decided to try it, using my slow cooker instead of cooking it stove top. I used only legs and thighs and I left the skin on the chicken and browned the pieces first. I also sauteed the onions before combining the stock, onions, lemons and chicken in the slow cooker. On high I set the timer for 3.5 hours. After 2 hours, I added all spices, olives, garlic and salt and let it go for the remaining 1.5 hours. It ended up working out extremely well and was delicious served with steamed, basmati rice seasoned with saffron.

Addendum, once the flavors sat together for a while the dish was much tastier.

The Chicken was wonderfully Tender. I like to cook with thighs. It was citrus filled and amazing and a HIT last night for dinner!

I have made this twice now, and LOVE this dish. One very important thing: definitely use thin-skinned lemons OR you can also peel the thicker lemons (like they're an orange) and add back just some of the zest/yellow part. As others have said, removing the pith (white part) of the lemons takes away the bitterness. The olives are key and add a lot to the dish. I also used chicken breasts, cut into pieces and served it over whole wheat couscous. Delicious and easy!

Rating: 3
I loved this dish, though I simmered it a little longer than recommended, so the sauce thickened a little more. I also added some carrots, which cooked perfectly! Next time I would omit the olives... they were completely superfluous. Maybe I will try it with chopped olives instead. Excellent on top of couscous!

I liked this a lot but thought it would be a good idea to brown the chicken ( skin side down) first for a few minutes. I think the flavors were wonderful, the lemons and olives are a great combo, but I found myself wanting a little sweet too. I think next time I'll add some figs while the whole thing is cooking. I'll definitely make it again.

This dish is absolutely delicious. I could not find meyer lemons, but used thin skinned organic lemons which became very flavorful and easily edible after cooking. This is an impressive yet easy and healthy dish that is sure to be a family or crowd pleaser. I made it with the Parmesan Polenta (substituting manchego instead of parmesan) and this was a perfect compliment.

Rating: 3
Three spoons for how easy this was and the overall taste was nice. But a tad too lemony for me. I cut the recipe in half, using only one lemon, it was still a little overpowering. I used two boneless chicken breasts and cut them in three which worked really well (cutting the cooking time in half). I too deglazed the pan at the end with a tad of butter. Served over basmati - quite nice, but not quite a four spooner.

Loved it loved it loved it. Delicious and sooooo easy. I just used thighs instead of the whole chicken, and added chunks of potatoes at the same time so it became closer to a one-dish meal. Otherwise I followed the recipe precisely (except added extra olives at the end because I love olives) and it was wonderful. Chicken was fork-tender, and the blend of flavors superb.

Just made this-wonderful! I used regular lemons- I was told Meyer lemons are in season in Sept. I cut away as much pith as possible. The lemons were a little bitter, but not too bad, As others stated, it makes a lot of juice- use a Dutch Oven. I browned the chicken with skin on , then removed, poured off the fat and deglazed the pan with the chicken broth. Came out great!

Rating: 4
If not using meyer lemons use very thin skinned lemons (very little pith) so the dish does not taste bitter. I also left the chicken skin on and browned it first for colour, flavour and to render out the fat and used green olives stuffed with jalepenos. YUMM

My boyfriend just made this for me, and it was delicious! I loved the sweet tanginess of the sauce and the chicken became so tender.

This wasn't terrible...just not as amazing as I had hoped. The flavor of the sauce was nice, though I did not particularly care for the bitterness the lemon wedges imparted to it. The chicken did not absorb much of the flavor--disappointing. I probably will not do this again, though I really wanted to like it.

This recipe was as amazing as it was simple. My house filled with the aroma of the recipe and I had to fight my wife and my dog out of the kitchen trying to get at it before it was done. One alteration I did was to throw the chicken back into the pan after the base was reduced to put a little bit of crust on the chicken.

This dish is fantastic! The flavor is unbelievably tasty for so little work. The only thing I did differently was to whisk butter into the sauce at the end to give it some body.

I've made this twice now with chicken thighs. My partner absolutely loves it--it's one of his very favorite dishes, and he hates green olives.

Wow - excellent blend of flavors in this dish that make your innards sing sweet little nothings to one another! I kept finding myself wanting to take the lid off and smell it as it was cooking - amazing aromas. It was easy to make with simple ingredients - used regular lemons - asking the butcher to remove the skin and cut into pieces saved time. Would serve with white rice next time to make full use of the tasty broth. I'm currently sharing this recipe with everyone I know who likes to cook!

The sauce was tasty and the lemon flavor was really bright without being bitter, but I thought there was too much paprika and too much sauce for the amount of chicken even after the reduction. The suggested cooking time also wasn't long enough for the chicken to be as tender as I like.

Actually, I would like to rate this recipe 3 1/2 stars. I followed the recipe exactly, except I had to use regular lemons. I looked everywhere for Meyer lemons without success. Perhaps that would push it to 4 stars. As soon as I find them, I'm making this recipe again!

Relatively simple to make, this dish packs a ton of flavor. We found it was cost efficient to make with not too many costly ingredients. My boyfriend and I are constantly on a search for healthy meals that don't taste like a diet. This one certainly falls into the category. If you like a citrus taste and are into green olives, this dish will leave you wanting to cook it again and soon, it even made great leftovers for the next day. I highly recommend this recipe as we found it to be very enjoyable, cost effective and not too difficult to make.

This was absolutely delicious... I doubled the recipe, and it still came together quickly. I bought oil-cured green olives (not canned) and used their oil to supplement what the recipe required. I browned the skinless, unfloured chicken parts first, then set them aside and continued with the recipe, using a mix of Spanish and sweet onions. I stuck to the ingredients, but eyeballed the amounts of the spices and more than doubled the broth, so that so that when I added back the chicken to simmer, there was plenty of liquid, and it looked more like a stew than a sauce. The real revelation was the Meyer lemons, which tasted like lemon marmelade wedges!! If you can get them, I'm convinced they make the dish [and keep it from becoming too sour, as some have complained]. I served this over Israeli/grande cous cous, with a baby lettuce salad liberally sprinkled with fresh Italian parsley and a carrot salad with raisins, EVO and blood orange juice. Would make again, and frequently.

This was an excellent dish. I think two key ingredients are meyer lemons (I can imagine how standard lemons might make it too bitter) and great green olives.

My family did was not crazy about this one. I liked it, but kids and hubby did not. I think the lemons added a bit too much bitterness to the sauce.

Everyone who walked into my house while this dish was cooking was amazed by the aromas. It was wonderful. We eat low carb so I just served the chicken with sauce in a large wide individual soup bowl accompanied with a simple green salad. Delicious! I love lemon but I agreed that the sauce was very heavily sour. I added 1 Tbsp brown sugar and it smoothed out the sour perfectly.I also felt there was not enough sauce for leftovers. I would double the chicken broth, onions and keep the spices and garlic the same. We all loved this recipe.

I made this with boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I had the same problem others have mentioned about there being too much lemon, which turned bitter-tasting in next day's leftovers. (And I really like lemon.) However, the flavors apart from this were really quite wonderful. I ended up serving it over plain basmati rice with some raisins tossed in, which offset the sourness. I wonder why some of us are getting this sour result? I'll keep working with it. The recipe is way, way too good to abandon.

Being married for almost 53 years, I wanted to try meals from different countries - this one filled the bill. I used chicken thighs, because they were on sale and we like them. I only used 1 lemon for the pot and RealLemon for the sauce. The lemons were too hard to get enough juice. I served with Near East Rice Pilaf w/garlic & herbs. My husband liked the taste. I didn't change anything in the recipe (although I did think twice about the cinnamon), and it turned out great. It needs a little while longer cooking - maybe 40 min total. I will definitely make again and am emailing the recipe to several of my friends. Thank you.

I used sliced olives without pimentos because the recipe did not specify. I baked the chicken instead of cooking in the skillet, and it turned out amazing.

I was looking for a dish I could serve to my mediterranean friends. I tried it first and I found it delicious so I'll serve for many more occasions. I made some changes: I used skinless chichen legs and breasts which I dipped in 2TB of flour, salt and pepper(using a plastic bad) ,then sauted in a little olive oil, till lightly brown. The flour will thicken the sauce, so no need to reduce it at the end. I use 1 inch of fresh ginger thinly sliced. I didn't like the greens olives, too salty. The lemon juice at the end is a must. I served with quinoa and it was DELICIOUS!!!,but couscous would be great too.

This was one of a few recipes that i have been asked the recipe for. It is a good simple way to share great dish with a lot of people. Served with pita bread and some other sides this was the hit at our annual block party this weekend as well as with the Poker Guys. Taste is very subjective in this one as you can add more spice or reduce it as you wish but this recipe alone as written is a very good one. Thanks from the Poker Guys and the Neighborhood.

French792 from Tallahassee, FL...Which Persian Rice recipe are you refering to? There are a few here. Thank you!

delicious, flavorful, easy and can be made with on hand ingredients. Good week night meal as well as for guests. The perfect recipe.

Good recipe,even better the second day. I took the advise of other reviewers and used a little less lemon, and also doubled the spices.

Rating: 3
Delicious! I especially appreciate the method, ie. braising skinless, dark meat chicken without browning it first (which so often results in gummy, rubbery skin.) I plan to use this method in other settings. Great!

this is a variation on a dish universally called "tagine" because it is meant to be made in a clay cooking pot with a clay dome lid (looks like a rounded pyramid)known as a tagine. instead of the chicken broth (yuck!) use several roma tomatoes, cut into quarters and added with the chicken and cooked about 30 minutes until the tomatoes are cooked down and the chicken is tender. keep the lid on, add the olives just before you intend to serve, and serve with crusty bread, boiled potatoes or warmed pita breads. i would consider the cinnamon and ginger to be optional, too, since they are not necessarily typical for this dish. a little nutmeg and paprika are, however!

I found this recipe great and simple. I used skinless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken and they cooked up great. I also used the full amount of lemon and found it worked well. This dish works great with rice or a hearty grain (quinoa, barley, etc) as a side. Enjoy!

I thought the flavor was good. Next time I would brown the chicken first as some others have suggested. I think both the chicken and sauce would have benefited.

It was pretty good but not great. The chicken is tender but I was looking for more flavor.

The dish is very flavorful, healthy, and easy. I loved it! I cooked wild rice with the leftover broth and it was a nice addition. Will def. have over and over.

This is one of my new favorite chicken dishes! I was skeptical when I smelled the cinnamon with the chicken, but it turned out amazing! I didn't change a thing and, unlike previous reviews, thought the amount of lemon was perfect. Next time I think I'll only use chicken thighs because the breasts were a little dry. Don't skip out on the olives, it really adds to the dish. I would also recommend serving it with couscous and spoon the sauce over it.

Amazing! I was wary all the way through this recipe, but it turned out perfectly. I followed the suggestions of others and cut back on the lemon by half but added it on time. I also doubled the recipe as I have a really large dutch oven and decided to go for it. I am really glad I did. The smells were incredible. We served it with Couscous, but I think I would rather have served it with the recipe for Persian Rice here on Epicurious. Enjoy!

This was really good. I didn't add olives but instead used a can of black beans and the plain kashi grain mix. by adding that it made a good rice like base. Next time I'm debating using lentils and maybe some spinach. The spice combination was good.

We loved the flavour of this recipe and wouldn't change the spicing or lemons at all. I did brown the chicken first but the skin was still soft. The recipe does say "skin removed" so I might try that next time. Served it with rice and a Moroccan carrot salad - very yummy!

The flavor in this chicken dish is fabulous! I will definately make this again. The only change I will make will be to brown the chicken first...I felt as if the skin was way to soggy for my liking.

I loved it, it was easy to make and the results were delicious. The second time I made it though, I added the lemon wedges at the end and basically for decorative reasons, this helped avoid the bitterness that resulted from adding them early on.

We all really liked this recipe. The one thing I will change next time is to brown the chicken before adding it to the sauce. It didn't have as much color as I would have liked but the flavors all married very well together. I served couscous with dried cranberries as a side along with a green salad.

I would make this again, however, I would add the lemon later. My sauce was really very bitter and I'm guessing the lemon was the culprit. Other than that though, quick, easy and very tasty served with whole wheat cous cous with a few golden raisins stirred in.

the simplicity of this recipe makes the complex flavors of the finished dish all the more rewarding...so little work for such a great any night meal. my boyfriend does not like olives, i didn't put any on his plate, but as far as the sauce goes, he ate it and didn't notice a thing.

This was very good. I used chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken, but did not make any other changes.

Wonderful, quick and easy. The flavors could be a bit intense to some American's palettes, but seemed true to Moroccan cuisine. I used a deep skillet, might try a dutch oven next time because it does generate a lot of liquid. The skillet was also tight because I used a split breast and 6 thighs (no legs) instead of a whole chicken. Delicious!!!

Very good easy week night dinner. Used boneless skinless chicken breasts and they were moist, though I should have lessened the cooking time, I think. Also would use less lemon next time, it was a little strong. Probably Meyer lemons are a little more mellow that regular.

Rating: 3
I too loved everything about this recipe with the exception that I might reduce the cinnamon by just a little next time as it seemed a tad overpowering. As the previous reviewer mentioned, it truly did fall off the bone - will definitely make again (but maybe with pieces so I don't have to wrestle with cutting the chicken :).

Rating: 4
Loved it! Very easy, really big flavors (and even my critical roommate gave me high marks!) - chicken was so moist, just fell off the bone. Didn't buy a whole chicken (got 5 drumsticks and 4 thighs) and it worked perfectly. Made in a dutch oven - it generates way too much liquid to make in a skillet. Reduced the sauce for a few extra minutes. Would be great for a dinner party.

Easy recipe. I cut back on the spices a little as I thought my teenage boys would prefer it that way. It seemed to work as they both enjoyed. I had to cook the chicken for about twice the amount of time suggested.
