Delicious is the perfect word for this. Sometimes it is hard to find broccoli rabe in Nashville, but you can use pretty much any dark green vegetable that holds up. Last night we used young broccoli and mushrooms. I put the mushrooms in right after the garlic, zapped the broccoli in the microwave (steaming it this way is easier and lover carbon than boiling in water!) and then at the last minute threw in some sugar snap peas. I know this is a different recipe but we used the cooking technique and I like hearing about how other people adjust it to their needs/ingredients. We at it with crusty bread and hummus, some roasted butternut squash and red wine. It was a lovely meal that was just fancy enough for a Friday night but not time consuming or anything. The bottleneck was cooking the sausages. I like the white wine suggestion. Maybe next tie we'll drink white and I'll use a little of it to deglaze the pan!

This is one of my favorite recipes. It's quick, easy and tasty! I add some sundried tomatoes and use different kinds of sausage, and always serve it over polenta! Yum!

Nothing to write home about. A bore.

Excellent! I also served it on polenta, once with hot sausage and once with mild sausage. We liked both. I will definately make it again!

I highly recommend the addition of white wine to deglace the pan like the other reviewer mentioned. It made a huge difference. Top with fresh grated romano cheese! I recommend serving with a risotto such as a pesto or other green herb-flavored version. Using spicy italian sausage combos with the risotto even better.

I use chicken sausage in a lot of weeknight meals, and slice before heating, usually in a skillet. I made the mistake of attempting the same with the raw Italian sausage, and the sections were mushy and a little difficult to deal with. The end product was perfect for my low-carb boyfriend, and easy to doctor up for my heat craving: I dotted my own serving with Sriracha.

Recipe fantastic with added chilli flakes and garlic over a little pasta.

I made this with spicy Italian sausage rather than sweet and cooked the sausage in the pan rather than under the broiler. I also added a little white wine to deglaze the pan after cooking the sausage and garlic and before adding the broccoli rabe. My husband and I really enjoyed this simple dish!

Delicious and easy to make.

We make this all the time although rather than broiling the sausage we just cook it in the fry pan as well. We have been cooking rapini (broccoli rabe) for years but never combined it with sausage until I saw David Rocco do it on TV. Adding chili pepper adds a great kick.

This truly was easy and yummy. We served on a bed of polenta.
