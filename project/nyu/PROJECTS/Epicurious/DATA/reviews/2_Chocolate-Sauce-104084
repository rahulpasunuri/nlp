I didn't think it was possible for this to go wrong, but it did. I've made other chocolate sauces many times with amazing results, but something went off...after I had used some of the sauce, the rest turned into this oily conglomerate...it was probably the chocolate I used, but this never had the right consistency to begin with.

a bit bland, but when you need a chocolate fix for ice cream this is acceptable.

This is a very basic recipe, with a 4:3 ratio, 4 being the chocolate, 3 being the cream. While it did not taste bad, it was far too plain. It tasted of nothing but semisweet chocolate, and while I don't find the flavor offensive, it's not really the best chocolate you can find. Aside from this, it really doesn't work out that well. It becomes very thick, very quickly a it cools. Not only this, but it solidifies completely if used on icecream. I would reccomend using either a blend of milk chocolate and semisweet or dark, or just using one of the other two. Dark will produce a much more intense flavor, while milk is more suitable for those who enjoy something more mild and creamy.

I used this sauce over the chocolate souffle cake in place of the orange sauce. It was AMAZING and perfectly sated my fellow chocoholics in the office.
