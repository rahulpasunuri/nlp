I have not made this recipe either, but based on preparation of this dish, this is not a drinking chocolate. But it sounds like a pudding or mousse that might be worth trying.

I haven't made this recipe but am wondering how I could without the raw eggs and still get the same, or close to the same, results? After I saw the movie "Chocolat" I have had a craving for the thick and delicious looking hot chocolate drink they served. I wonder if this recipe could possibly taste as good as it 'looked' in the movie???!!! I just have a fear of using raw egg. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
