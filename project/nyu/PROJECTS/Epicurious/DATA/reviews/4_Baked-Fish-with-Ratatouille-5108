I agree with past reviewers that halibut is a better choice than sea bass, and I had success with other reviewers' advice to serve the fish and ratatouille over brown rice. Fabulous, easy weeknight meal with no gluten, soy, or dairy - perfect for our January "cleanse" diet.

Awesome! I added 1 medium zucchini and 2 cups of the crushed tomatoes. I also changed to the balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar and used tilapia instead of the sea bass. I think the sea bass would have made it better but my husband loved it and so did I. Will be making again! Make sure to season the ratatouille and fish well with salt and pepper!!

Very flavorful, very easy, very quick. I added zucchini and served Quinoa as a side. Only used 4 tilapia filets, so the dish was more veggie heavy than the recipe calls for. Delicious, and will make it again.

An easy recipe. It takes a little while, but the downtime is mostly baking, so it's easy to do other things. Really, really nice flavor. I used sea bass and highly recommend it if you can get your hands on it. Don't forget to salt & pepper the fish though! I did, and missed that additional punch when it was served. I added zucchini and peppers just for color.

I used the suggestions of other readers (extra peppers, onions, and adding zuchinni). I served it with soft polenta nd the results were delicious.

I use this recipe for just the ratatouille alone. I use 2 red peppers, and 1/2 cup of slivered fresh Basil instead of the oregano. I also substitute Balsamic, omit the zuccini, and use a large onion. Decrease the oil to 3 tablespoons. This has an unbeatable taste!

My store didn't have halibut(?!?) so I used sole, which I knew wasn't as substantial as this dish called for. Nevertheless, this turned out quite nicely, and I served it over brown rice. I liked it even better reheated the next day.

I want to point out that there is no zucchini listed in the ingredients, though it is referred to in the recipe. I left well enough alone and omitted it, using yellow and red peppers in a greater amount. I made it cod, and thought it had an authentic Spanish attitude that worked very well with a couscous side mixed with pine nuts and basil toasted in olive oil.

Use balsamic vinegar

The ratatouille in this is fantastic! I added fennel instead of zucchini and cooked it longer. My husband loved it, which is saying a lot.

Easy and delicious. I used halibut instead of sea bass. I made the ratatouille the evening before and let the flavor develop. I also took a reviewer's recommendation and served it with the rice/spinach/feta dish, also found on epicurious. Fabulous combination of flavors.

Was scrumptious but no "Zucchini" listed in the ingredients. So I guessed at the amount. Where's QA when they are needed?

Very nice, healthy recipe. A pity sea bass is so expensive, and often hard to find. We had to use hallibut, but it turned out just fine that way. I highly recommend serving this dish with rice: it adds texture that it otherwise sorely lacks.

Did no one notice that the Zucchini was omitted from the ingredient list?

Phenomenal.

Very nice recipe. I used cod. The ratatouille took much less time to cook than suggested. I'd definitely make it again.

Made this dish to rave reviews from my husband and father. I like to double the Ratatouille recipe in quantity as it freezes well. Just defrost, reheat and its ready for another quick dinner. I have used the Ratatouille recipe over cooked italian sausage,(which I cannot find here in Holland surprisingly) shrimp and scallops. Serve over pasta with parmsean is a deliciously quick dinner. I even have my father,in the States, making it now. I highly recommend this to everyone!

This was just wonderful. Rave reviews from all the family. I left out the fish and served it as the veg dish to sausages and jacket potatoes mid week and it was perfect. Will be making regularly for sure.

Everyone in our household loves this dish. I always add about a cup of chopped carrots.

great flavour for very little effort, can be made with whatever you have in the cupboard. this is good with any white fleshed fish.

This is a great, easy to make dish. The only thing I changed was I used more canned crushed tomatoes than the recipe called for. I was very pleased with the results of the added tomatoes. I will deffinetely make this dish again!

I agree with everyone else about its' simplicity. I also added some sun-dried tomatoes, together with hald a fennel head to complement the fish. (I would make it again - if only there weren't SO MANY other great recipes to try!)

This is a great fish dish. I served it to company and it was a hit. Simple and easy.

One of the easiest ratatouille recipes ever! It was delicious. I made it with the considerably less expensive whiting fillets and it was still great. Goes well with spinach/feta rice recipe from epicurious.

Definitely a good guest dish. The only thing I changed was to quickly saute the fish prior to placing it in the baking dish. This gave it a bit of a crust and made it quite wonderful.

This is a great recipe--one that I'll use to serve to guests. The recipe makes a good amount of ratatouille, which makes for wonderful leftovers and easy cooking later in the week.

I love this recipe because the fish comes out so moist! I've used orange roughy and it's as good or better than sea bass prepared this way.

Rating: 3
So easy and very hearty... though sea bass is not so tasty when prepared this way. The ratatouille texture is wonderful, so maybe kick up the spices with a little hot pepper? I love sea bass, so I'll definitely make again and keep playing with the ratatouille ingredients.

Thanks all of you for the rave reviews. This is fabulous. I added 2 zucchini (the amt. is missing from the recipe) and cooked the veggies in a grill pan at high heat. Added a cup of shredded emmentel cheese on top. wow

This was an absolute hit! It felt great to make fish with a healthy vegetable baked right on top. I subsituted a green pepper for the red and it turned out just perfect. I also served the vegetables over rice for a complete meal.

I served this for a dinner party and my guests loved it. I made the ratatouille sauce the night before, so there was no work involved while my guests were there (and ratatouille always tastes better the second day). This is a perfect dish to use all those great summer vegetables from the garden.

I used grouper for this dish and it was excellent. It was very easy to prepare and well worth it.

I cooked this for my fiance. He has not stopped raving about it - he loved it! Very tasty and healthy. It is also very simple to make and is not too time consuming. I used ling fillets cause they tend to keep their shape and they don't fall apart - besides I did not know what sea bass fillets were!! Would highly recommend.
