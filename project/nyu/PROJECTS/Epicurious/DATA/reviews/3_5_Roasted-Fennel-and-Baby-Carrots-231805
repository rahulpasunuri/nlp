It was good and I'll make it again - but not so wildly different from any other roasted vegetable method. The fennel seeds add interest and i think the water makes it roast more evenly. Added some onion and garlic.

Hmm, this wasn't bad. It just wasn't great. Vegetables, in roasting, ought to be be great. The fennel was a nice changeup but the result was lesser than one would hope for.

Made this for Easter brunch. Very easy and quick to put together. Added some parsnips to the mix for additional variety. Reduced oil to 2T and increased water to 4T. Well received and I would make it again.

Simple and delicious. I added some onion wedges to the mix and overall this was a big winner. Fast and easy.

Subtle flavors worked nicely together. I did add some small red new potatoes. It was the juice at the bottom of the pan that I thought was especially memorable.

This is delicious; every time I make it I get compliments and I'm embarrassed how easy it is. I use the baby carrots in the bag and extra fennel, because it disappears so quickly. the fennel seeds are a must.

Can't wait to make this again! Big hit, with the Anchovy & Rosemary Roasted Lamb. My family wasn't too sure they would like the fennel, but they loved it.Easy!

This has become a staple for me when I want to make a non fuss, tasty side dish. It's super easy with carrots out of a bag -- some good olive oil and it just cooks itself and tastes great.

Easy and good! I threw in baby carrots straight from the bag without bothering to trim or cut. The fennel had a lovely mild taste at the end. I've never really taken to the sharp/bitter taste of fennel when it is boiled. This was much better. With the carrots, it's a winner.

All the lukewarm reviews gave me pause, but I forged ahead and enjoyed this dish immensely. I did the oven dance just as written but used about 8 actual baby carrots, not 6 bunches of carrots. It was a nice, crisp addition to some of the heavier, cream-laden dishes on the table and the whimsical Peter Rabbit carrot presentation sparked some murmurings from guests (we should get these kind of carrots) and we had a nice laugh about the first time any of us had ever had fennel. I, for one, had it for the first time in college.

Made as written, except cooked always on the same rack, alone in the oven. I didn't find it to be interesting, kind of a waste of some nice veggies! [And I do like carrots, fennel, & even carrots + fennel together.]

Prepared as written, except using regular carrots cut into sticks. Simple and easy. Each veggie shines.

If you like fennel you will love this recipe. THe only people who complained about it were those who don't like fennel, everyone else raved.

Added a little color by yanking some Purple Dragon baby carrots out of my garden and kept the skins on. Easy to make and very flavorful. Next time I might 'stripe' the carrots by partially peeling the purple skin to make it more whimsical looking.

Love the fact that this recipe calls for REAL baby carrots like the fresh ones from farmers markets. It won't be the same with the pre-peeled and chopped stale "baby carrots" in a bag.

This was great and really easy. I only had regular carrots and I increased the fennel seeds by at least double. A drizzle of fruity olive oil after cooking ramped it up a bit. Served with a pan-fried mutton chop (thank you, Borough Market), this was a restaurant quality meal at home!

Lovely presentation, but the flavor is nothing to rave about. I even used a very nice olive oil. Maybe if the carrots were caramelized or something. Simple and elegant if that's what you're looking for.

This is the first time I have cooked fennel. We usually eat it raw as an antipasto accompaniment. It is delicious cooked!

Fast, easy and delicious. The flavours of the carrot and fennel really compliment each other. Served it with salmon grilled on the BBQ, but can go with a number of mains.

This was my first foray into fennel and it was both surpringly easy and incredibly flavorful... A nice mix of sweetness from the carrots with a little bitter from the fennel. The only change I made was to blanch the carrots and fennel before roasting. Overall, the dish was fantastic, and it received rave reviews from my three guests. We're making it again next week!

The addition of the fennel seeds really makes this version of roasted vegetables delicious. The method of preparation here allows the vegetables to maintain some moistness and not dry out.

Awesome flavors...and oh, so easy! Great combo, sweetness of carrots and sharpness of fennel. This will now be a family favorite! Served with old family standby of marinated pork tenderloin with mustard/chive sauce...a total winner! Spring is here, yeah!
