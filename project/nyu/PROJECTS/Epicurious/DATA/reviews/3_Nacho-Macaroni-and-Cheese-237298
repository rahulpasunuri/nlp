This is a rich, delicious recipe that invites experimentation. Seasoned meats, beans and cumin, and salsa variations all seem to play well with the base recipe. I typically replace 1/4 cup of cream with more milk and add 2 teaspoons of flour. It's even better the second day after it firms up in the fridge.

ISH, Like lunchroom macaroni casserole.

In my opinion the best macaroni. Has been a staple for years. Used 5 yr old cheddar, and more cilantro/salsa mixture (used a red, medium salsa).Also I added a pound of ground beef done taco style.Any kind of tube or shell noodle will work. Awesome!

This is a great twist on an old classic. I use only about 1/2 cup cilantro to keep it "kid-friendly" for the under-5 crowd. It has been a crowd pleaser for family dinner and as part of a dinner party menu since finding the recipe 2 weeks ago! Love it!

I'm glad I tried this recipe. That said, I have to confess 1) I goofed on the amount of cheese I used. I added all of the cheese to the cheese sauce and had to grate some more cheese to put on top of the corn chips. 2) I added some Velveeta to the cheese sauce in place of some of the extra sharp cheddar. Velveeta helps keep the sauce creamy. 3) When I noticed that a previous reviewer commented on the grainy texture of her sauce I decided to make a roux, slowly whisked in my warm milk mixture and then added my cheese to make a cheese sauce. The sauce was very creamy. 4) Also, per a earlier reviewer, I used extra salsa verde which was perfect for us. I guess my product was more in the spirit of the recipe rather than a faithful replication.

I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before I tried this one. Everyone loved it -- it disappeared quickly. I did add more cheese.

Not worth making again. Basically you can use any mac and cheese recipe and add some salsa. I'd probably add chicken, too. But this recipe on it's own is not worth keeping.

Yummy Mac&cheese! I'd double the amount of cilantro/verde sauce and garnish with sour cream and guacamole. Can't stop eating this one!

This is fantastic. My husband and I absolutely love it. Easy to make, great straight out of the oven and just as good as leftovers.

I added browned, ground chicken to this recipe, with great results. I don't think I've ever served anything that disappeared as fast as this dish did!!

We really enjoyed this. It was a fun take on mac & cheese. Try avoiding the long version of the recipe, and making simple mac & cheese in the pan and then putting in a pyrex.

I was pretty disappointed in this recipe. My biggest beef was with the consistency of the cream sauce which I would describe as "grainy". With that said, I will mention that I made this dish an hour or so before I cooked it but that shouldn't have made the sauce change consistency. I probably should have doubled the sauce as the pasta absorbed some of it due to sitting and the dish was not creamy enough. But I can not figure out why the sauce that I did have felt like it had sand in it.

I don't think this falls into 'quick and easy' with two separate sauces. I tried adding the ground beef, after the last review, but still, not really a great recipe. It was OK, but I don't think I'll make it again.

I took blairtrabue's advice and doubled the cheese and added some ground beef and it was a hit! My husband couldn't stop raving about it - I'll definitely be making this again - this is a sure crowd pleaser.

I double the cheese sauce (makes it creamy), add 1 pound of ground meat (cooked), use white pepper, add a touch of ground mustard, and a bit of ground cayanne pepper to spice it up. You can also use some Rotel instead of the salsa. My daughter (15 months) loves it.

Just so-so. I didn't think it had much flavor, and my kids definitely didn't like it.

My partner absolutely goes bananas everytime I make this. Had a dinner party last week and needed something vegetarian and decided to make the dish. The dish was a hit and was completely gone by the end of the night. Important to chop and mix the salsa with the cilantro in a processor. I also use extra sharp cheddar and white cheddar and a dollop of sour cream once I place it in a bowl. Yummy!

I'm cursed with a distaste for cilantro, so I omitted it, though I don't mind it in salsa. I used La Victoria mild salsa verde because it's all my grocery store had. I also used mini penne instead of macaroni. Though it was great, I would probably salt it a little next time, use a bit less cloves because they were strong. The salsa will definitely be hotter next time and/or I will add pickled jalepenos. I also love the idea of adding ground beaf for more protein and depth. This dish is not as complex-tasting as it seems at first glance. I served it with tequila-lime grilled tilapia and beer!

I was really excited about this, sounded so good. I think my mistake was making it as a main course instead of as a side. It just ended up being kind of one-note (and this comes from someone whose favorite meal is a big plate of nachos). I think maybe some red salsa on the side (or baked in) would help, or having it as a side dish so that you don't get sick of the one flavor so much. The clove is interesting, but it starts to become a little cloying.

I wanted to make this recipe healthier, so I used low-fat cheese, 2% milk, 1/2&1/2, whole-wheat pasta, and multi-grain tortilla chips. I don't know how it would have tasted otherwise, but this was fantastic! I used red salsa, and it certainly needed more. I also put ground beef that I cooked up with a little olive oil and chili powder in it, which gave it more of a nacho-feel. It was wonderful.

This recipe was tasty and easy. II substituted half-and-half for the heavy cream, and the consistency was perfect. I'll definitely make it again.

I thought this was a wonderful twist on a classic -- something different for a side dish, while still retaining the comfort food appeal.

YUM! I'm always struggling to find meatless dinners for my vegetarian daughter that my meat-loving husband will like too. They both LOVED this and it was easy!! Definitely a keeper.

We really enjoyed this twist on mac and cheese, and it was pretty easy to put together. I was skeptical of including the ground cloves in the cheese sauce, but they really complemented the flavor of the salsa verde and cheese quite nicely. I used Desert Pepper brand green salsa and it worked well, though I think the fresh cilantro added a lot of flavor.

My daughter who is away in college came home to give rave reviews to this great tex/mex flavored mac and cheese..Mom loved it too! Since the salsa verde was not really defined I would suggest geting MRs.Remfros Jalapeno salsa and using a scant 1/4 cup... it was perfect!!
