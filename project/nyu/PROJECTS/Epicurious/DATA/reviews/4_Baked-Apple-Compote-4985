Love the simple, rustic appeal of this dish. The salt is essential to bring it together, but I omit the pepper unless it's a meat accompaniment. Double the recipe and line pan with non-stick foil for easy juice recovery!

I'm going to try it face up, vice down, next time. I only had ground cloves, but it tasted fine.

Great & simple. Serve with any savory recipe with pork. This was recommended with Pork Chops with Sauce Poivrade and Wine-Braised Red Cabbage (also on this site). The meal was fantastic.

Simply delicious! But this only makes 4 small servings - if you have a family that loves cinnamon and apple sauce, this is not enough. I would double the recipe the next time - which will be soon!

Fabulous! It's become a fast favourite.
