I made this for New Yr's day brunch. I used poached eggs instead of fried. It was easy to put together and flavorful. I think that this a great recipe for a crowd and it's very versatile. I bet it's just as good with bacon, ham or prosciutto. I will definitely make this again.

Easy flexible recipe. I did this for a large family do. Used ciabatta rolls cut in half instead of the bread loaf. I prepared a variety of cheeses, sausages, diced bacon, mushrooms, thinly sliced tomatoes & sliced jalapena peppers in advance. Everyone built their own pizzas depending on their own preferences. It was a huge hit.

Tested the recipe this weekend. Wanted to make something different than the usual strada to take to a friend's for breakfast/brunch after the July 4 party. Turned out great! Maybe it was the size of the ciabatta that I bought, but I think I could divide this into more than 4 servings per half of the bread and it would still be more than satisfying.

This is a 4 fork plus. It is not only easy but oh so delicious. It will be a regular in this house and I can't wait to try different combinations.

Believe it or not, I made this for a football tailgate party. The guys loved it. I did use turkey sausage (didn't tell them), assembled the ciabatta at home, wrapped them in foil, and toasted them on the grill. Everyone was skeptical until they tasted the finished product.

Fabulous flavor! We enjoyed this in spite of a near "fiasco" because I mistakenly bought SLICED ciabatta. No problem--I just layered slices in groups of three and used some of the cheese slices and sausage as "filling" between layers to help keep together. Voila! It worked. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was great. I used less olive oil 5 tablespoons insead of 8 to make it slightly healthier. I also used chicken sausage instead of pork. I added mushrooms and tomatoes as well.

This was the perfect lazy Saturday brunch. I made this with spicy italian chicken sausage and a mixture of jarslberg and munster cheese. I added garlic to the infused oil and used that oil to make the eggs as well. And I kind of found the sausages to be a bit too tasteless so I added a healthy dose of tabasco and bruschetta topping. The result: a spicy bruschetta brunch. Delish.

As a baker I used my own wood-fired ciabatta with Spanish Chorizo and Gruyere. It makes a great quick dinner too.

This is beyond 4 forks. I used spicy Italian sausage and followed all the other ingredients to the letter. It was superb. Like the last reviewer, the onion oil was fabulous. This is one of the best recipes I have found on this site, and the best fr breakfast, by far.

I made this recipe for a couple friends and they loved it! Used french bread instead of ciabatta . . . no difference. It was fast, different, and delicious. The green onion-oil made the dish.
