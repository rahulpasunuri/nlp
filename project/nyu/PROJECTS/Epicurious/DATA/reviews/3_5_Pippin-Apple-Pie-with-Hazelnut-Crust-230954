My first made from scratch pie and it was rated by those who tried it as State Fair winning. I didn't use Pippin apples, just used a mix of what I had. Used about 1/4 to 1/3 hazelnuts (what I had). I used only a tablespoon of the sugars because apples were sweet enough and just a dab of cinnamon, didn't want to overpower the apples. Using a food processor to blend the butter and shortening was genius. I agree it was enough dough and apples for a 10" pie which I'll do next time so I'll have even MORE.

I am an experienced baker and I love to bake. Although the crust for this recipe was tasty, it did not roll out and stay together at all. I had to piece it together and press it into the pie pan for the bottom crust. The top crust was a mess and I had to try to repair it once I placed it on top of the pie filling. It was not a pretty picture. The filling was good, nice flavor and not too sweet. I had not made this is advance and was disappointed with the look of this pie on my Thanksgiving table.

I have made this pie numerous times with apples and once with pears. It always turns out delicious! I have found the crust recipe makes enough pie dough to easily do a 10 inch pie and still have some leftover so last time I recalculated the crust ingredients to 2/3 of what is called for and ended up with the perfect amount for a 9 inch pie. The hazelnut crust is what really makes this pie special.

I used hazelnut flour - Bob's Red Mill instead of grinding my own. I used the recipe on the bag of hazelnut flour which called for no additional AP flour. I added some anyway, and it turned out great... Word of advice for those baking without air conditioning: roll out your crusts, THEN preheat your oven.

I doubled the apples, substituted almonds for hazelnuts, and pressed the dough into springform pans and made two deep dish apple pies. Total success.

Loved it! I've made this pie twice and got good reviews from friends and coworkers. I couldn't find Pippin apples, so I make it with 4 Granny Smith and 2 Gala, and it comes out great! The crust isn't that hard to make as pie crusts go, and I thought it was delicious. A few fewer hazelnuts helps keep it from getting too dry, and more than an hour in the fridge made it easier to roll out. And don't skip the ice cream on top - it just isn't the same!

I have made this pie every year since I found the recipe. Whoever I have over as a guest always says it's the best apple pie they've ever had. The crust is a pain to make though, but it tastes great.

Terrific! I don't use lard or shortening, so substituted butter; and added more water because the dough seemed way too dry. Also, I mixed the water in in the food processor. Result was excellent: easy to manage, tender and flakey. Delicious pie.

Served this up to some Yankee, apple pie lovers. It was the rave!!! But I have to say the crust was a bear to make and it fell in upon cooling. Next time I'll try a few less nuts.

To the cook in VA- the recipe actually received 2 1/2 forks...

Ok, I didn't make this recipe, I'm just wondering about the math here, Epicurious. One reviewer gave it two forks. The other reviewer gave it three forks. Why is it shown with an overall rating of 4 forks?? Even if they both said they'd make it again, it's obviously not a 4-forker!

Sorry, only 2 forks from me. I followed the recipe to the letter and found the crust heavy and hard. The filling, however, was delicious. We ate around the crust (unusual for us!)and threw the crust away.
