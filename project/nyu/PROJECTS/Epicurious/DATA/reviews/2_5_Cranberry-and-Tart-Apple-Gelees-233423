so i adapted this to make grapefruit gelee. the thing i don't get about this recipe is the inclusion of whole cloves prior to blending the mixture. seeing as it's boiled for only fifteen minutes, this seems like the result would be cranberry-twig gelee. seems like a mistake.

The cranberry ones tasted like sliced ocean spray cranberry jelly rolled in sugar.

I made these last year and I am thinking about making them again these year. I was reading the reviews and was surprised by so many cooks having problems with this recipe. I did not have any problems with it. And I should say, my candies turned out beautiful and delicious. I just love these kind of candies so much!

The cranberry gelees turned out great, though I did have to cook them longer than expected. They were pretty and had a wonderful sweet-tart flavor. The tart apple gels were just a dud. They didn't set, and I ended up cooking them so long they turned a dark brownish green, rather like swamp water. The taste wasn't there either. I'd just stick with the cranberry ones!

I have never rated something so low. Mine ended up in the trash. I was going to give them as gifts but there is no way I could pass these on to anyone. My husband said the cranberry ones reminded him of a condiment, not candy and the apple ones were really weird. Might be good for a Sci fi themed party as space food. Way too much trouble for the results.

I made these for the holidays, and they were a fun change from the norm. For some reason the cranberry ones didn't set as well as the apple. I actually cooked the cranberry longer, though. Also, let them sit a bit at room temperature before rolling in sugar. Then make sure to store them at room temp and not in the fridge. This seemed to keep the sugar coating from melting.

I made both gelees and was a bit disappointed. I had the same problem with the sugar melting and leaving a slick on the bottom of my container. The flavor is good but the texture was not as jellied as I expected. I also ended up w/ alot of gelees w/ rounded edges since my glass dish is curved at the sides. They didn't look as good as the photo. boo. but the taste was pretty good. Fun to cook and I love trying something new.

I made the cranberry variation. It was hard to know when they were done and it took a long time to cook. I'm leaving them out to dry after coating with sugar. The flavor is good, like cranberry orange relish, but the color is very dark.

I only made the tart apple gelees, and they tasted terrific and looked fabulous, however, they were too moist and the sugar that I used to coat them quickly "melted" into syrup that coated the bottom of the container that I stored them in. Perhaps they need to be left out to dry overnight, once rolled in sugar?

I thought these would be great, but was a little bummed at how they turned out- I think I needed to cook them a bit longer. The taste was fantastic but couldn't easily be cut into squares.
