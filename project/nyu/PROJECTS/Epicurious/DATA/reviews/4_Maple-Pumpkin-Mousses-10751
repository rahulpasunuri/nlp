I used 3/4 a can of pumpkin and upped the maple syrup to 3/4 cup. I also replaced the gelatin with a vegetarian substitute called agar agar. It had been a long time since I'd used agar agar, so the texture didn't come out perfectly, but that has nothing to do with the quality of this recipe.

This was a heavenly dessert last year. I was avoiding refined sugar and this fit the bill and was delicious besides. Instead of using pumpkins, I used packed pumpkin in cans and substituted a half pound of packed pumpkin for the "real" stuff. I also put it in a pie crust made of unsweetened coconut, (avoiding flour as well) butter, and sucanot, which is sugar substitute made from sugar juice that is dried. Very easy recipe.

This recipe is useless due to the fact you have NO idea just how much pumpkin you are using.
