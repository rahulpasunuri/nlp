This is delicious. Followed directions exactly. Served a small scoop atop the Harvest Pear Crisp with Candied Ginger, but equally good on its own. Don't know why it needs the 2T. sugar, since it has all that honey and is plenty sweet.

This was the big hit of my party yesterday. Everyone RAVED about it and I will definitely make it again - will be fantastic with gingerbread or spice cake this fall!
