I thought these scones were exceptional. I love fennel, so was predisposed to like them, but the meld of flavors was really terrific. I used half whole wheat pastry flour, half unbleached white; otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The scones were unusually tender and so flavorful!

Surprisingly delicious. I was a little worried about the amount of fennel, but I made these to-the-letter, and they turned out great. A sophisticated, "grown-up" flavor. Make sure not to over mix!

Yummy! Very easy and very tasty. Loved it, will make it again, would not change anything in the recipe.

My brunch crowd liked these immensely -- and I liked that they were simple and reliable (2 batches came out exactly the same). Next time, I'll try diced apricot in place of the raisins, as the golden raisins didn't add much punch. Loved the walnuts and thought the amt of sugar was just right -- not too sweet.

I have a friend who loves fennel in everything so I had to try this recipe. It actually has a very good flavor and leaves a refreshing fennel aftertaste. The flavors seemed to accentuate after trying them again the next morning.
