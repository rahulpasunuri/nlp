This was hot but not overly - perfect for the fritters. Made for a nice New Year's meal.

This sauce is sooooo good. I made a quadruple batch for New Year's to go along with the black-eyed pea fritters and got so many compliments. This was easy to make and the heat level was just perfect. This is likely something I'll make to keep on hand in the fridge from now on - my husband loved it. The only substitution I made in the recipe was using black pepper instead of white because that's all I had + I accidentally added it in with the tomato products, so it was cooked in.

Followed the basic recipe, but used several big thai chili peppers because I wanted the pepper flavor to dominate. Also used more cayenne and white pepper for more pop. Also, like four cloves of garlic. Awesome place to start for any pepper sauce I'd imagine.

This hot sauce IS slammin -- full of flavor and so easy to make! It's just the right blend of sweet and spicy. The carmelized onions add a smoky flavor. It's not overly spicy either, which I like because I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food.
