I thought this sandwich was very good - different from the every day chicken sandwich. I did add some chinese vinegar to the slaw in addition to the sesame oil to add more flavor. We really enjoyed it, I was surprised to see the negative reviews.

Overall, this is a bland, dry sandwich. While the chicken tasted good, there was no moisture or flavor in the slaw. I'd probably dress it with a Chinese Chicken salad-type vinaigrette.

maybe I expected too much from a recipe that had so many delicious ingredients but this was just so ordinary tasting. Also, the slaw itself was way too bland w/ only sesame oil. There are better sandwiches out there.
