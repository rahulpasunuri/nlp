Great flavors. It is mild but that was preferred. My teenagers loved it except they picked out all the apricots. Most definately use 1/2 the coconut milk and we cut up the chicken into bite size pieces

Love the flavors! We prefer chicken thighs, so I brown them as directed, then return them to the sauce as it cooks down, so that they cook through.

This is so easy and so delicious, made it to serve for our dinner club with homemade flat bread with cilantro, and a spinach/ricotta cheese curry, so utterly delcious!

Decent, but not spectacular. I agree that as written, the sauce is very mild, but it had a nice texture. I agree with the reviewer who said the amount of coconut milk is probably an issue of personal preference. I used basil instead of cilantro (my cilantro plant is dead, my basil is thriving) figuring that basil wasn't completely out of the realm for Thai flavors, and it worked well - although I am curious about what the cilantro would have brought. Still, if you're in a bind, basil works.

A tasty dish. My husband is not a fan of curry, but he really liked this one. It was sweet with a kick. Left the sauce off the chicken for the kids, and mixed some snap peas in. As others mentioned I doubled the red curry paste and 1/2'd the coconut milk. Basmati rice rounds it out nicely.

Just wanted to add that I am experimenting with this site's wine pairings and really enjoyed having this dish with the Mosel-region Markus Militor 2007 Riesling I tried...

A nice comfort-food recipe but it ended up lacking enough curry flavor. Next time I'd definitely double the curry paste along with the fresh ginger and I'd throw lots of extra cilantro in. I added a handful of left-over sweet peas, resulting in a delightful color contrast.

Rating: 3
Following suggestions from others, I doubled the curry paste and used only one can of coconut milk. It was still a bit tame and we like curries spicy so I will add more next time. Thai curries are usually soupy and Indian curries are generally thicker, so I guess it's a personal preference whether to use less coconut milk. I think it would be fine either way, adjusting the seasonings as needed.

I was sorely disappointed with this recipe. It was sickly sweet and on the greasy side. I followed the recipe without any deviations. We had it again for lunch the next day, and I threw the rest out.

This is excellent and very easy to make. I added garlic and fresh green beans and it was excellent. Perfect for an easy company meal.

It's funny how people will rate the recipe a 3 or 4, but tell you how they added 10 "more" ingredients or substituted a bunch of things on the ingredient list.I made this as is and it was delicious. If you like curry with apples and garlic, check out Chatelaine Magazine and look up Curried Chicken with Apples and Bananas - and make it as is. It, too is delicious.

I have made this a hundred times and it comes out perfect every time and so so de-lish! Get a bottle of German wine from the Mosel region kind of on the sweeter side, so good!

I made this tonight, adding as did so many before me garlic, red peppers, pea pods, and using just one can of coconut. I also used a whole onion, added a chopped granny smith apple, and doubled the ginger. I served it with Basmati rice, bananas and chutney, and I thought it was delicious and relatively easy.

Wow! Fantastic!! I followed the recipe but added 2 cloves of garlic and some favourite veggies. Better than restaurant good. Bland? I don't think so!

I've made this dish many times the key is the cilantro. Cutting it out does make the dish bland, however with the cilantro the dish is fantastic.

This recipe is AMAZING!!! Whenever I've done people have asked me for the recipe! I must have done it about 7 times so I thought I HAVE to add a comment to encourage others to make it as well! I am quite careless with the measurements but it comes out great everytime! Impossible to mess this one up

I was so disappointed. This sounded great but ended up very bland. The only changes I made were substituting fresh basil for the cilantro and light coconut milk for regular. My husband and I both felt it needed more depth of flavor. Perhaps adding fish sauce and garlic might help.

fantastic! we cut the coconut milk down to just a mid-sized splash to reduce the fat, and it was absolutely amazing.

Wow! What a great and easy recipe. I normally do not care for coconut sauces, but this was lovely and not overpowering. I did use two suggestions from others: 1)Two cloves of garlic added to the shallots; 2)Add green beans towards the end of the cooking process to make it a true "one skillet dinner." Both were perfect. The main combined with the rice and veg made dinner for my 6'3 boyfriend and I with enough left over for dinner tonight, so I would say that it should feed 4-6. We were stuffed! I also did not find it messy to prepare at all. If anything else, the one pan preparation made it less so. We will be enjoying this regularly -- plate lickin' good!

I absolutely love this recipe! It's reasonably quick, really easy and tastes so good. I made it twice. The 2nd time I realized I didn't have enough dried apricots, so I used half of dried mangoes instead, and thought it was a good substitution

Rating: 3
This recipe has very nice flavors and is easy to prepare. The lack of garlic and lemon grass make it less "authentic" thai, but I'm not such a purist as to let that deter me. Like most others, I used only one can of coconut milk with one pound of chicken and it was a very hearty meal for two (served over white rice), with plenty of sauce. The chutney and fresh cilantro are the key flavors coming through the coconut milk sauce -- my FAVORITE things -- so I will make this again and again. Oh, and the red curry paste is key! One tablespoon was the right amount for us, a little kick but not crazy. Experiment and enjoy!

Mmmmmmmmmm....we LOVED this dish. I made the following changes: I added 1 red bell pepper and 3 cloves of minced garlic with the shallots, used only one can of coconut milk, added the apricots at the end. I served this over brown rice (1 cup before cooking). It was sooo good that I used my finger to lick the plate clean *smile*!

I thought this curry was great - I followed the recommendations of other reviewers (half the amt of coconut milk, twice as much curry powder, waiting to add the apricots, adding 2 cloves of garlic with the shallots, and sauting bell pepper and fresh green beans to mix in at the last steps) and served it over brown rice. Because I added extra curry, I think it could have used an extra 8 oz of coconut milk. The chicken was moist and spicey, the vegetables crunchy, the apricots added a nice sweet touch. I served the dish with slices of fresh mango on top. MMMMMMM! Definetely will make this again.. and again.. and again...

Tastes like something you would get in a Thai restaurant! I will make this again for sure but will add bambo shoots or baby corn. I added some basil and some lime juice over the top when serving, beans sprouts I think would go well too!Note: it takes longer to reduce than 10 minutes.

It's a great recipe, easy to make. Probably easier and less messy if you prepare everything before hand (cut up, measure, etc.). I skip the cilantro and add the apricots in later then what the recipe says. It's definetly one of my and my boyfriends favorites!!

Rating: 3
This dish required that I make a huge mess of my kitchen, have lots of leftover sauce, and eat leftovers for days. I loved it! It was fun to make and way tasty, though I wish it had a bit more kick - it's a sweet dish. Maybe serve with something very spicy.

Rating: 3
Simple and tasty. Easy to moderate or increase the heat factor by adding more or less Thai curry paste. Added the apricots later in the cooking cycle to keep from mushing and this change worked well. Also found long-grain brown rice to be a good compliment. Used low fat coconut milk w/o any negative impact on flavor.

This is one of those dishes that taste better and better with each new bite. This being my first make at home Thai Dish, I was very pleased that it was so easy to make and so tasty. However, I would like to add that because of the previous reviews I decided to use 1 can of coconut milk and 1/2 a can of water with just a touch of half & half. That kept the sauce rich without being too rich & too "coconutty". There was enough sauce to use a pound & a half of chicken. I used boneless skinless breasts cut into strips. Since we like it a little hot I also added an extra tablespoon of red curry paste. Plus if your concerned about the apricots getting too mushy, I added them at the very last minute and they absorbed enough of the curry flavour without becoming too mushy. This really turned out great for me!

This was the first curry dish I ever prepared. It was very easy to make and yeilded great flavour and very positive reviews. In further attempts I will add an additional tablespoon of curry paste ... we like it hot!!

I read the reviews(as Always) then tweaked thir recipe Instead of shallots used 2 small onions and 2 cloves garlic then followed the recipe until I discovered I had prunes no apricots (prunes went into the curry)thinly sliced orange/yellow sweet peppers and snowpeas and threw that in, also some fish sauce and basil at the same time. Then I served it all over pasta. It was incrediable, next time I might up the curry paste a wee bit I use Thai kitchen which is really hot this is a really good dish read the reviewers and make this your own dish YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY

I really wasn't terribly impressed with this recipe. It was good, and the client I made it for enjoyed it, but I didn't think it was anything special. It did not have the complicated mingling of flavors that I like in a curry dish. I will say, however, that the flavors mellowed and got tastier after the day I cooked it. I would leave the apricots out until you are heating it up right before serving; they got mushy during cooking even though I put them in at the end and were even mushier as leftovers. I think it was worth making, but I will look for another curry recipe.

To those who have commented: Yes, most people can feed 4 with a pound of chicken (that is only 4 oz. each, a reasonable amount). I just made this and we loved it; we served 3 and had one portion left over. I used 1 can of light coconut milk, and was prepared to dilute with some chicken broth, but it was not needed. We found the spice level perfect, but some would find it too spicy (and probably others, not spicy enough!). Served it with steamed rice and Super Slaw from this Web site, a perfect combo. Will make often. (By the way, what veggies are in here???)

To the cook in Wilmette, it is a pound of chicken, with sauce/veggies added. Given also that it is served over rice, you're pretty safe to say that it serves at least 4-6 (remember, a serving of meat is really only a few ounces)

This is delicious. Its 3.5 forks. As suggested, I only used 1 can of coconut milk and added 1 cup of chicken broth. Also threw in some eggplant. Its even better the next day. Must try it!

One of my favorite dishes. I followed other's suggestions and added mushroom and green beans. I used only one can of lowfat coconut milk and some extra water, the taste was rich and creamy and it cut out a lot of fat. I can't imagine how rich it would be otherwise. I only added the apricots at the end. The red curry powder is super spicy, so use with caution. I also made my own mango chutney, so I used 1 mango, a little rice vinegar, sugar, 1/8 cup cranberries and some cinnamon powder. It sounds like I fiddled with the recipe a lot, but this is the end result after making this several times. It is delish!

Although this was one of the better coconut curry recipes on this site, I was a little disappointed after all the rave reviews. I made it as written, and it seemed to be missing something (some salt (as in fish sauce) maybe?). Next time I would be more careful with the red curry paste too! I added extra (my husband and I like spicy food) and it was VERY hot! Maybe some red peppers and fresh basil might wake it up a bit for next time?

I also added mushrooms and snow peas and as suggested before, add the apricots at the very end.

I have recently become infatuated with Thai food, but have found few recipes to make. This was not difficult, not too many offbeat ingredients, had Thai appeal and was delicious. Next time, I would likely add a little chicken broth to thin the sauce as it got a bit pasty on the rice. The flavor, however, was luscious!

Rating: 3
Spicy!!! This has the potential to be four forks, with a few changes. The dried apricots add an interesting sweetness, be sure not to add too many. I used way less coconut milk (about 2/3 of a can) replacing the volume with water. Next time I'll use a full can of each water and coconut milk. I think I'll try it with some red peppers and fresh peas next time, too.

I made this recipe as is but used only one can of coconut milk per other reviewers suggestions. Glad I did that... It was very good and not too rich. My dad was visiting and gave it 5 stars. Love the apricots in the sauce. Very nice addition...

Excellent flavor. Used masaman curry paste & thai red. Cut down on coconut milk and added water for a thinner, less rich sauce. Would add in apricots toward the end of the cooking process next time so they stay firm and not mushy. Loved it!

I thought this was great. Way too much coconut milk for us though. The second time I made it I only used 1/2 can coconut milk and I added 1/2 can water. It was much lighter.

I'm making this recipes again tonight because my husband and I enjoyed it so much the first time. It's a great recipe because you can easily adjust the seasonings to your taste, more or less chili paste, cilantro, etc. We served it with an Indonesian fried rice so the sweetness of that that worked well with the heat of the curry. Definately a recipe to try and and adjust to your preference.

I would give this dish two and a half forks. Two cans of coconut milk make it very, very rich. Next time, I may use just one can of coconut milk, coupled with some tomato puree (which I think would add a nice flavor, while paring down the calories). Also, the idea that one reviewer had of adding lime juice sounds good, as the sauce is a bit on the sweet side.

Rating: 3
In the end, this made a lovely curry. It's quite simple to make and is flavourful, though a little sweet. To balance the sweetness I added some lime juice and some rice wine vinegar. I also added a splash of white wine, used onions in place of shallots, and used a single can of coconut milk which was enough for me. If you can get galangal, try it in place of the ginger for a different Thai taste.

Very tasty indeed---made still better by using more curry paste and chutney than are called for, and by adding a good squirt of lime juice as the coconut milk is simmering.

At first I thought why is there only 1 review of this recipe....it sounds so great. I love the combination of hot & sweet. I doubled the amount of curry paste & reduced the amount of coconut milk by almost half (next time I will try low fat coconut milk)...It was FABULOUS! Rarely do I give 4 forks, but this was great!

Definately the best curry I've ever made. I wanted to give it three and a half forks, and I would've given if four, but it didn't have quite enough bite. I added a bit more than one tablespoon of curry paste, and it still wasn't enough. Next time, I'll put in at least two tablespoons. I've experimented with several different fruits, too, and the apricots in this recipe went really well.
