Not bad. I've made something similar with zucchini (not boiled; just sauteed) and it turned out much better.

Sounds much better than it tastes.... not worth the effort.

I liked it, I thought the flavors were pretty tasty. But, honestly I really like any other kind of noodle better. If you make this, be prepared for the texture of cooked cucumber to be more slippery than a regular noodle. Do not make this dish for someone who is sensitive to textures. My boyfriend suggested we make this, but he couldn't eat it because of the texture of the cooked cucumber. He liked the spicing. It's worth a try, but I probably wouldn't make it again.

This was terrible. I would never make it again

this was unexpectedly good.. added a little more pepper, mint, lemon peel.. the cooked cucumbers taste very very different. lemon and mint with the butter give punch. flavorful and definitely worth try!

This recipe lends itself to lots of improvising. For a Thai flavor, I used peanut oil instead of butter, added cilantro and basil along with the mint, and used lime zest instead of lemon. Same technique, completely different flavor.

This very, very good and helps shoo the "pasta" attack away. I slice the cucumbers the same way and just sprinkle a little olive oil and rice wine vinegar over it for salad. It's delish!
